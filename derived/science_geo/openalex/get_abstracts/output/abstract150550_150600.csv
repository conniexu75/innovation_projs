https://openalex.org/W2016443141,"The nuclear hormone receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ is a ligand-activated transcription factor that regulates several crucial biological processes such as adipogenesis, glucose homeostasis, and cell growth. It is also the functional receptor for a new class of insulin-sensitizing drugs, the thiazolidinediones, now widely used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Here we report that PPARγ protein levels are significantly reduced in adipose cells and fibroblasts in response to specific ligands such as thiazolidinediones. Studies with several doses of different ligands illustrate that degradation of PPARγ correlates well with the ability of ligands to activate this receptor. However, analyses of PPARγ mutants show that, although degradation does not strictly depend on the transcriptional activity of the receptor, it is dependent upon the ligand-gated activation function 2 (AF2) domain. Proteasome inhibitors inhibited the down-regulation of PPARγ and ligand activation enhanced the ubiquitination of this receptor. These data indicate that, although ligand binding and activation of the AF2 domain increase the transcriptional function of PPARγ, these same processes also induce ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of this receptor by the proteasome.

Two forms of PPARγ, PPARγ1 and PPARγ2, are generated by alternative splicing. PPARγ2 bears an additional 30 amino acids at the amino terminus and is predominantly expressed in adipose tissue. PPARγ plays a central regulatory role in adipogenesis, where it acts in concert with members of the CAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) family of transcription factors (reviewed in Ref. 1.Wu Z. Puigserver P. Spiegelman B.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The expression of PPARγ mRNA and protein are induced early during adipogenesis. Many of the adipocyte-specific genes harbor PPARγ binding sites in their promoters or upstream enhancer regions. Gain-of-function experiments have shown that PPARγ is sufficient to induce adipogenesis, specifically, ectopic expression and activation of PPARγ in fibroblasts efficiently induces an adipocytic phenotype (2.Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3098) Google Scholar). Recent genetic studies conclusively demonstrate that PPARγ is also absolutely required for fat cell formation. Cells lacking both alleles for PPARγ do not differentiate into adipocytes in vitro orin vivo; a PPARγ−/− mouse lived only briefly after birth and lacked visible fat pads (3.Kubota N. Terauchi Y.

The gene dosage of PPARγ is apparently important, because differentiation of cells that contain only a single PPARγ allele shows a phenotype intermediate to wild-type and null cells (3.Kubota N. Terauchi Y. Miki H. Tamemoto H. Yamauchi T. Komeda K. Satoh S. Nakano R. Ishii C. Sugiyama T. Eto K. Tsubamoto Y. Okuno A. Murakami K. Sekihara H. Hasegawa G. Naito M. Toyoshima Y. Tanaka S.

PPARγ has also been implicated in the regulation of systemic insulin sensitivity. This was first suggested when PPARγ was found to be the functional receptor for a group of synthetic insulin-sensitizing agents, the thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which are currently used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (6.Lehmann J.M.

Endocrinol. Metab. Clin. North Am. 1997; 26: 553-573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). This role is now supported by the finding that certain mutations within PPARγ are associated with severe insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus, even though these patients are not obese (8.Barroso I. Gurnell M. Crowley V.E. Agostini M. Schwabe J.W. Soos M.A. Maslen G.L. Williams T.D. Lewis H. Schafer A.J. Chatterjee V.K. O'Rahilly S. Nature. 1999; 402: 880-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar). Although expressed at lower levels than in adipose cells, PPARγ has also been implicated in the growth and/or differentiation of several cell types such as monocytes, breast, and colonic epithelium. The ability of PPARγ to arrest growth in many of these cell types has suggested a possible connection to tumor biology (reviewed in Refs. 9.Ricote M. Huang J.T. Welch J.S. Glass C.K. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1999; 66: 733-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar,10.Rocchi S. Auwerx J. Ann. Med. 1999; 31: 342-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Indeed, loss-of-function mutations of PPARγ have been found in human colon cancers, suggesting a possible role as a tumor suppressor in this cell lineage (11.Sarraf P. Mueller E. Smith W.M.

Recently, clinical data show that treatment of liposarcoma patients with TZDs induced tumor differentiation and a reduction in tumor cell growth (12.Demetri G.D. Fletcher C.D. Mueller E. Sarraf P. Naujoks R. Campbell N. Spiegelman B.M. Singer S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3951-3956Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). PPARγ is a ligand-activated transcription factor that binds to DR-1 sites as a heterodimeric complex with the retinoic X receptor (RXR). Synthetic ligands for PPARγ are the aforementioned TZDs (e.g. troglitazone, pioglitazone, and rosiglitazone) and certain nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (6.Lehmann J.M. Moore L.B.

Natural ligands include 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2(15-dPGJ2), certain polyunsaturated fatty acids such as linoleic acid, and endogenous constituents of oxidized low density lipoprotein particles such as 9- and 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid and 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (14.Nagy L.

Nature. 1999; 400: 378-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). All of these natural compounds are low affinity ligands. So far, there is no consensus on the existence or the nature of a high affinity endogenous ligand. To date, the major regulatory events identified in PPARγ function are ligand binding, coactivator docking, and phosphorylation at an inhibitory serine (serine 112 of murine PPARγ) by mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase (18.Camp H.S. Tafuri S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10811-10816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 19.Hu E. Kim J.B. Sarraf P. Spiegelman B.M.

Chem. 1999; 274: 2672-2681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). As for most nuclear receptors, binding of agonist ligands induces a conformational change in a conserved helix in the carboxyl terminus of the ligand binding domain (22.Nolte R.T. Wisely G.B. Westin S. Cobb J.E. Lambert M.H. Kurokawa R. Rosenfeld M.G. Willson T.M. Glass C.K. Milburn M.V. Nature. 1998; 395: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (1667) Google Scholar). This helix, also known as the AF2 helix, is a docking site for a number of coactivators that stimulate transcription via acetylation of core histones or interaction with the basal transcription machinery (reviewed in Ref. 23.McKenna N.J. Xu J. Nawaz Z. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 69: 3-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). PPARγ also is susceptible to negative regulation via covalent modification. Phosphorylation of serine 112 in murine PPARγ2 by MAP kinases (Erk 1, Erk 2, and stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun amino-terminal kinase) results in a strong suppression of PPARγ activity (18.Camp H.S.

Reginato M.J. Lazar M.A. Nature. 1998; 396: 377-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). We describe here a novel regulatory mechanism for PPARγ via ligand binding: the induction of ubiquitin-dependent degradation of this receptor by the proteasome. Because ligands induce both the transcriptional activation and the destruction of the receptor, these results illustrate a feedback system for balancing the transcriptional activity of PPARγ. Pioglitazone was purchased from Upjohn, Wy14,643 from Chemsyn, and 15d-PGJ2 from Cayman Chemical. Troglitazone, M2, and rosiglitazone were gifts from A. Saltiel (Parke-Davis Pharmaceuticals).

Degradation occurred both in the presence (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) + 10% fetal bovine serum) or the absence (DMEM + 2% bovine serum albumin) of growth factors. Expression of all PPARγ alleles is under the control of an SV-40 promoter. The plasmids for wild-type PPARγ (2.Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M.

Transfections were performed in triplicate. Cells were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then lysed in PBS supplemented with 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mmsodium vanadate, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (and 25 μg/ml ALLN for Figs. 4 and 5). Concentration of the soluble proteins was determined by Bradford assays (Bio-Rad), and for each sample the same amount of protein (50–100 μg) was analyzed by SDS gel electrophoresis after trichloroacetic acid precipitation (19.Hu E. Kim J.B. Sarraf P. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1996; 274: 2100-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). Western blots were performed as described previously (19.Hu E. Kim J.B. Sarraf P. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1996; 274: 2100-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). The antibody against PPARγ is described in a previous study (19.Hu E. Kim J.B. Sarraf P. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1996; 274: 2100-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar), antibodies against RXRα, C/EBPα, and cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) were obtained from Santa Cruz. Supernatant of 9E10 hybridoma cultures was a gift from S. Gaubatz. Immunoprecipitations were performed with an anti-PPARγ antibody (diluted 1:100) in lysis buffer. After 4 h of incubation, 50 μl of a 50:50 slurry of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added for another 2 h. Immunocomplexes were then washed three times with PBS + 1% Nonidet P-40. Immunocomplexes were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot as described above. Total RNA was isolated using the Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 10 μg of total RNA was analyzed for PPARγ mRNA with an EcoRI fragment of the PPARγ cDNA as described previously (2.Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3098) Google Scholar). To investigate the effect of PPARγ ligands on the level of this receptor, differentiated adipocytes were treated with either vehicle or pioglitazone, a ligand of the TZD class. Whole cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot analysis with an anti-PPARγ antibody. PPARγ2 appears as a doublet in solvent-treated cells; as shown earlier, the upper band is an inactive form of PPARγ, phosphorylated by MAP kinases on serine 112 (19.Hu E. Kim J.B. Sarraf P. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1996; 274: 2100-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). The lower band represents the nonphosphorylated, active form of this protein (Fig.1 A, lanes 1,11, and 12). Interestingly, treatment with pioglitazone resulted in a dramatic loss of PPARγ protein, with the active, nonphosphorylated form of this receptor lost preferentially (Fig. 1 A, lanes 2 and 3). The levels of two other proteins, RXRα, the heterodimerization partner of PPARγ, and C/EBPα did not change when the cells were exposed to pioglitazone. This indicates that the decrease in protein is selective or specific for PPARγ. To analyze more critically whether the decrease of PPARγ protein is related to specific ligand binding, differentiated adipocytes were treated with several different TZDs (pioglitazone, troglitazone, and rosiglitazone) and the natural ligand 15-dPGJ2. As controls we also used M2, a urinary metabolite of troglitazone that no longer binds to PPARγ, the PPARα-selective ligand Wy14,643, and the RXR-selective ligand LG268. Treatment with the different TZDs and with 15-dPGJ2 again resulted in a loss of the nonphosphorylated, active form of PPARγ (Fig. 1 A, compare lanes 2–7, 13, and15 with lanes 1, 11, and12). In contrast, treatment with the inactive troglitazone metabolite M2 or Wy14,643 and LG268 did not down-regulate PPARγ (Fig.1 A, lanes 8–10 and 14). Interestingly, LG268 did decrease the amount of its own receptor, RXRα (Fig. 1 A, compare lane 10 with lanes 1–9 and 11). Thus, the decrease of the PPARγ protein appears to be specific for PPARγ ligands. The experiments described were performed with concentrations of ligand (1 and 5 μm) that are above the K d of most of these ligands for PPARγ (40 nm for rosiglitazone to 3 μm for 15-dPGJ2). Therefore, a dose response was performed on differentiated adipocytes to determine the relationship between this reduced amount of protein and the affinity for a particular ligand. As shown in Fig. 1 B, an effect of pioglitazone on PPARγ levels could be detected at 50 nm, whereas strong effects could be seen at 500 nm (Fig.1 B, compare lanes 1 and 4), which is close to its EC50 of 690 nm (26.Willson T.M. Cobb J.E. Cowan D.J. Wiethe R.W. Correa I.D. Prakash S.R. Beck K.D. Moore L.B. Kliewer S.A. Lehmann J.M. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Recently, Shao et al. (24.Shao D. Rangwala S.M. Bailey S.T. Krakow S.L. Reginato M.J. Lazar M.A. Nature. 1998; 396: 377-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) proposed that the phosphorylated form of PPARγ binds to ligand with lower affinity than the nonphosphorylated form. In our experiments, ligand leads to the preferential loss of the nonphosphorylated PPARγ. Thus, the loss of the receptor generally correlates well with ligand binding. Rosenbaum and Greenberg (27.Rosenbaum S.E. Greenberg A.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1150-1160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Camp et al.(28.Camp H.S. Whitton A.L. Tafuri S.R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) recently reported that PPARγ mRNA levels are decreased upon exposure of cells to specific ligands; hence the loss of protein shown here could be a consequence of mRNA metabolism. To address this, we first performed time course studies of the amount of PPARγ protein and PPARγ mRNA in response to a PPARγ ligand. Total protein and RNA of differentiated adipocytes were prepared after 10 or 24 h of treatment with either pioglitazone or vehicle. Fig.2 A shows that, in agreement with the published reports, a 24-h treatment of adipocytes with a TZD down-regulated PPARγ mRNA and both bands of PPARγ protein. However, 10 h of pioglitazone treatment left PPARγ mRNA largely intact. In contrast, most of the unphosphorylated form of the PPARγ protein has disappeared by this time, whereas the phosphorylated form was barely affected. These data strongly suggest that PPARγ ligands have an effect on PPARγ protein that is separate from effects at the mRNA levels. To separate the effects of PPARγ ligands at transcriptional and post-translational levels more definitively, we expressed PPARγ ectopically with the SV-40 promoter, which is not subject to regulation by PPARγ ligands. Fibroblasts transiently transfected with the empty vector or with a PPARγ expression plasmid were treated for 24 h with pioglitazone and analyzed by Western and Northern blot. As can be seen in Fig. 2 B (compare lanes 1 and3), substantial PPARγ mRNA and protein could only be detected in cells receiving the expression vector for PPARγ. Northern blot analysis showed that the PPARγ mRNA is expressed at similar levels in the absence or presence of ligand (Fig. 2 B,lanes 3 and 4). However, following the treatment with ligand, the amount of nonphosphorylated PPARγ protein was reduced, whereas the amount of phosphorylated PPARγ was largely unaffected (Fig. 2 B, lanes 3 and 4), similar to what is described alone for endogenous PPARγ in adipocytes (see Fig. 1). Importantly, the protein levels of two other transcription factors, RXRα and CREB, were not affected by the treatment (Fig. 2 B). These data clearly demonstrate an effect of PPARγ ligands on PPARγ protein that is separable from effects at the mRNA level; in addition these results show that the decrease of PPARγ protein is not unique to adipocytes. To study the structural requirements for PPARγ down-regulation, we transfected wild-type PPARγ and various mutant alleles into NIH-3T3 cells (Fig.3 A). Although the experiments above indicate that the nonphosphorylated form of PPARγ is preferentially degraded, any conversion between phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms upon ligand binding would complicate these data. To clarify and simplify this issue, we used an allele of PPARγ with the serine 112 phosphorylation site converted to alanine (PPARγ2-S112A) (19.Hu E. Kim J.B. Sarraf P. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1996; 274: 2100-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). Transient transfections and subsequent treatment with pioglitazone revealed that both the wild-type PPARγ2 as well as PPARγ2-S112A were transcriptionally active under the conditions used (Fig. 3 B). Both were also subject to down-regulation (Fig.3 C). Phosphorylation of PPARγ2 on serine 112 is therefore not required for its down-regulation. Because ligand binding results in transcriptional activation, we next analyzed whether transcriptional activation of PPARγ is required for the ligand-dependent down-regulation. Two different point mutants were used to address this question: PPARγ2-ΔDNA, a double point mutant in the DNA binding region that can bind ligand but is unable to bind to DNA (2.Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3098) Google Scholar), and PPARγ2-E499Q, a mutant in the AF2 domain of the receptor. The latter also binds to PPARγ ligands with comparable affinity as the wild-type receptor (data not shown). Both of these mutants showed no ligand-dependent transcriptional activation (Fig. 3 B). Upon ligand exposure, PPARγ-ΔDNA was subject to normal ligand-dependent degradation, whereas the levels of PPARγ-E499Q did not change (Fig. 3 C). These data indicate that transcriptional activation of the receptor per se is not a prerequisite for ligand-induced down-regulation. However, an intact AF2 domain is required, suggesting that a ligand-dependent conformational change of the AF2 region and/or docking of cofactors to the AF2 region is important for the down-regulation. Proteins known to associate with the AF2 region of nuclear hormone receptors are coactivators and some corepressors. We therefore investigated whether coexpression of a ligand-dependent coactivator (SRC-1) or corepressor (RIP140) would influence the degradation of PPARγ. Although most corepressors bind to nuclear hormone receptors in a nonligand-dependent way, RIP140 is unusual in that it is a corepressor whose association through the AF2-domain is stimulated by ligand binding. As shown in Fig.3 D, down-regulation in the presence of SRC-1 occurs rather normally. In contrast, RIP140 completely blocked degradation of PPARγ. These results illustrate that protein down-regulation is not linked simply to ligand binding but is closely associated with a transcriptionally active conformation of the AF2 domain of the receptor. Two different ways of interfering with the activity of the AF2 region but not ligand binding, mutation in the AF2-domain or binding of RIP140, prevent protein down-regulation. We next addressed the mechanisms by which PPARγ is degraded. Because the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway regulates the stability of many proteins, including transc"

Here we report that both TNF and IL-1 activate the anti-apoptotic protein kinase Akt in growth factor and serum-deprived EC, assessed by Western blotting for phospho-Akt. Phosphorylation of Akt is blocked by LY294002 or wortmannin, inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). Consistent with these biochemical observations, TNF and IL-1 reduce apoptosis caused by growth factor and serum deprivation, and this action is also blocked by LY294002. Although Akt has been reported to activate NFκB, LY294002 does not prevent TNF- or IL-1-induced degradation of IκBα, β, or ε, transcription of NFκB-dependent E-selectin or ICAM-1 promoter-reporter genes, or surface expression of E-selectin or ICAM-1 in human EC. LY294002 potentiates the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and stress-activated protein kinases by TNF and IL-1, suggesting Akt inhibits these responses. We conclude that TNF and IL-1 activate a PI 3-kinase/Akt anti-apoptotic pathway and that the anti-apoptotic effects of Akt are independent of NFκB. Moreover, the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway does not play a major role in the pro-inflammatory responses of EC to TNF or IL-1. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-1 (IL-1) activate the transcription of both anti-apoptotic and pro-inflammatory gene products in human endothelial cells (EC) via NFκB.

Meyers R.E. Cantley L.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 481-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar). Growth factor binding causes autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues located within the intracellular portion of the receptor polypeptide. One or more of these phosphorylated tyrosine residues then serves as a binding site for the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain of the p85 regulatory subunit (2.Klippel A. Escobedo J.A. Fantl W.J. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1451-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). An increase in catalytic activity of PI 3-kinase results from a combination of this docking of PI 3-kinase in the proximity of the plasma membrane, where its lipid substrate is located, plus allosteric regulation of p110 activity by the receptor-bound p85 subunit. Activated p110 catalyzes the phosphorylation of membrane phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate in the D3 position to generate phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (3.Carpenter C.L. Cantley L.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate and its phospholipid phosphatase product, phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate, accumulate in the membrane, creating docking sites for two lipid-binding protein kinases, namely phosphatidylinositol-dependent kinase 1 and protein kinase B (more commonly known as Akt) which bind to these lipids via their pleckstrin homology domains (4.Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Toker A. Science. 1997; 275: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar, 5.Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 261-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Akt becomes fully activated as a result of this plasma membrane localization and by its phosphorylation on both Thr308 and Ser473. These phosphorylation events are catalyzed by phosphatidylinositol dependent kinase 1 and an unidentified but provisionally named phosphatidylinositol-dependent kinase 2, respectively (5.Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 261-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Once activated, Akt can inhibit apoptosis by a number of actions including phosphorylation and inactivation of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 homolog Bad (6.Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H.

The mitogenic response of growth factors is typically mediated by a distinct intracellular pathway involving a kinase cascade resulting in the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). Stimulation of this MAPK cascade by growth factors is initiated by recruitment of the adapter protein Grb2 via its SH2 domain either directly to the receptor (10.Lowenstein E.J. Daly R.J. Batzer A.G.

Bos J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1575-1581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Grb2 also contains a SH3 domain that recruits the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Sos to the receptor complex (14.Egan S.E. Giddings B.W. Brooks M.W. Buday L. Sizeland A.M. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1993; 363: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). Receptor-bound Sos catalyzes the activation of Ras by facilitating GDP/GTP exchange, and GTP·Ras binds to and activates the serine-threonine protein kinase Raf. Activated Raf phosphorylates MEK-1 (15.Kyriakis J.M. App H. Zhang X.F. Banerjee P. Brautigan D.L. Rapp U.R. Avruch J. Nature. 1992; 358: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar) which in turn phosphorylates extracellular receptor-activated kinase-1 and -2 (Erk-1 and -2) (16.Nakielny S. Cohen P. Wu J. Sturgill T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2123-2129Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), prototypic MAPKs implicated in cell cycle entry (17.Lavoie J.N. L'Allemain G. Brunet A. Muller R. Pouyssegur J. J.

Certain inhibitors of PI 3-kinase block activation of Erk, suggesting a regulatory role for the PI 3-kinase pathway in the MAPK cascade (19.Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Vandenheede J.R. McDowell H.E.

Cytokines such as TNF and IL-1 play an important role in a different set of cellular responses from those triggered by growth factors, namely activation of inflammatory functions and, in the case of TNF, initiation of apoptosis. The pro-apoptotic activity of TNF is mediated by the autocatalytic activation of caspase 8 by a ligand-receptor complex involving the type 1 TNF receptor (TNFR1) and the adapter proteins TNF receptor-associated death domain protein (TRADD) and Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD) (25.Boldin M.P. Goncharov T.M. Goltsev Y.V. Wallach D. Cell. 1996; 85: 803-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2096) Google Scholar, 26.Hsu H. Shu H.B. Pan M.G. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1719) Google Scholar). Most untransformed cell types are not susceptible to killing by TNF unless mRNA or protein synthesis is blocked. This observation is largely attributed to the capacity of TNF to initiate NFκB-dependent synthesis of anti-apoptotic gene products such as the signal inhibitor A20 (27.Opipari Jr., A.W. Hu H.M. Yabkowitz R. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12424-12427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the Bcl-2 homolog A1 (28.Karsan A. Yee E. Harlan J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27201-27204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Direct evidence for the role of NFκB as an inhibitor of TNF-mediated apoptosis has been observed in transfected cells (29.Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2499) Google Scholar, 30.Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2437) Google Scholar, 31.Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2919) Google Scholar) and is strongly supported by the observation that mice lacking the p65 subunit of NFκB die in utero unless they are crossed with TNF knockout animals (32.Doi T.S. Marino M.W. Takahashi T. Yoshida T. Sakakura T. Old L.J. Obata Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2994-2999Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The initial steps in the major pathway utilized by TNF to activate NFκB are fairly well understood. NFκB activation is usually initiated by the interaction of TNF with TNFR1 (also called p55), one of two distinct surface receptors, the other being TNFR2 (also called p75) (reviewed in Ref. 33.Tartaglia L.A. Goeddel D.V. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 151-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). Ligand-induced clustering of TNFR1 leads to the recruitment of TRADD (but not FADD) to the intracellular portion of the receptor (34.Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 81: 495-504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1721) Google Scholar). Receptor-bound TRADD recruits both the protein kinase designated receptor-interacting protein (RIP) and the ring/zinc finger protein TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) (26.Hsu H. Shu H.B. Pan M.G. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1719) Google Scholar, 35.Hsu H. Huang J. Shu H.B. Baichwal V. Goeddel D.V. Immunity. 1996; 4: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar). These two adapter proteins lead to the activation of NFκB as well as the activation of the stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs) such as c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPK. IL-1 also activates NFκB and SAPKs using a similar pathway initiated by ligand binding to the type 1 IL-1 receptor (IL-1R1) and involving adapter proteins MyD88, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK), and TRAF6 (36.Wesche H. Henzel W.J. Shillinglaw W. Li S. Cao Z. Immunity. 1997; 7: 837-847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar, 37.Cao Z. Xiong J. Takeuchi M. Kurama T. Goeddel D.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). The precise connection between RIP·TRAF2 or IRAK·TRAF6 complexes and NFκB are less well established but are thought to involve the MAPK kinase kinase family members MEKK-1 or NFκB-inducing kinase (NIK) (38.Lee F.S. Hagler J. Chen Z.J. Maniatis T. Cell. 1997; 88: 213-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 39.Karin M. Delhase M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9067-9069Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Both of these protein kinases can directly phosphorylate and activate IκB kinase (IKK) (39.Karin M. Delhase M. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Cell. 1998; 93: 1231-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). IKK-1 and IKK-2 phosphorylate members of the IκB family (i.e. IκBα, -β, -ε) which share a common mechanism for regulation of NFκB. In the resting cell, IκB proteins bind to and mask the nuclear localization sequence of NFκB resulting in the retention of the transcription factor in the cytosol (47.Verma I.M. Stevenson J.K. Schwarz E.M. Van Antwerp D. Miyamoto S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2723-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (1648) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of IκB by IKK targets this protein for rapid ubiquitination and degradation by the proteosome. This process releases NFκB which then translocates to the nucleus and induces transcription (48.Miyamoto S. Maki M. Schmitt M.J. Hatanaka M. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12740-12744Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 49.Traenckner E.B. Wilk S. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5433-5441Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). MEKK-1, but not NIK, catalyzes the phosphorylation and activation of yet other MAPK kinases (e.g. MEK-2, -4, -6, and -7) and is probably responsible for the parallel activation of SAPKs (50.Lin A. Minden A. Martinetto H. Claret F.X. Lange-Carter C. Mercurio F. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1995; 268: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Recently, an alternative signaling pathway has been described in some cells in which Akt directly phosphorylates IKK leading to the activation of NFκB, independent of MEKK-1 and NIK (51.Ozes O.N. Mayo L.D. Gustin J.A. Pfeffer S.R. Pfeffer L.M. Donner D.B. Nature. 1999; 401: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1866) Google Scholar, 52.Romashkova J.A. Makarov S.S. Nature. 1999; 401: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar). This pathway thus allows growth factors such as PDGF to activate NFκB (52.Romashkova J.A. Makarov S.S. Nature. 1999; 401: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar). Moreover, TNF and IL-1 have been found to activate the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway (51.Ozes O.N. Mayo L.D. Gustin J.A. Pfeffer S.R.

Chem. 1999; 274: 12722-12729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), potentially providing an alternative pathway for TNF and IL-1 to activate NFκB that is independent of NIK or MEKK-1 (51.Ozes O.N. Mayo L.D. Gustin J.A. Pfeffer S.R. Pfeffer L.M. Donner D.B. Nature. 1999; 401: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1866) Google Scholar). The importance of this alternative NFκB pathway compared with the previously described TRADD/RIP/TRAF2 or MyD88/IRAK/TRAF6 cytokine signaling pathways is unknown and may vary with the cell type. TNF and IL-1 also activate MAPK (57.Saklatvala J. Dean J. Finch A. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1999; 64: 63-77PubMed Google Scholar), but this pathway is even less well defined. Furthermore, TNF and IL-1 are typically anti-mitogenic in EC (58.Stolpen A.H. Guinan E.C. Fiers W. Pober J.S. Am. J. Pathol. 1986; 123: 16-24PubMed Google Scholar), despite their stimulation of MAPK activity. Vascular endothelial cells (EC) are a highly relevant cell type in which to assess the significance of inflammatory cytokine-activated PI 3-kinase/Akt, NFκB, and MAPK pathways. These cells are among the principal physiological targets of the pro-inflammatory actions of TNF and IL-1. Specifically, the activation of NFκB and SAPKs by TNF or IL-1 results in de novo transcription of leukocyte-binding adhesion molecules such as E-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) (59.Collins T. Read M.A. Neish A.S. Whitley M.Z. Thanos D. Maniatis T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 899-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (1554) Google Scholar). Cytokine-induced expression of these adhesion molecules is essential for the development of inflammatory reactions (60.DeLisser H.M. Albelda S.M. Am. J. Respir. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1998; 19: 533-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In the present study we have confirmed that TNF and IL-1 stimulate the phosphorylation of Akt in cultured human EC, and we have shown that a pharmacological inhibitor of PI 3-kinase, LY294002, completely abrogates this response. This same agent blocks the anti-apoptotic effects of these cytokines that are revealed by conditions of serum and growth factor withdrawal. However, LY294002 has no measurable effect on cytokine-mediated IκB degradation or on NFκB activation. LY294002 treatment fails to inhibit MAPK and JNK responses and actually potentiates MAPK and JNK activation by TNF and IL-1, consistent with a negative regulatory role for Akt in these pathways. Furthermore, LY294002 has little effect on adhesion molecule expression. Collectively, these data suggest that the Akt pathway is functionally activated by TNF or IL-1 in human EC but that it is not a major mediator of pro-inflammatory functions. They also establish that the Akt pathway mediates anti-apoptotic actions of TNF (and IL-1) that are independent of NFκB.

All experiments were performed using EC at passage 3 or 4. Such cultured EC uniformly display CD31 and von Willebrand factor and are free of CD45+ contaminating leukocytes. Recombinant human TNF and IL-1β were purchased from Peprotech Inc (Rocky Hill, NJ). LY294002 and wortmannin were purchased from Calbiochem. R32W TNF mutein protein, which selectively binds TNFR1, was a gift from W. Fiers (State University of Ghent, Ghent, Belgium), and D143N-A145R TNF mutein, which exclusively binds TNFR2, was a gift from Drs. Werner Lesslauer and H. Loetscher (Hoffmann-La Roche). Propidium iodide was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Rabbit anti-human IκBα, IκBβ, and IκBε antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit anti-human antibodies to total and to specific phospho forms of Akt, c-Jun, and p40/p42 MAPK were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for Western blotting were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). For FACS analysis, mouse anti-human E-selectin (H4/18), ICAM-1 (2D5, a gift from Dario Altieri, Yale University, New Haven, CT), and VCAM-1 (E1/6, a gift from Michael Bevilacqua, Amgen, Boulder, CO) were used as ascites fluids diluted before use. Fluorescein 5-isothiocyanate-conjugated α-mouse IgG(H+L), F(ab′)2 was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. All other reagents were purchased from Bio-Rad or Sigma. For all immunoblots, each well of a 6-well plate containing a confluent human umbilical vein EC monolayer, treated as described in the text, was washed twice in ice-cold PBS and then lysed by the addition of 100 μl of lysis buffer (50 mmTris·Cl, pH 6.8, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100) containing Pefablock (1 mm), aprotinin (10 μg/ml), pepstatin (1 μg/ml), leupeptin (10 μg/ml), NaF (10 mm), Na3VO4 (1 mm), and β-glycerophosphate (1 mm) for 20 min on ice. Lysates were harvested by scraping. DNA in the samples was sheared by passing the lysate through a 0.5-cc syringe fitted with a 28.5-gauge needle 2–3 times. For each sample, an equal amount of protein (20 μg) was size-fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (61.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) and then transferred electrophoretically to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon P, Millipore, Milford, MA) and immunoblotted with primary and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Detection of the bound antibody by enhanced chemiluminescence was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). EC grown to confluence on 12-well plates were subject to partial FCS reduction (to 0.5%) and complete growth factor withdrawal for 18 h. After this treatment floating EC were collected and pooled with substrate attached EC harvested by trypsin (Life Technologies Inc.) treatment. The pooled EC were washed once in PBS and fixed by resuspension in 70% ethanol for 15 min. After fixation, EC were washed once more in PBS before incubation in PBS containing propidium iodide (50 μg/ml) and RNase A (1 mg/ml) for 0.25–2 h. DNA content of EC was then determined by FACS analysis (FACSort, Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Indirect immunofluorescence was used to quantify the surface amount of adhesion molecules E-selectin, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1. EC were made quiescent by reduction of FCS to 0.5% and removal of growth factor overnight. After this treatment, EC were maintained a further 3 h in the same medium containing vehicle or LY294002 (10 μm) prior to the addition of cytokine for an additional 6 h. After experimental manipulation EC were harvested by trypsin treatment (which does not reduce E-selectin, ICAM-1, or VCAM-1 expression) and washed in PBS containing 1% FCS before incubation for 30 min at 4 °C with saturating amounts of anti-adhesion molecule monoclonal antibody or non-binding control monoclonal antibody (K16/16) as described previously (62.Slowik M.R. De Luca L.G. Fiers W. Pober J.S. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 143: 1724-1730PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were washed 3 times before the addition of fluorescein 5-isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody and incubation for a further 30 min at 4 °C. Labeled cells were washed a further 3 times, fixed in paraformaldehyde (2%), and analyzed by FACS (FACSort, Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Transient transfection of EC was performed using a DEAE-dextran protocol. In brief, each well of a 6-well plate containing a subconfluent culture was transfected with 2.2 μg of DNA including 2 μg of an E-selectin (−578 to +30) or ICAM-1 (−339 to −30)-firefly luciferase promoter reporter (as described previously (63.Karmann K. Min W. Fanslow W.C. Pober J.S. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 64.Min W. Pober J.S. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 3508-3518PubMed Google Scholar)) and 0.2 μg of β-actinRenilla luciferase (a gift from S. Ghosh, Yale University). Twenty four hours after transfection, EC were made quiescent overnight as described above and then pretreated with vehicle or LY294002 (10 μm) for 3 h prior to the addition of TNF or IL-1 (10 ng/ml) for a further 6 h. After experimental manipulation, EC were lysed with passive lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI), and triplicate lysates were analyzed for both firefly and Renillaluciferase activity using a Promega Dual-luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI) and Berthold (Schwarzwald, Germany) model luminometer according to the manufacturers' instructions. Activity of the adhesion molecule promoter-reporter constructs was normalized to the activity of the β-actin Renilla reporter that was not significantly altered by cytokines. Cultured human umbilical vein EC are routinely cultured in the presence of 20% FCS and 50 μg/ml ECGF (also designated FGF-1). Consequently, the MAPK and PI 3-kinase pathways are normally activated in these cultured cells. To assess the effects of inflammatory cytokines or growth factor on these pathways, cultured EC were first made “quiescent” by withdrawal of growth factor and reduction of serum to 0.5% overnight prior to treatment. Under these conditions, TNF and IL-1 each stimulated the phosphorylation of Akt as assessed by Western blot analysis of total Akt and of the phosphorylated form of this kinase (Fig.1). Phosphorylation of Akt was maximal following 30–45 min of treatment with either TNF or IL-1 (10 ng/ml) (Fig. 1). The phosphorylation of Akt observed in response to IL-1 was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner (EC50 ≈1 μm) following pretreatment with LY294002 (0–30 μm) (Fig. 2). Similar inhibition of the response to TNF with LY294002 was observed (not shown). Complete inhibition of both cytokines was achieved following pretreatment with 10 μm LY294002, and this concentration was therefore used in all further experiments. Over a 45-min incubation, stimulation of EC with TNF or IL-1 (0–100 ng/ml) increased the phosphorylation of Akt in a dose-dependent manner, although the TNF response was diminished above 10 ng/ml. At all cytokine concentrations, the phosphorylation of Akt was completely blocked by pretreatment with LY294002 (10 μm) (Fig.3).Figure 2Dose-dependent inhibition of Akt phosphorylation by LY294002. Quiescent EC were pretreated with vehicle ± LY294002 (0–30 μm) for 3 h prior to stimulation with IL-1 (10 ng/ml) for 45 min. Cell lysates were analyzed for Akt activation by Western blot analysis of total and phosphorylated Akt using specific antibodies. Results are derived from densitometry from a single experiment with IL-1 and are similar to results from one other experiment.View Large Image"

In this study we demonstrate that PGC-1 is a coactivator of estrogen receptor-α (ERα)-dependent transcriptional activity. However the mechanism by which PGC-1 interacts with ERα is different from that of PPARγ. Specifically, it was determined that the carboxyl terminus of PGC-1 interacts in a ligand-independent manner with the ERα hinge domain. In addition, an LXXLL motif within the amino terminus of PGC-1 was shown to interact in an agonist-dependent manner with the AF2 domain within the carboxyl terminus of ERα. The ability of PGC-1 to associate with and potentiate the transcriptional activity of an ERα-AF2 mutant that is unable to interact with the p160 class of coactivators suggests that this coactivator may have a unique role in estrogen signaling. It is concluded from these studies that PGC-1 is a bona fideERα coactivator, which may serve as a convergence point between PPARγ and ERα signaling.

In addition, estrogen exhibits biological actions in bone, the cardiovascular system, and the central nervous system (1.Love R.R. Mazess R.B. Barden H.S. Epstein S. Newcomb P.A. Jordan V.C. Carbone P.P. DeMets D.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1992; 326: 852-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar, 2.Migliaccio S. Davis V.L. Gibson M.K. Gray T.K. Korach K.S. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 2617-2624Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In these target organs the biological action(s) of estrogen are manifest through either one of two specific, high affinity, estrogen receptors (ERα or ERβ)1 located within target cells (3.Kuiper G.G.J.M. Enmark E. Pelto-Huikko M. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J.-A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5925-5930Crossref PubMed Scopus (4224) Google Scholar, 4.Mosselman S. Polman J. Dijkema R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (2054) Google Scholar). Given the similarity in the structure of these two ER subtypes, it is likely that they share a similar mechanism of action; however, most studies thus far have focused on defining the ERα signal transduction pathway. These studies have revealed that the apo-receptor resides in the nucleus of target cells in an inactive form associated with a large inhibitory heat-shock protein complex (5.Smith D.F. Sullivan W.P. Marion T.N. Zaitsu K. Madden B. McCormick D.J. Toft D.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 869-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Upon binding ligand, the receptor undergoes a conformational change, an event that leads to the displacement of heat-shock proteins, receptor dimerization, and subsequent interaction of ERα with specific estrogen response elements (EREs) located within the regulatory regions of target genes (6.Beekman J.M. Allan G.F. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1266-1274PubMed Google Scholar, 7.McDonnell D.P. Nawaz Z. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 1986; 46: 1053-1061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Depending on the cell and promoter context, the DNA-bound receptor can exert either a positive or negative effect on target gene transcription (9.Beato M. Sánchez-Pacheco A. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 587-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Although the precise mechanism by which ERα modulates target gene transcription remains to be determined, significant insights in this regard have come from studies that probed the molecular pharmacology of different ERα-ligands (10.Wijayaratne A.L Nagel S.C. Paige L.A. Christensen D.J. Norris J.D. Fowlkes D.M. McDonnell D.P. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 5828-5840Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Notable was the finding that the biological activity of the same compound can differ between cell types, indicating that ERα does not function in an identical manner in all contexts (10.Wijayaratne A.L Nagel S.C.

For example, the drug tamoxifen has been shown to function as an antiestrogen in most ERα-positive breast cancer cells where it opposes the mitogenic activity of estradiol (13.Parker M.G. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1993; 26: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In other tissues, such as the uterus and the cardiovascular system, this compound exhibits estrogenic activity (1.Love R.R. Mazess R.B. Barden H.S. Epstein S. Newcomb P.A. Jordan V.C. Carbone P.P. DeMets D.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1992; 326: 852-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar, 14.Kedar R.P. Bourne T.H. Powles T.J. Collins W.P. Ashley S.E. Cosgrove D.O. Cambell S.

Med. 1991; 115: 860-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). The molecular basis underlying the distinct activities of estrogen and tamoxifen became apparent from crystallography studies, which demonstrated that ERα bound to estradiol and tamoxifen assumes different conformations (16.Shiau A.K. Barstad D. Loria P.M. Cheng L. Kushner P.J. Agard D.A. Greene G.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 927-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2255) Google Scholar). Specifically, it was determined that the structural changes, which occur in the ligand binding domain of ERα when it is bound to estradiol, but not tamoxifen, facilitated the interaction of this receptor with cellular adaptors or coactivators, i.e.proteins that link ERα to the general transcriptional machinery (17.Chen J.D. Li H. Crit. Rev. Eukaryot. Gene Expr. 1998; 8: 169-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar,18.Horwitz K.B. Jackson T.A. Bain D.L. Richer J.K. Takimoto G.S. Tung L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1167-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). The best studied of these factors are SRC-1, GRIP-1, and AIB-1, which are members of the p160 superfamily of coactivators (19.Cavaillès V. Dauvois S. L'Horset F. Lopez G. Hoare S. Kushner P.J.

The ability of these coactivators, when overexpressed in cells, to potentiate the transcriptional activity of estradiol-activated ERα confirmed the functional significance of these interactions (20.Onate S.A.

The p160 coactivators exhibit a relatively ubiquitous tissue distribution pattern, making it unlikely that they play a major role in determining the tissue-selective actions of different ERα-ligand complexes. However, the recent identification of factors, other than those of the p160 class, that interact with ERα and that are expressed in a tissue-selective manner adds to the complexity of estrogen action. One of these factors, PGC-1, was originally identified as a transcriptional coactivator of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) (26.Puigserver P. Wuu Z. Park C.W. Graves R. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1998; 92: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3086) Google Scholar), and it was determined that PGC-1 also interacts with ERα in vitro, although its role as a coactivator of ERα has not yet been established. It has been shown previously that PGC-1 plays a role in adaptive thermogenesis where, among many activities, it enhances the ability of PPARγ and nuclear respiratory factors (NRF-1 and NRF-2) to induce the synthesis of the enzymes required for oxidative metabolism (27.Wu Z. Piugserver P. Anderson U. Zhang C. Adelmant G. Mootha V. Troy A. Cinti S. Lowell B. Scarpulla R.C. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1999; 98: 115-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3192) Google Scholar). Commensurately, PGC-1 has been shown to be expressed and highly regulated in brown adipose tissue and skeletal muscle in rodents (26.Puigserver P. Wuu Z. Park C.W. Graves R. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1998; 92: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3086) Google Scholar). In addition, PGC-1 is expressed in the heart, kidney, and brain, suggesting that it is involved in processes other than thermogenesis (26.Puigserver P. Wuu Z. Park C.W. Graves R. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1998; 92: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3086) Google Scholar). Given that ERα target cells also exist in the brain, heart, and kidney, we were intrigued by the possibility that PGC-1 may function as an ERα coactivator. If PGC-1 could serve as such a coactivator, it might provide a point of convergence between PPARγ- and ERα-regulated signaling pathways (28.Couse J.F. Korach K.S. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 358-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Restriction and modification enzymes were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Glutathione-Sepharose 4B was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The TNT T7 coupled reticulocyte lysate system was obtained from Promega. QuickChange™ kits were purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). 17β-Estradiol and 4-hydroxytamoxifen were obtained from Sigma. A vector expressing the ER-LL mutant was generated using oligo-directed mutagenesis as described previously (29.Norris J.D. Fan D. McDonnell D.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1605-1616Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The ER-AF-1 and ER 282-stop mutants were generated as described (12.Tzukerman M.T. Esty A. Santiso-Mere D. Danielian P. Parker M.G. Stein R.B. Pike J.W. McDonnell D.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar, 30.Pham T.A. Hwung Y.-P. Santiso-Mere D. McDonnell D.P. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1043-1050PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. The ER 253-stop mutant was generated by introducing a stop codon (indicated by underscoring) into the ER open reading frame using pRST7ER as template and the following primers: forward, 5′-GTGGGAATGATGAAATGAGGGATACGAAAAGACC-3′; reverse, 5′-GGTCTTTTCGTATCCCTCATTTCATCATTCCCAC-3′. The procedure was carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol (QuickChange, Stratagene). Deletion mutants in ERα that lack the hinge region, Δ30-ER and Δ30-ER-LL, were generated using a two-step polymerase chain reaction (PCR) procedure. In a first step we generated two fragments using pRST7 as a template. One fragment was generated using a pair of primers: forward (pRST7F), 5′-CGAGGTCGACGGTATCGATAAGC-3′; reverse (Δ30H-R), 5′-GTCTCCAGCTTTCATCATTCCCACTTCG-3′. The second fragment was generated using primers: forward (Δ30H-F), 5′-GGAATGATGAAAGCTGGAGACATGAGACCTGA-3′; reverse (351-R), 5′-CCCCATCGATTTAGTCTGCCAGGTTGGTCAGTAAG-3′. Primers Δ30H-F and Δ30H-R lack sequences encoding residues 253–282 of ERα but anneal to sequences adjacent to the region at both ends. In a second step of PCR we used oligos pRST7F and 351R (see above) and a mixture of fragments at equimolar amounts from the first PCR step as a template. The final PCR product was digested with NotI andHindIII restriction enzymes and subcloned into theNotI and HindIII sites of pRST7 ER or pRST7-ER-LL. All products from PCR-based cloning were sequenced to ensure the fidelity of the resulting constructs. The construction and derivation of PGC1A-pSV-Sport, GST-PGC1, GST-PGC 1–170, GST-PGC 1–400, GST-PGC 604–797, and GST-PGC-1 1–191 L142A has been described previously (26.Puigserver P. Wuu Z. Park C.W. Graves R. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1998; 92: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3086) Google Scholar). The GST-PGC 1–670 expression vector was created by excising the MfeI/NotI fragment from GST-PGC-1, filling the protruding ends with T4 DNA polymerase, and religating. The GST-PGC 1–588 expression vector was created by excising the PpuMI-NotI fragment GST-PGC-1, filling the protruding ends with T4 DNA polymerase, and religating. The resulting constructs were confirmed by restriction analysis. The PGCLALA mutant was created from PGC1A-pSV-Sport using site-directed mutagenesis (QuickChange) using the following primers: 5′-GCCGTCTCTAGCAAAGAAGGCAGCACTGGCACCAGC-3′; 5′-GCTGGTGCCAGTGCTGCCTTCTTTGCTAGAGACGGC-3′. The AflII/BglII fragment of mutagenized PGC cDNA was subcloned into the AflII/BglII restriction sites of the original expression plasmid. The presence of point mutations in the LXXLL motif in the resulting construct was confirmed by sequencing. Human cervical cancer (HeLa) and hepatoma (HepG2) cells were cultured in minimum essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Life Technologies, Inc.) and maintained in a humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2. For transient transfections, cells were seeded into 24-well plates 24 h prior to transfection. For HepG2 cells, plates were coated with gelatin by incubating plates with 0.1% gelatin for 30 min at 4 °C. Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.)-mediated transfection has been described in detail previously (31.Norris J. Fan D. Aleman C. Marks J.R. Futreal P.A. Wiseman R.W. Iglehart J.D. Deininger P.L. McDonnell D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22777-22782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). A DNA/Lipofectin mixture, containing a total of 3000 ng of plasmid DNA per triplicate of sample, was incubated with cells for 4–5 h. Typically, 125 ng of receptor, 250 ng of reporter plasmid, 2500 ng of PGCpSV-Sport or pSV-Sport, as a control, and 125 ng of normalization plasmid were used in each transfection. Receptor ligands were added 14–16 h before luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured (31.Norris J. Fan D. Aleman C. Marks J.R. Futreal P.A. Wiseman R.W. Iglehart J.D. Deininger P.L. McDonnell D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22777-22782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). [35S]Methionine-labeled ERα or ERα mutants were synthesized using a TNT-coupled in vitrotranscription/translation system. The resultant radiolabeled proteins were incubated with GST-PGC1, or its mutants, immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads in binding buffer (50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5) for 14–16 h at 4 °C, washed three times with a buffer composed of 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5. Proteins were eluted by boiling the beads in Laemmli loading buffer and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) followed by autoradiography. We examined the ability of PGC-1, and a series of PGC-1 mutants, to interact with ERα using in vitro pulldown assays. The results of these analyses are shown in Fig.1. Full length PGC-1 binds to ERα in the absence of ligand (Fig. 1 B). This interaction is enhanced significantly by addition of the agonist 17β-estradiol (E2), whereas addition of the antagonist tamoxifen has no impact on binding (Fig. 1 B). By assessing the interaction of ERα with fragments of PGC-1 we were able to define one domain whose interaction with the receptor was ligand-dependent and a second that bound in a ligand-independent manner. Specifically, we observed that polypeptides encoding either the amino-terminal 400 or 170 amino acids bound efficiently to E2-activated ERα, but not to apo-ERα or that complexed with tamoxifen. The most carboxyl-terminal peptide studied (residues 604–797) interacted with ERα in a ligand-independent manner. Fragments of PGC-1 encoding amino acids 1–588 or 1–670 bound ERα in the absence of ligand; however, their interaction was enhanced by the addition of E2 (Fig.1 B). Cumulatively, these data suggest that there are two major contact sites for ERα within PGC-1: a hormone-dependent binding site located between residues 1 and 170 and a hormone-independent binding site located within the carboxyl-terminal half of PGC-1. The PGC-1 fragment 1–170 interacts with ERα in an agonist-dependent manner (Fig. 1 B). This fragment contains an LXXLL sequence (residues 142–146), a motif that has been shown to mediate ligand-dependent recruitment of the p160-type of coactivators to nuclear receptors (32.Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1772) Google Scholar). Mutation of the conserved leucines within the p160 LXXLL motifs has been shown to disrupt these interactions (23.Voegel J.J. Heine M.J.S. Tini M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 507-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 32.Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G.

Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4513-4522Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). We tested whether the LXXLL motif present within PGC-1 is required for the hormone-dependent binding of the amino-terminal fragment of PGC-1 to ERα. Using an in vitro GST pulldown assay we were able to demonstrate that a PGC-1 fragment (PGCLA), harboring an L142A mutation, was unable to bind to ERα in the presence or absence of E2 (Fig. 2). These data suggest that the LXXLL motif is required for the ligand-dependent component of the ERα/PGC-1 interaction. To define the region(s) within ERα that bind PGC-1, we performed a series of in vitro binding assays using either full length ERα, a mutant lacking the AF2 domain (ER-351), or mutants lacking either part or all of the hinge region of ERα (ER-282 and ER-253) (Fig. 3 A). These studies revealed that the ER-351 mutant, which contains an intact hinge domain, but lacks the AF2 domain, binds PGC-1 (Fig. 3 B). The ER-282 fragment also binds to PGC-1 in a ligand-independent manner; however, it does not bind as well as ER-351 or ERα-wild type. The ERα fragment 1–253, lacking the entire hinge region, does not interact with PGC-1. These data indicate that the hinge region of ERα between amino acids 253 and 283 mediates the ligand-independent component of the ERα/PGC-1 interaction. We confirmed the importance of this domain by deleting residues 253–282 in the full-length receptor (ER-Δ30) and showing that this mutant protein did not exhibit constitutive ERα binding. However, as expected, ER-Δ30 was able to bind PGC-1 when tested in the presence of E2 (Fig. 3 C). Many nuclear receptor coactivators have been shown to use LXXLL to mediate the interaction with the AF2 domain of ERα. The demonstration that a fragment of PGC-1, which contains an LXXLL motif, was also able to interact with ERα in a ligand-dependent manner suggests that the AF2 domain of ERα may be responsible for this protein-protein interaction. This hypothesis was tested by assessing the ability of PGC-1 to interact with an ERα mutant in which the AF2 domain was disrupted (Fig.4 A). Mutation of the hydrophobic residues in the ERα AF2 domain (ER-LL) abolishes the ligand-induced activation function and prevents the interaction of the LXXLL-containing coactivators with ERα (34.Norris J.D. Paige L.A. Christensen D.J. Chang C.-Y. Huacani M.R. Fan D. Hamilton P.T. Fowlkes D.M. McDonnell D.P. Science. 1999; 285: 744-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 35.Chang C.Y. Norris J.D. Gron H. Paige L.A. Hamilton P.T. Kenan D.J. Fowlkes D. McDonnel D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8226-8239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We evaluated the ability of PGC-1 to interact with ER-LL and observed that the ligand-dependent, but not ligand-independent, component of the ERα/PGC-1 interaction was abrogated (Fig. 4 B). Mutation of the three charged amino acid residues (D538, E542, D545 → N538, Q542, N545) in helix 12 of the AF2 domain (ER-3X) leads to the loss of ERα transcriptional activity in some, but not all, cell contexts (12.Tzukerman M.T.

Parker M.G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1025-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). This mutation abrogates recruitment of p160-type coactivators such as GRIP-1 and SRC-1 but not RIP-140 (19.Cavaillès V. Dauvois S. L'Horset F. Lopez G. Hoare S. Kushner P.J. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3741-3751Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar, 25.Norris J.D. Fan D. Stallcup M.R. McDonnell D.P. J. Biol.

Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 657-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Although these coactivators all interact with ERα through their LXXLL motifs, it is clear that not all LXXLL motifs interact with ERα in the same manner (35.Chang C.Y. Norris J.D. Gron H. Paige L.A. Hamilton P.T. Kenan D.J. Fowlkes D. McDonnel D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8226-8239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the LXXLL motif and the surrounding amino acids in PGC-1 resemble those in RIP-140, we determined whether or not PGC-1 is capable of interacting with the ERα mutant (ER-3X). The results of these experiments are shown in Fig. 4 B and demonstrate that full length PGC-1 and the ER-3X mutant interact and that their association is enhanced by the addition of E2. Thus, PGC-1, through the LXXLL motif, interacts with the AF2 domain of ERα in a manner that is different from that of the p160-type of coactivators. A double mutant in which the hinge region and AF2 domains have been disrupted (ERΔ30/LL) is unable to bind PGC-1 in either the presence or absence of E2 (Fig. 4 B). This result confirms the importance of both the AF2 domain and the hinge region in mediating the interaction of ERα with PGC-1 and indicates that, if other binding sites on ERα are involved in this interaction, they do not contribute in a significant manner. We conclude that the ERα/PGC-1 interaction differs from that of PPARγ/PGC-1 and, unlike the latter, is enhanced by the addition of the hormone. The functional significance of the ERα/PGC-1 interactions were next evaluated using estrogen-responsive transcription systems reconstituted in heterologous cells. Initially, the ability of PGC-1 to potentiate the transcriptional activity of wtERα was assessed in HeLa cells (Fig. 5). In this cell line, ERα functioned as an estradiol-dependent transactivator when assayed on a TATA promoter containing either one (1XERE) or three (3XERE) copies of a canonical ERE. However, when PGC-1 was coexpressed in these cells, ER-dependent transcriptional activity was significantly elevated. Thus, for the first time we demonstrate that PGC-1 is capable of activating ER-dependent transcriptional activity and therefore is a bona fide coactivator of ERα. Interestingly, the partial agonist activity of tamoxifen was not affected by PGC-1 overexpression. To determine the functional significance of ERα/PGC-1 contact sites we have identified, we next evaluated the impact of PGC-1 on the transcriptional activity of ERα mutants. When compared with wtERα, the transcriptional activity of ER-LL, ERΔ30, ER-3X, and the double mutant ERΔ30/LL were greatly reduced, re-affirming the importance of both the AF2 and the hinge regions in ERα action. The transcriptional activity of the mutant ER-LL, which contains an intact hinge domain and which interacts with PGC-1 in vitro, is not potentiated by PGC-1 overexpression. Thus, although PGC-1 interacts well with the hinge domain of ERαin vitro, this interaction alone is not sufficient for coactivation. In contrast, deletion of the PGC-1 binding site within the hinge region of ERα (ERΔ30) reduces, but does not eliminate, the ability of this coactivator to potentiate ERα-mediated transcriptional activity. Indeed, in PGC-1-expressing cells, wtERα and ERΔ30 displayed similar transcriptional activity when assayed using the 3XERE-reporter vector. Thus, although PGC-1 can bind to both the hinge and AF2 domains, it appears that, with respect to function, the contact mediated by the AF2 domain is the most important for the transcriptional activation. This conclusion is consistent with the observation that an intact AF2 domain is important for ERα/coactivator interactions. The recent solution of the co-crystal structure of the ERα-ligand binding domain with a fragment of the coactivator GRIP-1 provides a universal model with which to explain ERα/coactivator interactions (16.Shiau A.K. Barstad D. Loria P.M. Cheng L. Kushner P.J. Agard D.A. Greene G.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 927-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2255) Google Scholar). The interaction between GRIP-1 and ERα could be abrogated by mutating the charged amino acid residues in the AF2 domain (ER-3X). Therefore, it was surprising that PGC-1 can function as a very efficient coactivator of the ER-3X mutant (Fig. 5). However, this observation is consistent with our in vitrodata, which indicate that PGC-1 can in fact bind directly to ER-3X (Fig. 4), an ERα mutant that is unable to interact with the p160 class of coactivators (25.Norris J.D. Fan D. Stallcup M.R. McDonnell D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6679-6688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Thus, although AF2 mediates the functional interaction between ERα and PGC-1, it appears that the interaction of PGC-1 with the AF2 domain of ER is different from that of most known p160-type coactivators. The potential significance of this finding, which distinguishes PGC-1 from other known coactivators, prompted us to examine the ability of PGC-1 to potentiate ERα action in other cell and promoter contexts. Previously, we and others have demonstrated that the two functional domains of ERα (AF1 and AF2), function in a cooperative manner in most cell and promoter contexts (12.Tzukerman M.T. Esty A.

EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1981-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). However, in some environments it appeared that AF1 alone was sufficient for ERα-mediated transcriptional activity (39.Berry M. Metzger D. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2811-2818Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). The most compelling data in support of this hypothesis came from studies that showed that the transcriptional activity of ERα mutated in AF2 was affected differentially by cell and promoter context. For instance, we demonstrated previously that the ERα mutant, ER-3X, was inactive in most cells, attesting to the importance of AF2 (12.Tzukerman M.T. Esty A. Santiso-Mere D. Danielian"

We have investigated whether BSP and OPN may play a similar role in tumor cell complement evasion by testing to see whether these glycoproteins could promote tumor cell survival. Recombinant OPN and BSP can protect murine erythroleukemia cells from attack by human complement as well as human MCF-7 breast cancer cells and U-266 myeloma cells from attack by guinea pig complement. The mechanism of this gain of function by tumor cell expression of BSP or OPN has been defined using specific peptides and antibodies to block BSP and OPN protective activity. The expression of BSP and OPN in tumor cells provides a selective advantage for survival via initial binding to αVβ3 integrin (both) or CD44 (OPN) on the cell surface, followed by sequestration of Factor H to the cell surface and inhibition of complement-mediated cell lysis.

BSP is a phosphoprotein of molecular mass ∼70–80 kDa, about half of which is sialic acid richN- and O-linked carbohydrates, and also contains several glutamic acid-rich domains, tyrosine sulfates, as well as an integrin-binding arginine-glycine-aspartate (RGD) domain (12.Fisher L.W.

During normal human development, BSP is produced by cells of the skeleton (osteoblasts, osteoclasts, osteocytes, and hypertrophic chondrocytes) as well as trophoblasts (2.Bianco P. Fisher L.W. Young M.F. Termine J.D. Robey P.G. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1991; 49: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Because of its primary association with cells that produce a mineralized extracellular matrix, BSP has been hypothesized to play a role in mineralization where its high degree of negative charge could function in calcium sequestration or in hydroxyapatite crystal nucleation. However, the absence of a clear skeletal phenotype in the BSP knock-out mouse suggests either the existence of molecular redundancy or another as yet undefined functional role for BSP. Because of its apparent restricted expression pattern in trophoblasts and skeletal cells, BSP expression in tumors has been proposed to play a role in either microcalcification (15.Castronovo V.

The second protein, OPN, is also known as Secreted PhosphoProtein I, 2ar, early T-lymphocyte activation 1, and transformation-associated phosphoprotein.

Nitrocellulose membranes were rinsed with Tris-buffered saline (0.05m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl) containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-Tween).

Aliquots of normal human serum diluted 1:100 in immunoprecipitation buffer (0.1 m Tris, pH 7.2, 0.15 m NaCl, .05% Tween 20, and 1% aprotinin) were incubated sequentially with 0.1 ml each of (a) Protein G-agarose (Kirkegaard & Perry); (b) normal rabbit serum IgGs bound to Protein G-agarose; (c) rabbit anti-BSP antibodies bound to Protein G-agarose. Each incubation for 1 h at 4 °C was terminated by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 5 min and the supernatant taken to the next immunoprecipitation. The first two incubations removed proteins binding nonspecifically to agarose and to normal rabbit serum. The anti-BSP incubation immunoprecipitate was dissolved in gel sample buffer and analyzed by 4–20% gradient SDS-PAGE. Adenoviral constructs were generated by subcloning BSP (13.Fisher L.W. McBride O.W. Termine J.D. Young M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2347-2351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), BSP-KAE or OPN (28.Young M.F. Kerr J.M. Termine J.D. Wewer U.M. Wang M.G. McBride O.W. Fisher L.W. Genomics. 1990; 7: 491-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) cDNA into high expression, replication-deficient adenovirus (Ad5) using EF-1 (BSP) and CMV (BSP-KAE, OPN) promoters, respectively. The RGD→KAE constructs were made using in situ mutagenesis and the entire insert checked for fidelity. Adenoviruses were plaque-selected and propagated on HEK 293 cells (ATCC number CRL1573). Cells were harvested when cytopathic effects were present and lysed by 5 freeze-thaw cycles. Cellular debris was removed and viral particles were purified by twice banding on CsCl. After dialysis in Tris/MgCl2/glycerol buffer at 4 °C, viruses were aliquoted and frozen at −70 °C. Evaluation of viral titers was carried out by plaque formation of virus dilutions on HEK293 cells (29.Becker T.C. Noel R.J. Coats W.S. Gomez-Foix A.M. Alam T. Gerard R.D. Newgard C.B. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 161-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Typically ∼2–4 × 1011 plaque forming units/ml were obtained from one viral preparation. Recombinant proteins were generated by infecting subconfluent normal human marrow stromal fibroblasts with 10,000 plaque forming units/cell. Cells were maintained in α-MEM, 20% fetal bovine serum, and 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Medium was changed to serum-free conditions after 48 h. Subsequently, medium was collected every 24 h and frozen at −70 °C. Aliquots were assayed by SDS-gel electrophoresis and Western blot for BSP and OPN expression. Expression was found to be at highest levels at ∼168 h post-infection. The proteins were purified by routine column chromatography. Native BSP, BSP-KAE, and OPN proteins were purified by diluting medium from normal human marrow stromal fibroblast cells 1:1 with 40 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and loading directly on a 5.0 × 2.0-cm column packed with ToyoPearl TSK QAE resin. A linear salt gradient to 2.0 m NaCl was employed to purify the BSP and OPN to ∼95% purity as measured by SDS-PAGE. 12 μg of recombinant human BSP was dissolved in 50 μl of PBS. 2 μl of a fresh 1 mg/ml solution of NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce) was added and the reaction incubated at room temperature for 45 min. The unreacted biotin was removed by repeated washing with TBS-Tween and centrifugation in a Microcon 30 (Amicon, Beverly, MA). A final volume of 50 μl was retained. Murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells (a gift of Dr. Marilyn Farquhar, University of California, San Diego, CA) grown in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 4 mm glutamine were rinsed three times with gelatin veronal buffer with Mg2+ and EGTA (GVB-MgEGTA, Sigma). Cells were resuspended in GVB-MgEGTA at a density of 5 × 106 cells/ml and incubated at 37 °C with different concentrations of normal human serum diluted in GVB-MgEGTA. After 2 h, cells were harvested for trypan blue exclusion assay by removing a 50-μl aliquot, incubating for 15 min in 0.4% trypan blue, and counting viable cells under an inverted microscope. The thiazolium blue assay was carried out at identical serum dilutions by incubating a 50-μl aliquot of the cell suspension in an equal volume of 1 mg/ml thiazolyl blue (MTT) for 45 min. Cell viability was determined spectrophotometrically by absorbance at 560 nm. Cells in GVB-MgEGTA buffer were preincubated with 10 μg of either rBSP or rOPN in 1 ml for 10 min at 37 °C. Normal human serum collected for good complement activity was then added at a dilution of 1:10 and the cells returned to 37 °C for 2 h and cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion and MTT assays. For the assay of human cancer cell lines, loosely adherent MCF-7 cells were selected for by sequential growth in EMEM with 2 mml-glutamine and Earle's balanced salt solution adjusted to contain 1.5 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 0.1 mmnon-essential amino acids, and 1.0 mm sodium pyruvate and 10% fetal bovine serum, while U-266 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 15% fetal bovine serum. Cells were collected by centrifugation and rinsed three times with GVB-MgEGTA buffer and subsequently treated exactly as for MEL cells, substituting guinea pig serum (Sigma) for human serum. The status of BSP in human serum was studied using a number of well defined polyclonal antibodies against short peptides (26.Fisher L.W. Stubbs 3rd, J.T. Young M.F. Acta Orthop. Scand. Suppl. 1995; 266: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar) and recombinant fragments that span the BSP molecule (30.Stubbs 3rd, J.T. Mintz K.P. Eanes E.D. Torchia D.A. Fisher L.W. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 1210-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Initially, we adapted an existing competitive ELISA for bone matrix-derived BSP (31.Vetter U. Fisher L.W. Mintz K.P. Kopp J.B. Tuross N. Termine J.D. Robey P.G. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1991; 6: 501-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) to determine levels of BSP in human serum, but were unable to detect any BSP. However, when 25-μl aliquots of normal human serum diluted 1:100 were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to nitrocellulose and probing with a peptide-derived antibody against BSP, immunoreactive bands were readily apparent (Fig.1 A). Curiously, in the absence of reducing agent, the BSP immunoreactive band migrated with an estimated molecular mass of 250 kDa, while with reduction a migration position that corresponded authentic BSP (molecular mass ∼80 kDa) was evident. BSP contains no cytseine residues hence the shift with reduction suggested that BSP in serum was tightly bound to another serum component. BSP possesses a high degree of negative charge (pI < 4.0), therefore strong anion exchange HPLC was first employed to isolate the BSP complex. BSP from serum did not, however, bind to QAE resin unless it was previously subject to both heating and reduction (Fig.1 B). Immunoprecipitation was then used to further characterize the BSP complex in serum using six different polyclonal antibodies that span the BSP molecule. When the immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE resolution followed by Western blotting and detection of the BSP with a monoclonal antibody, only certain antibodies were able to immunoprecipitate BSP and even the best could precipitate only a small fraction of the total BSP in the serum. Immunoprecipitates generated by antibodies directed toward the carboxyl-terminal RGD-containing region of the molecule completely failed to immunoprecipitate BSP (Fig. 1, C andD). Taken together these results indicate that BSP is present in serum as a high molecular weight complex, which masks its negative charge, and that the RGD domain is not surface accessible. To identify the complex constituents, unreduced normal human serum was fractionated by size exclusion chromatography (SEC). The majority of immunoreactive BSP eluted as a single peak (Fig. 2,arrow). When aliquots of fractions from the SEC were transferred to 96-well microtiter plates and analyzed by direct ELISA for BSP, two peaks were apparent. Compared with protein standards, the BSP peak eluted at an estimated molecular mass of 250 ± 30 kDa. Analysis of the same elution profile using preimmune serum in place of anti-BSP polyclonal antibody in the direct ELISA yielded a single peak eluting in the excluded volume of the column, suggesting that immunoreactive material in the void of the anti-BSP profiles represents nonspecific immunoreactivity. Purified rBSP was found to elute as a single peak with a calculated molecular mass of 80 kDa. SEC resolution of a separate aliquot of the same normal human serum that had been incubated with reducing agent and heat to dissociate the binding complex yielded an immunoreactive profile upon direct ELISA analysis was identical to authentic BSP with a mass of 80 kDa. The requirement of heating and reduction to disrupt the binding complex suggests that the BSP-binding serum component(s) possess multiple disulfide bonds and a stable structure. Subtracting the mass of BSP from the complex yields a mass estimate of 180 kDa for the other binding component(s). These observations taken together with the high content of sialic acid in BSP suggested complement Factor H as a potential binding complex constituent. Unreduced normal human serum was fractionated by SEC and subjected to Western blotting and detection with a monoclonal antibody against human complement Factor H. Immunoreactive bands were apparent in fractions corresponding to the elution position of the BSP complex (Fig.3). The association of BSP with complement Factor H was further investigated by reconstitution of the complex from purified components. Normal human serum incubated with biotinylated-rBSP yielded avidin-HRP immunoreactive and anti-BSP immunoreactive peaks whose elution position corresponded to that of the serum-BSP complex (Fig.4). No free rBSP was measurable by either antibody detection system. Incubation of biotinylated-rBSP with purified human complement Factor H also yielded a SEC profile where a single peak corresponding to that of serum-BSP complex was detected by avidin-HRP. Treatment of reconstituted rBSP-Factor H complex with reducing agent and heat lead to a shift in the BSP immunoreactive peak to that of free BSP. Thus, complement Factor H has been identified as a BSP-binding protein by immunoprecipitation, Western blotting, and immunoassay. Factor H, a molecular mass 150-kDa protein, is a key regulatory braking mechanism in normal and alternate complement-mediated cell lysis. It dissociates and thereby inactivates the assembled C3 convertase, serves as an essential accelerator of Factor I-mediated cleavage of C3b to iC3b, and sterically inhibits C5 binding to C3b (a prerequisite step for terminal pathway activation). The salient structural features of Factor H include 20 short consensus repeats that contain four cysteine residues forming two disulfide bonds per repeat. In addition, each short consensus repeat contains one conserved tryptophan residue per repeat and Factor H is known to interact with several sialic acid-containing proteins. BSP lacks any tryptophan, OPN has one, while Factor H contains a total of 25 tryptophan residues. Thus, the binding interaction between BSP or OPN and Factor H can be readily studied by intrinsic steady state fluorescence. Titration of purified human complement Factor H with rBSP or rOPN was followed by excitation at 295 nm and monitoring emission between 300 and 450 nm. The emission profile of Factor H alone yields a peak at 347 nm (Fig. 5). The addition of rBSP or rOPN in nanomolar increments causes a relative fluorescent intensity quenching. Conversion of the fluorescent intensity titration into a binding curve by determining the fraction of binding sites occupied as the fractional change in fluorescence quenching at 347 nm yields a saturable binding curves (Fig.5 C). By steady state fluorescence, the binding of BSP and OPN by Factor H are saturable and possess a 1:1 stoichiometry, have binding constants in the nanomolar range, given the serum concentration of Factor H (∼0.5 mg/ml), virtually all BSP and OPN in serum will be complexed with Factor H. Besides its key role in regulating complement and alternate complement activity, Factor H also appears to play a role when “hijacked” by invading organisms in enabling cellular evasion of complement.

We have investigated whether BSP and OPN may play a similar role in tumor cell complement evasion by testing to see whether these small integrin-binding glycoproteins could promote tumor cell survival. Having identified the serum-binding component for BSP and OPN and bearing in mind the role of hijacked Factor H in pathogenic resistance to humoral surveillance, the ability of BSP and OPN to protect cells from complement activity was investigated. The first model system employed was a MEL cell line which when incubated with normal human serum can be readily assayed for ACP-mediated cell lysis (46.Shi W.X. Chammas R. Varki N.M. Powell L.

Through high capacity screening followed by chemical optimization, we identified a novel non-peptide CCR1 antagonist, R-N-[5-chloro-2-[2-[4-[(4-fluorophenyl)methyl]-2-methyl-1-piperazinyl ]-2-oxoethoxy]phenyl]urea hydrochloric acid salt (BX 471). Competition binding studies revealed that BX 471 was able to displace the CCR1 ligands macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha), RANTES, and monocyte chemotactic protein-3 (MCP-3) with high affinity (K(i) ranged from 1 nm to 5.5 nm). BX 471 was a potent functional antagonist based on its ability to inhibit a number of CCR1-mediated effects including Ca(2+) mobilization, increase in extracellular acidification rate, CD11b expression, and leukocyte migration. BX 471 demonstrated a greater than 10,000-fold selectivity for CCR1 compared with 28 G-protein-coupled receptors. Pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that BX 471 was orally active with a bioavailability of 60% in dogs. Furthermore, BX 471 effectively reduces disease in a rat experimental allergic encephalomyelitis model of multiple sclerosis. This study is the first to demonstrate that a non-peptide chemokine receptor antagonist is efficacious in an animal model of an autoimmune disease. In summary, we have identified a potent, selective, and orally available CCR1 antagonist that may be useful in the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases."

https://openalex.org/W2064330033,"A family of four putative transporters (Arn1p–4p) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is expressed under conditions of iron deprivation and is regulated by Aft1p, the major iron-dependent transcription factor in yeast. One of these, Arn3p/Sit1p, facilitates the uptake of ferrioxamine B, a siderophore of the hydroxamate class. Here we report that ARN family members facilitated the uptake of iron from the trihydroxamate siderophores ferrichrome, ferrichrome A, and triacetylfusarinine C. Uptake of siderophore-bound iron was dependent on either the high-affinity ferrous iron transport system or the ARNfamily of transporters. The specificity of each siderophore for individual transporters was determined. Uptake of ferrichrome and ferrichrome A was facilitated by both Arn1p and Arn3p. Uptake of triacetylfusarinine C was facilitated by Arn2p, although small amounts of uptake also occurred through Arn1p and Arn3p. In contrast to the trihydroxamates, uptake of iron from the dihydroxamate rhodotorulic acid occurred only via the high-affinity ferrous iron system. Epitope-tagged Arn1p was expressed in intracellular vesicles in a pattern that was indistinguishable from that of Arn3p, whereas Ftr1p, a component of the high-affinity ferrous system, was expressed on the plasma membrane. These data indicate that S. cerevisiaemaintains two systems of siderophore uptake, only one of which is located on the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2084421367,"β-Catenin is a member of the Armadillo repeat protein family with a dual cellular function as a component of both the adherens junction complex and the Wnt/wingless signaling pathway. Here we show that β-catenin is proteolytically cleaved during anoikis and staurosporine-induced apoptosis. Cleavage of β-catenin was found to be caspase-dependent. Five cleavage products of β-catenin were identified in vivo and after in vitrocleavage by caspase-3. Amino acid sequencing and mass spectrometry analysis indicated two caspase-3 cleavage sites at the C terminus and three further sites at the N terminus, whereas the central Armadillo repeat region remained unaffected. All β-catenin cleavage products were still able to associate with E-cadherin and α-catenin and were found to be enriched in the cytoplasm. Functional analysis revealed that β-catenin deletion constructs resembling the observed proteolytic fragments show a strongly reduced transcription activation potential when analyzed in gene reporter assays. We therefore conclude that an important role of the β-catenin cleavage during apoptosis is the removal of its transcription activation domains to prevent its transcription activation potential. β-Catenin is a member of the Armadillo repeat protein family with a dual cellular function as a component of both the adherens junction complex and the Wnt/wingless signaling pathway.

Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (2788) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the biological role of anoikis is to restrict inappropriate cell growth after the loss of matrix attachment (4.Ruoslahti E. Reed J.C. Cell. 1994; 77: 477-478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). Different signaling pathways are involved in this process. Thus, it was shown that integrin signaling is necessary for survival and growth of epithelial cells and prevents anoikis (3.Re F. Zanetti A. Sironi M. Polentarutti N. Lanfrancone L. Dejana E.

Thornberry N.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2187) Google Scholar). Caspases recognize tetrapeptide motifs and cleave their substrates behind aspartate. A growing number of caspase-3 substrates has been identified, including the focal adhesion kinase, which is involved in cell matrix adhesion via integrins (15.Crouch D.H. Fincham V.J. Frame M.C.

Kwiatkowski D.J. Williams L.T. Science. 1997; 278: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar). Disruption of cell-cell contacts may also play a role in anoikis, as expression of a dominant negative N-cadherin in the mouse intestinal epithelium was shown to disturb cell-cell adhesion and subsequently led to an increased number of apoptotic cells (25.Hermiston M.L. Gordon J.I. Science. 1995; 270: 1203-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar, 26.Hermiston M.L. Gordon J.I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 489-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Cell-cell adhesion is predominantly mediated by the cadherintype of transmembrane proteins, generating a homophilic interaction within two cells. During recent years further cytoplasmic proteins were isolated as part of the cadherin cell-cell adhesion complex linking the cadherins to the actin cytoskeleton, thus termed catenins. Three major catenins are known, α-catenin, β-catenin, and γ-catenin (plakoglobin). β-Catenin and γ-catenin directly bind to the cadherin in a mutually exclusive manner, whereas α-catenin binds to β-catenin or γ-catenin and additionally makes a direct or indirect contact to the actin cytoskeleton (27.Geiger B. Yehuda-Levenberg S. Bershadsky A.D. Acta Anat. 1995; 154: 46-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 28.Kemler R. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 317-321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). β-Catenin belongs to the Armadillo repeat protein family, containing 13 Armadillo repeat motifs that seem to be involved mainly in protein-protein interaction. β-Catenin shows dual cellular function, being involved in cell-cell adhesion and Wnt signaling. Upon Wnt signaling β-catenin becomes stabilized in the cytoplasm and subsequently translocates into the nucleus where it is involved in the expression of specific target genes such asXtwn, Xnr3, siamois, c-myc,cyclin D1, c-jun, and fra-1 (29.Laurent M.N.

The cleavage was inhibited by the caspase-3 family specific peptide inhibitor Z-DEVD-fmk demonstrating that caspase-3 is the major protease involved in this process. The determination of the exact cleavage sites revealed that β-catenin is exclusively cleaved in the N- and C-terminal regions at multiple positions, whereas the central core region was not affected. Consistently, an interaction of all cleavage products was detected in the E-cadherin-α-catenin complex but additionally to a high extent in the cytoplasm not associated with E-cadherin. β-Catenin deletion constructs resembling the apoptotic cleavage products of β-catenin showed a strongly reduced transactivation potential in reporter gene assays. The human breast epithelial cell line H184A1 was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium Ham's F12 (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 10 μg/ml transferrin (Life Technologies, Inc.), 10 μg/ml insulin (Biochrom), and 1.8 μg/ml hydrocortisol (Sigma). Madine-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK), the human breast carcinoma cell line MCF-7.3.28 (stably transfected with a caspase-3 expressing plasmid), MCF-7/vector (39.Jänicke R.U. Sprengart M.L.

Apoptosis was induced by maintaining cells in suspension as follows. Cells were grown to confluency and harvested by trypsination. Approximately 1 × 107 cells were transferred to 175-cm2 culture flasks coated with 1% poly(2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate) (Sigma) to keep them in suspension as described (1.Frisch S.M. Francis H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (2788) Google Scholar). After different times suspended cells were harvested and washed twice with PBS. Cell pellets were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C for further analysis. Alternatively, apoptosis was induced by incubating 80% confluent cells in medium containing 1 μm staurosporine for up to 20 h. The percentage of apoptotic cells was determined with APO-BRDUTM kit (Pharmingen, Hamburg, Germany) by nick-end 5-bromo-2′deoxyuridine triphosphate labeling of single- and double-strand DNA breaks with 5-bromo-2′deoxyuridine triphosphate by terminal transferase. Incorporation of the nucleotide analog was detected with FITC-conjugated antibodies and measured by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis (FACSort Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany). Monoclonal anti-β-catenin (clone 571–781), anti-α-catenin and anti-E-cadherin antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany). Monoclonal anti-hemagglutinin antibody was purchased from His (Freiburg, Germany), monoclonal anti-caspase-3 antibody from Pharmingen, polyclonal anti-caspase-6 and -7 antibodies from Santa Cruz (Heidelberg, Germany). Recombinant caspases-3 and -6 were purchased from Pharmingen, recombinant caspase-7 was kindly provided by R. Beyaert (40.Beyaert R. Kidd V.J. Cornelis S. Van de Craen M. Denecker G. Lahti J.M.

Z-DEVD-fmk was purchased from Calbiochem (Bad Soden, Germany) and staurosporine and poly(2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate) were purchased from Sigma. Tropix Dual-Light chemiluminescence kit was purchased from Perkin Elmer (Weiterstadt, Germany). Immunoblotting was essentially done as described previously (41.Rickers A. Brockstedt E. Mapara M.Y. Otto A. Dörken B. Bommert K. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 296-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In short, cells were lysed by boiling in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, and 30–50 μg protein was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). Primary antibodies were diluted 1:1000, anti-β-catenin (clone 571–781) was diluted 1:3000, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibody (Promega, Mannheim, Germany) was diluted 1:10,000. Proteins were visualized using the ECL-system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunoprecipitation was done as described (42.Behrens J. Mareel M.M. van Roy F.M. Birchmeier W. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 2435-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). In short, 3 × 106 cells were harvested, and proteins were extracted in lysis buffer (140 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 0.7 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin) on ice. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g, the supernatant was collected as the detergent soluble fraction. The detergent insoluble fraction was washed twice with lysis buffer and solubilized by boiling in SDS sample buffer. Appropriate antibodies and protein A-Sepharose were added to the supernatant. Precipitates were washed with 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-100. Western blot analysis was performed with monoclonal anti-β-catenin antibody (clone 571–781), anti-α-catenin, and anti-E-cadherin antibody. Western blots were quantified by using the NIH Image program version 1.59 (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). His-tagged β-catenin was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity by nickel-chelate chromatography (38.Behrens J. von, Kties J.P. Kuhl M. Bruhn L. Wedlich D. Grosschedl R. Birchmeier W. Nature. 1996; 382: 638-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (2605) Google Scholar). Cleavage reactions with recombinant caspase-3, -6, or -7 were performed in 20 μl of caspase-buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1% CHAPS, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μm leupeptin, 200 μg/ml aprotinin) at 37 °C for 2–4 h using 0.5 μg of affinity-purified recombinant 6His-β-catenin as a substrate. To identify caspase-3 cleavage sites within β-catenin, 5 μg of recombinant β-catenin was digested with 100 ng of recombinant caspase-3. Cleavage products were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (ProBlott, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using a semi-dry blotting apparatus (Bio-Rad) and 100 mmCAPS, 10% methanol as blotting buffer. Proteins transferred to the membrane were stained with Coomassie Blue R-250 (Serva, Heidelberg, Germany) for 1 min. Coomassie Blue-stained protein bands were excised, soaked in 60% acetonitrile for destaining, and analyzed by Edman sequencing. Edman sequencing was performed on a Procise sequencer (Applied Biosystems). The two C-terminal β-catenin fragments were identified by chromatography of in vitro cleavage products using high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Smart System, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) on a C4 reversed-phase column (2.1 mm inner diameter, 300 Å, 5 μm) obtained from Vydac (Hesperia, CA). Collected fractions were screened for the C-terminal fragment by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry (VG Tof Spec, Fisons, Manchester, UK). The sequences of the C-terminal fragments were obtained by electrospray ionization-MS/MS using a Q-Tof (Micromass, Manchester, UK) equipped with a nanoelectrospray ion source. A recombinant glutathione S-transferase-tagged cytoplasmic domain of mouse E-cadherin (kindly provided by O. Huber, Berlin) was adsorbed on glutathione S-transferase-agarose beads. Approximately 5 μg of GST-E-cadherin was used for the affinity precipitation of β-catenin as described (43.Bauer A. Lickert H. Kemler R. Stappert J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28314-28321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). β-Catenin FL (bp 215–2557), ΔC1 (bp 215–2506), ΔC2 (bp 215–2467), ΔN (bp 560–2557), ΔNΔC1 (bp 560–2506), and ΔNΔC2 (bp 560–2467) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using a plasmid containing the full-length β-catenin sequence (pQE32β415) as template (38.Behrens J. von, Kties J.P. Kuhl M. Bruhn L. Wedlich D. Grosschedl R. Birchmeier W. Nature. 1996; 382: 638-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (2605) Google Scholar). 5′-Primers contained a NotI site and corresponding 3′-primers contained a XbaI site. The amplified fragments were cloned into pGEMTeasy (Promega), sequenced, excised byNotI/XbaI digestion, and inserted into the pGEMT-HAX vector containing the sequence for a triple hemagglutinin-tag at the 3′-end. For expression all constructs were excised withNotI and inserted into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA6 B (Invitrogen). Approximately 2 × 105HEK293 or H184A1 cells were transiently transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation method using 1 μg of luciferase reporter pS01234 or its negative control containing mutated TCF sites (pS) (31.Brannon M. Gomperts M. Sumoy L. Moon R.T. Kimelman D. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2359-2370Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar), 0.25 μg of hTCF-4 (44.Korinek V. Barker N. Morin P.J. van, Wichen D. de Weger R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Clevers H. Science. 1997; 275: 1784-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2950) Google Scholar), 0.5 μg of β-catenin constructs, and 1 μg of pCH110 β-galactosidase expression vector as internal control. 48 h after transfection cells were harvested and resuspended in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. Cell lysis was carried out by three cycles of freezing and thawing. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation, and luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured with a Tropix Dual Light Chemiluminescence kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity. To investigate if components of the cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion complex are impaired in apoptotic cells we analyzed the protein level of E-cadherin, α-catenin, and β-catenin in the human mammary epithelial cell line H184A1. Anoikis was induced as described under “Materials and Methods.” Western blot analysis revealed lower molecular mass cleavage products of β-catenin, whereas E-cadherin and α-catenin remained apparently unaffected. The different β-catenin cleavage products appeared in a time-dependent manner. Already 4 h after induction of anoikis, truncated β-catenin fragments were detectable at ∼90 (fragment A), 76 (fragment B), and 72 kDa (fragment C). A fourth 70-kDa cleavage product (fragment D) became visible after 8 h of induction (Fig. 1 A). An 85-kDa fragment (fragment E*) was already observed in uninduced cells, thus representing an apoptosis-unspecific β-catenin degradation product. The amounts of the three lower molecular mass polypeptides (fragments B, C, and D) increased during the time course of apoptosis in correlation with the increasing proportion of apoptotic cells as determined by terminal dUTP nick-end labeling assay. 24 h after induction 96% of the cells were found apoptotic (Fig. 1 B). The total amount of the β-catenin cleavage products was comparable to the amount of full-length (FL) β-catenin as determined by densitometric measurement of the band intensities (data not shown). Low levels of E-cadherin at time points 0 and 4 h were because of the trypsination process of anoikis induction (Fig.1 A). As caspase-3 family members have recently turned out to be important effector molecules in apoptosis, we tested whether β-catenin cleavage could be inhibited by incubating H184A1 cells with the irreversible caspase-3 family-specific inhibitor Z-DEVD-fmk. Cells incubated with 100 μm Z-DEVD-fmk and harvested 24 h after induction of anoikis were analyzed by Western blotting for β-catenin, and the rate of apoptosis was determined by terminal dUTP nick-end labeling assay. Appearance of β-catenin fragments B, C, and D was completely abolished by the inhibitor but not appearance of the apoptosis-unspecific degradation product (fragment E*) (Fig.1 C). The rate of apoptotic cells was reduced to control level (Fig. 1 D). To analyze if the apoptosis-induced, proteolytic cleavage of β-catenin is cell type-specific or was dependent on the apoptotic stimulus used, we further tested the β-catenin fragmentation in the epithelial MDCK cell line. Apoptosis was induced by cell detachment or by incubation with the protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine (STS), which was described as a potent inducer of the apoptotic program (45.Weil M. Jacobson M.D. Coles H.S. Davies T.J. Gordner R.L. Raff K.D. Raff M.C. J. Cell. Biol. 1996; 133: 1053-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Identical in vivo cleavage patterns of β-catenin were observed for both cell lines and for both apoptotic stimuli (Fig.2 A). A significant proportion of cells detached from the culture plate after staurosporine treatment. We thus analyzed the adherent and detached cell populations separately (Fig. 2 B). β-Catenin was almost entirely cleaved 20 h after STS treatment in the detached (suspension) cell population, whereas 35% of the full-length β-catenin remained in the adherent cell fraction. However, just 37% of the adherent cells compared with 89% of the detached cells were found apoptotic as determined by terminal dUTP nick-end labeling assay (data not shown). To identify the caspase that is directly involved in the cleavage of β-catenin, we digested recombinant His-β-catenin with recombinant caspase-3, -6, and -7 in vitro. β-Catenin was cleaved by all caspases, resulting in different cleavage products, and this could be blocked in each case by the addition of the caspase-specific inhibitor Z-DEVD-fmk (Fig.3 A). The apparent molecular masses of β-catenin fragments obtained after in vitrocleavage by caspase-3 and cleavage products from H184A1 cells treated with STS were identical (Fig. 3 A, C3 andSTS), indicating that caspase-3 might be the main caspase involved in cleavage of β-catenin in vivo. Western blot analysis of apoptotic H184A1 cell lysates for caspases-3, -6, and -7 with antibodies recognizing the activated enzymes showed that only caspase-3 was detectable in its activated form (data not shown). The involvement of caspase-3 in the cleavage of β-catenin was further supported by analysis of MCF-7 cells, which have been shown previously to be deficient in caspase-3 (39.Jänicke R.U. Sprengart M.L. Wati M.R. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9357-9360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1727) Google Scholar). After STS treatment the three main β-catenin cleavage products B, C, and D were detected only in MCF-7 cells stably transfected with caspase-3 (Fig. 3 B,Casp3) but not in control MCF-7 cells transfected with the vector alone (Vec). Two consensus motifs corresponding to a potential caspase-3/-7 cleavage site (DXX D) are found at positions Asp-764 and Asp-459 in the β-catenin amino acid sequence. Three further putative caspase-6 cleavage sites (XEX D) are present in the N-terminal region at positions Asp-11, Asp-17, and Asp-58 (46.Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia C.M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S. Vaillancourt J.P. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17907-17911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1852) Google Scholar). However, the calculated molecular masses of such putatively truncated β-catenin molecules did not correlate with the apparent molecular masses of the observed β-catenin cleavage products except for a potential cleavage at Asp-764. We analyzed apoptosis-induced cleavage products of β-catenin by Western blotting with antibodies directed against the N- and C-terminal domains of β-catenin, respectively. Both antibodies detected only full-length β-catenin but none of the degradation fragments (data not shown). Therefore, we presume that the N- and C-terminal regions of β-catenin were cleaved off and that the cleavage products were too small (<7.5 kDa) to be detected in our assay system. For identification of the cleavage sites we digested recombinant His-β-catenin with recombinant caspase-3 and sequenced the resulting β-catenin fragments A, B, C, D, and E by N-terminal Edman degradation (Fig. 4 A). Sequencing of fragment A revealed a complete, nontruncated N-terminal region of β-catenin indicating that cleavage had occurred at the C terminus. We identified the potential corresponding 1.8-kDa β-catenin cleavage product by HPLC separation. Analysis of this peptide by electrospray ionization-MS/MS revealed the sequence GLPPGDSNQLAWFDTDL, which corresponds to the amino acids 765–781 in the C terminus of β-catenin. The cleavage therefore had occurred at position Asp-764, a potential caspase-3 consensus sequence DLMD (Fig.4 B). The N-terminal cleavage sites for fragments B, C, and E were determined by Edman degradation, revealing cleavage at position Asp-32 (SYLD) for fragment E, Asp-83 (ADID) for fragment B, and Asp-115 (TQFD) for fragment C (Fig.4 B). Analysis of fragment D resulted in a sequence identical to the one obtained for fragment C, suggesting that β-catenin has a second C-terminal cleavage site. This inference was proven by identification of a corresponding 1.4-kDa peptide after HPLC separation and subsequent electrospray ionization-MS/MS sequencing. The resulting sequence GLPDLGHAQDLMD matched amino acids 752–764 of β-catenin, indicating that cleavage had occurred at Asp-751 (YPVD). The time course of β-catenin cleavage showed that, in vitro, β-catenin was first cleaved at the C terminus generating fragment A as the main cleavage product after 10 min followed by cleavage at the N terminus (fragments E, B, and C). Finally, β-catenin was further truncated at the second C-terminal cleavage site, resulting in the appearance of fragment D after 1 h (Fig.4 A). A β-catenin cleavage product of similar size as fragment E at about 85 kDa was already detectable under in vivo conditions. However, this fragment (E*) was already observed in uninduced cells and was found to be apoptosis-unspecific (Fig.1 A, 0 h). The appearance of this fragment was not blocked by caspase-specific inhibitors, revealing that it is not created in a caspase-dependent manner (Fig. 1 C). We thus conclude that fragments E and E* might be independent of each other and that the generation of fragment E under in vivoconditions is too small to be detecte"

Bokoch G.M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 857-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 2.Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 162-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). All PAK isoforms are direct effectors of the Rho family GTP-binding proteins Rac and Cdc42, suggesting that cell-specific responses arise from either selective regulation of G protein activation in response to unique agonists or selective phosphorylation of tissue-specific protein kinase substrates. In the initial studies of the relative roles of G protein activation and protein kinase activity in actin reorganization, Sells et al. (3.Sells M.A. Knaus U.G. Bagrodia S. Ambrose D.M. Bokoch G.M. Chernoff J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 202-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar) demonstrated that microinjection of activated PAK1 induced rapid formation of polarized filopodia in Swiss 3T3 cells. However, the relative importance of PAK-dependent phosphorylation of unique substrates during Cdc42/Rac-dependent cytoskeletal reorganization is incompletely understood. Transient transfection of HeLa cells with constitutively active PAK1 promoted cytoskeletal rearrangement, which was entirely analogous to that observed in Cdc42 and Rac transfected cells (4.Manser E. Huang H.-Y. Loo T.-H. Chen X.-Q. Dong J.-M. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1129-1143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In subsequent studies, a peptide that inhibited kinase activity in PAK blocked Cdc42, Rac, and constitutively active PAK-induced morphological changes in transfected HeLa cells (5.Zhao Z.-S. Manser E. Chen X.-Q. Chong C. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An important role for PAK-mediated phosphorylation in actin reorganization has also been supported by studies in permeabilized (6.Chew T.-L. Masaracchia R.A. Goeckeler Z.M. Wysolmerski R.B. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1998; 19: 839-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and intact (7.Zeng Q. Lagunoff D. Masaracchia R. Goeckeler Z. Cote G. Wysolmerski R. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 471-482Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) endothelial cells as well as skinned smooth muscle cells (8.Van Eyk J.E. Arrell D.K. Foster D.B. Strauss J.D. Heinonen T.Y.K.

Permeabilized endothelial cells incubated with Cdc42-activated PAK2 or the catalytic domain of PAK2 underwent ATP-dependent retraction and actin reorganization (6.Chew T.-L. Masaracchia R.A. Goeckeler Z.M. Wysolmerski R.B. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1998; 19: 839-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In addition, these studies using purified enzymes established that the regulatory nonmuscle and smooth muscle myosin II light chain is a substrate for PAK2 (9.Ramos E. Wysolmerski R.B. Masaracchia R.A. Recept. Signal Transduct. 1997; 7: 99-110PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Hassell T.C. Kemp B.E. Masaracchia R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Lagunoff D. Masaracchia R. Goeckeler Z. Cote G. Wysolmerski R. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 471-482Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that microinjection of constitutively active PAK2 into endothelial cells induced cell retraction and monophosphorylation of myosin II RLC. An increase in myosin light chain phosphorylation has also been shown by immunocytochemical staining in fibroblasts (11.Sells M.A. Boyd J.T. Chernoff J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 837-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) and microvascular endothelial cells (12.Kiosses W.B. Daniels R.H. Otey C. Bokoch G.M. Schwartz M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 831-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) transiently transfected with PAK1. In contrast to the Ca2+/CaM-dependent MLCK, which catalyzes phosphorylation of RLC at both Ser-19 and Thr-18 (13.Ikebe M. Hartshorne D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10027-10031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,14.Goeckeler Z.M. Wysolmerski R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 613-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar), PAK2 catalyzes only monophosphorylation of RLC (7.Zeng Q. Lagunoff D. Masaracchia R. Goeckeler Z. Cote G. Wysolmerski R. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 471-482Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) at Ser-19 (6.Chew T.-L. Masaracchia R.A. Goeckeler Z.M. Wysolmerski R.B. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1998; 19: 839-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). However, both PAK and MLCK phosphorylation of the RLC in intact nonmuscle myosin II activates the myosin ATPase (10.Hassell T.C. Kemp B.E. Masaracchia R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 134: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). These results in nonmuscle cells are supported by observations of Van Eyk et al. (8.Van Eyk J.E. Arrell D.K. Foster D.B. Strauss J.D. Heinonen T.Y.K. Furnamiak-Kazmierczak E. Côté G.P. Mak A.S. J. Biol.

Calcium-independent contraction of triton-skinned smooth muscle cells occurred in response to incubation with both PAK and Rho kinase. These investigators confirmed that PAK catalyzed monophosphorylation of RLC at Ser-19, but in the skinned muscle preparation, contraction was better correlated with caldesmon and desmin phosphorylation and not RLC phosphorylation. Furthermore, recent studies (15.Foster D.B. Shen L.-H. Kelly J. Thibault P. Van Eyk J.E. Mak A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1959-1965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) have shown a role for PAK1 in modulating Ca2+ sensitivity of smooth muscle contraction by phosphorylation of caldesmon. Sanders et al.(16.Sanders L.C. Matsumura F. Bokoch G.M. de Lanerolle P. Science. 1999; 283: 2083-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar) have reported that overexpression of Rac1 or constitutively active PAK1 results in inhibition of BHK-21 and HeLa cell spreading. These investigators present evidence that this effect is the result of a decrease in myosin RLC phosphorylation mediated by PAK1-catalyzed phosphorylation and down-regulation of MLCK. Collectively, these data strongly support a role for PAK-mediated protein phosphorylation in some cytoskeletal reorganization responses to Cdc42 and Rac. Studies presented in this report characterize PAK2-catalyzed phosphorylation of MLCK in vitro. To further investigate the potential role for PAK-mediated phosphorylation in regulating cell retraction, we have also determined the effect of activated PAK2 on RLC phosphorylation and isometric tension in endothelial cells. MLCK was phosphorylated by PAK2 (10:1 molar ratio MLCK:PAK2) in 50 μl of phosphorylation buffer (25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT) containing 125 μm [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C for 10 min unless otherwise indicated. The reactions were stopped by the addition of an equal volume of ice-cold 20% trichloroacetic acid. Trichloroacetic acid-precipitated proteins were washed in ice-cold acetone and resuspended in Laemmli SDS sample buffer for analysis by 7.5% or 10% SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. In the case of mutant MLCK bound to beads, the beads were washed twice in PBS and resuspended in 100 μl of phosphorylation buffer containing 125 μm[γ-32P]ATP. Phosphorylation reactions were initiated by addition of 100 nm PAK2 and incubated at 30 °C for 10 min. In experiments where MLCK was prephosphorylated by PAK2, PAK2 was removed from the reaction mixture by immunoprecipitation with a rabbit anti-PAK2 antibody preabsorbed to protein A beads. To determine the stoichiometry of phosphate incorporation into MLCK by PAK2, a 10:1 (mol/mol) ratio of purified recombinant MLCK:PAK2 was incubated in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity = 200–300 cpm) for 30 min at 30 °C. Aliquots of the reaction mixtures were spotted onto Whatman P-81 filter papers and analyzed as described previously (17.Dennis P.B. Masaracchia R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19833-19841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For analysis of RLC phosphorylation, endothelial cell populated collagen gels were snap-frozen, pulverized, and extracted with immunoprecipitation buffer (14.Goeckeler Z.M. Wysolmerski R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 613-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Undissolved collagen was spun down at 10,000 × g and myosin II immunoprecipitated as described previously (14.Goeckeler Z.M. Wysolmerski R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 613-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 18.Wysolmerski R.B. Lagunoff D. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: C32-C40Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For in vitro phosphorylation assays, endothelial cell myosin II was immunopurified as described previously (14.Goeckeler Z.M. Wysolmerski R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 613-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Myosin II was dissolved in urea sample buffer (19.Perrie W.T. Perry S.A. Biochem. J. 1970; 119: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar) and samples analyzed by glycerol-urea gel electrophoresis. Western blots were incubated using a rabbit anti-myosin II regulatory light chain antibody (6.Chew T.-L. Masaracchia R.A. Goeckeler Z.M. Wysolmerski R.B. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1998; 19: 839-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). RLC bands were visualized by ECL detection reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To determine the location of PAK2 phosphorylation sites, MLCK was phosphorylated by PAK2 at 30 °C for 30 min as outlined above. PAK2 was removed from the reaction mixture by applying the phosphorylated MLCK reaction mixture to a rabbit anti-PAK2 affinity column. Phosphorylated MLCK was precipitated by addition of an equal volume of 20% trichloroacetic acid, washed with 100% acetone, and air-dried. MLCK was denatured, reduced, and carboxymethylated prior to trypsin digestion. Urea (8m) dissolved in 0.4 mNH4HCO3 (50 μl) was added to 500 μg of air-dried MLCK and the pH adjusted to between 7.5 and 8.5. 5 mm DTT (5 μl) was added and the reaction mixture incubated at 50 °C for 15 min. After cooling, the MLCK was carboxymethylated by addition of 5 μl of 100 mmiodoacetamide and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. H2O was added to a final volume of 200 μl. TPCK-trypsin was added at a ratio of 1/25 enzyme to protein (w/w) and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The reaction was stopped by snap-freezing in liquid N2, and the sample was lyophilized. The trypsin digest was adjusted to 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and applied to a Bio-Rad RP Hi-Pore 318 column (250 × 10 mm) equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The column was washed for 10 min and developed with a gradient (120 ml at 1 ml/min) of 0–40% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Approximately 50% of the32PO4 was eluted at 8.8% acetonitrile (fraction 1) and 50% of the 32PO4 was eluted at 14.4% acetonitrile (fraction 2). Both fractions were rechromatographed on a Gilson SynChropak RP-P column (250 × 4.6 mm) equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Fraction I was eluted with a 0–24% acetonitrile gradient (60 ml at 1 ml/min).32PO4 was eluted at 7.2% acetonitrile. Fraction II was eluted with a 12–32% acetonitrile gradient (60 ml at 1 ml/min). 32PO4 was eluted at 16% acetonitrile. Fractions containing 32PO4 were pooled and dried to 100 μl in a vacuum centrifuge. Amino acid sequence was determined by Baylor College of Medicine Protein Chemistry Core Facility. Samples were covalently attached to Sequelon membranes; approximately 50% of the sample was used for32PO4 determination at each round. Site-specific mutants within the smooth muscle MLCK (20.Gallagher P.J. Herring B. Griffin S. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23936-23944Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were generated as described previously (21.Gallagher P.J. Stull J.T. Mol. Cell.

Mutant MLCK proteins with point mutations at residues Ser-439 (S439A), Ser-991 (S991A), Ser-992 (site A, S992A), Ser-1005 (site B, S1005A), or both Ser-991 and Ser-992 (S991A/S992A) and Ser-992 and Ser-1005 (S992A/S1005A) replaced with alanine, were subcloned into pCMV5 expression vector and expressed in rat embryo fibroblasts (REF-52) (21.Gallagher P.J. Stull J.T. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 173: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Briefly, REF-52 cells were grown and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 2 mmglutamine, 10% fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. REF-52 were plated onto 60-mm dishes at a density of 4 × 106 and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Cells were transfected with 5 μg of DNA containing vector alone (pCMV5) or MLCK constructs (pCMV5-MLCK constructs) using Superfect reagent for 3 h following the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen). REF-52 cells were harvested after 48 h and MLCK immunopurified as outlined below. PAK2 was purified from human placenta (17.Dennis P.B. Masaracchia R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19833-19841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and activated by Cdc42-GTP or limited trypsin proteolysis (6.Chew T.-L. Masaracchia R.A. Goeckeler Z.M. Wysolmerski R.B. J.

Chem. 1993; 268: 19833-19841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant constitutively active PAK2 was expressed inEscherichia coli and purified over Talon Metal Affinity resin (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). Recombinant MLCK was expressed in Sf-9 cells and purified as described (6.Chew T.-L. Masaracchia R.A. Goeckeler Z.M. Wysolmerski R.B. J. Muscle Res.

MLCK site-specific mutants were immunopurified from REF-52 cell extracts as described below. REF-52 cells expressing mutant MLCK proteins were washed twice with Mg2+/Ca2+ PBS, flooded with 800 μl of MLCK extraction buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm MgCl2, 1.0 mm EGTA, 1.0 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μg/ml benzamidine, 100 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 10 μg/ml each of TPCK, 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone, aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin at 4 °C), and immediately placed on ice. Cells were scraped up with a rubber policeman, culture dishes washed with an additional 200 μl of extraction buffer, and samples combined and extracted on ice for 20 min. The total cell extract was centrifuged at 132,000 × g for 10 min in a Beckman TL-100 ultracentrifuge. Pellets were extracted again by resuspending in 200 μl of extraction buffer, sonicating in a bath sonicator for two 5-s bursts, and incubating on ice for 20 min. The insoluble material was sedimented at 132,000 × g and supernatants combined. The supernatants were added to protein A beads pre-complexed with 15 μl of a polyclonal anti-rabbit smooth muscle MLCK IgG fraction (15 mg/ml) for 3 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes bound to protein A-Sepharose 4B were collected by centrifugation for 5 min at 12,000 × g at 4 °C. Pellets were first washed in 1 ml of extraction buffer and then once with a 1:1 dilution of extraction buffer/PBS and twice with PBS. Protein A beads containing the immunopurified mutant MLCK proteins were resuspended in PBS and equivalent aliquots were used for in vitro phosphorylation reactions as described above. 32PO4incorporation into WT and mutant MLCK proteins was assessed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The autoradiographs and corresponding Coomassie Blue-stained proteins were each quantitated by two-dimensional laser densitometry and MLCK phosphorylation expressed as a ratio of32PO4 densitometric units to protein densitometric units. All values were normalized to WT MLCK. 32P-Phosphorylated MLCK was electrophoresed on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, which were fixed in 50% methanol, 10% acetic acid, dried at 70 °C, and exposed to x-ray film. Labeled bands corresponding to the MLCK were cut from the SDS-polyacrylamide gel, rehydrated, and washed with five 1-ml changes of 10% methanol followed by two 1-ml changes of 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.8. The washed gel slices were cut into small pieces, placed in 800 μl of 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.8, and digested with 60 μg of TPCK-trypsin (1 mg/ml in 1 mm HCl) for 24 h at 37 °C. After the first 18 h, an additional 60 μg of trypsin was added. The solution was removed, gel pieces were washed with 500 μl of 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, samples combined, lyophilized in a Savant SpeedVac, redissolved in 1 ml of distilled water, relyophilized, and then resuspended in 20 μl of 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0. Tryptic peptides of MLCK were separated following the methods described by Daniel and Sellers (24.Daniel J.L. Sellers J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 215: 78-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Apparent pI values of the MLCK phosphopeptides were determined as outlined previously (14.Goeckeler Z.M. Wysolmerski R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 613-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). The pI values were not corrected for the presence of urea. Phosphoamino acid analysis of phosphorylated MLCK was performed as described by Haeberle et al. (25.Haeberle J.R. Sutton T.A. Trockman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4424-4429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modifications.32P-Labeled tryptic peptides of MLCK were acid-hydrolyzed in 6 n HCl at 100 °C under N2. HCl was removed under reduced pressure, and the hydrolysates were electrophoresed on cellulose thin layer plates for 3 h at 1 kV at 4 °C in glacial acetic acid/formic acid (88% by volume)/H2O, 80:20:900 (v/v). Phosphoamino acid standards (2 μg) were run side by side for comparison. Isometric tension measurements were performed as described in detail previously (14.Goeckeler Z.M. Wysolmerski R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 613-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 26.Kolodney M.S. Wysolmerski R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Monolayers were permeablized in stabilization buffer (127 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl, 1.1 mm NaH2PO4, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgSO4, 20 mm PIPES, 10 mm imidizole, 0.2 mmDTT, 5 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin, and chymostatin, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 0.5 mm benzamidine, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 6.5) containing 25 μg/ml saponin for 10 min. Permeabilized monolayers were washed twice in contraction buffer (50 mm KCl, 25 mm PIPES, 10 mm imidizole, 1 mmEGTA, 1 mm MgSO4, 0.2 mm DTT, 5 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin, and chymostatin, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 0.5 mm benzamidine, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.0) (18.Wysolmerski R.B.

Monolayers were stimulated to contract by addition of MgATP and Ca2+ as described previously (18.Wysolmerski R.B. Lagunoff D. Am. J.

The free Ca2+ concentration of contraction buffer, a Ca2+-EGTA buffer system, was determined as outlined previously (18.Wysolmerski R.B. Lagunoff D. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: C32-C40Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MLCK phosphorylation by PAK2in vitro using highly purified enzymes is shown in Fig.1. Trypsin-activated (lane 1) or Cdc42-GTPγS-activated (lane 2) placenta PAK2 as well as recombinant constitutively active PAK2 (lane 3) were incubated in the presence of purified MLCK for 10 min at 30 °C and MLCK phosphorylation assessed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. In the absence of CaM, both placenta PAK2 and recombinant constitutively active PAK2 catalyze efficient phosphorylation of MLCK. MLCK phosphorylation occurred with both Cdc42-GTPγS activation and trypsin activation of placenta PAK2, demonstrating that the reaction was catalyzed by both holoenzyme and the catalytic domain of PAK2. Activated placenta and recombinant PAK2 both phosphorylated MLCK to the same extent. Using a molar ratio of MLCK:PAK2 of 10:1, a stoichiometry of 1.71 ± 0.21 mol of PO4/mol of MLCK was measured. In the presence of unactivated PAK2 or in the absence of PAK2, there was no detectable MLCK phosphorylation (data not shown). A one-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide map and phosphoamino acid analysis were generated from the phosphorylated MLCK shown in Fig. 1(lane 3). Phosphorylated MLCK was excised from the gel and digested for 24 h with TPCK-trypsin. Half of the sample was used for phosphopeptide mapping, and the remainder was acid hydrolyzed for phosphoamino acid analysis. Three major MLCK phosphopeptides were detected by autoradiography (Fig.2 A). These peptides are designated P1, P2, and P3 in the order of increasing acidity. The most acidic peptide (P3) has a pI of approximately 4.8, whereas the most basic peptide (P1) has a pI of approximately 7.5; P2 has an approximate pI of 5.8. Thin layer electrophoresis of the acid-hydrolyzed sample showed a single 32P-labeled spot, which comigrated with the phosphoserine standard (Fig. 2 B). On the basis of these results, we concluded that all three phosphopeptides were phosphorylated on serine residues. In order to identify the specific serines within MLCK phosphorylated by PAK2, phosphorylated MLCK was trypsin digested and the tryptic phosphopeptides isolated by C18 reverse phase HPLC chromatography. Two major peaks were obtained. To achieve further purification, these fractions were rechromatographed on a Gilson SynChropak column as outlined under “Experimental Procedures.” Two phosphopeptide peaks were isolated and are identified as fractions I and II. The amino acid sequences of these fractions were determined by automated degradation using an Applied Biosystems sequencer. A single peptide with the amino acid sequence AIGRLSSMAMISGL was obtained from analysis of fraction II (TableI). This sequence corresponds to amino acids 986–999 in rabbit smMLCK (20.Gallagher P.J. Herring B. Griffin S. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23936-23944Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 32PO4significantly above background was detected in rounds 6 (85%) and 7 (13%), indicating that Ser-991 is phosphorylated by PAK2.Table IAmino acid sequences of MLCK phosphopeptidessmMLCK436–450RPKS439SLPPVLGTESDHPLC fraction I 32P in position 412345678910RPKX *SLXPXL 32P in position 1123456789101112X *SLPXVLGTESXsmMLCK986–1000AIGRLS991SMAMISGLSHPLC fraction II1234567891011121314AIGRLS*SMAMISGL* , phosphorylated residues.

Analysis of fraction I from multiple samples (n = 4) consistently gave a mixture of peptides containing the majority of32PO4 in sequencing rounds 1 (17%) and 4 (52%). Alignment of amino acids identified in each round with the predicted smMLCK (20.Gallagher P.J. Herring B. Griffin S. Stull J.T. J. Biol.

Although not conclusive, these data are consistent with phosphorylation of Ser-439 based on the occurrence of radioactivity. Alternative cleavage of MLCK by trypsin after residue Arg-435 or Lys-438 would produce the two phosphopeptides shown in Table I. Also of note is that the sequence GTES in sequencing rounds 8–11 does not occur at any other position in MLCK, further strengthening the conclusion that the phosphorylated residue at this phosphorylation site is Ser-439. The sequences at both phosphorylation sites are consistent with the specificity determinants identified in previous studies (27.Eckols T.K. Thompson R.E. Masaracchia R.A. Eur. J.

RGS GAP activity is inhibited by phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) but not by other lipid phosphoinositides or diacylglycerol. Both the negatively charged head group and long chain fatty acids (C16) are required for binding and inhibition of GAP activity.

These pathways are required for rapid responses to hormones and neurotransmitters. Signaling is initiated by agonist binding to receptors, which catalyze the exchange of GTP for GDP on the Gα subunit. Activated Gα-GTP and Gβγ subunits then regulate effector proteins that generate second messengers and subsequent downstream responses (reviewed in Ref. 1.Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev.

A diverse family of more than 20 RGS proteins are expressed in mammals (6.Zheng, B., De Vries, L., and Farquhar, M. G. (1999) Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol., in pressGoogle Scholar). The RGS proteins share a common sequence feature of about 130 amino acids, referred to as the RGS domain (RGS box), which is responsible for GAP activity (7.Koelle M.R. Horvitz H.R.

Many RGS proteins, including RGS4, can accelerate GTP hydrolysis on both Gi and Gqclass α subunits, whereas other RGS proteins are more selective catalysts (reviewed in Refs. 5.Ross E.R. Wilkie T.M.

Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar) that could bind acidic lipids in the plasma membrane. Here we demonstrate that dipalmitoylphosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (diC16-PIP3 or PIP3) binds RGS4 and inhibits its GAP activity in a concentration-dependent manner, in contrast to other phosphatidylinositol phosphates. PIP3inhibited GAP activity of other RGS proteins, including RGS1, RGS2, RGS10 and GAIP, but not RGS16. Amino acid substitutions in helix 5 of RGS4 reduced PIP3 binding (10-fold) and PIP3-dependent inhibition of GAP activity. A potential mechanism for feedback regulation of G protein-mediated Ca2+ signaling was suggested by the observation that PIP3-dependent inhibition of GAP activity was reversed by Ca2+/calmodulin. The concerted action of Ca2+/calmodulin and PIP3 may regulate RGS GAP activity to initiate [Ca2+]i oscillations evoked by G protein-coupled agonists.

Finally, 5 μl of the SDS-PAGE loading buffer was added to the beads and incubated another 10 min. Equal volume aliquots of supernatant were withdrawn after each incubation step, followed by separation by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Fluorescent detection of RGS4-calmodulin interaction was performed using Perkin-Elmer LS 50B and Hitachi F-2000 fluorescent spectrophotometers at 25 ± 0.1 °C. Both excitation and emission slit widths were 10 nm. For internal RGS4 tryptophan fluorescence measurements, the excitation and the emission wavelengths were 283 and 336 nm, respectively. Typically, aliquots of CaM solution were gradually added to the solution of RGS4 in the assay cuvette with constant agitation, and after each addition the mixture was equilibrated inside the instrument with the excitation beam shutter closed. The fluorescence measurements were made after 5–15 min. The excitation beam shutter was opened only long enough to get accurate readings. Measurements were repeated until reproducible readings were obtained. Data in Fig. 2 were corrected for dilution (which did not exceed 7%) and for fluorescence of calmodulin alone. Calmodulin was dansylated as described (31.Olwin B.B. Storm D.R. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 102: 148-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and extensively dialyzed against 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Fluorescence measurements of dansylated calmodulin (dansyl-CaM) were at 335 (excitation) and 500 nm (emission). All measurements were corrected for background fluorescence observed in control experiments. The Scatchard plot analysis of the fluorescence affinity measurement data indicated a single binding site interaction (or 2 sites with similar affinities) and fit well to linear approximations within the experimental error. GAP assays were carried out in a soluble single turnover system with Gαi1 as described (2.Berman D. Wilkie T.M. Gilman A.G. Cell. 1996; 86: 445-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar, 9.Popov S., Yu, K. Kozasa T. Wilkie T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7216-7220Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, 250–500 nmGαi1 in the assay buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT) was loaded with [γ-32P]GTP at 30 °C for 20 min. The solution was placed on ice for 5 min, and all subsequent reactions were carried out on ice in a cold room. A drop of RGS protein (5–10 μl) was placed onto a wall of reaction tube next to a 5-μl drop of solution, 500 mm MgCl2, 5 mm cold GTP, and the GAP reaction was started by addition of 175 μl of Gαi1-GTP solution. The final concentration of free Mg2+ ions in the reaction mix was 3–4 mm. To study the influence of Ca2+/calmodulin on RGS4 GAP activity with Gαi1-GTP, RGS4 was preincubated with calmodulin in 10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm DTT on ice for 20 min. Then 175 μl of Gαi1 loaded with [γ-32P]GTP was added with 5 μl of 500 mm GTP, 475 mmMgCl2, 25 mm CaCl2. To prepare small unilamellar lipid vesicles (SUVs), chloroform-soluble lipids were evaporated under a stream of nitrogen into a dry film, and resuspended by vortexing in a sonication buffer, 10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, essentially as described (32.Derman M.P. Toker A. Hartwig J.H. Spokes K. Falck J.R. Chen C.-S. Cantley L.C. Cantley L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6465-6470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 33.Zhang X.

SUVs were generated by sonication of a lipid suspension (2 mg/ml total lipid) in a water bath at room temperature for 10–15 min. To prepare SUVs containing chloroform-insoluble diC16-PIP3, the suspension of diC16-PIP3 in the sonication buffer (10 mg/ml) was added to the dry film of other lipids, vortexed vigorously for 1 min, and sonicated after addition of the appropriate amount of the sonication buffer. Aggregated material was removed from the preparations of SUVs by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The micelles of diC16-PIP3 were obtained by its brief sonication in a buffer solution (32.Derman M.P. Toker A. Hartwig J.H. Spokes K. Falck J.R. Chen C.-S. Cantley L.C. Cantley L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6465-6470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Surface plasmon resonance measurements were performed using BIAcore 1000 instrument (BIAcore, Inc.) at 25 °C. RGS protein was immobilized on the surface of the carboxymethylated dextran chip (CA-5) using standard carbodiimide chemistry in accordance with manufacturer's instructions. Lipid dissolved in the running buffer, 10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.005% surfactant NP20, was injected over the chip surface with a flow rate 5 μl/min. At least three different concentrations were used. Control injections were made with a blank chip without coupled RGS. The amount of coupled protein was 2500 (RGS4), 1580 (RGS4 K112E/K113E), and 2900 response units (RU) (RGS16). The regeneration of the chip after each binding experiment was achieved by injecting 0.01% SDS in running buffer. The data were analyzed using the BIAevaluation 2.1 software (BIAcore, Inc.). The binding curves showed a moderate heterogeneity of both association and dissociation phases. The minor components identified in the analysis of association and dissociation (less than 20% of total signal) were ignored. A relatively fast transition process evident at the beginning of the dissociation phase was not studied. The dissociation constant, K d, was calculated for each sensorgram using kinetic constants k a andk d. The average values are shown in Table IV.Table IVRGS-PIP3 kinetic and affinity constantsProteink ak dK d10 3 m −1 s −110 −4 s −1nmRGS412.1 ± 7.54.8 ± 1.644 ± 19 (n = 5)RGS4 KE112,1133.2 ± 1.412.6 ± 1.1430 ± 140 (n = 4)RGS165.2 ± 2.57.9 ± 2.7163 ± 38 (n = 3)Binding constants (± S.D.) were determined with the BIAcore at 25 °C.

To investigate the role of Ca2+ in feedback regulation of G protein signaling by RGS proteins, we characterized two potential calmodulin binding regions in RGS4 as follows: one in the N-terminal 33 amino acids and another between residues 99–113, in helixes 4 and 5 of the RGS domain (4Box). These regions contain amphiphatic sequences with bulky hydrophobic residues at certain positions and clusters of positively charged amino acids similar to calmodulin-binding sites in other proteins (Table I; see Ref. 18.James P. Vorherr T. Carafoli E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 38-42Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). We found that RGS4 bound calmodulin in a Ca2+-dependent manner (the complex was dissociated by 2 mm EGTA) in a standard band shift assay for calmodulin binding (Fig. 1; Ref. 30.Erickson-Vitanen S. DeGrado W.F. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 139: 455-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). RGS4 binding to Ca2+/calmodulin was corroborated using calmodulin coupled to agarose beads. RGS4 binding to calmodulin-agarose beads required Ca2+ and was stable to buffer washes, but bound RGS4 could be eluted from beads either with EGTA or SDS (Fig.1 C). We found that a previously characterized amphipathic calmodulin-binding peptide from CaM kinase II (34.Payne M.E. Fong Y.L. Ono T. Colbran R.J. Kemp B.E. Soderling T.R. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7190-7195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) competed with RGS4 binding to calmodulin-agarose beads (Fig. 1 E, 4th and5th lanes). An RGS4 N-terminal 33 amino acid peptide (P1–33), which conveys high affinity and receptor-selective regulation of Gq signaling (12.Zeng W. Xu X. Popov S. Mukhopadhyay S. Chidiac P. Swistok J. Danho W. Yagaloff K.A. Fisher S.L. Ross E.M. Muallem S. Wilkie T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34687-34690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), bound Ca2+/calmodulin (Fig. 1 D) and competed with RGS4 for binding to calmodulin-agarose beads (Fig. 1 E, 6th and7th lanes). By contrast, a scrambled sequence composed of the same amino acids (ψP1–33) did not bind to calmodulin beads (data not shown) and did not compete with RGS4 binding (Fig. 1 E, 8th and 9th lanes). Interestingly, RGS4 apparently formed a heterotrimeric complex with Gαi1-GDP-AlF4− and Ca2+/calmodulin (Fig. 1 F), consistent with their predicted distinct binding sites on RGS4.Table IPutative calmodulin binding regions in RGS domain proteinsProteinSequenceConsensus−h++h+XXX+hXX+h++hrRGS4(97) EYKKIKSPSKLSPKAKKI (114)hGAIP(125) ELKAEANQHVVDEKARLI (142)hRGS1(107) DYKKTES-DLLPCKAEEI (123)hRGS2(118) DFKKTKSPQKLSSKARKI (135)hRGS3(429) DFKKVKSQSKMASKAKKI (446)hRGS10(68) DFKKMQDKTQMQEKAKEI (85)mRGS16(99) EFKKIRSATKLASRAHHI (116)The amino acid residues used are: −, negative; +, positive; h, hydrophobic; X, any; -, gap in alignment. Open table in a new tab The amino acid residues used are: −, negative; +, positive; h, hydrophobic; X, any; -, gap in alignment. We used fluorescence spectroscopy to quantitate binding interactions between RGS4 and Ca2+/calmodulin. The fluorescence of two tryptophan residues within the RGS domain of RGS4 (4Box) was quenched by titration with Ca2+/calmodulin (which lacks tryptophan), indicative of RGS4-Ca2+/calmodulin binding in solution (Fig. 2). A sharp inflection in the titration curve indicates formation of a stable, equimolar complex between Ca2+/calmodulin and 4Box (20 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). Upon further addition of Ca2+/calmodulin to 4Box, the slope of the fluorescence titration curve paralleled that of unbound RGS4 and Ca2+/calmodulin (calculated as the sum of their fluorescence signals measured separately). This behavior is consistent with the prediction of a single Ca2+/calmodulin-binding site in the RGS domain. By contrast, in the absence of salt, the fluorescence intensity of RGS4 (Fig. 2) or 4Box (data not shown) did not change at higher molar ratios of Ca2+/calmodulin, suggesting additional, low affinity calmodulin-binding sites on RGS4. These low affinity interactions are probably electrostatic because they were not detected at higher ionic strength (Fig. 2, 4Box,and data not shown). In addition to the RGS domain, Ca2+/calmodulin apparently binds to the N-terminal 33 amino acids of RGS4 because the peptide P1–33 binds in a Ca2+-dependent manner both to calmodulin beads (Fig. 1) and in solution, as detected by two-dimensional heteronuclear single quantum coherence NMR using [15N]calmodulin. 2K. L.-P. I. Fernandez, S. G. Popov, and J. Rizo-Rey, unpublished data. Although P1–33 has no residues with fluorescent properties convenient for affinity measurements, we used a dansylated derivative of calmodulin (dansyl-CaM, see Ref. 31.Olwin B.B. Storm D.R. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 102: 148-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) which allowed us to compare the binding properties of P1–33 and RGS4 in similar conditions. The apparent K d values (TableII) were calculated from Scatchard linear transformations of titration curves (Fig.3). In the presence of 100 mmNaCl, RGS4 and P1–33 bind to Ca2+/dansyl-CaM with similar affinities (K d ≈5 μm). The affinity of P1–33 binding within the accuracy of measurements did not change with ionic strength, whereas RGS4 bound Ca2+/dansyl-CaM almost 5 times stronger than P1–33 in 20 mm NaCl, consistent with our observations that a decrease in salt concentration strengthened the interaction of RGS4 with Ca2+/calmodulin beads.Table IIAffinity (μm) of RGS4-Ca 2+ /CaM interaction (25 °C)Interaction[NaCl]20 mm50 mm100 mmP1–33 + dansyl-CaM4.94.94.9RGS4 + dansyl-CaM1.12.34.7 Open table in a new tab Calmodulin binds to many RGS proteins in a Ca2+-dependent manner but with different salt dependences. Binding assays indicated that RGS4, RGS16, and GAIP had similar affinities toward calmodulin-agarose beads in 20 mmNaCl, whereas RGS10 interaction with Ca2+/calmodulin was relatively weak (even without salt). Only RGS1 and RGS2 bound to calmodulin-agarose beads in high salt (150 mm KCl). Stable interaction was corroborated by band shift analysis that revealed an RGS2-Ca2+/calmodulin complex in high ionic strength running buffer with 4 m urea, 275 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3 (data not shown). To test the biological relevance of Ca2+/calmodulin binding to RGS proteins, we studied its effect on RGS4 and RGS1 GAP activity. We found that neither 1 mm Ca2+ alone nor 1.6 μm Ca2+/calmodulin preincubated with either RGS protein altered their GAP activity toward Gαi1 in a single turnover assay (Fig. 4 and data not shown). Because the N terminus of RGS4 is not required for GAP activity (9.Popov S., Yu, K. Kozasa T. Wilkie T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7216-7220Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) but binds calmodulin (Fig. 1, D andE), we also tested GAP activity of an N-terminal deletion mutant that lacked the first 57 residues of RGS4 but retained the calmodulin-binding site within the RGS domain (R4ΔN; Fig. 4 B). The GAP activities of full-length RSG4 and R4ΔN were unaffected by Ca2+/calmodulin in the single turnover assay (Fig. 4). These results indicated that Ca2+/calmodulin binding neither sterically blocked Gαi1 binding nor irreversibly changed the conformation of the RGS4-Gαi1 interface. Considering the stability of RGS4 binding to Ca2+/calmodulin beads (Fig. 1), it seems improbable that GAP activity resulted from the rapid and transient displacement Ca2+/calmodulin from RGS4 by Gαi-GTP. Indeed, we found that Gαi1-GDP-AlF4−, which mimics a transition state of RGS4-catalyzed Gα-GTP hydrolysis (K d = 0.6 nm at 25 °C, Ref. 9.Popov S., Yu, K. Kozasa T. Wilkie T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7216-7220Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), binds as a complex with RGS4 and Ca2+/calmodulin-agarose beads (Fig. 1 E). This complex was stable to extensive washing with buffer, but RGS4-Gαi1-GDP-AlF4− was eluted from Ca2+/calmodulin beads by 1% SDS. Gαi1-GDP-AlF4− did not bind to Ca2+/calmodulin in the absence of RGS4. These results indicate that a heterodimeric complex of Ca2+/calmodulin-RGS4 retains GAP activity. We therefore favor a model in which calmodulin binds surface residues of the RGS domain without substantially altering the RGS4 conformation. Previous studies indicated that brief dialysis of recombinant RGS4 into patch clamped pancreatic acinar cells potently inhibited Ca2+ signaling evoked by Gi- and Gq-coupled receptor agonists (12.Zeng W. Xu X. Popov S. Mukhopadhyay S. Chidiac P. Swistok J. Danho W. Yagaloff K.A. Fisher S.L. Ross E.M. Muallem S. Wilkie T.M. J. Biol.

J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3549-3556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). This suggested the possibility that endogenous RGS proteins might be relatively inactive prior to agonist stimulation of Ca2+ signaling and that recombinant RGS proteins escaped this inhibition. To identify inhibitors of RGS4 GAP activity on Gαi1 in the single turnover assay, we tested various compounds related to and including either the substrate or products of PLCβ. We found that RGS4 GAP activity was inhibited by preincubation with an analog of PIP3, diC16-PIP3 (30 μm PIP3, at 0 °C for several minutes, Fig.5 A), or phosphocholine vesicles containing 20% PIP3 (Fig. 5 B). Inhibition of RGS4 GAP activity was dependent on the concentration of PIP3 (Fig. 5 C). The kinetic curve of GTP hydrolysis in the presence of PIP3 closely approximated the basal activity of Gα without RGS4. This behavior indicated negligible dissociation of PIP3 from RGS4 during the assay (5 min) because GTP hydrolysis was initiated by a rapid 20-fold dilution of the RGS-PIP3 incubation mix into a solution containing Gαi1-GTP. In control experiments, the intrinsic GTPase activity of Gαi1 was unaffected by PIP3 (Fig.5 D). The GAP activity of each RGS protein that was tested in the single turnover assay, except RGS16, was inhibited by PIP3 (Fig. 5 D and data not shown). By contrast to PIP3 inhibition of RGS GAP activity, no effect was observed following coincubation of RGS4 with 400 μm PIP2 from bovine brain (Fig.5 B), and only 2–3-fold inhibition was observed following coincubation with PIP2 micelles (9 mm). We barely detected the inhibitory activity of 4-mono phosphorylated phosphatidylinositol phosphate, PIP (9 mm). As summarized in Table III, several synthetic PIP2 lipids were also without effect (assayed at 400 μm in phosphocholine vesicles), including dioctanoylphosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (diC8–3,4-PIP2), dioctanoylphosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (diC8–3,5-PIP2), and dioctanoylphosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (diC8–4,5-PIP2). RGS4 GAP activity was also not affected by a lipid head group derivative, 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycerol (diacylglycerol, DAG), which is one of the reaction products of PLCβ. No inhibitory activity was detected using PI or highly charged head group derivatives of PIP3 lacking the fatty acyl moieties, including inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (IP4) and glycerophosphoinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3, the other reaction product of PLCβ; data not shown). PIP3 binding to Rac1 and RhoA was shown to have similar requirements for both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions (35.Missy K. Van Poucke V. Raynal P. Viala C. Mauco G. Plantavid M. Chap H. Payrastre B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 13: 30279-30286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, we found that dioctanoylphosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (diC8-PIP3), which only differed from PIP3(diC16-PIP3) in the length of the fatty acid chains, did not inhibit RGS4 GAP activity; nor did diC16-3,5-PIP2. Thus, diC16-PIP3 is the only phospholipid which inhibited RGS4 GAP activity, and its activity appears to require both the long chain fatty acid moiety and the highly charged head group.Table IIIPIP3 charge density and fatty acid chain length required to inhibit RGS4 GAP activityLipid testedRGS4 bindingRGS4 GAP activitydiC16–3,4,5-PIP3+−4,5-PIP2 (brain)−+/−aInhibition detectable above 1 mm 4,5-PIP2.4-PIP (brain)NT+/−bMarginal effect at 7 mm PI, +, binding detected or RGS4 GAP activity is normal; −, binding or GAP not detected; NT, not tested.PI (brain)NT+diC8–3,4,5-PIP3−+diC8–3,4-PIP2−+diC8–3,5-PIP2−+diC8–4,5-PIP2−+Gro-3,4,5-IP3NT+1,3,4,5-IP4NT+DAGNT+a Inhibition detectable above 1 mm 4,5-PIP2.b Marginal effect at 7 mm PI, +, binding detected or RGS4 GAP activity is normal; −, binding or GAP not detected; NT, not tested. Open table in a new tab Protein-lipid binding affinities were estimated by surface plasmon resonance measurements on the BIAcore (Biacore, Inc). RGS4 coupled to the carboxymethylated dextran surface of the BIAcore chip bound diC16-PIP3 (Fig.6 A) but not diC8-PIP3, PIP2, or other phosphoinositides, consistent with the observation that RGS GAP activity was most sensitive to inhibition by diC16-PIP3. The association phase of diC16-PIP3 binding was typically complete within several minutes, whereas dissociation was slow (Fig. 6 A). No diC16-PIP3 binding was detected on a blank chip. TheK d value of diC16-PIP3 binding to RGS4 (44 ± 19 nm; Table IV) was calculated from the on and off rates extracted from the binding curves (Fig. 6 A, and data not shown). The positively charged patch on the surface of helixes 4 and 5 in the RGS domain of RGS4 (residues 99–113; Ref. 26.Tesmer J.J. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar) appeared to be a good candidate for binding not only to calmodulin but also to PIP3. We found that PIP3 inhibition of RGS4 GAP activity was reversed by coincubation of RGS4 and PIP3 (micelles or phosphocholine vesicles) with Ca2+/calmodulin (Fig. 7). Ca2+/calmodulin and PIP3 apparently compete for binding to helixes 4 and 5 in RGS4. To test this model further, we introduced amino acid substitutions of glutamate for lysine residues at positions 112 and 113 in helix 5 of RGS4. This mutant protein (RGS4 K112E/K113E) retained GAP activity and calmodulin binding, but it bound PIP3 with almost 10-fold lower affinity than did wild type RGS4 (Table IV). Similarly, low binding affinity was observed with RGS16. The comparatively weak binding of these proteins to PIP3 correlated with their relative insensitivity to PIP3 inhibition of GAP activity (Figs. 5 D and6 B). Helixes 4 and 5 are conserved in many RGS domains (Table I) and may provide an important regulatory feature of RGS proteins because Ca2+/calmodulin has been shown to serve as a molecular switch that regulates lipid-protein interactions (19.Arbuzova A. Wang J. Murray D. Jacob J. Cafiso D.S. McLaughlin S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27167-27177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 20.Matsubara M. Titani K. Taniguchi H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1451-1458Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 21.Hayashi N. Matsubara M. Titani K. Taniguchi H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7639-7645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We propose that PIP3-mediated inhibition of GAP activity acts by a concerted mechanism in which the highly charged head group interacts with the RGS domain residues in helixes 4 and/or 5 to position the palmitoyl moiety of PIP3 near its binding site. Palmitoylation of a nearby cysteine residue inhibited RGS4 and RGS10 GAP activity (36.Tu Y. Popov S. Slaughter C. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38260-38267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This cysteine residue in helix 4 (Cys95 in RGS4) is conserved in the RGS domain of all mammalian RGS proteins except RGS6 and RGS7 (6.Zheng, B., De Vries, L., and Farquhar, M. G. (1999) Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol., in pressGoogle Scholar). Substitution of cysteine for valine (C95V) prevents covalent modification by palmitate at this position in RGS4. GAP activity of the C95V mutant protein is equivalent to wild type protein, but it is not inhibited by palmitoylation (36.Tu Y. Popov S. Slaughter C. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38260-38267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). By contrast, the GAP activity of RGS4 C95V is as sensitive to PIP3-mediated inhibition as is wild type protein (Fig. 8 A). The GAP activities of RGS16 and the mutant RGS4 K112E/K113E, which were relatively insensitive to inhibition by PIP3, responded like wild type protein to inhibition by palmitoylation (Fig. 8,B and C). In contrast to RGS4 interaction with PIP3, inhibition of GAP activity by palmitoylation was not prevented by addition of Ca2+/calmodulin (Fig.8 D). This is presumably because Ca2+/calmodulin competes with PIP3 binding to RGS4 but cannot displace the covalent modification of RGS4 by palmitate. The feedback mechanisms that regulate the palmitoylation of RGS proteins in vivo are unknown, but we propose that PIP3-mediated inhibition of RGS GAP activity may be reversed in a Ca2+-dependent manner through binding of Ca2+/calmodulin. Negative regulation of RGS GAP activity by PIP3 may be part of a reset mechanism that allows a new wave of G protein signaling in response to agonist. G protein-coupled receptors, such as formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanyl receptors in neutrophils, can elicit both Ca2+-release and a rapid and large accumulation of PIP3 by activating the effector proteins PLCβ and PI-3 kinase, respectively (reviewed in Ref. 37.Rameh L.E. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8347-8350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). Ca2+ release from internal stores is one of the initial responses to PLCβ activation either by Gαq or Gβγ from Giclass G proteins. As the local concentration of Ca2+elevates in response to PLCβ activity, we postulate that Ca2+/calmodulin binding to RGS4 and other RGS proteins displaces PIP3 to restore GAP activity (modeled in Fig.9). Ca2+/calmodulin binding may also enhance GAP activity by relocating RGS proteins within the receptor signaling complex to be in proximity to their Gα-GTP substrates. Feedback inhibition of G protein-mediated PLCβ activation by RGS proteins would allow [Ca2+]i to decrease and promote the dissociation of calmodulin from RGS proteins. We hypothesize that PIP3 released after receptor stimulation could then bind RGS proteins to inhibit their GAP activity. If agonist stimulation persists, this may reactivate G protein signaling and allow another burst of Ca2+ release from internal stores. If agonist is no longer present, PIP3-mediated inhibition of RGS GAP activity may reset the signaling pathway to allow a robust cellular response to subsequent agonist stimulation. Feedback regulation of RGS GAP activity may provide an intracellular mechanism to initiate oscillations over a wide range of frequencies. We thank Y. Tu for RGS4C95V protein; K.

https://openalex.org/W1985998548,"Galectin-1 induces apoptosis of immature thymocytes and activated T cells, suggesting that galectin-1 regulates cell death in the thymus during selection and in the periphery following an immune response. Although it is known that galectin-1 recognizes lactosamine (Gal-GlcNAc) as a minimal ligand, this disaccharide is ubiquitously expressed on a variety of cell surface glycoproteins. Thus, susceptibility to galectin-1 may be regulated by the presentation of lactosamine on specific oligosaccharide structures created by specific glycosyltransferase enzymes. The core 2 β-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (core 2 GnT) creates a branched structure on O-glycans that can be elongated to present multiple lactosamine sequences. In the thymus, the core 2 GnT is expressed in galectin-1-sensitive thymocyte subsets. In the periphery, an oligosaccharide epitope created by the core 2 GnT is expressed on galectin-1-sensitive activated T-cells. In this report, we demonstrate that expression of the core 2 GnT was necessary and sufficient for galectin-1-induced death of murine T cell lines. In addition, overexpression of the core 2 GnT in mice increased the susceptibility of double positive thymocytes to galectin-1. These data demonstrate that expression of a specific glycosyltransferase can control susceptibility to galectin-1, suggesting that developmentally regulated glycosyltransferase expression may be a mechanism to modulate cell death during T cell development and function. Galectin-1 induces apoptosis of immature thymocytes and activated T cells, suggesting that galectin-1 regulates cell death in the thymus during selection and in the periphery following an immune response. Although it is known that galectin-1 recognizes lactosamine (Gal-GlcNAc) as a minimal ligand, this disaccharide is ubiquitously expressed on a variety of cell surface glycoproteins. Thus, susceptibility to galectin-1 may be regulated by the presentation of lactosamine on specific oligosaccharide structures created by specific glycosyltransferase enzymes. The core 2 β-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (core 2 GnT) creates a branched structure on O-glycans that can be elongated to present multiple lactosamine sequences. In the thymus, the core 2 GnT is expressed in galectin-1-sensitive thymocyte subsets. In the periphery, an oligosaccharide epitope created by the core 2 GnT is expressed on galectin-1-sensitive activated T-cells. In this report, we demonstrate that expression of the core 2 GnT was necessary and sufficient for galectin-1-induced death of murine T cell lines. In addition, overexpression of the core 2 GnT in mice increased the susceptibility of double positive thymocytes to galectin-1.

Perillo N.L. Wu T. Delegeane A. Uittenbogaart C. Fukuda M. Seilhamer J.J. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). In contrast, GnT V is expressed in all subsets of human thymocytes. 2M. Pang, M. Pierce, and L. G. Baum, unpublished data. 2M. Pang, M. Pierce, and L. G. Baum, unpublished data. Expression of the core 2 GnT has also been shown to regulate leukocyte function in the periphery. T lymphocytes from core 2 GnT transgenic mice demonstrated reduced immune responses, resulting from alterations in cell-cell interactions (24.Tsuboi S. Fukuda M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6364-6373Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In addition, recent work has found that the epitope created by the core 2 GnT is not detected on naive peripheral T cells but is expressed at high levels on antigen-specific effector T cells following an immune response. This epitope is not detected on antigen-specific memory T cells, suggesting that core 2 GnT expression is important in discriminating between effector and memory T cells (25.Harrington L.E. Galvan M. Baum L.G. Altman J.D. Ahmed R. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1241-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). However, the precise functions of the core 2 GnT and GnT V in thymocyte development have not been elucidated.Although it is clear that galectin-1 preferentially binds to polylactosamine sequences, it is not known whether N-linked or O-linked polylactosamine sequences on T cell surface glycoproteins participate in galectin-1 apoptosis. Because the core 2 GnT and GnT V can both create the oligosaccharide scaffolds on which polylactosamine units can be added, we asked whether expression of these two enzymes regulates the susceptibility of T cells to galectin-1. To examine the roles of the core 2 GnT and GnT V in galectin-1 apoptosis, we used two murine cell lines, the BW5147 T cell lymphoma and a derivative of this line, PHAR2.1. The PHAR2.1 cell line was generated by mutagenesis and selection for resistance to the cytotoxic lectin phaseolus agglutinin-L that recognizes the oligosaccharide structure generated by GnT V (26.Trowbridge I. Hyman R. Ferson T. Mazauskas C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1978; 8: 716-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). BW5147 cells have high levels of GnT V activity, whereas PHAR2.1 cells lack GnT V activity (27.Cummings R.D. Trowbridge I.S. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13421-13427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, we have found that PHAR2.1 cells express the core 2 GnT, whereas BW5147 cells do not. These two cell lines allowed us to begin to define the oligosaccharide structures required for galectin-1-induced apoptosis.DISCUSSIONThere are several factors that may regulate susceptibility to galectin-1-induced cell death. First, differential expression of the glycosyltransferases that create the oligosaccharide structure(s) recognized by galectin-1 will modulate the susceptibility of cells to galectin-1. Glycosylation may control other forms of cell death as well. Keppler et al. (32.Keppler O.T. Peter M.E. Hinderlich G.M. Stehling P. Schmitz I. Schwartz-Albiez R. Reutter W. Pawlita M. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 557-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) showed that expression of the α-2,6-sialyltransferase regulated the susceptibility of B cell lines to Fas-induced apoptosis. Second, the oligosaccharide structures created by the glycosyltransferases must be linked to glycolipids or glycoproteins on the T cell surface that can transduce the death signal. Finally, the T cell must express the internal components of the apoptotic machinery for the galectin-1 death signal to be sent to completion.The aim of the present study was to identify the oligosaccharide ligands that participate in the transduction of the galectin-1 death signal by focusing on the enzymes that regulate polylactosamine synthesis, GnT V and the core 2 GnT. As shown in Fig. 1 C, BW5147 cells that did not express the core 2 GnT were not susceptible to galectin-1. In contrast, PHAR2.1 cells that expressed the core 2 GnT were highly susceptible to galectin-1. By 8 h, greater than 70% of cells died in response to galectin-1. Inhibition of O-glycan processing in PHAR2.1 cells resulted in a dramatic decrease in galectin-1-mediated death. Finally, overexpression of the core 2 GnT in BW5147 cells was sufficient to make these cells susceptible to galectin-1-induced death. These data demonstrated that the ligand created by the core 2 GnT is necessary for galectin-1-induced apoptosis in these murine T cell lines.The core 2 GnT is an intriguing candidate for regulating T cell susceptibility to galectin-1 during development in the thymus and as T cells function in the periphery. The core 2 GnT is highly expressed in DP thymocytes and activated peripheral T cells (23.Baum L.G. Pang M. Perillo N.L. Wu T. Delegeane A. Uittenbogaart C. Fukuda M. Seilhamer J.J. J. Exp.

Fox R.I. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15146-15150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the two populations of T lymphocytes that are susceptible to galectin-1 (4.Perillo N.L.

As shown in Fig. 4 (C and D), we found increased galectin-1-induced cell death of DP thymocytes from the core 2 GnT transgenic mice compared with DP thymocytes from wild-type mice. This indicated that expression of the core 2 GnT could confer galectin-1 susceptibility to a subset of DP thymocytes. However, SP thymocytes from core 2 GnT transgenic mice remained insensitive to galectin-1 apoptosis. Therefore, expression of the core 2 GnT alone is not sufficient to render mature thymocytes susceptible to galectin-1 apoptosis.These data reveal that the regulation of galectin-1 susceptibility occurs at several cellular levels. Because overexpression of the core 2 GnT in mature SP thymocytes did not render these cells susceptible to galectin-1, SP thymocytes may not have the internal apoptotic machinery required for galectin-1-induced cell death. The intracellular galectin-1 death pathway may be blocked at some point, or a separate anti-apoptotic signal could override the galectin-1 death message.In contrast, DP thymocytes have the internal apoptotic pathway required for galectin-1-mediated cell death. If DP thymocytes express the core 2 GnT, galectin-1 binding can trigger the death pathway. However, in wild-type mice, a subset of DP thymocytes does not express the core 2 GnT and thus may not synthesize an essential galectin-1 ligand. Ellieset al. (31.Ellies L.G. Tao W. Fellinger W. Teh H.-S. Ziltener H.J. Blood. 1996; 88: 1725-1732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that expression of the core 2 GnT is down-regulated during positive selection of murine thymocytes. When we examined DP thymocytes from wild-type mice for expression of core 2O-glycans, there was a small population of DP thymocytes (approximately 25%) that had diminished expression of core 2O-glycans (Fig. 4 A). This fraction is roughly equivalent to the fraction of thymocytes from the core 2 GnT transgenic mice demonstrating increased susceptibility to galectin-1 (Fig.4 C). These data indicate that there is a subset of DP thymocytes that remains susceptible to galectin-1 if the saccharide ligand created by the core 2 GnT is expressed. Thus, our results suggest that in thymic development there is a narrow developmental window during which loss of core 2 GnT expression precedes down-regulation of the galectin-1 apoptotic machinery. The 20–60% increase in galectin-1-induced cell death of the DP thymocytes from the core 2 GnT mice compared with that from wild-type mice (Fig. 4,C and D) may appear modest. However, this difference could have a significant biological effect during the selection process, where the additional loss of DP thymocytes could adversely impact the total repertoire.Expression of specific T cell surface glycoproteins containing the core 2 O-linked oligosaccharides may be another factor regulating galectin-1-mediated apoptosis. The core 2 GnT is known to modify oligosaccharide structures on a number of T cell glycoproteins including CD43 and CD45 (30.Carlow D.A. Ardman B. Ziltener H.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 1441-1448PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Barran P. Fellinger W. Warren C.E. Dennis J.W. Ziltener H.J. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). CD45 and CD43 are heavily glycosylated proteins that are expressed at high levels on the surface of the BW5147 and PHAR2.1 cell lines (data not shown). Furthermore, regulated changes in the oligosaccharide structures that decorate CD45 and CD43 have been shown to occur during thymic development and T cell activation in the periphery (23.Baum L.G. Pang M. Perillo N.L. Wu T. Delegeane A. Uittenbogaart C. Fukuda M. Seilhamer J.J. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 31.Ellies L.G. Tao W. Fellinger W.

Chem. 1996; 271: 10793-10799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that CD45 and CD43 are receptors for galectin-1 on T cells (36.Pace K.E. Lee C. Stewart P.L. Baum L.G. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 3801-3811PubMed Google Scholar). Addition of core 2 O-glycans to CD45 or CD43 may allow the cross-linking and movement of these glycoproteins on the cell surface that occurs following galectin-1 binding (36.Pace K.E. Lee C. Stewart P.L. Baum L.G. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 3801-3811PubMed Google Scholar).The core GnT appears to play an important role in many immune processes. Expression of the core 2 GnT enzyme has recently been shown to be necessary for proper function of the innate immune system, since this enzyme can also regulate synthesis of ligands for the selectin family of cell adhesion molecules (37.Ellies L.G. Tsuboi S. Petryniak B. Lowe J.B. Fukuda M. Marth J.D. Immunity. 1998; 9: 881-890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Disregulation of core 2 GnT expression has been observed in several immune disorders, such as Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, leukemia, and AIDS (38.Piller F. Le Deist F. Weinberg K. Parkman R. Fukuda M. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 1501-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 39.Higgins E.A. Siminovitch K.A. Zhuang D. Brockhausen I. Dennis J.W. J. Biol.

Immunol. 1999; 11: 417-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) have recently found that core 2 GnT expression is increased on a subset of human peripheral T cells compared with naive T cells. Importantly, the 1B11 antibody, which recognizes an epitope created by the core 2 GnT, appears to discriminate effector T cells from memory T cells (25.Harrington L.E. Galvan M. Baum L.G. Altman J.D. Ahmed R. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1241-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). This implies that core 2 GnT activity is high in effector cells but low in memory cells (26.Trowbridge I. Hyman R. Ferson T. Mazauskas C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1978; 8: 716-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The expression of core 2 O-glycans on effector cells may contribute to the elimination of these cells by galectin-1 following an immune response, whereas memory T cells that lack core 2 O-glycans would escape galectin-1-mediated death. Work is under way in our laboratory to address this. Differential expression of the core 2 GnT may regulate the susceptibility of T cells to apoptosis both during thymic development and during an immune response in the periphery.Note Added in ProofRecent studies have demonstrated increased expression of core 2 O-glycans associated with increased apoptosis of CD8 T cells in ST3Gal I-deficient mice (Priatel, J. J., Chui, D., Hiraoka, N., Simmons, C. J. T., Richardson, K. B., Page, D. M., Fukuda, M., Varki, N. M., and Marth, J. D. (2000)Immunity 12, 273–283).

Perillo N.L. Wu T. Delegeane A. Uittenbogaart C. Fukuda M. Seilhamer J.J. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). In contrast, GnT V is expressed in all subsets of human thymocytes. 2M. Pang, M. Pierce, and L. G. Baum, unpublished data. 2M. Pang, M. Pierce, and L. G. Baum, unpublished data. Expression of the core 2 GnT has also been shown to regulate leukocyte function in the periphery. T lymphocytes from core 2 GnT transgenic mice demonstrated reduced immune responses, resulting from alterations in cell-cell interactions (24.Tsuboi S. Fukuda M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6364-6373Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In addition, recent work has found that the epitope created by the core 2 GnT is not detected on naive peripheral T cells but is expressed at high levels on antigen-specific effector T cells following an immune response. This epitope is not detected on antigen-specific memory T cells, suggesting that core 2 GnT expression is important in discriminating between effector and memory T cells (25.Harrington L.E. Galvan M. Baum L.G. Altman J.D. Ahmed R. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1241-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). However, the precise functions of the core 2 GnT and GnT V in thymocyte development have not been elucidated. Although it is clear that galectin-1 preferentially binds to polylactosamine sequences, it is not known whether N-linked or O-linked polylactosamine sequences on T cell surface glycoproteins participate in galectin-1 apoptosis. Because the core 2 GnT and GnT V can both create the oligosaccharide scaffolds on which polylactosamine units can be added, we asked whether expression of these two enzymes regulates the susceptibility of T cells to galectin-1. To examine the roles of the core 2 GnT and GnT V in galectin-1 apoptosis, we used two murine cell lines, the BW5147 T cell lymphoma and a derivative of this line, PHAR2.1. The PHAR2.1 cell line was generated by mutagenesis and selection for resistance to the cytotoxic lectin phaseolus agglutinin-L that recognizes the oligosaccharide structure generated by GnT V (26.Trowbridge I. Hyman R. Ferson T. Mazauskas C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1978; 8: 716-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). BW5147 cells have high levels of GnT V activity, whereas PHAR2.1 cells lack GnT V activity (27.Cummings R.D. Trowbridge I.S. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13421-13427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, we have found that PHAR2.1 cells express the core 2 GnT, whereas BW5147 cells do not. These two cell lines allowed us to begin to define the oligosaccharide structures required for galectin-1-induced apoptosis. DISCUSSIONThere are several factors that may regulate susceptibility to galectin-1-induced cell death. First, differential expression of the glycosyltransferases that create the oligosaccharide structure(s) recognized by galectin-1 will modulate the susceptibility of cells to galectin-1. Glycosylation may control other forms of cell death as well. Keppler et al. (32.Keppler O.T. Peter M.E. Hinderlich G.M. Stehling P. Schmitz I. Schwartz-Albiez R. Reutter W. Pawlita M. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 557-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) showed that expression of the α-2,6-sialyltransferase regulated the susceptibility of B cell lines to Fas-induced apoptosis. Second, the oligosaccharide structures created by the glycosyltransferases must be linked to glycolipids or glycoproteins on the T cell surface that can transduce the death signal. Finally, the T cell must express the internal components of the apoptotic machinery for the galectin-1 death signal to be sent to completion.The aim of the present study was to identify the oligosaccharide ligands that participate in the transduction of the galectin-1 death signal by focusing on the enzymes that regulate polylactosamine synthesis, GnT V and the core 2 GnT. As shown in Fig. 1 C, BW5147 cells that did not express the core 2 GnT were not susceptible to galectin-1. In contrast, PHAR2.1 cells that expressed the core 2 GnT were highly susceptible to galectin-1. By 8 h, greater than 70% of cells died in response to galectin-1. Inhibition of O-glycan processing in PHAR2.1 cells resulted in a dramatic decrease in galectin-1-mediated death. Finally, overexpression of the core 2 GnT in BW5147 cells was sufficient to make these cells susceptible to galectin-1-induced death. These data demonstrated that the ligand created by the core 2 GnT is necessary for galectin-1-induced apoptosis in these murine T cell lines.The core 2 GnT is an intriguing candidate for regulating T cell susceptibility to galectin-1 during development in the thymus and as T cells function in the periphery. The core 2 GnT is highly expressed in DP thymocytes and activated peripheral T cells (23.Baum L.G. Pang M. Perillo N.L. Wu T. Delegeane A. Uittenbogaart C. Fukuda M. Seilhamer J.J. J. Exp.

As shown in Fig. 4 (C and D), we found increased galectin-1-induced cell death of DP thymocytes from the core 2 GnT transgenic mice compared with DP thymocytes from wild-type mice. This indicated that expression of the core 2 GnT could confer galectin-1 susceptibility to a subset of DP thymocytes. However, SP thymocytes from core 2 GnT transgenic mice remained insensitive to galectin-1 apoptosis. Therefore, expression of the core 2 GnT alone is not sufficient to render mature thymocytes susceptible to galectin-1 apoptosis.These data reveal that the regulation of galectin-1 susceptibility occurs at several cellular levels. Because overexpression of the core 2 GnT in mature SP thymocytes did not render these cells susceptible to galectin-1, SP thymocytes may not have the internal apoptotic machinery required for galectin-1-induced cell death. The intracellular galectin-1 death pathway may be blocked at some point, or a separate anti-apoptotic signal could override the galectin-1 death message.In contrast, DP thymocytes have the internal apoptotic pathway required for galectin-1-mediated cell death. If DP thymocytes express the core 2 GnT, galectin-1 binding can trigger the death pathway. However, in wild-type mice, a subset of DP thymocytes does not express the core 2 GnT and thus may not synthesize an essential galectin-1 ligand. Ellieset al. (31.Ellies L.G. Tao W. Fellinger W. Teh H.-S. Ziltener H.J. Blood. 1996; 88: 1725-1732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that expression of the core 2 GnT is down-regulated during positive selection of murine thymocytes. When we examined DP thymocytes from wild-type mice for expression of core 2O-glycans, there was a small population of DP thymocytes (approximately 25%) that had diminished expression of core 2O-glycans (Fig. 4 A). This fraction is roughly equivalent to the fraction of thymocytes from the core 2 GnT transgenic mice demonstrating increased susceptibility to galectin-1 (Fig.4 C). These data indicate that there is a subset of DP thymocytes that remains susceptible to galectin-1 if the saccharide ligand created by the core 2 GnT is expressed. Thus, our results suggest that in thymic development there is a narrow developmental window during which loss of core 2 GnT expression precedes down-regulation of the galectin-1 apoptotic machinery. The 20–60% increase in galectin-1-induced cell death of the DP thymocytes from the core 2 GnT mice compared with that from wild-type mice (Fig. 4,C and D) may appear modest. However, this difference could have a significant biological effect during the selection process, where the additional loss of DP thymocytes could adversely impact the total repertoire.Expression of specific T cell surface glycoproteins containing the core 2 O-linked oligosaccharides may be another factor regulating galectin-1-mediated apoptosis. The core 2 GnT is known to modify oligosaccharide structures on a number of T cell glycoproteins including CD43 and CD45 (30.Carlow D.A. Ardman B. Ziltener H.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 1441-1448PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Barran P. Fellinger W. Warren C.E. Dennis J.W. Ziltener H.J. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). CD45 and CD43 are heavily glycosylated proteins that are expressed at high levels on the surface of the BW5147 and PHAR2.1 cell lines (data not shown). Furthermore, regulated changes in the oligosaccharide structures that decorate CD45 and CD43 have been shown to occur during thymic development and T cell activation in the periphery (23.Baum L.G.

Stewart P.L. Baum L.G. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 3801-3811PubMed Google Scholar). Addition of core 2 O-glycans to CD45 or CD43 may allow the cross-linking and movement of these glycoproteins on the cell surface that occurs following galectin-1 binding (36.Pace K.E. Lee C. Stewart P.L. Baum L.G. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 3801-3811PubMed Google Scholar).The core GnT appears to play an important role in many immune processes. Expression of the core 2 GnT enzyme has recently been shown to be necessary for proper function of the innate immune system, since this enzyme can also regulate synthesis of ligands for the selectin family of cell adhesion molecules (37.Ellies L.G.

https://openalex.org/W2138955290,"Smads regulate transcription of defined genes in response to transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) receptor activation. This process involves functional cross-talk of Smads with transcription factors at responsive DNA elements to achieve maximal transcription activation and specificity. TGF-β has been shown to induce transcription of the germ line (GL) Ig α constant region gene and to direct class switching to IgA antibodies. It has been shown that acute myeloid leukemia (AML) transcription factors cooperate with Smad3 to stimulate transcription from the GL Ig α constant region gene promoter. We report here that the TGF-β-induced transcription from this promoter requires DNA binding of cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) to the nearby ATF/cAMP-response element site and of Smads to a nearby Smad binding sequence. At these sites, Smad3/4 cooperates with CREB to activate transcription in response to TGF-β, and disruption of either binding sequence abolished TGF-β-induced transcription. In addition, AML1 or AML2 also binds to the promoter and cooperates with Smad3/4, and in this way further enhances the TGF-β-induced transcriptional activation of the GL Ig α promoter. Thus, whereas Smad3/4, CREB, and AML family members bind independently to the respective DNA sequences in the GL Ig α promoter, functional synergy of Smads with CREB and AML proteins results in maximal TGF-β-induced transcription. Smads regulate transcription of defined genes in response to transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) receptor activation. This process involves functional cross-talk of Smads with transcription factors at responsive DNA elements to achieve maximal transcription activation and specificity. TGF-β has been shown to induce transcription of the germ line (GL) Ig α constant region gene and to direct class switching to IgA antibodies. It has been shown that acute myeloid leukemia (AML) transcription factors cooperate with Smad3 to stimulate transcription from the GL Ig α constant region gene promoter. We report here that the TGF-β-induced transcription from this promoter requires DNA binding of cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) to the nearby ATF/cAMP-response element site and of Smads to a nearby Smad binding sequence. At these sites, Smad3/4 cooperates with CREB to activate transcription in response to TGF-β, and disruption of either binding sequence abolished TGF-β-induced transcription. In addition, AML1 or AML2 also binds to the promoter and cooperates with Smad3/4, and in this way further enhances the TGF-β-induced transcriptional activation of the GL Ig α promoter. Thus, whereas Smad3/4, CREB, and AML family members bind independently to the respective DNA sequences in the GL Ig α promoter, functional synergy of Smads with CREB and AML proteins results in maximal TGF-β-induced transcription. germ line transforming growth factor-β acute myeloid leukemia TGF-β response element Smad binding element AML binding element glutathione S-transferase cAMP-response element CRE-binding protein CREB-binding protein core-binding factor A polyomavirus enhancer-binding protein 2α hemagglutinin During B cell differentiation, many B cells elaborate a process called class switching, whereby the initial synthesis of IgM antibodies is converted to the synthesis of IgD, IgG, IgE, or IgA antibodies of the same specificity. During the switch, the light chain and the variable region of the heavy chain of the antibody remain the same, but the heavy chain constant region changes, resulting in a change in effector function but not in specificity of the antibody. In embryonic cells, the genes for the constant regions of all kinds of heavy chains are located next to each other on the chromosome. Class switching occurs by an intrachromosomal recombination event that joins variable region genes with a gene for a constant region, Cδ, Cγ, Cε, or Cα, to form a functional heavy chain gene for IgD, IgG, IgE, or IgA antibody, respectively. This process appears to be directed by transcription of unrearranged or germ line (GL)1 transcripts of heavy chain constant region genes before switch recombination (1.Stavnezer J. Curr Opin Immunol. 1996; 8: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) regulates a broad range of biological activities, including the immune response (2.Letterio J.J. Roberts A.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 137-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1686) Google Scholar). In cultures of lipopolysaccharide-stimulated B cells, TGF-β induces transcription of the GL Ig α constant region gene and directs class switching to IgA antibodies (3.Lebman D.A. Nomura D.Y.

Previous work has shown that the promoter segment –128 to +46, relative to the first transcription initiation site for mouse GL Ig α transcripts, is sufficient for transcription and TGF-β-inducible expression in B cells (6.Lin Y.C. Stavnezer J. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2914-2925PubMed Google Scholar). Within this segment resides an ATF/CRE site that is very important for constitutive expression of the promoter and a TGF-β response element (TβRE) that is required for induction of transcription by TGF-β. The TβRE contains two copies of the Smad3/4 binding site (GTCT or AGAC) and two copies of a binding site for the acute myeloid leukemia (AML) family of transcription factors, also known as core-binding factor A (CBFA) or polyomavirus enhancer-binding protein 2α (PEBP2α) (7.Shi M.J. Stavnezer J. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6751-6760PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Xie X.Q. Pardali E. Holm M. Sideras P. Grundström T. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 488-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The signaling responses to TGF-β and related factors are mediated by a heteromeric cell surface complex of two types of transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptors and their intracellular signal transducers, the Smad proteins (9.Derynck R. Feng X.-H. Biochim. Biophys Acta. 1997; 1333: F105-F150Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 10.Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P.

Upon TGF-β binding to the receptor complex, Smad3 and the closely related Smad2 are phosphorylated by the type I receptor kinase at their C-terminal SSXS sequence. This phosphorylation event activates these Smads and allows them to dissociate from the receptor and to associate with Smad4. The Smad heteromeric complex, presumably a trimer, then moves into the nucleus to activate the transcription of target genes. The ability of the Smad complex to activate transcription results from its ability to directly interact with DNA in the promoter sequences and to functionally cooperate with other transcription factors (12.Derynck R. Zhang Y. Feng X.H. Cell. 1998; 95: 737-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). This dual requirement confers selectivity to promoters that represent targets for TGF-β and Smad signaling. Recently, it has been shown that Smads can bind directly to the TβRE and cooperate with AML proteins to stimulate transcription from the GL Ig α promoter (13.Hanai J. Chen L.F. Kanno T.

In this report, we demonstrate that the ATF/CRE site, which flanks the TβRE, is required for TGF-β-induced transcription from the GL Ig α promoter. At the promoter, CREB and Smad3 bind to adjacent sequences and synergize with each other to mediate TGF-β-induced transcription. The transcriptional response is further enhanced through the additional cooperativity of AML proteins with Smad3/4. Our results suggest a model whereby Smads cooperate with both AML and CREB for maximal TGF-β-induced transcription from the GL Ig α promoter. The pRK5-based expression plasmids for the constititutively active mouse TβRI (T202D) (15.Choy L. Derynck R. J. Biol.

Plasmid pRK5-HA-AML2, encoding N-terminally HA-tagged AML2, was generated by subcloning theBamHI fragment from pCMV5-AML2 into the BamHI site of pRKHA, a pRK5-derivative with the HA epitope tag (amino acids CYPYDVPDYASL) inserted into ClaI and EcoRI sites of pRK5. Plasmids pRSV and pRSV-CREB were provided by K. Yamamato. The cytomegalovirus promoter-driven pRK-HA-CREB was generated by inserting a polymerase chain reaction-generated full-length coding sequence for CREB into the EcoRI and SalI sites of pRK-HA. pRK-HA-ATF1 and pRK-HA-ATF2 were similarly generated by subcloningEcoRI/XbaI and BamHI fragments from pSG424-ATF1 and pGEX3X-ATF2, respectively (gifts from M. Green), into pRKHA. The pRK5-based expression plasmid for HA-tagged c-Jun has been described (17.Zhang Y. Feng X.H. Derynck R. Nature. 1998; 394: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). The bacterial expression plasmids pGEX-Smad3NL and pGEX-Smad4NL, used to express GST-fused Smad fragments, were described before (17.Zhang Y. Feng X.H. Derynck R. Nature. 1998; 394: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). pGEX-CREB and pGEX-AML1, which express CREB or AML1 fused to GST, were constructed by subcloning the CREB or AML1 full-length coding sequence into the EcoRI/SalI site of pGEX-5X-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). pCα179-Luc, containing the –179 to +46 region of the mouse germ line Ig α constant region gene promoter, was kindly provided by J.

Transfections of HepG2 cells were done in six-well dishes using Fugene 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Transfection of A20.3 B lymphoma cells (provided by J. Stavnezer) were done in six-well dishes using LipofectAMINE plus (Life Technology). Per transfection, 5 ng of each expression plasmid (0.25 μg of each in A20.3 cells), 0.5 μg of luciferase reporter plasmid, and 10 ng of pSVβgal (Promega) plasmid were used. The total plasmid concentrations were kept constant, and, whenever needed, vector DNA was added. 12 h after transfection, cells were treated with or without 5 ng/ml TGF-β1 in medium containing 0.2% fetal bovine serum. After 16–20 h, the cells were lysed, and luciferase and β-galactosidase activity were measured as described (18.Feng X.H. Derynck R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3912-3923Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). All luciferase values were normalized for transfection efficiency against the β-galactosidase levels. Gel mobility assays were done using the gel shift assay kit (Promega). The GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified using glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In vitrotranslated proteins were synthesized by coupled SP6-driven transcription and translation using rabbit reticulocyte lysate (TNT SP6 quick translation kit, Promega). Each gel shift reaction contained 0.1 μg of purified GST fusion protein in 1 μl of glutathione elution buffer or 1 μl of in vitro translated protein from the TNT reaction. After 10–15 min preincubation at room temperature, 1 μl of32P-labeled probe (35,000–50,000 cpm/0.035 pmol) was added to a 10-μl final volume and incubated for another 20–25 min. The complex was separated on a 5% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE buffer and visualized by autoradiography. For gel mobility shifts and supershifts using nuclear extracts of transfected cells, 293 cells in 10-cm dishes were transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE (Life Technology) as described. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described (19.Liu F. Pouponnot C. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3157-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). For each gel shift reaction, 2 μl of extract, containing approximately 1 μg/μl of protein, was used. For each supershift analysis, 1 μl of antibodies against Smad3 (H2), Myc (9E10), or CREB (240) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, or HA (12CA4) from Roche Molecular Biochemicals was added to the reaction after incubation with32P-labeled probe for 20 min, and the incubation proceeded at 4 °C for 90 min. TGF-β induces transcription from the GL Ig α constant region gene promoter and increases class switching to IgA in splenic B cells and in sIgM+ B lymphoma cells (3.Lebman D.A. Nomura D.Y.

Previous studies have defined the mouse GL Ig α promoter segment between –128 and +46, relative to the first transcription initiation site, as sufficient for constitutive and TGF-β-induced transcription of a reporter gene in B cells (6.Lin Y.C. Stavnezer J. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2914-2925PubMed Google Scholar). Within this segment, a TβRE has been identified as a sequence required for TGF-β-induced transcription. This 34-base pair sequence, shown in Fig.1 A, is located at positions –128 to –105 upstream from the first transcription start site and contains two copies of the consensus AML/CBFA binding sites ACCAGA and two copies of the proposed optimal Smad3/4 binding site (GTCT or AGAC). The TβRE is proximally flanked with an ATF/CRE site TGACGTGG at positions –103 to –96, i.e. separated by only one base pair from the TβRE (Fig. 1 A). This ATF/CRE site has been shown to be important for constitutive transcription from this promoter (6.Lin Y.C. Stavnezer J. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2914-2925PubMed Google Scholar). As a first step in defining the contributions of different transcription factors in TGF-β-induced transcription from this promoter, we inserted the GL Ig α promoter sequence from position –132 to –94 immediately upstream from a minimal TATA box promoter and measured transcription activity of this reporter in HepG2 cells. Similarly to B cells, HepG2 cells express Smad3, Smad4, CREB, AML1, and AML2, as assessed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (data not shown). In the absence of TGF-β, this promoter in reporter plasmid –132/–94α TAluc was about 3-fold more active than the minimal promoter in TAluc. TGF-β strongly induced transcription from the –132/–94α TAluc promoter to a level that was comparable to pCα179, a luciferase reporter containing the GL Ig α promoter segment from –179 to +77. However, the basal transcription level of the –132/–94α TAluc was lower than that of the –179 to +77 promoter segment (Fig. 1 B). These data strongly suggest that the –132 to –94 promoter segment, which contains both the TβRE and the ATF/CRE sites, is sufficient to confer full TGF-β inducibility. To determine the roles of the TβRE and the ATF/CRE sites in TGF-β-induced transcription, we constructed two promoter/reporter plasmids that deleted or inactivated either the TβRE or the ATF/CRE site, respectively (Fig. 1 A). As shown in Fig.1 B, deletion of the TβRE, without affecting the ATF/CRE site, in the –106/–94α promoter abolished the TGF-β response. Similarly, inactivation of the ATF/CRE site, without affecting the TβRE, also abrogated the TGF-β-induced responsiveness from the –132/–94αmCRE promoter. We therefore conclude that both the TβRE and the ATF/CRE sites are required for TGF-β inducibility. This simultaneous requirement for two distinct and independent DNA binding elements suggests that Smad and ATF/CREB complexes cooperate to mediate TGF-β-activated transcription from the GL Ig α promoter. Members of ATF/CREB family of transcription factors contain a DNA binding basic region and a leucine zipper dimerization domain that is conserved in several nuclear factors, including Jun, Fos, and Myc (20.Ziff E.B. Trends Genet. 1990; 6: 69-72Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The well characterized members of the ATF/CREB family are CREB, ATF1, and ATF2, and they are all expressed in antibody producing B-cells. All three factors were able to bind to the ATF/CRE sequence and to the combined TβRE-ATF/CRE sequence (–132/–94) of the GL Ig α promoter, but not to the TβRE (Fig. 2 A). As a negative control, c-Jun, a member of the basic leucine zipper domain containing AP-1 family of transcription factors, was unable to bind to the ATF/CRE sequence. We next tested the abilities of these ATF/CREB factors to activate transcription from the –132/–94 promoter in the absence or presence of TGF-β (Fig. 2 B). Whereas ATF1 and ATF2 had no effect, CREB expression conferred a high level of TGF-β-inducible transcription. It is well documented that at the ATF/CRE sequence, CREB and ATF1 form homo- or heterodimers through their leucine zipper regions, whereas ATF2 forms a heterodimer with c-Jun (21.Dwarki V.J. Montminy M. Verma I.M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 22.Hai T. Curran T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3720-3724Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar, 23.Karin M. Smeal T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 418-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the effect of combinations of these basic leucine zipper transcription factors in the transcription reporter assay. Coexpression of CREB and ATF1 did not increase transcription above the CREB-mediated transcription level, and combination of c-Jun with ATF1 or ATF2 did not increase transcription compared with c-Jun alone (Fig.2 B). Our results thus indicate that CREB can activate transcription from the ATF/CRE site of the GL Ig α promoter. Because CREB binds to DNA and exerts its activity primarily as homodimer (21.Dwarki V.J. Montminy M. Verma I.M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), the ability of CREB to activate transcription from the GL Ig α promoter is unlikely to require other ATF/CREB factors. We next evaluated the ability of CREB to cooperate with Smad3 or Smad3/4. Smad3 expression activated transcription about 30-fold, and TGF-β enhanced this response to a 2000-fold level (Fig.2 C). Consistent with the central role of Smad4 as coactivator in signal transduction by receptor-activated Smads (24.Lagna G. Hata A. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massagué J. Nature. 1996; 383: 832-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar,25.Zhang Y. Musci T. Derynck R. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 270-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), coexpression of Smad4 with Smad3 resulted in a much stronger transcriptional activation than the response to Smad3 or Smad4 individually. CREB was able to synergize with Smad3, and maximal transcription activity was observed when CREB, Smad3, and Smad4 were expressed together. Coexpression of c-Jun or ATF1 or ATF2 with CREB, Smad3, and Smad4 together decreased the CREB/Smad3/Smad4 activity (data not shown), which is consistent with the notion that CREB binds to the ATF/CRE site as a homodimer (21.Dwarki V.J. Montminy M. Verma I.M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Smad3 and Smad4, but not Smad2, have the ability to bind DNA (26.Zawel L. Dai J.L. Buckhaults P. Zhou S.

Cell. 1998; 94: 585-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). The DNA binding is mediated by the N-terminal domain. As shown in Fig. 3 A,both GST-fused Smad3NL and Smad4NL bound to the –132/–94 Ig α promoter sequence. Consistent with published data, the Smad3NL·DNA complex migrated as a single band, whereas the Smad4NL·DNA complex separated as multiple bands (26.Zawel L. Dai J.L. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). Whereas Smad3NL and Smad4NL bound to the TβRE sequence in the promoter, they did not bind to the ATF/CRE oligonucleotide. There are two copies of the proposed optimal Smad3/4 binding site (GTCT or AGAC) located in the TβRE sequence of the GL Ig α promoter. Mutations that have been shown to inactivate Smad binding (26.Zawel L. Dai J.L. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar, 27.Yingling J.M. Datto M.B. Wong C. Frederick J.P. Liberati N.T. Wang X.F. Mol. Cell.

As shown in Fig. 3 B, inactivation of SBE1 caused a moderate decrease of the TGF-β- and Smad3-induced transcription. However, SBE2 inactivation severely decreased the TGF-β responsiveness and abolished the transcriptional induction by Smad3, thus identifying the SBE2 site as the major Smad binding site. Although Smad3 and Smad4 did not bind to the ATF/CRE site (Fig. 3 A), mutation of the ATF/CRE site also severely decreased Smad3-induced transcription (Fig.3 B), similar to the effect of this mutation on TGF-β-induced transcription (Fig. 1 B). On the other hand, the ability of CREB to enhance TGF-β-induced transcription also required the Smad binding site. Mutation of SBE2 diminished TGF-β-induced transcription but not the transcription activation by CREB in the absence of TGF-β(Fig. 3 B). Taken together, these results indicate that Smads cooperate with CREB to enhance the transcription from GL Ig α promoter upon TGF-β stimulation and that DNA binding of Smad and CREB is required for their cooperation. We next assessed the ability of Smad3/4 and CREB to bind to the TGF-β-responsive –132/–94 GL Ig α promoter sequence in gel shift assays using nuclear extracts prepared from transfected cells. TGF-β receptor activation induced the formation of a gel-shifted band with a slightly slower mobility than the constitutive band (Fig.3 C). This inducible band was supershifted by an antibody against Smad3 and further supershifted in the presence of both anti-Smad3 and anti-Smad4(Myc) antibodies, thus indicating that the Smad3/4 complex interacts with the promoter segment. Addition of CREB-specific antibodies supershifted primarily the DNA-protein complex that was not induced by TGF-β receptor activation, without major effect on the TGF-β-inducible complex. Addition of anti-Smad antibody did not result in an additional shift of the anti-CREB antibody-supershifted complex (Fig. 3 C). These results suggest that both Smad3/4 and CREB bind independently to the promoter segment. The DNA binding of Smad3 and CREB was also analyzed using purified GST fusion proteins. As shown in Fig. 3 D(left) and as expected, Smad3NL and CREB both bound individually to the –132/–94 Ig α promoter segment with its TβRE and ATF/CRE sequences. Coincubation of CREB and Smad3NL did not result in competition for each other's binding or in the formation of an additional band. However, when an excess amount of Smad3NL was used in the experiment, the formation of an additional, slower migrating complex was observed (Fig. 3 D, right). This result suggests that Smad3 and CREB can bind simultaneously to the DNA, but their binding does not involve a high affinity physical association between Smad3 and CREB. This is consistent with our inability to coimmunoprecipitate Smad3 with CREB in transfected cells (data not shown) using conditions that allowed coprecipitation of c-Jun with Smad3 (17.Zhang Y. Feng X.H. Derynck R. Nature. 1998; 394: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). In addition to Smad binding sites, the TβRE contains two proposed binding sites (ABE1 and ABE2) for the AML family of transcription factors, also known as CBFA or PEBP2α (7.Shi M.J. Stavnezer J. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6751-6760PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Xie X.Q. Pardali E. Holm M. Sideras P. Grundström T. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 488-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This family consists of three highly conserved proteins, AML1 (or CBFA2/PEBP2αB), AML2 (or CBFA3/PEBP2αC), and AML3 (or CBFA1/PEBP2αA) (30.Levanon D. Negreanu V. Bernstein Y. Bar-Am I. Avivi L. Groner Y. Genomics. 1994; 23: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Although all AML proteins can bind and activate transcription through the same promoter binding sequence, the expression pattern of the different AML proteins depends on the cell type. AML3 (CBFA1) is most abundant in osteoblasts, plays an essential role in osteoblast-specific gene expression, and is not expressed in pre-B and surface IgM+ (sI"
https://openalex.org/W2005389122,"The sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium-ATPase (SERCA) translocates Ca2+ from the cytosol to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. This Ca2+ storage is important for cellular processes such as calcium signaling and endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated posttranslational protein modifications. We investigated the expression of the SERCA2 and SERCA3 isozymes in PC12 cells exposed to agents interfering with different aspects of the posttranslational protein processing within the ER, thereby activating the ER stress-induced unfolded protein response (UPR). All agents increased the SERCA2b mRNA level 3–4-fold, in parallel with increasing mRNA levels for the ER stress marker proteins BiP/GRP78 and CHOP/GADD153. In contrast, SERCA3 mRNA levels did not change. SERCA2b mRNA stability was not changed, indicating that the mechanism of its up-regulation was transcriptional, in accordance with the presence of ER stress response elements in the promoter region of the SERCA2 gene. SERCA2b was also increased at the protein level upon ER stress treatments. Induction of ER stress by tunicamycin, dithiothreitol, or l-azetidine 2-carboxylic acid did not result in depletion of ER calcium, showing that such depletion was not necessary for up-regulation of SERCA2b expression or UPR activation in general. We conclude that the SERCA2b expression can be controlled by the UPR pathway independently of ER Ca2+depletion.

Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6188) Google Scholar), cell growth, and proliferation (2.Ghosh T.K. Bian J., H. Short A.D. Rybak S.L. Gill D.L. J. Biol.

BioEssays. 1995; 17: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar), as well as synthesis, posttranslational processing, folding and export of proteins synthesized on ER-associated ribosomes (4.Lodish H.F.

The maturation of the newly translocated polypeptide chains within the ER lumen is accomplished by transient interactions with ER chaperones (such as calreticulin, calnexin, BiP/GRP78, GRP94, and others) (7.Hammond C. Helenius A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar, 8.Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1944) Google Scholar). The requirement for Ca2+ as a co-factor for proper ER protein processing and maturation presumably results from the Ca2+binding capacities and Ca2+ -dependent interactions of the chaperones in the ER lumen (9.Corbett E.F. Oikawa K. Francois P. Tessier D.C. Kay C. Bergeron J.J.M. Thomas D.Y. Krause K.-H. Michalak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6203-6211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The resting intra-ER free Ca2+ concentration is 3–4 orders of magnitude higher than the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) (10.Meldolesi J. Pozan T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 10-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). This gradient is generated by the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPases (SERCAs), encoded by three homologous genes (SERCA1, SERCA2, and SERCA3) (11.Burk S.E. Lytton J. MacLennan D.H. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18561-18568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transcripts from all three genes undergo alternative splicing in a developmentally and tissue-specific manner, giving rise to a number of isozymes differing in their C-terminal regions. The splicing of the primary transcripts from SERCA1 and SERCA2 genes produces SERCA1a-b (12.Brandl C.J. deLeon S. Martin D.R. MacLennan D.H.. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3768-3774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and SERCA2a-b isozymes (13.Gunteski-Hamblin A.-M. Greeb J. Shull G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15032-15040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Lytton J. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15024-15031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SERCA1a-b and SERCA2a expression is restricted to skeletal and cardiac muscles, whereas the SERCA2b isoform is ubiquitously expressed in all nonmuscle tissues (15.Wu K.-D. Lee W.-S. Wey J. Bundgard D. Lytton J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C775-C784Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, SERCA3 transcripts were found to be spliced too, resulting in three isozymes in mice and humans (SERCA3a, SERCA3b, and SERCA3c) (16.Dode L. De Greef C. Mountian I. Attard M. Town M.M. Casteels R. Wuytack F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13982-13994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and two isozymes in rats (SERCA3a and SERCA3b/c) (11.Burk S.E. Lytton J. MacLennan D.H. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18561-18568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Martin V. Bredoux R. Corvazier E. Papp B. Enouf J. Hypertension. 2000; 35: 91-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). SERCA3 is expressed in a number of nonmuscle tissues at variable levels, always coexpressed with SERCA2b (15.Wu K.-D. Lee W.-S. Wey J. Bundgard D. Lytton J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C775-C784Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Launay S. Bobe R. Lacabaratz-Porret C. Bredoux R. Kovàcs T. Enouf J. Papp B. J. Biol.

At present, the full physiological significance of this heterogeneity among the SERCA isozymes remains unclear. When unfolded proteins accumulate in the ER, a conserved eukaryotic stress response pathway known as unfolded protein response (UPR) is activated (8.Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1944) Google Scholar, 20.Kozutsumi Y. Segal M. Normington K. Gething M.J. Sambrook J.

This response amplifies the protein folding capacity in the ER through an enhanced expression of the ER-resident chaperones (such as BiP), thus counteracting congestion of misfolded protein intermediates and promoting cell survival (22.Morris J.A. Dorner A.J. Edwards C.A. Hendershot L.M. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4327-4334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 23.Little E. Lee A.S. J. Biol.

Ire1p, residing in the ER membrane and displaying both serine/threonine kinase and endonuclease activities, appears to function as the sensor of the accumulation of unfolded proteins and to activate the signal that enhances the transcription of chaperone genes in yeast (24.Chapman R. Sidrauski C. Walter P. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 459-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) as well as mammals (25.Tirasophon W. Welihinda A.A. Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1812-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar, 26.Wang X.Z. Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Jolicoer E.M. Kuroda M. Ron D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5708-5717Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Recently, stress inducibility of the chaperone genes in higher eukaryotes was shown to require the presence of a 19-base pair long regulatory elements termed ER stress response elements (ERSEs) in their promoters (27.Yoshida H. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33741-33749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar, 28.Roy B. Lee A.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1437-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). In addition to chaperone up-regulation, several other signals emerge from the stressed ER, including induction of a growth arrest/cell death-promoting transcription factor C/EBP homology protein (CHOP, also known as growth arrest and DNA damage protein 153) (29.Wang X.Z. Lawson B. Brewer J.W. Zinszner H. Sanjay A. Mi L.J. Boorstein R. Kreibich G. Hendershot L.M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4273-4280Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar), and in a number of cases, protein synthesis is transiently down-regulated because of phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α by the dedicated kinases PKR-like ER kinase (30.Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Ron D. Nature. 1999; 397: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (2558) Google Scholar) and possibly PKR (31.Brostrom C.O. Brostrom M.A. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 58: 79-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Here we present results showing a strong correlation between induction of the UPR pathway and an elevated expression of SERCA2b, but not SERCA3, at the mRNA and protein levels. Depletion of ER calcium was not a necessary condition for UPR activation nor for the up-regulation of SERCA2b. Together with the presence of putative functional ERSE elements in the promoter region of SERCA2 gene, these results provide evidence for a new aspect of SERCA2b function, manifested by its ability to act as a member of the ER stress protein family. PC12 cells were provided by Dr. S. Gammeltoft (Copenhagen County Glostrup Hospital). RINm5F cells were provided by Dr. K. Josefsen (Bartholin Institute, Copenhagen). Thapsigargin was a gift from Dr. S. B. Christensen (Royal Danish School of Pharmacy). Immune sera against SERCA2b and SERCA3 were generously provided by Dr. Frank Wuytack (Leuven, Belgium).l-[4,5-3H]-leucine, methyl-[3H]thymidine, [α-32P]dCTP, [γ-32P]ATP, and autoradiography films were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Fetal bovine serum, horse serum, and cell culture media were from Life Technologies, Inc. PC12 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 25 mm Hepes, 4500 mg/liter glucose supplemented with 6% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 6% (v/v) heat-inactivated horse serum, 18 μg streptomycin/ml, and 18 units penicillin/ml. RINm5F cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium, 25 mm Hepes supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 18 μg streptomycin/ml and 18 units penicillin/ml. Cells were passaged once every week. Compounds to be added to the cells in culture medium were prepared as stock solutions concentrated 1000-fold in Me2SO (thapsigargin, A23187, tunicamycin, brefeldin A, actinomycin D), 100-fold in water (l-azetidine 2-carboxylic acid, EGTA), or 1000-fold in water (cycloheximide, DTT). The EGTA stock was adjusted to pH 9.16 to counter the pH fall upon its addition. Equivalent volumes of Me2SO or water were added to control cell batches. Final agent concentrations are given in the figure legends. RNA isolated from rat cerebellum or PC12 cells was used for cDNA cloning. cDNA fragments were amplified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using Ready To Go, Specific, or Poly-dT Primed First Strand cDNA Synthesis kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. For the polymerase chain reaction, the following primers were used (GenBankTM accession numbers in parentheses): GAPDH (X02231), 5′-ATGACTCTACCCACGGCAAG-3′, 5′-CCACAGTCTTCTGAGTGGCA-3′; SERCA3 (M30501), 5′-GGCCCTCAAGTATCTGTCCA-3′, 5′-GAAGCTGAGCCAAGTGGAAG-3′; SERCA2b (J04022), 5′-TATTGGCTGGTGAAGGAGGT-3′, 5′-GGTGACAGAGGCTGAGGGT-3′; BiP (M14050), 5′-AGCCCACCGTAACAATCAAG-3′, 5′-TCCAGCCATTCGATCTTTTC-3′; CHOP (U30186) 5′-AGCTGAGTCTCTGCCTTTCG-3′, 5′-TGTGGTCTCTACCTCCCTGG-3′; and HSP70 (X77208) 5′-TGCTGATCCAGGTGTACGAG-3′, 5′-GCTGATCTTGCCCTTGAGAC-3′. The amplified cDNAs were cloned into the pMOSblue T-vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and sequenced by dideoxy sequencing. Polymerase chain reaction-amplified cDNA inserts were gel purified and used as probes. Probes were labeled using Ready To Go DNA labeling beads, purified using Probe Quant reagents kits (both from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and denatured in 0.1 m NaOH at 37 °C for 10 min prior to addition to hybridization solution. GAPDH probes with a 10-fold reduced specific activity were used when cohybridized with the SERCA3 and SERCA2b probes. PC12 or RINm5F cells were seeded on rat tail collagen-coated 100-mm dishes (3.5 μg collagen/cm2). Total RNA was isolated by a modified acid/phenol procedure (32.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar), where the RNA was solubilized and stored in formamide after drying the final RNA pellet. RNA samples were run on a formaldehyde-agarose gel, transferred to nylon membranes (Hybond N, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and fixed by UV light according to standard procedures (33.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar). Proper transfer of RNA was assured by staining the nylon membrane in 0.03% (w/v) methylene blue in 0.3m NaCH3 COO (pH 5.3). RNA size standards (Life Technologies, Inc.) (0.24, 1.35, 2.37, 4.4, 7.46, and 9.49 kb) were used to determine mRNA size. Each Northern blot was washed 15 min at 65 °C in the hybridization solution (0.25 mNa2HPO4, pH 7.1, 1 mm EDTA, 7% (w/v) SDS) and probed overnight in the hybridization solution at 65 °C with [α-32P]dCTP-labeled probe. The blot was then washed by adding a 65 °C hot wash solution (50 mmNa2HPO4, pH 7.1, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5% SDS), and the wash was continued at room temperature with four changes, each of 10-min duration. The blot was autoradiographed on the Hyperfilm MP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 5 h to 2 days. Some of the Northern blots were stripped in boiling 0.1% (w/v) SDS before reprobing. Quantitation was obtained by digital scanning of the films using the NIH Scion Image program. Total cellular protein lysates were prepared in 20 mm Tes (pH 7.4), 4% SDS, 1% DTT, 1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol. 15 or 50 μg protein/lane was run on a 7% SDS-PAGE (34.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Nitrocellulose membranes were blocked at 4 °C for 5 h. Blocking before the SERCA2b detection was in 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk (milk), 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS (10 mmNa2HPO4, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl). Blocking before the SERCA3 detection was in 45% (w/v) fetal bovine serum, 10% milk, and 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% Triton X-100, 1% Tween 20 (all v/v) in TBS (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl). SERCA2b antiserum (35.Wuytack Frank Eggermont J.A. Raeymaekers L. Plessers L Casteels R. Biochem.

The blots were incubated overnight at 4 °C with agitation. The blots were washed four times for 5 min in 0.1% Tween 20, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.2% (w/v) SDS in PBS (wash buffer) at room temperature. The secondary anti-rabbit antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad) was diluted 1:17,000 (for SERCA2b staining) or 1:10,000 (for SERCA3 staining) in 0.1% Tween 20, 5% milk in PBS, incubated with agitation 2 h at room temperature, and washed in the wash buffer. Western blots were stained by a chemiluminescence method using a staining solution consisting of luminol (3.9 mm), hydrogen peroxide (7.8 mm), p-iodophenol (2.5 mm) (all in 100 mm Tris, pH 8.5) and SSC (2.5×). ECL-Hyperfilm was exposed for 15–30 s. Films were quantitated as described above. These procedures were each carried out on a portion of the same pool of cells. 3 × 106 PC12 cells were treated for 8 h with the indicated stressor, resuspended in 5 ml of the medium in which they had been cultured, and finally divided into four tubes. 2 ml of cells were centrifuged at 100 × g for 10 min at room temperature. The supernatant was discarded, and the remaining cells were centrifuged in leucine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and resuspended in 2 ml of leucine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with the same stress agent as used prior to harvesting, and 2.5 μl (18 pmol) ofl-[4,5-3H]-leucine. Cells were labeled for 7 min at 37 °C. Labeling was stopped by addition of 1 ml of 0.1m NaOH, after which the tube was cooled on ice. Macromolecules were precipitated by 5 ml of ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid, and the pellet was washed three times with 5 ml of ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid. Finally the pellet was solubilized in 0.25 m NaOH and counted by liquid scintillation. 1 ml of cells were labeled with 2 μl (80 pmol) of methyl-[3H]thymidine. The labeling reaction was stopped after 15 min at 37 °C by 1 ml of 0.1 m NaOH, after which the tube was transferred to ice. Macromolecules were precipitated and washed, and the radioactivity was counted as described above. A 150-μl aliquot was taken out for cell counting and viability test. Cells were mixed 1:1 with 0.4% (w/v) trypan blue in PBS. After 2 min at room temperature, dead (blue) and live (not stained) cells were counted in a hemocytometer. PC12 cells cultured on polylysine-coated (100 μg/ml) glass coverslips were loaded for 30 min at 37 °C with 5 μm fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester and 0.04% pluronic F-127 (Molecular Probes) in EM solution (145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 20 mm Hepes, 3 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 100 μmsulfinpyrazon). The coverslip was then transferred to a solution consisting of 75% (v/v) EM solution with 25% (v/v) culture medium for additional 30 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The coverslip was placed in a 37 °C thermostated chamber (PH1 and TC344A, Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT) with 75% (v/v) EM solution and 25% (v/v) culture medium. For measurements in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, cells were washed three times in Ca2+-free extracellular solution. Ca2+-free extracellular solution was EM solution with no Ca2+ added (nominally Ca2+-free) or nominally Ca2+-free EM solution supplemented with 25 μm EGTA, as indicated in the figure legends. Dual excitation single emission fluorescence ratio imaging was performed using a system composed of the following: light from a high intensity source (XBO 75 W, OSRAM, Berlin, Germany) was passed via a monochromator (FL3095, J & M, Analytische Mess, Frankfurt, Germany), programmed to pass light of 340 and 380 nm. This light was transmitted into an inverted microscope (Nikon Diaphot 300), containing a 405-nm dichroic mirror and 510-nm long pass emission filter. Cells were imaged using a 40× lens (Zeiss Fluar, 40/1.30 oil). Emitted light was collected by a high resolution image intensifier coupled to a video camera (GenIIsys, CCD-72EX, DAGE-MTI, Michigan City, IN). The signal output from the camera was connected to a digital image-processing board (Matrox, MVP-AT) controlled by IMAGE-1/FL software (Universal Imaging, West Chester, PA). The digitized signal output from cells excited at each wavelength with an interval of 5 s was processed on-line (four frame average) to yield a ratio image map. [Ca2+]i values were collected from within the camera field as averaged signals from a circular measurement window placed over each cell. The ratio values were converted to intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) by means of the formula of Grynkiewicz et al. (37.Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Following harvesting and centrifugation, cells were washed once in PBS and resuspended in 20 mm Tes (pH 7.0) and sucrose 300 mm (HB). Cells were broken by means of a cell cracker from the European Molecular Biology Laboratory workshop (38.Balch W.E. Dunphy W.G. Braell W.A. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1984; 39: 405-416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar), employing the clearance of 12 μm and 10 passages. The homogenates were centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g, followed by centrifugation of the supernatants for 60 min at 100,000 × g. The microsomal pellets were resuspended in HB and stored at −80 °C. ATPase phosphorylation was carried out as described earlier (“standard assay”) (39.Caspersen C. Treiman M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We have challenged PC12 cells with different agents sharing the ability to induce the mammalian UPR and measured the level of SERCA2b and SERCA3 mRNAs on Northern blots. The SERCA2b probe hybridized with the 4.5-, 6-, and 8-kb alternative splice variants of SERCA2b mRNA, differing in their 3′-untranslated region (11.Burk S.E. Lytton J. MacLennan D.H. Shull G.E. J.

Fig.1 A shows that after a 6-h exposure, the agents known to perturb and deplete intra-ER Ca2+ (thapsigargin, A23187, or EGTA) all induced an increase in the SERCA2b mRNA level relative to control cells exposed to the appropriate vehicle (Me2SO or water). Thapsigargin is an inhibitor of SERCA pumps (40.Treiman M. Caspersen C. Christensen S.B. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1998; 19: 131-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar), A23187 is an ionophore known to collapse divalent cation gradients (41.Bers D.M. MacLeod K.T. Baker P.F. Calcium in Drug Actions: Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology. 83. Springer-Verlag, Berlin Heidelberg1988: 491-507Google Scholar), whereas EGTA treatment chelates extracellular Ca2+, thereby promoting Ca2+ efflux from the cell and ER. The level of SERCA3 mRNA was not changed by these agents (Fig. 1 B). In addition, tunicamycin, DTT, l-azetidine-2-carboxylic acid (Azc), and brefeldin A (BFA) also induced an increase in the SERCA2b, but not the SERCA3, mRNA level (Fig. 1, A andB). Tunicamycin is an inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation (42.Helenius A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). DTT perturbs the unique oxidative milieu of the ER lumen, thereby inhibiting the disulphide bond-dependent protein folding (43.Braakman I. Helenius J. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1717-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Azc is a proline analog that is incorporated into proteins and causes their misfolding (44.Li W.W. Hsiung Y. Zhou Y. Roy B. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 54-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). BFA is an inhibitor of the transport from ER to Golgi, leading to an absorption of the Golgi apparatus into the ER (45.Sciaky N. Presley J. Smith C. Zaal K.J.M. Cole N. Moreira J.E. Terasaki M. Siggia E. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1137-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). The treatments did not cause any major changes in the yield of total isolated RNA, except for Azc, which decreased the RNA yield to 50–60% of controls. Fig. 1 Cshows the quantitation of the relative levels of mRNA for SERCA2b and SERCA3, as normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). As a positive control of the UPR induction, we monitored BiP and CHOP mRNA levels in PC12 cells exposed to stressors. Panels Dand E in Fig. 1 show Northern blots of the same total RNA as analyzed in panels A and B, hybridized to BiP and CHOP probes. The pattern of BiP induction resembled the induction of SERCA2b mRNA, except for the induction magnitude (up to 10-fold, quantitation not shown) compared with 3–4-fold of SERCA2b (Fig.1 C). CHOP mRNA was not detectable in control cells but was induced by all the stressors, with the level of CHOP mRNA induction highly dependent on the particular stressor. CHOP induction by DTT at 6 h was very weak and is better appreciated at 1 or 2 h of DTT treatment (Fig.2 D). To further characterize the SERCA2b mRNA induction we compared the time course with that of BiP and CHOP. Fig.2 A shows an autoradiogram of a SERCA2b-probed Northern blot with total RNA isolated from cells treated for 1, 2, 4, or 8 h with EGTA or DTT. Fig. 2 C shows a corresponding Northern blot hybridized with a BiP probe. Both BiP and SERCA2b were induced in 1–2 h, consistent with the described pattern of BiP induction (46.Resendez E. Ting J. Kim K.S. Wooden S.K. Lee A.S. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2145-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). For both SERCA2b and BiP maximum was reached in about 2 h with DTT and 4 h with EGTA. The same overall kinetics was found for tunicamycin and A23187 (not shown). Longer stress periods (up to 24 h) did not increase SERCA2b mRNA level further. Fig.2 B shows an autoradiogram of SERCA3-probed Northern blot, demonstrating that SERCA3 mRNA level did not change in response to DTT or EGTA after 1, 2, 4, or 8 h. The time course of the CHOP mRNA induction (Fig. 2 D) appeared faster than for the BiP or SERCA2b mRNA. CHOP mRNA level reached a maximum in the presence of DTT within 1 h and was decreasing thereafter to become undetectable after 8 h. However, addition of fresh DTT after 4 h led to an increase in the CHOP mRNA after 8 h to the same level as at 4 h (not shown), indicating that the decreasing CHOP mRNA response to DTT, at least in part, was the result of the inactivation of DTT. To test whether the increase in SERCA2b mRNA levels was reversible and reinducible, cells were treated with EGTA for 4 h, after which the medium was changed to control medium for 20 h, to be followed again by EGTA treatment for 4 h. As shown in Fig.3, SERCA2b, CHOP, and BiP responses were reversible and could be reinduced after 20 h of reconstitution in control medium. Both BiP and SERCA2b mRNA levels remained elevated for 2 and 4 h after the withdrawal of the stressor (Fig. 3, time points 6–8 and 30–32 h), after which they returned to the basal level (time point 24 h). In contrast to BiP and SERCA2b, CHOP mRNA level responded much more promptly to the application and withdrawal of EGTA (Fig. 3). Notably, for all three mRNA types, the second response to the stressor appeared less pronounced than the first one. A characteristic feature of the UPR is the requirement of protein synthesis for the transcriptional induction of BiP mRNA (46.Resendez E. Ting J. Kim K.S. Wooden S.K. Lee A.S. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2145-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 A shows that neither tunicamycin nor A23187 were able to induce the SERCA2b mRNA in the presence of cycloheximide, demonstrating that protein synthesis was necessary for stress-mediated SERCA2b mRNA induction. Fig. 4 B shows that actinomycin D, an inhibitor of transcription (47.Wadkins R.M. Jovin T.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9469-9478Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), could prevent the A23187 or tunicamycin-mediated elevation of SERCA2b mRNA. To test whether SERCA2b mRNA is stabilized under the conditions of ER stress, cells were incubated in the presence of tunicamycin or the vehicle for 4 h, following which (Fig. 4 C, time 0) each medium was replaced with a similar one except for the addition of actinomycin D. Fig. 4 C shows that after 6 h in the presence of actinomycin D, the SERCA2b mRNA decreased in both control and tunicamycin-treated cells. Quantitation showed a decline to about 40% of the level before addition of actinomycin D. Without the addition of actinomycin D the SERCA2b mRNA was increasing throughout the tunicamycin treatment (not shown). Total RNA yield decreased after 6 h of actinomycin D treatment to 60–80% of control in bot"

Phosphorylation of the 18-kDa subunit, in response to cholera toxin treatment of fibroblasts, was accompanied by a 2–3-fold enhancement of the rotenone-sensitive endogenous respiration of fibroblasts, of the rotenone-sensitive NADH oxidase, and of the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase activity of complex I. Direct exposure of fibroblasts to dibutyryl cAMP resulted in an equally potent stimulation of the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase activity. Stimulation of complex I activity and respiration with NAD-linked substrates were also observed upon short incubation of isolated fibroblast mitoplasts with dibutyryl cAMP and ATP, which also promoted phosphorylation of the 18-kDa subunit.

(1996) GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank Mouse EST Project, accession number AA260316.We show in this study that cAMP induces, in serum-starved 3T3 mouse fibroblast cultures, phosphorylation of the 18-kDa subunit of complex I and promotes the activity of the complex as well as respiration with NAD-linked substrates. These findings document an extension of cAMP-mediated intracellular signal transduction to the regulation of cellular respiration.DISCUSSIONThe results presented show that an elevation of intracellular cAMP induced in serum-starved fibroblasts (G0 phase) by exposure to cholera toxin results in the serine phosphorylation of the nuclear encoded 18-kDa subunit of complex I of mitochondria. The mouse 18-kDa protein of complex I has, like the corresponding bovine, human, andN. crassa proteins, phosphorylation consensus sites both in the mature protein and the leader sequence (Fig. 1) (12.Papa S. Sardanelli A.M. Scacco S. Technikova-Dobrova Z. FEBS Lett. 1999; 444: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar).The cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of the 18-kDa subunit of complex I promoted by exposure of starved fibroblasts to cholera toxin was found to be associated with a 2–3-fold enhancement of the rotenone-sensitive endogenous respiration and of the rotenone-sensitive NADH oxidase of fibroblasts. This stimulation of NAD-linked respiration can be ascribed to promotion by cAMP of the NADH:Q oxidoreductase activity of complex I, which was also stimulated 2–3-fold by exposure of fibroblasts to cholera toxin. Direct treatment of the fibroblast culture with dibutyryl cAMP resulted, in fact, in a potent stimulation of the NADH:Q oxidoreductase activity. This effect of dibutyryl cAMP was characterized by an initial 70% stimulation of the NADH:Q oxidoreductase activity, which was completed in 30 min and was followed, after a lag, by a stimulation of this activity up to 3-fold. Brief incubation of the isolated mitoplasts from the 3T3 fibroblasts with dibutyryl cAMP, which also promoted phosphorylation of the 18-kDa subunit of complex I, resulted in 55 and 80% stimulation of NADH:Q oxidoreductase activity and NAD-linked respiration, respectively. Direct measurements of other mitochondrial activities showed that the stimulation of respiration brought about by cholera toxin treatment of fibroblasts or direct treatment with dibutyryl cAMP of fibroblasts or isolated mitoplasts did take place in the absence of any significant stimulation of respiratory activity with succinate, which utilizes complexes III and IV or ascorbate plus TMPD, which feeds electrons directly to complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase), or of the specific activity of cytochrome c oxidase and citrate synthase.It can concluded that the strong stimulation of respiration and of the activity of complex I associated with the elevation of cellular cAMPin vivo is due to a direct positive regulatory action of the phosphorylation of the 18-kDa subunit of complex I. The time course of the effect of dibutyryl cAMP in the cells and the comparison of its stimulatory effect in the cells in vivo and in the isolated mitoplasts show, however, that the potent enhancement of the activity of complex I effected by cAMP in vivo is only in part due to direct positive regulatory action exerted on the catalytic activity by phosphorylation of the 18-kDa subunit of the complex by the mitochondrial cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Phosphorylation of this subunit by both the cytosolic (34.Rubin C.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1224: 467-479PubMed Google Scholar) and mitochondrial (10.Technikova-Dobrova Z. Sardanelli A.M. Stanca M.R. Papa S. FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 15.Sardanelli A.M. Technikova-Dobrova Z. Speranza F. Mazzocca A. Scacco S. Papa S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 396: 276-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) cAMP-dependent protein kinases, in addition to direct stimulation of the catalytic activity, could also exert a positive effect on the import in mitochondria of the 18-kDa subunit and/or assembly of complex I. Further studies are in progress to clarify this aspect. The effect exerted by cAMP on complex I appears to differ from the induction of cytochrome c gene expression mediated by cAMP-responsive element-binding protein and nuclear respiratory factor 1 activation by phosphorylation (23.Herzig R.P. Scacco S. Scarpulla R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13134-13141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 24.Gopalakrishnan L. Scarpulla R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 105-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this case, the associated stimulation of (ascorbate plus TMPD)-dependent respiration begins after more prolonged serum induction of fibroblasts and most likely represents a long-term adaptation to an increased requirement for respiratory energy.The present results provide evidence for a regulatory role of cAMP in the activity of complex I. This enzyme appears to represent a rate-limiting step for the overall respiratory activity as shown by the observation that cAMP stimulates, both in intact fibroblasts and mitoplasts, oxygen consumption supported by NAD-linked substrates. Thus, activation of mitochondrial respiration and ATP synthesis may be implemented through the cAMP-dependent activation of complex I.Genetic evidence for a critical role of cAMP-dependent protein kinase-mediated phosphorylation of the 18-kDa (AQDQ) subunit of complex I in the regulation of the activity of this complex seems to be provided by the findings in a child affected by a severe deficiency of complex I. This patient had a 5-base pair duplication in the nuclear gene encoding the 18-kDa subunit (21.van den Heuvel L. Ruitenbeek W. Smeets R. Gelman-Kohan Z. Elpeleg O. Loeffen J. Trijbels E.

This mutation, which was transmitted by autosomal recessive inheritance, caused a shift in the translational reading frame, resulting in an elongation of the mature protein by 14 amino acids and destruction of the phosphorylation consensus site.

(1996) GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank Mouse EST Project, accession number AA260316. We show in this study that cAMP induces, in serum-starved 3T3 mouse fibroblast cultures, phosphorylation of the 18-kDa subunit of complex I and promotes the activity of the complex as well as respiration with NAD-linked substrates. These findings document an extension of cAMP-mediated intracellular signal transduction to the regulation of cellular respiration. DISCUSSIONThe results presented show that an elevation of intracellular cAMP induced in serum-starved fibroblasts (G0 phase) by exposure to cholera toxin results in the serine phosphorylation of the nuclear encoded 18-kDa subunit of complex I of mitochondria. The mouse 18-kDa protein of complex I has, like the corresponding bovine, human, andN. crassa proteins, phosphorylation consensus sites both in the mature protein and the leader sequence (Fig. 1) (12.Papa S. Sardanelli A.M. Scacco S. Technikova-Dobrova Z. FEBS Lett. 1999; 444: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar).The cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of the 18-kDa subunit of complex I promoted by exposure of starved fibroblasts to cholera toxin was found to be associated with a 2–3-fold enhancement of the rotenone-sensitive endogenous respiration and of the rotenone-sensitive NADH oxidase of fibroblasts. This stimulation of NAD-linked respiration can be ascribed to promotion by cAMP of the NADH:Q oxidoreductase activity of complex I, which was also stimulated 2–3-fold by exposure of fibroblasts to cholera toxin. Direct treatment of the fibroblast culture with dibutyryl cAMP resulted, in fact, in a potent stimulation of the NADH:Q oxidoreductase activity. This effect of dibutyryl cAMP was characterized by an initial 70% stimulation of the NADH:Q oxidoreductase activity, which was completed in 30 min and was followed, after a lag, by a stimulation of this activity up to 3-fold. Brief incubation of the isolated mitoplasts from the 3T3 fibroblasts with dibutyryl cAMP, which also promoted phosphorylation of the 18-kDa subunit of complex I, resulted in 55 and 80% stimulation of NADH:Q oxidoreductase activity and NAD-linked respiration, respectively. Direct measurements of other mitochondrial activities showed that the stimulation of respiration brought about by cholera toxin treatment of fibroblasts or direct treatment with dibutyryl cAMP of fibroblasts or isolated mitoplasts did take place in the absence of any significant stimulation of respiratory activity with succinate, which utilizes complexes III and IV or ascorbate plus TMPD, which feeds electrons directly to complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase), or of the specific activity of cytochrome c oxidase and citrate synthase.It can concluded that the strong stimulation of respiration and of the activity of complex I associated with the elevation of cellular cAMPin vivo is due to a direct positive regulatory action of the phosphorylation of the 18-kDa subunit of complex I. The time course of the effect of dibutyryl cAMP in the cells and the comparison of its stimulatory effect in the cells in vivo and in the isolated mitoplasts show, however, that the potent enhancement of the activity of complex I effected by cAMP in vivo is only in part due to direct positive regulatory action exerted on the catalytic activity by phosphorylation of the 18-kDa subunit of the complex by the mitochondrial cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Phosphorylation of this subunit by both the cytosolic (34.Rubin C.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1224: 467-479PubMed Google Scholar) and mitochondrial (10.Technikova-Dobrova Z. Sardanelli A.M.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 396: 276-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) cAMP-dependent protein kinases, in addition to direct stimulation of the catalytic activity, could also exert a positive effect on the import in mitochondria of the 18-kDa subunit and/or assembly of complex I. Further studies are in progress to clarify this aspect. The effect exerted by cAMP on complex I appears to differ from the induction of cytochrome c gene expression mediated by cAMP-responsive element-binding protein and nuclear respiratory factor 1 activation by phosphorylation (23.Herzig R.P.

Chem. 1994; 269: 105-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this case, the associated stimulation of (ascorbate plus TMPD)-dependent respiration begins after more prolonged serum induction of fibroblasts and most likely represents a long-term adaptation to an increased requirement for respiratory energy.The present results provide evidence for a regulatory role of cAMP in the activity of complex I. This enzyme appears to represent a rate-limiting step for the overall respiratory activity as shown by the observation that cAMP stimulates, both in intact fibroblasts and mitoplasts, oxygen consumption supported by NAD-linked substrates. Thus, activation of mitochondrial respiration and ATP synthesis may be implemented through the cAMP-dependent activation of complex I.Genetic evidence for a critical role of cAMP-dependent protein kinase-mediated phosphorylation of the 18-kDa (AQDQ) subunit of complex I in the regulation of the activity of this complex seems to be provided by the findings in a child affected by a severe deficiency of complex I. This patient had a 5-base pair duplication in the nuclear gene encoding the 18-kDa subunit (21.van den Heuvel L. Ruitenbeek W. Smeets R. Gelman-Kohan Z. Elpeleg O. Loeffen J. Trijbels E.

This mutation, which was transmitted by autosomal recessive inheritance, caused a shift in the translational reading frame, resulting in an elongation of the mature protein by 14 amino acids and destruction of the phosphorylation consensus site.

Powered by sunlight, this is the key reaction that created and still sustains an oxygenic atmosphere on our planet. As a pigment-protein complex, PS II consists of more than 20 different subunits (1.Hankamer B. Barber J. Boekema E.J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 48: 641-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), most of them being integral membrane proteins. The PS II reaction center (RC) itself is composed of the D1 and D2 proteins, which bind the cofactors for the light-driven electron transfer processes (2.Diner B.A. Babcock G.T. Ort D.R. Yocum C.F. Advances in Photosynthesis: The Light Reactions. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht1996: 213-247Google Scholar). Upon light absorption, an electron is transferred from the primary electron donor P680 to a nearby pheophytin molecule. This charge separation is stabilized by rapid electron transfer to a tightly bound plastoquinone molecule, QA, and finally a mobile plastoquinone, QB, on the stromal/cytoplasmic side of the membrane. After double reduction and protonation, the reduced QB is released from its binding site on the D1 protein and replaced by an oxidized plastoquinone molecule. On the donor side, P680+ is reduced by a tyrosine residue of the D1 protein, tyrZ (3.Barry B.A. Babcock G.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7099-7103Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 4.Debus R.J. Barry B.A. Sithole I. Babcock G.T. McIntosh L.

Diner B.A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6960-6969Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), which in turn is reduced by a cluster of four manganese atoms located on the luminal side of PS II. This manganese cluster is the place where water splitting occurs. In four successive charge separation steps, four positive charge equivalents are accumulated that yield, finally, one molecule of oxygen out of two molecules of water. Accordingly, the manganese cluster can assume five different oxidation states, S0–S4, with S4 being the state in which oxygen is released. Because water is a very stable molecule, its oxidation requires a potential of +1 V. Therefore, PS II is the most oxidizing enzyme in nature. Closely associated with the reaction center is cytochromeb 559 consisting of two subunits, α and β. Each subunit of the cytochrome provides one histidine side chain for heme binding. The function of cytochrome b 559 is still not completely understood (for a recent review see Ref. 6.Steward D.H. Brudvig G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1367: 63-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Two chlorophyll a (Chl a) binding proteins, CP47 and CP43, which form the inner antenna of the photosystem, are located on either side of the D1/D2 RC (7.Hankamer B. Morris E.P. Barber J. Nature Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Both proteins bind about 14–16 Chla molecules (7.Hankamer B. Morris E.P. Barber J. Nature Struct.

Nature. 1998; 396: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) as well as three to five carotenoids. There is also a number of low molecular mass subunits (less than 10 kDa) attached to the PS II core complex, which are predicted to have only one transmembrane helix (9.Hankamer B. Nield J. Zheleva D. Boekema E.J. Janson S. Barber J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 422-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Some of them seem to be dispensable for PS II function and assembly, whereas others are not. However, the exact function of the latter remains to be elucidated. The manganese cluster at the luminal side of PS II is shielded by three extrinsic subunits (see Ref. 10.Seidler A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1277: 35-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar for a recent review). Higher plant PS II contains three subunits of 33, 23, and 16 kDa. Their role is to stabilize and to protect the manganese cluster as well as to increase binding of Ca2+ and Cl−, two other inorganic cofactors of water splitting. In cyanobacteria only the 33-kDa protein exists. The 23- and 16-kDa proteins are replaced by cytochromec 550 and a 12-kDa protein, which seem to also have protective and stabilizing functions for PS II. The relative positioning of the extrinsic subunits in the PS II complex was possible by comparison of the structure of PS II with and without these subunits by single particle analysis. This allowed the assignment of electron densities for the 33-kDa protein (11.Boekema E.J. Hankamer B. Bald D. Kruip J. Nield J. Boonstra A.F. Barber J. Rögner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), the 23- and 16-kDa proteins in higher plant PS II (12.Boekema E.J. Hankamer B. Nield J. Barber J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 252: 268-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), as well as the cytochromec 550 and the 12-Da protein in cyanobacterial PS II (13.Kuhl H. Rögner M. van Breemen J.F.L. Boekema E.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 453-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Despite intense research over the last two decades, the nature and function of the key components of PS II, the primary electron donor P680 which generates the oxidative power to split water and the manganese cluster where water splitting takes place, are still poorly understood. Although there has been considerable progress in the structural analysis of PS II in recent years, knowledge about its high resolution structure is still missing. The first detailed three-dimensional structure of PS II at 8-Å resolution was obtained by cryoelectron microscopy of two-dimensional crystals obtained from a so-called RC·CP47 complex (14.Rhee K.-H. Morris E.-P. Zheleva D. Hankamer B. Kühlbrandt W. Barber J. Nature. 1997; 389: 522-526Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 15.Rhee K.-H. Morris E.-P. Barber J. Kühlbrandt W. Nature. 1998; 396: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). This complex consists of the D1 and D2 reaction center proteins as well as cytochromeb 559, CP47, and probably some of the small hydrophobic subunits. The electron density of 23 transmembrane helices was assigned as well as a number of tetrapyrrole rings of chlorophylls, pheophytins, or heme groups. Comparison with the structure of the bacterial reaction center (16.Deisenhofer J. Epp O. Miki K. Huber R. Michel H. Nature. 1985; 318: 618-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (2553) Google Scholar, 17.Michel H. Deisenhofer J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1-7Crossref Scopus (644) Google Scholar) as well as with PS I (18.Krauss N. Schubert W.-D. Klukas O. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Saenger W. Nature Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 965-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) allowed the assignment of 10 helices to D1/D2 RC and six to CP47. In addition, a projection map of a PS II core complex retaining CP43 and the extrinsic 33-kDa protein was reported, which allowed the positioning of CP43 within PS II (7.Hankamer B. Morris E.P. Barber J. Nature Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). However, the fact that most two- and three-dimensional crystallization attempts of PS II preparations from mesophilic organisms resulted in the loss of the luminal side subunits and/or the water-splitting capacity (see for example Refs. 14.Rhee K.-H. Morris E.-P. Zheleva D. Hankamer B. Kühlbrandt W. Barber J. Nature. 1997; 389: 522-526Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar and 19.Nakazato K. Toyoshima C. Enami I. Inoue Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) points out the importance of using more stable PS II complexes for crystallization, for example those isolated from thermophilic cyanobacteria. In this communication we present a new purification procedure for highly active dimeric PS II complexes with intact electron donor and acceptor sides. Three-dimensional crystals were obtained, which diffract to about 4.3-Å resolution. A first characterization of these crystals together with a detailed biochemical and biophysical analysis shows the extraordinary stability of these PS II complexes, which maintain both their dimeric state and high oxygen-evolving activity even during crystallization. Synechococcus elongatus was grown in a 25-liter foil fermenter (Bioengineering, Switzerland) at 55 °C in special growth medium according to a previous study (20.Castenholz R.W. Bacteriol. Rev. 1969; 33: 476-504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), bubbled with CO2-enriched air (5%) and illuminated with white light of increasing intensity (50–250 μEinstein). Cells were harvested after 3–4 days at an OD730 of 3–4 and concentrated to about 1.5 liters using a hollow fiber system (Amicon DC10 LA). Pelleting by centrifugation (Sorvall GSA rotor, 11,000 rpm, 18 min, 4 °C) yielded about 100 g of cells (wet weight), which were resuspended in about 150 ml of buffer A (20 mm MES, pH 6.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 10 mm CaCl2) and pelleted again. After resuspension in about 200 ml of buffer B (20 mm MES, pH 6.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.5 m mannitol), lysozyme was added to a final concentration of 1 g/liter. Cells were incubated in the dark at 37–40 °C for 90 min on a shaker. Upon adding an aliquot of DNase and RNase, cells were disrupted using a Parr bomb, pelleted (Sorvall GSA rotor, 11,000 rpm, 18 min, 4 °C), and resuspended in 200 ml of buffer A. This washing step was repeated twice. The pellet was resuspended in 200 ml of buffer B, centrifuged again, and resuspended in a small volume of buffer B + 20% glycerol to yield a high Chl concentration. The membranes were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C. Thylakoid membranes were washed with 0.05% β-dodecyl-d-maltoside (β-DM) (Biomol), pelleted, and resuspended in extraction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm CaCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.2 m (NH4)2SO4). Membrane proteins were solubilized at a chlorophyll concentration of 1 mg of Chl/ml with 1.2% β-DM (Biomol) and 0.5% sodium cholate (Sigma) by stirring in the dark at room temperature for 30 min. After centrifugation (Sorvall T647.5 rotor, 40,000 rpm, 1 h, 4 °C) AMS buffer (3 m(NH4)2SO4, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm CaCl2, 10 mmMgCl2) was added to the supernatant to a final (NH4)2SO4 concentration of 1.65m. The extract was loaded onto a hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) column (POROS ET, PE Biosystems) connected to a perfusion chromatography workstation (BioCAD 700E, PE Biosystems). The HIC column was previously equilibrated with 1.65 m(NH4)2SO4, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm CaCl2, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.03% β-DM. PS II was eluted after a short wash step with a gradient of 1.65–0 m(NH4)2SO4 in the same buffer at a flow rate of 10 ml/min. PS II-containing fractions were pooled and concentrated in a concentration device (Amicon Model 8050, equipped with a YM-100 membrane) to 8–10 ml followed by overnight dialysis against 20 mm MES, pH 6.5, 10 mmCaCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5m mannitol, 0.03% β-DM. The sample was loaded onto an anion-exchange column (UNO Q-6, Bio-Rad) pre-equilibrated with the same buffer containing 5 mm MgSO4 and eluted with a linear gradient of 5–200 mm MgSO4 in the same buffer at a flow rate of 4 ml/min. Fractions containing active PS II were pooled and concentrated twice by ultrafiltration (cutoff 100 kDa) to finally 2–10 mg of Chl/ml. The sample was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C. Analytical size-exclusion chromatography was performed on a Waters system consisting of a photodiode array detector 996, pump 515, and an injector (Rheodyne) with a TSKgel 4000 SWXL column (TosoHaas, Stuttgart) using a buffer of 20 mm MES, pH 6.5, 30 mmCaCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5m mannitol, and 0.03% β-dodecyl maltoside at a flow rate of 0.5 ml min−1. Purified PS II complexes were mixed with acetone to yield a final acetone concentration of 87%. After vortexing and centrifugation (Biofuge, 15 min, 13,000 rpm, 4 °C), the pelleted protein was separated from the supernatant containing the extracted pigments. Filtrated supernatant (up to 50 ng of Chl) was applied onto a Reversed phase column (Spherisorb Typ ODS1, particle size 5 μm), which had been pre-equilibrated with buffer A (acetonitrile, methanol, 0.1m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) mixed in a ratio of 72:8:3) at 20 °C. At a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min, a linear gradient up to 100% of buffer B (methanol and hexane at a ratio 7:1) was applied. Quantification of chlorophyll a relative to pheophytin was done according to the elution profile recorded at 663 nm, using the respective peak areas and extinction coefficients of 78.4 mm−1 cm−1 (Chl a) and 49.6 mm−1 cm−1 (Pheo) (according to Ref. 21.Lichtenthaler H.K. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 148: 350-382Crossref Scopus (8704) Google Scholar, modified). All organic solvents used were of HPLC grade (Baker) and have been degassed prior to use. Rates of oxygen evolution were measured at 25 °C unless otherwise indicated in a thermostated Clark-type oxygen electrode (Model RE K1-1 N, Biolytik, Germany) using continuous, saturating light provided by a 250-W cold light source (Halolux). Thylakoid membranes, extract, and PS II core complexes were suspended in 20 mm MES, pH 6.5, 10 mmCaCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5m mannitol, 0.03% β-DM with a concentration of 2–5 μg Chl/ml. As artificial electron acceptors 2,6-dichloro-p-benzoquinone (2,6-DCBQ) or ferricyanide were used, both with a final concentration of 2 mm. The polypeptide composition of the core complexes was analyzed using denaturing SDS-PAGE with a 12–22% linear gradient polyacrylamide gel according to a modified Laemmli system with 0.75 m Tris in the separating gel. Samples were solubilized in sample buffer with 3% SDS and 5% β-mercaptoethanol (5 min at 60 °C and, subsequently, 45 min at room temperature). For heme staining, β-mercaptoethanol was omitted. The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 or tetramethyl benzidine according to a previous study (22.Thomas P.E. Ryan D. Levin W. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 75: 168-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). Absorption spectroscopy was performed on a Beckman DU-7400 spectrophotometer. Chlorophyll concentration was determined after extraction from thylakoid membranes with 100% methanol by its absorbance at 665 and 649 nm according to a previous study (21.Lichtenthaler H.K. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 148: 350-382Crossref Scopus (8704) Google Scholar). For optical difference spectra, the isolated PS II complex (10 μg of Chl/ml) was treated with ferricyanide (final concentration, 2 mm) to oxidize the heme groups, followed by partial reduction by ascorbate (final concentration, 10 mm) and full reduction by the addition of an aliquot of dithionite. At each stage, 10 spectra were recorded and averaged prior to subtraction. Thermoluminescence was recorded in a set-up described previously (23.Demeter S. Vass I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 764: 24-32Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar) using PS II samples at a Chl concentration of 17 μg of Chl/ml. Thermoluminescence was charged at −15 °C or 3 °C, respectively, by applying one or more single turnover flashes onto the samples. Signals were recorded during warming up the sample to 70 °C at a heating rate of 20 °C/min. Prior to thermoluminescence measurements, samples were dark-adapted for 2 min at 20 °C. No cryoprotectants were added for the measurements. Similar thermoluminescence bands were obtained with two different preparations of isolated PS II complexes. Best crystals were obtained with a reservoir consisting of 10% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, 100 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), and 100 mm ammonium sulfate. Different techniques for the crystallization were successfully applied: Vapor diffusion in Linbro cell culture plates using “hanging drop” and “sitting drop” set-ups equilibrating against a 1.0-ml reservoir (24.McPherson A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 189: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), micro batch under oil (25.Chayen N.E. Stewart P.D.S. Blow D.M. J. Crystal Growth. 1992; 122: 176-180Crossref Scopus (192) Google Scholar), micro batch in small 400-μl chambers, and micro batch in crystallization capillaries. In each case, the ratios of protein solution to reservoir solution were between 1:1 and 2:1, respectively. The final drop volume was between 1.0 and 3.0 μl. In all cases the glass surfaces in contact with the protein solution were siliconized with a solution of 0.5% (v/v) dimethyl dichlorosilane in toluene. Important requirements for the successful crystallization of a multisubunit protein complex with many cofactors such as PS II are the stability, homogeneity, intactness, and sufficient quantities of the protein complex. For cyanobacterial PS II, this involves an efficient mass culture (see “Experimental Procedures”), an extraction procedure using mild detergents without loss of activity or partial loss of (extrinsic) subunits, and a fast and efficient purification procedure. Although other details are outlined in the “Experimental Procedures,” the extraction and the chromatographic purification procedures, which are the key steps, should be evaluated separately as follows: (a) Extraction of PS II from the crude thylakoid membranes was optimized using a combination of the detergents β-dodecyl-d-maltoside and sodium cholate. Although the addition of sodium cholate led to a reduced solubilization efficiency compared with solubilization by β-DM alone, monomerization of PS II was avoided, which is an important prerequisite for a homogenous preparation and high oxygen activity yields. (b) The use of perfusion chromatography as the first chromatographic step resulted in a considerable acceleration of the purification procedure: Due to the stability of the matrix material with excellent flow characteristics, the crude extract could be applied directly onto the column without any prepurification step, and the flow rates could be increased up to a factor of 10. Using ethyl surface groups, weak hydrophobic interaction chromatography could separate PS II from the other main protein components of the thylakoid membrane,i.e. PS I (absorption maximum at 680 nm) (Fig.1, left) and phycobiliproteins (absorption maximum at 600–650 nm). In addition, free carotenoids (first peak of the elution diagram) and nucleic acids (peak next to PS II) were separated, as identified by absorption spectroscopy. In a second step, an ion-exchange column with continuous bed matrix material separated PS II dimers with high and low oxygen-evolving activity (Fig.1, right). The reason for the lower activity of one fraction (only 30–50% of the maximum activity) is not yet clear, because SDS-PAGE analysis did not show any significant difference between the two peaks. The dimeric state of both PS II fractions was verified by size exclusion HPLC (see also Fig. 6, left). Routinely, also a small peak of inactive monomers lacking the 33-kDa subunit (verified by size exclusion HPLC and SDS-PAGE analysis, data not shown) was observed. In conclusion, this second step was decisive in achieving both structural and functional homogeneity of the dimeric PS II complex. Also, besides using new column technology, the use of the mild detergent β-DM for all steps, including solubilization of the thylakoid membrane, was a prerequisite to maintaining a very high oxygen evolution activity of the isolated complexes.Figure 6Comparison of size, homogeneity, and subunit composition of the dimeric PS II complex before and after crystallization. 1–2 days after crystallization, crystals were resolubilized in buffer (20 mm MES, pH 6.5, 10 mm CaCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 m mannitol, 0.03% β-DM) and characterized by:Left, size exclusion chromatography, using a TSKgel 4000 SWXL (see “Experimental Procedures”); for comparison, also the elution profile of monomeric PS II is shown. Right, SDS-PAGE: Coomassie stain of dimeric PS II before (a) and after crystallization (b) (for details see “Experimental Procedures”).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The success of this PS II purification procedure was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and absorption spectroscopy (Fig.2). By SDS-PAGE analysis of samples taken at various steps during purification, from thylakoid membranes (Fig. 2,left, lane b) to purified PS II (lane e), the extreme efficiency of the HIC step, and the further removal of numerous contaminating proteins by the ion-exchange chromatography step is obvious. Especially, the loss of phycobilisome subunits (17–20 kDa) by the HIC step is apparent (lane d). Protein subunits of the purified PS II complex (lane e) were assigned according to their apparent molecular masses and/or Western blotting (data not shown). All major PS II subunits are present: The reaction center proteins D1 and D2, the internal antenna proteins CP47 and CP43; the α-subunit of cytochrome b 559(PsbE); and the three lumen-exposed subunits, the 33-kDa protein, cytochrome c 550, and the 12-kDa protein, which are decisive for preserving the water-splitting activity. Additionally, at least three small subunits with molecular masses between 2 and 8 kDa were detected, including most probably the β-subunit of cytochromeb 559. The presence of cytochromec 550 and the 12-kDa protein was previously confirmed by immunoblot analysis and heme staining (13.Kuhl H. Rögner M. van Breemen J.F.L. Boekema E.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 453-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The success of the purification procedure is also obvious when comparing absorption spectra of the crude extract and the isolated PS II complex (Fig. 2, right). In contrast to the extract with prevailing PS I (peaking at 679 nm) and phycobilisomes (600–650 nm), the purified PS II core complex shows the characteristic absorption maximum at about 674 nm and the loss of all contaminating chromophores. This purity as analyzed by UV-visible spectroscopy and gel electrophoresis is in line with a low and reproducible number of chlorophylls per 2 pheophytin molecules as determined by reversed phase chromatography. Several determinations of various preparations yielded (39 ± 1) Chl per reaction center, based on 2 pheophytins per PS II core complex (data not shown). The small deviation from the average value indicates the excellent reproducibility of the preparation procedure. The purified PS II dimers showed a very high oxygen-evolving activity with a typical rate of 5000–6000 μmol of O2 (mg of Chl)−1 h−1 (at 25 °C with 2,6-DCBQ as electron acceptor). To our knowledge, this is the highest rate reported for a PS II preparation. Also, the preparation showed a remarkable stability, retaining about 70–80% of its original activity after 7 days of storage on ice in the dark, which is an excellent basis for subsequent crystallization experiments. In accordance with oxygen evolution measurements on intact cells (26.Yamaoka T. Satoh K. Katoh S. Plant Cell Physiol. 1978; 19: 943-954Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar), activity measurements with ferricyanide as electron acceptor yielded an optimum above 50 °C for isolated complexes, whereas the electron acceptor 2,6-DCBQ decomposes at temperatures higher than 35 °C. The high temperature optimum for the oxygen evolution activity indicates that the thermostability of the water-splitting complex was maintained during the purification procedure and is an inherent property of this protein complex. To study the nature of the cytochromes present in the PS II preparation, redox difference spectra were recorded. The dithionite-reduced minus ascorbate-oxidized difference spectrum showed peaks at 550 and 522 nm (Fig. 3,left). These maxima are characteristic for cytochromec 550 (27.Nishiyama Y. Hayashi H. Watanabe T. Murata N. Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 1313-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 28.Navarro J.A. Hervas M. De la Cerda B. De la Rosa M.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 318: 46-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar); the apparent low redox potential is in agreement with the −250 mV level reported for cytochromec 550 for other cyanobacteria (28.Navarro J.A. Hervas M. De la Cerda B. De la Rosa M.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 318: 46-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 29.Shen J.-R. Ikeuchi M. Inoue Y. FEBS Lett. 1992; 301: 145-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). An ascorbate-reduced minus ferricyanide-oxidized difference spectrum showed merely the characteristic peak of cytochromeb 559 at approximately 559 nm (Fig. 3,left, dotted line (6.Steward D.H. Brudvig G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1367: 63-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar)). Thermoluminescence measurements were performed to probe the functionality of the QB binding site of the isolated PS II complex. After excitation by single turnover flashes given at −15 °C or 3 °C, respectively, a thermoluminescence B-band at approximately 24 °C was observed, which originated from charge recombination of the semiquinone QB− with the S2/S3 state of the manganese cluster (30.Rutherford A.W. Crofts A.R. Inoue Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 682: 97-101Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Fig.3 (right) shows a thermoluminescence signal after excitation with two single turnover flashes. With the intensity of a single turnover flash being too low to yield saturation, two flashes were required to achieve maximal signal size for this preparation. In addition to the B-band, a small Q-band due to charge recombination of QA− with the S2/S3state of the manganese cluster was observed at 4 °C (30.Rutherford A.W. Crofts A.R. Inoue Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 682: 97-101Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This band reflects centers with QB missing or with blocked electron transport from QA to QB. From the ratio of the two bands, a 90–95% occupation of the QB site by plastoquinone was estimated, which is probably an underestimation: on one hand, the intensity of the excitation flash was still not saturating; on the other, part of the centers may have become double reduced after the second flash, being single reduced after the first flash. In summary, the PS II preparation presented here is the first one that yields highly purified PS II complexes with an intact QBsite, occupied by a plastoquinone molecule. This is an important fact in that it starts from a homogenous preparation then yields homogenous crystals for x-ray analysis. Crystals were grown by the hanging drop method using polyethylene glycol 4000 and (NH4)2SO4 as precipitants. Depending on the conditions, crystals of different shape and size grew within 6 h. Fig. 4 shows two different crystallization results obtained by various conditions. If the equilibration of the drop was too fast or the precipitant concentration too high the crystals had the shape of dendrites (Fig.4 A), which did not show any x-ray diffraction. Under optimal conditions PS II crystallized in well shaped individual crystals reaching maximum dimensions of around 1.0 x 0.5 x 0.2 mm (Fig. 4,B and C). For the optimization of the crystallization conditions, different temperatures were tested (4, 15, 18, and 22 °C) yielding a"

Beside its role in photosynthetic electron transport, the cytb 6 f 1complex is also recruited for redox sensing and signal transduction in chloroplasts (2.Wollman F.-A. Rochaix J.-D.

The cytb 6 fcomplex plays a key role in the supramolecular reorganization of the photosynthetic apparatus upon state transitions: changes in the redox state of plastoquinones (PQs) that bind to cytb 6 f complexes allow a photosynthetic cell to adapt to changes in light quality as well as to changes in intracellular ATP levels (4.Bulte L. Gans P. Rebéillé F. Wollman F.-A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1020: 72-80Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar). At the molecular level, plastoquinol binding at the Qo site of cytb 6 f complexes on the lumen side of the thylakoid membranes activates a kinase that phosphorylates the light-harvesting antenna on the stromal side of the membranes (5.Wollman F.-A.

How the plastoquinol binding signal is transduced across the membrane for kinase activation remains unknown. This reversible protein phosphorylation process controls the migration of the antenna and the cytb 6 f complex between the stacked membrane regions containing photosystem II (PSII) and the unstacked membrane regions containing PSI (10.Vallon O.

Studies with Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in vivo have shown that state I corresponds to a low phosphorylation of the peripheral antenna proteins that are mainly associated with PSII, with the photosynthetic apparatus being set for a linear electron flow from PSII to PSI aimed at carbon fixation; in state II, the peripheral antenna proteins become heavily phosphorylated, are mainly associated with PSI and the photosynthetic apparatus is set for cyclic electron flow and supplies high ATP levels (4.Bulte L.

Last, a nucleus-encoded 19-kDa polypeptide, termed suV, had been proposed to associate with the rest of the cytb 6 f subunits in C. reinhardtii, based on its presence in cytb 6 f-enriched fractions and its absence or low representation in cytb 6 f-deficient mutants (21.Lemaire C.

Thylakoid membranes (1.5 mg of chlorophyll/ml) from the F54 mutant, deficient in ATP synthase, were solubilized 15 min at 4 °C in the presence of 2.2% Mega-8 (w/v), 20 mm Tricine, pH 8.0, 3 mm KCl, and 3 mm MgCl2. The solubilized supernatant, which is enriched in cytb 6 f complex was separated on 12–18% SDS-polyacrylamide gels in the presence of 8m urea, and electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes in a semidry system as described previously (24.Atteia A. de Vitry C.

Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 2031-2044Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, and the annealing temperature was 55 °C. Two phage-specific primers (5′-TGAGCAAGTTCAGCCTGGTTAAGTC-3′; 5′-GCTTATGAGTATTTCTTCCAGGGTA-3′) and a degenerate sense primer deduced from the N-terminal sequence of suV 5′-CTGCAGCAGCC(G/T/C)GT(A/G/T/C)CTGAAGAAGGC(G/T/C)TTCCAGGA-3′ were designed to amplify the 3′ part of the PETO cDNA. Either of the two phage primers in combination with the sense degenerate primer led to a 1.1-kilobase (kb) PCR amplification product when 0.5–1 μg of library DNA was used as a template. An antisense primer, 5′-CCCATCACGCCCCAGCTCCC-3′, chosen from the sequence of the 1.1-kb PCR product was used to amplify, with either phage-specific primer, a 0.7-kb PCR product corresponding to the 5′ part of the PETOcDNA. 1.3-kb full length cDNA was reconstituted using megaprime PCR by mixing the 1.1- and 0.7-kb products (obtained with different phage primers) and both phage primers. Sequencing was performed on both strands by Genome Express (Paris, France). Total RNA analysis was performed according to a previous study (27.Drapier D. Girard-Bascou J. Wollman F.-A. Plant Cell. 1992; 4: 283-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Biochemical analyses were carried out on cells grown to a density of about 2 × 106 cells per milliliter. For polypeptide analysis, samples were resuspended in 100 mm 1,4-dithiothreitol and 100 mm Na2CO3 and solubilized in the presence of 2% SDS at 100 °C for 50 s. Polypeptides were then separated on 12–18% SDS-polyacrylamide gels in the presence of 8m urea, cells, and thylakoid membranes were loaded at chlorophyll constant. Heme staining was detected by peroxidase activity of heme-binding subunits using 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine as described previously (21.Lemaire C. Girard-Bascou J. Wollman F.-A. Bennoun P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 851: 229-238Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Immunodetection using antisera raised against cytf, suIV, Rieske protein in combination with125I-labeled protein A, or an enhanced chemiluminescence method was carried out as in Ref. 6.de Vitry C. Finazzi G. Baymann F. Kallas T. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 2031-2044Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar. Thylakoid membrane proteins were purified as done previously (24.Atteia A. de Vitry C. Pierre Y. Popot J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 267: 226-234Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Cytb 6 f complexes were purified by 6-O-(N-heptylcarbamoyl)-methyl-α-d-glucopyranoside (Hecameg; Vegatec, Villejuif, France) solubilization of thylakoid membranes (12.Pierre Y. Breyton C. Kramer D. Popot J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29342-29349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Polypeptide extraction from thylakoids were performed by two cycles of 10-min incubation with various dissociating agents at room temperature followed by freeze/thaw as described previously (28.Breyton C. de Vitry C. Popot J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7597-7602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After Hecameg solubilization, the supernatant was subjected to sucrose gradient centrifugation and gradient fractions were then assayed for kinase activity using [γ-32P]ATP and casein as substrate according to a previous study (5.Wollman F.-A. Lemaire C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 933: 85-94Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Anti-PSII PsbB, anti-Rieske, and anti-cytf antibodies were raised against the entire polypeptides. Anti-suV was raised against a synthetic peptide containing the sequence of the N terminus of mature suV (LQQPVLKKAFQDDTP) coupled to ovalbumin through an extra COOH-tyrosine and prepared by Neosystem (Strasbourg, France). Anti-cytf monoclonal antibody was kindly provided by O. Vallon (Institut de Biologie Physico-Chimique, Paris). Anti-PSII OEE2 preparation was described previously (29.de Vitry C. Olive J. Drapier D. Recouvreur M. Wollman F.-A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 991-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Thylakoid membranes were washed twice with 20 mm ammonium phosphate, pH 7.4, without protease inhibitors. Various concentrations of protease V8 or of trypsin were added to thylakoid membranes at a final chlorophyll concentration of 1 mg/ml. Half of each sample was sonicated for 10 s on ice. Trypsin and V8 treatments were performed at room temperature for 20 min, and the reaction was arrested by adding 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride as a protease inhibitor. The samples were analyzed by urea/SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and immunoblotting. Immunocytochemistry on thin sections was performed according to a previous study (29.de Vitry C. Olive J. Drapier D. Recouvreur M. Wollman F.-A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 991-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Immunogold labeling of thylakoid membrane vesicles was performed according to earlier work (30.Vallon O. Tae G.S. Cramer W.A. Simpson D. Hoyer-Hansen G. Bogorad L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 975: 132-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Anti-suV antibody raised against a synthetic peptide designed from the sequence of the N terminus of mature suV and anti-cytf monoclonal antibody recognizing the lumenal domain cytf were used at dilutions of 200 and 10, respectively, for single or double immunogold labeling of the vesicles. Cells grown at 3 × 106 cells/ml were incubated for 120 min, under dim light (5 μmol of photons m−2 s−1), in a phosphate-depleted medium containing 1 μCi/ml of [32P]orthophosphate or 2 μCi/ml of [33P]orthophosphate. After resuspension in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaCl, the prelabeled cells were placed for 30 min in either state I or state II conditions. For state I, cells were illuminated at 50 μmol of photons m−2 s−1in the presence of 10−5m3,4-dichlorophenyl-1,1-dimethylurea to get oxidation of the PQ pool. For state II, the PQ pool was reduced by placing dark-adapted cells in anaerobic conditions using 20 mm glucose and 2 mg/ml glucose-oxidase as described previously (31.Wollman F.-A. Delepelaire P. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). State I and II cells were rapidly broken at 4 °C in a French pressure cell at 4000 psi after adding 10 mm NaF, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1 msucrose, and protease inhibitors to the suspension medium. Thylakoid membrane proteins were prepared as in Ref. 25.Atteia A. Franzén L.-G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 792-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar with 10 mmNaF and 10 mm EDTA added in all buffers. In vivo 33P-labeled thylakoid membrane proteins were solubilized in the presence of 2% SDS at 100 °C for 50 s and diluted 10-fold in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2% Triton X-100, 10 mm NaF, 200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (buffer A). Protein A-Sepharose CL4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was incubated 30 min in 1 ml of distilled water, and washed three times in 1 ml of buffer A. To 1 ml of protein A-Sepharose CL4B in buffer A 30 μl of suV antiserum was added or none as a control and samples were incubated 1 h at 4 °C and washed once in 1 ml of buffer A. The diluted solubilized thylakoid membrane proteins were mixed with the pellets of protein A-Sepharose, which had or not been in presence of suV antibodies; samples were incubated 1 h at 4 °C, and washed three times in 1 ml of buffer A. Samples were resuspended in 100 mm1,4-dithiothreitol and 100 mmNa2CO3 and solubilized in the presence of 2% SDS at 100 °C for 50 s for polypeptide analysis. We have previously identified a nucleus-encoded polypeptide of 19-kDa apparent molecular mass that was absent from the thylakoid membranes of cytb 6 f mutants (21.Lemaire C. Girard-Bascou J. Wollman F.-A. Bennoun P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 851: 229-238Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To avoid its copurification with some ATP synthase subunits that display a similar apparent molecular mass, we recovered suV (PetO) from the ATP synthase-deficient mutant F54, using a thylakoid membrane solubilization with Mega-8, which selectively extracts cytb 6 f complex. After gel electrophoresis and transfer onto nitrocellulose membranes, we were able to microsequence 31 residues of the N terminus and one internal tryptic fragment of purified suV (Fig.1). The cDNA for suV was cloned by PCR amplification of a C. reinhardtii cDNA library with a degenerate primer derived from the N-terminal microsequence and phage-specific primers. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences (GenBank™ accession number AF222893) are shown in Fig. 1 and are aligned with the sequence obtained from N terminus sequencing. These sequences are homologous to ones found within a library of recently released expressed sequence tags (cDNA sequences) of C. reinhardtii (20.Asamizu E. Nakamura Y. Sato S. Fukuzawa H. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1999; 6: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The methionine codon, CACCAUGGCC, has features of an initiation codon with a consensus sequence similar to that of higher plants, i.e. AACAAUGGCC (14.de Vitry C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7603-7609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The bipartite transit peptide is 51 residues long and shows features typical of a lumenal-targeting sequence. The first domain is analogous to stroma-targeting peptides: it comprises an alanine in the second position, a short uncharged N-terminal region, a central region rich in residues with basic (R, K) or small (A, S) side chains, a consensus sequence VXA just before the putative intermediate processing site. This latter feature is observed in many transit peptides for nuclear-encoded chloroplast proteins of C. reinhardtii such as the Rieske protein, PSI subunits (P28, P30, and P37), ATPase subunit γ, heat shock protein HSP70B, phosphoribulokinase and ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase large subunit. The second domain is homologous to a thylakoid transfer domain, with a central hydrophobic region, and a consensus cleavage site AXA for the lumenal-processing peptidase. C. reinhardtii suV transit peptide was not recognized as a chloroplast transit peptide by most prediction programs, becauseC. reinhardtii chloroplast peptides share more features with mitochondrial than do higher plant chloroplast presequences (32.Franzén L.-G. Rochaix J.-D. von Heijne G. FEBS Lett. 1990; 260: 165-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The mature protein is 147 residues long and has a calculated molecular mass of 15.2 kDa. A central hydrophobic region is long enough to span the membrane once in an α-helical conformation (Fig.2). The lateral amphipathy of this putative α-helix is low. Northern blots probed with the entire open reading frame of suV revealed a 1.3-kb transcript that corresponds to the size of the insert amplified from the cDNA library (data not shown). We also detected a few longer transcripts in low amounts, which might correspond to splicing intermediates of the primary PETO transcript. The antiserum raised against the N terminus of suV recognized only suV in the thylakoid membrane of C. reinhardtii (Fig.3 A). The steady-state level of suV was greatly diminished in whole cell protein extracts and in purified thylakoid membrane proteins from cytb 6 f-deficient mutants that do not accumulate significant levels of any of the cytb 6 f complex subunits (see ΔpetB or ΔpetD mutants, Fig. 3, Aand B, which lack, respectively, cytb 6 and suIV). In contrast, suV still accumulated together with the other transmembrane subunits of cytb 6 f in mutants lacking specifically the Rieske protein, such as thepetC-Δ1 mutant (Fig. 3 C). suV was recovered together with the other subunits of the cytb 6 f complex in the supernatant after solubilization with Hecameg of the thylakoid membranes (Fig.4). Upon centrifugation of the supernatant on a sucrose gradient, part of suV remained associated with the cytb 6 f complex. However, some suV spread over fractions of higher density, most likely due to aggregated forms of the isolated subunit. suV fully dissociated from the other cytb 6 f subunits during the next purification steps that consisted of a chromatography on a hydroxyapatite column followed by a desorption step in the presence of high concentrations of ammonium phosphate. We investigated the binding of suV to the thylakoid membranes using various dissociating treatments (Table I). Membranes were treated with chaotropic agents or incubated at high ionic strength or alkaline pH. Neither cytf, cytb6, suIV, nor PetG were extracted by these treatments, as expected from their transmembrane anchoring. In contrast, typical peripheral membrane polypeptides (OEE1) were released in the supernatant. As reported earlier, the Rieske protein showed an intermediate susceptibility to dissociating conditions (28.Breyton C. de Vitry C. Popot J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7597-7602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although it has been clearly identified as a transmembrane protein in the three-dimensional structure of bc 1 complexes (33.Zhang Z. Huang L. Shulmeister V.M. Chi Y.I. Kim K.K. Hung L.W. Crofts A.R. Berry E.A. Kim S.H. Nature. 1998; 392: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar, 34.Kim H. Xia D., Yu, C.A. Xia J.Z.

A. 1998; 95: 8026-8033Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). suV behaved similarly to the Rieske protein: Although it was not released from the membranes at high ionic strength, it readily dissociated with chaotropic agents such as KSCN (see also Fig. 8) or at alkaline pH.Table IExtraction of thylakoid proteins by various dissociating treatmentsTricine 20 mMNaCl 2MNal 1.5 MKSCN 2MDTT-Na2C03 85 mMcytf−−−−−cytb 6−−−−−suIV−−−−−PetG−−−−−Rieske−−+/+++++/++suV−−++++/++OEE1++++++++++(−) less than 15% extraction, (+) 15–70% extraction, (++) more than 70%. cytf, cytb 6, suIV and PetG are four intrinsic subunits of cytb0f complex.

OEE1 is PSII extrinsic subunit. Biochemical evidence for a transmembrane orientation of suV, with the N terminus facing the lumen, was provided by analysis of proteolysis experiments. Thylakoid membrane vesicles were incubated in the presence of protease V8 (endoproteinase Glu-C) and then subjected or not to sonication. Before sonication, most of the thylakoid vesicles are in a right-side-out position and exogenous proteases have no access to the lumen side of the membranes. In contrast, upon sonication, the vesicles burst and exogenous proteases have access to both sides of the membranes. suV was degraded by proteases in the absence of sonication, in contrast to the OEE2 protein used here as a control for a lumen resident protein (Fig. 5). Thus, suV exposes some protein motifs to the stromal side of the thylakoid membranes. However, the N-terminal-directed antibody detected a partly protease-protected suV fragment in unsonicated vesicles. This fragment was no longer detected after sonication. Similar observations were made using trypsin as an exogenous protease (experiments not shown). The selective detection of this fragment in unsonicated thylakoid vesicles shows that the N-terminal domain of suV extends in the lumen. The V8-produced fragment of 11-kDa apparent molecular mass should correspond to a truncated product of suV at its stromal C terminus, at E96, E109, or E115, leaving together the transmembrane and N terminus domains that have a predicted size of 10–12 kDa. However, its limited accumulation argues for the high susceptibility of the truncated product to endogenous proteases, whether they are membrane-associated or lumen-located. This high protease susceptibility of suV is also substantiated by in vivo experiments, which show a drastic decrease in suV content in strains that do not accumulate cytb 6 f complexes (Fig. 3). This behavior is in marked contrast with that of OEE2, which is stable in the thylakoid lumen in the absence of PSII assembly (28.Breyton C. de Vitry C. Popot J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7597-7602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we conclude from these assays with exogenous proteases that, in agreement with the sequence data, suV behaves as a transmembrane protein with the N terminus facing the thylakoid lumen and the C terminus extending into the stroma. We then compared the immunogold labeling of thylakoid membrane vesicles that were exposed either to the anti-suV antibody, which recognizes the N-terminal sequence of the mature protein, or to a monoclonal antibody that recognizes a lumen-located motif of cytf. Evidence for the lumen location of this cytf epitope came from its immunodetection in mutant cells expressing only a soluble form of cytf that lacks both the C-terminal transmembrane α-helix and the stromal stretch of the polypeptide chain (data not shown). Immunogold labeling showed an unambiguous colocalization of these two antibodies on the same inside-out vesicle (Fig.6), giving further support to the localization of the N terminus of suV on the membrane lumenal side. When the intersystem electron carriers of the photosynthetic electron transport chain switch from an oxidized (state I) to a reduced (state II) steady state, the photosynthetic apparatus undergoes a change in its supramolecular organization such that most of light-harvesting complex II (LHCII) and some cytb 6 f complex gather next to PSI in the stromal lamellae membrane regions (10.Vallon O. Bulte L. Dainese P. Olive J. Bassi R. Wollman F.-A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8262-8266Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The supramolecular reorganization of the thylakoid membranes can be detected by immunocytochemistry (Table II). In this experiment, thin sections of broken cells of C. reinhardtii, pretreated in either of the two states, were incubated with colloidal gold-coupled antibodies specific for PSII, LHCII, or cytb 6 f antigens. The movement of LHCII or cytb 6 f complexes toward PSI-enriched unstacked membrane domains in state II is demonstrated in Table II by the increase in the ratio of immunogold labeling of unstacked versus stacked membrane region in state II as compared with state I. In contrast PSII remained in the stacked membrane regions in the two states. suV displayed the same behavior as cytf, being enriched in the unstacked regions in state II as compared with state I. This change in lateral distribution between the two states further supports the association of suV with the rest of the cytb 6 f complex, which shows lateral displacement upon state transitions.Table IILabeling relative densities in unstacked relative to stacked membrane regions in immunocytomicroscopyAntigenState IStat"
https://openalex.org/W1990199254,"Peroxisomal ascorbate peroxidase (APX) is a carboxyl tail-anchored, type II (Ncytosol-Cmatrix) integral membrane protein that functions in the regeneration of NAD+ in glyoxysomes of germinated oilseeds and protection of peroxisomes in other organisms from toxic H2O2. Recently we showed that cottonseed peroxisomal APX was sorted post-translationally from the cytosol to peroxisomes via a novel reticular/circular membranous network that was interpreted to be a subdomain of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), named peroxisomal ER (pER). Here we report on the molecular signals responsible for sorting peroxisomal APX. Deletions or site-specific substitutions of certain amino acid residues within the hydrophilic C-terminal-most eight-amino acid residues (includes a positively charged domain found in most peroxisomal integral membrane-destined proteins) abolished sorting of peroxisomal APX to peroxisomes via pER. However, the C-terminal tail was not sufficient for sorting chloramphenicol acetyltransferase to peroxisomes via pER, whereas the peptide plus most of the immediately adjacent 21-amino acid transmembrane domain (TMD) of peroxisomal APX was sufficient for sorting. Replacement of the peroxisomal APX TMD with an artificial TMD (devoid of putative sorting sequences) plus the peroxisomal APX C-terminal tail also sorted chloramphenicol acetyltransferase to peroxisomes via pER, indicating that the peroxisomal APX TMD does not possess essential sorting information. Instead, the TMD appears to confer the proper context required for the conserved positively charged domain to function within peroxisomal APX as an overlapping pER sorting signal and a membrane peroxisome targeting signal type 2.

Data published thus far indicate that they acquire their nuclear-encoded matrix and boundary membrane protein constituents from the cytosol in a regulated, post-translational manner. For instance, proteins destined for the peroxisomal matrix are sorted by at least two evolutionarily conserved targeting signals, the type 1 and type 2 peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS).1 Most of our understanding of the molecular mechanisms responsible for sorting and import of PTS1- and PTS2-bearing proteins has come from studies of yeast and cultured mammalian cells with defects in peroxisomal biogenesis (pex mutants) (1.Distel B. Erdmann R. Gould S.J. Blobel G. Crane D.I. Cregg J.M. Dodt G. Fujiki Y. Goodman J.M. Just W.W. Kiel J.A.K.W. Kunau W.H. Lazarow P.B. Mannaerts G.P. Moser H.W. Osumi T. Rachubinski R.A. Roscher A.

Characterization of these mutants has led to the isolation of a number of genes (PEX) and gene products (peroxins) (2.Subramani S. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 171-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 3.Olsen L.J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 38: 163-189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Tabak H.F. Braakman I. Distel B. Trends. Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 447-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). More recently, information related to the targeting signals and sorting/insertion/assembly of peroxisomal membrane proteins (PMPs) has become available. PMPs also seem to be synthesized in the cytosol and sorted post-translationally to the organelle. However, with one exception (5.Yamashita H. Avraham S. Jiang S. London R. Van Veldhoven P.P. Subramani S. Rogers R.A. Avraham H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29897-29904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), PMPs do not possess a PTS1 or PTS2, and insertion/assembly of PMPs requires several protein components (peroxins) distinct from those required for the import of matrix proteins (2.Subramani S. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 171-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 6.Hettema E.H. Distel B. Tabak H.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1451: 17-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Newly synthesized PMPs seem to be sorted either directly to peroxisomes from the cytosol or indirectly to peroxisomes via the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Data on the routing of PMPs directly to the peroxisomal boundary membrane has been derived mostly from in vitrostudies (7.Imanaka T. Shiina Y. Takano T. Hashimoto T. Osumi T. J. Biol.

Direct sorting of PMPs appears to be mediated by molecular chaperones and a two-step binding and insertion process that is temperature-dependent but does not require ATP hydrolysis. Targeting information also has been obtained for directin vivo sorting of PMPs to peroxisomes (11.Dyer J.M. McNew J.A. Goodman J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 269-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 12.Wiemer E.A.C. Luers G.H. Faber K.N. Wenzel T. Veenhuis M. Subramani S. J. Biol.

For example, the Candida boidinii PMP47 sorting signal, referred to as a membrane PTS (mPTS), was shown to be a cluster of basic residues within a 20-amino acid hydrophilic loop between transmembrane domains (TMDs) four and five of the protein (11.Dyer J.M. McNew J.A. Goodman J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 269-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Another subset of PMPs seems to be sorted initially from the cytosol to the ER, then to peroxisomes. For example, Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pex15p, a tail-anchored type II (Ncytosol-Cmatrix) PMP, and Yarrowia lipolytica Pex2p and Pex16p are glycosylated within the ER lumen while en route to peroxisomes (15.Elgersma Y.

Overexpression of human Pex3p or a portion of the Hansenula polymorpha counterpart fused to a reporter protein resulted in a profound proliferation of ER membranes, consistent with the premise that these proteins are sorted initially to the ER and then to peroxisomes (17.Baerends R.J.S.

Targeting information, albeit somewhat limited when compared with that forC. boidinii PMP47, also has been reported for certain PMPs (H. polymorpha Pex3p and S. cerevisiae Pex15p) that are sorted indirectly to peroxisomes via the ER (15.Elgersma Y.

Herein, a cluster of basic residues similar to sequences identified in theC. boidinii PMP47 targeting signal were postulated to be part of the sorting signal. To date, only one plant PMP has been reported to be sorted to peroxisomes via the ER. Cottonseed peroxisomal ascorbate peroxidase (APX), a tail-anchored type II (Ncytosol-Cmatrix) PMP, was shown in vitro to insert specifically into ER membranes and not into peroxisome membranes (19.Mullen R.T. Lisenbee C.S. Miernyk J.A. Trelease R. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 2167-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). This insertion occurred in a post-translational (signal recognition particle-independent) manner, was dependent upon the presence of ATP and the Hsp70 chaperone machine, and seemed to involve a membrane-bound receptor. In the same study, transiently expressed peroxisomal APX was found to sort in vivo to a distinct subdomain of the ER, which was designated as peroxisomal ER (pER). Suggestive evidence that the peroxisomal APX was transported by vesicles from pER to peroxisomes was obtained from results with brefeldin A, a fungal toxin that disrupts protein export from the ER (19.Mullen R.T. Lisenbee C.S. Miernyk J.A. Trelease R. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 2167-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Vesicular transport of PMPs from the ER to peroxisomes has been proposed for sorting of other PMPs in yeast (15.Elgersma Y. Kwast L. van de Berg M. Snyder W.B. Distel B. Subramani S. Tabak H.F.

Rachubinski R.A. Trends Biol. Sci. 1998; 23: 231-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, important implications of this indirect PMP sorting pathway are that the ER serves as the initial targeting site of the nascent PMP and as the source of new or differentiating peroxisomes (2.Subramani S.

Here, we describe results of in vivo immunofluorescence experiments designed to delineate the molecular signal(s) responsible for sorting peroxisomal APX in plant cells. We demonstrate that a conserved positively charged domain at the C terminus of peroxisomal APX (RKRMK) is required for sorting this protein to peroxisomes via pER. Furthermore, we show also that an adjacent TMD is critical for sorting peroxisomal APX; the TMD apparently confers the proper context necessary for the C-terminal sorting signals to function. Restriction enzymes and other DNA-modifying enzymes were purchased from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI) or New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA). The TA cloning vector, pCR2.1, was obtained from Invitrogen Corp. (San Diego, CA). Purification of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products, DNA fragment isolation, and plasmid DNA isolations were carried out using commercially available kits (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). Triton X-100 was obtained from Sigma, pectolyase Y-23 was purchased from Seishin Pharmaceutical Co. (Tokyo, Japan), and paraformaldehyde was from Ted Pella Inc. (Redding, CA). IgGs in rabbit sera raised to purified cottonseed catalase (26.Kunce C.M. Trelease R.N. Turley R.B. Biochem. J. 1988; 251: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) were affinity-purified with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Monoclonal antibodies to chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) in mouse hybridoma medium were a gift from S. Subramani (University of California, San Diego, CA). Mouse anti-hemagglutinin (HA) epitope monoclonal antibodies (12CA5) were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and fluorescent dye-conjugated secondary antibodies (goat anti-rabbit rhodamine and goat anti-mouse cyanine 2 (Cy2)) were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs (West Grove, PA). Standard recombinant DNA procedures were carried out as described (27.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and DNA mutagenesis reactions were performed using PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis (28.Trelease R.N. Xie W. Lee M.S.

Oligonucleotide primer synthesis and dye terminator cycle sequencing (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) were performed at the Arizona State University Bioresources Facility (Tempe, AZ). All HA-pAPX derivatives and CAT-pAPX fusion constructs examined in this study (see Table I) were inserted into pRTL2ΔN/S (29.Lee M.S. Mullen R.T. Trelease R.N.

Construction of HA-pAPX mutants with deletions or site-specific alterations of amino acid residues in the C terminus of HA-pAPX open reading frame (see Table I) were carried out using PCR mutagenesis (28.Trelease R.N. Xie W. Lee M.S. Mullen R.T. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 71: 248-258PubMed Google Scholar). PCRs were performed using pRTL2/HA-pAPX (encoding cottonseed peroxisomal APX with a single, N-terminal HA epitope tag) (19.Mullen R.T. Lisenbee C.S. Miernyk J.A. Trelease R. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 2167-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) as template DNA. The forward primer (5′-GGA AGT GAA GGC TAA ACA TCC-3′) for all PCRs corresponded to base pairs 432–452, which were 21 base pairs upstream of the unique SnaBI site in HA-pAPX. All appropriate reverse primers introduced site-specific mutations (a premature stop codon or glycine substitution) and a 3′ XbaI restriction site in the cDNA coding for HA-pAPX. The resulting PCR DNA products were TA-cloned into pCR2.1, digested withSnaBI-XbaI, then ligated intoSnaBI-XbaI-digested pRTL2/HA-pAPX. With the exceptions of pRTL2/CAT-pAPX+29, pRTL2/CAT-pAPX+36-TMDΔTMDrev, and pRTL2/CAT-pAPX+36-TMDΔPMP47TMD4, all CAT-pAPX constructs were generated by annealing either one or two sets of appropriate complementary synthetic oligonucleotides coding for a serine-serine/arginine linker (a single serine linker only for CAT-pAPX+RKRMK and CAT-pAPX+11) and selected amino acid residues within the C terminus of cottonseed peroxisomal APX (see Table I). Double-stranded oligonucleotides were ligated via XbaI complementary ends into XbaI-digested pRTL2/CAT-XbaI. pRTL2/CAT-XbaI is a general purpose CAT fusion cassette vector whereby an in-frame XbaI site was substituted for sequences encoding the CAT stop codon (30.Mullen R.T. Lee M.S. Trelease R.N. Plant J. 1997; 12: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Construction of pRLT2/CAT-pAPX+29, coding for the 29 C-terminal amino acid residues of peroxisomal APX appended to the C terminus of the CAT open reading frame, was constructed in the following manner. A PCR mixture included pGEM/pAPX (31.Bunkelmann J. Trelease R.N. Plant Physiol. 1996; 110: 589-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) as template DNA, a forward primer (5′-ATG GTG AAG GAC TCT AGA GTA TTG GCA CAG GGT GC-3′) that modified the DNA sequences encoding threonine 259 of pAPX to an arginine codon and introduced an XbaI site, and a reverse primer (5′-CGC ATC TAG ACG TTT CAC TTC ATT CTT TTG CGG ACC-3′) that introduced anXbaI site in the 3′-untranslated region of peroxisomal APX. The resulting PCR DNA products were TA-cloned into pCR2.1 (generating pCR2.1/pAPX+29), digested with XbaI, then ligated intoXbaI-digested pRTL2/CAT-XbaI to yield pRTL2/CAT-pAPX+29. For the construction of pRTL2/CAT-pAPX+36-TMDΔTMDrev, sequences adjacent to sequences coding for the peroxisomal APX TMD and sequences in the 3′-untranslated region of peroxisomal APX were modified via PCR mutagenesis, with pGEM/pAPX as the template DNA. The forward primer (5′-CCC ACT TCA GCT CGC TCT AGA GTA ATG GTT AAC GAC AGC ACT GTA TTG GCA C-3′) introduced in-frame XbaI and HpaI restriction sites upstream of the peroxisomal APX TMD at nucleotide positions 943–948 and 954–960, respectively, and the reverse primer (5′-CGC ATC TAG AGC TTT CAC TTC ATT CTT TTC CGG ACC TCG TAA AAG TAG CTT AGG-3′) introduced an in-frame BspEI restriction site downstream of the peroxisomal APX TMD at positions 1040–1045 and anXbaI site in the 3′-untranslated region of peroxisomal APX. The resulting PCR DNA products were TA-cloned into pCR2.1, generating pCR2.1/pAPX+36-HpaI-BspEI. Next, two sets of appropriate synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotides possessingHpaI and BspEI complementary ends coding for amino acid residues in an order reverse to those in the TMD of wild-type peroxisomal APX were ligated intoHpaI-BspEI-digested pCR2.1/pAPX+36-HpaI-BspEI, digested withXbaI, and then ligated into XbaI-digested pRTL2/CAT-XbaI to yield pRTL2/CAT-pAPX+36-TMDΔTMDrev. To construct pRTL2/CAT-pAPX+36-TMDΔPMP47TMD4, two sets of appropriate synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotides possessingHpaI and BspEI complementary ends were ligated into HpaI-BspEI-digested pCR2.1/pAPX+36-HpaI-BspEI. pCR2.1/pAPX+36-TMDΔPMP47TMD4-HpaI-BspEI was then digested with XbaI and ligated intoXbaI-digested pRTL2/CAT-XbaI to yield pRTL2/CAT-pAPX+36-TMDΔPMP47TMD4. Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L. cv. Bright Yellow 2) (BY-2) suspension cells were maintained in cultures as described previously (32.Banjoko A. Trelease R.N. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 1201-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Cells were transformed transiently with 10 μg of plasmid DNA by means of a microprojectile particle delivery system (Bio-Rad) (32.Banjoko A. Trelease R.N. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 1201-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 33.Flynn C.R. Mullen R.T. Trelease R.N. Plant J. 1998; 16: 709-720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 20 to 24 h after bombardment (to allow transient gene expression and protein sorting) cells were processed for immunofluorescence microscopy (29.Lee M.S. Mullen R.T. Trelease R.N. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 185-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 33.Flynn C.R. Mullen R.T. Trelease R.N. Plant J. 1998; 16: 709-720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were fixed for 1 h in formaldehyde (4% w/v), washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), then incubated in pectolyase Y-23 (0.1% w/v) in PBS for 2 h at 30 °C. After several washes in PBS, plasma and organellar membranes were permeabilized by incubating cells in Triton X-100 (0.3% v/v) in PBS for 15 min at room temperature (29.Lee M.S. Mullen R.T. Trelease R.N. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 185-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Fixed, pectolyase-treated, and detergent-permeabilized cells were incubated with primary antibodies and then fluorescent dye-conjugated secondary antibodies. Application of antibodies at varied concentrations and staining of ER (pER) with 3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR) were done as described previously (19.Mullen R.T. Lisenbee C.S. Miernyk J.A. Trelease R. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 2167-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). A portion of immunostained cells were mounted on glass slides and viewed with a Zeiss Axiovert 100 epifluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss Inc., Thornwood, NY). Photographs were taken using Kodak TMAX400 ASA black and white print film (Eastman Kodak Co.), and printed images or photographic negatives were computer-scanned and subsequently composed into figures using Adobe Photoshop 5.0.2 (Adobe Systems, Mountain View, CA). We speculated earlier (34.Mullen R.T. Trelease R.N. Trends Plant Sci. 1996; 1: 389-394Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) that the sorting signal for cottonseed peroxisomal APX is located within a unique 41-amino acid C-terminal extension (including the single TMD domain) that is not found in cytosolic isoforms of APX. Experimental results supporting this premise were that a portion (36 C-terminal residues) of the peroxisomal APX extension was sufficient for sorting CAT (CAT-pAPX+36) from the cytosol to peroxisomes via pER in tobacco BY-2 cells (19.Mullen R.T. Lisenbee C.S. Miernyk J.A. Trelease R. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 2167-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). To identify regions within the C-terminal extension that possess the necessary sorting information, a series of HA epitope-tagged pAPX mutants with different C-terminal polypeptide truncations were constructed via PCR-based mutagenesis (TableI). In previous studies we showed that transiently expressed HA-pAPX (full-length cottonseed peroxisomal APX with a N-terminal HA epitope tag) sorted to pER and peroxisomes in BY-2 cells (19.Mullen R.T. Lisenbee C.S. Miernyk J.A. Trelease R. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 2167-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Results of a replicate experiment are presented as a control for the present study. Fig. 1 A shows in a representative single cell a reticular/circular (open arrows) and punctate (solid arrows) Cy2 immunofluorescence image attributable to the subcellular localizations of HA-pAPX to membranes of pER and individual peroxisomes, respectively. Evidence that the punctate image is peroxisomal is given in the double-labeling comparison of Fig.1 A compared with B. The punctate portion of HA-pAPX in the transformed cell (Fig. 1 A) is superimposable upon the punctate rhodamine pattern (solid arrows) attributable to endogenous catalase immunofluorescence in the same cell (Fig. 1 B). The non-colocalized HA-pAPX staining (Fig.1 A; open arrows) is the pER compartment. Immunofluorescence evidence that this HA-pAPX-stained compartment is pER is the superimposable confocal images of HA-pAPX immunofluorescence and 3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide-stained ER that is illustrated in a color overlay (Fig. 3, A–C) in a previous study (19.Mullen R.T. Lisenbee C.S. Miernyk J.A. Trelease R. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 2167-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). This ER compartment (pER) is readily recognized in the epifluorescence images that are used in the current study for presenting results of our experiments.Figure 3The C-terminal 29 amino acid residues of peroxisomal APX are sufficient for sorting CAT to peroxisomes via pER. Representative immunofluorescence images of cells transformed transiently with either CAT (A), CAT-pAPX+RKRMK (B), CAT-pAPX+11 (C), CAT-pAPX+20 (D), or CAT-pAPX+29 (E and F). Cells were fixed 20–24 h after biolistic bombardment, then permeabilized with pectolyase and Triton X-100, and incubated with anti-CAT IgGs and anti-mouse Cy2-conjugated IgGs as described under “Experimental Procedures.” F, shows the corresponding endogenous catalase immunofluorescence (anti-catalase IgGs and anti-rabbit rhodamine-conjugated IgGs) in globular (aggregated) peroxisomes in the same cells as E. Solid arrows (E andF) indicate obvious colocalizations, whereas open arrows (E) indicate obvious non-colocalizations of HA-pAPX in membranous/reticular pER and peroxisomal catalase. Thebar in A indicates 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Sorting of HA-pAPX to pER and/or peroxisomes was abolished when various C-terminal polypeptides were removed from the protein. HA-pAPX lacking its C-terminal 38 amino acid residues (HA-pAPX-38) accumulated throughout the non-organelle portion of the cytoplasm (cytosol) (Fig.1 C); compare this image with the reticular/circular, punctate image of HA-pAPX localization (Fig. 1 A). Similarly, a HA-pAPX construct that was truncated by either its 29 or 11 C-terminal residues (data not shown, see Table I) or lacking its C-terminal five amino acid residues (Fig. 1 D) also did not sort to pER and/or peroxisomes, i.e. the protein remained in the cytosol. These results clearly indicate that C-terminal residues within the peroxisomal APX extension are necessary for sorting to pER and peroxisomes in BY-2 cells. In one control experiment, authentication of the immunofluorescence patterns shown in Fig. 1, A, C, and Dwas reinforced by the absence of staining when anti-HA IgGs were omitted (Fig. 1 E). In a mock transformation control experiment, incubation of cells (bombarded with pRTL2) with anti-HA IgGs and conjugated Cy2 secondary antibodies did not produce any distinguishable immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 1 F). That the C-terminal five amino acid residues (RKRMK-COOH) of peroxisomal APX were minimally necessary for sorting (Fig.1 D) prompted us to examine this"

The paradigm is now well established for coactivators and corepressors to function as bridging molecules between transcription factors and either the basal transcription apparatus or chromatin components, resulting in the regulation of target genes (11.Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Modular transferable repression domains have emerged as a set of highly conserved structural motifs in families of transcription factors. These conserved repression domains include the BTB/POZ, WRPW, SNAG, SCAN, and Kruppel-associated box (KRAB)1 (12.Albagli O. Dhordain P. Deweindt C. Lecocq G. Leprince D.

We have focused on the KRAB domain as a model system for the analysis of repression modules (17.Friedman J.R. Fredericks W.J. Jensen D.E. Speicher D.W. Huang X.P. Neilson E.G. Rauscher III, F.J.

The KRAB domain was originally identified as a conserved motif at the NH2 terminus of zinc finger proteins (ZFPs) (13.Bellefroid E.J. Poncelet D.A. Lecocq P.J. Revelant O. Martial J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3608-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar) and was shown to be a potent, DNA binding-dependent transcriptional repression module (18.Margolin J.F.

Among the estimated 500–700 human Kruppel-type Cys2-His2 ZFPs (22.Klug A. Schwabe J.W. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar), one-third contain KRAB domains (13.Bellefroid E.J. Poncelet D.A. Lecocq P.J. Revelant O. Martial J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3608-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). The KRAB domain homology consists of approximately 75 amino acid residues and is predicted to fold into two amphipathic helices that are involved in protein/protein interactions (13.Bellefroid E.J. Poncelet D.A. Lecocq P.J. Revelant O. Martial J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3608-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 23.Rosati M. Marino M. Franze A. Tramontano A. Grimaldi G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5661-5667Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The minimal repression module is approximately 45 amino acid residues, and substitutions for conserved residues abolish repression (18.Margolin J.F. Friedman J.R. Meyer W.K. Vissing H. Theisen H.J. Rauscher III, F.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4509-4513Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). More than 10 independently encoded KRAB domains have been demonstrated to be potent repressors of transcription, suggesting that this activity is a common property of this domain. Thus, the KRAB-ZFP family represents a large class of transcriptional repressor molecules. KRAB-ZFPs appear to play important regulatory roles during cell differentiation and development. The KRAB-ZFPs ZNF43 and ZNF91 exhibit expression that is mainly restricted to lymphoid cells, suggesting roles as transcriptional regulators specific for lymphoid cell differentiation (24.Bellefroid E.J. Marine J.C. Ried T. Lecocq P.J. Riviere M. Amemiya C. Poncelet D.A. Coulie P.G. de Jong P. Szpirer C. Ward D.C. Martial J.A.

Other KRAB-ZFPs, such as HPF4, HTF10, and HTF34, are down-regulated during myeloid differentiation (13.Bellefroid E.J. Poncelet D.A. Lecocq P.J. Revelant O. Martial J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3608-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). SZF1, a KRAB-ZFP specific to CD34 stem cells, is down-regulated in differentiated hematopoietic derived cell lines (26.Liu C.

A number of KRAB-ZFPs are candidate genes for human diseases based on their chromosomal locations (27.Tommerup N. Aagaard L. Lund C.L. Boel E. Baxendale S. Bates G.P. Lehrach H. Vissing H. Hum. Mol.

There are more than 40 KRAB-ZFP-encoding genes that have been identified on human chromosome 19p13 and more than 10 KRAB-ZFP genes clustered on chromosome 19q13 (29.Shannon M. Ashworth L.K.

Some of these KRAB-ZFPs are selectively expressed in certain leukemia cell lines representing different lineages (31.Han Z.G. Zhang Q.H. Ye M. Kan L.X. Gu B.W. He K.L. Shi S.L. Zhou J. Fu G. Mao M. Chen S.J., Yu, L. Chen Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35741-35748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that KRAB domain repression may be mediated by a common cellular co-factor. We identified and cloned a protein, KAP-1, that binds to the KRAB repression domain using affinity chromatography (17.Friedman J.R. Fredericks W.J. Jensen D.E. Speicher D.W. Huang X.P. Neilson E.G. Rauscher III, F.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2067-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). This protein was subsequently identified by other investigators in yeast two-hybrid screens and designated TIF1β and KRIP-1 (32.Moosmann P. Georgiev O. Le Douarin B. Bourquin J.P. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4859-4867Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 33.Kim S.S. Chen Y.M. O'Leary E. Witzgall R. Vidal M. Bonventre J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15299-15304Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). KAP-1 is a member of an emerging superfamily of transcriptional co-regulators, including TIF1α and TIF1γ (17.Friedman J.R. Fredericks W.J. Jensen D.E. Speicher D.W. Huang X.P. Neilson E.G. Rauscher III, F.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2067-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar, 34.Le Douarin B. Zechel C. Garnier J.M.

Koken M.H. Mattei M.G. Ganser A. Chambon P. Losson R. de The H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1209-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The TIF1 family encodes the signature RBCC motif that designates the RING-B box-coiled-coil tripartite structure. This motif probably functions as a cooperative protein/protein interaction motif (19.Peng H. Begg G.E. Schultz D.C. Friedman J.R. Jensen D.E. Speicher D.W. Rauscher III, F.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 1139-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 36.Saurin A.J. Borden K.L. Boddy M.N. Freemont P.S. Trends Biochem.

The definitive element of the tripartite motif is the RING finger, which is found almost exclusively in the NH2-terminal position in RBCC proteins and is likely to contribute specificity and/or multimerization properties to the tripartite motif. Mutational analyses have confirmed the requirement for the RING finger for proper biological function (for reviews, see Refs. 36.Saurin A.J. Borden K.L. Boddy M.N. Freemont P.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 208-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 37.Borden K.L. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 38.Boddy M.N.

Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1563-1571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The second signature motif of the RBCC domain is the B-box (40.Reddy B.A. Etkin L.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6330Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Two B-box motifs are often found immediately COOH-terminal to the RING finger in the RBCC domain. The third RBCC signature motif is a coiled-coil domain that displays helical amphipathic character and is probably required for homo- or heterotypic interaction. Many biological functions of RBCC proteins have been shown to be dependent on multimerization via this coiled-coil region (36.Saurin A.J. Borden K.L. Boddy M.N. Freemont P.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 208-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). KAP-1 appears to function as a universal corepressor for KRAB domain proteins (17.Friedman J.R. Fredericks W.J. Jensen D.E. Speicher D.W. Huang X.P. Neilson E.G. Rauscher III, F.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2067-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). The RBCC domain of KAP-1 is both necessary and sufficient for the KRAB domain binding (19.Peng H. Begg G.E. Schultz D.C. Friedman J.R. Jensen D.E. Speicher D.W. Rauscher III, F.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 1139-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Oligomerization of the KAP-1-RBCC is required for binding KRAB domain, and all three components of the tripartite motif appear to cooperate in KRAB recognition. The central region of KAP-1 contains the HP1 binding domain (HP1BD), which directly binds to mammalian homologues of the heterochromatin protein, HP1 (41.Ryan R.F. Schultz D.C. Ayyanathan K. Singh P.B. Friedman J.R. Fredericks W.J. Rauscher III, F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4366-4378Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). A stable quaternary complex can be formed between DNA, a KRAB-ZFP, KAP-1, and HP1. The COOH terminus of KAP-1 includes a plant homeo-domain finger and bromodomain, and this region is able to repress transcription when tethered to DNA using a heterologous DNA-binding domain. 2D. Schultz, unpublished data. Thus, KAP-1 is composed of an independent KRAB-recognition domain and at least two independent repression domains. It has been firmly established that KAP-1 is required for KRAB domain-mediated transcriptional repression. The evidence includes the following. 1) KAP-1 binds to multiple KRAB repression domains bothin vitro and in vivo; 2) KRAB domain mutations that abolish repression decrease or eliminate KAP-1 binding; 3) overexpression of KAP-1 enhances KRAB-mediated repression; 4) the KRAB domain does not repress in cells that lack KAP-1. These results support a model in which KRAB-ZFPs repress transcription by recruiting the KAP-1 corepressor via the RBCC domain. To understand the interaction between the KRAB domain and KAP-1 in more detail, we have purified the KRAB domain and employed a comprehensive set of biochemical and biophysical approaches to analyze the complex. The plasmids pQE30 GAL4-KRAB-(1–90), pQE30 KOX1-KRAB, GST-KRAB, GST-KRAB(DV), pQE30 KAP-1-RBCC, and pVL1392 KAP-1-RBCC have been described previously (17.Friedman J.R. Fredericks W.J. Jensen D.E. Speicher D.W. Huang X.P. Neilson E.G. Rauscher III, F.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2067-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar, 18.Margolin J.F. Friedman J.R. Meyer W.K. Vissing H. Theisen H.J. Rauscher III, F.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4509-4513Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 19.Peng H. Begg G.E. Schultz D.C. Friedman J.R. Jensen D.E. Speicher D.W. Rauscher III, F.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 1139-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The pQE30 KOX1-(1–161) plasmid was generated via polymerase chain reaction using KOX1 cDNA as a template. A 5′ oligonucleotide, which incorporated a BamHI site 5′ to the initiation methionine, and a 3′ oligonucleotide, which incorporated a stop codon preceding a HindIII site after amino acid 161 of KOX1, were used to amplify the desired sequence. The polymerase chain reaction product was digested and cloned into the corresponding sites of the pQE30 vector (Qiagen). The protein thus contains the NH2-terminal amino acid residues MRGSHHHHHHGS, followed by residues 1–161 of the KOX1 protein. The pQE30 KAP-1-(22–618) plasmid was generated by subcloning an XmaI/XmaI fragment encoding residues 22–618 of human KAP-1 from a pBluescript II SK+ that contained the full-length human KAP-1 cDNA (17.Friedman J.R. Fredericks W.J. Jensen D.E. Speicher D.W. Huang X.P. Neilson E.G. Rauscher III, F.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2067-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar) into the corresponding sites of pQE30 (Qiagen). The protein contains the NH2-terminal amino acid residues MRGSHHHHHHGSACELGT, followed by residues 22–618 of the KAP-1 protein and then the COOH-terminal sequence GRPAAKLN encoded by the vector. DNA sequencing of both strands confirmed all of the plasmids generated by polymerase chain reaction. The purification of KOX1-KRAB protein was performed at room temperature under denaturing conditions followed by renaturation on the column (42.Shi P.Y. Maizels N. Weiner A.M. BioTechniques. 1997; 23: 1036-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) as described previously (19.Peng H. Begg G.E. Schultz D.C. Friedman J.R. Jensen D.E. Speicher D.W. Rauscher III, F.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 1139-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The KAP-1-RBCC protein expressed from bacterial and baculovirus vectors was purified using nondenaturing conditions as described previously (19.Peng H. Begg G.E. Schultz D.C. Friedman J.R. Jensen D.E. Speicher D.W. Rauscher III, F.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 1139-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). To reconstitute the complex, the KAP-1-RBCC and the KOX1-(1–161) proteins were first purified under denaturing conditions and then eluted from the Ni2+-NTA-agarose with 300 mmimidazole and pH 4.5. The eluted KOX1-(1–161) and KAP-1-RBCC proteins were then mixed at a 1:1 molar ratio in a volume of 20 ml of buffer containing 8 m urea, 0.1 m sodium phosphate, 0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 20 μmZnSO4, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. These proteins were then renatured during dialysis by a stepwise 1:1 serial dilution of urea from 4 to 0 m in P300 buffer (10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.4 mmKH2PO4, 2.7 mm KCl, 450 mm NaCl, pH 7.0, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) plus 10% glycerol, 20 μm ZnSO4, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol using five changes of the buffer over a 2-day period. After dialysis, the insoluble protein was removed by centrifugation, and the soluble fraction was concentrated in an Amicon concentrator. The soluble KOX1-KRAB protein derived from on-column renaturation was chromatographed on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column equilibrated in P300 buffer plus 10% glycerol and 10 mm polyoxyethylene 5-octyl ether (C8E5) (Sigma). The KAP-1-(22–618) protein and the KOX1-(1–161)·KAP-1-RBCC complex were purified using a Superose 6 HR 10/30 column equilibrated with the P300 buffer plus 10% glycerol. The columns were run at 4 °C at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, and 0.5- or 1-ml fractions were collected. Aliquots of each fraction were analyzed for protein content by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. EMSA was performed essentially as described previously (19.Peng H. Begg G.E. Schultz D.C.

The purified recombinant GAL4-KRAB was incubated with purified Escherichia coli- or baculovirus-expressed KAP-1-RBCC protein for 15 min at 30 °C. In the competition assays, the KRAB protein was added to the reaction simultaneously with the GAL4-KRAB and KAP-1-RBCC proteins, or the KRAB protein was pre-incubated with the KAP-1-RBCC protein for 15 min at 30 °C. One μl of 32P-labeled GAL4 probe (105 cpm/μl) was then added, and the reaction was incubated for an additional 15 min at 30 °C. The DNA-protein complexes were resolved on native polyacrylamide gels by electrophoresis in 45 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3, 1 mm EDTA buffer at 4 °C. The EMSA gels were dried and visualized by autoradiography. The GAL4 probe was the double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotide 5′-GAT CCC GGA GGA CAG TAC TCC GT-3′, which was labeled with [32P]ATP as described (43.Fredericks W.J. Galili N. Mukhopadhyay S. Rovera G. Bennicelli J. Barr F.G. Rauscher III, F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1522-1535Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The CD spectra (190–240 nm) were measured on a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter (Japan Spectroscopic Co.) at 25 °C. The CD spectra were recorded using a 100-μl cell containing a 0.2-mm path length. The sample was at a concentration of 1 mg/ml in P300 buffer plus 10% glycerol. Spectra were analyzed using the SOFTSPEC software supplied by the manufacturer. Prior to analytical ultracentrifugation, the proteins were purified by gel filtration. The KOX1-KRAB protein in P300 buffer plus 10% glycerol was incubated with 20 mm C8E5 for 1 h at 4 °C by rotation to attempt to dissociate aggregates before gel filtration. The KOX1-KRAB protein was then subjected to gel filtration in the same buffer containing 10 mm C8E5. The KAP-1-(22–618) protein was purified by gel filtration in P300 buffer plus 10% glycerol without detergent. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed in an Optima XL-I ultracentrifuge, using either the absorbance (280 nm) optics (for KOX1-KRAB) or the interference optics (for KAP-1-(22–618)) to measure the protein concentration gradient. For each experiment, three cells were assembled with 12-mm double-sector centerpieces and quartz or sapphire windows, respectively. The cells were loaded with 110 μl of reference buffer (P300 plus 10% glycerol) or 110 μl of sample at three different protein concentrations. The experiments were performed at 4 °C and using various speeds between 16,000 and 43,400 rpm. The absorbance or fringe displacement data were collected every 6 h until equilibrium was reached, as determined by comparing successive scans using the MATCH program, and the data were edited using the REEDIT program. Analysis of sedimentation equilibrium data was performed using the NONLIN program (44.Johnson M.L. Correia J.J. Yphantis D.A. Halvorson H.R. Biophys. J. 1981; 36: 575-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). The partial specific volume of the protein was calculated according to Laue et al. (45.Laue T.M. Shah B. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton L.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge1992Google Scholar). Three data sets from different loading concentrations were fitted simultaneously. Examination of the residuals and minimization of the variance determined the goodness of fit. The KOX1-(1–161)·KAP-1-RBCC complex, which was formed by co-renaturation as described above was purified by gel filtration, and the peak fraction of the complex was concentrated by deoxycholate-trichloroacetic acid precipitation (46.Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7141) Google Scholar). The precipitated proteins were resuspended in 30 μl of 0.1m NaOH and resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE with known amounts of KOX1-(1–161) and KAP-1-RBCC proteins. The proteins were visualized with Coomassie Blue stain and quantitated by densitometry on a MultiImage Light Cabinet instrument (Alpha Innotechnology). The data were analyzed with the program AlphaImager 2000 version 4.03. The preparation of the GST fusion proteins and the GST association assays were performed essentially as described previously (41.Ryan R.F. Schultz D.C. Ayyanathan K. Singh P.B. Friedman J.R. Fredericks W.J. Rauscher III, F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4366-4378Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μg of freshly prepared GST fusion protein immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose was incubated with 10 μg of Ni2+-NTA-purified recombinant His6-tagged protein in 100 μl of BB500 buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 500 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 500 μg of bovine serum albumin (fraction V)) for 1 h at room temperature. The protein complexes were washed four times with BB750 (20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 750 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and the bound proteins were eluted in 5× Laemmli buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and visualized with Coomassie Blue stain. Kinetic studies of the direct protein/protein interaction between the KRAB domain and KAP-1 were done using optical biosensors-BIAX and BIA3000 Instruments (Biacore, Inc. Uppsala, Sweden). All experiments were done at 25 °C. The Biacore TM sensor surface CM5 was activated by a 7-min incubation with amine coupling reagent as recommended by the manufacturer. The amine coupling reagents were N-hydroxysuccinimide andN-ethyl-N′-(dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (Biacore, Inc.). One hundred μl of anti-GST polyclonal antibody (Biacore, Inc.) at a concentration of 10–50 μg/ml in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, was then injected at a flow rate of 5 μl/min, resulting in 4000 response units being captured. The remaining coupling sites were blocked by injection of 35 μl of ethanolamine-HCl (Biacore, Inc.). After equilibration with P300 buffer plus 10% glycerol, the purified recombinant GST-KRAB and GST-KRAB(DV-AA) proteins were captured via the GST tag and anti-GST antibody. The reference surfaces include both the anti-GST antibody surface and the captured GST-KRAB(DV-AA) surface, respectively. The GST-KRAB(DV-AA) surface displayed the same density as GST-KRAB. The purpose of two reference surfaces is to normalize the refractive index changes between reference and specific sensor surfaces and to measure the contribution of the anti-GST antibody to the total signal, respectively. The experimental GST-KRAB surface was 100 response units. A 300-μl sample of KAP-1-(22–618) protein at concentrations of 530 nm to 4 μm in P300 buffer plus 10% glycerol was added to the GST-KRAB and GST-KRAB(DV) surfaces and allowed to bind for 5 min. The flow cells then were washed with P300 buffer plus 10% glycerol. The binding surface of GST-KRAB was regenerated with injection of 0.2% SDS solution in 1% Me2SO and 15 mm of NaOH, pH 9.5, in two or three pulses by previously described methods (47.Andersson K. Hamalainen M. Malmqvist M. Biasymposium ‘98. Biacore, Edinburgh1998Google Scholar). The sample loop was then washed with P300 buffer plus 10% glycerol after regeneration steps to avoid “carry-over” of bulk signal. The data reported were obtained from two independent experiments. The data were collected automatically and analyzed subsequently with BIAevaluation"

In plants, PABP also interacts with eIF4B, a factor that assists eIF4F function. PABP is a phosphoprotein, although the function of its phosphorylation has not been previously investigated. In this study, we have purified the phosphorylated and hypophosphorylated isoforms of PABP from wheat to examine whether its phosphorylation state affects its binding to poly(A) RNA and its interaction with eIF4G, eIFiso4G, or eIF4B. Phosphorylated PABP exhibited cooperative binding to poly(A) RNA even under non-stoichiometric binding conditions, whereas multiple molecules of hypophosphorylated PABP bound to poly(A) RNA only after free poly(A) RNA was no longer available. Together, phosphorylated and hypophosphorylated PABP exhibited synergistic binding. eIF4B interacted with PABP in a phosphorylation state-specific manner; native eIF4B increased the RNA binding activity specifically of phosphorylated PABP and was greater than 14-fold more effective than was recombinant eIF4B, whereas eIF4F promoted the cooperative binding of hypophosphorylated PABP. These data suggest that the phosphorylation state of PABP specifies the type of binding to poly(A) RNA and its interaction with its partner proteins.

Until a few years ago, models of translation initiation focused solely on molecular events occurring at the 5′ end of an mRNA. However, several studies in plants, yeast, and animal cells have suggested that the poly(A)-binding protein (PABP),1 which binds the poly(A) tail at the 3′ terminus of an mRNA, is a necessary participant during translation initiation (reviewed in Ref. 1.Gallie D.R. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 216: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Suppressor mutants that overcome the lethality imposed by apab1 mutation in yeast were found to contain mutations affecting 60 S ribosomal subunit biogenesis, thereby disrupting the ratio of large and small ribosomal subunits (2.Sachs A. Davis R.W. Cell. 1989; 58: 857-867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 3.Sachs A.B. Davis R.W. Science. 1990; 247: 1077-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The 5′ cap structure (m7GpppN) and the poly(A) tail, both of which are translational regulatory elements, were found to be functionally co-dependent in vivo (4.Gallie D.R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2108-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar), indicating that PABP participates in a step during translation that requires the participation of those initiation factors associated with the 5′ cap. Yeast Pab1p is required to mediate the increase in translation conferred by the poly(A) tail and the Pab1p-poly(A) tail complex was shown to promote 40 S ribosomal subunit recruitment to an mRNA (5.Tarun S.Z. Sachs A.B. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2997-3007Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). During initiation, the 5′ cap is bound by eIF4E, the small subunit of eIF4F. eIF4G, the large subunit of eIF4F, serves as a platform for the interaction and assembly of multiple initiation factors, including eIF4E, eIF4A (whose RNA helicase and ATPase activities are required for unwinding RNA secondary structure), and eIF3 (responsible for 40 S ribosomal subunit recruitment) (6.Lamphear B.J.

Ravel J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 330-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). A direct interaction between PABP and eIF4G or eIFiso4G has been demonstrated in plants, animals, and yeast (10.Le H. Tanguay R.L. Balasta M.L. Wei C.-C. Browning K.S. Metz A.M. Goss D.J. Gallie D.R.

The prediction that such an interaction would maintain the termini of the mRNA in close physical proximity resulting in a circular conformation (15.Gallie D.R. Plant Mol.

Cell. 1998; 2: 135-140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). In addition to the interaction between PABP and eIF4G, there are additional interactions between PABP and other initiation factors that may be species-specific. An interaction between PABP and eIF4B, a factor that assists in the function of eIF4F, has been demonstrated in plants (10.Le H. Tanguay R.L. Balasta M.L. Wei C.-C. Browning K.S. Metz A.M. Goss D.J. Gallie D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16247-16255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) that has not yet been reported in yeast or animals. An interaction between PABP and PAIP (i.e. PABP-interacting protein), which shares similarity to the eIF3/eIF4A interaction domain of eIF4G, has been reported recently in mammalian cells (17.Craig A.W.B. Haghighat A., Yu, A.T.K. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1998; 392: 520-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Moreover, there appear to be differences in the requirements of the PABP-eIF4G interaction among eukaryotes; binding to poly(A) RNA is a prerequisite for yeast PABP to interact with eIF4G (11.Tarun S.Z. Sachs A.B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7168-7177Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar), whereas plant or animal PABP exhibit no such requirement (10.Le H. Tanguay R.L. Balasta M.L. Wei C.-C. Browning K.S. Metz A.M. Goss D.J. Gallie D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16247-16255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 13.Imataka H. Gradi A. Sonenberg N.

Two functional consequences of the interaction between these initiation factors and PABP that are pertinent to the commitment of the translational machinery to an mRNA have been demonstrated. eIFiso4G and eIF4B not only individually increase the binding affinity of PABP for poly(A) but, together, eIF4F (or eIFiso4F) and eIF4B exert a synergistic effect on PABP binding activity (10.Le H. Tanguay R.L. Balasta M.L. Wei C.-C. Browning K.S. Metz A.M. Goss D.J. Gallie D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16247-16255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), suggesting a functional interaction between all three proteins. A second consequence of their interaction is to increase the binding affinity of eIF4F (or eIFiso4F) for the 5′ cap structure (18.Wei C.-C. Balasta M.L. Ren J. Goss D.J. Biochem. 1998; 37: 1910-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), demonstrating that the interaction of eIF4G (or eIFiso4G) with PABP results in the mutual stabilization of eIF4E (or eIFiso4E) and PABP to their respective target regulatory elements. Taken together, these studies provide strong evidence suggesting that the role of PABP during translation initiation involves protein-protein interactions with one or more of these initiation factors that, as a result, maintain the 5′ and 3′ termini of an mRNA in close physical proximity. The functional interaction between the cap and the poly(A) tail is repressed following serum starvation in mammalian cells but can be reversed by exposure of the cells to insulin (19.Gallie D.R. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7174-7179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The addition of either insulin or serum promotes rapid phosphorylation of eIF4E, eIF4G, eIF4B (20.Frederickson R.M. Montine K.S. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2896-2900Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 21.Morley S.J. Traugh J.A. Biochimie (Paris). 1993; 75: 985-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 22.Pause A.

Nature. 1994; 371: 762-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar), and the eIF4E-binding protein (i.e. 4E-BP or PHAS-I), resulting in its release from eIF4E (23.Hu C. Pang S. Kong X. Velleca M. Lawrence J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3730-3734Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 24.Morley S.J. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10611-10616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and promotes the association between eIF4G and PABP (14.Fraser C.S. Pain V.W. Morley S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 196-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In plants, PABP and several of the initiation factors are known to be phosphorylated. As in yeast and sea urchin (25.Drawbridge J. Grainger J.L. Winkler M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3994-4006Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), plant PABP is present as multiple phosphorylated species, which is dephosphorylated by alkaline phosphatase, confirming the nature of the modification (26.Gallie D.R. Le H. Caldwell C. Tanguay R.L. Hoang N.X. Browning K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1046-1053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Plant eIF4B is also present as multiple phosphorylated species and its phosphorylation state is regulated during development or following heat stress (26.Gallie D.R. Le H. Caldwell C. Tanguay R.L. Hoang N.X. Browning K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1046-1053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). eIF4B undergoes dephosphorylation following phosphatase treatment, and the array of phosphorylated eIF4B species observed in vivo can be recapitulated by phosphorylation of nonphosphorylated eIF4B by casein kinase II (26.Gallie D.R. Le H. Caldwell C. Tanguay R.L. Hoang N.X. Browning K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1046-1053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). eIF4A has been shown to be phosphorylated following environmental stress such as hypoxia or heat shock (26.Gallie D.R. Le H. Caldwell C. Tanguay R.L. Hoang N.X. Browning K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1046-1053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 27.Webster C. Gaut R.L. Browning K.S. Ravel J.M. Roberts J.K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266 (22346): 23341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other plant initiation factors subject to phosphorylation include eIF2α, eIF2β, and eIFiso4G (26.Gallie D.R. Le H. Caldwell C. Tanguay R.L. Hoang N.X. Browning K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1046-1053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 28.Le H. Browning K.S. Gallie D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20084-20089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These observations raise the possibility that the phosphorylation state of those proteins mediating the functional interaction between the cap and the poly(A) tail, i.e. PABP, eIF4B, and eIF4G or eIFiso4G might determine the extent of their interaction with RNA or with each other. To investigate whether their phosphorylation state influences their binding activities, we examined their interaction with one another and with RNA when present in different phosphorylation states. Phosphorylated PABP exhibited cooperative binding to poly(A) RNA even under non-stoichiometric binding conditions (i.e.excess RNA), hypophosphorylated PABP bound non-cooperatively, and their combination resulted in synergistic binding. The phosphorylation state of PABP also determined the specificity of its interaction with initiation factors; the RNA binding activity of phosphorylated PABP was enhanced by eIF4B, whereas the RNA binding activity of hypophosphorylated PABP was enhanced by eIF4F. eIFiso4F enhanced the RNA binding activity of PABP in either phosphorylation state. Those factors that interacted with phosphorylated PABP increased its affinity for poly(A), whereas those that interacted with hypophosphorylated PABP enhanced its cooperative binding to poly(A) RNA. Phosphorylated eIF4B was more than 14-fold more effective in its functional interaction with PABP than was nonphosphorylated eIF4B. Similarly, native eIFiso4G was substantially more effective than was recombinant eIFiso4G in increasing PABP binding activity. Together, these data suggest that the phosphorylation state of PABP and its partner proteins serves to determine the specificity and extent of their interactions. The T7-based constructs containing a poly(A)25 or poly(A)50 tract have been described previously (29.Gallie D.R. Lucas W.J. Walbot V. Plant Cell. 1989; 1: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). DNA concentration was quantitated spectrophotometrically following linearization and brought to 0.5 mg/ml. In vitrotranscription was carried out as described previously (30.Yisraeli J.K. Melton D.A. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 42-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) using 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 6 mm MgCl2, 100 μg/ml BSA, 0.5 mm each of ATP, CTP, UTP, and GTP, 10 mm DTT, 0.3 units/μl RNasin (Promega), and 0.5 units/μl T7 RNA polymerase. Radiolabeled probes were made as uncapped RNAs using [α-32P]ATP. The full-length transcripts were resolved and electroeluted from 4% polyacrylamide gels, and quantitation of RNA yields were determined spectrophotometrically. For all steps in its purification (31.Le H. Chang S.-C. Tanguay R.L. Gallie D.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 350-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), PABP activity was followed using binding to poly(A) RNA as determined by complex formation using gel shift analysis. Briefly, the 25–60% saturated ammonium sulfate fraction of wheat germ extract was applied to Affi-blue Gel (Bio-Rad) equilibrated in Buffer B (100 mm KAc, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgAc, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm disodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, and 1 mm PMSF). The column was washed with Buffer B containing 4 m NaCl. PABP was eluted with Buffer B containing 2 m guanidine-HCl. The eluted protein was dialyzed overnight against several changes of 10 mm KCl, 20% glycerol, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm disodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate. Following dialysis, the solution was brought to 8m urea and 2% (final concentration) ampholytes (pH 3–10) were added and the PABP isoforms resolved using a Bio-Rad preparative isoelectric focusing apparatus. Each fraction was examined using two-dimensional/Western analysis to identify the isoforms present. Each isoform was then dialyzed against Buffer B and applied to a poly(A)-Sepharose 4B affinity column equilibrated in Buffer B. PABP was eluted with Buffer B containing 1 m urea and 2m LiCl and dialyzed against 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm disodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate. Wheat germ eIF4F, eIFiso4F (32.Browning K.S. Webster C. Roberts J.K.M. Ravel J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10096-10100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and eIF4B (33.Browning K.S. Maia D.M. Lax S.R. Ravel J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 538-541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were purified as described. Recombinant eIFiso4G and eIFiso4E were purified as described (34.van Heerden A. Browning K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17454-17457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For all gel shift assays, radiolabeled poly(A)25 and poly(A)50 RNA were synthesizedin vitro and gel-purified to remove the DNA template, unincorporated nucleotides, and less than full-length RNA. 1 ng of radiolabeled RNA and the indicated amount of protein were used for the binding reactions in a 15-μl volume containing 25 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgAc, 0.1 mm EDTA, 100 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mg/ml yeast RNA, and 1 mm Mg-ATP for 15 min at 4 °C. Following incubation, 2 μl of 80% glycerol and 2 μl of 0.25 mg/ml heparin was added and the reaction incubated for an additional 10 min at 4 °C. The RNA-protein complexes were resolved on a native 4% polyacrylamide gel, dried, and analyzed by autoradiography. Total soluble protein extracts were prepared from control and heat-shocked (25 min at 45 °C) wheat leaves by grinding tissue in a mortar with liquid nitrogen and then in aqueous buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 120 mm KOAc, 5 mmMgOAc, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm okadaic acid). The cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation and the protein concentration determined. Depending on the factor examined, 5–100 μg of protein was loaded on IEF tube gels (3.6% acrylamide, 9 m urea, 2% ampholytes, 2% Nonidet P-40) and run at 400 V for 4.5 h, followed by 0.5 h at 500 V. The protein was then resolved in the second dimension using standard SDS-PAGE and the protein transferred to 0.22-μm nitrocellulose membrane by electroblotting. Following transfer, the nitrocellulose membranes were blocked in 5% milk, 0.01% thimerosal in TPBS (0.1% Tween 20, 13.7 mm NaCl, 0.27 mm KCl, 1 mm Na2HPO4, 0.14 mmKH2PO4) followed by incubation with primary antibodies diluted typically 1:1000 to 1:2000 in TPBS with 1% milk for 1.5 h. The blots were then washed twice with TPBS and incubated with goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc.) diluted to 1:10,000 for 1 h. The blots were washed twice with TPBS, and the signal detected typically between 1 and 15 min using chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The pH range of the IEF gel following isoelectric focusing was determined from the measurements of 5-mm sections of a control gel soaked in 1 ml of 15 mm NaCl. Leaves of seedlings germinated for 60 h were incubated at room temperature or heat-shocked at 45 °C for 25 min in Gamborg's medium supplemented with 10 mmCaCl2, pH 5.8, and then ground in liquid nitrogen, followed by grinding in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 3 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μm okadaic acid, 1% each of Triton A-100, Tween 40, and Nonidet P-40. The extract was centrifuged twice at 9000 rpm for 15 min to remove cell debris. Seven mg of soluble protein extract was added to a 100-μl suspension of m7GTP-Sepharose or poly(A)-agarose resin and incubated with rotation at 4 °C for 3 h. The resin was collected by centrifugation (800 × g for 1 min) and washed twice with 400 μl of the grinding buffer. Protein eluted from the resin was then resolved by SDS-PAGE and subject to Western analysis. PABP is present in multiple isoforms in yeast, sea urchin, and wheat (25.Drawbridge J. Grainger J.L. Winkler M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3994-4006Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 26.Gallie D.R. Le H. Caldwell C. Tanguay R.L. Hoang N.X. Browning K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1046-1053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and the nature of its modification in plants was demonstrated to be due to phosphorylation through conversion of purified phosphorylated PABP to its hypophosphorylated state following phosphatase treatment (26.Gallie D.R. Le H. Caldwell C. Tanguay R.L. Hoang N.X. Browning K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1046-1053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In order to investigate how the phosphorylation state affects the RNA binding activity of PABP, the protein was purified from wheat (Fig.1, top panel) and the isoforms resolved using preparative isoelectric focusing. Separation of the most phosphorylated isoforms from the hypophosphorylated isoforms was verified using two-dimensional Western analysis (Fig. 1, middle and bottom panels). To determine whether the phosphorylation state of PABP specifies its RNA binding activity, binding reactions with radiolabeled poly(A) RNA and PABP in each phosphorylated state alone were carried out and the resulting complexes resolved using gel shift analysis. Additionally, combinatorial binding reactions with poly(A)50 RNA were performed in which the concentration of PABP in one phosphorylated state was held constant while PABP in the other phosphorylated state was added in increasing amounts. The size of the poly(A)-binding site of PABP is 12 residues, but its packing density is 25 residues in yeast (35.Sachs A.B. Davis R.W. Kornberg R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3268-3276Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) or approximately 27 residues in mammalian cells (36.Baer B.W. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1890-1892Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar); consequently, poly(A)50 RNA should be long enough to accommodate at least two molecules of PABP. A single complex was formed between PABP and poly(A)50 RNA when the protein was either phosphorylated (Fig. 2 B,lanes 2–6) or hypophosphorylated (Fig.2 A, lanes 2–6). However, migration of the phosphorylated PABP·poly(A)50 complex was considerably retarded relative to the hypophosphorylated PABP·poly(A)50 complex (Fig. 2, compare lanes 2–6 of panel B and panel A, respectively). The slower migration of the phosphorylated PABP·poly(A)50 RNA complex is consistent with multimeric binding of the protein to the RNA, i.e. 2 or more molecules of PABP bound to poly(A) RNA. Moreover, this multimeric binding occurs under non-stoichiometric binding conditions, i.e. an excess of poly(A)50 RNA remained unbound, suggesting that phosphorylated PABP binds poly(A) RNA cooperatively. Phosphorylated PABP exhibited a lower affinity for poly(A) relative to hypophosphorylated PABP; at least a 10-fold greater concentration of phosphorylated PABP was required to achieve a level of RNA binding similar to that observed for hypophosphorylated PABP (Fig. 2, comparelane 5 in panel B tolane 3 in panel A). To examine whether the RNA binding activity of PABP present in one phosphorylated state could be affected when PABP of the opposite phosphorylated state was present, different combinations of PABP in each phosphorylated state were tested in the binding assay. The addition of just 0.16–0.48 nm hypophosphorylated PABP to a binding reaction containing 2 nm phosphorylated PABP resulted in a substantial increase in multimeric binding (Fig.2 A, lanes 7–10). Identical results were obtained when the reverse experiment was performed; the addition of 1–3 nm phosphorylated PABP to a binding reaction containing 0.32 nm hypophosphorylated PABP resulted in enhanced multimeric binding (Fig. 2 B, lanes 8–10), data suggesting cooperativity between phosphorylated and hypophosphorylated PABP. Cooperative binding by the combination of phosphorylated and hypophosphorylated PABP was more extensive at the lowest concentration tested than that exhibited by phosphorylated PABP alone at the highest concentration tested (Fig.2 B, compare lane 8 to lane 6, respectively), suggesting that phosphorylated and hypophosphorylated PABP have a greater affinity for one another than exists between molecules of phosphorylated PABP. To examine the binding characteristics of each PABP isoform to RNAs of different lengths, binding experiments between poly(A)25 or poly(A)50 RNA (a length sufficient to accommodate one or two molecules of PABP, respectively) and PABP in each phosphorylated state were performed. The multimeric, phosphorylated PABP·poly(A)50 RNA complex (Fig.3 A, lane 8), the monomeric, hypophosphorylated PABP·poly(A)50 RNA complex (Fig. 3 A,lane 9), and the synergistic binding exhibited by their combination (Fig. 3 A, lane 10) were observed as they had been in Fig. 2. Binding of hypophosphorylated PABP to poly(A)25 RNA resulted in a single complex that migrated to the same position as the hypophosphorylated PABP·poly(A)50 RNA complex (Fig. 3 A, comparelane 5 to lane 9). A single, rapidly migrating complex was also observed when phosphorylated PABP bound poly(A)25 RNA (Fig. 3 A,lanes 2 and 3). The phosphorylated PABP·poly(A)25 complex migrated slightly faster than did the hypophosphorylated PABP·poly(A)25 complex (Fig.3 A, compare lanes 4 and 5to lanes 2 and 3) as a consequence of its greater negative charge. When both phosphorylated and hypophosphorylated PABP were present in the binding reaction containing poly(A)25 RNA, complexes corresponding to those observed for phosphorylated PABP·poly(A)25 and hypophosphorylated PABP·poly(A)25 were observed as was an additional, slower migrating complex (Fig. 3 A, lane 6) that corresponded to the multimeric complex formed by phosphorylated PABP·poly(A)50 RNA (Fig. 3 A, lane 8), suggesting an interaction between complexes of phosphorylated and hypophosphorylated PABP bound to poly(A)25 RNA that was not observed at a similar concentration of PABP in either phosphorylation state alone. Whether one or both molecules of PABP are bound to poly(A)25 RNA cannot be determined from this experiment. To determine the binding characteristics of phosphorylated and hypophosphorylated PABP under stoichiometric conditions, binding assays were performed using a high concentration of PABP in each phosphorylation state and either poly(A)25 or poly(A)50 RNA. At a high concentration of phosphorylated PABP, at least four poly(A)25 complexes were observed (Fig.3 B, lanes 6 and 7), including the rapidly migrating complex observed for phosphorylated PABP·poly(A)25 (Fig. 3 A, lanes 2 and 3) and the slowly migrating complex observed for phosphorylated PABP·poly(A)50 RNA (Fig. 3,lane 8 in panel A andlane 3 in panel B). Binding of hypophosphorylated PABP at a high concentration to poly(A)25 RNA (Fig. 3 B, lane 9) did not result in the appearance of a complex larger than that observed at a lower concentration of the hypophosphorylated PABP (Fig. 3 B, lane 8). However, binding of hypophosphorylated PABP at a high concentration to poly(A)50 RNA did result in a prominent slower migrating complex (Fig. 3 B, lane 5). The observation that cooperative binding of phosphorylated PABP to poly(A)50 RNA occurs under excess RNA conditions (Fig.2 B, lanes 2–6) or following near-stoichiometric binding (Fig. 3 B, lane 3), whereas the binding of a second molecule of hypophosphorylated PABP to poly(A)50 RNA follows binding of the first molecule, i.e. following stoichiometric binding (Fig. 3 B, lane 5), indicates that multimeric binding of hypophosphorylated PABP is limited to when no free RNA is available and to an RNA sufficiently long to accommodate multiple PABPs. In contrast, phosphorylated PABP exhibits cooperative binding to poly(A)50 RNA under non-stoichiometric conditions (Fig. 2 B, lanes 2–6). Moreover, the multiple complexes formed following binding of phosphorylated PABP to poly(A)25 RNA suggests extensive protein-protein interactions between the complexes. These data suggest that phosphorylated PABP exhibits a high degree of protein-protein interaction whether it be while binding to the same RNA (e.g. poly(A)50 RNA) or between complexes when the RNA is not long enough to accommodate more than one PABP molecule (e.g. poly(A)25 RNA). The fact that the binding of multiple molecules of hypophosphorylated PABP to poly(A) was observed only with poly(A)50 RNA and only following stoichiometric binding indicates that the binding of hypophosphorylated PABP to poly(A) is determined by its concentration and the length of the RNA with little contribution made by protein-protein interaction. When binding to poly(A)50 RNA was analyzed using purified PABP that is unfractionated (i.e. containing all isoforms), complexes were observed (Fig. 4) that were similar to those resulting from the combination of hypophosphorylated and phosphorylate"

WbpP is an enzyme essential for B-band lipopolysaccharide production in serotype O6. Sequence analysis suggests that it is involved in the formation ofN-acetylgalacturonic acid. To test this hypothesis, overexpression and biochemical characterization of WbpP were performed. By using spectrophotometric assays and capillary electrophoresis, we show that WbpP is a UDP-GlcNAc C4 epimerase. The K mfor UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GalNAc are 197 and 224 μm, respectively. At equilibrium, 70% of UDP-GalNAc is converted to UDP-GlcNAc, whereas the yield of the reverse reaction is only 30%. The enzyme can also catalyze the inter-conversion of non-acetylated substrates, although the efficiency of catalysis is significantly lower. Only 15 and 40% of UDP-Glc and UDP-Gal, respectively, are converted at equilibrium. WbpP contains tightly bound NAD(H) and does not require additional cofactors for activity. It exists as a dimer in its native state. This paper is the first report of expression and characterization of a C4 UDP-GlcNAc epimerase at the biochemical level.

IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside column volumes Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic Gram-negative bacterium that can cause life-threatening infections in patients with cystic fibrosis or burn wounds (1.Hancock R.E. Mutharia L.M. Chan L. Darveau R.P. Speert D.P. Pier G.B. Infect. Immun. 1983; 42: 170-177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It produces a wide variety of virulence factors such as proteases, toxins, alginate, and lipopolysaccharides (LPS).1Two forms of LPS have been identified as follows: the antigenically conserved A-band LPS, and the variable O-antigen or B-band. B-band LPS is particularly important in the initial steps of the infection and particularly for evasion of host defenses and colonization (2.Cryz Jr., S.J. Pitt T.L. Furer E. Germanier R. Infect. Immun. 1984; 44: 508-513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Pier G.B. Thomas D.M. J. Infect. Dis. 1982; 148: 217-223Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It contributes to causing initial tissue damage and inflammatory responses in the lungs of patients with cystic fibrosis (2.Cryz Jr., S.J. Pitt T.L. Furer E. Germanier R. Infect. Immun. 1984; 44: 508-513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). P. aeruginosa mutants deficient in B-band LPS biosynthesis are more sensitive to serum killing (1.Hancock R.E. Mutharia L.M. Chan L. Darveau R.P. Speert D.P. Pier G.B. Infect. Immun. 1983; 42: 170-177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Schiller N.L. Hatch R.A. Diagn. Microbiol. Infect. Dis. 1983; 1: 145-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 5.Goldberg J.B. Pier G.B. Trends Microbiol. 1996; 4: 490-494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and are more susceptible to phagocytosis (6.Engles W. Endert J. Kamps M.A.F. VanBoven C.P.A. Infect. Immun. 1985; 49: 182-189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) than wild-type bacteria. They are found almost avirulent in mouse models (2.Cryz Jr., S.J. Pitt T.L. Furer E. Germanier R. Infect. Immun. 1984; 44: 508-513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). B-band LPS is the basis for classification of P. aeruginosa in 20 different serotypes. Among these, serotypes O6 and O11 are the most clinically relevant in epidemiological studies (7.Pitt T.L. Antibiot. Chemother. (Wash. D. C.). 1989; 42: 1-7Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To date, the prognosis for a cystic fibrosis patient infected with either serotype of P. aeruginosa is rather poor due to intrinsic multidrug resistance of P. aeruginosa. Such resistance is due partly to a highly impermeable outer membrane and partly to the presence of multidrug efflux pumps (8.Poole K. Krebes K. McNally C. Neshat S. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7363-7372Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar, 9.Poole K. Gotoh N. Tsujimoto H. Zhao Q. Wada A. Yamasaki T. Neshat S. Yamagishi J. Li X.Z. Nishino T. Mol.

Hence, B-band LPS biosynthesis has become an important target for drug discovery. The genetics of B-band LPS biosynthesis are well documented in serotypes O5, O6, and O11 (11.Burrows L.L. Charter D.F. Lam J.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 481-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 12.Bélanger M. Burrows L.L. Lam J.S.

Rev. 1999; 63: 523-553Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For each of these serotypes, the entire cluster of genes responsible for B-band LPS synthesis has been sequenced, and putative pathways for the synthesis of the corresponding O-antigens have been proposed based on homology studies. In serotype O11, the functional role of these genes awaits further studies. However, in serotypes O5 and O6, extensive functional characterization has been performed by knockout construction and complementation analysis, using not only genes from P. aeruginosa but also homologues found in other organisms. Despite these efforts, ambiguities persist that can only be alleviated by direct biochemical characterization of the proteins involved. Such a characterization will also allow screening for inhibitors that might be useful for therapeutic purposes, especially if performed for enzymes found in the clinically relevant serotype O6. The O-antigen of B-band LPS of serotype O6 consists of a tetrasaccharide repeat of →-α-d-3 O-acetyl, 6 amino-GalNAcA-(1→4)-α-d-6-amino-2-deoxy-2-formamido-d-galacturonic acid-(1→3)-α-d-2-acetamido-2,6-dideoxy-d-glucose-(1→2)-α-l-Rha-(1→ (15.Knirel Y.A. Vinogradov E.V. Shashkov A.S. Dmitriev B.A. Kochetkov N.K. Stanislavsky E.S. Mashilova G.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 150: 541-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 16.Knirel Y.A. Crit. Rev.

GalNAcA is thought to be synthesized in vivovia epimerization and dehydrogenation of UDP-GlcNAc, the main precursor of surface-associated carbohydrate synthesis (12.Bélanger M. Burrows L.L. Lam J.S. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 3505-3521Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 18.Kochetkov N.K. Shibaev V.N. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 1973; 28: 307-399Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 19.Virlogeux I. Waxin H. Ecobichon C. Popoff M.Y. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 3039-3047Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The product of the epimerization reaction, UDP-GalNAc, is an important intermediate for the synthesis of polysaccharide structures that contain GalNAcA or a derivative, not only in P. aeruginosa but also in other organisms. The gene wbpP is part of the B-band LPS cluster in P. aeruginosa O6 (12.Bélanger M. Burrows L.L. Lam J.S. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 3505-3521Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of WbpP shows 23% identity with the C4 UDP-Glc epimerase GalE fromEscherichia coli. It also shows 66% identity with WcdB, an enzyme thought to be involved in the formation of GalNAcA residues present in the Vi polysaccharide of Salmonella typhi (19.Virlogeux I. Waxin H. Ecobichon C. Popoff M.Y. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 3039-3047Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Disruption of the wbpP gene in a knockout mutant results in loss of B-band LPS production in P. aeruginosa, and this deficiency is fully alleviated after complementation by thewcdB homologue (12.Bélanger M. Burrows L.L. Lam J.S. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 3505-3521Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Although no biochemical evidence is available for either WbpP or WcdB, sequence comparisons with other proteins and carbohydrate composition analysis suggest that they are C4 epimerases that transform UDP-GlcNAc into UDP-GalNAc in vivo. A functional assignment relying mainly on homology studies is particularly problematic in the case of putative epimerases. Epimerases belong to the short chaindehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) enzyme family. This family includes enzymes responsible for a wide variety of functions (20.Jornvall H. Persson B. Krook M. Atrian S. Gonzalez-Duarte R. Jeffery J. Ghosh D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6003-6013Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar, 21.Jornvall H. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1999; 463: 359-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 22.Jornvall H. Hoog J.O. Persson B. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 261-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Most of these enzymes possess common features that include the presence of the GXXGXXG signature for nucleotide-binding proteins and the presence of alternating α and β structures that delineate a typical nucleotide-binding Rossman fold at their N terminus (23.Rossmann M.G. Argos P. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 7525-7532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Bauer A.J. Rayment I. Frey P.A. Holden H.M. Proteins. 1992; 12: 372-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Moreover, they share a conserved catalytic triad S(X)24–Y(X)3K probably involved in initiation of the catalytic process. All these features are present in WbpP, and they match perfectly with those found in the C4 UDP-Gal epimerase GalE found in E. coli (Fig.1) but also those of other enzymes with different functions such as RFFG, a dTDP-glucose-4,6-dehydratase present in E. coli (25.Marolda C.L. Valvano M.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5539-5546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, biochemical analysis is necessary to prove without ambiguity the function of WbpP. Also, although C4 UDP-Glc epimerases have been extensively studied previously, no epimerase has been described for theN-acetylated form of the substrate, but the existence of such activity has been suspected in a variety of organisms. The study of WbpP from P. aeruginosa serotype O6 described in this paper is the first report of the overexpression, purification, and detailed enzymatic analysis of a C4 UDP-GlcNAc epimerase. Unless stated otherwise all chemical reagents used were from Sigma. Restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were from Life Technologies, Inc. Pwo DNA polymerase was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The dNTPs were from Perkin-Elmer. The His6anti-histidine tag antibody was from Qiagen (Santa Clarita, CA). Agar was from Difco. All kits or enzymes were used following the manufacturer's instructions. WbpP was cloned in the NcoI and EcoRI sites of a pET23 derivative (26.Newton D.T. Mangroo D. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) with an N-terminal histidine tag. The sequence of the primers used to amplify wbpP by polymerase chain reaction from genomic DNA (strain IATS O6) were 5′CAATGCCATGGGAATGATGAGTCGTTATGAAG3′ and 5′TTAACGAATTCTCATTTCAAAAACATGATG3′ for the top and bottom primers, respectively. The polymerase chain reaction consisted of 100 ng of genomic DNA, 0.5 μm each primer, 0.2 mmeach dNTP, 4 mm MgCl2, and 1× buffer in a total of 50 μl. A 5-min denaturation at 94 °C was done before addition of DNA polymerase (1.5 units of Pwo). This was followed by 15 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 45 s at 55 °C, and 90 s at 72 °C. A final 7-min elongation was performed at 72 °C. The constructs obtained were checked by restriction analysis and sequencing. The construct was subsequently transformed into the expression strain BL21(DE3)pLysS (Novagen, Madison, WI) with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (35 μg/ml) selection. For protein expression, 2 ml of an overnight culture were inoculated into 100 ml of LB in the presence of ampicillin and chloramphenicol. The culture was grown at 30 °C. When the A 600 nm reached 0.6, IPTG (Promega, Madison, WI) was added to a final concentration of 0.15 mmand expression was allowed to proceed for 5–6 h at 30 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 × gfor 15 min at 4 °C and the pellet was stored at −20 °C until needed. Expression was monitored by SDS-PAGE analysis, with Coomassie blue staining or Western immunoblot using the penta-His anti-histidine tag antibody as instructed by the manufacturer. Cells sedimented from 100 ml of induced culture were resuspended in 10 ml of buffer A (5 mm imidazole, 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.1m NaCl). The cells were briefly sonicated (macrotip, sonicator XL2020 Heat Systems Inc., power set to 4, 2 min total, 5 s on, 5 s off) on ice. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was applied to a 3-ml fast flow chelating Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) previously loaded with nickel sulfate (30 ml of 0.1 m) and equilibrated with 5 column volumes (CV) of buffer A. Loading of the sample as well as all washing and elution steps were done by gravity. After loading of the sample, the column was washed with 10 CV of buffer A and 5 CV of buffer B (20 mmimidazole, 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.1 m NaCl). Elution was carried out with 3 CV of buffer C (1 mimidazole, 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.1 m NaCl). Fractions were collected every 1 CV. Most of the protein was eluted in fraction 2 as seen by SDS-PAGE analysis. This fraction was subjected to further purification by anion exchange chromatography after dilution 1/30 in 50 mm Tris, pH 8. Half of it was loaded onto a 1-ml column of Q-Sepharose fast flow (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was washed with 30 CV of Tris buffer, and the protein was eluted with 3 CV of 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.5 m NaCl. Fractions were collected every 1 CV, and most of the protein was recovered in fraction 2. This fraction was desalted by overnight dialysis (cut-off 3500 Da) in 50 mm Tris, pH 8, at 4 °C. The dialyzed samples were concentrated by overlay with PEG 8000 (Sigma) for 2–3 h at 4 °C. Protein quantitation was done using the BCA reagent (Pierce). The purified enzyme was either used fresh or stored at −20 °C in 25% glycerol or 20% adonitol in 50 mmTris, pH 8, without any significant loss of activity. A 45 × 1.6-cm column containing 90 ml of Sephadex G-100 (Sigma, fractionation range 4–150 kDa) was used to determine the oligomerization status of WbpP. The column was equilibrated in 50 mm Tris, pH 8, containing 100 mm NaCl and run at 1.4 ml/min. Molecular weight standards (Sigma, 12–150 kDa) were applied onto the column one by one (50–200 μg each in 200 μl). WbpP was applied onto the column either as a concentrated or a diluted solution (200 μg or 50 μg/200 μl deposited). Protein elution was monitored at 280 nm. A freshly purified and extensively dialyzed sample of WbpP at 1.75 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris, pH 8, was used for the extraction and quantification of bound NAD(H). WbpP (175 μg) was incubated in the presence of 10 μg of proteinase K for 45 min at 37 °C. Total digestion of WbpP was checked by SDS-PAGE analysis and Coomassie staining. After complete digestion, WbpP was submitted to chemical reduction by successive additions of 1 μl of 10 mg/ml sodium borohydride (Fisher) every 30 min for 2 h 30 min. The proteolysis step was included prior to reduction to ensure quantitative reduction and recovery of NAD(H). The absorption spectrum was recorded before and after chemical reduction between 230 and 450 nm using a DU520 spectrophotometer (Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA) equipped with a 50-μl microcell. Serial dilutions of NAD+ (Sigma) ranging from 5 to 40 μm were prepared in 50 mm Tris, pH 8, and were incubated at 37 °C for the same amount of time as WbpP with or without chemical reduction. The precise concentration in NAD+ was calculated using ε260 nm = 17400m−1 × cm−1 and the efficiency of reduction was calculated using ε340 nm = 6270m−1 × cm−1. Reactions were performed with a total reaction volume of 35 μl at 37 °C in 20 mm Tris, pH 8, unless stated otherwise. The specific amount of enzyme used, substrate concentrations, and incubation time are indicated in the legend of each figure. The reactions were stopped by acid hydrolysis of the UDP moiety of the substrate. For this purpose, the samples were acidified to pH 2 by addition of 7 μl of HCl 0.1 n, boiled for 6 min, and neutralized by addition of 7 μl of NaOH 0.1 n. For the spectrophotometric quantification of GalNAc and GlcNAc, the reagent DMAB was prepared at 10% in glacial acetic acid/HCl, 9/1, v/v, and further diluted 1/10 in glacial acetic acid before use (27.Reissig J.L. Strominger J.L. Leloir L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1955; 217: 959-966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the assay itself, 100 μl of 0.2 m sodium tetraborate, pH 9.1, were added to 50 μl of quenched and neutralized enzymatic reactions and boiled immediately for 3 min. 40 μl of this mixture were transferred to a microtitration plate, and 200 μl of DMAB reagent were added. After incubation for 30 min at 37 °C, the A 595 nm was recorded using a microplate reader. The assay was done in duplicate for each reaction tested. Standard curves were prepared using UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GalNAc that were subjected to acid hydrolysis in the same conditions as described above. Reactions were performed at 37 °C in 20 mm Tris, pH 8, with a total reaction volume of 44 μl. The amount of purified enzyme added was 234 and 117 ng for reaction with UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GalNAc, respectively. After incubation at 37 °C for the required amount of time, the reactions were quenched by boiling the sample for 6 min. Time course studies were performed with final sugar nucleotide concentrations of 0.075 and 1.75 mm. Samples were quenched after 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 15 min. For K m and V maxdeterminations, the final sugar nucleotide concentrations ranged from 0.075 to 1.75 mm, and the reactions were quenched after 3 min of incubation. Capillary electrophoresis (CE) analysis was performed using a P/ACE 5000 system (Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA) with UV detection. The running buffer was 25 mm sodium tetraborate, pH 9.4. The capillary was bare silica 75 μm × 57 cm, with a detector at 50 cm. The capillary was conditioned before each run by washing with 0.2m NaOH for 2 min, water for 2 min, and running buffer for 2 min. Samples were introduced by pressure injection for 4 s, and the separation was performed at 22 kV. Peak integration was done using the Beckman P/ACE Station software. The calculation of kinetic parameters was done using the PRISM program. To assess the requirements for NAD+ or divalent cations for the enzymatic activity of WbpP, reactions were carried out with or without NAD+ (1 mm final concentration) and with or without divalent cations (4 mm final concentration of MnCl2, MgCl2, or CaCl2) and monitored by capillary electrophoresis as described above. The enzymatic reactions were performed in 20 mm Tris, pH 8, with 39 μg of freshly purified enzyme and 0.8 mm sugar nucleotide in a total reaction volume of 44 μl. Time course studies were performed over 2 h at 37 °C. After incubation for the required amount of time, the reactions were quenched by acid hydrolysis of the UDP moiety as described above. Standard curves were prepared using UDP-Glc or UDP-Gal that were also subjected to acid hydrolysis. The quantitation of remaining glucose present in the reaction mixture was measured spectrophotometrically using a coupled assay adapted from Moreno et al. (28.Moreno F. Rodicio R. Herrero P. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1981; 27: 589-592Google Scholar). A reaction mix containing 22 units/ml glucose oxidase, 7 units/ml horseradish peroxidase, and 0.3 mg/ml of O-dianisidine was prepared in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5. Four hundred μl of this reaction mix were added to the neutralized samples described above, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was then quenched by addition of 600 μl of 6n HCl, and the absorbance at 540 nm was read. The enzymatic reactions were performed in 20 mm Tris, pH 8, with 16.4 μg of freshly purified enzyme in a total reaction volume of 44.8 μl. The total sugar nucleotide concentrations in the enzymatic reactions ranged from 0.048 to 2.009 mm. The reactions were quenched after 15 min of incubation at 37 °C. The samples were analyzed by CE in the same conditions as described above, and the K m andV max values were determined using the PRISM software. WbpP is a 37.7-kDa protein with a slightly acidic isoelectric point (pI = 5.99). It was expressed in the pET system as an N-terminally histidine-tagged protein. Provided that expression was carried out at low temperature (30 °C) and with a low concentration of inducer IPTG (0.15 mm), most of the protein was expressed in a soluble form (Fig. 2). It was expressed at a very high level since it represented 30–35% of total cellular proteins. It was readily purified to 90–95% by nickel chelation, and most of the contaminants were further eliminated by anion exchange chromatography to produce 95–98% pure protein. Therefore, the protein was purified only 3-fold to reach homogeneity. The yield obtained was 5–7 mg/100 ml of culture (Table I). The presence of the histidine tag was confirmed by Western immunoblot using an anti-histidine tag antibody (data not shown).Table IPurification table for WbpP established using the DMAB assay and either UDP-GlcNAc or UDP-GalNAc as a substrateFractionVol.ConcaConc. refers to the total protein concentration of the fraction tested for activity.ProteinYieldSubstrateTotal unitsbOne unit is defined as the amount of enzyme that allows conversion of 1 μmol of substrate in 1 min under our experimental conditions.

Open table in a new tab Results from gel filtration analysis suggest that WbpP exists as a dimer in its native form (data not shown). No apparent monomer or higher order oligomers were detected even in the presence of 100 mm salt or at low enzyme concentration. The spectrophotometric assay used to quantitate GlcNAc and GalNAc in enzymatic reactions relies on the use of DMAB which is specific for N-acetylhexosamines. Different colorimetric yields are obtained with differentN-acetylhexosamines (27.Reissig J.L. Strominger J.L. Leloir L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1955; 217: 959-966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the two substrates relevant to this study, a much higher reaction yield (6 times) is obtained with GlcNAc than with GalNAc (Fig.3 A). The assay is very sensitive and allows discrimination between both substrates at low substrate concentration (0.15 mm). Moreover, the yields of reaction are additive. Hence, the composition of a mixture of GlcNAc and GalNAc obtained after enzymatic conversion can be calculated from standard curves established with each substrate separately (Fig.3 B). The results obtained for WbpP using the DMAB assay are consistent with a UDP-GlcNAc C4 epimerase activity. When the enzymatic reaction was performed with UDP-GlcNAc, the total yield of the reaction with DMAB decreased (Fig. 3 C). This is consistent with the formation of GalNAc that reacts poorly with DMAB. Alternatively, when the enzymatic reaction was performed with UDP-GalNAc, the yield of the reaction with DMAB increased. This is consistent with the formation GlcNAc that reacts strongly with DMAB. The activity was dependent on the quantity of enzyme added (Fig. 3 C). Maximum substrate conversions obtained were approximately 30% for UDP-GlcNAc and 70% of UDP-GalNAc. Less enzyme was required to obtain maximum substrate conversion for UDP-GalNAc than for UDP-GlcNAc. The specific activity of purified WbpP was 5.6 and 2.3 units/mg with regard to UDP-GalNAc and UDP-GlcNAc, respectively (Table I). This represents only a 2-fold increase of the specific activity. This apparent low level of purification in terms of specific activity is due to the f"

A comparison of sequences shows that γ subunits of different species are approximately 75% homologous. If only mammalian sequences are compared, the homology increases to 93%.Several findings imply a stable association of γ with α and β subunits in tissues expressing all three subunits. The expression patterns of the catalytic α and γ subunits are identical in renal proximal tubules and collecting ducts (5.Mercer R.W. Biemesderfer D. Bliss Jr., D.P. Collins J.H. Forbush III, B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), and the γ subunit is expressed at the surface of Xenopus oocytes only in the presence of α and β subunits (10.Béguin P.

In addition, co-immunoprecipitation of the γ subunit with both the α and β subunits has been demonstrated in kidney membranes (5.Mercer R.W. Biemesderfer D. Bliss Jr., D.P. Collins J.H.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4250-4260Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). A number of functional effects have been described, which may reflect one or more interactions of the γ subunit with the α/β subunits of the Na,K-ATPase. Experiments with intact renal Na,K-ATPase and mammalian cell membranes containing the expressed γ subunit show that it increases the affinity for ATP either as a primary effect or, more likely, as a consequence of a shift in conformational equilibrium in favor of E1 form(s) (6.Therien A.G.

Chem. 1999; 274: 12252-12256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Consistent with these effects, the apparent affinity for K+ is decreased under conditions of suboptimal ATP concentration (16.Therien A.G. Pu X.U. Karlish S.J.D. Blostein R. Taniguchi K. Proceedings of the IXth International Conference on Na,K-ATPase and Related Cation Pumps. Elsevier, Amsterdam2000Google Scholar). There is a recent report that the γ subunit expressed in mammalian kidney cells decreases the apparent cytoplasmic sodium affinity (14.Arystarkhova E. Wetzel R.K. Asinovski N.K. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33183-33185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In addition, experiments on cRNA-injected Xenopus oocytes have shown that the γ subunit has an influence on the apparent affinity of the Na,K-ATPase for extracellular K+ in a complex Na+- and voltage-dependent fashion (10.Béguin P. Wang X. Firsov D. Puoti A. Claeys D. Horisberger J.D. Geering K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4250-4260Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar).

A post-translational modification might be suggested on the basis of the findings, while other possibilities include the presence of separate isoforms or splice variants. In view of the largely tissue-specific expression of the γ subunit in kidney and the new evidence for a regulatory role, it becomes important to establish the origin of the doublet of bands in renal membranes and their possible association with the diverse functional effects on renal Na,K-ATPase that have been described recently. This paper describes the results of experiments that define the structural difference between the two bands as the result of different primary sequences.MATERIALS AND METHODSNa,K-ATPase was purified from Milan hypertensive rat kidneys by the method of Jorgensen (17.Jørgensen P.L. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 156: 29-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The specific activity was in the range 16–30 μmol of Pi/mg/min.The rat renal enzyme was reduced and alkylated with iodoacetamide, and the two γ subunits were separated on a 10% Tricine SDS gel (18.Capasso J.M. Hoving S. Tal D.M. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1150-1158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The two bands were excised from the gel and destained using multiple washings with 50% acetonitrile in 50 mmammonium bicarbonate. The γ subunits were extracted from the gel pieces by overnight incubation in a mixture of 1:2:3 (v/v/v) formic acid, isopropyl alcohol, and water at room temperature (19.Cohen S. Chait B. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 247: 257-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar).Mass SpectrometryIntact Molecular Weight MeasurementsExtracted γ subunits were further purified prior to MS analysis. Briefly, the dried extract from one lane of the gel (2–3 μg of γ subunit) was redissolved in 1 μl of 80% formic acid and immediately diluted with water to yield a final concentration of 5% formic acid. This preparation was passed over a microcolumn consisting of about 300 nl of Poros R1 reversed phase material (Perseptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) packed in an Eppendorf Gel Loader pipette tip (20.Kussmann M. Nordhoff E. Rahbek Nielsen H. Haebel S. Rossel Larsen M. Jakobsen L. Gobom J. Mirgorodskaya E. Kroll Kristensen A. Palm L. Roepstorff P. J. Mass Spectrom. 1997; 32: 593-601Crossref Scopus (431) Google Scholar), and the purified protein was eluted directly into a nano-electrospray capillary (Protana A/S, Odense, Denmark) using 1 μl of 70% acetonitrile, 5% formic acid. Protein mass spectra were acquired using a nano-electrospray ion source (Protana A/S) (21.Wilm M. Shevchenko A. Houthaeve T. Breit S. Schweigger L. Fotsis T. Mann M. Nature. 1996; 379: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1505) Google Scholar) on an API 300 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (PE Sciex, Concord, Ontario, Canada).In Gel Digestion, Peptide Mass Mapping, and Peptide SequencingIn gel tryptic digestion of the two separated γ bands was performed as described (22.Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7768) Google Scholar). Briefly, protein was excised from the gel (usually one lane containing 2–3 μg of γ subunit), fully destained, reduced, carbamidomethylated, and digested overnight with bovine trypsin (sequencing grade, Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) at a concentration of 12.5 ng/μl in 50 mmammonium bicarbonate at 37 °C. Peptide mass mapping was performed on a Bruker Reflex III matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Bruker, Bremen, Germany) equipped with a 337 nm nitrogen laser. Matrix surfaces were made from α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid by the fast evaporation method (23.Vorm O. Roepstorff P. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1994; 66: 3281-3287Crossref Scopus (644) Google Scholar,24.Jensen O.N. Podtelejnikov A. Mann M. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1996; 10: 1371-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). About 1–2% (0.3–0.5 μl) of the supernatant of in gel trypsin digests were injected into an acidified drop previously deposited onto the matrix surface, and the sample was allowed to dry at ambient temperature before MS analysis. Prior to peptide sequencing by tandem mass spectrometry, the peptide mixture was extracted from the gel by two changes of 5% formic acid, followed by 100% acetonitrile. The combined extracts were dried in vacuo. The dried peptides were redissolved in 5% formic acid and purified using a microcolumn consisting of approximately 300 nl of Poros R2 reverse phase material (Perseptive Biosystems) (22.Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7768) Google Scholar). Peptides were eluted with 60% methonol/5% formic acid directly into a nano-electrospray capillary and sequencing was performed by nano-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry on a prototype quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (PE Sciex). For sequencing peptides from rat γb, the in gel tryptic digestion was also performed in the presence of 50%18O-labeled water (25.Shevchenko A. Chernusevich I. Ens W. Standing K.G. Thomson B. Wilm M.

The cDNA for γb was obtained by PCR usingCLONTECH Marathon-ready cDNA from rat kidney as template, with primers designed according to the N-terminal γb protein sequence obtained by mass spectrometry. The forward primer was GGGGGGGAAGCTTGCCGCCACCATGGACAGATGGTATCTTGGTGGCAGT containing aHindIII restriction site, and the reverse primer was GGGGAAGATCCGTCACAGCTCATCTTCATTGACCT containing a BamHI restriction site. The resulting cDNA was then cleaved by these two endonucleases and ligated into the pREP4 expression vector (CLONTECH). Positive clones were verified by nucleotide sequencing. pREP4, pREP-γa, and pREP4-γb were purified using the Concert™ high purity plasmid purification system (Life Technologies, Inc.). For transfection into HeLa cells, PCR was carried out as above, except the following primers containing restriction sites for BamHI (forward primers) and BstXI (reverse primer), respectively, were used. The forward primer for γa was GGGGGGGGATCCGCCGCCACCATGACAGAGCTGTCAGCTAAC, and for γb, GGGGGGGGATCCGCCGCCACCATGGACAGATGGTATCTTGGTGGCAGT. The reverse primer for both γa and γb was GGGGGGCCAGCACACTGGGTCACAGCTCATCTTCATTGACCTGCCTAT. The resulting DNAs were then cleaved, ligated into the pIRES expression vector (CLONTECH), and then verified and purified as described above.Transfection, Tissue Culture, and Membrane PreparationThe procedures for transfecting HEK cells were as described elsewhere (13.Therien A.G. Karlish S.J.D. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12252-12256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), except that the LipofectAMINE Plus™ reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used as directed by the manufacturer. HeLa cells (50% confluent) were similarly transfected, and single clones were selected after 3 weeks' growth in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% newborn calf serum and 400 μg/ml hygromycin B.Western Blot AnalysisWestern blot analysis on HEK or HeLa cell membranes was carried out as described previously (6.Therien A.G. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32628-32634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μg of cell membranes were analyzed on 10% SDS-PAGE, after which the proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) and probed with anti-α1 (6H antibodies from Dr. Michael Caplan) and anti-γ antiserum (γC33 polyclonal antiserum raised against the 10-residue C terminus of γa), both at 1:2000 dilution. Western blots of rat kidney Na,K-ATPase utilized either the γC33 polyclonal antiserum or specific anti-γa and anti-γbantisera (1:100 dilution). γa-specific or γb-specific antibodies were raised in rabbits utilizing synthetic peptides TELSANHC (γa) or MDRWYLC (γb), coupled to maleimide-activated keyhole limpet hemocyanin as immunogens (Biological Services, Weizmann Institute, Rehovoth, Israel).DISCUSSIONThe presence of the two bands of the γ subunit has long been an intriguing finding with no obvious explanation. In view of the recent evidence for a tissue (mainly kidney)-specific role of the γ subunit as a modulator of the Na,K-ATPase, it has become important to gain insight into the structural basis for the two γ bands. Furthermore, it now becomes necessary to establish whether one or other band is associated with particular functional effects already described (6.Therien A.G. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D.

Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3) show unequivocally that γaand γb of the intact rat kidney Na,K-ATPase differ in their N-terminal sequences, TELSANH compared with Ac-MDRWY(I/L), but are otherwise identical. No post-translational modifications on either chain have been detected by MS except for the N-terminal acetylation of γb. Different sequences might indicate the existence of separate isoforms, but, from an EST data base search, it has been inferred recently that there are two splice variants, with the same sequences as determined directly by MS (MDRWYL for γb) (27.Sweadner K.J. Rael E. Wetzel R.K. Arystarkhova E. Taniguchi K. Proceedings of the IXth International Conference on Na,K-ATPase and Related Cation Pumps. Elsevier, Amsterdam2000Google Scholar). Given the extensive similarity between the two forms, the present MS analysis is consistent with the notion that γa and γb are splice variants. Of course, the strength of MS, in addition to the direct determination of sequence, is that it demonstrates directly that both variants are expressed as protein in the intact renal membranes, as well as indicating the absence of post-translational modifications. A search of the EST data base indicates the presence of mRNAs in the tissues of interest but not necessarily that protein is expressed in those tissues or the level of expression. This paper represents the first demonstration of application of MS to analysis of this class of single trans-membrane segment ion transport regulators. Thus, the methods might be applicable for study of related members of this family of membrane protein.The MS sequencing results are confirmed by the immunoblot of the rat kidney enzyme using antibodies raised against the peptides TELSANHC or MDRWYLC (Fig. 4). In particular, γa-specific and γb-specific antibodies recognize either the upper or lower band, respectively, but no bands other than γa or γb, consistent with absence of post-translationally modified subunits. It was reported recently that, after overnight incubation of rat kidney Na,K-ATPase with 1 m hydroxylamine at pH 11 and 37 °C, the upper γ band disappeared, leading to a suggestion that it contains a hydroxyester link, possibly fatty acid acylation at Ser or Thr residues (14.Arystarkhova E. Wetzel R.K. Asinovski N.K. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33183-33185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In our hands, alkali treatment itself reduces the intensity of both bands, γa more than γb, and hydroxylamine further reduces both bands. 2H. X. Pu, R. Goldshleger, R. Blostein, and S. J. D. Karlish, unpublished results. Alkaline hydroxylamine cleaves proteins, preferentially at Asn-Gly bonds, but specificity is not absolute (28.Allen G. Burdon R.H. van Knippenberg P.H. Sequencing of Proteins and Peptides. Elsevier, Amsterdam1990: 82Google Scholar). Indeed, we have observed that the α subunits of rat or pig kidney Na,K-ATPase, which contain three Asn-Gly bonds, are cleaved by the alkaline hydroxylamine at many positions. Although rat γ subunits do not contain Asn-Gly bonds, nonspecific hydroxylaminolysis is a likely possibility. Thus, the inference of a post-translational modification of the γ subunit in kidney Na,K-ATPase, based on the hydroxylamine treatment alone, appears to be questionable.Taken together with direct sequence analysis of the two bands from kidney enzyme and the antibody binding, the expression studies clarify earlier uncertainties regarding doublets seen in kidney and in transfected cells. The expression experiment in Fig. 5 clearly demonstrates that the major γa and γbprotein products of transcription/translation in both HeLa and HEK cells have the same mobilities as the upper (γa) and lower bands (γb), respectively, of the kidney medulla. This is consistent with the results of the MS and antibody binding. The additional minor bands, γa′ in γa-transfected HEK and the upper γb′ band in γb-transfected HeLa, represent cell-specific modifications of γa and γb. In cells transfected with cDNA having a single initiator methionine, a doublet of chains cannot be due to a splice variant and must have another explanation, for example post-translational modification or alternate translation initiation sites. It was reported earlier thatin vitro translation of a single rat mRNA species, in the presence of dog pancreatic microsomes, gives rise to two γ subunit bands (6.Therien A.G. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32628-32634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Geering and co-workers (10.Béguin P. Wang X. Firsov D. Puoti A. Claeys D. Horisberger J.D. Geering K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4250-4260Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) have shown that, inXenopus, the presence of two bands of γ is secondary to alternate usage of two distinct start codons in the γ subunit message. As mentioned under “Results,” the nature of γa′ seen in HEK cells and γb′ seen in γb-transfected HeLa is obscure. Additionally, the relevance, if any, of γa′ and γb′ to the function of the γ subunit in kidney is unknown. In the case of γb′, its mobility corresponds to that of a very weak but distinct band just above γa in some, albeit not all Western blots of renal medulla.2The question arises as to the stoichiometry of γa and γb relative to the α/β subunits in renal Na,K-ATPase. In older studies, the overall stoichiometry of γ to α/β subunits in kidney enzyme was estimated to be approximately 1:1 (3.Forbush III, B. Kaplan J.H. Hoffman J.F. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 3667-3676Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 4.Reeves A.S. Collins J.H. Schwartz A Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 95: 1591-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In agreement with a 1:1:1 stoichiometry of α:β:γ subunits, we have repeatedly found stoichiometries of 1:1 for a fragment of the γ subunit (N terminus GDVDPFYY; see Ref. 30.Shainskaya A. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10780-10789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and other fragments of the α subunit isolated from extensively digested pig kidney Na,K-ATPase.2 By scanning Coomassie-stained gels, we have also estimated that the ratio γa: γb in rat or pig kidney Na,K-ATPase, as 0.8 ± 0.06 (n = 3) and 1.6 ± 0.06 (n = 5), respectively,i.e. not exactly 1:1.2 Thus, a likely combination of subunits is α:β:γa and α:β:γb, in proportion to the ratio of γa and γb. A combination such as α:β:γa:γb, together with α:β without associated γ, is less probable since it implies an exact 1:1 ratio of γa and γb.What is the functional significance of the two variants? One possibility is that the γa and γbdifferentially affect functions already ascribed to the γ subunit. For example, one effect of the γ subunit is to alter the steady-state E1 ↔ E2 equilibrium in favor of E1 with an associated decrease inK′ATP (6.Therien A.G. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32628-32634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 13.Therien A.G. Karlish S.J.D. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12252-12256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). γa and γb could affect this function in different ways or to a different degree. Second, there may be effects of the γ subunit on cytoplasmic K′K/K′Naantagonism. Sweadner and co-workers (14.Arystarkhova E. Wetzel R.K. Asinovski N.K. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33183-33185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) have recently ascribed a 2-fold lower apparent affinity for Na+ of rat kidney Na,K-ATPase compared with that in rat NRK tissue-culture cells to the presence of γ in the kidney. These authors transfected NRK cells with γa cDNA and isolated clones expressing either two bands, presumed to be either unmodified (lower) or post-translationally modified (upper), or only a single γa band, presumably post-translationally modified (upper). They observed a lowerK′Na in NRK clones expressing both bands but not in clones expressing a single γa subunit. However, in view of the rather low level of γa expression in those experiments, and the present finding that γa in intact kidney tissue is unmodified, the relevance of those results to the role of γ in kidney is unclear. Nevertheless, striking tissue-specific difference in apparent affinity of the α1 pump for Na+have been described and ascribed to differences in cytoplasmicK′K/K′Na antagonism (31.Therien A.G. Nestor N.B. Ball W.J. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7104-7112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar,32.Therien A.G. Blostein R. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C891-C898Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The difference is particularly notable for the α1 enzyme of kidney compared with most other tissues tested, and significant in view of the predominant expression of γ in the intact kidney membranes (6.Therien A.G. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32628-32634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Another possibility is that there are variant-specific functions related to their distinct extracellularly located N termini. For example, in Xenopus oocytes expression of the γ subunit affects activation by extracellular potassium ions (10.Béguin P. Wang X. Firsov D. Puoti A. Claeys D. Horisbe"

De Fillipis V. Zanotti G. Visco C. Orsini G. Fontana A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). For example, bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A (RNase A)1 (EC 3.1.27.5 (5.Raines R.T. Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 1045-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar, 6.Raines R.T. Frey P.A. Northrop D.B.

Chem. 1989; 264: 21591-21596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Apparently, some proteins are better able to thwart the proteolytic machinery (13.Rechsteiner M. Rogers S. Rote K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 390-394Google Scholar, 14.Rogers S.W. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19850-19862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These proteins remain intact and retain activity longer within the cell. A correlation between the conformational stability of a protein and its catabolism was reported over 20 years ago (15.McLendon G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 77: 959-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Since then, studies using unrelated proteins have either supported (16.McLendon G. Radany E. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 6335-6337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or contradicted (14.Rogers S.W. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1989; 264: 9772-9779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) this correlation. Drawing conclusions from these studies is problematic because the proteins were divergent in characteristics that have been implicated in metabolic turnover. In contrast, variants of a single protein, the N-terminal domain of the repressor protein from bacteriophage λ, have been used to demonstrate a definite link between conformational stability and metabolic turnover (18.Parsell D.A. Sauer R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7590-7595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, the conformational stability of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor variants was shown to correlate with the yield of intact protein produced in a heterologous system (19.Kowalski J.M. Parekh R.N. Wittrup K.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1264-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). RNase A homologs elicit diverse biological activities, including specific toxicity to cancer cells (20.Youle R.J. D'Alessio G. D'Alessio G. Riordan J.F. Ribonucleases: Structures and Functions. Academic Press, New York1997: 491-514Crossref Google Scholar, 21.Rybak S.M. Newton D.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 325-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Onconase™, which is a homolog of RNase A in the Northern leopard frog, is now in Phase III clinical trials for the treatment of malignant mesothelioma. It has been shown that the ribonucleolytic activity of ribonucleases is essential to their cytotoxicity (49.Kim J.-S. Soucek J. Matousek J. Raines R.T. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, ribonucleolytic activity is not the only requirement for a ribonuclease to be a cytotoxin. For example, relative to Onconase, RNase A is a 500-fold more effective catalyst of RNA cleavage (51.Wu Y. Mikulski S.M. Ardelt W. Rybak S.M. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10686-10693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), yet RNase A is not toxic to cancer cells. Still, the high ribonucleolytic activity of RNase A can engender a potent cytotoxin. Indeed, substitutions at Gly88 enable RNase A to mimic the ability of Onconase to evade the endogenous ribonuclease inhibitor (RI) protein and become cytotoxic (22.Leland P.A. Schultz L.W. Kim B.-M. Raines R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10407-10412Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Still, no RNase A homolog is as cytotoxic as Onconase. Onconase and RNase A differ substantially in another property—conformational stability. The value of T m(which is the temperature at the midpoint of the thermal transition) for Onconase (T m = 90 °C) is much greater than that of RNase A (T m = 63 °C) (22.Leland P.A. Schultz L.W. Kim B.-M. Raines R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10407-10412Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Is conformational stability a determinant of ribonuclease cytotoxicity? Answering this question requires a means to increase or decrease conformational stability without altering other important properties of the enzyme. We suspected that adding or removing disulfide bonds would provide such a subtle means. RNase A contains four disulfide bonds (Cys26–Cys84, Cys40–Cys95, Cys58–Cys110, and Cys65–Cys72; Fig.1). Previously, we dissected the contribution of each disulfide bond to conformational stability by replacing each cystine with a pair of alanine residues (23.Klink T.A. Woycechowsky K.J. Taylor K.M. Raines R.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 566-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Of the four disulfide bonds, the Cys40–Cys95 and Cys65–Cys72 cross-links are the least important to conformational stability (23.Klink T.A. Woycechowsky K.J. Taylor K.M. Raines R.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 566-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 24.Laity J.H. Shimotakahara S. Scheraga H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 615-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Removing these disulfide bonds leads to RNase A variants that haveT m values below that of the wild-type enzyme but above physiological temperature. Here, we investigate the relationship between the conformational stability and cytotoxicity of RNase A. Specifically, we construct G88R RNase A variants that are missing the Cys40–Cys95 or Cys65–Cys72 disulfide bonds. We also introduce a new disulfide bond into G88R RNase A and a variant missing the Cys65–Cys72 disulfide bond. We find that theT m values for G88R RNase A and its four disulfide variants vary by nearly 30 °C. We show that conformational stability is linked to protease susceptibility in vitro. Finally, we demonstrate that each variant is toxic to cancer cells and, most significantly, that cytotoxicity is correlated with conformational stability.

Anders L.A. Sjölin L. Gilliland G.L. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2705-2717Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar)) were used to determine the placement of the new disulfide bond. According to our molecular modeling, replacing Ala4 and Val118 with two half-cystine residues would cross-link the N and C termini without perturbing the three-dimensional structure of RNase A (Fig. 1). Replacing Arg4 and Val118 in the human homolog of RNase A with two half-cystine residues has been reported to make that enzyme more resistant to proteolysis by trypsin. 2J. Futami, M. Seno, and H. Yamada, personal communication. Oligonucleotide-mediated site-directed mutagenesis was used to create the RNase A variants. Plasmids encoding the G88R (22.Leland P.A. Schultz L.W. Kim B.-M. Raines R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10407-10412Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), C40A/C95A, and C65A/C72A (23.Klink T.A. Woycechowsky K.J. Taylor K.M. Raines R.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 566-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) variants were derived from plasmid pBXR, which directs the expression of RNase A in E. coli (29.delCardayré S.B. Ribó M. Yokel E.M. Quirk D.J. Rutter W.J. Raines R.T. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 261-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis was performed on plasmids encoding the G88R, C40A/C95A, and C65A/C72A variants replicated in E. coli strain CJ236 (30.Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar). To produce plasmids encoding the C40A/G88R/C95A and C65A/C72A/G88R variants, the GGC codon for Gly88 was replaced in DNA encoding the C40A/C95A and C65A/C72A variants using the oligodeoxyribonucleotide TTGGAGCTACGCGTCTCACG (reverse complement in boldface). To produce plasmids encoding the A4C/G88R/V118C and A4C/C65A/C72A/G88R/V118C variants, the GCA codon for Ala4 was replaced in DNA encoding the G88R and C65A/C72A/G88R variants using the oligodeoxyribonucleotide CTTGGCTGCACAAGTTTCCTTGC (reverse complement in boldface), and the GTC codon for Val118 was replaced using the oligodeoxyribonucleotide GCATCAAAGTGACATGGCACATACGGGTTTCC (reverse complement in boldface). Wild-type RNase A and its variants were produced and purified by methods described previously (29.delCardayré S.B. Ribó M. Yokel E.M. Quirk D.J. Rutter W.J. Raines R.T. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 261-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 31.Kim J.-S. Raines R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17392-17396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except for minor modifications in the conditions for oxidative folding (22.Leland P.A. Schultz L.W. Kim B.-M. Raines R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10407-10412Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 23.Klink T.A. Woycechowsky K.J. Taylor K.M. Raines R.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 566-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The purity of each protein was assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Adding or removing a disulfide bond is expected to alter the extinction coefficient of RNase A by <1% (32.Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5072) Google Scholar, 33.Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3470) Google Scholar). Hence, the concentrations of wild-type RNase A and the disulfide variants were determined by using ε = 0.72 ml mg−1 cm−1 at 277.5 nm (34.Sela M. Anfinsen C.B. Harrington W.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1957; 26: 502-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Differential scanning calorimetry was used to determine the conformational stability of each RNase A variant. Differential scanning calorimetry experiments were performed as described (23.Klink T.A. Woycechowsky K.J. Taylor K.M. Raines R.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 566-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), with the following modifications. Protein solutions (0.99–5.6 mg/ml) were dialyzed exhaustively against phosphate-buffered saline and then centrifuged at 15,300 ×g for 30 min to remove particulate matter. Data were collected with the program ORIGIN (MicroCal Software, Northampton, MA). The unfolding of wild-type RNase A and each of the variants was >90% reversible, as demonstrated by reheating of the protein samples (data not shown). The cytotoxicity of the RNase A variants was assessed using the continuous human erythroleukemia cell line K-562 as described (22.Leland P.A. Schultz L.W. Kim B.-M. Raines R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10407-10412Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Briefly, K-562 cells were grown at 37 °C in RPMI medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum (10% v/v) with penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) in the presence of wild-type RNase A, a variant, or a phosphate-buffered saline control for 44 h, followed by a 4-h pulse with [methyl-3H]thymidine (0.20 μCi per well). Each experiment is the average of triplicate determinations for each ribonuclease concentration. The standard error of the values from each protein concentration is ≤20%. The IC50 value is the concentration of an RNase A variant that kills 50% of the K-562 cells. A fluorogenic substrate, 6-FAM∼(dA)rU(dA)2∼6-TAMRA, was used to determine the values of k cat/K m for the RNase A variants (25.Kelemen B.R. Klink T.A. Behlke M.A. Eubanks S.R. Leland P.A. Raines R.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3696-3701Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). A large increase in fluorescence occurs upon cleavage of the P-O5′ bond on the 3′ side of the single ribonucleotide residue embedded within this substrate (25.Kelemen B.R. Klink T.A. Behlke M.A. Eubanks S.R. Leland P.A. Raines R.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3696-3701Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Assays were performed with stirring in 2.0 ml of 0.10 m MES-NaOH buffer (pH 6.0) containing NaCl (0.10 m), 6-FAM∼(dA)rU(dA)2∼6-TAMRA (60 nm), and enzyme (5 pm to 0.50 nm). Fluorescence was monitored at 515 nm with excitation at 495 nm. Values ofk cat/K m were determined using the following equation, I=I0+(If−I0)(kcat/Km)[E] tEquation 1 where I is the fluorescence intensity in photon counts per second, I 0 is the intensity of the substrate prior to addition of enzyme, I f is the final intensity when all the substrate is cleaved, and [E]tis the total enzyme concentration. Values ofk cat/K m were determined by linear least squares regression analysis of initial velocity data, assuming that assays were performed at substrate concentrations below the K m, which is near 22 μm (25.Kelemen B.R. Klink T.A. Behlke M.A. Eubanks S.R. Leland P.A. Raines R.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3696-3701Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). RI is a competitive inhibitor of RNase A that binds with a 1:1 stoichiometry (35.Blackburn P. Wilson G. Moore S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 5904-5910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Lee F.S. Shapiro R. Vallee B.L. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 37.Hofsteenge J. D'Alessio G. Riordan J.F. Ribonucleases: Structures and Functions. Academic Press, New York1997: 621-658Crossref Google Scholar). We had shown previously that as RI affinity decreases, RNase A cytotoxicity increases (22.Leland P.A. Schultz L.W. Kim B.-M. Raines R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10407-10412Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Commercial RI is stored in aqueous glycerol (50% v/v). To eliminate errors caused by pipetting viscous solutions, a buffer exchange to remove glycerol was performed, and the RI activity in the resulting low-viscosity solutions was determined as described (38.Bretscher L.E. Abel R.L. Raines R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9893-9896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To determine values of K i, we monitored the cleavage of 6-FAM∼(dA)rU(dA)2∼6-TAMRA by the RNase A variants as a function of RI concentration. Assays were performed with stirring in 2.00 ml of 0.10 m MES-NaOH buffer (pH 6.0) containing NaCl (0.10 m), dithiothreitol (8.0 mm), 6-FAM∼(dA)rU(dA)2∼6-TAMRA (60 nm), and enzyme (5 pm to 0.50 nm). Fluorescence was monitored at 515 nm, with excitation at 495 nm. The value ofk cat/K m was determined using Equation 1. After 5 min, an aliquot (0.5 μl) of RI (11.5 nm) was added, and the rate of substrate turnover was determined again. Additional aliquots of RI were added at 5-min intervals until the fluorescence change decreased to less than 10% of its original value. Values of K i were determined by nonlinear least-squares regression analysis of data fitted to the following equation (25.Kelemen B.R. Klink T.A. Behlke M.A. Eubanks S.R. Leland P.A. Raines R.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3696-3701Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), ΔI/Δt=(ΔI/Δ/t) 0(Ki/(Ki+[I]))Equation 2 where (ΔI/Δt)0 is the turnover rate prior to addition of RI. Proteinase K is a nonspecific protease that catalyzes the hydrolysis of accessible peptide bonds in proteins. A discontinuous assay was employed to determine the susceptibility of each RNase A variant to proteinase K. An RNase A variant (6.1 μm) was incubated in triplicate at 25 °C with proteinase K (5 μg/ml) in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing CaCl2 (1.0 mm). Controls were incubated in buffer without proteinase K. At known times, aliquots were removed and diluted with 0.10 m MES-NaOH buffer (pH 6.0) containing NaCl (0.10 m). The turnover of 6-FAM∼(dA)rU(dA)2∼6-TAMRA (60 nm) was monitored in 2.00 ml of 0.10 m MES-NaOH buffer (pH 6.0) containing NaCl (0.10 m) and enzyme (5–600 pm). Fluorescence was monitored at 515 nm with excitation at 495 nm. Values of k cat/K mwere determined using Equation 1. A plot of relative ribonucleolytic activity as a function of time was fitted to a first-order rate equation to determine the pseudo first-order rate constant (k) for inactivation by proteinase K digestion. Values oft 12proteinase K were determined from the rate constant using the equationt 12proteinase K = ln2/k. The reversible thermal transitions of wild-type RNase A and the G88R, A4C/G88R/V118C, C40A/G88R/C95A, C65A/C72A/G88R, and A4C/C65A/C72A/G88R/V118C variants were fitted to equations describing a two-state model for unfolding: N ⇄ U, where N is the native state and U is the unfolded state. Removing a native disulfide bond in RNase A decreases the stability significantly (24.Laity J.H. Shimotakahara S. Scheraga H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 615-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar,23.Klink T.A. Woycechowsky K.J. Taylor K.M. Raines R.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 566-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The C65A/C72A/G88R and C40A/G88R/C95A variants are approximately 90 and 60% folded at 37 °C, respectively (data not shown). Compared with G88R RNase A, the T m values for the C65A/C72A/G88R and C40A/G88R/C95A variants are decreased by 18.1 and 23.6 °C, respectively. In contrast to these variants, wild-type RNase A and the G88R, A4C/G88R/V118C, and A4C/C65A/C72A/G88R/V118C variants are >99% folded at 37 °C. The T mvalues of wild-type RNase A and G88R RNase A are 63.2 and 64.0 °C, respectively (Table I). Most interestingly, the new Cys4–Cys118 disulfide bond in A4C/G88R/V118C RNase A increases the T m by 4.8 °C relative to that of G88R RNase A. A similar increase inT m occurs in the A4C/C65A/C72A/G88R/V118C variant relative to that of C65A/C72A/G88R RNase A.Table IConformational stability, cytotoxicity, ribonucleolytic activity, inhibition by ribonuclease inhibitor, and protease susceptibility of wild-type ribonuclease A and disulfide variantsRibonuclease AT maValues (± S.E.) from differential scanning calorimetry are for triplicate experiments performed in protein-buffered saline.

Open table in a new tab The cytotoxicity of wild-type RNase A and the G88R, A4C/G88R/V118C, C40A/G88R/C95A, C65A/C72A/G88R, and A4C/C65A/C72A/G88R/V118C variants was assessed by measuring the incorporation of [methyl-3H]thymidine into cellular DNA after a 44-h incubation with K-562 cells. Wild-type RNase A is not cytotoxic to K-562 cells at the concentrations used in this assay (Table I). The IC50 value of 9 μm for G88R RNase A agrees closely with those reported previously (22.Leland P.A. Schultz L.W. Kim B.-M. Raines R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Most significantly, adding the disulfide bond between residues 4 and 118 decreases the IC50 value for A4C/G88R/V118C RNase A by 3-fold (IC50 = 3 μm). Although still cytotoxic, each of the remaining variants is less cytotoxic than is G88R RNase A. The IC50 values for the C40A/G88R/C95A, C65A/C72A/G88R, and A4C/C65A/C72A/G88R/V118C variants are 25, 26, and 17 μm, respectively. A highly sensitive fluorometric assay was used to assess ribonucleolytic activity. The values of k cat/K m for wild-type RNase A and variants are the average of three independent assays. Each variant is a potent catalyst of RNA cleavage. At 25 °C, the values ofk cat/K m for the variants are 2.4–90-fold lower than that of the wild-type enzyme (TableI). Inhibition of the ribonuclease-catalyzed cleavage of 6-FAM∼(dA)rU(dA)2∼6-TAMRA by RI was assessed in a continuous assay. The effect of RI concentration on the ribonucleolytic act"
https://openalex.org/W2053332406,"Among the phospholipase C that catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, four mammalian phospholipase C-β (PLC-β) isotypes (isotypes 1–4) are activated through G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Although the regulation of the PLC-βs by GPCRs and heterotrimeric G proteins has been extensively studied, little is known about the molecular determinants that regulate their activity. The PLC-β isozymes carry a putative PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1 (PDZ) binding motif (X(S/T)X(V/L)COOH) at their carboxyl terminus, which is implicated in specific interactions with anchor proteins. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we identified Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor 2 (NHERF2) as a protein that interacted with a C-terminal heptapeptide of PLC-β3. Immunoprecipitation studies revealed that NHERF2 interacts specifically with PLC-β3, but not with other PLC-β isotypes. Furthermore, PLC-β3 interacted with NHERF2 rather than with other PDZ-containing proteins. This interaction required the COOH-terminal NTQL sequence of PLC-β3 and the second PDZ domain of NHERF2. Interestingly, NHERF2 potentiated the PLC-β activation by carbachol in COS7 and HeLa cells, while mutant NHERF2, lacking the second PDZ domain, had no such effect. Taken together, the data suggest that NHERF2 may act as a modulator underlying the process of PLC-β3-mediated signaling.

Smrcka A.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 502-506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Activated PLC-β catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and thereby generates two second messengers, diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (2.Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4231) Google Scholar). Among the heterotrimeric G proteins, the Gαq family activates PLC-β upon stimulation with ligands (3.Berstein G. Blank J.L. Smrcka A.V. Higashijima T. Sternweis P.C. Exton J.H. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8081-8088Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, the βγ subunit, which dissociates from the Gαi/o family, activates PLC-β in a pertussis toxin-sensitive manner (4.Gerard C. Gerard N.P. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1994; 6: 140-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Currently, four isotypes of PLC-β have been identified in mammals. Each isotype exhibits a different sensitivity to the Gαq family and βγ subunit. It has been reported that the GTPγS-activated Gαq or Gα11 subunits stimulated PLC-β isotypes with the ranking order of potency: PLC-β1 ≥ PLC-β3 > PLC-β2. PLC-β4 was also activated by the Gαq subunit (5.Lee C.W. Lee K.H. Lee S.B. Park D. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25335-25338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Gβγ subunit activated PLC-βin vitro according to the following hierarchy: PLC-β3 > PLC-β2 > PLC-β1 (6.Smrcka A.V. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9667-9674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Jhon D.Y. Lee H.H. Park D. Lee C.W. Lee K.H. Yoo O.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6654-6661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, several in vivo studies have shown that the receptors of chemoattractants including interleukin-8, C5a, and formyl-Met-Leu-Phe can specifically activate PLC-β2 via the Gβγ subunits from Gαi/o in a pertussis toxin-sensitive manner (8.Katz A. Wu D. Simon M.I. Nature. 1992; 360: 686-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 9.Jiang H. Wu D. Simon M.I. J. Biol.

Gαq and Gβγ subunits may thus independently modulate each PLC-β isotype in cooperation with other intracellular factors. The distribution of the PLC-β isotypes has been investigated in several tissues and cells. In the brain, PLC-β1 is highly expressed in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, and PLC-β4 is highly expressed in cerebellum. PLC-β3 is expressed throughout the brain (11.Ross C.A. MacCumber M.W.

Richardson R.M. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11706-11709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). While PLC-β3 is expressed in most cells, PLC-β2 is dominant in hematopoietic cells (14.Ali H. Fisher I. Haribabu B. Richardson R.M. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11706-11709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 15.Liu M. Simon M.I. Nature. 1996; 382: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). All isotypes except PLC-β2 are detected in PC12 cells. 2J.-I. Hwang, K. Heo, K.-J. Shin, E. Kim, C.-H. C. Yun, S. H. Ryu, H.-S. Shin, and P.-G. Suh, unpublished data. These findings suggest the possibility that each PLC-β isotype plays a distinct role in various GPCR signaling events. PLC-β isotypes have a long C-terminal regions (∼400 residues) that have relatively low homology among them (7.Jhon D.Y. Lee H.H. Park D. Lee C.W. Lee K.H. Yoo O.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6654-6661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In studies using mutants with deletions in the C-terminal region of PLC-β1, it was determined that the segment (residues 903–1142) was required for binding and stimulation by Gαq (17.Kim C.G. Sue D.P. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21187-21192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Moreover, there are short consensus sequences known as postsynaptic density-95/discs large/ZO-1 (PDZ)-binding motifs that consist of the amino acids -X(S/T)X(V/L)-COOH at the immediate C terminus of the PLC-β3 isotype (18.Kornau H.C. Schenker L.T. Kennedy M.B. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1995; 269: 1737-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (1630) Google Scholar). PDZ domains exist in a large number of multifunctional proteins that mediate protein-protein interactions at the postsynaptic density in neurons and junctional complexes in epithelia (19.Sheng M.

PSD-95/SAP90, which contains three PDZ domains, seems to assemble a receptor and channel complex by interacting with a type of glutamate receptor (N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor), and a shaker type K+ channel and neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (21.Brenman J.E.

GRIP has seven PDZ domains and interacts with the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate receptor, another type of glutamate receptor potential through the fourth and fifth PDZ domains (23.Dong H.

The phototransduction pathway in the compound eye ofDrosophila is spatially organized by inactivation no afterpotential D, a five-PDZ-containing protein. By interacting with PLC-β, eye-specific protein kinase C and light-activated Ca2+ channel transient receptor potential through its PDZ domains, INAD enables the visual signaling cascade through rhodopsin to be efficiently regulated (24.Tsunoda S.

These reports suggest that the PDZ-containing proteins may involve in various G protein-coupled receptor-mediated signaling pathways. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that this motif may provide the PLC-β isotypes with specificity in the signal transduction pathway by allowing them to interact with various PDZ-containing proteins. In this study, we identify some of the proteins interacting with PLC-β3 using the yeast two-hybrid system. Here, we show that NHERF2 (Na+/H+ exchanger-regulating factor 2) interacts with the C terminus of PLC-β3 via the second PDZ domain. This interaction is isotype-specific in that the PLC-β3 binds specifically to NHERF2 rather than other PLC isotypes. Furthermore, NHERF2 enhances the activation of PLC-β induced by carbachol treatment. These results suggest that NHERF2 may play a pivotal role in the organization and modulation of the PLC-β3-mediated signaling. Two-hybrid screening was performed using the L40 yeast strain harboring His3 and β-galactosidase as reporter genes as described previously (26.Bartel P.L. Chien C.-T. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Cellular Interactions in Development: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 153-179Google Scholar, 27.Kim E. Niethammer M. Rothschild A. Jan Y.N. Sheng M. Nature. 1995; 378: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). DNA oligomers encoding the C-terminal heptapeptides of PLC-β isotypes were inserted into pBHA (LexA fusion vector) and used as bait to screen a human fetal liver cDNA library inserted into the activation domain of GAL4 in pGAD10 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). We screened ∼1 × 106 primary transformants for interacting proteins. Clones specifically interacting with the bait were identified by His growth and X-gal activity assay. The DNAs of positive clones were sequenced, and the sequences were compared with sequences in the data bank using the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) BLAST. In order to express NHERF2 in Escherichia coli, the cDNA of human NHERF2 was inserted into the glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein vector, pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Various constructs of NHERF2 in pET30a were provided by Dr. C. H. Yun from Johns Hopkins University (28.Yun C.H.C. Lamprecht G. Forster D.V. Sider A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25856-25863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), and HA-tagged NHERF1 was kindly provided by Dr. Robert Lefkowitz from Duke University (29.Hall R.A.

Nature. 1998; 392: 626-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). GST or His6 fusion proteins were expressed in E. coliBL21 by induction with 0.5 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h at 27 °C. Bacterial lysates were prepared by sonication in ice-cold PBS in the presence of protease inhibitors. Proteins were purified from the soluble fraction on glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for GST fusion proteins or Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Invitrogen) for His6 fusion proteins. Full-length NHERF2-(1–337) and ERM binding domain-deleted NHERF2-(1–311) were constructed from the pET30a-NHERF2 by polymerase chain reaction amplification using appropriate primers and ligated into pCDNA3.1-HisC. To express the second PDZ-deleted form, NHERF2-(1–151/231–337), the N-terminal region was generated by polymerase chain reaction using primers 5′-CGGAATTCATGGCCGCGCCGGAGCCG-3′ and 5′-CCGCTCGAGCCGAGGGCGCAGCTC-3′ and digested with EcoRI and XhoI. The C-terminal region was generated by polymerase chain reaction with primers (5′-ACGCGTCGACACAGATGAACACTTCAAG-3′ and 5′-CGTCTAGATCAGAAGTTGCTGAAGATTTC-3′) and digested with SalI and XbaI. The fragments were then ligated at theirSalI and XhoI sites, respectively, and the resulting construct was inserted into pCDNA3.1-HisC. PLC-β isotypes and their FLAG-tagged forms in pCDNA3.1 and pCMV2 were constructed from the cDNA of each of the previously isolated PLC-β isotype. Each of the individual residues of the PDZ-binding motif (NTQL) of PLC-β3 were mutated to Ala codons and confirmed by DNA sequencing. For production of NHERF2 antibodies, His6 fusion protein of the entire NHERF2 was purified and used for immunization of mice. After four immunizations, splenocytes were fused with myeloma cells at a ratio of 10:1 using polyethylene glycol 1500. The hybrids were plated in 96-well plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and selected with hypoxanthine/aminopterin/thymidine. Supernatants of the hybrids were used to screen the pools releasing the antibody for NHERF2. Positive hybridomas were cloned twice by limit dilution. Large quantities of specific monoclonal antibodies were produced by preparation of ascites fluid in Balb/c mice. Purified antibodies were used for immunological studies. Antibodies of PLC-β isotypes were made using the C-terminal polypeptides expressed in E. colifollowing the above procedure. Anti-HA monoclonal antibody and anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals and Sigma. Anti-His6 polyclonal antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). COS7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 50 IU/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum in a 5% CO2, 95% air incubator at 37 °C. The cells were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μm pepstatin, and 1% Triton X-100). The lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was incubated with 10 μg of whole NHERF2 or GST fusion fragments thereof immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B or Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin. The beads were washed four times with lysis buffer, followed by boiling in SDS sample buffer. The precipitates were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and were immunoanalyzed. COS7 cells were transfected using Fugene 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at a ratio of 1.0 μg of total plasmid DNA and 3 μl of Fugene in 100 μl of medium. After 36 h, the transfected cells were harvested, lysed in lysis buffer, and used for immunoprecipitation with appropriate antibodies as indicated in each figure. Immunocomplexes were collected by binding to protein A-Sepharose and washed four times with lysis buffer prior to electrophoresis. The proteins were eluted with SDS-sample buffer, analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and immunoblotted. COS7 cells were seeded at 2 × 105 cells/well in a six-well plate and transfected with 0.1 μg of muscarinic receptor type 1 plasmid and 0.9 μg of wild type or deletion mutant plasmid of NHERF2 using Fugene 6. After 24 h, the transfected cells were incubated with 2 μCi/well [3H]inositol (NEN Life Science Products) in 2 ml of culture medium for 12 h at 37 °C. After incubation with 10 mm LiCl for 10 min, the cells were treated with 10 μm carbachol for 30 min and lysed by the addition of ice-cold 5% perchloric acid. Accumulated [3H]inositol phosphates were determined as described previously (30.Lee Y.H. Kim H.S. Pai J.-K. Ryu S.H. Suh P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26842-26847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the extracts were centrifuged, diluted 1:5 with distilled water, and applied to AG1-X8 anion exchange resin (Bio-Rad). The column was washed extensively with 4 ml of distilled water and with 10 ml of 0.06m ammonium formate containing 5 mm sodium tetraborate. Inositol phosphates were eluted with 2 ml of 1m ammonium formate and 0.1 m formic acid. The radioactivity in eluate was measured using a β-scintillation counter (Packard). To characterize the effects of NHERF2 in the whole cell, we established HeLa cell lines expressing deletion mutants of NHERF2 on a background of endogenous NHERF2, PLC-β3, and muscarinic receptor expression. Briefly, each construct in pCDNA3.1, a plasmid that confers resistance to G418, were transfected into HeLa cells using Fugene 6. After cells were selected in the presence of 800 μg/ml G418, the expression level of each mutant was checked with anti-NHERF2 antibody. HeLa cells expressing deletion mutants of NHERF2 were fractionated as described previously (31.Yao I. Hata Y. Ide N. Hirao K. Deguch M. Nishioka H. Mizoguchi A. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11889-11896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Cells grown to 70–80% confluency in a 100-mm culture dish were collected and homogenized in 300 μl of 20 mmHepes/NaOH, pH 7.4, by sonication. 80 μl of the homogenate was saved for immunoblot analysis, and the remainder was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min to separate the cytosol from membrane fraction. The pellet was homogenized in 220 μl of 20 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4, containing 1% Triton X-100 and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min to separate Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble fractions. The C-terminal heptapeptide (QEENTQL-COOH) of PLC-β3 was used as the bait in the yeast two-hybrid assay screening for proteins interacting with PLC-β3. Two positive clones from a human liver cDNA library were obtained and sequenced. They were found to contain the fragment of NHERF2 extending from the second PDZ domain to the C-terminal region. NHERF2 initially cloned by Yun et al. has two highly conserved PDZ domains, PDZ1 and PDZ2. These domains, which have been described as modules mediating protein-protein interaction in the submembranous region, recognize the C-terminal consensus sequence (X(S/T)X(V/L)-COOH) of target molecules. The binding specificity of the C-terminal motif of PLC-β3 for various different PDZ domains was examined with a yeast two-hybrid assay (TableI). The PLC-β3 motif interacted specifically with the PDZ2 of NHERF2 but not with the motif in PSD-95 and NHERF1, suggesting that the PLC-β3 binding is specific for NHERF2.Table INHERF2 interacts specifically with the PDZ domain binding motif of PLC-β3pBHA clonepGAD10 clonesHIS3β-GalactosidaseC terminus of PLC-β3 (NTQL)pGAD10 alone−−NHERF1 PDZ1−−PSD95 PDZ1−−NHERF2 PDZ2+++++The C-terminal heptapeptide of PLC-β3 was tested for its ability to bind NHERF2 in the yeast two-hybrid system revealed by the induction of the yeast reporter genes HIS3 and β-galactosidase.

To confirm the association of PLC-β3 with NHERF2, GST-NHERF2 expressed in E. coli strain BL21 was used in a pull-down assay of COS7 cell lysates. Immunoblot analysis using an anti-PLC-β3 antibody showed that PLC-β3 precipitated with GST-NHERF2 but not with GST alone (Fig.1 A). The extracts of COS7 cells expressing FLAG-PLC-β3 or FLAG-PLC-β3ΔC (C-terminal four amino acids deleted) were incubated with GST-NHERF2. Whole PLC-β3 was detected by the anti-FLAG antibody in the precipitate, whereas the C-terminally deleted form was not. This suggests that PLC-β3 interacted with NHERF2 via the C-terminal PDZ binding motif (Fig.1 B). NHERF1/EBP50 cloned by Reczek et al. shares high amino acid sequence homology with NHERF2 (32.Reczek D. Berryman M. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Both isotypes of NHERF regulate the activity of NHE3 and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in membranes. We examined whether NHERF1 would also interact with PLC-β3. Extracts of COS7 cells co-expressing FLAG-PLC-β3 together with HA-tagged NHERF1 or His6-tagged NHERF2 were allowed to immunoreact with anti-FLAG antibody. Subsequently, the immunocomplexes were analyzed with appropriate antibodies. As shown in Fig. 2, only NHERF2 was co-precipitated with PLC-β3, suggesting that PLC-β3 interacted specifically with NHERF2. All PLC-β isotypes have the consensus sequence of the PDZ binding motif at their C terminus, which enables the PLC-βs to associate with PDZ domain-containing proteins. We tested the interaction of NHERF2 with each PLC-β isotype by co-expressing NHERF2 with each isotype in COS7 cells (Fig. 3). When NHERF2 was precipitated from cellular extracts using an anti-NHERF2 antibody (antibody 2570), only PLC-β3 was detected in the precipitates (Fig.3 A). In parallel, immunoprecipitation assays using anti-FLAG antibody were performed on extracts of COS7 cells expressing NHERF2 and one of each FLAG-tagged PLC-β isotype. NHERF2 was detected in the immunoprecipitate together with FLAG-PLC-β3, but not with the other isotypes (Fig. 3 B). These data suggest that NHERF2 specifically interacts with PLC-β3, although a weak association with PLC-β2 was also detected (Fig. 3, A and B). It is known that PDZ domains bind to C-terminal four amino acids of target proteins. Ser or Thr at the −2-position and Leu or Val at the terminal position of the PDZ binding motif are essential for the interaction with PDZ domains, while other residues are less effective (33.Hall R.A. Ostedgaard L.S. Premont R.T. Blitzer J.T. Rahman N. Welsh M.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8496-8501Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). The binding preferences of NHERF2 were determined by mutating in turn the last four amino acids (NTQL-COOH) of PLC-β3 to Ala. The extracts of COS7 cells co-expressing each FLAG-tagged, mutant PLC-β3 and NHERF2 were reacted with anti-FLAG antibody, and the precipitate was then probed with anti-NHERF2 antibody. Mutation of Thr to Ala at the −2-position or Leu to Ala at the last position resulted in complete loss of NHERF2 binding to PLC-β3. In contrast, mutation of the other residues to Ala had no effect (Fig. 4). The results indicate that these Thr and Leu residues of PLC-β3 participate in the interaction with NHERF2. In order to determine which regions of NHERF2 take part in the interaction, we expressed and purified wild type as well as various fragments of NHERF2 as His6-tagged recombinant proteins as described previously (28.Yun C.H.C. Lamprecht G. Forster D.V. Sider A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25856-25863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). COS7 cell extracts were incubated with the recombinant NHERF2 constructs immobilized on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid beads. The precipitates were then probed with anti-PLC-β3 antibody. As shown in Fig.5 A, entire NHERF2 and fragments containing the PDZ2 domain were associated with PLC-β3. The data are consistent with the results obtained in the yeast two-hybrid system. Although the C-terminal region of NHERF2 by itself did not effectuate the direct binding to PLC-β3, the PDZ2 domain containing this region associated more tightly with PLC-β3 than PDZ2 alone (Fig.5 A). To confirm the above results, we undertook further immunoprecipitation experiments. The ERM binding domain-deleted form and the PDZ2-deleted form of NHERF2 were generated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The cell extracts containing FLAG-PLC-β3 and one of each recombinant NHERF2 were immunoreacted with anti-FLAG antibodies. Subsequently, the presence of NHERF2 bound to PLC-β3 was analyzed by immunoblot assay with anti-NHERF2 antibody. As shown in Fig.5 B, both wild type and the ERM binding domain-deleted form of NHERF2 associated with PLC-β3, but the PDZ2-deleted form did not, suggesting that PDZ2 is essential for the interaction. COS7 cells transfected with the genes for muscarinic receptor type 1 and various recombinant forms of NHERF2 were labeled with [3H]inositol as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After 12 h, the cells were treated with carbachol, and inositol phosphate release into the cytosol was measured. As shown in Fig. 6 A, the accumulation of inositol phosphates upon carbachol treatment increased 3–4-fold in the wild-type NHERF2-transfected cells relative to vector-transfected cells. On the other hand, the PDZ2-deleted NHERF2 had no effect. In addition, we established HeLa cell lines expressing wild type or deletion mutants of NHERF2. When the cells were fractionated employing a method previously used by Yao et al. (31.Yao I. Hata Y. Ide N. Hirao K. Deguch M. Nishioka H. Mizoguchi A. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11889-11896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), both PLC-β3 and wild type NHERF2 were co-localized in the Triton X-100-soluble membrane fraction. The localization of PLC-β3 was not influenced by overexpression of NHERF2, or vice versa. The subcellular localization of the PDZ2-deleted mutant was the same as that of the wild type. The ERM binding domain-deleted form was predominantly localized in the cytosolic fraction, although a small amount of the ERM binding domain-deleted form was detected in the membrane fraction (data not shown). The data suggest that the ERM binding domain may influence the localization of NHERF2 in cells. The accumulation of inositol phosphates after carbachol treatment in cells expressing wild type or the ERM binding domain-deleted form of NHERF2 was similar to that in the control cells. However, carbachol treatment of cells expressing the PDZ2-deleted form of NHERF2 only barely induced accumulation of inositol phosphates. This suggests that the muscarinic receptor-mediated PLC activity may be regulated by the PDZ2-mediated interaction of NHERF2 with PLC-β3 (Fig. 6 B). Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we found a molecule that interacted with PLC-β3. Since the C-terminal four amino acids of target proteins are sufficient to serve as the binding site for PDZ domain-containing proteins (33.Hall R.A. Ostedgaard L.S. Premont R.T. Blitzer J.T.

Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar), we used a C-terminal heptapeptide of PLC-β3 as bait and identified NHERF2 as a PLC-β3-interacting protein. NHERF2, also called E3KARP, was initially cloned by two-hybrid screening using the C-terminal tail of the Na+/H+ exchanger type 3 (NHE3) (35.Yun C.H.C. Oh S. Zizak M. Steplock D. Tsao S. Tse C.M. Weinman E.J. Donowitz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3010-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Because this protein was required for the cAMP-dependent inhibition of NHE3, it was thought to be a regulator of NHE3 (28.Yun C.H.C. Lamprecht G. Forster D.V. Sider A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25856-25863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). However, further studies revealed that NHERF2 does not act by itself but that it takes part in the regulation of NHE3 by anchoring other regulators. Recent studies have shown that NHERF can target PKA to NHE3 by associating with ezrin, a member of the ERM family, via the ERM-binding domain in its C-terminal region (36.Lamprecht G. Weinman E.J. Yun C.H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29972-29978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). By analogy, we suggest that NHERF2 may act as a scaffold in PLC-β-mediated signal transduction. To date, two isotypes of NHERF, NHERF1 (EBP50) and NHERF2 (E3KARP) have been cloned (29.Hall R.A.

In addition, it has been suggested that they play common roles in linking the cytoskeletal proteins to the plasma membrane. The ERM-binding domain interacts with ERM family proteins such as ezrin, radixin, and moesin, which associate with the cytoskeleton (36.Lamprecht G. Weinman E.J. Yun C.H.C. J. Biol.

Moreover, the ERM-binding domain interaction with activated ezrin suggests that the molecular interaction may be influenced by intracellular signaling events (38.Cabral J.H.M. Petosa C.

NHERF2 also associates with NHE3 via the second PDZ domain and other C-terminal region (28.Yun C.H.C. Lamprecht G. Forster D.V. Sider A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25856-25863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). They interact with the four C-terminal residues of cytoplasmic domains of the β2-adrenergic receptor and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator through their first PDZ domain (29.Hall R.A.

Our results show that NHERF2 interacts with PLC-β3; NHERF1 does not. These observation raise the possibility that each member of the NHERF family may be involved in the separate cellular events, although they sometimes have target molecules in common. With respect to the PLC-β isotypes, immunoprecipitates from extracts of cells co-expressing each PLC-β isotype and NHERF2 showed that NHERF2 specifically interacted with PLC-β3 but only barely with other types. Hall et al. suggested that the C-terminal motif (DTPL-COOH) of PLC-β1 might be a target site of NHERF (33.Hall R.A. Ostedgaard L.S. Premont R.T. Blitzer J.T. Rahman N. Welsh M.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8496-8501Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). In the yeast two-hybrid system, NHERF2 also associated with the motif of PLC-β1 (data not shown). However, NHERF2 failed to interact with PLC-β1 in in vivo binding assays, indicating that the specificity of an interaction through the PDZ domain may be determined by other regions as well as the binding motif itself. These data also suggest that the PLC-β isotypes act in different signaling pathways, although they share the common ability to hydrolyze phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. Studies of the molecular interactions of proteins with PDZ domains have shown that the PDZ domains interact with specific carboxyl termini carrying the consensus sequence ofX(S/T)X(V/L/I). The PDZ domain of cortactin-binding protein 1 and PICK1 interact with the C terminus of the somatostatin receptor (QTSI-COOH) and protein kinase C-α (QSAV-COOH), respectively (16.Zitzer H. Richter D. Kreienkamp H.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18153-18156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 41.Staudinger J. Lu J. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32019-32024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In some cases, other regions besides the PDZ domains are required for PDZ domain-mediated interaction. For example, the second PDZ domain and the carboxyl terminus of NHERF2 form a unit when they interact with NHE3 (28.Yun C.H.C. Lamprecht G. Forster D.V. Sider A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25856-25863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In this study, mutations of the Thr or Leu residues in the PLC-β3 tail to Ala caused the PLC-β3 or NHERF2 to disappear from immune complexes with anti-NHERF2 antibodies or anti-FLAG antibodies. The pull-down assay using fragments of NHERF2 showed that it was the second PDZ domain that associated with PLC-β3. The C-terminal region of NHERF2 enhanced this association, although it was not directly involved in the interaction. In addition, the mutant in which the second PDZ domain was deleted seemed not to interact with PLC-β3 based on the immunoprecipitation results. The data, thus, imply that the second PDZ domain and C-terminal region may cooperatively interact with PLC-β3. Since PDZ-containing proteins function as scaffolding proteins in many cases, we thought that NHERF2 may have an effect on the enzymatic activity of PLC-β3. However, we found that purified NHERF2 was unable to change PLC-β3 activity in vitro (data not shown). When muscarinic receptor type 1 and NHERF2 were co-transfected into COS7 cells, which express PLC-β3 rather than the other isotypes, expression of NHERF2 led to the enhancement of the PLC activity in response to carbachol treatment. However, the PDZ2-deleted form of NHERF2, which does not interact with PLC-β3, barely influenced the activation of PLC-β. In HeLa cells constitutively expressing recombinant NHERF2, expression of the PDZ2-deleted NHERF2 mutant caused blockage of the PLC-β activation by carbachol. Thus, by inhibiting the interaction between endogenous NHERF2 and PLC-β3, the mutant could block the signal that activates PLC-β3. Accumulation of inositol phosphates upon carbachol treatment in HeLa cells must be mainly due to the activity of PLC-β3, since large amounts of PLC-β3 were detected in the immunoassay, while other isotypes were hardly detectable. These results, therefore, suggest that NHERF2 may regulate PLC activity by anchoring PLC-β3. In summary, the C-terminal sequence in PLC-β3 binds to the second PDZ domain of NHERF2. This conclusion is in good agreement with recent demonstrations of PDZ domains recognizing the C terminus of their target proteins. Furthermore, other regions of PLC-β3 and the C-terminal region of NHERF2 may also be involved in the interaction. The isotype specificity of the interaction between PLC-β3 and NHERF2 shows that PDZ domain-containing proteins allow signaling molecules to transduce a specific intracellular signaling cascade. Expression of NHERF2 enhances the PLC-β3 activation by muscarinic receptors, although NHERF2 does not have a direct effect on the PLC-β3 activity. This result suggests the possibility that NHERF2 may facilitate the regulation of the PLC-β3 activity by forming complexes with certain signaling molecules. Further investigations are required to determine how NHERF2 organizes the molecules participating in signal transduction and the cross-talk between signaling pathways. We thank Drs. S.

We tested the ability of several of these compounds to inhibit transport by the CorA or MgtB Mg2+transport systems or the PhoQ receptor kinase for Mg2+ inSalmonella typhimurium. Cobalt(III)-, ruthenium(II)-, and ruthenium(III)-hexaammines were potent inhibitors of CorA-mediated influx. Cobalt(III)- and ruthenium(III)chloropentaammines were slightly less potent inhibitors of CorA. The compounds inhibited uptake by the bacterial S. typhimurium CorA and by the archaealMethanococcus jannaschii CorA, which bear only 12% identity in the extracellular periplasmic domain. Cation hexaammines also inhibited growth of S. typhimurium strains dependent on CorA for Mg2+ uptake but not of isogenic strains carrying a second Mg2+ uptake system. In contrast, hexacyano-cobaltate(III) and ruthenate(II)- and nickel(II)hexaammine had little effect on uptake. The inhibition by the cation hexaammines was selective for CorA because none of the compounds had any effect on transport by the MgtB P-type ATPase Mg2+ transporter or the PhoQ Mg2+ receptor kinase. These results demonstrate that cation hexaammines are potent and highly selective inhibitors of the CorA Mg2+ transport system and further indicate that the initial interaction of the CorA transporter is with a fully hydrated Mg2+ cation.

Compared with calcium, potassium, and sodium, Mg2+ possesses the largest hydrated radius, the smallest ionic radius, and the greatest charge density (1.Martin R.B. Metal Ions Biol. 1990; 26: 1-13Google Scholar). Its volume change from hydrated to atomic cation is almost 400-fold, whereas Ca2+, Na+, and K+ are only 25-, 25-, and 4-fold, respectively. Waters of hydration are bound 3–4 orders of magnitude more tightly to Mg2+ than to other common biological cations. The geometry of the hydration shell is octahedral with all six coordinate bond angles at angles of 90 ± 6°. This contrasts with the far more flexible geometry of the Ca2+ cation, which can tolerate bond angles of 90 ± 35° (1.Martin R.B. Metal Ions Biol. 1990; 26: 1-13Google Scholar, 2.Smith R.L. Maguire M.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 3.Cowan J.A. The Biological Chemistry of Magnesium. VCH Publishers, New York, NY1995Google Scholar). Study of Mg2+-dependent enzymes has revealed two types of interactions between Mg2+, enzymes, and ligands. Interaction can be through direct, inner sphere, coordination of a ligand to the metal ion or through an indirect, outer sphere, association with the bound water shell of the cation. In an outer sphere interaction, the relatively rigid geometry imposed by Mg2+ essentially holds a water molecule in place within the active site of an enzyme. The outer sphere form of Mg2+-mediated catalysis has been demonstrated in exonuclease III, ribonuclease H, and hairpin ribozymes (4.Huang H.-W. Cowan J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 5.Black C.B. Cowan J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 684-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 6.Hampel A. Cowan J.A.

(Tokyo). 1994; 116: 1322-1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Thus it is of interest to determine whether biochemical processes involving Mg2+ are of an inner sphere or outer sphere type. Cation hexaammines, such as cobalt(III)hexaammine (Co(III)Hex),1 are useful analogs of hydrated cations. The covalently and stably bound ammine groups mimic the size and shape of the hydration shell. These substitutionally inert hexaammine compounds provide a means to differentiate between inner and outer sphere Mg2+interactions (3.Cowan J.A. The Biological Chemistry of Magnesium. VCH Publishers, New York, NY1995Google Scholar, 8.Cowan J.A. Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 1067-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). If an enzyme is activated or inhibited by a substitutionally inert metal complex, an inner sphere interaction is not likely. There are a variety of such compounds with variations in net charge and number of hydrogen bond donors. This laboratory initially cloned and characterized the Salmonella typhimurium CorA Mg2+ transporter (9.Snavely M.D. Florer J.B. Miller C.G. Maguire M.E. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4761-4766Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 10.Hmiel S.P. Snavely M.D. Florer J.B. Maguire M.E. Miller C.G. J.

CorA is virtually ubiquitous in the bacteria and archaea and forms their constitutive Mg2+ influx system (12.Kehres D. Lawyer C.H. Maguire M.E. Microb. Comp. Genomics. 1998; 43: 151-169Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The topology of CorA consists of a large N-terminal periplasmic domain and three transmembrane segments at the C terminus (13.Smith R.L. Banks J.L. Snavely M.D. Maguire M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14071-14080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have also shown that even distant homologs of CorA function as Mg2+transporters. The CorA homolog of the Archeon Methanococcus jannaschii has only about 16% overall sequence identity to theS. typhimurium CorA. Expression of the M. jannaschii CorA in a Mg2+ transport-deficient strain of S. typhimurium elicits Mg2+ uptake with properties virtually identical to that of the Salmonellatransporter (14.Smith R.L. Gottlieb E. Kucharski L.M. Maguire M.E. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2788-2791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism of cation transport through CorA appears novel. In contrast to virtually all known cation transporters and channels, CorA does not utilize electrostatic interactions to move the highly charge dense Mg2+ cation across the membrane. The transmembrane domain of S. typhimurium CorA contains only a single negatively charged residue. Its mutation to alanine has no effect on transport. Site-directed mutagenesis of amino acids in the third transmembrane domain revealed the importance of three specific residues that line a single face of an α-helix. Likewise, mutagenesis of the second transmembrane segment indicated that a single face of its α-helix is important (15.Smith R.L. Szegedy M.A. Kacharski L.M. Walker C. Wiet R.M. Redpath A.

Despite the lack of electrostatic interactions between Mg2+ and the membrane domain of CorA, the large periplasmic domain is highly charged. It presumably functions, at least in part, to interact with hydrated Mg2+outside the cell and provide an initial binding site for subsequent interaction with the membrane domain. We therefore tested cation hexaammines and related compounds for their ability to inhibit Mg2+ transport via CorA. Both S. typhimurium and M. jannaschii CorA are potently inhibited by cobalt(III)hexaammine and other similar analogs. In contrast, these same compounds did not inhibit other proteins inS. typhimurium known to interact selectively with Mg2+. These results suggest that the initial binding site for Mg2+ in the CorA periplasmic domain binds a fully hydrated Mg2+ ion. CorA-dependent63Ni2+ uptake and growth were assayed using strain MM1927 (16.Szegedy M.A. Maguire M.E. J. Biol.

Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2788-2791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for M. jannaschii experiments. MM1927 was constructed by transforming the CorA plasmid, pMAS29, into MM281, a Mg2+ transport-deficient strain. MM1685 was constructed by transforming the M. jannaschii CorA-containing plasmid, pMETJA, into MM281. Growth inhibition was also assayed in MM199, a strain in which corA has been inactivated by insertion of a transposon but that still retains functional alleles for the MgtA and MgtB Mg2+ transporters (9.Snavely M.D. Florer J.B. Miller C.G. Maguire M.E. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4761-4766Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). MgtB-dependent63Ni2+ uptake was assayed using strain MM1111, which is MM281 transformed with the mgtB-containing plasmid pSPH39 (10.Hmiel S.P. Snavely M.D. Florer J.B. Maguire M.E. Miller C.G. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4742-4751Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PhoPQ-dependent transcription of themgtCB operon was assayed using strain MM1106, which contains pTTC-Lux, a plasmid with a mgtCB-luciferase reporter fusion (17.Tao T. Grulich P.F. Kucharski L.M.

Nickel(II)hexaammine, cobalt(III)- and ruthenium(III)chloropentaammine, potassium hexacyanocobaltate(III), and potassium hexacyanoruthenate(II) chlorides were obtained from Alfa Chemicals (Ward Hill, MA). Ni(III)hexaammine and Co(II)hexaammine were not tested, the former because it is not available and the latter because it is not stable in aqueous solution at physiological pH. Co(III)Hex, Ru(II)Hex, Ru(III)Hex, and Ni(II)Hex stock solutions were stored at −20 °C. All other solutions were made fresh for each use. All other reagents were obtained from Sigma, unless otherwise specified. Cultures were grown with shaking at 37 °C, with appropriate antibiotics, in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth (18.Miller J.H.

Luciferase assay buffer contains 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, with 0.01% dodecyl aldehyde. 63Ni2+ uptake was measured as described previously (9.Snavely M.D. Florer J.B. Miller C.G.

Cells were diluted 1:50 in supplemented N-minimal medium containing 1 mm Mg2+ and antibiotics. After 8 h growth, cells were collected by centrifugation at 1,000 × gfor 15 min and washed twice in an equal volume of Mg2+-free N-minimal medium. These cells were resuspended to a finalA 600 nm of 0.1 in supplemented N-minimal medium containing 10 μm Mg2+ and antibiotics and incubated overnight at 37 °C. MM1927 and MM1685 were grown overnight in LB broth containing 100 mm Mg2+ and appropriate antibiotics. After overnight growth, all strains were washed twice with Mg2+-free N-minimal medium and resuspended to an A 600 nm between 1.0 and 2.0 in Mg2+-free supplemented N-minimal medium. CorA-containing cells were washed with ice-cold buffer and kept on ice prior to the assay. MgtB-containing cells could not be washed with cold media or stored on ice without significant loss of transport activity (9.Snavely M.D. Florer J.B. Miller C.G. Maguire M.E. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4761-4766Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Transport of 63Ni2+ was assayed at 37 °C by adding 0.1 ml of cells to 0.9 ml of supplemented N-minimal medium containing 0.1–1.5 μCi of 63Ni2+ and 200 μm Ni2+ for assay of CorA or 20 μm Ni2+ for assay of MgtB, plus the indicated concentration of inhibitor. These concentrations of Ni2+approximate the K m for the respective transporters (9.Snavely M.D. Florer J.B. Miller C.G. Maguire M.E. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4761-4766Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Uptake was stopped after 5 min for CorA or 30 min for MgtB by addition of 5 ml of ice-cold transport wash buffer (N-minimal salts containing 5 mm Mg2+ and 1 mmEDTA). Samples were filtered through BA85 (0.45 μm) nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher & Schuell) and washed once with 5 ml of transport wash buffer. 63Ni2+ activity was determined by scintillation counting with an efficiency of 85%. MM1106, a strain containing amgtCB promoter-luciferase reporter construct (17.Tao T. Grulich P.F. Kucharski L.M. Smith R.L. Maguire M.E. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), was grown overnight at 37 °C in LB broth plus 100 mmMg2+ and antibiotics. The cells were washed three times with N-minimal medium containing no Mg2+ and resuspended in supplemented N-minimal medium to an A 600 nmbetween 0.050 and 0.080. These cultures were supplemented with Mg2+ or Co(III)Hex as indicated and grown at 37 °C. At each time point, a 250-μl aliquot was taken for luminescence and optical density readings. Luciferase activity was measured in triplicate for each sample by adding 10 μl of cells to 1 ml of luciferase assay buffer, vortexing for 5 s, and reading the sample in a luminometer for 10 s. Luminometer readings were normalized to cell number. MM1927, MM1685, and MM281 were grown overnight in LB broth plus 100 mm Mg2+ and antibiotics. The cells were washed twice with supplemented N-minimal medium containing no Mg2+. The cells were resuspended in supplemented N-minimal medium plus Mg2+, Co(III)Hex, or cobalt chloride as indicated, to an A 600 nm of 1.5. At each time point an aliquot of 1.2 ml of cells was taken and overlaid on 300 μl of a 2:1 mixture of dibutyl and dioctyl phthalate. The samples were spun in a microcentrifuge for 30 s, the supernatant was carefully aspirated, and the pellet was resuspended in 300 μl of 1.0 n nitric acid. The samples were then batch sonicated for 1 min, spun in a microcentrifuge to pellet cellular debris, and the supernatant was transferred to a new tube. Cobalt content of the supernatant was measured by atomic absorption as described previously (22.Moncrief M.B.C. Maguire M.E. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 3802-3809Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MM1927 and MM1685 were grown overnight in LB broth plus 100 mm Mg2+ and antibiotics. The cells were washed twice with Mg2+-free N-minimal medium and then diluted to a concentration of 5.6 × 104 cells/ml in supplemented N-minimal medium plus 50 μmMg2+. Cells (90 μl) and 10 μl of the appropriate concentration of each inhibitor were aliquoted into each well of a 96-well plate. The plate lid was sterilely swabbed with NeverFog® (North American Oil Company, Atlanta, GA) anti-fog shield to protect against condensation. The A 650 nm of the cells in each well was measured every 30 min for 16 h in a Molecular Devices THERMOmaxTM microplate reader (16.Szegedy M.A. Maguire M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36973-36979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). MM199 was grown overnight in LB broth plus 100 mm Mg2+ and 50 μg/μl kanamycin. The cells were washed twice with Mg2+-free supplemented N-minimal medium and then resuspended to an A 600 nm of 0.1 in 5 ml of supplemented N-minimal medium containing 50 μmMg2+ plus either 100 μm Co(III)Hex, Ru(II)Hex or no inhibitor. The A 600 nm of the cultures was determined after overnight growth at 37 °C. Statistical analyses using unpaired t tests were calculated using GraphPad Prism software (version 3.0). Mg2+ uptake via CorA is studied using63Ni2+ as a substitute because 28Mg2+ is no longer available (21.Grubbs R.D. Snavely M.D. Hmiel S.P. Maguire M.E. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 173: 546-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We used this assay to examine the effect of various cation hexaammine compounds on CorA-mediated uptake in S. typhimurium. Co(III)Hex, Ru(II)Hex, and Ru(III)Hex were potent inhibitors of63Ni2+ uptake (Fig.1). All three were more potent inhibitors than the actual substrates of CorA: Mg2+, Ni2+, and Co2+. Co(III)Hex had an IC50 of 1 μm (Table I), which at the 200 μm Ni2+ concentration used, corresponds to a K i of 500 nm. In contrast, Ni(II)Hex did not inhibit 63Ni2+ uptake at concentrations up to 30 μm (Fig.2).Table ICation inhibition of 63 Ni 2+ uptake by CorAInhibitorIC50S. typhimuriumM. jannaschiiμmMg2+ 10 10Co2+ 20 60Cobalt(III)hexaammine 1 0.5Ruthenium(II)hexaammine 3 3Ruthenium(III)hexaammine 3 3Nickel(II)hexaammine >30 >30Chloropentaamminecobalt(III)chloride 90 100Chloropentaammineruthenium(III)chloride 10 20Hexacyanocobaltate(III)>1000>1000Hexacyanoruthenate(II)>1000>1000Uptake of 63Ni2+ was assayed as described under “Materials and Methods” and the legends of Figs.

The identity in the periplasmic domain of approximately 235 residues is significantly lower at 32% overall similarity and 12% identity (12.Kehres D. Lawyer C.H. Maguire M.E. Microb. Comp.

In concert with those results, cation hexaammines also inhibited uptake mediated by theM. jannaschii CorA. The rank order of potency (Co(III)Hex < Ru(II)Hex = Ru(III)Hex) was identical for both CorA transporters. As with the S. typhimurium CorA, Ni(II)Hex also did not inhibit the M. jannaschii CorA transporter. The IC50 for each hexaammine (Table I) did not differ significantly between the two CorA homologs (p> 0.1), although there was a slight difference in Co2+affinity between the two CorA transporters (p < 0.0001). These data indicate that the overall structure of the cation binding site for the two transporters is functionally identical. Co(III)Pent and Ru(III)Pent differ from the hexaammine compounds by the substitution of a covalently bound chlorine for one ammine group. The introduction of the strongly electronegative chlorine moiety might be expected to alter the strength of hydrogen bonds formed by the ammine groups. Comparison of the interaction of cation hexaammines or chloropentaammines with the transporter could reflect the importance of hydrogen bond based outer sphere interactions. For both S. typhimurium and M. jannaschii CorA transporters, Co(III)Pent and Ru(III)Pent were 5–10-fold less potent inhibitors than the corresponding hexaammine derivatives (Fig. 3). The IC50 values (Table I) for Co(III)Hex versusCo(III)Pent differed significantly (p < 0.0001), as did those of Ru(III)Hex versus Ru(III)Pent (p < 0.05). The potential importance of outer sphere interactions involving hydrogen bond donors in CorA-mediated transport is further supported by the observation that potassium hexacyanocobaltate(III) and potassium hexacyanoruthenate(II) derivatives could not inhibit 63Ni2+ uptake (Table I and data not shown). We assayed the ability of the various cation derivatives to inhibit the growth of aS. typhimurium strain in which CorA was the only functional Mg2+ transporter. This phenotypic assay provides a direct test of the ability of the compounds to inhibit Mg2+ uptake as opposed to inhibition of Ni2+ uptake via CorA. It also provides an indication of the effectiveness of that inhibition in terms of altering Mg2+ homeostasis. The ability of the cation derivatives to inhibit growth of a CorA-dependent strain ofS. typhimurium correlated completely with the ability of the compounds to inhibit 63Ni2+ uptake via CorA. Ni(II)Hex, hexacyanocobaltate(III), and hexacyanoruthenate(II) did not inhibit growth at concentrations of 100 μm. In contrast, 30 μm Co(III)Hex or Ru(III)Hex markedly inhibited growth of strain MM1927, which is completely dependent on CorA for Mg2+ uptake. In contrast, neither Co(III)Hex nor Ru(III)Hex inhibited the growth of strains dependent on the MgtA or MgtB transporters (data not shown). Further, the ability of Co(III)Hex or Ru(III)Hex to inhibit CorA is not toxic per se, because neither compound inhibited growth of wild type S. typhimurium, which expresses the MgtA and MgtB Mg2+transport systems in addition to CorA. Potency of transport inhibition roughly corresponded with potency for growth inhibition because 100 μm Co(III)- and Ru(III)chloropentaammines were required to achieve the same growth inhibition as 30 μm Co(III)Hex or Ru(III)Hex (Fig.4). Similar growth inhibition was seen with an S. typhimurium strain dependent on the M. jannaschii CorA for Mg2+ uptake (data not shown). The ability of the cation hexaammines to inhibit both transport and growth could reflect an ability of the compounds to inhibit transport sufficiently to deprive the cells of Mg2+, or it could reflect actual transport and intracellular accumulation of the hexaammines leading to subsequent toxicity because of interference with Mg2+-dependent reactions. To determine which mechanism was most likely operative, we used atomic absorption spectroscopy to measure intracellular cobalt content of cells incubated with Co(III)Hex or with CoCl2 as a positive control (TableII). Negative controls included incubation of strains with Mg2+ (data not shown) and incubation of MM281, a Mg2+ transport-deficient strain, with both CoCl2 or Co(III)Hex (Table II). The cobalt content of MM281 incubated with either CoCl2 or Co(III)Hex presumably reflects a residual amount of cation bound to the membrane or trapped in the periplasmic space.Table IICobalt content of cells after incubation with Cor Co(III)HexStrainCorA expressedCobalt content ± S.D.aCobalt content was measured by atomic absorption as described under “Materials and Methods.” The results shown are the averages of three independent experiments.Co2+bCells were grown in either 100 μmCoCl2 or 100 μm Co(III)Hex for 10 min.Co(III)Hexnmol/A600nmMM281CorA−6.23 ± 1.5510.05 ± 2.59MM1927S. typhimuriumCorA19.33 ± 4.728.32 ± 2.71MM1685M. jannaschii CorA24.42 ± 1.709.59 ± 3.64a Cobalt content was measured by atomic absorption as described under “Materials and Methods.” The results shown are the averages of three independent experiments.b Cells were grown in either 100 μmCoCl2 or 100 μm Co(III)Hex for 10 min. Open table in a new tab In the presence of CoCl2, the cobalt content of cells expressing either the S. typhimurium or M. jannaschii CorA transporter was markedly greater than that of MM281 (p < 0.0001), reflecting previous data showing that Co2+ influx can be mediated by CorA. In contrast, the cobalt content of cells incubated with Co(III)Hex did not differ from the negative controls (p > 0.2). Thus we conclude that the cation hexa- and chloropentaammines inhibit growth by preventing Mg2+ uptake sufficiently to interfere with cellular metabolism but are not themselves transported into the cytosol. MgtB is a P-type ATPase that mediates Mg2+ influx in S. typhimurium and has no sequence similarity to CorA (23.Snavely M.D. Miller C.G. Maguire M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 815-823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Its mechanism of Mg2+transport is therefore presumably different than that of CorA, which is not dependent on ATP. No inhibitory effect of cation hexaammine on MgtB-mediated Mg2+ transport was seen (Fig. 1), indicating that Mg2+ interacts differently with the two transporters. PhoQ is the receptor or sensor kinase of the PhoPQ two-component regulatory system (24.Groisman E.A. Chiao E. Lipps C.J. Heffron F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7077-7081Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 25.Soncini F.C. Garcia V.E. Solomon F. Groisman E.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5092-5099Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The physiological ligand for PhoQ is extracellular Mg2+ (26.Vescovi E.G. Ayala Y.M. Di Cera E. Groisman E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1440-1443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) Transcription of themgtCB operon is regulated by the PhoPQ; as extracellular Mg2+ decreases, Mg2+ dissociates from PhoQ, resulting in the activation of the PhoP transcription factor. Cells grown in medium containing Mg2+ were washed and resuspended in media containing either 30 μm Co(III)Hex, 10 μm Mg2+, both Co(III)Hex and Mg2+, or water. Transcription was activated in the cells resuspended in Co(III)Hex or water but was repressed in the presence of Mg2+ (Fig. 5). Thus, Co(III)Hex, at a concentration that can almost completely inhibit CorA-mediated Mg2+ transport, could not repressmgtCB transcription via PhoPQ nor could Co(III)Hex block Mg2+ repression of transcription. We conclude that the Mg2+ binding site on PhoQ does not interact with the cation hexaammine. Mg2+-dependent enzymes have been demonstrated to bind Mg2+ either through direct coordination to the Mg2+ ion or through an indirect interaction with the hydration shell. Cation hexaammines are analogs of hydrated cations that can be used to study these Mg2+-ligand interactions (3.Cowan J.A. The Biological Chemistry of Magnesium. VCH Publishers, New York, NY1995Google Scholar, 8.Cowan J.A. Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 1067-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 27.Cowan J.A. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1993; 49: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We studied the effect of cation hexaammines on the Mg2+ transporters, CorA and MgtB, as well as the Mg2+ binding sensor kinase PhoQ. Cation hexaammines were selective and potent inhibitors of CorA-mediated Mg2+ transport but were not effective Mg2+ analogs for the MgtB and PhoQ proteins. The most straightforward interpretation of the ability of cation hexaammines to inhibit Mg2+ uptake via CorA is that the initial binding site for Mg2+ on CorA binds a hydrated Mg2+ ion. In contrast, their inability to inhibit MgtB or PhoQ indicates that these latter proteins bind a Mg2+ ion that is at least partially stripped of its hydration shell. The selectivity of the cation hexaammines for CorA is further demonstrated by their ability to inhibit the CorA transporter of M. jannaschii despite low sequence homology. This latter result also strongly suggests that the structure of the periplasmic domains of these two CorA transporters is similar, although they share only a 12% sequence identity in the extracellular periplasmic domain that presumably is the initial binding site for Mg2+. The initial CorA cation binding site also has the property that it does not discriminate by charge. Trivalent cations (Co(III)Hex, Ru(III)Hex, Co(III)Pent, and Ru(III)Pent) as well as divalent cations (Ru(II)Hex, Mg2+, Ni2+, and Co2+) are capable in interaction with CorA. Selectivity for inhibition of CorA by analogs of hydrated Mg2+ is indicated by the failure of the Ni(II)Hex and hexacyanocobaltate(III) and hexacyanoruthenate(II) cations to inhibit CorA-mediated transport. The inability of the cyano compounds can be reasonably attributed to their inability to form the same type of hydrogen bonds as the ammine derivatives. Because Ni2+ is a substrate for CorA, it seems surprising that Ni(II)Hex cannot inhibit uptake. This presumably reflects some difference in the properties of Ni(II)Hex versus the inhibitory cation hexaammines. Of the compounds tested here, adequate structural data appear to be available only for Ni(II)Hex, Co(III)Hex, and Co(III)Pent. All are stable at pH 7 in aqueous solution, at least over the time frame of these experiments. For example, the half-life of Co(III)Hex under such conditions is about 6 months (28.Llewellyn D.R. O'Connor C.J. Odell A.L. J. Chem. Soc. 1964; 1964: 196Crossref Google Scholar, 29.Rutenberg A.C. Drury J.S. Inorg. Chem. 1963; 2: 219Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The bond angle between the metal and the nitrogen of the ammines for all three compounds is 90.0 ± 0.2° (30.Meek D.W. Ibers J.A. Inorg. Chem. 1970; 9: 465-470Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 31.Hummel H.-U. Beiler F. Z. Anorg. Allg. Chem. 1988; 565: 147-153Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 32.Iwata M. Saito Y. Acta Crystallogr.

Mechanisms of Inorganic Reactions: A Study of Metal Complexes in Solution. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1967: 158-170Google Scholar), indicating that the overall structure of the analogs is identical. Although the charge of the cations is obviously different for Ni(II)Hexversus Co(III)Hex and Co(III)Pent, this is not a sufficient explanation for the failure of Ni(II)Hex to inhibit CorA because, as already noted above, the CorA binding site does not distinguish as to charge. The only significant difference between Ni(II)Hex and the two Co(III) compounds appears to be a small difference in their size. The Co-N bond length is 1.97Å for both Co(III)Hex and Co(III)Pent while the Ni-N bond length is somewhat greater at 2.13 Å (30.Meek D.W. Ibers J.A. Inorg. Chem. 1970; 9: 465-470Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 31.Hummel H.-U. Beiler F. Z. Anorg. Allg. Chem. 1988; 565: 147-153Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The N-H bond length is identical for all three. This translates into a difference in diameter of about 0.3 Å and a difference in cation volume of approximately 20% (59.2–60.7 Å3 for the Co(III) compounds versus 72.5 Å3 for Ni(II)Hex). If this interpretation is correct (and sufficient), it suggests that the cation binding site on CorA is between 4.9 and 5.2 Å in diameter. Growth of CorA-dependent strains was inhibited by cation hexaammines. Cation hexaammines did not inhibit the growth of a CorA knock-out strain, demonstrating that the inhibition is mediated by an interaction between CorA and the hexaammines and that inhibition of CorA is sufficient to inhibit growth if no other Mg2+transporters are present. The growth inhibition is most likely due to competitive inhibition of Mg2+ uptake not through toxic effects of the cation hexaammines themselves. This conclusion is supported by the observation that although Co(III)Hex effectively inhibits CorA-mediated Mg2+ transport, cobalt is not apparently transported into the cell. In turn, this is indirect evidence that there is a second step involved in cation transport, that is, at least the partial removal of the hydration shell. This is logical because if the hydration shell were not removed during passage through the membrane, it would imply that the pore or channel of CorA was 5Å in diameter. Unfortunately, it is not possible to test how much of the hydration shell must be removed using partially substituted cation ammines, e.g. a tetraammine-diaqua analog, because such compounds are unstable in aqueous solutions and hydrolyze readily (34.Basolo F. Pearson R.G. Mechanisms of Inorganic Reactions: A Study of Metal Complexes in Solution. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1967: 158-170Google Scholar, 35.Hendry P. Ludi A. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 1990; 35: 117-198Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Finally, CorA homologs have been found in nearly all bacterial and archaeal genomes (12.Kehres D. Lawyer C.H. Maguire M.E. Microb. Comp. Genomics. 1998; 43: 151-169Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This suggests that cation hexaammines could inhibit growth of most organisms in these kingdoms. However, because many species have secondary Mg2+ transporters, cation hexaammines alone are not likely to be bacteriocidal agents. Nonetheless, modified cation chloropentaammines could have potential as antibiotics. Cation chloropentaammines of Co(III) and Ru(III) were potent inhibitors of CorA. The chlorine therefore had no major detrimental effect on binding, which implies that the binding site does not interact with all six ligands bonded to the cation. It might therefore be possible to replace the chlorine with a bacteriocidal moiety coupled via a spacer chain. Such a molecule might be selectively directed to the bacterial membrane because of the affinity of cation pentaammine derivatives for the CorA transporter, allowing selective delivery of the bacteriocidal component. Thus, in addition to being useful tools for studying Mg2+ interactions, cation hexaammine compounds could potentially be developed as broad spectrum antibiotics based on their specificity for CorA. We thank Dr. A. Romani for assistance with the atomic absorption measurements and Dr. J. Cowan for advice and for sharing expertise about cation hexaammines."

Electrophoretic mobility shift assays with specific competitors and antibodies show that both box A and box B bind to Sp1 and Sp3 and that box C binds nuclear factor-Y (NF-Y). Luciferase reporter assays revealed that although box A and box B alone have no independent effect on luciferase activities, box C alone stimulates transcription. However, the inclusion of all three elements lead to maximal activity because of a synergistic effect, mainly between box B and box C, suggesting that functional synergism between Sp1/Sp3 and NF-Y is critical for the pyruvate kinase M (PKM) gene distal promoter activity. In fact, co-transfection of a dominant negative mutant of NF-YA (NF-YA29) resulted in a decrease in reporter activity in a box C-dependent manner. In addition, the overexpression of Sp1 or Sp3 and NF-Y in Drosophila SL2 cells synergistically stimulated PKM gene distal promoter activity. Using a mammalian two-hybrid system in HeLa cells, it was shown that both Sp1 and Sp3 interacted with NF-YA but not NF-YB and NF-YC. Moreover, glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays revealed that only in vitro translated35S-labeled NF-YA interacted with both Sp1 and Sp3 in vitro.

Chem. 1987; 262: 14366-14371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of the rat, the PKM gene encodes for both M1- and M2-type PK isoenzymes, whereas the PKL gene encodes for both the R- and L-types (2.Noguchi T. Inoue H. Tanaka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13807-13812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Takenaka M. Noguchi T. Inoue H. Yamada K. Matsuda T. Tanaka T. J. Biol.

Exons 9 and 10 contain nucleotide sequences that are specific to M1-PK and M2-PK, respectively. The other exons are common to both isoenzymes. Although M1-PK is expressed in the skeletal muscle, heart, and brain, M2-PK is expressed in broad variety of tissues. Thus, these isoenzymes are produced from a common primary transcript by mutually exclusive alternative splicing that selects exon 9 or exon 10 in a tissue-specific manner. PKM gene expression is regulated under a variety of conditions (6.Yamada K. Noguchi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 256: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Although the M2-PK isoenzyme is the only one that is detectable in early fetal tissues, it is gradually replaced by tissue-specific isoenzymes such as M1-, L-, and R-types as development proceeds. In contrast, when the cells or tissues that express these tissue-specific isoenzymes are de-differentiated or develop a neoplasm, their expression is reduced or disappears, and M2-PK expression is activated or enhanced. Two DNase I-hypersensitive sites of the PKM gene have been detected in rat hepatoma cells (7.Wang Z. Takenaka M. Imai E. Yamada K. Tanaka T. Noguchi T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). These sites, HS-1 and HS-2, are not observed in hepatocytes, which do not express the PKM gene. HS-1 is located in the first intron, and HS-2 is in the vicinity of the transcription initiation sites. Accordingly, an alteration in chromatin structure may be involved in the transcriptional activity of thePKM gene. It has been shown that transcriptional regulatory elements of the rat PKM gene are located within the −279 base pairs upstream of transcription initiation sites using transient transfection assays of the PKM promoter/chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter plasmid (7.Wang Z. Takenaka M. Imai E. Yamada K. Tanaka T. Noguchi T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The HS-2, but not the HS-1 site, was found to be involved in promoter activity. Two regulatory regions in the PKM gene promoter exist, the distal and proximal regions. The distal region consists of threecis-acting elements, which are referred to as boxes A (−279 to −265), B (−256 to −242), and C (−235 to −216). The deletion of this region results in a dramatic decrease in transcriptional activity. Thus far, their binding proteins are unknown (7.Wang Z. Takenaka M. Imai E. Yamada K. Tanaka T. Noguchi T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In contrast, the proximal region consists of multiple GC boxes, GC box 1 (−48 to −39), GC box 2 (−86 to −77), and GC box 3 (−133 to −124) (8.Netzker R. Weigert C. Brand K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 174-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Both GC boxes 1 and 3 are functionally active. GC box 2 is functionally silent in the case of FTO-2B rat hepatoma cells but not in C2C12 rat myocytes (8.Netzker R. Weigert C. Brand K. Eur. J.

These proteins are members of the Sp family (13.Philipsen S. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2991-3000Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Sp2 does not recognize the same sequences as Sp1 (11.Kingsley C. Winoto A. Mol. Cell.

Nuclear factor-Y (NF-Y), which is also referred to as the CCAAT-binding factor, binds to an inverted CCAAT box (5′-ATTGG-3′) in many gene promoters and transactivates their transcription (18.Maity S.N. de Crombrugghe B.

NF-Y, which is highly conserved among species, is ubiquitously expressed and is composed of three subunits, NF-YA, NF-YB, and NF-YC, all of which are necessary for DNA binding (18.Maity S.N. de Crombrugghe B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 174-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 20.Sinha S. Maity S.N. Lu J. de Crombrugghe B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1624-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). NF-YB and NF-YC interact tightly with one another, and their association precedes association with NF-YA and binding to the cognate DNA sequences (21.Sinha S. Kim I.-S. Sohn K.-Y. de Crombrugghe B. Maity S.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 328-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The present study reports on the identification and characterization of the box A-, B-, and C-binding proteins. Whereas the Sp family members, Sp1 and Sp3, bind to both box A and box B, respectively, NF-Y binds to box C. In addition, we report that these transcription factors contribute in a cooperative manner to stimulate the transcription from the PKM gene promoter via protein-protein interactions.

A 2-kbEcoRI/XbaI fragment of the pGAL4-Sp1 was isolated and subcloned into the EcoRI/XbaI sites of the pBluescriptII SK vector. A 2-kb EcoRI/NotI fragment of the resultant plasmid was ligated into theEcoRI/NotI sites of the pGEX-5X-1 to produce the GST-Sp1 fusion protein expression plasmid (pGST-Sp1). The pRSV-Sp1 plasmid, a Sp1 expression vector, was a generous gift from Dr. Yosiaki Fujii-Kuriyama (Tohoku University, Japan) (25.Imataka H. Sogawa K. Yasumoto K. Kikuchi Y. Sasano K. Kobayashi A.

The insert DNA was subcloned into the SmaI/BglII sites of the pGL3-Basic vector to produce the 5× Gal4 E1b/Luc plasmid. pSG424, NF-YA·pET3a, NF-YB·pET3a, and NF-YC·pET3a vectors were kindly provided by Dr. Daryl K. Granner (Vanderbilt University) (29.Sadowski I. Ptashne M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7539Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 30.Yamada K. Printz R.L. Osawa H. Granner D.K. Biochem.

To easily prepare overexpression constructs for GAL4 fusion protein, a synthesized double-stranded oligonucleotide consisting of customized multiple cloning sites with 5′ suppressed EcoRI and 3′ intact SacI cohesive sites 5′-AATTGCATATGGAATTCCCGGGGATCCGTCGACGAGCT-3′ was inserted into theEcoRI/SacI sites of the pSG424. This pSG424(N/R) vector contained the introduced multiple cloning sites consisting ofNdeI/EcoRI/SmaI/BamHI/SalI/SacI in that order. NdeI/EcoRI fragments from NF-YA·pET3a, NF-YB·pET3a, or NF-YC·pET3a were ligated into theNdeI/EcoRI site of the pSG424(N/R), thus generating pSG-NF-YA, pSG-NF-YB, and pSG-NF-YC, respectively. The NF-YA·pET3a and pSG-NF-YA were digested with AflII and blunt-ended to produce the NF-YA269·pET3a and the pSG-NF-YA269. These constructs express the amino acid sequence between 1 and 269 of NF-YA under an in vitro translation reaction or the truncated NF-YA fused to GAL4 DNA-binding domain (DBD) driven by SV40 promoter, respectively. The synthesized oligonucleotides, 5′-CCTCGAGCCCGGGGAATTCGAGCT-3′ and 5′-CTAGAGCTCGAATTCCCCGGGCTCGAGGGTAC-3′ were annealed, phosphorylated, and ligated into the KpnI/XbaI sites of the pHK3nVP16 to produce the pVP16B1 vector. A 2.0-kbEcoRI/XbaI from pGAL4-Sp1 was inserted into theEcoRI/XbaI sites of the pVP16B1 to obtain pVP16-Sp1. A 2.3-kb BamHI fragment from pPac-Sp3 was subcloned into the BamHI site of the pHK3nVP16 to produce the pVP16-Sp3. The sequences of all plasmids were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out according to the method of Künkel et al.(32.Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4903) Google Scholar). A KpnI/HindIII fragment of pMcat286 was subcloned into the KpnI/HindIII sites of the pUC118, and the resulting plasmid was used as a template for mutagenesis. Boxes A, B, and C were mutated alone or in combinations using the following primers, 5′-CCGCCGCCACAAACCCTAGATCC-3′ for box A, 5′-GGCAGGACCCATCCTCGGGTCC-3′ for box B, and 5′-CATTCTGATGGACCAGGGGGAAGTGG-3′ for box C, respectively (mutated bases are underlined). These mutants were verified by DNA sequencing. KpnI/HindIII fragments from mutated plasmids were subcloned into theKpnI/HindIII sites of the pGL3-Basic to produce pMPK/Luc287-mutA, pMPK/Luc287-mutB, pMPK/Luc287-mutC, pMPK/Luc287-mutA/B, pMPK/Luc287-mutA/C, pMPK/Luc287-mutB/C, and pMPK/Luc287-mutA/B/C. The preparation of pLcat62′ has been described previously (33.Yamada K. Noguchi T. Matsuda T. Takenaka M. Monaci P. Nicosia A. Tanaka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19885-19891Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A KpnI/HindIII fragment of the pLcat62′ was inserted into the KpnI/HindIII sites of the pGL3-Basic vector to generate the DdeL reporter plasmid. Polymerase chain reactions were carried out using wild type or mutated pMPK/Luc plasmids as templates in a combination of 5′-LUC primer, 5′-CTAGCAAAATAGGCTGTCCC-3′, and 3′-MPK primer, 5′-CCGGGGTACCCGCATGGGTCATTCTGATG-3′. These products were digested with KpnI and subcloned into the KpnI site of the DdeL to obtain the WT/DdeL, mutA/DdeL, mutB/DdeL, mutC/DdeL, mutAB/DdeL, mutAC/DdeL, mutBC/DdeL, or mutABC/DdeL, respectively. The sequences of all plasmids were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. DNA transfections for HepG2 cells and HeLa cells were carried out by a calcium phosphate method (34.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). All plasmids used for transfection were prepared using a Qiagen plasmid kit, followed by CsCl gradient ultracentrifugation. 5 × 104 cells/well were inoculated in a 24-well plate on the day prior to transfection. CV-1 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE PLUS. 2 × 105 cells/well were inoculated in a 24-well plate on the day before transfection. In both transfection methods, the indicated amount of reporter plasmid, pRL-SV or pRL-TK, and expression plasmid were used. The total amount of DNA was adjusted by adding pGEM3 plasmid, if required. 3 h (LipofectAMINE PLUS method) or 4 h (calcium phosphate method) after transfection, the medium was changed. The cells were harvested for determination of both firefly and sea pansy luciferase activities at 48 h after transfection. DNA transfections for SL2 cells were carried out by a calcium phosphate method (35.Di Nocera P.P. Dawid I.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7095-7098Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Cells were plated at 1 × 106 cells/60-mm dish on day 0. On day 1, the cells were transfected with 2 μg of luciferase reporter plasmid and the indicated amount of pPac-derived expression vectors. The total amount of DNA (2.1 μg) was adjusted by an addition of the pPac plasmid. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and assays were performed as described below. The 5× Gal4 E1b/Luc was used as a reporter construct. pSG424, pSG-NF-YA, pSG-NF-YA269, pSG-NF-YB, and pSG-NF-YC plasmids were used as GAL4 DBD fusion protein expression plasmids. pHK3nVP16, pVP16-Sp1, and pVP16-Sp3 plasmids were used as VP16 activation domain (AD) expression plasmids. 0.3 μg of 5× Gal4 E1b/Luc plasmid, 0.1 μg of GAL4 DBD fusion protein expression plasmid, 0.1 μg of VP16 AD fusion protein expression plasmid, and 0.006 μg of pRL-SV were transfected into the HeLa cells with a calcium phosphate method, and luciferase activities were determined 48 h after transfection. Firefly and sea pansy luciferase assays were carried out according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol. Luciferase activities were determined by a Berthold Lumat model LB 9501. Firefly luciferase activities (relative light units) were normalized by sea pansy luciferase activities. For SL2 cells, protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagents (36.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Bovine γ globlin was used as a standard. Firefly luciferase activities were normalized by protein amount of cell extract. TOPP3 cells were transformed with the pGEX-5X-1, pGST-Sp1, or pGST-Sp3 fusion protein expression plasmid. Preparation of GST fusion protein, 35S labeling of in vitro translated NF-YA, NF-YA269, NF-YB, or NF-YC, and pull-down analysis were previously described (30.Yamada K. Printz R.L. Osawa H. Granner D.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 614-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Finally, the beads were resuspended in an equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer, and each supernatant was loaded on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel, along with a prestained molecular weight marker. The gel was dried and exposed to Kodak X-AR film with an intensifying screen at −80 °C. The relative purity and amount of each fusion protein were determined by gel-staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. EMSA was used to identify the proteins in nuclear extracts from rat hepatoma dRLh-84 cells that interact with boxes A, B, and C, respectively. Box A contains a GT box, a GC box, as well as sterol response element (SRE)-like sequences. Thus, the following oligonucleotides were used for competition experiments; mut box A oligonucleotide is mutated in a GT box, the mut box A2 is mutated in a GC box, along with overlapping SRE-like sequences, and SP1 and SRE-1 oligonucleotides contain a consensus GC box sequence and a consensus SRE sequence, respectively. Binding complexes of32P-labeled box A oligonucleotide nearly disappeared on the addition of a 200-fold molar excess of unlabeled box A and mut box A2 and a 120-fold molar excess of unlabeled SP1 oligonucleotides to the binding mixture (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, the addition of a 200-fold molar excess of box C, mut box A, and SRE-1 oligonucleotides resulted in no competition. Interestingly, the addition of a 200-fold molar excess of unlabeled box B led to the disappearance of the binding complex. These results suggest that the box A-binding protein binds to a GT box sequence but not a GC box or an SRE in box A and that they are similar to the box B-binding protein. DNA-protein complexes with labeled box B oligonucleotide mobilities similar to those of box A-protein complexes (Fig. 1 B). These complexes disappeared on the addition of an excess of unlabeled box B or SP1 oligonucleotide but not on the addition of a box C oligonucleotide. The addition of a 200-fold molar excess of unlabeled box A resulted in only a slight reduction in the intensity of the bands. In contrast, mut box B oligonucleotide in which 5′-GGGCGG-3′ of box B is replaced by 5′-GGATGG-3′ failed to competitively bind to the probe. Lastly, when a labeled SP1 oligonucleotide was incubated with the same nuclear extracts, the mobilities of the resulting DNA-protein complexes were identical with those of box A- or box B-protein complexes (Fig. 1 C). Whereas these complexes either disappeared or were decreased by the addition of a 200-fold molar excess of unlabeled SP1, box B, and box A oligonucleotides, the addition of either a 200-fold molar excess of unlabeled mut box B or box C had no effect. These results suggest that Sp1 or closely related proteins bind to a GT box in box A as well as GC box in box B and that the binding affinity of these proteins to each oligonucleotide is in the order SP1 > box B > box A oligonucleotides. We then examined the issue of whether Sp family members are capable of binding to both boxes A and B using a specific antiserum against Sp1 and Sp3. As shown in Fig. 2 A, the incubation of a hepatoma nuclear extract with the anti-Sp1 antiserum resulted in a faint supershifted band and a concomitant decrease in the abundance of the slowly migrating band. In addition, incubation with ant"

These reactions comprise the SMM cycle. Two Arabidopsis cDNAs specifying enzymes that mediate the SMM → Met reaction (SMM:HcyS-methyltransferase, HMT) were identified by homology and authenticated by complementing an Escherichia coli yagDmutant and by detecting HMT activity in complemented cells. Gel blot analyses indicate that these enzymes, AtHMT-1 and -2, are encoded by single copy genes. The deduced polypeptides are similar in size (36 kDa), share a zinc-binding motif, lack obvious targeting sequences, and are 55% identical to each other. The recombinant enzymes exist as monomers. AtHMT-1 and -2 both utilize l-SMM or (S,S)-AdoMet as a methyl donor in vitro and have higher affinities for SMM. Both enzymes also use either methyl donor in vivo because both restore the ability to utilize AdoMet or SMM to a yeast HMT mutant. However, AtHMT-1 is strongly inhibited by Met, whereas AtHMT-2 is not, a difference that could be crucial to the control of flux through the HMT reaction and the SMM cycle. Plant HMT is known to transfer the pro-R methyl group of SMM. This enabled us to use recombinant AtHMT-1 to establish that the other enzyme of the SMM cycle, AdoMet:MetS-methyltransferase, introduces the pro-Smethyl group.

SMM can then serve as a methyl donor for the synthesis of Met from homocysteine (Hcy) catalyzed by Hcy S-methyltransferase (HMT, EC 2.1.1.10). The tandem action of MMT and HMT, plus that ofS-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) hydrolase, constitutes the SMM cycle (Fig. 1). Although MMT and the SMM cycle are unique to plants, HMT occurs in bacteria, yeast, and mammals, enabling them to catabolize SMM of plant origin and providing an alternative to the methionine synthase reaction as a means to methylate Hcy (4.Shapiro S.K.

In wheat and other plants, SMM is synthesized in leaves and transported via the phloem to developing seeds where it can be used to methylate Hcy (8.Bourgis F. Roje S. Nuccio M.L. Fisher D.B.

SMM is also synthesized by morning glory flower buds and then used to methylate Hcy during blooming (9.Hanson A.D. Kende H. Plant Physiol. 1976; 57: 528-537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The halves of the SMM cycle can thus sometimes be separated in space or time. However, both halves may also operate concurrently in the same tissue, and in these cases the cycle has been hypothesized to remove excess AdoMet (3.Mudd S.H. Datko A.H. Plant Physiol. 1990; 93: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Testing this hypothetical homeostatic role, which is analogous to that of the cyclic methylation/demethylation of Gly in mammalian liver (10.Balaghi M. Horne D.W. Wagner C. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 145-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), requires determination of flux through the SMM cycle in defined tissuesin vivo. Methods to do this are lacking. The first enzyme of the SMM cycle, MMT, has been purified fromWollastonia biflora and barley, and characterized (2.James F. Nolte K.D. Hanson A.D. J. Biol.

Much less is known about plant HMTs, and none has been cloned from plants or other eukaryotes. HMT was partially purified from jack beans and germinating peas (12.Abrahamson L. Shapiro S.K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1965; 109: 376-382Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar,13.Dodd W.E. Cossins E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 201: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and shown to be stereoselective for one of the two methyl groups of SMM (the pro-R methyl) (14.Grue-Sorensen G. Kelstrup E. Kjaer A. Madsen J.O. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1984; 1: 1091-1097Crossref Google Scholar). The preparations obtained used either SMM or AdoMet as methyl donor; it was not established whether both activities reside on the same protein. These data appear to indicate that plants can bypass SMM by recycling AdoMet methyl groups directly to Met (Fig. 1, dotted arrows). However, the AdoMet substrates used in these experiments most probably contained significant levels of the nonphysiologicalR,S diastereomer (15.Hoffman J.L. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4444-4449Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), and it has been suggested that this, not the physiological S,S form, is the substrate for HMTs (7.Neuhierl B. Thanbichler M. Lottspeich F. Böck A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5407-5414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The form of AdoMet that plant HMTs utilize is therefore unclear. Neither jack bean nor pea HMT was strongly inhibited by Met (≤25% inhibition by 10 mm Met; Refs. 12.Abrahamson L. Shapiro S.K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1965; 109: 376-382Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar and 13.Dodd W.E. Cossins E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 201: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), which contrasts with the Met sensitivity of the yeast enzyme (12.Abrahamson L. Shapiro S.K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1965; 109: 376-382Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Recently, the Escherichia coli YagD protein was shown to be an HMT, and a similar enzyme, selenocysteineSe-methyltransferase (SeCysMT), was characterized and cloned from the selenium-accumulating plant Astragalus bisulcatus(7.Neuhierl B.

These enzymes share significant primary sequence homology (7.Neuhierl B. Thanbichler M. Lottspeich F. Böck A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5407-5414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and have a GGCC motif near the C terminus. The cysteine residues in this motif have been implicated in zinc binding in two other enzymes that catalyze methyl transfers to Hcy, E. coliB12-dependent Met synthase and mammalian betaine-Hcy methyltransferase (18.Peariso K. Goulding C.W. Huang S. Matthews R.G. Penner-Hahn J.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 8410-8416Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 19.Millian N.S. Garrow T.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 356: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The enzyme-bound zinc is required to activate the thiol group of Hcy for nucleophilic attack (18.Peariso K. Goulding C.W. Huang S. Matthews R.G. Penner-Hahn J.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 8410-8416Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In this work, we identified two Arabidopsis homologs of YagD and confirmed that they encode HMTs. The recombinant enzymes were partially characterized, with emphasis on clarifying their substrate specificity and sensitivity to Met. We also surveyed the genomic complexity of HMT genes in Arabidopsis and used the known stereoselectivity of HMT to establish that of the other enzyme of the SMM cycle, MMT. The results of the stereospecificity study suggest a novel approach to determining flux through the SMM cycle in vivo. l-[35S]Met (>800 Ci mmol−1) andl-[methyl-14C]AdoMet (58 mCi mmol−1; in 10 mmH2SO4, ethanol, 9:1) were from NEN Life Science Products; l-[1-14C]Met (55 mCi mmol−1) was from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO), and d-[1-14C]Met (56 mCi mmol−1) was from Moravek Biochemicals (Brea, CA).l-[35S]SMM (10 μCi nmol−1) andd- and l-[1-14C]SMM were synthesized from radiolabeled Met and purified as described previously (20.Gage D.A. Rhodes D. Nolte K.D. Hicks W.A. Leustek T. Cooper A.J.L. Hanson A.D. Nature. 1997; 387: 891-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar); radiochemical purities were >99%.l-[U-13C5]Met (97–98%13C abundance) was from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Andover, MA). (6R,6S)5-Methyltetrahydrofolate was obtained from Schirks Laboratories and 3-dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) from Research Plus (Bayonne, NJ); other biochemicals were from Sigma. l-SMM iodide was either converted to the chloride using Dowex-1 (Cl−) (for enzyme assays) or freed of traces of Met and converted to the free base using Dowex-1 (OH−) and then neutralized with HCl (for growth media). d- andl-Hcy were freshly prepared from the thiolactone hydrochlorides (21.Duerre J.A. Miller C.H. Anal. Biochem. 1966; 17: 310-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). dl-Selenocysteine was prepared immediately before use by reduction of dlselenocystine with NaBH4 (17.Neuhierl B. Böck A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar); the product was verified by TLC on cellulose developed in n-butanol:acetic acid:water (6:2:2, v/v). Recombinant Arabidopsis MMT was prepared as described (8.Bourgis F. Roje S. Nuccio M.L. Fisher D.B. Tarczynski M.C. Li C. Herschbach C. Rennenberg H. Pimenta M.J. Shen T.-L. Gage D.A. Hanson A.D. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 1485-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Ion exchange resins were from Bio-Rad. Cellulose (0.1 mm) TLC plates were from Merck, and silica gel G (0.25 mm) plates were from Machery-Nagel. The S,S(biologically active) and R,S (inactive) diastereomers of AdoMet were separated by HPLC essentially as described by Beaudouinet al. (22.Beaudouin C. Haurat G. Lafitte J.A. Renaud B. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 928-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Analytical scale separations of [methyl-14C]AdoMet and unlabeled AdoMet were made on a 1 × 150 mm Reliasil C18 column using a microbore HPLC system (UMA model, Michrom Bioresources, Auburn, CA). Solvent A was water containing 0.1 m sodium acetate, 20 mmcitric acid, 0.93 mm octanesulfonic acid, and 0.12 mm EDTA; solvent B was methanol, and the gradient was from 100–95% solvent A in 45 min. The elution profile was monitored at 258 nm. The [methyl-14C]AdoMet contained no detectable R,S form (1% or less) and was used without further purification. As previously reported (15.Hoffman J.L. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4444-4449Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), unlabeled AdoMet was found to contain ≈15% of the R,S isomer. In the few cases (see “Results”) in which unlabeled AdoMet was included in enzyme assays, specific radioactivity calculations were based on its (S,S)-AdoMet content. The E. coli strain used in complementation tests was MTD123 (ΔyagD ΔmetEΔmetH) (16.Thanbichler M. Neuhierl B. Böck A. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 662-665Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the expression vector was pBluescript SK- (Stratagene). The minimal medium was M9 (24.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) containing 0.8% glucose,l-Met, or l-SMM (70 μm) and 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. TheS. cerevisiae strains CY61–1A (MATα his3 leu2 ura3 ade2 trp1 met6::HIS3) and CY61–1D (MATa his3 leu2 ura3 ade2 trp1 met6::HIS3 ypl273::URA3 yll062::HIS3) were obtained from Y. Surdin-Kerjan (Centre de Génétique Moléculaire, CNRS, Gif-sur-Yvette, France). The yeast expression vector was pVT102-L (25.Vernet T. Digard D. Thomas D.Y. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 52: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). The synthetic minimal medium for yeast and the culture conditions were as described (26.Raymond R.K. Kastanos E.K. Appling D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 372: 300-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) except for the inclusion of adenine (100 μm) and l-SMM or AdoMet (100 μm). Arabidopsis expressed sequence tags, GenBankTM accession numbers T46013 and H37463 (encoding AtHMT-1 and -2, respectively), were obtained from theArabidopsis Biological Resource Center (Columbus, OH). The ≈750-base pair insert in H37463, which is truncated at the 5′-end, was used to isolate a full-length cDNA from anArabidopsis (ecotype Landsberg erecta) leaf library in the λ Uni-Zap XR vector (Stratagene) (provided by T. L. Thomas, Texas A&M University). DNA sequencing procedures were as described (8.Bourgis F. Roje S. Nuccio M.L. Fisher D.B. Tarczynski M.C. Li C. Herschbach C. Rennenberg H. Pimenta M.J. Shen T.-L. Gage D.A. Hanson A.D. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 1485-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Sequence alignments were made using Clustal W 1.7 (27.Higgins D.G. Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 383-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar); phylogenetic analysis was carried out using the Darwin system at the ETH server. Homology searches were made using BLAST programs (28.Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59762) Google Scholar). HMT coding sequences were amplified from plasmid templates by high fidelity polymerase chain reaction using recombinant Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The primers included the first or last 6–7 codons plus restriction sites for cloning into pBluescript SK- and, for the forward primers, a Shine-Delgarno sequence preceded by a stop codon in frame with the LacZ protein encoded by the vector. The AtHMT-1 primers were 5′-CGGAATTCTTGAAGGAAACAGCTATGGTTTTGGAGAAAAAATC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCCAAGCTTTCATCTTCGTTTCAAATCTC-3′ (reverse); the AtHMT-2 primers were 5′-AAAACTGCAGGTGAAGGAAACAGCTATGACCGGAAACTCTTTTAAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CGGGGTACCCTAAAGAGATCTGCGGTTGAC-3′ (reverse). After ligation into pBluescript, constructs were introduced into E. colistrain DH10B by electroporation. Plasmid preparations were sequenced to verify the inserts and used to transform E. coli strain MTD123 by electroporation. HMT coding sequences were amplified as above using primers that included the first or last eight codons plus BamHI and PstI restriction sites for cloning into pVT102-L. pVT102-L contains the leu2-d gene for selection and the ADH1 promoter to drive gene expression (25.Vernet T. Digard D. Thomas D.Y. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 52: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). The AtHMT-1 primers were 5′-CGCGGATCCATGGTTTTGGAGAAAAAATCTGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-AAAACTGCAGTCATCTTCGTTTCAAATCTCTGG-3′ (reverse); AtHMT-2 primers were 5′-CGCGGATCCATGACCGGAAACTCTTTTAACTC-3′ (forward) and 5′-AAAACTGCAGCTAAAGAGATCTGCGGTTGACGA-3′ (reverse). After ligation into pVT102-L, constructs were introduced into E. colistrain DH10B by electroporation. Constructs were verified by sequencing and used to transform strain CY61–1D as described (25.Vernet T. Digard D. Thomas D.Y. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 52: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). E. coli cultures (50 ml) were grown to an A 600of 0.6–1 in LB medium (24.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) containing 100 μg ml−1ampicillin and 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (4000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C), washed in buffer A (100 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol), recentrifuged, frozen in liquid N2, and stored until extraction at −80 °C. Subsequent operations were at 0–10 °C. Cells were resuspended in buffer A (5 ml/50-ml culture) and broken by sonication; the extract was cleared by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 15 min) and used for enzyme assays directly or after desalting on PD-10 columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in buffer A. Extracts were routinely stored at −80 °C after freezing in liquid N2; this was shown not to affect HMT activity. Yeast extracts were prepared as described previously (26.Raymond R.K. Kastanos E.K. Appling D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 372: 300-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) using buffer A. Native molecular masses were estimated using a Waters 626 HPLC system equipped with a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech); reference proteins were cytochrome c, carbonic anhydrase, bovine serum albumin, and β-amylase. Protein was estimated by Bradford's method (29.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215653) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Unless otherwise indicated, assays were made under conditions in which substrates were saturating and product formation was proportional to enzyme level and time. The assays were modifications of that described by Mudd and Datko (3.Mudd S.H. Datko A.H. Plant Physiol. 1990; 93: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). SMM:HcyS-methyltransferase assays (final volume 50 μl) contained 20 mm Hepes-KOH buffer, pH 7.5, 2 mm DTT, 2 mm Hcy (or other methyl acceptor), 200 μm[35S]SMM (15–25 nCi/assay), and enzyme extract. AdoMet:Hcy S-methyltransferase assays were similar except that the final volume was 5 μl, and the Hepes-KOH concentration was raised to 200 mm (due to the H2SO4in the [methyl-14C]AdoMet preparation); except where noted, no unlabeled AdoMet was included. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min and stopped by adding 1 ml of ice-cold 1 mm Met solution. The diluted mixtures were applied to 0.5-ml columns of Dowex-50 (NH4+), which were washed with 6 ml of water; the effluent was mixed with 5 ml of scintillation fluid (Beckman Ready Gel) and counted. Assay blanks contained no methyl acceptor. The [35S]Met formed in SMM:Hcy methyltransferase assays was analyzed by TLC on silica gel G in methanol:acetone:HCl (90:10:4, v/v/v) before and after oxidation to the sulfoxide by treating with 30% H2O2 for 1 h at 24 °C. 13C-Labeled SMM was synthesized in a 1-ml reaction mixture containing 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 1 mmDTT, 10% glycerol, 1 μmol ofl-[U-13C5]Met, 1.5 μmol of AdoMet, and 10 picokatal of recombinant Arabidopsis MMT activity. After incubation for 16 h at 30 °C, the mixture was passed through 1-ml Dowex-1 (OH−) and BioRex-70 (H+) columns arranged in series. Met, AdoMet, and AdoHcy were retained by the Dowex-1 column; the [13C]SMM (yield = 0.39 μmol) was eluted from BioRex-70 with 5 ml of 1m HCl and lyophilized. The [13C]SMM was then used as a substrate for HMT. The 1-ml reaction mixtures contained 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 1 mmDTT, 10% glycerol, 0.39 μmol of [13C]SMM, 1.5 μmol of l-Hcy, and desalted E. coli extract containing 2 nanokatal of AtHMT-1 activity. After incubation for 4 h at 30 °C, the mixture was passed through 1-ml columns of Dowex-50 (NH4+) and Dowex-50 (H+) arranged in series. Residual SMM was retained on the first column; the [13C]Met product (yield = 0.35 μmol) was eluted from the second column with 5 ml of 6 m NH4OH and lyophilized. The [13C]Met was separated from peptidoglycan in the lyophilizate by extraction in 95% ethanol and dried in vacuo. The [13C]Met formed by the sequential action of MMT and HMT was analyzed on a FinniganMAT LQC (Thermoquest, San Jose, CA) mass spectrometer system. The source voltage was set at 3.5 kV and capillary voltage at 30 V; the capillary temperature was 22 °C. Background source pressure was ≈1.5 × 10−5 torr as read by an ion gauge. The sample flow rate was 10 μl min−1. The drying gas was N2. The LQC was scanned to 2000 atomic mass units. Spectra were acquired for 0.5 min. Samples were dissolved in 50 μl of water; 25 μl was injected into the mass spectrometer. Arabidopsis genomic DNA was isolated from leaves as described (30.Lassner M.W. Peterson P. Yoder J.I. Plant Mol. Biol. Rep. 1989; 7: 116-128Crossref Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Five-μg samples of the isolated DNA were digested, separated in 0.7% agarose gels, and transferred to supported nitrocellulose membrane (Nitropure, MSI) as described (24.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Blots were hybridized overnight at 58 °C in 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution, 1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, and 100 μg ml−1 sonicated salmon sperm DNA and washed at low stringency (1× SSC, 0.1% SDS, 37 °C). The probes were the full-length AtHMT-1 or -2 cDNAs and were labeled with32P by the random primer method. Radioactive bands were detected by autoradiography. BLAST searches using the amino acid sequence of E. coli YagD detected two sets of homologous Arabidopsis expressed sequence tags. Sequencing one insert from each set (GenBankTM accession numbers T46013 and H37463) established that they represent two distinct transcripts. The T46013 insert encodes a 326-residue (36.0 kDa) polypeptide, designated AtHMT-1. The H37463insert encodes only the C-terminal part of a polypeptide and so was used to isolate the corresponding full-length cDNA from anArabidopsis leaf library. This cDNA specifies a 333-residue (36.4 kDa) polypeptide, designated AtHMT-2. The deduced AtHMT-1 and -2 proteins are 55% identical to each other, 50 (AtHMT-1) or 68% (AtHMT-2) identical to Astragalus SeCysMT, and 24–41% identical to YagD and two yeast proteins, Ypl273w and Yll062c, that were shown to be HMTs while our work was in progress (Fig.2). 2D. Thomas, A. Becker, and Y. Surdin-Kerjan, personal communication.AtHMT-1 and -2 also share significant sequence identity (20–26%) with the N-terminal region of E. coliB12-dependent Met synthase and with mammalian betaine-Hcy methyltransferase (not shown). AtHMT-1 and -2 both have a GGCC zinc-binding motif near the C terminus, as well as a third conserved cysteine sited 65 residues upstream that may also be a zinc ligand (18.Peariso K. Goulding C.W. Huang S. Matthews R.G. Penner-Hahn J.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 8410-8416Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 19.Millian N.S. Garrow T.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 356: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Both AtHMT-1 and -2 appear to lack targeting sequences (e.g. chloroplast or mitochondrial transit peptides), indicating that they are cytosolic enzymes. The coding regions of AtHMT-1 and -2 were subcloned into pBluescript SK-. To express the HMTs as native proteins and not LacZ fusions, the coding sequences were preceded by a stop codon in frame with LacZ and a Shine-Delgarno sequence. These constructs were introduced into E. coli strain MTD123 (ΔyagD ΔmetE ΔmetH), which lacks Met synthase and HMT activity, and is consequently a Met auxotroph that cannot grow on SMM (16.Thanbichler M. Neuhierl B. Böck A. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 662-665Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both constructs enabled transformants to grow on SMM (Fig.3 A); no transformants grew on medium without SMM, indicating complementation of the yagDmutation and not the metE or metH mutations (not shown). No complementation was observed with the vector alone (Fig.3 A), and retransforming MTD123 with rescued plasmids containing the AtHMT-1 or -2 cDNAs restored the ability to grow on SMM, showing that the complementation is because of the encoded plant protein. HMT activity was readily detected in extracts of the complemented strains but not, as expected, in cells transformed with the vector alone (Fig. 3 B). The specific activity of AtHMT-1 was ≈10-fold higher than that of AtHMT-2; this difference was observed consistently in independent experiments. To authenticate the observed activities, the [35S]Met reaction products were verified by TLC (Fig. 3 C). We compared the ability of AtHMT-1 and -2 to catalyze methyl transfer froml-SMM to various thiols and related compounds, usingl-Hcy as the benchmark (TableI). Both enzymes utilizedd-Hcy, although AtHMT-1 showed a marked preference for the L form. A similar lack of stereospecificity toward Hcy has been noted for other HMTs (7.Neuhierl B. Thanbichler M.

Methods Enzymol. 1971; 17: 400-405Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). AtHMT-1 showed significant activity withl- and d-cysteine, which is noteworthy as cysteine is not a substrate for E. coli or yeast HMTs (7.Neuhierl B. Thanbichler M. Lottspeich F. Böck A. J. Biol.

To comparel-SMM and (S,S)-AdoMet as methyl donors, Michaelis constants and relative V max values were determined for both enzymes (TableII). (S,S)-AdoMet was found to be a methyl donor for both enzymes, but the K mvalues were higher than for l-SMM (67-fold for AtHMT-1 and 4.5-fold for AtHMT-2) and the V max values were lower. The (S,S)-[methyl-14C]AdoMet used in these experiments contained no detectable (≤1%)R,S diastereomer and, in the assay conditions used (pH 7.5, 30 min), ≤0.3% (R,S)-AdoMet is expected to form by racemization (15.Hoffman J.L.

https://openalex.org/W2067591369,"Regulatory exosite I of thrombin is present on prothrombin in a precursor state (proexosite I) that specifically binds the Tyr63-sulfated peptide, hirudin54–65(Hir54–65(SO3−)) and the nonsulfated analog. The role of proexosite I in the mechanism of factor Va acceleration of prothrombin activation was investigated in kinetic studies of the effects of peptide binding. The initial rate of human prothrombin activation by factor Xa was inhibited by the peptides in the presence of factor Va but not in the absence of the cofactor. Factor Xa and factor Va did not bind the peptide with significant affinity compared with prothrombin. Maximum inhibition reduced the factor Va-accelerated rate to a level indistinguishable from the rate in the absence of the cofactor. The effect of Hir54–65(SO3−) on the kinetics of prothrombin activation obeyed a model in which binding of the peptide to proexosite I prevented productive prothrombin interactions with the factor Xa-factor Va complex. Comparison of human and bovine prothrombin as substrates demonstrated a similar correlation between peptide binding and inhibition of factor Va acceleration. Inhibition of prothrombin activation by hirudin peptides was opposed by assembly on phospholipid vesicles of the membrane-bound factor Xa-factor-Va-prothrombin complex. Factor Va interactions of human and bovine prothrombin activation are concluded to share a common mechanism in which proexosite I participates in productive interactions of prothrombin as the substrate of the factor Xa-factor Va complex, possibly by directly mediating productive prothrombin-factor Va binding. Regulatory exosite I of thrombin is present on prothrombin in a precursor state (proexosite I) that specifically binds the Tyr63-sulfated peptide, hirudin54–65(Hir54–65(SO3−)) and the nonsulfated analog. The role of proexosite I in the mechanism of factor Va acceleration of prothrombin activation was investigated in kinetic studies of the effects of peptide binding. The initial rate of human prothrombin activation by factor Xa was inhibited by the peptides in the presence of factor Va but not in the absence of the cofactor. Factor Xa and factor Va did not bind the peptide with significant affinity compared with prothrombin. Maximum inhibition reduced the factor Va-accelerated rate to a level indistinguishable from the rate in the absence of the cofactor. The effect of Hir54–65(SO3−) on the kinetics of prothrombin activation obeyed a model in which binding of the peptide to proexosite I prevented productive prothrombin interactions with the factor Xa-factor Va complex. Comparison of human and bovine prothrombin as substrates demonstrated a similar correlation between peptide binding and inhibition of factor Va acceleration. Inhibition of prothrombin activation by hirudin peptides was opposed by assembly on phospholipid vesicles of the membrane-bound factor Xa-factor-Va-prothrombin complex. Factor Va interactions of human and bovine prothrombin activation are concluded to share a common mechanism in which proexosite I participates in productive interactions of prothrombin as the substrate of the factor Xa-factor Va complex, possibly by directly mediating productive prothrombin-factor Va binding.

CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1989: 160-187Google Scholar). In addition to activation of the catalytic site, prothrombin activation results in expression of regulatory exosites I and II on thrombin (3.Stubbs M.T. Bode W. Thromb. Res. 1993; 69: 1-58Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 4.Liu L-W. Ye J. Johnson A.E. Esmon C.T. J. Biol.

In the preceding paper, exosite I was shown to be present in a low affinity precursor state (proexosite I) on prothrombin, which binds hirudin54–65 peptide ligands specifically and undergoes an ∼100-fold increase in affinity on thrombin formation (6.Anderson P.J. Nesset A. Dharmawardana K.R. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16428-16434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The increased affinity of exosite I for hirudin peptides is thought to be expressed on conversion of prothrombin to either of the activation intermediates, prethrombin 2 and meizothrombin (4.Liu L-W. Ye J. Johnson A.E. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23633-23636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Once formed, exosites I and II play critical roles in regulating thrombin activity by mediating interactions with specific protein substrates, inhibitors, and regulatory proteins (3.Stubbs M.T. Bode W. Thromb. Res. 1993; 69: 1-58Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 7.Bode W. Turk D. Karshikov A.

Calcium ion, phospholipid membranes, and the protein cofactor, factor Va, regulate the prothrombin activation reactions through the assembly on phospholipid surfaces of a factor Xa-factor Va-prothrombin ternary complex, mediated by protein-protein and protein-membrane interactions (1.Mann K.G. Nesheim M.E. Church W.R. Haley P. Krishnaswamy S. Blood. 1990; 76: 1-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Rosing J. Tans G. Zwaal R.F.A. Coagulation and Lipids.

J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3708-3718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Compared with prothrombin activation by factor Xa alone, the rate is enhanced ∼300,000-fold by these interactions (1.Mann K.G. Nesheim M.E. Church W.R. Haley P. Krishnaswamy S. Blood. 1990; 76: 1-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Rosing J. Tans G. Zwaal R.F.A. Coagulation and Lipids. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1989: 160-187Google Scholar, 11.Nesheim M.E. Taswell J.B.

Chem. 1980; 255: 274-283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Kinetic studies indicate that phospholipid interactions are primarily responsible for a ∼100-fold decrease in the apparentK m for prothrombin activation, whereas the protein cofactor acts by increasing the apparent k catabout 3,000-fold (11.Nesheim M.E. Taswell J.B. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10952-10962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Rosing J. Tans G. Govers-Riemslag J.W.P. Zwaal R.F.A. Hemker H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 274-283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies of the reactions in the absence of phospholipid membranes show that the protein-protein interactions among factor Xa, factor Va, and prothrombin by themselves can account for the unique activity of factor Va to increase the apparent catalytic rate constant (13.Boskovic D.S. Giles A.R. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10497-10505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The role of prothrombin-factor Va, substrate-cofactor interactions in the mechanism of acceleration of prothrombin activation by factor Va is not completely understood, and the binding sites mediating these interactions have not been clearly established. Binding sites distinct from the catalytic site of factor Xa have been shown to be involved in specific recognition of the activation intermediate, prethrombin 2, by the factor Xa-factor Va-phospholipid complex (14.Betz A. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10709-10718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 15.Krishnaswamy S. Betz A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12080-12086Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), whereas prothrombin has not been similarly studied. Activation of prethrombin 2 is inhibited competitively by active site-blocked thrombin, indicating the presence of overlapping binding sites on the factor Xa-factor Va complex for this substrate and the product (14.Betz A. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10709-10718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 15.Krishnaswamy S. Betz A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12080-12086Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Exosite I is implicated in these interactions by the observation of selective inhibition of factor Va acceleration of prethrombin 2 activation by the exosite I-specific ligand, hirudin53–64 1 (4.Liu L-W. Ye J. Johnson A.E. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23633-23636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Betz A. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 10709-10718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Binding of prethrombin 2 and thrombin to the factor Xa-factor Va complex is thought to occur through exosites on factor Xa rather than with sites on factor Va (14.Betz A. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10709-10718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 16.Krishnaswamy S. Walker R.K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3319-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Recent studies characterizing thrombin binding to factor Va (17.Dharmawardana K.R. Bock P.E.

The additional observations that (a) thrombin binding to factor Va is mediated by exosite I, (b) thrombin (17.Dharmawardana K.R. Bock P.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13143-13152Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 18.Dharmawardana K.R. Olson S.T. Bock P.E. J. Biol.

Nesset A. Dharmawardana K.R. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16428-16434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) suggest a common mode of prothrombin and thrombin binding to sites on the heavy chain of factor Va through proexosite I and exosite I (18.Dharmawardana K.R. Olson S.T. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18635-18643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, the fragment 2 domain of prothrombin has also been implicated in binding to factor Va from its accelerating effects on prethrombin 2 activation (21.Esmon C.T. Jackson C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7791-7797Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion of the fragment 2 domain of human prothrombin inhibits prothrombin activation in the presence of factor Va only partially, suggesting a role for fragment 2-independent interactions (22.Kotkow K.J. Deitcher S.R. Furie B. Furie B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4551-4557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In support of this, activation of prethrombin 2 was shown recently to be accelerated greatly by factor Va in the absence of fragment 2, demonstrating that sites within the prothrombin catalytic domain and independent of fragment 2 contribute to factor Va acceleration (16.Krishnaswamy S. Walker R.K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3319-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Together, these observations suggest that in addition to a possible role for fragment 2 in productive prothrombin-factor Va interactions, substrate recognition by the factor Xa-factor Va complex may involve interactions of factor Va with proexosite I and exosite I on prothrombin, the activation intermediates, and the reaction product. The novel characterization of proexosite I on prothrombin as a specific binding site for hirudin peptides prompted the present investigation of the role of this site in factor Va activity (6.Anderson P.J. Nesset A. Dharmawardana K.R. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16428-16434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Kinetic studies described here of the effect of Tyr63-sulfated hirudin54–65(Hir54–65(SO3−)) and the nonsulfated peptide (Hir54–65) as probes of proexosite I demonstrated that acceleration of prothrombin activation by factor Va was selectively inhibited, with no significant effect of the peptides on prothrombin activation catalyzed by factor Xa alone. Comparison of human and bovine prothrombin as substrates demonstrated that a common mechanism involving proexosite I regulates the reactions. The effect of Hir54–65(SO3−) on the kinetics of prothrombin activation followed a mechanism in which the peptide bound exclusively to proexosite I of prothrombin, and the prothrombin-Hir54–65(SO3−) complex did not interact productively with the factor Xa-factor Va complex but was an equivalent substrate of factor Xa alone. Assembly of the factor Xa-factor Va-prothrombin complex on phospholipid membrane vesicles counteracted inhibition by Hir54–65(SO3−). The results show that proexosite I plays a major role in macromolecular substrate recognition by the factor Xa-factor Va complex, possibly by directly mediating productive protein-protein interactions between factor Va and prothrombin. Human prothrombin, thrombin, and hirudin peptides were obtained and characterized as described in the preceding paper (6.Anderson P.J. Nesset A. Dharmawardana K.R. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16428-16434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Human prethrombin 1, factor Xa, and factor Va were prepared and characterized by the published methods (17.Dharmawardana K.R. Bock P.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13143-13152Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 23.Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14963-14973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Bock P.E. Craig P.A.

Bovine prothrombin, thrombin, and factor Va were purchased from Hematologic Technologies. 1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine (DOPS) and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids. Small unilamellar vesicles of 95%, 5% (w/w), or 75% DOPC, 25% DOPS were prepared by sonication and differential ultracentrifugation (25.Barenholz Y. Gibbes B.J. Litman B.J. Goll J. Thompson T.E. Carlson F.D. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 2806-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). Briefly, 11–15 mg of phospholipids in chloroform were dried with a stream of N2and lyophilized. Lipids were resuspended in 7 ml of 50 mmHepes, 0.125 m NaCl, pH 7.4, at 37 °C and vortexed for 10 min. The suspension was sonicated with a Branson Sonifier 250 at an output control of 3 and duty cycle of 30% for 60 min in an ice bath under a constant stream of N2. The vesicle preparation was centrifuged in a TLS-55 swinging bucket rotor at 100,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C, followed by 159,000 ×g for 4 h in a Beckman TL-100 ultracentrifuge. The top 20% of the volume of each tube (400 μl) was separated into aliquots in glass vials, purged with N2, and stored at 4 °C. Phospholipid concentration was determined by colorimetric assay based on complex formation with ammonium ferrothiocyanate using a mixture of DOPC and DOPS in chloroform as the standard (26.Stewart J.C.M. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 104: 10-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar, 27.New R.R.C. New R.R.C. Liposomes, A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1990: 108-109Google Scholar). Negative-stain electron microscopy showed that the preparations were mostly single bilayer vesicles of 400 ± 100 Å with some small membrane fragments present. Affinity chromatography on Hir54–65(SO3−)-agarose and a control matrix lacking the peptide was performed as described in the previous paper (6.Anderson P.J. Nesset A. Dharmawardana K.R. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16428-16434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Factor Xa was inactivated by incubation with a 2.7-fold excess of d-Phe-Pro-Arg-CH2Cl, and excess inhibitor was removed by dialysis. Factor Xa (4.8 μm) and factor Va (1.0 μm) were preincubated with 1 μmd-Phe-Pro-Arg-CH2Cl at 25 °C for 30 min before chromatography of 300-μl samples on 2.7-ml affinity columns. The elution profiles of the proteins were measured as described before for the affinity matrix in the absence and presence of 1–2m NaCl and for the control matrix lacking the peptide (6.Anderson P.J. Nesset A. Dharmawardana K.R. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16428-16434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Initial rates of prothrombin activation by factor Xa in the presence and absence of factor Va and phospholipid were measured by discontinuous assay of the thrombin formed, determined from the increase in the initial rate of hydrolysis of 100 μmd-Phe-Pip-Arg-p-nitroanilide (where Pip is pipecolic acid) at 405 nm. Reaction mixtures containing prothrombin, factor Va, and various concentrations of hirudin peptides in 50 mm Hepes, 0.11 m NaCl, 5 mmCaCl2, 1 mg/ml polyethylene glycol 8000, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4, were equilibrated at 25 °C for 10 min before initiation of the reactions by the addition of factor Xa. Reactions started by the addition of prothrombin and those started with factor Xa gave identical results. At various times, 5–10-μl aliquots of the reaction mixtures were quenched by dilution with 0.1 volume of 50 mm Hepes, 0.125 m NaCl, 150 mmEDTA, 1 mg/ml polyethylene glycol 8000, 1 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (type IS) (Sigma), pH 8.2, to give a final pH of 7.4. Quenched samples were assayed in 96-well microtiter plates that had been coated with polyethylene glycol 20,000 to minimize protein adsorption. Control experiments demonstrated that quenching of the reactions was instantaneous. The addition of factor Xa to a mixture of prothrombin and factor Va in an EDTA and soybean trypsin inhibitor-quenched buffer mixture did not produce any measurable activity. Thrombin chromogenic substrate activity in the quenched samples was stable for at least 2 h. Thrombin concentrations were determined by comparison of the measured initial rate to the rates for known concentrations of thrombin under identical solution conditions, including matched concentrations of the hirudin peptides. This was necessary to correct the rates for the effect of the peptides on thrombin activity, which amounted to an increase of 30 ± 8% by Hir54–65(SO3−) and 15 ± 12% by Hir54–65 at 100 μm chromogenic substrate. Plots of the concentration of thrombin formed with time for at least two reactions in which <8% prothrombin was consumed were fit by a straight line to obtain the initial rate. Reactions in the presence of 95% DOPC, 5% DOPS phospholipid vesicles were performed similarly at 1 or 10 nm factor Xa, 50 μmphospholipid in the absence and presence of 10 pm or 5 nm factor Va and various concentrations of Hir54–65(SO3−), as indicated. The mixtures were preincubated at 25 °C for 10 min before initiation of the reactions by the addition of 100 nmprothrombin. The observed initial rate of prothrombin activation (v obs) by factor Xa in the presence and absence of factor Va was represented by the sum of the factor Va-accelerated (v Va) and unaccelerated (v u) rates as shown in Equation 1. vobs=vVa+vuEquation 1 Previous studies of the mechanism of bovine prothrombin activation in the absence of phospholipid support a mechanism in which factor Xa, factor Va, and prothrombin form a highly productive, factor Xa-factor Va-prothrombin ternary complex through factor Xa-factor Va and prothrombin-factor Va interactions (13.Boskovic D.S. Giles A.R. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10497-10505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In those studies, the uncatalyzed activation of prothrombin by factor Xa alone was concluded to not contribute significantly to the interactions of ternary complex formation. The present studies were analyzed according to similar simplifying cases derived from the general ternary complex mechanism in which all three possible binary complexes and one ternary complex can be formed, and the uncatalyzed reaction is included as shown in SchemeFSI. This mechanism contains the model concluded in previous studies to describe the kinetics of bovine prothrombin activation (13.Boskovic D.S. Giles A.R. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10497-10505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The initial velocity of thrombin (T) formation for the ternary complex model in terms of the total factor Xa concentration ([Xa]o), the free concentrations of prothrombin ([Pro]) and factor Va ([Va]), and the dissociation constants for the factor Xa (X), factor Va (V), and prothrombin (P) binary and ternary complexes is given by Equation 2(28.Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics: Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-state Enzyme Systems. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1975: 258-263Google Scholar). vobs[X a] o=βkc[V a][Pro]KX,VKXV,P+kc[Pro]KX,P1+[Pro]KX,P+[V a]KX,V+[Pro][V a]KXV,PEquation 2 The first term represents the factor Va-accelerated reaction (v Va), and the second term represents the uncatalyzed reaction (v u). The K mfor the activation of prothrombin by factor Xa alone is very large (12.Rosing J. Tans G. Govers-Riemslag J.W.P. Zwaal R.F.A. Hemker H.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1990; 265: 10497-10505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), such that [Pro]/K X,P in the denominator of Equation 2 was much smaller than the sum of the other terms. Under the experimental conditions used, the factor Va concentration was also well below the dissociation constant for factor Xa binding to factor Va (13.Boskovic D.S. Giles A.R. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10497-10505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,29.Pryzdial E.L.G. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8969-8977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as indicated by the linear dependence of the rate on factor Va concentration, allowing [Va]/K X,V to also be eliminated. Making these simplifying assumptions in Equation 2 and rearranging gave Equation 3. vobs[X a] o=βkc[Pro][V a] oKVP,X+[V a] oKX,VKXV,PKVP,X+[V a] o+[Pro]+kc[Pro]KX,P 1+[Pro]KP,V1+[Pro]KX,VKXV,PKVP,X+[V a] oEquation 3 The first term is in Michaelis-Menten form and represents a hyperbolic increase in the factor Va-catalyzed reaction rate with increasing prothrombin concentration, characterized by an apparentK m (K m,app) and an apparent catalytic rate constant for prothrombin activation by the factor Xa-factor Va complex (k Va). Both of these parameters are functions of factor Va concentration, as shown by Equations 4 and 5. Km,app=KX,VKXV,PKVP,X+[V a] oEquation 4 kVa=βkc[V a] oKVP,X+[V a] oEquation 5 K m,app may decrease with increasing total factor Va concentration ([Va]o), whereask Va increases, which reproduces by the model the well established effect of factor Va to enhance the apparent catalytic rate constant for prothrombin activation (11.Nesheim M.E. Taswell J.B. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10952-10962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Rosing J. Tans G. Govers-Riemslag J.W.P. Zwaal R.F.A. Hemker H.C. J. Biol.

If the additional assumption was made that [Va]o ≪ K VP,Xin Equation 4, K m,app was equal toK V,P. This was consistent with the outcome of a previous analysis of a ternary complex mechanism for bovine prothrombin activation, which concluded that K m,apprepresented prothrombin interactions with factor Va under these reaction conditions (13.Boskovic D.S. Giles A.R. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10497-10505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The factor in parentheses in the uncatalyzed reaction term of Equation 3 can be approximated as unity under the experimental conditions used in the present studies, whereK m,app ≈ K P,V. As will be shown, the uncatalyzed rate was slow, and the consequences of this approximation were negligible. That all of these conditions applied was supported by the linear dependence of the rate on factor Va concentration at high concentrations of prothrombin. The behavior of the ternary complex model under the simplifying conditions used here was verified by the results of computer simulation, in which the expressions for the dissociation constants, conservation equations, and velocity equation were solved simultaneously. On the basis of the results showing selective inhibition of the factor Va-accelerated rate, inhibition by the hirudin peptides was analyzed with the assumption that only free prothrombin and not the prothrombin-peptide complex participated in the factor Va-dependent reaction, but that the free and bound prothrombin were equivalent in the uncatalyzed reaction.

The concentration of the complex was calculated with the quadratic binding equation (Equation 8), assuming that the concentrations of prothrombin in complexes with factor Xa and factor Va were small enough to be neglected under the experimental conditions where [Pro]o ≫ [Xa]o, [Va]o.

The stoichiometric factor (n) for peptide binding was fixed at one. The reactions were also studied as a function of peptide concentration at levels of factor Xa, factor Va, and prothrombin all below saturation.

Nonlinear least squares analysis was performed with Scientist software. All estimates of error represent ± 2 S.D. To assess the specificity of hirudin peptide binding for prothrombin, the possibility of interactions of the peptide with factor Xa or factor Va was first tested by affinity chromatography on Hir54–65(SO3−)-agarose. As shown previously (6.Anderson P.J. Nesset A. Dharmawardana K.R. Bock P.E. J. Biol.

By contrast, factor Va and factor Xa both eluted in essentially the same volume as the void volume of either the peptide matrix or the control matrix lacking the peptide (Fig. 1, B and C). Elution of factor Xa and factor Va from the peptide matrix was not significantly affected by buffer containing 2 m NaCl. Recovery of the proteins in these experiments was 73–104%, indicating that the proteins behaved homogeneously. These results indicated that Hir54–65(SO3−) bound to human prothrombin with highest"

These changes are governed by the isomerization of a non-proline peptide bond, Ala-207–Asp-208, positioned in a β-strand in between the calcium binding site S2 and the carbohydrate specificity-determining loop. The replacement of calcium by manganese allowed us to investigate the structures of the carbohydrate binding, locked state and the inactive, unlocked state of concanavalin A, both with and without metal ions bound. Crystals of unlocked metal-free concanavalin A convert to the locked form with the binding of two Mn2+ ions. Removal of these ions from the crystals traps metal-free concanavalin A in its locked state, a minority species in solution. The ligation of a metal ion in S2 to unlocked concanavalin A causes bending of the β-strand foregoing the S2 ligand residues Asp-10 and Tyr-12. This bending disrupts conventional β-sheet hydrogen bonding and forces the Thr-11 side chain against the Ala-207–Asp-208 peptide bond. The steric strain exerted by Thr-11 is presumed to drive thetrans-to-cis isomerization. Upon isomerization, Asp-208 flips into its carbohydrate binding position, and the conformation of the carbohydrate specificity determining loop changes dramatically.

Upon isomerization, Asp-208 flips into its carbohydrate binding position, and the conformation of the carbohydrate specificity determining loop changes dramatically. concanavalin A Locked state unlocked state Lectins are a structurally very diverse class of proteins that bind carbohydrates with considerable specificity but moderate affinities (1.Lis H. Sharon N. Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 637-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1656) Google Scholar). Their ability to bind carbohydrates often depends on the binding of metal ions that mediate with the carbohydrate directly (the Ca2+-dependent animal lectins (2.Drickamer K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 612-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar)) or indirectly (lectins from the Leguminosae family). Leguminosae lectins form a large family of plant lectins that succeed in covering a broad range of fine specificity toward oligosaccharides through subtle variations in length and sequence of five different loops A-E (3.Loris R. Hamelryck T. Bouckaert J. Wyns L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1383: 9-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 4.Sharma V. Surolia A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 433-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 5.Young N.M. Oomen R.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 924-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). All Leguminosae lectins share the need for transition metal ion and calcium binding to stabilize the active conformation of these loops. The five amino acids involved in metal binding are fully conserved. These are a histidine (His-24 in ConA1) and a glutamate (Glu-8 in ConA) for the transition metal ion binding site S1, an asparagine for the calcium binding site S2 (Asn-14 in ConA), and two aspartate residues (Asp-10 and Asp-19 in ConA) bridging S1 and S2 by their carboxylate groups. All these five amino acids originate from two β-strands and their connecting metal binding loop (see Fig.2). Carbohydrate binding by Leguminosae lectins also involves a number of conserved residues. The monosaccharide binding site contains an Asn, Asp, Gly/Arg triad, originating from three loops: the metal binding loop C, loop A that follows the conserved cis peptide, and loop B, respectively. The conserved asparagine (Asn-14 in ConA) of the triad binds carbohydrate via its amide nitrogen but also ligates calcium through its amide oxygen. The aspartate (Asp-208 in ConA) is involved in a conserved non-proline cis-peptide bond that is in turn stabilized by calcium binding in S2. The third member of the conserved triad (Arg-228 in ConA) interacts both with the carbohydrate and via a water molecule with the metal ion in S2. Furthermore, an aromatic residue in the metal binding loop is essential for carbohydrate binding. On the other hand, the carbohydrate binding residues in the carbohydrate specificity-determining loop, or monosaccharide specificity-determining loop D, and loop E (3.Loris R. Hamelryck T. Bouckaert J. Wyns L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1383: 9-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 4.Sharma V. Surolia A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 433-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 5.Young N.M. Oomen R.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 924-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) are not conserved. Neither are they involved in metal binding. All Leguminosae lectins are, thus, in the same way dependent on metal ion binding. Therefore the mechanism by which metal ion binding establishes the minimal structural requirements for carbohydrate binding merits a better understanding. Most studies have focused on the metal binding properties of Con A, because demetallization of ConA is reversible, in contrast to most other Leguminosae lectins. Demetallization of other closely related leguminous lectins such as lentil and pea lectin is often irreversible and leads to precipitation of these proteins (6.Paulova M. Ticha M. Entlicher G. Kostir J.V. Kocourek J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 252: 388-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). As a consequence, ConA is the only family member for which crystal structures of its metal-free and partially metallized forms have been analyzed (7.Bouckaert J. Loris R. Poortmans F. Wyns L. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1995; 23: 510-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar,8.Bouckaert J. Poortmans F. Wyns L. Loris R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16144-16150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The binding of metal ions to ConA occurs at two adjacent sites located at the top of the dome-shaped molecule (Fig.1). In its native state, ConA binds a transition metal ion in site S1 and a calcium ion in site S2. The transition metal binding site (S1) of ConA preferentially binds Mn2+ but can also accommodate Ni2+, Co2+ (9.Emmerich C. Helliwell J.R. Redshaw M. Naismith J.H. Harrop S.J. Raftery J.

Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1993; 49: 561-571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or even Ca2+ (11.Koenig S.H. Brewer C.F. Brown III, R.D. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4251-4260Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 12.Brewer C.F. Brown III, R.D. Koenig S.H. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3691-3702Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The S2 site is at 4.16 Å from S1 and binds Ca2+ but can also accommodate Cd2+ or Mn2+ (13.Marchetti P.S. Bhattacharyya L. Ellis P.D. Brewer C.F. J. Magn. Reson. 1988; 80: 417-426Google Scholar). Metal binding by ConA and the properties of the corresponding molecular species in solution have been studied in detail by Brewer et al. (for a review, see Ref. 14.Brewer C.F. Brown III, R.D. Koenig S.H. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 1983; 1: 961-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Early nuclear magnetic resonance dispersion experiments indicated a high energy barrier (about 22 kcalm−1) separating the two conformers of ConA (15.Brown III., R.D. Brewer C.F. Koenig S.H. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 3883-3896Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). This high energy barrier and the consequently long equilibration times for the conformational change were attributed to the isomerization of the peptide bond between Ala-207 and Asp-208. Breweret al. (14.Brewer C.F. Brown III, R.D. Koenig S.H. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 1983; 1: 961-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) conclude that ConA occurs in essentially two conformational states, which they called the locked, containing thecis peptide, and the unlocked state, containing a usualtrans peptide. Both states are in equilibrium with each other, but the equilibrium constant depends on the presence or absence of metal ions. In the absence of any metal ions, the dominant species is the unlocked state. In the presence of specific metal ions, the conformational equilibrium shifts completely toward the locked state. The locked, metal-bound form of ConA corresponds to the native Mn2+- and Ca2+-bound ConA as it is observed in its carbohydrate-free form as well as in a number of carbohydrate complexes. We set out to characterize by x-ray crystallography the different species on the metal binding pathways that have been observed in solution (Scheme FS1, according to Breweret al. (14.Brewer C.F. Brown III, R.D. Koenig S.H. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 1983; 1: 961-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar)) and to follow metal ion binding and conformational conversions in the crystalline state (SchemeFS2). To do so, we made use of the observation that Mn2+ can functionally replace Ca2+ (14.Brewer C.F. Brown III, R.D. Koenig S.H. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 1983; 1: 961-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 15.Brown III., R.D. Brewer C.F. Koenig S.H. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 3883-3896Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In the absence of Ca2+, Mn2+ binds to S2. Mn2+ in the S2 site has a much larger dissociation constant (K d = 25 μm at pH 6.4) than Ca2+(K d = 0.3 μm at pH 6.0) and is in rapid equilibrium with the solvent (11.Koenig S.H. Brewer C.F. Brown III, R.D. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4251-4260Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). As such, it can be much more easily extracted from the protein. Equally important for our work was the observation that when Mn2+ is used as a replacement for Ca2+, the conversion from the unlocked to the locked form is slowed down significantly, occurring on a time scale of hours or even days (at 5 °C) instead of minutes (14.Brewer C.F. Brown III, R.D. Koenig S.H. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 1983; 1: 961-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This allowed us to collect x-ray data on intermediates that occur only transiently or as minority species in solution.Figure FS2Soaking and co-recrystallization experiments to obtain the crystals used in this study. The subscripts sol and cryst stand for protein in solution and protein in single crystals, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) ConA was purified, demetallized, and crystallized as described previously (7.Bouckaert J. Loris R. Poortmans F. Wyns L. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1995; 23: 510-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). One crystal of the resulting metal-free ConA in the unlocked form (U ConA) was used to collect a 2.05-Å resolution data set on beam line BW7B of the DESY synchrotron, Hamburg, Germany. These data were merged with low resolution data previously collected on our home source (7.Bouckaert J. Loris R. Poortmans F. Wyns L. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1995; 23: 510-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). UMn ConA was produced by soaking a single crystal of U ConA for 1 h in the mother liquor to which 7 mm MnCl2 had been added. The crystal was subsequently mounted, and data were collected immediately after, using a rotating anode generator. To prepare LMnMn ConA, crystals of metal-free ConA were soaked for 3 h in 60 μl of the mother liquor at pH 5 with the addition of 5 mm of Mn2+, resulting in LMnMnpH5.0 ConA. The crystals were then mounted in borosilicate capillaries and stored at 4 °C for at least 2 weeks. Crystals of LMnMn ConA were also produced by co-crystallization of metal-free ConA and Mn2+, resulting in LMnMnpH7.0 ConA. These crystals were grown in sitting drops of 75 μl composed of 20 μl of 17.3 mg/ml metal-free ConA, 50 μl of reservoir solution (2 m(NH4)2SO4, 60 mmCH3COONa, and 3% polyethylene glycol 5000 monomethyl ether, at pH 7), and 5 μl of 8 mm MnCl2, equilibrated against the precipitant solution. Isomorphous crystals of LMnCa ConA were produced under identical conditions as for LMnMnpH7.0 ConA, except that CaCl2 was also added. We found that L ConA could be produced after soaking crystals of LMnMn ConA in EDTA-saturated crystallization mother liquor. The mother liquor contained 2.1 m(NH4)2SO4 and 120 mmsodium acetate at pH 7.0 and was batch-treated with Chelex-100. The soaking solutions was refreshed several times to ensure a complete dialysis of Mn2+ out of the crystal and into the surrounding liquor. Data were collected for different soaking times ranging from 1 h to several months, as well as for different pH values of the soaking solution, decreased in steps of 0.2 from 7.0 to 5.0 with the acetate buffer. No significant differences were observed among this set of structures. Our studies showed that space group I222 was maintained under all conditions, even at pH 5.0. Crystals of L ConA produced after an EDTA soak of 2 months were further soaked in the mother liquor containing 100 mm calcium. Data were again collected on this LCaCa ConA crystal. All crystals were mounted in borosilicate capillaries. All tools that were used to manipulate crystals were washed extensively in deionized water and treated in batch with Chelex-100 beads before use to prevent any contamination of the protein with trace metals. After data collection, the metal content of every crystal was checked on a scanning electron microscope with an energy-dispersive x-ray analyzer to ensure the presence of the required metal ions and the absence of undesired ones. An anomalous data analysis has been performed on LMnMnpH7.0ConA crystals. In the case of U ConA, synchrotron radiation was used (beam line BW7B of the DESY synchrotron), whereas all other data were collected using a Rigaku RU200 rotating anode CuKαradiation. All regular data were collected using a MAR image plate detector data, integrated using DENZO, and scaled using SCALEPACK (16.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar), with the exception of the data of LMnMnpH5.0 ConA collected on a FAST detector and processed using MADNESS. The anomalous data of LMnMn ConA were scaled using SCALA (17.Evans P.R. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EACBM Newsletter. 1997; 33: 22-24Google Scholar) and subsequently scaled and merged using ROTAVATA and AGROVATA (18.SERC Daresbury LaboratoryActa Crystallogr. Sec.

Starting coordinates for refinement were the 2.5-Å structure of metal-free ConA (Protein Data Bank code 1apn (7.Bouckaert J. Loris R. Poortmans F. Wyns L. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1995; 23: 510-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar)) for the unlocked structures and the 1.85-Å structure of LZnCa ConA at pH 7.1 (Protein Data Bank code 1enr (8.Bouckaert J. Poortmans F. Wyns L. Loris R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16144-16150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar)) for the locked structures. Except for LMnMnpH5.0 ConA, which was refined earlier, the refinement was started with a high temperature (3000 K) slow-cool stage to remove model bias and to uncouple the crystallographic R-factor and the R-free factor. The refinement was evaluated by cross-validation usingR-free (21.Brünger A.T. Method Enzymol. 1996; 277: 366-396Crossref Scopus (276) Google Scholar), and a bulk solvent correction was applied and updated throughout the refinement. For the addition of the metal ions, no metal-ligand bond distance restraints were employed, and the metal ions were given no charge. Water molecules were added only if 1) the water had at least one hydrogen bonding partner, 2) the positive difference density level was higher than 3 ς, and 3) the electron density of the putative water re-appeared after refinement in the 2F o − F c map at a level of at least 1 ς. The final refinement statistics are shown in Table I. To confirm the nature of the bound metal ions and to ensure that the sample was not contaminated by trace amounts of, mainly, calcium during crystallization or crystal handling, the identity of the metal ions in the co-crystals of LMnMn ConA was evaluated by means of anomalous dispersion of the Mn2+ions. Identification of the metal ions was a prerequisite to prove the substitution of manganese for calcium, since no distinction can be made between Ca2+ (18 electrons) and Mn2+ (23 electrons) on the basis of the electron density. Manganese has its K-absorption edge at the x-ray wavelength of 1.896 Å. The anomalous dispersion experiment was performed, however, at the wavelength of 1.5418 Å of Cu Kα radiation, widely used in laboratory x-ray sources, in combination with a MAR area detector. Data of LMnMnpH7.0 ConA were collected using the inverse beam strategy, and Bijvoet mates were treated separately to calculate anomalous-difference Patterson and Fourier maps. An anomalous-difference Patterson map has been calculated with the subroutine HASSP of the program HEAVY (22.Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1994; 50: 17-23Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by means of single atom, two atoms, and cross-peak searches. Starting from crystals of metal-free or U ConA, we attempted to produce and characterize by x-ray crystallography the different metal-bound and metal-free species observed by Breweret al. (14.Brewer C.F. Brown III, R.D. Koenig S.H. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 1983; 1: 961-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) in solution (Scheme FS1). The ConA species that could be produced by a successive number of experiments involving the addition or removal of metal ions from crystals of ConA are shown in Scheme FS2. The statistics for the data collection and refinement of each of these crystals are summarized in TableI. In the case of the UMn ConA, data to only 2.9 Å could be collected because of the transient nature of this species, which spontaneously converts to LMnMn ConA. Therefore, short data collection times were necessary, although UMn ConA crystals diffract only weakly. It was not possible to flash-freeze the UMn ConA crystals, as earlier freezing experiments had already indicated that this inevitably leads to contamination with Ca2+. Consequently all crystals were exposed to x-rays at room temperature. Crucial to the isolation of the transient intermediate UMn ConA was the use of Mn2+ as a substitute for Ca2+ in S2; first, because the addition of both Mn2+ and Ca2+ to U ConA crystals results in cracking of the crystals, and second, because the binding of Mn2+ instead of Ca2+ in S2 decreases the time constant of the locking process from about 1 min to 0.5 h in solution at 25 °C (14.Brewer C.F.

A third advantage of using only Mn2+ is that Mn2+ can be extracted from the LMnMn ConA crystals due to the weak binding of Mn2+ to S2 (Scheme FS1). This allowed the production of crystals of L ConA, which occurs only as a minor species in solution (14.Brewer C.F. Brown III, R.D. Koenig S.H. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 1983; 1: 961-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) (Scheme FS2). The crystal structure of metal-free ConA (also called apo-ConA or demetallized ConA) has recently been described by us at a resolution of 2.5 Å (7.Bouckaert J. Loris R. Poortmans F. Wyns L. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1995; 23: 510-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To obtain a more detailed picture of this conformational state of ConA, we used synchrotron radiation to collect data to 2.05 Å, the maximum resolution observed on beam line BW7B of the DESY synchrotron. The structure corresponds to the predominant unlocked species or U ConA found in solution and confirms the results of our previous studies on metal-free ConA. As in the earlier 2.5-Å resolution structure, the disordered metal binding loop Pro-13–Tyr-22 is not visible in the electron density map. Soaking of crystals of U ConA with MnCl2 initially leads to the binding of a single Mn2+ ion in the S1 site if the soaking time is sufficiently short and data are collected immediately afterward. The structure of the UMn ConA complex is essentially identical to those in UZn ConA and UCo ConA that were obtained in the same way and that have been described in detail before (8.Bouckaert J. Poortmans F. Wyns L. Loris R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16144-16150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Changes compared with U ConA are minor and restricted to the metal binding sites. In contrast to UZn and UCo ConA, UMn ConA is not a stable entity. In the time course of 2 weeks at 4 °C, it spontaneously converts to LMnMn ConA. UMn ConA also contains an extra Mn2+ ion bound to Asp-80 and Asp-82 at a crystal lattice contact. This binding site has not been observed in any ConA structure before, but is not considered to be of functional importance. When crystals of U ConA (space group P21212;a ≈ 60 Å, b ≈ 85 Å,c ≈ 91 Å) are soaked with MnCl2 for a longer period of time, they go through a disordered phase showing blurred reflections. After 2 weeks, the diffraction quality of the crystals has improved dramatically, and their space group and unit cell have changed to those of the native crystal form of ConA (I222;a ≈ 63 Å, b ≈ 87 Å,c ≈ 89 Å). During this transition, the ConA tetramers in the unit cell have rotated 14° relative to each other, and ConA has transformed from the unlocked to the locked form, with Mn2+ ions bound in both sites S1 and S2. The structural changes corresponding to locking are complex and involve thetrans-to-cis isomerization of the crucial Ala-207–Asp-208 peptide bond and the structural reorganization of a large portion of the protein (7.Bouckaert J. Loris R. Poortmans F. Wyns L. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1995; 23: 510-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The resulting structure, LMnMnpH5.0 ConA, is virtually identical to that of LMnCa ConA. The acidity of the crystallization solution did not prevent locking and allowed the conversion to space group I222. The conformation of the metal binding loop Pro-13–Tyr-22 and of the monosaccharide specificity loop Thr-97–Glu-102 loop are thus largely pH-independent in the presence of an excess of specific metal ions. LMnMn ConA that was prepared in solution from U ConA could also be crystallized at pH 7. LMnMnpH7.0 ConA is isomorphous with LMnMnpH5.0 ConA obtained by soaking of U ConA crystals. Therefore we can conclude that the transformation from unlocked to locked in the crystal is identical to that in solution. When we compare LMnMn ConA with LMnCa ConA, only minor distortions were found in the direct neighborhood of the metal ions (TableII). Equally at pH 5 or pH 7, we found slightly larger metal-ligand distances and a significantly larger intermetal distance. These are in agreement with a poorer stabilization of the metal binding sites and the larger dissociation constant of Mn2+ from the S2 site (Scheme FS1 (11.Koenig S.H. Brewer C.F. Brown III, R.D. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4251-4260Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar)). In the structure at pH 5, the temperature factor of Mn2+ at S2 is slightly higher than at S1, whereas in all other fully metal-bound ConA structures close to pH 7, the opposite is true (Table II). This is probably due to the lower binding constant of Mn2+ in S2 at pH 5 compared with at pH 7.Table IIMetal ligand distances (Å) at S1 and S2 and comparison with LMnCa ConA (37.Weisgerber S.

The inhibitor was purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography and gel filtration, followed by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography. The active inhibitor has an apparent molecular mass of about 34 kDa by gel filtration and by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis without prior boiling of the sample. Boiling in 2.5% SDS or incubation in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride resulted in a single band of 17 kDa, indicating homodimer composition with no intersubunit disulfide bonds.

Its isoelectric point is 4.4, and sugar analysis indicates the absence of carbohydrate. A single protein sequence of 150 amino acids, containing no cysteine or methionine residues, was obtained by amino acid sequencing. The calculated molecular mass of 16854 Da corresponds well with the value obtained by mass spectrometry. A major part of this sequence was verified by molecular cloning.

Fungi (Mycophyta) have been used for religious, medical, and other purposes since ancient times. To our knowledge, no protein cysteine proteinase inhibitors have been characterized in higher fungi (Basydiomyceta), popularly called mushrooms. We report here the identification, some properties, and cloning of a new proteinaceous cysteine proteinase inhibitor fromClitocybe nebularis fruit bodies, which we have called clitocypin, a member of what is very likely a new structural superfamily of cysteine proteinase inhibitors. Edible mushrooms, C. nebularis, were collected in their natural habitat in a forest in November and frozen at −20 or −70 °C until use. A specimen is deposited at the Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Ljubljana. Iodoacetate and benzoyl-Arg-2-naphthylamide were from Sigma (Germany); CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B and Sephacryl S-200 were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Z-Phe-Arg-MCA1 and Z-Arg-Arg-MCA were from Bachem (Switzerland). Ep-475 was purchased from Peptide Research Foundation (Japan). Stem bromelain (EC 3.4.22.32), bovine trypsin (EC 3.4.21.4), and porcine pepsin (3.4.23.1) were from Sigma (Germany). Papain (EC3.4.22.2) 2× crystallized, also from Sigma, was additionally purified by affinity chromatography (17.Blumberg S. Schechter I. Berger A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 15: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Glycyl endopeptidase (EC 3.4.22.25) was a gift from Dr. Alan J. Barrett (The Babraham Institute, Cambridge, United Kingdom) and was prepared as described (18.Buttle D.J. Ritonja A. Pearl L.H. Turk V. Barrett A.J. FEBS Lett. 1990; 260: 195-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Endoproteinase Lys-C (EC 3.4.21.50) was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. β-Trypsin (EC 3.4.21.4) was prepared from type IX trypsin (Sigma) as described (19.Strop P Cechova D. J. Chromatogr. 1981; 207: 55-62Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Cathepsin B (EC 3.4.22.1), cathepsin H (EC 3.4.22.16), and cathepsin L (EC 3.4.22.15) were purified from human kidney by the method already described (20.Popovic̆ T. Puizdar V. Ritonja A. Brzin J. J. Chromatogr. B. 1996; 681: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Frozen fruit bodies of C. nebularis (500 g, fresh weight) were homogenized in 1000 ml of Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.5 m NaCl (Buffer A). The homogenate was centrifuged at 8000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was applied in aliquots of 300 ml to a column of carboxymethylpapain-Sepharose (2.5 × 15 cm) prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions, carboxymethylated as described in Ref. 21.Brzin J. Popovic T. Turk V. Borchart U. Machleidt W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 118: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, and equilibrated with Buffer A. Bound inhibitory fractions were eluted with 0.01 m NaOH, pooled, neutralized with dilute HCl, concentrated on an Amicon UM-10 membrane, and chromatographed on a Sephacryl S-200 column (4 × 110 cm) washed with buffer A. For the purpose of amino acid composition and sequence analysis, the inhibitor was additionally purified on a reverse-phase HPLC (Milton Roy LCD, UK) on a Vydac C8 column (Alltech; 4.6 × 250 mm), using a gradient of 0–80% (v/v) acetonitrile in water containing 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid over 25 min. Total RNA was isolated from the fungal material stored at −70 °C according to the method of Puissant and Houdebine (22.Puissant C. Houdebine L.M. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 148-149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The quality of the RNA was checked by electrophoresis in a formaldehyde/formamide system (23.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) followed by the downward alkaline transfer procedure of Chomczynski (24.Chomczynski P. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 201: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). The RNA was transferred to Hybond-N nylon membranes and dyed with 0.04% methylene blue. Degenerate primers were constructed with a linker restriction site on the 5′-end. Forward primer CnF (5′-GCGAATTCCCIGGIGTIGGIGGIGARTAYGC) was constructed from the Pro18–Ala25 region of the protein sequence with the EcoRI restriction site on the 5′-end, and the reverse primer CnR (5′-CGGGATCCTGICKYTCRAAICKCCAIGCNGG) was constructed from the Pro142–Arg148 region of the protein sequence with a BamHI restriction site on its 5′-end. Both primers contained inosine in the place of 4-nucleotide degeneration. Reverse transcription was performed in a reaction mix containing 1× PCR buffer II, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmeach dNTP, 1 unit/μl RNasin, 0.5 μg of CnR primer, and 2.5 units/μl of murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase. The reaction mixture was incubated for 10 min at 23 °C, 15 min at 42 °C, and 5 min at 99 °C. 30 cycles of PCR were performed by adding 1× PCR buffer II, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.83 μg CnF primer, 0.33 μg CnR primer, and 2.5 units of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer) to the final volume of 100 μl. After electrophoresis on 1.7% agarose gel, a band at about 400 base pairs was excised, inserted into EcoRI/BamHI-digested pUC19, and sequenced using the Pharmacia T7 sequencing kit following the appropriate manufacturer's protocol. Protein concentration of the purified inhibitor was determined by absorbance at 280 nm using a Perkin-Elmer UV-visible spectrometer λ 18. A molar absorbance coefficient of 22,900 m−1 cm−1was calculated from the amino acid sequence (25.Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3436) Google Scholar). Clitocypin was assayed for potential glycosylation with incubation withN-glycosidase F (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The reaction was incubated overnight at 37 °C, and the products were followed by SDS-PAGE. The inhibitor was also tested with a phenol-sulfuric acid assay for hexoses and pentoses as described (26.Manzi A.E. Esko J. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A.

A Pharmacia Phast System unit and 8–25% gradient gels were used, following the instructions of the manufacturer. Samples were prepared by mixing with equal volumes of 80 mmTris/HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 5% SDS, and were applied to the gel with or without previous boiling at 100 °C for 5 min. For sample reduction, 2-mercaptoethanol in a final concentration of 5% (v/v) was included in the mixture before boiling. Molecular masses were determined using LMW markers of 14.4–94 kDa (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Gels were stained with 0.1% (w/v) Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Samples were run on a Pharmacia Phast System using commercial precast pH 3–9 gradient gels following the instructions provided. pI values were determined using the Pharmacia broad-pI calibration kit (pI range 3.65–9.30) HPLC-purified protein was dissolved in water/methanol (1:1, v/v) solution containing 1% acetic acid and analyzed on a high resolution magnetic sector Autopsied Q mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK). The protein sample was introduced at a flow rate of 10 μmol/min using a syringe pump. Spectra were obtained by scanning from a mass/charge ratio of 2000 to 400 at 10 s/scan. Sodium iodide ions were used for calibration. Each molecular species produced a series of multiply charged protonated ions from which the molecular mass was determined by simple calculation. Chemical cleavage of 100 pmol of the inhibitor was performed by boiling it in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid for 20 min. For enzymatic cleavages, 350 pmol of native inhibitor was dissolved in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, and 6 m guanidine HCl and incubated for 48 h at 37 °C. After removal of guanidine HCl by HPLC, 100 pmol of sample was first fragmented using 2% (w/w) glycyl endopeptidase as described (6.Kriz̆aj I. Drobnic̆-Košorok M. Brzin J. Jerala R. Turk V. FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 15-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Hydrolysis of 100 pmol of sample by β-trypsin was carried out at 37 °C in 0.5 m N-methylmorpholine, pH 8.2, for 30 min at an enzyme/substrate ratio of 1:100 (w/w). Endoproteinase Lys-C at an enzyme/substrate molar ratio of 1:30 was used for proteolytic digestion of 100 pmol of the inhibitor for 10 h at room temperature in 0.3 m Tris buffer, pH 8.6, containing 0.1 mm CaCl2 and 5 m urea. All three enzyme hydrolyses were performed in a final volume of 200 μl. Reactions were stopped by the addition of trifluoroacetic acid. The peptide mixtures obtained were separated by HPLC (Milton Roy Co.) using a reverse phase Vydac C18 column equilibrated with 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and eluted with a linear gradient of acetonitrile from 0 to 80% in 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid over 60 min. The absorbance of the eluant was monitored at 215 nm. Amino acid composition was determined by hydrolysis of samples in 6.0m HCl at 110 °C for 24 h and analysis of the obtained hydrolysates on an Applied Biosystems 421 amino acid analyzer with precolumn phenylthiohydantoin derivatization. Automated Edman degradation and sequence analysis was carried out on an Applied Biosystems liquid pulse sequencer 475 A connected on-line to a model 120 A phenylthiohydantoin analyzer from the same manufacturer. For sequence comparison of clitocypin with other known protein sequences, data bases were searched with ExPASy protein sequence similarity search using the BLAST algorithm (27.Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70338) Google Scholar) and SAMBA (28.Lavenier, D. (1996) IRISA Report PI 988, INRIA Report RR 2845Google Scholar). The inhibitory activities of samples and fractions during the isolation procedure were measured against papain. A sample of 100 μl was added to 0.05 μm papain in 0.85 ml of buffer solution (0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, containing 5 mm cysteine and 1.5 mm EDTA). After 10 min of preincubation at room temperature, the reaction was initiated by the addition of 25 μl of 0.1 m substrate benzoyl-Arg-2-naphthylamide in Me2SO, and the mixture was incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped, andA 520 was read, following the procedure of Barrett (29.Barrett A.J. Anal. Biochem. 1972; 47: 280-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Active concentrations of cathepsins B and L and papain were determined by titration with Ep-475 (30.Barrett A.J. Kirschke H. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 535-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar). Residual activities were determined with benzoyl-Arg-2-naphthylamide as substrate for cathepsin B and papain (29.Barrett A.J. Anal. Biochem. 1972; 47: 280-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar) or with Z-Phe-Arg-MCA as substrate for cathepsin L (30.Barrett A.J. Kirschke H.

All concentration values given below refer to active concentrations. Inhibition kinetics of papain and cathepsin L were studied under pseudo-first-order conditions with at least a 10-fold molar excess of inhibitor over enzyme and in the presence of substrate (31.Turk B.

Barrett A.J. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1990; 6: 118-119PubMed Google Scholar). Various amounts of the inhibitor in the final concentration range of 2.5–50 nm were mixed with 10 μm Z-Phe-Arg-MCA as substrate in the assay buffer in a final volume of 2 ml in a fluorescence cuvette thermostated at 25 °C. The assay buffer for papain was 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, containing 2 mm dithioerythritol and 1.5 mmEDTA, while cathepsin L was assayed in 0.4 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, containing 2 mm dithioerythritol and 1.5 mm EDTA. To initiate the reaction, papain (final concentration 0.2 nm) or cathepsin L (final concentration 0.1 nm) was added in a negligible volume. Product formation was monitored continuously at excitation and emission wavelengths of 370 and 460 nm, respectively. The progress curves were fitted by nonlinear regression analysis to the equation of Morrison for the model of slow binding kinetics (33.Morrison J.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1982; 7: 102-105Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (496) Google Scholar), and k d andk a values were obtained using K mof 80 μm for papain (34.Tchoupe J.R. Moreau T. Gauthier F. Bieth J.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1076: 149-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and 2 μm for cathepsin L (35.Mason R.W. Biochem. J. 1986; 240: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The equilibrium constants (K i) were calculated from k a and k d(K i =k d/k a). The K i values for the inhibition of cathepsin B and stem bromelain by the inhibitor were determined from the linear equation of Henderson (36.Henderson P.J.F. Biochem. J. 1972; 127: 321-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar) derived for kinetics of tight binding competitive inhibitors. Each enzyme was incubated at 25 °C with different amounts of the inhibitor (0.05–1.5 μm) for 15 min in 0.3 ml of 0.1 m phosphate buffer, containing 10 mm cysteine and 1.5 mm EDTA. Cathepsin B was assayed at pH 6.0 and bromelain at pH 6.8. The reaction was initiated by the addition of the substrate in the final concentration of 10 μm in a negligible volume. Z-Phe-Arg-MCA was used for cathepsin B and Z-Arg-Arg-MCA for bromelain. After 10 min of incubation, the reaction was stopped with 5 mm iodoacetic acid. The released MCA was measured on a Perkin-Elmer LS 30 fluorimeter. The apparent K i values were obtained graphically (36.Henderson P.J.F. Biochem. J. 1972; 127: 321-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar), and true inhibition constants (K i) were obtained after correction for substrate competition using the equation K i = K i(app)/(1 + [So]/K m), where [So] is the initial substrate concentration and K m values are 150 μm for cathepsin B (37.Turk B. Ritonja A. Björk I. Stoka V. Dolenc I. Turk V. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and 15 μmfor bromelain (38.Rowan A.D. Buttle D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 555-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Trypsin activity was measured using the synthetic substrate benzoyl-arginyl-p-nitroanilide as described by Erlanger (39.Erlanger B.F. Kokowsky N. Cohen W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1961; 95: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (2897) Google Scholar). Pepsin was assayed using fluorogenic biopodyl-labeled casein as described in Ref. 40.Christeller J.T. Farley P.C. Ramsay R.J. Sullivan P.A. Laing W.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 160-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar. Clitocypin inhibitory activity was determined by titrating 2 μg of trypsin or 0.1 μg of pepsin with increasing amounts of clitocypin. Human (phenotypes A, B, and O) and rabbit red blood cells were extensively washed and suspended in buffered saline. 50-μl samples of crude C. nebularisextract and purified clitocypin (1 mg/ml) and their serial dilutions were mixed with 1 ml of 3% (v/v) erythrocyte suspension in test tubes and incubated for 3 h at room temperature. Agglutinated red blood cells formed a pellet, which was not resuspended upon shaking. Purified clitocypin was boiled in buffer A for 5 min in a sealed microcentrifuge tube. After cooling on ice for 5 min, it was used for titration of papain or run on calibrated gel filtration, as described above. The purification scheme required for purification of clitocypin was rather straightforward. Affinity chromatography proved to be an efficient first step, since it specifically removed other noninhibitory proteins, so that after gel filtration the inhibitor was practically homogeneous (Figs. 1 and 3). In a typical preparation, we obtained 2 mg of purified inhibitor from 100 g of fresh mushrooms.Figure 3Isoelectric focusing. Samples were loaded onto Phast Gel IEF with a gradient ranging from pH 3 to 9. Isoelectric point markers (lane 1), purified clitocypin (lane 2), and C. nebularisextract (lane 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The molecular mass of clitocypin under native conditions, as estimated by calibrated gel filtration, as well as that obtained in nonreducing SDS-PAGE without boiling of the sample was 34 kDa. The same mass of 34 kDa was obtained in the presence of reducing agent. Reduced and nonreduced samples, boiled in the presence of SDS, gave only a single band of 17 kDa (Fig. 1). Subsequent purification by RP HPLC resulted in two peaks Cn1 and Cn2, both showing inhibitory activity. Cn1 gave a single band of 34 kDa, and Cn2 gave two bands of 34 and 17 kDa on SDS-PAGE without boiling (Fig.2). Fraction Cn1 is thus composed solely of dimers (about 23 of the total), and Cn2 is composed of a mixture of dimers and monomers (about 13 of the total). By ES mass spectrometry, a single mass of 16,863 Da was obtained for clitocypin from gel filtration and from both HPLC peaks. On isoelectric focusing, the inhibitory protein ran as a single band at a pH value of 4.4 (Fig.3), which agrees well with the value of 4.42 calculated from the amino acid composition. Clitocypin proved to be an extremely stable protein. When boiled in nondenaturing buffer (see details under “Experimental Procedures”), it remained, as judged by inhibitory activity, elution volume in gel filtration, and behavior on SDS-PAGE, indistinguishable from the initial inhibitor (Fig. 1). Incubation in denaturing buffer with guanidine HCl, however, resulted in only the 17-kDa band on SDS-PAGE with and without boiling (Fig. 1) and complete loss of inhibitory activity. The position of peptides and overall strategy used for the complete amino acid sequence determination of clitocypin is shown in Fig.4. The N-terminal sequence analysis of clitocypin established the initial 11 N-terminal residues with a sequence yield in the range of 10%. Five peptides were obtained by acid hydrolysis (A1 to A5) and sequenced through to their C termini. Glycyl endopeptidase yielded the second set of peptides. G1 filled the gap between A2 and A3 and together with G2 established the order and overlaps of A2, A3, and A4. Tryptic peptide T1 contributed to the alignment and overlapping of the A1 and A2 peptides on the N-terminal part of the molecule. Based on the low content of Lys, the final set of peptides was obtained by endoproteinase Lys-C digestion. Peptide L1 filled the remaining gap between A3 and A4 and together with L2 provided the order of the peptides A3, A4, and A5 on the C terminus of the protein. From the sequence data, we conclude that 17-kDa monomeric clitocypin is composed of 150 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 16,854 Da. The molecule contains no cysteinyl residues, only one histidine and two tryptophanes, and is rich in proline and glycine. Amino acid composition analysis of undegraded clitocypin and its fragments provided the same 150 amino acid residues (results not shown). No sequence polymorphism was observed. Clitocypin contained no inhibitor consensus sequences characteristic of the cystatin superfamily members. No attachment site for oligosacharide chains was present, which is compatible with the observed absence of sugars by both methods used. A primer pair designed to span from the previously determined N terminus to the apparent C terminus was used for the reverse transcription-PCR amplification of mRNA isolated from C. nebularis fruit bodies. A product of approximately 400 base pairs termed Cn c1 was isolated, subcloned, and sequenced (Fig.5 B). Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence and comparison with the directly determined protein sequence showed 95% identity (Fig. 5 A). All seven amino acid residues that differ between the cDNA derived and protein sequences are located in the C-terminal region of the protein. In a search for homologous proteins in data bases, no protein showing high similarity with clitocypin was found. However, three protein sequences with some degree of similarity to clitocypin were disclosed. Relatively high similarity, restricted to just two regions of clitocypin (34 and 35% identity) for residues 47–89 and 95–136, respectively, was found for two parts of the minor tail 43.0-kDa protein from Mycobacterium phage L5 (Swiss-Prot accession no. O05278). Clitocypin was also found to share significant similarity (26% identity, 41% conservative residues throughout the aligned sequences) with a 16.5-kDa lectin-related protein (PC-LRP) from a lectin-deficient strain of mushroom Pleurotus cornucopiae(PIR accession no. JC 2102) (41.Oguri S. Nagata Y Biosci. Biotech. Biochem. 1994; 58: 507-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Higher levels of similarity were found in the N-terminal regions of the molecules as shown in Fig.5 A. Finally, when applying SAMBA computation of alignments, clitocypin was found to share considerable sequence similarity (35% amino acid identity) with 37 amino acids in the C-terminal region of Rhesus macaque cystatin C precursor protein (Swiss-Prot accession no.O19092) (42.Weil L.H. Walker L.C. Levy E. Stroke. 1996; 27: 2080-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In other parts of the sequences, the relatedness is not apparent. No cystatin C consensus sequences are observed in clitocypin. Titration, together with the determination of the concentration of the inhibitor, led to a value of 0.89 mol of clitocypin dimer needed to abolish enzymatic activity of 1 mol of papain (active concentration). The pseudo-first-order rate constant, k, for binding of clitocypin to papain and cathepsin L increased linearly with inhibitor concentration. The association (k a), and dissociation (k d) rate constants and equilibrium constants (K i) are presented in TableI. Both k a andk d are 2- and 3-fold lower, respectively, for cathepsin L than for papain, thus resulting in similar equilibrium constants (K i) for these two enzymes.K i for the inhibition of cathepsin B and bromelain are substantially"

We found that the plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase is the main mechanism involved in Ca2+ extrusion in human platelets. Treatment of platelets with the farnesylcysteine analogs, farnesylthioacetic acid andN-acetyl-S-geranylgeranyl-l-cysteine, inhibitors of activation of Ras proteins, accelerated the rate of decay of [Ca2+]i to basal levels after activation with thapsigargin combined with a low concentration of ionomycin, indicating that Ras proteins are involved in the negative regulation of Ca2+ extrusion. Rho A, which is involved in actin polymerization, was not responsible for this effect. Consistent with this, the actin polymerization inhibitors, cytochalasin D and latrunculin A, did not alter the recovery of [Ca2+]i. Activation of human platelets with thapsigargin and ionomycin stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of the plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase, a mechanism that was inhibited by farnesylcysteine analogs, suggesting that Ras proteins could regulate Ca2+ extrusion by mediating tyrosine phosphorylation of the plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase. Treatment of platelets with LY294002, a specific inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3- and phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase, resulted in a reduction in the rate of recovery of [Ca2+]i to basal levels, suggesting that the products of these kinases are involved in stimulating Ca2+ extrusion in human platelets.

Roufogalis B.D. Cell Calcium. 1995; 18: 459-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). [Ca2+]i is increased by the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores or by Ca2+ entry through plasma membrane Ca2+channels. Removal of Ca2+ from the cytosol and the maintenance of low resting [Ca2+]i is mainly mediated by two mechanisms, sequestration of Ca2+ into intracellular compartments and Ca2+ extrusion across the plasma membrane. Ca2+ efflux occurs by two pathways: Na+/Ca2+ exchange and active transport via the plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (PMCA) (e.g. Ref.1.Monteith G.R. Roufogalis B.D. Cell Calcium. 1995; 18: 459-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). As in red blood cells and pancreatic acinar cells, the PMCA is the main mechanism for Ca2+ extrusion in human platelets at resting Ca2+ concentrations (2.Rink T.J. Sage S.O. J. Physiol. 1987; 393: 513-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 3.Wright L.C. Chen S. Roufogalis B.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 306: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 4.Zhang B.-X. Zhao H. Loessberg P. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15419-15425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hence the PMCA is a key point for the regulation of Ca2+ homeostasis in these cells. The activity of PMCA has been shown to be regulated by several mechanisms including Ca2+/calmodulin, acidic phospholipids such as phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2), protein kinases A and C, and by proteases, whose effects have been described as “the last line of defense against sustained high levels of Ca2+” (1.Monteith G.R. Roufogalis B.D. Cell Calcium. 1995; 18: 459-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 5.Carafoli E. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 993-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Recently it has been shown that tyrosine phosphorylation of platelet PMCA leads to a substantial inhibition of its Ca2+-ATPase activity (6.Dean W.L. Chen D. Brandt P.C. Vanaman T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15113-15119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). This mechanism, together with the reported role of tyrosine kinases in the activation of store-operated Ca2+ entry in different cell types (7.Yule D.I. Kim E.T. Williams J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 1697-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 8.Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Busse R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 18151-18156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Sargeant P. Farndale R.W. Sage S.O. FEBS Lett. 1993; 315: 242-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), may serve as positive feedback to increase intracellular calcium concentration during platelet activation. Small GTPases of the Ras superfamily play a pivotal role in several signal transduction pathways (11.Fox J.E.B. Haemostasis. 1996; 26: 102-131PubMed Google Scholar). Platelets contain several members of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases as well as upstream regulators and downstream effectors. Many of these molecules are phosphorylated on tyrosine residues during platelet activation, indicating a close relationship between Ras proteins and tyrosine kinases (11.Fox J.E.B. Haemostasis. 1996; 26: 102-131PubMed Google Scholar). Ras proteins have been reported to play an important role in Ca2+ metabolism. These proteins have been shown to regulate the activation of store-mediated Ca2+ entry in platelets (12.Rosado J.A. Sage S.O. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 183-192Crossref Google Scholar) and other cells (13.Fasolato C. Hoth M. Penner R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20737-20740Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Bird G. St J. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21486-21488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In human platelets, this mechanism is partially mediated by the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, so providing a physical but reversible interaction between the Ca2+ compartments and the plasma membrane (15.Rosado J.A. Jenner S. Sage S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7527-7533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In the present work we have investigated the possibility that small GTPases of the Ras superfamily are involved in the regulation of PMCA activity in human platelets, so providing a regulatory pathway for a more rapid and sustained increase in intracellular calcium during platelet activation. The effects of LY294002 and inhibitors of actin polymerization were also examined to assess the influence of phosphoinositide kinases and the actin cytoskeleton, which have been reported to mediate some intracellular responses downstream of Ras proteins (11.Fox J.E.B. Haemostasis. 1996; 26: 102-131PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Rosado J.A. Sage S.O. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 183-192Crossref Google Scholar), in the activity of PMCA in these cells. Fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (Fura-2/AM) was from Texas Fluorescence (Austin, TX). Apyrase (grade V), aspirin, bovine serum albumin, paraformaldehyde, Nonidet P-40, fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled phalloidin, lanthanum chloride,N-methyl-d-glucamine, and thapsigargin (TG) were from Sigma (Poole, Dorset, United Kingdom). Ionomycin (IONO), cytochalasin D (Cyt D), LY294002, oligomycin, antimycin A, and C3 exoenzyme were from Calbiochem (Nottingham, UK). Farnesylthioacetic acid (FTA) andN-acetyl-S-geranylgeranyl-l-cysteine (AGGC) were from Alexis (Nottingham, United Kingdom). Latrunculin A (Lat A) was from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Protein A-agarose was from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (PY20) was from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Anti-PMCA monoclonal antibody (5F10) was from Affinity Bioreagents (Neshanic Station, NJ). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated ovine anti-mouse IgG antibody (NA931) was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All other reagents were of analytical grade. Fura-2-loaded platelets were prepared as described previously (15.Rosado J.A. Jenner S. Sage S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7527-7533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Briefly, blood was obtained from healthy drug-free volunteers and mixed with one-sixth volume of acid/citrate dextrose anticoagulant containing (in mm): 85 sodium citrate, 78 citric acid, and 111 d-glucose. Platelet-rich plasma was then prepared by centrifugation for 5 min at 700 ×g and aspirin (100 μm) and apyrase (40 μg/ml) added. Platelet-rich plasma was incubated at 37 °C with 2 μm Fura-2/AM for 45 min. Cells were then collected by centrifugation at 350 × g for 20 min and resuspended in HEPES-buffered saline containing (HBS in mm): 145 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 10 d-glucose, 5 KCl, 1 MgSO4, pH 7.45, and supplemented with 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and 40 μg/ml apyrase. In some experiments 145 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine hydrochloride replaced NaCl. Fluorescence was recorded from 1.5-ml aliquots of magnetically stirred platelet suspension (108 cells/ml) at 37 °C using a Cairn Research Spectrophotometer (Cairn Research Ltd., Sittingbourne, Kent, UK) with excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm and emission at 500 nm. Changes in [Ca2+]i were monitored using the Fura-2 340/380 fluorescence ratio and calibrated according to the method of Grynkiewicz et al. (16.Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To compare the rate of decay of [Ca2+]i to basal values after platelet stimulation between different treatments we used the constant of the exponential decay. Traces were fitted to the equation y=A(1− e −K1T) e−K2T, where K 2 is the constant of the exponential decay. F-actin content of resting and activated platelets was determined according to the modifications (17.Molony L. Ng-Sikorski J. Hellberg C. Andersson T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 223: 612-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) of a previously published procedure (18.Hartwig J.H. Kung S. Kovacsovics T. Janmey P.A. Cantley L.C. Stossel T.P. Toker A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32986-32993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Briefly, washed platelets (2 × 108 cells/ml) were activated in HEPES-buffered saline. Samples of platelet suspension (200 μl) were transferred to 200 μl of ice-cold 3% (w/v) formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 10 min. Fixed platelets were permeabilized by incubation for 10 min with 0.025% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 detergent dissolved in PBS. Finally, platelets were incubated for 30 min with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled phalloidin (1 μm) in PBS supplemented with 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. After incubation the platelets were collected by centrifugation in an MSE Micro-Centaur Centrifuge (MSE Scientific Instruments, Crawley, Sussex, UK) for 90 s at 3000 ×g and resuspended in PBS. Staining of 2 × 107 cells/ml was measured using a Perkin-Elmer Fluorescence Spectrophotometer (Perkin-Elmer, Norwalk, CT). Samples were excited at 496 nm and emission was at 516 nm. Washed platelets (2.5 × 109 cells/ml) were incubated with TG (1 μm) plus IONO (50 nm) in HEPES-buffered saline for the times indicated. Platelets were then lysed with an equal volume of 2 × lysis buffer (1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 158 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 1% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate containing 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 mm benzamidine, pH 7.2). Insoluble cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 4 °C for 5 min at 16,000 × g. Cell lysates were precleared by incubation with Protein A-agarose for 1 h. After removal of the Protein A-agarose by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 1 min, 4 μg of anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (PY20) was added followed by 2 h incubation. Protein A-agarose (50 μl) was then added and incubation continued for an additional 1 h. The immunoprecipitates were then collected by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 1 min and washed three times with wash buffer (1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 158 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 1% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate containing 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.2). Finally the pellet was resuspended in Laemmli's buffer (19.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207192) Google Scholar) and analyzed further by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting. Proteins were electrophoresed on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electrophoretically transferred, for 2 h at 0.8 mA/cm2, in a semi-dry blotter (Hoefer Scientific, Newcastle Staffs., UK) onto nitrocellulose membranes for subsequent probing. Blots were incubated overnight with 10% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) to block residual protein-binding sites. Membranes were then incubated for 1 h with anti-PMCA monoclonal antibody (5F10) diluted 1:500 in TBST. The primary antibody was removed and blots washed six times for 5 min each with TBST. To detect the primary antibody, blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated ovine anti-mouse IgG antibody diluted 1:10000 in TBST, washed six times in TBST, and exposed to enhanced chemiluminescence reagents for 1 min. Blots were then exposed to preflashed photographic film. The density of bands on the film was measured using a Quantimet 500 densitometer (Leica, Milton Keynes, UK). Analysis of statistical significance was performed using Student's unpaired t test. For multiple comparison, one-way analysis of variance combined with the Dunnett tests was used. Fig.1 A represents schematically the main Ca2+ transport systems involved in Ca2+ signaling during platelet activation. The sequential activation of these systems results in changes in [Ca2+]i. Using certain experimental conditions similar to those previously applied to pancreatic acinar cells by Toescu and Petersen (20.Toescu E.C. Petersen O.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8528-8535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) we have ascertained the importance of Ca2+ extrusion during Ca2+ signaling in human platelets. In a Ca2+-free medium (100 μm EGTA added), inhibition of the endomembrane Ca2+-ATPase (sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase) using 1 μm TG in the presence of a low concentration of IONO (50 nm; required for extensive depletion of the intracellular Ca2+ stores in platelets where two Ca2+ stores with high and low Ca2+ leakage rates have been described (21.Cavallini L.

J. 1994; 303: 599-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar)), resulted in a transient increase in [Ca2+]i due to release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores (Fig. 1 B, trace a). It has been shown that lanthanum effectively seals the cell at a concentration of 1 mm, blocking both Ca2+ entry and extrusion (23.Toescu E.C. Petersen O.H. Pfluegers Arch. 1994; 444: 325-331Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Treatment of platelets with TG plus IONO in the presence of 1 mm lanthanum results in a larger and sustained increase in [Ca2+]i than in the absence of lanthanum (Fig.1 B, trace b). As shown in Fig. 1 A, Ca2+ extrusion is the main mechanism responsible for the difference between the responses observed in the presence (trace b) and the absence of lanthanum (trace a). To confirm extrusion can occur against a concentration gradient and to check whether the decrease in [Ca2+]i could be partially mediated by Ca2+ leakage from the cells we performed a series of experiments in the presence of 500 nmextracellular Ca2+. Fig.2 A shows the effects of treating platelets with 1 μm TG plus 50 nmIONO in a Ca2+-free medium (100 μm EGTA added) or when 500 nm Ca2+ was added. Although [Ca2+]i was slightly higher after stimulation in the presence of external Ca2+, an effect that is mediated by Ca2+ entry, the pattern of decay under both conditions was similar (the rate of decay was 0.0078 ± 0.0008 in a Ca2+-free medium and 0.0076 ± 0.0006 in a medium containing 500 nm Ca2+) and the [Ca2+]i 5 min after the addition of TG plus IONO was also comparable (Fig. 2 A; n = 5). Established routes for Ca2+ extrusion are Na+/Ca2+ exchange and the PMCA. Although the main mechanism for Ca2+ extrusion at low Ca2+concentration has been reported to be the PMCA (2.Rink T.J. Sage S.O. J. Physiol. 1987; 393: 513-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 20.Toescu E.C. Petersen O.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8528-8535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) we also studied the possible involvement of the Na+/Ca2+exchanger in the removal of Ca2+ from the cytosol. Fig.2 B shows the response evoked by 1 μm TG plus 50 nm IONO in control medium (HBS) and when the cells were suspended in medium in which all Na+ had been replaced byN-methyl-d-glucamine. In both cases, [Ca2+]i was elevated to the same levels and then fell back to basal. The rate of decay of [Ca2+]ito basal levels was 0.0094 ± 0.0002 inN-methyl-d-glucamine buffer and 0.0092 ± 0.0002 in paired controls (n = 5). Mitochondria have been reported to remove Ca2+ from the cytosol, modulating physiological and pathophysiological cytosolic responses (24.Duchen M.R. J. Physiol. 1999; 516: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Hence we studied whether Ca2+ uptake by mitochondria could be involved in removal of Ca2+ from the platelet cytosol under our experimental conditions. Fig. 2 Cshows the responses evoked by 1 μm TG plus 50 nm IONO in control medium (HBS) and when platelets were suspended in HBS supplemented with 10 μm antimycin A and 10 μg/ml oligomycin to eliminate Ca2+ uptake by mitochondria (25.Kwan C.Y. Takemura H. Obie J.F. Thastrup O. Putney Jr., J.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C1006-C1015Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 C, the presence of antimycin A and oligomycin did not alter the pattern of decay in the [Ca2+]i to basal levels. The rate of decay was 0.0098 ± 0.0003 in normal HBS and 0.0096 ± 0.0001 in HBS supplemented with antimycin A and oligomycin (n = 5). Taken together, these results indicate that under our experimental conditions the PMCA is the main mechanism involved in Ca2+removal from the cytosol by extrusion across the plasma membrane. We have recently reported that farnesylcysteine analogs impair membrane association of the small GTPases of the Ras superfamily by preventing methylation of farnesylated or geranylgeranylated proteins (12.Rosado J.A. Sage S.O. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 183-192Crossref Google Scholar), a process that is required for the activation of these GTPases (26.Marom M. Haklai R. Ben-Baruch G. Marciano D. Egozi Y. Kloog Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22263-22270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In the present study we used FTA, an agent that selectively prevents methylation of farnesylated Ras proteins like Ras, Rac, Rap 1a, and Rap 2a, and AGGC, which inhibits methylation of geranylgeranylated proteins, such as Rab, Rho, Rap1b, or Rap 2b (27.Sinensky M. Lutz R.J. Bioessays. 1992; 14: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), to investigate the possible role of Ras proteins in PMCA activation. Fig.3 A shows the effect of preincubation at 37 °C for 20 min with 40 μm FTA combined with 30 μm AGGC on the response evoked by TG (1 μm) plus IONO (50 nm). Preincubation with FTA plus AGGC did not modify the release of Ca2+ from the intracellular stores stimulated by TG plus IONO; however, the rate of decay was enhanced about 2-fold. The decay constants were 0.0156 ± 0.0018 in FTA plus AGGC-treated platelets and 0.0070 ± 0.0001 in paired controls (n = 6; p < 0.01). To further investigate the role of small GTPases in PMCA activity we examined the effect of Clostridium botulinum C3 exoenzyme. C3 exoenzyme is a 25-kDa enzyme that has been shown to inactivate Rho A by ADP-ribosylation (28.Morii N. Teru-uchi T. Tominaga T. Kumagai N. Kozaki S. Ushikubi F. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20921-20926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 B, treatment of human platelets for 2 h at 37 °C with 100 μg/ml C. botulinum C3 exoenzyme did not alter either TG plus IONO-induced Ca2+ release from the intracellular stores or the rate of decay of [Ca2+]i to basal levels. The decay constants are 0.0070 ± 0.0001 and 0.0067 ± 0.0002 for control or C3 exoenzyme-treated platelets, respectively (n = 4). We have previously shown that treatment of platelets with C3 exoenzyme is effective at inhibiting store-regulated Ca2+ entry (12.Rosado J.A. Sage S.O. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 183-192Crossref Google Scholar). Several members of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases are believed to regulate the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. Treatment of platelets for 20 min with 40 μm FTA combined with 30 μm AGGC significantly reduced actin filament formation induced by TG (1 μm) plus IONO (50 nm) (Table I). To investigate whether the actin cytoskeleton plays a role in Ca2+ extrusion we investigated the effect of Cyt D and Lat A, two agents that inhibit actin filament polymerization by different mechanisms (29.Fox J.E.B. Phillips D.R. Nature. 1981; 292: 650-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 30.Spector I. Shochet N.R. Kashman Y. Groweiss A. Science. 1983; 219: 493-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). Human platelets were pretreated with 10 μm Cyt D for 40 min at 37 °C and actin filament content was determined using fluorescein isothiocyanate-phalloidin. As shown in Table I, Cyt D (10 μm) was without effect on the actin filament content of unstimulated platelets, but prevented TG plus IONO-induced actin filament formation. As shown in Fig.4 A, treatment of platelets with 10 μm Cyt D for 40 min did not modify the rate of decay of the [Ca2+]i to basal levels. The decay constants were 0.0059 ± 0.0007 and 0.0061 ± 0.0005 for control and Cyt D-treated platelets, respectively (n = 5). Similar results were obtained using Lat A. Preincubation of platelets for 1 h at 37 °C with 3 μm Lat A abolished TG plus IONO-induced actin polymerization without modifying actin filament content in non-stimulated platelets (Table I). As for Cyt D, Lat A did not significantly modify the rate of decay of the [Ca2+]i to basal levels. The decay constants were 0.0051 ± 0.0004 in Lat A-treated platelets and 0.0045 ± 0.0002 in paired controls (n = 5; p = 0.36).Table IEffects of FTA plus AGGC, cytochalasin D, latrunculin A, or LY294002 on the F-actin content of unstimulated and thapsigargin-stimulated human plateletsF-actin (% of basal)Stimulatory agentControlFTA + AGGCCyt DLat ALY29400210 μm100 μmNone100.0 ± 0.0103.4 ± 0.699.7 ± 3.3101.4 ± 2.198.7 ± 0.6101.4 ± 1.6TG + IONO151.8 ± 2.8109.5 ± 1.7ap < 0.01 compared with F-actin content in TG plus IONO-activated platelets in the absence of inhibitors.100.8 ± 0.5ap < 0.01 compared with F-actin content in TG plus IONO-activated platelets in the absence of inhibitors.103.1 ± 2.3ap < 0.01 compared with F-actin content in TG plus IONO-activated platelets in the absence of inhibitors.121.5 ± 0.9ap < 0.01 compared with F-actin content in TG plus IONO-activated platelets in the absence of inhibitors.107.4 ± 1.5ap < 0.01 compared with F-actin content in TG plus IONO-activated platelets in the absence of inhibitors.Human platelets were incubated at 37 °C with FTA (40 μm) plus AGGC (30 μm) for 20 min, cytochalasin D (10 μm) for 40 min, latrunculin A (3 μm) for 1 h, LY294002 (10 and 100 μm) for 30 min or the vehicles for the same period as controls.

Tyrosine phosphorylation of PMCA has recently been reported to inhibit its activity (6.Dean W.L. Chen D. Brandt P.C. Vanaman T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15113-15119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Activation of human platelets with 1 μm TG combined with 50 nm IONO caused a rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of PMCA (Fig. 5 A). An increase in tyrosine phosphorylation was detected 1 min after addition of TG plus IONO, reached a maximum within 3 min with a 2.46 ± 0.2-fold increase, and was maintained for at least 10 min (Fig. 5 A;n = 4). We have recently reported that farnesylcysteine analogs do not have a general inhibitory effect on tyrosine kinase activity in human platelets (12.Rosado J.A. Sage S.O. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 183-192Crossref Google Scholar). However, pretreatment of human platelets with 40 μm FTA plus 30 μm AGGC for 20 min at 37 °C significantly decreased the tyrosine phosphorylation of the PMCA stimulated by treatment with TG plus IONO by 85.6 ± 3.67% (Fig. 5 B; p < 0.001;n = 4). Pretreatment of platelets for 20 min with FTA plus AGGC did not significantly modify basal tyrosine phosphorylation of PMCA (Fig. 5 B). Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) and phosphoinositide 4-kinase (PI 4-kinase) have been shown to be regulated upstream by small GTPases in platelets and other cells (11.Fox J.E.B. Haemostasis. 1996; 26: 102-131PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Gasman S. Chasserot-Golaz S. Hubert P. Aunis D. Bader M.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16913-16920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To investigate the involvement of these kinases in Ca2+extrusion we examined the effect of LY294002, a cell permeant specific inhibitor of PI 3-kinase and PI 4-kinase (32.Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Rosado J.A. Sage S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9110-9113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that treatment of human platelets for 30 min with LY294002 inhibits PI 3-kinase and PI 4-kinase activity in a concentration-dependent manner reaching a complete inhibition of PI 3-kinase activity at a concentration of 10 μm and almost complete inhibition of PI 4-kinase activity at a concentration of 100 μm (33.Rosado J.A. Sage S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9110-9113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Treatment of platelets for 30 min at 37 °C with 10 or 100 μm LY294002 did not modify Ca2+ release from the intracellular stores induced by TG plus IONO. However, LY294002 significantly decreased the rate of decay of [Ca2+]i to basal levels at both concentrations investigated. The decay constant was reduced from 0.0070 ± 0.0003 in control platelets to 0.0052 ± 0.0005 or 0.0048 ± 0.0002 when platelets were preincubated with 10 or 100 μmLY294002, respectively (Fig. 6;p < 0.01; n = 5). The PMCA plays a key role in [Ca2+]ihomeostasis. The PMCA and the Na+Ca2+ exchanger are the only transporters capable of removing Ca2+ from the cell; however, since some studies indicate that the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger does not significantly contribute to Ca2+ efflux in platelets at resting Ca2+ levels (2.Rink T.J.

This site plays a critical role in mediating the binding of these and other specific protein substrates, inhibitors, and macromolecular effectors to thrombin (2.Stubbs M.T. Bode W. Thromb.

The characteristics of this site on prothrombin and prothrombin activation intermediates, however, are not clearly established. Equilibrium binding studies with a fluorescein-labeled hirudin peptide, hirudin53–64 1 (14.Maraganore J.M. Chao B. Joseph M.L. Jablonski J. Ramachandran K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8692-8698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as an exosite I-specific probe showed that bovine prothrombin had no detectable affinity for the peptide (3.Liu L-W. Ye J. Johnson A.E. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23633-23636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of exosite I on thrombin was concluded to result from conformational changes that accompany either of the two factor Xa cleavages that give rise to the alternate prothrombin activation intermediates, prethrombin 2 and meizothrombin (3.Liu L-W. Ye J. Johnson A.E. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23633-23636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Contrasting the results for hirugen, an anti-exosite I antibody and thrombomodulin showed no detectable affinity for the human prothrombin activation intermediates, whereas these ligands bind to exosite I of thrombin specifically (4.Wu Q. Picard V. Aiach M. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3725-3730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding to human prothrombin of a nonsulfated hirudin peptide analog,N-acetyl-Hir55–65, containing a Gly substitution at residue 65 was demonstrated by NMR, but the peptide bound to prothrombin with an estimated dissociation constant of ∼500 μm, indicating a very low affinity of uncertain significance (17.Ni F. Ning Q. Jackson C.M. Fenton J.W., II J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16899-16902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although there is good agreement that the affinity of exosite I for hirudin peptides and macromolecular ligands is increased on conversion of prothrombin to thrombin, this site has not been directly characterized on prothrombin, and the information available from previous binding studies favors the idea that the site is absent from the intact zymogen as a functionally significant site. Studies of the effects of hirudin peptides on the kinetics of human prethrombin 2 activation, however, demonstrate inhibition of the factor Va-stimulated rate, suggesting an unexpected function for a hirudin peptide binding site in prethrombin 2 activation that might extend to prothrombin as well (3.Liu L-W. Ye J. Johnson A.E. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23633-23636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Kinetic studies of bovine prethrombin 2 activation by the factor Xa-factor Va-phospholipid complex showed inhibition by hirugen in an apparently competitive manner with the substrate (18.Betz A. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10709-10718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), suggesting a role for a hirudin peptide binding site in productive prethrombin 2 interactions with the factor Xa-factor Va catalytic complex. Although these studies indicate that hirudin peptide binding sites are involved in prethrombin 2 activation, the mechanism has not been fully defined. Whether a similar mechanism exists for the natural substrate, prothrombin, has not been considered, largely because of the unknown status of exosite I on prothrombin. Equilibrium binding studies employing a fluorescein-labeled derivative of the peptide, hirudin54–65([5F]Hir54–65(SO3−)), were undertaken to identify and characterize the properties of proexosite I on prothrombin. Human and bovine thrombin have different affinities for hirudin peptides (14.Maraganore J.M. Chao B. Joseph M.L. Jablonski J. Ramachandran K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8692-8698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and because proteins of both species have been studied previously in this context (3.Liu L-W. Ye J. Johnson A.E. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23633-23636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Wu Q. Picard V. Aiach M. Sadler J.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 16899-16902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), bovine prothrombin and thrombin were compared here as analogs of the human proteins to delineate species-specific functional differences in the proexosite and exosite interactions. [5F]Hir54–65(SO3−) and the unlabeled peptide (Hir54–65(SO3−)) bound to human prothrombin with higher affinity than previously studied analogs, which allowed characterization of the proexosite for the first time. The results demonstrate that proexosite I is present on human and bovine prothrombin as a specific binding site for hirudin peptides that exhibit an ∼100-fold lower affinity compared with thrombin. Human and bovine proteins showed species-specific differences in affinities for the peptides, which were 2–5-fold lower for the bovine proteins. Comparison of the binding of hirudin peptide analogs lacking the fluorescein probe or Tyr63 sulfation was consistent with the peptides interacting with similar specificity through the same site on prothrombin and thrombin for both species. In the companion paper (19.Anderson P.J. Nesset A. Dharmawardana K.R. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16435-16442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), evidence is presented for a role of proexosite I in the mechanism of specific recognition of prothrombin as the substrate of the factor Xa-factor Va catalytic complex. Human prothrombin was purified from plasma or from a plasma fraction obtained from Hyland Laboratories (20.Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14963-14973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bovine prothrombin and thrombin were obtained from Hematologic Technologies. Prothrombin was chromatographed on sulfopropyl-Sephadex (1 cm × 9 cm) in 50 mm Hepes, 0.125 m NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1 μmFPR-CH2Cl, 1 mg/ml polyethylene glycol 8000, pH 7.4, to eliminate traces of thrombin. Human α-thrombin was purified as described previously (20.Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14963-14973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or obtained from Dr. John Fenton (New York State Department of Health, Albany, NY). Thrombin concentrations were determined by active-site titration with p-nitrophenylp'-guanidinobenzoate (20.Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14963-14973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thrombin preparations were ≥90% active. Protein concentrations were determined by absorbance at 280 nm with the following absorption coefficients ((mg/ml)−1 cm−1) and molecular weights (21.Mann K.G. Elion J. Butkowski R.J. Downing M. Nesheim M.E. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 286-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar,22.Fenton J.W., II Fasco M.J. Stackrow A.B. Aronson D.L. Young A.M. Finlayson J.S. J. Biol.

Hir 54–65(SO3−) and the nonsulfated peptide (Sigma or Bachem) were dissolved in water or buffer, and the concentration was determined by the purity and peptide content specified by the manufacturers. The concentration of nonsulfated peptide determined from the tyrosine absorbance at 293 nm in 0.1 m NaOH with an absorption coefficient of 2381m−1 cm−1 (23.Mihalyi E. J. Chem. Eng. Data. 1968; 13: 179-182Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar) agreed to within 10% of the calculated concentration. Amino acid analysis confirmed the composition and concentrations (± 20%) for both peptides. Hir54–65(SO3−) was labeled at the amino terminus with 5-carboxy(fluorescein) and characterized as described previously (24.Bock P.E. Olson S.T. Björk I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19837-19845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Binding of Hir54–65(SO3−) to prothrombin was investigated by quantitative affinity chromatography on Hir54–65(SO3−)-agarose. The affinity matrixes were prepared by coupling of 2 mg of Hir54–65(SO3−) to 2–3 ml of Affi-Gel-10 (Bio-Rad) by mixing in 50 mm Hepes, 0.1m NaCl, 80 mm CaCl2, pH 7.5, at room temperature for 1 h. The immobilization reaction was stopped by blocking the gel with 0.1 m ethanolamine, pH 8.0, and mixing for 2 h. The 0.8-cm × 5.5-cm columns were washed with 100 ml of buffer, followed by buffer containing 2 m NaCl to remove any unreacted peptide. The capacity of the matrix for prothrombin was determined by analysis of batchwise titrations of small volumes of gel (50 μl) with prothrombin and measurement of binding from the decrease in solution protein absorbance. Chromatography experiments were performed by loading 300 μl of 4.7 μmprothrombin (0.1 mg) in 50 mm Hepes, 0.11 mNaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 1 mg/ml polyethylene glycol 8000, pH 7.4, onto the 2.7-ml columns. The flow rate was regulated at 1.5 ml/h, and 0.28-ml fractions were collected. Prothrombin was preincubated with 1 μm FPR-CH2Cl and various concentrations of Hir54–65(SO3−) for 30 min at 25 °C before chromatography at room temperature, and the elution volume (V obs) was determined from the midpoint of the protein peak measured from the absorbance at 230 nm. A control matrix, prepared in the same manner described above but without any peptide, was used to determine the elution volume for prothrombin under conditions where it did not interact with the matrix (V o*). These results were also compared with the elution of prothrombin from Hir54–65(SO3−)-agarose in buffer containing 2 m NaCl. Recovery of the protein eluted from the column was quantitated by integration of the absorbance peaks. On the basis of characterization of the matrix used for prothrombin affinity chromatography, the concentration of prothrombin binding sites in the gel volume was ≥24 μm, at least 5-fold greater than the highest prothrombin concentrations in the experiments of ≤4.7 μm. Satisfaction of the condition that only a small fraction of matrix binding sites were occupied allowed the dependence of the fractional change in elution volume of prothrombin ((V obs - V o*)/V o*) on the total concentration of competing Hir54–65(SO3−) ([Hir54–65(SO3−)]o) to be approximated by the hyperbolic Equation 1 (25.Winzor D.J.

Fluorescence was measured with an SLM 8100 fluorometer in the ratio mode, using acrylic cuvettes coated with polyethylene glycol 20,000. All experiments were performed in 50 mm Hepes, 0.11 m NaCl, 5 mmCaCl2, 1 mg/ml polyethylene glycol 8000, pH 7.4, and at 25 °C. Experiments with prothrombin contained 1 μmFPR-CH2Cl. Fluorescence excitation spectra of 0.2 μm[5F]Hir54–65(SO3−) with near-saturating concentrations of human (20 μm) or bovine (40 μm) prothrombin or thrombin (1 μm) were recorded at the emission maximum of 520 nm (2 nm excitation band pass and 4 nm emission band pass). Spectra were corrected for small variations in the initial fluorescence of [5F]Hir54–65(SO3−) between experiments by normalization of the fluorescence to the initial intensity measured with excitation at 491 nm. Corrections for dilution were ≤6%, with the exception of bovine prothrombin, where the lower affinity necessitated corrections of ≤20%. Corrections for background (≤1%) were made from parallel measurements on blanks lacking the labeled peptide. Binding of [5F]Hir54–65(SO3−) to prothrombin or thrombin was measured by titrating the labeled peptide with each protein, monitored by the fluorescence changes at three excitation wavelengths selected from the difference spectrum. The changes in fluorescence of [5F]Hir54–65(SO3−), expressed as(F obs −F o )/F o =ΔF/F o as a function of total prothrombin or thrombin concentration were fit simultaneously with the quadratic binding equation to obtain the maximal fluorescence change for each excitation wavelength (ΔF max /F o), a single dissociation constant (K D), and the stoichiometric factor (n). Competitive binding of [5F]Hir54–65(SO3−) and unlabeled peptides was quantitated in titrations measuring the reversal of the fluorescence change of mixtures of [5F]Hir54–65(SO3−) and prothrombin or thrombin as a function of competitor concentration. The direct titrations of [5F]Hir54–65(SO3−) with excitation at 491 nm and the competitive binding curves collected at one or more excitation wavelengths were fit simultaneously by the cubic equation for competitive binding to determine ΔF max /F o, the dissociation constant, and stoichiometric factor for peptide binding to prothrombin or thrombin (24.Bock P.E. Olson S.T. Björk I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19837-19845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 27.Olson S.T. Bock P.E. Sheffer R. Arch. Biochem.

In these experiments, measurements were additionally corrected for a small (≤5%) linear increase in fluorescence of [5F]Hir54–65(SO3−) when titrated with the unlabeled peptide at high concentrations. Parameters for [5F]Hir54–65(SO3−) binding were allowed to vary in nonlinear least squares analysis of the competitive binding experiments to optimize the fits. The resulting best fit parameters were within the experimental error of the independently determined values. Data were analyzed by least squares fitting with Scientist software (MicroMath). Reported errors in the parameters are ± 2 S.D. Hir54–65(SO3−) interactions with prothrombin were investigated first by small-zone quantitative affinity chromatography. Human prothrombin eluted from an immobilized Hir54–65(SO3−) peptide matrix as a broad peak at an elution volume well beyond the void volume in I 0.15 m, 5 mmCaCl2, pH 7.4 buffer. Prothrombin eluted near the void volume in buffer containing 2 m NaCl and, similarly, from a control column lacking immobilized peptide, indicating that the peptide bound specifically to prothrombin at physiological ionic strength (Fig.1 B). Prothrombin was eluted in progressively smaller volumes from the peptide matrix when it was equilibrated with increasing concentrations of Hir54–65(SO3−) (Fig. 1). Analysis of the decrease in elution volume of prothrombin as a function of increasing concentration of Hir54–65(SO3−) gave a dissociation constant of 1.3 ± 0.2 μm for binding of Hir54–65 (SO3−) to prothrombin in solution and an intercept of 2.3 ± 0.1 for [X]o/K X (Fig. 1 A,inset). The latter value was in good agreement with the value of 2.6 obtained independently from titration of the matrix with prothrombin (see “Experimental Procedures”), supporting the consistency of the analysis. The recovery of prothrombin eluted from the column was 77–102%, indicating that binding was not due to a minor species in prothrombin preparations with a higher affinity for the peptide but, instead, represented a homogeneous property of prothrombin. Bovine prothrombin was not as tightly bound to Hir54–65 (SO3−)-agarose as the human protein, eluting slightly but reproducibly shifted to higher elution volume (Fig. 1 B) by an amount that reflected too low an affinity to be determined. By contrast, thrombin was quantitatively bound by the peptide column over much larger elution volumes (results not shown), indicating much higher affinity binding. Interactions of [5F]Hir54–65(SO3−) with thrombin and prothrombin were characterized in fluorescence excitation and emission spectral studies. As shown in Fig.2, the excitation difference spectra of [5F]Hir54–65(SO3−) binding to prothrombin and thrombin revealed differences that allowed binding of the two proteins to be distinguished experimentally by choice of excitation wavelengths. The S-shaped difference spectrum for human prothrombin and [5F]Hir54–65(SO3−) had a minimum at 491 ± 2 nm, an apparent isosbestic point at 504 ± 2 nm, and a fluorescence enhancement maximum at 513 ± 2 nm (Fig. 2). By contrast, the shape and amplitude of the fluorescence changes were quite different for binding of the peptide to thrombin (Fig. 2). Thrombin thus decreased the fluorescence at all three wavelengths by 29 ± 1% at 491 nm, 19 ± 1% at 504 nm, and 10 ± 1% at 513 nm. Additional spectra collected as a function of prothrombin concentration confirmed that the crossover point in the difference spectrum was an isosbestic wavelength (results not shown). This indicated that the fluorescence changes at different excitation wavelengths were well described by no more than two states, consistent with a single binding event. The fluorescence emission spectrum of [5F]Hir54–65(SO3−) showed a maximum at 520 nm and exhibited only small spectral shifts (±2 nm) on binding to bovine or human prothrombin and thrombin. The excitation difference spectra for bovine prothrombin and thrombin were qualitatively similar to those of the corresponding human proteins but quantitatively different in the amplitudes of the fluorescence changes and showed a small but significant difference in the position of the isosbestic point from 504 (human) to 508 nm (bovine) (Fig. 2). These results demonstrated distinctly different environments of the probe when bound to proexosite I on prothrombin compared with exosite I on thrombin, which was maintained by proteins of both human and bovine sources. The spectral changes accompanying binding of [5F]Hir54–65(SO3−) were used to quantitate the interactions and to distinguish between binding of the peptide to prothrombin and to thrombin. The amplitudes of the fluorescence changes in titrations of [5F]Hir54–65(SO3−) paralleled the fluorescence changes seen in the difference spectra for prothrombin and thrombin. Analysis of titrations of [5F]Hir54–65(SO3−) with human prothrombin monitored at excitation wavelengths of 491, 504, and 513 nm gave a dissociation constant of 3.2 ± 0.3 μm (Fig.3 A, TableI). The maximum fluorescence change with excitation at 504 nm of −0.9 ± 0.3% indicated no trace contamination of prothrombin preparations with thrombin, which would have been detected by a decrease of the fluorescence at this isosbestic wavelength. Fluorescence titrations of [5F]Hir54–65(SO3−) with human thrombin revealed binding of 0.84 ± 0.06 mol of peptide/mol of thrombin with a 130-fold tighter dissociation constant of 25 ± 2 nm compared with prothrombin (Fig. 3 B). The dissociation constant for thrombin was in agreement with the previously reported values in the presence of EDTA (24.Bock P.E. Olson S.T. Björk I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19837-19845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), indicating no effect of calcium on peptide binding. Titrations of [5F]Hir54–65(SO3−) with bovine prothrombin and thrombin resulted in a 15 ± 2 μm dissociation constant for prothrombin (Fig.3 C, Table I) and a 99 ± 9 nm dissociation constant for thrombin (Fig. 3 D), indicating a similar, 150-fold enhanced affinity of the peptide for thrombin. The bovine proteins bound the fluorescein-labeled peptide with 4–5-fold lower affinity when compared with human prothrombin and thrombin.Table IParameters determined for binding of hirudin peptides to human and bovine prothrombin and thrombinInteractionMethodHumanBovineK DSitesΔF max/F oK DΔF max/F oμmmol/mol protein%μm%Prothrombin [5F]Hir54–65(SO3−)Direct titration3.2 ± 0.315 ± 2491 nm−17.6 ± 0.5−22.5 ± 1.0504/508 nm−0.9 ± 0.3−0.5 ± 0.6513 nm13.0 ± 0.58.5 ± 0.6 Hir54–65(SO3−)Competitive binding2.6 ± 0.60.74 ± 0.098 ± 1491 nm−18.7 ± 0.4−25.6 ± 1.5504/508 nm−1.3 ± 0.3513 nm12.8 ± 0.4 Hir54–65Competitive binding45 ± 779 ± 11491 nm−18.4 ± 0.5−24.0 ± 1.3Thrombin [5F]Hir54–65(SO3−)Direct titration0.025 ± 0.0020.84 ± 0.060.099 ± 0.009491 nm−29.2 ± 0.4−23.7 ± 0.4504/508 nm−19.0 ± 0.5−5.7 ± 0.2513 nm−10.1 ± 0.41.0 ± 0.3 Hir54–65(SO3−)Competitive binding0.038 ± 0.0150.73 ± 0.380.190 ± 0.027491 nm−29.4 ± 0.5−24.0 ± 0.4504/508 nm−21.4 ± 0.8513 nm−11.5 ± 0.7 Hir54–65Competitive binding0.65 ± 0.081.3 ± 0.1491 nm−29.4 ± 0.5−24.1 ± 0.3Parameters determined from direct and competitive fluorescence titrations for binding of [5F]Hir54–65(SO3−), Hir54–65(SO3−), and Hir54–65 to human and bovine prothrombin and thrombin are listed.

Fluorescence titrations were performed and analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab Parameters determined from direct and competitive fluorescence titrations for binding of [5F]Hir54–65(SO3−), Hir54–65(SO3−), and Hir54–65 to human and bovine prothrombin and thrombin are listed. Titrations performed using one or more excitation wavelengths were fit to obtain the maximum fluorescence change at each wavelength (ΔF max/F o), dissociation constant (K D), and stoichiometric factor (Sites). Titrations at isosbestic wavelengths were done with excitation at 504 nm (human) and 508 nm (bovine). Fluorescence titrations were performed and analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” To examine the influence of the presence of the fluorescein probe on interactions of the labeled peptide, binding of unlabeled Hir54–65(SO3−) to human prothrombin was quantitated from its competitive effect on binding of [5F]Hir54–65(SO3−). Titrations of fixed concentrations of [5F]Hir54–65(SO3−) and various fixed concentrations of human prothrombin with Hir54–65(SO3−) as the competitor resulted in a return of the fluorescence intensity of the probe at each of three excitation wavelengths toward their original values (Fig. 4). Simultaneous fitting of the data with a competitive binding model yielded a stoichiometry of 0.74 ± 0.09 mol Hir54–65(SO3−)/mol of prothrombin and a dissociation constant of 2.6 ± 0.6 μm (Table I). The maximum change in fluorescence observed at 504 nm was a negligible, −1.3 ± 0.3%, supporting further the conclusion that a single interaction with only prothrombin was responsible for the spectral changes. Competitive titrations of Hir54–65(SO3−) binding to bovine prothrombin gave a dissociation constant of 8 ± 1 μm (Fig. 5, Table I), similar to the value of 15 ± 2 μm obtained for the fluorescein-labeled peptide and 3–5-fold lower affinity when compared with the human proteins. These results indicated that the fluorescein-labeled and the unlabeled peptides bound competitively and with similar affinity to human and bovine prothrombin, demonstrating little effect of the probe on peptide binding. Binding of Hir54–65(SO3−) to human and bovine thrombin were similarly compared in competitive binding experiments (Fig. 6). Fitting of the titrations gave dissociation constants of 0.038 ± 0.015 μm and 0.19 ± 0.027 μm for human and bovine thrombin, respectively (Table I). These results demonstrated competitive binding of the peptides to exosite I and binding of the unlabeled and fluorescein-labeled peptides with similar affinity. Comparison of the results for prothrombin and thrombin with Hir54–65(SO3−) showed that proexosite I displayed a 70-fold (human) and 40-fold (bovine) increase in affinity on conversion of prothrombin to thrombin, somewhat smaller than the 130–150-fold change in affinity seen for [5F]Hir54–65(SO3−) (Table I). To examine the dependence of proexosite I affinity on structural changes in Hir54–65(SO3−), the role of sulfation of Tyr63 in binding affinity was investigated by characterizing the binding of the unlabeled, nonsulfated peptide (Fig. 7). The simultaneous fit of the competitive binding data collected for human prothrombin resulted in a dissociation constant of 45 ± 7 μm for binding of Hir54–65 (Fig. 7 A, Table I), representing a 17-fold loss of affinity compared with Hir54–65(SO3−) due to lack of sulfation of Tyr63. Similar competitive binding studies with bovine prothrombin gave a dissociation constant of 79 ± 11 μm (Fig. 7 C, Table I), showing a similar, 10-fold lower affinity compared with the sulfated peptide. Titrations of human or bovine thrombin with Hir54–65 resulted in dissociation constants of 0.65 ± 0.08 μm and 1.3 ± 0.1 μm (Fig. 7, B andD, Table I), respectively, which represented a 60–70-fold enhanced affinity compared with prothrombin. The results indicated that both prothrombin and thrombin bound the sulfated peptide with 10–17-fold higher affinity compared with the nonsulfated analog, supporting the conclusion that the two peptides bound to the same exosite but with a higher specificity for the sulfated peptide. The results of these studies demonstrate that exosite I is present on both human and bovine prothrombin as a specific binding site and forms a complex with hirudin peptides that is conformationally distinct from the thrombin exosite I-peptide complex. The proexosite undergoes a ∼100-fold increase in affinity for hirudin peptides upon conversion to thrombin. Several lines of evidence support the conclusion that binding of the peptides is a homogeneous property of prothrombin and represents a specific site rather than binding to minor protein species with different properties or nonspecific interactions of the probe or peptide. This evidence includes (a) the single binding site stoichiometry determined for binding of Hir54–65(SO3−) to prothrombin, (b) the quantitative affinity chromatography results demonstrating binding of essentially all of prothrombin to the immobilized and free peptides, and (c) characterization of the excitation spectral changes, allowing the possible complicating contribution of minor species with high affinity for the peptides, notably thrombin, to be ruled out. The favorable spectral properties and high affinity of [5F]Hir54–65(SO3−) for prothrombin allowed proexosite I of the zymogen to be directly characterized for the first time. In previous studies, the affinity of exosite I for specific ligands was undetectable or weak on bovine (3.Liu L-W. Ye J. Johnson A.E. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23633-23636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or human (4.Wu Q. Picard V. Aiach M. Sadler J.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 16899-16902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) prothrombin. The main differences between these studies were the different structures of the hirudin peptides studied, as well as the use of human and bovine proteins, which have different properties. Given the ∼4-fold lower affinity for thrombin of the hirudin53–64 peptide used in previous studies (3.Liu L-W. Ye J. Johnson A.E. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23633-23636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and assuming a similar, 150-fold decrease in binding affinity, as that of seen for bovine prothrombin with [5F]Hir54–65(SO3−), the affinity of the labeled peptide for prothrombin may have diminished to an undetectable level under the conditions of the previous studies. The amplitude of the fluorescence change may also have been too small to detect binding of this particular peptide derivative to prothrombin. The fluorescence spectral changes accompanying [5F] Hir54–65(SO3−) binding provided a comparison of the relative environments of the probe and, thereby, the exosite in the complexes with prothrombin and thrombin. Conversion of prothrombin to thrombin is accompanied by the conformational change in the prethrombin 2 domain that activates the thrombin catalytic site and dissociation of the prothrombin fragment 1 and 2 activation domains. Interactions of the fragment 2 domain with thrombin have been reported to affect exosite I affinity for hirudin peptides (3.Liu L-W. Ye J. Johnson A.E. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23633-23636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Fredenburgh J.C. Stafford A.R. Weitz J.I. J. Biol.

Crystallographic studies of thrombin and its complexes show that exosite I is initially disordered in free thrombin and prethrombin 2 and that it assumes a well defined conformation when the hirudin peptides, which are also disordered in solution, bind (31.Malkowski M.G. Martin P.D. Guzik J.C. Edwards B.F.P. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1438-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 32.Vijayalakshmi J. Padmanabhan K.P. Mann K.G. Tulinsky A.

It is not known if the proexosite on prothrombin is also initially disordered. Binding is thought to be driven first by favorable electrostatic interactions of the anionic peptide with the electropositive field created by basic residues in exosite I (34.Bode W. Mayr I. Baumann U. Huber R. Stone S.R. Hofsteenge J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3467-3475Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar, 35.Jackman M.P. Parry M.A.A. Hofsteenge J. Stone S.R. J. Biol.

Comparison of the structures of different thrombin complexes with hirudin peptide analogs show that many contacts are subsequently made between the peptide and binding site residues, but these studies are also consistent with flexibility in the sets of particular interactions of the peptides with exosite I residues that contribute to stability of the complexes (38.Vitali J. Martin P.D. Malkowski M.G. Robertson W.D. Lazar J.B. Winant R.C. Johnson P.H Edwards B.F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17670-17678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39.Vitali J. Martin P.D.

The distinctive spectral changes of the fluorescence probe in the proexosite I and exosite I complexes were consistent with this flexibility and indicated that the environments of the exosite on prothrombin and thrombin were significantly different in the vicinity of the fluorescein probe at the amino terminus of hirudin54–65. This is not incompatible with the previous conclusion from NMR studies (17.Ni F. Ning Q. Jackson C.M. Fenton J.W., II J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16899-16902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that a hirudin peptide analog bound in the same conformation to prothrombin and thrombin because these studies employed peptides different from those used here. While the conformation of the bound peptides may be the same in some respects, the probe reports a change in the microenvironment of proexosite I near the amino terminus of the peptide when prothrombin is converted to thrombin. Human thrombin showed a large increase of 130-fold in the affinity for [5F]Hir54–65(SO3−) when compared with prothrombin, which is concluded to represent activation of exosite I. The results of the competitive binding experiments for [5F]Hir54–65 (SO3−), Hir54–65(SO3−), and Hir54–65 indicated that the changes in fluorescence were due to specific interactions of the peptides with the same site on prothrombin and thrombin. [5F]Hir54–65(SO3−) showed the largest differential affinity, with a 130–150-fold difference between prothrombin and thrombin, whereas Hir54–65(SO3−) and Hir54–65 showed slightly smaller, 40–70-fold and 60–70-fold enhancements (Table I). These differences provide some evidence for differences in the specificity of prothrombin and thrombin for the peptide analogs. Relatively small differences in the interactions of the fluorescein probe presumably account for this effect. The absence of Tyr63 sulfation of Hir54–65resulted in a 7–10-fold (bovine) and 17-fold (human) lower affinity for both prothrombin and thrombin, confirming that the sulfate group of the peptide stabilizes the interaction with exosite I on thrombin (14.Maraganore J.M.

The magnitude of the change in affinity for thrombin due to sulfation is in agreement with previous studies (14.Maraganore J.M. Chao B. Joseph M.L. Jablonski J. Ramachandran K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8692-8698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41.Muramatsu R. Komatsu Y. Nukui E. Okayama T. Morikawa T. Kobashi K. Hayashi H. Int. J. Pept.

The similar effect of sulfation on the affinity of Hir54–65(SO3−) for thrombin and prothrombin indicates that the hydrogen bonding network that stabilizes the interaction of exosite I residues with the sulfate group (40.Skrzypczak-Jankun E.

Biol. 1991; 221: 1379-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) is apparently unchanged in the prothrombin- and thrombin-peptide complexes. This aspect of the bound peptide conformation thus appears to be the same in the zymogen and enzyme complexes and does not contribute to activation of the exosite. Comparison of human and bovine prothrombin and thrombin demonstrated quantitative differences in proexosite I and exosite I by a 2–5-fold lower affinity of the bovine proteins for the hirudin peptides and similar but quantitatively different spectral changes on binding [5F]Hir54–65(SO3−). Human and bovine thrombin B-chains differ by 34 amino acid substitutions, including substitution of Asn78 by Lys and Ile79 with Val near exosite I, and 7 less conservative differences in the autolysis loop (42.Bode W. Huber R. Rydel T.J. Tulinsky A. Berliner L.J. in Thrombin Structure and Function. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1992: 3-61Google Scholar). The two residues near the exosite are not involved in contacts of thrombin with the hirudin peptide and, therefore, cannot account for the lower affinity of the peptides for the two species (40.Skrzypczak-Jankun E. Carperos V.E. Ravichandran K.G. Tulinsky A. Westbrook M. Maraganore J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 1379-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 42.Bode W. Huber R. Rydel T.J. Tulinsky A. Berliner L.J. in Thrombin Structure and Function. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1992: 3-61Google Scholar). However, Lys149e in the autolysis loop of human thrombin is thought to promote peptide binding by contributing to the positive electrostatic field of exosite I, a process that cannot occur in bovine thrombin because this residue is Glu (38.Vitali J. Martin P.D. Malkowski M.G. Robertson W.D. Lazar J.B. Winant R.C. Johnson P.H Edwards B.F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17670-17678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human and bovine thrombin complexes with hirugen also differ in the interactions of Asp55 of the peptide with the important exosite I residue, Arg73 of thrombin, which forms a strong salt link in the human thrombin complex that is absent from the bovine thrombin structure (39.Vitali J.

The observed differences in the environment of the fluorescence probe in complexes with [5F]Hir54–65(SO3−) and the lower affinity of bovine prothrombin and thrombin with respect to exosite I interactions can be explained by this combination of structural differences between proteins of the two species. The results demonstrate that this species-specific difference is maintained with a similar magnitude for the proexosite and the activated exosite. In the following paper the characteristics of proexosite I interactions with hirudin peptides described here were used as a basis for evaluating the role of proexosite I in macromolecular interactions of prothrombin with factor Va in prothrombin activation.

To systematically isolate and characterize these snoRNAs, the T. brucei cDNA for the box C/D snoRNA common protein, fibrillarin, was cloned and polyclonal antibodies to the recombinant fibrillarin protein were generated in rabbits. Immunoprecipitations from T. bruceiextracts with the anti-fibrillarin antibodies indicated that this trypanosomatid has at least 30 fibrillarin-associated snoRNAs. We have sequenced seventeen of them and designated them TBR for T . b rucei RNA 1–17. All of them bear conserved box C, D, C′, and D′ elements, a hallmark of fibrillarin-associated snoRNAs in eukaryotes. Fourteen of them are novel T. brucei snoRNAs. Fifteen bear potential guide regions to mature rRNAs suggesting that they are involved in 2′-O-ribose methylation. Indeed, eight ribose methylations have been mapped in the rRNA at sites predicted by the snoRNA sequences. Comparative genomics indicates that six of the seventeen are the first trypanosome homologs of known yeast and vertebrate methylation guide snoRNAs. Our results indicate that T. brucei has many fibrillarin-associated box C/D snoRNAs with roles in 2′-O-ribose methylation of rRNA and that the mechanism for targeting the nucleotide to be methylated at the fifth nucleotide upstream of box D or D′ originated in early eukaryotes.

In yeast and metazoans the rRNA precursor is processed into the mature 18 S, 5.8 S, and 28 S (25 S in yeast) rRNAs of the ribosome (1.Eichler D.C. Craig N. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol.

In trypanosomes, however, the large subunit rRNA (28 S) is further processed into six rRNAs, called 28 Sα, 28 Sβ, sr1, sr2, sr4, and sr6 (3.White T.C. Rudenko G. Borst P.

These processing steps are not peculiar to trypanosomes because Euglena gracilis, which shares a common ancestor with trypanosomatids, also contains a multiply fragmented 28 S rRNA (6.Schnare M.N.

It has been hypothesized that the origin of contiguous high molecular weight rRNAs started from an ancient ribosome that consisted of primarily fragmented rRNAs (4.Spencer D.F. Collings J.C.

There are two major classes of snoRNAs that are named for specific conserved nucleotide sequences: box C/D and box H/ACA snoRNAs (23.Balakin A. Smith L. Fournier M. Cell. 1996; 86: 823-834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). In yeast, the box C/D snoRNAs are characterized by their association with the nucleolar proteins fibrillarin, Nop5/Nop58, and Nop56 (and perhaps other proteins, 24, 25–29) 2D. Lafontaine and T. Tollervey, personal communication. in small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins. Of the 41 box C/D snoRNAs predicted to function in 2′-O-ribose methylation of rRNA in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, 37 have been experimentally confirmed (30.Lowe T.M. Eddy S.R.

Only four other known box C/D snoRNAs in yeast perform other functions (U3) or have no assigned function (snR190, snR4, and snR45). Many of the vertebrate box C/D snoRNAs are also required for site-specific rRNA 2′-O-ribose methylation (31.Kiss-Laszlo Z. Henry Y. Bachellerie J.P. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Kiss T.

RNA (NY). 1998; 4: 195-204PubMed Google Scholar). However, the vertebrate U3, U22, and U8 box C/D snoRNAs are required for pre-rRNA cleavage events (36.Hughes J.M.X. Ares Jr., M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4231-4239Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 37.Kass S. Tyc K. Steitz J.A. Sollner-Webb B.

Cell. 1993; 73: 1233-1245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The U14 snoRNA is unusual in that it is the only box C/D snoRNA shown so far to function in both 18 S rRNA maturation and 18 S rRNA nucleotide modification (35.Dunbar D.A. Baserga S.J. RNA (NY). 1998; 4: 195-204PubMed Google Scholar, 41.Li D. Fournier M.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 42.Enright C.A. Maxwell E.S. Eliceiri G.L. Sollner-Webb B.

The box C/D snoRNAs involved in nucleotide modification, also called methylation guide RNAs, are characterized by the presence of conserved box C and D sequences near their 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. The methylation guide RNAs also often bear internal box D′- and box C′-sequences (44.Kiss-Laszlo Z. Henry Y. Kiss T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 797-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 45.Tycowski K. Shu M.D. Steitz J.A. Nature. 1996; 379: 464-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Most methylation guide RNAs have a single region of complementarity to mature rRNA regions upstream from their box D or D′ sequences; however, some of them contain two complementary sequences and are referred to as double methylation guide RNAs. Results from several laboratories suggest that the fifth nucleotide upstream of the box D or D′ sequence, within the complementary sequence, specifies the ribose of the nucleotide to be methylated in the target rRNA (31.Kiss-Laszlo Z. Henry Y. Bachellerie J.P. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Kiss T. Cell. 1996; 85: 1077-1088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar, 32.Cavaille J. Nicoloso M. Bachellerie J.P.

Investigation of functional constraints on the guide RNA-rRNA duplex indicates that both the length and composition of the complementary sequence influence the extent of the methylation reaction (46.Cavaille J. Bachellerie J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1576-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Our current understanding of the trypanosomatid snoRNAs involved in ribosome biogenesis is just beginning to emerge. Previous studies revealed the existence of a U3 homolog in Trypanosoma brucei(47.Mottram J. Perry K.L. Lizardi P.M. Luhrmann R. Agabian N. Nelson R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1212-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 48.Hartshorne T. Agabian N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 144-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 49.Hartshorne T. Agabian N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3354-3364Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 50.Hartshorne T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2541-2553Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The first methylation guide box C/D snoRNA in trypanosomes was described by Levitan et al. (51.Levitan A. Xu Y. Ben-Dov C. Ben-Shlomo H. Zhang Y. Michaeli S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1775-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) who determined that it has the potential to guide methylation of a 5.8 S rRNA nucleotide. Two additional box C/D snoRNAs from Leishmania tarentolae, Trypanosoma cruzi, and T. brucei were identified by Roberts et al. (52.Roberts T.G. Sturm N.R. Yee B.K. Michael C.Y. Hartshorne T. Agabian N. Campbell D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4409-4417Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, it is clear from the work of Hartshorne and Agabian (48.Hartshorne T. Agabian N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 144-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) that T. brucei has many more fibrillarin-associated snoRNAs. The identity of the other fibrillarin-associated snoRNAs in T. brucei remains unknown. A comparison of the box C/D snoRNA sequences from such widely divergent species as trypanosomes, yeast, and vertebrates is likely to yield important information about the evolution of ribosome biogenesis, particularly with reference to pre-rRNA cleavage and 2′-O-ribose methylation. We reasoned that the box C/D snoRNAs in T. brucei could be isolated and sequenced by enrichment via immunoprecipitation with anti-fibrillarin antibodies; however, antibodies specific to the T. brucei fibrillarin are not available and antibodies that cross-react are scarce. To identify the box C/D snoRNAs in trypanosomes in a systematic way, we cloned the T. brucei fibrillarin cDNA and determined that it bears both the glycine- and arginine-rich (GAR) and methyltransferase domains present in fibrillarins characterized in other eukaryotes. We expressed the T. brucei fibrillarin inEscherichia coli and purified it and then used the recombinant protein to generate polyclonal antibodies in rabbits. Immunoprecipitation experiments on T. brucei extracts using the anti-fibrillarin antibodies indicated that trypanosomes contain at least thirty fibrillarin-associated snoRNAs. Seventeen of them were sequenced and designated TBR for T . b rucei RNA 1–17. Their sequences and mapping of the methylation sites in the rRNA revealed that, like in yeast and metazoans, many have the potential to be guide RNAs for 2′-O-ribose methylation of rRNA, suggesting that the box C/D snoRNAs existed in early eukaryotes. Interestingly, six of them appear to be homologs of methylation guide snoRNAs found in yeast and vertebrates. This implies that the mechanism of specifying the methylation site in rRNA has been conserved from an ancient eukaryote. The procyclic form of Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense YTaT1.1 strain obtained from Elisabetta Ullu (Yale University School of Medicine) was used in this study. Cells were grown at 28 °C in SM medium supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum (53.Cunningham I. J. Protozool. 1977; 24: 325-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). The fibrillarin protein from a related trypanosomatid, Leishmania major, has been cloned and sequenced (54.Cappai R. Osborn A.H. Handman E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 64: 353-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). We used this sequence to search the EST data base for related T. brucei sequences and identified a candidate partial clone in T. brucei rhodesiense (accession number W00261). A cDNA clone representing this expressed sequence tag was made in the following way. Reverse transcription on totalT. brucei RNA was performed with Tbfib.1 (5′-GGACAAAAATGCGAGGTGGG). A double-stranded product was synthesized using the single-stranded cDNA as template in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with Tbfib.1 and Tbfib.2 (CTACTTCTACACGCTTTCCCG) as primers. The PCR product was cloned into the TA cloning vector, PCRII (Invitrogen). A radiolabeled probe for library screening was synthesized by performing PCR in the presence of [32P]dCTP with Tbfib.1 and Tbfib.2 as primers. This fibrillarin fragment was used to screen a T. brucei rhodesiense cDNA library (from strain YTAT1.1) cloned into Lambda Zap (Stratagene). The library was kindly provided by Elisabetta Ullu, Yale School of Medicine. Library filters were hybridized to the labeled probe in 50% formamide (Hybrisol I, Oncor) at 42 °C. Filters were washed once in 2× SSC 0.05% SDS at room temperature for 1 h and twice in 1× SSC 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 1 h each wash. Inserts from phage giving positive signals were plaque purified, and plasmids recovered according to the manufacturer's instructions (yields an insert in a Bluescript plasmid). Automated DNA sequencing of one positive clone was carried out on an Applied Biosystems 373 Stretch sequencer by primer walking of both strands. The polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify the full-length fibrillarin cDNA with the appropriate restriction sites for cloning in frame into the E. coli expression vector pET28a (Novagen). This vector places a 6X histidine tag on the amino terminus of the protein. The 5′-oligonucleotide contains the first 23 nt of the fibrillarin sequence and also a 5′-BamHI site (Tbfib.3, 5′-CCGCGGATCCATGCGAGGTGGGTTTGGACG). The 3′-oligonucleotide is complementary to the last 15 nucleotides and has an AvaI site (Tbfib.4, 5′-GTCAGGCTCGAGACATTATTATTGTTGTACTGC). These oligonucleotides were used in the polymerase chain reaction with the fibrillarin plasmid as a template with these cycling steps: 94, 55, and 72 °C (15 s each, 20 cycles). The product was purified by ethanol precipitation, digested with BamHI and AvaI, and the resulting band was gel-purified. This fragment was ligated into BamHI, and XhoI cut pET28a. The fibrillarin cDNA cloned into pET28a was transformed into BL21 (DE3) cells for expression and protein purification. Partial solubility of the fibrillarin protein was obtained when the cells were induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and grown overnight at 30 °C. The resulting soluble protein was purified by metal chelation chromatography and eluted from the column with 1m imidazole. The fibrillarin protein, insoluble upon elution, was dialyzed overnight into phosphate-buffered saline prior to injection into rabbits. Injections were performed by Immunization Services at the Yale School of Medicine. The sera were checked for reactivity with fibrillarin expressed in E. coli by Western blot analysis. For anti-fibrillarin immunoprecipitation experiments, 3 mg of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was mixed with 50 μl of either rabbit anti-fibrillarin or preimmune serum in 0.5 ml of NET-2 (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40) overnight at 4 °C on a rotating nutator. The bound antibodies were washed four times with cold NET-2 and used as described below. For anti-trimethylguanosine (TMG) experiments, 15 μl of anti-TMG antibody and 15 μl of rabbit anti-mouse IgG were mixed with protein A-Sepharose and then incubated and washed in NET-2 as described above. T. brucei cells were grown to a density of 2–3 × 107 cells/ml. Cells from a 50-ml culture were pelleted and resuspended in 10 ml of wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl pH, 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2). Cells were repelleted and resuspended in 0.6 ml of either NET-2, NET-5, NET-6, or NET-7 containing protease inhibitors (2 μg of aprotinin/ml, 1 μg of leupeptin/ml, and 1 μg of pepstatin A/ml). NET-5, 6, and 7 are the same as NET-2 except that they contain either 500, 600, or 700 mm NaCl, respectively. Cells were lysed by vigorous vortexing with one-half volume of glass beads (0.45–0.5-mm diameter) for five minutes. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The cleared lysate containing either 150, 500, 600, or 700 mm NaCl was added to the protein A-Sepharose beads treated with either rabbit anti-fibrillarin serum, preimmune serum, or anti-TMG antibodies and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C on a rotating nutator. The beads were washed six times with either NET-2, -5, -6, or -7 buffer. RNA was recovered by adding 300 μl of NET-2 to beads and extraction with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol and ethanol precipitation. Immunoprecipitated RNAs were labeled with 5′-[32P]cytidine 3′,5′-bisphosphate and T4 RNA ligase according to Ref. 55.England T.E. Bruce A.G. Uhlenbeck O.C. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar and separated on a 10% sequencing gel. For direct RNA sequencing, immunoprecipitations and 3′-end labeling of snoRNAs were performed as described above. Individual labeled snoRNAs were gel-isolated and eluted in 0.5 m ammonium acetate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 0.1% SDS overnight at room temperature on a rotating nutator. Approximately 30 nt of the 3′-end sequence of labeled RNAs was obtained by enzymatic sequencing using RNases T1, U2, PhyM, and Bacillus cereus(Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Full-length cDNAs were obtained using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 32P-labeled deoxyoligomer primers complementary to the 3′-ends of snoRNA sequences (see Table I). RNA was isolated from an anti-fibrillarin immunoprecipitation performed on 50 ml of T. brucei cells and used for individual primer extension reactions to generate full-length cDNAs. These cDNAs were gel-eluted and poly(A)-tailed in 25 μl of buffer containing 0.1 mpotassium cacodylate (pH 7.2), 20 mm CoCl2, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm dATP, and 15 units of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 1 h at 37 °C. The poly(A)-tailed cDNAs were extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol and ethanol-precipitated. The poly(A)-tailed cDNAs were amplified using a (dT) oligomer and the 3′-oligomer by PCR with these cycling steps: 94, 55, and 72 °C (30 s each, 30 cycles). The PCR products were cloned using theCLONTECH TA-cloning kit and sequenced using an Applied Biosystems 373 Stretch sequencer.Table IOligonucleotides used to clone the T. brucei snoRNAsThe 5′-oligos were used to identify snoRNA 3′-ends, and the 3′-oligos were used to identify snoRNA 5′-ends. See text for descriptions of both the 5′- and 3′-snoRNA cloning strategies. Open table in a new tab The 5′-oligos were used to identify snoRNA 3′-ends, and the 3′-oligos were used to identify snoRNA 5′-ends. See text for descriptions of both the 5′- and 3′-snoRNA cloning strategies. The sequences of the 3′-ends were verified independently. Adenosine nucleotides were added to the 3′-ends of total snoRNAs isolated from an anti-fibrillarin immunoprecipitation experiment with 5 units of poly(A) polymerase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 50 μl containing 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm MnCl2, 250 mm NaCl, 250 μm ATP, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin for 30 min at 37 °C. The 3′-poly(A)-tailed RNAs were extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol and ethanol-precipitated. Full-length cDNAs complementary to the poly(A)-tailed RNAs were made with a (dT) oligomer and Superscript II reverse transcriptase. Aliquots of the primer extension reaction were then used to amplify individual snoRNAs by PCR using a (dT) oligomer and an oligomer containing the 5′-sequence specific for a particular snoRNA using the cycling conditions described above (Table I). The PCR products were cloned and sequenced as described above. To isolate T. brucei total RNA, a 50-ml culture of cells grown to a density of 2–3 × 107 cells/ml was pelleted and resuspended in wash buffer. Cells were repelleted and resuspended in 250 μl of solution D (4 m guanidinium thiocyanate, 26.4 mm sodium acetate, pH 7.0, 0.5% sarcosyl, 0.72% β-mercaptoethanol). The lysed cells were extracted with an equal volume of acid phenol and 50 μl of chloroform and precipitated with three volumes of ethanol. RNA from an anti-TMG cap immunoprecipitation and an anti-fibrillarin immunoprecipitation were resolved with total RNA on a 10% sequencing gel and transferred to a Zeta-probe membrane. Plasmids containing the TBR17 snoRNA clone and a plasmid containing theT. brucei U4 small RNA were used in PCR reactions with clone-specific primers and [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) to make labeled probes. Blots were hybridized to 1 × 107 cpm of labeled probes in 5× saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA, 10× Denhardt's solution, 7% SDS at 65 °C. Blots were washed twice in 3× SSC 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 15 min each wash and once in 3× SSC 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 10 min and exposed to x-ray film. The ribose methylation mapping protocol was modified from Ref. 56.Maden B.E. Corbett M.E. Heeney P.A. Pugh K. Ajuh P.M. Biochimie (Paris). 1995; 77: 22-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar. Oligonucleotides complementary to rRNA 3′ to sites of predicted 2′-0-ribose methylation were synthesized. T. brucei total RNA (7 μg) was annealed to 15 ng of the 32P-labeled oligonucleotides for 10 min at 70 °C. Primer extension reactions were carried out in 20 μl of a buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.5, 8 mm MgCl2, 30 mmKCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol in the presence of 0.5 units/μl avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with either 1 mm dNTPs/μl or 0.004 mm dNTPs/μl for 1 h at 42 °C. The extension products were resolved on an 8% sequencing gel next to an RNA sequencing ladder. For generation of RNA sequencing ladders, 5 μg ofT. brucei total RNA was hybridized to 15 ng of labeled oligonucleotide for 10 min at 70 °C. Dideoxy RNA sequencing was performed in a 20-μl reaction using 10 units/μl Superscript II reverse transcriptase, 1 mm dNTPs/μl and 1 mmof the appropriate ddNTP at 42 °C for 1 h. A radiolabeled short fragment (600 nt) of the putative T. brucei fibrillarin gene was used to screen a T. bruceicDNA library to obtain the full-length fibrillarin clone. The nucleotide and amino acid sequence are shown in Fig.1 A. The T. bruceifibrillarin is 300 amino acids long and has a predicted molecular mass of 31.7 kDa. The T. brucei fibrillarin is therefore among the shortest of the fibrillarins, the shortest being theTetrahymena fibrillarin at 292 amino acids (57.David E. McNeil J.B. Basile V. Pearlman R.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1051-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Like most of the other fibrillarins, the T. brucei fibrillarin has a GAR domain at its amino terminus (58.Henriquez R.G. Blobel G. Aris J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2209-2215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a potentialS-adenosylmethionine binding/methyltransferase domain (amino acids 141–157; 59, 60). Comparison of the T. bruceifibrillarin to the nine other known eukaryotic fibrillarins (Fig. 1,B and C) indicates a high degree of conservation. It is most identical to the fibrillarin of a related trypanosomatid,L. major, with 84% sequence identity; it is least similar to the Giardia lamblia fibrillarin with 47% identity. Fig.1 B indicates that the highest sequence conservation among fibrillarins occurs carboxyl-terminal to the GAR domain. Previous studies indicate that the human fibrillarin can restore growth to a S. cerevisiae strain with a null fibrillarin allele (Δnop1), though the strain is temperature-sensitive (61.Jansen R.P. Hurt E.C. Kern H. Lehtonen H. Carmo-Fonseca M. Lapeyre B. Tollervey D. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 715-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The human and S. cerevisiae fibrillarins are 60% identical/68% similar. We assessed whether the T. brucei fibrillarin, which is 53% identical/64% similar to the budding yeast fibrillarin, could restore growth at the nonpermissive temperature to strains with five temperature-sensitive fibrillarin alleles (nop1.2, nop1.3, nop1.4, nop1.5, and nop1.7; 62). The T. brucei fibrillarin cDNA was cloned into the yeast expression vector, p415GPD (63.Mumberg D. Muller R. Funk M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 156: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1603) Google Scholar), and transformed into the temperature-sensitive strains. Subsequent restreaking of the colonies and growth at both 22 and 37 °C indicated that the T. brucei fibrillarin does not complement these temperature-sensitive fibrillarin alleles (data not shown). This suggests that the T. brucei fibrillarin is too dissimilar to function in S. cerevisiae. It is also possible that theT. brucei fibrillarin cannot attain the correct cell compartment in yeast because its nuclear import/nucleolar targeting signals are different. The T. brucei fibrillarin was cloned into pET28a for expression in E. coli as a histidine-tagged fusion protein. When the cells were induced and grown at 37 °C, the fibrillarin protein is insoluble, and upon solubilization in 6 mguanidine, HCl does not bind to the metal chelation column. Growth at 30 °C allowed partial solubility, and the protein was purified under nondenaturing conditions. However, when fibrillarin was eluted from the metal chelation column it became insoluble and could be visualized in column fractions as a cloudy precipitate. Gel electrophoresis of this precipitate revealed a protein of the expected mobility (32 kDa). The cloudy precipitate was injected into rabbits for the production of antibodies. Sera from two rabbits were tested for reactivity with the fibrillarin produced in E. coli by Western blots, and one was chosen for further study. Immunoprecipitations were performed onT. brucei whole cell extracts with anti-fibrillarin polyclonal antibodies and compared with immunoprecipitations performed with preimmune serum at different salt concentrations (0.5–0.7m). RNAs from immunoprecipitations were labeled at their 3′-ends and resolved on a 10% polyacrylamide denaturing gel. Anti-fibrillarin antibodies immunoprecipitated at least thirty specific bands at all three sodium chloride concentrations (Fig.2, lanes 2, 4, and6). None of these RNAs were immunoprecipitated with preimmune serum, indicating that they result from co-immunoprecipitation with anti-fibrillarin antibodies (comparelanes 1 and 2, 3 and 4, and5 and 6).

The role of the pol δ accessory protein, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), on DNA replication by pol δ was also examined by kinetic analysis. The steady-state parameterk cat was similar for pol δ in the presence and absence of PCNA (0.36 and 0.30 min−1, respectively); however, the K m for dNTP was 20-fold higher in the absence of PCNA (0.067 versus 1.2 μm), decreasing the efficiency of nucleotide insertion. Pre-steady-state bursts of nucleotide incorporation were observed for pol δ in the presence and absence of PCNA (rates of polymerization (k pol) of 1260 and 400 min−1, respectively). The reduction in polymerization rate in the absence of PCNA was also accompanied by a 2-fold decrease in burst amplitude. The steady-state exonuclease rate of pol δ was 0.56 min−1(no burst, 103-fold lower than the rate of polymerization). The small phosphorothioate effect of 2 for correct nucleotide incorporation into DNA by pol δ·PCNA indicated that the rate-limiting step in the polymerization cycle occurs prior to phosphodiester bond formation.

We conclude that the major replicative mammalian polymerase, pol δ, exhibits kinetic behavior generally similar to that observed for several prokaryotic model polymerases, particularly a rate-limiting step following product formation in the steady state (dissociation of oligonucleotides) and a rate-limiting step (probably conformational change) preceding phosphodiester bond formation.

The other eukaryotic polymerases involved in eukaryotic genomic DNA replication are pol α and pol ε (1.Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. W. H. Freeman, New York1992Google Scholar). pol α is a moderately processive polymerase that is involved in synthesis of RNA-DNA and DNA-DNA primers on the leading and lagging strand (7.Ng L. Tan C.K. Downey K.M. Fisher P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11699-11704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). pol ε is required for DNA replication in vivo; however, it is not required for in vitro SV40 DNA replication, supporting the other proposed roles of pol ε in lagging strand synthesis, DNA repair, and cell cycle check point control (6.Hindges R.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 841-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). pol δ, therefore, has been identified as the enzyme involved in processive replication of the majority of the eukaryotic genome. Understanding the basic replication reaction by mammalian pol δ should aid in the elucidation of the mechanisms underlying the effects of other proteins or DNA structure on genomic DNA replication and repair. Eukaryotic pol δ is a heterodimer consisting of 125- and 50-kDa protein components (10.Lee M.Y.W.T. Tan C.K. Downey K.M. So A.G. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1906-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The larger subunit contains the catalytic domain as well as the 3′ → 5′ exonuclease site (11.Simon M. Giot L. Faye G. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2165-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 12.Lee M.Y.W.T. Jiang Y.Q. Zhang S.J. Toomey N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2423-2429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The smaller 50-kDa subunit is essential for the binding to and stimulation of pol δ by its accessory protein, PCNA (13.Zhou J.Q. He H. Tan C.K. Downey K.M. So A.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1094-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In the absence of PCNA, DNA pol δ is a relatively non-processive polymerase. The activity and processivity of pol δ is enhanced by PCNA up to 100-fold, and this characteristic has been used to distinguish pol δ from other mammalian DNA polymerases (14.Prelich G. Kotsura M. Marshak D.R. Mathews M.B. Nature. 1987; 326: 471-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 15.Tan C.K. Castillo C. So A.G. Downey K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12310-12316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mammalian PCNA is a trimeric protein that encircles the DNA and acts as a sliding clamp for pol δ (16.Jónsson Z.O. Hübscher U. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 967-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). With chromosomal or circular DNA, PCNA requires a clamp loading protein, RF-C, and hydrolysis of ATP to encircle the DNA, after which pol δ can associate with PCNA and DNA (6.Hindges R. Hübscher U. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 345-362Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RF-C dissociates from the pol δ·PCNA complex after PCNA encircles the DNA and is not thought to influence DNA synthesis by pol δ (8.Podust V.N. Tiwari N. Stephan S. Fanning E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31992-31999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). RF-C is not required for PCNA loading onto shorter primer/templates. The role of PCNA in pol δ replication is likely to be stabilization of the pol δ ·DNA interaction to maintain the processivity of the polymerase during genomic replication. PCNA has been reported to stabilize the pol δ·template-primer binary complex under static conditions by 3 orders of magnitude (17.McConnell M. Miller H. Mozzherin D.J. Quamina A. Tan C.K. Downey K.M. Fisher P.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8268-8274Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). PCNA also has been reported to affect the steady-state kinetics of nucleotide incorporation into poly(dA)·oligo(dT) primer/templates by pol δ by decreasing theK m (6-fold) and by increasing thek cat for dTTP incorporation by 2-fold (7.Ng L. Tan C.K. Downey K.M. Fisher P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11699-11704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Steady-state reactions involving DNA polymerases and oligomers are rather uninformative because k cat is dominated by the rate of enzyme release from DNA, the slowest step in the polymerization reaction (Fig. 1, step 7). Although the meaning of the steady-state K m (for dNTP) is unclear, the ratiok cat/K m can be used to evaluate the efficiency of nucleotide incorporation. Many DNA polymerases complete a single turnover reaction within 100 ms; therefore, pre-steady-state kinetic approaches are required to examine individual rate constants within the reaction cycle (Fig. 1). Pre-steady-state kinetics can provide a quantitative measure of the actual rate of polymerization phosphodiester bond formation and preceding steps (Fig. 1, steps 2–4) as well as dNTP and DNA binding constants. Such studies can be used to directly determine the kinetics of nucleotide insertion and effects of PCNA on replication by pol δ. In this study we successfully isolated and purified pol δ from fetal calf thymus in sufficient quantities for a detailed examination of steady-state and pre-steady-state kinetics of nucleotide incorporation into primer/template DNA. The use of pre-steady-state rapid quench kinetic analysis enabled examination the role of PCNA on the kinetics of nucleotide incorporation by pol δ. Primer and template oligonucleotides, poly(dA), and oligo(dT)12–18 were purchased from Midland Certified Reagent Co. (Midland, TX). The primer and template oligonucleotides were purified as described previously (19.Einolf H.J. Schnetz-Boutaud N. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13300-13312Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). First trimester fetal calf thymus was obtained from Pel-Freez (Rogers, AR), and protease inhibitors and phosphocellulose were purchased from Sigma. Heparin-Sepharose CL-6B, DEAE-Sephacel, phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B, and unlabeled Ultra Pure Grade dNTPs were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Uppsala, Sweden). The thio-substituted dNTPs, (S p)-αSdNTPs, were purchased from United States Biochemical Corp., and [γ- 32P]dATP and [3H]TTP were obtained from NEN Life Science Products. The bacterial expression vector pT7/PCNA (expressing human PCNA) was a generous gift of Dr. B. Stillman (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY) obtained from Prof. E. Fanning (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN). Hydroxylapatite was synthesized by dropwise addition of 0.5 m CaCl2(1.5 liters) into 0.5 m sodium phosphate, pH 6.6 (1.75 liters) with stirring. The mixture was stirred for an additional 1 h after all the reactants were combined, the precipitant was allowed to settle, and the liquid was decanted. H2O (3 liters, containing 20 μm phenolphthalein) was added to the precipitant, and NH4OH was added to keep the mixture basic. The hydroxylapatite suspension was boiled for 30 min and the liquid was decanted. The hydroxylapatite was washed six times with 3 liters of 5 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.6), washed once with 3 liters of H2O, and resuspended in 0.2 m potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) with 0.05% NaN3 for storage at 4 °C.

A 1-liter suspension of cells was induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside for 3 h and harvested by centrifugation (3000 × g, 15 min). The cells were resuspended in Buffer A containing 25 mm NaCl (Buffer A: 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1.0 mm DTT, 1.0 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaHSO3, 1.0 mm PMSF, 1.0 μg of aprotinin ml−1, and 1.0 μg of leupeptin ml−1) and then adjusted to 0.10 m NaCl. The cells were sonicated and centrifuged at 4 °C for 30 min at 41,000 × g. The supernatant was loaded onto a DEAE-Sephacel column (1.5 × 11 cm) equilibrated with Buffer A plus 0.10 m NaCl. The column was washed with the equilibration buffer and then eluted at 0.4 ml min−1 with a 200-ml linear gradient of 0.10–0.50 m NaCl in Buffer B (Buffer B: 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1.0 mm DTT, 1.0 mm EDTA, and 10 mmNaHSO3). The presence of PCNA in the fractions was determined by 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (21.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207129) Google Scholar, 22.Guengerich F.P.

Biochem. 1981; 118: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2501) Google Scholar). The PCNA-containing fractions were pooled, adjusted to 1.5 m NaCl, and loaded onto a phenyl-Sepharose column (1.5 × 11 cm) equilibrated with Buffer B containing 1.5m NaCl. The column was washed with the equilibration buffer and eluted at 0.5 ml min−1 with a 200-ml linear gradient decreasing from 1.5 m to 0 m NaCl in Buffer B. Fractions containing electrophoretically homogeneous PCNA were combined and concentrated using a Centriplus concentrator (Amicon, Beverly, MA). The concentration of PCNA was estimated by the calculated ε280 value of 17.7 mm−1cm−1. The activity of pol δ was monitored during its purification as described previously (24.Downey K.M. So A.G. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 84-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Aliquots (3 μl) of the fractions collected from the pol δ purification steps were added to 60 μl of a mixture containing poly(dA)·oligo(dT)12–18 (base ratio of 10:1, final A 260 0.023), 44 mmbis-Tris-HCl (pH 6.5), 44 μm dTTP (1 μCi of [3H]TTP), 6.6 mm MgCl2, 2.2% glycerol (v/v), 2.6 μg of BSA ml−1, and 57 nm PCNA. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 15 min and quenched with 2 ml of cold 5% Cl3CCO2H (w/v) containing 20 mmsodium pyrophosphate. The precipitated DNA was collected on Whatman GF/C glass fiber filters and washed with cold H2O and then with C2H5OH. The filters were dried, and the radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. pol δ was purified as referenced by Podust et al. (25.Podust V.N. Georgaki A. Strack B. Hübscher U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4159-4165Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) with modifications. Due to the relatively high reaction volumes of the rapid quench instrument used to measure pre-steady-state kinetics of nucleotide incorporation by pol δ (>2-fold higher than steady-state reactions), the purification procedure for pol δ was optimized for purity and high yield. pol δ was purified to homogeneity from fetal calf thymus by a series of chromatography and rapid dialysis steps, as described below. 2Relatively large amounts of pol δ were required for these pre-steady-state kinetic experiments. Methods for expression of either p125 (26.Zhou J.Q. Tan C.K. So A.G. Downey K.M. J. Biol.

An advantage to these heterologous expression systems is the absence of the inactive 116-kDa degradation product seen in thymus preparations (28.Zhang J. Chung D.W. Tan C.K. Downey K.M. Davie E.W. So A.G. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11742-11750Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, the expression levels in the baculovirus system are low and the purification scheme is nearly as complex as with the thymus preparation, so we elected to use fetal calf thymus as the source of our pol δ. All steps of the purification were performed at 4 °C and the entire procedure was done within 5 days each time in order to minimize deterioration. First trimester fetal calf thymus (750 g) was lysed in a Waring blender with 1.5 liters of Buffer C containing 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4 (Buffer C: 10% glycerol (v/v), 2 mmEDTA, 10 mm NaHSO3, 10 mmbenzamidine HCl, 0.5 mm PMSF, 1.0 mm DTT, 10 μg of leupeptin ml−1, 10 μg of aprotinin ml−1, 4 μg of antipain ml−1, 2 μg of pepstatin A ml−1, 10 μg of soybean trypsin inhibitor ml−1, and 1.0 μg oftrans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido(4-guanidino)butane (E64) ml−1). The lysate was centrifuged at 9000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was filtered through 4 layers of cheesecloth. The filtrate was batch-absorbed for 0.5–1 h to phosphocellulose gel (800 ml) that had been pre-cycled and equilibrated in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 10% glycerol (v/v), 2 mm EDTA, and 10 mm NaHSO3. The phosphocellulose was pelleted by centrifugation (1500 × g, 10 min) and resuspended in Buffer C containing 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4) and poured into a 5-cm diameter column. The column was washed with Buffer C containing 100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4) at a flow rate of 1.25 ml min−1, and the polymerase was eluted by isocratic elution with Buffer C containing 350 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4). Active fractions were combined and dialyzed against 10 liters of a buffer containing 10% glycerol (v/v), 10 mmNaHSO3, 1.0 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm PMSF, and 1.0 mm DTT (pH 7.5) for 1 h and then dialyzed against a fresh 10 liters of the same buffer for an additional 1 h. The dialyzate was loaded onto a heparin-Sepharose column (1.5 × 17 cm) equilibrated in Buffer D (Buffer D: 20 mmpotassium phosphate (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol (v/v), 1.0 mmEDTA, 10 mm NaHSO3, 0.5 mm PMSF, 1.0 mm DTT, 10 μg of leupeptin ml−1, and 10 μg of aprotinin ml−1) at a flow rate of 1.25 ml min−1. The column was washed with Buffer D containing 0.10m NaCl and eluted at a flow rate of 0.3 ml min−1 with a 300-ml linear gradient of 0.10 mto 0.70 m NaCl in Buffer D. The polymerase activity in the fractions was determined in the absence and presence of PCNA. The fractions that showed the most stimulation by PCNA were combined and dialyzed against 10 liters of 20% glycerol (v/v), 0.5 mmPMSF, and 1.0 mm DTT (pH 7.0) for 1 h. The protein was then dialyzed against a fresh 10 liters of 20% glycerol (v/v), 0.5 mm PMSF, and 1.0 mm DTT (pH 7.0) for an additional 1 h. The dialyzate was loaded (1 ml min−1) onto a hydroxylapatite column (1 × 19 cm) equilibrated with Buffer E containing 20 mm KCl (Buffer E: 20 mmpotassium phosphate (pH 7.0), 20% glycerol (v/v), 0.5 mmPMSF, and 1.0 mm DTT). The column was washed with Buffer E containing 20 mm KCl and eluted (isocratically) with Buffer E containing 600 mm KCl. Activity of pol δ was assayed in a volume twice the reaction volume to dilute the KCl in the reaction (high concentrations of KCl are known to interfere with pol δ activity). 3C.-K. Tan, personal communication. The fractions containing the greatest PCNA-stimulated activity were combined and dialyzed against 10 liters of 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 10% glycerol (v/v), 0.5 mm PMSF, 1.0 mm EDTA, and 1.0 mm DTT for 1 h. The protein was then dialyzed for an additional 1 h with a fresh 10 liters of dialysis buffer. The protein was loaded onto a DEAE-Sephacel column (1 × 13 cm) equilibrated in Buffer F (50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 1.0 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol (v/v), 0.5 mm PMSF, and 1.0 mm DTT) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml min−1. The column was washed with Buffer F, and the polymerase was eluted with a 120-ml linear gradient of 0–500 mm NaCl in Buffer F. The fractions containing the greatest PCNA-stimulated activity were combined and dialyzed for 1 h against 10 liters of Buffer G containing 15 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0 (Buffer G: 10% glycerol (v/v), 10 mmNaHSO3, 0.5 mm PMSF, and 1.0 mmDTT). The protein was then dialyzed for another 1 h with a fresh 10 liters of the dialysis buffer. The polymerase was loaded onto a hydroxylapatite column (1 × 6 cm) equilibrated in Buffer G containing 15 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0. The column was washed with the equilibration buffer, and pol δ was eluted with a 50-ml linear gradient of 15–200 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) in Buffer G. Fractions containing purified pol δ were combined and concentrated with a Centriplus concentrator and stored in small aliquots at −70 °C. pol δ was purified from contaminating polymerases and other proteins to yield the p125 and p50 subunits and to a 116-kDa degradation product of p125 (28.Zhang J. Chung D.W. Tan C.K. Downey K.M. Davie E.W. So A.G. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11742-11750Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). This degradation product has been seen for other preparations of pol δ from tissue (7.Ng L. Tan C.K. Downey K.M. Fisher P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11699-11704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,28.Zhang J. Chung D.W. Tan C.K. Downey K.M. Davie E.W. So A.G.

The amount of pol δ was determined by quantitative amino acid analysis of the individual polypeptides of pol δ in the Vanderbilt facility. The individual subunits of pol δ were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2), transferred onto a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane, and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue 250 (30.LeGendre N. Manfield M. Weiss A. Matsudaira P. Matsudaira P. A Practical Guide to Protein and Peptide Purification for Microsequencing. Academic Press, San Diego1993: 71-101Crossref Google Scholar); the bands corresponding to each subunit were excised and submitted for quantitative amino acid analysis, with calculations based on amino acid composition. The amount of loss of protein during the gel and transfer was determined by quantitation of the amount of total protein before loading onto the gel and comparison. A typical yield from a preparation beginning with 750 g of thymus was 80 μg of total protein, containing 100 pmol of the limiting subunit (typically p125) as determined by quantitative amino acid analysis. Typical rate enhancement of final pol δ preparations by PCNA was 30–70-fold in the standard assay with poly(dA)·oligo(dT) (see above). Oligonucleotide primers were 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]dATP (3000 Ci mmol−1) and T4 polynucleotide kinase and annealed to the template in a ratio of 1:1.5 (primer:template) (19.Einolf H.J. Schnetz-Boutaud N. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13300-13312Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar).

The reactions were initiated with the addition of an equal volume of Buffer H (50 mm bis-Tris-HCl (pH 6.5) and 12.5 mm MgCl2) and dNTP (2× final concentration) at varying concentrations. Final concentrations were 50 mm bis-Tris-HCl (pH 6.5), 0.2 mg of BSA ml−1, 100 nm 24/36G-mer, 13 nm pol δ, 0.4 μm PCNA, 6 mm MgCl2, and 1.0 mm DTT in 10 μl. The reactions were run in triplicate at 37 °C and quenched with 20 μl of 20 mm EDTA (pH 7.4) after 10 min. The products were separated by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (16% acrylamide (w/v), 1.5% bisacrylamide (w/v), 8.0 m urea), and the amount of primer extended was quantitated utilizing a model 400E PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) and Image Software version 3.3. Thek cat and K m values were estimated by non-linear regression using a k·cat computer program (Biometallics, Princeton, NJ). The exonuclease rate of pol δ was determined in steady-state kinetic experiments. pol δ (26 nm), 200 nm 24/36G-mer, and 0.8 μm PCNA were incubated in a solution containing 50 mm bis-Tris-HCl (pH 6.5), 0.4 mg of BSA ml−1, and 2 mm DTT in 5 μl. An equal volume of a solution containing 12 mm MgCl2 and 50 mmbis-Tris-HCl (pH 6.5) was added to initiate the reaction. Final concentrations were 50 mm bis-Tris-HCl (pH 6.5), 0.2 mg of BSA ml−1, 100 nm primer/template, 13 nm pol δ, 0.4 μm PCNA, 6 mmMgCl2, and 1.0 mm DTT. Reactions were run in triplicate at 37 °C and quenched with 20 μl of 20 mmEDTA (pH 7.4) after 20–300 s. Exonuclease products (23/36G-mer and 22/36G-mer) were quantitated as described above, and the exonuclease rate was determined by linear regression. Pre-steady-state rapid-quench experiments were performed utilizing a KinTek Quench Flow Apparatus (model RQF-3, KinTek Corp., Austin, TX). Reactions were initiated by rapid mixing of dNTP (in Buffer H) with a primer/template/pol δ solution (with or without PCNA) at 37 °C. The final concentrations of the reactants were 9.2–69 nm pol δ (on the basis of the limiting 125-kDa subunit of pol δ), 50 mmbis-Tris-HCl (pH 6.5), 6 mm MgCl2, 1.0 mm DTT, 180 nm PCNA, 0.2 mg of BSA ml−1, and 100 nm 24/36G-mer. The reactions were quenched with equal volumes of 0.6 m EDTA at times varying from 5 ms to 10 s. The products were analyzed as described for steady-state assays. The k pol (maximum rate of nucleotide incorporation) was determined by single-exponential analysis of a plot of ln(Pn −Pt) versus t to yield a line with slope −k obs , wherePn is the concentration of product at the end of the burst phase and Pt is the concentration of product at time t. Results were fit to the burst equationy = A(1 −e −kpt) +k ss t, where A = burst amplitude, kp = pseudo first order rate constant, t = time, and k ss = steady-state rate of nucleotide incorporation. The kinetic KddNTP value for dCTP binding to the pol δ·PCNA·24/36G-mer complex was estimated by pre-steady-state rapid-quench analysis. The dNTP concentration dependence of the pre-steady-state burst rate was examined by varying the concentration of dCTP and measuring the rate of dCTP incorporation by pol δ into 24/36G-mer duplex DNA. The values ofk pol were determined by single-exponential analysis as described above. The pre-steady-state rates were plotted against [dNTP], and the data were fit to the hyperbolak obs = [k pol[dNTP]/([dNTP] +K d)] to determine K d (31.Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25988-25997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TheK d values for pol δ binding to DNA or PCNA/DNA complexes were determined by pre-steady-state rapid quench analysis. DNA concentration was varied, and the changes in the burst amplitude were measured to determine K d for binding DNA or DNA/PCNA substrate. The K d was determined by fitting the data to the quadratic equation [E·D] = 0.5(K d + Et +Dt) − [0.25(K d +Et + Dt)2 −Et Dt ]1/2, whereEt = [total enzyme], Dt = [total DNA], and K d = dissociation constant for the reaction E + D ⇄E·D. The steady-steady kinetics of elongation of the 5′32P-labeled 24/36G-mer duplex DNA (TableI) to a 25/36G-mer product were measured by examining dCTP concentration dependence on the steady-state rate of incorporation using a large excess of 24/36G-mer (100 nm) relative to pol δ (13 nm) in the reactions. The concentration of pol δ used in the reactions was calculated on the basis of the amount of the limiting 125-kDa subunit of pol δ determined by quantitative amino acid analysis. The steady-state rate constant k cat was 0.36 min−1, which is an upper limit for the slowest step of single nucleotide incorporation in multiple turnover reactions. The steady-state KmdCTP was determined to be 0.067 μm. PCNA is known to increase the processivity of pol δ replication (14.Prelich G. Kotsura M. Marshak D.R. Mathews M.B. Nature. 1987; 326: 471-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar,15.Tan C.K. Castillo C. So A.G. Downey K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12310-12316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When PCNA was eliminated from the reactions, the steady-state rate constant remained similar to that of reactions containing PCNA,k cat 0.30 min−1, andK m increased 20-fold to"
https://openalex.org/W2045839437,"The pregenomic 35 S RNA of cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) belongs to the growing number of mRNAs known to have a complex leader sequence. The 612-nucleotide leader contains several short open reading frames (sORFs) and forms an extended hairpin structure. Downstream translation of 35 S RNA is nevertheless possible due to the ribosome shunt mechanism, by which ribosomes are directly transferred from a take-off site near the capped 5′ end of the leader to a landing site near its 3′ end. There they resume scanning and reach the first long open reading frame. We investigated in detail how the multiple sORFs influence ribosome migration either via shunting or linear scanning along the CaMV leader. The sORFs together constituted a major barrier for the linear ribosome migration, whereas the most 5′-proximal sORF, sORF A, in combination with sORFs B and C, played a positive role in translation downstream of the leader by diverting scanning ribosomes to the shunt route. A simplified, shunt-competent leader was constructed with the most part of the hairpin including all the sORFs except sORF A replaced by a scanning-inhibiting structure. In this leader as well as in the wild type leader, proper translation and termination of sORF A was required for efficient shunt and also for the level of shunt enhancement by a CaMV-encoded translation transactivator. sORF A could be replaced by heterologous sORFs, but a one-codon (start/stop) sORF was not functional. The results implicate that in CaMV, shunt-mediated translation requires reinitiation. The efficiency of the shunt process is influenced by translational properties of the sORF.

First, the 40 S subunit binds to the capped 5′ end of the mRNA; second, ribosomes translocate to the start codon by linear scanning; and third, the start codon is recognized (1.Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2789) Google Scholar, 2.Kozak M. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 234: 187-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar, 3.Merrick W.C. Hershey J.W.B. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 31-70Google Scholar). A number of ribosome- or RNA-associated protein factors are involved in cap recognition, removal of RNA secondary structure, and initiation complex formation (4.Pestova T.V. Hellen C.U. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 85-87Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The helix-destabilizing capacity of the scanning ribosome appears limited. Double-stranded regions with a free energy of less than −50 kcal/mol block the scanning process (5.Kozak M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5134-5142Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Besides secondary structure, alternative translation start sites could interfere with scanning. Since the composition of the scanning complex is altered upon translation initiation, most notably by “consumption” of the bound eIF2-GTP-initiator methionyl tRNA complex, it was long assumed that eukaryotic ribosomes can initiate only once on an mRNA. However, particularly after translation of a short ORF (sORF), at least a fraction of ribosomes can reinitiate translation on the same mRNA. How ribosomes regain initiation capacity, how they reach further downstream ORFs, and how all this is influenced by the nature of the first ORF is still unclear. In the yeast GCN4 system (6.Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21661-21664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar) and in in vitro systems (7.Kozak M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3438-3445Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar), reinitiation is distance-dependent, suggesting that a certain time is required to reestablish initiation competence. In GCN4, this time (translated to a scanning distance) was inversely correlated to the concentration of active eIF2. An increasing number of eukaryotic mRNAs have been detected with strong secondary structures and/or alternative start sites in their 5′-UTR, particularly those of transcription factors or protooncogenes (8.Willis A.E. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 73-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Alternative start sites may create short ORFs or N-terminally extended variants of the major ORF. Alternative start sites are not necessarily easily predictable, because “non-AUG” codons,i.e. codons deviating from AUG in one position, may act as start codons (e.g. Ref. 9.Gordon K. Fütterer J. Hohn T. Plant J. 1992; 2: 809-813PubMed Google Scholar), particularly in conjunction with downstream secondary structures that may pause scanning ribosomes (10.Kozak M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8301-8305Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). In general, complex 5′-UTRs have negative effects on translation efficiency and it has been argued that their function could be to down-regulate expression. However, such features may also be used for more subtle post-transcriptional control of gene expression, although only a few examples have been studied in any detail (6.Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol.

How the eukaryotic translation machinery negotiates complex 5′-UTRs is still far from being understood, even though a number of alternatives to the scanning process have been described. Direct binding to internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) was observed in many viruses and some cellular mRNAs (17.Jackson R.J. Kaminski A. RNA. 1995; 1: 985-1000PubMed Google Scholar). Entry points can be directly at the start codon or upstream of it, thus requiring a translocation step to the start codon. The other alternative to continuous scanning is the ribosome shunt, which leads to the bypass of scanning-inhibitory regions by direct transfer of ribosomal subunits between two RNA regions. Ribosome shunt has so far been described mainly for viral RNAs: cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) (18.Fütterer J. Gordon K. Sanfaçon H. Bonneville J-M. Hohn T.

University of Giessen, Giessen, Germany1996: 1-180Google Scholar). In most of these cases, viral factors are not required, even though they may enhance the process, suggesting that ribosome shunt is a normal, cellular mechanism and might also occur on cellular RNAs. Ribosome shunt combines the efficient binding of ribosomes through the mRNA cap and the versatility of internal ribosome entry. The mechanisms that allow 40 S ribosomes to bypass RNA regions are not understood. Here we describe analysis of some of the requirements for ribosome shunt on the leader of the CaMV 35 S RNA. This polycistronic RNA begins with a long leader of 612 nucleotides preceding ORF VII. The leader is inhibitory for the scanning process, because it contains up to nine AUGs creating sORFs, 2–35 codons in length (26.Pooggin M.M. Hohn T. Fütterer J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4157-4169Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and forms an extended central hairpin (27.Hemmings-Mieszczak M. Steger G. Hohn T. J. Mol.

Virology. 1998; 242: 403-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). It requires the formation of a stable stem section at the base of the central hairpin (stem section 1) (32.Dominguez D.I.

Steger G. Hohn T. RNA. 1998; 4: 101-111PubMed Google Scholar) and the presence of an sORF (sORF A) in front of this or a similar stable structure (19.Fütterer J. Kiss-László Z. Hohn T. Cell. 1993; 73: 789-802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 32.Dominguez D.I. Ryabova L.A. Pooggin M.M. Schmidt-Puchta W. Fütterer J. Hohn T. J. Biol.

The importance of sORF A has also been underscored by revertants obtained after infection of plants with CaMV mutants (26.Pooggin M.M. Hohn T. Fütterer J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4157-4169Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we investigated (i) combinatorial and individual effects of the sORFs in the CaMV leader on ribosome shunt and linear scanning along the leader and (ii) the effect of the CaMV-encoded transactivator of polycistronic translation, TAV (35.Bonneville J-M. Sanfaçon H. Fütterer J. Hohn T. Cell. 1989; 59: 1135-1143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 36.Fütterer J. Hohn T. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3887-3896Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), on shunt-mediated expression. The group of sORFs constituted a major inhibitory barrier for linear scanning, whereas the most 5′-proximal sORF A, in combination with sORFs B and C, alleviated this inhibition by diverting scanning ribosomes to the shunt route. Parameters of sORF A were further investigated in a simplified shunt-competent leader. In this leader mimicking the wild type CaMV leader, proper elongation and termination of sORF A were required for efficient ribosome shunt and also for the level of shunt enhancement by TAV. sORF A could be functionally replaced by heterologous, naturally occurring sORFs; however, a start/stop codon sequence was not functional. These results support a reinitiation model of the ribosome shunt. The “wild type” plasmid used in this study as a base-line control has been previously described as pLC20 (18.Fütterer J. Gordon K. Sanfaçon H. Bonneville J-M. Hohn T. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1697-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Its expression unit consists of (i) the fragment of the CaMV strain CM4–184 genome comprising the 35 S RNA promoter and the complete leader, (ii) a CAT reporter gene fused to the ORF VII AUG, and (iii) the CaMV terminator region. All point mutations were introduced into the leader sequence by the polymerase chain reaction ligation method (37.Galvez A.F. DeLumen B.O. Plant Mol. Biol. Rep. 1995; 13: 232-242Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The polymerase chain reaction primers and conditions used as well as the detailed description of the mutations removing all the sORFs have been published elsewhere (26.Pooggin M.M. Hohn T. Fütterer J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4157-4169Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sequences of various point mutations in sORF A are depicted in the corresponding figures. The mutant versions of the leader were subcloned from plasmid pV322 (26.Pooggin M.M. Hohn T. Fütterer J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4157-4169Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) into pLC20 using unique sites EcoRV and ClaI naturally occurring in the promoter and near the 3′ end of the leader, respectively. Two large deletions in the leader were made taking advantage of (i) new restriction sites XhoI and HindIII created by the point mutations of sORFs B and F, respectively, yielding delXH and its derivatives delXHMAtTG, delXHMAtaG, and A::F, which carry additional point mutations in sORF A; or (ii) the sites XhoI and ClaI, yielding delXC and its derivative delXCMAtaG lacking sORF A. In both cases, plasmid MALL+A, which contains sORF A in an otherwise AUG-free leader or its derivatives with the mutated sORF A (26.Pooggin M.M. Hohn T. Fütterer J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4157-4169Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was cut with the corresponding enzymes, the ends filled in with Klenow, and ligated. The simplified shunt-competent construct delXHKS was generated by replacing the XhoI-HindIII fragment of MALL+A with the desired oligonucleotides, such that theHindIII site was maintained. In the latter construct, newXhoI and AflII sites in front of sORF A and the KS sequence, respectively, were introduced by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (CAT54gAg and Cg113u), yielding KSXAHA. Disruption of stem section 1 in the latter construct or modifications in the sORF A region were performed by replacing theXhoI-AflII fragment with the corresponding oligonucleotides. Restoration of stem section 1 was carried out by replacing the HindIII-ClaI fragment with an oligonucleotide carrying the desired compensatory mutations. The Kozak stem in the center of the full-length leader was created by replacing the fragment between two BglII sites (positions 218 and 238) with the self-complementary oligonucleotide 5′-GATCggggcgcgtggtggcggctgcagccgccaccacgcgcccc-3′. Protoplasts were prepared from suspension cultures ofOrychophragmus violaceus and transfected with plasmid DNA by electroporation as described previously (28.Fütterer J. Gordon K. Pfeifer P. Sanfaçon H. Pisan B. Bonneville J.-M. Hohn T. Virus Genes. 1989; 3: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) with a few modifications. Briefly, 0.7 ml of protoplasts (about 2 × 106) were mixed with plasmids on ice, transferred to 0.4-cm electrode gap cuvettes (Bio-Rad), and electroporated by discharging 960 microfarads at 450 V and 200 ohms using the Bio-Rad Gene Pulser. After 20–24 h of incubation at 27 °C, protoplasts were harvested by centrifugation and protein extract prepared by three cycles of freezing and thawing in 200 μl of GUS extraction buffer (50 mmNaH2PO4 (pH 7.0), 10 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sarcosyl). 30-μl aliquots were immediately taken for reporter gene assays, or stored at −70 °C. CAT expression levels were determined using the Roche Molecular Biochemicals CAT enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit as recommended by the manufacturer. GUS activity was measured by a fluorimetric assay (38.Jefferson R.A. Burgess S.M. Hirsh D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8447-8451Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar). 10 μg of CAT plasmid was always cotransfected with 2.5 μg of GUS-expressing plasmid (pV594) to serve as an internal standard of transfection efficiency. For transactivation, 5 μg of plasmid pV374 expressing the TAV protein was also added. The latter plasmid has been previously described as pHELP7 (35.Bonneville J-M. Sanfaçon H. Fütterer J. Hohn T. Cell. 1989; 59: 1135-1143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). For each CAT construct, transfections were repeated at least three times in duplicate (± TAV) with new DNA preparations of independent clones and in new protoplast batches. Additional transfections were performed if deviations in the normalized CAT expression were more than 10% of the average value. It should be noticed that greater deviations (maximum 20%) were observed for constructs with scanning-mediated expression. We assume that varying cell parameters in different batches of protoplasts might differentially affect scanning- versus shunt-mediated expression that was set to 100% in all experiments. The influence of CaMV 35 S RNA leader variants on downstream translation was tested in transiently transfected protoplasts. Discrimination between translation by scanning or by shunting was achieved by insertion of a stable hairpin structure, “Kozak stem” or “KS” (5.Kozak M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5134-5142Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar), which has been used previously as an effective inhibitor of scanning in plant cells (36.Fütterer J. Hohn T. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3887-3896Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We also tested the influence of the CaMV-derived multifunctional protein, TAV, one of whose functions is to promote translational reinitiation on polycistronic mRNAs (36.Fütterer J. Hohn T. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3887-3896Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The transient expression level of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) ORF downstream of a wild type CaMV 35 S RNA leader was set to 100% (Fig.1, line 1). The removal of the start codons of all the sORFs in the leader by point mutations increased expression about 5-fold (line 2). Additional removal of the complete leader hairpin structure further increased expression, but only by a factor of 1.7 (line 4); the particularly stable base of the leader hairpin (stem section 1) contributes about two thirds of this structural inhibition of translation (line 3). These data indicate that the sORFs in the leader are the major inhibitory elements. The inhibitory effect of some of the individual sORFs was tested by reintroduction of their start codons. sORF D′ alone was not inhibitory, sORF E“ was only slightly inhibitory, and sORF F that overlaps ORF VII::CAT was stronger than the others (Fig.2 A, lines 4, 5, and 6, respectively). Inhibition by sORF combinations was not additive and not predictable. Combination of sORFs E” and F (line 7) was more inhibitory than E“ alone but less than F alone; addition of D′ to E” and F (line 8) created a greater inhibition, although D′ alone had had no effect at all. Addition of sORFs D, E, and E′ to the latter construct only slightly reduced expression (Fig.2 B, line 9). These data could be explained by analogy to the yeast GCN4 mRNA with distance-dependent reinitiation (39.Abastado J.P. Miller P.F. Hinnebusch A.G. New Biol. 1991; 3: 511-524PubMed Google Scholar); a fraction of ribosomes that resume scanning and reinitiate after translation of E“ would bypass the start codon of F because of the short intervening distance and thus the negative effect of the latter sORF is partially alleviated. In a similar way, after translation of D′, ribosomes can efficiently reinitiate at the CAT ORF, unless they are intercepted by the intervening sORFs. In the later cases, a potential second round of reinitiation (after sORFs D, E, E′, or E”) is probably inefficient. While individual readdition of the sORFs to the 3′ half of an otherwise AUG-free leader revealed their potential for translation inhibition, their individual removal from the wild type, sORF-containing leader had no effect on expression (data not shown), indicating that, in this context, the individual sORFs have no major influence on the expression level. This contrasts with the behavior of sORFs A, B, and C; removal of any of these sORFs individually or in combination reduced expression (constructs in Fig. 2 B, compared with wild type), suggesting that they alleviate the negative effect of the rest of the leader. sORF A removal had the most striking effect, decreasing expression 5-fold (line 12). The positive function of these sORFs was only detectable in the context of the wild type leader. In combination with other sORF mutations, individual sORFs A, B, and C could also display negative effects on overall expression (e.g. Fig. 2, pairs 16/2 or 15/9 for A, 11/10 for B, and 10/9 for C). Insertion of the KS into the center of the wild type leader had only a slight effect on downstream translation (Fig.2 A), confirming our previous observations (19.Fütterer J. Kiss-László Z. Hohn T. Cell. 1993; 73: 789-802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) and indicating that, in this case, translation mostly depends on shunt and only little scanning through the leader is allowed. In contrast, insertion of KS into an AUG-free leader or a leader lacking the sORFs A, B, and C greatly reduced expression (Fig. 2, lines 2 and 9 versus 1),i.e. in the absence of sORFs A, B, and C, most or all downstream translation depends on continuous, linear scanning and only a small proportion (if any) of the ribosomes perform a shunt. The presence of sORF A in the otherwise AUG-free leader allowed some ribosomes to overcome the KS barrier (Fig. 2 C,line 16 versus line 2), and the presence of sORFs A, B, and C completely restored shunting (line 17 versus line 1, with KS). In the absence of KS, translation from these mRNAs occurs by shunting and scanning. Comparison of mutants in one or several of the respective sORFs with and without KS revealed that removal of any of the first three sORFs increased the contribution of scanning to overall expression and reduced the proportion of shunting (Fig. 2 B). In the presence of the KS, the knock out mutation of sORF A (line 12) had the most drastic inhibitory effect on shunt-mediated translation (∼13-fold), while the individual mutations of sORFs B and C (lines 13 and 14) were less inhibitory (∼1.5- and 4-fold, respectively). Because of difficulties with quantification of the very low levels of reporter RNA obtained from transfected protoplasts (data not shown), we could not exclude that some mutations might affect RNA stability. However, the fact that the same combination of the sORF point mutations could have either positive or negative effects on expression, depending on the leader context and consequently on the mode of ribosome migration (Fig. 2, compare lines 1 and2, in the absence or presence of KS), suggests that mainly the rate and/or the mechanism of translation initiation are affected. Previously, it has been shown (29.Schmidt-Puchta, W., Dominguez, D., Lewetag, D., and Hohn, T. (1997) 25, 2854–2860Google Scholar) that in a shunt-competent wheat germ extract the CAT transcripts containing the wild type CaMV leader without or with the Kozak stem (see Fig. 2, line 1) were as stable as the leader-less CAT transcript. This also supports that neither the CaMV sORFs nor the Kozak stem sequence represent instability determinants. These results show that sORFs can fundamentally alter the translation properties of an mRNA not just by regulating the initiation capacity of ribosomes but also by changing the mode how ribosomes access the internal mRNA regions. sORF A was confirmed as a major determinant of efficient ribosome shunting, but its effects are influenced by the more internal sORFs B and C. The CaMV transactivator TAV acts by enhancing the reinitiation potential of ribosomes that have already translated one ORF (36.Fütterer J. Hohn T. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3887-3896Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Here, TAV was found to enhance expression downstream of the 35 S RNA leader by a factor of 2–3 in all cases involving significant ribosome shunting (Fig. 2, seeInterpretation column), allowing expression levels approaching 30% of the maximal translation potential; the latter can be deduced from the reference construct lacking all inhibitory elements (Fig. 1, line 4). Scanning-mediated expression was influenced not at all or much less. When an RNA is translated by both mechanisms, the shunting-dependent fraction is activated by TAV whereas the scanning-dependent fraction is hardly influenced (Fig.2 C, line 17). Shunt requires sORF A and thus all constructs showing a strong effect of TAV contain this sORF. When the start codon was mutated to UAG (Fig. 2 B,line 12), downstream translation occurred only by scanning and TAV had at most a small effect; however, with the non-AUG codon UUG, a small amount of shunting is apparent in the presence of TAV (Fig. 2 B, line 11, +KS), suggesting that the UUG is active as a start codon in this context. TAV may function in restoring, at least partially, the initiation capacity of shunting ribosomes that have translated sORF A. For scanning-dependent reinitiation after sORF A translation, this function might not be required because the distance in the leader is long enough to acquire reinitiation capacity during the scanning process (e.g. Fig. 2, line 16). The data presented so far provide strong evidence that sORF A is translated. To investigate how efficiently ribosomes recognize the sORF A start codon, we fused sORF A in the short leader containing only stem section 1 to the AUG-less remnants of sORF F, which overlap the ORFVII::CAT for 35 nucleotides (Fig. 3, line 2). The mutation drastically reduced expression, suggesting that only a small proportion of scanning ribosomes skips the sORF A AUG start codon. As a control, additional mutation of the latter AUG to UAG fully derepressed translation (line 3). To study the specific role of sORF A and TAV in shunting, the complexity of translation events on the reporter RNA was reduced by replacement of the upper part of the leader hairpin (including all other sORFs) with the much shorter but energy-rich Kozak stem (Fig.4 A). In this simpler expression unit, CAT translation was almost completely dependent on the presence of sORF A. Expression levels, the effects of sORF A start codon mutations to UAG or UUG (see Fig.5 A, line 8), and the response to TAV were similar to those observed with the wild type leader (Fig. 4 A), suggesting that in both cases shunting occurs. This similarity was maintained only when the KS was present and stem section 1 intact. In the absence of KS, sORF A exhibited a 2.5-fold inhibition (Fig. 4 B), indicating that the respective RNA is translated mainly by scanning. In the presence of KS, disruption of stem section 1 by multiple point mutations (Fig.4 C) completely abolished expression as expected for a strictly scanning-dependent mRNA with a KS element. Restoration of stem section 1 by compensatory mutations on the descending arm restored expression, albeit not fully, and effective response to TAV (Fig. 4 C), which is consistent with our previous results for the full-length CaMV leader (32.Dominguez D.I.

Variations in the functional properties of Hb result partly from variations in molecular structure that determine the intrinsic O2 binding properties (1.Weber R.E. Comp. Physiol. 1990; 6: 58-75Google Scholar) and partly from regulatory changes in the physicochemical conditions under which they operate in vivo, such as red cell pH (that varies with ventilation rate and catecholamine stimulation) and in the type and concentration of heterotropic effectors like organic phosphates that decrease Hb-O2 affinity (2.Nikinmaa M.

In addition to “anodic” Hbs (HbAn) that migrate anodically under normal electrophoretic conditions (pH ∼8.6) and have relatively low O2 affinities and marked Bohr effects (decreased O2 affinity that enhances O2 release in the acid tissues) and Root effects (reduction in O2binding capacity upon acidification that induces O2unloading in the swim bladder and retina), many fish species express “cathodic Hbs” (HbCa) that have high isoelectric points and lack significant pH effects suggesting that they safeguard O2 transport to tissues under hypoxic and acidotic conditions (7.Powers D.A.

Previous studies on the physiological and molecular implications of Hb multiplicity in fish have been concentrated on only a few species, such as rainbow trout, Onchorhynchus mykiss,and the eel Anguilla anguilla that exhibit radical differences, indicating the existence of diverse molecular strategies among teleosts. Thus, whereas cathodic HbI of trout lacks a Bohr effect and is insensitive to phosphate effectors (10.Brunori M. Falcioni G. Fortuna G. Giardina B. Arch. Biochem.

Also, whereas the NTP pool of trout erythrocytes almost entirely consists of ATP, GTP is the main effector in eels, where it shows a greater effect on Hb-O2 affinity and greater decreases in concentration following hypoxic exposure than ATP (12.Weber R.E.

The absence of effects of peptides corresponding to N-terminal fragments of trout cd-B3 on O2 affinity of anodic trout HbIV, despite pronounced effects on human Hb (17.Jensen F.B. Jakobsen M.H. Weber R.E. J. Exp. Biol. 1998; 201: 2685-2690PubMed Google Scholar), calls for closer study of Hb-band 3 interaction in fish. Hoplosternum littorale, a small, heavily armored catfish from the Amazon basin, is an ideal model for investigating molecular adaptations in Hb function to extreme environmental conditions, bimodal breathing and modes of life. While using gills for gas exchange in well aerated water, it surfaces to swallow air in O2-deficient waters and has a thin-walled part of the intestine that is kept devoid of food and appears to be a site for aerial gas exchange (18.Carter G.S. Beadle L.C. J. Linn. Soc. (Lond.). 1931; 37: 327-368Google Scholar). The fish constructs floating nests of dead weed that expose the developing embryos to higher O2tensions than those prevailing in the water (18.Carter G.S. Beadle L.C. J. Linn. Soc. (Lond.). 1931; 37: 327-368Google Scholar). A further peculiarity is that its red cells contain the ”mammalian“ cofactor DPG as well as “piscine” effectors ATP and GTP in approximately equal concentrations and that the DPG levels vary with environmental temperature (19.Val A.L.

It has single anodic and cathodic Hbs (that exhibits and lacks a Root effect, respectively) and shows no evidence for polymorphism in Hb multiplicity (21.Garlick R.L. Bunn H.F. Fyhn H.J. Fyhn U.E.H.

In order to understand the structural and allosteric basis for its distinctive functional characteristics, we also analyzed the O2 equilibria of HbCa in terms of the two-state model for allosteric transitions (22.Monod J. Wyman J. Changeux J.-P. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (6149) Google Scholar), and we determined the primary structures of its globin chains. Adult H. littorale (65.Hancock J. Zool. J. 1828; 4: 240-247Google Scholar) (14–16 cm, 45–66 × g) locally known as tamoata were collected by throw net in the Solimoes river near Marchantaria, Brazil. Blood was taken in heparinized syringes from the caudal blood vessels. Saline-washed red cells were frozen at −80 °C until use. Hb was prepared as described previously (23.Weber R.E. Jensen F.B. Cox R.P. J. Comp. Physiol. 1987; 157: 145-152Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and dialyzed against 0.02m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.4 (at 5 °C). Electrophoresis on cellulose acetate strips revealed only two Hb components that were separated by anion exchange chromatography on a 27 × 2 cm DEAE-Sephacel column equilibrated with the dialysis buffer and eluted in a 0–0.1 m NaCl gradient. Separated fractions were dialyzed for 24 h against three changes of CO-equilibrated 0.01m HEPES, pH 7.7, containing 5·10−4m EDTA. All preparative steps were carried out at 0–5 °C. The Hb was frozen at −80 °C in 90–150-μl aliquots that were individually thawed immediately before experimentation. Stripped human Hb for control measurements was prepared as described previously (24.Weber R.E. J. Appl. Physiol. 1992; 72: 1611-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) from blood of a non-smoking adult. O2 binding equilibria were measured using a modified diffusion chamber, where ultrathin layers of Hb solution were equilibrated with pure (>99.998%) N2 or O2 or stepped mixes of these and air prepared with Wösthoff pumps to ensure full equilibration at each step (23.Weber R.E. Jensen F.B. Cox R.P. J. Comp. Physiol. 1987; 157: 145-152Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 25.Weber R.E. Nature. 1981; 292: 386-387Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The pH of Hb solutions was adjusted using HEPES buffers for pH ∼6.5–8.2, MES buffers for lower, and glycine buffer for higher pH values (final buffer concentration, 0.10 m). The pH was measured in oxygenated (air-equilibrated) Hb samples using a BMS2 Mk2 Blood Micro system and PHM 64 Research pH meter (Radiometer, Copenhagen, Denmark). Chloride was added as KCl and measured using a Radiometer CMT10 chloride titrator. ATP, GTP, and DPG concentrations in stock samples were assayed using Sigma test chemicals. The effects of anions on O2 equilibria were measured at pH near 7.5 and 7.0, whereafter the P 50 (half-saturation O2 tension) and n 50 (Hill cooperativity coefficient at P 50) values at these exact pH values were interpolated from linear regressions. The overall heat of oxygenation ΔH′, which includes the heat of solution of O2 (−13 kJ·mole−1) and the heats of processes linked to O2 binding such as proton and anion dissociation, was evaluated asR·(ΔlnP 50)/Δ(1/T), where R is the gas constant. The effects of synthetic peptides corresponding to the first 10 and 20 amino acid residues of trout cd-B3 on Hb-O2 affinity was examined as earlier described (17.Jensen F.B. Jakobsen M.H. Weber R.E. J. Exp. Biol. 1998; 201: 2685-2690PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence of the 20-mer peptide is Met-Glu-Asn-Asp-Leu-Ser-Phe-Gly-Glu-Asp-Val-Met-Ser-Tyr-Glu-Glu-Glu-Ser-Asp-Ser (the 10-mer comprises the first 10 residues) (26.Hübner S. Michel F. Rudloff V. Appelhans H. Hubner S. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To analyze the allosteric interactions, precise O2equilibria measured with focus on extreme (low and high) saturation values were analyzed in terms of the MWC model (22.Monod J. Wyman J. Changeux J.-P. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (6149) Google Scholar), evaluatingK T and K R, the allosteric constant (L), and derived parameters, includingq, ΔG, P m, andn max (where q is the number of interacting O2-binding sites; ΔG is the free energy of cooperativity; P m is the median O2 tension; and n max is the maximum cooperativity) (see Table I) as described by Weber et al.(27.Weber R.E.

Antonini E. Caputo A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1958; 30: 608-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Globin chains were reduced for 5 min at 100 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 6m guanidinium chloride, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol and modified with 4-vinylpyridine and maleic anhydride as described previously (29.Allen G. Burton R.H. Knippenberg P.H. Laboratory Techniques in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. 9. Elsevier/North-Holland Biomedical Press, Amsterdam1989: 1-424Google Scholar). Samples were acidified with trifluoroacetic acid and applied to a Prosphere RP C4 5-μm column (300 Å; 4.6 × 250 mm; Alltech Associates, Inc.) equilibrated with 5% acetonitrile in 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid. The samples were eluted with a linear gradient of 5–75% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid over 45 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Absorbance of the eluate was monitored at 280 nm. Globin chains were digested with trypsin at an enzyme:substrate ratio of 1:50 in 200 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8.3, at 37 °C for 6 h. The digested products were isolated by RP-HPLC as described for the globin chain isolation. The amino acid sequence of peptides was determined with an automated protein sequencer ABI 471 B (Applied Biosystems), according to the manufacturer's recommendations. By using the amino acid sequence of the β chain, the degenerated primer HOPLO F1, TGGGGNAARATHCAYATHGA, a 20-mer with 144 redundancies, was designed corresponding to the sense strand predicted by the peptide fragment WGKIHID (Fig. 10). Total RNA was isolated from intact erythrocytes with a micro RNA isolation kit (Stratagene). First strand cDNA was synthesized with MMLV-RT (Promega) using an oligo(dT) primer. PCR reactions were carried out using HOPLO F1 and oligo(dT). The PCRs were carried out for 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 1.0 min, and 72 °C for 1.5 min with Taq polymerase on a GeneAmp PCR system 9600 (Perkin-Elmer). Sequencing was then performed with HOPLO F1 as primer on an ABI 377 automatic sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Electrospray data were acquired on a Quattro II triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Micromass Ltd.) as described elsewhere (30.Dewilde S. Blaxter M. Van Hauwaert M.L. Vanfleteren J. Esmans E.L.

Anion exchange chromatography resolves the Hb into two distinct fractions, HbCa and HbAn, occurring in a ratio of approximately 38:62 (Fig.1). The oxygenation characteristics of HbAn and HbCa are radically different. At pH 7.2, the approximate intracellular value, the affinity of stripped HbCa markedly exceeds that of HbAn (P 50 = 2.4 and 8.7 mm Hg, respectively, at 25 °C) (Figs. 2 and3). In contrast to the pronounced normal Bohr effect in HbAn (ϕ = ΔlogP 50/ΔpH = −0.56 at pH 7.2), HbCa exhibits a marked, reverse Bohr effect (ϕ = +0.38). Due to opposite pH effects the functional differentiation between the two isoHbs increases with falling pH.Figure 2O2-binding curves ofHoplosternum HbAn and HbCa , measured in 0.1 m HEPES buffer at 25 °C, showing opposite Bohr effects.

As shown ATP and chloride enhance the normal Bohr effect in HbAn and reverse the Bohr effect in HbCa. Histograms show Δlog P 50values induced at pH 7.2 by 0.10 m chloride (solid columns), ATP (open columns), and 0.10 mchloride and ATP (obliquely hatched columns). Other conditions as in Fig. 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) HbCa exhibits much greater sensitivity to ATP than HbAn. The phosphate effects increase with falling pH, whereby the presence of ATP induces a slight normal Bohr effect in HbCa (ϕ = −0.14 at pH 7.2) and almost obliterates the affinity difference between the two Hb components (Fig. 3). Significantly, ATP alone decreases O2 affinity of both components more than ATP in the presence of 100 mmCl− (as illustrated for pH 7.2 by the ΔlogP 50 columns in Fig. 3). The Hill coefficientn 50 approximates 2.0 in both Hbs at pH 6.5–8.0, decreases at low and high pH to 1.5 in HbAn, and at low pH to 1.7 in HbCa (Fig. 3) but increases to 2.4 in HbCa in the presence of ATP. The difference between the Bohr effect curves at 10 and 25 °C (Fig.4) illustrates a large overall temperature effect (ΔH′ about −85 kJ·mol-1) in HbAn at high pH (8.7) where the Bohr effect and phosphate binding disappear (cf. Fig. 3). At lower pH, where the Bohr effect is operative, the enthalpy of oxygenation decreases to approximately −45 kJ·mol−1 at pH 6.8 reflecting endothermic proton release. Given that the Bohr factor (0.65) gives the moles of protons dissociated per mol of O2 bound, the enthalpy difference (+40 kJ·mol of heme) indicates an apparent heat of proton dissociation of 62 kJ·mol-1. Analogously the increase in enthalpy for HbCa (by approximately 18 kJ·mol−1 as pH decreases from pH 9, Fig. 4) reflects proton association upon O2 binding, in accordance with the reverse Bohr effect. Related to the Bohr factor (+0.38) this increase indicates an apparent ionization enthalpy of approximately 47 kJ per mol of protons bound. These values may, however, be biased by thermodynamic contributions from other oxygenation linked processes, such as Cl− binding, that may account for the lower ΔH value found in HbAn at pH 6.0 than at pH 8.5 (where oxygen-linked proton binding approximates zero). Chloride ions reduce O2 affinity of both HbAnand HbCa, except for HbA at pH >7.7 where 0.1m chloride increased affinity (Fig. 3). Below pH 7.7 chloride and saturating ATP concentration raise the Bohr effect of HbAn to −0.65 and −1.1, respectively. The chloride sensitivity of Hoplosternum Hbs is low compared with human Hb. At pH 7.0, 100 mm chloride increases logP 50 of HbAn and HbCa by only 0.07 units, compared with 0.45 units in human Hb (Figs. 3 and5). Dose-response curves for the effects of anions (A) on O2 affinity (Figs. 5 and 6) can be interpreted in terms of the basic linkage equation: ΔlogP m/Δlog[A] = −ΔX, where X is the amount of anion bound per (de-)oxygenated heme. Provided close agreement exists betweenP 50 and P m values (see below) and between the concentration and activity of the effector, the slopes of log P 50 versuslog[A] plots at midpoint (designated by τ) approach a limiting value that cannot be smaller than the number of oxygen-linked binding sites per heme (24.Weber R.E. J. Appl. Physiol. 1992; 72: 1611-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 31.Amiconi G. Bertollini A. Bellelli A. Coletta M. Condò S.G. Brunori M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 150: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The log P 50 versuslog[Cl−] curves indicate τ values of approximately 0.22 for Hoplosternum HbAn and HbCacompared with 0.48 for human Hb at pH 7.0 and lower values at higher pH (τ = 0.13–0.14 for Hoplosternum Hbs at pH 7.5 and 0.45 for human Hb at pH 7.4) (Fig. 5). Dose-response curves for the phosphate effectors (Fig. 6) reveal the order of allosteric effectivity as DPG < ATP < GTP < IHP, greater sensitivities of HbCa than HbAn to all effectors and greater effects at pH 7.0 than at pH 7.5, where the cationic phosphate-binding sites are less charged. Curiously, DPG and low concentrations of the other effectors increased O2affinity of HbAn at pH 7.5 (Fig. 6 D). For HbCa the curves at pH 7.0 and 7.5 (Fig. 6, Aand B) indicate lower maximum P 50values induced by DPG than by IHP, ATP, and GTP, indicating formation of additional bonds (cf. Ref. 32.Giardina B. Brix O. Colosimo A. Petruzzelli R. Cerroni L. Condò S.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) with the latter effectors at saturating phosphate:Hb ratios. Whereas the slope for DPG and HbCa (τ = 0.22) tallies with the release of one phosphate molecule per oxygenated tetramer, higher τ values (>0.25) obtained for ATP, GTP, and IHP suggest the existence of additional sites of phosphate interaction. Interpolated on the basis of the P 50 maximum induced by IHP (Fig. 6 A), the data indicate apparent dissociation equilibrium constants, K a (estimated as the effector concentration that induces half of the maximum change in log P 50) for the reactions of HbCawith ATP, GTP, and IHP at pH 7.0 of approximately 11 × 10−4, 5.4 × 10−4, and 2.2 × 10−4m, respectively. Interpolated in terms of the P 50 maximum induced by DPG, the constant for DPG approximates 13.2 × 10−4m. Compared with values for the reaction of DPG with human and Eskimo dog Hbs (3.2 × 10−4m at pH 7.5 and ∼1 × 10−4m at pH 7.2, respectively, at 20 °C and in the presence of 100 mm Cl−) (33.Giardina B.

Biochem. Physiol. A Comp. Physiol. 1997; 117: 367-373Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar), this illustrates relatively low DPG sensitivity inHoplosternum HbCa. In contrast to the pronounced effects of the 10- and 20-mer synthetic trout band 3 peptides on the O2 affinity of human Hb (Fig.7; see also Ref. 17.Jensen F.B. Jakobsen M.H. Weber R.E. J. Exp. Biol. 1998; 201: 2685-2690PubMed Google Scholar), the peptides had no effect on Hoplosternum HbAn at pH 7.2 and only marginally decreased the O2 affinity at lower pH (6.4) (Fig. 7). This aligns with the absence of effects in trout Hbs I-IV (17.Jensen F.B. Jakobsen M.H. Weber R.E. J. Exp. Biol. 1998; 201: 2685-2690PubMed Google Scholar), 2R. E. Weber, unpublished observations. despite the large effects of these peptides in human Hb (17.Jensen F.B. Jakobsen M.H. Weber R.E. J. Exp. Biol. 1998; 201: 2685-2690PubMed Google Scholar). Significantly, the peptide exerts a distinct effect on Hoplosternum HbCa at pH 7.2 and an even greater effect at lower pH (6.58) (Fig. 7). The effect on human Hb (17.Jensen F.B. Jakobsen M.H. Weber R.E. J. Exp. Biol. 1998; 201: 2685-2690PubMed Google Scholar) and the marked pH-dependent effects in Hoplosternum HbCa (Fig. 7) attest to the functionality of the peptides and the presence of a putative band 3-binding site in both Hbs. The allosteric and derived MWC model parameters are given in TableI. The agreement betweenn 50 and n max and betweenP 50 and P m values reflects highly symmetrical O2 equilibrium curves that permit rigorous analysis of P 50 plots. Moreover, the mean value for the number of interacting O2-binding sites per molecule (q = 4.03 ± 0.74), obtained when q was fit along with the other parameters to obtain the best possible fit in the 13 condition sets described in Table I, tallies neatly with a tetrameric structure. The derived parameters summarized in Table I were thus obtained with q fixed at 4. Extended Hill plots for the effects of pH and organic phosphates in HbCa are shown (Figs. 8 and9). In contrast to anodic vertebrate Hbs where the normal alkaline Bohr effect primarily results from a decrease in K T with increasing proton concentrations (23.Weber R.E. Jensen F.B. Cox R.P. J. Comp. Physiol. 1987; 157: 145-152Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar,35.Imai K. Allosteric Effects in Haemoglobin. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge1982: 1-275Google Scholar, 36.Chien J.C.W. Mayo K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9790-9799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the control mechanism of the reverse Bohr effect ofHoplosternum HbCa is an increase inK T with falling pH (Fig. 8, Table I), indicating a more constrained T state with increasing pH. The Bohr factor of the deoxygenated (T state) Hb markedly exceeds that at median saturation (ϕ = +0.35 versus +0.25, respectively, at pH 7–8; Fig. 8, inset). Increased pH accordingly raises the free energy of cooperativity (ΔG increases from approximately 6.5 to 8.5 kJ·mol between pH 7 and 8, see Table I) as illustrated by the greater distance between the upper and lower linear asymptotes of the extended Hill plots at high pH (see Fig. 8). The allosteric constant L of Hoplosternum HbCaincreases at high pH (Table I), compared with the opposite effect in human and anodic fish Hbs (23.Weber R.E. Jensen F.B. Cox R.P. J. Comp.

Selectins contain a single N-terminal lectin domain, followed by an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain, a series of short consensus repeats (SCRs), a transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic tail (3.McEver R.P.

Electron microscopy and hydrodynamic analysis confirm that selectins are rigid asymmetric molecules (32.Ushiyama S. Laue T.M. Moore K.L. Erickson H.P. McEver R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15229-15237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the crystal structure of E-selectin predicts little interaction between the lectin and EGF domain (33.Graves B.J. Crowther R.L. Chandran C. Rumberger J.M. Li S. Huang K.S. Presky D.H. Familletti P.C. Wolitzky B.A. Burns D.K. Nature. 1994; 367: 532-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), deletions of the EGF domain of selectins abolish ligand recognition (34.Pigott R. Needham L.A. Edwards R.M. Walker C. Power C. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 130-135PubMed Google Scholar). The precise roles of the EGF domain and the SCRs are unclear. Adhesion of selectins to their carbohydrate ligands is a function of both kinetic properties of ligand recognition as measured in the absence of applied forces, as well as the mechanical properties of selectin-ligand bonds, which control the kinetics of bond formation and breakage in the presence of shear forces (35.Bell G. Science. 1978; 200: 618-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (3449) Google Scholar). The latter properties control the effective strength of a given receptor-ligand interaction independently of the apparent bond affinity in the absence of force (36.Puri K.D. Chen S. Springer T.A. Nature. 1998; 392: 930-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To gain new insights into the molecular basis of selectin-mediated adhesion and its regulation by equilibrium and mechanical properties of selectin bonds, we compared the dynamic properties of bonds formed by native L-selectin with those exhibited by an L-selectin mutant in which the EGF-like domain of L-selectin has been replaced with the homologous domain from P-selectin. This mutant, designated LPL (37.Kansas G.S. Saunders K.B. Ley K. Zakrzewicz A. Gibson R.M. Furie B.C. Furie B. Tedder T.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 609-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), has previously been shown to retain the ligand specificity of native L-selectin and displays increased adhesiveness toward L-selectin-ligand expressing myeloid cells (37.Kansas G.S. Saunders K.B. Ley K. Zakrzewicz A. Gibson R.M. Furie B.C. Furie B. Tedder T.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 609-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The detailed kinetic characterization of this mutant performed in the present study reveals a dramatically augmented ability of the mutant over that of native L-selectin to mediate rolling on all L-selectin ligands tested, both as a cell-associated or cell-free form. This enhanced adhesion is also associated with abolishment of the shear threshold requirement of adhesion, an unprecedented property of selectin-dependent rolling (38.Finger E.B. Puri K.D. Alon R. Lawrence M.B. von Andrian U.H. Springer T.A. Nature. 1996; 379: 266-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 39.Lawrence M.B. Kansas G.S. Kunkel E.J. Ley K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 717-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). This study is a first demonstration that the EGF domain can regulate the adhesive activity of L-selectin by altering the kinetics of ligand recognition under shear flow without affecting affinity to soluble ligand in the absence of flow.

Fucoidin, a plant-derived sulfated polyfucan that saturably blocks the lectin domains of L-selectin and P-selectin (2.Rosen S.D. Bertozzi C.R. Curr. Opin.

The L-selectin polysaccharide ligand PPME was FITC-labeled as described (46.Glabe C.G. Harty P.K. Rosen S.D. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 130: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and was kindly supplied by Lloyd Stoolman (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI). Human serum albumin (HSA; Fraction V), was obtained from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Fucoidin was covalently conjugated to HSA (fucoidin-HSA) as described previously (46.Glabe C.G. Harty P.K. Rosen S.D. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 130: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The stable expression of cDNA encoding native human L-selectin or the L-selectin chimera, LPL, in the mouse pre-B cell line 300.19 was described elsewhere (37.Kansas G.S. Saunders K.B. Ley K. Zakrzewicz A. Gibson R.M. Furie B.C. Furie B. Tedder T.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 609-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Clones expressing similar levels of native and chimeric L-selectin were maintained in RPMI 1640, supplemented with antibiotics, 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mmglutamine, and 0.1 μm 2-mercaptoethanol. Peripheral blood granulocytes were isolated from anticoagulated blood after dextran sedimentation and density separation over Ficoll-Hypaque (47.English D. Anderson B.R. J. Immunol. Methods. 1974; 5: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Indirect immunofluorescence was performed on washed cells that were suspended in PBS supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum and 5 mm EDTA. Cells were incubated at 4 °C with either 10 μg/ml of the L-selectin mAb DREG-200 or with preimmune mouse IgG as a control for background staining. Cells were washed, stained with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig, resuspended in PBS supplemented with 0.05% sodium azide, and immediately analyzed in a FACScan flow cytometer (Beckton Dickinson, Erembodegem, Belgium). Localization of L-selectin was assessed by immunoelectron microscopy as described previously (48.Finger E.B. Bruehl R.E. Bainton D.F. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 5085-5096PubMed Google Scholar). The sectioned cells (40–60 cells/experiment) were examined with a Phillips 410 electron microscope (Phillips; Eindhoven, The Netherlands); only representative cells were photographed. 125I-Labeled DREG-200 was prepared by the chloramine T method (49.Hunter W.M. Greenwood F.C. Nature. 1962; 194: 495-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (5861) Google Scholar), using a ratio of 50 μg of protein to 0.5 mCi of carrier-free sodium 125iodide. L-selectin or LPL transfected cells (1 × 106/ml) were incubated in binding medium (Hanks' balanced salt solution/10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, supplemented with 2 mm CaCl2 and 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) in the presence of 1–200 nm125I-labeled DREG-200 mAb for 10 min at 24 °C and for an additional 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed three times with binding medium at 4 °C, and cell-associated γ-radioactivity was determined. FITC-PPME binding to the various transfectants (1 × 105/ml) was determined by incubating cells in 0.1 ml of binding medium with the polysaccaride ligand for 10 min at 24 °C. Cells were diluted into 2 ml of binding medium and immediately analyzed for FITC staining by fluorescence-activated cell sorter. PPME staining was completely blocked by Ca2+ chelation with 5 mm EDTA. Short term PPME binding was determined by incubating cells with the ligand for 0.5–5 min followed by dilution and immediate fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. Concentrates of GlyCAM-1, fucoidin-HSA, or DREG-200 (intact or Fab fragment) were diluted in coating medium (PBS supplemented with 20 mm bicarbonate, pH 8.5) and adsorbed onto the plates for 2 h at 37 °C. PNAd aliquots were diluted to concentrations of 10 ng/ml to 100 μg/ml in the coating medium and immediately adsorbed onto a polystyrene plate for 15 h at 4 °C. The 3′6 disulfo Lex glycolipid was dissolved at 0.5–2 μg/ml in 20:1 methanol:butanol solution containing 4 μg/ml of egg lecitin phosphatidylcholine (Sigma) and coated as described previously (50.Alon R. Feizi T. Yuen C.T. Fuhlbrigge R.C. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 5356-5366PubMed Google Scholar). All substrates were washed five times with PBS and blocked with PBS supplemented with 2% human serum albumin (PBS/HSA) at 4 °C. GlyCAM-1 site densities were assessed using 125I-labeled CAM02. Because this polyclonal Ab is directed against a short segment exposed on the mucin backbone, at saturation, a single antibody molecule was assumed to bind to each immobilized GlyCAM-1 molecule. The ligand density of PNAd was expressed in input coating concentrations (μg/ml). Cell-free L-selectin and LPL were derived from lysates of transfected 300.19 cells. Crude transfectant lysates were lysed and prepared as described previously (51.Picker L.J. Warnock R.A. Burns A.R. Doerschuk C.M. Berg E.L. Butcher E.C. Cell. 1991; 66: 921-933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar), and cleared lysates were immediately used for coating. Polystyrene plates were coated with L-selectin or its EGF mutant using an antibody capture procedure designed to optimize the functionality of the cell-free selectin and eliminate Fc-dependent interactions of neutrophils perfused over the adhesive substrate. Substrates were prepared by directly coating protein A onto a polystyrene plate (at 20 μg/ml in coating medium, followed by quenching with PBS/HSA and addition of rabbit anti-mouse IgG Fc, 20 μg/ml in PBS/HSA). Unbound IgG was removed by multiple washing, and anti-L-selectin cytoplasmic tail mAb CA21, diluted in PBS/HSA, was then adsorbed at different concentrations (1–20 ng/ml) onto the immobilized rabbit anti-mouse IgG. The site density of CA21 on the various substrates was determined by radioimmunoassay using125I-labeled CA21 mAb. To assure maximal immunoadsorption of solubilized native or chimeric L-selectin, each CA21 mAb spot was overlaid three times with lysate aliquots, each time for 4 h at 4 °C. Following the last lysate adsorption, substrates were washed with PBS supplemented with 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.02% sodium azide and subjected to extensive washing with cell binding medium (Hanks' balanced salt solution/10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, supplemented with 2 mm CaCl2 and 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). The polystyrene plate, on which purified ligand was adsorbed, was assembled in a parallel plate laminar flow chamber as described previously (1.Lawrence M.B. Springer T.A. Cell. 1991; 65: 859-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1887) Google Scholar, 52.Lawrence M.B. Berg E.L. Butcher E.C. Springer T.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 1025-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were washed in H/H medium containing 5 mmEDTA, resuspended in H/H medium at 107 cells/ml and stored at 4 °C up to 1 h before each flow experiment. Stored cells were resuspended in cell binding medium at 106 cells/ml and perfused at room temperature through the flow chamber at desired flow rates, generated with an automated syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus, Natick, MA). Cellular interactions were visualized at two different fields of view (each one 0.17 mm2 in area) using a 10× objective of an inverted phase contrast microscope (Diaphot 300, Nikon Inc., Tokyo, Japan). Tethering events were defined as adhesive interactions of those freely flowing cells (herein termed cell flux) moving closest to the lower wall of the flow chamber coated with the test substrate and that are therefore the only population potentially capable of interacting with the substrate. This flux was visualized by their brighter images and slower motions than cells moving at more distant layers of the perfusate. Two types of initial cell tethers to the substrate were determined: transient tethers, cells that attached briefly to the substrate without initiating rolling motions, and rolling tethers, cells that remained rolling on the substrate,i.e. moving at a mean velocity not more than a fourth the hydrodynamic velocity for at least 3 s after initial tethering. The number of each type of tethered cells was divided by the cell flux to yield the frequency of initial tethers. For cell inhibition studies, cells were preincubated for 5 min at 4 °C in H/H medium with 5 μg/ml of the L-selectin blocking mAb, DREG-200, or preimmune mouse IgG, diluted 1:10 with the binding medium, and perfused into the chamber. For cell-free selectin or LPL mutant blocking, cells were perfused into the flow chamber in the presence of 50 μg/ml of the L-selectin ligand, fucoidin, or 5 mm EGTA. More than 98% of all transient cell tethers to the various glycoprotein ligands were L-selectin-specific, because they were blocked by fucoidin. Rolling velocities were determined by following the cell displacements over 2–3 s as described previously (29.Dwir O. Shimron F. Chen C. Singer M. Rosen S.D. Alon R. Cell. Adhes. Commun. 1998; 6: 349-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To follow the kinetics of leukocyte release by a shear drop, cells were allowed to roll on high density ligands at 1.75 dyn/cm2 for at least 20 s before the flow rate was dropped to 0.2 dyn/cm2. To estimate the time lapse required for the flow system to reach a shear stress of 0.2 dyn/cm2, given that at this shear value, a noninteracting cell traveled at a velocity of 60 μm/s, the time point at which leukocytes freely moving at 1.75 dyn/cm2 reached this lower velocity, after being subjected to the same shear drop was determined. The number of originally rolling cells remaining bound to the substrate after this time point was determined by frame-by-frame analysis. Transient tethers to low density ligands were defined as temporary pauses when separated by at least 50 μm of motion at the hydrodynamic velocity and when no cell motion (<1 μm displacement) occurred while the cell was tethered to the substrate (8.Alon R. Hammer D.A. Springer T.A. Nature. 1995; 374: 539-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). The duration of transient tethers was determined at a resolution of 0.02 s by manually counting the number of frames during which the tethered cell was motionless (53.Alon R. Chen S. Puri K.D. Finger E.B. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1169-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Tethers lasting less than 0.04 s were reanalyzed at a resolution of 0.02 s on high fidelity video (Panasonic AG-7355, Osaka, Japan) using a digital still playback mode. Sufficient videotape was analyzed (60–120 s) to obtain 30–40 tethering events, and the natural log of the number of cells that remained bound was plotted as a function of the tether duration time. The slope of the curve represents −k off. An imaging system was developed for quantitative analysis of instantaneous velocities of cell rolling on different adhesive substrates. Video frame images consisting of 768 × 574 pixels (with a pixel size of 1.15 μm using a 10× objective), were digitized using a Matrox Pulsar frame grabber (Matrox Graphics Inc., Dorval, Quebec, Canada), and images were scanned and processed by the WSCAN-Array-3 imaging software (Galai, Migdal-Ha'emek, Israel), running on an Atlas pentium MMX-200 work station. Cell motions were identified from images tracked at 0.02-s intervals. The program output provided the coordinates of the center point of each cell in successive interlaced fields 0.02 s apart. A computer program for cell motion analysis was developed in collaboration with the lab of Prof. David Malah (Electric Engineering Faculty, Technion, Haifa, Israel). The software runs under Matlab 5.2 and compares instantaneous positions of individual cells at successive video images over a period of up to 5 s. Tethers of individual cells rolling persistently on the ligand-coated field or moving through it in a jerky motion were determined according to changes in instantaneous cell velocities in the flow direction. A rolling pause was defined as an instantaneous velocity drop to below 29 μm/s at shear stresses of 1–1.75 dyn/cm2. This threshold velocity value gave optimal correlation between pause analysis performed on representative cells by the computerized system and manually, directly from the video monitor. The step distances between successive pauses of an individual rolling cell were averaged to yield the mean step distance of a given rolling cell. Native L-selectin and the EGF domain mutant LPL were stably expressed in the pre-B cell line 300.19 (37.Kansas G.S. Saunders K.B. Ley K. Zakrzewicz A. Gibson R.M. Furie B.C. Furie B. Tedder T.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 609-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and clones with comparable surface expression levels of each molecule were isolated (Fig. 1 A). As on other leukocytes, L-selectin preferentially localizes on the microvillar surface projections of 300.19 pre-B cells (54.Pavalko F.M. Walker D.M. Graham L. Goheen M. Doerschuk C.M. Kansas G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1155-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Because selectin localization to tips of microvilli has been argued to augment its ability to support initial cell tethering in shear flow (55.von Andrian U.H. Hasslen S.R. Nelson R.D. Erlandsen S.L. Butcher E.C. Cell. 1995; 82: 989-999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 56.Stein J.V. Cheng G. Stockton B.M. Fors B.P. Butcher E.C. von Andrian U.H. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 37-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), we compared the surface distribution of the native and mutated L-selectin on the 300.19 clones by immunogold labeling. Transmission electron microscopy of sectioned cells confirmed that both transfectants have comparable microvilli both in number and dimensions (data not shown). Immunogold localization of L-selectin indicated similar localization of both L-selectin and LPL to microvilli with a comparable distribution between the tips and other regions of the microvilli (Fig. 1 B). Variable clusters of L-selectin and LPL were identified on both cell transfectants, and their mean size was similar.

Several examples of Thyr-1 modules have been previously identified as inhibitors of the papain family of cysteine proteinases. Saxiphilin is a neurotoxin-binding protein from bullfrog and a homolog of transferrin with a pair of such Thyr-1 modules located in the N-lobe. Saxiphilin is now characterized as a potent inhibitor of three cysteine proteinases as follows: papain, human cathepsin B, and cathepsin L. The stoichiometry of enzyme inhibition reveals that both Thyr-1 domains of saxiphilin inhibit papain (apparentK i = 1.72 nm), but only one of these domains inhibits cathepsin B (K i = 1.67 nm) and cathepsin L (K i = 0.02 nm). Physical association of saxiphilin and papain blocked from turnover at the active-site cysteine residue can be detected by cross-linking with glutaraldehyde. The rate of association of saxiphilin and cathepsin B is strongly pH-dependent with an optimum at pH 5.2, reflecting control by at least two H+-titratable groups. These results further demonstrate that various Thyr-1 domains are selective inhibitors of cysteine proteinases with utility in the study of protein interactions and degradation.

Saxiphilin binds the neurotoxin, saxitoxin (STX),1 and various STX derivatives with high affinity (KD ≃0.2 nm STX) and specificity (1.Doyle D.D. Wong M. Tanaka J. Barr L.

STX is a tricyclic organic cation produced by various dinoflagellates and cyanobacteria (4.Hall S. Strichartz G. Moczydlowski E. Ravindran A. Reichardt P.B. Hall S. Strichartz G. Marine Toxins: Origin, Structure and Molecular Pharmacology. American Chemical Society, Washington, D. C.1990: 29-65Google Scholar). Paralysis caused by STX intoxication is due to blockage of voltage-sensitive sodium channels (5.Ritchie J.M. Rogart R.B. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1977; 79: 1-50Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Molecular characterization of saxiphilin revealed that it is homologous to transferrins, a family of high affinity Fe3+-binding proteins (3.Li Y. Moczydlowski E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15481-15487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Morabito M.A. Moczydlowski E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2478-2482Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 7.Welch S. Transferrin: The Iron Carrier. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992Google Scholar). Despite this structural similarity, saxiphilin differs from the transferrin family in two major respects as follows: (i) 9 of 10 highly conserved Fe3+site residues in transferrin are substituted in saxiphilin, accounting for a lack of Fe3+ binding (6.Morabito M.A. Moczydlowski E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2478-2482Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 8.Li Y. Llewellyn L.E. Moczydlowski E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 742-748PubMed Google Scholar); (ii) the larger size of saxiphilin (91 kDa) versus transferrin (∼80 kDa) is primarily due to an insertion of 143 residues in the N-lobe. This insertion corresponds to a tandem duplication of a thyroglobulin type 1 domain (Thyr-1) (9.Morabito M.A. Moczydlowski E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6651Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 10.Morabito M.A. Llewellyn L.E. Moczydlowski E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13027-13033Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 11.Malthiery Y. Lissitzky S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 165: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Thyr-1 domains are recognized as a unique sequence motif of ∼60–80 residues, usually containing six conserved cysteine residues (12.Molina F. Bouanani M. Pau B. Granier C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These domains or modules are present in diverse families of proteins that include mosaic proteins such as thyroglobulin (11.Malthiery Y. Lissitzky S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 165: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), membrane proteins such as p41 invariant chain (13.Koch N. Lauer W. Habicht J. Dobberstein B. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1677-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and unrelated binding proteins such as saxiphilin (6.Morabito M.A. Moczydlowski E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2478-2482Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 9.Morabito M.A. Moczydlowski E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 938-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). A few years ago, it was discovered that some proteins containing Thyr-1 modules function as inhibitors of the papain family of cysteine proteinases that include cathepsins B and L,e.g. p41 invariant chain fragment (15.Bevec T. Stoka V. Pungerčič G. Dolenc I. Turk V. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1331-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), chum salmon egg cysteine proteinase inhibitor (16.Yamashita M. Konagaya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1282-1284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and equistatin (17.Lenarčič B. Ritonja A. S̆trukelj B. Turk B. Turk V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272 (Correction (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 12682): 13899-13903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). A common feature of these latter proteins containing either one (p41, egg cysteine proteinase inhibitor) or three (equistatin) Thyr-1 modules is an ability to inhibit a variety of papain-related cysteine proteinases with K i values in the picomolar to nanomolar range. They have thus been classified as thyroglobulin type 1 proteinase inhibitors, also called thyropins (19.Lenarčič B. Bevec T. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 105-111PubMed Google Scholar). In a recent development to this emerging picture of thyropin function, it was found that the sea anemone protein, equistatin, also inhibits an aspartic proteinase (20.Lenarčič B. Turk V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 563-566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the distinct proteinase inhibitor activities of equistatin reside on different Thyr-1 domains. Inhibition of cysteine proteinase activity is associated with the N-terminal Thyr-1 domain of equistatin, and inhibition of an aspartic proteinase, cathepsin D, is associated with one of the two C-terminal Thyr-1 domains (20.Lenarčič B. Turk V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 563-566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In contrast, thyroglobulin, a protein with 11 Thyr-1 modules, and mouse nidogen (or entactin) with one Thyr-1 module, reportedly do not inhibit papain (16.Yamashita M. Konagaya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1282-1284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These results suggest that various Thyr-1 modules contain specific structural features that determine anti-proteinase activity against certain papain-related or cathepsin D-related enzymes. The inhibitory mechanism of a thyroglobulin type 1 domain was revealed by the crystal structure of p41 invariant chain fragment in complex with cathepsin L (21.Gunčar G. Pungerčič G. Klemenčič I. Turk V. Turk D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 793-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The wedge shape of the inhibitor binds into the active site cleft. The nonspecific interactions at the bottom of the cleft are mediated by three loops, whereas the specific interactions are mediated via side chains on one side of the p41 fragment and the loops embracing the substrate-binding sites S2 and S1′ of cathepsin L. Identification of Thyr-1 domains as inhibitors of cysteine or aspartic proteinases suggests that saxiphilin may have other biochemical activities beside its known binding affinity for STX. In this work, we examined the interaction of recombinant saxiphilin with three papain-related cysteine proteinases (papain and cathepsins B and L) to determine whether saxiphilin is an inhibitor of such enzymes and to characterize further the specificity of Thyr-1 domains. Our results indicate that both Thyr-1 domains of saxiphilin are functionally capable of inhibiting papain, but only one of the two domains is an active inhibitor of cathepsins B and L. Z-Phe-Arg-4-methyl-7-coumarin (AMC) was obtained from Serva (Germany) and Z-Phe-Arg-p-nitroanilide from Bachem (Switzerland). Stock solutions of these latter substrates were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (Merck). Papain, 2× crystallized (Sigma), was further purified by affinity chromatography (22.Blumberg S. Schechter I. Berger A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 15: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Recombinant human cathepsin B and cathepsin L were prepared as described previously (23.Kuhelj R. Dolinar M. Pungerčar J. Turk V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 24.Turk B. Dolenc I. Turk V. Bieth J.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 375-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Recombinant saxiphilin (R-sax) was produced by expression in suspension cultures of High Five insect cells infected with baculovirus as described previously (10.Morabito M.A. Llewellyn L.E. Moczydlowski E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13027-13033Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). This expression system provided a starting medium containing 44 ± 12 pmol of R-sax per ml (mean ± S.D., n = 10 batches). Purification of milligram quantities of R-sax from insect cell medium was accomplished by the following procedure adapted from a protocol for purification of the native protein from frog plasma (3.Li Y. Moczydlowski E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15481-15487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Insect cell medium containing R-sax was supplemented with 1 μm proteinase inhibitors (benzamidine, leupeptin, and pepstatin) and stored frozen at −20 °C until used for purification. Five liters of medium containing >20 pmol of R-sax/ml was thawed and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min to remove cell debris and virus particles. The supernatant was concentrated to 200 ml with a tangential flow device (Pall Filtron, Northborough, MA) followed by ultrafiltration (Amicon, Beverly, MA) using membranes with a 30-kDa cutoff. The concentrated sample was subjected to precipitation at 0 °C by polyethylene glycol with an averageM r of 400 (PEG-400, from Sigma). PEG-400 was added dropwise with stirring to a final concentration of 8%. The sample was stirred for 2 h, centrifuged at 100,000 ×g, and the pellet discarded. The supernatant was passed through a 0.22-μm filter and purified on a column (0.8 × 10 cm) of POROS 20HE heparin affinity chromatography media (Perspective Biosystems, Framingham, MA). A sample of the PEG-400 supernatant containing 25 mg of protein was applied to the column in buffer (10 mm MES, 30 mm sodium acetate, 5 mmEDTA, pH 6.0) at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. The column was washed with buffer plus 20 mm NaCl for 10 min and eluted with a linear gradient (10 min) of 50–300 mm NaCl in buffer at a flow rate of 6 ml/min. Fractions containing [3H]STX-binding activity were pooled, concentrated to 50 ml by ultrafiltration, and dialyzed against deionized water. This sample was purified by chromatofocusing on a column (2.5 × 20 cm) of PBE 118 anion exchange resin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was pre-equilibrated with 25 mm triethanolamine, pH 10.5. After loading the protein sample, the column was eluted at 0.2 ml/min with the following solution: 17.8 ml Polybuffer 96 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and 3.6 ml Pharmalyte 8–10.5 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), adjusted to pH 8.0 with HCl, and brought to a final volume of 500 ml with deionized water. Fractions containing [3H]STX binding activity were pooled and ampholytes removed by gel filtration chromatography on a column of Sephacryl S-300 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) eluted with 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmHepes-NaOH, pH 7.4. Pure R-sax was visualized by silver staining as a single band on SDS-PAGE. Samples of purified R-Sax were stored in a solution containing 35% glycerol at −20 °C. This method typically achieved a yield of ∼25% or ∼5 mg of saxiphilin per 5 liters of starting medium. SDS-PAGE was performed according to the method of Laemmli (25.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) using precast 10% polyacrylamide gels from Bio-Rad. Physical association of saxiphilin and papain was investigated by size analysis of protein complexes trapped by glutaraldehyde cross-linking (26.Craig W.S. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 156: 333-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Papain used for this experiment was inactivated by a treatment with 2 mmcysteine for 10 min followed by 100 mm iodoacetamide (IAA) for 1 h in 50 mm NaPi, 1 mmEDTA, pH 8.0, at 22 °C. IAA-inactivated papain was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 20 mm NaPi, pH 6.5. A fixed amount of saxiphilin (3 μg) was titrated with increasing amounts of IAA-inactivated papain in 30 μl of buffer (100 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0). The samples were incubated on ice for 10 min. Glutaraldehyde (Sigma grade I) was added to a final concentration of 20 mm and allowed to react at 22 °C for 20 min. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and proteins bands were visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue (27.Merril C.R. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 477-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Protein concentration of saxiphilin was measured by the bicinchoninic acid method (28.Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18349) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The concentration of [3H]STX-binding sites in samples of saxiphilin was assayed according to the method described (10.Morabito M.A. Llewellyn L.E. Moczydlowski E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13027-13033Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The protein concentration of papain and cathepsins B and L was determined by absorption measurements at 280 nm using the molar absorption coefficients of 56,200 (29.Brocklehurst K. Carlson J. Kierstan M.P.J. Crook E.M. Biochem. J. 1973; 133: 573-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), 44,000 (30.Bajkowski A.S. Frankfater A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 1645-1649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and 44,300m−1 cm−1 (31.Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3373) Google Scholar), respectively. For purified papain, a thiol content of 0.92 ± 0.05 mol/mol of enzyme was determined by reaction with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid). For cathepsins B and L the active concentrations were determined by active-site titration with the inhibitor Ep-475 as described previously (32.Barrett A.J. Kirschke H. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 535-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (1722) Google Scholar). The active-site titrated enzymes were then used to titrate saxiphilin as follows. Papain (0.1 μm final concentration) was added to 200 μl of 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, containing 5 mm dithiothreitol and 1 mm EDTA, followed 5 min later by the addition of 200 μl of increasing concentrations of saxiphilin. After 20 min incubation at 25 °C, 600 μl of 100 μm Z-Phe-Arg-p-nitroanilide in the same buffer was added. The residual activity was monitored as function of increasing absorbance at 410 nm with Perkin-Elmer Lambda 18 Spectrophotometer. The active concentration of saxiphilin was determined from a plot of residual activities against molar ratios of initial enzyme and inhibitor concentrations ([I o]/[E o]). The data were analyzed by computer fitting to the theoretical binding equation (33.Bieth J.G. Biochem. Med. 1984; 32: 387-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Titration of saxiphilin was performed in a similar way with cathepsin B (0.13 μm final concentration), using 50 mmsodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, containing 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA and with cathepsin L (2 nm final concentration) in 0.34m sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, containing 5 mm dithiothreitol and 1 mm EDTA. Z-Phe-Arg-AMC (10 μm) was used as substrate for cathepsin L, and the release of the product was monitored at excitation and emission wavelengths of 370 and 460 nm, respectively, by a Perkin-Elmer LS50B spectrofluorimeter. In all kinetic experiments, papain and cathepsin B were assayed using 0.1m phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, containing 5 mmdithiothreitol and 1 mm EDTA, whereas for cathepsin L, 0.34m sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, containing 5 mm dithiothreitol and 1 mm EDTA was used. Saxiphilin (variable concentrations) and substrate (10 μmZ-Phe-Arg-AMC) were dissolved in 1.98 ml of the appropriate buffer. The reaction was started by the addition of 20 μl of activated papain (87 pm final concentration), cathepsin B (900 pmfinal concentration), or cathepsin L (160 pm final concentration). All experiments were performed under pseudo-first order, i.e. at molar ratio of the inhibitor to enzymes of 10:1. The progress curves were monitored as described under “Active-site Titrations” and fitted by nonlinear regression to the following integrated rate equation (34.Morrison J.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1982; 7: 102-105Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (492) Google Scholar): p =v s t + (v z− v s)(1 −e − kt)/k, wherev s is the steady state velocity,v z is the initial velocity, and k is the pseudo-first order rate constant describing the pre-steady state reaction. The association rate constant (k a) was determined from a plot of k versus[I] according to equation k =k d + k a[I]/(1 + [S]/K m), where the dissociation rate constant,k d, was calculated from each individual progress curve according to equation k d =k(v s/v z).K i was obtained fromk d/k a. SubstrateK m values of 65 μm for papain (35.Zucker S. Buttle D.J. Nicklin J.H. Barrett A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 828: 196-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), 2 μm for cathepsin L (36.Mason R.W. Biochem. J. 1986; 240: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and 150 μm for cathepsin B (32.Barrett A.J. Kirschke H. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 535-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (1722) Google Scholar) were used. The pH dependence ofk a for the inhibition of cathepsin B by saxiphilin was studied over the pH range of 3.5–7.5. Buffers of pH 3.5–5.5 contained 50 mm sodium acetate, and buffers covering the pH range 6.0–7.5 contained 50 mm sodium phosphate. All buffers also contained 100 mm NaCl and 1 mmEDTA. The activating solution in all experiments was 5 mmEDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, pH 6.0. Reactions were monitored with a DX 17MV stopped-flow apparatus (Applied Photophysics, UK). One syringe was filled with buffer, saxiphilin (200 nmfinal concentration), and substrate Z-Phe-Arg-AMC (20 μm), and the second was filled with preactivated cathepsin B (20 nm). 100 μl of solution from each syringe was used per run, and an average of 6–8 runs was performed for each determination of the constant. The emission of released products was observed at an excitation wavelength of 360 nm through the cutoff filter with ∼50% transmission at 420 nm. The data were fit to the following equation (37.Fersht A. Enzyme Structure and Function. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1984: 155-175Google Scholar): k a =k a(lim)/(1 + [H+]/K 1 +K 2/[H+]), wherek a(lim) presents the limiting value ofk a. Recombinant saxiphilin was produced as a secreted protein in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector (10.Morabito M.A. Llewellyn L.E. Moczydlowski E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13027-13033Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and purified to homogeneity from insect cell medium using [3H]STX binding to monitor activity. The stoichiometry of binding interactions between saxiphilin and papain-related cysteine proteinases (papain and cathepsins B and L) was determined by titrating each enzyme with increasing amounts of saxiphilin and monitoring the loss of enzymatic activity. The concentration of each proteinase used in this experiment was determined by independent active-site titration (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fig. 1shows that the residual activity of cathepsin B and cathepsin L plotted as a function of increasing molar ratios of saxiphilin/enzyme is consistent with a 1:1 stoichiometry for inhibition of both cathepsins. Specifically, 1.03 ± 0.01 and 0.96 ± 0.02 mol of saxiphilin were found to inhibit 1 mol of cathepsin B and cathepsin L, respectively, based on a fit of the titration data to a one-site binding reaction (33.Bieth J.G. Biochem. Med. 1984; 32: 387-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In contrast, a lower molar ratio of inhibitor to enzyme was required for complete inhibition of papain by saxiphilin (Fig. 1). This analysis showed that 0.56 ± 0.03 mol saxiphilin was sufficient to inhibit 1 mol of papain, indicating that there are two functional binding sites for papain on each saxiphilin molecule. Physical association of saxiphilin and papain was also investigated by chemical cross-linking and affinity adsorption. Fig.2 shows results of an experiment in which a constant amount of saxiphilin was incubated with increasing amounts of papain that were inactivated by pretreatment with iodoacetamide. Complex formation between the two proteins was assessed by exposure to the cross-linking agent, glutaraldehyde, followed by SDS-PAGE. This assay detected a shift of the 91-kDa saxiphilin band to higher molecular weight as a function of increasing papain concentration. In control experiments, neither saxiphilin nor papain (23 kDa) produced such higher molecular weight bands when incubated alone and treated with glutaraldehyde, demonstrating that the band shift is due to formation of a saxiphilin-papain complex. The diffuse nature of the glutaraldehyde cross-linked bands on SDS-PAGE did not allow us to clearly resolve 1:1 and 1:2 saxiphilin/papain species, but the observed shift is consistent with complexes in this range. Since carboxymethylated papain coupled to Sepharose has been previously used to isolate cysteine proteinase inhibitors such as cystatin (38.Barrett A., J. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 771-779Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar) from egg white and equistatin from an extract of sea anemone (17.Lenarčič B. Ritonja A. S̆trukelj B. Turk B. Turk V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272 (Correction (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 12682): 13899-13903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), we also tested whether such a papain affinity matrix is capable of binding saxiphilin. We found that a column of papain-Sepharose medium prepared as described (38.Barrett A., J. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 771-779Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar) effectively adsorbs [3H]STX binding activity from a crude protein sample such as insect medium containing recombinant saxiphilin. Elution of this washed column at high pH yielded a fraction containing purified saxiphilin (results not shown). Thus, both glutaraldehyde cross-linking and papain affinity chromatography provided evidence of specific physical association of saxiphilin and papain, as one would expect from the enzyme inhibition experiments of Fig. 1. Since saxiphilin also binds STX, a small organic molecule, we performed several experiments to investigate possible ligand interactions between the binding of [3H]STX and papain. In one type of experiment, a fixed amount of papain was titrated with increasing saxiphilin in the absence or presence of 200 nm STX, and papain activity was measured as in Fig. 1. We found that STX had no effect on the papain inhibition curve (not shown). Since STX binds to saxiphilin with a K d of ∼1 nm under these conditions (39.Llewellyn L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12312-12322Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), this result indicates that the affinity of papain for saxiphilin is not disturbed by the binding of STX. In a converse experiment, we also found that there is no effect of papain on binding of [3H]STX to saxiphilin when studied at 0 °C. This latter experiment was performed with papain inactivated by the sulfhydryl reagent, methyl methanethiosufonate, in order to differentiate simple binding interactions from proteolytic effects. However, in the presence of a sulfhydryl-reducing agent (5 mm DTT), increasing papain concentration inhibited [3H]STX binding by ∼60% reduction of initial [3H]STX-binding sites (data not shown). Further studies revealed that inhibition of STX binding by DTT-activated papain is due to combined effects of an irreversible loss in the total number of STX sites and a severalfold increase in the apparent K dof remaining STX sites. The most likely cause of the loss of STX binding activity under these conditions is partial proteolysis of saxiphilin, resulting in modification and destruction of the STX-binding site. The effect of DTT is explained by the fact that this reagent re-activates papain that is thiomethylated at the active-site cysteine residue by methyl methanethiosufonate. In support of this conclusion, we observed proteolysis of saxiphilin exposed to DTT-activated papain, as monitored by disappearance of the 91-kDa band on SDS-PAGE (not shown). Thus, although saxiphilin is a potent inhibitor of papain, certain regions of the saxiphilin protein are susceptible to cleavage by active papain molecules. The interaction kinetics of saxiphilin with cathepsins B and L were characterized under pseudo-first order conditions by continuous fluorometric assays using Z-Phe-Arg-AMC as a substrate. Fig.3 shows an example of typical biphasic progress curves observed when hydrolysis of a fluorescent substrate by cathepsin L is initiated in the presence of saxiphilin. The progress curves are well fit by a single exponential function as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The pseudo-first order rate constant,k, derived from this experiment increases linearly with saxiphilin concentration (Fig. 3, inset), indicative of a simple bimolecular process for the association of saxiphilin and cathepsin L. Similar behavior was found for cathepsin B. The kinetic and equilibrium constants derived for the interaction of saxiphilin with cathepsin B and cathepsin L (TableI) show that saxiphilin binds tightly and rapidly to both enzymes but has ∼80-fold higher affinity for cathepsin L versus B. The binding parameters for inhibition of these enzymes by saxiphilin are very similar to those previously reported for equistatin (17.Lenarčič B. Ritonja A. S̆trukelj B. Turk B. Turk V. J. Biol.

The lower K ivalue for the interaction of saxiphilin with cathepsin Lversus cathepsin B, 0.020 ± 0.003 nm and 1.67 ± 0.43 nm, respectively, is primarily due to a 30-fold faster association rate for cathepsin L (Table I).Table IKinetic data for the interaction of saxiphilin with papain, cathepsin B, and cathepsin LEnzyme10−6 ×k a104 ×k dK im −1 s −1s −1nmPapain1.8 ± 0.231 ± 51.72 ± 0.34Cathepsin B0.6 ± 0.110 ± 21.67 ± 0.43Cathepsin L18 ± 0.53.6 ± 0.60.020 ± 0.0034The experimental conditions are described under “Experimental Procedures.” K i was calculated from the ratiok d/k a.

PAF and PAF-like phospholipids are hydrolyzed and inactivated by the enzyme PAF acetylhydrolase. In the intact rat, infusion of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into a mesenteric vein served as an acute, liver-focused model of endotoxemia. We determined that the liver responds to LPS exposure with the production of plasma-type PAF acetylhydrolase mRNA and protein expression specifically in the resident macrophages of the liver. Liver macrophages, defined immunohistochemically using antibodies against ED1, present in livers from saline-treated animals contained no detectable PAF acetylhydrolase. Twenty-four hours following in vivo LPS administration, immunohistochemistry detected a slight increase in the number of ED1 staining cells and the ED1-positive cells now contained an abundance of PAF acetylhydrolase. The systemic administration of LPS resulted in increased expression of PAF acetylhydrolase in several tissues. Of the tissues examined, the greatest increase in PAF acetylhydrolase expression was observed in lung followed by increases in spleen, liver, kidney, and thymus. Additionally, the expression of PAF acetylhydrolase mRNA increased in circulating leukocytes and in peritoneal macrophages in response to systemic exposure to LPS. We examined the regulation of PAF acetylhydrolase expression and demonstrated the administration of the PAF receptor antagonists, BN 50739 and WEB 2170, inhibited by 50% the increase in PAF acetylhydrolase expression in response to LPS. The up-regulation of the plasma-type PAF acetylhydrolase expression constitutes an important mechanism for elevating the local and systemic ability to inactivate PAF and oxidized phospholipids in order to minimize PAF-mediated pathophysiology consequent from exposure to endotoxin. The abundance of PAF acetylhydrolase production in the liver lobule likely limits endotoxin-mediated tissue damage due to PAF synthesis."

Leu-98 in recombinant Phascolopsis gouldii hemerythrin, was mutated to several other residues of varying sizes (Ala, Val), polarities (Thr, Asp, Asn), and aromaticities (Phe, Tyr, Trp). UV-visible and resonance Raman spectra showed that the di-iron sites in these L98X Hrs are very similar to those in the wild type protein, and several of the L98X hemerythrins formed stable oxy adducts. Despite the apparently tight packing in the pocket, all of the L98X Hrs except for L98W, had second order O2 association rate constants within a factor of 3 of the wild type value. Similarly, the O2 dissociation rate constant was essentially unaffected by substitutions of larger (Phe) or smaller (Val, Thr) residues for Leu-98. L98Y Hr showed a 170-fold decrease in the O2 dissociation rate constant and a large D2O effect on this rate, which are attributed to a hydrogen-bonding interaction between the Tyr-98 hydroxyl and the bound O2. Significant increases in autoxidation rates were observed for all of the L98X Hrs other thanX = Tyr. These increases in autoxidation rates are attributed to increased solvent access to the binding pocket caused by inefficient packing (Phe), smaller size (Val, Ala), or increased polarity (Thr, Asp, Asn) of the residue 98 side chain. A leucine at position 98 appears to have the optimal size, shape, and hydrophobicity for inhibition of solvent access.

Chem. Rev. 1994; 94: 715-726Crossref Scopus (344) Google Scholar). The octameric Hr from the sipunculid worm, Phascolopsis gouldii, is the most thoroughly characterized of this group. The eight essentially identical subunits exhibit no cooperativity in O2 binding. Each 13.5-kDa subunit consists of a four-helix bundle protein backbone surrounding an oxo-/hydroxo-bridged di-iron site. SchemeFS1 depicts the di-iron site structure and also depicts a proposed structural mechanism for reversible binding of O2 to the site (1.Stenkamp R.E. Chem. Rev. 1994; 94: 715-726Crossref Scopus (344) Google Scholar). The structures depicted in Scheme FS1 for the deoxy and oxy iron sites have been largely confirmed by x-ray crystallography and various spectroscopies (1.Stenkamp R.E. Chem. Rev. 1994; 94: 715-726Crossref Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence (summarized by Brunold and Solomon (Refs. 2.Brunold T.C. Solomon E.I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 8277-8287Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar and 3.Brunold T.C. Solomon E.I. J. Am. Chem.

The bound O2 is, thus, formally a hydroperoxo ligand with its proton hydrogen-bonded to the oxo bridge. Studies measuring O2 affinities and association and dissociation rate constants have been published for several Hrs (4.deWaal D.J.A. Wilkins R.G. J. Biol.

Antonini E. Wyman J. Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 3016-3020Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), the O2 association/dissociation reactions of Hrs were reported to have monophasic kinetics at room temperature, implying that any intermediate species, such as that shown in Scheme FS1, does not accumulate. The O2-binding pocket of Hr is lined with a set of conserved, hydrophobic residues, whose sequential and spatial positions are indicated in Fig. 1. One or more side-chain atoms of residues Ile-28, Phe-55, Trp-97, Leu-98, and Ile-102 are within 4 Å of the coordinated O2 atoms in oxyHr (1.Stenkamp R.E. Chem. Rev. 1994; 94: 715-726Crossref Scopus (344) Google Scholar). L98Cδ1 is 3.6 Å from atom O2 of the bound dioxygen (cf. Scheme FS1 and Fig. 1 for atom numbering). Based on this close distance, it was proposed that Leu-98 could limit ingress or egress of O2 to or from the binding pocket, thereby functioning as a steric “gate” (11.Martins L.J. Hill C.P. Ellis Jr., W.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7044-7049Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, this proposal has not heretofore been subjected to a direct experimental test. Based on laser flash photolysis studies of another oxyHr, opening of a gate was proposed to lead to escape of O2 into solvent following its photodissociation from Fe2 (6.Lavalette D. Tetreau C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 177: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, this putative “gate opening” occurred on the time scale of microseconds or less, which is much faster than the thermal O2 dissociation rates of any known Hr (15–120 s−1; Ref. 12.Feig A.L. Lippard S.J. Chem. Rev. 1994; 94: 759-805Crossref Scopus (972) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in order to accurately model the experimental data, the gate was proposed to be permanently open in the deoxy form (13.Lavalette D. Tetreau C. Vinogradov S.N. Kapp O.H. Structure and Function of Invertebrate Oxygen Carriers. Springer-Verlag, New York1991: 191-198Crossref Google Scholar). Two mutations of the residue corresponding to Leu-98 in a myoHr, the monomeric counterpart to Hr, led to rapid autoxidation of the di-iron site, such that O2binding kinetics and equilibria could not be measured (14.Raner G.M. Martins L.J. Ellis Jr., W.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7037-7043Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Autoxidation, formulated as Reactions 2 and/or 3, is presumably initiated by solvent entry into the binding pocket of the oxy form (15.Wilkins P.C. Wilkins R.G. Coord. Chem. Rev. 1987; 79: 195-214Crossref Scopus (179) Google Scholar,16.Bradic Z. Conrad R. Wilkins R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 6069-6075Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Chem. 1977; 252: 6069-6075Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but the met/hydroxomet form is thermodynamically favored. Thus, the rapid autoxidation of the L98X counterpart mutants in myoHr may indicate that this residue limits solvent access to the O2-binding pocket. However, the role of Leu-98 in modulating O2 association and dissociation remains ambiguous. We have now measured O2binding kinetics and equilibria for a series of L98Xsite-directed mutants of P. gouldii Hr in order to test the role(s) of this conserved pocket residue. Since Hr had not previously been cloned and overexpressed heterologously, we developed a procedure for doing so. Molecular biology procedures not described below followed those of Sambrook et al. (17.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar) or Ausubel et al. (18.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar). Restriction enzymes were obtained from either Roche Molecular Biochemicals or Promega, Inc. Oligonucleotides were purchased from Operon Technologies, Inc., Biopolymers, Inc., Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc., or the Great American Gene Co.. PCR products were purified from agarose electrophoresis gels using Wizard PCR Preps DNA purification kits (Promega). Plasmids were purified using Midi Prep plasmid purification kits (Qiagen, Inc.). Nucleotide sequencing was carried out in the Molecular Genetics Instrumentation Facility at the University of Georgia. Escherichia coli cultures were grown either in LB/amp or in LB/amp containing agar. Protein overexpression was monitored by Tricine SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (19.Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10480) Google Scholar) on samples of E. coli cultures removed before and after induction (as described below), and on cell lysate fractions. Specimens of P. gouldii were obtained live from the Marine Biological Laboratory (Woods Hole, MA). Hemerythrocytes (the hemerythrin-containing coelomic cells) were isolated from the combined coelomic fluid of approximately a dozen specimens by low speed centrifugation and washing in artificial seawater. Total RNA was isolated from ∼2 ml of packed hemerythrocytes using a total RNA isolation kit from Stratagene, Inc., and assuming that 1 ml of packed hemerythrocytes corresponded to 1 g of tissue. The precipitated RNA was stored at −20 °C. The recombinant P. gouldii Hr gene was cloned from the total RNA by reverse transcription-PCR using a Perkin-Elmer Cetus GenAmp® RNA PCR kit. The reverse transcription-PCR mix contained, in addition to the standard ingredients, ∼1 μg of the P. gouldiihemerythrocyte total RNA (dissolved in 2 μl of 10 mm Tris and 1 mm EDTA, pH 8) and 0.25 μm each of two degenerate primers, DMK2 (5′-GCTGCAGTAAGGAGGTTTAACATGGGNTTYCCNATHC CNGAY-3′) and DMK3 (5′-ATGCAAGCTTADATYTTNCCYTTRTAYTT-3′), in a total volume of 50 μl. The degenerate portions of the nucleotide sequences of DMK2 and DMK3 were based on the published N- and C-terminal amino acid sequences, respectively, of P. gouldiiHr (1.Stenkamp R.E. Chem. Rev. 1994; 94: 715-726Crossref Scopus (344) Google Scholar), and either PstI or HindIII restriction sites (underlined) were added to the 5′ ends of the primers. The following thermal cycling sequence was used in the PCR: once for 2 min at 95 °C, 35 times for (1 min at 95 °C and 1 min at 42 °C), once for 7 min at 60 °C. The resulting PCR product was ligated into the PstI and HindIII restriction sites of pBluescript KS+ (Stratagene, Inc.). The resulting plasmid was sequenced to confirm insertion of the Hr gene, which was then isolated and purified from a PstI/HindIII digest of the plasmid. This purified,PstI/HindIII-digested Hr gene was used as template in a PCR with ∼0.5 μm primers DMK6 (5′-TATACATatgGGTTTCCCGATTCCG-3′) and DMK3. The nucleotide sequence of DMK6 duplicated that of the N-terminal end of the clonedP. gouldii Hr gene with the start codon indicated in lowercase, and an NdeI restriction site (underlined) incorporating the start codon was added to the 5′ end. The thermal cycling sequence used for the PCR was: 30 times for (2 min at 95 °C, 2 min at 60 °C, and 3 min at 72 °C), and once for 5 min at 72 °C. The PCR product was ligated into theNdeI/HindIII restriction sites of pT7–7 (20.Tabor S. Ausubel F.A. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Green Publishing/Wiley-Interscience, New York1990: 16.2.1-16.2.11Google Scholar). Nucleotide sequencing of the resulting pT7–7 derivative, designated pDK4–1, confirmed the correctness of the inserted Hr gene sequence. The cloned Hr gene sequence in pDK4–1 was deposited as GenBank accession no. AF220529. Site-directed mutations in the Hr gene were obtained by the method of splicing by overlap extension (21.Horton R.M. Cai Z.L. Ho S.N. Pease L.R. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 528-535PubMed Google Scholar), which requires two rounds of PCRs for each mutation. The first round consisted of two PCRs, both usingBglII-digested pDK4–1 as template. One first-round PCR used the oligonucleotide T7 (5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG-3′) and one oligonucleotide, L98X, with the sequence 5′-GTG GTT GAC NNN CCA GCT CTT-3′ as primers. The nucleotides, NNN, consisted of one of the following sequences (5′ →3′) for each L98X mutation:X = F, GAA; X = Y, GTA;X = V, GAC; X = T, AGT;X = W, CCA; X = D, GTC;X = N, AAC; X = A, GCA. The other first-round PCR used oligonucleotide T7R (5′-TCAGACCAAGTTTACTCA-3′) and the corresponding reverse complement of the L98Xoligonucleotide as primers. T7 and T7R duplicate nucleotide sequences in pT7–7 upstream of the NdeI restriction site and downstream of the HindIII restriction site, respectively (20.Tabor S. Ausubel F.A. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Green Publishing/Wiley-Interscience, New York1990: 16.2.1-16.2.11Google Scholar). The second round of PCR used the two combined, purified PCR products from the first round as template with T7 and T7R as primers. For both rounds the PCR reaction mixtures contained ∼5 ng of template DNA, ∼0.08 μm amounts of oligonucleotide primers, 0.25 μm amounts of each of the dNTPs, and 0.5 unit ofTaq polymerase in PCR reaction buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.9, 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mmMgCl2) to a final volume of 50 μl. The PCR temperature-cycling sequence was: 1 × 5 min at 95 °C, 30 × [1 min at 94 °C, 55 °C for 1 min, and 2 min at 72 °C]. The second-round PCR products were restriction-digested withNdeI and HindIII and ligated into the corresponding restriction sites of pT7–7. Those plasmids containing the correctly mutated L98X Hr gene sequences were used to transform E. coli BL21(DE3) (22.Studier W.F. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6005) Google Scholar). Fifty-milliliter cultures of E. coliBL21(DE3) transformed with either pDK4–1 or one of its L98X-mutated derivatives were grown overnight at 37 °C in LB/amp with shaking at 250 rpm. Four of these 50-ml overnight cultures were used to inoculate four 1-liter batches of LB/amp, and these 1-liter cultures were incubated under the same conditions of temperature and shaking. When the OD600 of the cultures reached ∼1.0, either isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside to 0.4 mm final concentration or 4.0 g of β-d-lactose was added to induce overexpression of the Hr gene. (Either isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside or lactose gave comparable levels of Hr overexpression.) The induced cultures were incubated for another 2–4 h at the same temperature and shaking speed. All subsequent operations were performed at room temperature, except for centrifugations and pressure ultrafiltrations, which were at 4 °C. The harvested, combined cells from four 1-liter cultures were resuspended in ∼100 ml of 50 mm HEPES, 150 mmNa2SO4, pH 7.5 (buffer), and then lysed by sonication. The lysed cell suspension was centrifuged at 30,000 ×g for 30 min. The overexpressed Hr was found to be exclusively in the pellet, which was washed with buffer and then resuspended in ∼12 ml of 6 m guanidine-HCl in buffer. To this suspension was added 200 μl of β-mercaptoethanol, and the mixture was stirred vigorously for 5–24 h aerobically at room temperature to facilitate dissolution of the inclusion bodies. The green-brown suspension was then centrifuged at 30,000 ×g for 30 min. The supernatant (∼40 ml) was transferred to a 250-ml beaker with a magnetic stir bar. Ten volumes of buffer were added dropwise over 2–5 h, with stirring at room temperature. The resulting suspension was centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was discarded. The insoluble protein pellet was re-dissolved in guanidine-HCl/β-mercaptoethanol as before; only several minutes of gentle stirring were required to re-dissolve the pellet at this stage. The solution (∼10 ml) was transferred to a 500-ml Schlenk-type flask fitted with a pressure-equalizing addition funnel, which contained 100 ml of buffer. This system was sealed, attached to a vacuum manifold, and alternately evacuated and flushed with argon while stirring until frothing of the protein solution was negligible. The addition funnel was briefly removed from the flask under a positive pressure of argon, and ∼0.1 g of solid ferrous ammonium sulfate was rapidly added to the protein solution. The addition funnel was replaced, anaerobiosis was re-established, and the 100 ml of buffer was added dropwise at a constant rate over a period of ∼10 h with gentle stirring. After complete addition of the buffer, the protein solution was centrifuged aerobically at 30,000 ×g for 30 min. The resulting pink/yellow solution, which contained soluble, iron-containing Hr, was concentrated by ultrafiltration (Amicon, YM30 membrane, 30-kDa cut-off) under argon pressure to ∼5 ml. Two 50- to 5-ml dilution/reconcentration cycles with buffer were performed to remove residual reagents. To ensure homogeneity, the Hr was converted to the met form by addition of 5–10 small crystals of potassium ferricyanide. This solution was stirred overnight at 4 °C. The ∼5 ml of protein solution was then loaded onto a Superdex 200 16/60 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) pre-equilibrated with buffer. The Hr was eluted with buffer at a flow rate of 0.5 ml min−1 as a single band, and was collected and concentrated by ultrafiltration (Centricon 30, 30-kDa cut-off). Both wild type and L98X Hrs were similarly overexpressed, isolated, and purified. The purified Hrs were stored at −80 °C. Amounts and purities of the recombinant Hrs were estimated by UV-visible spectrophotometry (ε330 = 6400m−1 cm−1/subunit) andA 280/A 330 ratio (typically 4–4.5) (23.Zhang J.-H. Kurtz Jr., D.M. Xia Y.M. Debrunner P.G. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 583-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed a single protein band for the recombinant Hrs after this purification procedure. Four liters of E. coli culture typically yielded 50 mg of purified soluble recombinant Hr. MetHr in buffer, prepared as described above, was used as the starting point. The deoxy forms of the recombinant Hrs were prepared by anaerobic dialysis of samples of metHr against ∼5 mm sodium dithionite solutions in buffer for ∼24 h at room temperature either in a Coy® anaerobic chamber or in a Schlenk-type flask attached to a vacuum manifold. The protein was then dialyzed three times against 100 volumes of deoxygenated buffer to remove excess dithionite. The resulting protein solution was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min inside the Coy chamber in order to remove any precipitate. The oxy forms were prepared by briefly bubbling air through a freshly prepared solution of deoxyHr. Aliquots (∼1 ml) of the oxyHrs were frozen rapidly in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. O2 affinities for wild type and L98XHrs were measured by spectrophotometric tonometry. The method has been previously described for native P. gouldii Hr (24.Robitaille P.M. Kurtz Jr., D.M. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4458-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Solutions of the deoxyHr to be examined (1.0–1.5 ml, 50–100 μm in subunits) were anaerobically transferred to a specially adapted 1-cm pathlength cell, which was then attached to the tonometer. The O2 association constant was expressed asP 50, the partial pressure of O2 at which [oxyHr]/[Hr]total = 0.5, as determined from exponential fits to plots of A 500 versus PO2. Rates of O2 dissociation from oxyHr were measured by stopped-flow spectrophotometry using a rapid scanning monochromator from Olis, Inc. A previously described O2-scavenging method was employed (4.deWaal D.J.A. Wilkins R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 2339-2343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by mixing the oxyHr solution (∼200 μm in di-iron sites) with 100 mm sodium dithionite solution in buffer. Spectra were collected every millisecond following a dead time of 2 ms. Absorbance changes at 500 nm versus time were fit to a single exponential decay for >5 half-lives using non-linear least squares fitting to determine the first-order dissociation rate constant, k off. Measurements of the temperature-dependence of k off between ∼6 °C and ∼35 °C, controlled to ±0.01 °C by a circulating bath, were used to determine enthalpies and entropies of activation from Eyring plots. Rates of O2 association with deoxyHrs were measured by stopped-flow spectrophotometry in the same buffer and on the same instrument as for the dissociation rates. This method has also been described previously for native P. gouldii Hr (4.deWaal D.J.A. Wilkins R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 2339-2343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Solutions of the deoxyHrs, freshly prepared as described above, were used for these experiments. A small amount of the deoxyHr solution was exposed to air, and the resulting oxyHr (ε500 = 2, 200m−1 cm−1) (25.Garbett K. Darnall D.W. Klotz I.M. Williams R.J.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1969; 135: 419-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) was used to determine the concentration of the deoxyHr. Prior to transferring the deoxyHr, the loading syringe was filled with ∼100 mmsodium dithionite and incubated for ∼30 min in order to scavenge any adventitious O2. The loading syringe was then washed three times with dithionite-free anaerobic buffer. A gas-tight syringe containing the deoxyHr solution was rapidly transferred to the loading syringe on the stopped-flow spectrophotometer, and the protein solution was injected into the loading syringe. The deoxyHr solution remained anaerobic as judged by the lack of significant absorbance at 500 nm. Aerated buffer was loaded into the second stopped-flow syringe. The concentration of dissolved O2 in the aerated buffer was measured with a Clark-type oxygen electrode (Yellow Springs Instruments, Inc.). The concentration of O2 was 140 μm after mixing, which was a 5–10-fold molar excess over Hr di-iron sites (12–30 μm after mixing), and pseudo first order behavior was therefore, assumed. The increase in absorbance at 500 nm was monitored versus time, or, alternatively, absorption spectra from 350 nm to 600 nm were collected at 1-ms intervals. Data were plotted as absorbance at 500 nm versustime, and the resulting curves were least-squares fit to single exponentials over ≥3 half-lives from which the second order O2 association rate constants, k on, were derived. Activation parameters were determined as described above. Autoxidation half-lives at 25 °C were estimated by monitoring the distinctive changes between oxyHr and metHr absorption spectra (23.Zhang J.-H. Kurtz Jr., D.M. Xia Y.M. Debrunner P.G. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 583-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) on a Shimadzu UV2101PC scanning spectrophotometer. For autoxidation half-times that were shorter than a few seconds, the rates were determined on the Olis stopped-flow spectrophotometer by mixing the deoxy form with O2 solution as described above for the O2 association rates. Resonance Raman spectra were obtained on Hr samples prepared at the University of Georgia and shipped frozen in dry ice to the Oregon Graduate Institute. Spectra were obtained at ice temperature using a 90° scattering geometry on a McPherson 2061 spectrograph with an 1800-groove grating and a Princeton Instruments liquid N2 cooled (LN100PB) CCD detector. The excitation sources were a Coherent Innova 300 Kr+ laser for 413.1 nm and a Spectra Physics Ar+ 164 laser for 514.5 nm and 488.0 nm. Raman samples in buffer were 1–2 mm in di-iron sites. The P. gouldii Hr gene was cloned from cDNA of hemerythrin-containing coelomic cells. The derived amino acid sequence was identical to that published for one of the minor amino acid variants of nativeP. gouldii Hr in which a threonine is substituted for a glycine at position 79 (26.Klippenstein G.L. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 372-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Native P. gouldii Hr consists of a total of five amino acid substitution variants in varying proportions; none of these variants is known to affect any spectroscopic or functional properties of the di-iron site (27.Ward K.B. Hendrickson W.A. Klippenstein G.L. Nature. 1975; 257: 818-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Both the recombinant wild type and L98X P. gouldii Hrs were expressed in E. coli as insoluble apoproteins using the T7 polymerase/promoter overexpression system (20.Tabor S. Ausubel F.A. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Green Publishing/Wiley-Interscience, New York1990: 16.2.1-16.2.11Google Scholar, 22.Studier W.F. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6005) Google Scholar). Based on a previously described procedure used to reconstitute native P. gouldii Hr from the apoprotein (23.Zhang J.-H. Kurtz Jr., D.M. Xia Y.M. Debrunner P.G. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 583-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 28.Zhang J.H. Kurtz Jr., D.M. Xia Y.M. Debrunner P.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1122: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), a method was developed for resolubilizing the recombinant wild type P. gouldiiapoHr from the inclusion bodies and for incorporation of iron such that a di-iron site with properties (see below) essentially indistinguishable from that in native P. gouldii Hr was obtained. The same method was used to obtain a series of soluble di-iron-containing recombinant L98X P. gouldiiHrs. All of these recombinant Hrs were octameric, as judged by gel filtration, as is native P. gouldii Hr (1.Stenkamp R.E. Chem. Rev. 1994; 94: 715-726Crossref Scopus (344) Google Scholar). After resolubilization, iron incorporation, and oxidation with ferricyanide, all of the recombinant wild type, and L98Y, -F, -V, -W, -T, -D, -N, and -A P. gouldii Hrs contained di-iron sites whose absorption spectra (cf. Fig. 2) were very similar to that of native P. gouldii metHr at pH 7.5 (23.Zhang J.-H. Kurtz Jr., D.M. Xia Y.M. Debrunner P.G. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 583-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The absorption features at ∼320 and ∼360 nm, and shoulder at ∼480 nm, are due to μ-oxo → Fe(III) LMCT transitions, and this set of features serves as a fingerprint for μ-oxo-di-iron(III) sites with supporting carboxylate bridges (29.Kurtz Jr., D.M. Chem. Rev. 1990; 90: 585-606Crossref Scopus (1064) Google Scholar, 30.Solomon E.I. Tuczek F. Root D.E. Brown C.A. Chem. Rev. 1994; 94: 827-856Crossref Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The absorption spectrum of the recombinant L98Y metHr was found to have a weak, broad absorption between 500 and 700 nm, which was not present in the wild type or other L98X metHr spectra. This feature showed variable intensity in multiple preparations of L98Y metHr, and neither its intensity nor position was affected by pH between 6.0 and 9.0. The L98Y metHr spectrum shown in Fig. 1 contains a very minor contribution from this feature. Resonance Raman spectra, discussed below, indicate that this absorption is due to a portion of the protein in which a phenolate, presumably from Tyr-98, is ligated to Fe(III). Resonance Raman spectra of the recombinant wild type metHr (data not shown) exhibited the characteristic νs(Fe-O-Fe) and νas(Fe-O-Fe) stretching frequencies of the oxo-bridged di-iron(III) site at 508 and 758 cm−1 (weak), respectively. These frequencies mimic those of the native P. gouldii metHr (510 and ∼753 cm−1, respectively; Ref. 31.Shiemke A.K. Loehr T.M. Sanders-Loehr J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 4951-4956Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar), which indicates conservation of the bent Fe-O-Fe angle (∼125°) enforced b"
https://openalex.org/W2008028586,"Class III ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) is an anaerobic glycyl radical enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides. We have investigated the importance in the reaction mechanism of nine conserved cysteine residues in class III RNR from bacteriophage T4. By using site-directed mutagenesis, we show that two of the cysteines, Cys-79 and Cys-290, are directly involved in the reaction mechanism. Based on the positioning of these two residues in the active site region of the known three-dimensional structure of the phage T4 enzyme, and their structural equivalence to two cysteine residues in the active site region of the aerobic class I RNR, we suggest that Cys-290 participates in the reaction mechanism by forming a transient thiyl radical and that Cys-79 participates in the actual reduction of the substrate. Our results provide strong experimental evidence for a similar radical-based reaction mechanism in all classes of RNR but also identify important differences between class III RNR and the other classes of RNR as regards the reduction per se. We also identify a cluster of four cysteines (Cys-543, Cys-546, Cys-561, and Cys-564) in the C-terminal part of the class III enzyme, which are essential for formation of the glycyl radical. These cysteines make up a CX 2C–CX 2C motif in the vicinity of the stable radical at Gly-580. We propose that the four cysteines are involved in radical transfer between Gly-580 and the cofactor S-adenosylmethionine of the activating NrdG enzyme needed for glycyl radical generation.

As this is the only way for de novosynthesis of building blocks for DNA, RNR is an essential constituent of all living cells. At least three different classes of RNRs can be distinguished based on their polypeptide composition and cofactor requirements (1.Sjöberg B.-M. Struct. Bonding. 1997; 88: 139-173Crossref Google Scholar, 2.Jordan A. Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 71-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar, 3.Stubbe J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2723-2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Several prokaryotic organisms encode more than one class of RNR and in some cases also more than one representative from the same class. All previously characterized class I and II RNRs operate via a radical based mechanism, considered to involve one cysteine residue that forms a transient thiyl radical during catalysis and a cysteine pair that provides the reducing electrons (4.Åberg A.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12676-12685Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). However, the two classes differ in the way they acquire the thiyl radical. The resting class I RNR harbors a stable tyrosyl radical close to a diferric-oxo center within one of its components. The tyrosyl radical interacts with the active site in the other component via a long range radical transfer pathway. Class II RNRs require the cofactor adenosylcobalamin that by homolytic cleavage acts as a thiyl radical generator. Class III RNRs represent a third variant and harbors a stable glycyl radical within the so-called NrdD component that also harbors the active site region. An activating component, the 4Fe-4S NrdG protein, has the ability to generate the glycyl radical in NrdD via cleavage of the cofactor AdoMet (7.Ollagnier S. Mulliez E. Schmidt P.P. Eliasson R.

Class III RNR is an anaerobic enzyme, and the glycyl radical is extremely sensitive to oxygen. In the recently deduced three-dimensional structure of a class III enzyme from bacteriophage T4, only two cysteine residues were encountered in the active site region (10.Logan D.T. Andersson J. Sjöberg B.-M. Nordlund P. Science. 1999; 283: 1499-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The radical generation procedure of class III RNRs is similar to that of pyruvate formate-lyase (PFL), a key enzyme in anaerobic glucose metabolism (11.Knappe J. Wagner A.F.V. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 258: 343-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). An activating iron-sulfur protein cleaves AdoMet to generate a glycyl radical in PFL (12.Wagner A.F. Frey M.

Chem. 1994; 269: 12432-12437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two vicinal cysteines, Cys-418 and Cys-419, are crucial for catalysis, and both are capable of forming a transient thiyl radical (14.Knappe J. Elbert S. Frey M. Wagner A.F.V. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 731-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 15.Parast C.V. Wong K.K. Kozarich J.W. Peisach J. Magliozzo R.S.

Biol. 1999; 6: 969-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Recently, other proteins have also been suggested to harbor a glycyl radical (17.Hesslinger C. Fairhurst S.A. Sawers G. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 477-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 18.Leuthner B. Leutwein C. Schulz H. Horth P. Haehnel W. Schiltz E. Schagger H. Heider J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 615-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), making glycyl radical enzymes a distinct group of proteins (19.Eklund H. Fontecave M. Structure. 1999; 7: R257-R262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Despite the lack of significant overall amino acid sequence similarities between class III RNRs on the one hand and class I and II RNRs on the other hand, or between class III RNRs and PFL enzymes, the catalytic cores of T4 class III RNR, protein R1 of class I RNR fromEscherichia coli, and E. coli PFL are strikingly similar (10.Logan D.T. Andersson J. Sjöberg B.-M. Nordlund P. Science. 1999; 283: 1499-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 16.Becker A. FritzWolf K. Kabsch W. Knappe J. Schultz S. Wagner A.F.V. Nat. Struct.

Interestingly, Cys-290 in the class III enzyme is in a position corresponding to the active site residues Cys-439 in the R1 structure (Fig. 1) and Cys-419 in the PFL structure. Cys-439 in R1 is the residue proposed to form the transient thiyl radical during catalysis of RNR. Additionally, Cys-79 from the class III enzyme is in a corresponding position to Cys-225 in R1, the residue in class I RNR that together with Cys-462 forms the redox active cysteine pair mentioned above (Fig. 1). Cys-462 in the class I structure has no cysteine counterpart in the class III RNR. These structural similarities suggest that Cys-290 in class III RNR could have the same proposed function as Cys-439 in the class I reaction mechanism, but it also suggests that the reaction mechanisms are different as regards Cys-79 in class III RNR and the redox active Cys-225–Cys-462 pair in the class I enzyme. We have earlier used site-directed mutagenesis to identify Gly-580 in phage T4 class III RNR as the site of the stable glycyl radical (21.Young P. Andersson J. Sahlin M. Sjöberg B.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20770-20775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In this work we have used the same approach to identify cysteine residues involved in the reaction mechanism of the T4 class III enzyme. Alignment of available class III RNR sequences identified five invariant, one highly conserved, and three moderately conserved cysteine residues (cf. Table I). We show that six of these cysteine residues are essential for class III RNR function. Cys-79 and Cys-290 are directly involved in catalysis, whereas a cluster of four cysteine residues (Cys-543, Cys-546, Cys-561, and Cys-564) in the C-terminal part of the enzyme is involved in the radical generation mechanism. We propose that Cys-290 forms a transient thiyl radical corresponding to Cys-439 in the class I RNR, which suggests that the initiation of the reaction for all three RNR classes is similar. In addition, we propose that the C-terminal cysteine cluster is involved in the radical transfer between AdoMet and the stable radical position at Gly-580 in the T4 enzyme.Table ISummary of sequence comparisons of NrdD from different organismsNrdD sequenceaSequences are from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI).Conserved residuesCys-79Cys-260Cys-290Cys-453Cys-543/Cys-546/Cys-561/Cys-564Cys-579Bacteriophage T4++++++Escherichia coli++++++Lactococcus lactis++++++Haemophilus influenza++++++Ralstonia eutrophaplasmid pHG1+−+−−Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum+−+−+−Methanococcus jannaschii+−+−+−Pyrococcus horikoshii/abyssi+−+−+−Other NrdD sequencesbIncludes Clostridium acetobutylicum, Corynebacterium diphteriae, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus pyogenes, Salmonella typhi/typhimurium, Vibrio cholera, andYersinia pestis, all from the NCBI.,cNumbers refer to occurrence of a cysteine residue per number of sequences aligned.19/1912/1919/1912/19CX 2 CX 10–14CX 2C, 16/1912/19CX2HX10CX2C, 3/19Conserved motifCysCysCX 2C—CX 2Ca Sequences are from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI).b Includes Clostridium acetobutylicum, Corynebacterium diphteriae, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus pyogenes, Salmonella typhi/typhimurium, Vibrio cholera, andYersinia pestis, all from the NCBI.c Numbers refer to occurrence of a cysteine residue per number of sequences aligned.

JM109(DE3) strains containing wild-type or mutant pET29T4nrdD (kanamycinR) plasmids and the wild-type pET21aT4nrdG plasmid (ampicillinR) were grown aerobically in LB medium supplemented with 35 μg/ml kanamycin and 100 μg/ml carbenicillin. The cultures were grown until the A 640 reached 0.5 and were then induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG; final concentration 1 mm). Samples of 0.5 absorbance units were withdrawn immediately before induction and after 3 h of induction. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on a 12.7% gel and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The gel was then densitometrically scanned, and the bands were quantified using the software ImageQuant from Molecular Dynamics.

After harvesting, the frozen cells were disintegrated in an X-press (from BIOX), extracted in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm DTT, and soluble proteins were batch-purified by streptomycin sulfate (1% final concentration) and ammonium sulfate (40% final concentration) precipitations. Further purification was achieved using hydrophobic interaction chromatography with butyl-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow media from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The JM109(DE3) strain containing the plasmid pET21aT4nrdG was grown in Luria Broth medium, pH 7.0, supplemented with 50 μg/ml carbenicillin, and deionized water was used. The growth was done in a 10-liter container using a Microferm® fermentor from New Brunswick Scientific Co. The culture was grown at 30 °C, and when the cells reached an A 640 of 0.6 they were induced with IPTG (final concentration 0.5 mm), and the temperature was lowered (typically to 14–19 °C) to avoid formation of inclusion bodies. After 20 h of induction (A 640 = 1.0–1.4) the cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the pellet was frozen at −80 °C. The frozen pellet was pressed 3–5 times in an X-press and extracted with 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm DTT in a blender. Nucleic acids were removed by precipitation with streptomycin sulfate to a final concentration of 1%. The proteins were then precipitated with 40% ammonium sulfate and desalted over a NAP column containing Sephadex® G-25 medium from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The NrdG content was typically ∼10% of the total protein fraction, as estimated from SDS-PAGE analyses. The desalted crude extract preparation was later used for EPR samples and enzymatic activity assays. The protocol from Ref. 22.Bianchi V. Reichard P. Eliasson R. Pontis E. Krook M. Jörnvall H. Haggård-Ljungquist E. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1590-1595Crossref PubMed Google Scholar was followed with some minor changes. The C1-a strain containing the plasmid pEE1010 was grown to stationary phase for expression of flavodoxin reductase, and the cells were then lysed with lysozyme treatment and freeze-thawing. A Superose-12 column was used to purify the 29-kDa protein, and its flavin-related absorption spectrum was found identical to that in Ref.22.Bianchi V. Reichard P. Eliasson R. Pontis E. Krook M. Jörnvall H. Haggård-Ljungquist E. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1590-1595Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. The protocol from D. Hoover was followed. The plasmid pDH1 containing the gene for flavodoxin was grown in the C1-a strain, and induction was made with IPTG; the cells were lysozyme-treated and freeze-thawed 3 times; neutralized FMN was added, 1–2 mg/liter culture. A DEAE column was used to separate the flavodoxin protein as confirmed by SDS-PAGE, its absorption spectrum, and theA 274/A 467 ratio. Purified wild-type or mutant NrdD, crude extract preparation of NrdG, and a mixture containing all the activation components were flushed separately with argon at 4 °C for 40 min in order to remove oxygen. They were then transferred to a Forma Scientific anaerobic glove box where they were mixed and incubated anaerobically for 45 min at room temperature. The final concentrations were 37.5 μm pure NrdD, NrdG-containing crude extract (40 mg/ml total protein, ∼75 μm NrdG), 30 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 30 mm KCl, 5 mm sodium formate, 5 mm DTT, 1.25 mm NADPH, 18 μm flavodoxin reductase, 6 μm flavodoxin, and 0.5 mm AdoMet, and the total volume was 160 μl. The samples were then transferred to EPR tubes, sealed, taken out of the anaerobic box, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. X-band EPR measurements were performed at 77 K on a Bruker ESP300 spectrometer using a cold finger Dewar filled with liquid nitrogen. Double integrals of the EPR signals were determined using the Bruker software, and the radical content was calculated from the spin concentration comparing with a Cu2+-EDTA standard and a known glycyl radical standard. Purified wild-type or mutant NrdD, crude extract preparation of NrdG, an activation mixture containing all the necessary components for generating the glycyl radical, and a substrate mixture were flushed separately with argon at 4 °C for 40 min to remove oxygen before transferring them to the anaerobic box. NrdD, NrdG and the activation mixture were then mixed and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. The incubation mixture contained 0.12 μm pure NrdD, NrdG-containing crude extract (10 mg/ml total protein,∼20 μm NrdG), 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 30 mm KCl, 5 mm DTT, 1.25 mm NADPH, 3 μm flavodoxin reductase, 2 μm flavodoxin, and 0.5 mm AdoMet, and the total volume was 25 μl. After 10 min, 25 μl of substrate mixture was added giving final concentrations of 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 30 mm KCl, 5 mm sodium formate, 5 mm DTT, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dATP, and 5 mm [3H]CTP. Incubation with substrate was stopped after 20 min by addition of 500 μl of 1m perchloric acid. A carrier, 50 μl of dCMP, 5 mg/ml, was added as internal standard to follow recovery during the work-up procedure. After dephosphorylation to the monophosphate level by boiling, separation of [3H]dCMP and [3H]CMP was performed over a Dowex-50 column, and isocratic elution was made with 0.2 m acetic acid. The formed 3H-labeled product was then quantified in a scintillation counter. The analyses were made by ICP-AES, plasma emission spectrometry, or ICP-SMS, plasma mass spectrometry by SGAB Analytica, Luleå, Sweden. One additional purification step (anionic mono-Q chromatography) was added prior to analyses. Protein samples contained 85–90% NrdD as judged from SDS-PAGE analysis and Coomassie Blue staining. To test our hypothesis that cysteine residues are involved in the reaction mechanism of the class III RNRs, we used site-directed mutagenesis to change conserved cysteines in the T4 NrdD protein. In all, nine cysteines (cf. Table I) were separately mutated to serine in order to abolish the redox function of the SH group while maintaining the size and the H-bonding capacity of the side chain. Five of these residues (Cys-79, Cys-290, Cys-543, Cys-561, and Cys-564) are invariant, and one (Cys-546) is highly conserved (TableI). Four of the C-terminal cysteines make up a CX 2C–CX 2C motif, below denoted the C-terminal cluster. Cys-260 and Cys-453 are only conserved in 12 of the 19 available NrdD sequences, as is Cys-579, adjacent to the site of the stable radical at Gly-580 (Table I). During the expression and purification all mutant Cys → Ser NrdD proteins behaved like wild type. The class III anaerobic RNRs have been shown to undergo truncation at the site of the glycyl radical when the radical-containing enzyme is exposed to oxygen (27.King D.S. Reichard P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 731-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A facile in vivo assay to detect formation of the glycyl radical is to monitor this truncation of NrdD when coexpressed aerobically with NrdG (21.Young P. Andersson J. Sahlin M. Sjöberg B.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20770-20775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This assay was used to monitor whether a glycyl radical is formed or not in the Cys → Ser mutants. Samples from the coexpressions were analyzed on a SDS-PAGE gel (Fig. 2). The full-length NrdD protein migrates approximately according to its theoretical molecular mass of 68 kDa (21.Young P. Andersson J. Sahlin M. Sjöberg B.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20770-20775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The truncated form, denoted NrdD′, migrates slightly faster than the full-length NrdD, in good agreement with the anticipated truncation at Gly-580 ∼3 kDa from the C terminus of the phage T4 NrdD. The oxygen-dependent cleavage can clearly be seen for the mutants C79S, C260S, C290S, C453S, and C579S (Fig. 2). As a negative control, the G580A mutant is also shown; oxygen-dependent cleavage is not possible in this mutant since no radical can be formed at Ala-580 (21.Young P. Andersson J. Sahlin M. Sjöberg B.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20770-20775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To estimate the extent of truncation, the protein gel was densitometrically scanned, and the protein bands were quantified. Samples harvested before induction with IPTG contained an unrelated protein band that comigrates with truncated NrdD′ protein (Fig. 2,Uninduced). This unrelated protein band was subtracted from the NrdD′ protein band. As can be seen, the truncation occurs in approximately 60% of the polypeptide chains of wild-type NrdD. The extent of truncation agrees with the amount of radical per NrdD dimer (∼0.55; cf. Table III) and has earlier been observed for NrdD from phage T4 and from E. coli (21.Young P. Andersson J. Sahlin M. Sjöberg B.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20770-20775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 28.Sun X.Y. Eliasson R. Pontis E. Andersson J. Buist G.

The mutants C79S, C260S, C290S, and C453S were truncated to 51–62%, and the C579S mutant was truncated to 39% (Fig. 2). This result clearly establishes that a glycyl radical could be formed in these five mutants. Fig. 2 also shows that no truncation occurs in the four C-terminal mutants C543S, C546S, C561S, and C564S suggesting that no glycyl radical could be formed in these mutants.Table IIISpecific activity and radical content for purified wild-type NrdD and the cysteine mutantsNrdD proteinSpecific activityRelative specific activityaThe specific activity of wild-type NrdD was set to 1.00, and the specific activities of the mutants were correlated to this value.Glycyl radical/NrdD dimerRelative glycyl radical contentbThe glycyl radical content/NrdD dimer of wild-type NrdD was set to 1.00, and the glycyl radical content/NrdD dimers for the mutants were correlated to this value.nmol/min/mgμm/μmWild type1350cThis is an average value from two separate experiments.1.000.541.00C79SNDdND, not detectable; detection limits are ∼40 nmol min−1 mg−1 in specific activity and ∼0.01 mol/mol in radical content.—e—, below the detection limit.0.450.83C260S14801.100.470.87C290SND—ND—C453S9200.680.200.37C543SND—ND—C546SND—ND—C561SND—ND—C564SND—ND—C579S900.07ND—a The specific activity of wild-type NrdD was set to 1.00, and the specific activities of the mutants were correlated to this value.b The glycyl radical content/NrdD dimer of wild-type NrdD was set to 1.00, and the glycyl radical content/NrdD dimers for the mutants were correlated to this value.c This is an average value from two separate experiments.d ND, not detectable; detection limits are ∼40 nmol min−1 mg−1 in specific activity and ∼0.01 mol/mol in radical content.e —, below the detection limit.

All four mutant proteins displayed a doublet EPR signal with the characteristics of the glycyl radical of wild-type NrdD (Fig.3 A). The relative radical contents compared with wild-type NrdD are shown in TableII.

https://openalex.org/W2011532009,"β-Lactamase inhibitory protein (BLIP) binds tightly to several β-lactamases including TEM-1 β-lactamase (Ki 0.1 nm). The TEM-1 β-lactamase/BLIP co-crystal structure indicates that two turn regions in BLIP insert into the active site of β-lactamase to block the binding of β-lactam antibiotics. Residues from each turn, Asp49 and Phe142, mimic interactions made by penicillin G when bound in the β-lactamase active site. Phage display was used to determine which residues within the turn regions of BLIP are critical for binding TEM-1 β-lactamase. The sequences of a set of functional mutants from each library indicated that a few sequence types were predominant. These BLIP mutants exhibitedKi values for β-lactamase inhibition ranging from 0.01 to 0.2 nm. The results indicate that even though BLIP is a potent inhibitor of TEM-1 β-lactamase, the wild-type sequence of the active site binding region is not optimal and that derivatives of BLIP that bind β-lactamase extremely tightly can be obtained. Importantly, all of the tight binding BLIP mutants have sequences that would be predicted theoretically to form turn structures. β-Lactamase inhibitory protein (BLIP) binds tightly to several β-lactamases including TEM-1 β-lactamase (Ki 0.1 nm).

Importantly, all of the tight binding BLIP mutants have sequences that would be predicted theoretically to form turn structures. β-lactamase inhibitory protein polymerase chain reaction β-Lactam antibiotics such as the penicillins and cephalosporins are among the most frequently used antibiotics. The major mechanism of bacterial resistance to β-lactam antibiotics is the production of β-lactamase. β-Lactamase catalyzes the hydrolysis of the amide bond in the β-lactam ring to create an ineffective antimicrobial (1.Bush K. Jacoby G.A. Medeiros A.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (2129) Google Scholar). There are four classes (A−D) of β-lactamases based on primary sequence homology (2.Ambler R.P. Coulson F.W. Frere J.-M. Ghuysen J.-M. Joris B. Forsman M. Levesque R.C. Tiraby G. Waley S.G. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). TEM-1 β-lactamase is a class A enzyme and is the most prevalent plasmid-encoded β-lactamase in Gram-negative bacteria (3.Wiedemann B. Kliebe C. Kresken M. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1989; 24: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It is capable of hydrolyzing penicillins and many cephalosporins (1.Bush K. Jacoby G.A. Medeiros A.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (2129) Google Scholar). Because it is widespread and has a broad substrate profile, TEM-1 β-lactamase poses a significant threat to antibiotic therapy. One strategy for overcoming β-lactamase-mediated drug resistance is the use of small molecule, mechanism-based β-lactamase inhibitors such as sulbactam, tazobactam, and clavulanic acid (4.Parker R.H. Eggleston M. Infect. Control (Thorofare). 1987; 8: 36-40Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These inhibitors are used in conjunction with existing β-lactam antibiotics to successfully treat infections by bacterial pathogens that produce β-lactamase. In recent years, however, bacteria resistant to the β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combination have evolved. The resistance is due to mutations in TEM-1 or the related SHV-1 β-lactamase that create enzymes that do not react efficiently with the small molecule inhibitors but retain the ability to hydrolyze β-lactam antibiotics (5.Imtiaz U. Billings E. Knox J.R. Manavathu E.K. Lerner S.A. Mobashery S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 4435-4442Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 6.Knox J.R. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 2593-2601Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Clavulanic acid is produced by the soil bacterium Streptomyces clavuligerus (7.Reading C. Cole M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1977; 11: 852-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). This bacterial species also synthesizes a protein inhibitor of β-lactamase called the β-lactamase inhibitory protein (BLIP)1 (8.Doran J.L. Leskiw B.K. Aippersbach S. Jensen S.E. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4909-4918Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). BLIP is a 165-amino acid protein that has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of class A β-lactamases including TEM-1 β-lactamase (K i = 0.1 nm) (9.Strynadka N.C.J. Jensen S.E. Johns K. Blanchard H. Page M. Matagne A. Frere J.-M. James M.N.G. Nature. 1994; 368: 657-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 10.Petrosino J. Rudgers G. Gilbert H. Palzkill T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2394-2400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The co-crystal structure of BLIP with TEM-1 β-lactamase indicates that a β-hairpin including residues 46–51 of BLIP inserts into the active site of β-lactamase (11.Strynadka N.C.J. Jensen S.E. Alzari P.M. James M.N.G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 290-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). An aspartic acid residue at position 49 of the hairpin is positioned in the active site to form hydrogen bonds with four catalytic residues of β-lactamase. In addition, a phenylalanine at position 142 on the other loop occupies a position in the active site similar to the position that the benzyl group of β-lactam antibiotic penicillin G occupies during substrate binding and catalysis (11.Strynadka N.C.J. Jensen S.E. Alzari P.M. James M.N.G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 290-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Replacement of Asp49 with Ala lowers the binding affinity approximately 80-fold, whereas substitution of Phe142 with Ala results in a 300-fold decrease in binding affinity (10.Petrosino J. Rudgers G. Gilbert H. Palzkill T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2394-2400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Thus, Asp49 and Phe142 make important contributions to the stability of the inhibitory complex. The display of proteins on the surface of filamentous phage is a powerful method to select variants of a protein with desired binding properties from large combinatorial libraries of mutants (12.O'Neil K.T. Hoess R.H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 443-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The display of a protein of interest can often be achieved by fusing it to the N terminus of the M13 gene III coat protein (13.Lowman H.B. Bass S.H. Simpson N. Wells J.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10832-10838Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 14.Lowman H.B. Wells J.A. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1991; 3: 205-216Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). High affinity variants can be obtained by direct selection of combinatorial libraries of mutant proteins displayed on the phage against a corresponding immobilized receptor protein (12.O'Neil K.T. Hoess R.H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 443-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 14.Lowman H.B. Wells J.A. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1991; 3: 205-216Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated that functional BLIP can be displayed on the surface of M13 phage as a fusion to the gene III coat protein (15.Huang W. Petrosino J. Palzkill T. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 2893-2897Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study we have created libraries of random mutants at positions including residues 46–51 of the β-hairpin of BLIP as well as within a region containing the important Phe142 residue. The libraries have been used to select BLIP derivatives that are potent inhibitors of TEM-1 β-lactamase. Escherichia coliXL1-Blue (F′::Tn10 proA + B + lacI q Δ(lacZ)M15/recA1,endA1, gyrA96 (Nalr),thi-1, hsdR17, supE44,relA1, lac) (16.Bullock W.O. Fernandez J.M. Short J.M. BioTechniques. 1987; 5: 376-379Google Scholar) (Stratagene, Inc.) was used for transformation of ligation reactions to construct the random libraries.E. coli TG1 (17.Gibson T.J. Ph.D. thesis. Cambridge University, 1984Google Scholar) (F′ traD36+,lacI q, Δ(lacZ) M15proA + B +/supEΔ(hsdM mcrB) (r−m− McrB −) thi Δ(lac proAB)) was used for production, amplification, and determination of the titer of bacteriophage. The pG3-BLIP vector encodes chloramphenicol resistance and contains BLIP as a fusion to the N terminus of the gene III coat protein (15.Huang W. Petrosino J. Palzkill T. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 2893-2897Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The secretion of the BLIP-gene III protein fusion is directed by the β-lactamase signal sequence, and transcription of the fusion is controlled by the constitutive β-lactamase promoter (15.Huang W. Petrosino J. Palzkill T. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 2893-2897Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For this study, the pG3-BLIP vector was altered by the insertion of a His6 tag after the secretion signal sequence. The resulting vector, pTP154, directs the expression of BLIP with a His6tag at the N terminus to the surface of the phage. Both the pG3-BLIP and pTP154 vectors contain an amber codon between BLIP and gene III. Therefore, it is necessary to propagate phage in E. colistrains containing an amber suppressor gene. The BLIP 46–48, 49–51, and 141–143 random libraries were constructed by overlap extension PCR (18.Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). The construction of the 46–48 library will be described as an example. The mutagenesis was accomplished with two rounds of PCR amplification with the following primers: BLIPXHOI, 5-CGGGCCGGCTCGAGGAGCGGGGGTGATGACCGGGGCGAAGTTC-3; L46–48-Top, 5-ACTGCCGGGGGCACNNSNNSNNSGACTACTACGCCTA-3; L46–48-Bot, 5-GGCGTAGGCGTAGTAGTCSNNSNNSNNGTGCCCCCGGCAGT-3; and BLIPXBAI, 5-CGGGCCGTCTAGAATACAAGGTCCCACTGCCGCTTG-3. In the first round, an amplification was performed with the primers BLIPXHOI and L46–48-Bot, and a separate amplification was performed with the primers L46–48-Top and BLIPXBAI in a total volume of 100 μl for each reaction. In the second round, 1 μl of each of the two reactions from the first round was used as a template in an amplification using the BLIPXHOI and BLIPXBAI primers. The L46–48-Top and L46–48-Bot primers have complementary sequences, and therefore the PCR products from the first round have overlapping complementary sequences that allow an extension reaction to occur between the PCR products from round 1. The BLIPXHOI and BLIPXBAI primers serve to amplify the overlap extension products. The resulting PCR product was purified using a Qiaquick column (Qiagen) and digested with the restriction enzymes XhoI and XbaI. The digested DNA fragment was gel-purified and ligated with the pTP154 vector, which had been digested with SalI and XbaI. The ligation reaction was used to transform E. coli XL1-Blue cells by electroporation. A total of 2.9 × 106colonies was pooled for the 46–48 library, giving a >95% probability of all possible amino acid combinations represented in the libraries (19.Palzkill T. Botstein D. Proteins. 1992; 14: 29-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The 49–51 and 141–143 libraries consisted of 3.9 × 106 and 2.3 × 106 pooled transformants, respectively. E. coli cultures containing the pooled colonies from the library constructions were grown to A 600 of 0.6 in 25 ml of 2YT (16 g of tryptone, 10 g of yeast extract, 5 g of NaCl per liter) supplemented with 12.5 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Approximately 1 × 109 VCS M13 helper phage were then added, and the culture was grown overnight with shaking at 37 °C. The E. colicells were removed by centrifugation, and the phage were precipitated from the supernatant with a 0.2 volume of 20% polyethylene glycol, 2.5m NaCl. The phage were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in 0.01 original culture volume of STE (0.1 mNaCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0)). The phage titer was determined by making serial dilutions of a 0.1-ml total volume and adding 0.2 ml of E. coli TG1 cells. Aliquots of 0.15 ml were plated on Luria-Bertani agar supplemented with 12.5 μg/ml chloramphenicol. After overnight growth at 37 °C, the number of colonies was determined, and the titer was calculated. Panning was performed by coating wells in a 96-well microtiter plate with 0.2 ml of a 10 μg/ml solution of purified TEM-1 β-lactamase or bovine serum albumin in 0.05 mNa2CO3 (pH 9.6) overnight at 4 °C. The wells were then blocked for nonspecific binding with 0.2 ml of SUPERBLOCK (Pierce) for 1 h. The wells were washed four times with 0.2 ml of wash buffer (Tris-buffered saline containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 0.5 g/liter Tween 20) (27.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A total of 1 × 1011 phage from the library to be panned was added to the β-lactamase-coated well in a volume of 0.2 ml and allowed to bind for 2 h at room temperature. Wells were washed 10 times with 0.2 ml of wash buffer, and phage retained in the wells were eluted with 0.2 ml of elution buffer (0.1 m glycine HCl (pH 2.2), 100 mm KCl, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Tween 20). The mixture was neutralized by adding 20 μl of 1 m Tris-Cl, pH 8.0. The number of phage eluted was determined by titering for colony-forming units using E. coli TG1 as described above. The eluted phage were amplified for additional rounds of panning by adding 0.15 ml of the neutralized elution mixture to 1 ml of E. coli TG1 cells. After 30 min of incubation at room temperature, 25 ml of 2YT medium were added along with 109 VCS M13 helper phage. The phage were precipitated as described above after overnight incubation with shaking at 37 °C. Wild-type BLIP and mutant BLIP derivatives contain a His6 tag and were purified using metal affinity chromatography and gel filtration chromatography as described previously (10.Petrosino J. Rudgers G. Gilbert H. Palzkill T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2394-2400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The mutant BLIP genes were transferred from the phage display vector to the pTP123 expression vector by digestion withSacI and XbaI to release the BLIP gene followed by insertion of this fragment into pTP123 that had been digested withSacI and XbaI. The pTP123 expression vector provides for isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible expression of BLIP (10.Petrosino J. Rudgers G. Gilbert H. Palzkill T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2394-2400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Inhibition assays were performed as described previously (10.Petrosino J. Rudgers G. Gilbert H.

Petrosino J. Palzkill T. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 2893-2897Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the experiments described here the phagemid was modified to include a His6 tag following the secretion signal sequence at the N terminus of mature BLIP. It is known that the addition of a His6 tag to soluble BLIP does not affect its function (10.Petrosino J. Rudgers G. Gilbert H. Palzkill T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2394-2400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay experiments confirmed that phage displaying the His6-tagged BLIP have the same binding properties as phage displaying wild-type BLIP (data not shown). It is known from the crystal structure of the BLIP-β-lactamase complex as well as from mutagenesis results that the residues of the 46–51 β-hairpin as well as a second β-hairpin containing Phe142 of BLIP make important interactions with the active site of TEM-1 β-lactamase (10.Petrosino J. Rudgers G. Gilbert H. Palzkill T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2394-2400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 11.Strynadka N.C.J. Jensen S.E. Alzari P.M. James M.N.G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 290-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Therefore, these regions were targeted for random mutagenesis to create libraries of amino acid substitutions. BLIP residues were randomized in blocks of three to create libraries containing all possible amino acid combinations for positions 46–48, 49–51, and 141–143 (Fig.1). Overlap extension PCR was used to create each of the random libraries as described under “Experimental Procedures” (18.Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). All of the libraries contain greater than 106 clones and therefore have a >95% probability of containing all possible amino acid combinations over each three-residue window (19.Palzkill T. Botstein D. Proteins. 1992; 14: 29-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Each random library contains 203 or 8000 possible amino acid sequences over the region randomized. The libraries were sorted for variants that bind tightly to TEM-1 β-lactamase by immobilizing β-lactamase and allowing phage particles that display the set of BLIP sequences to bind. After extensive washing, the bound phage were eluted from the wells and used to infect E. coli. A portion of the infected culture was spread on agar plates to determine the number of eluted phage particles, whereas the remainder of the culture was used to amplify the phage for additional rounds of binding enrichment. After one round of panning, the BLIP 46–48 random library was not enriched for any specific sequences (Fig.2). After three rounds of panning, however, the library was strongly enriched for the sequence Pro46-Ser47-Asn48 (Fig. 2). To ensure that the Pro46-Ser47-Asn48enrichment was not due simply to chance, the 46–48 library panning experiment was repeated two additional times. In the second set of panning experiments, the Pro46-Ser47-Asn48 sequence was not observed after three rounds of panning. However, the closely related Pro46-Ser47-Ala48 and Pro46-Ser47-Ser48 sequences were found. In a third set of panning experiments, the Pro46-Ser47-Ala48 sequence was again found. These results suggest that variants containing proline and serine at positions 46 and 47 are enriched by panning. Furthermore, an examination of the sequences of clones from round three of all of the trials indicates a strong bias for serine at position 47 irrespective of the presence of proline at position 46. Panning of the 49–51 library on β-lactamase resulted in random sequences after one round of panning (Fig.3). After three rounds, however, only clones with the sequence Asn49-Ser50-Tyr51 were observed, suggesting that this sequence encodes a BLIP variant with tight binding affinity. The Asn49-Ser50-Tyr51sequence was again detected among enriched phage populations when the panning experiment was repeated two additional times. The sequence Asn49-Gly50-Tyr51 was also observed multiple times in the repeated panning experiments. Among the clones obtained after three rounds of panning in each of the trials, it is apparent that asparagine is strongly preferred at position 49. This result is surprising because aspartate at position 49 is thought to make critical interactions with the active site of β-lactamase. A possible explanation is that asparagine improves the stability of the type II′ turn and that this improved stability compensates for altered interactions with the active site. Several types of sequences were selected after three rounds of panning of the 141–143 library (Fig. 4). The strongest consensus was observed for position 143, where asparagine was present in 18 of the 29 clones that were sequenced. Large hydrophobic residues similar to the wild-type phenylalanine were observed at position 142 among the phage enriched for binding. Previous studies indicate that substitution of the wild-type phenylalanine with alanine at position 142 results in a 300-fold loss in binding affinity (10.Petrosino J. Rudgers G. Gilbert H. Palzkill T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2394-2400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These results suggest that large hydrophobic residues can effectively substitute for phenylalanine at this position. At position 141 the wild-type glycine and serine were the predominant sequences observed. Taken together, the sequencing results for the three positions suggest that the exact wild-type 141–143 sequence is not essential for binding. The finding that many non-wild-type sequences were enriched after panning of the BLIP libraries suggests that these mutants bind β-lactamase as tightly as, or possibly more tightly than, does wild-type BLIP. This hypothesis was tested by expressing and purifying representative BLIP mutants from each of the libraries. Each of the purified proteins was tested for the ability to bind and inhibit purified TEM-1 β-lactamase in an in vitro binding assay. The results of the binding assays for the Pro46-Ser47-Ala48, Asn49-Gly50-Tyr51, and Gly141-Ile142-Asn143 mutants are shown in Table I. These particular mutants were chosen based on the frequency of occurrence among the selected clones and on the ability to overexpress and purify these proteins. It is apparent that the Pro46-Ser47-Ala48 mutant, despite having been selected from the library, binds β-lactamase with a similar affinity as does wild-type BLIP. In contrast, the Asn49-Gly50-Tyr51 mutant binds β-lactamase 10-fold tighter than does wild-type BLIP (Table I and Fig. 5). This result confirms that asparagine can effectively substitute for aspartate at position 49 despite the numerous interactions that aspartate makes with the β-lactamase active site. The Gly141-Ile142-Asn143 mutant binds β-lactamase approximately 2-fold tighter than does wild-type BLIP. Taken together, the results suggest that the panning experiments effectively identify mutants with a range of binding affinities from slightly less to severalfold greater than that of wild type. Several studies have shown that mutations that individually increase binding affinity between proteins often act additively when combined into a single molecule (20.Wells J.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8509-8517Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar, 21.Dennis M.S. Lazarus R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22129-22136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This hypothesis was tested for the Asn49-Gly50-Tyr51 and Gly141-Ile142-Asn143 mutants by combining these substitutions into a single BLIP construct. The Asn49-Gly50-Tyr51/Gly141-Ile142-Asn143BLIP mutant was purified and shown to inhibit TEM-1 β-lactamase with a K i of 0.02 nm (Table I). Therefore, the Asn49-Gly50-Tyr51 and Gly141-Ile142-Asn143 substitutions do not act additively. This suggests that the sequence context of the 49–51 turn influences the interactions of the residues of the 141–143 turn with β-lactamase or vice versa. The 46–51 BLIP turn structure containing Asp49 is a Type II′ β-turn (9.Strynadka N.C.J. Jensen S.E. Johns K. Blanchard H. Page M. Matagne A. Frere J.-M. James M.N.G. Nature. 1994; 368: 657-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). It is possible that amino acid substitutions within the turn in BLIP mutants that retain high binding affinity for β-lactamase maintain the Type II′ turn structure and simultaneously retain contacts with the β-lactamase active site. Alternatively, the substitutions may alter the conformation of the turn and promote new interactions with the β-lactamase active site. Hutchinson and Thornton (22.Hutchinson E.G. Thornton J.M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2207-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar) examined 3898 β-turns and derived sequence preferences for the i, i + 1, i + 2, and i + 3 positions that comprise a Type II′ turn. For the BLIP β-turn, Ala47 is at position i, Gly48 is ati + 1, Asp49 is at i + 2, and Tyr50 is at i + 3. According to the derived sequence potentials, tyrosine, valine, and serine are the preferred residue types at position i. The sequence replacement data obtained from the combinatorial phage display libraries indicate a strong preference for serine at position 47 (i). The fact that serine has a higher turn potential than the wild-type alanine has at the i position suggests that the serine substitution acts to stabilize the Type II′ turn structure. At position i + 1, glycine has a much higher calculated turn potential than does any other residue (22.Hutchinson E.G. Thornton J.M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2207-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). Glycine was also selected at position 48 multiple times from the 46–48 phage display library (Fig. 2). The next highest potentials for the i + 1 position are serine and alanine, which were also selected multiple times from the library (Fig. 2). Therefore, the results are again consistent with the notion that the substitutions selected from the libraries act to stabilize the Type II′ turn. It is also of interest that when a residue other than glycine occurs at position i + 1, a proline is almost invariably found at position 46, which is the i− 1 position (Fig. 2). A proline is also at this position in the leech decorsin protein, which has an RGD motif in a Type II′ turn (23.Krezel A.M. Wagner G. Seymour-Ulmer J. Lazarus R.A. Science. 1994; 264: 1944-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The limited flexibility of proline may provide rigidity or stability to the turn that permits a residue other than glycine at position i+ 1. The residues with the highest calculated Type II′ turn potentials at the i + 2 position are asparagine followed by serine and then aspartate (22.Hutchinson E.G. Thornton J.M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2207-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). Interestingly, asparagine was clearly the preferred residue at this position among the mutants selected from the 49–51 phage display library (Fig. 3). Thus, a possible explanation for the observed preference for asparagine over aspartate at position 49 is that the Type II′ turn is more stable with asparagine at thei + 2 position and that this increased stability compensates for any interactions that are lost by replacement of the wild-type aspartate residue. Threonine and glycine have the highest Type II′ turn potential at thei + 3 position (22.Hutchinson E.G. Thornton J.M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2207-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). Glycine was repeatedly selected at this position from the 49–51 phage display library (Fig. 4). Thus, at all of the Type II′ turn positions (47–50) the residues most frequently selected from the phage display libraries were those with high Type II′ turn potentials (22.Hutchinson E.G. Thornton J.M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2207-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). This result suggests that stabilization of the Type II′ turn is an important factor in the selection for tight binding BLIP mutants from the random libraries. It is possible that a Type II′ turn evolved in this region because the sequence requirements for a Type II′ turn overlapped the chemical requirements for binding interactions of the BLIP side chains with the β-lactamase active site. The predominant site of interaction between the turn containing residues 141–143 and β-lactamase is at phenylalanine 142 (11.Strynadka N.C.J. Jensen S.E. Alzari P.M. James M.N.G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 290-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The large, hydrophobic side chain is inserted in the β-lactamase active site where the chain makes several interactions (11.Strynadka N.C.J. Jensen S.E. Alzari P.M. James M.N.G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 290-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Consistent with an important role in binding, substitution of position 142 with alanine results in a 300-fold decrease in affinity (10.Petrosino J. Rudgers G. Gilbert H. Palzkill T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2394-2400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The results of the selection of binding mutants from the phage libraries suggest that the function of phenylalanine can be fulfilled by other large, hydrophobic side chains. The Type II′ turn consisting of BLIP residues 47–50 is similar to a Type II′ turn in matrix proteins such as fibronectin that is used to bind cell surface integrins such as the platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (24.Lazarus R.A. McDowell R.S. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1993; 4: 438-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These matrix proteins contain a consensus Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence within the Type II′ turn. The RGD sequence is found at the apex of solvent-accessible, flexible loops of proteins of different structural folds (24.Lazarus R.A. McDowell R.S. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1993; 4: 438-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The RGD Type II′ turn can be introduced onto other protein scaffolds where it retains binding function. In addition, cyclic peptides consisting of the RGD turn have been shown to retain the ability to bind integrins in the absence of the scaffold protein (25.Jackson S. DeGrado W. Dwivedi A. Parthasarathy A. Higley A. Krywko J. Rockwell A. Markwalder J. Wells G. Wexler R. Mousa S. Harlow R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 3220-3230Crossref Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The equivalent residues in BLIP to the Arg-Gly-Asp sequence are found in the Ala47-Gly48-Asp49sequence. Studies are in progress to determine whether the 47–50 Type II′ turn of BLIP retains binding function when grafted onto other protein scaffolds and to determine whether a cyclic peptide containing the 47–50 region can interact with β-lactamase. The results presented here indicate that although wild-type BLIP binds TEM-1 β-lactamase with a K i of 0.1 nm, the BLIP amino acid sequence is not optimally evolved for binding TEM-1 β-lactamase. This is not surprising because BLIP is produced by the soil bacterium S. clavuligerus and TEM-1 β-lactamase is found in enteric bacteria, and therefore these proteins did not co-evolve (8.Doran J.L. Leskiw B.K. Aippersbach S. Jensen S.E. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4909-4918Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the BLIP molecule must have evolved to bind a protein that closely resembles TEM-1 β-lactamase in order to coincidentally bind TEM-1 β-lactamase so tightly. The natural substrate of BLIP is unknown. Nevertheless, the finding that BLIP binds to multiple β-lactamases (9.Strynadka N.C.J. Jensen S.E. Johns K. Blanchard H. Page M. Matagne A. Frere J.-M. James M.N.G. Nature. 1994; 368: 657-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and that the binding affinity can be adjusted by protein engineering presents an opportunity to design new inhibitors for these clinically important targets."

We investigated the effects of GH on Ca2+ handling and diacylglycerol (DAG) and cAMP formation in the β-cell. GH elicited a rapid increase in the cytoplasmic free [Ca2+], which required extracellular Ca2+ and was also blocked by pertussis toxin or protein kinase C (PKC) inhibition. GH also elevated islet DAG content, which should lead to PKC activation. Pertussis toxin and PKC inhibitors obliterated the mitogenicity of GH, suggesting involvement of GTP-binding proteins. PKC activation stimulated β-cell proliferation, and it also activated phospholipase D. Islet cAMP content was not elevated by GH. Addition of a specific protein kinase A antagonist failed to influence the mitogenicity of GH, whereas a stimulatory cAMP agonist stimulated β-cell replication. We conclude that GH rapidly increases the β-cell cytoplasmic free [Ca2+] and also evokes a similar increase in DAG content via a phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C, but does not affect mitogen-activated protein kinases, phospholipase D, or the cAMP signaling pathway. This rise in DAG may be of importance in translation of the stimulatory signal of GH into a proliferative response by the β-cell, which seems to occur through GTP-binding proteins and PKC-dependent mechanisms.

Since previous studies have established a defective insulin secretory response to glucose as well as a decreased β-cell volume in diabetic patients (1.Hellerström C. Andersson A. Swenne I. Welsh M. Welsh N. Sjöholm Å. Grill V. Efendić S. Pathogenesis of Non-insulin-dependent Diabetes Mellitus: Nobel Symposium Proceedings. Raven Press, New York1988: 79-91Google Scholar), further elucidation of factors governing insulin production and β-cell proliferation is clearly warranted. In contrast to other tissues (e.g. the liver) that readily regenerate, the adult insulin-producing pancreatic β-cell is characterized by a limited proliferative potential (1.Hellerström C. Andersson A. Swenne I. Welsh M. Welsh N. Sjöholm Å. Grill V. Efendić S. Pathogenesis of Non-insulin-dependent Diabetes Mellitus: Nobel Symposium Proceedings. Raven Press, New York1988: 79-91Google Scholar). Additionally, its capacity to divide diminishes by increasing age, when glucose intolerance becomes more prevalent (1.Hellerström C. Andersson A. Swenne I. Welsh M. Welsh N. Sjöholm Å. Grill V. Efendić S. Pathogenesis of Non-insulin-dependent Diabetes Mellitus: Nobel Symposium Proceedings. Raven Press, New York1988: 79-91Google Scholar). Conversely, expansion of the pancreatic β-cell mass by recruitment of β-cells to proliferate may constitute a means by which the organism can compensate for the loss or dysfunction of β-cells occurring in diabetes. Thus, if β-cells could be induced to replicate at a higher rate, this may prove beneficial in maintaining normoglycemia. Importantly, when the adult β-cell population is expanded in vivo by “cellophane wrapping” of the pancreas, this not only induces islet hyperplasia resembling nesidioblastosis, but also ameliorates experimental diabetes in hamsters (2.Rosenberg L. Duguid W. Brown R.A. Vinik A. Diabetes. 1988; 37: 334-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Despite the potential importance of an insufficient extent of β-cell replication in diabetes, not much is known about the intracellular mechanisms that normally govern this event, although some extracellular factors stimulating β-cell DNA synthesis in vitro have been identified (3.Sjöholm Å. FEBS Lett. 1992; 311: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 4.Sjöholm Å. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C501-C518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One of the most potent mitogenic factors is growth hormone (GH),1 but not much is known about the molecular events that convey the stimulatory signal of GH into a mitogenic response by the β-cell (5.Hellerström C. Sjöholm Å. Swenne I. Acta Paediatr. Scand. Suppl. 1991; 377: 55-62Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In other cell systems, increases in the cytoplasmic free Ca2+concentration ([Ca2+]i), polyphosphoinositide and phosphatidylcholine hydrolysis, and protein kinase activation are among the earliest changes taking place after mitogenic stimulation (reviewed in Refs. 6.Rozengurt E. Science. 1986; 234: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar, 7.Exton J.H. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1993; 264: C501-C518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, in this study, we have utilized an in vitro system of fetal rat islets enriched in rapidly proliferating β-cells to study the putative role of [Ca2+]i, GTP-binding proteins, polyphosphoinositide and phosphatidylcholine hydrolysis, and protein kinase activation in the proliferative signal induced by GH. In addition, we have employed various pharmacological probes to pin down the locus in the signal transduction pathway where GH acts and have furthermore attempted to elucidate the functional significance of this event. Recombinant human GH was kindly provided by Dr. Anna Skottner (Pharmacia & Upjohn Corp., Stockholm, Sweden). TheS p- and R p-diastereomers of cAMP-S ((S p)-cAMP-S and (R p)-cAMP-S, respectively) were provided by Biolog Life Science Institute (Bremen, Germany). They were dissolved in RPMI 1640 medium and stored at 4 °C as 1000-fold concentrated stock solutions. [methyl-3H]Thymidine (5 Ci/mmol), [γ-32P]ATP (100–500 cpm/pmol), [9,10-3H]myristate, and the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and cAMP assay kits were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). Unisolve was from NEN Life Science Products, and Soluene was provided by Packard Instrument Co. Collagenase type CLS (EC 3.4.24.3) was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Mannheim, Germany).

Forskolin, DAG kinase, calmidazolium, protein kinase A inhibitor protein α, calphostin C, and H-7 (1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine) were obtained from Calbiochem. Rabbit anti-phosphotyrosine IgG was from Zymed Laboratories Inc. D-600 was a generous gift from Knoll AG (Ludwigshafen-am-Rhein, Germany), and Kieselgel 60 plates and all other chemicals of analytical grade were obtained from E. Merck AG (Darmstadt, Germany). Pregnant Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats belonging to a local stock or Wistar rats purchased from B&K Universal (Sollentuna, Sweden) were killed by cervical dislocation on day 21 of gestation, and the fetuses were rapidly removed. Fetal rat islets were prepared from pancreatic glands as described previously (11.Hellerström C. Lewis N.J. Borg H. Johnson R. Freinkel N. Diabetes. 1979; 28: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 12.Sjöholm Å. Welsh N. Sandler S. Hellerström C. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: C828-C833Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the pancreata were finely chopped and digested for a short time with collagenase. The carefully washed digest was plated in culture dishes allowing cell attachment (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) and cultured for 5 days at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in ambient air in RPMI 1640 medium containing 11.1 mm glucose, 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml benzylpenicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. At the end of the culture period, groups of islets were transferred to fresh medium containing 1% fetal calf serum and cultured free-floating overnight, a procedure that minimizes fibroblast proliferation. Spherical islets, free of connective tissue, were then selected under a stereomicroscope and used for the different analyses described below. In each experiment, all test groups received the same amount of solvent. Islets in groups of 50 were cultured as described above. During the last 5 h, 1 μCi/ml [methyl-3H]thymidine was present in culture medium. At the end of the labeling period, the islets were rinsed once in PBS, sonicated in 200 μl of redistilled water, and precipitated in 1 ml of ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid. The precipitate was washed twice in trichloroacetic acid and dissolved in 50 μl of Soluene. The radioactivity incorporated was determined by scintillation counting after addition of 1 ml of Unisolve. It has been shown previously that fetal rat islets, serum-starved overnight, are able to respond fully mitogenically to GH (12.Sjöholm Å. Welsh N. Sandler S. Hellerström C. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: C828-C833Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, islets prepared by this method appear to be essentially devoid of fibroblast contamination, as visualized by electron microscopy (11.Hellerström C. Lewis N.J. Borg H. Johnson R. Freinkel N. Diabetes. 1979; 28: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar); contain >90% β-cells; and do not respond to classical fibroblast mitogens such as epidermal growth factor, transforming growth factor α, or platelet-derived growth factor with increased DNA synthesis (12.Sjöholm Å. Welsh N. Sandler S. Hellerström C. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: C828-C833Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Duplicate samples of the homogenate were analyzed fluorometrically for DNA (13.Kissane J.M. Robins E. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 233: 184-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Hinegardner R.T. Anal. Biochem. 1971; 39: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). Islets were cultured as described above. Monolayers of cells were prepared as described (15.Lernmark Å. Diabetologia. 1974; 10: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) by shaking in a Ca2+-free medium containing EGTA and cultured overnight on plastic coverslips. They were then loaded for 30 min with 1 μm fura-2/AM in culture medium at 37 °C. After rinsing, the coverslip was placed at the bottom of an open perifusion chamber (150-μl volume) connected to a two-channel peristaltic pump, allowing constant superfusion of cells. The chamber was mounted on a thermostatically controlled stage of an inverted microscope (Zeiss Axiovert 35M) connected to a Spex Fluorolog-2 CM1T11Y system. Fluorescence measurements were performed at 37 °C using excitation and emission wavelengths of 340/380 and 510 nm, respectively. Cells were superfused at a flow rate of 500 μl/min with buffer (pH 7.4) containing 125 mm NaCl, 5.9 mmKCl, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mmMgCl2, 3 mmd-glucose, 25 mm HEPES, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Additions of GH and other substances were made in the same buffer. Clusters of two to four β-cells or a single islet was localized with the microscope and selected for [Ca2+]i measurements. Occasional fibroblast-like elements were identified, but were avoided. All traces shown are typical for experiments repeated with at least three different cell preparations, and [Ca2+]i is expressed as the ratio of the fluorescence measured at 340 and 380 nm. Groups of 250–300 islets were cultured free-floating overnight in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 1% fetal calf serum. Islets were then swiftly transferred to Eppendorf tubes containing 1 ml of conditioned medium (prewarmed to 37 °C) supplemented with 1 μg/ml GH or 200 μm ATP. In experiments designed to elucidate the dependence of extracellular Ca2+ for the ability of GH to raise DAG, islets were washed three times and then incubated for 5 min at 37 °C in buffer (pH 7.4) containing 125 mm NaCl, 5.9 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 3 mmd-glucose, 25 mm HEPES, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin with or without 1.3 mmCaCl2. Islets were incubated for the indicated time periods, rapidly pelleted, and quickly rinsed once in ice-cold PBS. Tubes were then immediately plunged into liquid nitrogen (−196 °C) and kept frozen at −80 °C, pending further analysis of their DAG content. The islets were sonicated in a 500-μl chloroform solution consisting of chloroform/methanol/HCl (100:100:1, v/v/v) and 100 μl of PBS containing 10 mm EDTA. After centrifugation (5 min, 12,000 × g), the aqueous phase was removed and re-extracted with 100 μl of chloroform, which was added to the chloroform phase. The combined chloroform phases were evaporated under a stream of liquid nitrogen and resolubilized in 50 μl of the chloroform solution. This solution was re-extracted with 10 μl of PBS containing 10 mm EDTA and then re-evaporated. Samples were then stored at −70 °C under nitrogen until analyzed for DAG. 1,2-Diacylglycerols were quantified essentially according to Preiss et al. (16.Preiss J. Loomis C.R. Bishop W.R. Stein R. Niedel J.E. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8597-8600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, dried lipids were solubilized in 20 μl of an octyl β-d-glucoside/cardiolipin solution (7.5% octyl β-d-glucoside and 5 mm cardiolipin in 1 mm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid) by sonication in a bath sonicator. The reaction was then carried out in 100 μl containing 20 μl of sample solution, 50 mm imidazole HCl (pH 6.6), 50 mm NaCl, 12.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 6.6 μg of DAG kinase, and 1 mm[γ-32P]ATP for 30 min at room temperature. Lipids were extracted and evaporated as described above. Samples were then run on Kieselgel 60 plates activated by preheating at 120 °C. Plates were developed with chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (65:15:5, v/v/v) and subjected to autoradiography. Standard samples ofd-1,2-dipalmitin were run in parallel. The intensities of the spots corresponding to phosphatidic acid were quantified by densitometry and are expressed as arbitrary units (optical density). Fifty islets were metabolically labeled with [3H]myristate (0.8 μCi/ml) in 4 ml of serum-free RPMI 1640 medium for 24 h. Islets were pretreated with 0.5% ethanol for 5 min and next stimulated with 1 μg/ml GH or 300 nm 4β-phorbol dibutyrate for 5 min. The medium was removed by centrifugation, and the islets were suspended in cold MeOH and 0.9% NaCl. Total lipids were extracted after addition of 1 ml of CHCl3, followed by vigorous vortexing, and the organic phase was dried under a stream of N2. The residue was applied to a silica gel TLC plate that was developed in the upper phase of H2O/HAc/isooctane/ethyl acetate (100:20:50:110, v/v/v/v) (17.Billah M.M. Pai J.-K. Mullman T.J. Egan R.W. Siegel M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9069-9076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The starting zone (containing polar lipids) and the zones co-chromatographing with authentic standards of phosphatidic acid and phosphatidylethanol (R F = 0.1 and 0.2, respectively) were scraped into scintillation vials containing 0.5 ml of MeOH. Radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The activities in phosphatidic acid and phosphatidylethanol were normalized to the activity in the starting zone (typically ∼30,000 cpm) to account for slight variations in labeling between different experiments. Duplicate sets of islets were analyzed in each experiment. Batches of 50–200 islets were cultured free-floating overnight in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium and exposed to GH for the indicated time periods. The islets were then rinsed in 5 ml of ice-cold PBS and 0.5 ml of ice-cold extraction buffer (18.Ahn N.G. Weiel J.E. Chan C.P. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11487-11494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) containing 50 mm β-glycerophosphate (pH 7.3), 1.5 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm benzamidine, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin A. Islets were homogenized by ultrasonic disruption for 10 s, and a cytosolic fraction was prepared by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C. The kinase incubation medium contained 0.5 mg/ml myelin basic protein (a substrate for MAPKs (19.Erickson A.K. Payne D.M. Martino P.A. Rossomando A.J. Shabanowitz J. Weber M.J. Hunt D.F. Sturgill T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19728-19735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), 50 mm β-glycerophosphate (pH 7.3), 1.5 mmEGTA, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP (0.1 μCi/nmol), 2 μm recombinant rabbit PKA inhibitor protein α, and 10 μm calmidazolium. Aliquots (37.5 μl) of cytosolic extracts or the chromatographic eluate were used in a final volume of 75 μl. The incubation was allowed to proceed for 20 min at 30 °C, after which the reaction mixture was spotted onto 2-cm2phosphocellulose paper, and the reaction was terminated by immersing the paper in 1% H3PO4. After removing unreacted [32P]ATP by five changes of H3PO4, the radioactivity associated with the paper was measured in a scintillation counter as Cerenkov radiation. The radioactivity in extraction buffer in control experiments was subtracted, and the cytosolic extract from each dish was used for a separate point. Kinase assays were performed in triplicate. Protein in cytosolic extracts was measured by the Coomassie dye method according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad). For cAMP measurements, islets in groups of 50 that had been cultured for 3 days in the presence or absence of GH or the desired test substances were quickly rinsed once in ice-cold PBS and then swiftly transferred to Eppendorf tubes containing 150 μl of ice-cold 6% trichloroacetic acid. These tubes were immediately sealed, plunged into liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C, pending analysis. The samples were thawed by sonication on ice and centrifuged at 2000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The pellet was re-sonicated in 200 μl of redistilled water and used for measurements of DNA and [3H]thymidine incorporation as detailed above. The supernatant was washed four times in 5 volumes of water-saturated diethyl ether. The aqueous extract was freeze-dried, and the content of cAMP was measured by radioimmunoassay (using 125I-cAMP) exactly as described by the manufacturer of the assay kit. To increase the sensitivity of the method, samples were acetylated. Results presented were derived from at least three independent experiments performed on different days. Means ± S.E. were calculated, and groups of data were compared using Student's paired or unpaired t test. As shown in Fig. 1, stimulation of fetal rat pancreatic islets with 1 μg/ml GH for 3 days evoked a brisk stimulation of β-cell mitogenesis as monitored by [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA. Given the long cell cycle of the β-cell (20.Swenne I. Diabetes. 1982; 31: 754-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and the fact that unsynchronized cells were studied, it was considered necessary to expose the islets for 1–3 days to the different test substances. This procedure allows DNA synthesis initiated prior to addition of GH or other test substances to be terminated before [3H]thymidine addition. Given the mitogenicity of GH, we then set out to clarify by which intracellular signaling systems the hormone acts. Since changes in Ca2+ fluxes occur early in growth promotion (6.Rozengurt E. Science. 1986; 234: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar), we first looked into whether GH affected this pathway. As is evident from Fig.2, stimulation of β-cells with 1 μg/ml GH elicited an increase in [Ca2+]i. The [Ca2+]i increase was rapid and occurred at both a substimulatory (3.3 mm; Fig. 2 A) and a maximally stimulatory (16.7 mm; Fig. 2 B) glucose concentration. The rise in [Ca2+]i evoked by GH was found to be due to influx of Ca2+ across the plasma membrane since it did not occur in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 2 C). The mitogenic response to GH does not seem to require the Ca2+ response, however, because it remained intact in the presence of D-600 (50 μm), a blocker of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (data not shown). Both PKC inhibitors H-7 and calphostin C (1 μm; data not shown) blocked the GH-induced Ca2+ elevation by some 50–60% (Fig. 2,D and E). Pretreatment of islets for 24 h with PTX (50 ng/ml), known to influence signal transduction through heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins connected to PLC and adenylyl cyclase, curtailed the mitogenicity of GH (Fig. 1), indicating that the mitogenic action of GH involves its interaction with such GTP-binding proteins. Additionally, PTX blocked the GH-induced Ca2+ elevation by ∼40% (Fig.2 F). GH also significantly elevated islet DAG content ∼2.3-fold from 5 min of exposure, an increase that remained for at least up to 30 min (Fig.3) and that should activate PKC. After 72 h of exposure to GH, the elevated DAG content could no longer be detected (data not shown). For comparison, after 5 min, islet DAG content was elevated ∼3.7-fold by 200 μm ATP, which also stimulated β-cell mitogenesis by 212 ± 18%. It should be noted that the observed DAG levels (∼300 μm) are well in agreement with those reported previously, assuming an islet volume of 2 nl (21.Turk J. Gross R.W. Ramanadham S. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 367-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). One possible source of DAG, besides breakdown of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate or phosphatidylcholine via specific PLC enzymes, is through the action of PLD and phosphatidate phosphatase. However, when the activity of this latter pathway was measured using the transphosphatidylation technique (17.Billah M.M. Pai J.-K. Mullman T.J. Egan R.W. Siegel M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9069-9076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), no increase in the formation of phosphatidylethanol was observed in islets treated with GH (1 μg/ml) for 5 min (Fig. 4). By contrast, addition of phorbol ester (300 nm 4β-phorbol dibutyrate) elicited a 2-fold stimulatory effect of PLD under these conditions (Fig. 4), thus confirming previous results (22.Dunlop M. Metz S.A. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and indicating a functional PLD system in the β-cell. Because GH was unable to raise [Ca2+]i in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 2 C), it is unlikely that GH would signal through a phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-specific PLC, which catalyzes formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, releasing Ca2+ from intracellular stores (8.Clapham D.E. Cell. 1995; 80: 259-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2250) Google Scholar). We also measured the generation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and found no effect of GH at 20 min (data not shown), when GH-induced DAG accumulation was maximally enhanced. This indicates that DAG was generated through a phosphatidylcholine-specific PLC being activated by GH.Figure 4Phorbol ester, but not GH , activates β-cell phospholipase D. Groups of 50 fetal rat pancreatic islets were prelabeled with [3H]myristate and pretreated with 0.5% ethanol prior to stimulation with GH (1 μg/ml) or 4β-phorbol dibutyrate (PDBu; 300 nm) for 5 min. Phosphatidylethanol and phosphatidic acid were isolated, and their associated radioactivity was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Bars represent means ± S.E. for four separate experiments. The double asterisksdenote p < 0.01 for a chance differenceversus control islets using Student's paired ttest.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Specific activation of PKC with the phorbol ester TPA (10 nm) for 3 days stimulated β-cell proliferation to the same extent as GH (Fig. 1). Conversely, the PKC inhibitor H-7 (10 μm) blocked the mitogenicity of TPA and GH (Fig. 1), suggesting that GH promotes β-cell mitogenesis through PKC activation. Both PKC inhibitors H-7 (Fig. 1) and calphostin C (data not shown) blocked the mitogenicity of GH, glucose, and TPA, but not that of cAMP. It should be noted that not only GH- and TPA-stimulated DNA syntheses were markedly decreased by H-7, but also base-line DNA synthesis to ∼14% of control. Nonetheless, the finding that forskolin could still stimulate DNA synthesis by the same magnitude in H-7-treated islets as in controls (data not shown) argues against a nonspecific general cytotoxicity of H-7, but does not address the question of H-7 specificity. A quantitatively similar mitogenic effect as that of GH and PKC stimulation was obtained with a 10 μm concentration of the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin or with a 50 μmconcentration of the stimulatory cAMP agonist (S p)-cAMP-S, which directly activates PKA types I and II (Fig. 1), confirming that PKA activation promotes β-cell mitogenesis. The islet cAMP content was, however, not changed after 3 days of exposure to 1 μg/ml GH (Fig.5). In contrast, the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin (10 μm) evoked a 4–5-fold increase in cAMP content, and raising the glucose concentration from 3.3 to 16.7 mm elicited a 94% increase in cAMP concentration as assessed by radioimmunoassay (Fig. 5). Addition of the specific PKA antagonist (R p)-cAMP-S (50 μm) prior to stimulating islets with GH failed to influence the mitogenicity of the hormone (Fig. 1), suggesting that GH does not stimulate β-cell proliferation through the cAMP pathway. (R p)-cAMP-S blocked the mitogenic effects of forskolin and (S p)-cAMP-S (data not shown), but not that of GH (Fig. 1). When cytosolic MAPK activity was measured in four different preparations of islets, no discernible effects of GH (1 μg/ml) were observed during 1–60 min of incubation, nor was tyrosine phosphorylation affected in electrophoretic bands corresponding to the mobility of p42 and p44 MAPK (Ref. 23.Möller C. Hansson A. Enberg B. Lobie P.E. Norstedt G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23403-23408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and data not shown). This finding indicates that, in contrast to other tissues, the mitogenicity of GH in the β-cell does not involve activation of these MAPKs. The factors that control the process of pancreatic β-cell replication remain largely unknown, although it has been shown that glucose, amino acids, GH, and polypeptide growth factors can stimulate β-cell replication in vitro (reviewed in Refs. 3.Sjöholm Å. FEBS Lett. 1992; 311: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 4.Sjöholm Å. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C501-C518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Hellerström C. Sjöholm Å. Swenne I. Acta Paediatr. Scand. Suppl. 1991; 377: 55-62Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One of the most potent mitogenic stimuli for the β-cell is GH, a physiologically important hormone whose levels in blood rise during pregnancy and lactation, states that are associated with an expansion of the β-cell mass. In addition, in patients with acromegaly and in rats bearing GH-producing tumors, β-cell growth is promoted (1.Hellerström C. Andersson A. Swenne I. Welsh M. Welsh N. Sjöholm Å. Grill V. Efendić S. Pathogenesis of Non-insulin-dependent Diabetes Mellitus: Nobel Symposium Proceedings. Raven Press, New York1988: 79-91Google Scholar). Compared with other growth factors, surprisingly little is known about the intracellular events that convey the mitogenic signal of GH into a proliferative response in the β-cell. Nonetheless, it has been shown that insulin-secreting cells possess a 115-kDa GH receptor resembling the long form of the cloned hepatic GH receptor, which consists of a 638–650-amino acid protein with a hydrophobic transmembrane-spanning domain (24.Møldrup A. Billestrup N. Nielsen J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8686-8690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In rodent islets, human GH seemingly works mainly through the prolactin receptor (25.Brelje T.C. Parsons J.A. Sorenson R.L. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 263-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). According to the contemporary conceptual framework, binding of GH to its receptor induces"
https://openalex.org/W2002634399,"BSAP (Pax5) is an essential transcription factor for early B cell and central nervous system development. In later B cell development, BSAP has been implicated in the regulation of 3′ Ig enhancers and a number of B cell-specific genes. Previous studies have suggested a role for BSAP-interacting proteins in the regulation of the function of BSAP. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we identified importin α1 (Rch1) as a BSAP-interacting protein. Importin α proteins have been shown to escort proteins into the nucleus through interaction with a nuclear localization signal (NLS), composed of short stretches of basic amino acids. A predicted NLS in BSAP (NKRKRDE, located at amino acids 195–201 in the central domain) was confirmed to be essential for interaction with importin α1 by the yeast two-hybrid assay. Physical interaction between BSAP and importin α1 was detected in vitro by a glutathione S-transferase (GST) pulldown assay. The NLS sequence in BSAP conferred nuclear localization to green fluorescent protein (GFP)-BSAP fusion proteins. Although the N-terminal paired (DNA-binding) domain of BSAP also conferred nuclear localization when coupled to green fluorescent protein, this domain did not bind to importin α1 in the yeast two-hybrid assay. The NLS sequence in the central domain of BSAP binds to the C-terminal 98-amino acid fragment of importin α1.

Wang Z.-Q. Fetka I. Wagner E.F. Busslinger M. Cell. 1994; 79: 901-912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). When the Pax5 gene was inactivated in mice by targeted homologous recombination, defects in the midbrain and in B cell lymphopoiesis were observed, including complete abrogation of fetal B lymphopoiesis and incomplete VH gene construction in adult bone marrow (2.Nutt S.L. Urbanek P. Rolink A. Busslinger M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 476-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Recent studies have reported that preBI cells from BSAP –/– mice can differentiate in culture or in some cases, in vivo, to a variety of non-B cell types, including macrophages, granulocytes, osteoclasts, T cells, and natural killer cells (3.Nutt S.L. Heavey B. Rolink A.G. Busslinger M. Nature. 1999; 401: 556-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). This suggests a role for BSAP not only in promoting B cell development but also in eliminating other developmental possibilities. Some target genes for BSAP have been identified (reviewed in Ref. 4.Hagman J. Wheat W. Fitzsimmons D. Hodsdon W. Negri J. Dizon F. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2000; 245: 169-194PubMed Google Scholar), including CD19, LEF, N-myc, mb-1, and PD1,although these are unlikely to be critical for B cell development (5.Nutt S.L. Morrison A.M. Dorfler P. Rolink A. Busslinger M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2319-2333Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). BSAP is active later in B cell development, potentially through binding sites in murine heavy (6.Michaelson J.S. Singh M. Birshtein B.K. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 2349-2351PubMed Google Scholar) and light chain 3′ enhancers (7.Roque M.C. Smith P.A. Blasquez V.C. Mol. Cell.

A number of observations suggest that BSAP function can be modulated by its interaction with other proteins. For example, it has been shown that BSAP down-regulates the murine 3′ IgH enhancer hs1,2 in B cell lines in concert with other transcription factors that also bind to this enhancer (12.Singh M. Birshtein B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4392-4397Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These factors include octamer-binding proteins, κB-binding proteins, and a G-rich DNA-binding protein. Using a GST1 pulldown assay, we detected interaction of BSAP with the POU domains of Oct-1 and Oct-2 (12.Singh M. Birshtein B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4392-4397Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Other investigators have shown that the DNA-binding domain of BSAP interacts with and recruits Ets family proteins to ternary complexes with the mb-1 promoter in pre-B cells (13.Hagman J. Grosschedl R. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1994; 6: 222-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). BSAP has also been shown to interact with the acute myeloid leukemia protein, AML, in the regulation of the blk promoter (9.Libermann T.A. Pan Z. Akbarali Y. Hetherington C.J. Boltax J. Yergeau D.A. Zhang D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24671-24676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and with PU.1 (14.Maitra S. Atchison M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1911-1922Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We have therefore proposed to identify proteins that interact with BSAP using a yeast two-hybrid assay. BSAP is a member of the highly conserved Pax family of transcription factors (recently reviewed in Ref. 15.Mansouri A. Goudreau G. Gruss P. Cancer Res. 1999; 59 (suppl.): 1707s-1710sGoogle Scholar). Like all nine Pax family proteins, BSAP (Pax5) has a highly conserved N-terminal DNA-binding domain, termed the paired box (pax) domain (16.Czerny T. Schaffner G. Busslinger M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2048-2061Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The C-terminal region of Pax proteins contains a transcriptional activation domain, and the extreme C-terminal segment of Pax2, Pax5, and Pax8 functions as a repression domain (17.Dorfler P. Busslinger M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1971-1982Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Between the paired domain and the transactivation domain is a central domain, which contains a conserved octapeptide motif and varying segments of a homeodomain. The Pax5 subfamily, which includes Pax2, Pax5, and Pax8, contains a partial homeodomain. Although the role of the central domain has not been specifically demonstrated, transient transfection assays of BSAP deletion constructs have implicated the central domain in augmenting the transcriptional activity of BSAP (17.Dorfler P.

Recent data have reported that the partial homeodomain of BSAP interacts with the retinoblastoma protein Rb and the TATA-binding protein TBP (18.Eberhard D. Busslinger M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59 (suppl.): 1716s-1725sGoogle Scholar) Using the central domain of BSAP as a bait in the two-hybrid assay system, we report here a strong interaction with Rch1 (GenBankTM accession number U09559), a protein involved in nuclear import (19.Koepp D.M. Silver P.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1377: M39-M47PubMed Google Scholar). Rch1 is one of several homologous proteins (importin α proteins) that have been implicated in nuclear import of various proteins by interaction with a nuclear localization signal (NLS) (reviewed in Refs. 19.Koepp D.M. Silver P.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1377: M39-M47PubMed Google Scholar and 20.Nakielny S. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1999; 99: 677-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Human importin α proteins are generally ubiquitously expressed, albeit with some quantitative differences in different tissues (21.Kohler M. Speck C. Christiansen M. Bischoff F.R. Prehn S. Haller H. Gorlich D. Hartmann E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7782-7791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on amino acid similarities, human importins have been classified into seven subgroups. Rch1 (also called hSrp1α and karyopherin α2 (KPNA2)) is the single member of subgroup 1, i.e. importin α1, as specified in Refs. 21.Kohler M. Speck C. Christiansen M. Bischoff F.R. Prehn S. Haller H. Gorlich D. Hartmann E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7782-7791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 22.Welch K. Franke J. Kohler M. Macara I.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8400-8411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, and pendulin is the mouse homolog of human importin α1. NLS motifs bound by importins are composed of short stretches of highly basic amino acids, some of which are a single stretch of amino acids (i.e. monopartite), others of which comprise two short stretches separated by a spacer region (i.e. bipartite). A general outline of nuclear import has been elucidated. Importin α proteins deliver their cargo into the nucleus through interaction with importin β and movement through the nuclear pore. The importin α-β complex is proposed to dissociate in the nucleus upon binding of Ran GTP to importin β. Importin α then releases its NLS-binding protein and recycles into the cytoplasm through interaction with export proteins. The importin α proteins have a relatively conserved central core of 10 armadillo repeats, each containing ∼42 amino acids, flanked by more diverse N-terminal and C-terminal segments. The crystal structure of importin α proteins has implicated internal armadillo repeats in binding to NLS motifs (23.Conti E. Uy M. Leighton L. Blobel G. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 193-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar,24.Kobe B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 388-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Our observation of an interaction between BSAP and importin α1 has provided the basis for identification of an importin α1 binding site in BSAP, which functions as a nuclear localization signal. Paired domain and central domain segments of other Pax proteins,i.e. quail Pax6 (25.Carriere C. Plaza S. Caboche J. Dozier C. Bailly M. Martin P. Saule S. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1531-1540PubMed Google Scholar) and human Pax8 (26.Poleev A. Okladnova O. Musti A.M. Schneider S. Royer-Pokora B. Plachov D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 860-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), have also been implicated in nuclear localization. However, ours is the first identification of an interaction of a Pax protein with a specific protein involved in nuclear import. Interestingly, the region of importin α1 that binds to the BSAP NLS is a C-terminal segment characterized by acidic amino acids. Murine BSAP (Pax5) (GenBankTM accession number N97013) (Fig. 1) was generously provided by Stephen Desiderio, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD (27.Zwollo P. Desiderio S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15310-15317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The paired domain (aa 1–143), central domain (aa 144–267), and transcriptional activation domain (268–391) of BSAP were individually PCR cloned using EcoRI/SalI sites 3′ of the yeastLexA DNA-binding domain in the his+ plasmid vector pEG202 (originally obtained as a gift from Erica Golemis and now obtainable from CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). A cDNA library was prepared from Epstein-Barr virus-transformed human peripheral lymphocytes (B cells). This library was shifted via a phage lambda intermediate into the yeast plasmid vector, pACT1 (leu+), 3′ of the GAL-4 activation domain (28.Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.L. Yeh S.H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). The library (a gift of Steven Elledge, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX) was transformed into the ura+ yeast strain CTY 10−5d (MATa ade2 trp1–901 leu2–3, 112 his3–200 gal4− gal80−URA3::lexA-lacZ). Yeast cells were made competent using a lithium acetate method (29.Chien C.T. Bartel P.L. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9578-9582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar). Neither the N-terminal paired domain (DNA binding) nor the central domain of BSAP showed autonomous transcriptional activation, and hence both were candidates for detection of protein interactions in the two-hybrid transcriptional activation assay. For the screen reported here, the bait fragment (aa 144–267) is the serine/threonine-rich central domain region of Pax5, which includes a conserved octapeptide (aa 179–186) and partial homeodomain (aa 229–251) (30.Adams B. Dorfler P. Aguzzi A. Kozmik Z. Urbanek P. Maurer-Fogy I. Busslinger M. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1589-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). There are only three amino acids that differ between full-length mouse and human BSAP (GenBankTMaccession number M96944), none of which are located in the bait used here. The yeast two-hybrid screening procedure was performed essentially as described previously (28.Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.L. Yeh S.H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). The library of 1 × 106transformants was plated on SC dropout media lacking uracil, histidine, and leucine and screened using an X-gal filter assay (31.Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4880) Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was isolated from positive (blue) colonies by glass bead lysis, extraction with phenol/chloroform, and ethanol precipitation, and transformed into the E. coli strain HB101 (-leu) by electroporation, as described previously (32.Hoffman C.S. Winston F. Gene. 1987; 57: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (2057) Google Scholar). The transformants were grown on M9 (-leu) selective media for 2–3 days to select cDNA library plasmids. Five colonies were randomly chosen for each clone, plasmid minipreps (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) were performed, and the size of cDNA inserts was analyzed after BglII digestion or PCR amplification. Plasmids containing one of each size cDNA from each clone were reassayed by transformation into yeast-competent cells together with one of the following: 1) pEG202 containing the bait; 2) pEG202 without the bait; or 3) pEG202 containing an unrelated cDNA insert shown to interact in a two-hybrid assay with an independent protein. The plasmids that generated blue colonies in the X-Gal filter assay with only the Pax5 bait plasmid were considered for further analysis. In some cases, interaction was quantitated using a liquid assay for β-galactosidase (33.Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). Transformants were grown to mid-log phase (A 600 = 0.4–0.5), in SC dropout media, as used in the β-galactosidase plate assay. β-Galactosidase activity was assayed in chloroform-permeabilized cells usingo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactoside (Sigma) as a substrate. β-Galactosidase units = (1000 ×A 420)/(t × v ×A 600), where t = 24 h,v = 1.5 ml, A 600 = cell density just before assay, and A 420= absorbance ofo-nitrophenol product. Assays were carried out in duplicate and averaged. LexA-BSAP fusion constructs for use in the two-hybrid assay were prepared by cloning PCR fragments amplified from pBSK-BSAP (27.Zwollo P. Desiderio S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15310-15317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) into the EcoRI/SalI sites (underlined) of the pEG202 vector. All constructs were verified by sequencing. Listed below are primers used for amplification, beginning at the numbered amino acid. All sequences are in the 5′ to 3′ orientation and the direction, forward (F) or reverse (R), is indicated.

Importin α1 deletion mutants were prepared by PCR cloning and subsequent ligation into theEcoRI-XhoI cloning sites of the pACT2 vector (CLONTECH) and verified by sequencing. The following primers were used (all sequences are 5′-3′), and the nomenclature is the same as above: imp-1F, GTCGAATTCCATGTCCACCACCGAGAATC; imp-244R, TCGCTCGAGCAGGATTCTTGTTGCGGCA; imp-248F, CCCCGAATTCATGCTGTTGAGCAG; imp-337R, GGCTCCTCGAGCTGCATCAATCAG; imp-338F, GCAGGAATTCTCGCCGTCTTTCCCAGC; imp-431R, ACCACTCGAGTCTTGGTATCTTTTGC; imp-432F, CTCTGAATTCCAAAAGATACCAAG; imp-529R, TGACTCGAGTGTTAAAGGTCCCAGG. Full-length pendulin (mouse homologue of importin α1) in pGEX-3X vector (a gift from Marian Waterman, University of California, Irvine, CA) was used for overexpression of a GST-pendulin fusion protein in isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm)-induced E. coli strain BL21. The fusion protein was purified by elution from glutathione-Sepharose beads (34.Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene. 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). The protein concentration was measured by Bradford assay. Mouse cDNA constructs of full-length Pax2 (35.Phelps D.E. Dressler G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7978-7985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) Pax3 (16.Czerny T. Schaffner G. Busslinger M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2048-2061Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), Pax6 (16.Czerny T. Schaffner G. Busslinger M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2048-2061Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 36.Cvekl A. Kashanchi F. Brady J.N. Piatigorsky J. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1999; 40: 1343-1350PubMed Google Scholar), and Pax8 (16.Czerny T. Schaffner G. Busslinger M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2048-2061Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) proteins were gifts of Ales Cvekl, Albert Einstein College of Medicine (Bronx, NY), and Robert di Lauro (Naples, Italy). The cDNAs of Pax2 (originally in pS1) and ofPax8 (originally in CMV5) were each cloned into pSP72 (Promega, T7 promoter). The cDNAs of Pax3 and ofPax6 were each in pKW10 (SP6 promoter). Each of the Pax clones and full-length Pax5 in pBSK vector (T3 promoter) was translated and labeled with [35S]methionine by anin vitro transcription/translation system protocol (Promega, Madison, WI). Binding reactions were carried out as described previously (37.Luo Y. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4115-4124Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). PCR amplification of segments of BSAP in pBSK was carried out usingPfu polymerase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad CA). The constructs were cloned in frame into EcoRI/SalI sites of the pEGFP-C3 vector (CLONTECH). The primers used for amplification were as follows (all sequences 5′–3′) (nomenclature of primers is as above for LexA-BSAP fusion constructs): gfp-1F,GAATTCATGGATTTAGAGAAAAATTATCCG; gfp-16F, ATCGAATTCTTGGACATGGAGGAGTG; gfp-26F, TAATGAATTCATGTTTTTGTGAATGGACGGCCACTC; gfp-144F, ATCGAATTCAGCAGCCACCCAACCAA; gfp-179F,GAATTCAGGGTATTCAGGAGTCTCCGGTG; gfp-202F,GAATTCAGGGTATTCAGGAGTCTCCGGTG; gfp-255F, ATCGAATTCGAGCCCATCAAGCCCGAGCAGACC; gfp-133R, ATCGTCGACACTGACGCTAGGCACGGTGTC; gfp-143R, TAATGTCGACTGTACTTTTGTCCGGAT; gfp-194R, ACTGTCGACGGTGTCGGCGCTGGGGGACGT; gfp-201R, ATCGTCGACTTCGTCTCTCTTGCGCTTGTT; gfp-254R,GTCGACTCTGTGGTGGTGAAGAT; gfp-391R, TCAGTCGACTCAGTGACGGTCATAGGCAGT. Mutation of the NLS motif within full-length BSAP was performed essentially as described in the protocol to the Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis kit. Briefly, to mutate the NLS motif from NKRKRDE to NNRNRDE in the context of full-lengthBSAP, which was previously cloned into theEcoRI/SalI sites of a pEGFP vector (CLONTECH), we used a PCR procedure withPfu polymerase and the following primers (all sequences 5′–3′): GCCGACACCAACAACCGCAACAGGGATGAA and TTCATCCCTGTTGCGGTTGTTGGTGTCGGC. The resulting PCR mixture was treated with DpnI to digest methylated template DNA and used to transform E. coli. The frame and mutations in the newly synthesized pEGFP vector with cloned full-length BSAP were verified by sequencing. In some clones, the NLS motif had only one mutation: NNRKRDE. The central domain of BSAP, containing the singly mutated NLS motif, was PCR-cloned into PCR II using primers pEG-144F and pEG-268R.EcoRI/SalI cleavage released the central domain, which was then cloned into EcoRI/SalI-digested pEG202 vector for subsequent two-hybrid assays. 293T human kidney cells, used for the expression of the GFP fusion proteins, were grown on cover slides in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Mediatech, Cellgro, Herndon, VA), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. 0.5 μg of DNA was transfected into 5 × 105 cells, using the LipofectAMINE reagent and protocol from Life Technologies, Inc. After 12 h, the cells were fixed by 2% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and mounted in Fluoromount-G. The subcellular location of GFP fusion proteins was determined by fluorescence microscopy Axioskop (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). We used the yeast two-hybrid assay to identify proteins that interacted with the central domain of BSAP (Fig.1). One million colonies were screened using an X-gal filter assay (31.Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4880) Google Scholar). Positive (blue) colonies were candidates for specifying BSAP-interacting proteins. Plasmids containing one of each size library cDNA from each colony were isolated from E. coli and reassayed by transformation into yeast-competent cells together with one of the following: 1) pEG202 containing the bait; 2) pEG202 without the bait; or 3) pEG202 containing an unrelated cDNA insert shown to interact in a two-hybrid assay with an independent protein. The plasmids that generated blue colonies in the X-Gal filter assay with only thePax5 bait plasmid (as shown in Fig.2) were considered for further analysis. Nine different cDNA clones, each uniquely specifying one protein, passed the specificity tests and are currently under investigation. Interestingly, five different cDNAs were found to encode a single protein, i.e. human importin α1 (GenBankTMaccession number U09559). Four of these encoded full-length importin α1, differing only in the length of their 5′ untranslated regions (identified in one colony only for cDNAs beginning at –104, –74, and –62 with respect to the start site of translation and in four separate colonies for the cDNA beginning at –87). The fifth cDNA, which began at nucleotide 732 and encoded the C-terminal half of importin α1, aa 244–529, was identified three times. These data suggested that the central domain of BSAP bound to the C-terminal domain of the nuclear import protein, importin α1. To confirm physical interaction between importin α1 and BSAP, we carried out a GST pulldown assay, using full-length [35S]BSAP translated in vitro and GST fused to full-length pendulin. Mouse pendulin is 97% identical in amino acid sequence to human importin α1. In confirmation of the interaction between BSAP and importin α1 identified in the two-hybrid assay, we found (Fig.3) that BSAP bound to GST-pendulin but did not bind to control GST. The identification of importin α1 as a BSAP-interacting protein implied that interaction might be mediated by a nuclear localization signal in BSAP. We identified a single candidate NLS consensus signal, NKRKRDE, at aa 195–201 in the sequence of the BSAP bait. By assessing deletion mutants of the central domain of BSAP for interaction with importin α1 in the yeast two-hybrid assay, we confirmed that the importin α1 interaction region is localized at the putative NLS, located between aa 195 and aa 201 of BSAP (Fig. 4). Other segments of BSAP, which contained the paired domain (aa 1–143), octapeptide domain (aa 144–194), and partial homeobox domain (aa 202–267), did not bind to importin α1, suggesting that aa 195–201 is the only importin α1 binding site detected in this assay system. Previous studies have shown that mutagenesis of lysine residues within NLS motifs eliminated importin α recognition. We therefore carried out site-specific mutagenesis of the NLS motif within the central domain. Mutation of the NLS at two sites to NNRNRDE in a deletion mutant of the central domain of BSAP eliminated binding of importin αl, and mutation at a single site (to NNRKRDE) within the NLS of the complete central domain of BSAP also eliminated interaction between importin α1 and BSAP in the yeast two-hybrid assay. To assess the functional role of the NKRKRDE amino acid motif, we coupled various segments of the BSAP central domain to GFP (Fig. 5 A). Constructs expressing GFP-BSAP fusion proteins were transfected into 293T human kidney cells, which contain endogenous importin α1 (38.Kohler M. Ansieau S. Prehn S. Leutz A. Haller H. Hartmann E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 104-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), and intracellular localization was monitored by fluorescence microscopy. Only segments from the central domain that included the NKRKRDE motif were shown to localize predominantly to the nucleus, whereas GFP, by itself, was retained in the cytoplasm (Fig. 5 A). For example (Fig. 5 B), a fusion protein of GFP coupled to aa 144–194 failed to localize to the nucleus, whereas a fusion protein of GFP coupled to aa 144–201, containing an additional seven amino acids comprising the NKRKRDE motif, resulted in predominantly nuclear localization. A highly basic amino acid motif characteristic of an NLS is apparent only in the central domain of BSAP. Accordingly, a GFP-BSAP C-terminal activation domain (aa 255–391) fusion protein, which does not have such a basic motif, failed to enter the nucleus (Fig. 5 A). However, a GFP-BSAP paired domain (aa 16–143) fusion construct localized to the nucleus (Fig. 5 A), despite its apparent lack of an NLS motif and its failure to interact with importin α1, as assessed by the two-hybrid assay (Fig. 3). Deletion of either the N- or C-terminal 10 amino acids from the paired domain showed reduction in nuclear localization of the GFP fusion construct (Fig. 5 A). A similar observation for the paired domain of Pax8 was previously reported (26.Poleev A. Okladnova O. Musti A.M. Schneider S. Royer-Pokora B. Plachov D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 860-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Hence, both the paired domain and aa 195–201 in the central domain of BSAP confer nuclear localization. We therefore wanted to assess the relative importance of the NLS and the paired domain to nuclear localization of BSAP. A GFP-full-length BSAP fusion protein, in which the NLS motif had been specifically mutagenized, continued to localize predominantly to the nucleus of 293T cells (Fig. 5 A). Nuclear localization was also displayed by GFP fused to a truncation mutant of BSAP, which lacked only the paired domain. Together, these observations suggest that the BSAP molecule has two segments that individually determine nuclear localization. From identification of the various cDNAs encoding importin α1 in the yeast two-hybrid screen (Fig. 2), we predicted that the C-terminal half of importin α1 contained the binding site for BSAP. To further localize the BSAP binding site within importin α1, we generated several deletion mutants of importin α1 for use in the yeast two-hybrid assay. These experiments demonstrated that a C-terminal fragment of importin α1 extending from aa 432 to aa 529 was able to interact with the central domain of BSAP (Fig.6). BSAP is a member of a subfamily of highly homologous Pax genes that includes Pax2 andPax8. Fig. 7 shows that both full-length Pax2 and full-length Pax8 interact with full-length pendulin in a GST pulldown assay. Similarly, we found that other, less closely related Pax proteins, namely Pax3 and Pax6, also interactedin vitro with GST-pendulin. In a yeast two-hybrid screen, we detected interaction of BSAP with several clones encoding importin α1, an NLS-recognizing nuclear transporter. This was the predominant interaction detected in the two-hybrid assay with the central domain of BSAP as a bait. The physical interaction between BSAP and importin α1 was confirmed in GST pulldown assays. The importin α1-interacting NLS was localized within a central domain of BSAP and shown to be functional by conferring nuclear localization to GFP-BSAP fusion proteins. This is the first identification of an interaction of a Pax protein with a specific protein involved in nuclear import. Our experiments show that the paired domain of BSAP can also localize to the nucleus. Because we did not detect binding of the paired domain to importin α1 in the yeast two-hybrid assay, the mechanism by which the paired domain enters the nucleus (whether directly, by interaction with one of the several importin α proteins, or indirectly, via proteins that bind to the paired domain) is not yet known. The paired and central domains of BSAP are redundant in nuclear targeting of BSAP, as site-specific mutagenesis of the NLS in the central domain does not prevent nuclear localization of the full-length BSAP, and a BSAP molecule lacking the paired domain also targets to the nucleus. Paired domain and central domain segments of quail Pax6 (25.Carriere C. Plaza S. Caboche J. Dozier C. Bailly M. Martin P. Saule S. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1531-1540PubMed Google Scholar) and human Pax8 (26.Poleev A. Okladnova O. Musti A.M. Schneider S. Royer-Pokora B. Plachov D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 860-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) have also been implicated in nuclear localization. Intriguingly, an isoform of Caenorhabditis elegans Pax6, which lacks only the paired domain, is regulated in its nuclear entry during development of neuronal cell lineages of the male tail (39.Zhang Y. Henrique F.B. Greenstein D. Chisholm A. Emmons S.A. Mech. Dev. 1998; 78: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Although we have observed that Pax2, Pax8, Pax3, and Pax6 also interact with importin α1 in GST pulldown assays, we have not localized an importin α1 binding site for any Pax protein other than BSAP. It should be noted, however, that both BSAP and importin α1 are highly conserved proteins. Sequence similarities in Pax2, Pax5, and Pax8 raise the possibility that this subfamily shares an importin α1 binding site in the central domain. Based on the general expression of importin α proteins (38.Kohler M. Ansieau S. Prehn S. Leutz A. Haller H. Hartmann E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 104-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), it is likely that in addition to importin α1, other importin α cDNAs are present in the library from human Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cells that we screened by the yeast two-hybrid assay. Nonetheless, we detected interaction of BSAP in this assay only with importin α1. Other two-hybrid screens also revealed dominant, if not exclusive, importin α1 interactions with RAG1 (40.Cuomo C.A. Kirch S.A. Gyuris J. Brent R. Oettinger M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6156-6160Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), coilin (41.Weis K. Mattaj I.W. Lamond A.I. Science. 1995; 268: 1049-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), LEF (42.Prieve M.G. Guttridge K.L. Munguia J.E. Waterman M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7654-7658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), BRCA1 (43.Chen C.F. Li S. Chen Y. Chen P.L. Sharp Z.D. Lee W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32863-32868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), and EBNA1 (44.Kim A.L. Maher M. Hayman J.B. Ozer J. Zerby D. Yates J.L. Lieberman P.M. Virology. 1997; 239: 340-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). (Both RAG1 and LEF were also found to bind to a second importin α, α5 (SRP1).) Interestingly, c-Myc, which has a functional NLS, was reported to be unable to bind to importin α1 (Rch1) in a yeast two-hybrid assay (40.Cuomo C.A. Kirch S.A. Gyuris J. Brent R. Oettinger M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6156-6160Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), and Stat1 failed to bind to Rch1 in a GST pulldown assay (45.Sekimoto T. Imamoto N. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Yoneda Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7067-7077Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). In vitro, many individual importin α proteins can interact with the same NLS (21.Kohler M. Speck C. Christiansen M. Bischoff F.R. Prehn S. Haller H. Gorlich D. Hartmann E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7782-7791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but when assayed as a mixture of NLS motifs, particular NLS motifs bind preferentially to individual importin α proteins (21.Kohler M. Speck C. Christiansen M. Bischoff F.R. Prehn S. Haller H. Gorlich D. Hartmann E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7782-7791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These data indicate an apparent selectivity in importin α1 binding to some proteins and raise the possibility that interactions of particular proteins, such as BSAP, with importin α1 might have some specific physiological consequence, either related to or distinct from nuclear import. The crystal structure of yeast importin α bound to the SV40 NLS shows that NLS binding is conferred by two sites, one formed by armadillo repeats 2, 3, and 4 and the second by armadillo repeats 7 and 8 (23.Conti E. Uy M. Leighton L. Blobel G. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 193-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of mouse importin α1 (pendulin) was similarly interpreted (24.Kobe B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 388-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Accordingly, internal armadillo repeats of importin α1 (mouse pendulin) and of importin α5 (hSRP1) have been shown to be essential for the binding of LEF (46.Prieve M.G. Guttridge K.L. Munguia J. Waterman M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4819-4832Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the N-terminal region of RAG1 (47.Cortes P. Ye Z.S. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7633-7767Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), respectively. In contrast, we have found using the yeast two-hybrid assay that the C-terminal 98-amino acid fragment of importin α1, aa 432–529 (containing the last one and a half armadillo repeats, coupled to the C-terminal (non-armadillo) segment of 33 amino acids) binds to BSAP. Previous observations have also reported binding of NLS motifs to the C-terminal segment of importin α. RAG1 (aa 330–1040) was reported to bind to the C-terminal half (aa 244–529) of importin α1 (Rch1) (40.Cuomo C.A. Kirch S.A. Gyuris J. Brent R. Oettinger M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6156-6160Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). (In unpublished data described in Ref. 48.Spanopoulou E. Cortes P. Shih C. Huang C.M. Silver D.P. Svec P. Baltimore D. Immunity. 1995; 3: 715-726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, the importin α binding site of RAG1 was limited to the same 98-amino acid fragment of importin α1 that we identified (432–529).) Amino acids 456–538 of importin α5 (hSRP1) were reported to bind to the SV40 NLS coupled to human serum albumin (49.Moroianu J. Blobel G. Radu A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6572-6576Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and aa 475–538 of another member of the importin 5 family, NPI-1, bound to the nonclassical NLS motif of Stat1 (45.Sekimoto T. Imamoto N. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Yoneda Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7067-7077Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of importin α indicates that the C-terminal segment is available for protein interactions (23.Conti E. Uy M. Leighton L. Blobel G. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 193-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 24.Kobe B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 388-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). In fact, the export protein, CAS, has been shown to interact with this region (50.Herold A. Truant R. Wiegand H. Cullen B.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 309-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). These observations raise the possibility, as previously suggested for importin α5 (45.Sekimoto T. Imamoto N. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Yoneda Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7067-7077Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), that importin α1 might engage more than one protein at the same time, potentially serving as a scaffold for assembly of protein complexes. Recent data have shown that components thought to be associated exclusively with nuclear import may play other important roles in cell physiology. For example, importin α-importin β complexes bind to RanGTP, which has now been shown to be associated with mitotic spindle formation (51.Ohba T. Nakamura M. Nishitani H. Nishimoto T. Science. 1999; 284: 1356-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 52.Wilde A. Zheng Y. Science. 1999; 284: 1359-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), and nuclear pore proteins, through which nuclear import occurs, have been implicated in chromatin structure (53.Galy V. Olivo-Marin J.-C. Scherthan H. Doye V. Rascalou N. Nehrbass U. Nature. 2000; 403: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). These data suggest the possibility that the interaction of BSAP with importin α1 may not be exclusively associated with nuclear import.

https://openalex.org/W2009646137,"Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) is an essential enzyme in all organisms. It provides precursors for DNA synthesis by reducing all four ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides. The overall activity and the substrate specificity of RNR are allosterically regulated by deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates and ATP, thereby providing balanced dNTP pools. We have characterized the allosteric regulation of the class III RNR from bacteriophage T4. Our results show that the T4 enzyme has a single type of allosteric site to which dGTP, dTTP, dATP, and ATP bind competitively. The dissociation constants are in the micromolar range, except for ATP, which has a dissociation constant in the millimolar range. ATP and dATP are positive effectors for CTP reduction, dGTP is a positive effector for ATP reduction, and dTTP is a positive effector for GTP reduction. dATP is not a general negative allosteric effector. These effects are similar to the allosteric regulation of class Ib and class II RNRs, and to the class Ia RNR of bacteriophage T4, but differ from that of the class III RNRs from the host bacterium Escherichia coli and fromLactococcus lactis.The relative rate of reduction of the four substrates was measured simultaneously in a mixed-substrate assay, which mimics the physiological situation and illustrates the interplay between the different effectors in vivo. Surprisingly, we did not observe any significant UTP reduction under the conditions used.

Balancing of the pyrimidine deoxyribonucleotide pools may be achieved via the dCMP deaminase and dCMP hydroxymethylase pathways. ribonucleotide reductase hydroxymethyl Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR)1 catalyzes the reduction of all four ribonucleotides to their corresponding deoxyribonucleotides in all organisms. This is the only de novo way for the cell to make use of the deoxyribonucleotides as building blocks in DNA synthesis (1.Jordan A. Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 71-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Three classes of RNRs are known that differ in quaternary structure and cofactor requirement. Despite these differences, they all catalyze the reduction of ribonucleotides by a related radical-based mechanism (2.Sjöberg B.-M. Struct. Bonding. 1997; 88: 139-173Crossref Google Scholar). All RNRs, except those of herpesviruses (3.Averett D.R. Lubbers C. Elion G.B. Spector T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9831-9838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Averett D.R. Furman P.A. Spector T. J. Virol. 1984; 52: 981-983Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), are allosterically regulated by deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates and ATP, such that DNA precursors are supplied in pools balanced according to the base composition of the different genomes (5.Hendricks S.P.

The allosteric regulation of Escherichia coli class Ia RNR has been meticulously characterized by enzyme activity measurements, nucleotide binding, photoaffinity labeling, affinity chromatography, site-directed mutagenesis, and structure determinations (7.Larsson A.

Structure. 1997; 5: 1077-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The net result of these findings is that ATP and dATP are positive effectors for reduction of pyrimidine ribonucleotides, whereas dTTP stimulates reduction of guanine ribonucleotides, and dGTP stimulates reduction of adenine ribonucleotides. Apart from this allosteric regulation, which is controlled at the so-called specificity site, class Ia RNRs contain another allosteric site denoted the overall activity site, which binds only ATP or dATP. ATP acts (directly or indirectly) as a positive effector, whereas dATP, which has a lower affinity for the overall activity site than for the specificity site, acts here as a general negative allosteric effector. The nucleotide binding component of class Ia RNRs is a homodimeric protein with four, pairwise identical, allosteric sites. The three-dimensional structure of E. coliclass Ia RNR identifies two identical specificity sites located at the polypeptide interface, and two identical overall activity sites located at the N-terminal domain of each polypeptide (14.Eriksson M. Uhlin U. Ramaswamy S. Ekberg M. Regnström K. Sjöberg B.-M. Eklund H. Structure. 1997; 5: 1077-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Several RNRs conform to the allosteric substrate specificity regulation of the class Ia enzymes, whereas hitherto characterized class Ib and class II RNRs lack the overall activity control. The class Ia enzymes from bacteriophage T4 and the parasite Trypanosoma bruceialso lack a general negative overall activity control (15.Berglund O. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 7276-7281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Hofer A. Ekanem J.T. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34098-34104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The class III enzyme from E. coli seems most divergent, and has one allosteric site that controls reduction of pyrimidine ribonucleotides and another site that controls reduction of purine ribonucleotides (17.Eliasson R. Pontis E. Sun X. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26052-26057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the allosteric regulation of the class III RNR from Lactococcus lactis was investigated and found to be similar but not identical to that of class III RNR from E. coli (18.Torrents E. Buist G. Liu A. Eliasson R. Kok J. Gibert I. Gräslund A. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2463-2471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of the bacteriophage T4-induced class III RNR was recently solved to high resolution (19.Logan D.T. Andersson J. Sjöberg B.-M. Nordlund P. Science. 1999; 283: 1499-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the structures of the T4 class III RNR and the class Ia RNR of the E. coli host have very similar folds and active site regions, whereas the quaternary interactions within the dimers are different (19.Logan D.T. Andersson J. Sjöberg B.-M. Nordlund P. Science. 1999; 283: 1499-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 20.Uhlin U. Eklund H. Nature. 1994; 370: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Because one type of allosteric site is located at the dimer interface and the binding of dATP to these sites is different in the two proteins (14.Eriksson M. Uhlin U. Ramaswamy S. Ekberg M. Regnström K. Sjöberg B.-M. Eklund H. Structure. 1997; 5: 1077-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 19.Logan D.T. Andersson J. Sjöberg B.-M. Nordlund P. Science. 1999; 283: 1499-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), we were anxious to find out whether the apparent differences in mode of allosteric regulation between the well-characterized class Ia RNR and the class III enzymes were related to these structural differences. In this study we have characterized the allosteric regulation of T4 class III RNR, currently the only class III enzyme with a known three-dimensional structure. In comparison to the amino acid sequence of other class III enzymes, and to the known three-dimensional structure of the class Ia enzyme, T4 class III RNR lacks the N-terminal domain. We show that the T4 class III enzyme has only one type of allosteric site, to which the deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates and ATP can bind. Its allosteric regulation differs from those of the E. coli and L. lactis class III enzymes and is similar to the general RNR regulation, in particular that of the class Ib and II enzymes and the class Ia RNR of T4. 3H-Labeled nucleotides were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech or NEN Life Science products. They were supplied in ethanol that was removed in a SpeedVac, and the remaining nucleotide was dissolved in 25 mm unlabeled nucleotide. All unlabeled nucleotides were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The filters used for the ultrafiltration assay were Ultrafree-MC filter units with polysulfone PTTK membranes from Millipore with a molecular cut-off value of 30,000. NrdD, 2The nomenclature of the nucleotide binding components of RNRs is: class Ia, protein R1; class Ib, protein R1E; class III, NrdD. The activating component of the class III RNR is called NrdG. or the complex NrdD(G580A)·NrdG lacking the site of the glycyl radical (21.Young P. Andersson J. Sahlin M. Sjöberg B.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20770-20775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), was overexpressed and purified essentially as described previously (22.Andersson, J., Westman, M., Sahlin, M., and Sjöberg, B.-M. (2000) J. Biol. Chem., in pressGoogle Scholar, 23.Olcott M.C. Andersson J. Sjöberg B.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24853-24860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) with one additional purification step. The last step used an anionic exchange mono-Q column from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, which was eluted with a gradient of NaCl and gave a sufficiently pure protein for the ultrafiltration assay. The ultrafiltration method for determination of nucleotide dissociation constants has been described previously (12.Ormö M. Sjöberg B.-M. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 189: 138-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Initial experiments were performed in parallel with isolated NrdD wild type and with the complex NrdD(G580A)·NrdG. All binding experiments were performed aerobically, because the binding of allosteric nucleotides are not expected to involve the oxygen-sensitive glycyl radical. Similar conditions were used earlier for determining the nucleotide dissociation constants of E. coli NrdD (17.Eliasson R. Pontis E. Sun X. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26052-26057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A mixture of 7–30 μm protein, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mmdithiothreitol, and 1–100 μm3H-labeled nucleotide in a final volume of 150 μl was incubated at room temperature for 5 min. An aliquot of 30 μl was withdrawn, and the rest was applied on a Millipore filter and centrifuged for 90 s at 6000 rpm. Another aliquot of 30 μl was withdrawn from the flow-through fraction, and the radioactivity of the two aliquots was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Typically, a series of six different nucleotide concentrations were tested in each binding experiment. Binding data were evaluated either with reverse Scatchard plots (12.Ormö M. Sjöberg B.-M. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 189: 138-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), or by plotting [bound nucleotide]/[protein]versus [free nucleotide]. Linear regression or curve fitting to saturation curves, respectively, using Kaleidagraph software from Synergen, were used to calculate the dissociation constant (KD) and the number of binding sites (n). Except when indicated, tabulated values are the mean of two to five independent binding experiments. The ultrafiltration assay was used also for competition studies. One 3H-labeled nucleotide (dATP, dGTP, or dTTP) was used at its known KD concentration, and another unlabeled nucleotide was added at increasing concentration. The amount of bound 3H-labeled nucleotide was monitored with liquid scintillation counting. In the competition experiments with unlabeled ATP or dCTP (≤8 mm) the amount of Mg2+ used to compensate for the nucleotide quenching of magnesium ions was 20 mm. Ultrafiltration assays with3H-labeled dATP, dTTP, and dGTP were performed as described earlier, and in the presence of two fixed concentrations of ATP (0.5–2 mm). This gave apparent KD values for dATP, dGTP, and dTTP at the different ATP concentrations. TheK D, app values were plotted versusthe ATP concentration according to the equation KD, app(dNTP) = K D(dNTP) (1 + [ATP]free/K D(ATP)), and extrapolation of the linear fits gave the KD for ATP. The standard enzyme activity assay described in Ref. 22.Andersson, J., Westman, M., Sahlin, M., and Sjöberg, B.-M. (2000) J. Biol. Chem., in pressGoogle Scholar was used with minor modifications. The final concentration of [3H]CTP was 1.5 mm, and the final concentration of allosteric effector was 1 mm. We used the mixed-substrate assay developed by Hendricks et al. (5.Hendricks S.P. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2861-2865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), with the modifications introduced by Hofer et al. (16.Hofer A. Ekanem J.T. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34098-34104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and used tritium-labeled substrates for higher sensitivity. Anaerobic activity assays were as described above, but with simultaneous inclusion of [3H]CTP, [3H]ATP, [3H]GTP, and [3H]UTP in final concentrations of 1.5 mm. One unlabeled effector nucleotide (dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP, or dUTP) was also added to a final concentration of 0.2 mm. Assays were stopped after different incubation times by addition of 500 μl of 1 m trichloroacetic acid. The samples were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 1 min at 4 °C to precipitate the proteins as pellets. The supernatants were transferred to new tubes, and the nucleotides were extracted with a freon-trioctyl mixture (1,1,2-trichlorotrifluoroethane and trioctylamine in a ratio of 3:1). The extraction was repeated (once or twice) until the pH was >5. Further pH adjustment was made by adding 1 mNH4HCO3, pH 8.9 (final concentration, 50 mm), and 1 m MgCl2 (final concentration, 15 mm). The sample was then loaded onto a boronate affinity chromatography column (Affi-Gel-601 from Bio-Rad) that separates ribonucleotides from deoxyribonucleotides. The buffer was 50 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8.9, 15 mm MgCl2 and the 2-ml flow-through fraction containing the deoxyribonucleotides was collected. A pH adjustment to a value between 2.5 and 3.5 was made with approximately 20 μl of 6m HCl, and the sample was vortexed for 15 s to eliminate CO2. A 1-ml aliquot was loaded immediately onto the high pressure liquid chromatography column (reversed phase C18 column, 4.6 × 125 mm Partisphere SAX-5 from Whatman) and eluted isocratically with phosphate buffer, pH 3.4. Identification of the nucleotide peaks was made by comparing the UV absorption profile with a standard curve, and quantification of the deoxyribonucleotide products was obtained by on-line liquid scintillation counting. Because only the substrates were tritiated and not the effectors, it was easy to distinguish between the added effector deoxyribonucleotides and the formed deoxyribonucleotide products. The ultrafiltration assay by Ormö et al. (12.Ormö M. Sjöberg B.-M. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 189: 138-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) was used for determining theKD value and number of binding sites for dATP, dTTP, and dGTP; a typical binding curve is shown in Fig.1. Initially, nucleotide binding of NrdD wild type was compared with that of the NrdD(G580A)·NrdG complex. Previous studies suggest that the nucleotides bind only to the NrdD subunit (19.Logan D.T. Andersson J. Sjöberg B.-M. Nordlund P. Science. 1999; 283: 1499-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 23.Olcott M.C. Andersson J. Sjöberg B.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24853-24860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The binding constants for NrdD wild type compared with those for the complex NrdD(G580A)·NrdG were similar for dATP, dGTP, and dTTP, respectively (Table I). The number of binding sites for dATP was higher for the complex than for the isolated NrdD, but not for dGTP or dTTP (Table I). The NrdG protein has a binding site for S-adenosylmethionine (24.Ollagnier S. Mulliez E. Schmidt P.P. Eliasson R. Gaillard J. Deronzier C. Bergman T. Gräslund A. Reichard P. Fontecave M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24216-24223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), and it is plausible that dATP may bind also to this site. The averageKD values for binding of dATP, dGTP, and dTTP to the isolated NrdD are summarized in Table I. The dissociation constants were all in the micromolar range, with the lowestKD value found for dGTP, followed by dTTP, and finally dATP. The number of binding sites for these nucleotides were close to two sites per NrdD dimer (Table I).Table ISummary of the ultrafiltration assay resultsEffectorNrdD wild typeNrdD(G580A) · NrdG wild typeK Dn aNumber of binding sites per NrdD dimer.K Dn aNumber of binding sites per NrdD dimer.μmμmdATP14 ± 1.02.2 ± 0.2219 ± 1.84.5 ± 0.26dGTP1.3 ± 0.031.5 ± 0.190.7 ± 0.291.8 ± 0.33dTTP7.5 ± 0.251.5 ± 0.0313 ± 4.51.6 ± 0.27ATPbThe K D for ATP was obtained indirectly (cf.

The dissociation constant for ATP was far beyond the detection limit of the ultrafiltration assay (approximately 0.1–0.2 mm) 3A. Slaby and B.-M. Sjöberg, unpublished observations. and had to be determined indirectly (see below). In addition, binding of dCTP and the substrate ribonucleotides, in the absence and presence of the putative prime positive effector, was far beyond our detection limits. We used competition experiments to test whether dATP, dGTP, and dTTP bound to the same site in NrdD. One nucleotide, dATP, dGTP, or dTTP, was tritiated and used at a fixed concentration, and another unlabeled nucleotide was included at increasing concentrations, starting at the KD value. The results in Fig.2, A–C, clearly show that dATP, dGTP, and dTTP all bind to the same site in NrdD, because they can displace each other in all different combinations. The results fit very well with the individual KD values,e.g. dGTP having the strongest binding constant is also the nucleotide most difficult to displace (Fig. 2 B). We also tested ATP and dCTP as competitors to dATP, dGTP, and dTTP. As shown in Fig. 3, ATP and dCTP were able to compete with dATP but required much higher concentrations than the other nucleotides (Fig. 2, A–C). Similar results were seen in competition experiments with ATP or dCTP versus dGTP or dTTP (data not shown).Figure 3Competition experiments with ATP and dCTP. Binding of tritiated dATP (8 μm) to NrdD is monitored in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled dCTP (■) or unlabeled ATP (○). The amount of bound dATP in the absence of competitor is normalized to 1, and the binding of dATP in the presence of the competing nucleotides is then related to this value.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The competition experiments showed that ATP (and dCTP) was a competitor for the same site as dATP, dGTP, and dTTP. To determine the KD for ATP, we used the ultrafiltration assay and measured the apparent dissociation constants for dATP, dGTP, or dTTP in the presence of several different concentrations of unlabeled ATP. The apparent KD values were then plotted versus the concentration of ATP (Fig. 4), and from this curve it was possible to extrapolate a KD for ATP of approximately 1.2 mm (Table I). Our standard enzymatic activity assay uses CTP as a substrate. From this assay, it was clear that both ATP and dATP are positive effectors for CTP reduction (TableII). Also seen is that the enzyme has an intrinsic ability to reduce CTP in the absence of a positive allosteric effector. Addition of ATP increased the specific activity of CTP reduction 1.6 times, and addition of dATP doubled the specific activity. Addition of dTTP or dGTP resulted in a drastic decrease of the CTP reduction to 5–10% of the basal, nonregulated CTP reduction (data not shown).Table IICTP activity assayEffectorSpecific activitynmole/min · mgNone370ATP575dATP730 Open table in a new tab To identify prime allosteric effectors for the other substrates, we used the mixed-substrate assay with equal concentrations (1.5 mm) of all nucleoside triphosphates, as described previously (16.Hofer A. Ekanem J.T. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34098-34104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This assay gives a more “in vivo”-like situation in that reduction of all four substrates is monitored simultaneously. The conditions were the same as for the CTP activity assay, except that the effector concentrations were lower (0.2 mm) for technical reasons. Initial experiments were designed to measure substrate reduction in the absence of effector nucleotides. In one set of experiments we included all four substrates; ATP may act both as substrate and as allosteric effector in this case. In another set of experiments we excluded ATP from the substrate mix. When only CTP, GTP, and UTP were included, only CTP was reduced (Table III). This is equivalent to the nonregulated reduction of CTP observed in the CTP activity assay (Table II). When all four substrates were included, the reduction of CTP was approximately twice as high (Table III). A corresponding increase was seen when ATP acted as a positive effector in the CTP activity assay (Table II). Likewise, CTP reduction was increased twice when dATP was used as allosteric effector in the mixed-substrate assay, but no measurable reduction of ATP, GTP, or UTP occurred (Table III).Table IIIResults of the four-substrate assayEffectoraEffector concentrations were 0.2 mm.nmole dNTP madebAssays containing 1 μg (approximately 7 pmol) NrdD were incubated for 5 min at 25 °C.ATPcAn ATP concentration of 1.5 mm was used in all assays; ATP can work both as a substrate and as an allosteric effector in these assays.CTPGTPUTPNo effectordna, not applicable; no ATP was included in this assay.nadna, not applicable; no ATP was included in this assay.0.97ndend, not detectable.ndATPcAn ATP concentration of 1.5 mm was used in all assays; ATP can work both as a substrate and as an allosteric effector in these assays.nd1.97ndnddATPnd1.92ndnddGTP1.450.32ndnddTTP0.270.120.72nddUTP0.460.420.46nddCTP0.421.32ndndBold figures denote prime effector/substrate combinations.a Effector concentrations were 0.2 mm.b Assays containing 1 μg (approximately 7 pmol) NrdD were incubated for 5 min at 25 °C.c An ATP concentration of 1.5 mm was used in all assays; ATP can work both as a substrate and as an allosteric effector in these assays.d na, not applicable; no ATP was included in this assay.e nd, not detectable. Open table in a new tab Bold figures denote prime effector/substrate combinations. When dGTP and dTTP were added as allosteric effectors, the reduction pattern becomes quite complex. As shown in Table III, dGTP is clearly the prime effector for ATP reduction, and dTTP is the prime effector for GTP reduction. However, other substrates are reduced as well but to a lower extent. One interpretation of the results is that dGTP and dTTP are general positive effectors for all substrates, but as can be seen in Table III, this is not the case. No GTP is reduced in the presence of dGTP, and very little CTP is reduced in the presence of dTTP. Instead, we favor the explanation that the in vivo-like conditions permit the deoxyribonucleotide products to act as positive effectors directly when they have been formed. Assays incubated for up to 20 min support this conclusion, as will be shown below. We also tested dUTP as an allosteric effector, although this nucleotide has never been observed to act as an allosteric effector for other RNRs. The results were very similar to those for dTTP, showing that the similarity of the two nucleotides transmits to their allosteric effects on T4 NrdD. When dCTP was added as allosteric effector, both CTP and ATP were reduced (Table III). The positive effect of dCTP on ATP reduction competed with ATP to act as a positive effector for CTP reduction. Surprisingly, we did not detect any significant UTP reduction. There is a very low level of UTP reduction at longer incubation times (0.13–0.26 nmol formed after 20 min) but not to an extent comparable to the other substrates. UTP reduction is often co-regulated with CTP reduction in other RNRs (7.Larsson A. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 2533-2539Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Berglund O. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 7276-7281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Eliasson R. Pontis E. Sun X. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26052-26057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore omitted CTP from the substrate mixture, both with and without ATP or dATP as allosteric effector, but neither in the absence of nor in the presence of other effector/substrate combinations did we detect any UTP reduction (data not shown). Further support for our interpretations of the four-substrate assays were obtained in time curve experiments with dGTP, dTTP, or dCTP as effector nucleotide. Fig.5 A shows that use of dGTP as effector initially promoted ATP reduction, whereas the resulting increase of dATP later promoted CTP reduction. After 15 min of incubation CTP reduction dominated over ATP reduction (Fig.5 A). Addition of dTTP resulted initially in GTP reduction (Fig. 5 B). After 5 min of incubation, enough dGTP, which has the lowest KD value of all allosteric effectors, had been formed to promote ATP reduction, and from 10 min onward dATP-promoted CTP reduction dominated (Fig. 5 B). With dCTP as effector nucleotide, the reduction of CTP was rapid and efficient (Fig. 5 C). As discussed earlier, this could represent the nonregulated CTP reduction. Formation of dATP was much slower, and even lower but significant amounts of dGTP were produced. The low reduction of ATP and GTP can probably not be ascribed to dCTP as allosteric effector, because the same pattern was seen when CTP was excluded from the substrate mix (data not shown). Fig. 5 D shows the total amount of deoxyribonucleotides produced in each experiment. More NTPs were reduced with dCTP as effector than with dGTP or dTTP. We have characterized the allosteric regulation of the class III RNR from phage T4, and a summary of the results is shown in Fig.6. The T4 class III NrdD dimer contains two equivalent allosteric nucleotide-binding sites. dATP, and high concentrations of ATP, are positive effectors for CTP reduction, dGTP (and to some extent dCTP) is a positive effector for ATP reduction, and dTTP (and dUTP) is a positive effector for GTP reduction. There is no general negative allosteric effector, and there is a substantial nonregulated reduction of CTP in the absence of allosteric effectors. The KD values for binding of dGTP, dTTP, and dATP to T4 NrdD are in the micromolar range. This is high compared with the corresponding binding constants for class Ia RNR from bacteriophage T4 (25.Berglund O. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 7450-7455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and class Ia and III RNRs from the E. coli host bacterium (12.Ormö M. Sjöberg B.-M. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 189: 138-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 17.Eliasson R. Pontis E. Sun X. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26052-26057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The four-substrate assay (5.Hendricks S.P. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2861-2865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 16.Hofer A. Ekanem J.T. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34098-34104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) was instrumental in demonstrating that the deoxyribonucleotide products start to compete as allosteric effectors as soon as they have formed. In this sense the four-substrate assay mimics an in vivo-like situation, and as demonstrated in this study time curves of the mixed-substrate assay are a facile way of deducing the allosteric regulatory scheme of an RNR. The results also demonstrate that the individual deoxyribonucleotide formation rates fit very well with the KD values for the different effectors, where, e.g. dGTP, which has a much lower KD is less efficiently formed than the other deoxyribonucleotides. The dGTP pool in uninfected E. coli is considerably lower than the other dNTP pools. Upon T4 infection, it is increased relative to the other pools, but is still the least abundant one (26.Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 7430-7438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Even though the dNTP pools in general are lower during anaerobiosis than aerobiosis, in T4-infected as well as uninfected E. coli (26.Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 7430-7438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Lu Q. Zhang X. Almaula N. Mathews C.K. Inouye M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 337-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 28.Zhang X.L. Lu Q. Inouye M. Mathews C.K. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4115-4121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the KD values obtained by us (Table I) are clearly sufficient considering thein vivo concentration of each putative effector nucleotide. From competition experiments we could conclude that ATP bound weakly (K D≈ 1.2 mm) to the allosteric sites in T4 NrdD. Even though its dissociation constant is orders of magnitude higher than those of the dNTPs, it may still be physiologically relevant, because the in vivo concentration of ATP is close to 3 mm (26.Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 7430-7438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Neuhard J. Nygaard P. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. 1. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1987: 445-473Google Scholar). The effect observed by high concentrations of dCTP, however, may not be physiologically relevant, because T4 genomic DNA contains hydroxymethylcytosine instead of cytosine. Consequently, T4-infected E. coli contains a pool of hydroxymethyl (hm)-dCTP instead of dCTP (30.Greenberg R.G. He P. Hilfinger J. Tseng M.J. Karam J.D. Molecular Biology of Bacteriophage T4. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1994: 14-27Google Scholar). Any formed dCTP is efficiently dephosphorylated by the T4-specific enzyme dCTPase/dUTPase to dCMP, which in turn is the substrate for the T4-specific dCMP hydroxymethylase (30.Greenberg R.G. He P. Hilfinger J. Tseng M.J. Karam J.D. Molecular Biology of Bacteriophage T4. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1994: 14-27Google Scholar). In the four-substrate assay we also observed that dUTP had the same allosteric effects as dTTP (TableIII). Again, this is plausibly not physiologically significant, because both the host cell-encoded enzyme dUTPase and the T4-encoded dCTPase/dUTPase will convert any dUTP to dUMP, to enable subsequent dTTP formation via the thymidylate synthase/kinase pathway (29.Neuhard J. Nygaard P. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. 1. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1987: 445-473Google Scholar, 30.Greenberg R.G. He P. Hilfinger J. Tseng M.J. Karam J.D. Molecular Biology of Bacteriophage T4. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1994: 14-27Google Scholar). Most unexpectedly, we were unable to detect any significant UTP reduction in the four-substrate assays, even when the related substrate CTP was omitted from the mixtures. In the aerobic T4 class Ia ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase, the corresponding substrate UDP has a higher K m than the other NDP substrates, and more than two thirds of the dTTP pool is derived from CDP reduction via the dCMP deaminase and thymidylate synthase pathways (31.Chiu C.S. Ruettinger T. Flanegan J.B. Greenberg G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 8603-8608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Mathews C.K. Sinha N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 302-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The enzyme dCMP deaminase is allosterically regulated, positively by dCTP and hm-dCTP, and negatively by dTTP (30.Greenberg R.G. He P. Hilfinger J. Tseng M.J. Karam J.D. Molecular Biology of Bacteriophage T4. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1994: 14-27Google Scholar, 33.Maley F. Maley G.F. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1990; 39: 49-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Likewise, the allosterically regulated enzyme dCMP hydroxymethylase is feedback-regulated by hm-dCMP (30.Greenberg R.G. He P. Hilfinger J. Tseng M.J. Karam J.D. Molecular Biology of Bacteriophage T4. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1994: 14-27Google Scholar, 33.Maley F. Maley G.F. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1990; 39: 49-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It would thus be possible for T4 to balance the relative concentrations of dTTP and hm-dCTP via these allosterically regulated pathways, even in the absence of UTP reduction (cf. Fig. 6). The very efficient CTP reduction, compared with the reduction of GTP and ATP (Fig. 5 B), speaks in favor of this suggestion. At this point we can not, however, exclude that the four-substrate assay lacks a suitable positive allosteric effector for UTP reduction, because, e.g. the allosteric effects of hm-dCTP have not been tested. However, the aerobic T4 class Ia RNR, which is very similar to the T4 class III enzyme in its allosteric behavior, responds the same to hm-dCTP as it does to the allosteric effector dCTP (15.Berglund O. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 7276-7281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Berglund O. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 7450-7455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The allosteric regulation of T4-induced class III RNR is similar to that of the class Ib RNR from Salmonella typhimurium (34.Eliasson R. Pontis E. Jordan A. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26582-26587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and the class II enzymes (35.Goulian M. Beck W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 4233-4242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Beck W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 3148-3158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37.Chen A.K. Bhan A. Hopper S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 7182-7189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), i.e. RNRs with only one type of allosteric site (Table IV). This regulation is also seen for the class Ia RNR from phage T4 (15.Berglund O. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 7276-7281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).E. coli NrdD (class III), on the other hand, contains two types of allosteric sites; one site regulates reduction of the pyrimidine substrates (CTP and UTP) and the other reduction of the purine substrates (ATP and GTP) (17.Eliasson R. Pontis E. Sun X. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26052-26057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Class Ia enzymes also have two different types of allosteric sites; here one site regulates substrate specificity and another N-terminally located site regulates the overall activity of the enzyme by forming an active enzyme when ATP binds and an inactive enzyme when dATP binds (Table IV). Even though the allosteric regulation appears different for class Ia RNRs and E. coli class III RNR, a combination of sequence comparisons and structural considerations (14.Eriksson M. Uhlin U. Ramaswamy S. Ekberg M. Regnström K. Sjöberg B.-M. Eklund H. Structure. 1997; 5: 1077-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 19.Logan D.T. Andersson J. Sjöberg B.-M. Nordlund P. Science. 1999; 283: 1499-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) suggests that the overall location of the allosteric sites in all three RNR classes are similar. One type of allosteric site (the overall regulatory site in class Ia and the pyrimidine regulatory site in E. coli class III) is located in the N-terminal domain, and the other site (the allosteric specificity site in class Ia and the purine regulatory site in E. coli class III) is located at the dimer interface (Table IV). Class Ib enzymes and class II RNRs use only the allosteric specificity regulation at the dimer interface, and lack the overall activity control mediated by the N-terminal domain. This is achieved either by loss of physiological function of the N-terminal domain (some class II RNRs) or by loss of the N-terminal domain per se (class Ib and some class II RNRs).Table IVComparison of allosteric effects between different RNR classesBinding domainEffector boundType of RNRClass IaClass Ib, II, T4 class Ia, IIIE. coli class IIIN-terminalATPCTP/UTP reduction-aNo binding of allosteric effector or lack of binding siteCTP/UTP reductiondATPGeneral inactivation-aNo binding of allosteric effector or lack of binding siteInactivationDimer interfaceATPCTP/UTP reductionCTP/UTPbT4 class III RNR reduces CTP, but not UTPreduction-aNo binding of allosteric effector or lack of binding sitedATPCTP/UTP reductionCTP/UTPbT4 class III RNR reduces CTP, but not UTP reductionInactivationdTTPGTP reductionGTP reductionGTP reductiondGTPATP reductionATP reductionATP reductiona No binding of allosteric effector or lack of binding siteb T4 class III RNR reduces CTP, but not UTP Open table in a new tab The presence of only one allosteric site in T4 NrdD was expected from sequence and structure comparisons of RNRs showing that the T4 class III RNR lacks the residues corresponding to the N-terminal domain (14.Eriksson M.

Sjöberg B.-M. Nordlund P. Science. 1999; 283: 1499-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Also the class Ia RNR from phage T4 lacks negative allosteric control (15.Berglund O. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 7276-7281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), even though it comprises a N-terminal domain. It has been suggested that it is advantageous for viruses to encode RNRs that lack negative allosteric control, as this will allow a high dNTP flux to multiple replication forks and promote rapid lytic growth (39.Kreuzer K.N. Morrical S.W. Karam J.D. Molecular Biology of Bacteriophage T4. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1994: 28-42Google Scholar). At the extreme end are the herpesviruses, whose RNRs lack both negative and positive allosteric regulation (3.Averett D.R. Lubbers C. Elion G.B. Spector T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9831-9838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Averett D.R. Furman P.A. Spector T. J. Virol. 1984; 52: 981-983Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the allosteric regulation of L. lactis was recently investigated (18.Torrents E. Buist G. Liu A. Eliasson R. Kok J. Gibert I. Gräslund A. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2463-2471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), three class III RNRs can now be compared. The allosteric regulation for E. coli and L. lactisis similar though not identical, but differs from the phage RNR in that only one type of allosteric binding site is found (two are found forE. coli and L. lactis) and that dATP has a positive effect instead of being a negative inhibitor. The negative effects of dATP binding at the two different sites of the E. coli class III enzyme have not yet been experimentally distinguished from each other. Experiments where one of the sites is mutationally inactivated would be enlightening. Despite the differences between the three class III RNRs investigated so far, the common allosteric balancing of the dNTP pools by RNRs is maintained also by the class III enzymes. We thank Prof. I. Björk for help with derivation of equations for measuring indirect binding constants and Prof. L. Thelander for interest and support concerning the mixed-substrate assay."

The unc-33 mutations were unique in that they were associated with alterations in axonal outgrowth and guidance of several classes of neurons yet did not involve any defects in neural cell lineages, numbers, or positioning (7.Hedgecock E.M.

The gene responsible for this defect encoded a novel intracellular protein,unc-33, that was highly expressed within neuronal processes during early embyrogenesis (1.Li W. Herman R.K. Shaw J.E.

The first putative mammalian homologue of unc-33 was identified functionally as a 62-kDa protein, collapsin response-mediated protein (CRMP-62)1 that mediated collapsin signaling (9.Goshima Y.

During neural development, collapsins participate in axonal pathfinding by stimulating growth cone collapse and preventing neurite extension. The identification of otherunc-33-related genes followed; TOAD-64 (turnedon after cell division) was identified as a 64-kDa protein that was highly expressed in the brain, particularly in the cerebral granular neurons, after cessation of cell proliferation (10.Minturn J.E.

CRMP-1 and Ulip (CRMP-4) have the most restricted pattern of expression, being turned on in E15 and off in P15 rat brain tissue. Ulip/hUlip/CRMP-4/DRP-3 is highly expressed in fetal but not adult neural tissues by in situ analysis and evaluation of total RNA, yet it is not detected at comparable levels in fetal or adult muscle tissue (3.Wang L.H. Strittmatter S.M. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6197-6207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Gaetano C. Matsuo T. Thiele C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12195-12201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, when poly(A)+ Northern blots of normal tissues are examined, Ulip/hUlip/DRP-3/CRMP-4 is detected in newborn rat muscle and in the adult human heart and skeletal muscles (2.Byk T. Dobransky T. Cifuentes-Diaz C. Sobel A. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 688-701Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,11.Hamajima N. Matsuda K. Sakata S. Tamaki N. Sasaki M. Nonaka M. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 180: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The hUlip protein encodes a 62-kDa protein with no signal sequence, transmembrane domain, or classical protein interaction domains. However, hUlip contains a number of consensus phosphorylation sites that may serve as substrates for signaling molecules such as Cdk, protein kinase C, and proline-directed kinases (4.Gaetano C. Matsuo T. Thiele C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12195-12201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Increases in phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of hUlip and Ulip are detected upon induction of neuritogenesis by retinoids in neuroblastoma cells or by nerve growth factor in PC12 cells (2.Byk T. Dobransky T. Cifuentes-Diaz C. Sobel A. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 688-701Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Collapsin-induced neurite retraction is blocked in cells injected with antibodies to CRMP-62 (9.Goshima Y. Nakamura F. Strittmatter P. Strittmatter S.M. Nature. 1995; 376: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar), and experiments indicate that CRMP-62 is involved in G protein-mediated transduction of the collapsin signal (9.Goshima Y. Nakamura F. Strittmatter P. Strittmatter S.M. Nature. 1995; 376: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar) as well as other non-G protein-dependent effects on neurite extension and growth cone morphology. Functional studies in other tissues have not been evaluated. To evaluate the developmental regulatory mechanism of hUlip, we have isolated the hUlip genomic sequence and studied its structure, chromosomal location, 5′-flanking sequences, and expression. We demonstrate that two promoters exist in the 5′ region of the hUlip gene and that an evolutionarily conserved MyoD/myogenin site is necessary for optimal expression of hUlip in vitro. Two million phage clones from a human leukocyte genomic library in EMBL3 were screened using a 32P-labeled 1.8-kbXhoI–EspI fragment of the hUlip cDNA (4.Gaetano C. Matsuo T. Thiele C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12195-12201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), which encompasses the entire coding region. Five positive clones were identified, and phage DNA was isolated with a Lambda DNA isolation kit (Qiagen). For the characterization of selected genomic clones, phage DNA was analyzed by restriction endonuclease digestion withEcoRI or BamHI and subjected to Southern blot analysis to identify genomic DNA fragments that hybridized with a32P-labeled hUlip cDNA fragment. These fragments were subcloned into pBluescript SK(−) (Stratagene) and analyzed by restriction endonuclease digestion and sequencing.

Open table in a new tab To identify the putative hUlip exon 2 in the human genome, the PCR-based genome walking strategy was utilized (12.Siebert P.D. Chenchik A. Kellogg D.E. Lukyanov K.A. Lukyanov S.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1087-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). Sets of sense and antisense primers that are specific for exon 2 sequence and adaptor primers were used to amplify human genomic gene fragments with adaptor-ligated genomic DNA as templates (Genomewalker Kit,CLONTECH). The amplified products were subcloned into the PCR 2.1 vector (Invitrogen), and their sequences were verified. A 2.5-kbBamHI fragment of phage clone 4 that contained 2.3 kb 5′ to hUlip exon 1 was subcloned into pBluescript SK(−), and the entire nucleotide sequence was determined in both orientations (GenBankTM accession number AF246692). A computer search for putative cis-elements was performed with TESS (Transcription Elements Search Software; University of Pennsylvania) (13.Heinemeyer T. Wingender E. Reuter I. Hermjakob H. Kel A.E. Kel O.V. Ignatieva E.V. Ananko E.A. Podkolodnaya O.A. Kolpakov F.A. Podkolodny N.L. Kolchanov N.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 362-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). Additionally, a search for putative transcriptional start sites was executed using a neural network algorithm (14.Reese M.G. Eeckman F.H. The Seventh International Genome Sequencing and Analysis Conference, Hilton Head Island, SC, October 13–14, 1995. American Mathematical Society, Providence, RI1995: 152Google Scholar, 15.Reese M.G.

Phage clone hUlip-1 DNA was labeled with biotin-14-dATP using the BioNickTM kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). The labeled DNA was purified over a Bio-Spin 6 column (Bio-Rad) and coprecipitated with 10 μg of human Cot-1TM DNA (Life Technologies). Fluorescence in situ hybridization followed the method of Pinkel (16.Pinkel D. Straume T. Gray J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2934-2938Crossref PubMed Scopus (2964) Google Scholar). Biotin-labeled phage DNA (1.5 μg) in a 10-ml hybridization mix (50% formamide, 2× SSC (pH 6.3), 10% dextran sulfate) was hybridized overnight to normal human peripheral blood lymphocyte metaphase chromosomes. The slides were then washed three times in 50% formamide, 2× SSC at 45 °C for 20 min each. The hybridization signal was detected by two layers of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated avidin (Vector) and amplified with one layer of anti-avidin antibody (Vector). Slides were counterstained with 1 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidine-2′-phenylindone dihydrochloride (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in an antifade solution. A Zeiss Axiophot microscope equipped with a cooled charge-coupled device camera (Photometrics) was used for image acquisition. Image analysis was carried out with IP Laboratories Spectrum software (Signal Analytics). Fractional length measurements were made using the Fract Length 1 Probe Macro in the NIH Image software (Life Sciences Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory). C2C12 myoblasts were passaged subconfluently in DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum. For myogenic differentiation, parallel myoblast cultures were allowed to reach confluency, at which time they were induced to differentiate by feeding with DMEM supplemented with 2% horse serum and ITS (insulin, transferrin, and selenium; Life Technologies, Inc.). The neuroblastoma cell line SMS-KCNR was passaged in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Differentiation was induced by adjusting the medium to 5 μmall-trans-retinoic acid, and cells were harvested after 4 days of this treatment. The promoter region of the hUlip gene consisting of 2.3-kb 5′-flanking sequences and the first exon containing the AUG translational initiator was cloned into the promoterless luciferase reporter vector pGL2-basic (Promega). Initially, a 2.5-kb BamHI fragment from the genomic subclone 4B2.5 was subcloned into the BglII site of pGL2-basic, creating −2300UlipLuc. Subsequently, a series of 5′ nested deletions was derived from −2300UlipLuc using available restriction sites. The construct −2300UlipLuc was cut with XhoI in the pGL2 multicloning site to create a fixed 5′ boundary followed by digestion with one of the following restriction enzymes to produce progressively larger deletions (numbers in parenthesis are relative to the putative exon 1 transcriptional start site): SacI (−1180),BstXI (−940), NotI (−540), NruI (−290), PvuII (−150), SmaI (−20), orPstI (+120). Each of the double-digested reactions was treated with T4 DNA polymerase to remove overhangs, gel-purified, and recircularized with ligase. Insertion mutations were made in a putative E-box sequence at position −150 by cutting −2300UlipLuc withPvuII and using the terminal transferase activity ofTaq polymerase to add bases before recircularizing with ligase (17.Marchuk D. Drumm M. Saulino A. Collins F.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). Two mutants were manufactured by this technique, converting the wild type E-box CAGCTG to CAGGCCTG (E-GCUlipLuc) and CAGTACTG (E-TAUlipLuc). The above constructs and pCMVβgal were used to co-transfect C2C12 myoblasts and the neuroblastoma cell line NGP in parallel. DNA was introduced into the cells by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method (18.Wigler M. Pellicer A. Silverstein S. Axel R. Urlaub G. Chasin L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1373-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). One day before transfection, C2C12 myoblasts and NGP neuroblastoma cells were plated at 0.5 × 105 and 0.5 × 106 cells/well, respectively, on six-well plates using DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum for C2C12 and RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum for NGP cells. Four hours before transfection, the cells were fed with 2.5 ml of DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Thirty-six micrograms of DNA, including 3 μg of CMVβgal, was resuspended in 750 μl of 250 mm CaCl2 This solution was added dropwise, with vortexing, to 750 μl of 2× HEPES-buffered saline (280 mm NaCl, 50 mm N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N′-2-ethanesulfonic acid, 1.5 mmNa2HPO4·7H2O, pH 7.1) and kept for 30 min at room temperature. The suspension was then added at 240 μl/well to six-well plates. After 24 h, the medium was removed, and the plate was washed with 0.25 mmEDTA/phosphate-buffered saline and fed with DMEM (C2C12) or RPMI 1640 (NGP) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cell extracts were prepared 24 h later using 200 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega) per well. For determination of luciferase activities, 40 μl of cell lysate was aliquoted into a Microlite 2 96-well plate (Dynatech Laboratory Inc., Chantilly, VA), and the values of luciferase activities were determined using 100 μl of luciferase injection buffer (8.8 mmTricene, 33 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm ATP, 0.1 mm EDTA, 4 mm MgSO4, 0.6 mmluciferine, 0.3 mm coenzyme A, pH 7.8) in a luminometer (Wallac). For the β-galactosidase assay, 10 μl of supernatant was mixed with 100 μl of β-galactosidase assay buffer (0.1m NaHPO4, pH 8.0, 1 mmMgCl2) containing 1 μg/ml AMPDG buffer (Tropix, Bedford, MA) and incubated for 45 min at room temperature in darkness. Activities were then determined by injecting β-galactosidase injection buffer (0.2 m NaOH, 10% emerald enhancer (Tropix, Bedford, MA)) and quantitation in a luminometer. Previously, we identified a 1.71-kb open reading frame in a 5.5-kb hUlip cDNA, which encoded p62 hUlip (4.Gaetano C. Matsuo T. Thiele C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12195-12201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To determine the genomic structure of hUlip, we screened an EMBL3 leukocyte genomic library and found three overlapping human genomic DNA fragments (clones 1, 3, and 7) spanning 29 kb of DNA. These fragments were cloned, characterized, and found to correspond to 1.62 kb of hUlip cDNA including the 3′-untranslated region (Fig.1 A). The hUlip phage clone 4, whose insert size was 10.5 kb, contained a portion of the hUlip 5′-untranslated region, a region encoding the initiation methionine, an additional 12 amino acids, and a splice donor site. Eighty-nine base pairs of hUlip coding region sequence were not identified in the phage clones. Several library screens using the cDNA fragment corresponding to the putative exon 2 as well as the 5′ intronic region of exon 3 and the 3′ intronic region of exon 1 failed to isolate a genomic fragment containing exon 2 in the EMBL3 library. Therefore, we employed the PCR-based walking strategy to identify exon 2 sequences in the human genome, and two successive rounds of PCRs with the sets of sense or antisense primers each amplified 1.5-kb products. Sequence analysis reveals that these products overlap one another and contain the missing 89 bp of hUlip cDNA sequences (data not shown). Putative RNA splice acceptor and donor sites detected in these PCR products are compatible with the exon 1 donor and exon 3 acceptor splice sites. From these results, we conclude that these PCR products contain hUlip exon 2. Table I lists the oligonucleotide sequences used to define the intron/exon boundaries of the hUlip gene, and the sequences at the intron/exon junctions are given in Table II. The 1.71-kb open reading frame of the hUlip cDNA is distributed over 14 exons, and sequence analysis of the exon/intron boundaries reveals that all splice donor and acceptor sites follow the GT-AG splice junction consensus (19.Breathnach R. Chambon P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 349-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (3298) Google Scholar) (underlined in Table II).Table IIIntron/exon junction sequencesExonExon sizeSequence at exon/intron junctionAmino acid(s) interruptedIntron size bp5′ splice donor3′ splice acceptorbpbpAO≥95GGAAG/ GT AGG …4171206TCACG/ GT CAC …… GGCAG /CCGCCThr13↓Ser1426,838289ATAAA/ GT ATG …… CCTAG /AGTGALys4362443185GATCA/ GT AAG …… ACCAG /ACAAAIle10525744165CAAAG/ GT GAG …… TTC AG /TTCGAGly1602049562CAGAG/ GT AAC …… TGCAG /GGGTTGlu180↓Leu181906681CCCAG/ GT AAC …… TTCAG /CTCTAGln207↓Glu2083808769AAGAG/ GT AAG …… TTCAG /GAGCAGlu230↓Leu23129968121TAAAG/ GT GTA …… TGCAG /CTGGAGly27139119157GCCAG/ GT TGG …… TCTAG /GAAATSer32370210142CTGTG/ GT AAG …… GCCAG /CGGGGVal370↓Ala371143811171AGTCT/ GT AAG …… AATAG /GCCACSer427↓Ala428123612180GGAAG/ GT AAA …… TCTAG /GCGGCLys487↓Met488194313163GTCAG/ GT GAG …… TGCAG /ATGGCGly5421435143318… TGTAG /GCACC Open table in a new tab While this manuscript was in preparation, a search of the unfinished high throughput genomic sequence data base (htgs) identified a human chromosome 5 “working draft” sequence, consisting of five ordered contigs (accession number AC011373) that encompassed our hUlip genomic sequence. Alignment with this sequence definitively places the exon 2 PCR products between flanking genomic clone 3 and 4 sequences. Using these sequences in conjunction with sequences obtained from our overlapping genomic clones allowed the calculation of intron and exon sizes shown in Table II. Additionally, a search of EST data bases revealed an anaplastic oligodendroglioma sequence (accession number A1570709) that overlaps with exons 1–3 and extends 5′ for 127 bp. Alignment of this expressed sequence tag with genomic sequences defines an upstream exon (designated exon AO) (Fig. 1 A) and suggests that a cognate promoter also exists to transcribe this sequence in anaplastic oligodendroglioma. Since the hUlip gene product shares a significant number of conserved amino acid residues with the protein sequence of the C. elegans unc-33, we compared the genomic structure of hUlip andunc-33 (Fig. 1 B). In the worm, there are threeunc-33 mRNA transcripts of 3.8 kb (exons I–X), 3.3 kb (exons V–X) and 2.8 kb (exons VII–X). The 2.8-kb unc-33mRNA contains the 3′-half of exon VII as well as exons VIII–X, and this transcript corresponds to sequences conserved in all mammalianunc-33 family genes including the hUlip cDNA (1.Li W. Herman R.K. Shaw J.E. Genetics. 1992; 132: 675-689Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 5′ regions of the unc-33 transcripts are distinct, while the 3′ regions are identical, with all predicted transcripts being translated in the same open reading frame. The unc-33 exon VII and VIII and exon IX and X splice sites are identical to the hUlip exon 2 and 3 and exon 12 and 13 splice sites, respectively. hUlip exons 1–3 include the protein subdomain region A (Fig. 1 A and TableIII), which contains a region highly conserved with unc-33. This region is functionally important for the collapsin-induced Ca2+ influx response (9.Goshima Y. Nakamura F. Strittmatter P. Strittmatter S.M. Nature. 1995; 376: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). An overall comparison of the exonic structure of hUlip withunc-33 reveals four highly homologous regions (Table III). Amino acids encoded by hUlip exons 2 and 3 (region A), exons 6 and 7 (region B), and exons 10 and 11 (region C and the D region within C) showed significant sequence similarities of 41–56% withunc-33 (Fig. 1 A). These regions correspond to domains that were previously identified (Fig. 1 A) (2.Byk T. Dobransky T. Cifuentes-Diaz C. Sobel A. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 688-701Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Gaetano C. Matsuo T. Thiele C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12195-12201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). An additional conserved domain encoded by hUlip exon 14 (region E, Fig.1 A and Table III) shows a 41.4% homology withunc-33.Table IIIExonic structure of hUlip and unc-33hUlip geneunc-33ExonAmino acid residuesExonAmino acid residuesHomology%11–13VII313–32530.7214–43VII326–36153.3 aPercentage homologies above the overall value are shown with boldface numbers.343–105VIII361–38737.74105–160VIII387–47123.65160–180VIII471–48623.86181–207VIII487–51340.77208–230VIII514–53652.28231–271VIII537–57727.59271–323VIII577–62726.410323–370VIII, IX627–67341.511371–427IX674–73056.112428–487IX731–79026.713488–542X791–82411.114542–570X824–85441.4Overall homology36.2a Percentage homologies above the overall value are shown with boldface numbers. Open table in a new tab hUlip phage clone 1 was used to determine its chromosomal location. Specific hybridization was detected on the long arm of chromosome 5 in all 20 metaphases examined. Fractional length measurements (n = 30) yielded an average FLpter value of 0.823 ± 0.021, corresponding to a regional assignment of 5q32 (Fig. 2). In support of our finding, DRP-3 has been mapped to chromosome 5 by radiation hybrid mapping by the Whitehead Institute Center for Genome Research. A 2.5-kb BamHI fragment containing exons AO and 1 was sequenced to study the putative promoter region of the hUlip gene (Fig. 3,A and B). The outlined letters represent exonic sequence from hUlip cDNA. Theshaded boxes designate extended exon 1 and exon AO sequences derived from an anaplastic oligodendroglioma EST clone (accession number A1570709). 5′-Rapid amplification of cDNA ends was used to map transcriptional start sites in RNA from RA-treated neuroblastoma cells. Several putative start sites were found, although all of these were 3′ (within exon 1) to the 5′-end of a hUlip cDNA from a fetal brain cDNA library (data not shown). The 5′-end of the Ulip cDNA corresponds to −136 (relative to A+1TG) in the hUlip gene (Fig. 3 B). Additionally, this position corresponds to a putative start site predicted by a neural network algorithm (14.Reese M.G. Eeckman F.H. The Seventh International Genome Sequencing and Analysis Conference, Hilton Head Island, SC, October 13–14, 1995. American Mathematical Society, Providence, RI1995: 152Google Scholar, 15.Reese M.G.

A search for a −30 TATA box correlating with the 5′ terminus of known exon AO sequence did not reveal a TATA sequence. Although a consensus TATA sequence is found at −1166 bp, it seems unlikely that it is required for expression of exon AO sequences, since the size of the hUlip mRNA has been estimated to be between 5.5 and 5.8 kb by Northern analysis, which corresponds to the sum total of known exon sequences (4.Gaetano C. Matsuo T. Thiele C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12195-12201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The 2.8-kb unc-33 mRNA, which is most homologous to the hUlip mRNA, does not contain a TATA box in its 5′ region (1.Li W. Herman R.K. Shaw J.E. Genetics. 1992; 132: 675-689Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings along with the known characteristics of TATA-less promoters suggest that a primary start site exists at −136 with many heterogeneous starts occurring downstream in neuroblastoma cells. In anaplastic oligodendroglioma, presumably an upstream promoter is used, giving rise to a larger primary transcript beginning with exon AO, which is spliced to exon 1. Given that Ulip is expressed in nervous system tissue during development and is selectively expressed in adult muscle, the presence of a consensus MyoD/myogenin binding site at −288 bp in the putative hUlip promoter may be important. To determine if the MyoD/myogenin site is conserved evolutionarily, the corresponding 5′ region of the murine Ulip gene was sequenced (GenBankTM accessi"

The initiator tRNA containing the U35A36 mutation (CUA anticodon) initiates from UAG codon. However, an additional mutation at position 72 (72A → G) renders the tRNA (G72/U35A36) inactive in initiation because it is defective in formylation. In this study, we isolated U1G72/U35A36 tRNA containing a wobble base pair at 1–72 positions as an intragenic suppressor of the G72 mutation. The U1G72/U35A36 tRNA is formylated and participates in initiation. More importantly, we show that the mismatch at 1–72 positions of the initiator tRNA, which was thus far thought to be the hallmark of the resistance of this tRNA against peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase (PTH), is not sufficient. The amino acid attached to the initiator tRNA is also important in conferring protection against PTH. Further, we show that the relative levels of PTH and IF2 influence the path adopted by the initiator tRNAs in protein synthesis. These findings provide an important clue to understand the dual function of the single tRNAMet in initiation and elongation, in the mitochondria of various organisms.

Of these, the initiator recognizes the initiation codons (AUG, GUG, AUU, UUG, etc.), and the elongator decodes the subsequent AUG codons in a mRNA (1.Kozak M. Microbiol. Rev. 1983; 47: 1-45Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both species of the tRNA are aminoacylated by the same methionyl-tRNA synthetase. In eubacteria, the initiators (Met-tRNAfMet) are then further modified by formyltransferase to generate formylmethionyl-tRNA (fMet-tRNAfMet), which interacts with IF2 to participate at the step of initiation (2.Gualerzi C.

The major structural features that distinguish the initiators from elongators are located within the acceptor and the anticodon stems (5.Guillon J.-M. Mechulam Y. Blanquet S. Fayat G. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4507-4514Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Varshney U. Lee C.P. RajBhandary U.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A striking feature of the eubacterial initiator tRNAs is the presence of a mismatch at the 1–72 positions, which constitutes an important element for their recognition by formyltransferase (8.Lee C.P.

The mismatch also prevents the binding of the initiators to EF-Tu and renders the fMet-tRNAfMet resistant to peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase, PTH1 (12.Schulman L.H. Pelka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 542-547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), an enzyme which hydrolyzes N-blocked aminoacyl and the peptidyl tRNAs to facilitate tRNA recycling (13.Kossel H.

New Biol. 1972; 240: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The initiator tRNA containing CAU to CUA anticodon change, tRNAfMet (U35A36), is aminoacylated with glutamine (15.Schulman L.H. Pelka H. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 7309-7314Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and initiates with formyl-glutamine utilizing UAG as an initiation codon inEscherichia coli (16.Varshney U. RajBhandary U.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1586-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, the tRNAfMet(U35A36) was rendered nonfunctional in initiation when coupled with an A to G mutation at position 72 (G72/U35A36). The G72 mutation replaced the CxA mismatch at the top of the acceptor stem with a strong C-G base pair. The G72/U35A36 tRNA could be aminoacylated with glutamine but failed to initiate because it is an extremely poor substrate for formyltransferase (8.Lee C.P. RajBhandary U.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18012-18017Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Varshney U Lee C.P. Seong B.L. RajBhandary U.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18018-18024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we show that a spontaneous intragenic mutation (C → T) corresponding to position 1 of mature tRNA in the G72/U35A36 tRNA gene rescues its defect in initiation. In vivo studies on the state of tRNAfMet, tRNAfMet (U35A36), and their U1-G72 derivatives show that, in addition to the 1–72 pair, the amino acid attached to the tRNA also plays an important role in its recognition by PTH. Further, we have studied the influence of PTH and IF2 overproduction on the path followed by the initiators in different steps during protein synthesis. These are summarized in TableI (16.Varshney U.

During the course of isolating multicopy suppressors for G72/U35A36 tRNA by using the protocol described previously (22.Varshney U. RajBhandary U.L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7819-7826Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we serendipitously isolated a chloramphenicol-resistant clone, which did not contain a genomic insert. The DNA sequence analysis revealed a single nucleotide change (C → T) in the tRNA gene resulting in the isolation of U1G72/U35A36 as an intragenic suppressor of G72/U35A36 tRNA. Cell-free extracts were prepared and assayed for β-lactamase, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), and β-galactosidase activities using PADAC (7-(thienyl-2-acetamido)-3,2-(4-N,N,dimethylaminophenyl-azo) pyridinium methyl-3-cephem-4 carboxylic acid),14C-chloramphenicol, and orthonitrophenyl-β-d-galactoside, respectively, as substrates (17.Varshney U Lee C.P. Seong B.L. RajBhandary U.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18018-18024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The β-lactamase activities were determined for 5 μg of cell-free extract (17.Varshney U Lee C.P. Seong B.L. RajBhandary U.L. J. Biol.

CAT assays were carried out by using 0.2–1.0 μg of cell-free extract. Percent chloramphenicol converted to acetyl chloramphenicol (1-acetyl and 3-acetyl chloramphenicol) was then extrapolated to calculate chloramphenicol conversion/μg of cell-free extract and normalized with respect to the corresponding β-lactamase activity. The initiation activity of tRNAfMet(U35A36) was set as 100%, and all other activities were shown relative to this activity. The β-galactosidase activities were determined in Miller units (17.Varshney U Lee C.P. Seong B.L. RajBhandary U.L. J. Biol.

The assays were done at least twice, and the values did not vary by more than 10%. The average values are shown in Tables III and IV.

Elongation activities have been shown in relative Miller units (Experimental Procedures) Total tRNA from various transformants was isolated under acidic conditions, separated on 6.5% acid urea gels at 4 °C, and electroblotted onto a Nytran membrane (26.Varshney U. Lee C.P. RajBhandary U.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24712-24718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 5′-32P end-labeled oligodeoxyribonucleotides used as probes for different blots were complementary to positions 29–47 of tRNA2fMet (U35A36) and 2–44 of tRNATyr. Conditions used for hybridization of the blots have been described (26.Varshney U. Lee C.P. RajBhandary U.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24712-24718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 19-mer oligomer probe is complementary to the anticodon region to the U35A36 tRNAs, and it possesses two mismatches in the middle when compared with the wild type tRNA sequence. Thus the signals on the Northern blots correspond to the initiator tRNA mutants and not to the endogenous host initiator tRNA (fMet). For detection of tRNA2fMetor its derivatives with the wild type anticodon (CAU), an oligomer complementary to positions 40–56 of the tRNA2fMet was used. This oligomer contains a single mismatch in middle when compared with the tRNA1fMet. Further to avoid signals from the host initiator tRNA, we have used E. coli B105 as host, which contains only the genes corresponding to tRNA1fMet. The formylated tRNAs were treated either with 100 mmTris-HCl (pH 9.0) or 100 mm CuSO4 to generate deacylated and formylated markers, respectively. The CuSO4deacylates the aminoacyl-tRNAfMet but not the formylaminoacyl-tRNAfMet, whereas the alkali treatment deacylates both (27.Sarin P.S. Zamecnik P.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1964; 91: 653-655PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Schofield P. Zamecnik P.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 155: 410-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Glutaminyl tRNA synthetase was purified as before (29.Perona J.J. Swanson R. Steitz T.A. Soll D. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 202: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Initiator tRNAs were overproduced in E. coli B105 from respective genes cloned on moderate copy plasmid pBR322. Total tRNA from 400-ml log phase cultures were prepared by phenol chloroform extraction method described before (30.Seong B.L. RajBhandary U.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 334-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The mutant tRNAs were purified further from native polyacrylamide gels (30.Seong B.L. RajBhandary U.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 334-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and used in aminoacylation reactions. All the initiator tRNAs used in this study are derived from the tRNA2fMetvariant, not present in the E. coli B105 host. The native gel electrophoresis system affords a clear separation between the tRNA1fMet and tRNA2fMet in the fastest moving region of the gel occupied with no other tRNAs (19.Mandal N. RajBhandary U.L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7827-7830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus the tRNA preparations are not only free from other tRNAs but also devoid of the host initiator tRNA background. The pure tRNAs were quantified by absorbance at 260 nm. The 32P body-labeled tRNAs, used to spike the cold tRNA preparations to follow the aminoacylation were also purified as above except that the cells harvested from 4-ml log phase cultures were grown further in low phosphate-containing culture medium supplemented with 0.5 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate for 1 h (30.Seong B.L. RajBhandary U.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 334-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Aminoacylation reactions (25.Seong B.L. Lee C.P. RajBhandary U.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6504-6508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were carried out in a 30-μl volume with 60,000 cpm of labeled tRNA, 500 pmols (12.5 μg) of unlabeled pure tRNA at 37 °C for various times. The GlnRS concentrations for different tRNAs were decided from range finding experiments. Aliquots (5 μl) were drawn at different time points and fractionated on acid urea gels (26.Varshney U. Lee C.P. RajBhandary U.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24712-24718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The bands corresponding to aminoacylated and deacylated tRNA were visualized by autoradiography, and the corresponding gel pieces were quantified using a scintillation counter. The percent aminoacylation was calculated as [{counts in the aminoacylated band/(counts in the aminoacylated band + counts in the remaining deacylated band)} × 100] and was used to determine pmols of product formed/μg of GlnRS, which in turn was plotted as a function of time. Initial velocities of aminoacylation were determined from the slopes of the straight lines corresponding to the initial phase of the reaction. The binary plasmid system used to carry out in vivo initiation assays is shown in Fig. 1 A. The ACYC origin of replication based plasmid, pACQS, harbors glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase gene. The ColE1-based plasmid, pCATam1 metY CUA, carries the mutant initiator tRNA (U35A36 or G72/U35A36) and the CAT reporter, CATam1, genes (16.Varshney U. RajBhandary U.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1586-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The mutants of initiator tRNA with U35A36 (CAU to CUA anticodon change) are aminoacylated with glutamine. The U35A36 tRNA initiates from the UAG initiation codon of the reporter mRNA and confers chloramphenicol resistance. However, the G72/U35A36 tRNA fails to initiate because it is defective in formylation. During the course of characterizing suppressors for the G72/U35A36 tRNA (see “Experimental Procedures”) we isolated a chloramphenicol-resistant clone, which contained a single nucleotide change (C → T) in the G72/U35A36 tRNA gene. The mutation corresponded to position 1 of the mature tRNA and resulted in the replacement of the C1-G72 base pair with the U1-G72 wobble base pair (Fig. 1 B). DNA sequence analysis of the translation initiation region of the CATam1 gene did not reveal any new mutations. The cell-free extracts prepared from the transformants harboring the U35A36 or U1G72/U35A36 tRNA were assayed for the relative CAT activity (normalized to β-lactamase activities). Compared with the U35A36 tRNA (100%), the U1G72/U35A36 tRNA was ∼56% active in initiation (TableIII). Total tRNAs were isolated under acidic conditions and analyzed on acid urea gels to determinein vivo status of the G72/U35A36 and U1G72/U35A36 tRNAs. As reported (26.Varshney U. Lee C.P. RajBhandary U.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24712-24718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the G72/U35A36 tRNA was distributed between deacylated and aminoacylated forms (Fig. 2,lane 3), whereas the U1G72/U35A36 tRNA accumulated in deacylated and formylated forms (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and2). Presence of the formylated form of U1G72/U35A36 tRNA explained its activity in initiation. However, considering that the U1G72/U35A36 tRNA lacked a Watson-Crick base pair at the 1–72 positions and that the analysis was carried out under GlnRS overproduction, it was intriguing (31.Rould M.A. Perona J.J. Soll D. Steitz T.A. Science. 1989; 246: 1135-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar) to note that a substantial amount of this tRNA accumulated in the deacylated form (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 2). The presence of a predominant single band corresponding to Tyr-tRNATyr showed that the tRNAs were not deacylated during preparation. Therefore, the accumulation of the deacylated form could either be because of the inefficient aminoacylation or because the fGln-tRNAfMet(U1G72/U35A36) is a substrate for PTH. The efficiencies of aminoacylation as determined from the initial velocities are presented in TableII. Consistent with earlier observations, the relative efficiency of aminoacylation of G72/U35A36 tRNA was ∼6% with respect to the U35A36 tRNA. Rate of aminoacylation of U1G72/U35A36 tRNA was substantially better than that of the G72/U35A36 tRNA and only ∼2-fold worse than that the U35A36 tRNA. Interestingly, the aminoacylation efficiency of the U1G72/U35A36 tRNA was as good as the U1/U35A36 tRNA containing the U1-A72 base pair similar to the one found in the tRNAGln (31.Rould M.A. Perona J.J. Soll D. Steitz T.A. Science. 1989; 246: 1135-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar).Table IIEfficiency of aminoacylation of tRNAs by GlnRStRNAEfficiency of aminoacylation%U35A36100U1G72/U35A3657.1U1/U35A3650G72/U35A366.1 Open table in a new tab In vivo status of the U1G72/U35A36 tRNA was analyzed in two additional strains of E. coli, CP78 and AA7852, in the presence or absence of GlnRS overproduction (Fig.3). The two strains are isogenic except that AA7852 carries a temperature-sensitive mutation in pth(permissive at 30 °C and nonpermissive at 37 °C). The U1/U35A36 tRNA, with a Watson-Crick base pair at positions 1–72 (U1-A72), is a good substrate for PTH and was used as a control. In the CP78 strain, expectedly, the U1/U35A36 tRNA accumulated only in deacylated form irrespective of the levels of GlnRS or the growth temperature (Fig. 3, lanes 1–4). As before (Fig. 2), the U1G72/U35A36 tRNA was found distributed between the formylated and deacylated forms (Fig. 3, lanes 5–8). However, in the absence of GlnRS overproduction, the tRNA accumulated somewhat more in the deacylated form (compare lanes 5 with 6, or7 with 8) irrespective of the temperature at which the cells were grown (compare lanes 5 and 6with 7 and 8, respectively). On the other hand, in the AA7852 strain, at the permissive temperature (30 °C) the U1/U35A36 was found to be distributed between the deacylated and formylated forms, and as expected its accumulation in the formylated form increased substantially when GlnRS was overproduced (compare lanes 9 and 10). Although at the nonpermissive temperature (37 °C) both the deacylated and the formylated forms were seen, all of the deacylated form was converted into the formylated form in the presence of GlnRS overproduction (compare lanes 11 and 12). This observation suggested that although PTH is a major reason for the U1/U35A36 tRNA to accumulate into the deacylated form, its poor aminoacylation by GlnRS also contributed to it. Similar to U1/U35A36 tRNA, U1G72/U35A36 tRNA was distributed between the formylated and the deacylated forms at the permissive temperature in the AA7852 strain. However, it was seen to accumulate entirely in the formylated state at the nonpermissive temperature, irrespective of the state of GlnRS overproduction. These observations suggested that U1G72/U35A36 tRNA is a substrate for PTH albeit not as good as the U1/U35A36 tRNA, which contains a Watson-Crick base pair at the 1–72 positions. To confirm our observations further, we cloned the pth gene into pCATam1 harboring the U1G72/U35A36 or the U35A36 tRNA genes (pCATam1.metY U1G72/CUA pthand pCATam1.metY CUA pth, respectively) and analyzed the tRNAs on acid urea gels (Fig.4). Upon PTH overproduction, the U1G72/U35A36 tRNA accumulated into aminoacylated and deacylated forms (Fig. 4 A, lane 2). A band corresponding to its formylated form was not detectable showing that in vivo,U1G72/U35A36 is a substrate for PTH. However, to our surprise, the U35A36 tRNA with a mismatch at the 1–72 positions accumulated entirely into the deacylated form upon PTH overproduction (Fig. 4 B, compare lanes 3 and 4 or 5 and6). The marker, lanes 1 and 2,correspond to the deacylated and the formylated forms of the U35A36 tRNA, respectively. Complete lack of accumulation of aminoacylated form of U35A36 tRNA (as opposed to U1G72/U35A36 tRNA) is most likely because this tRNA is a very good substrate for formyltransferase, and as soon as it is formylated, it is hydrolyzed by PTH or utilized in initiation through IF2 (as shown below). These results suggested that the mismatch at the 1–72 positions, which is considered a hallmark for the resistance of the initiator tRNA toward PTH, is not sufficient in preventing its hydrolysis by PTH. Thus the presence of a minor band corresponding to the deacylated form of the U35A36 tRNA in the absence of GlnRS overproduction (Fig. 4 B, lane 3) could be because of a combined effect of lower rates of aminoacylation and the partial hydrolysis of the formylated tRNA by PTH. In nature, initiation occurs with fMet. For efficient initiation, it is desirable that the fMet-tRNAfMet is prevented from its wasteful hydrolysis because of PTH. Our observation, that the CxA mismatch at 1–72 positions of the tRNAfMet is not sufficient in conferring resistance to PTH, was made with a tRNA-carrying fGln. Could it be that the amino acid attached to the tRNA also plays a role in preventing its hydrolysis by PTH? Therefore, we examined the steady state levels of tRNAfMet (U1G72) and tRNAfMet (with CAU anticodon, hence aminoacylated with Met) in the presence or absence of PTH and/or MetRS overproduction in E. coli B105, which lacks endogenous tRNA2fMet (19.Mandal N. RajBhandary U.L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7827-7830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because all our tRNA mutants are derivatives of tRNA2fMet, it was possible to detect the tRNA2fMet free from the host background of tRNA1fMet by the use of an oligomeric probe spanning the variable loop. This region harbors adenosine at position 46 in tRNA2fMet as opposed to 7-methyl guanosine in tRNA1fMet (32.Dube S.K. Marcker K.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 8: 256-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Both the tRNAfMet and the corresponding tRNAfMet(U1G72) were completely formylated with or without overproduction of MetRS (Fig. 5,lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7). And, as would be relevant from the physiological considerations, the fMet-tRNAfMetremained formylated even when PTH was overproduced (lanes 2and 4). On the other hand, overproduction of PTH resulted in the appearance of the aminoacylated and deacylated forms of tRNAfMet (U1G72) (lane 6), suggesting that the tRNAfMet (U1G72) is a substrate for PTH even when fMet was attached to it. Expectedly, when MetRS was overproduced, the deacylated form was converted into the aminoacylated form (lane 8). The fact that even upon PTH overproduction a considerable level of tRNA (U1G72) is detected in the formylated form and suggested that the initiator tRNAs are more resistant to PTH when they carry fMet than when they carry fGln. Nevertheless, these observations show that both the amino acid and the 1–72 positions are important in recognition or rejection of the initiator tRNAs by PTH. As the formylated forms of the U1G72/U35A36 and U35A36 were hydrolyzed by PTH, it was of interest to investigate the in vivo initiation activities of these tRNAs in the presence and the absence of PTH overproduction. Further, as both the PTH and IF2 bind to the formylated forms of tRNA, the effect of IF2 overproduction was also studied (Table III). Upon PTH overproduction, the initiation activity of the U1G72/U35A36 tRNA decreased by ∼15-fold (3.8% from 56.14%). Consistent with this drastic decrease in initiation, steady state accumulation of the formylated form of the U1G72/U35A36 tRNA was also not seen (Fig.4 A, lane 2). On the other hand, although the U35A36 tRNA also did not show any steady state accumulation of formylated form (Fig. 4 B, lane 4 and6), in this case there was only a 2-fold decrease (47.7% from 100%) in initiation upon PTH overproduction. A most likely explanation for this apparent disparity is that the two tRNAs have different affinities toward IF2. This difference in the affinity toward IF2 also provides a rationale for nearly half as efficient initiation with U1G72/U35A36 tRNA (with respect to U35A36 tRNA) (Table III) even though considerable levels of this tRNA accumulated in the formylated form in the absence of PTH overproduction (Fig. 2). As shown in Table III, overproduction of IF2 led to an increase in initiation (4–5-fold) by both the tRNAs (100 to 511 for U35A36 and 56.14 to 230.8 for U1G72/U35A36 tRNAs). Interestingly, in the presence of IF2 overproduction, the initiation activities of the tRNAs without or with PTH overproduction were comparable (511 versus494.71 and 230.8 versus 238.8 for U35A36 and U1G72/U35A36 tRNAs, respectively), and the decrease in initiation activity because of PTH overproduction was completely annulled by simultaneous overproduction of IF2. Consistent with this observation, overproduction of IF2 facilitated accumulation of U35A36 tRNA in formylated form (compare Fig. 4 B, lanes 5 and 6, with Fig. 6, lanes 1 and2). Similarly, overproduction of IF2 resulted in the presence of a single band corresponding to the formylated form of U1G72/U35A36 tRNA (compare Fig. 4 A, lane 1, to Fig. 6, lane 3). However, as the U1G72/U35A36 tRNA is a good substrate for PTH, the absence of the formylated form in the presence of PTH overproduction, even when IF2 was simultaneously overproduced (Fig. 6, lane 4), was not unexpected. It is very likely that as soon as the tRNA is formylated it is hydrolyzed by PTH and the protection conferred by IF2 binding is not detectable by Northern analysis of the total tRNA, which detects the steady state levels of the different forms. The CxA mismatch at positions 1–72 of the tRNAfMet and the formylation of the initiator tRNAs prevent their binding to EFTu and therefore their participation in elongation. Creation of a base pair at the 1–72 position allows the initiator tRNAs to bind to EFTu and participate at the elongation step (25.Seong B.L. Lee C.P. RajBhandary U.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6504-6508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Varshney U. Lee C.P. RajBhandary U.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24712-24718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, using tRNAfMet (U35A36) it was shown that upon EFTu overproduction, it participated in elongation even though it contains the CxA mismatch at 1–72 positions (3.Guillon J.-M. Heiss S. Soutourina J. Mechulam Y. Laalami S. Grunberg-Monago M. Blanquet S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22321-22325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). E. coli CA274 has an internal amber mutation in thelacZ gene. This amber codon can be suppressed by tRNAs with the CUA anticodon, and the β-galactosidase thus produced provides a measure of their elongation activities (33.Seong B.L. RajBhandary U.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8859-8863Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). As shown in TableIV, the U35A36 tRNA (carrying the CxA mismatch at the 1–72 positions) showed a basal level of β-galactosidase activity (77.7 units). Upon PTH overproduction, this activity increased to 511.9 units. Similarly, although the U1G72/U35A36 tRNA served as a better elongator (1517.1 units), its activity in elongation increased further when PTH was overproduced (3413.8 units). Interestingly, when IF2 was simultaneously overproduced, these elongation activities decreased to 70.1, 113.7, 213.1, and 774.7 (TableIV). Our studies with a formylation-defective initiator tRNA (G72/U35A36) resulted in isolation of an intragenic suppressor (U1G72/U35A36). The presence of the U1G72/U35A36 tRNA in formylated form (Fig. 2) explains its activity in initiation and highlights the significance of formylation in protein synthesis in E. coli. More importantly, the biochemical and the in vivo analyses involving U1G72/U35A36 tRNA have allowed us to elaborate on the distribution of the initiator tRNAs with various proteins that interact with them. We show that, in vivo, the tRNAs with a wobble base pair (U1-G72) at the top of acceptor stem are substrates for PTH. Also, we discovered that the mismatch (C1xA72) alone at these positions of the initiator tRNA, which was thus far considered to be a hallmark for its resistance toward hydrolysis by PTH, is not sufficient in preventing the wasteful hydrolysis of the formylated tRNA because of PTH. The role of the amino acid attached to the tRNA becomes evident from the observation that initiator tRNA (with C1xA72 mismatch) is completely resistant to hydrolysis by PTH when charged with fMet but not when it was charged with fGln (Figs. 4 and 5). The crystal structure of PTH shows that its active/binding site accommodates the C-terminal end (Lys191-Ala-Gln193) of the neighboring PTH molecule via several electrostatic interactions (34.Schmitt E. Mechulam Y. Fromant M. Plateau P. Blanquet S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4760-4769Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Our observations that (i) fGln-tRNAfMet (CUA) is a substrate for PTH and the fMet-tRNAfMet is not and (ii) the fGln-tRNAfMet(U1G72/U35A36) is a better substrate than the fMet-tRNAfMet(U1G72) for PTH (Figs. 4 and 5) do suggest that the side chains of the amino acids influence the contacts between the enzyme and the substrate and thereby affect the esterase activity of the enzyme. In addition, an earlier observation that AcMet-tRNAfMet (U1G72) was not a substrate for PTH (35.Dutka S. Meinnel T. Lazennec C. Mechulam Y. Blanquet S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4025-4030Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) may be extended to suggest that the nature of modification of the α-amino group of the amino acid attached to the initiator tRNA may also contribute to its recognition by PTH. However, considering that the physiological role of PTH demands nonselectivity toward its substrate, these effects may be subtle for the tRNAs attached to larger size peptides. Overproduction of IF2 led to an ∼5-fold increase in the efficiency of initiation with fGln (Table III). Importantly, when IF2 was overproduced simultaneously with the PTH, it rescued the decrease in initiation activity that resulted upon the overproduction of PTH alone. The protective effect of IF2 on the formylated tRNAs against their hydrolysis by PTH was also clearly discernible from the steady state accumulation of the different forms of tRNA in the cell (compare Figs.4 and 6). Our data suggest that after its aminoacylation the initiator tRNA is distributed between the formyltransferase and EFTu. The majority of the aminoacyl-tRNAfMet bound to formyltransferase is formylated and committed for the purpose of initiation (Fig.7, bold arrows). Evidently, when this equilibrium is favored for binding of the initiator tRNAs to EFTu by its overproduction (3.Guillon J.-M. Heiss S. Soutourina J. Mechulam Y. Laalami S. Grunberg-Monago M. Blanquet S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22321-22325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), their participation in elongation is detectable and significant. Thus, a small population of the initiator tRNA must bind to EFTu (Fig. 7, thin arrows) even when EFTu is not overproduced. Understandably, the mutants of initiators, which are poor substrates for formyltransferase, would partition more with EFTu. This interpretation is corroborated by an earlier study wherein the mutant initiator tRNAs such as U1/U3A70/U35A36, G3C70/U35A36, G72/U35A36, G72G73/U35A36, and U1/U2A70/U35A36 etc., which are poor substrates for the formyltransferase, function as good elongators (17.Varshney U Lee C.P. Seong B.L. RajBhandary U.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18018-18024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we observed that overproduction of PTH led to substantial increase in elongation activity of U35A36 and U1G72/U35A36 tRNAs. Because the EFTu binds to the aminoacyl tRNA and the PTH binds to the formylated form of the tRNA, PTH overproduction is unlikely to have any direct effect in facilitating better binding of the aminoacyl tRNA to EFTu. A simple interpretation of this observation is that every time an aminoacyl tRNA is released from the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase, it is subjected to competition for its binding between the formyltransferase and EFTu. Although the wild type initiator binds predominantly to formyltransferase, some finite fraction of the aminoacyl-tRNA that escapes binding to formyltransferase must partition with EFTu and which in turn participates in elongation. The fact that fGln-tRNAfMet (CUA) is a substrate for PTH, suggests that the overproduction of PTH greatly enhances the turnover of the formylated tRNA (Fig. 7). The cumulative effect of the small finite fractions of the aminoacylated tRNA that bind to EFTu thus results in a significant level of elongation by the initiator tRNA. Because both the IF2 and PTH bind to the formylated tRNA, it is reasonable to assume that the two proteins compete with one another for the formylaminoacyl-tRNA available in the cell. Thus, our observation that overproduction of IF2 results in steady state accumulation of the formylated tRNA is a consequence of the protection conferred by IF2 against hydrolysis by PTH. However, an implication of this finding is that overproduction of IF2 decreases the levels of the formylated form of the tRNA in the cell that now remains available to bind to PTH for its hydrolysis. Consistent with our hypothesis that it is the increased turn over of formylated tRNA that is responsible for its participation in elongation, IF2 overproduction abates the elongation activity of the initiator tRNA that accrued as a result of PTH overproduction. In conclusion, our studies with PTH and/or IF2 overproduction show that a critical balance of various proteins that interact with the initiator tRNA is crucial to ensure its appropriate use in the cell. Further, these studies provide an important clue to understand the dual function of a single tRNAMet in initiation and elongation in the mitochondria of various organisms (36.Sprinzl M. Horn C. Brown M. Ioudovitch A. Steinberg S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 148-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). We thank Prof. U. L.

In the present paper, we report the effects of ligands on the proteolytic cleavage and on the domain structure of EF-3. All materials used were obtained from standard sources as described in previous papers (12.Kambampati R. Chakraburtty K. J. Biol.

EF-3 was purified to homogeneity from an overexpressing yeast strain containing the plasmid-borne YEF3 gene according to Kambampati and Chakraburtty (16.Kambampati R. Chakraburtty K. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 10: 209-213Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed using 10% gels as described (17.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (207472) Google Scholar). For Western blotting, proteins were transferred electrophoretically to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and developed with a polyclonal antibody to EF-3 (18.Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc.

The nucleotide hydrolytic activity of EF-3 was measured under standard assay conditions (15.Kovalchuke O. Chakraburtty K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 133-140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To measure the ribosome-stimulated ATPase activity of EF-3, 6.3 pmol of twice washed yeast ribosomes were included in the reaction. The amount of32Pi released from [γ-32P]ATP was measured according to our previously published protocol (15.Kovalchuke O. Chakraburtty K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 133-140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). EF-3 (0.6 mg/ml) in 0.1m Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, was digested at 30 °C with TPCK-trypsin at an EF-3/trypsin (w/w) ratio of 125:1. Reactions were carried out in buffer A (25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm Mg(OAc)2, 50 mmNH4Cl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 3% glycerol). Aliquots containing 2 μg of EF-3 were removed at various times, and the digestions were terminated with a 5-fold excess (w/w) of soybean trypsin inhibitor. Samples were either assayed for the ATPase activity or diluted into SDS sample buffer, heated at 90 °C for 10 min, and subjected to electrophoresis. All measurements were carried out at room temperature (22 °C) using an SLM 4800C spectrofluorometer equipped with xenon arc light source. Slits of 4-nm width were used for excitation and emission. The emission spectra of EF-3 (10 μg/ml in buffer A) were recorded by excitation at 294 nm in a rectangular quartz cuvette (inner diameter, 10 mm). The observed fluorescence intensities were corrected by subtracting the appropriate blanks and are expressed in arbitrary units. The gel mobility shift assays were carried out according to the published protocol of Lohman et al.(19.Lohman T.M. Overman L.B. Datta S. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 603-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). EF-3 plus tRNAPhe was incubated in buffer A at 30 °C for 10 min. Samples were analyzed by agarose-gel electrophoresis (1.5% agarose containing 0.5% ethidium bromide) in a low salt running buffer (20 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.8, 0.4 mm sodium acetate, 0.2 mm Na2EDTA). Samples of 30-μl volume were mixed with 2 μl of the gel loading buffer (0.04% bromphenol blue in 50% glycerol). Electrophoresis was conducted at 4 °C at a constant voltage of 7 V/cm. The migration was monitored during the run with a hand-held UV lamp and was photographed in a UVP gel documentation system. Tryptic fragments of EF-3 were excised from the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and subjected to sequence analysis on a pulsed liquid phase protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems/Perkin Elmer, model 477A). Phenylthiohydantoin-derivatives were chromatographed by an on-line HPLC unit, model 120A. Sequencing data were derived from the algorithm of the instrument and by manual evaluation of the chromatogram. The excised peptides from Coomassie-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels were reduced, denatured, and alkylated with iodoacetamide prior to digestion with trypsin. All cysteine residues were converted to carboxyamidomethylcysteine due to alkylation. Each peptide mixture was run through a capillary HPLC system using a Hewlett-Packard 1100 quaternary HPLC pump and an LC Packing Vydac C18 P3 300 A 300-μm x 150-mm capillary column. Eluent A was 2% acetonitrile in water with 0.02% trifluoroacetic acid, and B was 2% acetonitrile in water with 0.018% trifluoroacetic acid. Gradient elutions from 0% B to 90% over 40 min at a flow rate of 3 μl/min provided separation of the peptides. The eluents were introduced into a Finnigan (San Jose, CA) LCQ mass spectrometer fitted with an ESI interface. The peptide samples were introduced without any splitting, and a mass spectrometer was used to scan from 360 to 2,000 Da. The mass of the peptides containing 3 or <3 amino acid residues could not be detected accurately by this method. For peptides greater than 2 kDa, [M+2H]2+, [M+3H]3+, and [M+4H]4+ were monitored by the instrument. Treatment of EF-3 with TPCK-trypsin (8 μg of trypsin/mg of EF-3) at 30 °C generated three large and several small peptides (Fig.1). The estimated molecular masses of the large peptides (designated as A, B1, and C) were 90, 70, and 50 kDa, respectively. A close examination of the intensities of the fragments generated during the tryptic time course revealed that fragment A was converted to fragment C through fragment B1. Fragment C remained stable to proteolysis up to 60 min (lane 8). The 90-kDa fragment A was stable to proteolysis at 0 °C (12.Kambampati R. Chakraburtty K. J. Biol.

The relative stability of the fragments B1 and C from trypsinolysis suggests the possible existence of two distinct subdomain structures within fragment A. The low molecular weight peptides (<30 kDa) that appeared at 1 min (lane 2) were completely degraded by 10 min of digestion (lane 5). A similar proteolytic cleavage pattern for EF-3 was reported by Miyazaki et al. (13.Miyazaki M. Uritani M. Kagiyama H. J. Biochem. 1988; 104: 445-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and Ladror et al. (14.Ladror U.S. Egan D.A. Snyder S.W. Capobianco J.O. Goldman R.C. Dorwin S.A. Johnson R.W. Edalji R.

Data reported by Mizyaki et al. showed the presence of an additional proteolytic fragment B2, which we observed only when EF-3 was digested in the presence of ATP (see Fig. 4 A).Figure 4Effect of ATP on the trypsinolysis of EF-3 (panel A) and its intrinsic fluorescence (panel B).

However, the inactivation kinetics were different for these two functions (seeinsets in Fig. 2). The ribosome-stimulated ATPase activity was destroyed quantitatively within 10 min of the reaction (Fig.2 B). The digested products retained about 10% of the intrinsic ATPase activity (Fig. 2 A). Neither the intact EF-3 nor fragment A was visible at this time point (Fig. 1, lane 5). We attribute the 10% residual intrinsic ATPase activity to fragment B1. Further studies with the isolated peptides will be necessary to confirm the hydrolytic activity of the truncated fragment. The loss of more than 90% of the ribosome-stimulated function of EF-3 within the first few minutes of tryptic digestion (Fig. 2 B) strongly suggests that the initial cleavage that generated fragments A and B1 destroyed the primary ribosome binding site of the protein. This conclusion is in agreement with our previously published data (12.Kambampati R. Chakraburtty K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6377-6381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In an attempt to analyze the effects of substrate binding on the domain structure of EF-3, tryptic digestions were carried out in the presence of 80S ribosomes, ATP, polynucleotides, rRNA, and tRNA (Figs.Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6). Data presented in Fig. 3 show the trypsinolysis of EF-3 in the presence and absence of ribosomes. These experiments were conducted exactly as reported in our previous publication (12.Kambampati R. Chakraburtty K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6377-6381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) except in the present studies, the reactions were at 30 °C instead of 0 °C. The tryptic fragments of EF-3 were visualized by Western blotting to avoid interference by the ribosomal proteins. A comparative analysis of the immunoblot data presented in Fig. 3 with the Coomassie-stained gel in Fig. 1 revealed some interesting differences. First of all, EF-3 was relatively more resistant to trypsinolysis in the presence of the ribosome even with 10-fold excess of enzyme (the ratio of EF-3 to trypsin was 12.5:1 instead of 125:1). This amount of trypsin was shown to have minimal effect on the structure and the conformation of the ribosome (12.Kambampati R. Chakraburtty K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6377-6381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 21.Gudkov A.T. Bubunenko M.G. Biochimie (Paris). 1989; 71: 779-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Peptides B1 and C1 were also protected from trypsinolysis as evidenced by the accumulation of these two fragments in the presence of the ribosome (Fig. 3). the protective effect of the ribosome on the carboxyl-terminally derived C1 peptide was reported in our earlier paper (12.Kambampati R. Chakraburtty K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6377-6381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The relative stability of the 70-kDa peptide from trypsin implicates the existence of a possible second ribosome binding site distinct from that identified near the carboxyl-terminal end (12.Kambampati R. Chakraburtty K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6377-6381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).Figure 3Time course of trypsinolysis of EF-3 in the presence or absence of yeast ribosomes. EF-3 was preincubated with yeast ribosomes in the molar ratio of 1:2 at 30 °C for 10 min in buffer A. The reaction mixtures were treated with TPCK-trypsin at 30 °C at an EF-3/ trypsin (w/w) ratio of 12.5:1. Aliquots were taken at different time intervals, and the digestions were stopped by the addition of soybean trypsin inhibitor. The tryptic products were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Western blotting. Lanes 1–7 represent digestions for 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, and 60 min, respectively.

(20.Gontarek R.R. Li H. Nurse K. Prescott C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10249-10252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Alternatively, ribosomes may cause sufficient alterations in the EF-3 conformation, thus protecting the previously exposed trypsin-sensitive bonds. Reports in the literature support this hypothesis (21.Gudkov A.T. Bubunenko M.G. Biochimie (Paris). 1989; 71: 779-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Experiments are currently in progress to differentiate between these possibilities. EF-3 interacts with ATP, tRNA, rRNA, and various synthetic oligonucleotides (15.Kovalchuke O. Chakraburtty K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 133-140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Kambampati R. Chakraburtty K. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 10: 209-213Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 20.Gontarek R.R. Li H.

Chem. 1989; 264: 15423-15428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Data presented in Fig.4 A demonstrate the effect of ATP on the trypsinolysis and on the intrinsic fluorescence of EF-3. Comparative analysis of the rate of proteolysis of EF-3 in the absence and presence of ATP clearly demonstrates the protective effect of ATP on EF-3. The nucleotide also protected the A and B1peptides. A doublet band, designated as B2 peptide, appeared with an electrophoretic mobility similar to that of B1 peptide (Fig. 4 A, lane 3). The 90-kDa A peptide was generated by cleavage of the most trypsin-sensitive bond in EF-3 within NBSII (12.Kambampati R. Chakraburtty K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6377-6381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This cleavage site was protected by ATP. A new trypsin-sensitive bond in NBSI was exposed in the presence of ATP, which resulted in the formation of fragment B2 (for the amino acid sequence, see Fig. 7). Similar results were reported by Miyazaki et al. (13.Miyazaki M. Uritani M. Kagiyama H. J. Biochem. 1988; 104: 445-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) for EF-3 and by Yike et al. (22.Yike I. Ye J. Zhang Y. Manavalan P. Gerken T.A. Dearborn D.G. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein CFTR. These results strongly suggest a change in the conformation of EF-3 upon ATP binding. However, there was no significant change in the intrinsic fluorescence of the protein in the presence of ATP (Fig. 4 B). We conclude that ATP changed the conformation of EF-3 around its binding sites without causing a global change in the overall conformation of the protein. ATP showed no protective effect on the carboxyl-terminally derived C1, C2, and C3 peptides. It will be of interest to investigate the role of ATP in the activation of the ribosome-stimulated hydrolytic function of EF-3 similar to that observed for the GTP-binding proteins EF-1α (EF-Tu) and EF-2 (EF-G) (26.Kaziro Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 505: 95-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). The functional dependence of the yeast ribosomes on EF-3 strongly suggests that the protein may interact directly with rRNA. In the present studies, we investigated the effect of synthetic oligonucleotides and ribosomal RNA on the proteolytic cleavage pattern and on the intrinsic fluorescence of EF-3. Of the three homopolynucleotides tested, only poly(G) showed the most significant effect. The effect was visible when the trypsinolysis was carried out at 30 °C and also at 0 °C (Fig. 5,A and B). In the presence of poly(G), no detectable amount of the full-length EF-3 or fragment A was visible at the end of the 10-min digestion time (Fig. 5 A). The cleavage pattern in the absence of oligonucleotides was very similar to those with poly(U) and poly(C). Fragment C (50 kDa) was formed only when EF-3 was digested at 30 °C (Fig. 5 A, EF-3 alone). However, in the presence of poly(G), fragment C was formed even when the reactions were carried out at 0 °C (Fig. 5 B, + poly(G)). The binding studies as measured by fluorescence quenching (Fig.5 C, filled circles) reflected a similar effect of poly(G). We reported previously a high affinity binding of EF-3 to a guanosine-rich sequence in RNA (23.Kovalchuke O. Chakraburtty K. FASEB J. 1994; 8 (abstr.): 1307Google Scholar, 24.Kovalchuke O. Chakraburtty K. Indian J. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 32: 336-342PubMed Google Scholar). An altered proteolytic cleavage pattern and fluorescence quenching by poly(G) suggest a possible conformation change of the protein upon binding to a guanosine-rich sequence in rRNA. However, neither 18S nor 26S rRNA separately or as a mixture showed any detectable effect on the proteolysis of EF-3 (data not shown). The primary function of EF-3 is to remove deacylated tRNA from the ribosomal exit site (E-site) and stimulate binding of the ternary complex to the A-site (6.Triana-Alonso F.J. Chakraburtty K. Nierhaus K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20473-20478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 25.Kamath A. Chakraburtty K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15423-15428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The deduced amino acid sequence of EF-3 revealed the presence of a putative aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase sequence motif (10.Belfield G.P. Ross-Smith N.J. Tuite M.F. J. Mol. Evol. 1995; 41: 376-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Based on this information, we examined for a possible interaction between EF-3 and tRNA by gel mobility shift assays. Data presented in Fig. 6 Ademonstrate that indeed, the mobility of tRNA was retarded upon interaction with EF-3 (lanes 2–6). A nonspecific protein, bovine serum albumin, had no effect (lane 7). It should be noted that the complex was not detected when electrophoresis was continued for longer than 10–15 min. The disappearance of the EF-3·tRNA complex does not represent degradation of either tRNA or the protein because these macromolecules remained intact at the end of the experiment (data not shown). However, tRNA did not change the tryptic cleavage pattern of the protein (Fig. 6 C). The labile nature of the EF-3·tRNA complex and the inability of tRNA to protect it from proteolysis may be a reflection of a weak interaction between these two macromolecules. To analyze further the domain structure of EF-3, several of the tryptic fragments were sequenced by mass spectrometry. Coomassie-stained bands from the gel (Fig. 1) were excised and subjected to complete tryptic digestion. The peptides were sequenced using a mass spectrometer as described under “Materials and Methods.” The peptides identified in each fragment are listed in Tables Table I, Table II, Table III.Table IIIPeptides confirmed in the 15-kDa EF-3 fragmentPeptides843GELVESHSK851860EALASGQFRPLTR872958NLTEEVWAVKDGR970 Open table in a new tab Table IPeptides confirmed in the 70-kDa EF-3 fragmentPeptides2SDSQQSIK910VLEELFQK1718LSVATADNR2627HEIASEVASFLNGNIIEHDVPEHFFGELAK5663TAANAMQAVAHIANQSNLSPSVEPYIVQLVPAICTNAGNK102105EIQSVASETLISIVNAVNPVAIK127128ALLPHLTNAIVETNK142143WQEK146147IAILAAFSAMVDAAK161162DQVALR167168MPELIPVLSETMWDTK183188AAATAAMTK196197ATETVDNKDIER208209FIPSLIQCIADPTEVPETVHLLGATTFVAEVTPATLSIMVPLLSR253254GLNER258259ETGIK263266SAVIIDNMCK275276LVEDPQVIAPFLGK289290LLPGLK295296SNFATIADPEAR307308EVTLR312313ALKTLR318320VGNVGEDDAIPELSHAGDVSTTLQVVNELLK350351DETVAPR357360IVVEYIAAIGADLIDER376377IIDQQAWFTHITPYMTIFLHEK398400AKDILDEFR408410RAVDNIPVGPNFDDEEDEGEDLCNCEFSLAYGAK443444ILLNK448449TQLR452552LALAR556623GNFTEFVK630637AYEELSNTDLEFK649650FPEPGYLEGVK660 Open table in a new tab As noted in the earlier section, trypsinolysis of EF-3 at 0 °C resulted in the cleavage of a single peptide bond generating a large 90-kDa fragment (N peptide) and a small 30-kDa fragment (C1 peptide). The N peptide is equivalent to fragment A described in the current studies (Fig. 1). The C1 peptide originated from the carboxyl-terminal end and contains the amino acid residues Gln775-Phe1044 (12.Kambampati R. Chakraburtty K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6377-6381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Attempts to sequence fragments A, B1, and C were unsuccessful because all three were amino-terminally blocked. We conclude that these fragments are from the NH2-terminal end. The 90-kDa fragment contains residues Ser2-Arg774. This domain of EF-3 was stable to further proteolysis at 0 °C and retained the intrinsic ATPase activity (12.Kambampati R. Chakraburtty K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6377-6381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that proteolysis at 30 °C exposed additional trypsin-sensitive bonds in the 90-kDa domain, resulting in the formation of a stable 50-kDa fragment through the intermediate formation of the 70-kDa fragment (Fig. 1). Data presented in Table I show the bulk of the peptides identified in the 70-kDa fragment. Tandem mass spectrometry sequencing confirmed the presence of an NH2-terminally blocked octapeptide (2SDSQQSIK9) containing an acetylated serine. Analysis of the total tryptic digest of the 70-kDa fragment identified the presence of the peptide Phe650-Lys660, but peptides Val669-Arg696 and Ile697-Lys707 were absent. Peptides Thr661-Lys662 and Gln663-Lys664 were too small for the detection by LCQ mass spectrometric analysis. We failed to identify the peptide Ala665-Lys668 (430 Da) in the total digest of the full-length EF-3 and also in the 70-kDa fragment. This peptide may or may not be present in the 70-kDa fragment. Based on these analyses, we concluded that the 70-kDa fragment of EF-3 began at residue 2 and ended somewhere between the residues 660 and 668 (Fig.7). The 70-kDa fragment contains one complete nucleotide-binding cassette (NBSI). ATP protected this fragment from further degradation (Fig. 4). We hypothesize that the 70-kDa fragment forms the core ATP binding subdomain within the NH2-terminally derived 90-kDa domain. The 50-kDa fragment gave a mass of 48.4 kDa in the LCQ mass spectrometer (data not shown). The last peptide confirmed in the total tryptic digest of the 50 kDa fragment was Ala411-Lys443. Peptide Ile444-Lys448 and those COOH-terminal to this peptide were absent in the 50-kDa fragment. Thus, the 50-kDa fragment spans from Ser2 to Lys443. The calculated molecular mass of 48.38 kDa is in good agreement with the size of this fragment. Tables II and III list the identified peptides in the COOH-terminally derived 21- and 15-kDa fragments. Peptides Glu767-Arg771, Gln775-Lys786, Ile787-Lys789, and Met971-Arg987 were absent in the total tryptic digest of the 21-kDa fragment. The first and the last identified peptides were Ile790-Arg795 and Asn958-Lys967, respectively (TableII). Thus, the 21-kDa fragment spans from residue 790 through 967/970. The 15-kDa fragment starts at residue 843 and ends at 970 (Table III). The most trypsin-sensitive cleavage sites of EF-3 are indicated byvertical arrows in Fig. 7.Table IIPeptides confirmed in the 21-kDa EF-3 fragmentPeptides790IEGTPR795797IAGIHSR803843GELVESHSK851860EALASGQFRPLTR872905LVLAAGTWQRPHLIVLDEPTNYLDRDSLGALSK937958NLTEEVWAVK967 Open table in a new tab EF-3 contains 126 possible trypsin cleavage sites. Only a few of these sites were accessible to trypsin under the experimental conditions used in the current studies. Results presented in this paper and elsewhere (12.Kambampati R. Chakraburtty K. J.

Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2595-2601Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) strongly suggest the existence of at least two organized functional domains in EF-3. The protein also contains two trypsin-resistant cores (B1 and C) near the NH2-terminal end. Our results demonstrate that the lysine and arginine residues in NBSI (residues 463–575) are relatively inaccessible to trypsin compared with those in NBSII (residues 701–928). The most trypsin-sensitive bond of EF-3 (Arg774-Gln775) is located within NBSII (between the purine binding sequence and the phosphate binding loop, see Fig. 7). The sequence around this cleavage site is exposed and may function as a hinge between the stable amino-terminal domain and the flexible carboxyl-terminal domain. The phosphate binding loop of the second nucleotide binding domain along with the putative aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase homology region (residues 820–865) and the positively charged polylysine blocks (residues 1009–1031) form a loosely structured carboxyl-terminal domain that contains the primary ribosome binding site of the protein (12.Kambampati R. Chakraburtty K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6377-6381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The protective effect of yeast ribosomes on the trypsinolysis of EF-3 suggests that the cleavage sites Arg842, Arg970, and the lysine residues located near the carboxyl-terminal end are protected by the ribosome. Fragment C (residues 2–443) is extremely resistant to trypsin (12.Kambampati R. Chakraburtty K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6377-6381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 14.Ladror U.S. Egan D.A. Snyder S.W. Capobianco J.O. Goldman R.C. Dorwin S.A. Johnson R.W. Edalji R.

The functional significance of this stable domain near the NH2-terminal end of EF-3 remains undefined. Yeast strains expressing the truncated form of EF-3 (lacking Glu12-Ala411) were shown to be nonviable (27.Masahiro U. Atsushi T. Kazutoshi N. Miho I. Makoto I. Mikio A. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1996; 39: 227-234PubMed Google Scholar). 2U. Masahiro, T. Atsushi, N. Kazutoshi, I. Miho, I. Makoto, and A. Mikio, unpublished data. Further work with the purified EF-3 fragments is needed to fully understand the structural organization of EF-3. Attempts to crystallize the full-length protein were unsuccessful (Kambampati & Chakraburtty, unpublished data). The loosely structured carboxyl-terminal end may have interfered the crystal formation. With the identification of several functional subdomains, it should be feasible to determine the structures of the individual domains by x-ray crystallography."

This study was performed to elucidate the reason why 20K-hGH can activate hGHR to the same level as 22K-hGH. To answer the question, we hypothesized that the binding between the stem regions of hGHR could compensate for the weaker site 1 binding of 20K-hGH than that of 22K-hGH in the sequential binding with hGHR. To demonstrate it, we prepared 15 types of alanine-substituted hGHR gene at the stem region and stably transfected them into Ba/F3 cells. Using these cells, we measured and compared the cell proliferation activities between 20K- and 22K-hGH. As a result, the activity of 20K-hGH was markedly reduced than that of 22K-hGH in three types of mutant hGHR (T147A, H150A, and Y200A). Regarding these mutants, the dissociation constant of hGH at the first and second step (KD1 and KD2) in the sequential binding with two hGHRs was predicted based on the mathematical cell proliferation model and computational simulation. Consequently, it was revealed that the reduction of the activity in 20K-hGH was attributed to the change of not KD1 but KD2. In conclusion, these findings support our hypothesis, which can account for the same potencies for activating hGHR between 20K- and 22K-hGH, although the site 1 affinity of 20K-hGH is lower than that of 22K-hGH.

Fig. 1 shows the schematic illustration of the mode of receptor dimerization of both hGH isoforms. Here we tentatively designate the stem region of hGHR, which is considered to be involved in receptor dimerization, “siteBP.” Concerning the binding affinity between hGH and hGHR, we reported that KD1(22K) was smaller than KD1(20K) in the biosensor analysis (9.Uchida H. Banba S. Wada M. Matsumoto K. Ikeda M. Naito N. Tanaka E. Honjo M. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 23: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and that KDsite2(20K) was considered to be almost the same as KDsite2(22K), because the site 2 region of 20K-hGH was conformationally similar to 22K-hGH (11.Wada M. Uchida H. Ikeda M. Tsunekawa B. Naito N. Banba S. Tanaka E. Hashimoto Y. Honjo M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 146-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the activity of 20K-hGH via hGHR is the same as that of 22K-hGH at low hGH concentration and even higher at high hGH concentration in cell proliferation assay (11.Wada M. Uchida H. Ikeda M. Tsunekawa B. Naito N. Banba S. Tanaka E. Hashimoto Y. Honjo M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 146-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that binding of 20K-hGH to the first hGHR could result in the transient 1:1 complex, which has a more favorable conformation for forming an active 1:2 complex especially at the siteBP region of hGHR.In this study, to elucidate the difference of siteBP contribution to the 1:2 complex formation with hGHR between 20K- and 22K-hGH, we made an hGHR expression plasmid with conversion of several amino acids at the siteBP region to alanine. Using mouse pro B cell line (Ba/F3) stably expressing the mutant or wild type hGHR, cell proliferation assay of both hGH isoforms was performed. As a result, in three mutants (T147A, H150A, and Y200A), 20K-hGH had markedly reduced activity than 22K-hGH. In addition, we estimated KD1 and KD2 of both hGH isoforms by theoretically simulating the cell proliferation curve, and it was highly speculated that alanine substitution at siteBP could mainly affect the affinity of 20K-hGH at STEP2 (KD2(20K)). By lacking 15 amino acids, 20K-hGH partly lost the site 1 affinity but the binding between siteBPs possibly compensates for the loss.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have revealed that alanine substitution at Thr-147, Ile-149, His-150, and Tyr-200 in the siteBP region of hGHR reduced the cell proliferation activity of 20K-hGH as compared with that of 22K-hGH. The involvement of the siteBP region in the complex formation of 22K-hGH and hGHR has been studied by several groups. DeVoset al. (13.DeVos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2016) Google Scholar) first reported that there was a substantial contact surface between the C-terminal domains of hGHR-ECD, namely siteBP regions, when 22K-hGH formed a 1:2 complex with hGHR-ECD. Crystallographic study showed the eight residues (Asn-143, Ser-145, Leu-146, Thr-147, His-150, Asp-152, Tyr-200, and Ser-201) were involved in this domain. Furthermore, Clackson et al. (24.Clackson T. Ultsch M.H. Wells J.A. DeVos A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 1111-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) showed that hGHR dimerization stabilized loop structure from Val-144 to Gly-148 at siteBP region. Chen et al. (25.Chen C. Brinkworth R. Waters M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5133-5140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) converted several amino acids at siteBP of rabbit GHR to alanine, aspartate, lysine, or cysteine and presented that residues Ser-145, His-150, Asp-152, Tyr-200, and Ser-201 were required for effective signal transduction through the dimerization domain. These previous studies are well consistent with our finding except for Ile-149, because the involvement of Ile-149 in siteBP interaction has been demonstrated for the first time in this study.In patients with Laron syndrome (familial GH resistance characterized by severe dwarfism and metabolic dysfunction), a point mutation in the siteBP region was identified resulting in the substitution of a highly conserved aspartate residue by histidine at position 152 (D152H) of hGHR (26.Duquesnoy P. Sobrier M.L. Duriez B. Dastot F. Buchanan C.R. Savage M.O. Preece M.A. Craescu C.T. Blouquit Y. Goossens M. Amselem S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1386-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Duquesnoy et al. (26.Duquesnoy P. Sobrier M.L. Duriez B. Dastot F. Buchanan C.R. Savage M.O. Preece M.A. Craescu C.T. Blouquit Y. Goossens M. Amselem S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1386-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) reported that the hGHR with mutation D152H displayed subnormal GH binding activity but hGHR-ECD with D152H substitution was unable to dimerize. In this report, not only 22K-hGH but also 20K-GH had no cell proliferation activity in mutation D152A nor D152H (data not shown). These results mean that Asp-152 in hGHR plays a quite important role in the binding between siteBP regions.Especially, the mutation T147A, H150A, and Y200A of hGHR resulted in a drastic decrease of cell proliferation activity of 20K-hGH compared with that of 22K-hGH. Similar results were observed also in the rat serine protease inhibitor 2.1 gene promoter activation assay in CHO-K1 cells transiently expressing each three mutants (data not shown). These data indicate that Thr-147, His-150, and Tyr-200 considerably contribute to the same hGHR-mediated activity of 20K-hGH as 22K-hGH regardless of its reduced site 1 affinity. To clarify the mechanism of how Thr-147, His-150, and Tyr-200 enable 20K-hGH to form an active 1:2 complex to the same degree as 22K-hGH, we are now under investigation of the x-ray crystal structure of the complex of 20K-hGH and hGHR-ECD.To elucidate the binding affinity at STEP1 and STEP2 resulting from alanine substitution, we estimated the dissociation constant KD1 and KD2 of 20K- and 22K-hGH by modeling the cell proliferation curve mathematically. By fitting the calculative proliferation curve to the experimental data of the wild type hGHR, KD1(20K) and KD1(22K) were predicted to be 13 and 5.1 nm, respectively, and the binding affinity of 20K-hGH at site 1 was weaker than that of 22K-hGH. These estimates are reasonable compared with the results experimentally obtained by biosensor analysis using hGHR-ECD, where KD1(20K) (16 nm) is lager than KD1(22K) (2 nm) (9.Uchida H. Banba S. Wada M. Matsumoto K. Ikeda M. Naito N. Tanaka E. Honjo M. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 23: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).Concerning the mutation T147A, H150A, and Y200A, KD2(20K) increased 10-, 122-, and 68-fold, respectively, compared with KD2(22K) (1.8-, 17-, and 5.3-fold). Generally alanine substitution is minimally perturbing for the secondary and tertiary structure, and three alanine mutations are located only at the siteBP region of hGHR. Therefore, mutations T147A, H150A, and Y200A are considered to have no direct influence on the contact surface structure between the site 2 region on hGH and the second hGHR in sequential binding, that is, the binding affinity KDsite2(20K) in Fig. 1. This suggests that the drastic change of KD2(20K) results from the change of KDsiteBP(20K).In our calculation, the change of hGH bioactivity was in good concordance with the change of the binding affinity (KD2(20K)). However, Rowlinson et al. (27.Rowlinson S.W. Barnard R. Bastiras S. Robins A.J. Brinkworth R. Waters M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16833-16839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) reported that GH with mutation at site 1 markedly lost its bioactivity without loss of site 1 binding affinity. Recently, Pearce et al. (23.Pearce Jr., K.H. Cunningham B.C. Fuh G. Teeri T. Wells J.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) reported that the EC50 of cell proliferation via wild type hGHR was unaffected until site 1 affinity of 22K-hGH was reduced about 30-fold from that of wild type 22K-hGH. Under the condition used in our sequential binding and cell proliferation model, it is predicted that an ∼30-fold reduction in site 1 affinity should yield about 30-fold higher EC50 for cell proliferation, which means the experimental data of Pearce et al. (23.Pearce Jr., K.H. Cunningham B.C. Fuh G. Teeri T. Wells J.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) cannot be simulated by our model. Unfortunately, at present we cannot explain such disagreement, and some modifications might be necessary for more accurate simulation by adding some new parameters to the sequential binding model or the cell proliferation model or by altering some prerequisites.In conclusion, we have shown that some alanine substitutions at the siteBP region of hGHR caused the markedly decreased activity of 20K-hGH compared with 22K-hGH. This means the siteBP region is involved in 1:2 complex formation in a different manner between 20K- and 22K-hGH, and the binding between the siteBP regions compensates for the weaker site 1 binding of 20K-hGH than that of 22K-hGH. The 20-kilodalton (kDa) human GH (20K-hGH)1 is known to be naturally secreted from the pituitary gland besides 22-kDa human GH (22K-hGH), which is a major component composed of 191 amino acids (1.Lewis U.J.

Rev. 1991; 12: 424-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). The 20K-hGH is encoded by the same GH-N gene as 22K-hGH but lacking 15 amino acids (residues 32–46 in 22K-hGH) by an alternative messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing (3.DeNoto F.M. Moore D.D. Goodman H.M.

Because of the difficulty in preparing large enough amounts of highly purified 20K-hGH with authentic structure, its biological properties were unclear and controversial. Recently, we established an Escherichia coli secretion system for 20K-hGH with an authentic structure (6.Uchida H. Naito N. Asada N. Wada M. Ikeda M. Kobayashi H. Asanagi M. Mori K. Fujita Y.

On the other hand, the activity of 20K-hGH via hGHR is the same as that of 22K-hGH at low hGH concentration and even higher at high hGH concentration in cell proliferation assay (11.Wada M. Uchida H.

Unfortunately, at present we cannot explain such disagreement, and some modifications might be necessary for more accurate simulation by adding some new parameters to the sequential binding model or the cell proliferation model or by altering some prerequisites.In conclusion, we have shown that some alanine substitutions at the siteBP region of hGHR caused the markedly decreased activity of 20K-hGH compared with 22K-hGH. This means the siteBP region is involved in 1:2 complex formation in a different manner between 20K- and 22K-hGH, and the binding between the siteBP regions compensates for the weaker site 1 binding of 20K-hGH than that of 22K-hGH. In this study, we have revealed that alanine substitution at Thr-147, Ile-149, His-150, and Tyr-200 in the siteBP region of hGHR reduced the cell proliferation activity of 20K-hGH as compared with that of 22K-hGH. The involvement of the siteBP region in the complex formation of 22K-hGH and hGHR has been studied by several groups. DeVoset al. (13.DeVos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2016) Google Scholar) first reported that there was a substantial contact surface between the C-terminal domains of hGHR-ECD, namely siteBP regions, when 22K-hGH formed a 1:2 complex with hGHR-ECD. Crystallographic study showed the eight residues (Asn-143, Ser-145, Leu-146, Thr-147, His-150, Asp-152, Tyr-200, and Ser-201) were involved in this domain. Furthermore, Clackson et al. (24.Clackson T. Ultsch M.H. Wells J.A. DeVos A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 1111-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) showed that hGHR dimerization stabilized loop structure from Val-144 to Gly-148 at siteBP region. Chen et al. (25.Chen C. Brinkworth R. Waters M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5133-5140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) converted several amino acids at siteBP of rabbit GHR to alanine, aspartate, lysine, or cysteine and presented that residues Ser-145, His-150, Asp-152, Tyr-200, and Ser-201 were required for effective signal transduction through the dimerization domain. These previous studies are well consistent with our finding except for Ile-149, because the involvement of Ile-149 in siteBP interaction has been demonstrated for the first time in this study. In patients with Laron syndrome (familial GH resistance characterized by severe dwarfism and metabolic dysfunction), a point mutation in the siteBP region was identified resulting in the substitution of a highly conserved aspartate residue by histidine at position 152 (D152H) of hGHR (26.Duquesnoy P. Sobrier M.L. Duriez B. Dastot F. Buchanan C.R. Savage M.O. Preece M.A. Craescu C.T. Blouquit Y. Goossens M. Amselem S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1386-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Duquesnoy et al. (26.Duquesnoy P. Sobrier M.L. Duriez B. Dastot F. Buchanan C.R. Savage M.O. Preece M.A. Craescu C.T. Blouquit Y. Goossens M. Amselem S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1386-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) reported that the hGHR with mutation D152H displayed subnormal GH binding activity but hGHR-ECD with D152H substitution was unable to dimerize. In this report, not only 22K-hGH but also 20K-GH had no cell proliferation activity in mutation D152A nor D152H (data not shown). These results mean that Asp-152 in hGHR plays a quite important role in the binding between siteBP regions. Especially, the mutation T147A, H150A, and Y200A of hGHR resulted in a drastic decrease of cell proliferation activity of 20K-hGH compared with that of 22K-hGH. Similar results were observed also in the rat serine protease inhibitor 2.1 gene promoter activation assay in CHO-K1 cells transiently expressing each three mutants (data not shown). These data indicate that Thr-147, His-150, and Tyr-200 considerably contribute to the same hGHR-mediated activity of 20K-hGH as 22K-hGH regardless of its reduced site 1 affinity. To clarify the mechanism of how Thr-147, His-150, and Tyr-200 enable 20K-hGH to form an active 1:2 complex to the same degree as 22K-hGH, we are now under investigation of the x-ray crystal structure of the complex of 20K-hGH and hGHR-ECD. To elucidate the binding affinity at STEP1 and STEP2 resulting from alanine substitution, we estimated the dissociation constant KD1 and KD2 of 20K- and 22K-hGH by modeling the cell proliferation curve mathematically. By fitting the calculative proliferation curve to the experimental data of the wild type hGHR, KD1(20K) and KD1(22K) were predicted to be 13 and 5.1 nm, respectively, and the binding affinity of 20K-hGH at site 1 was weaker than that of 22K-hGH. These estimates are reasonable compared with the results experimentally obtained by biosensor analysis using hGHR-ECD, where KD1(20K) (16 nm) is lager than KD1(22K) (2 nm) (9.Uchida H. Banba S. Wada M. Matsumoto K. Ikeda M. Naito N. Tanaka E. Honjo M. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 23: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Concerning the mutation T147A, H150A, and Y200A, KD2(20K) increased 10-, 122-, and 68-fold, respectively, compared with KD2(22K) (1.8-, 17-, and 5.3-fold). Generally alanine substitution is minimally perturbing for the secondary and tertiary structure, and three alanine mutations are located only at the siteBP region of hGHR. Therefore, mutations T147A, H150A, and Y200A are considered to have no direct influence on the contact surface structure between the site 2 region on hGH and the second hGHR in sequential binding, that is, the binding affinity KDsite2(20K) in Fig. 1. This suggests that the drastic change of KD2(20K) results from the change of KDsiteBP(20K). In our calculation, the change of hGH bioactivity was in good concordance with the change of the binding affinity (KD2(20K)). However, Rowlinson et al. (27.Rowlinson S.W. Barnard R. Bastiras S. Robins A.J. Brinkworth R. Waters M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16833-16839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) reported that GH with mutation at site 1 markedly lost its bioactivity without loss of site 1 binding affinity. Recently, Pearce et al. (23.Pearce Jr., K.H. Cunningham B.C. Fuh G. Teeri T. Wells J.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) reported that the EC50 of cell proliferation via wild type hGHR was unaffected until site 1 affinity of 22K-hGH was reduced about 30-fold from that of wild type 22K-hGH. Under the condition used in our sequential binding and cell proliferation model, it is predicted that an ∼30-fold reduction in site 1 affinity should yield about 30-fold higher EC50 for cell proliferation, which means the experimental data of Pearce et al. (23.Pearce Jr., K.H. Cunningham B.C. Fuh G. Teeri T. Wells J.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) cannot be simulated by our model. Unfortunately, at present we cannot explain such disagreement, and some modifications might be necessary for more accurate simulation by adding some new parameters to the sequential binding model or the cell proliferation model or by altering some prerequisites. In conclusion, we have shown that some alanine substitutions at the siteBP region of hGHR caused the markedly decreased activity of 20K-hGH compared with 22K-hGH. This means the siteBP region is involved in 1:2 complex formation in a different manner between 20K- and 22K-hGH, and the binding between the siteBP regions compensates for the weaker site 1 binding of 20K-hGH than that of 22K-hGH.

A particularly well studied example of the latter group of genes is the G2-specificcdc25C promoter (5.Lucibello F.C. Truss M. Zwicker J. Ehlert F. Beato M. Müller R.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4933-4939Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), which contains three functionally important NF-Y binding sites. Genomic DMS footprinting and functional promoter analyses demonstrate that NF-Y binding to the core and flanking regions of NF-Y sites is necessary for both maximal promoter activity and cell cycle regulation (6.Zwicker J. Gross C. Lucibello F.C. Truss M. Ehlert F. Engeland K. Müller R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3822-3830Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The cdc25C promoter is regulated in G0/G1 phase by the transcriptional repressor CDF-1, which binds the CDE-CHR bipartite DNA element (9.Liu N. Lucibello F.C. Körner K. Wolfraim L.A. Zwicker J. Müller R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4915-4920Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), thereby blocking the function of the NF-Y and Sp1-Sp3 complexes bound immediately upstream of the CDE-CHR element (6.Zwicker J. Gross C. Lucibello F.C. Truss M. Ehlert F. Engeland K. Müller R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3822-3830Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Upon entry into S/G2 the interaction of CDF-1 to its cognate binding site is abrogated, thus allowing for NF-Y- and Sp1-Sp3-mediated transcriptional activation of the cdc25C gene (5.Lucibello F.C. Truss M. Zwicker J. Ehlert F. Beato M. Müller R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 132-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 6.Zwicker J. Gross C. Lucibello F.C. Truss M. Ehlert F. Engeland K. Müller R.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4915-4920Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). A similar situation exists with the cyclin A promoter, which is also repressed by CDF-1 and activated by NF-Y (7.Zwicker J. Lucibello F.C. Wolfraim L.A. Gross C. Truss M. Engeland K. Müller R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4514-4522Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The mechanism through which NF-Y activates transcription is not fully understood. However, NF-Y has been reported to interact with the histone acetylases Gcn5 and P/CAF (11.Currie R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1430-1434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), and these interactions seem to be relevant in the context of the multiple drug resistance-1 gene promoter (12.Jin S. Scotto K.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4377-4388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown that NF-Y is capable of associating with nucleosomal templates in vitro (13.Caretti G. Motta M.C. Mantovani R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8591-8603Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), although the in vivo relevance of this observation remains to be investigated. These observations imply a role for NF-Y in chromatin remodeling and may provide an explanation for the ability of DNA-bound NF-Y to recruit other transcription factors to promoter DNA (14.Wright K.L. Vilen B.J. Itoh-Lindstrom Y. Moore T.L. Li G. Criscitiello M. Cogswell P. Clarke J.B. Ting J.P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4042-4053Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 15.Linhoff M.W. Wright K.L. Ting J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4589-4596Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). NF-Y binds to both the major and minor groove of the DNA and has been reported to induce DNA bending in vitro (16.Ronchi A. Bellorini M. Mongelli N. Mantovani R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4565-4572Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This is believed to be important for the functional organization of activated promoters in vivo, as in the case of the γ-globin promoter (17.Liberati C. Ronchi A. Lievens P. Ottolenghi S. Mantovani R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16880-16889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, there is no evidence that NF-Y binding to promoter DNA is indeed associated with structural distortions in vivo. In the present study, we have used a combination of different genomic footprinting techniques to analyze in detail the in vivostructure of the cdc25C promoter, in particular with respect to its nucleosomal organization and transcription factor-associated structural distortions. WI-38 cells were cultured in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and MCDB 135 medium with 10% fetal calf serum. For synchronization in G0, cells were maintained in serum-free medium for 3 days. For DMS footprinting, WI-38 cells were grown to 70% confluency. After treatment with 0.2% DMS for 2 min, the cells were washed 3 times with cold phosphate-buffered saline and the DNA was isolated with DNAzol (Life Technologies, Inc.). For potassium permanganate (KMnO4) treatment, the cells were incubated with 20 mm KMnO4 for 2 min and were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% β-mercaptoethanol and once with phosphate-buffered saline. For DNase I,Micrococcus nuclease, MPE, and OP-Cu footprinting, the cells were scraped into phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in DNase I digestion buffer (60 mm KCl, 15 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 msucrose) containing 0.2% Nonidet P-40 (for permeabilization of cells). For Micrococcus nuclease and MPE cleavage, the scraped cells were homogenized on ice with 10 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer.Micrococcus nuclease treatment was performed with 0.05–1 unit of enzyme for 3 min. For DNase I cleavage, 200–400 units of enzyme (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were added, and the reactions were stopped after 5 min by addition of 0.2 volume of 62.5 mm EDTA and 2.5% SDS. MPE treatment was performed as described previously (18.Cartwright M.I.L. Herzberg R.P. Dervan P.B. Elgin S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3213-3217Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). For OP-Cu treatment, a complex formed from 40 μm 1,10-phenanthroline and 10 μmCuSO4 (final concentrations) was added to the cell suspension, and the reaction was started by the addition of 3-mercaptopropionic acid to a concentration of 6.9 mm. After 2–4 min, the reaction was stopped by addition of 2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline to a final concentration of 2.8 mm. For comparison, WI-38 genomic DNA was methylatedin vitro with 0.2% DMS for 10–30 s, treated with 2 mm KMnO4 for 30 s, and cleaved with 0.05–0.1 unit of Micrococcus nuclease or 2–4 units of DNase I for 30 s or treated with OP-Cu for 60–75 s. In each case, 3 μg of piperidine-cleaved genomic DNA were used for LM-PCR with the Stoffel fragment of Taq polymerase (Perkin-Elmer) as described previously (5.Lucibello F.C. Truss M. Zwicker J. Ehlert F. Beato M. Müller R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 132-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). For OP-Cu and Micrococcus nuclease treatment, the DNA was phosphorylated with T4-polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs Inc.) prior to LM-PCR. Samples were phenol-extracted and ethanol-precipitated after primer extension with32P-labeled primers. The following oligonucleotides were used as primers: cdc25C promoter, primer set TS1: primer 1, 5′-d(AGGGAAAGGAGGTAGTT)-3′; primer 2, 5′-d(TAGATTGCAGCTATGCCTTCCGAC)-3′; primer 3, 5′-d(CCTTCCGACTGGGTAGGCCAACGTCG)-3′; cdc25C promoter, primer set TS2: primer 1, 5′-d(CTGCGTCAGCCAATCTCC)-3′; primer 2, 5′-d(TGGCCTATCGTTGGGCTCGCAG)-3′; primer 3, 5′-d(GGGCTCGCAGATCAC CTGGGGGCG)-3′; cdc25C promoter, primer set BS: primer 1, 5′-d(CACTAGTAAGGCGCGGT)-3′; primer 2, 5′-d(GTTTAAATCTCCCGGGGTTCGTGG)-3′; primer 3, 5′-d(GGGGTTCG TGGGGCTGAGGGAACTAG)-3′; cyclin A promoter: primer 1, 5′-d(AGCCAGGCCAGCCTA)-3′; primer 2, 5′-d(CAGCCCGCCCGCTCGCTCACC)-3′; primer 3, 5′-d(GCT CACCCAGCTCGAGCCACGCAG)-3′. Our first goal was to analyze the nucleosomal structure of the human cdc25Cpromoter between positions −290 and +121 bp that had previously been found to be necessary and sufficient for maximal activity and cell cycle regulation of the promoter (5.Lucibello F.C. Truss M. Zwicker J. Ehlert F. Beato M. Müller R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 132-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Toward this end, WI-38 fibroblasts were permeabilized and digested with increasing concentrations of Micrococcus nuclease, and the digested DNA was analyzed by LM-PCR using different cdc25C-specific primer sets. As shown in Fig. 1,A and B, clusters of Micrococcusnuclease hyperreactivity, which are indicative of nucleosomal linker regions, were seen between positions −140 and approximately −200 bp and between +8 and approximately +50 bp. In addition, less defined hyperreactive regions were identified upstream of position −280 bp (Fig. 1). The distance between the two proximal hyperreactive regions (148 bp) correlates very closely with the reported size of a nucleosomal core in vitro (145 bp) (19.Richmond T.J. Finch J.T. Rushton B. Rhodes D. Klug A. Nature. 1984; 311: 532-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar, 20.Arents G. Burlingame R.W. Wang B.C. Love W.E. Moudrianakis E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10148-10152Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). In agreement with this observation, MPE footprinting of the region between −200 and +50 bp revealed short hypersensitive stretches coincident with the proximal Micrococcus nuclease hyperreactive regions (Fig.2, A and B). These data strongly suggest that the proximal promoter region (−140 to +8 bp), including the transcription factor binding sites necessary for activation and cell cycle specific repression, are organized around a positioned nucleosome (Fig. 3).Figure 2MPE footprinting of the cdc25Cpromoter. Normally growing WI-38 cells were permeabilized, homogenized, and treated with increasing amounts of MPE. For comparison, genomic DNA was treated with MPE or DMS in vitro. The products were analyzed by LM-PCR using primer set TS1. Analysis of the top strand shows short stretches of hyperreactive nucleotides around positions between −150 and −130 bp (A) and between positions +23 and +43 bp (B), respectively, suggesting the presence of a positioned nucleosome in the immediate 5′ region of the cdc25C promoter.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3Overview of the nucleosomal structure of thecdc25C promoter.

Gross C. Lucibello F.C. Truss M. Ehlert F. Engeland K. Müller R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3822-3830Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and by the cell cycle-regulated transcriptional repressor CDF-1 (5.Lucibello F.C. Truss M. Zwicker J. Ehlert F. Beato M. Müller R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 132-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 9.Liu N. Lucibello F.C. Körner K. Wolfraim L.A. Zwicker J. Müller R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4915-4920Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) the question was raised whether the nucleosomal structure might change during the cell cycle. We therefore performed Micrococcus nuclease footprinting of synchronized cell populations, i.e. serum-deprived cellsversus restimulated cells. However, these experiments did not show any cell cycle-related differences with respect to the presence of hyperreactive nucleotides (data not shown). We therefore concluded that the proximal cdc25C promoter region is organized as a positioned nucleosome and is simultaneously occupied by transcription factors throughout the cell cycle. The chromatin structure is not only determined by histone acetylation but can also be influenced by transcription factor-induced remodeling of nucleosomes, similar to the murine mammary tumor virus promoter (21.Truss M. Barsch J.H. Schelbert A. Hache R.J.G. Beato M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1737-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). In this case, the binding of progesterone receptors leads to conformational changes within the regulatory nucleosome, which in turn enables the interaction with other transcription factors and promoter activation (21.Truss M. Barsch J.H. Schelbert A. Hache R.J.G. Beato M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1737-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). To investigate the cdc25C promoter with respect to structural perturbations such as bending or single-stranded stretchesin vivo, we performed genomic footprinting of thecdc25C promoter using different enzymatic or chemical conformation-sensitive probes. As shown in Fig.4 A, DNase I footprinting of permeabilized cells did not result in a characteristic 10-bp pattern, which would be expected for rotationally positioned nucleosomal structures (22.Pfeifer G.P. Riggs A.D. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1102-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Instead, protected areas were detected that coincided with the NF-Y and Sp1 binding sites previously identified with in vivo DMS footprinting (5.Lucibello F.C. Truss M. Zwicker J. Ehlert F. Beato M. Müller R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 132-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In agreement with these findings are the slight DNase I hyperreactivities 5′ and 3′ to the Sp1 sites, which have been reported to occur adjacent to certain transcription factor binding sites in vitro. In addition, the close spacing of the NF-Y and Sp1 binding sites could contribute to the lack of a 10-bp pattern of DNase I hypersensitivity. Particularly strong hyperreactivities were seen between the NF-Y binding sites (Fig.4 A, arrows) suggesting that in these positions the minor groove of the double helix is exposed in a way that allows for a markedly preferred DNase I cleavage. Surprisingly, the DNase I protections at the NF-Y sites were strongly reduced in resting cells (G0) when compared with cycling cells (Fig. 4 A, growing). This is in apparent contrast to previously published in vivoDMS-footprinting data showing that the NF-Y binding sites are occupiedin vivo throughout the cell cycle including G0cells (5.Lucibello F.C. Truss M. Zwicker J. Ehlert F. Beato M. Müller R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 132-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We attribute this to the fact that DNase I footprinting involves the permeabilization of the cells by a detergent, whereas DMS treatment is carried out with intact cells. It is possible that the interaction of NF-Y with its cognate site is weakened in G0cells, e.g. because of a decreased amount of NF-Y-A (23.Chang Z.F. Liu C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17893-17898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,24.Good L.F. Chen K.Y. Biol. Signals. 1996; 5: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), so that under the influence of a detergent this difference becomes detectable. Another finding that deserves particular attention is the fact that decreased protection at the NF-Y sites was associated with a reduction of the surrounding hyperreactivities (Figs. 4 A and5 A). This suggests that a loss of NF-Y binding is correlated with a loss of hyperreactivity in vivo and strongly supports the idea that NF-Y leads to drastic changes in the DNA structure upon binding to its cognate recognition site in vivo. This explanation is supported by similar observations made by OP-Cu footprinting of the cyclin A promoter as described below (see Fig. 5 B). To address the question of whether such structural changes could also be observed in a structurally and functionally related but different promoter, we performed DNase I footprints of the cyclin A gene that contains a single NF-Y site between a CDE-CHR module and an ATF site (Fig. 4 B). Weak hyperreactivities could be detected surrounding the Sp1 site. The lack of hyperreactivities surrounding the NF-Y site may be because of the close proximity of other transcription factor binding sites. In contrast, the occurrence of one strong hyperreactivity within the NF-Y binding site is striking. Thus, in the context of two different promoters, NF-Y binding was associated with strong hyperreactivities (Fig. 4, A and B), suggesting a strong influence on DNA structure. Because NF-Y has been reported to bend DNA in vitro (16.Ronchi A. Bellorini M. Mongelli N. Mantovani R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4565-4572Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), we decided to analyze the proximal promoter region for local distortions by phenanthroline copper footprinting. OP-Cu is used to detect minor groove binding of transcription factors that sterically inhibit access to the C1–H or alter the DNA structure to a non-B-DNA conformation (25.Sigman D.S. Duwabara M.D. Chen C-H.B. Brucie T.W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 381-413Google Scholar, 26.Pope L.E. Sigman D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Both events result in OP-Cu hyporeactive or protected regions. OP-Cu can also be used to detect protein-induced conformational changes in the DNA that would lead to hyperreactive DNA stretches (27.Morris L. Cannon W. Claverie-Martin F. Austin S. Buck M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11563-11571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Even though OP-Cu has previously not been used for genomic footprinting, we were able to establish an appropriate procedure using permeabilized cells (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Thus, minor groove protections at the NF-Y binding sites and the CHR region were clearly detectable, whereas the sites of major groove binding (CDE, Sp1 binding sites) did not show any protections (Fig.5 A). These expected results demonstrate the suitability of OP-Cu for genomic footprinting. Of particular interest, however, are the strong hyperreactivities between the NF-Y binding sites (Fig.5 A, arrows). These indicate the presence of local distortions, which may be caused by the unstacking of base pairs that would create more space for the intercalating phenanthroline moiety (28.Drew H.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 176: 535-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the protections in the area of NF-Y binding are notably stronger when compared with those in the CHR region, which is also occupied in the minor groove. This can be taken as further evidence for a non-B-DNA structure at the NF-Y binding sites (25.Sigman D.S. Duwabara M.D. Chen C-H.B. Brucie T.W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 381-413Google Scholar, 26.Pope L.E. Sigman D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar,28.Drew H.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 176: 535-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). For comparison, we footprinted the cyclin Apromoter with OP-Cu (Fig. 5 B). Protections were seen in the region of the NF-Y site and to a lesser extent at the CHR, similar to that observed with the cdc25C promoter and at the ATF site. Hyperreactivities were detected specifically between the NF-Y site and the CDE/CHR element. No such hyperreactivity was found between the NF-Y and ATF sites (or other sites) indicating that the structural distortions detected by OP-Cu are indeed transcription factor-specific. We also analyzed potential cell cycle effects on the OP-Cu hyperreactivities in the cyclin Apromoter. A comparison of the patterns obtained after footprinting of normally growing and G0 cells showed a diminished protection of the NF-Y site and hyperreactivities 5′ to the NF-Y site in the G0 cells (Fig. 5 B). These cell cycle effects are likely to reflect a weakened interaction of NF-Y with its cognate recognition site in G0 cells and support the hypothesis that the OP-Cu hyperreactivities are caused by NF-Y bindingin vivo. These observations are also consistent with the finding made with DNase I footprinting of the cdc25Cpromoter described above (Fig. 4 A). In contrast to the cdc25C promoter, the CDE was also protected, and hyperreactivities were detected in its vicinity. This presumably reflects the binding of additional factors of the E2F family with the CDE in the cyclin A promoter (7.Zwicker J. Lucibello F.C. Wolfraim L.A. Gross C. Truss M. Engeland K. Müller R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4514-4522Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 29.Schulze A. Zerfass K. Spitkovsky D. Middendorp S. Berges J. Helin K. Jansen-Dürr P. Henglein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11264-11268Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 30.Liu N. Lucibello F.C. Engeland K. Müller R. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2957-2963Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Finally, we analyzed the proximal promoter region for kinked DNA structures or single-stranded stretches by KMnO4 footprinting in vivo. This study showed a strong correlation between KMnO4 hyperreactivity and NF-Y binding (Fig. 6). Neither the Sp1 sites nor the CDE-CHR displayed such hyperreactivities. This KMnO4 hyperreactivity, which coincides with the area of OP-Cu hypersensitivity, probably reflects local kinks or strong bends with a defect in base stacking rather than a melted region, as has been reported for ς factor-induced DNA distortions in vitro(27.Morris L. Cannon W. Claverie-Martin F. Austin S. Buck M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11563-11571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A strong DNA bend or unwinding with a local unstacking of base pairs would enhance the intercalation of OP-Cu between the base pairs while giving KMnO4 access to the 5,6-double bond of the T-ring (31.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar). Downstream of position +1 bp, multiple sites of KMnO4hyperreactivity were also detectable, but these can be presumably attributed to pausing polymerases in the basal promoter region (10.Körner K. Wolfraim L. Lucibello F.C. Müller R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4933-4939Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The high resolution analysis of Micrococcus nuclease and MPE hypersensitivities reported in the present study strongly suggests that the cdc25C promoter is organized in a positioned nucleosome, and this structural organization is maintained throughout the cell cycle. The fact that the positioned nucleosome spans the same size region encompassing the three NF-Y sites in the presence of bound NF-Y (5.Lucibello F.C. Truss M. Zwicker J. Ehlert F. Beato M. Müller R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 132-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) strongly suggests that NF-Y interacts with a nucleosomal template in vivo. This is supported by the observation that NF-Y is capable of interacting with reconstituted nucleosomes in vitro (13.Caretti G. Motta M.C. Mantovani R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8591-8603Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The footprinting data clearly demonstrate strong structural perturbations in and around the NF-Y binding sites in the context of two different promoters in vivo, i.e. cdc25C and cyclin A, that are structurally and functionally related (7.Zwicker J. Lucibello F.C. Wolfraim L.A. Gross C. Truss M. Engeland K. Müller R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4514-4522Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Of particular interest are the observed cell cycle effects, which indicate that NF-Y binding is decreased in resting cells concomitantly with diminished hypersensitivities adjacent to the NF-Y sites. These correlations also suggest that the observed structural perturbations in and around the NF-Y binding sites are indeed caused by NF-Y, which is consistent with the ability of NF-Y to induce DNA bending in vitro (16.Ronchi A. Bellorini M. Mongelli N. Mantovani R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4565-4572Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The observed structural changes are not typical of rotationally positioned nucleosomes but instead suggest a positioned although partially opened nucleosomal structure, similar to the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter after hormone induction (21.Truss M. Barsch J.H. Schelbert A. Hache R.J.G. Beato M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1737-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). It is conceivable therefore that the structural disturbances at the NF-Y binding sites (coinciding with NF-Y occupation of these sites) together with the reported ability of NF-Y to recruit the histone acetylases, Gcn5 and P/CAF (11.Currie R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1430-1434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 12.Jin S. Scotto K.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4377-4388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), play a role in opening the chromatin structure of the proximal promoter. The OP-Cu and KMnO4 footprints that show that NF-Y in vivo induces a local unstacking of the base pairs, which is indicative of kinked or strongly bent DNA, support this hypothesis because the ability of transcription factors to bend DNA facilitates binding to nucleosomal structures in vitro (32.Polach K.J. Widom J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 130-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). This is strongly supported by the data obtained with the cyclin A promoter, where a functionally crucial NF-Y site (7.Zwicker J. Lucibello F.C. Wolfraim L.A. Gross C. Truss M. Engeland K. Müller R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4514-4522Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), albeit in a different context, is also associated with clearly structural perturbations in vivo. The above observations lead to the following model. NF-Y acts as a transcriptional activator that may involve its property to recruit Gcn5 and P/CAF and its ability to bind to nucleosomal templates in vivo. The structural perturbations at the NF-Y sites that reflect changes in the nucleosomal structure caused by NF-Y may affect the interaction of the promoter with other factors and may thus contribute to transcriptional activation and/or repression of the gene. The binding of the repressor CDF-1 in G0/G1 may weaken the binding of NF-Y through an unknown mechanism, which in turn results in an altered promoter topology that does not favor transcriptional activation. The data obtained in the present study provide the basis for future work addressing the validity of these ideas. We are grateful to M. Beato, M. Funk, T. Schmidt, M. Truss, and A. Scholz for many useful discussions and suggestions. We thank D. Eick for help with the KMnO4footprinting and M. Krause for synthesis of oligonucleotides."
