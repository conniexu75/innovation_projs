One of these strains required about 25 percent more arginine than another for maximum growth to that age."

Two such ""bands,"" 5 to 10 grams and 15 to 20 grams, were established, the momentarily correct ""band"" indicated by one of two exteroceptive stimulus values. Peak force of response tended to conform to the reinforcement requirements, the two stimulus values setting the occasion for differentiated distributions of response force."

https://openalex.org/W2005860582,"THE literature concerning the induction of tumours by hormones is very extensive1–4. Œstrogens especially appeared to play an important part in hormonal carcinogenesis5. Evidence of a carcinogenic action of androgens is very scant. Horning6 observed 3 theca-cell ovarian tumours in rats and 2 adrenal cortical tumours in hamsters after long-term treatment with testosterone. Also, Kirkman7 suggested that testosterone propionate may act as a non-specific carcinogen in the hamster."

Though their œstrogenic potency is very weak, the substances may nevertheless be of importance in animal physiology because they are ingested in considerable amounts by grazing animals."

https://openalex.org/W2041515251,"IN a study of the action of pepsin on various poly-α-amino-acids we have found that poly-L-glutamic acid as well as some ammo-acid copolymers containing L-glutamic acid residues are readily hydrolysed by pepsin. Digestion was tested at 35° in 3 ml. solutions containing 12 mg of polyamino-acid1 and 0.8 mg crystalline pepsin, adjusted to pH. 2.3. Since most of the polypeptides investigated do not dissolve directly at acid pH, they were dissolved in the minimal amount of 0.1 N sodium hydroxide, and the required pH was obtained by adding 0.1 N hydrochloric acid. Hydrolysis was followed by measuring: (a) the uptake of acid in the pH-stat ; (b) the increase in the colour produced with ninhydrin2; (c) the increase in Van-Slyke amino-nitrogen. Fair agreement was found in the results obtained by the foregoing three methods. The peptic digests were analysed by descending paper chromatography in n-propanol/water/concentrated aqueous ammonia (100 : 50 : 1 v/v). The chromato-grams were run for 48 h, and were revealed with ninhydrin."

The highest level of radioactivity was detected in clams (Schizimi, Corbicura sp.) harvested from Hinuma Marsh. In view of the widespread occurrence of cerium-144 in tested samples, it is assumed that the presence of this radionuclide is due to fallout."

https://openalex.org/W2043276202,"AGRONOMISTS and agricultural chemists in practice condone statements about applying a given weight ‘of P2O5’; the only certainty then is that phosphorus pentoxide was not used, though a reader may infer that an unspecified phosphate is meant, either alone or mixed with much calcium sulphate. Statements, common in physiological literature, about treating a patient or a tissue with ‘potassium’ or ‘Mg++’ are little more exact or informative for a research student or historian; nor are terms like ‘ion-balance’, or discussions of ‘ions’, when restricted to cations. Phenomena observed in solutions of complex salts are commonly attributed to ‘effects of pH’; series of solutions ‘adjusted to various pH-values’, ‘lacking NO3’, ‘having extra Na’, etc., are taken to be comparable, except for what is thought to be a single ionic variable."
