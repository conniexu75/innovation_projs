https://openalex.org/W1979232921,"A highly selective, colorimetric polynucleotide detection method based on mercaptoalkyloligonucleotide-modified gold nanoparticle probes is reported. Introduction of a single-stranded target oligonucleotide (30 bases) into a solution containing the appropriate probes resulted in the formation of a polymeric network of nanoparticles with a concomitant red-to-pinkish/purple color change. Hybridization was facilitated by freezing and thawing of the solutions, and the denaturation of these hybrid materials showed transition temperatures over a narrow range that allowed differentiation of a variety of imperfect targets. Transfer of the hybridization mixture to a reverse-phase silica plate resulted in a blue color upon drying that could be detected visually. The unoptimized system can detect about 10 femtomoles of an oligonucleotide."
https://openalex.org/W1983341583,"The PATCHED ( PTC ) gene encodes a Sonic hedgehog (Shh) receptor and a tumor suppressor protein that is defective in basal cell nevus syndrome (BCNS). Functions of PTC were investigated by inactivating the mouse gene. Mice homozygous for the ptc mutation died during embryogenesis and were found to have open and overgrown neural tubes. Two Shh target genes, ptc itself and Gli , were derepressed in the ectoderm and mesoderm but not in the endoderm. Shh targets that are, under normal conditions, transcribed ventrally were aberrantly expressed in dorsal and lateral neural tube cells. Thus Ptc appears to be essential for repression of genes that are locally activated by Shh. Mice heterozygous for the ptc mutation were larger than normal, and a subset of them developed hindlimb defects or cerebellar medulloblastomas, abnormalities also seen in BCNS patients."
https://openalex.org/W1521659744,"Adenosine is released from metabolically active cells by facilitated diffusion, and is generated extracellularly by degradation of released ATP. It is a potent biological mediator that modulates the activity of numerous cell types, including various neuronal populations, platelets, neutrophils and mast cells, and smooth muscle cells in bronchi and vasculature. Most of these effects help to protect cells and tissues during stress conditions such as ischaemia. Adenosine mediates its effects through four receptor subtypes: the A1, A2a, A2b and A3 receptors1. The A2a receptor (A2aR)2,3 is abundant in basal ganglia, vasculature and platelets, and stimulates adenylyl cyclase. It is a major target of caffeine, the most widely used psychoactive drug4. Here we investigate the role of the A2a receptor by disrupting the gene in mice. We found that A2aR-knockout (A2aR−/−) mice were viable and bred normally. Their exploratory activity was reduced, whereas caffeine, which normally stimulates exploratory behaviour, became a depressant of exploratory activity. Knockout animals scored higher in anxiety tests, and male mice were much more aggressive towards intruders. The response of A2aR−/−mice to acute pain stimuli was slower. Blood pressure and heart rate were increased, as well as platelet aggregation. The specific A2a agonist CGS 21680 lost its biological activity in all systems tested."
https://openalex.org/W1967558194,"Anandamide, an endogenous ligand for central cannabinoid receptors, is released from neurons on depolarization and rapidly inactivated. Anandamide inactivation is not completely understood, but it may occur by transport into cells or by enzymatic hydrolysis. The compound N -(4-hydroxyphenyl)arachidonylamide (AM404) was shown to inhibit high-affinity anandamide accumulation in rat neurons and astrocytes in vitro, an indication that this accumulation resulted from carrier-mediated transport. Although AM404 did not activate cannabinoid receptors or inhibit anandamide hydrolysis, it enhanced receptor-mediated anandamide responses in vitro and in vivo. The data indicate that carrier-mediated transport may be essential for termination of the biological effects of anandamide, and may represent a potential drug target."
https://openalex.org/W1666619344,"Prostanoids are a group of bioactive lipids working as local mediators and include D, E, F and I types of prostaglandins (PGs) and thromboxanes. Prostacyclin (PGI2) acts on platelets and blood vessels to inhibit platelet aggregation and to cause vasodilatation, and is thought to be important for vascular homeostasis. Aspirin-like drugs, including indomethacin, which inhibit prostanoid biosynthesis, suppress fever, inflammatory swelling and pain, and interfere with female reproduction, suggesting that prostanoids are involved in these processes, although it is not clear which prostanoid is the endogenous mediator of a particular process. Prostanoids act on seven-transmembrane-domain receptors which are selective for each type. Here we disrupt the gene for the prostacyclin receptor in mice by using homologous recombination. The receptor-deficient mice are viable, reproductive and normotensive. However, their susceptibility to thrombosis is increased, and their inflammatory and pain responses are reduced to the levels observed in indomethacin-treated wild-type mice. Our results establish that prostacyclin is an antithrombotic agent in vivo and provide evidence for its role as a mediator of inflammation and pain."
https://openalex.org/W2027378848,"Interleukin-5 (IL-5), which is produced by CD4+ T helper 2 (Th2) cells, but not by Th1 cells, plays a key role in the development of eosinophilia in asthma. Despite increasing evidence that the outcome of many diseases is determined by the ratio of the two subsets of CD4+ T helper cells, Th1 and Th2, the molecular basis for Th1- and Th2-specific gene expression remains to be elucidated. We previously established a critical role for the transcription factor GATA-3 in IL-5 promoter activation in EL-4 cells, which express both Th1- and Th2-type cytokines. Our studies reported here demonstrate that GATA-3 is critical for expression of the IL-5 gene in bona fide Th2 cells. Whereas mutations in the GATA-3 site abolished antigen- or cAMP-stimulated IL-5 promoter activation in Th2 cells, ectopic expression of GATA-3 in Th1 cells or in a non-lymphoid, non-IL-5-producing cell line activated the IL-5 promoter. During the differentiation of naive CD4+ T cells isolated from T cell receptor transgenic mice, GATA-3 gene expression was up-regulated in developing Th2 cells, but was down-regulated in Th1 cells, and antigen- or cAMP-activated Th2 cells (but not Th1 cells) expressed the GATA-3 protein. Thus, GATA-3 may play an important role in the balance between Th1 and Th2 subsets in immune responses. Inhibition of GATA-3 activity has therapeutic potential in the treatment of asthma and other hypereosinophilic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1627446849,"Modification of synaptic strength in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS) occurs at both pre- and postsynaptic sites. However, because postsynaptic receptors are likely to be saturated by released transmitter, an increase in the number of active postsynaptic receptors may be a more efficient way of strengthening synaptic efficacy. But there has been no evidence for a rapid recruitment of neurotransmitter receptors to the postsynaptic membrane in the CNS. Here we report that insulin causes the type A gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA[A]) receptor, the principal receptor that mediates synaptic inhibition in the CNS, to translocate rapidly from the intracellular compartment to the plasma membrane in transfected HEK 293 cells, and that this relocation requires the beta2 subunit of the GABA(A) receptor. In CNS neurons, insulin increases the expression of GABA(A) receptors on the postsynaptic and dendritic membranes. We found that insulin increases the number of functional postsynaptic GABA(A) receptors, thereby increasing the amplitude of the GABA(A)-receptor-mediated miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) without altering their time course. These results provide evidence for a rapid recruitment of functional receptors to the postsynaptic plasma membrane, suggesting a fundamental mechanism for the generation of synaptic plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2029719139,"The roots of plants normally carry small hairs arranged in a regular pattern. Transfer DNA-tagged lines of Arabidopsis thaliana included a mutant with few, randomly distributed root hairs. The mutated gene CAPRICE (CPC) encoded a protein with a Myb-like DNA binding domain typical of transcription factors involved in animal and plant development. Analysis in combination with other root hair mutations showed that CPC may work together with the TTG gene and upstream of the GL2 gene. Transgenic plants overexpressing CPC had more root hairs and fewer trichomes than normal. Thus, the CPC gene determines the fate of epidermal cell differentiation in Arabidopsis."
https://openalex.org/W2018220730,"Mutations in the SUPERMAN gene affect flower development in Arabidopsis . Seven heritable but unstable sup epi-alleles (the clark kent alleles) are associated with nearly identical patterns of excess cytosine methylation within the SUP gene and a decreased level of SUP RNA. Revertants of these alleles are largely demethylated at the SUP locus and have restored levels of SUP RNA. A transgenic Arabidopsis line carrying an antisense methyltransferase gene, which shows an overall decrease in genomic cytosine methylation, also contains a hypermethylated sup allele. Thus, disruption of methylation systems may yield more complex outcomes than expected and can result in methylation defects at known genes. The clark kent alleles differ from the antisense line because they do not show a general decrease in genomic methylation."
https://openalex.org/W1838926299,"The origin of whales and their transition from terrestrial life to a fully aquatic existence has been studied in depth. Palaeontological, morphological and molecular studies suggest that the order Cetacea (whales, dolphins and porpoises) is more closely related to the order Artiodactyla (even-toed ungulates, including cows, camels and pigs) than to other ungulate orders. The traditional view that the order Artiodactyla is monophyletic has been challenged by molecular analyses of variations in mitochondrial and nuclear DNA. We have characterized two families of short interspersed elements (SINEs) that were present exclusively in the genomes of whales, ruminants and hippopotamuses, but not in those of camels and pigs. We made an extensive survey of retropositional events that might have occurred during the divergence of whales and even-toed ungulates. We have characterized nine retropositional events of a SINE unit, each of which provides phylogenetic resolution of the relationships among whales, ruminants, hippopotamuses and pigs. Our data provide evidence that whales, ruminants and hippopotamuses form a monophyletic group."
https://openalex.org/W1970180329,"Signaling cascades triggered by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) participate in diverse developmental processes. The active state of these signaling pathways was monitored by examination of the in situ distribution of the active, dual phosphorylated form of mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK) with a specific monoclonal antibody. Detection of the active state of the Drosophila epidermal growth factor receptor (DER) pathway allowed the visualization of gradients and boundaries of receptor activation, assessment of the distribution of activating ligands, and analysis of interplay with the inhibitory ligand Argos. This in situ approach can be used to monitor other receptor-triggered pathways in a wide range of organisms."
https://openalex.org/W1483538584,"Homeotic (Hox) genes specify the differential identity of segments along the body axis of insects. Changes in the segmental organization of arthropod bodies may therefore be driven by changes in the function of Hox genes, but so far this has been difficult to demonstrate. We show here that changes in the expression pattern of the Hox genes Ubx and AbdA in different crustaceans correlate well with the modification of their anterior thoracic limbs into feeding appendages (maxillipeds). Our observations provide direct evidence that major morphological changes in arthropod body plans are associated with changes in Hox gene regulation. They suggest that homeotic changes may play a role in the normal process of adaptive evolutionary change."
https://openalex.org/W1927237973,"The low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) is responsible for the uptake of cholesterol-containing lipoprotein particles into cells. The amino-terminal region of LDLR, which consists of seven tandemly repeated, approximately 40-amino-acid, cysteine-rich modules (LDL-A modules), mediates binding to lipoproteins. LDL-A modules are biologically ubiquitous domains, found in over 100 proteins in the sequence database. The structure of ligand-binding repeat 5 (LR5) of the LDLR, determined to 1.7 A resolution by X-ray crystallography and presented here, contains a calcium ion coordinated by acidic residues that lie at the carboxy-terminal end of the domain and are conserved among LDL-A modules. Naturally occurring point mutations found in patients with the disease familial hypercholesterolaemia alter residues that directly coordinate Ca2+ or that serve as scaffolding residues of LR5."
https://openalex.org/W2047390883,"Wilson disease is a disorder of copper metabolism characterized by hepatic cirrhosis and neuronal degeneration due to inherited mutations in a gene encoding a putative copper-transporting P-type ATPase. Polyclonal antisera generated against the amino terminus of the Wilson protein detected a specific 165-kDa protein in HepG2 and CaCo cell lysates. Further analysis revealed that this protein is synthesized as a single-chain polypeptide and localized to thetrans-Golgi network under steady state conditions. An increase in the copper concentration resulted in the rapid movement of this protein to a cytoplasmic vesicular compartment. This copper-specific cellular redistribution of the Wilson protein is a reversible process that occurs independent of a new protein synthesis. Expression of the wild-type but not mutant Wilson protein in theccc2Δ strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiaerestored copper incorporation into the multicopper oxidase Fet3p, providing direct evidence of copper transport by the Wilson protein.

Taken together these data reveal a remarkable evolutionary conservation in the cellular mechanisms of copper metabolism and provide a unique model for the regulation of copper transport into the secretory pathway of eucaryotic cells. Copper is an essential trace element that plays a fundamental role in biochemistry, permitting facile electron transfer reactions in diverse metabolic pathways. Despite this essential role, copper is highly reactive and potentially toxic, thus specialized pathways have evolved for the trafficking of this metal within cells (1Hung, I. H., and Gitlin, J. D. (1997) in Oxford Textbook of Clinical Hepatology (Bircher, J., Benhamov, J.-P., McIntyre, N., Rizzetto, M., and Rodés, J., eds) in press, Oxford University Press, Oxford.Google Scholar). This is dramatically illustrated by the genetic disorders Wilson and Menkes disease as well as by recent studies revealing copper-dependent neuronal degeneration in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease (2Siddique T. Deng H.X. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1465-1470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Multhaup G. Schilcksupp A. Hesse L. Beher D. Ruppert T. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Science. 1996; 271: 1406-1409Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Although little information is currently available about these pathways, the recent cloning of the genes involved in several of these disorders provides the opportunity to elucidate such events at the molecular level. Wilson disease is an inherited disorder resulting in hepatic cirrhosis and neuronal degeneration due to a marked impairment in biliary copper excretion. The Wilson disease gene has been cloned and shown to encode a protein with homology to the cation-transporting P-type ATPase family (4Yamaguchi Y. Heiny M.E. Gitlin J.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 5Bull P.C. Thomas G.R. Rommens J.M. Forbes J.R. Cox D.W. Nat.

Genet. 1993; 5: 344-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (1189) Google Scholar). This family includes a number of membrane proteins that utilize ATP-dependent phosphorylation of an invariant aspartate residue to derive energy for cation transport across membranes (7Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15607-15613Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Gene disruption studies of homologous transporters in procaryotes and yeast have shown that these genes encode proteins required to maintain cellular copper homeostasis (8Odermatt A. Suter H. Krapf R. Solioz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12775-12779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Yuan S.D. Stearman R. Dancis A. Dunn T. Beeler T. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Despite these sequence data there is currently no information available about the structure or function of the Wilson disease protein. This current study was undertaken to directly address these issues. Cell lines were obtained and cultured as described previously (10Yamaguchi Y. Heiny M.E. Suzuki M. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14030-14035Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Copper concentration in the media was altered by adding CuSO4, and copper chelation was accomplished with 40 μm bathocuproine disulfonate. Cycloheximide was added at a concentration of 10 μg/ml and shown to inhibit >95% protein synthesis. To generate polyclonal antisera to the Wilson protein, oligonucleotide primers were used to amplify a cDNA encoding amino acids 325–635 as described (10Yamaguchi Y. Heiny M.E. Suzuki M. Gitlin J.D.

Murine monoclonal antibodies to γ-adaptin-1 (AP-1) 1The abbreviations used are: AP-1, γ-adaptin-1; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. were purchased from Sigma, a rabbit polyclonal antibody to TAP-1 was obtained from Ted Hansen (Washington University School of Medicine), rabbit polyclonal antibodies to the human asialoglycoprotein and transferrin receptors were obtained from Alan Schwartz (Washington University School of Medicine), and murine monoclonal antibodies to the bovine cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor and AP-2 were obtained from Stuart Kornfeld (Washington University School of Medicine). Secondary antibodies conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) or tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC) were from Jackson ImmunoResearch. Cells were grown to confluence, lysed in 0.25% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at 4 °C for 30 min, and proteins in a postnuclear supernatant were separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions followed by electrophoretic transfer to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were analyzed by immunoblotting as described (10Yamaguchi Y. Heiny M.E. Suzuki M. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14030-14035Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Cells were labeled by supplementation of the medium with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine at 500 μCi/ml for specific pulse periods followed by chase in serum-free medium as indicated. In some experiments tunicamycin was added 4 h before the addition of the radiolabel to a final concentration of 10 μg/ml. Immunoprecipitation was performed using protein A-Sepharose beads (12Klomp L.W.J. Farhangrazi Z.S. Dugan L.L. Gitlin J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). For gradient fractionation, cells were lysed, homogenized, and subjected to isopycnic density gradient centrifugation as described previously (10Yamaguchi Y. Heiny M.E. Suzuki M. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14030-14035Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 13Strous G.J.A.M. Berger E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7623-7628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fractions were removed, subjected to SDS-PAGE on 5–12% gradient gels, and analyzed by immunoblotting as described above. Cells were plated on glass coverslips, grown for 24 h, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min, quenched with 0.1 methanolamine, and permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min. Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubation in 3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min followed by incubation with primary and secondary antibodies as indicated. After staining, coverslips were mounted on Mowiol 4-88 and analyzed using an Olympus BX-60 microscope. To obtain through-focus images of cells, some samples were analyzed by laser confocal scanning microscopy (Molecular Dynamics) using a Nikon planapo (63 ×) oil-immersion lens (na 1.4). Argon-krypton laser emission wavelengths were 488 nm for FITC and 508 nm for TRITC. The open reading frame of the human Wilson protein was constructed as follows. A XhoI-EcoRV fragment encoding amino acids 540–829 was obtained by screening a human liver cDNA library (4Yamaguchi Y. Heiny M.E. Gitlin J.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar); HindIII-XhoI (amino acids 20–540),EcoRV-SacI (amino acids 829–1255), andSacI-KpnI (amino acids 1255–1465) fragments were obtained by polymerase chain reaction of human liver cDNA using oligonucleotides corresponding to known Wilson sequence. Fragments were subcloned by T overhang into the pCRII vector (Invitrogen) followed by digestion with the designated restriction enzymes. To create the full-length cDNA, recovered fragments were reinserted into the pCRII vector by four-part ligation. The 5′-most region of the Wilson protein was amplified using oligonucleotides corresponding to this region (14Petrukhin K. Lutsenko S. Chernov I. Ross B.M. Kaplan J.H. Gilliam T.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 1647-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), and a 228-base pair Bsp120I fragment containing the first 156 nucleotides of the coding region was inserted into the full-length cDNA following digestion with Bsp120I. The resulting plasmid was designated phWD. To subclone this cDNA for expression inSaccharomyces cerevisiae, phWD was digested withXbaI and KpnI, and the 4.5-kilobase insert was gel-purified, treated with Klenow polymerase to create blunt ends, and ligated into pYES2 (Invitrogen). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using Klentaq polymerase (CLONTECH) and the ExSite mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to manufacturer specifications. Oligonucleotide primers corresponding to the H1070Q or P1038A mutations were synthesized and used to amplify pYES2/hWD. The presence of the specific mutations as well as the fidelity of the entire cDNA sequence was confirmed by dideoxynucleotide sequencing (15Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5476Crossref PubMed Scopus (52771) Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae strains used in this study were as follows: ccc2Δ: MATα, his3–200, trp1–101, ura 3–52, leu2, ade5, CCC2Δ::LEU2 (9Yuan S.D. Stearman R. Dancis A. Dunn T. Beeler T. Klausner R.D. Proc.

To create IHY5, a ccc2Δstrain capable of growth on galactose, IHY4 was crossed withccc2Δ using standard techniques for yeast manipulations (16Sherman F. Find G.R. Lawrence C.W. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1978Google Scholar). All strains were grown at 30 °C in appropriate dropout media (Bio101) supplemented with 2% indicated sugars. Yeast cells were transformed by the lithium acetate method (17Ito H. Fukada Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and uracil-based selection was used to screen for transformants. To induce expression of the Wilson protein, cells were grown in appropriate dropout media containing 2% raffinose at 30 °C to an optical density of 1.5 at 600 nm. Subsequently, galactose was added to a final concentration of 2%, and growth continued for an additional 24 h. Total yeast cell extracts were prepared as described (18Yaffee M.P. Schatz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4819-4823Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), except that samples were not heated before analysis. Fet3p oxidase activity in crude membrane extracts and 64Cu incorporation into newly synthesized Fet3p were analyzed as described previously (19Klomp L.W.J. Lin S.J. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. Culotta V.C. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9221-9226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig. 1, a single 165-kDa protein was observed in HepG2 and CaCo cell lysates analyzed by immunoblotting with an antibody specific to the human Wilson protein. To further characterize this protein, HepG2 cells were pulse-labeled for 1 h with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated and subjected to SDS-PAGE. In this analysis, a single 165-kDa band was detected (Fig. 2 A, lane 1) that was not observed when preimmune serum or antisera preincubated with the Wilson glutathione S-transferase fusion protein was used (data not shown). The derived amino acid sequence of the Wilson protein contains several potential consensus sites for N-linked glycosylation; however, preincubation of HepG2 cells with tunicamycin before immunoprecipitation did not alter the size of this protein (Fig. 2 A, lanes 1 and2). This result was not due to a lack of an effect of tunicamycin in these cells, as immunoprecipitation of these same lysates with antibody to human ceruloplasmin demonstrated the expected differences in mobility for this protein following inhibition of glycosylation (Fig. 2 A, lanes 3 and4). Consistent with these results, following an initial 10-min metabolic pulse, the Wilson protein was identified by immunoprecipitation as a 165-kDa band that did not change size during a prolonged chase period and was not detected in media (data not shown).Figure 2Immunoprecipitation of Wilson protein from HepG2 cells. After a 1-h pulse with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine, cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with antisera to human Wilson protein (lanes 1 and 2) or human ceruloplasmin (lanes 3 and4). For some experiments, cells were incubated with tunicamycin (tm) (4 μg/ml) for 2 h before immunoprecipitation (lanes 2 and 4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) These biosynthetic studies reveal that the Wilson protein is synthesized in HepG2 cells as a single-chain intracellular protein. To determine the steady state location of this protein within these cells, isopycnic density gradient centrifugation was performed. Following ultracentrifugation of HepG2 cell lysates, individual fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting. The results of such an experiment are shown in Fig. 3, where the Wilson protein is observed in the later gradient fractions (lanes 9–11). To determine the location of specific organelles in these fractions, immunoblotting was performed using antibodies that recognize proteins with well defined subcellular locations. TAP-1, a protein that transports peptides into the endoplasmic reticulum and is confined to this compartment, and thecis-Golgi (20Townsend A. Trowsdale J. Semin. Cell Biol. 1993; 4: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) were detected in the earliest fractions (Fig. 3, lanes 1–4). In contrast, AP-1 and the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor, located in the trans-Golgi network and late endosomes (21Griffiths G. Hoflack B. Simons K. Mellman I. Kornfeld S. Cell. 1988; 52: 329-341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar, 22Stoorvogel W. Gueze H.J. Griffith J.M. Schwartz A.L. Strous G.J. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 2137-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), were detected in fractions overlapping with the Wilson disease protein (Fig. 3, lanes 7–11). The results of the fractionation studies suggest that the Wilson protein is localized to an intracellular compartment in the later portion of the secretory pathway of the cell. However, considerable overlap among these compartments is observed in the fractionation experiments. To further characterize the location of the Wilson protein, double-label immunofluorescence microscopy was performed. In these studies, the Wilson protein was consistently detected in a concentrated perinuclear location in HepG2 cells that showed considerable overlap with the location of the mannose 6-phosphate receptor and AP-1 (Fig. 4,A–D). These findings suggest that a considerable portion of the Wilson protein localizes to the trans-Golgi network. In contrast, no overlap was observed when antibodies to the plasma membrane AP-2 complex were used in these same experiments (Fig. 4,E and F). No specific signal was observed in HeLa cells incubated with the Wilson antisera, and no signal was detected in HepG2 cells when this antisera was preincubated with Wilson glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein (data not shown). During the course of these immunofluorescence studies, a variable degree of Wilson-specific signal was also observed in a punctate pattern in HepG2 cells (Fig. 4 C). To determine if this localization was influenced by specific metabolic demands of the cell, HepG2 cells were preincubated with varied concentrations of copper and then subjected to immunofluorescence microscopy. The results of these studies indicated that 2 h after incubation of HepG2 cells in media containing 200 μm copper, the Wilson protein was redistributed from the trans-Golgi network to a peripheral compartment characterized by a punctate staining pattern (Fig. 5 B). Chelation of excess copper by the addition of bathocuproine disulfonate to the medium for 2 h resulted in redistribution of the Wilson protein to a concentrated perinuclear location identical to that found in control cells (Fig. 5 C). These same observations were made when total protein synthesis was inhibited by cycloheximide (Fig. 5,D–F), indicating that copper induced a relocation of the Wilson protein from the trans-Golgi network to the peripheral compartment. The effect of copper on the subcellular localization of the Wilson protein was initiated within 15 min after the addition of excess copper to the medium and occurred at a minimal concentration of 40 μm CuSO4 (data not shown). The effect of copper was saturable with respect to copper concentration and time, with movement from the trans-Golgi network detected within 15 min and found in >95% of all cells within 2 h. These effects were specific for copper, as no change in the location of the Wilson protein was observed when cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of zinc, iron, cadmium, or cobalt (data not shown). Copper did not result in a general reorganization of the structure and distribution of subcellular organelles as evidenced by an undisturbed location of AP-1 (Fig. 6). In contrast to recent studies on the copper-dependent degradation of the plasma membrane copper transporter Ctr1 in yeast (23Ooi C.E. Rubinovich E. Dancis A. Bonifacino F.S. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3515-3523Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), no qualitative or quantitative differences in the Wilson protein were observed with changes in copper concentration as revealed by immunoblot analysis and metabolic labeling (data not shown). To directly analyze function of the Wilson protein, a cDNA encoding the open reading frame was constructed as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” Site-directed mutagenesis was utilized to create missense mutations, and the wild-type and mutant constructs were transformed into the ccc2Δ mutant of S. cerevisiae. Previous studies have shown that yeast strains lacking the Wilson/Menkes gene homologue, CCC2, are deficient in high affinity iron uptake due to a failure to incorporate copper into the ceruloplasmin homologue, Fet3p (9Yuan S.D. Stearman R. Dancis A. Dunn T. Beeler T. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2632-2636Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). To examine expression of the Wilson protein in these yeast strains, immunoblot analysis was performed on equivalent amounts of protein from total cell lysates of wild-type (see Fig. 8, lane 2) or ccc2Δ mutants transformed with vector alone (Fig. 7,lane 3) or plasmids containing wild-type or mutant human Wilson cDNA (Fig. 7, lanes 4–6). As can be seen in this analysis, a single 165-kDa protein was observed in each of the transformants, equivalent in size to that observed in HepG2 cells (Fig. 7, lane 1).Figure 7Immunoblot analysis of Wilson protein inccc2Δ transformants. Equivalent amounts of protein from lysates of IHY4 yeast (lane 2) and ccc2Δyeast transformants with vector (lane 3), wild-type (lane 4), or mutant Wilson cDNAs (lanes 5 and6) were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, incubated with Wilson antibody, and analyzed by chemiluminescence. The arrow indicates Wilson protein in total cell lysates. wt, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The function of the Wilson protein in these transformants was examined by analyzing the activity of Fet3p. Consistent with previous studies (9Yuan S.D. Stearman R. Dancis A. Dunn T. Beeler T. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2632-2636Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), ccc2Δ mutants transformed with vector alone were devoid of Fet3p oxidase activity (Fig. 8 A, lane 2). In contrast, transformation of this strain with the human Wilson cDNA resulted in detectable Fet3p activity equivalent to or greater than that found in the parent strain (Fig. 8, lanes 1 and3). Despite equivalent amounts of protein expression in the transformed ccc2Δ strains (Fig. 7), neither of the mutant Wilson proteins were able to restore Fet3p oxidase activity. These results were not due to alterations in the amount of Fet3p among these transformants, as revealed by immunoblot analysis of Fet3p using equivalent amounts of membrane protein (Fig. 8 B). Under these conditions, the protein is devoid of copper and migrates more slowly than the holoprotein (19Klomp L.W.J. Lin S.J. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. Culotta V.C. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9221-9226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) and is detected as a doublet due to differences in glycosylation (24Askwith C. Eide D. Ho A.V. Bernard P.S. Li L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). The detection of Fet3p oxidase activity in the membrane fraction of theccc2Δ mutant transformed with the wild-type Wilson protein prompted a more direct examination of the role of this protein in copper transport in this strain. After metabolic labeling with64Cu, equivalent amounts of crude membrane fractions from Wilson transformants and control cells were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography. As can be seen in Fig. 9, a single 80-kDa radioactive band corresponding to holoFet3p was observed under these conditions in membrane fractions from the ccc2δ mutant transformed with wild-type Wilson protein (lane 3), directly demonstrating copper transport to newly synthesized Fet3p. These studies indicate that the Wilson disease protein is a 165-kDa single-chain polypeptide localized to thetrans-Golgi network of HepG2 cells under steady state conditions. As each of the N-linked glycosylation consensus sites are located within the cytosol, the failure to detect such glycosylation in the tunicamycin studies lends support to the model of this protein developed from hydropathy plots of the primary sequence (5Bull P.C. Thomas G.R. Rommens J.M. Forbes J.R. Cox D.W. Nat. Genet. 1993; 5: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1720) Google Scholar, 6Tanzi R.E. Petrukhin K. Chernov I. Pellequer J.L. Wasco W. Ross B. Romano D.M.

Genet. 1994; 3: 1647-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The cell-specific expression is consistent with previous RNA blot analysis in human tissues and cell lines (4Yamaguchi Y. Heiny M.E. Gitlin J.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 5Bull P.C. Thomas G.R. Rommens J.M. Forbes J.R. Cox D.W. Nat.

Genet. 1993; 5: 344-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (1189) Google Scholar). These findings are also compatible with clinical observations in patients with Wilson disease that suggest a primary role for this protein in biliary copper excretion (25Cuthbert J.A. J. Investig. Med. 1995; 43: 323-326PubMed Google Scholar) as well as with recent data on the localization of the homologous Menkes disease protein in human and rodent cell lines (10Yamaguchi Y. Heiny M.E. Suzuki M. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14030-14035Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 26Petris M.J. Mercer J.F.B. Culvenor J.G. Lockhart P. Gleeson P.A. Camakaris J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6084-6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 27Dierick H.A. Adam A.N. Escara-Wilke J.F. Glover T.W. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The variation in the location of Wilson protein in HepG2 cells under steady state conditions (Fig. 4) prompted further analysis, including alterations in the metal content of the media. These studies revealed a copper-induced redistribution of the Wilson protein from thetrans-Golgi network to a dispersed punctate-staining pattern suggestive of a vesicular compartment. This process was independent of a new protein synthesis specific for the Wilson protein and dependent upon the copper concentration in the media. Under conditions of copper excess, sucrose gradient studies did not detect Wilson protein in the endoplasmic reticulum fractions. Additionally, immunofluorescence microscopy revealed no colocalization with endosomal or lysosomal markers, including lamp-1, transferrin receptor, and FITC-dextran (data not shown). Thus, this dispersed staining pattern may represent a unique compartment for copper transport and sequestration analogous to that observed in recent studies on the accumulation of HLA-DM in the MIIC intracellular compartment, where loading of class II molecules occurs before antigen presentation at the cell surface (28Sanderson F. Kleijmeer M.J. Kelly A. Verwoerd D. Tulp A. Neefjes J.J. Geuze J.H. Trowsdale J. Science. 1994; 266: 1566-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 29Karlsson L. Péléraux A. Liinstedt R. Liljedahl M. Peterson P.A. Science. 1994; 266: 1569-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Given the known limitations of immunofluorescence microscopy, further analysis using electron microscopic methods are currently being undertaken to further define this compartment. The Wilson protein was not observed on the cell surface despite prolonged incubation of cells in excess copper. The use of several methods of permeabilization that preserved detection of the asialoglycoprotein receptor on the plasma membrane, immunoprecipitation of iodinated cell surface proteins from intact cells, and pulse-chase studies performed with excess Wilson antibody in the media also failed to detect the Wilson protein on the plasma membrane (data not shown). In this sense, the copper-induced trafficking of the Wilson protein observed here is different from recent studies of the hamster homologue of the Menkes protein in copper-resistant cell lines, where copper was found to induce a relocalization of the Menkes protein from thetrans-Golgi network to the plasma membrane (26Petris M.J. Mercer J.F.B. Culvenor J.G. Lockhart P. Gleeson P.A. Camakaris J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6084-6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). In those studies, plasma membrane signal was detected only in cells expressing a 10–70-fold excess of the Menkes protein, raising concern that the plasma membrane localization may represent missorting of the overexpressed protein into a default or bulk flow pathway as observed with overexpression of other proteins where sorting signals use saturable pathways to effect localization (30Marks M.S. Woodruff L. Ohno H. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 341-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Further studies utilizing polarized cells as well as in vivo analysis may help to resolve these uncertainties. Despite these caveats, the results of both studies suggest a unique mechanism of copper-induced trafficking for copper-transporting ATPases, which may be an essential component of cellular copper homeostasis. It is unclear at this point if intracellular copper is directly involved in this process or serves as the mediator of subsequent events such as phosphorylation, which are then transduced as signals for protein movement. Somewhat analogous processes have been observed with lysosomal enzymes on trafficking of the mannose 6-phosphate receptor and insulin on the localization of the GLUT4 glucose transporter (31Kornfeld S. Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 483-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar, 32Czech M.P. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1995; 15: 441-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In these cases, sorting is dependent, at least in part, on signals in the cytoplasmic domains of the target protein and components of organellar protein coats (33Marks M.S. Ohno H. Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 124-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), providing a direction for future studies on the mechanisms of copper-induced trafficking of the copper-transporting ATPases. To address the putative copper transporting function of the Wilson protein, the yeast S. cerevisiae was utilized as a model system. Previous studies demonstrated that CCC2 gene, which is a yeast Wilson/Menkes homologue (34Fu D. Beeler T.J. Dunn T.M. Yeast. 1995; 11: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), encodes a protein essential for the transfer of copper from the cytosol to a compartment for incorporation into Fet3p, a ceruloplasmin homologue necessary for high affinity iron uptake (9Yuan S.D. Stearman R. Dancis A. Dunn T. Beeler T. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2632-2636Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Expression of the human Wilson protein inccc2Δ yeast restored copper incorporation into newly synthesized Fet3p, providing direct evidence of copper transport. A conserved CPC-motif within the putative sixth transmembrane domain has been proposed to play an essential role in copper transport (35Solioz M. Vulpe C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 237-241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Expression of a Wilson protein with a point mutation in this domain (CAC) failed to restore oxidase activity of Fet3p in theccc2Δ mutant (Fig. 9). Furthermore, expression of a Wilson protein encoded by the most common disease allele, an H1070Q mutation (13Strous G.J.A.M. Berger E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7623-7628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Owen Jr., C.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1973; 224: 514-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), also failed to restore Fet3p oxidase activity inccc2Δ yeast. These data are consistent with the marked reduction of holoceruloplasmin observed in patients with Wilson disease and with previous studies on the cellular site of copper incorporation into newly synthesized ceruloplasmin in heptocytes (37Sato M. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5128-5134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus this system permits delineation of the structural determinants of eucaryotic copper transporters as well as providing an assay to analyze patient mutations. In mammals, the cytoplasm of the hepatocyte is the central storage site of copper, and the biliary system is the sole mechanism of copper excretion (38Thomas G.R. Forbes J.R. Roberts E.A. Walshe J.M. Cox D.W. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 210-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). The data in this study provide a molecular explanation for this physiology, where the copper concentration in the hepatocyte cytosol is the primary determinant of movement of the Wilson transporter to a compartment necessary for copper sequestration and export. An implication of this model is that some Wilson mutations may impair copper homeostasis by disturbing trafficking of the transporter rather than function per se, analogous to what has been observed for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (39Welsh M.J. Smith A.E. Cell. 1993; 73: 1251-1254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1236) Google Scholar). The combined analysis of function and localization as shown in this current study will be essential to delineate among these possibilities. The influence of environmental or genetic factors on this process may underlie the observation of marked clinical variability in Wilson disease among affected family members with the identical mutation (40Danks D.M. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995: 2211-2235Google Scholar). The data presented here provide the first direct evidence of how the Wilson protein functions to maintain hepatic copper homeostasis. The toxicity of copper, as evidenced by the hepatic and neuronal degeneration in patients with Wilson disease, demands a rigorous, tightly controlled mechanism to handle the intracellular transport of this metal. The current study indicates that altered copper concentrations in the cellular milieu result in the redistribution of the Wilson protein from the trans-Golgi network to a cytoplasmic compartment, which may serve to sequester copper before exocytosis. The ability of the Wilson protein to functionally complement the yeast Ccc2p directly demonstrates that the Wilson gene product is capable of copper transport. Taken together these data indicate that the primary function of this protein in hepatocytes is to transport copper from the cytosol to the secretory compartment of the cell for incorporation into newly synthesized apoceruloplasmin and for excretion into the bile. These findings reveal a remarkable evolutionary conservation of the mechanisms of cellular copper metabolism and suggest that further utilization of the tractable systems of yeast genetics may permit identification of additional components of this pathway. Given the increasing recognition of the role of copper in inherited and acquired neurodegenerative disorders as well as the importance of antioxidant defenses in human disease, such studies are likely to provide additional insights into this area of biology.

https://openalex.org/W2004986546,"Following interleukin (IL)-1 stimulation, the majority of the cellular interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) translocates to a discrete subset of the Type I IL-1 receptor (IL-1R1) in MRC-5 human lung fibroblasts. As the IRAK becomes multiphosphorylated, it is degraded by proteasomes at a rate comparable to that of the degradation of the phosphorylated IκBα protein. Proteasome inhibitors block the degradation of phosphorylated IRAK and correspondingly increase the amount of IL-1R1 that can be coimmunoprecipitated with IRAK. The nonspecific kinase inhibitor K-252b blocks IRAK phosphorylation and degradation, but does not inhibit IRAK association with the IL-1R1 indicating that translocation of IRAK to the IL-1R1 and its phosphorylation are independent events. The IL-1 specificity of these effects is indicated by the lack of IRAK phosphorylation and degradation by IL-1 in the presence of the IL-1 receptor antagonist or by the activation of MRC-5 cells by tumor necrosis factor α. Long term exposure of MRC-5 cells to IL-1 desensitizes the resynthesized IκBα to IL-1, but not to tumor necrosis factor α stimulation, but no additional effects on IRAK are seen."

We have recently isolated latrophilin, the synaptic Ca2+-independent LTX receptor. Now we demonstrate that latrophilin is a novel member of the secretin family of G protein-coupled receptors that are involved in secretion. Northern blot analysis shows that latrophilin message is present only in neuronal tissue. Upon expression in COS cells, the cloned protein is indistinguishable from brain latrophilin and binds LTX with high affinity. Latrophilin physically interacts with a Gαosubunit of heterotrimeric G proteins, because the two proteins co-purify in a two-step affinity chromatography. Interestingly, extracellular domain of latrophilin is homologous to olfactomedin, a soluble neuronal protein thought to participate in odorant binding. Our findings suggest that latrophilin may bind unidentified endogenous ligands and transduce signals into nerve terminals, thus implicating G proteins in the control of synaptic vesicle exocytosis. α-Latrotoxin (LTX) stimulates massive exocytosis of synaptic vesicles and may help to elucidate the mechanism of regulation of neurosecretion.

Nature. 1995; 375: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1767) Google Scholar). The main release stimulus is Ca2+, which enters nerve terminals through voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels. However, neuroexocytosis can be stimulated in the absence of extracellular Ca2+too. One of such Ca2+-independent activators of neurosecretion is LTX, a Black Widow spider presynaptic neurotoxin that causes massive exocytosis of SV (reviewed in Ref. 2Rosenthal L. Meldolesi J. Pharmacol. & Ther. 1989; 42: 115-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The toxin mode of action remains controversial. On the one hand, LTX can make cation-permeable channels in lipid bilayers (3Finkelstein A. Rubin L.L. Tzeng M.-C. Science. 1976; 193: 1009-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and can dramatically increase ion fluxes through the plasma membrane of toxin-sensitive cells (4Grasso A. Alema S. Rufini M. Senni M.I. Nature. 1980; 283: 774-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), thus triggering neurotransmitter release. In most systems, the influx of Ca2+ indeed plays an important role in LTX effect (2Rosenthal L. Meldolesi J. Pharmacol. & Ther. 1989; 42: 115-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Whether the toxin itself forms pores in the cell membrane or induces the opening of some endogenous channels is still unknown. On the other hand, the toxin has been shown to act in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ (5Fesce L.C. Segal J.R. Ceccarelli B. Hurlbut W.P. J. Gen. Physiol. 1989; 88: 737-752Google Scholar, 6Rosenthal L. Zacchetti D. Madeddu L. Meldolesi J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 38: 917-923PubMed Google Scholar, 7Capogna M. Gahwiler B.H. Thompson S.M. J. Neurophysiol. 1996; 76: 3149-3158Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and other divalent cations (8Misler S. Hurlbut W.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 991-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In addition, to be able to act, LTX requires specific membrane receptors, which are found in the plasma membrane of neurons and some endocrine cells (2Rosenthal L. Meldolesi J. Pharmacol. & Ther. 1989; 42: 115-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In neuromuscular junctions the toxin receptors are localized presynaptically (9Valtorta F. Madeddu L. Meldolesi J. Ceccarelli B. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 124-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The existence of two types of receptors, Ca2+-dependent and -independent, has long been recognized (6Rosenthal L. Zacchetti D. Madeddu L. Meldolesi J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 38: 917-923PubMed Google Scholar), the latter ones being solely responsible for the toxin action in the absence of Ca2+. To elucidate the LTX mode of action and better understand the mechanism of neurosecretion, it is important to know the structure of the LTX receptor. In an attempt to isolate the receptor, neurexins, neuronal cell surface proteins, were discovered (10Ushkaryov Y.A. Petrenko A.G. Geppert M. Südhof T.C. Science. 1992; 257: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). However, neurexins interact with the toxin only in the presence of Ca2+ (11Davletov B.A. Krasnoperov V. Hata Y. Petrenko A.G. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23903-23905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and thus may not be responsible for LTX effect in the absence of this ion. Moreover, LTX potently causes dopamine release in a PC12 cell line that completely lacks Ca2+-dependent receptors (6Rosenthal L. Zacchetti D. Madeddu L. Meldolesi J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 38: 917-923PubMed Google Scholar), thus ruling out the importance of neurexins in the toxin action. Recently, we purified latrophilin, a synaptic protein that binds LTX independently of Ca2+ (12Davletov B.A. Shamotienko O.G. Lelianova V.G. Grishin E.V. Ushkaryov Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23239-23245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The isolation of the same protein was later also described by others (13Krasnoperov V.G. Beavis R. Chepurny O.G. Little A.R. Plotnikov A.N. Petrenko A.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 227: 868-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Here we report the cloning and sequencing of latrophilin, the Ca2+-independent LTX receptor, and demonstrate that it is a novel member of the secretin/calcitonin family of G protein-coupled receptors. Our findings implicate G proteins in regulation of neurotransmitter release. High purity LTX was purchased from Neurogen, UK. Latrophilin from rat brain was isolated by LTX affinity chromatography (12Davletov B.A. Shamotienko O.G. Lelianova V.G. Grishin E.V. Ushkaryov Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23239-23245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and further purified by SDS-PAGE. The protein was digested in gel pieces with endoproteinases Lys-C or trypsin (Wako). Peptides were recovered by sonication and applied directly to an Aquapore AX-300 column (2 × 0.5 mm, custom made) and a Reliasil C18 column (150 × 1 mm) in series on a Michrom Ultra Fast Protein Analyser HPLC system. The columns were developed with a linear acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 50 μl/min. Collected fractions were applied to a high sensitivity Procise system (Applied Biosystems) employing a capillary HPLC C18 column (250 × 0.8 mm). Initial yields were in the range of 0.5 to 5 pmol. A degenerate oligonucleotide probe, AA(A/G)TACGACCT(C/G)CG(C/G)ACCCG(C/G)AT(C/T) AA-3′, corresponding to the sequence of peptide KYDLRTRIK, was used to screen a rat brain cDNA library in λZAPII (∼2 × 106 recombinants, Stratagene). cDNA inserts were sequenced using a Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing chemistry and an automated DNA sequencer, Prism 377 (Applied Biosystems). On-line data base searches were performed using FASTA and BLAST programs (Intelligenetics). Sequences were analyzed with the Lasergene software (DNA Star). The insert from clone RBCR9–15 was recloned into a mammalian vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). COS-7 cells (European Cell Culture Collection) were transiently transfected with this construct or the vector alone, using SuperFect reagent (Qiagen) and 10 of μg DNA/10-cm plate. Cells were harvested after 1–4 days and washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 20 mm EGTA, and aliquots (∼106 cells) were incubated with different concentrations of iodinated LTX for 15 min. A 100-fold excess of unlabeled LTX was included in controls. Unbound toxin was removed by filtration. For immunostaining, ∼5 × 106 transfected cells were solubilized in 2% Thesit and subjected to WGA affinity chromatography as described (12Davletov B.A. Shamotienko O.G. Lelianova V.G. Grishin E.V.

Northern blots (Bios Laboratories) of total RNA from rat tissues were hybridized to a randomly radiolabeled insert from clone RBCR9–15. Latrophilin preparations enriched in heterotrimeric G proteins were made as published (12Davletov B.A. Shamotienko O.G. Lelianova V.G. Grishin E.V. Ushkaryov Y.A. J. Biol.

Antibodies against G protein α-subunits and synaptotagmin were from Santa Cruz and Affiniti. Antibodies against SNAP-25, syntaxin, and synaptobrevin were kindly provided by Drs. J. O. Dolly and P. Foran. Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto Immobilon membrane (Millipore), and visualized using respective antibodies and Chemiluminescence Substrate System (Pierce). To determine the structure of latrophilin, we purified approximately 300 μg of rat brain latrophilin. Fourteen peptides were isolated from the protease-digested protein. The peptide sequences were used to design degenerate oligonucleotide probes for the screening of a rat brain cDNA library. As a result of this screening, we isolated 20 cDNA clones, all of which overlapped and represented a piece of cDNA ∼8.3 kb long. The longest clone (RBCR9–15; 5.7 kb) contained a 4.4-kb open reading frame and encoded all peptides obtained from rat brain latrophilin. The deduced primary structure of this protein, termed rat latrophilin 1 (LPH1), is shown in Fig. 1 A. The LPH1 molecule (Fig. 1 B) comprises the following putative domains: an 849-residue-long extracellular domain, seven hydrophobic transmembrane segments (TMSs) and a cytoplasmic tail of 372 amino acids. The extracellular domain begins with a hydrophobic signal peptide. This is followed by a cysteine-rich stretch homologous to galactose-binding lectin (14Ozeku Y. Matsui T. Suzuki M. Titani K. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2391-2394Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), an extended region of homology to olfactomedin (15Yokoe H. Anholt R.R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The presumably cytoplasmic C-terminal portion of LPH1 contains five cysteine residues. Three of these are positioned very similarly to cysteines in the cytoplasmic tail of rhodopsin and may also be palmitoylated (17Danielson P.E. Forss-Petter S. Battenberg E.L.F. deLecea L. Bloom F.E. Sutcliffe J.G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 38: 468-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). There are several possible phosphorylation sites in the molecule (Fig. 1 A) that may play a role in receptor desensitization in response to endogenous ligand(s) under physiological conditions. Proline residues, abundant in this region, could interact with SH3 domains of proteins involved in signaling.Figure 2Homologies of latrophilin to known proteins.

These proteins belong to the secretin/calcitonin family of GPCRs; most bind peptide hormones and are coupled via heterotrimeric G proteins to the stimulation of various release processes. LPH1 possesses many of the features thought to be important for GPCRs, such as a negatively charged amino acid in TMS III, conserved cysteines in extracellular loops 1 and 2 that may form a disulfide bond, and proline residues in TMS IV and TMS V. LPH1 is the longest known GPCR and, together with its closest homologues (Fig. 2 C), belongs to a subfamily of “long seven-TMS receptors.” In good agreement with our previous results on the tissue distribution of latrophilin (12Davletov B.A. Shamotienko O.G. Lelianova V.G. Grishin E.V. Ushkaryov Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23239-23245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), LPH1 mRNA has been found in the brain but not in non-neuronal tissues (Fig. 3 A). We have also previously shown that latrophilin is greatly enriched in synaptosomal plasma membranes (9Valtorta F. Madeddu L. Meldolesi J. Ceccarelli B. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 124-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This and the strictly presynaptic mode of toxin action suggests that latrophilin is a presynaptic protein. Neuromuscular junctions, the primary target of LTX, also display abundant toxin receptors (9Valtorta F. Madeddu L. Meldolesi J. Ceccarelli B. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 124-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, muscle cells do not transcribe any latrophilin message (Fig. 3 A), corroborating the mainly presynaptic localization of this protein. Apart from the nervous system, LTX receptors are present in chromaffin and PC12 cells (2Rosenthal L. Meldolesi J. Pharmacol. & Ther. 1989; 42: 115-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and some pancreatic β-cell lines. Consistent with its function as the LTX receptor, latrophilin has only been found in those β-cell lines that are responsive to LTX. 2J. Lang, Y. Ushkaryov, A. Grasso, and C. Wollheim, submitted for publication. Also, a PC12 cell line that does not express latrophilin shows no toxin binding and cannot be stimulated by LTX. 3Y. Ushkaryov, unpublished data. Although all peptides from latrophilin have been found in the structure of LPH1, we carried out experiments directed at proving that LPH1 is indeed the toxin receptor. Full-length LPH1 was expressed in COS cells using an appropriate vector. Upon transfection with this construct but not the vector alone, cells specifically bound iodinated LTX in the absence of Ca2+. The number of binding sites grew until day 3 (Fig. 3 B). Analysis of these binding sites revealed that LTX and expressed latrophilin interact with high affinity (Kd = ∼2.5 nm) (Fig. 3 C). This value is higher than that of LTX receptors in brain (12Davletov B.A. Shamotienko O.G. Lelianova V.G. Grishin E.V. Ushkaryov Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23239-23245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), possibly due to a different protein context at the surface of COS cells. The plasma membranes from transfected cells were then analyzed by WGA affinity chromatography and immunoblotting (Fig. 3 D). Latrophilin expressed in COS cells was indistinguishable from the brain protein. These observations unequivocally prove that latrophilin is the Ca2+-independent LTX receptor and confirm our previous conclusion that it alone is sufficient for high affinity LTX binding (12Davletov B.A. Shamotienko O.G. Lelianova V.G. Grishin E.V. Ushkaryov Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23239-23245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Our finding that full-length latrophilin has seven TMSs and provides binding sites for the toxin suggested that neurotransmitter release may be controlled through a receptor-mediated activation of heterotrimeric G proteins. Such a mechanism is well known to regulate exocytosis in secretory cells, although the precise point of the G protein action in the docking/fusion process has not been established yet. G proteins are highly enriched in synapses (31Aronin N. DiFiglia M. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 3435-3444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the basic mechanism of exocytosis regulation in neurons should be similar to that in other secretory cells. Despite this, the idea that heterotrimeric G proteins may be implicated in SV exocytosis is relatively new (32Zelles T. Chernaeva L. Baranyi M. Deri Z. Adam-Vizi V. Vizi E.S. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 42: 242-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 33Stanley E.F. Mirotznik R.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 340-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and has not become widely accepted yet (1Südhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1767) Google Scholar). Interestingly, LTX has already been shown to stimulate (in the presence of Ca2+) the production of IP3 in PC12 cells (34Vicentini L.M. Meldolesi J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 121: 538-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), a function usually controlled by GPCRs. Accordingly, in LPH1-transfected cells but not in control cells, 10 nm LTX causes up to 2-fold elevation of cAMP and IP3 (Fig. 4 A). Although this effect was observed only in 10 μm Ca2+, it was not mimicked by a Ca2+ ionophore A23187, suggesting a functional coupling between the LTX receptor and G proteins, probably enhanced by Ca2+ entry into the cells (see also Ref. 34Vicentini L.M. Meldolesi J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 121: 538-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Therefore, to further confirm a putative functional link, we demonstrate that latrophilin physically interacts with a G protein α-subunit. We found that when latrophilin purification is carried out in the presence of GDP and low micromolar Mg2+, a protein of 42 kDa co-purifies with latrophilin, which reacts with antibodies against Gαo but not those against Gαi subunits (Fig. 4, lane 1). Such discrimination is likely to be specific because Gαosubunits are most abundant in neuronal plasma membranes, whereas Gαi subunits are present mainly on synaptic vesicles (35Ahnert-Hilger G. Schäfer T. Spicher K. Grund C. Schultz G. Wiedenmann B. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 65: 26-38PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the preparation contained no trace of syntaxin, SNAP-25, synaptotagmin, or synaptobrevin, proteins implicated in vesicle docking/fusion (data not shown). The G protein band had been absent from the receptor preparations made in millimolar Mg2+ or in EDTA (12Davletov B.A. Shamotienko O.G. Lelianova V.G. Grishin E.V. Ushkaryov Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23239-23245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), pointing at physiological relevance of this interaction. To further test the specificity of latrophilin association with Gαo, we subjected the preparation containing both proteins to a second affinity chromatography using a WGA column. As Fig. 4 (lanes 4–11) clearly shows, the two proteins co-elute from the second column, indicating that their interaction is stable during a two-step affinity purification. Our results support the hypothesis that LPH1 is a GPCR; however, further experiments are needed to unequivocally identify the specific functional links and determine yet unknown effectors of latrophilin. We also examined what type of second messenger may be involved in the LTX-evoked norepinephrine secretion in neurons. However, our experiments on synaptosomes 4B. A. Davletov and Y. A. Ushkaryov, in press.indicate that the main second messengers, cAMP, cGMP, and IP3 do not control SV exocytosis and do not play a major role in the toxin action in zero Ca2+. These results appear to be at variance with the effect of LTX in COS cells expressing LPH1 (Fig. 4 A). However, functional links of a GPCR in heterologous systems may often be different and depend on the repertoire of heterotrimeric G proteins expressed in a given cell (36Moriarty T.M. Sealfon S.C. Carty D.J. Roberts J.L. Iyengar R. Landau E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13524-13530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). What could then be the mechanism of LTX action in neurons, provided its effect is mediated by latrophilin, a GPCR? G proteins have recently been shown to control neurotransmitter release by regulating preferentially those presynaptic calcium channels that are directly associated with release sites, indicating that channel components of the release sites may be effectors for G proteins (33Stanley E.F. Mirotznik R.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 340-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Although the toxin opens Ca2+-permeable channels in the plasma membrane of sensitive cells, these differ both from pores made by LTX in lipid bilayers (37Wanke E. Ferroni A. Gattanini P. Meldolesi J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 134: 320-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and from conventional Ca2+ channels (38Scheer H.W. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1990; 68: 1049-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 39Filippov A.K. Tertishnikova S.M. Alekseev A.E. Tsurupa G.P. Pashkov V.N. Grishin E.V. Neuroscience. 1994; 61: 179-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). LTX also induces fluxes of other cations in synaptosomes and neuroblastoma cells (40Deri Z. Adam-Vizi V. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 818-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 41Hurlbut W.P. Chieregatti E. Valtorta F. Hamann C. J. Membr. Biol. 1994; 138: 91-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This implicates the involvement of nonspecific cation channels that have been found in numerous cell types (42Marty A. Trends Neurosci. 1987; 10: 373-377Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Such channels are also controlled by G proteins (43Poyer J.F. Ryan J.S. Kelly M.E.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 153: 13-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and could participate in regulation of secretion. On the other hand, in some systems the toxin action may proceed without ion fluxes and membrane depolarization (44Scheer H. Madeddu L. Dozio N. Gatti G. Vicentini L.M. Meldolesi J. J. Physiol. Paris. 1984; 79: 216-221PubMed Google Scholar)2 and may be based on the activation by G proteins of components of release sites different from ion channels. It is important to stress, however, that the site of G protein action in exocytosis is still unknown both in endocrine cells and at nerve terminals. Taken together, our findings strongly suggest that SV exocytosis may be controlled by the presynaptic machinery that links receptors to G proteins to release sites and bypasses the main second messengers. This streamlined type of coupling is already known for ligand-evoked regulation of hormone secretion (45Lang J. Nishimoto I. Okamoto T. Regazzi R. Kiraly C. Weller U. Wollheim C.B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3635-3644Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Consequently, like hormone release, neurosecretion could be directly controlled by extracellular ligands. Remarkably, the N-terminal extracellular domain of LPH1 is homologous to olfactomedin, a protein of olfactory epithelium implicated in odorant binding (15Yokoe H. Anholt R.R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4655-4659Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and to olfactomedin-related proteins found throughout the brain (16Karnik S.S. Ridge K.D. Bhattacharya S. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 B). These soluble proteins may bind some ligands and deliver them by diffusion to GPCRs in the plasma membrane. The striking feature of latrophilin is that this olfactomedin-like domain is attached to a membrane-bound GPCR, suggesting an evolutionary adaptation for a more efficient ligand search and signal transduction. The finding of endogenous latrophilin ligands should therefore reveal new ways of regulating neuroexocytosis. We thank J. O. Dolly and P. Foran for providing antibodies and helpful discussions, J. J.

For adipocyte differentiation, independent lines of evidence show that the transcription factors peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα) as well as the tumor suppressor retinoblastoma (Rb) protein are essential. How these proteins promote adipocyte conversion and how they function cooperatively during the differentiation process remain unclear. We have used retinoic acid (RA) inhibition of adipogenesis to investigate these issues. RA blocked adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 cells induced to differentiate by ectopic expression of PPARγ and C/EBPα independently or together. However, under these circumstances RA was only effective at preventing adipogenesis when added prior to confluence, suggesting that factors involved in regulation of the cell cycle might play a role in establishing the commitment state of adipogenesis that is insensitive to RA. During differentiation of wild type 3T3 L1 preadipocytes, we found that Rb protein is hyperphosphorylated early in adipogenesis, corresponding to previously quiescent cells re-entering the cell cycle, and later becomes hypophosphorylated. The data suggest that, together with the coexpression of PPARγ and C/EBPα, permanent exit from the cell cycle establishes the irreversible commitment to adipocyte differentiation.

During adipocyte conversion, a variety of transcription factors are induced, including C/EBPβ, PPARγ, and C/EBPα (reviewed in Ref. 7Mandrup S. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5367-5370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Enforced expression of PPARγ (8Tontonoz P. Hu E. Devine J. Beale E.G. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1997; 17: 1552-1561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) stimulates adipogenesis in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, suggesting the essential roles of these transcription factors in regulating adipogenesis. Furthermore, combined expression of PPARγ and C/EBPα has synergistic effects on promoting fat cell conversion in myoblasts (14Hu E. Tontonoz P. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9856-9860Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that PPARγ and C/EBPα function cooperatively to establish terminal adipocyte differentiation. In addition to the expression of differentiated marker genes, terminal differentiation is characterized by permanent withdrawal of cells from the cell cycle. One protein that is involved in cell cycle progression is the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene product, Rb (15Weinberg R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 199-202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Hypophosphorylation of Rb inhibits cell cycle progression, and this inhibitory effect of Rb is lost upon phosphorylation of the protein (16Chen P.L. Scully P. Shew J.Y. Wang J.Y. Lee W.H. Cell. 1989; 58: 1193-1198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar, 17DeCaprio J.A. Ludlow J.W. Lynch D. Furukawa Y. Griffin J. Piwnica-Worms H. Huang C.M. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1989; 58: 1085-1095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). The involvement of Rb in adipocyte differentiation is suggested by the observation that ectopic expression of protein kinase Cη in quiescent NIH 3T3 cells induces hypophosphorylation of Rb and promotes adipogenesis (18Livneh E. Shimon T. Bechor E. Doki Y. Schieren I. Weinstein I.B. Oncogene. 1995; 12: 1545-1555Google Scholar), whereas Rb binding by SV40 large T antigen interferes with adipogenic differentiation (19Higgins C. Chatterjee S. Cherington V. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 745-752Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, Rb−/− mouse embryonic lung fibroblasts failed to undergo adipocyte differentiation under appropriate conditions, and ectopic expression of Rb restored the adipogenic phenotype of the Rb−/− cells (20Chen P.-L. Riley D.J. Chen Y. Lee W.H. Genes & Dev. 1996; 10: 2794-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Together, these observations suggest an essential role of Rb in adipocyte differentiation. To explore early events in adipogenesis, we have used retinoic acid (RA), which normally inhibits adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells (21Kuri-Harcuch W. Wise L.S. Green H. Cell. 1978; 14: 53-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 22Stone R.L. Bernlohr D.A. Differentiation. 1990; 45: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 23Xue J.-C. Schwarz E.J. Chawla A. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1567-1575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Liganded RAR blocks C/EBP-stimulated gene transcription, and RA also prevents adipogenesis due to ectopic expression of C/EBPα or -β (13Schwarz E.J. Reginato M.J. Shao D. Krakow S.L. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1552-1561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, during normal adipogenesis RA exerts its inhibitory function only when added in the first 24–48 h after exposure to differentiating stimuli that are applied postconfluence. The inhibitory function of RA is mediated by RA receptors (RARs), which are down-regulated early in adipocyte differentiation (23Xue J.-C. Schwarz E.J. Chawla A. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1567-1575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, ectopic expression of RAR in 3T3 L1 cells only extends the period during which RA is effective in preventing adipogenesis by an additional 24–48 h. Interestingly, at this time, although PPARγ is already induced, the level of PPARγ protein is diminished upon RA treatment. This could be explained by the fact that RA/RAR inhibits C/EBP function, which may be responsible for maintaining the level of PPAR during differentiation (23Xue J.-C. Schwarz E.J. Chawla A. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1567-1575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We first examined the effect of RA on adipocyte differentiation due to incubation of wild type 3T3-L1 cells with the PPARγ ligand BRL49653, as well as in 3T3-L1 cells that ectopically express PPARγ. RA inhibited PPARγ activator-mediated fat cell conversion, suggesting that RA blocks adipogenesis due to endogenous PPARγ. The inhibitory effects of RA were also dominant over ectopic co-expression of both PPARγ and C/EBPα when the cells were maintained in RA at the time of gene transduction and thereafter. However, if added after gene transduction but rather at the time of confluency, RA was no longer effective at blocking differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells that ectopically expressed these adipogenic transcription factors. Thus, co-expression of PPARγ and C/EBPα in cells was not sufficient to commit cells to undergo differentiation in the presence of RA until the cells became postconfluent. Since confluency is associated with withdrawal from the cell cycle, we hypothesized that the stage of irreversible commitment to adipocyte differentiation required exit from the cell cycle as well as the co-expression of both PPARγ and C/EBPα. Indeed, during adipocyte differentiation of wild type 3T3-L1 cells, confluent cells undergo clonal expansion followed by permanent withdrawal from the cell cycle that occurs at about the time RA loses effectiveness in preventing differentiation. During this process Rb protein shifts from a highly phosphorylated state to its hypophosphorylated form. We conclude that the state of RA-resistant commitment to adipocyte differentiation involves not only expression of PPARγ and C/EBPα but also hypophosphorylation of Rb and withdrawal from the cell cycle. 3T3-L1 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD). Cells were cultured in growth medium (GM) containing 10% iron-enriched fetal bovine serum in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. For standard adipocyte differentiation, 2 days after cells reached confluency (referred as day 0), cells were exposed to differentiation medium (DM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 μg/ml of insulin, 1 μm dexamethasone, and 0.5 μmisobutylmethylxanthine, for 48 h. Cells then were maintained in postdifferentiation medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, and 10 μg/ml of insulin. RA was dissolved in ethanol and used at a concentration of 10 μm. For BRL49653-induced adipogenesis, cells were maintained in GM. 1 μm BRL49653 was added to cells on day 0. Cells were exposed to BRL49653 constantly for 7–10 days until fat cells were seen. For experiments involving RA, retrovirally infected cells were studied in the following two protocols: 1) cells were maintained in the constant presence of 10 μm RA from the time of infection and then exposed to the presence or absence of 1 μm BRL49653 at day 0, or 2) cells were grown in the absence of RA until day 0 and then exposed to RA and various conditions. The first of these two conditions corresponds to that described previously (13Schwarz E.J. Reginato M.J. Shao D. Krakow S.L. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1552-1561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pLXSN-PPARγ2 was generated by insertion of a 1.7-kilobase pair SalI fragment of mouse PPARγ2 cDNA into the XhoI site of pLXSN (neor) (24Miller A.D. Rosman G.J. Biotechniques. 1989; 7: 980-990PubMed Google Scholar). pTS13-C/EBPα was generated by insertion of a 1.26 kilobase pairEcoRI-BamHI fragment of C/EBPα into theBamHI site of the TS13 vector (HgmBr). Standard calcium phosphate-DNA transfections were performed. To generate retrovirus-producing packaging cells, 293T cells were transfected with 7.5 μg of plasmid DNA and viral gag and polplasmids (25Landau N.R. Littman D.R. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5110-5113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 48 h post-transfection, filtered viral supernatants from the ecotropic packaging cell line were used to infect 3T3 L1 cells. Two days after infection, cells were selected in G418 (400 μg/ml; Life Technologies, Inc.) or hygromycin B (200 μg/ml) for 10–14 days. For double infection, pLXSN-PPARγ cells were infected with virus containing TS13-C/EBPα for 48 h. Cells then were selected in G418 plus hygromycin growth medium. Dishes were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed by 10% formalin in phosphate buffer for 1 h at room temperature. After fixation, cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and stained with a filtered oil red O stock solution (0.5 g of oil red O (Sigma) in 100 ml of isopropyl alcohol) for 15 min at room temperature. Cells then were washed twice with water for 15 min each and visualized. 3T3-L1 cells were lysed in cell lysate buffer (500 μl for the 10-cm dish and 150 μl for the 60-mm dish), and cells were incubated on ice for 30 min, followed by centrifugation at 17,000 rpm at 4 °C for 30 min. Supernatant was collected, and protein concentration was determined by Bio-Rad protein assay. 60–100 μg of protein was subjected to 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and Ponceau-S (Sigma) staining was performed to verify equal loading/transfer. The membrane was incubated first with primary antibody (anti-PPARγ, 1:1500 (23Xue J.-C. Schwarz E.J. Chawla A. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1567-1575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); anti-C/EBPα, 1:300 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.)) for 2 h, followed by secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated) for 1 h. Blots were developed using ECL chemiluminescence detection reagent (Amersham Life Sciences, Inc.) and visualized by exposure to autoradiography film. Cells were incubated with BrdUrd (Amersham Corp.) for 24 h and then trypsinized, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, and fixed with 70% ethanol on ice for 30 min or longer. Fixed cells were incubated with anti-BrdUrd and then fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody. BrdUrd-positive cells were sorted by flow cytometry. Cells were incubated with 1 μCi/ml of [3H]thymidine for 24 h and then harvested, washed, and resuspended in 0.5 ml of 0.3n NaOH and incubated on ice for 30 min prior to the addition of 0.5 ml of 20% trichloroacetic acid. Precipitated DNA was filtered through a Whatman GFC filter, washed, dried, and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. During DM-induced 3T3-L1 differentiation, RA is only effective in preventing adipogenesis when added during the first 24–48 h (day 0 and day 1), when PPARγ has not yet been induced (7Mandrup S. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5367-5370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Indeed, under circumstances when PPARγ is already expressed, RA can lead to the loss of expression of PPARγ, consistent with its ability to block the transcriptional activity of C/EBPβ, which induces PPARγ during adipogenesis (12Wu Z. Bucher N.L.R. Farmer S.R. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 2350-2363Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 23Xue J.-C. Schwarz E.J. Chawla A. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1567-1575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To further the use of RA as a tool for understanding the stages of adipocyte differentiation, we first tested the ability of RA to affect the adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 cells that is induced by the PPARγ2 activator, BRL49653. BRL49653 induces adipogenesis of post-confluent 3T3-L1 cells, typically causing 20–70% of cells to differentiate into adipocytes within 7–10 days (26Kallen C.B. Lazar M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5793-5796Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). This is presumably caused by the activation of an endogenous low level of PPARγ in the preadipocytes (23Xue J.-C. Schwarz E.J. Chawla A. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1567-1575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and subsequently the activation of the differentiation program and fat cell conversion. These results were confirmed in Fig. 1 (column 1,row 2), where fat cell differentiation is indicated by oil red O staining. RA was able to inhibit BRL49653-induced differentiation (Fig. 1, column 1, row 3). Fig. 2 shows that BRL49653 treatment induced both PPARγ and C/EBPα and that, consistent with the oil red O staining, this induction was blocked by RA. Note that adipocytes express two forms of C/EBPα, referred to in this paper as C/EBPα-LAP and C/EBPα-LIP using nomenclature derived from similar alternative translation products for C/EBPβ (27Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar).Figure 2RA inhibits BRL-mediated adipogenesis of 3T3 L1 cells. Day 0 postconfluent 3T3-L1 preadipocytes maintained in the growth media were exposed to 1 μm of BRL49653, in the absence or presence of 10 μm RA. Cell extracts were prepared on the indicated days and subjected to Western immunoblot to detect the expression of PPARγ and C/EBPα. The arrowsindicate the two PPARγ isoforms (γ1 and γ2) as well as the two translation products of C/EBPα (LAP and LIP).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since RA blocked PPARγ induction by BRL49653, we next examined whether expression of PPARγ would be sufficient to establish insensitivity to RA by testing the efficacy of RA on cells that are ectopically expressing PPARγ2 (designated as L1-PPARγ2). Fig. 3 A shows that these cells constitutively express PPARγ2 protein. In a typical experiment, approximately 20–50% of L1-PPARγ2 cells spontaneously differentiated into fat cells in the absence of any adipogenic stimuli in 7–10 days postconfluency, due either to a low level of endogenous ligand or constitutive activity of the ectopic PPARγ (see Ref. 28Adams M. Reginato M.J. Shao D. Lazar M.A. Chatterjee V.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5128-5132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar and Fig. 1, column 2, row 1). The addition of the PPARγ ligand BRL49563 accelerated and enhanced the differentiation process, with nearly 100% of cells differentiating into fat cells. This is shown by oil red O staining in Fig. 1 (column 2,row 2). In addition, Fig. 3 shows that the adipocyte markers C/EBPα-LAP and C/EBPα-LIP were markedly induced (lane 5). However, when maintained in the presence of RA, cells that were grown in GM with or without the PPARγ ligand BRL49653 did not convert into fat cells, documented both by oil red O staining (Fig. 1,column 2, row 4) and C/EBPα expression (Fig. 3,lanes 6 and 7). The presence of RA had no effect on the ectopic expression of PPARγ (Fig. 3, compare lanes 6 and 7 to lanes 4 and 5). These results suggest that RA is able to block adipogenesis induced by ectopic PPARγ protein expression, and expression of PPARγ is not able to override the inhibitory effect of RA on adipogenesis. Above we showed that RA blocks the function of PPARγ to induce fat cell conversion, suggesting that additional factor(s) may be necessary to be insensitive to RA. Previously we have shown that adipogenesis in cells that ectopically express either C/EBPα or C/EBPβ is also blocked when cells are maintained in the presence of RA from the onset of ectopic gene expression (Fig. 1 and Ref. 13Schwarz E.J. Reginato M.J. Shao D. Krakow S.L. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1552-1561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This was confirmed in Fig. 1(column 3, row 3, where the ectopic C/EBPα-expressing cells are referred to as L1-C/EBPα cells). Interestingly, when RA was added not at the onset of ectopic expression of either PPARγ or C/EBPα, but rather at a later time when cells were confluent, it was no longer effective at blocking differentiation (Fig. 1, row 5). Constitutive expression of C/EBPα in the L1-C/EBPα cells is demonstrated in Fig. 4 (lanes 5 and 7). The vector used to ectopically express C/EBPα does not express the smaller translation product of C/EBPα, called C/EBPα-LIP (23Xue J.-C. Schwarz E.J. Chawla A. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1567-1575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, C/EBPα-LIP expression serves as a marker of adipogenesis in these experiments (29Lin F.-T. Lane M.D. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 533-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Note that C/EBPα-LIP was undetectable in the L1-C/EBPα cells at day 0 (Fig. 4, lane 5), consistent with their lack of adipocyte phenotype. In contrast, continued incubation of the L1-C/EBPα cells for 9 days postconfluency did induce adipogenesis (Fig. 1 (column 3, row 1) and Fig. 4 (note C/EBP-LIP expression in lane 6)). Consistent with the cell morphology shown in Fig. 1, this adipose conversion of L1-C/EBPα cells was blocked when cells were grown in media containing RA (Fig. 1,column 3, row 3; Fig. 4, lane 8). Note that while allowing the cells to reach confluency prior to the addition of RA appeared to prevent the effects of RA on the ectopic C/EBPα- and PPARγ-expressing cells, RA normally prevents adipocyte differentiation of wild type 3T3-L1 cells. Those cells however, do not express PPARγ or C/EBPα until they have begun to differentiate. Thus, the state of refractoriness to RA seems to require both confluency and expression of PPARγ and C/EBPα. Indeed, during normal 3T3-L1 differentiation, RA loses effectiveness at times when PPARγ and C/EBPα are simultaneously expressed in the cells (23Xue J.-C. Schwarz E.J. Chawla A. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1567-1575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since C/EBPα (13Schwarz E.J. Reginato M.J. Shao D. Krakow S.L. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1552-1561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and C/EBPβ induce PPARγ (12Wu Z. Bucher N.L.R. Farmer S.R. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 2350-2363Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 13Schwarz E.J. Reginato M.J. Shao D. Krakow S.L. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1552-1561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we considered the possibility that PPARγ and C/EBPα may induce each other, leading after some time to a state that is refractory to RA inhibition of adipogenesis. To determine whether PPARγ is able to activate C/EBPα gene expression, L1-PPARγ cells were collected prior to differentiation and subjected to Western analysis. Fig. 3 shows that a low but detectable level of C/EBPα protein was present in day 0 L1-PPARγ preadipocytes (lane 3). This is notably different from wild type 3T3-L1 cells, which do not express C/EBPα on day 0 (e.g. lane 1). Thus, ectopic PPARγ expression induced a low level of expression of C/EBPα. The C/EBPα expression was even greater on day 7, consistent with the adipocyte phenotype of these cells. Interestingly, RA blocked expression of C/EBPα despite continued expression of the ectopic PPARγ, suggesting that RA inhibits PPARγ induction of C/EBPα. This would be consistent with the results of others indicating that liganded RAR can interfere with PPAR-mediated gene transcription (31Imakado S. Bickenbach J.R. Bundman D.S. Rothnagel J.A. Attar P.S. Wang X.-J. Walczak V.R. Wisniewski S. Pote J. Gordon J.S. Heyman R.A. Evans R.M. Roop D.R. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 317-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In a reciprocal experiment we examined the expression of endogenous PPARγ in L1-C/EBPα cells. Fig. 4 shows that endogenous PPARγ was expressed in the day 0 L1-C/EBPα preadipocytes (lane 7), whereas expression of PPARγ was undetectable in day 0 control preadipocytes (lane 1). Expression of PPARγ in the L1-C/EBPα cells was abolished by treatment with RA from the time of C/EBPα expression (lanes 7 and 8), consistent with the ability of RA to inhibit transcriptional activation by C/EBPα (13Schwarz E.J. Reginato M.J. Shao D. Krakow S.L. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1552-1561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The above results demonstrate that PPARγ and C/EBPα can activate each other's expression. Therefore, it is likely that the inability of RA to prevent fat cell conversion in L1-PPARγ or C/EBPα cells when added postconfluency is due to the coexpression of PPARγ and C/EBPα. We next tested whether the requirement for confluency could be overcome by forcing cells to express both PPARγ and C/EBPα at higher levels. For these experiments, we doubly infected 3T3 L1 cells with LXSN-PPARγ2 (neor) and TS13-C/EBPα (hygromycinr). These cells grew slowly, perhaps related to growth suppressive properties of C/EBPα in other cell lines (30Timchenko N.A. Wilde M. Nakanishi M. Smith J.R. Darlington G.J. Genes & Dev. 1996; 10: 804-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar); cells that express only ectopic C/EBPα grew somewhat slowly but closer to normal than those ectopically expressing both PPARγ and C/EBPα, suggesting that PPARγ provided a second growth-inhibitory signal in 3T3-L1 cells. In any case, the cells co-expressing C/EBPα and PPARγ spontaneously differentiated into adipocytes during 10 days of selection, even prior to confluency. However, when cells were selected and maintained in the presence of RA, they were able to grow to confluence at normal rates, and no fat cells were observed in the absence or presence of BRL49653 (Fig. 1, column 4, row 1). The ability of RA to prevent differentiation of cells that ectopically express both PPARγ and C/EBPα suggested that concomitant expression of these two proteins was not sufficient to establish a commitment state to adipogenesis that is no longer responsive to RA. We demonstrated that RA is able to inhibit 3T3-L1 adipogenesis due to C/EBPα and PPARγ, alone or in combination, provided that RA is added at the time of gene transduction. In contrast, RA did not have an appreciable effect when added to cells postconfluency. Since confluency is associated with withdrawal of cells from the cell cycle and since cell proliferation and differentiation are often mutually exclusive events, we hypothesized that both cell cycle arrest and the expression of adipogenic genes are necessary for the commitment to fat cell differentiation. It is known that standard differentiation medium induces mitosis of quiescent 3T3-L1 cells prior to cell cycle withdrawal and completion of differentiation along adipogenic lineage. Although RA blocks differentiation, it does not prevent the mitosis and resultant increase in cell number due to the adipogenic stimulation (22Stone R.L. Bernlohr D.A. Differentiation. 1990; 45: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 A shows the time course of the mitotic response to adipogenic stimulation in the absence and in the presence of RA, using BrdUrd incorporation as a measure of DNA synthesis. In both cases, a major increase in BrdUrd incorporation occurs on days 1 and 2 following adipogenic stimulation. Thus, the cells become postmitotic on day 3 and beyond. These data indicate that, although RA prevented adipocyte differentiation, it did not block the clonal expansion that occurs following adipogenic stimulation, although it appears to be quantitatively reduced. Note that in the presence or absence of RA, the adipogenically stimulated cells return to a quiescent state characterized by few mitotic events. However, these states are fundamentally different as shown in Fig. 5 B. The RA-treated cells are quiescent due to contact inhibition, because reseeding them at low density allows them to re-enter the cell cycle. In contrast, Fig. 5 B shows that adipocytes differentiated by the standard protocol in the absence of RA are permanently postmitotic and do not divide after reseeding at low density. These results suggest that after the clonal expansion that occurs in the early phase of adipogenesis, cells permanently exit from the cell cycle. Interestingly, the time after adipogenic stimulation at which the cells are permanently postmitotic corresponds to the time at which cells become refractory to the effects of RA, i.e. between 48 and 72 h after beginning the differentiation protocol (23Xue J.-C. Schwarz E.J. Chawla A. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1567-1575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This further suggested the role of cell cycle events in adipocyte differentiation. The Rb protein plays a major regulatory role in the withdrawal of cells from the cell cycle, and recently it was shown that Rb is required for adipogenic differentiation in a less well characterized model involving embryonic lung fibroblasts (20Chen P.-L. Riley D.J. Chen Y. Lee W.H. Genes & Dev. 1996; 10: 2794-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). We therefore examined expression and phosphorylation of Rb protein in 3T3-L1 cells before and during differentiation in the presence and absence of RA. The immunoblot in Fig. 6 shows that confluent, quiescent 3T3-L1 cells (day 0) contained both hyperphosphorylated and hypophosphorylated forms of Rb protein. The total amount of Rb protein was relatively constant during differentiation. Adipogenic stimulation led to an increase in hyperphosphorylation of Rb during the first 2 days, consistent with the process of clonal expansion that would be aided by hyperphosphorylation and, thereby, inactivation of Rb. As adipogenesis proceeded, as confirmed by expression of PPARγ and C/EBPα, the Rb protein began to shift to its hypophosphorylated form (Fig. 6 A, lane 3), corresponding to cells exiting the cell cycle. By day 7, when nearly 100% adipocyte conversion was achieved, Rb protein was almost entirely hypophosphorylated. The stage of RA insensitivity corresponds to the time of withdrawal from the cell cycle in addition to the expression of the adipogenic factors PPARγ and C/EBPα (day 3). Fig. 6 B shows that the presence of RA at the time of adipogenic stimulation altered the phosphorylation state of Rb. The degree of hyperphosphorylation on day 1 was reduced, consistent with the reduced percentage of cells that underwent clonal expansion (Fig. 5 A). Furthermore, in the presence of RA, Rb was present in both hyper- and hypophosphorylated forms on all days after exposure to adipogenic stimulation. Consistent with the lack of adipogenesis, there was no induction of PPARγ or C/EBPα in the presence of RA (Fig. 6 B). These data suggested a correlation between terminal differentiation and the hypophosphorylation of Rb protein. Together with our earlier demonstration of the role of confluency in determining RA insensitivity of cells that ectopically express both PPARγ and C/EBPα, we conclude that irreversible commitment to adipogenic differentiation requires both the expression of the adipogenic transcription factors and the cell cycle arrest associated with hypophosphorylation of Rb. We have used the ability of RA to inhibit adipogenesis as a tool to explore the molecular events that occur during the adipogenic differentiation process. In particular, we were interested in pursuing the observation that at early times after exposure of confluent 3T3-L1 cells to adipogenic stimulation, the cells become committed to the differentiation pathway and no longer respond to RA. RA was able to block BRL49653-mediated differentiation in wild type 3T3-L1 cells, as well as adipogenesis due to ectopic expression of C/EBPα, PPARγ, or both, even in the presence of the PPARγ ligand BRL49653. These results strongly suggest that the insensitivity to RA inhibition that occurs during normal differentiation is not due solely to the concomitant expression of PPARγ and C/EBPα. However, we have noted that allowing C/EBPα- or PPARγ-expressing cells to reach confluence reproduces the committed, RA-irreversible state that occurs after about 48 h during wild type 3T3-L1 cell differentiation. Consistent with this notion, we found that during standard 3T3-L1 cell differentiation, at the point at which cells normally become refractory to the effects of RA, cells are not only expressing PPARγ and C/EBPα but are exiting the cell cycle following clonal expansion. The ability of RA to block PPARγ-induced adipocyte differentiation suggests that liganded endogenous RAR can interfere with the function of PPARγ in addition to its ability to block transcriptional activity of C/EBPs (13Schwarz E.J. Reginato M.J. Shao D. Krakow S.L. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1552-1561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, the ability of liganded RAR to block PPAR transactivation can be demonstrated in transfected cells (Ref. 31Imakado S. Bickenbach J.R. Bundman D.S. Rothnagel J.A. Attar P.S. Wang X.-J. Walczak V.R. Wisniewski S. Pote J. Gordon J.S. Heyman R.A. Evans R.M. Roop D.R. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 317-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar and data not shown). However, during normal adipogenesis, RA is effective at times prior to expression of PPARγ, suggesting that its natural target is C/EBPβ-mediated transcription (13Schwarz E.J. Reginato M.J. Shao D. Krakow S.L. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1552-1561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have now shown that RA blocks adipocyte differentiation of confluent 3T3-L1 cells when added prior to expression of adipogenic transcription factors and also prevents adipogenesis of cells that constitutively express C/EBPα and PPARγ when added prior to confluency. Thus, excluding the situation where RAR is limiting (23Xue J.-C. Schwarz E.J. Chawla A. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1567-1575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), preadipocytes enter a state of commitment to differentiation that is not reversible by RA when PPARγ and C/EBPα are expressed and growth cessation has occurred. In the absence of RA, cells that ectopically express PPARγ and C/EBPα undergo adipocyte differentiation before cells reach confluency, indicating that cell-cell contact may not be necessary for adipogenesis to occur. However, these cells grow very slowly, suggesting that expression of adipogenic genes may contribute to the cessation of cell growth that is also required for cells to undergo adipogenic differentiation. Both PPARγ and C/EBPα activate several adipocyte-specific genes. Coexpression of PPARγ and C/EBPα has been shown to have a synergistic effect and strongly promote fat cell differentiation of fibroblastic (32Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3076) Google Scholar) and myogenic cell lines (14Hu E. Tontonoz P. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9856-9860Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). C/EBPα has known antimitotic effects, suggesting that its role in promoting differentiation is at least partially related to suppression of cell growth (30Timchenko N.A. Wilde M. Nakanishi M. Smith J.R. Darlington G.J. Genes & Dev. 1996; 10: 804-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Expression of C/EBPα in 3T3-L1 cells reduced their growth rate, and cells that ectopically expressed both PPARγ and C/EBPα grew extremely slowly and underwent adipocyte conversion even before they reached confluence. However, we found that co-expression of these two proteins was not sufficient to commit cells to undergo differentiation in a manner that was irreversible by RA unless the cells were growth-arrested. These observations suggest that growth arrest played a positive role, along with the specific differentiation factors, in determining whether cells proliferate or differentiate. During the normal differentiation process, we found that Rb protein is first hyperphosphorylated and then hypophosphorylated. This correlated well with the cell cycle status of the cells both during and after clonal expansion. While this work was in progress, another group also showed that Rb protein levels were stable throughout adipogenesis but reported that the Rb protein was hypophosphorylated throughout the differentiation process (33Richon V.M. Lyle R.E. McGehee Jr., R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10117-10124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The discrepancy appears to be due to the use of different Rb antibodies, and using the same antibody as we used, those investigators have more recently found changes in Rb phosphorylation similar to those reported here. 2B. McGehee, personal communication. The role of Rb in adipogenesis has been predicted by other studies. In addition to being required for the adipogenesis of mouse lung fibroblasts (20Chen P.-L. Riley D.J. Chen Y. Lee W.H. Genes & Dev. 1996; 10: 2794-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), Rb is necessary for myoblastic differentiation (35Gu W. Schneider J.W. Condorelli G. Kaushal S. Mahdavi V. Nadal-Ginard B. Cell. 1993; 72: 309-324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). Indeed, there is evidence that RB interacts with adipogenic C/EBP proteins (34Chen P.-L. Riley D.J. Chen-Kiang S. Lee W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 465-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) as well as with the myogenic differentiation factor Myo D (35Gu W. Schneider J.W. Condorelli G. Kaushal S. Mahdavi V. Nadal-Ginard B. Cell. 1993; 72: 309-324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). However, the precise role of Rb in differentiation should be further pursued. It is unlikely that cell cycle arrest is merely a downstream effect of adipogenic differentiation factors because expression of C/EBP and PPARγ complement but cannot replace the important effects of cell growth arrest on the ability of 3T3-L1 cells to irreversibly commit to adipocyte differentiation. Taken together, our results suggest that cell cycle arrest is as important as the expression of adipogenic genes in promoting cell differentiation and the irreversible commitment of preadipocytes to this process.

Two macrophage surface receptors, CD36 (a class B scavenger receptor) and the macrophage scavenger receptor (a class A scavenger receptor), have been identified as the major receptors that bind and internalize OxLDL. Expression of CD36 in monocyte/macrophages in tissue culture is dependent both on the differentiation state as well as exposure to soluble mediators (cytokines and growth factors). The regulatory mechanisms of this receptor in vivo are undetermined as is the role of lipoproteins themselves in modulating CD36 expression. We studied the effect of lipoproteins, native LDL and modified LDL (acetylated LDL (AcLDL) and OxLDL) on the expression of CD36 in J774 cells, a murine macrophage cell line. Exposure to lipoproteins resulted in a marked induction of CD36 mRNA expression (4–8-fold). Time course studies showed that maximum induction was observed 2 h after treatment with AcLDL and at 4 h with LDL and OxLDL. Increased expression of CD36 mRNA persisted for 24 h with each treatment group. Induction of CD36 mRNA expression was paralleled by an increase in CD36 protein as determined by Western blot with the greatest induction by OxLDL (4-fold). In the presence of actinomycin D, treatment of macrophages with LDL, AcLDL, or OxLDL did not affect CD36 mRNA stability, implying that CD36 mRNA was transcriptionally regulated by lipoproteins. To determine the mechanism(s) by which lipoproteins increased expression of CD36 we evaluated the effects of lipoprotein components on CD36 mRNA expression. ApoB 100 increased CD36 mRNA expression significantly, whereas phospholipid/cholesterol liposomes had less effect. Incubation of macrophages with bovine serum albumin or HDL reduced expression of CD36 mRNA in a dose-dependent manner. Finally, to evaluate the in vivo relevance of the induction of CD36 mRNA expression by lipoproteins, peritoneal macrophages were isolated from mice following intraperitoneal injection of lipoproteins. Macrophage expression of CD36 mRNA was significantly increased by LDL, AcLDL, or OxLDL in relation to mice infused with phosphate-buffered saline, with OxLDL causing the greatest induction (8-fold). This is the first demonstration that exposure to free and esterified lipids augments functional expression of the class B scavenger receptor, CD36.

However, since acetylation of LDL does not occur under physiological conditions, the natural ligand for this receptor was unclear until it was demonstrated that OxLDL partially competes for the binding of acetylated LDL to macrophages (10Parthasarathy S. Printz D. Boyd D. Joy L. Steinberg D. Arteriosclerosis. 1986; 6: 505-510Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CD36 has now been classified as the defining member of a second class of scavenger receptors, type “B”, which is distinct from the type A (I/II) receptors. It was identified using an expression-cloning strategy to isolate murine macrophage receptors that recognized OxLDL but not AcLDL (11Endemann G. Stanton L.W. Madden K.S. Bryant C.M. White R.T.

The aim of this study was to determine the impact of native and modified lipids on the expression of CD36. Although macrophage expression of CD36 can be modulated by cytokines (25Yesner L. Huh H.

Modulation of scavenger receptors by lipids may potentially impact on the accumulation of cholesteryl esters in macrophages during atherosclerosis. J774A.1 cells (ATCC, Rockville, MD), a murine macrophage cell line, were cultured in T25 flasks with RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 50 μg/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. Experiments were performed when cells were about 90% confluent. LDL (1.019–1.063 g/ml) was isolated from normal human plasma by sequential ultracentrifugation, dialyzed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.3 mm EDTA, sterilized by filtration through a 0.22-μm filter (Millipore), and stored under nitrogen at 4 °C. Protein content was determined by the method of Lowry et al.(27Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AcLDL was prepared by the method of Goldstein et al.(28Goldstein J. Ho Y. Basu S. Brown M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 333-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1952) Google Scholar). LDL was oxidized by dialysis against PBS with 5 μmCuSO4 for 10 h at 37 °C. The purity and charge of both native and AcLDL were evaluated by examining electrophoretic mobility in agarose gel. The degree of oxidation of LDL and OxLDL was determined by measuring the amount of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (29Liao J.K. Shin W.S. Lee W.Y. Clark S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 319-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). LDL had thiobarbituric acid reactive values of <1 nmol/mg. Oxidized LDL had thiobarbituric acid reactive values of >10 and <30 nmol/mg. All lipoproteins were used for experiments within 3 weeks after preparation. Cells were lysed in RNAzolTM B (Tel-Test, Inc., TX). Chloroform was extracted, and total cellular RNA was precipitated in isopropanol. Total RNA (20 μg) from each sample was loaded on 1% formaldehyde-agarose gels. After electrophoresis, RNA was transferred to a Zeta-probe® GT genomic tested blotting membrane (Bio-Rad). The blot was UV cross-linked and prehybridized with HybrisolTMI (Oncor, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) before the addition of32P random prime labeling probe for CD36. The probe is aNsiI-BglII digest (base pairs 193–805) of murine CD36. The original murine CD36 cDNA was obtained from Dr. Gerda Endemann (11Endemann G. Stanton L.W. Madden K.S. Bryant C.M. White R.T. Protter A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11811-11816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNA probe for the murine LDL receptor was prepared by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction with primers generated from published sequences (30Hoffer M. van Eck M. Petrij F. van der Zee A. de Wit E. Meijer D. Grosveld G. Havekes L. Hofker M. Frants R. Biochem. Biophys. Res Commun. 1993; 191: 880-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The sequences of 5′- and 3′-oligonucleotides used were GACTGCAAGGACATGAGCGA (781–801) and CGGTTGGTGAAGAGCAGATA (1201–1221), respectively. Membranes were hybridized overnight, washed, and exposed to x-ray film (X-Omat AR, Eastman Kodak Co.). Autoradiograms were quantified by densitometric scanning using a UMAX (Santa Clara, CA) UC630 flatbed scanner attached to a Macintosh IIci computer running NIH Image software (Bethesda, MD). The same blot was used to rehybridize with 32P-labeled probe for glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) to verify the amount of total RNA loaded. Cells in a T25 flask were released by a rubber scraper, pelleted by sedimentation for 5 min at 500 × g, and washed twice with PBS. After lysis with lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 25 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 2 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml of aprotinin, and 100 mm NaVO4), the lysate was microcentrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was transferred to a new test tube. Protein (100 μg) from each sample was loaded and separated on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with a solution of 0.1% Tween 20/PBS (PBS-T) containing 1% BSA for 2 h, and then incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-FAT (the rat homologue of CD36) antibody (31Ryeom S. Sparrow J. Silverstein R. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 387-395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) at 2 μg/ml in PBS-T/BSA for 1 h at room temperature followed by washing 3 times for 10 min with PBS-T buffer. The blot was reblocked with PBS-T/BSA for an additional hour before adding horseradish peroxidase conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:400 dilution) for another hour at room temperature. After washing 3 times for 10 min with PBS-T the membrane was incubated for 1 min in a mixture of equal volumes of Western blot chemiluminescence reagents 1 and 2 (Renaissance®, NEN Life Science Products). The membrane was then exposed to film for 2 min before development. Unilamellar phospholipid liposomes were prepared by extrusion through polycarbonate membranes (24Rigotti A. Acton S.L. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16221-16224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Phosphatidylcholine liposomes contained a 2:1 molar ratio of phosphatidylcholine to cholesterol whereas phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylinositol liposomes had a 1:1:1 ratio of phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylcholine, and cholesterol. Liposomes were used within 1 week of preparation. Apoprotein B100 was obtained from Sigma. The effect of native LDL (LDL) and modified LDL (AcLDL and OxLDL) on CD36 mRNA expression was evaluated in a murine macrophage cell line, J774 cells. The cells were cultured overnight in serum-free medium and then treated for 12 h with LDL, AcLDL, or OxLDL (each at 12.5, 25, 50, and 100 μg/ml protein). Changes in cell morphology and viability were not observed. As shown in Fig. 1, native LDL significantly increased (8-fold) CD36 mRNA expression at an LDL concentration of 25 μg/ml. AcLDL induced CD36 mRNA expression by 5-fold with peak expression induced at a concentration of 50 μg/ml. OxLDL increased CD36 mRNA expression (maximal induction of 6-fold) at a concentration of 25 μg/ml. To study the kinetics of induction of CD36 mRNA expression by lipoproteins, we carried out the time course study as shown in Fig. 2. Maximum induction was observed about 2 h after treatment with AcLDL and 4 h with LDL and OxLDL. Increased expression of CD36 mRNA persisted through 24 h with each treatment group. To investigate if the induction of CD36 mRNA expression by lipoproteins was associated with an increase of CD36 protein, macrophages were treated with either LDL, AcLDL, or OxLDL (50 μg/ml protein) for 6 h. As seen in Fig. 3, CD36 protein is detected at two major bands of approximately 53 kDa and 88 kDa, which represent the non-glycosylated form and glycosylated form of the protein. CD36 protein was increased significantly by LDL, AcLDL, and OxLDL by 2-, 3-, and 4-fold, respectively. Only OxLDL significantly increased the glycosylated (88 kDa) form of the protein. Because alterations in steady-state mRNA can reflect changes in either transcription rates or mRNA stability, we studied the effect of lipoproteins on the half-life of CD36 mRNA. In the absence of actinomycin D, CD36 mRNA steady-state levels were increased in response to LDL, AcLDL, or OxLDL (Figs. 1 and4). In the presence of actinomycin D, CD36 mRNA decreased with time (Fig. 4). The half-life of CD36 mRNA was estimated to be approximately 5 h based on the densitometric scanning. Lipoproteins did not increase CD36 mRNA expression in the presence of actinomycin D, and the decrease in the CD36 message, measured as the ratio of CD36 mRNA to GAPDH mRNA, was similar to cells treated with actinomycin D alone. These data demonstrate that lipoproteins do not alter CD36 mRNA stability and imply that regulation of CD36 by lipoproteins is at the level of transcription. To rule out the possibility of nonspecific membrane effects arising from the loading of macrophages with sterols as a cause of CD36 induction, we evaluated the effect of lipoproteins on the expression of another lipoprotein receptor, the LDL receptor. Native, acetylated, and oxidized LDL all down-regulate this receptor (Fig. 5), as would be expected, because of its sterol response element (32Brown M. Goldstein J. Science. 1986; 232: 34-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (4383) Google Scholar). To determine if CD36 induction resulted from uptake of component lipids of the lipoproteins or binding of apoB 100, we evaluated the effects of the components of LDL on the expression of CD36 mRNA. Macrophages were treated with apoB 100 (1 μg/ml) or unilamellar phospholipid/cholesterol liposomes (150 μg/ml) or a combination of both for 20 h. As seen in Fig. 6, apoB either alone or in combination with liposomes induced CD36 mRNA expression remarkably (>4-fold). Phospholipid/cholesterol liposomes alone had a less significant effect (∼2-fold). Incubation with 25-hydroxycholesterol or cholesterol caused a similar increase of CD36 expression to that by liposomes; however, results were difficult to interpret because of the inhibitory effects of ethanol in which they were dissolved (data not shown). Since addition of lipoproteins to macrophages induced CD36 mRNA, we next evaluated the effect of cholesterol acceptors on CD36 expression. Both HDL and BSA can act as cholesterol acceptors and facilitate the efflux of cholesterol from cultured cells (33Phillips M. McClean L. Stoudt G. Rothblat G. Atherosclerosis. 1980; 36: 409-422Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We demonstrate in Fig. 7 that incubation of macrophages with BSA (0.5–5%) causes a dose-dependent reduction in the expression of CD36 mRNA. HDL at a concentration of 25–50 μg/ml had a similar effect (data not shown). To exclude the possibility that the inhibitory effects of BSA or HDL on expression of CD36 mRNA might be due to a contaminating endotoxin (LPS), two experiments were performed. First, experiments were performed with certified endotoxin free (<0.1 ng/mg) BSA with similar results. Second, macrophages were treated with a broad range concentration of LPS (0.1–20 μg/ml). LPS had no effect on CD36 mRNA expression. To investigate if the induction of CD36 in vitrocould be mimicked in an in vivo system and in primary (i.e. non-cell line) cells, mice were injected intraperitoneally with lipoproteins. Four mice were injected with either 1 ml of PBS (control) or lipoproteins (LDL, AcLDL, or OxLDL, 200 μg/ml) in PBS. Peritoneal macrophages were collected by lavage, centrifuged, and plated in Petri dishes for 30 min at 37 °C. After removal of non-adherent cells, RNA was isolated from adherent macrophages. Whereas LDL and AcLDL treatment modestly increased CD36 expression by 2- and 3-fold, respectively, OxLDL increased CD36 expression by 8-fold relative to macrophages isolated from control (PBS-treated) mice (Fig. 8). Scavenger receptors are a family of cell surface receptors expressed by macrophages that are believed to mediate the binding and uptake of modified lipids in atherosclerotic lesions. Therefore, regulation of scavenger receptor expression is thought to be a critical determinant of lipid accumulation at these sites. Cytokines produced by cells comprising the atheroma (macrophages, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and lymphocytes) modulate macrophage scavenger receptor expression in vitro and are thought to participate in modulating expression in vivo. Although the role of lipid accumulation on expression of class A scavenger receptors has been evaluated in one study (34Geng Y. Kodama T. Hansson G. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 798-806Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), their effect on the expression on CD36, a class B scavenger receptor, has not been addressed. The LDL receptor, which contains a sterol regulatory element in the 5′ region of the gene, is down-regulated by high intracellular cholesterol levels and for this reason is not likely to be involved in the foam cell development (35Dawson P.A. Hofmann S.L. van der Westhuyzen D.R. Sudhof T.C. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3372-3379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, scavenger receptors, which do not contain sterol regulatory elements, are constitutively expressed in the presence of high intracellular cholesterol/cholesteryl ester levels. Expression of the class A (type I/II) scavenger receptor was shown to be increased in macrophages and macrophage-derived foam cells relative to freshly isolated monocytes, but expression of the receptor in foam cells was equivalent to differentiated macrophages (34Geng Y. Kodama T. Hansson G. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 798-806Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, expression of the class A scavenger receptor is increased in monocytes from hyperlipidemic patients (36Villanova J.G. Lucenda J. Arcas N. Engel A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1300: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of increased macrophage CD36 expression by exposure to lipoproteins. These findings are important since they demonstrate for the first time that a macrophage scavenger receptor can be up-regulated by both native and modified lipoproteins. CD36 expression is increased in murine heart tissue in mice fed a high fat diet (37Greenwalt D. Scheck S. Rhinehart-Jones T. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1380-1388Crossref Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical evaluation of heart tissue demonstrated that CD36 expression was limited to microvascular endothelial cells. In monocytes, CD36 expression is increased by M-CSF, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, interleukin-4 (25Yesner L. Huh H. Pearce S.F.A. Silverstein R. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1996; 16: 1019-1025Crossref Scopus (151) Google Scholar,38Huh H.-Y. Pearce S.F.A. Yesner L. Silverstein R.L. Blood. 1996; 87: 2020-2028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and adhesion to tumor necrosis factor-activated endothelium (26Huh H.Y. Lo S.K. Yesner L.M. Silverstein R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6267-6271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and is reduced by treatment with LPS (25Yesner L. Huh H. Pearce S.F.A. Silverstein R. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1996; 16: 1019-1025Crossref Scopus (151) Google Scholar). For this reason, it is unlikely that our results can be explained by LPS (endotoxin) contamination of our lipoproteins. Lipoproteins (particularly minimally modified LDL and oxidized LDL) can modulate signal transduction and gene expression in macrophages and other cells (39Lusis A.J. Navab M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 46: 2119-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). LDL stimulates phosphoinositide turnover and elevates cytosolic calcium levels in vascular smooth muscle cells (40Bochkov V.N. Tkachuk V.A. Hahn A.W.A. Bernhardt J. Buhler F.R. Resink T.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 1261-1269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Minimally modified LDL induces the expression of monocyte adhesion molecules (41Berliner J. Territo M. Sevanian A. Ramin S. Kim J. Bamshad B. Esterson M. Fogelman A. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 1260-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar), tissue factor (42Fei H.H. Berliner J.A. Parhami F. Drake T.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 1711-1717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), MCP-1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) (43Cushing S. Berliner J. Valente A. Territo M. Navab M. Parhami F. Gerrity R. Schwartz C. Fogelman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5134-5138Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar), and M-CSF (44Parhami F. Fang Z.T. Fogelman A.M. Andalibi A. Territo M.C. Berliner J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 471-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) in endothelial cells. Induction of MCP-1 and M-CSF is cyclic AMP dependent (44Parhami F. Fang Z.T. Fogelman A.M. Andalibi A. Territo M.C. Berliner J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 471-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Oxidized LDL induces expression of interleukin-8 in monocytes (45Terkeltaub R. Banka C.L. Solan J. Santoro D. Brand K. Curtiss L.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 47-53Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Some of the effects of modified LDL can be mimicked by its constituent lipids. For example, the mitogenic effects of oxidized LDL can be mimicked by lysophosphatidylcholine (46Sakai M. Miyazaki A. Hakamata H. Sasaki T. Yui S. Yamazaki M. Shichiri M. Horiuchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31430-31435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and oxidized phospholipid appears to be the lipid constituent in oxidized LDL that induces endothelial cell expression of MCP-1 (47Watson A. Navab M. Hama S. Sevanian A. Prescott S. Stafforini D. McIntyre T. Du B. Fogelman A. Berliner J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 774-782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and adhesion molecules (48Kume N. Cybulsky M. Gimbrone M. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1138-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). The effects of oxidized LDL on gene expression are gene- and stimulus-dependent (49Hamilton T. Major J. Chisolm G. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2020-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The mechanism(s) by which lipoproteins induce expression of CD36 remain unclear. Although apoB alone induced CD36 expression, it was not induced to the same degree by the intact lipoprotein. The slight induction of CD36 by phospholipid/cholesterol liposomes does not rule out cholesterol enrichment or delivery in mediating CD36 expression since the degree of uptake and alterations of cholesterol content were not verified. However, the dose dependent reduction of CD36 mRNA expression in response to BSA is consistent with the possibility that alterations in cellular cholesterol levels are modulating CD36 expression. Cholesterol has been shown to increase expression of macrophage apolipoprotein E (50Mazzone T. Basheeruddin K. Poulos C. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 1055-1063Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and sterol carrier protein 2 (51Harai A. Kino T. Tokinagra K. Tahara K. Tamura Y. Yoshida S. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 2215-2223Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Cholesterol inhibits the expression of HMG-CoA reductase and the LDL receptor, which contains sterol response elements (35Dawson P.A. Hofmann S.L. van der Westhuyzen D.R. Sudhof T.C. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3372-3379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, delivery of other bioactive lipids present in both native and modified lipoproteins may modulate expression of CD36. In support of this hypothesis, it has been shown that fatty acids can modulate CD36 expression. N-3 fatty acids (eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid) inhibited CD36 expression in human monocytic cells while N-6 fatty acids (arachidonic acid and linoleic acid) tended to increase expression of CD36 (52Pietsch A. Weber C. Goretzki M. Weber P.C. Lorenz R.L. Cell Biochem. Funct. 1995; 13: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that increased CD36 steady-state levels are not the result of alterations in message stability (Fig. 4) and therefore most likely involve increased transcription of CD36. Whether this is directly through a lipoprotein effect on the CD36 promoter or indirectly through the induction of other mediators or transcriptional factors is unknown. In this regard, it has been shown that oxidized lipoproteins can influence gene expression by causing oxidative stress and activating the transcription factor NF-κB (53Andalibi A. Liao F. Imes S. Fogelman A. Lusis A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 651-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The promoter of the CD36 gene has been isolated and partially sequenced (54Armesilla A.L. Vega M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18985-18991Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 55Armesilla A.L. Calvo D. Vega M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7781-7787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), but the role of NF-κB in the transcription of CD36 has not been determined. The relative role of CD36 and the type A scavenger receptors in terms of their contribution to lipid accumulation in the atherosclerotic lesion is undetermined. The use of knockout mice that lack the expression of these receptors may shed some light on the in vivo function of these scavenger receptors. A “natural knockout” gives some indication that CD36 is likely to be an important receptor for oxidized LDL in vivo. A genetic polymorphism in the CD36 gene has been identified in an Asian population (56Kashiwagi H. Tomiyama Y. Kosugi Y. Shiraga M. Lipsky R. Kanayama Y. Kurata Y. Matsuzawa Y. Blood. 1994; 83: 3545-3552Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and shown to result in deficient expression of CD36 (NAKa- phenotype). Monocyte-derived macrophages isolated from these patients bound 40% less OxLDL and accumulated 40% less cholesterol ester than cells derived from normal controls (57Nozaki S. Kashiwagi H. Yamashita S. Nakagawa T. Kostner B. Tomiyama Y. Nakata A. Ishigami M. Miyagawa J. Kameda-Takemura K. Kurata Y. Matsuzawa Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1859-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), further implicating CD36 as a physiological OxLDL receptor. In summary, we have shown for the first time that both native LDL and modified LDL (AcLDL and OxLDL) can up-regulate expression of the macrophage class B scavenger receptor, CD36. Our results imply that exposure to, or cellular accumulation of, free and esterified lipids may augment the expression of CD36 and further contribute to foam cell development in atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W1635837931,"Sheep learn to recognize the odours of their lambs within two hours of giving birth, and this learning involves synaptic changes within the olfactory bulb1,2. Specifically, mitral cells become increasingly responsive to the learned odour, which stimulates release of both glutamate and GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid) neurotransmitters from the reciprocal synapses between the excitatory mitral cells and inhibitory granule cells1. Nitric oxide (NO) has been implicated in synaptic plasticity in other regions of the brain as a result of its modulation of cyclic GMP levels3,4,5,6,7. Here we investigate the possible role of NO in olfactory learning. We find that the neuronal enzyme nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) is expressed in both mitral and granule cells, whereas the guanylyl cyclase subunits that are required for NO stimulation of cGMP formation8 are expressed only in mitral cells. Immediately after birth, glutamate levels rise, inducing formation of NO and cGMP, which potentiate glutamate release at the mitral-to-granule cell synapses. Inhibition of nNOS or guanylyl cyclase activity prevents both the potentiation of glutamate release and formation of the olfactory memory. The effects of nNOS inhibition can be reversed by infusion of NO into the olfactory bulb. Once memory has formed, however, inhibition of nNOS or guanylyl cyclase activity cannot impair either its recall or the neurochemical release evoked by the learned lamb odour. Nitric oxide therefore seems to act as a retrograde and/or intracellular messenger, being released from both mitral and granule cells to potentiate glutamate release from mitral cells by modulating cGMP contentrations. We propose that the resulting changes in the functional circuitry of the olfactory bulb underlie the formation of olfactory memories."
https://openalex.org/W2162771144,"Small G proteins transduce signals from plasma-membrane receptors to control a wide range of cellular functions1,2. These proteins are clustered into distinct families but all act as molecular switches, active in their GTP-bound form but inactive when GDP-bound. The Rho family of G proteins, which includes Cdc42Hs, activate effectors involved in the regulation of cytoskeleton formation, cell proliferation and the JNK signalling pathway3,4,5,6,7,8,9. G proteins generally have a low intrinsic GTPase hydrolytic activity but there are family-specific groups of GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) that enhance the rate of GTP hydrolysis by up to 105times10,11. We report here the crystal structure of Cdc42Hs, with the non-hydrolysable GTP analogue GMPPNP, in complex with the GAP domain of p50rhoGAP at 2.7 å resolution. In the complex Cdc42Hs interacts, mainly through its switch I and II regions, with a shallow pocket on rhoGAP which is lined with conserved residues. Arg 85 of rhoGAP interacts with the P-loop of Cdc42Hs, but from biochemical data and by analogy with the G-protein subunit Giα1 (ref. 12), we propose that it adopts a different conformation during the catalytic cycle which enables it to stabilize the transition state of the GTP-hydrolysis reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1679294728,"Traits that influence the interactions between males and females can evolve very rapidly through sexual selection1 or sexually antagonistic coevolution2. Rapid change in the fertilization systems of independent populations can give rise to reproductive incompatibilities between populations3,4, and may contribute to speciation5. Here I provide evidence for cryptic reproductive divergence among three sibling species of Drosophila that leads to a form of postmating isolation. When a female mates with both a conspecific and a heterospecific male, the conspecific sperm fertilize the vast majority of the eggs, regardless of the order of the matings. Heterospecific sperm fertilize fewer eggs after these double matings than after single matings. Experiments using spermless males show that the seminal fluid of the conspecific male is largely responsible for this conspecific sperm precedence. Moreover, when two males of the same species mate sequentially with a female from a different species, a highly variable pattern of sperm precedence replaces the second-male sperm precedence that is consistently found within species. These results indicate that females mediate sperm competition, and that second-male sperm precedence is not an automatic consequence of the mechanics of sperm storage."

Recombinant pro-PSA was expressed in Escherichia coli, isolated from inclusion bodies, refolded, and purified. The zymogen was readily activated by trypsin at a weight ratio of 50:1 to generate PSA, a serine protease that cleaves the chromogenic chymotrypsin substrate 3-carbomethoxypropionyl-l-arginyl-l-prolyl-l-tyrosine-p-nitroaniline-HCl (S-2586). In this activation, the amino-terminal propiece Ala-Pro-Leu-Ile-Leu-Ser-Arg was released by cleavage at the Arg-Ile peptide bond. The recombinant pro-PSA was also activated by recombinant human glandular kallikrein, another prostate-specific serine protease, as well as by a partially purified protease(s) from seminal plasma. The recombinant PSA was inhibited by α1-antichymotrypsin, forming an equimolar complex with a molecular mass of approximately 100 kDa. The recombinant PSA failed to activate single chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator, in contrast to the recombinant hK2, which readily activated single chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator. These results indicate that pro-PSA is converted to an active serine protease by minor proteolysis analogous to the activation of many of the proteases present in blood, pancreas, and other tissues.

PSA isolated from seminal plasma has also been reported to activate single chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator (scuPA) (22Yoshida E. Ohmura S. Sugiki M. Maruyama M. Mihara H. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 63: 863-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Thus far, three physiologic inhibitors have been shown to inhibit PSA; these include α1-antichymotrypsin (16Christensson A.

FEBS Lett. 1987; 214: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 27Riegman P.H. Vlietstra R.J. Klaassen P. van der Korput J.A. van Kessel Geurts A. Romijn J.C. Trapman J. FEBS Lett. 1989; 247: 123-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The three members of this gene family (28Clements J.A. Endocr. Rev. 1989; 10: 393-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) include tissue kallikrein, human glandular kallikrein (29Schedlich L.J. Bennetts B.H. Morris B.J. DNA ( N. Y. ). 1987; 6: 429-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), and PSA. PSA has approximately 70% sequence identity with tissue kallikrein and 80% with hK2 (30Clements J.A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 99: C1-C6Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The latter two proteins, however, have trypsin-like substrate specificity (30Clements J.A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 99: C1-C6Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). PSA and hK2 have other similarities in addition to their amino acid sequence homology. For example, both are synthesized in a precursor or zymogen form and require minor proteolysis for activation. In 1987, Lundwall and Lilja (14Lundwall A. Lilja H. FEBS Lett. 1987; 214: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar) isolated the cDNA coding for human PSA and showed that the protein is synthesized as a zymogen of a serine protease. The zymogen has not been found in tissue or physiological fluid, however, apparently due to its rapid conversion to the active form. In 1987, Schedlich et al. (29Schedlich L.J. Bennetts B.H. Morris B.J. DNA ( N. Y. ). 1987; 6: 429-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) isolated the cDNA coding for hK2. This protein is synthesized exclusively in the prostate. The activated form of hK2 has been isolated recently from seminal plasma (31Deperthes D. Chapdelaine P. Tremblay R.R. Brunet C. Berton J., J, H. Lazure C. Dubé J.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1245: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), but its physiologic substrate(s) has not been identified. In this study, human pro-PSA was expressed in Escherichia coli, refolded, and purified to homogeneity. Pro-PSA generated serine protease activity upon activation by trypsin, and the resulting enzyme was completely inhibited by α1-antichymotrypsin. It was also found that recombinant hK2 and a partially purified protease(s) from seminal plasma activated pro-PSA and may be the physiologic activators of the protein. Chromogenic substrate S-2586 (3-carbomethoxypropionyl-l-arginyl-l-prolyl-l-tyrosine-p-nitroaniline-HCl), S-2302 (H-d-prolyl-l-phenylalanyl-l-arginine-p-nitroaniline-HCl), and S-2444 (l-pyroglutamyl-glycyl-l-arginine-p-nitroanilide-HCl) were purchased from Pharmacia-Hepar-Chromogenix (Franklin, OH). A full-length cDNA coding for human PSA and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction-generated cDNA from human prostate tissue were kindly provided by Robert Vessella and Alvin Liu (Departments of Urology and Microbiology, University of Washington). The expression vector pET-12a and E. coli strain BL21(DE3) were obtained from Novagen (Madison, WI), and the TA Cloning Kit came from Invitrogen (San Diego, CA). Aprotinin was a gift from Novo Industri A/S (Copenhagen, Denmark). Glutathione (reduced and oxidized), diisopropyl fluorophosphate, benzamidine HCl, and Bicine were purchased from Sigma. Human PSA, purified from seminal plasma by the methods of Sensabaugh et al. (12Sensabaugh G.F. J. Forensic Sci. 1978; 23: 106-115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with a modification, was provided by James Stray (Departments of Urology and Microbiology, University of Washington). Human plasma α1-antichymotrypsin (ACT) was from Athens Research and Technology (Athens, GA), and bovine pancreatic trypsin (N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone-treated) was from Calbiochem. Micro BCA protein assay kit was purchased from Pierce. LB broth was from Life Technologies, Inc., and Tween 20 was a product of Bio-Rad. Ampicillin was from Boehringer Mannheim, and PVDF membrane was from Millipore Corporation (Bedford, MA). Rabbit anti-human PSA antibody was obtained from Dako Corp. (Carpinteria, CA), and recombinant scuPA was kindly provided by Kenji Tanaka of the Green Cross Corporation, Osaka, Japan. Human plasmin, thrombin, factor IXa, and factor Xa were prepared in zymogen forms and activated by standard methods. Each migrated as a single band when subjected to SDS-PAGE. The expression vector for human pro-PSA was constructed by inserting its cDNA (amino acids −7 to +237) immediately behind the initiator methionine codon of a pET12a vector. Polymerase chain reaction was performed with oligonucleotide primers pro-PSA 3 (5′-cat atg gcg ccc ctc atc ctg tct cgg-3′) and pro-PSA 2 (5′-gga tcc tca ggg gtt ggc cac gat ggt-3′) to create NdeI and BamHI sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. The amplified product was ligated into the pCRII vector (Invitrogen) to simplify subsequent subcloning. The insert was removed by digestion with NdeI and BamHI and ligated into pET12a at the NdeI andBamHI sites. The resultant plasmid, pET-pro-PSA, was subjected to sequence analysis to verify its correct sequence. pET12-pro-hK2 was constructed by essentially the same methods as above and used for subsequent expression of pro-hK2. E. coli strain BL21(DE3), transformed with pET-pro-PSA, was grown at 37 °C in 5 liters of 2% LB medium containing 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin. When the absorbance A600 had reached 0.4–1.0, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside was added at 1 mm to initiate pro-PSA expression, and the incubation was continued for an additional 2 h. The cells were then harvested and washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm benzamidine. A total of 10 g of wet cells were harvested from 5 liters of culture medium. The cells were stored frozen overnight at −70 °C. Inclusion bodies were then isolated from 10 g of pellet by the method of Nagai and Thogersen (32Nagai K. Thogersen H.C. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 153: 461-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) and solubilized in 5.0 ml of 8 m urea, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1m NH4Cl, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm benzamidine, 0.1 m 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate by shaking for 4 h at room temperature. After a small amount of insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 5 min), the solubilized protein (25 mg) was then refolded by diluting into 8 liters of 2 m urea, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 0.5m NaCl, 0.1 m NH4Cl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm benzamidine, 1.25 mmreduced glutathione, 0.5 mm oxidized glutathione and by slowly stirring for 24 h at 4 °C. The final protein concentration was ∼0.003 mg/ml. The refolding buffer was degassed and flushed under N2 gas prior to use. The sample was then dialyzed against 65 liters of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, with three buffer changes. After NaCl and Tween 20 were added at 0.1m and 0.01%, respectively, the sample was concentrated to 10 ml by ultrafiltration using a PM10 membrane (Amicon). For purification of the refolded pro-PSA, the concentrated sample (10 ml) was dialyzed against 50 mm Bicine-NaOH, pH 9.0, and applied to a Resource-Q column (Pharmacia), employing a Waters Advanced Protein Purification System, model 650E (Millipore). The column was equilibrated and run with the same buffer at 1.0 ml/min. The pass-through fraction containing refolded pro-PSA was concentrated to 10 ml by ultrafiltration as described above, and NaCl was added to a 0.2 m final concentration. The sample was then applied to a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex G-200 gel filtration column (Pharmacia) equilibrated with 50 mm Bicine-NaOH, pH 9.0, 0.2m NaCl and eluted with the same buffer at 1.0 ml/min. Pro-PSA was found in the second peak. The zymogen form of hK2 (pro-hK2) was expressed, refolded, and purified by essentially the same procedures as described above for pro-PSA. In contrast to pro-PSA, the pro-hK2 was completely activated during the isolation and refolding procedure. The final product showed strong amidolytic activity toward Pro-Phe-Arg-pNA (S-2302). Pro-PSA (5 μg) was incubated with 0.1 μg of trypsin or 0.3 μg of rhK2 in 50 μl of 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl. The activation reaction was terminated by the addition of aprotinin (0.1 or 3.0 μg, respectively) at various times. Fifty microliters of S-2586 (1 or 2 mm, respectively) were then added, and the absorbance increase at 405 nm was monitored at room temperature at 1-min intervals for 15 min for trypsin activation and 5–30 min intervals for 120 min for the activation by rhK2. Human seminal plasma was obtained from normal male volunteers. Samples (30 ml) were pooled and centrifuged (10,000 ×g for 20 min) to remove cells, followed by ammonium sulfate fractionation at 25–45, 45–65, and 65–80% saturation. Precipitates were then dissolved in 10 ml of 50 mm Bicine, pH 8.0, and dialyzed against the same buffer. Pro-PSA (5 μg) was incubated with 10 μg of each ammonium sulfate fractions in a final 50 μl of 0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl. The amidolytic activity (S-2586 2 mm final) of PSA was measured as described above except the activation reactions were not terminated with a protease inhibitor. The amidolytic activity of the ammonium sulfate fractions were also measured as controls. Pro-PSA (22.8 μg) was activated for 2 min with 0.5 μg of trypsin as described above, and the reaction was terminated with trichloroacetic acid at 5% final concentration. After centrifugation (10,000 × g for 5 min), the supernatant was applied to a C18 Bondapak column (4.6 mm inner diameter × 25 cm) connected to a Waters HPLC system and eluted by a gradient composed of 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid (solvent A) and 80% CH3CN, 0.04% trifluoroacetic acid (solvent B) at 1.5 ml/min. The column fractions were monitored by absorbance at 214 nm, and peak fractions were collected manually for subsequent amino acid composition analysis. Trypsin-activated rPSA (5 μg) was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h with various amounts of α1-antichymotrypsin in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1m NaCl. The residual enzyme activity was measured as described above and the aliquots were also analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Recombinant scuPA (2.6 μg) was incubated with 0.25 μg of rhK2 or rPSA in 50 μl of Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl. The activation reaction by rhK2 was terminated by the addition of aprotinin (3.0 μg) at various times. Fifty microliters of S-2444 (1 mm) were added, and the absorbance increase at 405 nm was monitored at room temperature at 1-min intervals for 10 min. For SDS-PAGE, the reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS (2% final) instead of aprotinin. Protein concentrations were determined by the micro BCA protein assay (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard and/or by the extinction coefficient. Sequence analysis was performed according to Matsudaira (33Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) employing an Applied Biosystem protein sequencer model 477A, connected to a model 120A analyzer. SDS-PAGE was performed by the method of Laemmli (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) using 15% polyacrylamide gels, and protein bands were visualized utilizing Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Extinction coefficients of 2.0 for purified recombinant pro-PSA and 3.0 for purified recombinant active hK2 were determined byA280 and the protein concentrations measured by amino acid analysis. This corresponded well with the protein concentration as measured by the micro BCA protein. E. coli BL21(DE3) was transformed with the expression plasmid, pET12-pro-PSA. The cells were cultured and harvested 2 h after induction with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside. After sonication and centrifugation of the cells, essentially all of the recombinant pro-PSA was present in inclusion bodies. The inclusion bodies were then isolated and solubilized. Approximately 5 mg of unfolded pro-PSA was obtained from 1 liter of culture. The isolated pro-PSA was refolded as described under “Experimental Procedures” and purified by anion exchange and gel filtration columns. When applied to the anion exchange column (Resource Q), the majority of the refolded pro-PSA was found in the non-adsorbed fraction, whereas the unrefolded and contaminant proteins remained bound to the column. The non-adsorbed fraction was pooled and concentrated to 5 ml and subjected to gel filtration on a Superdex G-200 column (Fig. 1). The first peak contained a contaminant that migrated at the dye front on SDS-PAGE. The second peak contained pro-PSA with a molecular mass of 31 kDa (reduced) and 28 kDa (nonreduced) (Fig. 2, lanes 2and 5).Figure 2SDS-PAGE analysis of pro-PSA and spPSA. Lanes 1 and 4, unpurified pro-PSA; lanes 2 and 5, purified pro-PSA; lanes 3 and6, spPSA; lanes 1–3, reduced; lanes 4–6, nonreduced. 2 μg of protein was applied to each lane.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Prior to purification, the refolded pro-PSA sample gave several bands besides the 28-kDa band when examined by nonreduced SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2,lane 4). These bands with various mobility differences are due to conformational differences and/or differential SDS binding. Following reduction, all these bands migrated as a single band corresponding to pro-PSA (Fig. 2, lane 1), indicating that a significant portion of the soluble pro-PSA was folded incorrectly. These proteins, which bound to the Resource-Q column, generated little or no amidolytic activity upon incubation with trypsin. Amino acid sequence analysis of the purified pro-PSA gave two amino-terminal sequences, Met-Ala-Pro-Leu-Ile-Leu-Ser-Arg-Ile-Val-Gly-Gly- and Ala-Pro-Leu-Ile-Leu-Ser-Arg-Ile-Val-Gly-Gly-, at a ratio of approximately 1:1. This indicated that the initiation Met was only partially removed in the E. coli cells. The pro-PSA was approximately 4 kDa smaller than the major band of human PSA purified from seminal plasma (spPSA) (Fig. 2, lanes 2 and3). The absence of glycosylation in the recombinant product in contrast to the presence of one carbohydrate chain at Asn45 in the spPSA (14Lundwall A. Lilja H. FEBS Lett. 1987; 214: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 18Watt K.W. Lee P.J. M'Timkulu T. Chan W.P. Loor R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3166-3170Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar) contributes to this mass difference. Under the above conditions, approximately 6 mg of refolded pro-PSA was routinely obtained from 25 mg of the solubilized inclusion body fraction with an overall yield of about 24%. Pro-PSA was incubated with trypsin at a 50:1 weight ratio at 37 °C for various times, and the activation reaction was terminated with aprotinin. The amidase activity for pro-PSA was then determined using S-2586 as substrate. Aprotinin did not affect the amidolytic activity of PSA but completely inhibited trypsin. As shown in Fig. 3, the enzyme activity of PSA increased rapidly and reached a maximum in about 2 min followed by a slow decline. After the 2-min activation, degradation products were not seen by reduced SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses (data not shown). Sequence analysis of the fully activated PSA gave a single new amino-terminal sequence of Ile-Val-Gly-Gly-. These results indicated that trypsin completely cleaved the Arg7-Ile8 peptide bond and did not cleave other bonds in pro-PSA under the conditions employed. This activation was exclusively caused by trypsin since recombinant PSA failed to autoactivate pro-PSA (weight ratio of 10:1) under the same conditions. The propiece (activation peptide) released by trypsin cleavage of pro-PSA was identified in the supernatant of trichloroacetic acid precipitation of the reaction mixture. The supernatant was applied to a reverse phase HPLC C18 column, and several peaks were collected for amino acid analysis (Fig. 4). Only peaks A and B contained significant amounts of amino acids in their hydrolysates with the following compositions: peak A, Ala (1.0), Pro (0.9), Leu (1.8), Ile (0.9), Ser (0.7), and Arg (0.7); and peak B, Met (0.6), Ala (1.0), Pro (0.8), Leu (1.5), Ile (0.7), Ser (0.6), and Arg (0.6). These compositions are in complete agreement with the propiece sequence of Ala-Pro-Leu-Ile-Leu-Ser-Arg encoded by the PSA cDNA (14Lundwall A. Lilja H. FEBS Lett. 1987; 214: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). The specific activity of rPSA (5 μg/100 μl) generated by trypsin activation was 133 nmol of p-nitroaniline/mg protein/min toward S-2586 (1 mm final). This activity was more than 2-fold greater than that obtained by an equivalent amount of spPSA. The lower specific activity of the spPSA was likely due, in part, to the presence of contaminating proteins in this preparation, as observed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 6). To test for potential physiological activator(s) of pro-PSA, the zymogen was examined for activation by rhK2, a proteolytic enzyme that is also synthesized in the prostate gland. The rhK2 was prepared in E. coli under conditions essentially identical to pro-PSA employing the plasmid pET12-pro-hK2. The inclusion bodies were isolated and solubilized, and the rhK2 was refolded as described for pro-PSA. Purification of the rhK2 was carried out on a Resource Q anionic exchange column eluted with a NaCl gradient (0–0.6 m) (Fig. 5). The first two peaks labeled A and C migrated as sharp single bands on SDS-PAGE with a molecular mass of about 27 kDa (Fig. 5, inset). Furthermore, both contained an amino-terminal sequence of Ile-Val-Gly-Gly-, which is characteristic of the activated form of the protein. Peak A containing rhK2 also showed significant amidase activity toward Pro-Phe-Arg-pNA (S-2302) but no activity toward Arg-Pro-Tyr-pNA (S-2586). Furthermore, rPSA, in contrast to rhK2, has no activity toward S-2302. Peak C may contain incompletely refolded protein. Pro-PSA was then incubated with the rhK2 at a molar ratio of 15:1. About 80% activation of the zymogen was observed within 1 h when aliquots were analyzed for PSA activity against S-2586 (Fig. 6 A). In these experiments, the activation of pro-PSA was stopped by the addition of aprotinin prior to the PSA assay. In contrast to trypsin, a substantially greater amount of aprotinin (10 ×) was required to completely inhibit rhK2. Amino-terminal sequence of the PSA activated by hK2 was Ile-Val-Gly-Gly-. The level of this sequence increased in parallel to the generation of amidolytic activity in the time course experiment.Figure 6A, time course of pro-PSA activation by hK2. Pro-PSA (5 μg) was activated with rhK2 (0.3 μg), and the reaction was terminated with aprotinin (3 μg). Amidolytic activity against S-2586 (1 mm final) was monitored. B, time course of pro-PSA activation by partially purified seminal plasma. Pro-PSA (5 μg) was activated with seminal plasma (10 μg). Amidolytic activity against S-2586 (2 mm final) was monitored. The measured absorption values were subtracted by the base-line absorption value of pro-PSA alone in both experiments, and additionally subtracted by the base-line values for seminal plasma in the latter experiment. rhK2 had no activity against S-2586.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res"

Mycobacterium tuberculosis , the causative agent of tuberculosis, and other pathogenic mycobacteria require entry into host macrophages to initiate infection. An invasion mechanism was defined that was shared among pathogenic mycobacteria including M. tuberculosis , M. leprae , and M. avium but not by nonpathogenic mycobacteria or nonmycobacterial intramacrophage pathogens. This pathway required the association of the complement cleavage product C2a with mycobacteria resulting in the formation of a C3 convertase.

https://openalex.org/W2079494240,"While most untransformed cells require substrate attachment for growth (anchorage dependence), the oncogenic transformed cells lack this requirement (anchorage independence) and are often tumorigenic. However, the mechanism of loss of anchorage dependence is not fully understood. When rat normal fibroblasts were cultured in suspension without substrate attachment, the cell cycle arrested in G1 phase and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1 protein and its mRNA accumulated. Conditional expression of oncogenic Ras induced the G1-S transition of the cell cycle and significantly shortened the half-life of p27Kip1 protein without altering its mRNA level. Inhibition of the activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase by cyclic AMP-elevating agents and a MEK inhibitor prevented the oncogenic Ras-induced degradation of p27Kip1. These results suggest that the loss of substrate attachment induces the cell cycle arrest through the up-regulation of p27Kip1 mRNA, but the oncogenic Ras confers anchorage independence by accelerating p27Kip1 degradation through the activation of the MAP kinase signaling pathway. Furthermore, we have found that p27Kip1 is phosphorylated by MAP kinase in vitro and the phosphorylated p27Kip1 cannot bind to and inhibit cdk2."
https://openalex.org/W2089504332,"The conformational conversion of the prion protein, a sialoglycoprotein containing two N-linked oligosaccharide chains, from its normal form (PrPC) to a pathogenic form (PrPSc) is the central causative event in prion diseases. Although PrPSc can be generated in the absence of glycosylation, there is evidence that oligosaccharide chains may modulate the efficiency of the conversion process, and may also serve as molecular markers of diverse prion strains. In addition, mutational inactivation of one of the N-glycosylation sites has recently been associated with a familial spongiform encephalopathy. To investigate the role of N-glycans in determining the properties of PrP, we have expressed in transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells mouse PrP molecules in which N-glycosylation has been blocked either by treatment with the drug tunicamycin, or by substitution of alanine for threonine at one or both of the N-X-T consensus sites. We report that PrP molecules mutated at Thr182 alone or at both Thr182 and Thr196 fail to reach the cell surface after synthesis, but that those mutated at Thr196 or synthesized in the presence of tunicamycin can be detected on the plasma membrane. We also find that all three mutant PrPs, and to a limited extent wild-type PrP synthesized in the presence of inhibitor, acquire biochemical attributes reminiscent of PrPSc. We suggest that the PrP molecule has an intrinsic tendency to acquire some PrPSc-like properties, and that N-glycan chains protect against this change. However, pathogenic mutations, or presumably contact with exogenous prions, are necessary to fully convert the protein to a PrPSc state.

Prion diseases are fatal neurodegenerative disorders of human beings and animals which have attracted enormous attention among both scientists and the public. The recent emergence of a variant form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in the United Kingdom and France has raised widespread concern that human beings can be infected by consumption of beef from cows afflicted with bovine spongiform encephalopathy, a prion disease of cattle (1Will R.G. Ironside J.W. Zeidler M. Cousens S.N. Estibeiro K. Alperovitch A. Poser S. Pocchiari M. Hofman A. Smith P.G. Lancet. 1996; 347: 921-925Abstract PubMed Scopus (1891) Google Scholar). The chemical nature of the infectious agent that causes these diseases has also been the subject of intense interest. Current evidence indicates that this unusual agent, which has been called a prion to distinguish it from a conventional virus, consists primarily of a single kind of protein molecule designated PrPSc (2Prusiner S.B. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Virology. 3rd Ed. Lippincott-Raven Press, Philadelphia1996: 2901-2950Google Scholar). PrPSc is thought to be a conformationally altered isoform of a host-encoded membrane glycoprotein called PrPC. Both isoforms of PrP appear to have the same amino acid sequence (3Stahl N.

Baldwin M.A. Hecker R. Pan K.-M. Burlingame A.L. Prusiner S.B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5043-5053Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism by which PrPC is converted into PrPSc is unknown, but may involve transitions of α-helices to β-sheets in critical regions of the polypeptide chain (8Cohen F.E. Pan K.M. Huang Z. Baldwin M. Fletterick R.J. Prusiner S.B. Science. 1994; 264: 530-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). This same conformational transformation is thought to underlie familial prion diseases which are linked to mutations in the gene encoding PrP (9Prusiner S.B. Hsiao K.K. Ann. Neurol. 1994; 35: 385-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), as well as sporadic prion diseases which have no clear infectious or genetic etiology.Mammalian PrP contains two consensus sites for N-linked glycosylation (at asparagine residues 181 and 197 in human and hamster PrP, and residues 180 and 196 in mouse PrP). Detailed chemical analysis of the carbohydrate chains of PrPSc purified from scrapie-infected hamster brain has shown that both consensus sites are utilized, and that a mixture of bi-, tri-, and tetra-antennary complex-type oligosaccharide chains is present, with about 70% of the terminal galactose residues linked to sialic acid (5Endo T. Groth D. Prusiner S.B. Kobata A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8380-8388Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 6Haraguchi T. Fisher S. Olofsson S. Endo T. Groth D. Tarentino A. Borchelt D.R.

Much less is known about the carbohydrate chains of PrPC, which is much more difficult to purify in large amounts, but it appears that this isoform also has two asparagine-linked, complex-type chains containing sialic acid (5Endo T. Groth D. Prusiner S.B. Kobata A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8380-8388Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Biosynthetically mature PrP appears as three bands on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, thought to correspond to molecules with 0, 1, or 2 N-linked oligosaccharide chains, with the glycosylated species migrating as broad bands due to heterogeneous modification of their core oligosaccharides (10Caughey B. Race R.E. Ernst D. Buchmeier M.J. Chesebro B. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 175-181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Lehmann S. Harris D.A. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6363-6373Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar).Because of the well known role of glycosylation in folding and maturation of nascent polypeptide chains (14Helenius A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar), it is reasonable to suppose that N-linked oligosaccharide chains might play some role in the conformational transition that is responsible for generation of PrPSc. A molecule in which both consensus sites for N-glycosylation are mutated is capable of being converted into PrPSc, as is PrP synthesized in the presence of the glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin (15Taraboulos A. Rogers M. Borchelt D.R. McKinley M.P. Scott M. Serban D. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8262-8266Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). These results indicate that N-linked glycans are not essential for the conversion process. However, several pieces of evidence indicate that glycan chains may modulate the efficiency with which PrPSc is formed. First, Taraboulos et al. (15Taraboulos A. Rogers M. Borchelt D.R. McKinley M.P. Scott M. Serban D. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8262-8266Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) found that PrPSc is produced more rapidly when scrapie-infected cells are treated with tunicamycin. Second, several investigators have observed that PrPSc synthesized in scrapie-infected cells displays a preponderance of lower molecular weight glycoforms (13Tatzelt J. Prusiner S.B. Welch W.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6363-6373Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 16Caughey B. Raymond G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18217-18223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that less glycosylated molecules may be preferred substrates in the generation of PrPSc, an interpretation consistent with studies on the in vitro conversion of unglycosylated PrPC into PrPSc (17Kocisko D.A. Come J.H. Priola S.A. Chesebro B. Raymond G.J. Lansbury P.T. Caughey B. Nature. 1994; 370: 471-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). Third, an inherited form of spongiform encephalopathy has recently been described in a Brazilian family with an threonine → alanine substitution at codon 183 which abolishes one of the consensus sites for glycosylation (18Nitrini, R., Rosemberg, S., Passos-Bueno, M. R., Iughetti, P., Papadopoulos, M., Teixeira-Silva, L. S., Carrilho, P. M., Caramelli, P., Albrecht, S., Zatz, M., and LeBlanc, A. C. (1996)Neurobiol. Aging , 17, (suppl.) S160.Google Scholar). Taken together, these results raise the possibility that the absence of oligosaccharide chains on the PrP molecule may actually increase the efficiency with which PrPSc is formed.The pattern of PrP glycosylation also appears to be an important marker of prion strain variation. Kascsak et al. (19Kascsak R.J. Rubenstein R. Merz P. Carp R.I. Robakis N.K. Wisniewski H.M. Diringer H. J. Virol. 1986; 59: 676-683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) noted differences in the immunoblot pattern of PrP species derived from several different rodent scrapie strains. More recently, Parchiet al. (20Parchi P. Castellani R. Capellari S. Ghetti B. Young K. Chen S.G. Farlow M. Dickson D.W. Sima A.A.F. Trojanowski J.Q. Petersen R.B. Gambetti P. Ann. Neurol. 1996; 39: 767-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar) have characterized two different PrPSc strains in patients with sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease that differ in the size and glycosylation pattern of the core fragment (PrP 27–30) produced after protease digestion. Collingeet al. (21Collinge J. Sidle K.C.L. Meads J. Ironside J. Hill A.F. Nature. 1996; 383: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (1581) Google Scholar) have expanded this classification to include infectious forms of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. They report that the PrP 27–30 molecules associated with “new variant” Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and with bovine spongiform encephalopathy display the sameMr and preponderance of the doubly glycosylated isoform, raising the possibility that the BSE agent may have been transmitted to humans. Variations in molecular size and glycoform distribution also characterize PrP 27–30 molecules prepared from the brains of patients with familial prion diseases (22Monari L. Chen S.G. Brown P. Parchi P. Petersen R.B. Mikol J. Gray F. Cortelli P. Montagna P. Ghetti B. Goldfarb L. Gajdusek D.C. Lugaresi E. Gambetti P. Autilio-Gambetti L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2839-2842Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), and we have reported a similar phenomenon in mutant PrP molecules expressed in cultured cells (23Lehmann S. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1633-1637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that differences in glycosylation may not only be markers of prion strain variation, but may actually play a causal role in the propagation of strains by targeting each prion variant to distinctive subpopulation of neurons in the brain (24Hecker R. Taraboulos A. Scott M. Pan K.-M. Yang S.-L. Torchia M. Jendroska K. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1213-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar).Given the likely importance of N-glycosylation to prion biology as suggested by these results, we decided to undertake a detailed analysis of the biosynthesis in cultured cells of PrP molecules that were aberrantly glycosylated, either as a result of mutation of one or both of the glycosylation consensus sites, or because of synthesis in the presence of the inhibitor tunicamycin. One of the mutations we have examined is homologous to the threonine → alanine substitution at codon 183 that is associated with spongiform encephalopathy in the Brazilian family (18Nitrini, R., Rosemberg, S., Passos-Bueno, M. R., Iughetti, P., Papadopoulos, M., Teixeira-Silva, L. S., Carrilho, P. M., Caramelli, P., Albrecht, S., Zatz, M., and LeBlanc, A. C. (1996)Neurobiol. Aging , 17, (suppl.) S160.Google Scholar). A homologous set of mutations has been examined by Rogers et al. (25Rogers M. Taraboulos A. Scott M. Groth D. Prusiner S.B. Glycobiology. 1990; 1: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) for their effects on trafficking of hamster PrP in CV1 cells. In view of the evidence cited above that absence of glycosylation may improve PrP as a substrate for generation of PrPSc, we were particularly interested in determining whether the abnormally glycosylated molecules would convert spontaneously to a PrPSc-like state. This question was also a natural one to ask, given our previous work in which we showed that PrP molecules carrying other disease-associated mutations acquire all of the biochemical hallmarks of PrPScwhen expressed in cultured Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (11Lehmann S. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24589-24597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 23Lehmann S. Harris D.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 11604-11612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We report here that mutation of either one or both of the consensus sites for N-glycosylation induced PrP to acquire all of the biochemical properties of PrPSc. Surprisingly, even wild-type PrP acquired some of these properties, although to a more limited extent, when glycosylation was inhibited with tunicamycin.DISCUSSIONN-Linked glycosylation of PrP is likely to play a critical role in prion biology, based on recent evidence that this modification may be a marker of prion strain diversity (20Parchi P. Castellani R. Capellari S. Ghetti B. Young K. Chen S.G. Farlow M. Dickson D.W. Sima A.A.F. Trojanowski J.Q. Petersen R.B. Gambetti P. Ann.

A. 1994; 91: 2839-2842Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), and that an inherited form of spongiform encephalopathy is associated with mutational inactivation of one of the two consensus sites forN-glycosylation (18Nitrini, R., Rosemberg, S., Passos-Bueno, M. R., Iughetti, P., Papadopoulos, M., Teixeira-Silva, L. S., Carrilho, P. M., Caramelli, P., Albrecht, S., Zatz, M., and LeBlanc, A. C. (1996)Neurobiol. Aging , 17, (suppl.) S160.Google Scholar). To explore the role ofN-glycosylation in PrP metabolism, we have carried out a detailed analysis of transfected CHO cells that express abnormally glycosylated forms of PrP, generated either by substitution of alanine for threonine in one or both of the N-X-T consensus sites, or by synthesis in the presence of tunicamycin. We report here that PrPs carrying glycosylation site mutations display all of the biochemical properties of PrPSc, and that wild-type PrP synthesized in the presence of tunicamycin exhibits a subset of these properties to a limited extent. Our results suggest that the PrP molecule has an intrinsic tendency, promoted by the absence ofN-linked glycans, to become detergent-insoluble, PIPLC non-releasable, and hydrophobic, but that these properties do not become prominent unless the protein is converted to the PrPSc state as a result of mutation.Biosynthesis and Trafficking of Abnormally Glycosylated PrPWe first characterized the metabolism and localization of PrP molecules lacking one or both N-linked oligosaccharide chains. Our results suggest that the two glycosylation consensus sites are not equivalent in terms of the effect that mutagenesis of these sites has on the trafficking of PrP. Inactivation of the site surrounding asparagine 180 (in T182A moPrP) blocked delivery of the protein to the cell surface. The intracellular compartment where this protein resides remains to be determined, but it is likely to be proximal to the mid-Golgi stack since the mutant protein remained sensitive to endo H. The double mutant T182A/T198A moPrP was also absent from the cell surface, and it is possible that its transit is blocked at the same point as T182A moPrP.In contrast, mutation of the site surrounding asparagine 196 (in T198A moPrP) reduced, but did not completely prevent, delivery of the protein to the plasma membrane. Based on the relative surface staining intensity of cells expressing T198A moPrP compared with cells expressing equivalent amounts of wild-type moPrP (Fig. 4), and on the fact that only about 30% of the T198A protein was susceptible to trypsin digestion compared with about 60% for the wild-type protein (Table I), we estimate that only about half of the mutant molecules reach the cell surface after synthesis. The localization of those molecules that fail to reach the plasma membrane remains to be determined, but it is likely that they reside in a compartment distal to the mid-Golgi, based on the fact that virtually all of the mutant molecules became endo H-resistant.Treatment of cells with tunicamycin did not appreciably affect delivery of wild-type moPrP to the cell surface. This indicates thatN-linked glycans are not necessary for normal biosynthetic trafficking of PrP. This conclusion, which was also reached by Petersenet al. (12Petersen R.B. Parchi P. Richardson S.L. Urig C.B. Gambetti P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12661-12668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), is consistent with the observation that an unglycosylated form of wild-type PrP is often detectable on the plasma membrane in the absence of any inhibitors (Fig. 6 C, lanes 1and 2; see also Ref. 10Caughey B. Race R.E. Ernst D. Buchmeier M.J. Chesebro B. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 175-181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although inhibition of glycosylation causes many glycoproteins to misfold, resulting in their retention and degradation in a pre-Golgi compartment, there are a number of proteins in addition to PrP whose maturation is unaffected by the absence of oligosaccharide modification (14Helenius A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar).Our results on the biosynthesis and trafficking of moPrP glycosylation mutants in CHO cells are similar in most respects to those of Rogerset al. (25Rogers M. Taraboulos A. Scott M. Groth D. Prusiner S.B. Glycobiology. 1990; 1: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) who analyzed a homologous set of hamster PrP mutants in CV1 cells. In contrast to us, however, they failed to detect any of the mutant proteins on the cell surface, and they speculated that the absence of oligosaccharide chains per se was responsible for this effect. This contention seems unlikely in light of our demonstration that T198A moPrP as well as wild-type moPrP in the presence of tunicamycin both reach the cell surface.Scrapie-like Properties of Aberrantly Glycosylated PrPWe found that T182A, T198A, and T182A/T198A moPrPs each exhibited three of the four operational properties that we have used previously to define the PrPSc state: 1) insolubility in Triton/deoxycholate; 2) production of a protease-resistant core fragment after digestion with proteinase K; and 3) retention in the Triton X-114 detergent phase after PIPLC treatment. T198A moPrP was the only mutant that could be assayed for the fourth property, retention on the cell surface after PIPLC treatment, since this was the only one of the proteins that was expressed on the plasma membrane, and it was found to be PIPLC non-releasable. The T182A mutation is homologous to one in human PrP that has recently been found in a Brazilian family with an inherited spongiform encephalopathy (18Nitrini, R., Rosemberg, S., Passos-Bueno, M. R., Iughetti, P., Papadopoulos, M., Teixeira-Silva, L. S., Carrilho, P. M., Caramelli, P., Albrecht, S., Zatz, M., and LeBlanc, A. C. (1996)Neurobiol. Aging , 17, (suppl.) S160.Google Scholar). The fact that a moPrP molecule carrying this mutation acquires PrPSc-like properties is therefore consistent with our previous work showing that six other disease-related mutations, but not a non-pathogenic amino acid substitution, induced a PrPSc-like state when expressed in cultured CHO cells (23Lehmann S. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1633-1637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 35Harris D.A. Lehmann S. Iqbal K. Winblad B. Nishimura T. Takeda M. Wisniewski H.M. Alzheimer's Disease: Biology, Diagnosis and Therapeutics. John Wiley and Sons, Chichester1997: 631-643Google Scholar). We do not yet know whether mutant PrPs synthesized in CHO cells are infectious. Although no individuals carrying a mutation homologous to T198A have yet been described, we would predict that such individuals might be found in the future.Our results have implications for the cellular location at which PrPSc is generated. The fact that T182A and T182A/T198A moPrPs are converted to a PrPSc-like state without being expressed on the cell surface indicates that transit to the plasma membrane is not necessary for the conversion process. This conclusion is consistent with our recent studies of another mutant PrP which indicate that the earliest step in generation of PrPScoccurs in the endoplasmic reticulum during or very soon after synthesis of the polypeptide chain, and is manifested by retention of the protein in the Triton X-114 phase after PIPLC treatment (27Daude N. Lehmann S. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11604-11612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This change is followed later by acquisition of detergent insolubility and protease resistance, steps that normally take place subsequent to arrival of the newly synthesized protein at the plasma membrane, but which can occur intracellularly in cells treated with brefeldin A. The conclusion that emerges from our studies, as well as ones using scrapie-infected neuroblastoma cells (15Taraboulos A. Rogers M. Borchelt D.R. McKinley M.P. Scott M. Serban D. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8262-8266Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), is that PrPSc production can occur in any of several cellular compartments, depending on the protein being expressed and the presence of pharmacological agents. It is noteworthy that none of six other disease-related mutations that we have analyzed previously markedly altered the efficiency with which PrP is delivered to the cell surface (11Lehmann S. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24589-24597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 23Lehmann S. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1633-1637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 35Harris D.A. Lehmann S. Iqbal K. Winblad B. Nishimura T. Takeda M. Wisniewski H.M. Alzheimer's Disease: Biology, Diagnosis and Therapeutics. John Wiley and Sons, Chichester1997: 631-643Google Scholar). These mutations include five single amino acid substitutions and one insertion, covering both N-terminal and C-terminal halves of the molecule. This comparison suggests that defects in biosynthetic trafficking are not a general feature of pathologic mutations in PrP, and are not necessary for generation of PrPSc. For the T198A mutant, which exhibits only a partial block in cell surface delivery, it may be the retained or non-retained molecules, or both, that are converted to the PrPSc state.Surprisingly, wild-type PrP synthesized in the presence of tunicamycin displayed several biochemical attributes of PrPSc, although less prominently than the mutant PrPs. We were unable to detect any protease-resistant PrP in tunicamycin-treated cells, although ∼15% of the protein was detergent-insoluble after ultracentrifugation and hydrophobic in the Triton X-114 assay, and most of it was retained on the cell surface after treatment with PIPLC. These results raise the question of whether some of the PrP synthesized in the presence of tunicamycin might have undergone the conformational transition to authentic PrPSc. We think that this is unlikely for at least two reasons. First, unglycosylated wild-type PrP constitutes 5–10% of the PrP synthesized in cells normally, and it would be surprising if these molecules represented PrPSc. This small population of unglycosylated PrP in control cells was poorly released by PIPLC (Fig. 6 C, lanes 1 and 2), suggesting that it is similar to PrP synthesized in tunicamycin-treated cells. (We have not tested these molecules for other PrPSc-like properties.) Second, wild-type PrP molecules from tunicamycin-treated cells are clearly less “scrapie-like” than mutant PrP molecules. All seven mutant PrPs associated with familial spongiform encephalopathies that we have analyzed in CHO cells thus far (six published previously (23Lehmann S. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1633-1637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 35Harris D.A. Lehmann S. Iqbal K. Winblad B. Nishimura T. Takeda M. Wisniewski H.M. Alzheimer's Disease: Biology, Diagnosis and Therapeutics. John Wiley and Sons, Chichester1997: 631-643Google Scholar) and T182A presented here) produce protease-resistant fragments, and they all display a degree of detergent-insolubility and hydrophobicity in Triton X-114 that are greater than those of wild-type PrP synthesized in the presence of tunicamycin. T182A/T198A moPrP, which carries no N-linked glycans, is also distinct in its trafficking and biochemical properties from unglycosylated wild-type protein made in inhibitor-treated cells. We conclude from these comparisons that alteration of the amino acid sequence changes the state of PrP in a way that inhibition of glycosylation alone does not. We have noted previously that some PrP molecules carrying pathogenic mutations display an altered glycoform distribution, with a shift toward less glycosylated forms (23Lehmann S. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1633-1637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 35Harris D.A. Lehmann S. Iqbal K. Winblad B. Nishimura T. Takeda M. Wisniewski H.M. Alzheimer's Disease: Biology, Diagnosis and Therapeutics. John Wiley and Sons, Chichester1997: 631-643Google Scholar). In light of the discussion here, we would suggest that the PrPSc-like properties of these molecules are determined directly by mutation-induced alterations in protein conformation rather than indirectly via a change in glycosylation state.There are several possible explanations for why PrP from tunicamycin-treated cells displays limited scrapie-like properties. First, it is conceivable that some of the PrP synthesized in these cells has been converted to a state that is intermediate between PrPC and PrPSc. It has been proposed that even normal cells contain sma"

Previous studies have identified the DNA-binding domain (DBD) in the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) as the major region responsible for this repressive activity. Using GR mutants with chimeric DBDs the repressive function was found to be located in the C-terminal zinc finger. As predicted from these results the mineralocorticoid receptor that contains a C-terminal zinc finger identical to that of the GR was also able to repress RelA-dependent transcription. Mutation of a conserved arginine or a lysine in the second zinc finger of the GR DBD (Arg-488 or Lys-490 in the rat GR) abolished the ability of GR to inhibit RelA activity. In contrast, C-terminal zinc finger GR mutants with mutations in the dimerization box or mutations necessary for full transcriptional GR activity were still able to repress RelA-dependent transcription. In addition, we found that the steroid analog ZK98299 known to induce GR transrepression of AP-1 had no inhibitory effect on RelA activity. In summary, these results demonstrate that the inhibition of NF-κB by glucocorticoids involves two critical amino acids in the C-terminal zinc finger of the GR.

Glucocorticoid hormones regulate many different biological processes via a specific intracellular receptor, the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), 1The abbreviations used are: GR, glucocorticoid receptor; GRE, glucocorticoid response element; AR, androgen receptor; DBD, DNA binding domain; LUC, luciferase; MR, mineralocorticoid receptor; PR, progestin receptor; RARα, retinoic acid receptor α; TRβ, thyroid receptor β; PCR, polymerase chain reaction. which is present in most cell types. The GR is a member of the superfamily of nuclear receptors, which all contain three main functional domains (1Carlstedt-Duke J. Wright A. Göttlicher M. Okret S. Gustafsson J.-Å. Felig P. Baxter G.D.

The transcriptional activity of GR is mainly dependent on the τ1 domain localized in the N-terminal part of the protein (3Dahlman-Wright K. Almlöf T. McEwan I. Gustafsson J.-Å. Wright A.P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1619-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 4Hollenberg S.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1988; 55: 899-906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). The highly conserved DBD contains two zinc fingers and in each of them a zinc ion is tetrahedrally coordinating four cysteine residues. One function of the DBD is to discriminate between different response elements, thus determining target genes to be activated (5Zilliacus J. Dahlman-Wright K. Wright A. Gustafsson J.-Å.

Chem. 1992; 267: 24941-24947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This function is achieved by a few amino acids localized in the C-terminal part of the N-terminal zinc finger, the so-called the P box. A second subdomain termed the D box in the N-terminal knuckle of the C-terminal zinc finger has been shown to harbor amino acid residues important for homodimerization (7Dahlman-Wright K. Wright A.P.H. Gustafsson J.-Å. Carlstedt-Duke J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3107-3112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DNA binding of the ligand-activated GR results in an increased rate of formation of transcriptionally competent pre-initiation complexes. This is thought to be achieved by protein-protein interactions between the receptors and different components of the transcriptional machinery (8Beato M. Sanchezpacheco A. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 587-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 9McEwan I.J. Wright A.P.H. Gustafsson J.-Å. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Besides the more well studied transcriptional activation process, the GR can repress transcription via different mechanisms (10Akerblom I.E. Mellon P.L. Parker M.G. Nuclear Hormone Receptors. Academic Press, New York1991: 175-196Google Scholar). The GR has been shown to bind to overlapping DNA response elements for other transcription factors leading to repression (11Drouin J. Sun Y.L.

Inhibition of gene expression by glucocorticoids can also occur in the absence of GR DNA binding. The most well studied system for this is the repression by the GR of genes activated by the AP-1 transcription factor complex. In this case there is evidence for a direct physical association between the proteins present in AP-1 and the GR (14Jonat C. Rahmsdorf H.J. Park K.K. Cato A.C. Gebel S. Ponta H. Herrlich P.

Cell. 1990; 62: 1205-1215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar). Although direct binding of the GR to DNA is not necessary, the DBD has in some cases been shown to be essential for this interaction (15Schüle R. Rangarajan P. Kliewer S. Ransone L.J. Bolado J. Yang N. Verma I.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1990; 62: 1217-1226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the composition of the AP-1 complex determines whether the GR will cause a positive or a negative effect on AP-1 controlled transcription. In addition to the ability of GR to interfere with AP-1 controlled transcription, we and other (17Ray A. Prefontaine K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1995; 15: 943-953Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that the GR also can repress NF-κB signaling. NF-κB is an inducible transcription factor complex that plays an essential role in the inflammatory and immune responses (21Beauerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4602) Google Scholar). It is activated by a diverse range of signals including the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1 as well as phorbol esters, physical or oxidative stress, and bacterial and viral proteins. In most cells the NF-κB is composed of a heterodimer between RelA (p65) and NFKB1 (p50), where the RelA protein is responsible for the transactivation potential. In the non-activated state the NF-κB is sequestered in the cytoplasm through the interaction with the inhibitory protein IκB. During activation, the IκB protein becomes phosphorylated and degrades allowing NF-κB to translocate to the nucleus where it binds to specific DNA elements and subsequently regulates genes involved in inflammation and immune responses (22Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1988; 53: 211-217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar, 23Traenckner E.B. Pahl H.L. Henkel T. Schmidt K.N. Wilk S. Baeuerle P.A.

Glucocorticoids have potent immunosuppressive effects and are commonly used in the clinic to suppress different immunological and inflammatory responses. Different molecular mechanisms have been suggested to be involved in this process including inhibition of AP-1 and NF-κB (25Cato A.C.B. Wade E. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). In an earlier report (19Caldenhoven E. Liden J. Wissink S. Van de Stolpe A. Raaijmakers J. Koenderman L. Okret S. Gustafsson J.-Å. Van der Saag P.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 401-412Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using transient transfections of GR and NF-κB responsive reporter genes, we have shown a mutual transcriptional inactivation between the GR and the NF-κB protein RelA. Direct DNA binding of GR is not required for the NF-κB repression to occur, since a GR, in which the P box had been mutated so that it no longer recognized a GRE, still was able to repress. Instead we showed that the GR and the RelA can directly or indirectly interact with each other in vitro and mutually interfere with transcriptional activity. Using deletion mutants and chimeric receptors, we demonstrated that the GR DBD is the major GR domain responsible for repression of RelA activity. In addition, an alternative mechanism for glucocorticoid repression of NF-κB activity has been suggested, which involves induction of IκBα by GR leading to the sequestering of NF-κB in the cytoplasm (26Scheinman R.I. Cogswell P.C. Lofquist A.K. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1995; 270: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (1601) Google Scholar, 27Auphan N. DiDonato J.A. Rosette C. Helmberg A. Karin M. Science. 1995; 270: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (2169) Google Scholar). In this report we investigated the subdomain and critical amino acids in the GR DBD involved in glucocorticoid repression of the NF-κB protein RelA. In addition, we investigated the role of GR dimerization and transactivation for the repression of RelA activity. Finally, we analyzed the ability of glucocorticoid antagonists to cause repression of NF-κB activity. Deep Vent® DNA polymerase and T4 DNA ligase were from New England Biolabs. Media, antibiotics, fetal bovine serum, and Lipofectin® were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Dexamethasone and aldosterone was obtained from Sigma.

GR mutants with chimeric DBDs were constructed using the PCR-ligation-PCR protocol (31Ali S.A. Steinkasserer A. BioTechniques. 1995; 18: 746-750PubMed Google Scholar). For this purpose the DBDs of GR and thyroid receptor β (TRβ) were separated into three parts as follows: the N-terminal zinc finger, the linker region between the two fingers, and the C-terminal zinc finger, and termed ggg or ttt, respectively (the first, second, and third lowercase letter representing the N-terminal zinc finger, linker region, and C-terminal zinc finger region of GR (g) or TRβ (t), respectively). The expression plasmids GRnx (32Giguère V. Ong E.S. Segui P. Evans R.M. Nature. 1987; 330: 624-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (1538) Google Scholar) and GTG (33Thompson C.C. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3494-3498Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) in this report named GgggG and GtttG, respectively, were used for the amplification of the different DBD regions. The first PCR reaction contained 1 ng of plasmid DNA, 250 μm each dNTP, 1 μmprimers, 1 × reaction buffer, and 1 unit of Deep Vent® DNA polymerase. The PCR program contained a 30-s denaturation step at 94 °C, 30 s annealing time at 56 °C, and a 30-s extension at 72 °C, for 25 cycles. Plasmid DNA templates and pairs of primers were as follows: PCR-1, GgggG, 5′-AAGCCCCAGCATGAGACCAGAT-3′ (primer A) and 5′-GCAGCCTTCACACGTGATA-CAG-3′; PCR-2, GgggG, primer A and 5′-ACATAGGTAATTGTGCTGTCCTTCC-3′; PCR-3, GgggG, 5′-GCTGGAAGGAATGATTGCATC-3′ and 5′-ACTCCTGTAGTGGCCTGCTGAA-3′ (primer B); PCR-4, GtttG, 5′-AAGGGTTTCTTTAGAAGGACCATTC-3′ and 5′-TACCAGGATTTTCAGAG-GTTTC-3′; PCR-5, GtttG, 5′-AAATATGAAGGAAAATGTGTCATAGACA-3′ and primer B; PCR-6, GtttG, primer A and 5′-ACAGGAATAGGATGGATGGAGATT-3′. After phosphorylation, 5 μl of PCR-1, -2, and -3 were mixed with 5 μl of PCR-4, -5, and -6, respectively, and ligated with 400 units of T4 DNA ligase for 15 min at room temperature. The resulting fragments were amplified in a second PCR reaction using primers A and B and under the same conditions as for the first PCR reaction. The PCR products were digested withNotI and XhoI and inserted into the GRnx expression plasmid instead of the wild type GR DBD to create the chimeric GR/TRβ-DBD mutants GgttG, GggtG, and GttgG. The GgtgG mutant was constructed by using the GgttG expression plasmid as template DNA instead of the GgggG in the PCR-6. The rat GR mutants R488Q, K490E, and N491A were created by digesting the corresponding yeast expression vectors (34Schena M. Freedman L.P. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1590-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) with NcoI and PstI, and the isolated GR fragments containing the mutation were subcloned into the corresponding sites of the mammalian rat GR expression vector 6RGR (35Godowski P.J. Picard D. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1988; 241: 812-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) after removing the wild type sequence. All constructs were verified by sequencing. Green monkey COS-1 cells were grown in 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 7.5% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cells were plated in 24-well multidishes at a density of 3 × 104cells/well 24 h before transfection. Cells were transiently transfected using Lipofectin® according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. In transrepression experiments, cells were co-transfected with 200 ng of 3xNF-κB(IC)tk-LUC reporter plasmid, 2.5 ng of RelA expression plasmid, and 25 ng of wild type or mutant GR expression plasmid. In the transactivation experiments, cells were co-transfected with 200 ng of (GRE)2tk-LUC and 25 ng of wild type or mutant GR expression plasmid. Following overnight exposure of the cells to the DNA/lipid mixture, fresh medium was added, and cells were incubated in the absence or presence of 1 μmdexamethasone for 24 h. Cells were lysed and luciferase activity was determined. COS-1 cells were plated in 10-cm cell culture dishes and transfected with 1 μg of expression plasmids for wild type or mutant GR as described above. Cells were pelleted, resuspended in 200 μl of ETG buffer (1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10% (v/v) glycerol) containing 0.4m KCl, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm dithiothreitol and homogenized with a micro-Dounce homogenizer by 20 strokes. The homogenates were centrifuged at 265,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined, and supernatants were mixed with 1 volume of 2 × SDS buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 200 mm dithiothreitol, 4% SDS, 0.2% bromphenol blue, 20% (v/v) glycerol), and 10 μg of total protein was separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroblotted to a C-Extra Hybond membrane (Amersham Corp.). Immunodetection was carried out using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit from Amersham Corp. after incubation with the monoclonal antibody number 7 (28Okret S. Wikström A.-C. Wrange O. Andersson B. Gustafsson J.-Å. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1609-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) followed by secondary horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse antibody (Amersham Corp.) according to the suggested protocols. We and others (19Caldenhoven E. Liden J. Wissink S. Van de Stolpe A. Raaijmakers J. Koenderman L. Okret S. Gustafsson J.-Å. Van der Saag P.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 401-412Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Scheinman R.I. Gualberto A. Jewell C.M. Cidlowski J.A. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 943-953Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have previously shown that the DBD of the GR is of crucial importance for the ability of GR to interfere with the NF-κB-mediated response, since deletion of the GR DBD or replacement of the GR DBD with the corresponding TRβ DBD abolished repression. To further determine if a particular region in the GR DBD is responsible for the functional interference with NF-κB activity, GR mutants were created in which individual parts of the DBD were replaced by the corresponding regions of the TRβ DBD. For this purpose the GR DBD was divided into three parts, the N-terminal zinc finger, the linker region, and the C-terminal zinc finger, respectively (Fig. 1 A). The ability of the different GR mutants to repress NF-κB was tested on RelA-mediated transactivation of a luciferase reporter gene controlled by three NF-κB sites from the human intercellular adhesion molecule-1 promoter and a minimal thymidine kinase promoter (3xNF-κB(IC)tk-LUC) in COS-1 cells. Exchanging the whole GR DBD with the DBD from TRβ (GtttG) resulted in a 70–80% loss of repressive activity in comparison to the wild type GR (GgggG) (Fig. 1 B). Exchanging the C-terminal zinc finger alone (GggtG) or the linker region together with the C-terminal zinc finger (GgttG) with the corresponding region of TRβ DBD destroyed the ability of the GR to inhibit RelA-mediated transactivation to a similar degree as for GtttG (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, exchanging the linker region alone (GgtgG) did not affect the repressive activity of GR. This suggested that this region was dispensable and that the C-terminal zinc finger was critical for the repression to occur. The importance of the C-terminal zinc finger was confirmed with the GttgG mutant, since most of the repressive activity was maintained when the C-terminal zinc finger alone was from the GR (Fig. 1 B). These results demonstrate that the contribution of the GR DBD to the functional interference between GR and RelA is localized in the C-terminal zinc finger of the GR. Since the amino acid sequences of the C-terminal zinc finger of the GR and the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) are identical (36Arriza J.L. Weinberger C. Cerelli G. Glaser T.M. Handelin B.L. Housman D.E. Evans R.M. Science. 1987; 237: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar), this would suggest that the MR is able to repress RelA-mediated transactivation. Indeed, in transfection experiments performed as above, the MR activated by 10 nm aldosterone repressed RelA-mediated transactivation as efficiently as the GR (data not shown). This also shows that the four amino acids outside the second zinc finger that differ between the MR and GR DBDs are not critical for the repressive capacity. A major function for the C-terminal zinc finger in the GR DBD is to contribute to receptor homodimerization, a prerequisite for the receptor to bind DNA and transactivate efficiently (7Dahlman-Wright K. Wright A.P.H. Gustafsson J.-Å. Carlstedt-Duke J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3107-3112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Umesono K. Evans R.M. Cell. 1989; 57: 1139-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). This function is achieved by the D box region which is localized in the N-terminal knuckle of the C-terminal zinc finger. Since dimerization and NF-κB repression functions are localized in the same zinc finger of the GR, we tested if GR dimerization is a prerequisite for repression of Rel A transactivation. For this purpose we used a GR mutant (D4X) in which three amino acids out of five in the D box have been mutated (Fig. 2 A) (38Heck S. Kullman M. Gast A. Ponta H. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herllich P. Cato A.C.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4087-4095Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Transfection experiments with the D4X mutant demonstrated that mutations in the D box did not impair the ability of GR to repress RelA transcriptional activity (Fig. 2 B). This shows that receptor dimerization is not a prerequisite for GR-mediated repression of RelA. As previously shown, the D4X mutant harbored no significant transcriptional activity (Fig. 2 C). Previous studies have shown that in addition to GR, the estrogen receptor, progestin receptor (PR), and the androgen receptor (AR) also repress NF-κB activity (39Stein B. Yang M.X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4971-4979Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Kalkhoven E. Wissink S. van der Saag P.T. van der Burg B. J. Biol.

In contrast, the TRβ, the retinoic acid receptor α isoform (RARα), and the ecdysone receptor are unable to repress RelA-mediated transactivation (19Caldenhoven E. Liden J. Wissink S. Van de Stolpe A. Raaijmakers J. Koenderman L. Okret S. Gustafsson J.-Å. Van der Saag P.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 401-412Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 2J. Liden, unpublished observations. An amino acid sequence comparison of the C-terminal zinc fingers of repressive and non-repressive receptors revealed that the arginine and the lysine in position 488 and 490 in the rat GR are conserved only in the repressing receptors, suggesting an important role for these amino acids in the repressive activity (Table I). To test the importance of these amino acids for GR-mediated repression of RelA activity, we exchanged these amino acids in the rat GR to a glutamine and a glutamic acid, respectively (R488Q and K490E, respectively), and tested the ability of the mutated GRs for their ability to repress RelA transcriptional activity in COS-1 cells. Transfection experiments showed that both GR mutants, R488Q and K490E, had lost almost all their repressive activity as compared with the wild type GR (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, the GR mutants N491A and LS7 with substitutions of amino acids that are not conserved among the repressive receptors (Fig. 2 A, Table I) had retained their ability to repress RelA activity. None of these C-terminal zinc finger GR mutants except the N491A mutant could transactivate the (GRE)2tk-LUC reporter gene. The N491A mutant retained approximately 50% transcriptional activity as compared with the wild type GR (Fig. 2 C). The inability of the R488Q and K490E mutant to repress the RelA activity was not due to poor expression of the receptor proteins, since Western blot analysis of the transfected cells showed that the expression levels of the mutated receptors were the same as for the wild type GR (Fig. 2 D). These results demonstrate that the arginine and the lysine residues in positions 488 and 490 in the rat GR (corresponding to positions 469 and 471 in the human GR) are critical for GR-mediated inhibition of RelA-dependent transactivation.Table IComparison of the amino acid sequences in the tips of the second zinc finger of RelA repressive and some non-RelA repressive nuclear receptorsReceptorsC-terminal zinc finger tipRelA repressionGRCIIDKIRRKNCYesMRYesPRVYesART FYesERN SYes RARαN VT NRNoTRβV VT NQNoEcdREMNMYM RKNoThe amino acid sequences for receptors other than the GR are only given if they differ from the GR sequence.

The steroid analogs RU486 and ZK98299 are antagonists of GR transactivation but are able to stimulate GR transrepression of AP-1 activity (38Heck S. Kullman M. Gast A. Ponta H. Rahmsdorf H.J.

We tested if the steroid analog ZK98299 could inhibit NF-κB activity in analogy to RU486. As shown in Fig. 3 A, 10 nm RU486 repressed RelA activity to a level that was approximately 40% the repression obtained with 10 nm dexamethasone. In contrast, no repression was observed with 10 or 100 nm ZK98299. This was not due to the lack of biological activity of ZK98299, since it could inhibit GR transactivation as efficiently as RU486 (Fig. 3 B). These results suggest that RU486 and ZK98299 induce GR to states with different competence to repress RelA activity. The recent discovery of an inhibitory cross-talk between the NF-κB and GR signaling pathways has provided one molecular mechanism by which glucocorticoids exert their potent anti-inflammatory effects (17Ray A.

Thus, all steroid receptors are able to repress NF-κB in contrast to nuclear receptors from the RAR/TR subfamily, suggesting that a distinct structural determinant within the steroid receptor subfamily is responsible for the repression of NF-κB. The importance of the DBD in these receptors for the repressive activity has been demonstrated in several previous studies, where it was shown that deletion or replacement of the whole DBD resulted in the loss of the repressive activity (19Caldenhoven E. Liden J. Wissink S. Van de Stolpe A. Raaijmakers J. Koenderman L. Okret S. Gustafsson J.-Å. Van der Saag P.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 401-412Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Scheinman R.I.

To identify which subdomain in the GR DBD is responsible for the repression of RelA activity, we have used GR mutants in which various parts of the GR DBD have been replaced with the corresponding regions of the non-repressive TRβ DBD. Our results demonstrate that most of the repression of NF-κB activity could be attributed to the C-terminal zinc finger of the GR DBD. This localizes a new function to this finger, which previously has been known mainly to harbor functions important for dimerization and transactivation (7Dahlman-Wright K. Wright A.P.H. Gustafsson J.-Å. Carlstedt-Duke J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3107-3112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Umesono K. Evans R.M. Cell. 1989; 57: 1139-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). Analysis of two C-terminal zinc finger GR mutants with substitutions of the arginine (amino acids 488 in the rat GR) and lysine (amino acids 490 in the rat GR) to a glutamine and a glutamic acid, respectively, confirmed the importance of this finger and identified two critical basic residues for repression of NF-κB activity. No particular function has previously been attributed to the arginine residue 488 (corresponding to amino acid 469 in the human GR) with regard to dimerization or interaction with DNA, since substitution of this residue to a glutamine did not impair DNA binding (34Schena M. Freedman L.P. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1590-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The lysine residue 490 (corresponding to amino acid 471 in the human GR), on the other hand, is involved in making contact with the phosphate backbone (43Luisi B.F. Xu W.X. Otwinowski Z. Freedman L.P. Yamamoto K.R. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1991; 352: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1235) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these two residues are conserved only in the C-terminal zinc finger of steroid receptors, consistent with the observation that only members of this subfamily of nuclear receptors seem to be able to repress NF-κB. Mutation of either of these two amino acids resulted in a significantly decreased transcriptional activity of GR (this study and Ref. 34Schena M. Freedman L.P. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1590-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). However, no correlation between transcriptional activation by GR and transrepression of RelA activity exists, since the two GR mutants D4X and LS7, which lack most of their transcriptional activity, were fully active with regard to repression of RelA activity. This is also in line with previous data showing that GR mutants with a deletion of the major transactivation domain τ1 or a substitution of the P box by that of the TRβ were still repressive (19Caldenhoven E. Liden J. Wissink S. Van de Stolpe A. Raaijmakers J. Koenderman L. Okret S. Gustafsson J.-Å. Van der Saag P.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 401-412Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Scheinman R.I. Gualberto A. Jewell C.M. Cidlowski J.A. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 943-953Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, glucocorticoid induction of the NF-κB inhibitor IκBα which previously has been suggested as a mechanism controlling NF-κB inhibition by glucocorticoids cannot explain why transcriptionally deficient GR mutants can still repress NF-κB (26Scheinman R.I. Cogswell P.C. Lofquist A.K. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1995; 270: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (1601) Google Scholar, 27Auphan N. DiDonato J.A. Rosette C. Helmberg A. Karin M. Science. 1995; 270: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (2169) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown in monocytic U937 cells that inhibition of ICAM-1 gene expression by glucocorticoids occurs in the absence of protein synthesis (44Van de Stolpe A. Caldenhoven E. Raaijmakers J.A. Van der Saag P.T. Koenderman L. Am. J. Respir. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1993; 8: 340-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). More recently, several studies also reported that NF-κB could be inhibited in osteoblast U2-OS cells (39Stein B. Yang M.X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4971-4979Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), alveolar epithelium-like A549/8 cells (45Kleinert H. Euchenhofer C. Ihrig-Biedert I. Forstermann U. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 15-21PubMed Google Scholar), kidney epithelial NRK-52E cells (46Ohtsuka T. Kubota A. Hirano T. Watanabe K. Yoshida H. Tsurufuji M. Iizuka Y. Konishi K. Tsurufuji S. J. Biol.

Winkler H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19612-19616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) in the absence of IκBα induction. Collectively, these data argue for a general mechanism for glucocorticoid inhibition of NF-κB which involves GR transrepression via protein-protein interaction between non-DNA binding GR and NF-κB transcription factors as initially suggested (17Ray A. Prefontaine K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 752-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar, 19Caldenhoven E. Liden J. Wissink S. Van de Stolpe A. Raaijmakers J. Koenderman L.

Biol. 1995; 15: 943-953Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, induction of IκBα may play a more significant role in some specific cell types such as lymphocytes (47Brostjan C. Anrather J. Csizmadia V. Stroka D. Soares M. Bach F.H. Winkler H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19612-19616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Several results reported here together with previous observations indicate that the mechanisms by which GR inhibits NF-κB and AP-1 signaling pathways are different. Most notable is that MR, as reported in this study, is an efficient inhibitor of NF-κB, whereas it is known to be a very weak repressor of AP-1 activity (48Cato A.C.B. König H. Ponta H. Herrlich P. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 43: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 49Pearce D. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1993; 259: 1161-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). In contrast, RARα is unable to repress NF-κB activity but is able to inhibit AP-1 (19Caldenhoven E. Liden J. Wissink S. Van de Stolpe A. Raaijmakers J. Koenderman L. Okret S. Gustafsson J.-Å. Van der Saag P.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 401-412Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 50Schüle R. Rangarajan P. Yang N. Kliewer S. Ransone L.J. Bolado J. Verma I.M. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6092-6096Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). These differences may be related to the fact that although the GR DBD is critical for repression of both NF-κB and AP-1, different parts of the DBD contribute to this effect. This is supported by the data from Heck et al. (38Heck S. Kullman M. Gast A. Ponta H. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herllich P. Cato A.C.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4087-4095Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar) who demonstrated that point mutations within the N-terminal zinc finger of GR could severely impair AP-1 repression, whereas our results indicate that this zinc finger does not play a significant role in the inhibition of NF-κB activity. In addition, previous data showed that GR mutants with deletion of the N-terminal domain could efficiently inhibit NF-κB but not AP-1 (15Schüle R. Rangarajan P. Kliewer S. Ransone L.J. Bolado J. Yang N. Verma I.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1990; 62: 1217-1226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar, 19Caldenhoven E. Liden J. Wissink S. Van de Stolpe A. Raaijmakers J. Koenderman L.

Biol. 1995; 15: 943-953Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has recently been suggested that the mechanism by which GR represses AP-1 involves competition between GR and AP-1 for limiting amounts of the co-activator CBP/p300 (51Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.-C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1996; 85: 403-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1928) Google Scholar). Although, as recently reported, a physical interaction between CBP/p300 and RelA also occurs (52Perkins N.D. Felzien L.K. Betts J.C. Leung K. Beach D.H. Nabel G.J. Science. 1997; 275: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 53Gerritsen M.E. Williams A.J. Neish A.S. Moore S. Shi Y. Collins T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2927-2932Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar), no evidence has yet been reported that GR inhibits NF-κB by competing for the co-activator CBP/p300. However, if this occurs, the mechanism is likely to be different from that of the GR and AP-1 cross-talk, since some receptors such as RAR for instance can interact with CBP/p300 and inhibit AP-1 but have no repressive activity on NF-κB (51Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.-C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1996; 85: 403-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1928) Google Scholar). Finally, by using glucocorticoid antagonists, we also found that ZK98299 is unable to repress NF-κB activity, whereas it has previously been shown that the ZK98299·GR complex is an efficient inhibitor of AP-1 activity (38Heck S. Kullman M. Gast A. Ponta H. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herllich P. Cato A.C.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4087-4095Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). This shows that ligands can exhibit a selectivity with regard to GR transrepression, probably as a consequence of different receptor conformations required for inhibiting various signaling pathways. In conclusion, we have identified two critical residues within the C-terminal zinc finger of the GR DBD that are critical for repression of NF-κB activity. This finding identifies a new function for the GR C-terminal zinc finger. Furthermore, using C-terminal zinc finger GR mutants and antagonists, we further characterized the mechanism by which GR represses NF-κB, and we obtained evidence that the mechanisms by which GR inhibits NF-κB and AP-1 have different features. This knowledge could be very useful in the search for new GR ligands with selective activity for GR transrepression of different signaling pathways. Such ligands could be a useful tool for basic research regarding mechanisms of glucocorticoid action and possibly in clinical use with less side effects. We thank Drs. A. C. B. Cato, K. R. Yamamoto, and R. M. Evans for providing some of the mutant receptors."

In this report we used yeast two-hybrid and in vitro dot blot assays to further examine the requirements for direct interactions between desmoplakin and various IF types.Our results confirm the ability of the DP COOH terminus (DPCT) to interact with at least two regions of the head domain of the type II epidermal keratin K1 and also demonstrate that DPCT can interact with the type III IF family members, vimentin and desmin, as well as simple epithelial keratins. Unlike the situation for type II epidermal keratins, the interaction between DPCT and simple epithelial keratins appears to depend on heterodimerization of the type I and II keratin polypeptides, since both are required to detect an interaction. Furthermore, although the interaction between DPCT and K1 requires the keratin head domain, deletion of this domain from the simple epithelial keratins does not compromise interaction with DPCT. The interaction between DPCT and type III or simple epithelial keratins also appeared to be less robust than that between DPCT and K1. In the case of K8/K18, however, the interaction as assessed by yeast two-hybrid assays increased 9-fold when a serine located in a protein kinase A consensus phosphorylation site 23 residues from the end of DP was altered to a glycine.

By anchoring IF at sites of strong intercellular adhesion, desmosomes create a transcellular cytoskeletal network that is thought to confer mechanical integrity to the tissues where they reside. It is not surprising, therefore, that these junctions are particularly prominent in tissues experiencing mechanical stress such as epidermis, where they interact with IF networks comprising K5/K14 and K1/K10 keratin pairs. Desmosomes are also found in a wide variety of other tissues, including simple epithelia expressing the K8/K18 keratin pair, myocardial cells expressing desmin, and the arachnoid and pia of meninges and dendritic reticulum cells of lymph nodes, both of which express vimentin (6Schwarz M.A. Owaribe K.

Transient transfections of cDNAs encoding polypeptides containing the COOH-terminal domain of DP suggested that this domain is able to associate with keratin IF networks in a number of cultured cell lines, including COS-7 and HeLa, and vimentin IF networks in mesenchymal cells (23Stappenbeck T.S.

More recently, a bacterially expressed recombinant form of DPCT was demonstrated to interact directly with type II epidermal keratins in vitro, and this association was dependent on the presence of sequences in the N-terminal head domain of K5 (25Kouklis P.D. Hutton E. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1049-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). However, interactions of DPCT with either simple epithelial keratins (K8/K18) or vimentin were not observed in this latter study, in contrast to the transfection studies discussed above (23Stappenbeck T.S. Bornslaeger E.A. Corcoran C.M. Luu H.H. Virata M.L.A. Green K.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 691-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The question, therefore, is whether DP interactions with nonepidermal IF, which in fact are found in many instances in nature, are fundamentally different from those between DP and epidermal IF proteins. Specifically, do DP and nonepidermal IF interact directly, or are other intermediary molecules involved?In the present study, we have employed the yeast two-hybrid system (26Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4822) Google Scholar) to directly compare the ability of DPCT to bind to type II epidermal keratins, nonepidermal keratins, and the type III IF polypeptides vimentin and desmin. Furthermore, we have dissected in detail the mechanisms underlying these associations. Consistent with the in vitro binding data reported by Kouklis et al. (25Kouklis P.D. Hutton E. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1049-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), our results suggest that DPCT interacts with the type II epidermal keratin, K1, and that this association depends on the presence of the K1 NH2 terminus. We also show for the first time that DPCT can interact directly with nonepidermal keratins and type III IF polypeptides. Our data demonstrate that, unlike type II epidermal keratins, which can interact directly with DPCT in the absence of a type I partner, the simple epithelial keratins require the presence of both partner polypeptides to interact with DP. The interaction between K8/K18 and DPCT, but not that between K1 and DP, is enhanced by altering a single serine 23 residues from the very COOH terminus of DP to a glycine. These data strongly suggest that DP can interact directly with all IF types examined in this study. Importantly, however, the interactions between DP and different IF types are apparently facilitated and regulated by fundamentally different mechanisms at the molecular level.DISCUSSIONThe results presented here provide strong confirmation of previous transfection and in vitro biochemical studies demonstrating that DPCT interacts directly with IF (23Stappenbeck T.S.

Also consistent with the previously reported formation of desmoplakin I homodimers (21O'Keefe E.J. Erickson H.P. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8310-8318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the DP rod domain dimerizes as assessed by two-hybrid analysis. Most importantly, however, these studies have extended our current understanding of DP/IF interactions by revealing that DP interacts with different types of IF by fundamentally different mechanisms.DPCT Interacts Directly with all Types of IFs TestedAn interaction between DP and a type II epidermal keratin (K1 in this study) was observed using the two-hybrid approach, confirming previous biochemical studies that employed in vitro overlay and filter binding assays (25Kouklis P.D. Hutton E. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1049-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). We were also able to detect direct interactions between DPCT and type III IF proteins, vimentin and desmin, as well as simple epithelial keratins, K8/K18. These results are consistent with the transient transfection data of Stappenbeck and Green (24Stappenbeck T.S. Green K.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1197-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and Stappenbeck et al. (23Stappenbeck T.S. Bornslaeger E.A. Corcoran C.M. Luu H.H. Virata M.L.A. Green K.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 691-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), demonstrating that DPCT aligns with IF networks comprising these IF types.The results of the present study provide possible explanations for the lack of observed association between DPCT and either simple epithelial keratins or type III IF proteins in previous in vitrobiochemical analyses (25Kouklis P.D. Hutton E. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1049-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). First, our results suggest that in the case of simple epithelial keratins, the type I and type II partner proteins must both be present for an interaction with DPCT to take place. The Kouklis study did not test this possibility, since the experiments were carried out on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis-separated proteins.A second possible explanation may lie in the relative strength of interaction between DP and IF proteins of different types. Transformations with type III IF proteins and DPCT (Fig. 9) yielded β-galactosidase activities approximately half of that obtained for transformations with the type II epidermal keratin, K1 (Fig. 2). Although, strictly speaking, reporter gene activities in two-hybrid assays do not vary linearly with strengths of interaction, they generally can be used to compare strengths among interactions of a similar type, such as those involving variants of a class of proteins (41Estojak J. Brent R. Golemis E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5820-5829Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Taken in this context, interactions between DPCT and type III IF proteins may be significantly weaker than those between DPCT and epidermal keratins and could have escaped detection inin vitro binding assays. Indeed, robust alignment of DP with vimentin IF networks in transient transfection assays requires the DP rod domain (23Stappenbeck T.S. Bornslaeger E.A. Corcoran C.M. Luu H.H. Virata M.L.A. Green K.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 691-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 24Stappenbeck T.S. Green K.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1197-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), suggesting that the interaction between full-length DP and vimentin IF in vivo may be strengthened considerably by the formation of DP coiled-coil dimers. In this light, it is perhaps not surprising that a vimentin-DPCT interaction was not detected in the Kouklis study.Different IF Types Interact with DP via Distinct Sequences in Different IF DomainsThe yeast two-hybrid data presented here suggest that the mechanisms by which type II epidermal keratins and simple epithelial keratins or type III IF proteins interact with DPCT are fundamentally different. That is, type II epidermal keratins interact with DPCT via sequences in the NH2-terminal head domain of a single keratin polypeptide chain, whereas simple epithelial keratins (K8/K18) interact via sequences in the rod domain. In the case of K8/K18, the central rod regions are sufficient to interact with DPCT but must be co-expressed, suggesting that the interaction interface requires the tertiary structure of the α-helical coiled-coil. Type III proteins may use a similar mechanism, since short regions of the vimentin rod domain, but not the NH2-terminal head domain, interact with DPCT (data not shown).Previous work defined the importance of the K5 head domain in the interaction with DPCT (25Kouklis P.D. Hutton E. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1049-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The peptide sequence essential for this interaction contains the KSIS motif found in all epidermal type II keratins, but this motif is in fact absent in the simple epithelial K8, vimentin, and type I keratins. Here we confirm using both in vitro dot blot assays and the yeast two-hybrid assay that like K5, the type II epidermal keratin K1 interacts with DPCT via its NH2-terminal head domain. We show further that a peptide containing the comparable KSIS sequence effectively competes for K1's interaction with purified native DP (Fig. 3). Thus, this region appears to have general importance for the interaction of type II keratins expressed in stratified squamous epithelia with DP. Furthermore, using both peptide inhibition (Fig. 3) and two-hybrid analyses (Fig. 4), we found that the H1 region, which is downstream of the KSIS peptide but still part of the NH2-terminal domain, also contributes to the interaction of K1 with DP (Fig. 3, line 16). Thus, multiple sequences in the NH2 terminus appear to contribute to this interaction.Yeast Two-hybrid Results Support the Existence of Regulatory Sequences within the Last 80 Residues of DPCTThe last 80 residues of DPCT are required for interactions with all keratins assessed in the yeast two-hybrid assay. These data are consistent with previous observations that deletion of the last 68 residues of DP abrogated the ability of DP to align with simple epithelial or epidermal keratins but not vimentin IF networks in cultured cells (23Stappenbeck T.S. Bornslaeger E.A. Corcoran C.M. Luu H.H. Virata M.L.A. Green K.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 691-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). This study also showed that 20 residues (amino acids 2804–2823) at the beginning of this region are required for this association. The importance of these 20 residues in the interaction between K1 and DP was confirmed here using peptide inhibition analysis, in which a peptide containing this region as well as two peptides just upstream effectively inhibited interaction between K1 and native full-length DP (Fig. 3, lines 10–12). These data are consistent with the observation that the 68 terminal amino acids, although required, are not sufficient for alignment with keratin networks in cultured cells (23Stappenbeck T.S. Bornslaeger E.A. Corcoran C.M. Luu H.H. Virata M.L.A. Green K.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 691-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar).The most COOH-terminal 80 residues of DP were not required for its interaction with vimentin (Fig. 9). In fact, deletion of these residues actually enhanced this interaction as assessed by quantitative fluorescence assays. This observation is interesting in light of a recent observation by Nikolic et al. (42Nikolic B. MacNulty E. Mir B. Wiche G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1455-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). These workers reported that the interaction between vimentin and the COOH terminus of the highly related protein, plectin, was dependent on plectin repeat 5, a region equivalent to the B subdomain of DP. This subdomain is retained in our constructs, DPΔC and DPΔ80. In fact, the DP subdomain B by itself also interacts with vimentin in two hybrid assays, albeit at lower levels (data not shown).We previously showed that substitution of a glycine for a serine 23 amino acids from the end of the DP COOH terminus enhances the interaction of DP with simple epithelial keratin networks as assessed by transient transfection assays (32Stappenbeck T.S. Lamb J.A. Corcoran C.M. Green K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29351-29354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with these previous findings, the glycine variant of DPCT exhibited a 9-fold increase in its interaction with K8/K18 in the yeast two-hybrid assay (Fig. 8). It has not been formally demonstrated that SerC23 is phosphorylated in yeast, as was demonstrated for DP expressed in cultured mammalian cells. Nevertheless, phosphorylation of SerC23 is a likely explanation for the observed differences in the behavior of the serine and glycine DPCT variants in the yeast two-hybrid assays. An increase in fluorescence over that observed for wild type DPCT was also observed in transformations with the DPCT.GlyC23 or DPCTΔ80 (which removes the serine residue) and vimentin (Fig. 9), suggesting that this interaction may also be regulated by phosphorylation of SerC23. However, the interaction between DPCT.GlyC23 and K1 was not detectably different as compared with that between DPCT.SerC23 and K1 (compare Fig. 9 with Fig. 2), highlighting another fundamental distinction in how different keratins and DP interact.Although our data suggest that DP can interact directly with all IF types studied so far, it is nevertheless likely that other desmosome-associated proteins are also involved in anchoring IF to the cell surface in vivo. Plakophilin/band 6 has been shown to interact in vitro in overlay assays with IF polypeptides (43Hatzfeld M. Burba M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1959-1972PubMed Google Scholar, 44Kapprell H.-P. Owaribe K. Franke W.W. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1679-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In addition, the desmoplakin family members IFAP300 and plectin, which also interact directly with IF (18Skalli O. Jones J.C.R. Gagescu R. Goldman R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 45Wiche G. Gromov D. Donovan A. Castanon M.J. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 607-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), may enhance the interaction of DP with keratins. 2P. Steinert and R. D. Goldman, unpublished observations. Additional family members such as a 450-kDa human epidermal autoantigen (46Fujiwara S. Kohno K. Iwamatsu A. Naito I. Shinkai H. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 106: 1125-1130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and envoplakin (16Ruhrberg C. Hajibagheri M.A.N. Simon M. Dooley T.P. Watt F.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 715-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) also may prove in the future to play a similar role. Consistent with this idea, Ruhrberg et al. (16Ruhrberg C. Hajibagheri M.A.N. Simon M. Dooley T.P. Watt F.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 715-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated, using high resolution immunogold electron microscopy, that DP and envoplakin are closely associated in situ. In the special case of the assembly of a cornified cell envelope in terminally differentiating squamous epithelia, envoplakin, DP, and type II keratins are closely linked (47Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2021-2030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Moreover, the lysine residue of the KSIS motif is essential for transglutaminase cross-linking (40Kimonis V. DiGiovanna J.J. Yang J.-M. Doyle S.Z. Bale S.J. Compton J.G. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1994; 103: 764-769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 47Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. J. Biol.

N., and Steinert, P. M. (1997)Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A., in press.Google Scholar). Finally, other proteins closely associated with IF at the IF-desmosome interface such as the recently cloned pinin molecule, although not yet shown to associate with DP or IF, are also good candidates for enhancing this interaction (49Ouyang P. Sugrue S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1027-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).The importance of further defining the complex interactions that facilitate linkage of IF to the desmosome in a tissue- and differentiation-specific manner is highlighted by the existence of inherited diseases for which a molecular mechanism has not yet been defined. Already there has been a suggestion that a nonepidermolytic form of the human skin disorder, palmoplantar keratoderma, may arise due to a mutation in keratin K1 that may play a role in its interaction with DPCT (25Kouklis P.D. Hutton E. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1049-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 40Kimonis V. DiGiovanna J.J. Yang J.-M. Doyle S.Z. Bale S.J. Compton J.G. J. Invest.

One attractive hypothesis is that mutations in the DP tail that affect interactions with cell type-specific filament systems may give rise to inherited tissue-specific human diseases.

By anchoring IF at sites of strong intercellular adhesion, desmosomes create a transcellular cytoskeletal network that is thought to confer mechanical integrity to the tissues where they reside. It is not surprising, therefore, that these junctions are particularly prominent in tissues experiencing mechanical stress such as epidermis, where they interact with IF networks comprising K5/K14 and K1/K10 keratin pairs. Desmosomes are also found in a wide variety of other tissues, including simple epithelia expressing the K8/K18 keratin pair, myocardial cells expressing desmin"

NPR is enriched by affinity chromatography on columns of a snake venom toxin, taipoxin, and columns of the taipoxin-binding proteins neuronal pentraxin 1 (NP1), neuronal pentraxin 2 (NP2), and taipoxin-associated calcium-binding protein 49 (TCBP49). The predominant form of NPR contains an putative NH2-terminal transmembrane domain and all forms of NPR are glycosylated. NPR has 49 and 48% amino acid identity to NP1 and NP2, respectively, and NPR message is expressed in neuronal regions that express NP1 and NP2. We suggest that NPR, NP1, NP2, and TCBP49 are involved in a pathway responsible for the transport of taipoxin into synapses and that this may represent a novel neuronal uptake pathway involved in the clearance of synaptic debris.

We identified two taipoxin binding proteins for a presynaptic-acting snake venom neurotoxin, taipoxin, that blocks recycling of synaptic vesicles (1Cull-Candy S.G. Fohlman J. Gustavsson D.

Affinity chromatography of solubilized rat brain membranes on columns of immobilized taipoxin enriches two major proteins: (i) neuronal pentraxin 1 (NP1), 1The abbreviations used are: NP1, neuronal pentraxin 1; NP2, neuronal pentraxin 2; TCBP49, taipoxin-associated calcium-binding protein 49; NPR, neuronal pentraxin receptor; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; Tricine,N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; kb, kilobase(s).1The abbreviations used are: NP1, neuronal pentraxin 1; NP2, neuronal pentraxin 2; TCBP49, taipoxin-associated calcium-binding protein 49; NPR, neuronal pentraxin receptor; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; Tricine,N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; kb, kilobase(s). a neuronally secreted protein with homology to serum pentraxins (2Schlimgen A.K. Helms J.A. Vogel H. Perin M.S. Neuron. 1995; 14: 519-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and (ii) taipoxin-associated calcium-binding protein 49 (TCBP49), a reticular calcium-binding protein (3Dodds D. Schlimgen A.K. Lu S.-Y. Perin M.S. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 2339-2344Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). NP1 has homology to previously identified pentraxins, such as serum amyloid P protein and C-reactive protein, which are elevated in the serum during acute phase response. Although the exact functions of these previously identified pentraxins are not known, they have been shown to bind, in a calcium-dependent manner, a wide variety of ligands and have been proposed to mediate the uptake of bacteria, toxins, and extracellular debris (4Pepys M.B. Baltz M.L. Adv. Immunol. 1983; 34: 141-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar, 5Steel D.M. Whitehead A.S. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 81-88Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). Homology to serum pentraxins, as well as the presence of a cleaved signal peptide and N-linked glycosylation sites, suggests that NP1 is secreted. The abundance of NP1 mRNA and rarity of NP1 protein suggest that NP1 protein has a rapid turnover. We have proposed that NP1 has a role in uptake at the synapse and that NP1 mediates the uptake of taipoxin into neurons. By low stringency screening, we identified an additional neuronal pentraxin (NP2) in human that has 54% amino acid identity with NP1 and is expressed in brain and multiple other tissues (6Hsu Y.-C. Perin M.S. Genomics. 1995; 28: 220-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Potential homologs of NP2 have been identified in guinea pig as a sperm acrosomal protein, apexin/p50 (7Reid M.S.

Worley P.F. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2463-2478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The second taipoxin-binding protein, TCBP49, binds calcium via six EF-hand calcium binding motifs and is localized to the lumen of reticular membranes in neurons and glia (3Dodds D. Schlimgen A.K. Lu S.-Y. Perin M.S. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 2339-2344Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It contains the carboxyl-terminal sequence HDEL which has been shown to occasionally mediate endoplasmic reticulum retention in mammalian cells (10Robbi M. Beaufay H. J. Biol.

We have suggested that NP1 binds to synaptic material and is taken up into a compartment containing TCBP49 (2Schlimgen A.K. Helms J.A. Vogel H. Perin M.S.

Neurochem. 1995; 64: 2339-2344Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We have also suggested that NP1 allows the internalization of taipoxin or a taipoxin·NP1 complex and that this uptake plays a role in the molecular mechanism of taipoxin toxicity.To identify other proteins in such an uptake pathway, we have chromatographed rat brain proteins on columns of immobilized taipoxin, recombinant TCBP49, and glutathione S-transferase-NP1/NP2 fusion proteins. Here we report the identification, cloning, and cDNA sequence of a protein, neuronal pentraxin receptor (NPR), that binds tightly to taipoxin, TCBP49, NP1, and NP2 columns.DISCUSSIONWe have previously identified two major taipoxin-binding proteins, NP1 and TCBP49 (2Schlimgen A.K. Helms J.A. Vogel H. Perin M.S. Neuron. 1995; 14: 519-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 3Dodds D. Schlimgen A.K. Lu S.-Y. Perin M.S. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 2339-2344Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and suggested that they mediate the uptake and activation of taipoxin, a presynaptic-acting neurotoxin that blocks synaptic vesicle recycling (1Cull-Candy S.G. Fohlman J. Gustavsson D. Lullmann-Rauch R. Thesleff S. Neuroscience. 1976; 1: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 2Schlimgen A.K. Helms J.A. Vogel H. Perin M.S. Neuron. 1995; 14: 519-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). We have shown that the addition of NP1 to glial cultures renders them susceptible to taipoxin toxicity (2Schlimgen A.K. Helms J.A. Vogel H. Perin M.S. Neuron. 1995; 14: 519-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), supporting a direct interaction between taipoxin and NP1 and a role for NP1 in the uptake of taipoxin. Additionally, the enrichment of rTCBP49 on taipoxin columns suggests that TCBP49 also interacts directly with taipoxin (data not shown). We now show that these two taipoxin-binding proteins are capable of binding to each other in the absence of taipoxin. Based on the homology of NP1 to acute phase pentraxins proposed to be involved in the uptake of pathogens and cellular debris, we have hypothesized that these proteins are components of a novel neuronal uptake pathway responsible for the clearance of synaptic debris and the uptake of taipoxin. Here we identify additional proteins that are likely constituents of this pathway. These include the previously characterized pentraxin, NP2, and a novel putative integral membrane pentraxin that we have named NPR.Chromatography of solubilized brain membranes on columns of immobilized taipoxin greatly enriches NP1, TCBP49, and 2–3 minor proteins of apparent molecular masses between 50 and 65 kDa. One of these minor proteins is neuronal pentraxin 2 or NP2 (6Hsu Y.-C. Perin M.S. Genomics. 1995; 28: 220-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). NP2 was identified from brain cDNA libraries by low stringency screening with NP1 probes and has also been identified as a guinea pig sperm acrosomal protein, apexin/p50 (7Reid M.S. Blobel C.P. J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 32607-32614Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and as a neural activity regulated pentraxin, narp (9Tsui C.C. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Barnes C. Worley P.F. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2463-2478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). With specific antiserum to rat NP2, we show that NP2 is also enriched on taipoxin columns. An additional minor protein enriched on taipoxin columns runs at both 55 and 65 kDa, and we now characterize it as NPR.Northern analysis and in situ hybridization show that NPR is expressed in neurons. NPR is expressed in the same brain regions that express NP1 and NP2. All show the highest message expression in cerebellum and hippocampus and lower expression in the neocortex and pirriform cortex. The overlap of expression of message for NP1, NP2, and NPR in brain may reflect a functional interaction between these proteins. Message for the apparent rat homolog of NP2, narp, has been shown to be greatly up-regulated with high frequency stimulation of the hippocampus (9Tsui C.C. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Barnes C. Worley P.F. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2463-2478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Potential activity-dependent regulation of NPR or NP1 has not been investigated; however, NPR and NP1 normally have moderately abundant messages of 5–6 kb, while NP2 has a low abundance message of 2.5 kb.NPR protein, like NP1 and NP2, is rare. Two different NPR antibodies fail to detect NPR in cortical and cerebellar homogenates or in brain membranes. The rarity of NPR protein contrasts with the abundance of NPR message. This discrepancy can be explained if NPR has a rapid turnover. Antibodies specific to the carboxyl terminus and post-transmembrane portion of NPR recognize both the 55- and 65-kDa NPR proteins. This demonstrates that all NPR proteins contain residues 30–494. The inability of antibody NPR2 (raised to a peptide containing a glycosylation site) to recognize the multiple forms of NPR equally well suggests that some of the NPR diversity is due to differential glycosylation. However, deglycosylation of NPR with endoglycosidase F yields multiple proteins of 50–60 kDa, suggesting that multiple NPR forms are not generated solely by differential glycosylation. Edman degradation of the 65-kDa NPR yielded clear sequence whereas Edman degradation of the 55-kDa NPR was blocked, suggesting that the 55- and 65-kDa NPR proteins have different amino termini. If NPR proteins differ in the first 30 residues, such differences are likely due to differential use of initiator codons or proteolytic cleavage. If initiated at methionine 12, NPR would have an amino-terminal hydrophobic domain of 13–19 residues. We currently cannot determine if the 55-kDa form of NPR contains residues 1–30, but endoglycosidase F cleavage produces only a small proportion of protein that runs at a similar molecular weight as recombinant NPR engineered to lack residues 1–30, its transmembrane domain. Expression of NPR in transfected CHO cells leads to cell surface exposure but not secretion. 2L. L. Kirkpatrick and M. S. Perin, manuscript in preparation. suggesting that transfected NPR contains a transmembrane domain.NPR exhibits several properties consistent with a role in uptake of NP1 and NP2. First, NPR, in at least the 65-kDa form, has an uncleaved amino-terminal sequence of sufficient length and hydrophobicity to be a transmembrane domain. This putative transmembrane domain and the presence of N-linked glycosylation are consistent with NPR being a cell surface integral membrane protein. Second, NPR can interact with NP1 and NP2, as NPR is greatly enriched on columns of recombinant NP1 and NP2. This interaction is direct as NPR, NP1, and NP2 are the major proteins that remain bound to GST-NP1 and GST-NP2 columns in high salt concentrations. The interactions of NPR, NP1, and NP2 are likely to occur through their calcium-dependent ligand binding domains, as these proteins are specifically eluted with EDTA. Third, the pattern of expression of NPR message in the brain overlaps that of NP1 and NP2. All are expressed most highly in the cerebellum and hippocampus with lower amounts in the neocortex. Key to the hypothesis that NPR is a receptor for secreted NP1 and NP2 will be the demonstration that transfection of NPR into cell lines allows cells to take up NP1, NP2, and taipoxin·NP1 complexes. Transfection of NPR will also allow investigation of functions of NPR that are independent of NP1 and NP2 and whether some forms of NPR are secreted.The interaction of TCBP49 with these neuronal pentraxins in the absence of taipoxin suggests that TCBP49, NP1 NP2 and NPR are components of a common pathway. Their co-enrichment on taipoxin columns suggests that this pathway is responsible for taipoxin toxicity and, as we have discussed, may provide a mechanism for the uptake of taipoxin into synapses. The pentraxins seem well suited to mediate internalization, and we have proposed that the interaction between TCBP49 and taipoxin may mediate toxicity, possibly by activating taipoxin after it has been taken up into a lumenal TCBP49-containing compartment. TCBP49's six EF-hands and high affinity calcium binding suggest that TCBP49 mediates calcium regulation of lumenal, reticular processes. Such processes could include protein folding, sorting, and membrane trafficking and may have direct implications for the action of taipoxin in blocking synaptic vesicle recycling. It is also interesting to note that the human homolog of TCBP49, ERC55 (12Weis K. Griffiths G. Lamond A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19142-19150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), has been identified by a two-hybrid screen as a ligand for the human papillomavirus E6 oncoprotein (26Chen J.J. Reid C.E. Band V. Androphy E.J. Science. 1995; 269: 529-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), raising a possibility that TCBP49 is involved in regulating membrane traffic necessary for growth control.The identification of NP1, NP2, and NPR has defined a specific family of pentraxins. All three have approximately 50% identity to each other, and each has 20–25% identity to the smaller acute phase pentraxins, C-reactive protein, and serum amyloid P protein. Additionally, experiments have suggested that NP1, NP2, and NPR can exist as high molecular weight complexes, indicating that they may form pentamers or decamers like C-reactive protein and serum amyloid P protein (data not shown). C-reactive protein and serum amyloid P protein bind a wide variety of materials, including phosphorylcholine, phosphorylethanolamine, particular bacterial polysaccharides, terminal galactose residues, 3-sulfated sugars, chromatin, histones, DNA, and components of the complement pathway (4Pepys M.B. Baltz M.L. Adv. Immunol. 1983; 34: 141-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar, 5Steel D.M. Whitehead A.S. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 81-88Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the diverse binding abilities of these proteins and their elevation during acute phase allow the clearance of extracellular material during immune response (4Pepys M.B. Baltz M.L. Adv. Immunol. 1983; 34: 141-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar, 5Steel D.M. Whitehead A.S. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 81-88Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). We suggest that NP1, NP2, and NPR mediate a similar function for neurons. Such a function would be ideally suited for removal of degraded synaptic material generated as synapses are formed or remodeled. Further studies will be required to test whether these neuronal pentraxins bind to degraded neuronal or synaptic material and whether loss of expression of these neuronal pentraxins affects synaptogenesis or plasticity. We identified two taipoxin binding proteins for a presynaptic-acting snake venom neurotoxin, taipoxin, that blocks recycling of synaptic vesicles (1Cull-Candy S.G. Fohlman J. Gustavsson D. Lullmann-Rauch R. Thesleff S. Neuroscience. 1976; 1: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 2Schlimgen A.K. Helms J.A. Vogel H. Perin M.S. Neuron. 1995; 14: 519-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Affinity chromatography of solubilized rat brain membranes on columns of immobilized taipoxin enriches two major proteins: (i) neuronal pentraxin 1 (NP1), 1The abbreviations used are: NP1, neuronal pentraxin 1; NP2, neuronal pentraxin 2; TCBP49, taipoxin-associated calcium-binding protein 49; NPR, neuronal pentraxin receptor; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; Tricine,N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; kb, kilobase(s).1The abbreviations used are: NP1, neuronal pentraxin 1; NP2, neuronal pentraxin 2; TCBP49, taipoxin-associated calcium-binding protein 49; NPR, neuronal pentraxin receptor; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; Tricine,N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; kb, kilobase(s). a neuronally secreted protein with homology to serum pentraxins (2Schlimgen A.K. Helms J.A. Vogel H. Perin M.S. Neuron. 1995; 14: 519-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and (ii) taipoxin-associated calcium-binding protein 49 (TCBP49), a reticular calcium-binding protein (3Dodds D. Schlimgen A.K. Lu S.-Y. Perin M.S. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 2339-2344Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). NP1 has homology to previously identified pentraxins, such as serum amyloid P protein and C-reactive protein, which are elevated in the serum during acute phase response. Although the exact functions of these previously identified pentraxins are not known, they have been shown to bind, in a calcium-dependent manner, a wide variety of ligands and have been proposed to mediate the uptake of bacteria, toxins, and extracellular debris (4Pepys M.B. Baltz M.L. Adv. Immunol. 1983; 34: 141-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar, 5Steel D.M. Whitehead A.S. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 81-88Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). Homology to serum pentraxins, as well as the presence of a cleaved signal peptide and N-linked glycosylation sites, suggests that NP1 is secreted. The abundance of NP1 mRNA and rarity of NP1 protein suggest that NP1 protein has a rapid turnover. We have proposed that NP1 has a role in uptake at the synapse and that NP1 mediates the uptake of taipoxin into neurons. By low stringency screening, we identified an additional neuronal pentraxin (NP2) in human that has 54% amino acid identity with NP1 and is expressed in brain and multiple other tissues (6Hsu Y.-C. Perin M.S. Genomics. 1995; 28: 220-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Potential homologs of NP2 have been identified in guinea pig as a sperm acrosomal protein, apexin/p50 (7Reid M.S. Blobel C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32615-32620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,8Noland T.D. Friday B.B. Maulit M.T. Gerton G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32607-32614Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and in rat as a neural activity-regulated pentraxin, narp (9Tsui C.C. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Barnes C. Worley P.F. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2463-2478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The second taipoxin-binding protein, TCBP49, binds calcium via six EF-hand calcium binding motifs and is localized to the lumen of reticular membranes in neurons and glia (3Dodds D. Schlimgen A.K. Lu S.-Y. Perin M.S. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 2339-2344Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It contains the carboxyl-terminal sequence HDEL which has been shown to occasionally mediate endoplasmic reticulum retention in mammalian cells (10Robbi M. Beaufay H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20498-20503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Wilson D.W. Lewis M.J. Pelham H.R.B. J. Biol.

We have suggested that NP1 binds to synaptic material and is taken up into a compartment containing TCBP49 (2Schlimgen A.K. Helms J.A. Vogel H. Perin M.S. Neuron. 1995; 14: 519-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 3Dodds D. Schlimgen A.K. Lu S.-Y. Perin M.S. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 2339-2344Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We have also suggested that NP1 allows the internalization of taipoxin or a taipoxin·NP1 complex and that this uptake plays a role in the molecular mechanism of taipoxin toxicity. To identify other proteins in such an uptake pathway, we have chromatographed rat brain proteins on columns of immobilized taipoxin, recombinant TCBP49, and glutathione S-transferase-NP1/NP2 fusion proteins. Here we report the identification, cloning, and cDNA sequence of a protein, neuronal pentraxin receptor (NPR), that binds tightly to taipoxin, TCBP49, NP1, and NP2 columns. DISCUSSIONWe have previously identified two major taipoxin-binding proteins, NP1 and TCBP49 (2Schlimgen A.K. Helms J.A. Vogel H. Perin M.S. Neuron. 1995; 14: 519-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 3Dodds D. Schlimgen A.K. Lu S.-Y. Perin M.S. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 2339-2344Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and suggested that they mediate the uptake and activation of taipoxin, a presynaptic-acting neurotoxin that blocks synaptic vesicle recycling (1Cull-Candy S.G. Fohlman J. Gustavsson D. Lullmann-Rauch R. Thesleff S. Neuroscience. 1976; 1: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 2Schlimgen A.K. Helms J.A. Vogel H. Perin M.S. Neuron. 1995; 14: 519-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). We have shown that the addition of NP1 to glial cultures renders them susceptible to taipoxin toxicity (2Schlimgen A.K. Helms J.A. Vogel H. Perin M.S. Neuron. 1995; 14: 519-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), supporting a direct interaction between taipoxin and NP1 and a role for NP1 in the uptake of taipoxin. Additionally, the enrichment of rTCBP49 on taipoxin columns suggests that TCBP49 also interacts directly with taipoxin (data not shown). We now show that these two taipoxin-binding proteins are capable of binding to each other in the absence of taipoxin. Based on the homology of NP1 to acute phase pentraxins proposed to be involved in the uptake of pathogens and cellular debris, we have hypothesized that these proteins are components of a novel neuronal uptake pathway responsible for the clearance of synaptic debris and the uptake of taipoxin. Here we identify additional proteins that are likely constituents of this pathway. These include the previously characterized pentraxin, NP2, and a novel putative integral membrane pentraxin that we have named NPR.Chromatography of solubilized brain membranes on columns of immobilized taipoxin greatly enriches NP1, TCBP49, and 2–3 minor proteins of apparent molecular masses between 50 and 65 kDa. One of these minor proteins is neuronal pentraxin 2 or NP2 (6Hsu Y.-C. Perin M.S. Genomics. 1995; 28: 220-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). NP2 was identified from brain cDNA libraries by low stringency screening with NP1 probes and has also been identified as a guinea pig sperm acrosomal protein, apexin/p50 (7Reid M.S. Blobel C.P. J.

Perin, manuscript in preparation. suggesting that transfected NPR contains a transmembrane domain. NPR exhibits several properties consistent with a role in uptake of NP1 and NP2. First, NPR, in at least the 65-kDa form, has an uncleaved amino-terminal sequence of sufficient length and hydrophobicity to be a transmembrane domain. This putative transmembrane domain and the presence of N-linked glycosylation are consistent with NPR being a cell surface integral membrane protein. Second, NPR can interact with NP1 and NP2, as NPR is greatly enriched on columns of recombinant NP1 and NP2. This interaction is direct as NPR, NP1, and NP2 are the major proteins that remain bound to GST-NP1 and GST-NP2 columns in high salt concentrations. The interactions of NPR, NP1, and NP2 are likely to occur through their calcium-dependent ligand binding domains, as these proteins are specifically eluted with EDTA. Third, the pattern of expression of NPR message in the brain overlaps that of NP1 and NP2. All are expressed most highly in the cerebellum and hippocampus with lower amounts in the neocortex. Key to the hypothesis that NPR is a receptor for secreted NP1 and NP2 will be the demonstration that transfection of NPR into cell lines allows cells to take up NP1, NP2, and taipoxin·NP1 complexes. Transfection of NPR will also allow investigation of functions of NPR that are independent of NP1 and NP2 and whether some forms of NPR are secreted. The interaction of TCBP49 with these neuronal pentraxins in the absence of taipoxin suggests that TCBP49, NP1 NP2 and NPR are components of a common pathway. Their co-enrichment on taipoxin columns suggests that this pathway is responsible for taipoxin toxicity and, as we have discussed, may provide a mechanism for the uptake of taipoxin into synapses. The pentraxins seem well suited to mediate internalization, and we have proposed that the interaction between TCBP49 and taipoxin may mediate toxicity, possibly by activating taipoxin after it has been taken up into a lumenal TCBP49-containing compartment. TCBP49's six EF-hands and high affinity calcium binding suggest that TCBP49 mediates calcium regulation of lumenal, reticular processes. Such processes could include protein folding, sorting, and membrane trafficking and may have direct implications for the action of taipoxin in blocking synaptic vesicle recycling. It is also interesting to note that the human homolog of TCBP49, ERC55 (12Weis K. Griffiths G. Lamond A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19142-19150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), has been identified by a two-hybrid screen as a ligand for the human papillomavirus E6 oncoprotein (26Chen J.J. Reid C.E. Band V. Androphy E.J. Science. 1995; 269: 529-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), raising a possibility that TCBP49 is involved in regulating membrane traffic necessary for growth control. The identification of NP1, NP2, and NPR has defined a specific family of pentraxins. All three have approximately 50% identity to each other, and each has 20–25% identity to the smaller acute phase pentraxins, C-reactive protein, and serum amyloid P protein. Additionally, experiments have suggested that NP1, NP2, and NPR can exist as high molecular weight complexes, indicating that they may form pentamers or decamers like C-reactive protein and serum amyloid P protein (data not shown). C-reactive protein and serum amyloid P protein bind a wide variety of materials, including phosphorylcholine, phosphorylethanolamine, particular bacterial polysaccharides, terminal galactose residues, 3-sulfated sugars, chromatin, histones, DNA, and components of the complement pathway (4Pepys M.B. Baltz M.L. Adv. Immunol. 1983; 34: 141-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar, 5Steel D.M. Whitehead A.S. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 81-88Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the diverse binding abilities of these proteins and their elevation during acute phase allow the clearance of extracellular material during immune response (4Pepys M.B. Baltz M.L. Adv. Immunol. 1983; 34: 141-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar, 5Steel D.M. Whitehead A.S. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 81-88Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). We suggest that NP1, NP2, and NPR mediate a similar function for neurons. Such a function would be ideally suited for removal of degraded synaptic material generated as synapses are formed or remodeled. Further studies will be required to test whether these neuronal pentraxins bind to degraded neuronal or synaptic material and whether loss of expression of these neuronal pentraxins affects synaptogenesis or plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2057482563,"The minerals (Mg,Fe)SiO 3 -ilmenite and -perovskite were identified in the shock-induced veins in the Tenham chondritic meteorite. Both phases are inferred to have transformed from pyroxene at high pressures and temperatures by shock metamorphism. Columnar-shaped ilmenite grains, one of two types of morphologies, have a topotaxial relationship with neighboring pyroxene grains, indicating shear transformation. Granular-shaped perovskite grains showed a diffraction pattern consistent with orthorhombic perovskite, but these grains were not stable under the electron beam irradiation and became amorphous. The higher iron concentration in both phases compared with those experimentally reported may suggest their metastable transition from enstatite because of shock compression."
https://openalex.org/W2048750043,"In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, three genes, ced-3, ced-4, andced-9, play critical roles in the induction and execution of the death pathway. Genetic studies have suggested thatced-9 controls programmed cell death by regulatingced-4 and ced-3. However, the mechanism by which CED-9 controls the activities of CED-4 and the cysteine protease CED-3, the effector arm of the cell-death pathway, remains poorly understood. Immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrates that CED-9 forms a multimeric protein complex with CED-4 and CED-3 in vivo. Expression of wild-type CED-4 promotes the ability of CED-3 to induce apoptosis in mammalian cells, which is inhibited by CED-9. The pro-apoptotic activity of CED-4 requires the expression of a functional CED-3 protease. Significantly, loss-of-function CED-4 mutants are impaired in their ability to promote CED-3-mediated apoptosis. Expression of CED-4 enhances the proteolytic activation of CED-3. We also show that CED-9 inhibits the formation of p13 and p15, two cleavage products of CED-3 associated with its proteolytic activationin vivo. Moreover, CED-9 inhibits the enzymatic activity of CED-3 promoted by CED-4. Thus, these results provide evidence that CED-4 and CED-9 regulate the activity of CED-3 through physical interactions, which may provide a molecular basis for the control of programmed cell death in C. elegans.

In the nematodeCaenorhabditis elegans, 131 of the 1090 somatic cells generated during development undergo PCD (2Sulston J.E. Schierenberg E. White J.G. Thomson N. Dev. Biol. 1983; 100: 64-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (2823) Google Scholar). Three genes have been identified in the nematode that play critical roles in the induction and execution of PCD (3Horvitz H.R. Shaham S. Hengartner M.O. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1994; 59: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The ced-9 gene protects cells that normally survive from PCD during worm development (4Hengartner M.O. Ellis R.E. Horvitz H.R.

Cell. 1994; 76: 665-676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). Furthermore, bcl-2 can partially substitute forced-9 in C. elegans, suggesting thatbcl-2 is a homolog of ced-9 (6Vaux D.L. Wieissman I.L Kim S.K. Science. 1992; 258: 1955-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 7Yuan J. Shaham S. Ledoux S. Ellis H.M. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1993; 75: 641-652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2257) Google Scholar). In contrast, two nematode genes, ced-3 and ced-4, are required for the execution of the cell death program. Thus, loss-of-function mutations of ced-3 and ced-4 cause all 131 somatic cells that normally die to survive (3Horvitz H.R. Shaham S. Hengartner M.O. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1994; 59: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The ced-3product is homologous to the mammalian interleukin-1β-converting enzyme (ICE), which is a member of a family of cysteine proteases (designated caspases) (7Yuan J. Shaham S. Ledoux S. Ellis H.M. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1993; 75: 641-652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2257) Google Scholar, 8Miura M. Zhu H. Rotello R. Hartwieg E.A. Yuan J. Cell. 1993; 75: 653-660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar). CED-3 and related caspases are thought to act as effectors of the nematode and mammalian PCD pathway (7Yuan J. Shaham S. Ledoux S. Ellis H.M. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1993; 75: 641-652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2257) Google Scholar, 8Miura M. Zhu H. Rotello R. Hartwieg E.A. Yuan J. Cell. 1993; 75: 653-660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar). Genetic experiments have suggested that ced-9 protects cells from undergoing PCD by preventing the death-promoting activity ofced-3 and ced-4 (4Hengartner M.O. Ellis R.E. Horvitz H.R. Nature. 1992; 356: 494-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar, 9Shaham S. Horvitz H.R. Genes & Dev. 1996; 10: 578-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Consistent with genetic experiments in C. elegans, Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, two mammalian homologs of CED-9, can inhibit the activation of ICE-like proteases and therefore appear to act upstream of the death proteases in the mammalian apoptotic pathway (10Chinnaiyan A.M.

Overexpression ofced-4 in the nematode ALM neurons causes cell death that requires ced-3 activity for efficient killing, suggesting that ced-4 acts upstream of ced-3 (9Shaham S. Horvitz H.R. Genes & Dev. 1996; 10: 578-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Furthermore, protection against ced-3-induced cell death byced-9 requires ced-4 activity, suggesting thatced-9 controls ced-3 by acting at least in part through ced-4 (9Shaham S. Horvitz H.R. Genes & Dev. 1996; 10: 578-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Although genetic analysis has been essential for the identification and initial characterization of the nematode PCD pathway, the biochemical basis by which CED-3, CED-4, and CED-9 regulate cell death has remained elusive. Recent studies, however, indicate that CED-9 interacts with CED-4 suggesting that CED-9 regulates cell death by binding to and inactivating CED-4 (12Spector M.S. Desnoyers S. Hoeppner D.J. Hengartner M.O. Nature. 1997; 385: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 13Wu D. Wallen H.D. Nuñez G.

In the present studies, we performed further functional and biochemical analyses of CED-3, CED-4, and CED-9 interactions using mammalian cells as a model system to gain insight into the regulation and molecular basis of the PCD pathway. The expression plasmids producing epitope-tagged CED-4 and CED-9 have been described (13Wu D. Wallen H.D. Nuñez G. Science. 1997; 275: 1126-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Plasmids encoding Myc-tagged CED-4 mutants were generated by PCR amplification of ced-4S template DNA using 3′ primers that included the natural translation termination sequences as described (15Yuan J. Horvitz H.R. Development. 1992; 116: 309-320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, the ced-4 constructs were ligated into theKpnI site of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). An HA- or Flag-taggedced-3 insert was constructed by introducing each epitope tag at the COOH terminus of CED-3 by PCR. Inserts to express mutant CED-3 proteins were generated by PCR amplification of ced-3template using a 3′ primer that included a translation termination codon (D220 CED-3) or by two-step mutagenesis to generate G360S CED-3. The HA-, Flag-, or Myc-tagged inserts were ligated into theBamHI site of pcDNA3. Orientation of the inserts was determined by restriction mapping. Authenticity of all tagged constructs was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. Culture dishes containing 2–5 × 106human embryonic kidney 293T cells were transfected with the indicated amount (see figure legends) of plasmid DNA by the calcium phosphate method. The expression of HA-CED-9, Myc-CED-4, and Flag-tagged CED-3 was determined in total lysates by immunoblotting as described previously (16Simonian P.L. Grillot D.A.M. Merino R. Nuñez G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22764-22772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitations, cells from each dish were lysed in 1 ml of Nonidet P-40 isotonic lysis buffer at 14–20 h after transfection, and soluble lysates were incubated with 1 μg/ml rabbit anti-Myc, anti-Flag, or anti-HA antibody (Santa Cruz) or anti-AU1 antibody (Babco) or normal rabbit IgG overnight at 4 °C with 5% (v/v) of protein A-Sepharose 4B (Zymed Laboratories). Immune complexes were centrifuged, washed with excess cold Nonidet P-40 isotonic lysis buffer at least four times, separated on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and immunoblotted with monoclonal anti-HA (clone 12CA5, Boehringer Mannheim), monoclonal anti-Flag (clone M2, Kodak), or rabbit anti-Myc antibody (Santa Cruz). The proteins were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system (Amersham Corp.). 293T cells (5 × 106) in 100-mm plates were transiently co-transfected with 5 μg of pcDNA3-ced-4-Myc and/or pcDNA3-ced-3-Flag in the presence or absence of 5 μg of pcDNA3-HA-ced-9 by calcium phosphate method. The total amount of transfected plasmid DNA was always 15 μg/well and was adjusted by adding vector pcDNA3 DNA. At 14 h, cells were lysed in buffer A (25 mm HEPES, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.6, containing protease inhibitors and 0.2% Nonidet P-40). 150 μg of protein lysate was immunoprecipitated with 10 μg of anti-Flag antibody or control in 200 μl of buffer A and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. CED-3 complexes were immunoprecipitated with 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose and washed with buffer A four times. 100 μm of the fluorogenic substrate Ac-DEVD-AMC (Alexis, San Diego, CA) was added in buffer A and incubated at 37 °C for 1, 3, and 6 h in triplicate. Cleavage of substrate emitted a fluorescent signal that was quantified in a fluorometer at excitation 340 nm and emission 460 nm. Statistical significance was determined by 1-way ANOVA followed by Student-Neuman-Keuls post-hoc comparisons. 293T cells (5 × 105) in each well of 6-well plate were transiently co-transfected in triplicate with 0.33 μg of a reporter plasmid pcDNA3-β-gal plus 0.66 μg of pcDNA3-ced-4-Myc and/or pcDNA3-ced-3-Flag or mutant tagged-ced-3 constructs in the presence or absence of 0.66 μg of pcDNA3-HA-ced-9 by calcium phosphate method. The total amount of transfected plasmid DNA was always 2 μg/well and was adjusted by adding vector pcDNA3 DNA. Apoptosis was determined at 24 h after transfection by analysis of at least 300 cells expressing β-galactosidase as described (8Miura M. Zhu H. Rotello R. Hartwieg E.A. Yuan J. Cell. 1993; 75: 653-660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar). Genetic studies have suggested that CED-4 regulates the activity of CED-3 in the C. elegans death pathway (9Shaham S. Horvitz H.R. Genes & Dev. 1996; 10: 578-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). To determine if CED-4 interacts with CED-3, we transiently co-transfected human 293T cells with expression plasmids producing Flag-tagged CED-3, HA-tagged CED-9, and Myc epitope-tagged CED-4. Because CED-3 induces apoptosis in mammalian cells, we used a catalytically inactive mutant of CED-3 (CED-3-Flag-G360S) to study the interaction of CED-3, CED-4, and CED-9. Immunoprecipitates were prepared with rabbit anti-Myc antibody and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Immunoblotting with a monoclonal antibody to Flag revealed that CED-4 co-immunoprecitated CED-3 in the presence or absence of CED-9 (Fig. 1 A). Furthermore, immunoprecpitation with anti-HA followed by immunoblotting with anti-Flag revealed that CED-9 co-immunoprecipitated CED-3 (Fig. 1 A). To further verify these results, we performed reciprocal experiments. Immunoprecipitation of CED-3 with anti-Flag antibody co-imunoprecipitated CED-9 (Fig. 1 B). CED-4 co-immunoprecipitated both CED-3 and CED-9 (Fig. 1 A). More importantly, CED-3 was unable to interact with CED-9 in the absence of CED-4 (Fig. 1, A and B) indicating that CED-3 associates with CED-9 through CED-4. These results confirm observations recently reported by Chinnaiyan et al. (12Spector M.S. Desnoyers S. Hoeppner D.J. Hengartner M.O. Nature. 1997; 385: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). To further characterize the specificity and functional significance of the interaction between CED-3 and CED-4, we determined the ability of CED-3 to associate with wild-type CED-4 and three natural CED-4 mutants that exhibit a loss of function phenotype in C. elegans (Fig. 2 A). Two point mutations, n1948 and n1894, introduce a single amino acid change (Ile to Asn) at position 258 and a stop codon at residue 401 of the CED-4 protein, respectively (15Yuan J. Horvitz H.R. Development. 1992; 116: 309-320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We engineered another mutation, G328, to insert a stop codon at amino acid 328 to recapitulate the loss of function mutation n1416, which results from a Tc4 insertion at residue 328 of CED-4 (15Yuan J. Horvitz H.R. Development. 1992; 116: 309-320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To assess the interaction of CED-3 with CED-4 proteins, 293T cells were transiently co-transfected with plasmids producing Flag-tagged CED-3 and Myc-tagged wild-type or mutant CED-4 proteins. Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that CED-3 co-immunoprecipitated wild-type CED-4 (Fig. 2 B), confirming our results presented in Fig. 1. Significantly, W401 and G328, two loss of function CED-4 mutants resulting from C-terminal truncations retained their ability to associate with CED-3 (Fig. 2 B). Similarly, the missense, loss of function I258N mutant resulting from a single amino acid substitution at position 258 of CED-4 retained its ability to interact with CED-3 (Fig. 2 C). Because CED-4 also interacts with CED-9 (12Spector M.S. Desnoyers S. Hoeppner D.J. Hengartner M.O. Nature. 1997; 385: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 13Wu D. Wallen H.D. Nuñez G. Science. 1997; 275: 1126-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 14Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Lane B.R. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 275: 1122-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar), we next determined the ability of the CED-4 mutants to associate with CED-9. Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that all three loss of function CED-4 mutants retained their capacity to interact with CED-9 although the binding of the CED-4 mutants, particularly G328 and I258N, was reduced when compared with wild-type CED-4 Fig. 2 D). To further define the interaction of CED-4 with CED-3, the ability of CED-4 to interact with two CED-3 mutants was investigated. We engineered CED-3 D220 to express a truncated CED-3 mutant (residues 1–220) containing the prodomain of CED-3 and CED-3 G360S, a natural loss of function CED-3 mutant (17Xue D. Shaham S. Horvitz H.R. Genes & Dev. 1996; 10: 1073-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) with a single amino acid change (Gly to Ser) at position 360 located in the conserved pentapeptide QACRG of CED-3 (Fig. 2 A). CED-4 coimmuprecipitated with both CED-3 mutants (Fig. 2 E) The results indicate that CED-4 can interact with the prodomain of CED-3 and with CED-3 containing a single amino acid change in its catalytic domain, which is in agreement with a recent report (12Spector M.S. Desnoyers S. Hoeppner D.J. Hengartner M.O. Nature. 1997; 385: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Genetic analysis in C. elegans has suggested that CED-4 regulates the activity of CED-3 and requires CED-3 to activate cell death. To further explore the function of CED-4 in apoptosis, we determined if CED-4 could regulate the cell death-promoting ability of CED-3 in mammalian cells. To do this, 293T cells were transiently transfected with expression constructs producing CED-4, CED-3, and empty vector. Expression of CED-4 did not induce apoptosis in 293T cells above the levels observed with control plasmid (Fig. 3 A). Transfection of CED-3 induced a modest but significant level of apoptosis in 293T cells (Fig. 3 A). More importantly, the great majority of the cells underwent apoptosis when co-transfected with CED-3 and CED-4 (Fig. 3 A), indicating that CED-4 potentiates the ability of CED-3 to induce apoptosis. Significantly, expression of CED-9 blocked the ability of CED-4 and CED-3 to induce apoptosis (Fig. 3 A). Together with genetic experiments in C. elegans (3Horvitz H.R. Shaham S. Hengartner M.O. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1994; 59: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 9Shaham S. Horvitz H.R. Genes & Dev. 1996; 10: 578-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), these results suggest that CED-4 interacts with and activates the death-promoting ability of CED-3, which can be inhibited by the interaction of CED-9 with CED-4. To further assess the function of CED-4, we tested the ability of loss of function CED-4 mutants to promote CED-3-mediated apoptosis. Functional analysis revealed that the loss of function CED-4 mutants were defective in their ability to potentiate CED-3-mediated apoptosis when compared with wild-type CED-4 (Fig. 3 A). The levels of wild-type and mutant W401 and G328 CED-4 proteins expressed in 293T cells were similar, ruling out the trivial explanation that the differential ability of these proteins to promote apoptosis is due to differences in protein expression (Fig. 2 and data not shown). However, the expression of the I258N CED-4 mutant is reduced and appears unstable, which agrees with previous results (14Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Lane B.R. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 275: 1122-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). To further determine the mechanism by which CED-4 potentiates CED-3-mediated apoptosis, we examined whether the pro-apoptotic activity of CED-4 requires a “functional” CED-3 protease. In contrast to the killing observed with wild-type CED-3, CED-4 failed to promote apoptosis mediated by either a truncated CED-3 mutant containing the prodomain of CED-3 or G360S CED-3, a natural loss of function CED-3 mutant with a single amino acid change (Gly to Ser) at position 360 located in the conserved active pentapeptide QACRG of CED-3 (Fig. 3 B). Because the CED-3 (G360S) mutant protein is known to be inactive as a cysteine protease in vitro (17Xue D. Shaham S. Horvitz H.R. Genes & Dev. 1996; 10: 1073-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), we conclude that the protease activity of CED-3 is required for CED-4 to promote apoptosis in mammalian cells. These results are consistent with genetic studies which have shown that the CED-3 protease activity is crucial for the death-promoting function of CED-4 in C. elegans (9Shaham S. Horvitz H.R. Genes & Dev. 1996; 10: 578-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). To assess if the survival protein CED-9 regulates the activation of the CED-3 protease in vivo, cellular lysates from 293T cells transiently transfected with plasmids expressing CED-3, CED-4, and CED-9 were analyzed for the presence of p13 and p15, two cleavage products of CED-3 associated with its proteolytic activation (17Xue D. Shaham S. Horvitz H.R. Genes & Dev. 1996; 10: 1073-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 18Hugunin M. Quintal L.J. Mankovich J.A. Ghayur T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3517-3522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4 A, expression of CED-3 resulted in partial processing of the immature 56-kDa CED-3-FLAG protein as determined by the detection of the mature p13 and p15 products of CED-3 (17Xue D. Shaham S. Horvitz H.R. Genes & Dev. 1996; 10: 1073-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Significantly, processing of CED-3 increased dramatically in the presence of CED-4 when compared with cells expressing CED-3 alone (Fig. 4 A). Moreover, expression of CED-9 inhibited the processing of CED-3 in cells transiently transfected with CED-3 plus CED-4 as determined by the absence of the p13 and p15 proteolytic products of CED-3 (Fig. 4 A). To verify these results, we determined the caspase enzymatic activity of CED-3 in lysates from cells transiently transfected with CED-3, CED-3 plus CED-4, and CED-3 plus CED-4 plus CED-9. To measure the protease activity associated with CED-3, aliquots of the same cellular lysates used in Fig. 4 B were incubated with anti-Flag antibody to immunoprecipitate CED-3 protein complexes, and the immunoprecipitates were assayed for enzymatic activity using the Ac-DEVD-AMC fluorogenic substrate (19Thornberry N.A. Bull H.G. Calaycay J.R. Chapman K.T. Howard A.D. Kostura M.J. Miller K.D. Molineaux S.M. Weidner J.R. Aunins J. Elliston U.O. Ayala J.M. Casano F.J. Chin J. Ding G.J.-F. Egger L.A. Gaffney E.P. Limjuco G. Palyha O.C. Raju S.M. Rolando A.M. Salley J.P. Yamin T.-T. Lee T.D. Shively J.E. MacCross M. Mumford R.A. Schmidt J.A. Tocci M.J. Nature. 1992; 356: 768-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (2232) Google Scholar). In agreement with results shown in Fig. 4 A, lysates from cells expressing CED-3 or CED-3 plus CED-4 exhibited significant enzymatic activity when compared with control lysates (Fig. 4 B). Importantly, the caspase activity of CED-3 from cells expressing CED-3 and CED-4 was inhibited by CED-9 (Fig. 4 B). In control experiments, there was no significant protease activity when the same cellular lysates were immunoprecipitated with control antibody (data not shown). Because the cellular expression of CED-3 was diminished in the presence of CED-4 and enhanced in the presence of CED-9 when compared with cells expressing CED-3 alone (Fig. 4), we adjusted the values of enzymatic activity obtained with the Ac-DEVD-AMC substrate to normalize for the amount of CED-3 protein (immature plus mature). After normalization, we found that the enzymatic activity of CED-3 was enhanced significantly by co-expression of CED-4 (Fig. 4 C). In contrast, CED-9 inhibited the catalytic activity of CED-3 in the presence of CED-4 (Fig. 4 C). These results demonstrate that CED-4 interacts with both CED-3 and CED-9 in mammalian cells and presumably in C. elegans cells. Our studies confirmed and extended the reported interaction of CED-4 with CED-3 and CED-9 (14Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Lane B.R. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 275: 1122-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). However, our functional results differ from those recently reported (14Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Lane B.R. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 275: 1122-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar), which demonstrated that CED-4 was capable of inducing apoptosis in 293T cells even in the absence of CED-3. In addition to 293T cells, we found that expression of CED-4 failed to kill human MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells and COS-7 monkey cells. 2D. Wu, H. Wallen, N. Inohara, and G. Nuñez, unpublished observations. In agreement with our results, another group has found that expression of CED-4 fails to kill Rat-1 and HeLa cells. 3J. Yuan, personal communication. Thus, we do not have an explanation to account for the discrepancy in the results. In our studies, CED-4 functioned only to promote apoptosis in mammalian cells, which was dependent upon the expression of enzymatically active CED-3. These observations support previous genetic experiments in C. elegans in which efficient killing by CED-4 was shown to be dependent upon CED-3 activity (9Shaham S. Horvitz H.R. Genes & Dev. 1996; 10: 578-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Together with the results from other investigators (14Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Lane B.R. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 275: 1122-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar), these studies argue that CED-4 promotes cell death by interacting with and activating CED-3. However, the mechanism by which CED-4 activates CED-3 is unclear and needs to be further investigated. Because three loss of function CED-4 mutants retained their ability to associate with CED-3, our studies suggest that the interaction between CED-4 and CED-3 is not sufficient for death-promoting function of CED-4. Consistent with the analysis inC. elegans, the loss of function CED-4 mutants were impaired in their ability to potentiate CED-3-mediated apoptosis in mammalian cells. Expression of CED-9 inhibited the killing activity of CED-4 plus CED-3, and in another study, it inhibited killing induced by CED-4 alone (14Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Lane B.R. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 275: 1122-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Because CED-9 can form a protein complex with CED-3 through CED-4, the protective function of CED-9 could be mediated by preventing the activation of CED-3 through CED-4. Indeed, we show for the first time that CED-4 enhances the processing and conversion of CED-3 into the active CED-3 form in vivo. Furthermore, we show that CED-9 inhibits the proteolytic activation of CED-3 in cells that co-express CED-4. Since a C. elegans cell culture is not available, the biochemical analysis of the death regulators CED-3, CED-4, and CED-9 was performed in mammalian cells. The biochemical results that we have obtained with CED-3, CED-4 and CED-9 are consistent with the genetic analysis in C. elegans (9Shaham S. Horvitz H.R. Genes & Dev. 1996; 10: 578-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). However, we cannot formally rule out that these worm proteins behave differently in C. elegans cells. These studies predict that Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, the mammalian CED-9 homologs, may regulate apoptosis by interacting with caspases, the cysteine proteases of the ICE/CED-3 family through a mammalian CED-4 counterpart.

At 1.25 pm added TF, no thrombin generation was observed in the absence of factor V. The substitution of factor Va for factor V increased the rate of thrombin generation. Factor X activation during the initiation phase was not influenced by the absence of factor VIII or thrombin, leading to the conclusion that initially factor Xa is generated exclusively by the factor VIIa-TF complex. When thrombin was eliminated from the system, no contribution of the factor IXa-factor VIIIa complex to factor X activation was observed during the propagation phase. Similarly, factor V activation was also not observed in the absence of thrombin, indicating that thrombin is the only enzyme responsible for factor V and factor VIII activation. Only subnanomolar amounts of factor VII were activated when prothrombin activation was almost complete. In the absence of coagulation inhibitors, factor XI did not influence thrombin generation initiated by 1.25 pm factor VIIa-TF complex.

TF forms an enzymatic complex with preexistent plasma factor VIIa, and the resulting factor VIIa-TF complex activates factors X and IX (3Jesty J. Silverberg S.A. J. Biol.

Factor IXa in complex with its cofactor, factor VIIIa, activates factor X at an ∼50-fold higher rate than the factor VIIa-TF complex (6Mann K.G. Krishnaswamy S. Lawson J.H. Semin. Hematol. 1992; 29: 213-226PubMed Google Scholar). In turn, factor Xa with phospholipids may activate factor VII (7Radcliffe R. Nemerson Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 388-395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and further enhance factor IX and factor X activation. The major function of factor Xa is to form the prothrombinase complex with factor Va and a phospholipid membrane surface, leading to prothrombin activation (8Mann K.G. Jenny R.J. Krishnaswamy S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 915-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Thrombin cleaves soluble fibrinogen, forming fibrin, which polymerizes to form an insoluble clot (9Blomback B. Blomback M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1972; 202: 77-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The blood coagulation cascade is down-regulated by the synergistic action of the natural inhibitors of blood coagulation: tissue factor pathway inhibitor, antithrombin III, and the activated protein C system (10van ‘t Veer C. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4367-4377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 11van ‘t Veer C. Golden N.J. Kalafatis M. Mann K.G. J. Biol.

The procoagulant processes described above may be divided into two phases (see Fig. 1): (a) an initiation phase, which is characterized by the appearance of small amounts of thrombin (<1 nm) and other enzymes (<10 pm) and by low rates of their generation; and (b) a propagation phase, which may be characterized by rapid, quantitative prothrombin activation. Coincidentally, when the inhibitors are present, thrombin generation is terminated, and extant thrombin is inhibited by the anticoagulation system. The propagation and termination processes have been investigated and described in studies in various reconstituted systems (10van ‘t Veer C. Mann K.G. J. Biol.

Haemostasis. 1989; 61: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and in minimally altered whole blood (17Rand M.D. Lock J.B. van ‘t Veer C. Gaffney D.P. Mann K.G. Blood. 1996; 88: 3432-3445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The major regulatory steps that occur during the initiation phase are major factor V and factor VIII and limited factor IX and factor X activation (15Lawson J.H. Kalafatis M. Stram S. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23357-23366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The studies presently available, however, do not identify the sources of the initial factors Va, VIIIa, and Xa required to generate the thrombin that is essential in the catalytic feedback activation leading to explosive thrombin generation. Knowledge of these early reactions is critical to the understanding of blood coagulation, and the answers lie in understanding the dynamics of the initiation phase of the process. The most common methods used for the evaluation of the different phases of the coagulation process have employed peptidyl-p-nitroanilide substrates (10van ‘t Veer C. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4367-4377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 11van ‘t Veer C. Golden N.J. Kalafatis M. Mann K.G. J. Biol.

Lindhout T. Hemker H.C. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1989; 61: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The high concentrations and amidolytic activity of thrombin allow quantitation with high precision. However, direct evaluation of the activation of the other proteins involved in the coagulation cascade is not a simple task even during the propagation phase, due to their low concentrations (15Lawson J.H.

The “initiation phase” is defined in these studies as the period in which little thrombin amidolytic activity is observed or a “lag” time. There is no doubt, however, that enzymatic reactions start at the inception of reagent mixing, but the sensitivities of chromogenic assays do not allow the quantitation of the enzymes present. The most common methods used for the evaluation of low concentrations of serine proteases are multistage, coupled assays that employ additional protein(s) (24Astrup T. Mullerty S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1952; 40: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar, 25Kessner A. Troll W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 176: 411-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 26Seligsohn U.

These assays are complicated and have inherent difficulties in interpretation due to almost ubiquitous feedback activation reactions (28Lawson J.H. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11317-11327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Radcliffe R. Nemerson Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 4797-4802Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 30Barlow G.H.

One strategy to overcome these problems is the development of synthetic substrates and assays that allow direct and selective quantitation of enzymes at picomolar and lower concentrations. In a previous report (34Butenas S. Orfeo T. Lawson J.H. Mann K.G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5399-5411Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), we presented substrates containing the fluorescent aminonaphthalenesulfonamide leaving groups, which are easily modifiable in the sulfonamide moiety to gain selectivity for a given serine protease. Using these substrates, structure-efficiency correlations for a number of the serine proteases involved in blood coagulation and fibrinolysis have been established (23Butenas S. Ribarik N. Mann K.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6531-6538Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 34Butenas S. Orfeo T. Lawson J.H. Mann K.G.

In this study, we describe the use of 6-peptidylamino-1-naphthalenesulfonamide substrates with selective inhibitors in single enzyme microassays of the blood coagulation serine proteases. The assays were employed to reveal the sequence of events occurring during the initiation phase of zymogen activation in a tissue factor-initiated model of blood coagulation. The fluorogenic 6-peptidylamino-1-naphthalenesulfonamide substrates (PNS substrates) were synthesized and characterized as described previously (23Butenas S. Ribarik N. Mann K.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6531-6538Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 34Butenas S. Orfeo T. Lawson J.H. Mann K.G.

For all assays, substrates were initially dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide to a stock concentration of 10 mm. Phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylcholine were purchased from Sigma. Phospholipid vesicles (PCPS) composed of 75% phosphatidylcholine and 25% phosphatidylserine were prepared as described (36Higgins D.L. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6503-6508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The thrombin inhibitor hirudin (37Stone R.S. Hofsteenge J. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4622-4628Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar) was a gift from Genentech, and the factor Xa inhibitor TAP (38Krishnaswamy S. Vlasuk G.P. Bergum P.W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7879-7907Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar) was provided as a gift from Sriram Krishnaswamy (Hematology/Oncology Division, Department of Medicine, Emory University). Recombinant human TF-(1–242) and recombinant human factor VIII (free of albumin) were provided as gifts from Shu-Len Liu and Rodger Lundblad (Hyland Division, Baxter Healthcare Corp.). Human thrombin and factors Xa, XIa, and XI were provided as gifts from Hematologic Technologies Inc. Factor XI was treated with 20 μmd-Phe-Pro-Arg chloromethyl ketone and 1 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate to inhibit traces of factor XIa in the factor XI preparation and subsequently dialyzed. Monoclonal antibodies αHFV-9 and αHFV-17 were from the Biochemistry Antibody Core Laboratory (University of Vermont). Recombinant human factor VIIa was purchased from NOVO Pharmaceuticals. Human factors II, IX, and X were isolated from fresh frozen plasma as described previously (39Bajaj S.P. Rapaport S.I. Prodanos C. Prep. Biochem. 1981; 11: 397-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and were additionally purified and depleted of trace enzymes as described (10van ‘t Veer C. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4367-4377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Human factor V was isolated by the method of Katzmann et al. (40Katzmann J.A. Nesheim M.E. Hibbard L.S. Mann K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and activated to factor Va as described previously (41Kane W.H. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1002-1007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,42Suzuki K. Dahlback B. Stenflo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6556-6564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TF relipidation on PCPS vesicles and the factor VIIa-TF complex formation were accomplished as described previously (43Lawson J.H. Krishnaswamy S. Butenas S. Mann K.G. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 177-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 44Butenas S. Mann K.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1904-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Experiments were designed to evaluate each enzyme in mixtures similar to those encountered during mixed coagulation factor activation experiments. For validation/recovery studies of factors Xa and VIIa, 10 nm thrombin, 30 pm factor VIIa, 10 pm factor IXa, and 10 pm factor Xa were incubated at room temperature in HBS/CaCl2 (HBS and 2 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4) containing 200 μm PCPS for 5 min (total volume of 800 μl) (mixture A). A 200-μl aliquot of mixture A was added to 988 μl of HBS/ETDA (HBS and 20 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) containing 6 μm hirudin (standard concentration). 100 μm6-(methanesulfonyl-d-Leu-Gly-Arg)-amino-1-naphthalenediethylsulfonamide (mLGRnds) was added, and the rate of substrate hydrolysis was evaluated. A second 200-μl aliquot of mixture A was treated the same way, except that 600 nm TAP (standard concentration) was added. The rate observed for the second aliquot was subtracted from the rate observed for the first aliquot, and the difference was assigned to the factor Xa amidolytic activity. Factor Xa concentrations were estimated from a standard curve prepared using serial dilutions of purified factor Xa. The third 200-μl aliquot of mixture A was mixed with 988 μl of HBS/EDTA containing hirudin (6 μm) and TAP (600 nm). 6-(d-Phe-Pro-Arg)-amino-1-naphthalenebutylsulfonamide (FPRnbs) (100 μm final concentration) was added, and the rate of substrate hydrolysis was evaluated. A fourth 200-μl aliquot of mixture A was treated the same way, except that 20 nm TF was added, and the mixture was incubated for 20 min at room temperature to allow complete factor VIIa-tissue factor complexation. 100 μm FPRnbs was added, and the rate of substrate hydrolysis was evaluated. The difference in substrate hydrolysis rates in the presence and absence of TF is specific for factor VIIa (45Butenas S. Lawson J.H. Kalafatis M. Mann K.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3449-3456Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Factor VIIa concentrations were estimated from a standard curve prepared using serial dilutions of purified factor VIIa. Similar factor Xa and factor VIIa assays were carried out for an enzyme mixture that contained 1.4 μm thrombin, 0.3 nm factor VIIa, 1 nm factor Xa, and 1 nm factor IXa (mixture B). 1 pm thrombin was added to HBS/CaCl2 containing 200 μm PCPS (total volume of 400 μl) and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. A 200-μl aliquot of this mixture was added to 994 μl of HBS/EDTA containing 600 nm TAP; 50 μm6-(d-Val-Pro-Arg)-amino-1-naphthalenebutylsulfonamide (VPRnbs) was added; and the rate of substrate hydrolysis was evaluated. A second 200-μl aliquot was treated the same way, except that hirudin (6 μm) was added to the mixture. The difference in rates is specific for thrombin amidolytic activity. Thrombin concentrations were evaluated from a standard curve prepared using serial dilutions of purified thrombin. 400 nm thrombin, 30 pm factor VIIa, 30 pm factor IXa, and 30 pm factor Xa were incubated at room temperature in HBS/CaCl2 containing 200 μm PCPS for 5 min (total volume of 200 μl). This mixture was added to 994 μl of HBS/EDTA containing hirudin (6 μm) and TAP (600 nm), followed by the addition of 50 μm6-(d-Leu-Pro-Arg)-amino-1-naphthalenepropylsulfonamide (LPRnps). The rate of substrate hydrolysis was evaluated. In the second part of this assay, 1 pm factor XIa was added to the enzyme mixture described above, and this mixture was treated the same way as the previous one. The factor XIa concentration was evaluated from the difference in substrate hydrolysis rates and from a standard curve prepared using serial dilutions of purified factor XIa. A similar factor XIa assay was carried out with a mixture containing 1.4 μm thrombin, 1 nm factor VIIa, 1 nm factor IXa, 1 nm factor Xa, and 15 pm factor XIa. These experiments were carried out using the procedures described in previous publications (10van ‘t Veer C. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4367-4377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 15Lawson J.H. Kalafatis M. Stram S. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23357-23366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 1) For experiments designed to evaluate the earliest events occurring during TF-induced thrombin generation, prothrombin (1.4 μm), factor IX (90 nm), factor X (170 nm), factor VII (10 nm), and factor VIIa (100 pm) were preincubated at 37 °C for 3 min and added to 20 nm factor V or factor Va, 0.7 nm factor VIII, and 1.25 pm TF relipidated on 200 μm PCPS (final concentrations in the reaction mixture). When indicated, factor V, factor VIII, or prothrombin was omitted, or 3 μm hirudin was added. At selected time points, three aliquots were removed for the following assays: (a) a 20-μl aliquot for the evaluation of factor V activation; (b) a 5-μl aliquot for the thrombin chromogenic assay using 200 μm substrate Spectrozyme TH (10van ‘t Veer C. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4367-4377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar); and (c) a 1200-μl aliquot for factor VIIa, factor Xa, and thrombin fluorogenic assays. Prothrombinase concentrations were calculated using a kcat for prothrombin activation of 83.6 s−1 (46Tans G. Janssen-Claessen T. Hemker H.C. Zwaal R.F.A. Rosing J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21864-21873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 2) In an experiment designed to evaluate the influence of factor XI on the activation process, 1.25 pm factor VIIa was incubated in HBS/CaCl2 for 20 min at 37 °C with 0.25 nm TF relipidated on 200 μm PCPS. Following incubation, factors V and VIII at the concentrations indicated in the previous experiment as well as 30 nm factor XI were added, and the activation reaction was started by the addition of prothrombin, factor IX, and factor X at the above concentrations. At selected time points, 5-μl aliquots were removed for the chromogenic thrombin assay (10van ‘t Veer C. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4367-4377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), and 400-μl aliquots were taken for a factor XIa assay. The factor XIa assay was based upon the observation that factor XI does not alter the thrombin generation rate in this experimental system. In this assay, 400-μl aliquots were quenched in 794 μl of HBS/EDTA containing standard concentrations of hirudin and TAP. The aliquots were transferred into cuvettes; 50 μm substrate LPRnps was added; and the rate of substrate hydrolysis was evaluated. The rate of the corresponding assay from the control experiment performed in the absence of factor XI was also evaluated, and the concentration of factor XIa was estimated from the difference in rates. 20-μl samples of the reaction mixture were quenched in 20 μl of 2% SDS, 0.06 m Tris, 10% glycerol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue, pH 6.8, and heated for 5 min at 95 °C. 17-μl subsamples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions on 4–12% polyacrylamide gel as described by Laemmli (47Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar). Following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for immunoblot analyses using the general techniques of Towbin et al. (48Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44923) Google Scholar). Membranes were blocked for nonspecific binding with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween. Generation of factor Va was followed by incubating blocked membranes for 1.5 h with either monoclonal antibody αHFV-9 (directed against the light chain) or αHFV-17 (directed against fragment 307–506 of the heavy chain). The products of factor V recognized by these antibodies were visualized using peroxidase-conjugated horse anti-mouse IgG and the chemiluminescence reagent Luminol (DuPont). Films were developed in a Kodak X-Omat and scanned for densitometric analysis using a ScanJet 4c/T scanner (Hewlett-Packard Co.). The specific quantitation of relatively low concentrations of various enzymes generated during the activation process is based upon the substrate's selectivity, the high sensitivity of the substrate leaving group for detection, and the selectivity of specific serine protease inhibitors such as hirudin (thrombin) and TAP (factor Xa). The factor VIIa assay is based upon the increase in amidolytic activity of this enzyme caused by TF under conditions that prevent activation of the zymogens present in the system (10 mm EDTA) (45Butenas S. Lawson J.H. Kalafatis M. Mann K.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3449-3456Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The results of control experiments performed with enzyme mixtures in the presence of PCPS, TAP, and/or hirudin at the concentrations present in the enzyme assays in coagulation factor activation experiments showed that the amidolytic activities of factor VIIa, factor Xa, thrombin, and factor XIa are recovered almost quantitatively. This observation is valid for low picomolar concentrations of factors VIIa and Xa measured in the presence of 10 nm thrombin (Table I), for 1 pm factor XIa measured in the presence of 400 nm thrombin, and for 0.3 nm factor VIIa and 1 nm factor Xa or 15 pm factor XIa measured in the presence of 1.4 μm thrombin. The amidolytic activities of thrombin and factor XIa were recovered at 100 and 113–120%, respectively. The amidolytic activities of factor Xa and factor VIIa were recovered at 88–112 and 103–109%, respectively. Thus, thrombin and factor XIa can be measured at femtomolar, factor Xa at 0.4 pm, and factor VIIa at 1 pm concentrations individually 2Butenas, S., DiLorenzo, M., and Mann, K. G. (1997) Thromb.

Open table in a new tab In an experiment initiated with 1.25 pmTF when both factors VII and VIIa were added to the zymogen mixture, the initiation or lag phase of thrombin generation evaluated using the chromogenic p-nitroanilide substrate Spectrozyme TH continued for ∼2 min (Fig. 1). Analyses of this phase employing a fluorogenic PNS substrate, VPRnbs (Fig. 2), showed undetectable thrombin generation (<0.2 pm) over the first 20 s after the reactants were mixed. However, the latter substrate allowed quantitation of the thrombin generated from 20 s to 2 min. By 30 s, the concentration of thrombin reached 0.60 pm. Subsequently, the thrombin concentration increased at a relatively constant rate until 60 s (open circles). No prothrombin activation was observed over an 8-min period when factor V was omitted from the reaction mixture (Fig. 2, open triangles). The substitution of 20 nm factor Va for factor V decreased the interval in which thrombin generation was undetectable from 20 to 10 s (closed circles). The transition to the explosive propagation phase of thrombin generation in the experiment started 18–20 s earlier with factor Va than observed in the experiment with factor V (50–55 and 70–73 s, respectively). In the absence of factor VIII (closed triangles), the thrombin generation rate during the initiation phase was similar to that observed in the presence of factor VIII. Analyses of the thrombin generation rates indicated that, during the initial 60 s, the concentration of prothrombinase (deduced from d[IIa]/dt) in the factor Va experiment increased from undetectable levels to 7 fm (Fig. 2, inset,closed circles). In the presence of factor V, whether factor VIII was present (open circles) or absent (closed triangles), the rise in prothrombinase concentration started at ∼50–60 s. When factor Va was substituted for factor V, the rise in prothrombinase concentration occurred at a similar rate, but 20 s earlier. In experiments with and without factor VIII, the first detectable amounts of factor Va heavy chain were observed at 30 s (Fig. 3, A and C, respectively), i.e. approximately at the same time when the first detectable amounts of thrombin (0.6–0.7 pm) (Fig. 2) were observed. However, the first detectable amounts of factor Va light chain (0.36 nm) were observed after a 70-s delay relative to the appearance of the heavy chain, i.e. at 100 s (Fig. 3 B). The cleavage of intact factor V in the presence or absence of factor VIII was complete at 100–120 s after the reactants were mixed (Fig. 3,A–C). This activation was obligately dependent on thrombin since in the presence of 3 μm hirudin, no activation of factor V was observed over a 4-min period (Fig. 3 D). In the complete, factor V-containing system, the first detectable amounts (8.4 pm) of factor Xa were observed 60 s after mixing the reagents (Fig. 4, open circles). This initial rate of factor Xa generation was not altered by the presence of 3 μm hirudin (closed circles), the absence of prothrombin (open triangles), or the absence of factor VIII (closed triangles). Significant prothrombinase activity began to form at 50–60 s (Fig. 2,inset), i.e. the time at which 5–10 pm factor Xa was present. A significant increase in the rate of factor Xa generation was observed a"

Angiotensin II (Ang II) has been implicated in the regulation of cellular lipoxygenases (LO), which are thought to play a role in atherogenesis by inducing oxidative modification of low density lipoprotein (LDL). We sought to test the hypothesis that Ang II would stimulate murine macrophage LO activity (which has both 12- and 15-LO activity). Competitive binding studies revealed the presence of Ang II AT1 receptors on mouse peritoneal macrophages (MPM) and J-774 cells, but not on the RAW cell line. Valsartan, a specific AT1 receptor antagonist inhibited Ang II binding, whereas PD 123319, an AT2 receptor antagonist did not. Incubation of MPM or J-774 cells with Ang II (10 pm to 1 μm) for 24 h led to a 2.5–3.5-fold increase in LO activity, measured as generated 13-HODE or 12(S)-HETE. This stimulation was inhibited by valsartan, but not by PD 123319. In contrast, Ang II did not stimulate LO activity in RAW macrophages. Semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction showed a 2–3-fold increase in LO mRNA in MPM, but not in RAW cells after treatment with Ang II. Ang II also induced an increase in 12-LO protein. In addition, pretreatment of J-774 cells with Ang II increased in a dose-dependent manner the ability of the cells to modify LDL, resulting in greater chemotactic activity for monocytes, typical of minimally modified LDL. This stimulation was inhibited by AT1 receptor blockade.In summary, these data suggest that Ang II increases macrophage LO activity via AT1 receptor-mediated mechanisms and this further increases the ability of the cells to generate minimally oxidized LDL. These studies provide a link between hypertension and the associated increased atherosclerosis observed in hypertensive patients.

These studies provide a link between hypertension and the associated increased atherosclerosis observed in hypertensive patients. The importance of high blood pressure as a risk factor for developing cardiovascular disease is well established. However, it has been found that drug therapies that successfully reduce blood pressure and the incidence of stroke do not necessarily reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with coronary artery disease (1MacMahon S.W. Cutler J.A. Furberg C.D. Payne G.H. Prog. Cardiovasc. Dis. 1986; 29: 99-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). These findings appear to indicate a multifactorial relationship between hypertension and atherosclerosis, suggesting that additional mechanisms, other than increased systemic blood pressure, contribute to the accelerated atherosclerosis associated with hypertension. Increased plasma or tissue levels of vasoactive hormones, such as Ang II, may play a role in such mechanisms, by inducing vascular cell growth in the vessel wall (2Berk B.C. Vekshtein V. Gordon H.M.

Foam cells, one of the hallmarks of atherosclerosis, develop when monocyte-derived macrophages or smooth muscle cells within the artery wall take up oxidized LDL via scavenger receptors. There is increasing evidence to suggest that certain cellular lipoxygenase (LO) enzymes are involved in this process by inducing oxidation of LDL (10Sparrow C.P. Parthasarathy S. Steinberg D. J. Lipid Res. 1988; 29: 745-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,11Parthasarathy S. Wieland E. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Evidence supporting a causal role of human 15-LO in LDL modification during atherosclerosis includes co-localization of 15-LO protein and mRNA with epitopes of oxidized LDL in macrophage-rich areas of atherosclerotic lesions (12Ylä-Herttuala S. Rosenfeld M.E. Parthasarathy S. Glass C.K. Sigal E. Witztum J.L. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6959-6963Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 13Ylä-Herttuala S.

Additionally, fibroblasts transfected with human 15-LO cDNA showed an enhanced ability to seed hydroperoxides into LDL incubated with such cells (16Benz D.J. Mol M. Ezaki M. Mori-Ito N. Zelan I.

Luoma J. Viita H. Hiltunen T. Sisto T. Nikkari T. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2692-2698Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Ang II has been shown to up-regulate both lipoxygenase activity and expression in human smooth muscle cells (19Kim J.A. Gu J.L. Natarajan R. Berliner J.A. Nadler J.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 942-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Murine macrophages and murine macrophage cell lines contain a “macrophage-type” lipoxygenase which possesses both 12- and 15-LO activity (20Sun D. Funk C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24055-24062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), which is highly homologous to human and rabbit 15-LO, the enzyme believed to play a role in the maturation of red blood cells and the oxidative modification of LDL (21Sigal E. Craik C.S. Highland E. Grunberger D. Costello L.L. Dixon R.A.F. Nadel J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 157: 457-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Accordingly, due to their dual specificity, these enzymes have been referred to as 12/15-LO (20Sun D. Funk C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24055-24062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). In contrast, not much is known about the role of vasoactive agents, such as Ang II, on macrophage function and metabolism. Although Ang II mediates some immunological responses, such as increased interferon-γ production and increased macrophage phagocytosis, the receptor subtype involved has not been defined (22Weinstock J.V. Blum A.M. J. Immunol. 1983; 131: 2529-2532PubMed Google Scholar, 23Fernandez-Castelo S. Arzt E.S. Pesce A. Criscuolo M.E. Diaz A. Finkielman S. Nahmod V.E. J.

Immunology. 1983; 48: 529-535PubMed Google Scholar). The present studies test the hypothesis that Ang II increases the oxidative modification of LDL by stimulating the activity of macrophage 12/15-LO through an Ang II-receptor-mediated pathway. We show that Ang II, through the Ang II AT1 receptor subtype, stimulates expression of 12/15-LO mRNA, protein, and activity in MPM and the J-774 cell line. In turn, this results in increased modification of LDL incubated with these cells, rendering it more chemotactic for human monocytes. Ang II (human), FMLP, indomethacin, Tyrode's salts, and glutaraldehyde were purchased from Sigma. [Sar1,Ile8]Ang II was from Bachem Fine Chemicals (Torrance, CA). Valsartan was a generous gift from Dr. M. de Gasparo (Novartis, Basel, Switzerland) and PD 123319 and PD 146176 were from Parke-Davis (Ann Arbor, MI). [14C]Linoleic acid (53.0 mCi/mmol), [125I-Sar1,Ile8]Ang II (0.2 nm, specific activity, 2200 Ci/mmol) and [3H]thymidine (35 Ci/mmol) were from NEN Life Science Products (Boston, MA). 13(S)-Hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (13-HODE) and eicosatetraynoic acid (ETYA) were purchased from Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI). HPLC grade water and methanol were obtained from Fischer (Fair Lawn, NJ). SDS gels were obtained from Novex (San Diego, CA), the enhanced chemiluminescence reagents were from Amersham, and the polyvinylidene fluoride blotting membranes were from Millipore (Bedford, MA). The peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-sheep was purchased from Cappel (Aurora, OH). The sheep antibody against rabbit reticulocyte 15-LO and authentic 15-LO protein were a generous gift from Dr. J. Cornicelli. Resident mouse peritoneal macrophages were harvested from C57BL/6J (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) by lavage with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were plated in 6-well plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA) and maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicilline, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine. Cells of the murine macrophage cell lines J-774 A.1 and RAW 264.7 (noted as J-774 and RAW, respectively) were kept in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 50 μg/ml gentamycin, and 2 mml-glutamine. The activity of 15-LO was determined as the rate of formation of14C-labeled 13-HODE measured by reverse-phase high performance chromatography (HPLC) from [14C]linoleic acid (16Benz D.J. Mol M. Ezaki M. Mori-Ito N. Zelan I. Miyanohara A. Friedmann T. Parthasarathy S. Steinberg D. Witztum J.L. J. Biol.

To determine which receptor subtype mediated the effects of Ang II, cells were first treated with Ang II receptor antagonists for 6 h before incubating them with Ang II. Protein content was determined after lysing the cells with 0.2 n NaOH using the bicinchoninic acid assay reagent (Pierce). These assays were performed according to previously published methods (27Natarajan R. Stern N. Hsueh W. Do Y. Nadler J. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1988; 67: 584-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Briefly, J-774 cells were treated for various times with Ang II and 12(S)-HETE was extracted from cell supernatants on C18 mini columns (Varian, Harbor City, CA) and measured by radioimmunoassay (Perceptive Diagnostics, Cambridge, MA). The 12-HETE antibody used for radioimmunoassay specifically recognizes 12(S)-HETE. Results were corrected for extraction recovery and data expressed as picogram/mg of cell protein. [125I-Sar1,Ile8]Ang II binding and competition assays were performed on adherent cells as described previously with minor modifications (28Guillon G. Gallo-Payet N. Balestre M.N. Lombard C. Biochem. J. 1988; 253: 765-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). 1.5 × 106 MPM, J-774, or RAW cells were preincubated in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 g/liter glucose and 1% BSA for 15 min at room temperature. It was established that binding equilibrium occurred after a 60-min incubation. Therefore, the cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of [125I-Sar1,Ile8]Ang II for 60 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by aspirating the supernatant and washing the cells with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Total cell-bound radioactivity was measured after lysing the cells with 0.2 n NaOH. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 μm cold [Sar1,Ile8]Ang II. Specific binding was calculated by substracting nonspecific from total binding. To determine the extent of binding via specific Ang II receptor subtypes, competition curves were performed in the presence of subtype-specific antagonists. Dissociation constant (Kd) and maximum binding (Bmax) were determined using non-linear least regression curve analysis according to the equation:b = c ×Bmax/(c + Kd), where b is bound radioligand, c is the radioligand concentration, Bmax is maximum binding, and Kd is the dissociation constant. The chemotactic response of human monocytes to FMLP, Ang II-, and/or LDL-containing media conditioned by exposure to cells was assessed in a 48-well chemotactic chamber (Neuroprobe, Cabin John, MD). Human mononuclear cells were isolated by Ficoll-Paque density centrifugation (29Berthold F. Blut. 1981; 43: 367-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). LDL (d = 1.019–1.063 g/ml) was isolated by density gradient ultracentrifugation from pooled healthy human plasma (30Havel R. Eder H. Bragdon J. J. Clin. Invest. 1955; 34: 1345-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (6479) Google Scholar). J-774, MPM, or RAW cells were plated in a 96-well plate. After incubation in the absence or presence of Ang II for 24 h, cells were carefully washed and incubated in the absence or presence of 250 μg/ml LDL in Ham's F-10 for another 24 h. The supernatants of the treated cells, in the absence or presence of LDL, with and without pretreatment with Ang II, as well as native LDL alone, were placed in the lower compartment of a chemotactic chamber which was separated from the upper compartment by a 5-μm pore-sized polycarbonate membrane (Poretics, Livermore, CA). 5 × 106 monocytes resuspended in 0.1% BSA/Tyrode per chamber were loaded in the upper wells. The cells were then incubated for 90 min at 37 °C (5% CO2, 100% humidity). The filters were washed and cells remaining on the upper surface of the filters were removed mechanically. After fixation in 1% glutaraldehyde and staining of the filters in 0.1% crystal violet, the number of migrated cells was counted microscopically. Each experimental condition was carried out in quadruplicate, and 6 fields were examined for each well encompassing 50–1000 cells. In additional experiments Ang II antagonists, lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase antagonists were incubated with macrophages for 6 h prior to addition of Ang II. FMLP (10 nm) in 0.1% BSA/Tyrode's salt buffer served as positive and 0.1% BSA/Tyrode's as negative control. The role of secreted low-molecular weight proteins into the medium (e.g. MCP-1) induced by minimally modified LDL (31Cushing S. Berliner J. Valente A. Territo M. Navab M. Parhami F. Gerrity R. Schwartz C. Fogelman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5134-5138Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar) was assessed after filtration of the cell supernatants. Cell supernatants were filtered through a 25,000 Mr cut-off filter cone (Amicon, Beverly, MA) at 1000 × g for 30 min. The 25,000 molecular mass cut-off was chosen to exclude low molecular mass compounds, such as MCP-1 which has a mass of 14 kDa (32Valente A. Graves D. Vialle-Valentin E. Delgado R. Schwartz C. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4162-4168Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The LDL fraction was diluted to the original LDL protein concentration. The filtrate and the remainder in the cone were assessed for chemotactic activity and compared with an aliquot of the supernatant prior to filtration. The mobility of LDL was determined by agarose gel electrophoresis (33Khouw A.S. Parthasarathy S. Witztum J.L. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1483-1496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The degree of LDL modification was also determined by the amount of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) (34Buege J.A. Aust S.D. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 52: 302-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (10774) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted from cultured J-774, RAW, and freshly isolated MPM treated with Ang II (RNAzol B, Tel-Test Inc., Friendswood, TX). 2.0–3.0 μg of RNA were reverse transcribed with PCR buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, 6 mm MgCl2, 10 mmdithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl), 2.5 mm of dNTP, 10 mg/ml BSA, 30 μm RNase inhibitor (RNasin), 3 μm oligo(dT)15 and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Supercript II 200 U, Life Technologies, Inc.) in a final volume of 50 μl. The samples were reverse transcribed in a thermal cycler at 72 °C for 4 min, 42 °C for 60 min, and 94 °C for 10 min. Murine 12-LO cDNA amplification was carried out by mixing 0.16 μg of cDNA in a 25-μl volume with 0.24 μm each of the 5′- and 3′-primer for 12-LO (5′-GTTTGGCTCCTGGGCAGACG-3′ and 5′-TTTCTACCAGGCTGGGCCGC-3′) and 0.75 units of Taq polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim). The primers were chosen based on the published sequence of the murine leukocyte 12-LO (35Chen X.-S. Kurre U. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Funk C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13979-13987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). They were encoded across several exons to exclude the possibility of DNA contamination. The resulting PCR product for 12-LO resulted in a single band of the predicted size (195 kilobases). As internal standard, GAPDH mRNA was coamplified by the addition of primers for murine GAPDH. To ensure that GAPDH amplification would not reach the plateau phase earlier than the target gene, addition of GAPDH primers was delayed, as described previously (36Kinoshita T. Imamura J. Nagai H. Shimotohno K. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 206: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). GAPDH primers (0.24 μm each of 5′- and 3′-primer; 5′-CTGCCATTTGCAGTGGCAAAGTGG-3′ and 5′-TTGTCATGGATGACCTTGGCCAGG-3′) were added after completion of the fifth extension phase. PCR was carried out with a denaturing step at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 66 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min for 30–35 cycles. Similar PCR conditions were used for the quantitative determination of GAPDH expression by competitive PCR, which confirmed that GAPDH expression in cells was constant and not affected by Ang II. The competitor cDNA was identical to the GAPDH PCR product, except for a 102-base pair deletion (kindly supplied by Dr. H. Lukhaup, Heidelberg). Six increasing concentrations of competitor (3–30 pg/μl) were used and the amount of PCR product formed was determined relative to the expression of GAPDH. Blank reactions with no RNA or cDNA template were carried out through the RT and PCR steps to test for possible contamination. The PCR products were electrophoresed on a 3% agarose gel (NuSieve, Rockland, ME) containing ethidium bromide and the intensity analyzed using Optimas 4.0 imaging software (Bioscan) and compared with GAPDH as internal control (37Fruebis, J., Gonzalez, V., Silvestre, M., and Palinski, W. (1996)Atheroscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol., in press.Google Scholar). Each image analysis was performed twice by the same observer. Gene expression was determined in triplicate. The identity of the amplified product from MPM and J-774 was confirmed by sequence analysis of the 12-LO product purified from agarose gels (data not shown). Cultured MPM were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in lysis buffer. Lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 8% gels and separated proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. Blots were blocked with 5% dry milk, incubated with sheep anti-15-LO antibody, and then incubated with peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-sheep antibody. Immunopositive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. Purified reticulocyte 15-LO was included as positive control; non-immune sheep IgG was used as negative control. This antibody has previously been shown to cross-react with both human and mouse 12/15-LO (38Cornicelli J.A. Welch K. Auerbach B. Feinmark S.J. Daugherty A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 1488-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Data are analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA). Student's two-tailed, unpaired t test was used to identify the groups between which the differences were significant. Data are represented as mean ± S.E., andp < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The presence of Ang II receptors and/or its receptor subtype have not been formally established on MPM or on macrophage cell lines. Therefore, we determined the parameters of Ang II binding to MPM, J-774, and RAW cell lines. Specific binding of [125I-Sar1,Ile8]Ang II to intact MPM or J-774 cells was saturable. Fig. 1 A shows representative saturation isotherms in MPM and in J-774 yielding an apparentKd value of 0.18 nm and aBmax of 0.80 fmol/mg protein in MPM and aKd of 0.50 nm andBmax 1.20 fmol/mg protein in J-774, respectively. No specific binding could be found on RAW cells (data not shown). Ang II-specific binding on J-774 and on MPM could be dose-dependently competed by valsartan, an AT1receptor antagonist with an IC50 of 1 nm, whereas PD 123319, an AT2 receptor blocker was not able to inhibit [125I-Sar1,Ile8]Ang II binding even at millimolar concentrations (Fig. 1 B). Incubation of MPM or J-774 cell lines with Ang II for 24 h induced a dose-dependent increase in 15-LO activity, as measured by the generation of 13-HODE from linoleic acid. An EC50 was apparent at 10 pm with a maximum response with 100 pm. Higher concentrations did not increase 15-LO activity any further (Fig. 2). In contrast, Ang II did not augment 15-LO activity in RAW cells (data not shown). The Ang II-induced increase was inhibited by 76% by 2 nmconcentration of the Ang II AT1 antagonist valsartan (Table I), similarly to its inhibition of Ang II binding (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, the AT2 receptor antagonists PD 123319 did not have any inhibitory effect (Table I). The antagonists alone had no effect on basal 15-LO activity and were not different from control (data not shown). None of the antagonists were toxic to cells in the concentration used, as evaluated by cell protein determination and trypan blue exclusion. Similarly, Ang II increased macrophage 12-LO activity. Treatment with Ang II at concentrations of 10−11 and 10−7m for 1 h significantly stimulated the release of 12(S)-HETE, as measured by radioimmunoassay in the J-774 cell line, in a dose-dependent manner (control, 262 ± 31; Ang II, 10 pm 488 ± 85; Ang II, 100 nm 955 ± 26 pg/mg protein, respectively).Table IEffect of Ang II receptor antagonists on Ang II-induced stimulation of 15-LO activityTreatment15-LO activity, 13-HODE (nmol/mg cell protein)Control73.5 ± 25.3Ang II162.6 ± 54.01-ap < 0.01 compared to control.Ang II + antagonist Valsartan (2 nm)94.9 ± 36.01-bp < 0.05 compared to Ang II alone.

Lipids were extracted and the amount of generated 13-HODE was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures” and corrected for non-cell control and expressed as nanomole/mg cell protein. Data are mean ± S.D. from four to five separate experiments in duplicates except for PD 123119, where two experiments each in duplicate were performed.1-a p < 0.01 compared to control.1-b p < 0.05 compared to Ang II alone. Open table in a new tab MPM were preincubated for 6 h with valsartan, an Ang II AT1 receptor antagonist, and with PD 123319, an AT2antagonist prior to the addition of Ang II (10−11m).

Data are mean ± S.D. from four to five separate experiments in duplicates except for PD 123119, where two experiments each in duplicate were performed. To determine if Ang II treatment of macrophages altered the level of 12/15-LO mRNA in MPM and in the J-774 macrophage cell line, semiquantitative RT-PCR was used to amplify the murine “macrophage-type” 12/15-LO (20Sun D. Funk C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24055-24062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). In the absence of Ang II, both murine macrophage cell lines, J-774 and RAW, as well as MPM contained the predicted 195-base pair sized product, consistent with the macrophage-type of 12/15-LO. The amplified product was confirmed to be of murine 12-LO origin by sequence analysis (data not shown). In response to incubation with Ang II over a range of 10 pm to 1 μm, expression of murine GAPDH remained constant in MPM and J-774 yielding a regression line of the ratio of GAPDH expression to exogenous GAPDH standard of r ≤ 0.995 for J-774 and 0.985 for MPM, respectively. Since GAPDH remained constant, the increase in 12/15-LO mRNA was expressed as a function of GAPDH. Ang II (1 nm) increased 12-LO mRNA expression in MPM starting at the 2-h incubation time, with a maximum increase of 2.8-fold after a 24-h incubation (Fig. 3). In contrast, Ang II did not have any effect on 12-LO mRNA expression in RAW cells (data not shown). To determine whether Ang II increased 12/15-LO activity in MPM through up-regulation of 12-LO protein, cells were treated for increasing periods of time with Ang II. Cell lysates were then prepared for SDS-PAGE, electroblotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes, and subjected to Western blot analysis using an antibody to rabbit reticulocyte LO, which was previously shown to cross-react with 12-LO in MPM (38Cornicelli J.A.

By affinity chromatography, using GST-TCPTP fusion proteins, we have isolated three cytoplasmic proteins of 120, 116, and 97 kDa that interact with TCPTP. The p120 protein associated with residues 377–415 from the C terminus of the 48-kDa form of TCPTP, whereas the recognition site for p97 and p116 was mapped to residues 350–381 encompassing the TCPTP nuclear localization sequence (NLS). The TCPTP NLS was shown to be bipartite, requiring basic residues 350–358 (basic cluster I) and 377–381 (basic cluster II), the sites of interaction with p97 and p116, for efficient nuclear translocation. The interaction between p97, p116, and the TCPTP NLS appeared unique in that these proteins did not form a stable interaction with the classical NLS of SV40 large T antigen or the standard bipartite NLS of nucleoplasmin. Sequence analysis of p97 identified it as the nuclear import factor p97 (importin-β), which is an essential component of the nuclear import machinery. In assaysin vitro in permeabilized cells, p97 was necessary but not sufficient for optimal nuclear import of TCPTP. We found that TCPTP co-immunoprecipitated with the nuclear import factor p97 from cell lysates and that purified recombinant p97 and TCPTP interacted directlyin vitro. These results indicate selectivity in the binding of p97 and p116 to the TCPTP NLS and suggest that p97 may mediate events that are distinct from the classical nuclear import process. Moreover, these results demonstrate that the C-terminal segment of TCPTP contains docking sites for interaction with proteins that may function to target the enzyme to defined intracellular locations and in the process regulate TCPTP function.

Protein tyrosine phosphorylation is an essential element in the control of fundamental cellular signaling events involved in proliferation and differentiation. The level of cellular tyrosine phosphorylation is determined by the activity of both protein-tyrosine kinases and protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) 1The abbreviations used are: PTP, protein tyrosine phosphatase; TCPTP, T-cell PTP; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; NLS, nuclear localization sequence; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; GST, glutathione S-transferase; DTT, dithiothreitol; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; IBB, importin-β binding; BSA, bovine serum albumin; NPL, nucleoplasmin; T-Ag, large T antigen.

Pharmacol. 1996; 36: 91-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Structurally, the PTPs are characterized by a conserved catalytic domain of approximately 240 residues and N- or C-terminal noncatalytic segments that frequently serve regulatory functions (1Tonks N.K. Neel B.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 365-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 2Tonks N.K. Adv. Pharmacol. 1996; 36: 91-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Like the protein tyrosine kinases, the PTPs can be subdivided into transmembrane and nontransmembrane forms (1Tonks N.K. Neel B.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 365-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 2Tonks N.K. Adv. Pharmacol. 1996; 36: 91-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The function of the PTPs can be modulated by interaction between the noncatalytic segment of these enzymes and various binding proteins (3Neel B.G. Semin. Cell Biol. 1993; 4: 419-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Protein-protein interactions have the potential to modulate PTP activity either by altering enzyme activity directly or by controlling intracellular localization. The cDNA encoding the T-cell PTP (TCPTP) was originally isolated from a human peripheral T-cell library (4Cool D.E. Tonks N.K. Charbonneau H. Walsh K.A. Fischer E.H. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5257-5261Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). This cDNA encodes a 48-kDa protein that displays 65% sequence identity overall with PTP1B and 74% sequence identity within the conserved catalytic domain. This enzyme is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues and has a modular structure comprising an N-terminal catalytic domain and a noncatalytic C-terminal segment. The 48-kDa TCPTP is primarily localized to the particulate fraction of cell extracts and requires treatment with detergent for extraction (5Cool D.E. Tonks N.K. Charbonneau H. Fischer E.H. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7280-7284Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 6Zander N.F. Lorenzen J.A. Cool D.E. Tonks N.K. Daum G. Krebs E.G. Fischer E.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6964-6970Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In contrast, a 37-kDa protein comprising the TCPTP catalytic domain and lacking the C-terminal segment is soluble (5Cool D.E. Tonks N.K. Charbonneau H. Fischer E.H. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7280-7284Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 6Zander N.F. Lorenzen J.A. Cool D.E. Tonks N.K. Daum G. Krebs E.G. Fischer E.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6964-6970Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), suggesting that the C-terminal segment is important for localization. Indeed a stretch of 19 hydrophobic residues at the extreme C terminus of TCPTP have been shown to be responsible for targeting the 48-kDa TCPTP to the ER (7Lorenzen J.A. Dadabay C.Y. Fischer E.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 631-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in gel filtration experiments the expressed 48-kDa TCPTP migrates as a high molecular weight complex of >600 kDa (5Cool D.E. Tonks N.K. Charbonneau H. Fischer E.H. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7280-7284Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), whereas the 37-kDa protein migrates at the expected molecular weight (5Cool D.E. Tonks N.K. Charbonneau H. Fischer E.H. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7280-7284Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the C-terminal segment of TCPTP may interact with other proteins and that such interacting proteins may have targeting functions. Alternative splicing of TCPTP message gives rise to a 45-kDa form that lacks the hydrophobic segment at the extreme C terminus (residues 382–418) (8Mosinger B. Tillmann U. Westphal H. Tremblay M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 499-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 9Champion-Arnaud P. Gesnel M.C. Foulkes N. Ronsin C. Sassone-Corsi P. Breathnach R.

Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 3030-3040Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A). This 45-kDa form of TCPTP is found in the nucleus, and a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) has been identified in the C-terminal segment (residues 350–381) (7Lorenzen J.A. Dadabay C.Y. Fischer E.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 631-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 10Tillmann U. Wagner J. Boerboom D. Westphal H. Tremblay M.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 3030-3040Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). As such, the 48- and 45-kDa forms of TCPTP are targeted to two distinct sites, the ER and the nucleus, respectively (7Lorenzen J.A. Dadabay C.Y. Fischer E.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 631-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). It seems probable that discrete protein-protein interactions involving the C-terminal segments of the two TCPTP variants may control their intracellular location. As a first step in understanding TCPTP function we have concentrated on identifying proteins that bind to the targeting segment of the phosphatase. In this study we have characterized three TCPTP-interacting proteins: the nuclear import factor p97 (importin-β) and two novel proteins, p116 and p120, that interact with distinct as well as overlapping sites within the TCPTP C terminus. pGEX-KG constructs encoding human TCPTP truncation mutants were generated by PCR using the clonedPfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Oligonucleotides incorporated a BamHI site immediately 5′ to the initiation codon and an EcoRI site immediately 3′ to the termination codon. The 5′ oligonucleotide used for generating truncation mutants of the full-length TCPTP (residues 1–415) was 5′-GGCTCCCGGATCCATGCCCACCACCATCGAGCGGGAG-3′, whereas that used for generating truncation mutants of the TCPTP C-terminal segment (residues 318–415) was 5′-GAATGGGGGATCCATAGGTCTAGAAGAAGAAAAACTG-3′. 3′ oligonucleotides used for generating TCPTP truncation mutants included an in frame stop codon prior to the EcoRI site (TC-(1–415), 3′-GACAAAAAAGTCGTTTTACGGGATATTCTTAAGTTAAAAG-5′; TC-(1–381) and TC-(318–381), 3′-CTCTTACTTGCTTTTTCTTTTTCCATTCTTAAGACCGTTC-5′; TC-(1–349) and TC-(318–349), 3′-CTCCTCTTGTCACTCTCACGAGATATTCTTAAGTAAGCTC-5′). cDNAs encoding the various TCPTP truncation mutants were subcloned into BamHI and EcoRI sites in the Escherichia coliexpression vector pGEX-KG to generate in frame glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusions. The pGEX TCPTP construct encoding residues 1–317 was a kind gift from Dr. D. Barford (Oxford University). pET-21a(+) (Novagen, Madison, WI) constructs encoding GST alone (pET-GST) or a GST fusion of the 48-kDa form of TCPTP (pET-GST-TCPTP48) were kind gifts from Drs. H. Charbonneau and Luning Hao (Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN). Recombinant pUC18 constructs encoding the human 45- and 48-kDa forms of TCPTP and the inactive 45-kDa C216S TCPTP mutant were a kind gift from Drs. J. A. Lorenzen and E. H. Fischer (University of Washington, Seattle, WA). The pUC18 TCPTP constructs were digested with EcoRI andHindIII, and cDNA fragments were subcloned into the pBluescriptR II KS (+) vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). pET-21a(+) TCPTP NLS deletion mutants were generated by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (Δ350–352, GAGGAGAACAGTGAGAGTGCTCTAATTCGAGAGGACAGAAAG; Δ350–358, GAGGAGAACAGTGAGAGTGCTCTAGCCACCACAGCTCAGAAGGTG; Δ377–381, CAGAGGCTAAATGAGAATGAATGGTTATATTGGCAACCTATTC) of the human 48-kDa TCPTP DNA in pBluescriptR II KS (+) and NcoI (internal site)/XhoI cDNA fragments exchanged with that of the pET-GST-TCPTP48 construct. The pGEX construct encoding nucleoplasmin (NPL) residues 88–200 was generated by subcloning theNcoI/EcoRI fragment from Bluescript-NPL (generously provided by Dr. Colin Dingwall, State University of New York at Stony Brook) into the SmaI/EcoRI sites of pGEX-KG after blunt ending the NcoI site. pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) constructs encoding the wild type 45-kDa TCPTP or the inactive C216S mutant were generated by subcloning BamHI/XhoI fragments from the respective TCPTP-Bluescript constructs. pSVL (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) constructs encoding the human 45- and 48-kDa forms of TCPTP were a kind gift from Drs. J. A. Lorenzen and E. H. Fischer (University of Washington, Seattle, WA) (7Lorenzen J.A. Dadabay C.Y. Fischer E.H. J.

The 5′ oligonucleotide used in PCR reactions corresponded to an internal XbaI site (5′-GAATAGGTCTAGAAGAAGAAAAACTGACAG-3′). The 3′ oligonucleotides used to generate the truncation constructs incorporated an in frame stop codon followed by a BamHI restriction site (TC-(1–376), 3′-CTTTGTCTCCGATTTACTCTTACTTATTCCTAGGTTTTCCACC-5′; TC-(1–359), 3′-GCATAAGCTCTCCTGTCTTTCCGGATTCCTAGGGTCTTCGGG-5′; TC-(1–349), 3′-CTCCTCTTGTCACTCTCACGAGATATTCCTAGGTAAGCTCTC-5′).XbaI/BamHI-digested PCR products were cloned into the XbaI/BamHI sites of the 45-kDa TCPTP pSVL construct. pSVL constructs encoding the 45-kDa form of TCPTP with residues 377–381 deleted (p45TCΔRKRKR) or residues 350–352 mutated to glutamine (p45TCR350Q/K351Q/R352Q) were a kind gift from Drs. J. A. Lorenzen and E. H. Fischer (University of Washington, Seattle, WA) (7Lorenzen J.A. Dadabay C.Y. Fischer E.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 631-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The pSVL construct encoding the 45-kDa form of TCPTP with residues 377–381 deleted as well as residues 350–352 mutated to glutamine was generated by PCR as described above for the pSVL truncation mutants using the p45TCR350Q/K351Q/R352Q construct as the template. The 3′ oligonucleotide used to prime the reaction was 3′-CTTGTCTCCGATTTACTCTTACTTGGTTCTAACTGTCTGTGGATTCCTAGGTACTGAACC-5′. The structures of the recombinant plasmids generated were confirmed by restriction endonuclease analysis and the sequence of cloned DNA confirmed by sequencing. TCPTP truncation mutants were expressed as GST fusion proteins in the E. colistrain DH5α using the expression vector pGEX-KG or in the E. coli strain BL21(DE3) using the expression plasmid pET-21a(+). GST fusion proteins were purified by affinity chromatography using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia). Histidine-tagged human p97 (11Chi N.C. Adam E.J.H. Adam S.A. J.

Histidine-tagged importin-α was a kind gift from Dr. Colin Dingwall. HeLa, NIH 3T3, WI 38, and COS1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. For metabolic labeling, cells were cultured on 10-cm plates to ∼70% confluence, rinsed with methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and subsequently starved in methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum for 1 h. Cells were incubated with 0.5 mCi/10-cm plate ofl-[35S]methionine Express Protein Labeling Mix (DuPont) for 8 h. Labeled cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in phosphate-buffered saline (1000 × g, 5 min). Harvested cells were frozen with liquid nitrogen and either stored at −70 °C or lysed and used immediately. Where indicated, [35S]Met-labeled HeLa cells (1 × 10-cm plate) were resuspended in 0.8 ml of lysis buffer containing Triton X-100 (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm iodoacetic acid) plus protease inhibitors (5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mmbenzamidine, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysates were precleared with 0.1 ml of IgG Sorb (The Enzyme Center, Malden, MA) for 1 h at 4 °C, DTT was added to 1 mm, and the supernatants (12,000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C) were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose coupled to 7.5 μg of GST, GST-1B-(1–435), GST-1B-(1–321), GST-1B-(290–435), GST-TC-(1–415), or GST-TC-(318–415) or approximately 15 μg of GST-TC-(1–317) for 2 h at 4 °C. Sepharose beads were washed with lysis buffer, and precipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. In all other cases [35S]Met-labeled HeLa cells (1 × 10-cm plate) were lysed in 0.8 ml of hypotonic lysis buffer (20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm iodoacetic acid) plus protease inhibitors. Cells were allowed to swell for 20 min at 4 °C and then homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer. DTT was added to 2 mm, and the lysates were centrifuged at 70,000 ×g, 4 °C for 20 min. Supernatants were made to 150 mm NaCl and 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100 and 0.4 ml of each supernatant was gently agitated for 3 h at 4 °C with 2.5 μl of glutathione-Sepharose containing approximately 3 μg of immobilized GST-TCPTP fusion protein. GST-TCPTP fusion proteins were standardized for the apparent full-length protein. Sepharose beads were then collected by centrifugation and washed with lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl and 0.5% Triton X-100. Precipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized following autoradiography. [35S]Met-labeled HeLa cells (2 × 10-cm plate) were resuspended in 1.2 ml of buffer A (20 mmTris·HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm KCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 5 mm iodoacetic acid, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm benzamidine, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and allowed to swell for 20 min at 4 °C. The volume of one-half of the cell suspension was made to 1.2 ml with buffer B (100 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.6, 0.5 m sucrose, 10 mm EDTA, 5 mm iodoacetic acid, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mmbenzamidine, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 1.0% (w/v), and the lysate was homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer (20 strokes) to yield the Triton X-100 lysate. The other half of the cell suspension was also homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer (20 strokes), and an equal volume of buffer B was added. This cell lysate was subsequently centrifuged at 1000 × g, 4 °C for 5 min. The pellet was resuspended in 1.2 ml of a 1:1 mixture of buffers A and B, Triton X-100 was added to 0.5% (w/v), and the lysate was termed the nuclear fraction. The supernatant was centrifuged at 70,000 ×g, for 10 min, and the subsequent supernatant was termed the high speed supernatant. The pellet was resuspended in 1.2 ml of a 1:1 mixture of buffers A and B, and Triton X-100 was added to 1.0% (w/v). The resuspended pellet was incubated on ice for 60 min and centrifuged at 70,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was termed the membrane fraction. 250 μl of each fraction was mixed with 2.5 μl of glutathione-Sepharose containing ∼2 μg of immobilized GST or GST-TCPTP fusion protein, and the mixture was agitated for 3 h at 4 °C. Sepharose beads were then collected by centrifugation and washed six times with buffer C (50 mmTris·HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm benzamidine, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Precipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized following autoradiography. For preparative isolation of TCPTP-binding proteins, 2.5 × 109 HeLa cells were resuspended in 40 ml of hypotonic lysis buffer, incubated on ice for 20 min, and homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer. All subsequent procedures were at 4 °C. The lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and the resulting supernatant was brought to 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100 and 2 mm DTT and applied to ∼400 μg of either GST-TC-(318–415) or GST-TC-(1–317) immobilized on 200 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads. The slurry was agitated for 2 h, and the beads were collected and washed with hypotonic lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100, and 2 mm DTT. Sepharose beads were then resuspended in sample buffer, and TCPTP-binding proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G (chromatographically purified and recrystallized) (Sigma). Individual protein bands were excised and digested in situ with 500 ng of Achromobacter protease I (Wako, Richmond, VA) in 100 mm Tris·HCl, pH 9.0, and 0.1% (w/v) Tween 20 for 20 h at 30 °C. Digests were resolved by chromatography on reverse phase HPLC, and individual peptides were sequenced on an Applied Biosystems protein sequencer. HeLa cells from 2 × 10-cm plates (70% confluent) were resuspended in 0.8 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 400 mm NaCl, 5 mmiodoacetic acid) plus protease inhibitors and agitated at 4 °C for 20 min. Lysates were then diluted with 1 volume of the same buffer without NaCl and precleared with 0.1 ml of IgG Sorb for 1 h at 4 °C. Precleared lysates were centrifuged (12,000 ×g, 5 min, 4 °C), and TCPTP or p97 was immunoprecipitated from supernatants with 20 μg of either the monoclonal anti-TCPTP CF4 (generously provided by Dr. David Hill, Calbiochem Oncogene Research Products, Cambridge, MA) or the anti-p97 mAb3E9 (11Chi N.C. Adam E.J.H. Adam S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), respectively, for 5 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were collected on Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Pharmacia), washed with lysis buffer containing 200 mm NaCl, resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto Immobilon (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Immunoblots were probed with either anti-TCPTP CF4 antibody or anti-p97 mAb3E9 antibody at 1 μg/ml. Approximately 5 μg of either GST, GST-TCPTP deletion mutants, or GST-TC-(318–415) were immobilized on 5 μl of glutathione-Sepharose and agitated at 4 °C for periods ranging from 4 h to overnight as indicated with either 5 or 10 μg of purified p97 or p97-(1–847) or with 10 or 20 μg of purified importin-α in 0.5 ml of binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm DTT). Precipitates were washed five times with the same buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. COS1 cells were seeded onto glass coverslips at 2.5–3 × 105/60-mm plate 24 h prior to transfection. Cells were transfected (10 μg of plasmid DNA) by the calcium phosphate precipitation method and processed for immunofluorescence at 36–48 h post-transfection as described previously (7Lorenzen J.A. Dadabay C.Y. Fischer E.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 631-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Affinity-purified polyclonal anti-TCPTP antibody 6228 (obtained from J. A Lorenzen and E. H. Fischer, University of Washington, Seattle, WA) was applied at 0.8 μg/ml for 1 h. [35S]Met-labeled HeLa cells from 4 × 10-cm dishes were resuspended in 2 ml of hypotonic lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors, homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer, and lysate was clarified at 70,000 × g, 4 °C for 20 min. NaCl was added to the supernatant to a concentration of 150 mm and concentrated 10-fold using a Centricon 10 microconcentrator (Amicon, Beverly, MA) previously blocked with 5 mg/ml BSA in lysis buffer. Concentrated supernatant was agitated at 4 °C for 1 h with 100 μg of biotinylated BSA-SV40 NLS (CGGGPKKKRKVED) conjugate or glutathione-Sepharose coupled to 10 μg of either GST-TC-(318–381), or GST-NPL-(88–200). 50 μl of streptavidin-agarose (Sigma) was then added to the biotinylated conjugates, and the incubation of all samples continued for a further 1 h. Precipitates were collected by centrifugation, washed with lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by autoradiography. GST-fusion protein GST-TC-(318–349) lacking the TCPTP NLS and biotinylated BSA-mutant SV40 NLS (CGGGPKNKRKVED) conjugate were used as controls. SV40 NLS peptide (CGGGPKKKRKVED) and mutant SV40 NLS peptide (CGGGPKNKRKVED) were coupled to BSA with the heterobifunctional cross-linker Sulfo-SMCC (Pierce). BSA conjugates contained 20 peptide molecules/BSA molecule as estimated by electrophoretic mobility. Biotin was coupled to the BSA conjugates at a 4:1 molar ratio using Biotin-X-NHS, WS (Calbiochem). Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells were grown on glass coverslips and permeabilized with digitonin as described previously (13Adam S.A. Marr R.S. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar, 14Adam E.J.H. Adam S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Either SV40 large T antigen NLS-allophycocyanin conjugate or recombinant 45-kDa TCPTP was used as a substrate in import reactions. The SV40 large T antigen NLS peptide was conjugated to allophycocyanin at a ratio of 5 mol/mol as described previously (15Chi N.C. Adam E.J.H. Visser G.D. Adam S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 559-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Recombinant 45-kDa TCPTP, expressed in E. coli using the pET21 expression vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) and purified to homogeneity by ion exchange followed by gel filtration chromatography, was a kind gift from Drs. H. Charbonneau and Luning Hao (Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN). Import experiments were performed in a 50-μl volume containing purified transport factors (400 nm importin-α, 400 nm p97, 1 μm Ran-GDP, and 1 μm RanBP1) and either 1 μg of the SV40 NLS-allophycocyanin substrate or 2 μg of the recombinant 45-kDa TCPTP as described previously (15Chi N.C. Adam E.J.H. Visser G.D. Adam S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 559-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). TCPTP and PTP1B are closely related nontransmembrane PTPs. Structurally they both comprise a catalytic domain linked at its C-terminal end to a noncatalytic, targeting segment (Fig. 1). To identify proteins that interact with the C termini of these two enzymes, GST fusion proteins of the C-terminal segments of TCPTP and PTP1B were expressed in E. coli and purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads. GST fusion proteins of the catalytic domains of TCPTP and PTP1B were also produced and used as controls. The immobilized fusion proteins were incubated with Triton X-100 lysates of [35S]Met-labeled HeLa cells, and associated proteins were precipitated (Fig. 2). The results indicated that, whereas many proteins were retained by GST-PTP1B but not GST control, these proteins all interacted with the catalytic domain of PTP1B (GST-1B-(1–321)) and not with the C-terminal segment (GST-1B-(290–435)). In contrast, GST-TCPTP interacted with three proteins of 97 kDa (p97), 116 kDa (p116), and 120 kDa (p120) that were precipitated by its C-terminal segment (GST-TC-(318–415)) but not by its catalytic domain (GST-TC-(1–317)) (Fig. 2). Most striking was the ability of TCPTP to precipitate sufficient quantities of p97 and p120 from ∼5 × 106 HeLa cells for detection of the proteins by Coomassie Blue staining of the gel, indicating that these associated proteins readily formed highly stable complexes with the TCPTP C terminus (data not shown). With the exception of material derived from GST, no other proteins could be discerned in these precipitates. We have concentrated on characterizing these TCPTP-interacting proteins for two reasons. First, their primary site of interaction appeared to be in the C-terminal segment of TCPTP, and second, they appeared to be specific for the C terminus of TCPTP and not PTP1B. Cellular fractionation of [35S]Met-labeled HeLa cells and subsequent precipitation with the GST-TCPTP fusion proteins illustrated that p97, p116, and p120 were present predominantly in a high speed (70,000 × g) supernatant (Fig. 3), indicating that they are primarily cytoplasmic.Figure 3Cellular fractionation of TCPTP-interacting proteins. [35S]Met-labeled HeLa cells were fractionated as described under “Materials and Methods” and TCPTP-interacting proteins precipitated from either Triton X-100 lysates (TxL), high speed supernatants (HSS), nuclear fractions (Nucl), or membrane fractions (Memb). Precipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The extreme C-terminal hydrophobic residues of the 48-kDa form of TCPTP are essential for targeting to the ER, whereas residues 350–381 encompass an NLS essential for the nuclear import of the 45-kDa form (Fig. 1 A) (7Lorenzen J.A. Dadabay C.Y. Fischer E.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 631-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 10Tillmann U. Wagner J. Boerboom D. Westphal H. Tremblay M.L. Mol.

As such, association of the TCPTP-interacting proteins with residues within the TCPTP NLS or the hydrophobic C terminus would be consistent with a role in targeting TCPTP to the ER or to the nucleus.

The Cox enzyme possesses oxygenase and peroxidase activities and thus catalyzes the formation of PGH2 from arachidonic acid (2Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Dixon F.J. Advances in Immunology. 62. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1996: 167-215Google Scholar). Two genes, designated as Cox-1 and -2 encode for the Cox isoenzymes (2Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Dixon F.J. Advances in Immunology. 62. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1996: 167-215Google Scholar). Both isoenzymes exhibit similar enzymatic properties; however, the Cox-1 enzyme is ubiquitously expressed, whereas the Cox-2 isoenzyme is expressed as an immediate-early gene after stimulation by a wide variety of extracellular stimuli (3Herschman H.R. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1994; 13: 241-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Gene knock-out studies have suggested that Cox-1 and -2 isoenzymes possess distinct functions (4Dinchuk J.E.

In addition, subcellular localization of the Cox isoenzymes exhibits differences. The Cox-2 enzyme is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as well as the nuclear envelope, whereas the Cox-1 enzyme is localized primarily in the ER (7Morita I. Schindler M. Regier M.K.

These studies suggest that Cox-1 and -2 isoenzymes possess overlapping as well as distinct functions. Prostanoids synthesized from both Cox-1 and -2 pathways can function as extracellular or intranuclear messengers (1Smith W.L. Garavito R.M. DeWitt D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33157-33160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1858) Google Scholar, 2Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Dixon F.J. Advances in Immunology. 62. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1996: 167-215Google Scholar). Classical prostanoids such as PGF2α and PGE2 are secreted extracellularly and mediate their effects via the plasma membrane G-protein-coupled receptors (8Coleman R.A. Smith W.L. Narumiya S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 205-229PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, PGJ2 and PGA2 accumulate in the nucleus and activate the peroxisomal proliferator activator receptor γ family of transcription factors (9Forman B.M. Tontonoz P. Chen J. Brun R.P. Spiegelman B.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 803-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2737) Google Scholar). Differential subcellular localization may be important in determining the nuclear versus extracellular action of prostanoids. In addition, it is not known if the two isoenzymes can suffice for each other for nuclear versus extracellular actions. The Cox-2 gene is overexpressed in several proliferative pathological conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and colon cancer (10Sano H. Hla T. Maier J. Crofford L. Case J. Maciag T. Wilder R. J.

Hunter D.J. Stampfer M.J. Colditz G.A. Willett W.C. Speizer F.E. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 333: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar) and because nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as sulindac block tumorigenesis in experimental murine models of colon cancer (14Reddy B.S. Maruyama H. Kellorf G. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 5340-5347PubMed Google Scholar), it is assumed that the Cox isoenzymes may play causative roles in tumor initiation and/or promotion. Prostanoid synthesis is generally enhanced in tumors (15Rigas B. Goldman I.S. Levine L. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1993; 122: 518-523PubMed Google Scholar), and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs inhibit the growth of certain well established tumor cell lines in vitroand in athymic mice (16Peterson H. Invasion Metastasis. 1983; 3: 151-159PubMed Google Scholar). However, evidence that the Cox enzymes are necessary for tumor initiation and/or promotion is recently inferred from studies in the murine system. For example, mating of tumor suppressor APC gene knock-out mice, which develop spontaneous intestinal polyps, with the Cox-2 knock-out mice resulted in the suppression of polyp formation. In addition, a specific pharmacological inhibitor of Cox-2 also inhibited polyp formation (17Oshima M. Dinchuk J.E. Kargman S. Oshima H. Hancock B. Kwong E. Trzaskos J.M. Evans J.F. Taketo M.M.

However, even in Cox-2 −/−, APC −/− animals, significant polyp formation was observed, suggesting that Cox-1 is able to substitute for the function of Cox-2 and participate in the development of colon cancer. In a recent report, resveratrol, a natural product found in grapes, was found to be a potent inhibitor of both the peroxidase and cyclooxygease activities of Cox-1 preferentially (18Jang M. Cai L. Udeani G.O. Slowing K.V. Thomas C.F. Beecher C.W.W. Fong H.H.S. Farnsworth N.R. Kinghorn A.D. Metha R.G. Moon R.C. Pezzuto J.M. Science. 1996; 275: 218-220Crossref Scopus (4547) Google Scholar). Interestingly, resveratrol inhibited all three phases of carcinogenesis, namely, initiation, promotion, and progression. The mechanisms responsible for the functional role of Cox enzymes in tumorigenesis, however, is poorly understood. Overexpression of the Cox-2 enzyme in a gastrointestinal epithelial cell line is associated with the inhibition of apoptosis (19Tsujii M. DuBois R.N. Cell. 1995; 83: 493-501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2139) Google Scholar) and altered cell cycle kinetics (20DuBois R.N. Shao J. Tsujii M. Sheng H. Beauchamp R.D. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 733-737PubMed Google Scholar). Because cells resistant to apoptosis may be prone to mutagenic events, inhibition of apoptosis is a potential mechanism for Cox-induced tumorigenesis. However, overexpression of Cox isoenzymes in other cell types promotes rather than inhibits apoptosis (see “Results and Discussion”). Exaggerated and dysregulated angiogenesis may be another mechanism via which Cox isoenzyme overexpression may regulate tumorigenesis. Dysregulated angiogenesis is a major hallmark of tumors and is thought to be necessary for the successful growth of many if not all solid tumors (21Weidner N. Folkman J. Important Adv Oncol. 1996; 136: 167-190Google Scholar). PGE2, a major prostanoid produced by a variety of tumors (15Rigas B. Goldman I.S. Levine L. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1993; 122: 518-523PubMed Google Scholar), induces the production of angiogenic growth factors such as vascular endothelial cell growth factor (22Ben-Av P. Crofford L.J. Wilder R.L. Hla T. FEBS Lett. 1995; 372: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar) and induces angiogenesisin vivo (23Ziche M. Jones J. Gullino P.M. J. Natl. Canc. Inst. 1982; 69: 475-482PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we investigated the relationship between the overexpression of the Cox-1 isoenzyme and tumorigenesis. ECV304 cells (24Takahashi K. Sawasaki Y. Hata J. Mukai K. Goto T. In Vitro Cell. & Dev. Biol. 1990; 26: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar) (CRL1994) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) and were grown in medium 199 containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone) and antibiotic/antimycotic mixture (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were transfected with an expression vector pCDNA-I-Neo (Invitrogen) containing the 1.8-kilobase open reading frame of human Cox-1 or Cox-2 cDNAs (25Hla T. Neilson K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7384-7388Crossref PubMed Scopus (1488) Google Scholar). The characterization of Cox-1 and -2 cDNAs and expression of respective polypeptides have been described previously (25Hla T. Neilson K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7384-7388Crossref PubMed Scopus (1488) Google Scholar, 26Crofford L.J. Wilder R.L. Ristimäki A.P. Sano H. Remmers E.F. Epps H.R. Hla T. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1095-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Transfection was achieved by a liposome-mediated method using Lipofectamine™ (Life Technologies, Inc.). After transfection, cells were split and selected in growth medium containing 1 mg/ml of G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Expression of transgenes was assessed (see below) in pools of transfected cells (ECV-neo and ECV-Cox-1) after 3 weeks of selection. Two independently derived pools of transfected cells (for both Cox-1 and neo) were used in the studies described below. For cell growth assays, ECV-Cox-1 and ECV-neo cells (104 cells/well) were plated in six-well tissue culture plates containing normal growth medium plus G418. Cell numbers were obtained by trypsinization and counting the cells in a Coulter counter. To induce apoptosis, subconfluent ECV cells were treated for 16 h with 100 ng/ml of TNF-α (R & D Systems) and 10 μg/ml of cycloheximide (Sigma). This treatment was shown previously to induce apoptosis of endothelial cells (27Polunovsky V.A. Peterson M.S. Ingbar D.H. Wendt C.H. Bitterman P.B. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 214: 584-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). After 16 h, apoptotic bodies were determined by staining with propidium iodide and counting under a fluorescence microscope. Total RNA from ECV-neo or ECV-Cox-1 cells were isolated by guanidinium isothiocyanate/phenol procedure (28Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63222) Google Scholar). RNA was separated by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and transferred onto a nylon membrane, and Northern blot analysis was conducted using the radiolabeled Cox-1 probe as described previously (29Ristimäki A. Garfinkel S. Wessendorf J. Maciag T. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11769-11775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Western blot analysis was conducted using the polyclonal Cox-1 antiserum as described before (12Sano H. Kawahito Y. Wilder R.L. Hashiramoto A. Mukai S. Asai K. Kimura S. Kato H. Kondo M. Hla T. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3785-3789PubMed Google Scholar). ECV cells were superfused with 12.5 μm [14C]arachidonic acid (NEN Life Science Products) in plain medium 199 for 15 min at 37 °C. Medium was then acidified and extracted, and TLC analysis of prostanoids was conduced using the solvent system Iw as described previously (25Hla T. Neilson K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7384-7388Crossref PubMed Scopus (1488) Google Scholar). Prostanoids were identified by comparison ofRf values of authentic standards (Cayman Chemical). The TLC plates were then autoradiographed. Equal numbers (107) of ECV-neo and ECV-Cox-1 cells were trypsinized, resuspended in 200 μl of sterile phosphate-buffered saline, and injected intradermally into athymic nu−/nu− “nude” mice. Tumor volume was measured at indicated time points (30Forough R. Zhan X. MacPhee M. Friedman S. Engleka K.A. Sayers T. Wiltrout R.H. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2960-2968Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Upon completion of the experiments, mice were inspected for the appearance of metastases in major organs by gross as well as by histological procedures (see below). ECV-Cox-1 cells were grown on glass coverslips and fixed in 10% formalin for 24 h and 70% ethanol for at least 24 h. Cells were then subjected to immunostaining with 1:100 dilution of anti-Cox-1 antibody. This antiserum was determined to be selective for Cox-1 by Western blot procedures of expressed human Cox-1 and -2 polypeptides in Cos-7 cells (8Coleman R.A. Smith W.L. Narumiya S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 205-229PubMed Google Scholar, 10Sano H. Hla T. Maier J. Crofford L. Case J. Maciag T. Wilder R. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). For immunohistochemistry, antibody staining was visualized using a second antibody coupled to peroxidase (ABC kit, Vector Laboratories). Tumor tissues were dissected, fixed as above, and immunostained with anti-Cox-1 antibody (12Sano H. Kawahito Y. Wilder R.L. Hashiramoto A. Mukai S. Asai K. Kimura S. Kato H. Kondo M. Hla T. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3785-3789PubMed Google Scholar) and anti-von Willebrand factor antibody (DAKO Inc.). The ECV cell line is derived from spontaneous immortalization of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) (24Takahashi K. Sawasaki Y. Hata J. Mukai K. Goto T. In Vitro Cell. & Dev. Biol. 1990; 26: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Although these cells retain several endothelial cell markers, such as induction of E-selectin and the formation of capillary-like tubular structures (24Takahashi K. Sawasaki Y. Hata J. Mukai K. Goto T. In Vitro Cell. & Dev. Biol. 1990; 26: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 29Ristimäki A. Garfinkel S. Wessendorf J. Maciag T. Hla T. J. Biol.

Cell Res. 1996; 225: 171-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), the growth properties of these cells are significantly different from that of the parental HUVEC. For example, ECV cells proliferate maximally in serum containing medium alone, whereas HUVEC require growth factors such as fibroblast growth factor for survival (24Takahashi K. Sawasaki Y. Hata J. Mukai K. Goto T. In Vitro Cell. & Dev. Biol. 1990; 26: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 27Polunovsky V.A. Peterson M.S. Ingbar D.H. Wendt C.H. Bitterman P.B. Exp.

Chem. 1994; 269: 11769-11775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, ECV cells are immortalized and do not exhibit the phenomenon of in vitro senescence, whereas HUVEC do (24Takahashi K. Sawasaki Y. Hata J. Mukai K. Goto T. In Vitro Cell. & Dev. Biol. 1990; 26: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 27Polunovsky V.A. Peterson M.S. Ingbar D.H. Wendt C.H. Bitterman P.B. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 214: 584-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 31Hughes S.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 225: 171-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). ECV cells do not express either Cox-1 or -2 genes under basal conditions (29Ristimäki A. Garfinkel S. Wessendorf J. Maciag T. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11769-11775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, stimulation with phorbol myristic acetate or interleukin-1 results in the dramatic up-regulation of Cox-2 expression and the inhibition of cell growth (29Ristimäki A. Garfinkel S. Wessendorf J. Maciag T. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11769-11775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, no Cox-1 expression was detected. Cox-1 and -2 cDNAs in the expression vector pCDNANeo were transfected into ECV cells, and G418-resistant cells were selected. Although numerous G418-resistant colonies (approximately 50 colonies/100-mm dish) were obtained from the Cox-1-transfected ECV cells, very few were obtained from Cox-2 transfection. When assayed for the expression of the transgene by Northern blot analysis, several slow growing ECV colonies expressed low but detectable levels of the Cox-2 transcript. These cells, however, exhibited poor survival in serum-containing medium, even in the presence of Cox inhibitors (10 μm indomethacin or NS-398). Numerous apoptotic cells were observed in these colonies. After several weeks of culture, the expression of Cox-2 was lost and rapid growth of these cells resumed. These studies suggested that Cox-2 overexpression in ECV cells conferred a growth disadvantage. In contrast to intestinal epithelial cells (19Tsujii M. DuBois R.N. Cell. 1995; 83: 493-501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2139) Google Scholar), Cox-2 overexpression may induce apoptosis in endothelial cells. These colonies were not further studied. In contrast, robust expression of Cox-1 cDNA was observed in stably transfected ECV cells, and the transfectants were further characterized. These cells and the vector-transfected counterparts were grown in medium containing 1 mg/ml of G418. The expression of the transfected gene was assessed by Northern and Western blot analyses. As shown in Fig. 1 a, high levels of the polypeptide and the mRNA for Cox-1 was detected in ECV-Cox-1 cells, whereas the vector-transfected ECV-neo cells did not express detectable levels of Cox-1 mRNA and protein. The functionality of the transfected Cox-1 cDNA was assessed by measuring the production of prostanoids after incubating the cells with [14C]arachidonic acid. Prostanoids were extracted from the medium, analyzed by thin layer chromatography, and visualized by autoradiography as described (25Hla T. Neilson K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7384-7388Crossref PubMed Scopus (1488) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 a, significant production of 6-keto-PGF1α, a stable metabolite of prostacyclin and PGF2α and PGE2as well as several unidentified arachidonic acid metabolites were observed. Vector-transfected ECV-neo cells did not metabolize exogenous [14C]arachidonic acid, which is consistent with the nondetectable expression of the Cox-1 and -2 isoenzymes in these cells. These data suggest that high level expression of the transfected Cox-1 gene was achieved in ECV cells. The Cox-1 and -2 polypeptides were shown to be localized in different subcellular compartments in NIH 3T3 cells, transfected Cos cells, and endothelial cells (7Morita I. Schindler M. Regier M.K. Otto J.C. Hori T. DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10902-10908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Although the Cox-1 isoenzyme was localized primarily in the ER, the Cox-2 polypeptide was observed in both ER and nuclear compartments (1Smith W.L. Garavito R.M. DeWitt D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33157-33160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1858) Google Scholar, 2Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Dixon F.J. Advances in Immunology. 62.

Chem. 1995; 270: 10902-10908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Because products of the Cox isoenzymes may have functions extracellularly (8Coleman R.A. Smith W.L. Narumiya S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 205-229PubMed Google Scholar) as well as intranuclearly (9Forman B.M. Tontonoz P. Chen J. Brun R.P. Spiegelman B.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 803-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2737) Google Scholar), we characterized the localization of the overexpressed Cox-1 polypeptide in stably transfected ECV cells. Immunohistochemical analysis with the polyclonal antiserum against Cox-1 on ECV-neo cells did not indicate appreciable staining, consistent with nondetectable expression of Cox-1 in these cells. However, high expression of Cox-1 immunoreactivity was seen in cobblestone-shaped ECV-Cox-1 cells (Fig. 1 b). Strong immunoreactivity was observed in the nuclear membrane, within the nucleus and the ER. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy confirmed these results (data not shown). These data suggest that overexpression of Cox-1 in ECV cells resulted in the localization in the ER and the nucleus. The nuclear localization of Cox-1 could be due to high intracellular concentration of this polypeptide, which is achieved by overexpression. Alternatively, it could be due to a characteristic unique to the immortalized nature of the ECV endothelial cells. To determine if elevated Cox-1 expression in ECV cells resulted in the aberrant regulation of growth or apoptosis, we measured the growth rate of ECV-Cox-1 cells and compared it with that of ECV-neo cells. As shown in Fig. 2 a, both ECV-Cox-1 and ECV-neo cells proliferated; however, the growth of ECV-Cox-1 cells was reduced (approximately 45%) at day 7. The doubling times of the ECV-Cox-1 and ECV-neo cells were 23.32 and 23.28 h, respectively. The growth rates of both cell lines were not modulated significantly by varying the serum concentration. These data suggest that Cox-1 overexpression resulted in modest inhibition of in vitro growth rate of ECV cells. The effect of Cox-1 overexpression on the apoptosis of ECV cells was assessed next. Treatment of ECV cells with TNF-α and cycloheximide potently induced apoptosis within 16 h. The rate of apoptosis of ECV-Cox-1 cells was enhanced approximately 2-fold compared with the ECV-neo cells (Fig. 2 b). These data suggest that Cox-1 overexpression enhances the TNF-induced apoptosis of ECV cells in vitro. Enhanced apoptosis in ECV-Cox-1 cells perhaps was the reason why the growth rates of these cells were blunted in vitro (Fig. 2 a). Interestingly, inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis with 2 μm indomethacin did not block enhanced apoptosis in ECV-Cox-1 cells, suggesting that the ability of Cox-1 to promote apoptosis is dissociable from its enzymatic property of prostaglandin synthesis. Thus, overexpression of Cox-1 in ECV cells does not dramatically alter the in vitro phenotype of ECV cells. For example, the morphology of Cox-1 transfected cellsin vitro is indistinguishable from ECV-neo cells in that both cell lines undergo contact inhibition, fail to grow under anchorage-independent conditions, and exhibit a cobble-stone morphology typical of endothelial cells. However, reduction in growth rate and enhanced response to TNF-α-induced apoptosis was observed. To test the tumorigenic potential of Cox-1, ECV-neo and ECV-Cox-1 cells were injected subcutaneously into the athymic nude mice. Although ECV cells are immortalized, they are not transformed (24Takahashi K. Sawasaki Y. Hata J. Mukai K. Goto T. In Vitro Cell. & Dev. Biol. 1990; 26: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). ECV-neo cells behaved similarly and did not grow as tumors at the site of injection or at distant sites. In contrast, ECV-Cox-1 cells grew aggressively as tumors (Fig. 3 a). Large tumors that are frequently red on the surface grew at the site of injection; however, distant metastases were not observed. These data suggest that Cox-1 overexpression induces tumorigenic transformation of ECV cells in vivo. To determine if secretion of prostanoids by the transfected Cox-1 gene is involved in tumorigenesis, mice were administered indomethacin in drinking water (14 μg/ml) for the duration of the experiment. Because mice drink approximately 3–4 ml of water per day, this translates to a dose of 1–1.4 mg/kg/day, which is effective in blocking prostanoid synthesis under clinical situations (33Silver R.M. Edwin S.S. Trautman M.S. Simmons D.L. Branch D.W. Dudley D.J. Mitchell M.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 725-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 b, indomethacin treatment did not inhibit Cox-1-induced tumorigenesis. These data suggest that the ability of Cox-1 to induce tumorigenesis is independent of prostanoid biosynthesis. The morphology of the tumor as well as expression of the transfected Cox-1 polypeptide was analyzed by histopathological procedures. As shown in Fig. 4 a, the site of injection of ECV-neo cells (panels A and B) indicates the presence of a few ECV cells that are intermingled with monocytic cells and host-derived fibroblastic capsule engulfing the injected cells. Many of the ECV-neo cells appear necrotic, and mitotic bodies were not observed. In contrast, ECV-Cox-1 cells appear highly malignant (Fig. 4 a, panels C and D). The mass of the tumor is composed of ECV cells and vessel-like structures. The nuclear morphology of ECV cells appears highly abnormal, whereas the vessel-like structures contain flat nuclei and thus may be host-derived. Numerous mitotic and apoptotic bodies were observed in the ECV-Cox-1 tumors, suggesting a high turnover. In addition, various degrees of differentiation of ECV-Cox-1 cells were observed; some were highly mitotic and undifferentiated, whereas some appeared more differentiated with an adenomatous phenotype. The ECV-Cox-1 cells in the tumors still express the transfected Cox-1 gene, albeit in a heterogenous manner, as determined by immunohistochemical procedures (Fig. 4 a, panel D). Such a pattern of heterogenous yet exaggerated expression in tumor cells resembles the pattern of Cox-2 expression in human colorectal cancer (12Sano H. Kawahito Y. Wilder R.L. Hashiramoto A. Mukai S. Asai K. Kimura S. Kato H. Kondo M. Hla T. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3785-3789PubMed Google Scholar), a tumor of epithelial origin. The histology of the ECV-Cox-1 tumors with respect to the vasculature was characterized next. As shown in Fig. 4 b, tumors derived by ECV-Cox-1 cells are highly angiogenic, as evident from the redness of the tumor. The tumor is composed of inflammatory and angiogenic periphery and a solid mass of rapidly proliferating ECV-Cox-1 cells (Fig. 4 b). A necrotic center in the center of the tumor can be frequently seen (Fig. 4 b). The vessels in the tumor appear to be host-derived because their nuclear architecture is normal and flat, in contrast to the proliferative ECV-Cox-1 cells that possess abnormally shaped nuclei. The vessel-like structures, especially those at the periphery of the tumor are positive for von Willebrand factor expression, a marker for vascular endothelial cells. There are several phenotypes of blood vessels within the ECV-Cox-1 tumor. Several of the angiogenic vessels appear injured and are occluded with thrombi composed primarily of platelets (Fig. 4 b, panels D and F). The endothelial cells lining these vessels as well as the platelets stain for the von Willebrand factor antigen. Several parts of the tumor are composed of a solid mass of ECV-Cox-1 cells with an angiogenic periphery (Fig. 4 b, panel E). Some of the vessels appear to be abnormally shaped and are sinusoidal in nature (Fig. 4 b, panel F). These data suggest that ECV-Cox-1 cells induced enhanced angiogenesis of the host and thus allowed rapid proliferation of the tumor. In addition, secretion of high levels of vasoactive and thrombotic prostanoids may have induced thrombosis and vascular injury. It is not known if extracellular or intranuclear action of Cox-1 is responsible for the enhanced angiogenesis and tumorigenesis. Indeed, PGE2, which is produced by the Cox-1 pathway is a potent inducer of angiogenesis (23Ziche M. Jones J. Gullino P.M. J. Natl. Canc. Inst. 1982; 69: 475-482PubMed Google Scholar). PGE2 is known to up-regulate vascular endothelial growth factor expression and thereby regulate angiogenesis (22Ben-Av P. Crofford L.J. Wilder R.L. Hla T. FEBS Lett. 1995; 372: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Alternatively, exaggerated expression of Cox-1 may allow a nuclear signaling event to take place in ECV cells that would express angiogenic factors and/or down-regulate angiogenic suppressors (32Holmgren L. O'Reilly M.S. Folkman J. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 149-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (1691) Google Scholar). However, because indomethacin treatment did not reverse the enhanced apoptosis in vitro (Fig. 2 b and data not shown) and tumorigenesis in vivo (Fig. 3 b), the observations in this study may relate to the nonprostanoid-mediated function of Cox-1. Further studies are needed to address such mechanisms. In conclusion, we have shown that high level expression of Cox-1 in ECV cells, which normally do not express neither Cox-1 or -2 isoenzymes, results in nuclear and ER localization of functional Cox-1 polypeptide. Cox-1 overexpression induced tumorigenesis and exaggerated angiogenesisin vivo. Such mechanisms may be important in Cox-induced tumorigenesis in vivo. In addition, this system may be useful to further dissect the mechanisms involved. We thank Carolyn Hue for expert technical assistance and Tom Maciag for support and encouragement."
https://openalex.org/W2029820261,"By site-directed mutagenesis, three cysteine residues (amino acids 402, 403, and 405) in the carboxyl terminus of human endothelinB (ETB) were identified as potential palmitoylation sites. Substitutions of all of the three cysteine residues with serine gave an unpalmitoylated mutant, C2S/C3S/C5S. When expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, C2S/C3S/C5S was localized on the cell surface, retained high affinities to ET-1 and ET-3, and was rapidly internalized when bound to the ligand. However, unlike the wild-type ETB, C2S/C3S/C5S transmitted neither an inhibitory effect on adenylate cyclase nor a stimulatory effect on phospholipase C, indicating a critical role of palmitoylation in the coupling with G proteins, regardless of the G protein subtypes. Truncation of the carboxyl terminus including Cys403/Cys405 gave a deletion mutant Δ403 that was palmitoylated on Cys402 and lacked the carboxyl terminus downstream to the palmitoylation site. Δ403 did transmit a stimulatory effect on phospholipase C via a pertussis toxin-insensitive G protein but it failed to transmit an inhibitory effect on adenylate cyclase. These results indicated a differential requirement for the carboxyl terminus downstream to the palmitoylation site in the coupling with G protein subtypes, i.e. it is required for the coupling with Gi but not for that with Gq.

To date, however, there appears to be no common rule applicable to all GPCRs on any of the three aspects. On ligand binding, the elimination of palmitoylation caused no changes in the binding characteristics of all the GPCRs examined (4Kennedy M.E. Limbird L.E. J. Biol.

The unpalmitoylated β2AR lacked the GTP-sensitive high affinity state for agonists and this lack was ascribed to its uncoupling from Gs (3O'Dowd B.F. Hnatowich M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Bouvier M.

A differential requirement for the modification between G protein subtypes coupled to the same receptor has been highlighted in a study on human ETA (12Horstmeyer A. Cramer H. Sauer T.

On intracellular trafficking of the receptor molecule, reduced cell surface expression was reported for unpalmitoylated mutants of thyrotropin-releasing hormone, luteinizing hormone/human choriogonadotropin, and vasopressin V2 receptors (9Kawate N.

Pharmacol. 1991; 39: 192-198PubMed Google Scholar) or α2AR (19Eason M.G. Jacinto M.T. Theiss C.T. Liggett S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11178-11182Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) was not affected while that of luteinizing hormone/human choriogonadotropin receptors was enhanced by the elimination of palmitoylation (9Kawate N. Menon K.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30651-30658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because of these pleiotropic effects described, the functional role of palmitoylation in each GPCR is an open question.The endothelins (ETs) are a family of potent vasoactive peptides that includes ET-1, -2, and -3 (20Inoue A. Yanagisawa M. Kimura S. Kasuya Y. Miyauchi T. Goto K. Masaki T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2863-2867Crossref PubMed Scopus (2555) Google Scholar, 21Yanagisawa M. Kurihara H. Kimura S. Tomobe Y. Kobayashi M. Mitsui Y. Yazaki Y. Goto K. Masaki T. Nature. 1988; 332: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (10185) Google Scholar). They have a wide variety of biological effects in various tissues and cell types (22Masaki T. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 256-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) that are mediated by specific GPCR subtypes, ETA and ETB(23Arai H. Hori S. Aramori S. Ohkubo H. Nakanishi S. Nature. 1990; 348: 730-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (2505) Google Scholar, 24Sakurai T. Yanagisawa M. Takuwa H. Miyazaki H. Kimura S. Goto K. Masaki T. Nature. 1990; 348: 732-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (2356) Google Scholar). The two subtypes can be pharmacologically distinguished by different rank orders of affinity toward the three ET isopeptides; ETA is ET-1-selective, showing an affinity rank order of ET-1 ≥ ET-2 ≫ ET-3, whereas ETB exhibits similar affinities to all of the three isopeptides (23Arai H. Hori S. Aramori S. Ohkubo H. Nakanishi S. Nature. 1990; 348: 730-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (2505) Google Scholar, 24Sakurai T. Yanagisawa M. Takuwa H. Miyazaki H. Kimura S. Goto K. Masaki T. Nature. 1990; 348: 732-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (2356) Google Scholar). Both of them belong to a subfamily of GPCRs with a promiscuous nature that can activate multiple subtypes of G proteins and they can also be distinguished by selective coupling with G protein subtypes; when expressed in CHO cells, ETA couples with members of Gq and Gs families while ETBcouples with those of Gq and Gi families (25Aramori I. Nakanishi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12468-12474Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,26Takagi Y. Ninomiya H. Sakamoto A. Miwa S. Masaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10072-10078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).The purposes of the current study were to identify potential palmitoylation sites of ETB and to reveal a role of the modification in ETB functions including ligand binding, cell surface expression, internalization, and G protein activation. An additional objective was to reveal a functional role of the carboxyl-terminal tail downstream to the palmitoylation site in the receptor functions.DISCUSSIONWe have demonstrated that human ETB is covalently modified by thioesterification of palmitic acid and that the potential palmitoylation sites are the cysteine residues at amino acids 402, 403, and 405. The results obtained in the present study, however, did not indicate which of the three potential sites were actually palmitoylated in wtETB but suggested that palmitoylation of the individual cysteines was not an independent event but both alternative and hierarchical modifications of the three residues were taking place. Mutation of individual cysteines did not affect the level of [3H]palmitic acid incorporation but that of two caused a significant reduction (Fig. 2 b), suggesting that, in the wild-type receptor, not all of the three but two of them are palmitoylated and that, in the single-substitution mutants (C2S, C3S, and C5S), the remaining two cysteines were alternatively palmitoylated. The reduction of [3H]palmitic acid incorporation in the double mutant C2S/C3S was more than 80% on densitometry suggesting the presence of a hierarchical order between Cys402/Cys403 and Cys405,i.e. palmitoylation of either Cys402 or Cys403 may be a prerequisite for the efficient palmitoylation of Cys405. Hierarchical modification of two potential palmitoylation sites has been demonstrated so far only for rhodopsin (5Karnik S.S. Ridge K.D. Bhattacharya S. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Identification of the actual palmitoylation sites inwtETB as well as verification of the alternative/hierarchical palmitoylation must await further studies that employ chemical or enzymatic methods to detect the modification of individual cysteines.Also left unaddressed in the present study was the possible regulation of the palmitoylation level by receptor activation as has been described for β2AR (31Mouillac B. Caron M. Bonin H. Dennis M. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21733-21737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or D1 dopaminergic receptor (7Ng G.Y.K. Mouillac B. George S.R. Caron M. Dennis M. Bouvier M. O'Dowd B.F. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 267: 7-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Because the expressed receptors were recovered after [3H]palmitic acid labeling and washing the cells, we could at least conclude that wtETB as well as the various mutants were constitutively palmitoylated, without agonist-stimulation. However, because of the use of biotin-labeled agonist in the purification step, we did not assess the effect of receptor activation on the palmitoylation level. Alternative purification procedures including epitope-tagged receptors or specific antibodies are required to pursuit the issue.[125I]ET-1 binding assays on the wild-type and various mutant receptors gave Kd andBmax values within similar ranges regardless of the presence or absence of palmitoylation, suggesting that the overall integrity of the ligand-binding surface did not depend on the modification. These results are in line with the data obtained in many GPCRs (4Kennedy M.E. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8003-8011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Kawate N. Menon K.M.J. J.

J. 1996; 313: 611-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) except for β2AR. In the case of β2AR, the lack of palmitoylation eliminated the GTP-sensitive high affinity state of the receptor, secondary to its uncoupling from Gs (3O'Dowd B.F. Hnatowich M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7564-7569Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Moffett S. Mouillac B. Bonin H. Bouvier M. EMBO J. 1993; 2: 349-356Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar). There was indeed a ∼4-fold difference in the Kd values of [125I]ET-1 binding to various mutant receptors used in the present study (Table I). It is, however, unlikely that the apparent difference in the affinities was due to the presence or absence of a GTP-sensitive high affinity state of the receptor, because GTPγS failed to affect the [125I]ET-1 binding towtETB as well as the various mutant receptors (data not shown). The absence of a GTP-sensitive high affinity state ofwtETB may imply that the receptor does not couple to G proteins prior to agonist binding as has been suggested for ETA (32Rose P.M. Krystek Jr., S.R. Patel P.S. Liu E.C. Lynch J.S. Lach D.A. Fisher S.M. Webb M.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 361: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In the present study, a precise reason for the apparent difference in the binding affinities between the various mutants was left unknown. It is, however, at least clear that the differences in the G protein coupling capacities of the various mutants cannot be ascribed to the differences in the ligand binding affinities, because of the all or none feature of the coupling (discussed below).In situ binding assays with Cy5-ET-1 (Fig. 4) indicated that palmitoylation was not required for the overall sequestration (cell surface expression and internalization) ofwtETB. The binding assay used, however, is not quantitative and the intracellular traffic of the receptor molecule from the site of synthesis (endoplasmic reticulum) to the plasma membrane could not be assessed with this assay. Therefore, it is still an open question whether the intracellular traffic ofwtETB is actively regulated by palmitoylation of the receptor molecule.The most distinct finding of the present study was the failure of unpalmitoylated mutant receptors to activate the G protein-dependent signaling pathways. The unpalmitoylated mutant C2S/C3S/C5S totally failed to transmit an inhibitory effect on adenylate cyclase (Fig. 5) and a stimulatory effect on PLC (Figs. 6 and7) while C2S/C3S retained the signaling activities comparable with those of wtETB. These results indicated that either the presence of Cys405 per se or the palmitoylation of the same residue in C2S/C3S was required for the G protein coupling. Because the specific requirement for the presence of Cys405 can be excluded by the unaltered signaling activities of the mutant C5S, the signaling activities of C2S/C3S must be ascribed to the palmitoylation of Cys405. The unaltered signaling activities of C5S can in turn be ascribed to the palmitoylation of Cys402 and Cys403. Therefore, we conclude that palmitoylation of at least one of the three potential sites is required for the G protein coupling, regardless of the G protein subtypes.The activation of signaling pathways to adenylate cyclase and PLC by various receptors was an all or none phenomenon and the quantitative relationship between the palmitoylation level and the signaling effects was not detected in the present study. Both the inhibition of cAMP formation and the stimulation of [3H]IPs accumulations caused by C2S/C3S were comparable with those bywtETB (and other single-substitution mutants) (Figs. 5 and 6) despite the apparently reduced palmitoylation level of C2S/C3S (Fig. 2 b). A precise mechanism for C2S/C3S to cause the maximum effects is left unknown, however, possible explanations include the intracellular amplification of the signal by sequential interactions of receptor-G protein-effector molecules.In addition to the critical role of palmitoylation in the G protein coupling, the present study also revealed a differential requirement for the carboxyl-terminal tail downstream to the palmitoylation site by G protein subtypes. The palmitoylated deletion mutant Δ403 failed to transmit an inhibitory effect on adenylate cyclase (Fig. 9) but did transmit a stimulatory effect on PLC (Figs. 10 and 11) indicating that the carboxyl-terminal tail downstream to the palmitoylation site was required for the coupling with Gi but not for that with Gq. To reveal a role of the carboxyl terminus in ETB signaling, Aquilla et al. (33Aquilla E. Whelchel A. Knot H.J. Nelson M. Posada J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31572-31579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) constructed a deletion mutant which terminates within the seventh transmembrane domain and showed a lack of a capacity of this mutant to activate various cellular kinases. The critical role of palmitoylation and that of the carboxyl-terminal tail in the G protein coupling described here are consistent with their findings.The requirement for palmitoylation in the G protein coupling has so far been documented for β2AR (16Moffett S. Mouillac B. Bonin H. Bouvier M. EMBO J. 1993; 2: 349-356Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and ETA (12Horstmeyer A. Cramer H. Sauer T. Müler-Esterl W. Schroeder C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20811-20819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In the case of β2AR, the decreased coupling of unpalmitoylated mutant receptors was linked to an increased phosphorylation of the carboxyl tail of the receptor and not to the formation of a fourth intracellular loop (ICLIV) (16Moffett S. Mouillac B. Bonin H. Bouvier M. EMBO J. 1993; 2: 349-356Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Indeed there are as many as 10 putative phosphorylation sites in the carboxyl-terminal tail of ETB (34Sakamoto A. Yanagisawa M. Sakurai T. Takuwa Y. Yanagisawa H. Masaki T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 178: 656-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). However, both deletion mutants Δ402 and Δ403 lacked the potential phosphorylation sites in the carboxyl terminus and the difference of their abilities to activate Gq depended on the presence or absence of the potential palmitoylation site Cys402. Therefore, it is unlikely that the lack of a capacity of unpalmitoylated mutants was secondary to an altered phosphorylation state of the carboxyl terminus. Although the data presented does not exclude the possible regulation of G protein coupling by phosphorylation, it favors a structural requirement for the formation of ICLIV in the G protein coupling of ETB.Comparison of the data obtained here on ETB and that reported on ETA (12Horstmeyer A. Cramer H. Sauer T. Müler-Esterl W. Schroeder C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20811-20819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) revealed some features shared by these receptor subtypes. In both cases, the receptors appeared to be constitutively palmitoylated and palmitoylation was not essential for the ligand binding capacities. Another feature shared by ETA and ETB is the absolute requirement for palmitoylation in the coupling with G proteins of the Gqfamily. This is, at present, a feature unique to these receptor subtypes; whether it is shared by any other GPCRs coupled with Gq is a subject for the future study. A distinct difference between ETA and ETB lies in the structural basis for the coupling of ETA with Gs and that for the coupling of ETB with Gi. Palmitoylation was required for ETB-Gi interaction but not for ETA-Gs interaction. Using chimeric receptors between ETA and ETB, we have shown that ICLII of ETA and ICLIII of ETB are the major determinants for the selective coupling of each receptor subtype with Gs and Gi, respectively (26Takagi Y. Ninomiya H. Sakamoto A. Miwa S. Masaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10072-10078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The requirement for palmitoylation in ETB-Gi interaction suggested an involvement of ICLVI either in selection or activation of Gi. Also suggested from the data obtained from deletion mutants was an involvement of the cytoplasmic free tail. Thus, in the case of ETB-Gi interaction, all of the three intracellular domains of the receptor, ICLIII, VI, and the cytoplasmic free tail appear to be involved.Recently, a splice variant of human ETB was identified by molecular cloning (35Elshourbagy N.A. Adamou J.E. Gagnon A.W. Wu H.-L. Pullen M. Nambi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25300-25307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It is formed by a substitution of a large part of the carboxyl-terminal tail and the newly identified carboxyl-terminal sequence lacks any potential palmitoylation sites. When expressed in cultured cells, the splice variant retained ligand binding capacities but apparently lacked a capacity to activate G proteins, giving rise to a hypothesis that it may represent the “spare” ETB, the presence of which has been predicted by some functional studies (36Fukuroda T. Fujikawa T. Ozaki S. Ishikawa K. Nishikibe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 1461-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar, 37Ozaki S. Ohwaki K. Ihara M. Fukuroda T. Ishikawa K. Yano M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 483-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). An obvious explanation for the failure of this splice variant to activate G proteins is a lack of palmitoylation. If this is the case, it raises a possibility of a novel mechanism to adjust cells' responses by alternative expression of palmitoylation-positive and -negative GPCR variants.In conclusion, we have identified the potential palmitoylation sites of human ETB and revealed a critical role of the modification in the coupling with G proteins. The relevance of these findings to the functional defects of ETB variant will be clarified in the future study.

A proposed mechanism for the PI 3-kinase-dependent activation of PKB involves translocation of PKB from the cytosol to membranes and subsequent phosphorylation by one or several membrane-associated kinase(s) (7Andjelkovic M.

Therefore, we have performed such studies in the isolated rat adipocyte. Major findings reported in this paper are that PKB in the intact adipocyte is rapidly and reversibly activated in response to physiological concentrations of insulin and upon stimulation with the insulin-mimicking agent peroxovanadate is translocated to membranes via a wortmannin-sensitive mechanism.DISCUSSIONThe major findings in this paper are that PKB is rapidly and reversibly activated via a wortmannin-sensitive mechanism by physiological concentrations of insulin in adipocytes, a major target cell for insulin, and that PKB is recruited to membranes via a wortmannin-sensitive mechanism in the intact cell.Kohn et al. (4Kohn A.D. Kovacina K.S. Roth R.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4288-4295Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) observed that stimulation of adipocytes with insulin resulted in decreased electrophoretic mobility of PKB on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Here we show that the decreased electrophoretic mobility of PKB is linked to activation of the kinase and that the activation is wortmannin-sensitive and also appears to involve phosphorylation. Furthermore, the activation is rapid (detectable within 1 min), reversible, and occurs in response to physiological concentrations of insulin (detectable with 100 pm). Therefore, the insulin-induced activation of PKB could well be important in metabolic actions of insulin. Insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1-mediated activation of PKB have been demonstrated using different cell lines and transfected cells, sometimes in the presence of as much as 100–1000 nminsulin (4Kohn A.D.

At high concentration of insulin it cannot be excluded that the effects observed are mediated via the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor and not by the insulin receptor (34Moses A.C. Tzusaki S. LeRoith D. Insulin-like Growth Factor: Molecular and Cellular Aspects. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 245-270Google Scholar). Our results show that in primary rat adipocytes there is a physiological regulation of PKB by insulin.The K9 peptide (KKRNRTLTK) was originally designed as a substrate for p70 S6 kinase (35Leighton I.A. Dalby K.N. Caudwell F.B. Cohen P.T.W. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Our results show that K9 can be used to detect PKB activity selectively in cytosol fractions from stimulated adipocytes. The peptide Crosstide (GRPRTSSFAEG), which closely resembles the sequence containing the site phosphorylated by PKB in glycogen synthase kinase-3, has been used to determine PKB activity in immunoprecipitates as well as in partially purified fractions of PKB (6Cross D.A.E. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4324) Google Scholar). Both Crosstide and K9 have basic residues at positions n-3 andn-5 (where n is the site of phosphorylation). In the case of Crosstide the phosphate acceptor is a serine, and in K9 it is a threonine. In a set of experiments (results not shown) we compared kinase activity in adipocytes using three different peptide substrates; Crosstide, K9, and a K9 peptide with the most carboxyl-terminal threonine replaced by a serine (K9Thr → Ser). In contrast to the results in Fig. 2 B with K9 as substrate, Crosstide as well as K9Thr → Ser detected PMA-stimulated kinase activity in the cytosol fraction to the same extent as insulin-stimulated kinase activity. Because PMA stimulation does not result in activation of PKB in adipocytes (Fig. 2) or other cells (3Franke T.F. Yang S.-I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Tsichlis P.N.

Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1871) Google Scholar) this indicates that kinase assay of crude adipocyte preparations with peptides containing a serine as phosphate acceptor (Crosstide and K9Thr → Ser) are less selective for PKB and will also detect other kinases such as p90 rsk. This conclusion is supported by a recent study where the substrate specificity of PKB, p90 rsk, and p70 S6 kinase were compared (36Alessi D.R. Caudwell F.B. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar).The importance of phosphorylation as a mechanism to activate PKB was demonstrated recently by Alessi et al. (32Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2495) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis studies of PKB revealed two activity-controlling phosphorylation sites. However, the protein kinase(s) and phosphatase(s) responsible for the phosphorylation of PKB in vivo have not yet been identified. In agreement with findings by others (4Kohn A.D. Kovacina K.S. Roth R.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4288-4295Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 5Burgering B.M.T. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1871) Google Scholar, 6Cross D.A.E. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4324) Google Scholar), alkaline phosphatase treatment of PKB from insulin-stimulated adipocytes resulted in its deactivation as well as reversal of its electrophoretic mobility to that of PKB from control cells. A role for protein phosphatases in the regulation of PKB in intact cells is supported by the observation that treatment of Swiss 3T3 cells with okadaic acid induces activation and reduction in the electrophoretic mobility of PKB (7Andjelkovic M. Jakubowicz T. Cron P. Ming X.-F. Han J.-W. Hemmings B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5699-5704Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrated that the insulin-induced activation of PKB, as well as the corresponding decrease in electrophoretic mobility, was reversed upon removal of insulin or addition of wortmannin subsequent to insulin stimulation, indicating that the activation of PKB is reversed rapidly by protein phosphatase(s) in the intact cell.The finding that wortmannin blocked the peroxovanadate-induced translocation of PKB to membranes in intact cells is of considerable interest since it has been proposed that PKB can be targeted to membranes where it can be phosphorylated and activated by membrane-associated kinase(s) (7Andjelkovic M.

However, membrane translocation of PKB has not been demonstrated in intact cells but is supported by observations that PKB binds to lipid vesicles containing phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (17Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Toker A. Science. 1997; 275: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1293) Google Scholar, 18James S.R. Downes C.P. Gigg R. Grove S.J.A. Holmes A.B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 709-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) and that targeting of PKB to membranes by adding the src myristoylation sequence results in constitutive activation of PKB (5Burgering B.M.T. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1871) Google Scholar, 8Datta K. Bellacosa A. Chan T.O. Tsichlis P.N. J. Biol.

In contrast to the results with peroxovanadate, we were unable to find significant amounts of PKB in membrane fractions from insulin-stimulated cells. We have not identified the factor responsible for the marked difference in translocation of PKB to membranes during stimulation of adipocytes with insulin or peroxovanadate. It is possible that higher concentrations of 3-phosphorylated phosphoinositides are generated in the presence of peroxovanadate, since severalfold greater amounts of PI 3-kinase were found in association with insulin receptor substrate-13after stimulation of adipocytes with peroxovanadate than after treatment with insulin. The amount of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate could also have been increased by inhibition of its degradation. Since vanadate has been shown to inhibit phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate 5′-phosphatase in vitro (37Woscholski R. Waterfield M.D. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31001-31007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), it is tempting to speculate that peroxovanadate could inhibit this phosphatase in the intact cell and thereby increase the level of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate.Little is known regarding the physiologically important downstream targets for PKB. Recently, it was demonstrated that the insulin-induced phosphorylation and inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3 in myotubes are mediated by PKB, indicating an important role for PKB in the regulation of glycogen synthesis (6Cross D.A.E. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4324) Google Scholar). In 3T3-L1 adipocytes the expression of constitutively active PKB resulted in increased glucose uptake, which was associated with increased translocation of GLUT4 to plasma membranes and increased expression of GLUT1 (31Kohn A.D. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31372-31378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). In these cells, increased glucose uptake in the presence of constitutively active PKB was associated with increased lipid synthesis. Another important effect of insulin is to counteract catecholamine-induced hydrolysis of stored adipose tissue triglycerides. A key enzyme in this action of insulin is phosphodiesterase 3B whose activation causes reduction of cellular cAMP (38Degerman E. Leroy M.J. Taira M. Belfrage P. Manganiello V. LeRoith D. Taylor S.I. Olefsky J.M. Diabetes Mellitus. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 197-204Google Scholar). We are currently investigating the role of PKB in the insulin-induced phosphorylation and activation of phosphodiesterase 3B. Preliminary results indicate that phosphodiesterase 3B could be a substrate for PKBin vitro. 4T. Rahn and J. Wijkander, unpublished data., 5During the review of our manuscript, Mouleet al.

Fesik S.W. Nature. 1994; 371: 168-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). A proposed mechanism for the PI 3-kinase-dependent activation of PKB involves translocation of PKB from the cytosol to membranes and subsequent phosphorylation by one or several membrane-associated kinase(s) (7Andjelkovic M.

J. 1996; 315: 709-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), most likely through its PH domain, suggesting that in vivo the formation of such lipids by activated PI 3-kinase could have a role in the translocation of PKB. It is a matter of controversy whether the 3-phosphorylated phosphoinositides not only bind but also to some extent activate PKB (3Franke T.F. Yang S.-I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K.

Because almost all of the studies concerning the proposed mechanism(s) for insulin regulation of PKB have been carried out using cell lines or transfected cells and some of the findings are conflicting, there is obviously need for such information also from insulin-responsive target tissues such as liver, muscle, or adipose tissue. Therefore, we have performed such studies in the isolated rat adipocyte. Major findings reported in this paper are that PKB in the intact adipocyte is rapidly and reversibly activated in response to physiological concentrations of insulin and upon stimulation with the insulin-mimicking agent peroxovanadate is translocated to membranes via a wortmannin-sensitive mechanism. DISCUSSIONThe major findings in this paper are that PKB is rapidly and reversibly activated via a wortmannin-sensitive mechanism by physiological concentrations of insulin in adipocytes, a major target cell for insulin, and that PKB is recruited to membranes via a wortmannin-sensitive mechanism in the intact cell.Kohn et al. (4Kohn A.D. Kovacina K.S. Roth R.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4288-4295Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) observed that stimulation of adipocytes with insulin resulted in decreased electrophoretic mobility of PKB on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Here we show that the decreased electrophoretic mobility of PKB is linked to activation of the kinase and that the activation is wortmannin-sensitive and also appears to involve phosphorylation. Furthermore, the activation is rapid (detectable within 1 min), reversible, and occurs in response to physiological concentrations of insulin (detectable with 100 pm). Therefore, the insulin-induced activation of PKB could well be important in metabolic actions of insulin. Insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1-mediated activation of PKB have been demonstrated using different cell lines and transfected cells, sometimes in the presence of as much as 100–1000 nminsulin (4Kohn A.D.

At high concentration of insulin it cannot be excluded that the effects observed are mediated via the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor and not by the insulin receptor (34Moses A.C. Tzusaki S. LeRoith D. Insulin-like Growth Factor: Molecular and Cellular Aspects. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 245-270Google Scholar). Our results show that in primary rat adipocytes there is a physiological regulation of PKB by insulin.The K9 peptide (KKRNRTLTK) was originally designed as a substrate for p70 S6 kinase (35Leighton I.A. Dalby K.N. Caudwell F.B. Cohen P.T.W. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Our results show that K9 can be used to detect PKB activity selectively in cytosol fractions from stimulated adipocytes. The peptide Crosstide (GRPRTSSFAEG), which closely resembles the sequence containing the site phosphorylated by PKB in glycogen synthase kinase-3, has been used to determine PKB activity in immunoprecipitates as well as in partially purified fractions of PKB (6Cross D.A.E. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4324) Google Scholar). Both Crosstide and K9 have basic residues at positions n-3 andn-5 (where n is the site of phosphorylation). In the case of Crosstide the phosphate acceptor is a serine, and in K9 it is a threonine. In a set of experiments (results not shown) we compared kinase activity in adipocytes using three different peptide substrates; Crosstide, K9, and a K9 peptide with the most carboxyl-terminal threonine replaced by a serine (K9Thr → Ser). In contrast to the results in Fig. 2 B with K9 as substrate, Crosstide as well as K9Thr → Ser detected PMA-stimulated kinase activity in the cytosol fraction to the same extent as insulin-stimulated kinase activity. Because PMA stimulation does not result in activation of PKB in adipocytes (Fig. 2) or other cells (3Franke T.F. Yang S.-I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Tsichlis P.N.

This conclusion is supported by a recent study where the substrate specificity of PKB, p90 rsk, and p70 S6 kinase were compared (36Alessi D.R. Caudwell F.B. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar).The importance of phosphorylation as a mechanism to activate PKB was demonstrated recently by Alessi et al. (32Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2495) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis studies of PKB revealed two activity-controlling phosphorylation sites. However, the protein kinase(s) and phosphatase(s) responsible for the phosphorylation of PKB in vivo have not yet been identified. In agreement with findings by others (4Kohn A.D. Kovacina K.S. Roth R.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4288-4295Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 5Burgering B.M.T. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1871) Google Scholar, 6Cross D.A.E. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4324) Google Scholar), alkaline phosphatase treatment of PKB from insulin-stimulated adipocytes resulted in its deactivation as well as reversal of its electrophoretic mobility to that of PKB from control cells. A role for protein phosphatases in the regulation of PKB in intact cells is supported by the observation that treatment of Swiss 3T3 cells with okadaic acid induces activation and reduction in the electrophoretic mobility of PKB (7Andjelkovic M. Jakubowicz T. Cron P. Ming X.-F. Han J.-W. Hemmings B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5699-5704Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrated that the insulin-induced activation of PKB, as well as the corresponding decrease in electrophoretic mobility, was reversed upon removal of insulin or addition of wortmannin subsequent to insulin stimulation, indicating that the activation of PKB is reversed rapidly by protein phosphatase(s) in the intact cell.The finding that wortmannin blocked the peroxovanadate-induced translocation of PKB to membranes in intact cells is of considerable interest since it has been proposed that PKB can be targeted to membranes where it can be phosphorylated and activated by membrane-associated kinase(s) (7Andjelkovic M.

However, membrane translocation of PKB has not been demonstrated in intact cells but is supported by observations that PKB binds to lipid vesicles containing phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (17Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Toker A. Science. 1997; 275: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1293) Google Scholar, 18James S.R. Downes C.P. Gigg R. Grove S.J.A. Holmes A.B. Alessi D.R. Biochem.

In contrast to the results with peroxovanadate, we were unable to find significant amounts of PKB in membrane fractions from insulin-stimulated cells. We have not identified the factor responsible for the marked difference in translocation of PKB to membranes during stimulation of adipocytes with insulin or peroxovanadate. It is possible that higher concentrations of 3-phosphorylated phosphoinositides are generated in the presence of peroxovanadate, since severalfold greater amounts of PI 3-kinase were found in association with insulin receptor substrate-13after stimulation of adipocytes with peroxovanadate than after treatment with insulin. The amount of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate could also have been increased by inhibition of its degradation. Since vanadate has been shown to inhibit phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate 5′-phosphatase in vitro (37Woscholski R. Waterfield M.D. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31001-31007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), it is tempting to speculate that peroxovanadate could inhibit this phosphatase in the intact cell and thereby increase the level of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate.Little is known regarding the physiologically important downstream targets for PKB. Recently, it was demonstrated that the insulin-induced phosphorylation and inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3 in myotubes are mediated by PKB, indicating an important role for PKB in the regulation of glycogen synthesis (6Cross D.A.E. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4324) Google Scholar). In 3T3-L1 adipocytes the expression of constitutively active PKB resulted in increased glucose uptake, which was associated with increased translocation of GLUT4 to plasma membranes and increased expression of GLUT1 (31Kohn A.D. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31372-31378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). In these cells, increased glucose uptake in the presence of constitutively active PKB was associated with increased lipid synthesis. Another important effect of insulin is to counteract catecholamine-induced hydrolysis of stored adipose tissue triglycerides. A key enzyme in this action of insulin is phosphodiesterase 3B whose activation causes reduction of cellular cAMP (38Degerman E. Leroy M.J. Taira M. Belfrage P. Manganiello V. LeRoith D. Taylor S.I. Olefsky J.M. Diabetes Mellitus. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 197-204Google Scholar). We are currently investigating the role of PKB in the insulin-induced phosphorylation and activation of phosphodiesterase 3B. Preliminary results indicate that phosphodiesterase 3B could be a substrate for PKBin vitro. 4T. Rahn and J. Wijkander, unpublished data., 5During the review of our manuscript, Mouleet al.

In 3T3-L1 adipocytes the expression of constitutively active PKB resulted in increased glucose uptake, which was associated with increased translocation of GLUT4 to plasma membranes and increased expression of GLUT1 (31Kohn A.D. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31372-31378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). In these cells, increased glucose uptake in the presence of constitutively active PKB was associated with increased lipid synthesis. Another important effect of insulin is to counteract catecholamine-induced hydrolysis of stored adipose tissue triglycerides. A key enzyme in this action of insulin is phosphodiesterase 3B whose activation causes reduction of cellular cAMP (38Degerman E. Leroy M.J. Taira M. Belfrage P. Manganiello V. LeRoith D. Taylor S.I. Olefsky J.M. Diabetes Mellitus. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 197-204Google Scholar). We are currently investigating the role of PKB in the insulin-induced phosphorylation and activation of phosphodiesterase 3B. Preliminary results indicate that phosphodiesterase 3B could be a substrate for PKBin vitro. 4T. Rahn and J. Wijkander, unpublished data., 5During the review of our manuscript, Mouleet al.

All donor compounds conferred an inhibitory effect upon the oxidation of LDL; however, the effect exhibited a biphasic dependence upon the rate of ⋅NO release. The ⋅NO release rate that maximally inhibited oxidation was dependent upon the rate of oxidation. When LDL was rapidly oxidized by copper(II) sulfate, a faster release rate was more effective. In contrast, when LDL was oxidized slowly by 2,2′-azobis-2-amidinopropane hydrochloride, a slower release rate was most effective. This biphasic relationship between ⋅NO release rate and the duration of inhibition was also demonstrated when LDL oxidation was initiated with 5-amino-3-(4-morpholinyl)-1,2,3-oxadiazolium, a peroxynitrite generator. We conclude that the antioxidant ability of ⋅NO is dependent not only upon the rate of its release from ⋅NO donors, but also upon the rate of oxidation. This conclusion is supported by a kinetic model of LDL oxidation in the presence of ⋅NO. 1-Substituted diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolates, a class of nitric oxide (⋅NO) donor compounds that spontaneously release⋅NO at different rates, were used to investigate the effect of⋅NO release rate upon the oxidation of low density lipoprotein (LDL).

We conclude that an optimal rate of ⋅NO release is required for maximal suppression of LDL oxidation, and that this optimal rate depends upon the rate and the mechanism of LDL oxidation. This conclusion is supported by a kinetic model of LDL oxidation in the presence of ⋅NO.CONCLUSIONSThis investigation has shown that the release of ⋅NO from all NONOate compounds conferred an inhibitory effect upon the oxidation of LDL. The extent of the antioxidant effect, however, exhibited a biphasic dependence upon the rate of ⋅NO release.

This indicates that there is an optimal rate of ⋅NO production for maximal suppression of LDL oxidation, and that this optimal rate is dependent upon the rate of oxidation. We conclude that the antioxidant capability of ⋅NO is critically dependent not only on the rate of its release from⋅NO donors, but also upon the relative rate of lipid oxidation. The slow generation of ⋅NO by the vascular endothelium may represent a continuous source of antioxidant, playing an integral role in suppressing oxidative reactions within the vasculature.

https://openalex.org/W1988578458,"Site-directed mutants of prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase-2 (PGHS-2) with changes in the peroxidase active site were prepared by mutagenesis, expressed in Sf-9 cells, and purified to homogeneity. The distal histidine, His193, was mutated to alanine and the distal glutamine, Gln189, was changed to asparagine, valine, and arginine. The guaiacol peroxidase activities of H193A, Q189V, and Q189R were drastically reduced to levels observed in the absence of protein; only Q189N retained wild-type PGHS-2 (wtPGHS-2) activity. The mechanism of hydroperoxide reduction by the PGHS-2 mutants was investigated using 15-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HPETE), a diagnostic probe of hydroperoxide reduction pathways. The hydroperoxide reduction activity of Q189V and Q189R was reduced to that of free Fe(III) protoporphyrin IX levels, whereas Q189N catalyzed more reduction events than wtPGHS-2. The percentage of two-electron reduction events was identical for wtPGHS-2 and Q189N. The number of hydroperoxide reductions catalyzed by H193A was reduced to ∼60% of wtPGHS-2 activity, but the majority of products were the one-electron reduction products, 15-KETE and epoxyalcohols. Thus, mutation of the distal histidine to alanine leads to a change in the mechanism of hydroperoxide reduction. Reaction of wtPGHS-2, Q189N, and H193A with varying concentrations of 15-HPETE revealed a change in product profile that suggests that 15-HPETE can compete with the reducing substrate for oxidation by the peroxidase higher oxidation state, compound I. The ability of the PGHS-2 proteins to catalyze two-electron hydroperoxide reduction correlated with the activation of cyclooxygenase activity. The reduced ability of H193A to catalyze two-electron hydroperoxide reduction resulted in a substantial lag phase in the cyclooxygenase assay. The addition of 2-methylimidazole chemically reconstituted the two-electron hydroperoxide reduction activity of H193A and abolished the cyclooxygenase lag phase. These observations are consistent with the involvement of the two-electron oxidized peroxidase intermediate, compound I, as the mediator of the activation of the cyclooxygenase of PGHS.

The addition of 2-methylimidazole chemically reconstituted the two-electron hydroperoxide reduction activity of H193A and abolished the cyclooxygenase lag phase. These observations are consistent with the involvement of the two-electron oxidized peroxidase intermediate, compound I, as the mediator of the activation of the cyclooxygenase of PGHS. Peroxidases are enzymes found in plants, fungi, bacteria, and animals that catalyze the reduction of hydroperoxides (1, 2Welinder K.G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1992; 2: 388-393Crossref Scopus (776) Google Scholar) (Reaction 1). They serve not only to reduce hydroperoxides but to generate oxidized intermediates with numerous cellular functions. For example, the higher oxidation state of myeloperoxidase oxidizes chloride ion to the bacteriostatic hypochlorous acid (3Klebanoff S.J. Everse J. Everse K.E. Grisham M.B. Peroxidases in Chemistry and Biology. 1. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 1-35Google Scholar), whereas the higher oxidation state of soybean peroxygenase epoxidizes unsaturated fatty acids to plant defense molecules (4Blee E. Schuber F.

Six of these peroxidases contain a histidine residue as the fifth ligand to the heme iron and a histidine on the distal side of the heme 4–5 Å above the iron. 2Chloroperoxidase contains a cysteine thiolate as the fifth ligand to the heme iron. An additional residue is present on the distal side of the heme that is believed to participate with the distal histidine in two-electron reduction of the hydroperoxide substrate (14Poulos T.J. Kraut J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 8199-8205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This residue is arginine for the plant, fungal, and yeast peroxidases and glutamine for the mammalian peroxidases (Fig. 1). Peroxidases reduce hydroperoxides by two electrons to generate the corresponding alcohol and a spectroscopically detectable higher oxidation state called compound I (Reaction 2) (15Chance B. J. Biol.

One-electron reduction of compound I by an electron donor leads to formation of compound II, a Fe(IV)=O species with the porphyrin fully covalent (Reaction 3). One-electron reduction of compound II regenerates the resting Fe(III) state of the enzyme (Reaction 4).Fe3+­PPIX+ROOH→O=Fe4+­PPIX·++ROHO=Fe4+­PPIX·++e−→O=Fe4+­PPIXO=Fe4+­PPIX+e−→Fe3+­PPIX+H2OREACTIONS2–4The peroxidase activity of PGHS is typical of heme-containing peroxidases, and spectroscopically distinct compound I and compound II intermediates have been detected (20Lambeir A.-M.

In addition to its peroxidase activity, PGHS functions as an oxygenase. The cyclooxygenase activity of PGHS catalyzes the oxygenation of arachidonic acid to form the hydroperoxy endoperoxide, PGG2, and the peroxidase activity reduces PGG2 to the hydroxy endoperoxide, PGH2 (24Ohki S. Ogino N. Yamamoto S. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 829-836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Nugteren D.H. Hazelhof E. Biochim. Biophys.

A. 1974; 71: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar). PGH2 is the precursor of all prostaglandins and thromboxanes. For PGHS, two-electron reduction of a hydroperoxide to form compound I, followed by intramolecular electron transfer, is required to generate an amino acid radical (presumably a tyrosine) that serves as the cyclooxygenase oxidant (27Karthein R. Dietz R. Nastainczyk W. Ruf H.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Thus, an oxidized intermediate of peroxidase catalysis is used to activate cyclooxygenase catalysis. Mutagenesis studies have been performed to probe the role of active site residues in peroxidase catalysis. For example, mutation of the distal histidine of cytochrome c peroxidase to leucine leads to a 105-fold decrease in the bimolecular rate constant for the reaction of cytochrome c peroxidase with hydrogen peroxide (28Erman J.E. Vitello L.B. Miller M.A. Shaw A. Brown K.A. Kraut J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9798-9806Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). However, mutation of the distal arginine of cytochromec peroxidase to leucine or lysine has only a minimal effect on the rate constant for H2O2 reduction (29Vitello L.B. Erman J.E. Miller M.A. Wang J. Kraut J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9807-9818Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Based on these results, Vitello et al. (29Vitello L.B. Erman J.E. Miller M.A. Wang J. Kraut J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9807-9818Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) concluded that replacement of the distal histidine of cytochrome cperoxidase with leucine affects the formation of compound I, whereas mutation of arginine affects the stability of compound I (29Vitello L.B. Erman J.E. Miller M.A. Wang J. Kraut J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9807-9818Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Expression of site-directed mutants of PGHS-1 in COS cells has shown that mutation of the proximal histidine His388 or the distal histidine, H207 to alanine or glutamine abolishes peroxidase and cyclooxygenase activity (30Shimokawa T. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6168-6173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Extensive investigation of the role of active site residues in PGHS catalysis has been hindered by the absence of a high level expression system. For example, expression of PGHS-1 in Sf-9 cells produces mainly inactive protein (31Shimokawa T. Smith W.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 183: 975-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Recently, several groups reported successful expression of milligram quantities of active PGHS-2 in Sf-9 cells using baculovirus vectors (32Gierse J.K. Hauser S.D. Creely D.P. Kobolt C. Rangwala S.H. Isakson P.C. Seibert K. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 33Cromlish W.A. Payette P. Culp S.A. Ouellet M. Percival M.D. Kennedy B.P. Arch. Biochem.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1209: 130-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Therefore, we constructed site-directed mutants of PGHS-2, designed to assess the role of the distal peroxidase residues in catalysis, and the mutated proteins were expressed in Sf-9 cells. In this manner, sufficient amounts of the purified mutants were available for characterization of their biochemical properties. The distal glutamine of PGHS-2, Gln189, was changed to asparagine, valine, and arginine. In addition, the distal histidine, His193 was mutated to alanine. The effects of these mutations on peroxidase activity, the mechanism of hydroperoxide reduction, and cyclooxygenase activity were assessed and are described here. Unlabeled arachidonic acid and linolenic acid were from Nu-Chek Prep, Inc. (Elysian, MN). [1-14C]Arachidonic acid (57 mCi/mmol) and [1-14C]linolenic acid (53 mCi/mmol) were from NEN Life Science Products. Soybean lipoxygenase (type I-B), hematin (Fe-PPIX), 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), epinephrine, butylated hydroxyanisole, and diethyldithiocarbamate were from Sigma. Guaiacol and 2-methylimidazole (2-MeIm) were from Aldrich. 5-phenyl-4-pentenyl-1-hydroperoxide (PPHP) was synthesized as described (35Weller P.E. Markey C.M. Marnett L.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 243: 633-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). 10-Hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid (10-OOH-18:2) was prepared as described (36Labeque R. Marnett L.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987; 109: 2828-2829Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 37Landino L.M. Marnett L.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2637-2643Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The coding region of human PGHS-2 was subcloned into the plasmid pALTER-1, and in vitro mutagenesis was performed using an Altered Sites® II kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI). The final mutagenesis reaction was transformed into competent BMH 71–18 mutS cells (Clonetech, Palo Alto, CA), and the cells were grown overnight in LB broth without ampicillin. Plasmid DNA was isolated and used to transform competent DH10B cells (Life Technologies, Inc.). Plasmid DNA from ampicillin-resistant colonies was screened for the desired mutation by sequencing. Human PGHS-2 inserts containing the desired mutation with no secondary misincorporations were isolated with Qiaex resin (Quiagen, Chatsworth, CA) and subcloned into the baculovirus transfer vector pVL 1393 (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) for expression in insect (Sf-9) cells. Sf-9 cells (from Spodoptera frugiperda) were grown in spinner flasks at 27 °C in a humidified incubator with 1 × tryptose phosphate broth containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Recombinant baculoviruses were isolated by transfecting 5 fg of plasmid DNA with 400 ng of linearized baculovirus DNA (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) using the calcium phosphate method (38Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. I. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 82-84Google Scholar). Using the linearized DNA, the transfection mix yields >99% recombinants. A stock of the recombinant baculoviruses was made from the transfection supernatant. Sf-9 cells were grown to 0.5 × 106 cells/ml (1-liter spinner flask) in serum-containing medium at 27 °C. The cells were infected with PGHS recombinant baculovirus innoculum at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1 and harvested after 4 days. wtPGHS-2 and the PGHS-2 mutants were purified as described previously by Gierseet al. (32Gierse J.K. Hauser S.D. Creely D.P. Kobolt C. Rangwala S.H. Isakson P.C. Seibert K. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Further purification of the mutant proteins was achieved by anion exchange chromatography on a Mono Q column (Pharmacia). PGHS-2 mutants were eluted from the Mono Q with a linear gradient from 0 to 500 mm NaCl in 25 mmTris-HCl, 0.1% CHAPS, pH 8.0. Protein purity was assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The PGHS-2 mutants were stored at −80 °C in 25 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% CHAPS, pH 8.0. The specific activity of wtPGHS-2 was 10–12 μmol of arachidonic acid min−1 mg−1. PGHS-1 was purified from ram seminal vesicles as described previously and stored at −80 °C (39Marnett L.J. Siedlik P.H. Ochs R.C. Pagels W.D. Das M. Honn K.V. Warnock R.H. Tainer B.E. Eling T.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1984; 26: 328-335PubMed Google Scholar). Apo-PGHS-1 was prepared as described and was 99–100% apoprotein as judged by cyclooxygenase activities in the presence and absence of Fe-PPIX (40Odenwaller R. Chen Y.-N.P. Marnett L.J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 187: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The specific activity of apo-PGHS-1 was 15–20 μmol of arachidonic acid min−1 mg−1. Cyclooxygenase activity was determined by measuring oxygen consumption at 37 °C with a Gilson model 5/6 oxygraph equipped with a Clark electrode and a thermostatted cuvette (1.3 ml) (Gilson Medical Electronics, Inc., Middleton, WI). Enzyme aliquots (150–200 nm) were added to 0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 500 μm phenol. Oxygen uptake was initiated by the addition of 100 μmarachidonic acid, and the initial reaction velocity was determined from the linear portion of the oxygen uptake curve. The cyclooxygenase activity of wtPGHS-2 and the PGHS-2 mutants was also assayed by thin layer chromatography. Standard reaction mixtures (200 μl) contained 22 nm PGHS-2, 500 μmepinephrine, 100 μm diethyldithiocarbamate, and 12 μm [1-14C]arachidonic acid in 0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Prior to the addition of [1-14C]arachidonic acid, PGHS-2 was reconstituted with 2 eq of Fe-PPIX for 2 min. Reactions were terminated after 10 min by solvent extraction with 200 μl of ethyl ether, methanol, 1m citric acid, pH 4.0 (30:4:1), containing 10 μg of butylated hydroxyanisole and 10 μg of unlabeled arachidonic acid. The organic layers were spotted onto silica gel plates, and the plates were developed with ethyl acetate/methylene chloride/glacial acetic acid (75:25:1) at 4 °C. Radiolabeled products were quantitated with a radioactivity scanner (Bioscan, Inc., Washington, D. C.). [1-14C]15-HPETE was prepared enzymatically from [1-14C]arachidonic acid (20 μmol, 20 μCi) in 40 ml of 0.1 m borate buffer, pH 9.0, using soybean lipoxygenase (0.6 mg). [1-14C]15-HPETE was purified by preparative HPLC on a Zorbax Rx-Sil column (5-μm silica, 9.4 × 250 mm). 15-HPETE was eluted isocratically from the preparative HPLC column in hexane/2-propanol/glacial acetic acid (984:15:1) at a flow rate of 2.0 ml/min. The eluent was monitored at 235 nm, and the 15-HPETE was collected manually. The solvent was evaporated, and the 15-HPETE was stored at −20 °C in methanol. [1-14C]13-OOH-18:3 was prepared enzymatically from [1-14C]linolenic acid using soybean lipoxygenase and purified by HPLC as described for 15-HPETE (41Wilcox A.L. Marnett L.J. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 413-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The concentrations of [1-14C]15-HPETE and [1-14C]13-OOH-18:3 were determined from the UV absorption at 235 nm using a molar absorptivity of 23,000 m−1 cm−1 (42Funk M.O. Isaacs R. Porter N.A. Lipids. 1976; 11: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The PGHS-2 mutants, wtPGHS-2, and apo-PGHS-1 were reconstituted with 0.5 eq of Fe-PPIX for 2 min in 500 μl of 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 500 μm guaiacol. The peroxidase reaction was initiated by the addition of radiolabeled hydroperoxide in methanol. Following incubation at room temperature for varying periods of time, the reaction was quenched with 1 N HCl, and the lipid products were extracted with 2 × 2 volumes of ether. When low concentrations of [1-14C]15-HPETE were used, 14 nmol of unlabeled 15-HPETE was added to the quenched reactions to reduce degradation during the extraction steps. The ether layers were dried with anhydrous MgSO4, and the solvent was evaporated under nitrogen. The dried lipid products were resuspended in hexane and subjected to HPLC analysis using a Zorbax Rx-Sil analytical column (5-μm silica, 4.6 × 250 mm). Products were eluted isocratically in hexane/2-propanol/glacial acetic acid (987:12:1) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The radiolabeled products were quantitated using a radioactivity flow detector (IN/US Systems, Inc., Tampa, FL). Peroxidase assays were performed using a Shimadzu UV160U spectrophotometer. PGHS protein (100 nm or 200 nm) was reconstituted with 1 eq of Fe-PPIX in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 500 μm guaiacol. The reaction was initiated with the addition of 100 μm PPHP or 100 μm 15-HPETE in methanol. The rate of guaiacol oxidation was monitored at 436 nm (ε436 = 6390 m−1cm−1) (43Putter J. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. Verlag Chemie, Weinheim1975: 685-690Google Scholar). To determine Km andV*max values for wtPGHS-2 and Q189N, ABTS was used as the reducing substrate. Peroxidase assays contained 100 nm PGHS protein, 100 nm Fe-PPIX, 500 μm ABTS, and varying concentrations of 15-HPETE in 0.1m Tris, pH 8.0. The molar absorptivity used to calculate mol ABTS oxidized was 34,700 m−1cm−1 at 420 nm (44Scott S.L. Chen W.-J. Bakac A. Espenson J.H. J. Phys. Chem. 1993; 97: 6710-6714Crossref Scopus (278) Google Scholar). PGHS-2 mutants with changes in the peroxidase active site were prepared by site-directed mutagenesis and expression in Sf-9 cells. The PGHS-2 proteins were detergent-extracted from the membrane fraction of insect cell lysates and partially purified by anion exchange chromatography. Several of the mutants, H193A, Q189V, and Q189R, were rechromatographed on a Mono Q column in the presence of 0.1% CHAPS. The PGHS-2 mutants eluted as a broad band between 200 and 250 mm NaCl. The level of purity of the PGHS-2 mutants was assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2). Purification to homogeneity was achieved for wtPGHS-2, Q189N, and H193A, whereas Q189R and Q189V were purified to ∼60% homogeneity. The effect of amino acid substitution on the guaiacol peroxidase activity of PGHS-2 was measured with PPHP or 15-HPETE as the hydroperoxide substrate. Anion exchange chromatography removes any protein-bound Fe-PPIX; therefore, the proteins were reconstituted with 1 eq of Fe-PPIX. Fe-PPIX in Me2SO was added to PGHS protein in Tris buffer containing guaiacol and allowed to reconstitute for 2 min prior to addition of the hydroperoxide substrate. Control assays were performed in the absence of PGHS protein to correct for the low peroxidase activity of free Fe-PPIX. The rates of guaiacol oxidation for wtPGHS-2 and the PGHS-2 mutants are reported in Table I. The guaiacol peroxidase activity with both hydroperoxide substrates of H193A was reduced drastically to approximately the level of activity observed in the absence of protein. Likewise, Q189V and Q189R had no guaiacol peroxidase activity above Fe-PPIX alone with either hydroperoxide substrate. Only Q189N displayed guaiacol peroxidase activity with both hydroperoxide substrates equivalent to that of wtPGHS-2.Table IGuaiacol peroxidase activity of PGHS-2 mutantsEnzymePPHP15-HPETEmol guaiacol/min/mol enzyme (×10 −6 )wtPGHS-22.7 ± 0.21.1 ± 0.1H193A0.01 ± 0.0010.02 ± 0.002Q189N2.6 ± 0.21.2 ± 0.03Q189R0.02 ± 0.0030.02 ± 0.002Q189V0.01 ± 0.0020.01 ± 0.001Fe-PPIX0.01 ± 0.0030.01 ± 0.001Assay mixtures contained 100 or 200 nm protein, 1 eq of Fe-PPIX, 500 μm guaiacol, and 100 μm PPHP or 15-HPETE in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The oxidation of guaiacol was measured at 436 nm for 1 min. The activity was determined from the linear portion of the curve. Open table in a new tab Assay mixtures contained 100 or 200 nm protein, 1 eq of Fe-PPIX, 500 μm guaiacol, and 100 μm PPHP or 15-HPETE in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The oxidation of guaiacol was measured at 436 nm for 1 min. The activity was determined from the linear portion of the curve. Peroxidase assays were also performed using ABTS, rather than guaiacol, as the reducing substrate. The ABTS cation radical absorbs strongly at 420 nm (ε420 = 34,700 m−1cm−1), which provides for greater sensitivity. PGHS undergoes rapid self-inactivation; therefore, the maximal number of ABTS oxidation events (mol of ABTS oxidized/mol of PGHS), rather than the rate of ABTS oxidation, was used to reflect total enzyme activity. In the ABTS peroxidase assay, H193A had detectable peroxidase activity above free Fe-PPIX levels. H193A (100 nm protein reconstituted with 50 nm Fe-PPIX) catalyzed 78 mol of ABTS oxidized/mol of Fe-PPIX versus 49 mol of ABTS oxidized/mol of Fe-PPIX for Fe-PPIX alone at 50 μm 15-HPETE. Q189N displayed guaiacol peroxidase activity equivalent to wtPGHS-2 when assayed with 100 μm PPHP or 100 μm15-HPETE (Table I). To further probe the peroxidase activity of Q189N and wtPGHS-2, these proteins were assayed over a range of 15-HPETE concentrations with 500 μm ABTS as reducing substrate. Fig. 3 plots mol of ABTS oxidized/mol of PGHS versus 15-HPETE concentration for wtPGHS-2 and Q189N. Q189N catalyzed 2-fold greater turnovers than wtPGHS-2 at 25 μm 15-HPETE; however, at 100 μm 15-HPETE, the number of turnovers was identical to wtPGHS-2. The peak in Q189N peroxidase activity at 25 μm 15-HPETE was also observed when guaiacol was used as the reducing substrate. From these data,Km and V*max values were calculated. V*max represents the maximal number of turnovers catalyzed by the peroxidase at saturating concentrations of peroxide. Previous studies have shown this to be an accurate reflection of Vmax (45Ple P.

TheKm and V*max values were 4.9 μm and 132 mol of ABTS oxidized/mol of PGHS for wtPGHS-2 and 10.9 μm and 215 mol of ABTS oxidized/mol of PGHS for Q189N. The above data reflect the effect of mutation on the entire peroxidase catalytic cyclei.e. reduction of the hydroperoxide and reduction of the porphyrin higher oxidation states by guaiacol. To further dissect the peroxidase catalytic cycle, the initial hydroperoxide reduction step was characterized. The protein component of peroxidases facilitates formation of the peroxidase higher oxidation states and defines the mechanism of hydroperoxide reduction by the heme prosthetic group. Whereas peroxidases catalyze exclusively two-electron reduction of a hydroperoxide, free Fe-PPIX catalyzes predominantly one-electron hydroperoxide reduction. Thus, mutations in the peroxidase active site could affect the mechanism of hydroperoxide reduction by PGHS. Our laboratory has developed several diagnostic molecules to probe the mechanism of hydroperoxide reduction by metal complexes. Following reaction of a diagnostic hydroperoxide with a metal complex or peroxidase, the products are separated by HPLC, characterized, and quantitated to determine the mechanism of hydroperoxide reduction. The mechanism of hydroperoxide reduction by the PGHS-2 mutants was investigated using [1-14C]15-HPETE. 15-HPETE is an analog of the PGHS substrate, PGG2, and can be readily synthesized from arachidonic acid using soybean lipoxygenase. The sole product of two-electron reduction of 15-HPETE is the corresponding alcohol, 15-HETE. Following one-electron reduction of 15-HPETE, the resulting alkoxyl radical can be further oxidized to 15-KETE, or it can cyclize to form an epoxyallylic radical that eventually forms epoxyhydroperoxides and epoxyalcohols (SchemeFS1). To determine the mechanism of hydroperoxide reduction, wtPGHS-1, wtPGHS-2, and the PGHS-2 mutants were incubated with [1-14C]15-HPETE and guaiacol or ABTS. Several measures were taken to normalize reaction conditions. The purified apoproteins were reconstituted with 0.5 e"
https://openalex.org/W2040946130,"We have isolated and characterized two genes coding for the glyoxalase II enzyme from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The coding region of the GLO2 gene corresponds to a protein with 274 amino acids and a molecular mass of 31,306 daltons. The open reading frame of the GLO4 gene could be translated into a protein with 285 amino acids and a molecular mass of 32,325 daltons. The amino acid sequences of the deduced proteins are 59.1% identical and show high similarities to the sequence of the human glyoxalase II. When grown on either glucose or glycerol as a carbon source, a glo2 glo4 double deletion strain contains no glyoxalase II activity at all and shows no obvious phenotype during vegetative growth. However, this strain showed a similar high sensitivity against exogenous methylglyoxal as compared with a glyoxalase I-deficient strain. Whereas the GLO2 gene is expressed on both glucose and glycerol, the GLO4 gene is only active on glycerol. The active Glo2p protein is localized in the cytoplasm and the active Glo4p in the mitochondrial matrix. Heterologous expression of the full-length GLO2 coding region in Escherichia coli resulted in an active protein. However, to get an active Glo4p protein in E. coli, the putative mitochondrial transit peptide at the N-terminal end had to be removed by shortening the 5′ end of the GLO4 open reading frame.

The glyoxalase system (for review see Ref. 1Thornalley P.J. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar) consists of two enzymes, glyoxalase I and glyoxalase II. Using glutathione as cofactor it converts 2-oxoaldehydes into the corresponding 2-hydroxy acids. The most important substrate seems to be methylglyoxal. In most organisms, this toxic compound is formed as a by-product of glycolysis from triose phosphates through the action of triose-phosphate isomerase (2Richard J.P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 549-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). But the main source for methylglyoxal in yeast and other microorganisms is dihydroxyacetone phosphate which is converted to methylglyoxal by the methylglyoxal synthase (3Cooper R.A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1984; 38: 49-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 4Murata K. Fukuda Y. Watanabe K. Saikusa T. Shimosaka M. Kimura A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 131: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). As shown in Reaction 1 (where MG, HTA, and GSH indicate methylglyoxal, hemithioacetal, and glutathione, respectively), the first step in the conversion of methylglyoxal intod-lactic acid through the glyoxalase system is the spontaneous formation of hemithioacetal from the reaction of methylglyoxal with reduced glutathione. Hemithioacetal is metabolized to S-d-lactoylglutathione (SLG) 1The abbreviations used are: SLG,S-d-lactoylglutathione; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s); ORF, open reading frame.1The abbreviations used are: SLG,S-d-lactoylglutathione; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s); ORF, open reading frame. by glyoxalase I. Glyoxalase II catalyzes the reaction of SLG to d-lactate and GSH.CH3*CH3[Glo1]CH3*[Glo2]CH3*‖*‖*‖**‖*CO+GSH→CO→HCOH+H2O→HCOH+GSH‖*‖*‖**‖*CHO*HCOH*CO**COOH***‖*‖*****SG*SG***(MG)(HTA)(SLG)(D­LACTATE)REACTION1The glyoxalase system is present in all organisms analyzed so far (5Jerzykowski T.

It is clear that the glyoxalase system can detoxify methylglyoxal and other 2-oxoaldehydes, but the exact biological role of the glyoxalase system is still unclear. It has been shown that there is some correlation of the activities of the two enzymes with proliferation and differentiation of eucaryotic cells. In several systems it has been shown that immature, proliferating cells and tissues have relatively high glyoxalase I activities and low glyoxalase II activities, whereas mature, differentiated cells have relatively low glyoxalase I activities and high glyoxalase II activities (reviewed in Refs. 1Thornalley P.J. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar, 8Inoue Y. Kimura A. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1995; 37: 177-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, and 9Deswal R. Chakravarty T.N. Sopory S.K. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 527-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was presumed that in growing cells, there should be an increase of the SLG level compared with resting cells. In accordance with this, inhibitors of glyoxalase I lead to a slowing down or even complete arrest of cell growth of plant or animal cells. However, up to now there is no evidence for a causal relationship between the glyoxalase system and cell proliferation. Recently, Inoue and Kimura (10Inoue Y. Kimura A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25958-25965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) characterized the glyoxalase I gene,GLO1, from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Besides an enhanced sensitivity against the presence of methylglyoxal in the growth medium, they could not detect any obvious phenotype of aglo1 null mutant. Genes encoding glyoxalase I enzymes were isolated and characterized previously also from other species (11Rhee H.-I. Murata K. Kimura A. Agric. Biol.

Biol. 1995; 29: 1223-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). However, the first glyoxalase II gene isolated recently (15Ridderström M. Saccucci F. Hellman U. Bergman T. Principato G. Mannervik B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 319-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) was the human glyoxalase II gene, HAGH1. It has been shown that glyoxalase II is present in the cytoplasm and the mitochondria of rat liver cells (16Talesa V. Uotila L. Koivusalo M. Principato G.B. Giovannini E. Rosi G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 955: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It is not clear if the two isoenzymes are encoded by different genes. Here we present the cloning and characterization of two genes fromS. cerevisiae which code for functional glyoxalase II enzymes. Originally, we identified one of the genes (referred herein asGLO4) as a multicopy suppressor gene for a mutant yeast strain which has a reduced efficiency of spore germination (17Wallner, J. (1991) Molekulargenetische Untersuchung der Hefesporengermination, Ph.D. thesis, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.Google Scholar). The suppressor gene showed a high homology to the human HAGH1gene. The deduced protein showed also 59% identity to another unidentified protein predicted from an ORF (GenBank/EMBL accession no.U51030) identified in the yeast genome project. Therefore, we cloned this gene (referred herein as GLO2) and verified that both gene products are in fact glyoxalase II enzymes. The genes were functionally expressed in Escherichia coli. Several yeast deletion strains were constructed which lacked either one or both of the glyoxalase II genes and/or the glyoxalase I gene. Using these deletion strains it was possible to determine that (i) none of the three glyoxalase genes is essential for normal vegetative growth on glucose or glycerol, but all three are essential to survive as high concentrations of methylglyoxal in the growth medium as the wild type strain, (ii) the two glyoxalase II genes are expressed differentially on media containing glucose or glycerol as carbon source, and (iii) the proteins are localized in different cellular compartments. Oligonucleotides were custom synthesized by MWG-Biotech. Restriction enzymes were bought from Amersham Corp. and MBI Fermentas. Taq DNA polymerase was obtained from Böhringer Mannheim.

The strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table I.E. coli cells were grown in Luria broth (LB) at 37 °C. Yeast cells were grown at 28 °C on YPD complex medium (2% glucose, 2% peptone, 1% yeast extract) or on synthetic minimal medium (0.17% yeast nitrogen base, 0.5% ammonium sulfate) containing the appropriate amino acids, adenine and either 2% glucose or 3% glycerol. For the growth experiments in the presence of methylglyoxal, cells were grown up to an optical density at 600 nm (A600) of 1 in synthetic minimal medium as above. 4 ml of fresh medium (in 15 ml tubes) containing various concentrations of methylglyoxal (0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 mm) were inoculated with these cells to an initialA600 between 0.05 and 0.08. TheA600 was measured every 5 h over a period of 25 h.Table IStrains and plasmids used in this studyGenotypeRef. or sourceYeast strains1-aThe haploid glyoxalase deletion strains are not shown.

Science. 1985; 230: 1350-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (6750) Google Scholar) using the Taq DNA polymerase. 100 ng of chromosomal yeast DNA or 2 ng of plasmid DNA was used in 100-μl reaction mixtures containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 0.2 mm dNTP, and 0.5 μm 5′ and 3′ primers. 3 units of Taq DNA polymerase were added. The mixture was overlaid with 50 μl of mineral oil. After an initial denaturation step at 95 °C for 5 min, 30 cycles of amplification of chromosomal DNA or 15 cycles of amplification of plasmid DNA followed. Each cycle consisted of 1 min of DNA denaturation at 94 °C, 1 min of primer annealing at 48–54 °C (depending on the primers used), and 1 to 2 min of DNA synthesis (depending on the length of the amplified DNA). DNA cloning and plasmid constructions were done as described by Sambrook et al.(19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA was sequenced manually by the chain termination method (20Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4767-4771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1687) Google Scholar). For the sequencing of the GLO2 gene and GLO4gene, vector primers, cloning primers (see below), and different sequencing primers (not shown) were used. The GLO2 gene was PCR-amplified by using the Glo2–5′Eco(5′-CCAGAATTCTCCGGACTAATGTCAAACGA-3′) and the Glo2–3′Bam (5′-CCAGGATCCATTGCTTTATTTCTAC-3′) primers, digested with EcoRI and HindIII, and cloned into the yeast vector YEp351 (21Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar). The GLO1 gene was PCR-amplified by using the Glo1–5′BglI (5′-CCGAGATCTAAAGCTTTTTCAATGGGGATC-3′) and the Glo1–3′Bgl (5′-TGTGAGATCTAAGCTTGAACGCAT-3′) primers. The product (∼2100 bp) was cleaved with BglII and cloned into the BamHI site of YEp351 vector. The GLO2 open reading frame was amplified by using the Glo2–5′Nde(5′-GGAATTCCATATGCAGGTTAAATCGATTAA-3′) and Glo2–3′Bam primers. The PCR product was digested withNdeI and SspI and cloned into the E. coli expression plasmid pMW172 (22Way M. Pope B. Gooch J. Hawkins M. Weeds A.G. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4103-4109Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) which was digested withNdeI and StuI before. The GLO4 ORF was PCR-amplified by using the Glo4–5′Nde(5′-CTGGCCCATATGAAGTTTTTACTGCAGCAA-3′) and the Glo4–3′Bam (5′-CCAGGATCCACATCCGTCGTC-3′) primers. The PCR product was digested with NdeI (partial digestion) and EcoRV and cloned into pMW172 which was digested with NdeI and StuI before. The pGlo4-Ec3 was constructed in the same way as pGlo4-Ec2, but instead of the Glo4-Nde primer the Glo4-Nde2 primer (5′-TAAGACATATGCATGTTAAGCCTATAA-3′) was used in the PCR. For the cloning of the glyoxalase II ORFs under the control of theGAL1 promoter (23Johnston M. Davis R.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1440-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar) the glyoxalase II ORFs were cut out from the E. coli expression plasmids pGlo2-Ec2 and pGlo4-Ec2 by the restriction enzyme XbaI, respectively. TheXbaI ends were partially filled in by Klenow polymerase. The fragment was cloned behind the GAL1 promoter of the yeast expression vector pYES2 which had been cut by HindIII, and the resulting ends were partially filled in with Klenow polymerase. From the resulting plasmids, pGlo2g1 and pGlo4g1, the URA3gene was cut out with StuI and replaced by theLEU2 gene which was cut out from plasmid YEp351 withHpaI and PvuII. The resulting plasmids are pGlo2g5 and pGlo4g5. Haploid strains with deletions of the glyoxalase genes were generated by the one-step gene replacement method (24Rothstein J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar). The deleted regions of the genes are shown in Fig. 5. For the construction of the GLO2 deletion cassette, the GLO2 ORF was cut out from plasmid pE351G2 with the restriction enzymes ClaI and SacI, blunt-ended by Klenow polymerase, and replaced by the URA3gene, resulting in plasmid pE351G2Δ. This plasmid was digested withBspEI and XhoI. The fragment containing theGLO2 deletion cassette was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and used for the transformation of yeast strain W303e. For the deletion of the GLO4 gene from strain W303, theGLO4 deletion cassette was constructed by cloning theGLO4 gene from plasmid pE13G4 into plasmid pUC18 using theKpnI and BamHI sites. From the resulting plasmid, pUCG4, the GLO4 ORF ranging from the PstI to theHindIII site was replaced by the URA3 gene, resulting in plasmid pUCG4Δ. The SfuI-BamHI fragment was used as the GLO4 deletion cassette. For the deletion of the GLO1 gene in the strain W303e, the plasmid pE351G1Δ was constructed as follows. The plasmid pE351G1 was cut withBamHI. The fragment that lacked the GLO1 ORF and part of the GLO1 promoter was ligated with the KanMX4 module which had been taken from plasmid pKanMX4 (25Wach A. Brachat A. Pöhlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2232) Google Scholar). TheSalI-PmlI fragment was used as theGLO1 deletion cassette. All deletions were shown to be correct by PCR and Southern blotting using genomic DNA from the respective deletion strains (see below). Haploid and the corresponding diploid strains missing two or all three glyoxalase genes were generated by crossing. Genomic DNA from the yeast strains with different deletions of glyoxalase genes was digested withSspI in the case of the glo2 and glo4deletion loci or with HindIII for the glo1deletion locus, respectively, and blotted onto ZETA probe membrane by alkaline capillary transfer (26Reed K.C. Mann D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 7207-7221Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar). The blots were hybridized with different probes for the glyoxalase genes. These probes were labeled with [α-32P]dATP by random priming (27Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16646) Google Scholar) using the Kit from Böhringer Mannheim. As probes, the following restriction fragments were used (see Fig. 5): the ClaI-EcoRI fragment of the GLO2 gene, theSfuI-DraI fragment of the GLO4 gene, and the HindIII-NdeI fragment of theGLO1 gene, respectively. The wild type GLO2 locus and the wild type GLO4 showed 1100-bp bands, respectively, whereas 1500-bp bands were characteristic for the deletion loci in both cases. The wild type GLO1 locus is characterized by a 1100-bp fragment, and the corresponding deletion locus shows a 700-bp band. 10-ml cultures (grown in LB) were induced at an A600 of 0.2–0.4 with 0.2 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside and grown for a further 3 h at 37 °C. The bacteria were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmdithiothreitol. The cells were lysed by several freeze-thaw cycles. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 4 °C for 30 min at 60,000 ×g to remove cell debris. The total protein concentration was determined by the method described by Bradford (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar). Total protein extracts were prepared by resuspension of pelleted cells in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer containing 2% SDS and boiling for 5 min. Electrophoretic separation of protein extracts on the SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was done as described (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar). For the isolation of the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial compartments, yeast strains were cultured in 400 ml of minimal synthetic medium containing the appropriate amino acids in 5-liter Erlenmeyer flasks. For the growth of deletion strains W3G2 and W3G4, the growth medium contained 3% glycerol instead of glucose, and the cells were harvested by centrifugation at anA600 of 1 to 1.5. The strains W3G24/pGlo2g5 and W3G24/pGlo4g5 were grown in a medium containing 5% glycerol and 0.1% glucose up to an A600 of 0.5. For the induction of the GAL1 promoter 2% galactose was added to the medium, and the strains were grown for further 6 h before the cells were harvested. The cytoplasmic and the mitochondrial compartments of the cells were prepared by differential centrifugation (30Daum G. Böhni P.C. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13028-13033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Yaffe M.P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 627-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Further subfractionation of the mitochondria was done as described (30Daum G. Böhni P.C. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13028-13033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the determination of the specific activity of glyoxalase II of exponentially growing yeast cells, the cultures were grown up to an A600 of 1 to 1.5. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed once in water, and pelleted again. The cells were resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol and disrupted by vortexing with glass beads. To remove cellular debris and macromolecular structures, the cell homogenates were centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were used as cell extracts. The total protein concentration was determined by the method described by Bradford (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar). Glyoxalase I and glyoxalase II activity was measured as described (32Murata K. Saikusa T. Watanabe K. Inoue Y. Fukuda Y. Shimosaka M. Kimura A. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1986; 50: 2381-2383Google Scholar,33Allen R.E. Lo T.W.C. Thornalley P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 1261-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). One unit of glyoxalase II is defined as the amount of enzyme catalyzing the hydrolysis of 1 μmol ofS-d-lactoylglutathione (SLG) in 1 min at 37 °C under the assay conditions (300 μm SLG, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5). The SLG hydrolysis was followed spectrophotometrically at 240 nm (Δε = 3.1 mm−1 cm−1). For the determination of the glyoxalase II activity (given in units glyoxalase II per mg total protein) different amounts of extracts were used to measure the same decrease of SLG of approximately 10% of the total SLG content in the assay reaction. Originally we identified the gene which we propose to nameGLO4 2The gene names GLO2 andGLO4 were reserved in the SGD Gene Name Registry (internet:http://genome-www.stanford.edu.html); the gene name GLO3 was already registered for a gene encoding a zinc finger protein of yet unknown function with similarity to the Gcs1 protein (Gcs1p-like ORF). as a multicopy suppressor for a spore germination defect of a mutant yeast strain (17Wallner, J. (1991) Molekulargenetische Untersuchung der Hefesporengermination, Ph.D. thesis, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.Google Scholar). The mutant strain was transformed with a genomic yeast library constructed in the BamHI site of plasmid YEp13 (34Broach J.R. Strathern J.N. Hicks J.B. Gene ( Amst .). 1979; 8: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). The insert of a complementing plasmid (pE13G4) was sequenced. The sequence (Fig. 1) contained theSNR9 gene coding for the small nuclear RNA 9, the 3′ end of the CKB2 gene coding for the β′ subunit of casein kinase 2, and one complete unknown open reading frame. For a long time, no significant homology of the deduced protein sequence to any protein of known function could be found in the sequence data bases, and we had no indication of the protein function. At the beginning of 1996 the structural gene for the human glyoxalase II (15Ridderström M. Saccucci F. Hellman U. Bergman T. Principato G. Mannervik B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 319-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), HAGH1, was characterized (GenBank™/EMBL accession no. X90999). The deduced amino acid sequence of the suppressor gene ORF showed 34% amino acid identity to the sequence of the human glyoxalase II protein. Furthermore, in April, 1996, the yeast genome sequencing project was finished, and the DNA sequence determined by us revealed 100% identity to a region on chromosome XV (EMBL accession no. Z74948 and X87331). Previously, we had also mapped the GLO4 gene to chromosome XV by chromosomal Southern blotting (35Haider, M. (1994) Molekulare Analyse des Gens GER 1 von Saccharomyces cerevisiae, M.Sc. thesis, University of Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria.Google Scholar). The predicted Glo4 protein has a length of 285 amino acids and the calculated molecular mass is 32,325 Da. The yeast genome sequence also contains a second ORF on yeast chromosome IV (GenBank/EMBL accession no. U51030) which is homologous to the human glyoxalase; the deduced amino acid sequence has 59.1% identity to our putative yeast glyoxalase II, and 41.2% identity to the human glyoxalase II sequence. Therefore, we amplified by PCR a genomic fragment encompassing this second hypothetical glyoxalase II gene and 300 bp upstream and 240 bp downstream of the ORF. We propose to name this gene GLO2. 2 At the 5′ end, the upstream primer contained EcoRI and BspEI restriction sites, and the downstream primer contained aBamHI site at the 5′ ends. The PCR product showed the predicted length of 1430 bp. It was digested with EcoRI andBamHI and cloned into YEp351 vector (21Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar) resulting in plasmid pE351G2. The DNA sequence determined (Fig. 2) was 100% identical to that found in the data base. The GLO2 open reading frame could code for a protein of 274 amino acids and the calculated molecular mass is 31,306 Da. To verify that the two yeast genes are glyoxalase II genes, the yeast strain W303e was transformed either with the plasmid pE13G4 or pE351G2. Transformants were grown in synthetic medium without leucine for plasmid selection and assayed for glyoxalase II activity. In these experiments glucose was the sole carbon source. The strain harboring the GLO2 gene in high copy number showed an approximately 10 times higher glyoxalase II activity than the untransformed wild type strain. The strain harboring the GLO4 gene in high copy number showed no significant increase in glyoxalase II activity (not shown, similar experiments are described below). So we had the first indication that the GLO2 gene encodes a glyoxalase II protein. On the other hand we had no such indication for theGLO4 gene. In the GenBank/EMBL data base we found 16 further proteins predicted from open reading frames that are homologous to the two yeast and the human glyoxalase II proteins. The length of the predicted proteins lies between 206 (the protein from Methanococcus jannaschii) and 285 amino acids (Glo4p from yeast). The alignment of all these sequences (Fig. 3) reveals six regions (box I to VI) that are highly conserved and are distributed over nearly the whole length of the protein. To verify that both yeast ORFs are coding for glyoxalase II enzymes, the complete ORFs from both genes were amplified by PCR and cloned between the NdeI and the StuI sites of E. coli vector pMW172 (22Way M. Pope B. Gooch J. Hawkins M. Weeds A.G. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4103-4109Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The inserts of the resulting plasmids, pGlo2-Ec2 and pGlo4-Ec2, were sequenced and found to be correct. The plasmids were transformed into the E. coli strain BL21(DE3) that allows the expression of the plasmid inserts after induction with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside (36Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5998) Google Scholar). In total protein extracts of both transformant strains additional proteins compared with the strain transformed"

Z. Naturforsch. 1996; 51: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). They are widely distributed in plants and animals (2Siedow J.N. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1991; 42: 145-188Crossref Scopus (700) Google Scholar, 3Yamamoto S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1128: 117-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). In mammals, LOXs are classified according to their positional specificity of arachidonic acid oxygenation (4Kühn H. Prog. Lipid Res. 1996; 35: 203-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Since arachidonic acid is either not present in higher plants or is a minor constituent of cellular lipids, plant LOXs may be classified into 9- and 13-LOXs with respect to their positional specificity in linoleic acid oxygenation. Recently, a more comprehensive classification of plant LOXs has been proposed based on the comparison of their primary structures (5Shibata D. Axelrod B. J. Lipid Mediators Cell Signal. 1995; 12: 213-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Although plant and mammalian lipoxygenases have been extensively characterized with respect to their protein chemical and enzymatic properties, there is no general idea of their biological importance (1Rosahl S. Z. Naturforsch. 1996; 51: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In plants, 13-LOXs have been implicated in the biosynthesis of jasmonic acid (6Sembdner G. Parthier B. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 569-589Crossref Scopus (680) Google Scholar). This phytohormone has been shown to be an important mediator in the wound response of plants to herbivore attack (7Bergey D.R. Hoi G.A. Ryan C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12053-12058Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 8Farmer E.E. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 26: 1423-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). For many years, plant and animal LOXs have been considered to oxygenate mainly free polyenoic fatty acids, forming oxygenated derivatives that may exhibit biological activities (2Siedow J.N. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1991; 42: 145-188Crossref Scopus (700) Google Scholar, 4Kühn H. Prog.

On the other hand, more recent studies have suggested that certain plant (10Maccarrone M. Van Aarle P.G.M. Veldink G.A. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Biochim. Biophys.

FEBS Lett. 1975; 60: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) are able to oxygenate not only free polyenoic fatty acids but also ester lipid substrates, such as phospholipids (15Murray J.J. Brash A.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 265: 514-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and cholesterol esters (16Belkner J. Wiesner R. Kühn H. Lankin V.Z. FEBS Lett. 1991; 279: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and even more complex lipid-protein assemblies such as biomembranes (17Kühn H. Belkner J. Wiesner R. Eur. J.

Although these experiments indicate the ability of certain LOXs to accept complex ester lipids as substrates, it is unclear whether such reactions actually occur in vivo. In mammals, the in vivo activity of 15-LOXs on membrane lipids was measured in rabbit reticulocytes (13Fiskum G. Bryant R.W. Low C.E. Pease A. Bailey J.M. Bailey J.M.

Faehrenklemper T. Wohlfeil S. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1903-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and humans (22Folcik V.A. Nivar-Aristy R.A. Krajewski L.P. Cathcardt M.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 504-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). We recently extended these findings to plants (23Feussner I. Wasternack C. Kindl H. Kühn H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11849-11853Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Investigating the metabolism of storage lipids in germinating cucumber seedlings, we found that a special isoform of linoleate 13-LOX is synthesized at very early stages of germination, which translocates to the lipid storage organelles (lipid bodies) and oxygenates the storage triacylglycerols rather than free linoleic acid released by the action of a lipid-hydrolyzing enzyme. Moreover, we found large amounts of oxygenated free linoleic acid derivatives in the cytosol of seedlings, suggesting that these derivatives are preferentially cleaved from the lipid stores. Although the enzyme responsible for this release has not been characterized, these data suggest a mobilization of the storage lipids for β-oxidation by a specific isoform of linoleate 13-LOX (24Feussner I. Kühn H. Wasternack C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 406: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) without initiation by a lipase. For direct evidence on the in vivo activity of the lipid body LOX in cucumber seedlings, we analyzed the chemical structure of the oxygenated storage lipids occurring during germination and found that hydroperoxy derivatives of linoleate-containing triacylglycerols constitute the major oxygenated storage lipids. Since these compounds exhibit a high enantiospecificity, they are likely to be formed by thein vivo action of the lipid body LOX. The chemicals used were from the following sources: standards of chiral and racemic hydroxy fatty acids from Chayman Chemicals; methanol, hexane, and 2-propanol (all HPLC grade) from Baker; 1,3-dilinolein and trilinolein from Sigma (Germany). Seeds of cucumber (Cucumis sativus L. cv. Chinesische Schlange) and of sunflower (Helianthus annuus L. cv. Albena) were used for the experiments. Cotyledons of 10 dry seeds or of seedlings germinated for various time periods in the dark at 27 °C and 100% humidity were used. Lipid bodies were prepared by ultracentrifugation (25Feussner I. Kindl H. FEBS Lett. 1992; 298: 223-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and its LOX was purified to apparent homogeneity by selective extraction with Brij 99 (26Feussner I. Kindl H. Planta. 1994; 194: 22-28Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In vitro oxygenation of 1,3-dilinolein and trilinolein was carried out by incubating 100 μg of the purified cucumber lipid body LOX with these substrates (800 μmfinal concentration) in 0.2 m sodium borate buffer (pH 8.5) for 45 min at room temperature. The substrates were added as aqueous stock suspensions (20 mm), which were prepared by emulsifying dilinolein and trilinolein in 2.5 ml of Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 15% (w/v) arabic gum with a tip sonifier (27Matsui K. Kajiwara T. Lipids. 1995; 30: 733-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The reaction products were extracted with three volumes of a chloroform/methanol mixture (2:1, by volume). After recovery of the organic phase, solvents were evaporated under vacuum, and the lipids were reconstituted in 0.1 ml of HPLC solvent A (see below). The isolated lipid bodies were resuspended in 0.1m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and the suspension was sonicated to achieve a homogenous dispersion. After acidification to pH 3, the lipids were extracted. After removal of the organic phase, the solvents were evaporated, and the lipids were reconstituted in chloroform. Aliquots were treated with triphenylphosphine to reduce hydroperoxy compounds to their corresponding hydroxy derivatives. These aliquots were diluted with methanol to a final volume of 0.4 ml. Then 0.08 ml of 40% (w/v) KOH was added, and the samples were hydrolyzed under argon atmosphere for 20 min at 60 °C. After cooling down to room temperature, the samples were acidified with glacial acetic acid, and aliquots of the hydrolysis mixture were injected to RP-HPLC for quantification of the oxidation degree of the tissue lipids (determination of the hydroxy linoleic acid:linoleic acid ratio). The nonreduced lipid extracts were analyzed by RP-HPLC with a solvent system suitable for separation of oxygenated triacylglycerols. HPLC analysis was carried out on a Shimadzu HPLC system or on a Beckman HPLC system, both of them coupled to a diode array detector. RP-HPLC of the free fatty acid derivatives was carried out on a Nucleosil C-18 column (Macherey-Nagel, KS system, 250 × 4 mm, 5-μm particle size) with a solvent system of methanol/water/acetic acid (85/15/0.1 by volume) and a flow rate of 1 ml/min. For calculation of the hydroxylinoleic acid:linoleic acid ratio, the absorbances at 234 nm (conjugated diene system of the hydroxy fatty acids) and 210 nm (polyenoic fatty acids) were recorded simultaneously. Oxygenated linoleic acid-containing neutral lipids was separated on a Nucleosil C-18 column (Macherey-Nagel, KS system, 250 × 4 mm, 5-μm particle size) using a binary gradient system (solvent A, methanol/water/acetic acid (90/10/0.1 by volume); solvent B, methanol/acetic acid (100/0.1 by volume)) with the following gradient program: 10 min at 100% solvent A and then 20 min with a linear increase of solvent B to 100% solvent B followed by an isocratic postrun of 50 min at 100% B. The absorbance at 234 nm was recorded. For detection of hydroperoxy lipids, the peroxide-induced isoluminol chemiluminescence was measured online using a Berthold HPLC radioactivity detector LB 506C. For this purpose, the column effluent was mixed with a microperoxidase/isoluminol solution (28Sattler W. Mohr D. Stocker R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 469-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Straight phase HPLC (SP-HPLC) of hydroxy fatty acid isomers was carried out on a Zorbax SIL column (DuPont, 250 × 4.6 mm, 5-μm particle size) with a solvent system of n-hexane/2-propanol/acetic acid (100/2/0.1 by volume) and a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The enantiomer composition of the hydroxy fatty acids was analyzed by chiral phase HPLC on a Chiralcel OD column (Diacel Chemical Industries, 250 × 4.6 mm, 5-μm particle size; purchased from Baker, Deventer, The Netherlands) with a solvent system of hexane/2-propanol/acetic acid (100/5/0.1 by volume) and a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) was performed with a Hewlett-Packard GC/MS system equipped with a capillary RSL-150 column (polydimethyl siloxane, 30 m × 0.32 mm; 0.25-mm coating thickness; Research Separation Laboratories, Belgium) and using the following temperature program: 2 min at 180 °C and then with a rate of 5 °C/min to 250 °C; injector temperature 275 °C, ion source temperature 180 °C. An electron energy of 70 eV was used. The hydroxy fatty acids prepared by SP-HPLC were methylated with diazomethane, repurified on SP-HPLC, silylated with bis-(trimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide in the presence of dry pyridine, and then subjected to GC/MS analysis. For more informative mass spectra, catalytic hydrogenation of the hydroxy fatty acid methyl esters was carried out. NMR measurements were performed with a VARIAN Unity 500 spectrometer at 499.84 MHz (1H) using a NALORAC 3-mm microsample inverse detection probe. CDCl3 was used as solvent with tetramethylsilane as internal reference. Two-dimensional COSY and 1H,13C chemical shift-correlated two-dimensional NMR (HMQC) spectra were recorded according to standard VARIAN pulse programs. The lipid bodies of cucumber seedlings contain specifically oxygenated ester lipids, and preliminary structural analysis of these compounds suggested that they may be formed in vivo by the lipid body LOX (23Feussner I. Wasternack C. Kindl H. Kühn H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11849-11853Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). To find out whether this enzyme is capable of oxygenating neutral ester lipids, it was purified to apparent electrophoretic homogeneity from the lipid bodies of cucumber seedlings and was incubated with 1,3-dilinolein and with trilinolein for 25 min at room temperature, and the lipids were analyzed by RP-HPLC for the occurrence of oxygenated derivatives. From Fig. 1 (upper trace), it can be seen that two major products (I and II), both of which contain the characteristic conjugated diene chromophore (insets), were formed during the oxygenation of 1,3-dilinolein. Both compounds were prepared, reduced with triphenylphosphine, and hydrolyzed under alkaline conditions. RP-HPLC analysis of the hydrolysis mixture indicated that product II contained equimolar amounts of linoleic acid and 13-HODE. The chemical structure of both linoleic acid and 13-HODE was confirmed by co-chromatography with authentic standards in RP- and SP-HPLC as well as by GC/MS (data not shown). These data suggested that product II may constitute a mono-oxygenated dilinolein derivative. Analyzing the hydrolysis mixture of product I by HPLC, we mainly detected 13-HODE; only trace amounts of linoleic acid were detected, suggesting that product I was a dilinolein derivative containing two 13-HODE residues. The lower tracein Fig. 1 shows an HPLC analysis of the oxygenation products formed during the reaction of the lipid body LOX with trilinolein. Three major products (A, B, and C), each of them containing a conjugated diene chromophore, were observed. HPLC analysis of their hydrolysis products (data not shown) suggested that product C was a mono-oxygenated trilinolein, product B a double-oxygenated trilinolein, and product A a triple-oxygenated trilinolein. These in vitro data indicate that the lipid body LOX is capable of oxygenating di- and triacylglycerols and thus may be responsible for the in vivo formation of oxygenated storage lipids during germination of cucumber seedlings described recently (23Feussner I. Wasternack C. Kindl H. Kühn H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11849-11853Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In a lipid extract of 4-day-old cucumber seedlings, a large amount of 13S-HODE was found when the lipids were extracted under reducing conditions and when the extracts were hydrolyzed prior to RP-HPLC analysis (23Feussner I. Wasternack C. Kindl H. Kühn H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11849-11853Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). For more detailed structural analysis of the oxygenation products, we separated components of lipid extracts obtained from 4-day-old cucumber cotyledons under nonreducing conditions and without previous hydrolysis. To detect the peroxy lipids, the absorbance at 234 nm and the peroxide-induced luminol chemiluminescence were recorded simultaneously. In Fig. 2, a representative chromatogram of such an analysis is shown. Five major products, some of which appear to be heterogeneous, can be separated. Product 1 co-migrated with triple-oxygenated trilinolein (see above). Products 2 and 4 co-eluted with double-oxygenated and mono-oxygenated trilinolein, respectively. Interestingly, all major compounds detected at 234 nm appeared in the chemiluminescence assay, indicating that all fractions contain hydroperoxy lipids. However, exact quantification of the hydroperoxide content by chemiluminescence was problematic under our assay conditions. Therefore, we determined the hydroperoxide:hydroxide ratio by 1H NMR measurements (see below). For further structural information, the oxygenation products 1–5 were isolated by RP-HPLC, reduced with triphenylphosphine, and hydrolyzed under alkaline conditions. The resulting free oxygenated fatty acid derivatives containing the conjugated diene chromophore were isolated by RP-HPLC and were further analyzed by SP- and CP-HPLC as well as by GC/MS. For product 1, which co-migrated with the triple-oxygenated trilinolein in RP-HPLC, 13-HODE was detected as the major product in the hydrolysis mixture; only trace amounts of linoleic acid and other fatty acids were found (Table I). The lack of linoleic acid and oleic acid was also indicated by the absence of olefinic protons in 1H NMR. These data suggest that product 1 may constitute a triacylglycerol containing three HODE residues. In HPLC analysis of the hydrolysis mixture of product 2, substantial amounts of linoleic acid were detected (linoleic acid:HODE ratio of 1:1.7). This value and the fact that product 2 co-chromatographed with a double-oxygenated trilinolein suggested that product 2 constitutes a triacylglycerol containing two HODE residues and one nonoxygenated linoleic acid. For product 3, which migrated close to the double-oxygenated trilinolein in RP-HPLC, a strong preponderance of HODE over linoleic acid was found in the hydrolysis mixture (Table I). However, in GC/MS large amounts of oleic acid, stearic acid, and myristic acid were detected. These analytical data suggest that product 3 may constitute a triacylglycerol containing two HODE residues and one other fatty acid. For product 4, which co-chromatographed with a standard of mono-oxygenated trilinolein, a linoleic acid:HODE ratio of about 1:0.4 was calculated. In GC/MS, no significant amounts of other fatty acids were detected. These data are consistent with a chemical structure of product 4 as triacylglycerol containing one HODE and two nonoxygenated linoleic acid residues. For product 5, a linoleic acid:HODE ratio of about 1:0.6 was analyzed. In addition, substantial amounts of other fatty acids such as oleic acid, stearic acid, and myristic acid were detected in the hydrolysis mixture. These data suggest that product 5 may constitute a mixture of triacylglycerols that contain one HODE residue and two other fatty acids. It should be mentioned that product 5 showed considerable heterogeneity when the lipid extracts of various preparations were compared.Table IAnalytic data of structure elucidation of the oxygenated storage lipidsRP-HPLC fractionRetention timeLA1-aLinoleic acid.: HODE ratio (RP-HPLC)S/R ratio of 13-HODE (CP-HPLC)HPODE:HODE ratio(1H NMR)min1291:19.096:419:12351:1.796:416:1337ND1-bIn fraction 3 the amount of linoleic acid was below the detection limit.95:530:14451:0.496:49:15481:0.695:519:1Lipid bodies of 4-day-old cotyledons were extracted and analyzed by HPLC and NMR as described under “Experimental Procedures.”1-a Linoleic acid.1-b In fraction 3 the amount of linoleic acid was below the detection limit. Open table in a new tab Lipid bodies of 4-day-old cotyledons were extracted and analyzed by HPLC and NMR as described under “Experimental Procedures.” To determine the mechanism of biosynthesis of the oxygenated storage lipids, more detailed structural information is necessary. For separation of the positional and geometric HODE isomers, the hydrolysis mixtures of triphenylphosphine-treated compounds 1–5 were analyzed by SP-HPLC. In Fig. 3, a representative chromatogram of such an analysis is shown for product 4. 13-HODE(Z,E) was the major oxygenated linoleic acid isomer. In addition, only small amounts of 9-HODE(E,Z) and of the corresponding all-E isomers were detected. Recording the absorbance at 270 nm (data not shown), keto linoleic acid isomers (13-KODE) were also detected; they accounted for about 7% of the oxygenated linoleic acid derivatives. The structure of all products was confirmed by UV spectroscopy and GC/MS of the native compounds and of their hydrogenated derivatives (data not shown). Similar results were obtained for all oxygenated storage lipids (products 1–5). Analysis of the enantiomer composition of 13-HODE(Z,E) by chiral phase HPLC (inset) indicated a strong preponderance of the S-isomer over the corresponding R-isomer (Table I). Taken together, the analytic data indicate a remarkably high specificity of the biosynthesis of the oxygenated storage lipids, suggesting that they are formed by the in vivo action of a LOX. The high product specificity detected implicated an involvement of a LOX in the biosynthesis of the oxygenated storage lipids. Although the chemiluminescence measurements suggested thein vivo formation of hydroperoxy lipids (Fig. 2, lower trace), there was no direct proof for the assumption that the majority of the oxygenated storage lipids constituted specific hydroperoxy derivatives and thus may originate from a LOX pathway. To test this hypothesis, we calculated the hydroperoxy lipid:hydroxy lipid ratio by 1H NMR measurements. This method takes advantage of the different chemical shifts of the dienoic protons. In Fig. 4 (lower traces), the low field regions of the 1H spectra of 13-HODE and 13-HPODE are shown, and in Table II selected1H and 13C NMR data are summarized. All low field signals were unambiguously assigned, based on the connectivities of the 1H,1H COSY two-dimensional spectra (data not shown). The assignment of the corresponding 13C signals followed from the proton-detected one-bond1H,13C chemical shift-correlated two-dimensional NMR experiments (HMQC). Earlier published assignments of C-11 and C-12 of 13-HODE (29Frankel E.N. Neff W.E. Weisleder D. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 380-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) have to be interchanged.Table IISelected date of 1 H and 13 C NMR of authentic standards of 13-HODE and 13-HPODEPosition13-HODE13-HPODE1Hcoupling constant13C chemical shift1Hcoupling constantChemical shiftMultiplicityChemical shiftMultiplicity13C Coupling constantppmHzppmppmHzppm 95.443dt10.8/7.8132.85.494dt10.8/7.8133.8105.977dd11.1/10.8127.96.007dd11.1/10.8127.6116.504dd15.2/11.1125.86.568dd15.2/11.1130.0125.670dd15.2/6.6135.85.569dd15.2/8.0131.3134.193dt6.6/6.672.84.383dt8.0/6.786.8The solvent was CDCl3 in 13C measurements the chemical shifts (ppm) of cross peaks in HMQC spectra are given. Open table in a new tab The solvent was CDCl3 in 13C measurements the chemical shifts (ppm) of cross peaks in HMQC spectra are given. The olefinic protons of 13-HODE and 13-HPODE show distinct differences in chemical shifts (H-12, Δδ 0.10; H-11, Δδ 0.06). The integrals of the H-11 signals were chosen for calculation of the hydroperoxide:hydroxide ratio because these signals were not superimposed with other 1H signals, as H-9 and H-10 were. From the 1H NMR spectra of the four major oxygenated triacylglycerols (Fig. 4), it can be concluded that in all fractions 13-HPODE was the major oxygenated fatty acid; only small amounts of 13-HODE were detectable in some fractions (Table I). The preponderance of 13-HPODE over 13-HODE in all fractions of the storage lipids was also proved by the HMQC spectra. In Fig. 5, a comparison of the low field region of the one-bond 1H,13C shift correlation two-dimensional NMR spectrum (HMQC) of product 2 and the relevant parts of the HMQC spectra of 13-HPODE and 13-HODE (insets) are shown. The 13C chemical shift of C-13 (δ 86.8) indicates 13-HPODE to be the main lipid oxygenation product. The steady state concentration of LOX products in the storage lipids did increase in a time-dependent manner during germination (Fig. 6). During onset of germination (12 h), small amounts of mono-oxygenated triacylglycerols (products 4 and 5) were detected. At later stages (48 h), the oxygenated lipids were augmented, and the share of double and triple oxygenation products was increased. After 72 h of germination, we observed a decline of the oxygenation products, suggesting an exhaustion of the storage lipid (not shown). To determine whether the oxygenation of storage lipids during early stages of germination is restricted to cucumber, we analyzed lipid extracts of lipid bodies of 4-day-old sunflower seedlings for the occurrence of oxygenated fatty acids by NMR (Fig. 7). Large amounts of hydroperoxy and hydroxy fatty acids could be detected. Comparison of the amounts of oxygenated lipids present in the storage lipids of cotyledons of cucumber and sunflowers at day 4 of germination indicated a 3-fold higher concentration in cucumber seedlings. Moreover, in sunflowers we observed an almost equal distribution (1:1.26) of hydroperoxy and hydroxy lipids, suggesting that the peroxide-reducing capacity is much higher in sunflowers. These data indicate similarities in the mechanism of lipid mobilization of cucumber and sunflowers. Mobilization of storage lipids that are utilized as carbon and energy source in growing seedlings is an essential process in germination of cucumber and of various oil seed plants. Unfortunately, the mechanism of this process is far from clear. For a long time, it has been assumed that lipid mobilization is initiated by the liberation of free fatty acids from the storage lipids. The free fatty acids are subsequently transported to peroxisomes and there may undergo β-oxidation. However, a lipase activity responsible for fatty acid liberation from the lipid storage organelles has not been detected in cucumber. A specific lipid body LOX induced during early stages of germination was recently reported (23Feussner I. Wasternack C. Kindl H. Kühn H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11849-11853Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). It appears to translocate to the lipid storage organelles to oxygenate the storage lipids. This oxygenation was recently suggested to be the initiation of the mobilizing cascade of the storage lipids (24Feussner I. Kühn H. Wasternack C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 406: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In addition to the lipid body LOX, this metabolizing cascade should also involve a lipid hydrolyzing enzyme, most probably a triacylglycerol lipase. This enzyme may cleave preferentially oxygenated triacylglycerols. Although this enzyme has not been characterized with respect to its protein chemical and enzymatic properties, there is experimental evidence for its existence. (i) Analysis of the amount and composition of free fatty acids in the seedlings' cytosol indicated large amounts of 13S-HODE but almost no linoleic acid. (ii) In vitro experiments indicated that, from isolated lipid bodies, only 13S-HODE is liberated into the surrounding medium. Although these preliminary data suggest the existence of a lipase that preferentially cleaves oxidized storage lipids, there is no direct proof for the in vivo activity of such an enzyme. Recently, lipases that appear to prefer oxygenated ester lipids over nonoxygenated lipids have been described for microsomal membranes of various plants (30Stahl U. Banas A. Stymne S. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 953-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Our NMR data indicate that the majority of the oxygenated storage lipids are present in cucumber seedlings as 13-HPODE derivatives. Together with the enantiomer composition, these data strongly suggest a storage lipid oxygenation by a LOX, whereas other enzymatic and/or nonenzymatic oxygenating pathways are highly improbable. However, a specific product pattern alone does not prove the in vivoaction of a LOX. Recently, it was observed that myoglobin in the presence of hydrogen peroxide is capable of oxygenating linoleic acid preferentially to 9S-HPODE (31Rao S.I. Wilks A. Hamberg M. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7210-7216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it may be possible that still unknown enzymes or nonenzymatic catalysts are also capable of producing a specific product pattern. However, since the formation of specifically oxygenated storage lipids in cucumber seedlings is paralleled by the expression of the lipid body LOX, which is capable of oxygenating triacylglycerols in vitro, it appears reasonable to assume a causal relation between LOX expression and storage lipid oxygenation. The accumulation of hydroperoxy lipids within the lipid bodies of germinating cucumber seedlings is quite remarkable. Rough estimates showed that about 15% of polyunsaturated fatty acids in the storage lipids at day 4 of germination are present as hydroperoxy derivatives, and thus the lipid storage organelles are characterized by a high oxidizing potential. In contrast, in intact mammalian cells hydroperoxy lipids can hardly be detected, even in cells in which LOXs are expressed at high levels (20Kühn H. Belkner J. Wiesner R. Brash A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18351-18361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Weitzel F. Wendel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6288-6292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This leads to the conclusion that the reducing capacity of animal cells, which is mainly due to the catalytic activity of glutathione peroxidases (33Flohé, L. (1989) in Glutathione: Chemical, Biochemical and Medical Aspects (Dolphin, D., Poulson, R., and Avramovic, O., eds) Part A, pp. 643–731, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York.Google Scholar, 34Ursini F. Maiorino M. Grigelius-Flohé R. Aumann K.D. Rovery A. Schomburg D. Flohé L. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 38-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar), is much higher than that of the seedlings. Nevertheless, it is quite surprising that there is no obvious damage in seedlings by such high peroxide concentrations. It may be possible that the peroxides are kept inside the lipid bodies and thus may not interfere with other metabolic pathways for which peroxides may be toxic. The sequence of metabolic events involved in the breakdown cascade of storage lipids following LOX-catalyzed oxygenation remains to be investigated. Looking at the metabolic flux of peroxisomal β-oxidation, it appears to be necessary that lipid peroxides are reduced before entering the β-oxidation cascade. In principle, there are two different ways for oxygenated lipids to enter β-oxidation. (i) The hydroperoxy triacylglycerols are reduced to the corresponding hydroxy derivatives from which hydroxy fatty acids may be subsequently liberated. These hydroxy fatty acids are then transported to the peroxisomes and may undergo β-oxidation. This order of events accords with the fact that mainly hydroxy fatty acids were detected in the cytosol and in our in vitro liberation assays (23Feussner I. Wasternack C. Kindl H. Kühn H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11849-11853Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 24Feussner I. Kühn H. Wasternack C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 406: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). (ii) The hydroperoxy triacylglycerols formed by the LOX are directly cleaved, and the free hydroperoxy fatty acids are reduced in the cytosol to the corresponding hydroxy compounds. Several metabolic routes including the peroxidase activity of LOX (35Gardner H.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1084: 221-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar) and the peroxygenase pathway (36Blee E. Piazza G.J. Lipoxygenase and Lipoxygenase Pathway Enzymes. American Organic Chemical Society Press, Champaign, IL1996: 138-161Crossref Google Scholar) have been shown to reduce peroxy fatty acids in plants. Most of these pathways require a reductant and lead to the formation of other secondary products like epoxy hydroxy compounds, keto dienes, α-ketols, etc. In addition, one should consider the possibility that “glutathione peroxidase-like pathways” that reduce peroxy fatty acids directly to the hydroxy compounds may be involved (37Beeort-Zahar T. Ben-Hayyim G. Holland D. Faltin Z. Eshdat Y. FEBS Lett. 1995; 366: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Although most of the experiments reported here were carried out with cucumber seedlings, there are reports on the occurrence of a special lipid body LOX in other plants (25Feussner I. Kindl H. FEBS Lett. 1992; 298: 223-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 38Pilar Rodriguez-Rosales, M., Kerkeb, L., Ferrol, N., and Donaire, J. P. (1996) Plant Physiol.

Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1997: 268-270Crossref Google Scholar). We have detected large amounts of oxygenated storage lipids in sunflower and soybean, suggesting that the mechanisms involved in lipid mobilization during cucumber germination may also occur in other plants. Thus, the concept of implicating a special LOX in the mobilization cascade of storage lipids may be of a general pathway for plants utilizing lipids as a major carbon and energy source for seedling growth. Inhibitor studies and/or experiments with transgenic plants in which the lipid body LOX gene is specifically knocked out remain to be carried out in the future to verify this concept. We thank Dr. S. Rosahl for critical reading of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2094838950,"In vitro DNase I footprint analysis of the rat fatty acid synthase (FAS) promoter from −568 to −468 revealed four protein binding sites: A, B, and C boxes and the FAS insulin-responsive element 1 (FIRE1). As demonstrated by gel mobility shift analysis and supershift experiments, FIRE1, located between −516 and −498, is responsible for binding NF-Y. The C box located downstream of FIRE1 was shown by in vitro footprinting to be a Sp1 binding site, and furthermore, competition with Sp1 also abolished FIRE1 binding. Since the half-life of the Sp1·NF-Y·DNA complex is significantly longer than the half-lives of the Sp1·DNA or NF-Y·DNA complexes, the two transcription factors are deemed to bind cooperatively in the FAS promoter at −500. It is unusual that NF-Y binds at this distance from the start site of transcription. NF-Y binding sites are found in the promoters of at least three other FAS genes, viz. goose, chicken, and man. A second NF-Y binding site is located in the FAS promoter at the more usual position of −103 to −87, and it too has a neighboring Sp1 site. CTF/NF-1 competes for proteins binding to the B box. The A box binds Sp1 and contains a 12/13 match of the inverted repeat sequence responsible for binding the nuclear factor EF-C/RFX-1 in the enhancer regions of hepatitis B virus and the major histocompatibility complex class II antigen promoter. The same relative positions of NF-Y and Sp1 binding sites in the promoters of FAS genes of goose, rat, chicken, and man emphasize the involvement of these transcription factors in the diet and hormonal regulation of FAS.

Not surprisingly, this enzyme, which converts dietary calories into a storage form of energy, reacts to diet, the cognate mRNA undergoing a severalfold induction when a previously starved animal is refed (3Iritani N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 4Laux T. Schweizer M. Biochem. J. 1990; 266: 793-797PubMed Google Scholar). This refeeding phenomenon is not encountered in diabetic animals, suggesting that the peptide hormone insulin may have a direct or indirect effect on the nutritional response (5Paulauskis J.D. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 263: 574-577Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). To study the molecular basis of the nutritional response we embarked on a systematic investigation of the promoter of the FAS gene ofRattus norvegicus and have shown that its chromatin structure responds to a nutritional stimulus as demonstrated by its altered sensitivity to DNase I (6Roder K. Klein H. Kranz H. Beck K.-F. Schweizer M. Gene ( Amst. ). 1994; 144: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The distribution of DNase I-hypersensitive sites in the rat FAS promoter changed and their number increased when hepatic chromatin from refed animals was compared with that of starved animals. In the region of the DNase I-hypersensitive site located at approximately −500, we identified a tripartite element, FIRE1, with strong sequence homology to the insulin-responsive element of the human GAPDH gene (7Nasrin N. Ercolani L. Denaro M. Kong X.F. Kang I. Alexander M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5273-5277Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Using gel mobility shift assays we showed that the protein binding properties of FIRE1 were dependent on each of the three regions, viz. 5′-GCCT, a 6-nucleotide spacer, and a 3′-palindrome. Transient transfection of the human hepatoma cell line HepG2 with successively deleted FAS promoter constructs fused to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene has shown that the promoter construct retaining the DNase I-hypersensitive site mediates a 2.5-fold effect of insulin as measured by CAT activity (8Wolf S.S. Hofer G. Beck K.-F. Roder K. Schweizer M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 943-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Based on these results we propose that the nutritional effect on the expression of the rat FAS gene may be insulin-mediated via protein(s) binding to the FIRE1 element. A second insulin-responsive element, FIRE2, located at −300 base pairs on the promoter of the rat FAS gene, was revealed by these transfection studies. Yet a third element, FAS-IRS-A, has been postulated by Sul and co-workers (9Moustaı̈d N. Beyer R.S. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5629-5634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), between nucleotides −68 and −52 and has been defined by gel mobility shift assay and in vitro footprint analysis. This location of FAS-IRS-A could well be the same as that of FIRE3, which we claimed to be responsible for the 2-fold insulin-mediated stimulation of the FAS promoter activity observed with the −179 FAS/CAT promoter construct in H4IIE and HepG2 (8Wolf S.S. Hofer G. Beck K.-F. Roder K. Schweizer M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 943-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Furthermore, three tandem repeats of FAS-IRS-A conferred insulin responsiveness on a heterologous promoter in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (9Moustaı̈d N. Beyer R.S. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5629-5634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the insulin response conferred by three tandem repeats of FAS-IRS-A could not be repeated in our hands. The ubiquitous basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper-containing transcription factors USF1 and USF2 have been identified as major components of the protein complex(es) binding to FAS-IRS-A (10Wang D. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28716-28722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). USF has also been shown to bind to carbohydrate-responsive elements (ChoRE) found in the promoters of several lipogenic genes (11Shih H.-M. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9380-9387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro footprint analysis and the ability to confer glucose responsiveness on a heterologous promoter, permitted the definition of a ChoRE at position −1448 and −1428 in the promoter of the S14 gene (11Shih H.-M. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9380-9387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and at −171 and −124 in the liver-type pyruvate kinase gene (12Liu Z. Thompson K.S. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12787-12795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A similar sequence has been postulated to be present in the promoter of the rat FAS gene within the first intron and has been shown to confer glucose responsiveness on a heterologous promoter. This sequence is not liver-specific since a footprint was found at the same position when using extracts from spleen, and gel mobility shift studies have shown that it binds the ubiquitous USF/MLTF transcription factor and CTF/NF-1 (13Foufelle F. Lepetit N. Bosc D. Delzenne N. Morin J. Raymondjean M. Ferré P. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 521-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Another member of the basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper transcription factor family, ADD1, was found by screening a rat adipocyte library with the EC oligonucleotide having the sequence 5′-GATCCAATTGGGCAATCAGGA-3′ (14Tontonoz P. Kim J.B. Graves R.A. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4753-4759Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). The artificial EC oligonucleotide has a 9-nucleotide identity with part of the FIRE1 element we have defined by DNase I hypersensitivity between −518 and −495 of the promoter of the rat FAS gene. A CAT reporter gene containing multiple copies of the relevant region of the FAS promoter could be stimulated when the ADD1 protein was coexpressed in NIH 3T3-L1 fibroblasts. ADD1 is the murine counterpart of the human SREBP-1, which has been shown to bind to the promoter of the rat FAS gene (15Bennet M.K. Lopez J.M. Sanchez H.B. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25578-25583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). ADD1/SREBP-1 is involved in the sterol regulation of the FAS promoter, thus linking the regulation of lipogenesis with that of cholesterol (16Kim J.B. Spotts G.D. Halvorsen Y.-D. Shih H.-M. Ellenberger T. Towle H.C. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2582-2588Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). In this study we investigated the protein binding characteristics of FIRE1, i.e. we undertook footprint analysis of the promoter region that contains a diet-induced DNase I-hypersensitive site and whose sequence contains both E- and CAAT-box motifs (6Roder K. Klein H. Kranz H. Beck K.-F. Schweizer M. Gene ( Amst. ). 1994; 144: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Using a series of gel mobility shift analyses, we searched for the FIRE1 binding factor by a process of elimination and identified the transcription factor binding thereon as one which has been conserved from yeast to mammals, namely NF-Y. The initial in vitro footprint analysis indicates the presence of a Sp1 binding site next to FIRE1. The cooperative binding has been demonstrated between NF-Y and Sp1 by measuring the half-lives of the relevant DNA·protein complexes. We also found a second NF-Y/Sp1 binding site, albeit with a different spacer, at −103/−82 of the FAS promoter and will comment on the remarkable conservation between the promoters of FAS genes of birds and mammals (17Beck K.-F.

Yamasaki T. Lucas P.C. Wang J.C. Powell D.R. Granner D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1747-1758Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This protocol minimizes variability arising from differences in transfection efficiency. Where indicated 10 nm insulin was added for a period of 24 h. Luciferase activity was measured in a Lumat luminometer LB9501 (Berthold, UK) with luciferin as the substrate (Promega Biotech Inc.). The FAS minimal promoter was created by using an oligonucleotide corresponding to the rat FAS sequence from −50 to +12 relative to the transcriptional start site of the FAS mRNA (17Beck K.-F. Schreglmann R. Stathopulos I. Klein H. Hoch J. Schweizer M. Journal of DNA Sequencing and Mapping. 1992; 2: 359-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The double-stranded oligonucleotide decorated with NheI and BglII sites was cloned into pGL2 basic (Promega). Two copies of the A oligonucleotide representing the A box were inserted in the NheI site upstream of the FAS minimal promoter to create plasmid A. Plasmid C with two copies of the C box was constructed in a similar manner. The promoter fragment for footprint analysis was derived from the FAS/CAT construct −565/+65 (8Wolf S.S. Hofer G. Beck K.-F. Roder K. Schweizer M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 943-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). pGEM-NF-YA was constructed by inserting the entire NF-YA-coding sequence contained on an EcoRI/XbaI fragment of pYA-PB9 (24van Huijsduijnen R.H. Li X.Y. Black D. Matthes H. Benoist C. Mathis D. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3119-3127Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) into pGEM-3Zf(+) (Promega). TheSalI/XhoI herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter fragment of CAT5 (25Boshart M. Klüppel M. Schmidt A. Schütz G. Luckow B. Gene ( Amst. ). 1992; 110: 129-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) was inserted into the XhoI site of pGL2 basic to create LuciTK. LuciTK-IGFBP-1 contains the IRE of the promoter of the IGFBP-1 gene (26Suwanickul A. Morris S.L. Powell D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17063-17068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) upstream of the tyrosine kinase promoter. pGL(−816) contains the FAS promoter from −816 to +67 upstream of the luciferase gene of pGL2 basic. In the pGL(−816) derivative pGL(−816)ΔFIRE1 the FIRE1 core sequence 5′-TGTCCAATTGGTCT-3′ has been replaced by a PstI restriction site. The mutation was created by the Chameleon double-stranded, site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Similarly, pGL(−816)ΔC box contains a HindIII site instead of the core sequence 5′-CCACGCCCC-3′. Single-stranded oligonucleotides were synthesized using the Applied Biosystem model 392 with appropriate restriction endonuclease sitesBamHI and XbaI (not shown) at their termini. AP-1, AP-2, C/EBP, CREBP, MLTF-1, NF-1, and Sp1 (27Faisst S. Meyer S.

The EC box is a synthetic sequence containing a binding site for C/EBP and an overlapping E-box motif (14Tontonoz P. Kim J.B. Graves R.A. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell.

Whole cell extracts from HepG2 were prepared according to Jiang and Eberhardt (30Jiang S.-W. Eberhardt N.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 17: 3607-3608Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts of HepG2, H4IIE, and 3T3-L1 were prepared according to the procedure of Schlokat (31Schlokat, U. (1987) Immunoglobulin Enhancer-bindende Faktoren: Identifikation, Charakterisierung, Reinigung, und Wechselwirkung mit anderen Enhancer Elementen. Ph.D. thesis, University of Heidelberg.Google Scholar). Assays were performed exactly as described previously (6Roder K. Klein H. Kranz H. Beck K.-F. Schweizer M. Gene ( Amst. ). 1994; 144: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). For heat treatment, FAS-induced rat liver extract was incubated for 5 min at 80 °C before proceeding with the gel mobility shift analysis. Recombinant human Sp1 prepared fromEscherichia coli was purchased from Promega. 1 μg of specific anti-rat C/EBα, C/EBPβ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), NF-YA, or NF-YB antiserum was preincubated with 5 μg of nuclear extract for 15 min at room temperature before analysis of DNA/protein binding in the standard binding assay. A 6-fold scale-up of the standard gel mobility shift reaction was allowed to come to equilibrium. A 1000-fold molar excess of competitor in a volume of 4% of the binding reaction was added and aliquots of the binding reactions were loaded onto a continuously electrophoresing gel (electrophoresis buffer: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 375 mm glycine, 2 mm EDTA) at 0, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 min after the addition of the competitor. To determine the half-life of the NF-Y·Sp1 complex the FIRE1/C box oligonucleotide was used and the FIRE1·NF-Y·Sp1 complexes were obtained using FIRE1 and C box oligonucleotides, respectively. Half-lives of the complexes were determined from a plot of the fraction of total probe in the specific complex at times during the competition divided by the fraction of total probe in the specific complex at time 0 min versus time. Complexes were quantified by PhosporImager analysis. The FAS promoter fragment between −451 and −566 was cloned into theHindIII/BamHI-restricted pBluescript SK(+) (Stratagene) to create pBS(−566/−451). Restriction of this plasmid with ApaI and XbaI releases the promoter fragment to be investigated. The sense strand was labeled by filling in theXbaI site using Klenow fragment in the presence of [α-32P]dATP, and the antisense strand released from pBS(−566/−451) as a SalI/SacI fragment was end-labeled at the SalI site. Labeled DNA (∼20,000 cpm) was incubated for 30 min with 2 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) and 60 μg of nuclear protein extract of induced rat liver (6Roder K. Klein H. Kranz H. Beck K.-F. Schweizer M. Gene ( Amst. ). 1994; 144: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) in a final volume of 40 μl (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 25 mmNaCl, 1.25 mm MgCl2, 0.62 mmCaCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 7 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol). For competition experiments oligonucleotide competitors (100-fold molar excess) were included in the binding reaction. To determine the optimal conditions a titration was performed for each probe using increasing concentrations of DNase I for the same amount of nuclear extract. 5–10 milliunits of DNase I in DNase I buffer (1 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 20 mm KCl) were added, and following a 2-min incubation at room temperature the reaction was terminated by the addition of 160 μl of DNase I stop buffer (200 mm NaCl, 30 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, 100 μg/ml tRNA) and 2 μl of proteinase K (25 μg/μl). After a 30-min incubation at 42 °C reactions were extracted twice with phenol/chloroform/isoamylalcohol and ethanol-precipitated before analysis on a 5% polyacrylamide, 7m urea sequencing gel. After linearization at the XbaI site 3′ to the inserted cDNA pGEM-NF-YA (NF-YA) and pCiteCBF-C (CBF-C) or at the BglII site in pYB-EM38 (NF-YB) the plasmids were transcribed and translated in vitro as described in Roder et al. (32Roder K. Wolf S.S. Beck K.-F. Sickinger S. Schweizer M. Gene ( Amst. ). 1997; 184: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To examine the protein binding properties around the diet-induced DNase I-hypersensitive site at −500 of the FAS promoter, a restriction fragment extending from −451 to −566 was subjected to in vitro DNase I footprint analysis. Suitably labeled probes were incubated with a nuclear extract prepared from the livers of rats fed a FAS-induction diet (4Laux T. Schweizer M. Biochem. J. 1990; 266: 793-797PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 A, there are four protected areas on the sense strand designated A, B,C, and FIRE1. The FIRE1 footprint on the sense strand extends from −498 to −514 and on the antisense strand from −501 to −516. Competition studies with FIRE1 confirm the footprint (Fig. 1 B). Of the remaining three protected regions B and C flank FIRE1 and the A box is located upstream of the B box. The protected region in A extends from −536 to −-564 and in B from −520 to −534 on the sense strand. Identical footprints were obtained when the analysis was performed using nuclear extracts prepared from the livers of rats fed a normal diet or starved (data not shown). Since the FAS promoter has been shown to have a high GC content (17Beck K.-F. Schreglmann R. Stathopulos I. Klein H. Hoch J. Schweizer M. Journal of DNA Sequencing and Mapping. 1992; 2: 359-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), 67% in this region, the presence of binding sites for the general transcription factor Sp1 (33Dynan W.S. Tjian R. Cell. 1983; 35: 79-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar) are to be expected. The C box extending from −470 to −489 on the antisense and −488 to −468 on the sense strand is indeed the result of Sp1 binding (Fig. 1 B), since the footprint is abolished when an oligonucleotide representing the Sp1 consensus sequence is included in the assay. Furthermore, the addition of the Sp1 oligonucleotide to the binding assay also removes the FIRE1 footprint, suggesting cooperativity between Sp1 bound to the C box and any protein(s) binding to FIRE1. The proteins binding to the A, B, and C boxes have been identified by gel mobility shift assays. Enhancement of protein binding to the A and C boxes was observed following the addition of Zn2+ to the assay (data not shown). With recombinant Sp1 we have confirmed that Sp1 binds to the C box and does so strongly, since a 30-fold molar excess of an oligonucleotide corresponding to the C box abolishes binding. On the other hand, the affinity of the A box for Sp1 is lower, since a 300-fold molar excess of an oligonucleotide corresponding to the A region is required to abolish binding (data not shown). These differences in binding to the Sp1 consensus sequence of the A and C boxes can probably be explained by the number of mismatches to the Sp1 consensus sequence; viz. 1/9 for the C box and 2/9 for the A box. From preliminary studies we know that the B box does not bind Sp1. Therefore, we tested cognate oligonucleotides for C/EBP, CREB, Sp1, AP-1, AP-2, and MTLF-1 (27Faisst S. Meyer S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar) DNA binding sites as competitors for B box binding in gel mobility shift assays. Upon incubation with nuclear extracts from H4IIE, the B box represented by the oligonucleotide extending from −534 to −504 of the FAS promoter gives rise to two DNA·protein complexes. In all but two instances the complexes remained unchanged. The exceptions were the oligonucleotides corresponding to CTF/NF-1 (34Santoro C. Mermod N. Andrews P.C. Tjian R. Nature. 1988; 334: 218-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar) and the B box itself. The NF-1 oligonucleotide competed out the lower migrating complex B2 suggesting an implication of CTF/NF-1 or related factor together with one or more unknown proteins responsible for the B box binding characteristics (Fig. 2). Indeed the core B box shows a 6/9 match with the CTF/NF-1 (34Santoro C. Mermod N. Andrews P.C. Tjian R. Nature. 1988; 334: 218-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar) consensus sequence 5′-(T/C)GG(A/C)N5–6GCCAA-3′ (27Faisst S. Meyer S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). The relative contribution of Sp1 binding at the A and C boxes of the FAS promoter has been demonstrated in the Schneider cell line derived from D. melanogaster embryos. Tandem copies of the A and C boxes were placed in front of the FAS minimal promoter linked to the firefly luciferase gene. When these plasmids were co-transfected with an expression plasmid for Sp1, a 4.5-fold increase in luciferase activity was observed with the plasmid C, whereas a 2.5-fold effect was found with plasmid A (Fig. 3). Initially, we tested the binding capacity of the FIRE1 oligonucleotide with nuclear extracts derived from different cell lines and nuclear extracts prepared from the livers of rats corresponding to the three dietary regimes, FAS-induced, normal, and starved (4Laux T. Schweizer M. Biochem. J. 1990; 266: 793-797PubMed Google Scholar). In all instances a single retarded band migrating at about the same position was obtained and provides the first evidence that the FIRE1-binding protein is found in several different cell types and is independent of dietary status (Fig. 4 A). A signal with the same mobility could be detected using nuclear extract from differentiated mouse 3T3-L1 adipocytes (data not shown). We know from sequence comparisons of FIRE1, FIRE2 (6Roder K. Klein H. Kranz H. Beck K.-F. Schweizer M. Gene ( Amst. ). 1994; 144: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and FIRE3 (8Wolf S.S. Hofer G. Beck K.-F. Roder K. Schweizer M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 943-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) (FAS-IRS-A (9Moustaı̈d N. Beyer R.S. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5629-5634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) in the promoter of the rat FAS and IRE-A in the promoter of the human GAPDH gene (7Nasrin N. Ercolani L. Denaro M. Kong X.F. Kang I. Alexander M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5273-5277Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) that they have in common a sequence-independent, tripartite structure consisting of a GCCN motif, a spacer, and a 3′-palindrome. The 3′-palindrome of FIRE1 harbors the E-box hexanucleotide CANNTG (35Church G.M. Ephrussi A. Gilbert W. Tonegawa S. Nature. 1985; 313: 798-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) capable of binding proteins containing the basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper motif. This hexanucleotide overlaps with four nucleotides of the pentanucleotide CCAAT found in several promoters and enhancers (36Myers R.M. Tilly K. Mani"
https://openalex.org/W2022446111,"tat, an essential gene of human immunodeficiency virus, when placed under the control of the RNA polymerase III promoter from the adenovirus VA RNA1 gene, is transcribed into an uncapped and nonpolyadenylated mRNA. This VA-Tat RNA is translated to produce functional Tat protein in transfected mammalian cells (Gunnery, S., and Mathews, M. B. (1995) Mol. Cell. Biol. 15, 3597–3607). The presence of an upstream open reading frame (ORF) in VA-Tat RNA is inhibitory to the translation of the Tat ORF, suggesting that the RNA is scanned during translation even though it is uncapped. Because the effect of the upstream ORF is relatively small (about 2-fold), we sought more definitive evidence of scanning by introducing secondary structures of varying stabilities into the 5′-untranslated region of VA-Tat RNA. The results of transfection experiments showed that highly stable secondary structure was inhibitory to Tat synthesis, whereas structures of lower stability were not inhibitory, confirming that uncapped mRNA is subject to scanning. Furthermore, translation of the downstream ORF was reduced but not eliminated by mutations that caused the upstream ORF to overlap the Tat ORF. Extending the overlap of the two ORFs further decreased the translation of the downstream ORF. This observation implies that ribosomes reinitiate after termination, possibly after migrating in a 3′ to 5′ direction through the overlap region of the mRNA. Similar results were obtained with a capped polymerase II transcript, indicating that the translation of polymerase II and polymerase III transcripts occurs through similar mechanisms. tat, an essential gene of human immunodeficiency virus, when placed under the control of the RNA polymerase III promoter from the adenovirus VA RNA1 gene, is transcribed into an uncapped and nonpolyadenylated mRNA.

Similar results were obtained with a capped polymerase II transcript, indicating that the translation of polymerase II and polymerase III transcripts occurs through similar mechanisms. All known eukaryotic cellular mRNAs are capped, and most of them are functionally monocistronic with initiation of translation taking place at the 5′ proximal AUG codon. These features are consistent with the scanning model of translational initiation (1Kozak M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5134-5142Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). According to this model, cap-binding initiation factors bind to the 5′ cap structure of the mRNA and facilitate assembly of the 40 S initiation complex. The complex then migrates along the 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR) 1The abbreviations used are: 5′-UTR, 5′-untranslated region; ORF, open reading frame; pol, polymerase; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; sl, stem and loop; nt, nucleotide(s); S, stop codon; LTR, long terminal repeat; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; CMV, cytomegalovirus. of the RNA until it encounters the first initiation codon, AUG, present in a favorable sequence context, whereupon it binds the 60 S ribosomal subunit to complete the 80 S initiation complex (1Kozak M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5134-5142Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Translation then proceeds into the elongation phase. A recent reinterpretation of the findings proposes that an initiation factor complex, rather than the 40 S ribosomal subunit, scans the 5′-UTR, causing unwinding of the RNA, which then facilitates ribosome binding (2Sonenberg N. Gene Expr. 1993; 3: 317-323PubMed Google Scholar). According to this alternative model, the complex can bind randomly along the RNA but binds to the 5′ cap most efficiently (3Jackson R.J. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 71-112Google Scholar). Exceptions to the “first AUG” rule were initially attributed to leaky scanning, but it is now clear that internal initiation and reinitiation can occur. Picornaviral RNAs and some cellular mRNAs contain long 5′-UTRs with several AUGs upstream of the authentic initiator codon. These RNAs are also furnished with an internal ribosome entry site that allows ribosomes to bind internally (3Jackson R.J. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 71-112Google Scholar). The internal ribosome entry site element confers cap-independent translation upon the mRNA and plays a role comparable to that of the cap structure in binding the 40 S ribosomal subunit to the mRNA for translation. The translation of mRNAs containing upstream open reading frames (ORFs) has been thoroughly studied in the yeast GCN4 gene (4Hinnebusch A.G. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 199-244Google Scholar). In this case, it has been proposed that the ribosome, after translating an upstream ORF, may retain competence to reinitiate at the downstream ORF. The efficiency of mRNA translation is dependent on several features including the local sequence context surrounding the initiation codon (5Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 47: 481-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). In accordance with the scanning model, very stable secondary structures in the 5′-UTR are inhibitory to translation, presumably because they obstruct the movement of the scanning moiety along the 5′-UTR (5Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 47: 481-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Structures of low stability are apparently readily penetrated and do not have any effect on the translation of the mRNA. On the other hand, a stable structure in the coding region does not inhibit the progress of elongating 80 S ribosomes (1Kozak M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5134-5142Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). The presence of an upstream ORF in its 5′-UTR is another feature that can also affect the translational efficiency of the main open reading frame of an mRNA (6Geballe A.P. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 173-198Google Scholar). In conformity with the scanning model, the upstream ORF generally exerts a negative effect on the translation of a downstream ORF. Reinitiation at the downstream ORF after translation of the upstream ORF has also been observed (7Kozak M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3438-3445Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 8Grant C.M. Miller P.F. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2616-2628Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In instances where the two ORFs overlap, it has been proposed that ribosomes terminate at the end of the upstream ORF then migrate backward to the initiation codon of the downstream ORF where they reinitiate (9Johansen H. Schumperli D. Rosengerg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1984; 81: 7698-7702Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 10Peabody D.S. Berg P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 2695-2703Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 11Thomas K.R. Capecchi M.R. Nature. 1986; 324: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). This 3′ to 5′ movement, here called “backscanning,” may not be universal, since translation of some downstream ORFs is abolished by the introduction of an overlapping upstream ORF (12Kozak M. Gene Expr. 1990; 1: 111-115Google Scholar, 13Michelet B. Lukaszeqicz M. Dupriez V. Bounty M. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1375-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 14Cao J. Geballe A.P. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1030-1036Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An alternative explanation for this phenomenon is that ribosomes paused at the termination codon of the upstream ORF may slow the progress of following ribosomes that have bypassed the upstream AUG, thereby facilitating their initiation at the downstream AUG. Recently, we reported the translation in vivo of an RNA polymerase III (pol III) product that is an uncapped and nonpolyadenylated mRNA (15Gunnery S. Mathews M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3597-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To generate this RNA, we placed the human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) Tat protein ORF under the control of the adenovirus VA RNA1 gene promoter, a strong pol III promoter. The resultant construct, pVA-Tat, synthesizes VA-Tat RNA that is transported into the cytoplasm and recruited for translation, resulting in the production of functional Tat protein in transfected cells. The translation of the pol III transcript is inefficient compared with that of a Tat transcript synthesized by pol II, which is capped and presumably polyadenylated. These findings indicate that neither the cap structure at the 5′ end nor the poly(A) tail at the 3′ end of an mRNA is essential for translation, although these features may be stimulatory. To gain insight into the mechanism of translation of an uncapped mRNA, we examined the effects of alterations in the structure of VA-Tat RNA. VA-Tat RNA contains a short upstream ORF that is out-of-frame with the downstream Tat ORF. Incapacitation of the upstream ORF resulted in a small increase in translation of the downstream Tat ORF, raising the possibility that the RNA is scanned (15Gunnery S. Mathews M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3597-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). As a critical test of this inference, we inserted secondary structures into the 5′-UTR of VA-Tat RNA and also made point mutations that caused the two ORFs to overlap. The results of transient expression assays confirm that the RNA is scanned for translational initiation despite being uncapped. Furthermore, the data are suggestive of reinitiation at the downstream AUG after termination of translation of the upstream ORF, possibly implying that ribosomes can backscan over the short distance of the overlap sequence. ABamHI restriction enzyme site was created at +72 of pVA-Tat by site-directed mutagenesis to produce pVT.Bam. For the construction of pVT.sl.60 and pVT.60, two oligonucleotides were synthesized, one identical to and another complementary to the sequence between nt +76 and +112 of pVA-Tat (AGCTTCGACATAGCAGAATAGGCGTTACTCGACAGAG). Both oligonucleotides carried four extra nucleotides at the 5′ end (GATC) such that they formed cohesive ends compatible with theBamHI restriction site. The two oligonucleotides were annealed and ligated with pVT.Bam linearized with BamHI, giving plasmids pVT.sl.60 and pVT.60, which have the insert in the antisense or sense orientation, respectively, with regard to the sequence in pVA-Tat. pVT.sl.30 and pVT.30 were similarly constructed using oligonucleotides that correspond to nt +76 to +97 of pVA-Tat. The upstream ORF was incapacitated in all these constructs by mutating the upstream AUG (nt +44 to +46) to GCG. pVA-Tat contains termination codons in-frame with the upstream AUG (Fig. 2,S1–S6). By site-directed mutagenesis (16), these were mutated in plasmids pVT.S1, pVT.S1–3, and pVT.S1–5. A control plasmid transcribed by pol II, pCMV-VT, was constructed by inserting theBglII-AflIII fragment from pVA-Tat.A (15Gunnery S. Mathews M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3597-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) between the HindIII and AflIII sites of pCMV-Tat (17Cullen B.R. Cell. 1986; 46: 973-982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar) using conventional recombinant DNA techniques (18Sambrook J. Fritch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). It contains nt +15 to +75 of the adenovirus VA RNA gene sequence inserted upstream of the Tat sequence in pCMV-Tat. The termination codon mutations described above were also introduced into pCMV-VT by site-directed mutagenesis (16). Transactivation of the HIV-1 LTR by Tat was assayed as described previously (15Gunnery S. Mathews M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3597-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly, HeLa cells were transfected with pHIV-CAT alone or together with Tat constructs (pVA-Tat, pCMV-Tat, pCMV-VA-Tat, or mutants thereof) using the calcium phosphate transfection protocol. CAT activity was measured in lysates prepared at 48 h post-transfection. Northern blot analysis was used to monitor VA-Tat RNA levels and was performed as described previously (15Gunnery S. Mathews M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3597-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) using a probe that is complementary to the 5′ end sequence of VA RNA. HeLa cell nuclear extract was prepared according to the Dignam protocol (19Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Reoder R.G. Nucleic Acid Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar) and used to transcribe linearized plasmids as described by Laspia et al. (20Laspia M.F. Wendel P. Mathews M.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 732-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We showed previously that an RNA polymerase III product that is uncapped and nonpolyadenylated can serve as an effective mRNA in mammalian cells (15Gunnery S. Mathews M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3597-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The HIV-1 Tat protein ORF was placed under the control of the strong pol III promoter from the adenovirus VA RNA1 gene to construct pVA-Tat. In transfected HeLa cells, pVA-Tat is transcribed to produce VA-Tat RNA, which is transported into the cytoplasm and recruited for translation by ribosomes, resulting in the production of functional Tat protein. This indicated that neither the cap structure at the 5′ end nor the poly(A) tail at the 3′ end of an mRNA is essential for translation. The VA-Tat transcript is 368 nt long and contains two out-of-frame ORFs: the first ORF is 45 nt long and lies between nucleotides 44 and 88, whereas the second, which encodes Tat, lies between nucleotides 124 and 339 and is 216 nt long. The two ORFs are separated by 37 nt, and both have start codons in good sequence contexts for translational initiation (AUCAUGGCG and GAAAUGGAG, respectively). Mutation of the upstream AUG to GCG (in construct pVA-Tat.I), effectively eliminating the upstream ORF, increases synthesis of Tat from the downstream ORF by about 2-fold (15Gunnery S. Mathews M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3597-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This inhibitory effect of the upstream AUG raised the possibility that the RNA is scanned. To examine this possibility, we investigated the effect of introducing secondary structure into the 5′-UTR of VA-Tat.I RNA. Stable secondary structure in the 5′-UTR is envisaged to obstruct the movement of ribosomes or other moieties that are scanning the RNA from the 5′ end, preventing their access to the start codon. Therefore, the inhibitory effect of secondary structure in the 5′-UTR on the translation of an mRNA provides evidence for scanning (1Kozak M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5134-5142Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). To create secondary structure in the 5′-UTR of VA-Tat.I RNA, a stretch of sequence from the 5′-UTR was duplicated in an inverted orientation such that the pairing of the two sequences forms a stem structure topped by a 4-nt loop (Fig. 1 A). The plasmid pVT.sl.30 contained 22 nt (nt +76 to +97 with respect to the transcription start site) inserted at +76, and pVT.sl.60 contained 37 nt (+76 to +112) inserted at the same position. The predicted stability of the stem and loop structures in VT.sl.30 RNA and VT.sl.60 RNA was −31 and −60.5 kcals, respectively. Two control plasmids, pVT.30 and pVT.60, were also constructed that contained the equivalent sequences inserted in the sense orientation; transcripts of these plasmids were not predicted to form stable secondary structures in the 5′-UTR. The translational activities of these transcripts were tested in an HIV-LTR transactivation assay, which takes advantage of the fact that HIV-1 Tat protein stimulates transcription from the HIV-LTR (21Peterlin B.M. Adams M. Alonso A Baur A. Ghosh S. Lu X. Luo Y. Cullen B.R. Human Retroviruses. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 75-100Google Scholar). pVA-Tat or derivatives thereof were transfected with the reporter construct pHIV-CAT, which contains the HIV-LTR driving the CAT reporter gene. The expression of Tat protein was monitored by measuring the increase in CAT activity in cells cotransfected with Tat-producing plasmids as compared with basal CAT activity in cells transfected with pHIV-CAT alone. Fig. 1 B shows the results of such an assay performed using the stem and loop insertion mutants of pVA-Tat. Cells transfected with parental pVA-Tat.I produced 20–60-fold higher levels of CAT enzyme activity than cells transfected with pHIV-CAT only. For purposes of comparison, the level of transactivation given by the parental Tat plasmid was assigned a value of 100. Cells transfected with control constructs (pVT.30 and pVT.60) that were not predicted to contain secondary structure in their 5′-UTR produced levels of CAT activity about 20% lower than that of pVA-Tat.I. The increased length of the 5′-UTR probably accounts for this small decrease in activity. Cells transfected with pVT.sl.30 exhibited similar CAT enzyme activity, whereas transactivation by pVT.sl.60, which encodes a structure of higher stability (ΔG = −60.5 kcal/mol), was 5-fold lower than that given by the parental plasmid. Northern blot analysis using a probe complementary to the 5′ end of VA RNA verified that similar levels of RNA were produced by pVA-Tat.I, pVT30, and pVT60, but pVTsl30 and pVTsl60 transcripts were not detected (data not shown), presumably because their secondary structures interfere. It is unlikely that these transcripts are degraded, however, because secondary structure generally increases RNA stability, and pVTsl30 expresses nearly as much transactivation activity as the parent plasmid, pVA-Tat.I. These results resemble those reported for a preproinsulin mRNA that is transcribed by pol II (1Kozak M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5134-5142Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar), indicating that VA-Tat RNA is indeed scanned during translation despite its uncapped status. The scanning mechanism seems able to unwind secondary structures of low stability (ΔG = −30 kcal/mol) but is blocked by more stable structures (ΔG = −60 kcal/mol) in an uncapped mRNA as in capped mRNA (1Kozak M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5134-5142Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the decrease in activity accompanying the increased length of the 5′-UTR in VT.30 and VT.60 and VT.sl.30 is similar to that observed for capped mRNAs and is consistent with ribosome scanning. Our results indicate that the scanning process does not require the 5′ cap structure, but they do not necessarily exclude a role for the cap-binding initiation factor, eIF4F, and associated factors. Conceivably, such factors are recruited by uncapped mRNA, albeit inefficiently, by a cap-independent mechanism. Given that VA-Tat RNA is scanned, it is not surprising that mutation of the termination codon of the upstream ORF of VA-Tat RNA, causing the two ORFs to overlap by 10 nt, leads to a decrease in transactivation activity (Ref. 15Gunnery S. Mathews M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3597-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar; Fig. 2 B). The magnitude of the decrease (about 2-fold) is relatively slight, however, prompting us to consider possible explanations for the small effect. First, the start codon of upstream ORF may be leaky,i.e. not recognized by ribosomes despite its good context, so the ribosomes proceed to scan to the Tat AUG. Second, as VA-Tat RNA lacks a cap structure at its 5′ end, ribosomes might bind to VA-Tat RNA randomly and then commence scanning; those ribosomes binding between the two AUGs should not be affected by the overlap of the two ORFs. Third, ribosomes might reinitiate after translating the upstream ORF, an exercise that would seem to require 3′ to 5′ ribosome movement (backscanning) across the overlap region. Backscanning has been observed over a span of 80–90 nt (10Peabody D.S. Berg P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 2695-2703Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), but an overlap of 92 nt was resistant to backscanning (9Johansen H. Schumperli D. Rosengerg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1984; 81: 7698-7702Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To distinguish among the three possibilities with regard to VA-Tat RNA translation, we studied the effect of increasing the extent of the overlap of the two ORFs to more than 100 nt. If either of the first two explanations pertains, increasing the overlap would not be expected to affect the translation of the Tat ORF. On the other hand, if the Tat ORF is translated by reinitiation after backscanning, an increase in the length of the overlap would be expected to decrease Tat ORF translation, since backscanning is observed only over short distances. We exploited the six termination codons present in-frame with the upstream AUG of VA-Tat RNA (Fig. 2 A, S1–S6) to extend the overlap. By site-directed mutagenesis, the in-frame stop codons were eliminated sequentially without altering the amino acids encoded by the Tat ORF. The resultant plasmids, pVA-Tat.S1, S1–3, and S1–5, contained mutations in the first stop codon, in the first three stop codons, and in the first five stop codons, respectively, yielding overlaps between the two ORFs of 10, 115, and 220 nt (Fig. 2 A). The mutants were then tested in the HIV-CAT transactivation assay, giving results shown in Fig. 2 B. Northern blot analysis indicated that similar levels of RNA were generated by the mutant and parental plasmids (data not shown). All constructs with overlapping ORFs produced decreased CAT activity compared with the wild type pVA-Tat construct, and extending the overlap from 10 to 115, or 220 nt, caused a decrease in translation of the downstream ORF. pVT.S1, which contains an overlap of 10 nt, was about 50% as active as wild type pVA-Tat, whereas pVT.S1–3 and pVT.S1–5, which have overlaps of 115 and 220 nt, respectively, both produced only about 20% of wild type activity. These results imply that Tat activity from RNA containing the S1 mutation only (10-nt overlap) may be partially accounted for by reinitiation requiring backscanning. Since increasing the overlap from 115 to 220 nt gave no further decrease in Tat activity, the Tat activity produced by these constructs may be due to leaky scanning. In other words, it seems that only 20% of the ribosomes scanning VA-Tat RNA failed to recognize the first AUG, and of those that do initiate translation at the upstream AUG, about 40% are able to backscan after translating the upstream ORF and reinitiate at the Tat ORF. To test the effect of the overlaps on the translation of RNA generated by pol II, the same mutations were introduced into pCMV-VT that contained the CMV immediate early promoter, driving transcription of the VA-Tat sequence (Fig. 3 A). The construct contains a polyadenylation signal downstream of the Tat sequence to ensure proper termination and processing of the pol II transcript, and the first 11 nt of VA-Tat sequence were deleted so as to remove the A box of the VA RNA gene promoter and impair pol III transcription. To verify that transcription of this plasmid was indeed dependent on pol II, its sensitivity toward α-amanitin was tested in a transcription assay in vitro (Fig. 3 B). The plasmid was cut at +189 nt (with respect to the CMV transcription start site) with MfeI, and run-off transcription was performed in HeLa cell nuclear extract in the presence and absence of α-amanitin. Fig. 3 B shows that transcription from pCMV-VT, like that from pCMV-Tat which also contains a pol II promoter (17Cullen B.R. Cell. 1986; 46: 973-982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar), was eliminated by 5 μg/ml α-amanitin, whereas transcription from pVA-Tat containing pol III promoter was not. Thus transcription of pCMV-VT is dependent on the pol II promoter as a result of the deletion in its VA RNA gene promoter. In the transactivation assay (Fig. 3 C), overlap of the ORFs by 10 nt (S1) caused a decrease in translation of the downstream Tat ORF of CMV-Tat by about 40%, and increasing the length of the overlap (S1–3 and S1–5) caused a further decrease in expression. The additional decrease was small, however, possibly indicating that backscanning can occur over longer distances in the case of capped pol II transcripts than in the uncapped pol III transcripts. Mutation of the upstream AUG, which eliminates the upstream ORF, abolished the inhibition of Tat ORF translation in these stop codon mutants as expected (Fig. 3 D), verifying that the effect of the stop codon mutations on Tat ORF translation is dependent on the integrity of the upstream ORF. We also tested the effects of overlapping ORFs in a wheat germ cell-free translation system using both capped and uncapped mRNAs synthesized in vitro. As observed in vivo, the overlap of the two ORFs was inhibitory to translation of the downstream Tat ORF. In RNAs that contained long overlaps of the two ORFs, the translation product from the downstream ORF was reduced significantly (data not shown). Similar results were obtained with both capped and uncapped RNA, confirming that capped RNA and uncapped RNA are translated by similar mechanisms that allow backscanning. The 7-methyl guanosine cap structure that characterizes the 5′ end of eukaryotic mRNAs has a role in their stability, processing, and transport into the cytoplasm. It also enhances the efficiency with which mRNA binds initiation factor eIF4F (22Fletcher L. Corbin S.D. Browning K.S. Ravel J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19582-19587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This factor being limiting in most eukaryotic cells, capped mRNA has a clear advantage for translation initiation (22Fletcher L. Corbin S.D. Browning K.S. Ravel J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19582-19587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Gallie D.R. Walbot V. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1149-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 24Timmer R.T.

In this paper we assessed the significance of cap for the mechanism of translational initiation. We found that capped and uncapped mRNA are translated by similar mechanisms although with very different efficiencies. 2S. Gunnery and M. B. Mathews, unpublished data. Both were scanned from the 5′ end of the RNA, indicating that the process of scanning does not require the cap. In addition, both allowed translation to initiate at a downstream ORF after the translation of an upstream ORF. When the two ORFs overlap, reinitiation appears to involve movement of the ribosomes in a backward direction along both capped and uncapped mRNA. We therefore concluded that the mRNA cap is not an essential feature of the translation initiation mechanism, although it is possibly required for efficient translation by virtue of recruiting eIF4F. Eukaryotic cellular mRNA is believed to be synthesized exclusively by RNA polymerase II, but the mammalian cell is capable of utilizing an RNA pol III transcript as an mRNA to produce functional protein (15Gunnery S. Mathews M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3597-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Although pol III genes are transcribed with great efficiency, the translational efficiency of the resultant RNAs is very low due to the absence of the 5′ cap. Therefore it seems likely that one of the reasons why pol III genes have not been shown to code for proteins is the lack of the cap on their transcripts. Mechanisms such as trans-splicing and “cap-snatching” are used by trypanosomes (25Janz L. Clayton C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5804-5811Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and influenza virus (26Plotch S.J. Bouloy M. Ulmanen I. Krug R.M. Cell. 1981; 23: 847-858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar) to cap mRNAs that are transcribed by polymerases other than pol II (pol I and viral polymerase, respectively). It remains to be seen whether a comparable mechanism for capping of uncapped cellular RNA exists and allows the efficient translation of pol III transcripts.

https://openalex.org/W2321776541,"Human monocytic leukemia U937 cells readily undergo apoptosis when they are treated with TNF-alpha, anti-Fas antibody and anticancer drugs such as etoposide and Ara-C. To study the mechanism of apoptosis, we developed a novel apoptosis-resistant variant, UC, from U937 cells. The UC cells showed resistance to apoptosis induced by TNF-alpha, anti-Fas antibody, etoposide and Ara-C. Somatic cell hybridization between U937 and UC showed that apoptosis-resistance to TNF-alpha in UC was genetically recessive and resistance to etoposide was dominant, suggesting that UC has at least two different mutations functionally involved in apoptosis. Mechanistic analysis revealed that UC cells expressed reduced amounts of c-Myc. Transfection of the c-myc gene into UC cells restored the sensitivity of the cells to undergo apoptosis induced by TNF-alpha and anti-Fas, which attributes apoptosis-resistance in this circumstance to the reduced expression of c-Myc. On the other hand, c-myc transfection into UC cells could not restore their sensitivity to etoposide- and Ara-C-induced apoptosis, arguing against the role of c-myc in chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. However, treating the parental U937 cells with antisense oligonucleotides designed to reduce c-Myc expression rendered the cells resistant to etoposide-induced as well as to TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis. These results indicate that the reduced expression of c-Myc in UC is strongly associated with the resistance to etoposide-induced apoptosis. Our finding that c-myc transfection into UC could not restore the sensitivity to etoposide-induced apoptosis, suggests UC could have a second mutation that confers resistance to etoposide-induced apoptosis in a genetically dominant manner. Taken together, our present results indicate that c-Myc plays a role in cellular susceptibility to death receptor-mediated and chemotherapy-induced apoptosis."

Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 310-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), the pathway for import of proteins with basic-type NLSs begins in the cytoplasm, where the α subunit of the receptor binds to the NLS of a protein destined for import. This complex then binds to the cytoplasmic surface of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) via the β subunit, an event that is referred to as the initial binding or docking step of transport. Subsequently, the substrate-receptor complex is delivered to the central channel of the NPC and then translocated into the nucleoplasm (events collectively referred to as the translocation step; Ref. 13Panté N.

J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 589-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). It has become clear that elucidating the mechanism of nuclear protein import will require understanding how the cytosolic transport factors interact with each other and with the NPC at specific transport steps and how these interactions are coupled to the GTPase cycle of Ran/TC4 (1Görlich D. Mattaj I. Science. 1996; 271: 1513-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar, 12Melchior F. Gerace L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 310-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The mechanisms of nuclear protein import are predicted to be conserved between vertebrates and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Basic-type NLSs within proteins such as the glucocorticoid receptor and the SV40 large T antigen are fully functional in yeast, and the primary structures of the cytosolic transport factors show 40–80% identity when human and yeast proteins are compared. The basic architecture of the NPC appears to be conserved as well (22Panté N. Aebi U. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1995; 162: 225-255Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We have, therefore, used a molecular genetic approach to characterize NTF2 in the budding yeastS. cerevisiae. We have found that the scNTF2 gene is required for viability and that depletion of scNTF2p leads to nuclear structure defects similar to those observed with mutants of certain nuclear pore complex proteins. We carried out a genetic selection for multicopy suppressors that would compensate for loss of scNTF2p. This analysis revealed that the S. cerevisiaehomologue of Ran/TC4 is a multicopy suppressor of a scNTF2deletion strain, thus providing the first in vivo evidence that certain functions of NTF2 and Ran/TC4 are linked. Furthermore, we have used recombinant proteins to show that Ran/TC4 can relieve the requirement for NTF2 in a permeabilized cell import assay in mammalian cells. Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that NTF2 serves to modulate a transport step(s) involving Ran/TC4. To generate the plasmid used for methionine-regulated expression of scNTF2p, the scNTF2 ORF was amplified by PCR and cloned into the unique BamHI site immediately downstream of the MET3 promoter in the plasmid pRS405-MET3 (generously provided by Drs. Steve Haase and Steve Reed, The Scripps Research Institute). The MET3-scNTF2 fragment was then removed by digestion with NotI andHindIII and cloned into pRS315 (23Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to generateLEU2-marked construct pMET-scNTF2. The plasmid for galactose-regulated expression of scNTF2 was constructed by PCR amplification of the scNTF2 ORF and subsequent cloning into the unique EcoRI site of yCPG2 (provided by Drs. Steve Haase and S. Reed). All yeast strains used in this study are derivatives of the homozygous diploid strain 15D (MATa/MATα, ura3/ura3, leu2/leu2, trp1/trp1, his2/his2, ade1/ade1, provided by Drs. Steve Haase and Steve Reed). A single copy of thescNTF2 locus was disrupted in 15D via a PCR-based method to generate BPY1 (scNTF2/ΔscNTF2:: URA3) and BPY3 (scNTF2/ΔscNTF2::TRP1). Specifically, to generate BPY1, PCR was used to generate a URA3 fragment flanked by sequences homologous to flanking regions of thescNTF2 gene such that upon integration, the entire ORF ofscNTF2 would be deleted. The oligos used were 5′-TAAGGAACCCAGGTTTTAATACTATTATCTTTATAATGGCTTTTCAATTCAATCATC-3′ and 5′-AAATACATGTTTCTGTGGTGACTTAAAAAATCCTTAAGCAGATTCCCGGGTAATAACTG-3′. After PCR amplification, the fragment was gel-purified and used to transform the diploid strain 15D to Ura+. To confirm correct integration of the construct at the scNTF2 locus, whole cell PCR was performed with flanking primers (primer 1 = 5′-CAAGGTGAGACTTAGGCTGATAAG-3′, primer 2 = 5′-GCCTTATACATCGTTAGCTAAGC-3′) or one flanking primer (primer 1) and one URA3-internal primer, primer 3 = 5′-GCTGACATTGGTAATACAGTC-3′). Isolates in which both PCR reactions produced fragments of the size expected for integration atscNTF2 were judged to be deletion isolates. The same method was applied to replace the scNTF2 ORF with TRP1in BPY3. The primers used to generate the PCR product forTRP1 integration into the scNTF2 locus were 5′-CCTAAGGAACCCAGGTTTTAATACTATTATCTTTATAATGGGCATTGGTGACTATTGAGC-3′ and 5′-AAATACATGTTTCTGTGGTGACTTAAAAAATCCTTAAGCAGGCAAGTGCACAAACAATAC-3′. Strain BPY4 (ΔscNTF2::TRP1containing pMET3-scNTF2) was generated by transforming BPY3 with the pMET3-scNTF2 plasmid followed by sporulation and dissection to yield a Leu+, Trp+ haploid. The mating type of this strain was not determined. A similar procedure was used to generate a ΔscNTF2 haploid carrying the plasmid pGAL10-scNTF2. Propagation of yeast strains was performed using standard media recipes as described in Ref. 24. The screen for multicopy suppressors was carried out in the strain BPY4. Log phase yeast cells were transformed by using polyethylene glycol and lithium acetate (25Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Willems A.R. Woods R.A. Yeast. 1995; 11: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1667) Google Scholar) with a S. cerevisiae genomic library constructed in YEp24 (26Carlson M. Botstein D. Cell. 1982; 28: 145-154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar) and plated onto synthetic medium containing 5 mm methionine and lacking uracil. We plated 1% of the transformation onto media lacking methionine and determined that this procedure yielded a total of ∼108 Ura+ transformants. The 480 Ura+ colonies that grew under the condition of scNTF2p repression were replated onto methionine-containing media. Whole cell PCR was used to screen the 480 colonies for the presence of the library plasmids that contained the scNTF2 gene. Log phase yeast cells were harvested up to 7 h after the addition of methionine and processed for electron microscopy essentially as described by Byers and Goetsch (27Byers B. Goetsch L. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 602-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We used both Spurr and Epon resins, the latter of which yielded slightly better preservation of membranes in our experiments. The permeabilized cell assay used to quantitate nuclear protein import in HeLa cells was described previously (10Paschal B.M. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 925-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The reporter molecule for nuclear protein import was fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled bovine serum albumin-conjugated with the SV40 large T antigen NLS (10Paschal B.M. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 925-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Pretreatment of HeLa cell cytosol with p62-Sepharose and preparation of recombinant NTF2 and Ran/TC4 have also been described previously (8Melchior F. Paschal B. Evans J. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1649-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 10Paschal B.M. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 925-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The antibody to recombinant human NTF2 was generated in rabbits, affinity purified on NTF2-Sepharose, and used at a final concentration of 2 μg/ml. Anti-serum to the GSP1 protein (28Belhumeur P. Lee A. Tam R. DiPaolo T. Fortin N. Clark M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2152-2161Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) was used at a dilution of 1:3000 and was kindly provided by Dr. Pierre Belhumeur (University of Montreal). Immunoblots were developed with peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence. Sequence from the S. cerevisiae genome project revealed an open reading frame on chromosome V (cosmid 9537) that is highly related to the sequence of NTF2, a cytosolic factor that facilitates protein transport into the nucleus in mammalian cells (10Paschal B.M. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 925-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The predicted ORF encodes a 125-amino acid protein that is 44.4% identical and 61.5% similar to the 127-amino acid human NTF2 protein (Fig. 1 A). The central region of the protein (Phe-12–Pro-76) is 58% identical, whereas the primary structures of the amino and carboxyl termini are unrelated except for residues Asn-116–Leu-121. The sequence relationship together with the similarities in size and isoelectric point suggest the yeast ORF encodes the S. cerevisiae homologue of NTF2 and is hereafter referred to as scNTF2p. Evidence that these proteins are functional homologues was obtained in recent work showing that the human cDNA encoding NTF2 can substitute for the yeast gene (29Corbett A.H. Silver P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18477-18484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We assessed the requirement for the scNTF2p in cell viability by standard gene replacement methods in the yeast strain 15D. To generate anscNTF2 deletion allele, we first used PCR primers that included sequences complementary to the 5′ and 3′ regions of thescNTF2 gene to amplify the URA3 gene (Fig. 1 B). The diploid strain 15D was then transformed with the linear PCR product. Stable Ura+ transformants were screened for integration of the URA3 gene by PCR using oligonucleotides that flank the scNTF2 locus (primers 1 and 2; Fig. 1 C). The DNA template from one Ura+transformant yielded PCR products with sizes of ∼560 and ∼1300 base pairs. The smaller product is the size expected from amplification of the scNTF2 locus, whereas the larger product is consistent with the replacement of the scNTF2 ORF with theURA3 gene. This was confirmed by showing that a PCR reaction with a primer that flanks scNTF2 (primer 1) and a primer within the URA3 gene (primer 3) produces a ∼700-base pair fragment. The heterozygote deletion strain for scNTF2(scNTF2/ ΔscNTF2::URA3, denoted BPY1) displayed no obvious defects in growth, morphology, or thermosensitivity (data not shown). Sporulation of the BPY1 strain and subsequent analysis of >40 tetrads revealed a 2:0 segregation (live:dead), demonstrating that the scNTF2 gene is required for viability (Fig. 1 D). We confirmed that viable segregants were Ura− by their failure to grow in the absence of uracil. These data are in agreement with those obtained using other strains of S. cerevisiae (PSY853, Ref. 29Corbett A.H. Silver P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18477-18484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar; W303, data not shown, Ref. 19Nehrbass U. Blobel G. Science. 1996; 272: 120-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). As a first step toward analyzing the function of scNTF2p in vivo, we examined the effects of scNTF2p depletion in haploid deletion strains containing plasmids with the scNTF2 gene under the control of different regulatable promoters. Initial experiments were carried out with scNTF2p expression regulated by the GAL10 promoter. We observed that colony growth in haploid deletion strains carrying theGAL10 plasmid was slowed substantially but not completely inhibited (data not shown), suggesting that expression from this plasmid is leaky. We chose the MET3 promoter as an alternative for achieving repressible scNTF2p expression. Transcription driven by this promoter can be strongly repressed by growing cells in the presence of millimolar concentrations of methionine (30Amon A. Irniger S. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1994; 77: 1037-1050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). In a haploid deletion strain (BPY4) containing scNTF2 under the control of the MET3 promoter, transcription from the scNTF2 plasmid in the absence of methionine restored growth of this strain to the same level as the WT strain (Fig. 2,−Methionine). In contrast, substantial growth inhibition resulted from including 5 mm methionine in the media, an effect that was manifest as an approximately 100-fold difference in viability as compared with the WT strain (Fig. 2,+Methionine). The BPY4 colonies that did survive selection in the presence of methionine were also visibly smaller than colonies composed of WT cells. Methionine-repression of the scNTF2 gene in the BPY4 strain resulted in distortion and apparent fragmentation of the nucleus such that the nuclear DNA appeared as small 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride staining domains within these cells (data not shown). Surprisingly, the distorted nuclei present in the mutant cells accumulated a NLS-containing version of green fluorescent protein. 2D. Goldfarb, personal communication. However, it was not possible to quantititively compare the nuclear import rate in these mutant cells to the rate in wild type cells, due to the altered nuclear morphology of the mutant cells. We note that two mutant alleles ofscNTF2 have been isolated that show a temperature-sensitive defect in protein import (29Corbett A.H. Silver P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18477-18484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), providing direct evidence that scNT2p is involved in nuclear import. To further characterize the altered nuclear morphology associated with depletion of the scNTF2p, we grew the WT and BPY4 strains in the presence of methionine for 7 h and processed the cells for thin section electron microscopy. Cells from the BPY4 strain (Fig. 3 B) displayed grossly distorted nuclear envelopes that often took the form of large intranuclear invaginations. These structures were never observed in WT cells (Fig. 3 A). Some of the mutant cells contained areas with apparent discontinuities or holes in the nuclear envelope (arrowheads, Fig. 3 B). We also observed the juxtaposition of two double pore-containing membranes within a single nucleus and the alignment of NPCs (arrows, Fig. 3 D). Interestingly, similar nuclear morphology phenotypes have been reported for yeast strains deficient for certain NPC proteins. For example, repression or overexpression of the nucleoporin Nup170p in a POM152 null background results in structural alterations of the nuclear envelope (29Corbett A.H. Silver P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18477-18484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) that are nearly identical to the changes observed by simple repression of scNTF2p expression reported here. These observations suggest that scNTF2p is involved in the ongoing maintenance of nuclear structure. This could be indirectly due to the need for scNTF2p in nuclear protein import or could reflect a direct involvement of scNTF2p in some feature of nuclear architecture. We carried out a multicopy suppressor screen to identify components that allow cells to grow in the absence of NTF2p, with the goal of identifying functionally linked components in the nuclear protein import pathway. The screen relied on the efficient repression of scNTF2p expression obtained with the MET3 promoter (30Amon A. Irniger S. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1994; 77: 1037-1050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The relatively small number and size of colonies that grew in the presence of methionine (Fig. 2) suggested that the selection scheme would have a background of <1%. This type of screen could select for genes that functionally overlap withscNTF2 or that act in parallel functional pathways. We transformed the BPY4 strain with a high copy number S. cerevisiae genomic library (26Carlson M. Botstein D. Cell. 1982; 28: 145-154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar) and plated the cells on selective media containing 5 mm methionine. From this we obtained nearly 500 colonies that grew in the presence of methionine in both the initial and secondary plating steps. Since we expected that thescNTF2 gene would represent a significant proportion of the putative suppressors, we employed a PCR screen with primers that flanked the scNTF2 gene to rapidly identify library clones containing scNTF2. Since the genomic scNTF2 ORF in the BPY4 strain had been replaced with the TRP1 gene, amplification of this locus generated a product whose larger size distinguished it from the product amplified from the scNTF2gene on a library plasmid. The scNTF2 ORF under the control of the MET3 promoter was not detected in this screen due to its lack of complementarity with the PCR primers used. A total of 480 isolates were examined by this procedure. Two-thirds of the colonies (322 of 480) were determined to be scNTF2 by this criteria, demonstrating the validity of our selection regimen. Furthermore, the strong selection for scNTF2 suppressors strongly suggests that the methionine-induced repression of transcription from the pMET-scNTF2 plasmid (together with cell doubling) leads to depletion of cellular scNTF2p. Three of the 158 clones that did not contain the scNTF2 gene were analyzed further. We sequenced approximately 400 base pairs at each end of these clones and learned all three were derived from an approximately 7-kilobase segment of chromosome XII. This region of chromosome XII is notable as it includes the locus for GSP1, the S. cerevisiae homologue of Ran/TC4 (28Belhumeur P. Lee A. Tam R. DiPaolo T. Fortin N. Clark M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2152-2161Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). These three clones also contained the gene for a GTPase of unknown function, termedGUF1 (31Kiser G.L. Weinert T.A. Yeast. 1995; 11: 1311-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We determined by deletion analysis that the suppressor activity can be ascribed to the portion of the insert that includes the GSP1 gene. The BPY4 strain carrying the pMET-scNTF2 plasmid was transformed with the original library plasmid or the deletion variants as depicted in Fig. 4 A. A dilution series of each culture was then applied to solid medium prepared without or with methionine. In this assay, we found that growth in the presence of methionine could be rescued by the full-length library insert or the portion containing GSP1, whereas a deletion construct containing the GUF1 locus failed to rescue (Fig. 4 A). We analyzed 27 additional candidate suppressor clone candidates from the 158 methionine-resistant colonies by Southern blotting and PCR and determined that 25 of these 27 clones contained the GSP1gene. The remaining two clones failed to rescue growth on methionine when reintroduced into yeast and likely represent the background in this screen. These data indicate that the vast majority of the clones that rescued growth on methionine are GSP1. Our finding that cells depleted of an essential gene product (scNTF2p) can be rescued by a gene that is unrelated in sequence (GSP1) is surprising. One explanation is that in the presence of methionine the scNTF2p was still expressed at low levels, and in this background overexpression of the GSP1p suppressed the growth defect. Alternatively, it was possible that the scNTF2p was virtually absent from the mutant strain, and overexpression of the GSP1p compensated for this loss. To address this issue, we tested whether overexpression of GSP1p would allow a complete loss of the pMET-scNTF2 plasmid in the BPY4 (ΔscNTF2) strain. We transformed the BPY4 strain with pURA-GSP1 and maintained transformants in continuous culture for 48 h. This was done in the absence of uracil to maintain the pURA-GSP1 plasmid and in the presence of methionine and leucine to repress transcription and to allow for loss of the LEU plasmid pMET-scNTF2, respectively. The cultures were plated at low density on medium lacking uracil, grown for three days, and replica-plated onto media lacking leucine to score for the presence/absence of the pMET-scNTF2 plasmid. Approximately one-third of the colonies were Ura+ and Leu− (data not shown), indicating that overexpression of GSP1p can, in fact, compensate for the complete loss of scNTF2p in vivo. We also found that the growth rate of the strain carrying pGSP1 and lacking pMET-scNTF2 was essentially identical to the WT strain (Fig. 4 B). GSP1p expression in this strain was elevated 1.73-fold relative to WT cells carrying only a plasmid to confer growth in the absence of uracil (Fig. 4 C). It is not surprising that a higher level of GSP1p expression is not achieved, considering that GSP1p in WT cells is already a very abundant cellular protein. Taken together, these data establish unequivocally that modulating the level of GSP1p relieves the requirement for what is otherwise an essential gene. Our finding that a high level of the S. cerevisiae homologue of Ran/TC4 can rescue growth in a mutant yeast strain that lacks the scNTF2 gene prompted us to examine the requirements for these proteins using an assay that measures nuclear protein import in permeabilized mammalian cells. Specifically, we sought to determine if the addition of recombinant Ran/TC4 could serve to biochemically complement cytosol depleted of the NTF2 protein. We prepared NTF2-depleted cytosol by passing a high speed extract of HeLa cells over p62-Sepharose (10Paschal B.M. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 925-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). This treatment removes >96% of cytosolic NTF2 as determined by quantitative immunoblotting, but it does not remove Ran/TC4 from cytosol (Ref. 10Paschal B.M. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 925-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar and data not shown). We measured the nuclear protein import supported by this cytosol as a function of Ran/TC4 concentration both in the absence and presence of NTF2 (Fig. 5 A). The addition of purified recombinant NTF2 to NTF2-depleted cytosol stimulated transport 2.3-fold, an effect that was altered only slightly by adding low concentrations (<2 μg/ml) of Ran/TC4 protein. However, the addition of Ran/TC4 (25 (μg/ml) to the NTF2-depleted cytosol (Fig. 5 A, lower curve) restored transport to levels that are comparable to those obtained in the presence of both NTF2 and Ran/TC4 (Fig. 5 A, upper curve). These data show that the requirement for NTF2 protein in the nuclear protein import assay can be relieved by supplementing the transport reaction with recombinant Ran/TC4 protein. We note that low levels of NTF2 contributed by the depleted cytosol and the permeabilized cells together with the Ran/TC4 in the depleted cytosol probably accounts for the transport obtained without supplementing the reaction with recombinant NTF2 (Fig. 5 B). Our initial characterization of scNTF2p in the budding yeastS. cerevisiae has provided valuable insight on the role of this protein in cell function. We have found that this protein is required for cell viability, in agreement with observations from other laboratories (19Nehrbass U. Blobel G. Science. 1996; 272: 120-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 29Corbett A.H. Silver P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18477-18484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Moreover, we observed that depletion of scNTF2p leads to aberrant nuclear morphologies characterized by gross invaginations of the nuclear envelope and juxtaposition of NPCs in stacked nuclear membranes, similar to the morphological phenotypes obtained with mutants of certain NPC proteins (32Aitchison J.D. Rout M.P. Marelli M. Blobel G. Wozniak R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1133-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Most significantly, we have demonstrated that the scNTF2 null mutant can be rescued by GSP1, the S. cerevisiae homologue of Ran/TC4. This provides the first in vivo evidence that certain functions of NTF2 and Ran/TC4 are linked. These linked functions probably relate to nuclear protein import, since both Ran/TC4 and scNTF2 are involved in nuclear import in yeast (29Corbett A.H. Silver P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18477-18484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 33Schlenstedt G. Saavedra C.J. Loeb D.J. Cole C.N. Silver P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) as well as in higher eukaryotes (12Melchior F. Gerace L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 310-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Our present genetic analysis does not unequivocally demonstrate a direct interaction between GSP1 and scNTF2, and it is formally possible that GSP1 rescues thescNTF2 null mutant by an indirect mechanism. However, addition of recombinant Ran/TC4 to digitonin-permeabilized HeLa cells depleted of NTF2 results in a rescue of nuclear protein import. Taken together, these observations suggest that the rate of nuclear protein import is closely tied to the cellular concentrations of NTF2 and Ran/TC4. The finding that GSP1p levels were elevated only 1.73-fold inscNTF2 null mutants was surprising given that theGSP1 gene was carried on a high copy number (2 μm) plasmid. This may be explained by the fact that overexpression of GSP1 is slightly toxic in the strains used in this study (Fig. 4 A). Therefore, under the conditions of the genetic selection, growth was inhibited both by the repression of scNTF2p expression and by the overexpression of GSP1p from the library plasmid. In vertebrates, both Ran/TC4 and NTF2 are required for transport event(s) that occur during movement of a substrate-NLS receptor complex through the NPC. There is good evidence that during the transport process the GTP form of Ran/TC4 binds to RanBP2, a putative initial substrate/NLS receptor docking site at the NPC and that RanGAP-stimulated hydrolysis at this site is involved in the forward progress of a transport complex (34Melchior F. Guan T. Yokoyama N. Nishimoto T. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 571-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 35Mahajan R. Delphin C. Guan T. Gerace L. Melchior F. Cell. 1997; 88: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). After the transport complex leaves RanBP2, it is not known whether nucleotide exchange on Ran/TC4 and additional rounds of Ran-GTP hydrolysis are required to drive translocation through the nuclear pore (15Rexach M. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 83: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 35Mahajan R. Delphin C. Guan T. Gerace L. Melchior F. Cell. 1997; 88: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). The role of NTF2 in nuclear protein import is even less well defined. NTF2 binds directly to several FXFG-type repeat proteins of the NPC as well as to the GDP form of Ran, suggesting it could play a role in modulating the interaction of transport complexes with several discrete NPC sites (14Paschal B.M. Delphin C. Gerace L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7679-7683Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 91, 21Hu T.H. Guan T.L. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 589-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Our observations that a high level of Ran/TC4 can relieve the requirement for NTF2 in cell viability (in yeast) and nuclear protein import (in mammalian cells) suggests that NTF2 may regulate a protein-protein interaction(s) that involves Ran/TC4. For example, dissociation of a substrate-NLS receptor complex from RanBP2 during its transfer to another NPC protein could be promoted by the binding of either NTF2 or Ran-GTP to RanBP2, and in the absence of NTF2 this could occur more rapidly with an increased concentration of Ran/TC4. Alternatively, NTF2 may contribute to binding or dissociation reactions promoted by RanGDP, if the latter itself acts as a soluble factor to promote a step(s) of nuclear import (36Görlich D. Panté N. Kutay U. Aebi U. Bischoff F.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5584-5594Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Our observation that NTF2 is dispensable under certain conditions argues against the hypothesis that NTF2 promotes GDP/GTP exchange on Ran/TC4 during nuclear import (19Nehrbass U. Blobel G. Science. 1996; 272: 120-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In summary, we have demonstrated that the scNTF2 gene encodes an essential protein that is linked to some function(s) ofGSP1, the S. cerevisiae homologue of Ran/TC4. The ability of a high level of Ran/TC4 to relieve the requirement for an otherwise essential gene product in vivo as well as in vitro places constraints on possible functions for NTF2 in nuclear protein import. We favor a role for NTF2 in regulating protein-protein interactions that involves Ran/TC4 at the nuclear pore complex. We thank Drs.

In addition to reducing dinitrogenase during nitrogenase turnover, NIFH functions in the biosynthesis of the iron-molybdenum cofactor (FeMo-co), and in the processing of α2β2 apodinitrogenase 1 (a catalytically inactive form of dinitrogenase 1 that lacks the FeMo-co) to the FeMo-co-activatable α2β2γ2 form.

We investigated the ability of VNFH to function in the in vitro biosynthesis of FeMo-co and in the maturation of apodinitrogenase 1. VNFH can replace NIFH in both the biosynthesis of FeMo-co and in the maturation of apodinitrogenase 1. These results suggest that the dinitrogenase reductase proteins do not specify the heterometal incorporated into the cofactors of the respective nitrogenase enzymes. The specificity for the incorporation of molybdenum into FeMo-co was also examined using the in vitro FeMo-co synthesis assay system. NIFH (the nifH gene product) has several functions in the nitrogenase enzyme system.

The reduction of atmospheric N2 to ammonium by biological systems is catalyzed by the nitrogenase enzymes. The aerobeAzotobacter vinelandii harbors three genetically distinct nitrogenase enzymes that are regulated by the metal content of the growth medium, among other factors (1Bishop P.E. Joerger R.D.

Nitrogenases 1, 2, and 3 are encoded by the nif, vnf, and anfgenes, respectively. nif-encoded nitrogenase 1 is a molybdenum-containing enzyme that is expressed in the presence of molybdenum. Expression of the vnf-encoded nitrogenase 2, a vanadium-containing enzyme, requires medium that is depleted in molybdenum and that contains vanadium. The anf-encoded nitrogenase 3 is expressed in medium deficient in both metals. All three nitrogenases are two-component metalloenzymes comprised of dinitrogenase and dinitrogenase reductase (1Bishop P.E. Joerger R.D. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol.

Dinitrogenase contains the active site metal center of the enzyme, and dinitrogenase reductase functions as the obligate electron donor to dinitrogenase during enzyme turnover in a MgATP- and reductant-dependent process (4Dean D.R.

The product of NIFB, termed NifB-co, is an iron- and sulfur-containing precursor to FeMo-co (14Shah V.K. Allen J.R. Spangler N.J. Ludden P.W. J. Biol.

Based on the amino acid sequence identity of NIFEN to NIFDK (the structural polypeptides of dinitrogenase 1), and the fact that NIFEN has been shown to bind NifB-co (15Allen R.M. Chatterjee R.

In addition to being necessary for the biosynthesis of FeMo-co, the gene products of both nifV and nifB are required for the biosynthesis of the iron-vanadium cofactor (FeV-co) of dinitrogenase 2 and the putative iron-only cofactor (FeFe-co) of dinitrogenase 3 (18Kennedy C.

Petrovich R. Shah V.K. Roberts G.P. Ludden P.W. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1445-1450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, homocitrate is presumed to be present as a component of FeV-co and FeFe-co, and NifB-co is believed to serve as the iron and sulfur donor to all three cofactors. Homologs ofnifE and nifN have been identified in thevnf but not in the anf system (22Wolfinger E.D. Bishop P.E. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7565-7572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); homologs ofnifH exist in both molybdenum-independent systems (23Joerger R.D. Loveless T.M. Pau R.N. Mitchenall L.A. Simon B.H.

An in vitro system for the synthesis of FeMo-co that requires at least molybdate, homocitrate, an ATP-regenerating mixture, a source of reductant, NifB-co, NIFEN, and NIFH has been described (12Shah V.K.

The in vitro FeMo-co synthesis system utilizes molybdenum with high specificity as addition of 100-fold excess tungstate (a competitive inhibitor of the molybdenum transport system in Klebsiella pneumoniae) or vanadate do not significantly inhibit FeMo-co synthesis (12Shah V.K. Imperial J. Ugalde R.A. Ludden P.W. Brill W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1636-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The replacement of molybdenum with vanadium or iron in the cofactor during in vitro synthesis has not been achieved. The preferential incorporation of molybdenum into FeMo-co suggests that a component(s) involved in FeMo-co biosynthesis might exclusively select for molybdenum. The presence of a dinitrogenase reductase associated with each nitrogen fixation system makes that protein a likely candidate for specifying the heterometal incorporated into the respective cofactors of the nitrogenase enzymes. NIFH has multiple roles in the nitrogenase 1 enzyme system. In addition to MgATP-dependent electron transfer to dinitrogenase during substrate reduction, NIFH is required for the biosynthesis of FeMo-co (10Filler W.A. Kemp R.N. Ng J.C. Hawkes T.R. Dixon R.A.

In the latter process, NIFH is required for the association of the γ protein (a non-nif-encoded protein) (28Homer M.J. Dean D.R. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24745-24752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) with α2β2 apodinitrogenase 1 to form the FeMo-co-activatable α2β2γ2hexamer (27Allen R.M. Homer M.J. Chatterjee R. Ludden P.W. Roberts G.P. Shah V.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23670-23674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Some altered forms of NIFH that are unable to function as a reductant for nitrogenase-dependent substrate reduction are fully functional in FeMo-co biosynthesis and in the maturation of apodinitrogenase 1 (29Shah V.K.

Science. 1992; 258: 992-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), indicating that the characteristics of NIFH that enable it to function in nitrogenase turnover are not necessary for its role in the formation of active dinitrogenase. In vivo studies by Joerger et al. (23Joerger R.D. Loveless T.M. Pau R.N. Mitchenall L.A. Simon B.H. Bishop P.E. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 3400-3408Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Gollanet al.

Biochem. 1993; 215: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) suggest that NIFH supports FeV-co synthesis and that ANFH (the anfh gene product) supports FeMo-co synthesis. We utilized the in vitro FeMo-co synthesis assay system to definitively determine whether VNFH would function in FeMo-co biosynthesis; the ability of VNFH to replace NIFH in the formation of the FeMo-co-activatable α2β2γ2 form of apodinitrogenase 1 was also examined.

All vessels used in preparing media and for cell culture were rinsed thoroughly in 4 n HCl and then in deionized water. Cultures (15 liters) of strain DJ1030 were grown in 20-liter polycarbonate carboys with vigorous aeration at 30 °C on Burk's medium that lacked sodium molybdate and contained 10 μm NaVO3 (for derepression of thevnf system) and 40 μg of nitrogen/ml as ammonium acetate. The cultures were monitored for depletion of ammonium, following which they were derepressed for 4.5 h. The cells were concentrated using a Pellicon cassette system equipped with a filtration membrane (0.45 μm, Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) and were centrifuged. The cell pellets were frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −80 °C. Strain DJ1030 was grown on Burk's medium containing 1 mmsodium molybdate in place of NaVO3 for derepression of thenif system. Strain UW45 was grown and derepressed on tungsten-containing medium (molybdenum free) as described previously (12Shah V.K. Imperial J. Ugalde R.A. Ludden P.W. Brill W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1636-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Strain CA117.30 was grown in 250-ml cultures on Burk's medium containing 10 μm NaVO3; cells were concentrated by centrifugation, and derepression was initiated (for 4 h) by suspending the cell pellets in nitrogen-free Burk's medium. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and frozen as described above. Cell-free extracts were prepared by the osmotic shock method (6Shah V.K. Brill W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 3249-3253Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). All buffers were sparged with purified N2 (and degassed on a gassing manifold where appropriate) for 10–30 min, and DTH was added to a final concentration of 1.7 mm. All buffers used in column chromatography contained 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin. Buffers used in fast protein liquid chromatography were filtered through a 0.45-μm filter. Tris-HCl was at pH 7.4 unless stated otherwise. All column chromatography steps except for fast protein liquid chromatography were performed at 4 °C. VNFH was purified from extract of strain DJ1030 (ΔnifHΔnifB, vnf-derepressed) with modifications to the method described by Hales et al. (37Hales B.J. Langosch D.J. Case E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15301-15306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One hundred fifty ml of cell-free extract (from 50 g of cell paste) were applied to a 2.5 × 17-cm DEAE-cellulose column that had been equilibrated in buffer containing 0.1 m NaCl in 0.025 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Following application of the extract, the column was washed with 2 bed volumes of buffer containing 0.125 m NaCl in 0.025 m Tris-HCl; VNFH was eluted using 0.22 m NaCl in 0.025 m Tris-HCl. The DEAE-cellulose fraction was concentrated by ultrafiltration using a XM100-A membrane, and the retentate (4 ml) was applied to a 2.5 × 78-cm Sephacryl S-100 column that had been equilibrated with 0.05m NaCl in 0.025 m Tris-HCl. The column was developed with the same buffer, and the VNFH-containing fractions that exhibited the highest activity were concentrated by ultrafiltration (described above) and purified further on a Mono Q anion exchange column used in conjunction with a fast protein liquid chromatography system. Two ml (6.8 mg of protein) of the VNFH-containing retentate from the ultrafiltration cell was applied onto the Mono Q column that had been equilibrated with 0.15 m NaCl in 0.025m Tris-HCl. The column was washed with 1 bed volume of the equilibration buffer, following which VNFH was eluted using a 20-ml increasing linear gradient from 0.15 to 0.4 m NaCl (in 0.025 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). VNFH eluted with 0.32m NaCl in 0.025 m Tris-HCl. Active fractions were stored in 9-ml, serum-stoppered vials at −80 °C. The ability of VNFH to transfer electrons to dinitrogenase 1 was tested using the acetylene reduction assay for nitrogenase activity, and the results were consistent with the published results. VNFH was equally effective as NIFH in transferring electrons to dinitrogenase 1, consistent with the results of Chisnell et al. (34Chisnell J.R. Premakumar R. Bishop P.E. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 27-33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FeMo-co was prepared in N-methylformamide as described previously (6Shah V.K. Brill W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 3249-3253Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). The reactions were performed in 9-ml, serum-stoppered vials that were repeatedly evacuated, flushed with argon, and rinsed with 0.3 ml of 0.025 m Tris-HCl containing 1.7 mm DTH. The following components were added to the vials in the order indicated: 100 μl of 0.025 mTris-HCl; 200 μl of an ATP-regenerating mixture (containing 3.6 mm ATP, 6.3 mm MgCl2, 51 mm phosphocreatine, 20 units/ml creatine phosphokinase, and 6.3 mm DTH); 200 μl (3.8 mg protein) of extract of strain DJ1030 (ΔnifHΔnifB,nif-derepressed) as a source of α2β2 apodinitrogenase 1 and the γ protein; and 10–50 μl (0.1 mg of protein) of the appropriate dinitrogenase reductase. The vials were incubated for 10 min at room temperature to allow the formation of α2β2γ2 apodinitrogenase 1. One hundred μl of anoxic 50% glycerol were added to the reactions to be analyzed by native PAGE, and these vials were placed on ice. Ten μl of a solution containing an excess of FeMoco were added to the remaining vials, which were incubated for 10 min at room temperature during which α2β2γ2apodinitrogenase 1 was activated by FeMo-co to form dinitrogenase 1. Fifty nmol of (NH4)2MoS4 (prepared in N-methylformamide containing 1.7 mm DTH) were added to the vials to prevent further FeMo-co insertion into apodinitrogenase 1. Activity of the newly reconstituted dinitrogenase 1 was monitored by the C2H2 reduction assay for nitrogenase (12Shah V.K. Imperial J. Ugalde R.A. Ludden P.W. Brill W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1636-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). (NH4)2MoS4 was excluded in certain control reactions, and 0.1 mg of the appropriate dinitrogenase reductase (that used in the insertion phase of the assay) was added in place of 0.1 mg of NIFH normally added during the C2H2 reduction phase of the assay (12Shah V.K.

Nine-ml serum vials were repeatedly evacuated, flushed with argon, and rinsed with buffer containing 1.7 mm DTH. Components were added to the vials in the following order: 100 μl of 0.025 m Tris-HCl, 10 μl of 1 mm Na2MoO4, 20 μl of 5 mm homocitrate (that had been treated with base to cleave the lactone, pH 8.0), and 200 μl of the ATP-regenerating mixture (defined above). The vials were incubated at room temperature for 10–20 min. Two hundred μl of extract (∼3.8 mg protein) of either DJ1030 (ΔnifHΔnifB,nif-derepressed) or CA12 (ΔnifHDK,nif-derepressed), 25 μl of a solution containing NifB-co, and 10–50 μl (0.1 mg protein) of the appropriate dinitrogenase reductase were added to the vials. The vials were incubated at 30 °C for 30–90 min. Following this incubation, 100 μl of anoxic 50% glycerol were added to the reactions to be analyzed by anoxic native PAGE, and these vials were placed on ice. Five nmol of (NH4)2MoS4 (prepared as described above) were added to the remaining vials to prevent further FeMo-co synthesis during the subsequent C2H2 reduction phase of the assay. The activity of the newly formed dinitrogenase 1 was monitored by the C2H2 reduction assay. (NH4)2MoS4 was excluded from certain reactions to which 0.1 mg of the appropriate dinitrogenase reductase (that used in the synthesis phase of the assay) was added in place of 0.1 mg of NIFH normally added during the C2H2 reduction phase of the assay. Proteins were resolved on anoxic native gels with a 7–14% acrylamide (37.1% acrylamide, 1% bisacrylamide) and 0–20% sucrose gradient. The electrophoresis buffer was N2-sparged, 65 mm Tris-glycine (pH 8.5) containing 1.7 mm DTH. Gels were pre-electrophoresed for at least 60 min at 120 V for initial reduction, and proteins were electrophoresed for 1920 V-h (at 120 V) at 4 °C. One hundred μl of the reaction mixtures were applied onto the gel. Polyclonal antibodies to NIFH and the γ protein were raised in rabbits (the anti-γ protein antibodies were prepared and made available by Drs. Mary Homer and Gary Roberts). Immunoblotting and developing procedures have been described (38Brandner J.P. McEwan A.G. Kaplan S. Donahue T. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 360-368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The native gels were equilibrated in transfer buffer for at least 15 min prior to blotting.

The results in Table I show that treatment of extract containing α2β2 apodinitrogenase 1 and the γ protein with equivalent levels of purified NIFH or VNFH resulted in similar levels of activity in the FeMo-co insertion assay, indicating that VNFH is as effective as NIFH in the conversion of α2β2 apodinitrogenase 1 to the α2β2γ2 form. Nucleotide is necessary for the VNFH-dependent maturation process as is maturation supported by NIFH (27Allen R.M. Homer M.J. Chatterjee R. Ludden P.W. Roberts G.P. Shah V.K. J. Biol.

Control reactions in which (NH4)2MoS4 was not added to quench further FeMo-co insertion and which contained VNFH in both insertion and C2H2 reduction phases of the assay exhibited similar levels of activity as reactions to which NIFH was added (following (NH4)2MoS4addition) during the C2H2 reduction phase. Thus, the activities reported in Table I for reactions that contained VNFH in the insertion phase alone were not a result of NIFH functioning to attach the γ protein to α2β2apodinitrogenase 1 during the C2H2 reduction phase of the assay. NIFH from another organism (Rhodospirillum rubrum) also supported activity in the FeMo-co insertion assay (Table I).Table IAbility of VNFH to function in the FeMo-co insertion assay and in in vitro FeMo-co synthesisDinitrogenase reductase1-aAssays contained 0.1 mg of the appropriate dinitrogenase reductase protein and 3.8 mg of extract of strain DJ1030 (ΔnifHΔnifB, nif-derepressed) as a source of α2β2 apodinitrogenase and γ protein.FeMo-co insertion1-bFeMo-co insertion assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures”; activities are expressed as nanomoles of C2H4 formed/min/assay.FeMo-co synthesis1-cFeMo-co synthesis assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures”; activities are expressed as nanomoles of C2H4 formed/min/assay.−MgATP+MgATPC2 H4 formed/min/assayNone0.30.40.03NIFH0.514.629.8VNFH0.414.58.2NIFH (R. rubrum)1-dNIFH was purified from R. rubrum as described in Ludden and Burris (42).0.413.7ND1-eNot determined.1-a Assays contained 0.1 mg of the appropriate dinitrogenase reductase protein and 3.8 mg of extract of strain DJ1030 (ΔnifHΔnifB, nif-derepressed) as a source of α2β2 apodinitrogenase and γ protein.1-b FeMo-co insertion assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures”; activities are expressed as nanomoles of C2H4 formed/min/assay.1-c FeMo-co synthesis assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures”; activities are expressed as nanomoles of C2H4 formed/min/assay.1-d NIFH was purified from R. rubrum as described in Ludden and Burris (42Ludden P.W.

Fig. 1, an immunoblot of an anoxic, native gel (developed with antibody to the γ protein), illustrates that VNFH functions in the association of the γ protein with α2β2 apodinitrogenase 1 (Fig. 1, lane 3).

Open table in a new tab The high degree of amino acid sequence identity between NIFH and VNFH (91%) (1Bishop P.E. Joerger R.D. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1990; 41: 109-125Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar) is consistent with the effectiveness of VNFH in both substrate reduction (when complemented with dinitrogenase 1) and in the maturation of apodinitrogenase 1. The domain(s) of NIFH required for both the above functions are quite likely highly conserved in VNFH. At present, the role(s) of the dinitrogenase reductase protein in the maturation of apodinitrogenase 1 remains under investigation. VNFH was tested in the in vitro FeMo-co synthesis assay in place of NIFH (Table I). VNFH typically exhibited 25–30% of the FeMo-co synthesis activity (in our fixed time assay) observed with an equivalent level of NIFH, despite exhibiting similar levels of activity in the C2H2 reduction assay. Addition of increasing levels of VNFH and increasing the time allowed for in vitro FeMo-co synthesis did not result in a linear increase in activity (data not shown). The limiting step(s) in the assay is not the maturation of apodinitrogenase 1, because VNFH functions as effectively as NIFH in the maturation process (discussed above). The reasons for the lower level of FeMo-co synthesis observed with VNFH are not known. It is possible that VNFH is unable or slow to dissociate from a nif protein(s) with which it interacts during the course of FeMo-co synthesis, thus limiting further turnover of the protein(s) involved. Homer et al. (28Homer M.J. Dean D.R. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24745-24752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the γ protein dimer (present in extracts of A. vinelandii strains unable to synthesize FeMo-co) monomerized upon associating with FeMo-co, and thus it was possible to employ the monomerization of the γ protein (detected by anoxic native PAGE) as an alternate assay for the completion of FeMo-co synthesis. Thus, FeMo-co synthesized in vitro in reaction mixtures containing an extract of strain CA12 (ΔnifHDK, nif-derepressed) would accumulate on the γ protein (resulting in the monomerization of the γ protein dimer) due to the absence of apodinitrogenase 1 in extracts of this strain. Fig. 2 is an immunoblot (developed with antibody to the γ protein) of an anoxic native gel that demonstrates the results of this study. When dinitrogenase reductase is excluded from the in vitro FeMo-co synthesis reaction, the γ dimer and a slow migrating species of γ that is uncharacterized (indicated by X on Fig. 2) are observed (Fig. 2, lane 1); the dimeric form of the γ protein is observed in extracts of strains that are impaired in FeMo-co biosynthesis (33Wright D.W. Chang R.T. Mandal S.K. Armstrong W.H. Orme- Johnson W.H. J. Bio-inorg. Chem. 1996; 1: 143-151Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). That both NIFH and VNFH support FeMo-co biosynthesis is illustrated by the monomerization of the γ protein observed as the faster migrating γ protein-FeMo-co form in reactions that included NIFH or VNFH (Fig. 2, lanes 2 and 3). Does dinitrogenase reductase specify the heterometal contained in the nitrogenase cofactors? Two lines of evidence suggest that the dinitrogenase reductases do not specify or select against the heterometal that is incorporated into the cofactors of the nitrogenase enzymes: 1) the ability of VNFH to function in in vitroFeMo-co synthesis (albeit less effectively than NIFH), and 2) the observation by Joerger et al. (23Joerger R.D. Loveless T.M. Pau R.N. Mitchenall L.A. Simon B.H. Bishop P.E. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 3400-3408Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that NIFH supported vanadium-dependent diazotrophic growth of an A. vinelandii strain containing a deletion in the vnfHgene, indicating that, in vivo, NIFH functions in FeV-co biosynthesis. Gollan et al. (32Gollan U. Schneider K. Müller A. Schüddekopf K. Klipp W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) demonstrated the in vivo synthesis and incorporation of FeMo-co into the dinitrogenase 3 polypeptides of a Rhodobacter capsulatus strain containing deletions in the nifHDK genes; the synthesis of FeMo-co in the absence of a nifH gene suggests that ANFH most likely replaced NIFH in the synthesis of FeMo-co. Our results demonstrating the ability of VNFH to function in the in vitro biosynthesis of FeMo-co suggest that the dinitrogenase reductase protein quite likely does not select against the incorporation of molybdenum into FeV-co and FeFe-co. Cofactor structures of the three nitrogenases are proposed to be essentially similar with vanadium and iron atoms replacing the molybdenum atom in FeV-co and FeFe-co, respectively (2Eady R.R. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 1991; 36: 77-102Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 21Davis R. Lehman L. Petrovich R. Shah V.K. Roberts G.P. Ludden P.W. J.

The requirement of the nifB and nifV gene products for the biosynthesis of all three cofactors suggests that certain steps in the biosynthesis of FeMo-co are shared in the biosynthetic pathways of all three cofactors. Although FeV-co is largely uncharacterized, extended x-ray absorption fine structure studies on dinitrogenase 2 indicate that FeV-co is similar in structure to FeMo-co with the octahedral vanadium atom surrounded by 3 oxygen atoms and 3 sulfur atoms as is the molybdenum atom in FeMo-co (41Arber J.M.

Other similarities between FeMo-co and FeV-co include the ability to extract FeV-co intoN-methylformamide (20Smith B.E. Eady R.R. Lowe D.J. Gormal C. Biochem. J. 1988; 250: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and its probable ligation to the dinitrogenase 2 polypeptide via the conserved cysteine and histidine residues (analogous to Cys-275 and His-442 of NIFD) that ligate FeMo-co to dinitrogenase 1 (8Kim J. Rees D.C. Nature. 1992; 257: 553-560Google Scholar, 23Joerger R.D. Loveless T.M. Pau R.N. Mitchenall L.A. Simon B.H. Bishop P.E. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 3400-3408Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the FeMo-co synthesis system would utilize vanadium and iron in the synthesis of FeV-co and FeFe-co, respectively, we tested various vanadium- and iron-containing compounds in place of molybdenum in the in vitro FeMo-co synthesis assay. Extract of A. vinelandii strain UW45 (nifB −, tungsten-grown) was used as a source of all the nif-encoded proteins necessary for the synthesis of FeMo-co. Active dinitrogenase 1 was formed only when molybdenum (in the form of Na2MoO4) was included in the in vitro reactions (Table II). Molybdenum added to in vitro FeMo-co synthesis reactions in the form of (NH4)2MoO2S2, K2MoO3S, and MoS2 also supportedin vitro FeMo-co synthesis (data not shown). Vanadium added in the form of NaVO3, V2O5, VCl3,VOPO4, or [K2(H2O)5][(VO2)2(R,S-homocitrate)2]·H2O did not produce active dinitrogenase 1. Similar results were obtained when iron (in the form of FeCl3 and Fe(II)NO3) was included in the assay. Several possibilities might account for these results. The FeMo-co synthesis machinery might indeed discriminate against vanadium and iron; however, in vivostudies demonstrating the ability of NIFEN and NIFH to support vanadium-dependent diazotrophy suggest that certainnif proteins required for FeMo-co biosynthesis do function in FeV-co biosynthesis in vivo (22Wolfinger E.D. Bishop P.E. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7565-7572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Joerger R.D. Loveless T.M. Pau R.N. Mitchenall L.A. Simon B.H. Bishop P.E. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 3400-3408Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Vanadium and iron might not be in their correct oxidation states or precursor forms necessary for incorporation into the cofactor under the in vitro assay conditions. We employed cell-free extracts of strain CA117.30 (ΔnifDKB) that was derepressed on vanadium to determine whether FeV-co could be synthesized under conditions similar to those used to synthesize FeMo-co in vitro. When extract of CA117.30 (ΔnifDKB, vnf-derepressed) was used as a source of vnf-encoded proteins in in vitroreactions containing vanadium (in the form of NaVO3, V2O5, VCl3, VOPO4, or K2(H2O)5][(VO2)2(R,S-homocitrate)2]·H2O), homocitrate, ATP (in the form of an ATP-regenerating mixture), and NifB-co, formation of active dinitrogenase 2 was not observed (Table II). Varying the nucleotides included in the reactions, the pH of the reaction mixture, and addition of partially purified apodinitrogenase 1 and NIFEN (in case of limiting levels of apodinitrogenase 2 and VNFEN in the vnf-derepressed extracts) to certain reactions also produced negative results. Clearly, the in vitro conditions under which FeMo-co is synthesized are inadequate for the synthesis of FeV-co. As discussed above, the conversion of vanadium to the form required for its incorporation into FeV-co might not occur in vitro; alternatively, intermediates in the FeV-co biosynthetic pathway might be unstable under our cell-breakage and assay conditions. These observations suggest that steps and precursors unique to the synthesis of FeV-co quite likely exist. The identification of additional vnf genes and the characterization of phenotypes of strains carrying lesions in vnf genes might enable the elucidation of steps involved in the biosynthesis of FeV-co.

This requires expression of both the CD45 tyrosine phosphatase and the Lck protein tyrosine kinase and depends upon signaling via protein kinase C. In contrast to previous studies examining requirements for Sos phosphorylation following insulin and epidermal growth factor receptor engagement, we show that TCR-induced phosphorylation of Sos does not require activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular-signal regulated kinase (MEK/ERK) pathway. However, the basal phosphorylation of Sos in T cells is affected by either MEK or MEK-dependent kinases. Although Sos phosphorylation results in its dissociation from Grb2 following insulin stimulation in Chinese hamster ovary cells, TCR engagement on the Jurkat T cell line fails to elicit a similar effect. These data demonstrate that the kinases responsible for Sos phosphorylation differ following ligation of various cell surface receptors and that the consequences of Sos phosphorylation relies, at least in part, on sites of its phosphorylation.

Recently, a great deal of attention has been directed toward an understanding of not only how Ras is activated following receptor ligation, but also how Ras signaling is terminated (26Cherniack A.D.

Clues to possible mechanisms for feedback control of Ras activation have come from studies demonstrating that IR ligation leads to phosphorylation of Sos on serine and threonine residues (29Rozakis-Adcock M. Van der Geer P. Mbamalu G. Pawson T. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1417-1426PubMed Google Scholar). This event depends on activation of Raf and MEK and correlates with a dissociation of Sos from Grb2 (28Waters S.B. Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2791-2799Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Since the membrane-localization of the Grb2·Sos complex is required for Sos to activate Ras, this dissociation could serve as a means of terminating Ras activation. In experiments where Sos phosphorylation is prevented, Ras activation is prolonged (27Waters S.B. Holt K.H. Ross S.E. Syu L.-J. Guan K.-L. Saltiel A.R. Koretzky G.A. Pessin J.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 25320-25323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Together, these findings suggest that Sos phosphorylation may play a critical role in regulating Ras activity. In the present study we investigated the regulation of Sos phosphorylation following TCR ligation. We found that for Sos phosphorylation to occur, T cells must express both the CD45 tyrosine phosphatase and the Lck PTK. TCR-induced phosphorylation of Sos also depends on activation of protein kinase C (PKC). Interestingly, however, unlike cells stimulated via the IR, Sos phosphorylation following engagement of the TCR appears to be independent of MEK. This was surprising since others (31Crews C.M. Alessandrini A. Erikson R.L. Science. 1992; 258: 478-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar, 32Crews C.M. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8205-8209Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) have suggested ERK, a kinase directly activated by MEK, is required for Sos phosphorylation in T cells (33Buday L. Warne P.H. Downward J. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1327-1331PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore pursued the potential role of ERK as a Sos kinase by mutating canonical ERK phosphorylation sites in Sos. We have observed that although these sites are important for basal Sos phosphorylation, they do not appear to be required for induced phosphorylation following TCR engagement. In addition, although IR-induced Sos phosphorylation leads to dissociation of Sos from Grb2, TCR-mediated Sos phosphorylation does not have this effect. Collectively, our data demonstrate that the kinases responsible for modifying Sos differ following ligation of the TCR and IR and that the phosphorylation-dependent release of Grb2 from Sos may rely, at least in part, on specific sites of phosphorylation. The T cells used in these studies include Jurkat, a CD4+ human leukemic line, and Jurkat-derived variants. J45.01 is CD45-deficient (34Koretzky G.A. Picus J. Schultz T. Weiss A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2037-2041Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) and J45/CH11 is a clone derived from J45.01 which expresses a chimeric molecule including the extracellular and transmembrane domains of the A2 allele of major histocompatibility complex class I and the cytoplasmic domain of CD45 (4Hovis R.R.

JCam.1 is deficient in expression of Lck (35Goldsmith M.A. Weiss A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6879-6883Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and JCam/Lck is derived from JCam.1 by transfection with wild-type lckcDNA (36Straus D.B. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 70: 585-593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). JCam.1 and JCam/Lck were gifts of A. Weiss (UCSF, San Francisco). Both Jurkat and Jurkat-derived cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 complete medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, penicillin (1000 units/ml), streptomycin (1000 units/ml), and glutamine (20 mm). J45/CH11 was grown in medium supplemented with 2 mg/ml G418 (Sigma), and JCam/Lck was grown in medium supplemented with 300 μg/ml hygromycin (Sigma). Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably transfected with cDNA encoding the human IR (CHO/IR) (28Waters S.B. Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2791-2799Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) were cultured in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (1000 units/ml), streptomycin (1000 units/ml), and glutamine (20 mm). Polyclonal rabbit antiserum directed against Sos1 and monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against the NH2-terminal SH3 region of Grb2 were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Polyclonal antiserum raised against a peptide corresponding to residues 195–217 (carboxyl terminus) of Grb2 and polyclonal antiserum raised against a peptide corresponding to residues 1311–1333 (carboxyl terminus) of human SOS1 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). mAb against mSos1 was purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). mAb against ERK1/2 was obtained from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (South San Francisco, CA). Ras antibody Y13–259 was a gift of R. Deschenes (University of Iowa, Iowa City). mAb against phosphotyrosine containing proteins (4G10) was a gift of B. Drucker (University of Oregon Health Science Center, Portland, OR). C305 (a clonotypic mAb directed against the Jurkat TCR) was a gift of A. Weiss. mAb against the FLAG epitope was purchased from Eastman Kodak Co. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse antibodies were obtained from Bio-Rad. cDNA encoding fusion protein containing glutathione S-transferase and the first 79 amino acids of c-Jun (GST-c-Jun) cloned into the pGEX bacterial expression vector and the MEK inhibitor PD98059 were a gift of A. Saltiel (Parke-Davis). Calf intestinal phosphatase, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), anisomycin, and staurosporin were obtained from Sigma. Bisindolylmaleimide I and II were obtained from Calbiochem. T cells (2 × 107/ml) were left unstimulated or stimulated with C305 ascites (1:1000 dilution) or 50 ng/ml PMA at 37 °C for the indicated times and then lysed in a buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 400 μmNa3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 400 μm EDTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 μg/ml aprotinin, 50 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. CHO/IR cells were serum-starved for 2 h followed by stimulation with 100 nm insulin-containing medium at 37 °C for indicated times and then lysed in the same lysis buffer. In some experiments, cells were pretreated with the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (100 μm, final concentration), the PKC inhibitors staurosporin (1 μm, final concentration), bisindolylmaleimide I (10 μm, final concentration), or bisindolylmaleimide II (1 μm, final concentration), or various concentrations of dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) as a vehicle control. Experiments were carried out as described previously (27Waters S.B. Holt K.H. Ross S.E. Syu L.-J. Guan K.-L. Saltiel A.R. Koretzky G.A. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20883-20886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Briefly, Jurkat cells were incubated in phosphate-free media, loaded with [32P]orthophosphate, and then stimulated for various times with anti-TCR or PMA. In some experiments, the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (100 μm, final concentration) or 0.5% Me2SO (vehicle control) were added during the last 1 h of 32P loading. Cellular lysates were then subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Ras, followed by analysis of guanine nucleotides by thin layer chromatography (TLC). The migrations of GTP and GDP were confirmed by commercial standards. Cellular lysates (equivalent to 4 × 107 cells per condition for Jurkat and 2 mg of total protein for CHO/IR cells) were subjected to immunoprecipitation with polyclonal anti-Grb2 for 2 h. Immune complexes were washed 3 times with high salt buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and 500 mm NaCl), followed by a single wash with low salt buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and 150 mm NaCl), and then dissolved in 80 μl of Laemmli's sample buffer. 80% each sample was subjected to 5–10% gradient SDS-PAGE for assessment of Sos, and the remaining 20% was subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE for assessment of Grb2. After resolution by SDS-PAGE, samples were transferred to nitrocellulose and then probed with either monoclonal anti-Grb2 or polyclonal anti-Sos followed by development by enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting reagents (Amersham Corp.). Experiments were performed as described previously (28Waters S.B. Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2791-2799Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Briefly, Jurkat cells were left unstimulated or stimulated with anti-TCR or PMA for 30 min. Lysates were precipitated with polyclonal anti-SOS1, followed by two washes with lysis buffer, and then an additional two washes with alkaline phosphatase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mmNaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmMgCl2, and 0.1 mm ZnCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 125 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μm leupeptin). Immune complexes were then incubated in 200 μl of alkaline phosphatase buffer with 40 units of calf intestinal phosphatase for 1 h at room temperature. The samples were then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, solubilized in 2 × Laemmli's sample buffer, subjected to 5–10% SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with anti-SOS mAb. Experiments were performed as described previously (37Li Y.Y. Baccam M. Waters S.B. Pessin J.E. Bishop G.A. Koretzky G.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 1440-1447PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, Jurkat cells were left unstimulated or stimulated with anti-TCR, anisomycin (10 μg/ml, final concentration), or PMA for 30 min. Lysates were precipitated with GST-c-Jun for 4 h. The protein complexes were then subjected to anin vitro kinase assay in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP at room temperature for 30 min. Reactions were terminated by adding 2 × Laemmli's sample buffer and subjected to 15% SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Single-stranded site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the Muta-Gene Phagemid In Vitro Mutagenesis Kit (Bio-Rad). The template used for mutagenesis was cDNA encoding the carboxyl terminus (amino acids 1073–1336) of mSos1. A primer TCTGCACCAAACG(T)CCCCTCGGG(A)CCCCACTGG(A)CGCCGCCCCCTGCA was synthesized for generation of an Sos variant replacing Ser-1099, Thr-1102, and Thr-1105 with alanines. Two additional primers GCCTTCTTCCCAAACG(A)GG(C)CCC(A, silent mutation) TCCCCTTTTG(A)CACCGCCACCCCCCCAAG(A)CCCCCTCTCCTCATGGC and TCAGATCCTCCTGAAG(A)GG(C)CCC(T, silent mutation)CCCTTGTTACCACCA were used in other reactions to replace Ser-1255 and Ser-1214 with glycines and Thr-1260 and -1266 with alanines. The three resultant mutants were then used to generate the hepta-mutant by further subcloning. Both the hepta-mutant (Sos.CT.VII) and its wild-type counterpart (Sos.CT.WT) were subcloned into a modified version of the pEFBOS vector (gift of D. Cantrell, London, UK) (38Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1490) Google Scholar) containing sequence encoding the FLAG epitope tag followed by aBamHI cloning site. Jurkat cells cultured to a density of 0.5–1.0 × 106 were washed 3 times with cytomix (12 mm KCl, 0.15 mmCaCl2, 10 mm potassium hydrophosphate, pH 7.6, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 2 mm EGTA, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, and 5 mm glutathione). Cells were then electroporated using a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad) with 40–100 μg of CsCl double-banded plasmid DNA at 250 V and 960 microfarads in 400 μl of cytomix. Following electroporation, cells were cultured for 40–48 h before stimulation. Stimulation of the TCR has been shown to result in PTK-dependent activation of Ras. The experiment shown in Fig. 1 A (lanes 1–6) demonstrates the kinetics of PTK activation following ligation of the TCR on the Jurkat human T cell leukemic line with a clonotypic anti-receptor mAb. Fig. 1 B (lanes 1–6) shows the kinetics of Ras GTP loading that become evident after TCR-mediated PTK activation. Following Ras activation, an electrophoretic mobility shift is seen in ERK (Fig. 1 C, lanes 1–6) that has been shown to be due to its phosphorylation and to correlate with increased enzymatic activity of this kinase (10Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3175) Google Scholar). The same lanes in Fig. 1 D demonstrate that TCR stimulation also results in an electrophoretic mobility shift of Sos, previously shown to be due to serine/threonine phosphorylation of this guanine nucleotide exchange factor (39Baltensperger K. Kozma L.M. Cherniack A.D. Klarlund J.K. Chawla A. Banerjee U. Czech M.P. Science. 1993; 260: 1950-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Maximal phosphorylation of Sos appears to be delayed relative to TCR-stimulated PTK, Ras, and ERK activation and persists for up to 60 min (data not shown). Similarly, treatment of Jurkat cells with PMA also results in phosphorylation of Sos (Fig. 1 D, lanes 7–12). This phosphorylation persists for a greater period of time when compared with Sos phosphorylation following TCR stimulation (data not shown). Similar to that seen after TCR ligation, PMA-induced phosphorylation of Sos follows Ras-GTP loading and activation of ERK (Fig. 1, Band C, lanes 7–13). However, PMA-stimulated Sos phosphorylation appears to bypass the requirement for PTK activation (Fig. 1 A, lanes 7–13). Next we performed an experiment to confirm that the observed electrophoretic mobility shift of Sos in activated T cells is due to its phosphorylation. Preliminary experiments using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies demonstrated that TCR engagement does not result in detectable levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of Sos (data not shown). However, as shown in Fig. 1 E, alkaline phosphatase treatment of anti-Sos immunoprecipitates from Jurkat cells stimulated with either PMA or anti-TCR mAb abrogates the electrophoretic mobility shift of this protein (compare lanes 2 and 3 withlanes 5 and 6) indicating that its altered migration is due to phosphorylation of serine and/or threonine residues. We have shown previously that surface expression of CD45 is required for the TCR to couple with the PTK signal transduction pathway (2Koretzky G.A. Picus J. Thomas M.L. Weiss A. Nature. 1990; 346: 66-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 4Hovis R.R. Donovan J.A. Musci M.A. Motto D.G. Goldman F.D. Ross S.E. Koretzky G.A. Science. 1993; 260: 544-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The experiment shown in Fig. 2 A recapitulates this observation as TCR stimulation of J45.01, a CD45-deficient clone of the Jurkat cell line (34Koretzky G.A. Picus J. Schultz T. Weiss A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2037-2041Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), fails to result in PTK activation (comparelanes 1 and 2 with 4 and5). This signaling defect is rescued in J45/CH11 (4Hovis R.R. Donovan J.A. Musci M.A. Motto D.G. Goldman F.D. Ross S.E. Koretzky G.A. Science. 1993; 260: 544-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), a clone of J45.01 that expresses a chimeric membrane-bound molecule containing the cytoplasmic domain of CD45 (lanes 7 and8). As expected, TCR stimulation fails to induce a mobility shift of ERK in J45.01 (Fig. 2 B, lanes 4 and 5). This defect is also restored in J45/CH11 (Fig. 2 B, lanes 7and 8). Our data also demonstrate that TCR-stimulated phosphorylation of Sos requires surface expression of CD45 (Fig. 2 C, compare lanes 1 and 2 with4 and 5). Phorbol ester stimulation bypasses the requirement for surface expression of CD45 as it results in phosphorylation of both ERK and Sos in J45.01 (Fig. 2, B andC, lane 6). One likely substrate of CD45 in the Jurkat T cell line is Lck, a member of the Src family of PTK. Considerable data suggest that one role of CD45 is to dephosphorylate the carboxyl-terminal tyrosine of Lck, enabling Lck to become active after TCR ligation (40Mustelin T. Coggeshall K.M. Altman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6302-6306Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Others have demonstrated that expression of Lck is critical for efficient signaling via the TCR (36Straus D.B. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 70: 585-593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). We predicted therefore that Lck deficiency would have similar consequences for TCR-mediated Sos phosphorylation as CD45 deficiency. Consistent with this model, stimulation of the TCR in JCam.1 (35Goldsmith M.A. Weiss A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6879-6883Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), an Lck-deficient variant of Jurkat cells, does not induce an electrophoretic mobility shift of Sos (Fig. 3 C, lanes 4 and 5). TCR-stimulated Sos phosphorylation is restored in JCam/Lck (lanes 7 and 8). Again, PMA stimulation bypasses the requirement for a functional TCR in JCam.1 (lane 6). Data shown in Fig. 3, A and B, confirm work presented by others that Lck expression is required for TCR-mediated PTK and ERK activation (36Straus D.B. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 70: 585-593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). The experiments presented above demonstrating that PMA can induce Sos phosphorylation in Jurkat cells suggest that PKC may play a role in this event. We investigated the possible role of PKC family members using two independent methodologies. Since others have shown that overnight treatment with PMA leads to membrane translocation and subsequent degradation of PKC in Jurkat cells (41Isakov N. McMahon P. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2091-2097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we incubated cells with PMA for 16 h before stimulation. As shown in Fig. 4 A, following PKC down-regulation by this means, stimulation of the TCR fails to induce an electrophoretic mobility shift in Sos (bottom panel, lanes 6–11), whereas treatment of cells with the vehicle control has no effect on the ability of the TCR to induce this event (lanes 1–5). Similarly, consistent with previous reports (42Nel A.E. Hanekom C. Rheeder A. Williams K. Pollack S. Katz R. Landreth G.E. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 2683-2689PubMed Google Scholar), we found that TCR-stimulated ERK activation also requires PKC as this event is abrogated in the cells treated overnight with PMA (top panel, lanes 6–11). Treatment of the cells overnight with PMA does not impact, however, on more proximal signals via the TCR (such as stimulation of PTKs leading to calcium mobilization, data not shown). The second method we used to investigate the requirement for PKC in TCR-mediated phosphorylation of Sos was to treat Jurkat cells with staurosporin, a PKC inhibitor,"

The MAP kinase pathway is utilized by broad organisms, including slime mold, yeast, fly, plants, and mammals, in a well conserved fashion. Following the activation of receptor tyrosine kinases and G-protein-coupled receptors, the signal is transmitted sequentially through an array of proteins including Ras, MAP kinase kinase kinases (Raf, MEK kinase, Mos), and MAP kinase kinase (MEK). MAP kinases are then phosphorylated on the tyrosine and threonine residues by dual-specificity kinase MEK. The activated MAP kinases translocate to the nucleus where the signal is converted to change transcriptional activity. MAP kinase activation also leads to phosphorylation of various proteins including membrane receptors, other protein kinases, cytoskeletal proteins, and regulatory enzymes. ERK1 (extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1) and ERK2, known as 44- and 42 kDa-protein, respectively, were the first vertebrate MAP kinases to be described (7Ray L.B. Sturgill T.W. Proc. Natl.

Cancer Res. 1994; 63: 93-116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although ERK1 and ERK2 could be functionally redundant, it seems more likely that distinct patterns of gene expression impart specific biological role(s) to each ERK isoform in accordance with selective activation of the ERK isoforms; various stimuli selectively activate ERK2 in different cell contexts (14Bading H. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1991; 253: 912-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 15Baraban J.M. Fiore R.S. Sanghera J.S. Paddon H.B. Pelech S.L. J.

Studies examining the specificity of growth factor signaling have suggested that the duration of the MAPK cascade activation makes cells decide about proliferation versus differentiation (4Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4209) Google Scholar). Thus, proper regulation of Erk gene expression may be required for determining cell response by restricting the potential for activation of the corresponding cascade. However, little is known about the transcriptional regulation of ERKs. Early works have demonstrated an increased expression of ERK2 mRNA in the developing brain with concomitant change in the protein level (9Boulton T.G. Nye S.H. Robbins D.J. Ip N.Y. Radziejewska E. Morgenbesser S.D. DePinho R.A. Panayotatos N. Cobb M.H. Yancopoulos G.D. Cell. 1991; 65: 663-675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1473) Google Scholar). It was also shown that neuronal differentiation of P19 mouse embryonal carcinoma cells is associated with an increase in ERK2 mRNA (9Boulton T.G. Nye S.H. Robbins D.J. Ip N.Y. Radziejewska E. Morgenbesser S.D. DePinho R.A. Panayotatos N. Cobb M.H. Yancopoulos G.D. Cell. 1991; 65: 663-675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1473) Google Scholar). Analysis in cultured kidney mesangial cells has suggested that the regulation of theErk2 gene expression resembles that of an immediate early gene (23Schramek H. Sorokin A. Watson R.D. Dunn M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C40-C48Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To further elucidate the mechanisms that underlie these regulatable aspects of the Erk2 gene, we cloned the Erk2 gene and identified the promoter region. Determining the organization and promoter sequence of the Erk2 gene will enable a comparative analysis with those of the previously isolated mouse Erk1gene (24Pagès G. Stanley E.R. Le Gall M. Brunet A. Pouysségur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26986-26992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It would also help to investigate the possible occurrence of alternatively spliced transcripts that could give rise to different forms of ERK2 protein observed in human tissues (12Gonzalez F.A. Raden D.L. Rigby M.R. Davis R.J. FEBS Lett. 1992; 304: 170-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). A comparison of structural features between the genes for ERK1 and ERK2 might provide insights into evolution of these closely related kinase genes after gene duplication. In the present study, we determined the structure and 5′-flanking sequence of the mouse Erk2 gene and characterized its promoter. Restriction and modifying enzymes were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc., New England Biolabs, Inc., Promega Corp., and Boehringer Mannheim. Radiolabeled nucleotides and [14C]chloramphenicol were from NEN Life Science Products. Nested deletion kit was from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Cell culturing media were from Life Technologies, Inc. Bovine serum and fetal bovine serum were from JRH Biosciences. For Northern blot analysis, 5 μg of poly(A)+-rich RNA from mouse brain and lung were fractionated on a formaldehyde, 1% agarose denaturing gel and transferred to Hybond-N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Corp.). The blot was prehybridized in 50% formamide, 6 × SSPE, 1% SDS, 2 × Denhardt's solution and 100 μg/ml denatured herring sperm DNA at 42 °C for 3 h. Hybridization was performed at 42 °C for 10 h with 2 × 106 cpm of labeled probe/ml in the same solution as prehybridization except for omitting Denhardt's solution. Washing was carried out 3 times in 1 × SSC and 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 10 min and then in 0.1 × SSC and 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 45 min. The probe used was mouse ERK2 cDNA fragment (consisting of 60 bp of the 5′-untranslated region and 5′ 485 bp of the coding region; Ref. 25Her J.-H. Wu J. Rall T.B. Sturgill T.W. Weber M.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3743Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by the random primer method (26Feinberg A.P. Volgelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16562) Google Scholar); the N terminus coding region showed the least sequence homology between ERK1 and ERK2. Preliminary dot blot hybridization analysis confirmed that under this condition, the ERK2 cDNA probe hybridized with more than 1,000-fold selectivity toward ERK2 cDNA sequence over ERK1 cDNA sequence. Autoradiography was done at −80 °C with an intensifying screen for 3 days. A P1 clone isolated from a c129 mouse embryonic stem cell library was obtained from Genome Systems (St. Louis, MO). The PCR primers used for screening were PS-1U (5′-ACAAAGTTCGAGTTGCTATCA-3′) and PS-1D (5′-ATTGATGCCAATGATGTTCTC-3′) which amplify a 122-bp product between nucleotides 152 and 273 (translation start site as +1) of the mouse ERK2 cDNA sequence (25Her J.-H. Wu J. Rall T.B. Sturgill T.W. Weber M.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3743Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To obtain a higher yield of P1 plasmid DNA, the P1 plasmid inEscherichia coli NS3529 was transferred into the strain NS3516 by production of a P1 transducing phage (27Sternberg N. Smoller D. Braden T. Genet. Anal. Tech. Appl. 1994; 11: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). P1 plasmid was purified by the plasmid preparation method 1 suggested by the supplier. The clone 7278 P1 plasmid was subjected to restriction site mapping. A 4.5-kb EcoRI fragment containing the Erk2 gene 5′-flanking region was identified by probing the EcoRI digests with 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe U3 (5′-CGCGAAGCGTCGAACCGAAC-3′) which represents the 5′ extremity of the known mouse ERK2 cDNA sequence. Plasmid pBS-E4.5 was made by subcloning this fragment into pBluescript (Stratagene). To analyze the gene structure, blots of restriction digests of clone 7278 were hybridized either with end-labeled oligonucleotide probes designed according to the ERK2 cDNA sequence or with ERK2 cDNA fragments labeled by the random primer method. The exon-containing fragments were identified and subcloned for sequencing. The sizes of introns G and H were determined by PCR using U7 (5′-CATACCTGGAGCAGTATTATGAC-3′)-D1 (5′-CCACAATGCACACGACCGTC-3′) and U2 (5′-CCAGCCAGGATACAGATCT-3′)-D4 (5′-GCTGCTACTACCAGAAACTGC-3′) primer combinations, respectively. PCR was performed using 50 ng of P1 phage DNA as template with 30 cycles of 1-min denaturation at 94 °C, 45-s annealing at 60 °C, and 3-min extension at 72 °C. The PCR products were sequenced to verify the expected products. By a combination of subcloning at known restriction sites and the generation of a series of nested deletion clones (28Henikoff S. Gene ( Amst .). 1984; 28: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (2828) Google Scholar), genomic DNA fragments were sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method using a PRISM sequencing kit and the model 373A automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Total RNA was isolated from BALB/c mouse brain and lung using TRIzol LS RNA extraction reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Poly(A)+-rich RNA was prepared by one round of purification through an oligo(dT)-cellulose spin column (Pharmacia). Primer extension and S1 nuclease analyses were performed based on the protocol described by Sambrook et al. (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). For primer extension, oligonucleotides PE-1 (5′-GCCGCCGCCGCCGCGTTCGGTTCGACGCT-3′) and PE-2 (5′-GATCGGGAACGAGGAAGGAGGACAACACAG-3′), with their 3′ termini located 53 and 158 nucleotides upstream from the translation start site, respectively, were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP. Both of the primers (1 × 105 cpm of PE-1 or 2 × 105 cpm of PE-2) were hybridized with 5 μg of poly(A)+ RNA in 30 μl of hybridization buffer at 30 °C for 16 h. Primer extension was carried out in a total volume of 20 μl in 50 mm Tris/Cl (pH 8.3), 75 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm dNTPs, and 0.5 units/ml cloned ribonuclease inhibitor (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 200 units of Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 42 °C for 2 h. S1 analysis was performed with single-stranded DNA probe prepared as follows. Oligonucleotide PE-2 was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and extended on sense strand DNA of plasmid pBS-E4.5 with Klenow enzyme. The synthesized double-stranded DNA was digested with XbaI and fractionated on a 5% acrylamide, 8.3m urea denaturing gel. The desired probe fragment was eluted from the gel in 0.5 m NH4OAc, 10 mm Mg(OAc)2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, and 10 μg/ml tRNA at 37 °C for 12 h, followed by extraction with phenol/chloroform and ethanol precipitation. Five micrograms of poly(A)+ RNA was co-precipitated and hybridized with 4 × 104 cpm (approximately 2 fmol) of single-stranded DNA probe at 30 °C for 16 h. The hybrid was digested with 1,000 or 3,300 units/ml S1 nuclease (Boehringer Mannheim) at 37 °C for 30 min. After stopping the reaction, samples were precipitated with ethanol. The primer-extended and S1 nuclease-resistant fragments were resolved on a 5% acrylamide, 8.3 m urea gel concurrently with a sequencing ladder that was generated with the same end-labeled oligonucleotide (PE-1 or PE-2) as primer to locate the 3′ end of the products. Sequencing reaction was carried out using Sequenase version 2.0 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) with sense strand DNA of pBS-E4.5 as template. To evaluate promoter activity of the 5′-flanking sequence of the mouse Erk2 gene, a series of reporter plasmids were constructed in pCAT-Basic (Promega). As a positive control, pRSVCAT (30Gorman C.M. Merlino G.T. Willingham M.C. Pastan I. Howard B.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6777-6781Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar) was used. Plasmid pCAT-B-(−2425/+100) was constructed by inserting a 2523-bpSphI/NaeI fragment of pBS-E4.5 between theSphI/PstI sites (with PstI site blunted) of the pCAT-Basic polylinker. To construct pCAT-B-(−2425), which contains 2.6 kb of the 5′-flanking region immediately upstream of the translation start site, we generated a 570-bp PCR fragment encompassing nucleotides −338 to +223 with an additionalSalI site at its 3′ end. Primers used were as follows: 5′-primer, 5′-CTCAGGGGTCCCGTGGTTGGTGTG-3′; and 3′-primer, 5′-AGAGTCGACGTTGGCTGCACAGCCGCC-3′. Plasmid pBS-fl0.57 was made by subcloning this fragment into pBluescript, and the nucleotide sequence of the insert was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. Then pCAT-B-(−2425/+100) was digested with Eco47III andSalI and inserted with a 398-bp fragment, which was derived from the digestion of pBS-fl0.57 at the correspondingEco47III site and the SalI site to generate pCAT-B-(−2425) (number in parentheses with a construct represents the position of the 5′ end of the insert relative to the upstream major transcription start site). A series of 5′-deleted reporter plasmids was constructed using convenient restriction sites. Plasmid pCAT-B-(−2425) was cut with HindIII and filled with Klenow and then cut with AvaI, BstEII, SacI,DraIII, and NaeI to make pCAT-B-(−1156), pCAT-B-(−781), pCAT-B-(−542), pCAT-B-(−366), and pCAT-B-(+99), respectively. The linearized plasmid blunted the protruding end and was self-ligated. Plasmid pCAT-B-(−1235) was created by self-ligation ofHindIII-cut pCAT-B-(−2425). Other 5′-deleted plasmids contain EcoO109I/SalI (pCAT-B-(−219)),Eco47III/SalI (pCAT-B-(−174)),AatII/SalI (pCAT-B-(−147)),HinfI/SalI (pCAT-B-(−42)), andBglI/SalI (pCAT-B-(+20)) fragments derived from pBS-f10.57 (with their 5′ ends blunted) between the HindIII (blunted) and SalI sites of the pCAT-basic polylinker. All constructs were sequenced to verify the orientation and cloning junction of the insert. CHO-K1 cell was maintained in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Reporter constructs were transfected by the lipofection method using pFx-4 lipid (Invitrogen) according to the protocol recommended by the supplier. Briefly, 3 × 105 cells were seeded on 60-mm dishes 1 day before transfection. Using 15 μg of pFx-4, 4 μg of reporter construct was cotransfected with 1 μg of pCH110 (Pharmacia). The internal standard plasmid, pCH110, which bears the lacZgene under the control of SV40 early promoter, was included to normalize transfection efficiencies. Transfection was carried out for 4 h, and the medium was changed to the complete medium. After a 48-h incubation, the cells were harvested, and cell extracts were prepared in 1 × reporter lysis buffer (Promega). The cell extracts were assayed for CAT activity using a phase extraction method (31Seed B. Sheen J.-Y. Gene ( Amst .). 1988; 67: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar), and β-galactosidase activity of CHO cell extracts was determined using the colorimetric method as described (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). P19 mouse embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells were cultured in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 7.5% bovine serum and 2.5% fetal bovine serum (32Rudnicki M.A. McBurney M.W. Robertson E.J. Teratocarcinomas and Embryonic Stem Cells: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1987: 19-49Google Scholar). Activities of transfected reporter genes in undifferentiated and differentiated P19 cells were evaluated as follows. One day before transfection, 7 × 105undifferentiated P19 cells were seeded on 60-mm dishes. Transfection was carried out in serum-free medium (Opti-MEM, Life Technologies, Inc.) using 10 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) to introduce 1.8 μg of reporter construct and 0.6 μg of pCH110. After transfection for 6 h, cells were trypsinized and filtered through a 40-μm nylon mesh (Falcon 2340, Becton Dickinson) to remove undispersed cells. For undifferentiated cells, one-third of the cells was replated on 6-well culture plates and cultured without retinoic acid (RA). For induction of neural differentiation, the remainder of the cells was divided into two 35-mm bacterial grade Petri dishes (Falcon 1008, Becton Dickinson) and cultured in the presence of 1 μm all-trans-RA (Nacalai Tesque, Tokyo, Japan). After 24 h, the media of the undifferentiated and differentiated cultures were changed to fresh medium without or with RA, respectively. The undifferentiated cells were harvested 3 days after replating, and the differentiated cells were harvested 2 or 3 days after replating. The β-galactosidase activity of the P19 cell extracts was measured using the Galacto-Light Plus chemiluminescent assay system (Tropix) in a Berthold LB 9505 C luminometer. All determinations of enzymatic activities were performed within a linear range of the assay system. Previous experiments analyzing ERK2 mRNA transcripts have been performed using RNA isolated from rat (9Boulton T.G. Nye S.H. Robbins D.J. Ip N.Y. Radziejewska E. Morgenbesser S.D. DePinho R.A. Panayotatos N. Cobb M.H. Yancopoulos G.D. Cell. 1991; 65: 663-675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1473) Google Scholar) and human (12Gonzalez F.A. Raden D.L. Rigby M.R. Davis R.J. FEBS Lett. 1992; 304: 170-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) tissues. To characterize the mouse gene for ERK2, we examined an expression pattern of ERK2 mRNA by Northern hybridization analysis using poly(A)+ RNA from mouse tissues. Hybridization and washing of the blot were carried out under stringent conditions to avoid cross-hybridization of the ERK2 cDNA probe to the ERK1 transcripts. As has been reported by Boultonet al. (9Boulton T.G. Nye S.H. Robbins D.J. Ip N.Y. Radziejewska E. Morgenbesser S.D. DePinho R.A. Panayotatos N. Cobb M.H. Yancopoulos G.D. Cell. 1991; 65: 663-675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1473) Google Scholar), who used rat total RNAs, mouse ERK2 mRNA was expressed at much higher levels in brain than in the peripheral lung tissue (Fig. 1). In rat tissues, three distinct ERK2 transcripts were identified at different ratios among tissues. Similarly, multiple ERK2 mRNA transcripts were expressed in the human (12Gonzalez F.A. Raden D.L. Rigby M.R. Davis R.J. FEBS Lett. 1992; 304: 170-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, mouse ERK2 transcripts displayed several isoforms as do rat and human ERK2 transcripts. Four ERK2 transcripts, 8.1, 5.3, 3.1, and 2.3 kb in size, were found in brain. The lung transcripts showed a distinct pattern. The 8.1- and 5.3-kb transcripts were expressed at barely detectable amounts. In contrast, discrete transcripts of 3.6 and 3.0 kb were observed in the lung at higher levels. The 1.9-kb transcript was detected only in lung. These findings confirm that the characteristics of ERK2 mRNA transcripts, namely the abundance in brain and the tissue heterogeneity, are also observed in mouse tissues. We analyzed one P1 clone, which was isolated from a mouse embryonic stem cell P1 library by screening with PCR, and found it contained an 80-kb insert and covered all of the exons encoding the ERK2 protein sequence. Through a combination of restriction mapping, Southern blot, and sequencing analyses, the exon-intron organization of the Erk2 gene was elucidated as shown in Fig. 2 and Table I. The entire protein-coding sequence was identical to the reported cDNA sequence (25Her J.-H. Wu J. Rall T.B. Sturgill T.W. Weber M.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3743Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The gene spanned over 60 kb, and the protein-coding region was divided into eight exons. Exon 1 consisted of approximately 220 bp of the 5′-untranslated region and 113 bp of the coding sequence. Exon 8 contained the 3′-coding and untranslated region. The nucleotide sequences of the exon-intron boundaries (Table I) conformed to the consensus sequence for splice donor and acceptor sites (GT-AG rule; Ref. 33Senapathy P. Shapiro M.B. Harris N.L. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 183: 252-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Internal exons ranged in size from 110 to 190 bp. Introns ranged from 0.2 kb (intron E) to the large 32 kb (intron A). In the coding sequence, positions of the splice junctions were in good agreement with those of the previously cloned Erk1 gene (24Pagès G. Stanley E.R. Le Gall M. Brunet A. Pouysségur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26986-26992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), except the intron D splicing site. The 5′ splice site of intron D was shifted by one nucleotide toward intron D. A 4.5-kbEcoRI genomic fragment containing the 5′-flanking region of the Erk2 gene was identified by Southern analysis and subcloned into pBluescript as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The plasmid, pBS-E4.5, was used for further analysis of the 5′-flanking region.Table IExon-intron boundary sequences of the mouse Erk2 geneNo.Exon sizeBoundary sequencesIntron size5′ boundary 3′ boundarybpkb1.336/332GGTTTG gt gagt...tttt ag CTCTGCA322.183AGATGT gt atcc...acac ag ATATATB2.23.190CTCAAG gt cagc...cctt ag ATCTGTC4.94.117TCCAAG gt aaga...ttgc ag GGTTATD1.55.115TCCTGG gt aagc...tgat ag GTATTCE0.2186.132CCAAAG gt aaga...ttgt ag CTCTGGF107.110GATGAG gt aaga...ttaa ag CCCATTG2.98.126GGTCAG gt atct...tttc ag GACAAGH5.2Exon sequences are shown in uppercase letters and intron sequences in lowercase letters. Open table in a new tab Exon sequences are shown in uppercase letters and intron sequences in lowercase letters. To determine the transcription start site(s) of the Erk2 gene, primer extension analysis and S1 nuclease protection assay were performed in combination. For primer extension analysis, two radiolabeled oligonucleotides were used in the extension reaction. First extension analysis used oligonucleotide PE-1, which is proximal to the translation start site (complementary to bases −25 to −53, the adenine residue of the ATG start codon is referred to as +1), as a primer. When extension was carried out with poly(A)+ RNA from mouse brain, three major products were observed at bases −219, −223, and −330, with minor products at −205, −208, −226, and −278 (Fig. 3 A). In the reaction using lung poly(A)+ RNA, the product at −330 was not observed. In the second extension reaction employing the distal primer PE-2 (complementary to bases −129 to −158), the extended products terminated at two major sites, −219 and −223, and three minor sites, −205, −208, and −226 (Fig. 3 B). The reactions with brain and lung poly(A)+ RNA gave the same products, and the sites coincided with those of the reaction using PE-1. The two longer products obtained"

Caulobacter crescentus is a dimorphic, Gram-negative bacterium with a well defined cell cycle that generates two different daughter cells, a motile swarmer cell with a single polar flagellum and a nonmotile stalked cell. Formation of the new swarmer cell and its subsequent differentiation into a stalked cell result from a series of discrete morphogenic events, including flagellar biosynthesis, flagellum rotation, loss of motility, and stalk formation at one pole during the cell cycle (reviewed in Refs. 1Brun Y.V.

Early experiments demonstrated that this sequence of developmental events depends onde novo RNA synthesis (3Newton A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 447-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and suggested that differential gene transcription, presumably involving RNA polymerase and its accessory proteins, plays a central role in regulating the developmental program. Bacterial RNA polymerases (RNAP) 1The abbreviations used are: RNAP, RNA polymerase; E, core polymerase; Eς, holoenzyme; nt, nucleotide; bp, base pair; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. are multi-subunit enzyme complexes that can be purified as the core polymerase (E) and the holoenzyme (Eς; reviewed in Refs. 4Chamberlin M.

The core RNAP, composed of the α2, β, and β′ subunits, carries out RNA chain elongation, whereas the holoenzyme, which also contains the sigma subunit (ς), recognizes specific promoter sequences. Multiple sigma factors with unique promoter specificities have been identified in many eubacteria, and the use of alternative sigma subunits is a fundamental mechanism for reprogramming RNAP specificity and controlling complex patterns of gene transcription (reviewed in Refs.6Helmann J.D. Chamberlin M.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 839-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar, 7Stragier P. Losick R. Mol.

The most extensive study of transcription regulation in C. crescentus has been carried out on the genes in the flagellar gene hierarchy (reviewed in Ref. 9Wu J. Newton A. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Flagellum formation requires the temporally controlled transcription of approximately 50 genes (10Ely B. Ely T.W. Genetics. 1989; 123: 649-654Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that are organized in a regulatory hierarchy containing four classes of genes (I to IV). The Class II genes, which are expressed early in the cell cycle and encode basal body and switch components, contain a unique promoter consensus. Recent results have shown that transcription from the Class II promoters is regulated in vivo by the response regulator CtrA (11Quon K.C. Marczynski G.T. Shapiro L. Cell. 1996; 84: 83-93Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). The class II gene products are required, in turn, for transcription of class III and class IV genes that are transcribed from ς54-dependent promoters late in the cell cycle. The ς54 factor and transcription activator FlbD, which are encoded by Class II genes rpoN andflbD, are required for transcription of the Class III and IV genes (reviewed in Ref. 9Wu J. Newton A. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies of transcription in vitro have employed either the Eς54 holoenzyme reconstituted from purifiedEscherichia coli components (12Ninfa A. Magasanik B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Genet. 1995; 246: 697-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and ς32 (16Wu J. Newton A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2094-2101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have now been overexpressed in E. coli and purified, the lack of a purified core RNAP has prevented the reconstitution of a transcription system exclusively from purified C. crescentuscomponents. In addition, the principal C. crescentus sigma factor, which is required for transcription from the housekeeping promoters (19Malakooti J. Wang S.P. Ely B. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4372-4376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and predicted to contain 653 amino acids with a molecular mass of 72,623 Da (ς73; 20), had not been isolated. We report here the first purification and characterization of theC. crescentus core RNAP, as well as the two holoenzymes Eς73 and Eς32. We also describe the purification of the C. crescentus principal sigma factor, ς73, after overexpression of rpoD in E. coli. The Eς73, Eς54, and Eς32 holoenzymes have been reconstituted exclusively from purified C. crescentus proteins, and the transcriptional specificity of these RNAP preparations has been examined. The availability of a defined, reconstituted transcription system will allow detailed analysis of the roles of RNAP and accessory factors in the transcriptional regulation of developmental genes during cell differentiation and division in this bacterium. E. colistrain DH5α was used for propagating plasmids and cultured in ML medium supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) or tetracycline (10 μg/ml) as necessary. C. crescentus wild-type strain CB15 (ATCC19089) was used for the purification of RNAP and grown in PYE (peptone yeast extract; Ref. 21Ely B. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 372-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar) medium at the fermentation facility of the Waksman Institute. Restriction enzymes were purchased from either New England Biolabs or Boehringer Mannheim. T4 DNA ligase and T4 DNA polymerase were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. [α-32P]UTP was obtained from Amersham Corp. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by the Princeton University SynSeq facility. Heparin-agarose, single-stranded DNA-cellulose, and DEAE-cellulose were purchased from Bio-Rad. Poly[d(A-T)] was purchased from Sigma. E. coli core RNAP was purchased from Epicentre Technologies. Most procedures of the purification are based on the methods described by Burgess and Jendrisak (22Burgess R.R. Jendrisak J.J. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 4634-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). All steps were carried out at 4 °C unless noted otherwise. A block of 100 g of frozen C. crescentuscells were broken into small pieces and placed in a 1-liter Warring Blender with 300 ml of grinding buffer (0.05 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 5% (v/v) glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.233m NaCl, 23 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 130 μg/ml lysozyme). The cells were blended to allow lysis and shearing of the DNA. The sample was diluted with 500 ml of TGED (0.02m Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 mmEDTA, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol) + 0.2 m NaCl, blended, and then centrifuged for 30–40 min at 7000 rpm. The supernatant was collected as crude extract. Crude extract was precipitated with Polymin P at a final concentration of 0.3% and centrifuged at 7000 rpm in Sorvall to collect the pellet. Proteins were eluted from the pellet with TGED + 1 m NaCl after washing the pellet once with TGED + 0.2 m NaCl. The Polymin P extract was then precipitated with ammonium sulfate at 50% saturation. The pellet obtained after centrifugation was resuspended in TGED and dialyzed twice against TGED + 50 mm NaCl. Dialyzed sample was subjected to column chromatography as follows. It was first applied to a heparin-agarose column pre-equilibrated with TGED + 50 mm NaCl and eluted with a NaCl gradient of 50–600 mm in TGED. Fractions were examined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and peak fractions containing RNA polymerase (ββ′ and α subunits), as visualized by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 1 A), pooled and dialyzed as above. Dialyzed peak fractions were further purified on a DEAE-cellulose column by fractionating with a linear NaCl gradient of 50–600 mm. After dialysis, the pooled peak fractions (Fig. 1 B) were finally fractionated on a single-stranded DNA cellulose column also with a linear NaCl gradient of 50–600 mm. Two peak fractions, peak 1 and peak 2 (Fig. 1 C), were pooled separately and dialyzed against storage buffer (TGED + 0.05m NaCl with 50% (v/v) glycerol). The dialyzed enzyme preparations were aliquoted and stored at −80 °C for future use. Samples of RNAP holoenzyme were applied to SDS-PAGE gels (10% acrylamide), and after staining with KCl the gel was sectioned into 8 slices corresponding to the positions of visible proteins. Proteins were eluted from the gel slices, and SDS was removed by acetone precipitation, dissolved in 6 m guanidine HCl, and renatured, as described by Hager and Burgess (23Hager D.A. Burgess R.R. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 109: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). Plasmid pNEO containing the promoter of neomycin phosphotransferase neo gene was constructed by cloning theHindIII/BglII fragment of transposon Tn5 (24Beck E. Ludwig E.A. Auerswald B. Reiss B. Schaller H. Gene ( Amst .). 1982; 19: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar, 25Jorgenson R.A. Rothstein S. Reznikoff W.S. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1979; 177: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) in pUC18 restricted with HindIII andBamHI. The linear fragment obtained by restricting withHindIII and EcoRI was used as a template in thein vitro transcription experiment, and the length of the expected transcript is 84 nucleotides (Fig. 2). The fragment containing the lacUV5 promoter-operator region of E. coli lac gene was cloned from the expression vector pINIIA2 (26Masui Y. Coleman J. Inouye M. Experimental Manipulation of Gene Expression.in: Inouye M. Academic Press, New York1983Google Scholar) as a 305-bp HinfI/BamHI fragment. The DNA fragment from plasmid pINIIA2 was subcloned into pUC18 to yield plasmid pLACUV5. The DNA template was obtained from pLACUV5 with HindIII and BamHI that should produce a 79-nt transcript (Fig. 2; 26). Plasmid pAKC8 was constructed as described previously (13Wu J. Benson A.K. Newton A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3241-3250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fljKtranscription start site lies 451 bp upstream of the T7 terminator site (Fig. 2). Supercoiled plasmid DNA was used in the one-cycle transcription assay to determine the ς54 activity (13Wu J. Benson A.K. Newton A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3241-3250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pJW012 containing the dnaKP1 ς32-dependent promoter has been described previously (16Wu J. Newton A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2094-2101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The SacI/SalI DNA fragment was used as template in the run-off transcription assay to test the ς32 activity. Plasmid pSSA41 was a gift of John Smit. TheHindIII/ClaI DNA fragment containing thersaA gene promoter was inserted intoHindIII/AccI sites of pUC19. TheHindIII/NarI fragment from this plasmid was used as template in the run-off transcription assay to determine the ς73 activity. A 600-bpHindIII/BamHI fragment containing the C. crescentus pleC gene promoter was subcloned intoHindIII and BamHI sites of pBluescript to yield plasmid pJW014. The 636-bp HindIII/SalI fragment from this plasmid was used as a DNA template in the run-off transcription assay to test the ς73 activity. The formation of open complexes at different promoters from C. crescentus andE. coli was measured in single cycle or run-off transcription assays, as described previously (13Wu J. Benson A.K. Newton A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3241-3250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Wu J. Newton A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2094-2101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The RNA polymerase holoenzymes were reconstituted by the addition of purifiedC. crescentus sigma factors to the purified C. crescentus core RNA polymerase (final concentration of 1 nmol) and incubated for 10 min at 4 °C. Transcripts obtained were fractionated on 7 m urea-PAGE with end-labeled Sau3A fragments of pUC18 as DNA size markers and visualized by autoradiography. The core RNAP activity was determined using poly[d(A-T)] as template based on the method described by Berget al. (27Berg D. Barrett K. Chamberlin M. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 21: 506-519Crossref Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Each reaction of a 100-μl volume contained 20 μl of assay solution (200 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm MgCl2, and 50 mmβ-mercaptoethanol), 100 μm ATP, 10 μmUTP, and 5 μCi of [α-32P]UTP. RNA synthesis was initiated by adding RNA polymerase and terminated after 10 min at 37 °C with 3 ml of ice-cold 3.5% perchloric acid containing 0.1m sodium pyrophosphate. The precipitates were collected on Whatman cellulose filter paper (3MM) and washed three times with cold 1m HCl containing 0.1 m sodium pyrophosphate and finally with cold ethanol. The radioactivity on the dry filter was determined by scintillation counting. The cloned rpoDgene was identified and cloned 2G. Ramakrishnan and A. Newton, unpublished observations. by colony hybridization to its Myxococcus xanthus homologue (28Inouye S. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 80-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DNA sequence on analysis confirmed that the open reading frame in this recombinant plasmid was identical to that published for the C. crescentus rpoD gene (20Malakooti J. Ely B. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6854-6860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A SmaI-SstI DNA fragment from plasmid pGIR210, which contains the rpoD gene, was subcloned into the mutagenesis vector pAlter-1 (Promega), and anNdeI restriction site was introduced at the first codon ATG of the rpoD gene open reading frame by site-directed mutagenesis. The 2.7-kilobase pairs NdeI-HindIII DNA fragment was then subcloned into the NdeI andHindIII sites of the expression vector pRSET(A) to yield plasmid pJW41 in which the entire open reading frame of rpoDgene is translationally fused to the first codon of the T7 gene 10.E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) carrying the plasmid pJW41 was used to overproduce ς73 protein in the presence of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The overexpressed ς73 protein was purified by a previously described method (29Gribskov M. Burgess R. Gene ( Amst .). 1983; 26: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 30Igarashi K. Ishihama A. Cell. 1991; 65: 1015-1022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The RpoD protein was not soluble and formed inclusion bodies that were solubilized with 6 mguanidine HCl in TGED buffer. The solubilized protein was renatured by dialysis against the TGED buffer and then further purified by chromatography on a DEAE-cellulose column. This method yielded ς73 protein that was greater than 95% pure, as judged by Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-PAGE gels. Cellular RNAP from C. crescentus was purified by fractionation of cell extracts with Polymin P, ammonium sulfate precipitation, and chromatography on heparin-agarose (Fig. 1 A) and DEAE-cellulose (Fig. 1 B), which removed many of the contaminating proteins. Peak fractions from the DEAE-cellulose column containing the RNAP β, β′, and α subunits were pooled and applied to a single-stranded DNA-cellulose column (Fig. 1 C). As shown in Fig. 1 C, the majority of the RNAP β, β′, and α subunits eluted in two distinct peaks along with several minor proteins. The fractions in peaks 1 and 2 were pooled separately (“Materials and Methods”). We assayed RNAP activity in peak 1 and peak 2 usingE. coli DNA templates containing either the ς70-dependent neo promoter or thelacUV5 promoter (Fig. 2; “Materials and Methods”). Both of these promoters are recognizedin vivo by C. crescentus 3N. Ohta, J. Wu, and A. Newton, unpublished observations. (see below). A third DNA template (Fig. 2) contained the ς32-dependent, dnaKP1 heat-shock promoter of C. crescentus (31Gomes S.L. Gober J.W. Shapiro L. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 176: 3051-3059Crossref Google Scholar). The RNAP preparation from peak 2 recognized all three promoters, and specific transcripts of the predicted sizes were obtained from each template (Fig. 3, lanes 2, 4, and6). Thus the peak 2 preparation contained ς32holoenzyme (Eς32) and ς73 holoenzyme (Eς73) activities. No detectable transcripts were observed when the RNAP preparation from peak 1 was assayed using the same DNA templates (Fig. 3, lanes 1, 3, and 5). These data suggest the possibility that peak 1 contained either inactive RNAP holoenzyme or only core RNAP. We assayed for RNAP core activity directly in an in vitro transcription assay using poly[d(A-T)] as template as described by Berg et al. (27Berg D. Barrett K. Chamberlin M. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 21: 506-519Crossref Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The results summarized in Table Iindicate that both peak 1 and peak 2 contained active core polymerase, although the specific activity was ∼3-fold higher in the peak 2 RNAP. Interestingly, peak 2 RNAP was also more active on the poly[d(A-T)] template than purified E. coli core polymerase.Table ICore RNA polymerase activities assayed on poly [d(A-T)] templatesRNAP1-aC. crescentus peak 1 and peak 2 RNAPs are pools of fractions shown in Fig. 1 C, as described under “Results.”Specific activityActivity relative to E. coli coreunit 1-bUnit definition: as described under Epicentre Technologies, one unit catalyzed the incorporation of 1 nmol of ribonucleotide triphosphate into RNA in 10 min at 37 °C. /mgPeak 1 RNAP1.1 × 1040.5Peak 2 RNAP3.8 × 1041.7E. colicore2.2 × 1041.01-a C. crescentus peak 1 and peak 2 RNAPs are pools of fractions shown in Fig. 1 C, as described under “Results.”1-b Unit definition: as described under Epicentre Technologies, one unit catalyzed the incorporation of 1 nmol of ribonucleotide triphosphate into RNA in 10 min at 37 °C. Open table in a new tab We next examined if the peak 1 RNAP core preparation could be reconstituted to give active holoenzyme. C. crescentusς54 protein was used in the initial reconstitution experiments because earlier work had demonstrated that Eς54 RNAP holoenzyme reconstituted from E. coli RNAP core and purified C. crescentusς54 specifically recognizes ς54-dependent promoters from both E. coli and C. crescentus (14Anderson D.K. Ohta N. Wu J. Newton A. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1995; 246: 697-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The reconstituted Eς54 holoenzyme also required the activator protein FlbD for initiation of transcription from C. crescentusς54-dependent promoters, as had been observed both in vitro and in vivo (13Wu J. Benson A.K. Newton A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3241-3250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The work described here demonstrates that in the presence of C. crescentus ς54 and FlbD, the purified RNAP preparation from peak 1 specifically recognized the ς54-dependent fljK promoter and produces a transcript of the expected size from this template (Fig. 2and Fig. 4, lanes 2 and4). This result confirms that peak 1 fractions contain an active RNAP core enzyme that can be used for assays of sigma factor activity. In the absence of added ς54, however, RNAP in neither peak 1 nor peak 2 recognized the fljK promoter (Fig. 4, lanes 1 and 3), indicating that none of these fractions contained an active Eς54 holoenzyme. Consequently, we refer to the peak 1 pool as core RNAP. The peak 2 pool, which appears to contain the Eς73 and Eς32 holoenzymes (Fig. 3), as well as excess core RNAP (see below), we refer to as peak 2 RNAP. Individual proteins in the peak 2 RNAP preparation (Fig. 1 C; peak 2 pool) were isolated after electrophoresis on preparative SDS-PAGE gels as described by Hager and Burgess (23Hager D.A. Burgess R.R. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 109: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). The gel was sectioned into 8 slices corresponding to the positions of bands visualized with KCl, with slice 1 containing bands at the top of the gel. Proteins were eluted from the gel slices, and a portion of each eluted protein sample was then analyzed on a second SDS-PAGE gel (Fig. 5). The peak 2 RNAP preparation contained several proteins in addition to core subunits β and β′ isolated from slice 1 and α isolated from slice 4. Potential sigma factors were the 75-kDa protein in slice 2 and the 34-kDa protein in slice 5. Unidentified proteins A and B of molecular masses ∼55 and 50 kDa, respectively, were found in slice 3, and a third unknown protein C of ∼28 kDa was detected in slice 6. A portion of the proteins eluted from the SDS-PAGE gel slices were renatured (see “Materials and Methods”) and combined with C. crescentus core RNAP (peak 1) to determine their ability to direct transcription. Assay of the 34-kDa protein renatured from gel slice 5 (Fig. 5) on the dnaK P1 template produced a run-off transcript of the expected size (62 nt; Fig. 2), which is consistent with the identification of this protein as the ς32 factor (16Wu J. Newton A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2094-2101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When renatured proteins from gel slices 1–8 were assayed individually in the presence of the peak 1 core RNAP using theneo template, a run-off transcript was detected only in the assay containing proteins from slice 2 (Fig. 6). This transcript was of the size expected (84 nt; Fig. 2) from the ς70-dependent neo promoter. A transcript of the same size was produced by peak 2 RNAP but not by peak 1 core RNAP alone (Fig. 6). No transcriptional activity was detected by proteins eluted from slice 2 when they were assayed with peak 1 core RNAP on DNA templates with ς32- or ς54-dependent promoters. 4J. Wu and A. Newton, unpublished observations. These results indicate that the 75-kDa protein isolated from peak 2 RNAP preparation specifically recognized the E. coli housekeeping promoters and is a functional homologue of the E. coli principal sigma factor, ς70. Micro-sequencing of this protein yielded the amino-terminal sequence (M)NNSSAETE, which is identical to that of the translated DNA sequence of the C. crescentus rpoD gene (20Malakooti J. Ely B. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6854-6860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To further characterize the principal C. crescentus sigma factor identified in the reconstitution experiments (Fig. 6), we overexpressed the rpoD gene inE. coli and purified the full-length ς73protein to near-homogeneity (see “Materials and Methods”; Fig. 7 A; lane 3). The C. crescentus rpoD gene has been shown to encode a predicted polypeptide of 653 amino acids with a molecular mass of 72,623 Da and designed as ς73 (20Malakooti J. Ely B. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6854-6860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The size of the overexpressed protein (Fig. 7 A, lane 3) is similar to the very faint protein band at ∼75-kDa in the peak 2 RNAP preparation (Fig. 7 A, lane 2) and close to the predicted 72,623-Da size of the rpoD gene product (20Malakooti J. Ely B. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6854-6860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The purified protein was also examined by Western blot analysis. An anti-E. coli ς70 antibody cross-reacted with the major protein band at ∼75 kDa, as well as with several smaller bands that presumably result from proteolysis of RpoD (Fig. 7 B, lane 3). The anti-ς70 antibody can also recognize the protein at ∼75 kDa present in the peak 2 RNAP (Fig. 7 B, lane 2) but failed to recognize any proteins in the peak 1 RNAP preparation (Fig. 7 B, lane 1). These results further support our assignment of peak 1 as core enzyme and the 75-kDa protein present in the peak 2 RNAP as ς73. The ς73 present in the peak 2 RNAP (Fig. 7 B, lane 2) displays a slightly different mobility from that overproduced from the C. crescentus rpoD gene in E. coli (Fig. 7 B, lane 3), perhaps as a result of ς73 modification in one of the bacteria. We examined the sigma factor activity of the purifiedrpoD gene product in reconstitution experiments with core RNAP using in vitro transcription assays (Fig. 8). Purified ς73 protein directed transcription from the ς70-dependent promoter of E. coli neo gene in the presence of peak 1 core RNAP (Fig. 8, lane 2), whereas the core enzyme alone did not (Fig. 8, lanes 1). These results and those in Fig. 6demonstrate that the C. crescentus RpoD protein isolated either from the peak 2 RNAP preparation or E. coli cells overexpressing the cloned the C. crescentus rpoD gene recognizes E. coli ς70-dependent promoters, suggesting that the C. crescentusς73 is a functional homologue of the principal E. coli sigma factor ς70. We next examined the ability of purified ς73 to confer transcriptional specificity in the recognition of two promoters,rsaA (32Fisher J.A. Smit J. Agabian N. J.

Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4372-4376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both of these C. crescentuspromoters have been characterized in vivo (19Malakooti J. Wang S.P. Ely B. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4372-4376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and shown to contain a −35 consensus sequence similar to that in E. coliand a −10 consensus divergent from that in E. coli. ThersaA and pleC promoters were recognized in thein vitro transcription assays by the reconstituted Eς73 holoenzyme (Fig. 8, lanes 4 and6). The more efficient transcription from the neopromoter in these experiments (Fig. 8, lane 2) is consistent with measurements of promoter strength in vivo using transcription fusions. β-Galactosidase assays of C. crescentus wild-type strains carrying either theneop-lacZ (6876 Miller units) or the rsaAp-lacZ(1545 Miller units) fusions indicates that the neo promoter is 4- to 5-fold stronger than the rsaA promoter under these conditions.4 The sizes of the rsaA and pleC transcripts observed in vitro (Fig. 8) were those expected from the transcription start sites mapped in vivo for the two genes,i.e. 110 and 62 nt, respectively (Fig. 2; Ref. 19Malakooti J. Wang S.P. Ely B. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4372-4376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transcription initiation was RpoD-dependent, since the peak 1 core RNAP alone did not recognize either promoter (Fig. 8,lanes 3 and 5). These results confirm that the purified rpoD gene product, ς73, is the principal C. crescentus sigma factor and that it is capable of recognizing the C. crescentus housekeeping gene promoters, as well as E. coliς70-dependent promoters. Many developmental events in C. crescentus are dependent on differential gene expression regulated at the level of transcription. Unlike Bacillus subtilis, where an extensive cast of alternative sigma factors and regulatory proteins governing sporulation have been identified through genetic and biochemical analysis (reviewed in Ref. 8Haldenwang W.G. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 1-30Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a defined in vitrotranscription system has not been available in C. crescentus. The purification of C. crescentus RNAP was described in early studies (35Amemiya K. Wu C.W. Shapiro L. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4157-4165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Cheung K.K. Newton A. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 2254-2261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but the transcriptional specificity of these enzyme preparations was not characterized. More recently, a partially purified RNAP preparation was used for the study of class II flagellar gene regulation (15Benson A.K. Ramakrishnan G. Ohta N. Feng J. Ninfa A. Newton A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4989-4993Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, this is the first report of the purification and resolution of the holoenzymes and core RNAP and the reconstitution of RNAP holoenzymes exclusively fromC. crescentus components. Heparin-agarose chromatography, which has been used successfully for isolation of RNA polymerase from a number of bacterial species, including E. coli, B. subtilis, B. stearothermophilus,Lactobacillus casei, L. plantarum, and Clostridium pasteurianum (reviewed in Ref. 4Chamberlin M. Kingston R. Gilman M. Wiggs J. deVera A. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 540-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), provided a great enrichment ofC. crescentus RNAP (Fig. 1 A). Chromatography on single-stranded DNA agarose (37Nusslein C. Heyden B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1972; 47: 282Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) or on phosphocellulose (38Gonzalez N. Wiggs J. Chamberlin M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 182: 404Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) has also been reported to resolve E. coli holoenzyme and core RNAP. In our hands single-stranded DNA-cellulose chromatography was crucial for resolving C. crescentus RNAP into its core and holoenzyme fractions (Fig. 3 C). Phosphocellulose and Bio-Rex 70 were not effective in resolving core and holoenzyme, although these earlier attempts were hampered by the lack of a purified sigma factor to assay for core activity. 5N. Ohta, A. Ninfa, and A. Newton, unpublished observations. The fact that the first peak from the DNA-cellulose column (peak 1; Fig. 1 C) contained active core RNAP and the second peak (peak 2; Fig. 1 C) contained Eς32 and Eς73 holoenzymes, as well as core RNAP (see below), was demonstrated by in vitro transcription assays of the pooled fractions (Fig. 3; Table I) and the isolation of active ς32 and ς73 from these RNAP fractions of peak 2 (Fig. 6; 16). In the presence of purified C. crescentus ς54 and its activator protein FlbD, core RNAP from peak 1 recognized the ς54-dependent promoter of the C. crescentus flagellin gene fljK(Fig. 4), as observed previously for a heterologous holoenzyme containing either C. crescentus ς54 orE. coli ς54 and the E. coli core RNAP (13Wu J. Benson A.K. Newton A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3241-3250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Anderson D.K. Ohta N. Wu J. Newton A. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1995; 246: 697-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 15Benson A.K. Ramakrishnan G. Ohta N. Feng J. Ninfa A. Newton A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4989-4993Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Therefore, C. crescentus core RNAP appears to function interchangeably with its E. coli counterpart in this transcription assay. Our purified peak 2 RNAP preparation displayed activity only on ς32- and ς73-dependent promoters. Possible explanations for the failure to recover active Eς54 include (i) an unstable ς54 protein that is inactivated during purification and (ii) low affinity of ς54 for binding to core RNAP, which results in its dissociation from the core and loss early in protein fractionation. Consistent with the latter possibility are two observations. First, some bacterial RNAP holoenzymes are quite unstable and dissociate early during procedures suitable for isolation of other RNAP holoenzymes (39Hunt T.P. Magasanik B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8453-8457Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), and second, full-length E. coli ς54 does not bind to E. coli core RNAP tightly (40Lesley S.A. Brow M.A.D. Burgess R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2632-2638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Three proteins (Fig. 5; bands A, B, and C) of unknown function are also associated with the RNAP holoenzyme fractions. These proteins could represent additional sigma factors, breakdown products of ς73, other RNAP subunits, such as delta or omega, or proteins that fortuitously fractionate with RNAP. Protein C (Fig. 5), like ς32 (16Wu J. Newton A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2094-2101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and ς73, has been isolated and subjected to amino acid sequencing, but unlike the latter two proteins, there is no similarity of its amino-terminal amino acid sequence to any sequences deposited in GeneBank.4 It will be interesting to determine whether any of these three proteins, A, B, and C, are RNAP subunits or accessory proteins that are involved in transcriptional regulation. The relative amounts of ς73 and ς32 as visualized by the intensity of staining in SDS-PAGE gels displayed variability depending on the purified preparation examined, but we estimated that pooled peak 2 RNAP contained less than 0.4 mol eq of total ς factor relative to the core subunits (see Fig. 5). This result suggests that peak 2 RNAP also contains core enzyme. Consistent with the presence of excess core in the peak 2 RNAP fractions was the stimulation of transcription from the ς54-dependent fljK promoter by the addition of purified ς54 and FlbD to the peak 2 pool (Fig. 4) and the high activity of this RNAP pool when assayed on the poly[d(A-T)] template (Table I). The above results raise the question of why the core enzyme elutes from the single-stranded DNA column in two peaks. One possibility is that the more active core enzyme (Table I) binds more tightly to the column and elutes with the holoenzymes in peak 2. Alternatively, the core eluted in peak 2 could represent core that has bound tightly as the holoenzyme from which sigma factors elute at lower salt concentrations than the other polymerases in those complexes. Whatever the explanation of this fractionation, our experiments have depended critically on the isolation of the functional core RNAP. The inability to resolve different RNAP holoenzymes from one another5 prompted us initially to overexpress and purify C. crescentus ς factors, including ς54 (14Anderson D.K. Ohta N. Wu J. Newton A. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1995; 246: 697-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), ς32 (16Wu J. Newton A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2094-2101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and ς73 (Fig. 7) for the reconstitution of specific RNAP holoenzymes reported in this study. C. crescentus recognizes E. coliς70-dependent promoters in vivo(20Malakooti J. Ely B. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6854-6860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and our results demonstrate that the purified (Figs. 3 and 6) and reconstituted (Fig. 8) C. crescentus Eς73efficiently recognized the lacUV5 and neopromoters from E. coli, as well as promoters of the C. crescentus housekeeping genes rsaA and pleC(Fig. 8). The −35 consensus sequence of the C. crescentusbiosynthetic and housekeeping gene promoters (19Malakooti J. Wang S.P. Ely B. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4372-4376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is similar to the −35 consensus of E. coliς70-dependent promoters, but the −10 sequences from these two bacteria align only poorly. Moreover, theC. crescentus −10 and −35 sequences are more closely spaced than in most E. coli promoters (19Malakooti J. Wang S.P. Ely B. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4372-4376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that the principal C. crescentus sigma factor ς73 has less promoter specificity than its E. coli counterpart ς70. The availability of core RNAP from C. crescentus and the capability of reconstituting active holoenzymes using purified ς factors will permit biochemical analysis of gene regulation in vitro in great detail. These reagents will also be important in studying the role of RNAP and accessory factors in the temporal and spatial regulation of developmental gene transcription during the cell division and differentiation. We thank G. Ramakrishnan for the original isolation of the C. crescentus rpoD gene used in this study. We also thank R. R. Burgess for providing anti-E. coliς70 antibody, S. Inouye for the M. xanthus rpoD clone, and J. Smit for plasmid pSSA41 containing thersaA promoter."
