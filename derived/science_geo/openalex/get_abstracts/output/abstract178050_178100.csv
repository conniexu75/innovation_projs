Aβ·Cu complexes generate neurotoxic H2O2 from O2 through Cu2+ reduction, but the reaction mechanism has been unclear. We now report that Aβ1–42, when binding up to 2 eq of Cu2+, generates the H2O2catalytically by recruiting biological reducing agents as substrates under conditions where the Cu2+ or reducing agents will not form H2O2 themselves. Cholesterol is an important substrate for this activity, as are vitamin C,l-DOPA, and dopamine (V maxfor dopamine = 34.5 nm/min, K m = 8.9 μm). The activity was inhibited by anti-Aβ antibodies, Cu2+ chelators, and Zn2+. Toxicity of Aβ in neuronal culture was consistent with catalytic H2O2 production. Aβ was not toxic in cell cultures in the absence of Cu2+, and dopamine (5 μm) markedly exaggerated the neurotoxicity of 200 nm Aβ1–42·Cu. Therefore, microregional catalytic H2O2 production, combined with the exhaustion of reducing agents, may mediate the neurotoxicity of Aβ in Alzheimer's disease, and inhibitors of this novel activity may be of therapeutic value. β-Amyloid (Aβ) 1–42, implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, forms an oligomeric complex that binds copper at a CuZn superoxide dismutase-like binding site.

Aβ1–40 is the major soluble species (1Vigo-Pelfrey C. Lee D. Keim P. Lieberburg I. Schenk D.B. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 1965-1968Google Scholar), and Aβ1–42 is a minor species but is enriched in plaque amyloid (2Masters C.L. Multhaup G. Simms G. Pottgiesser J. Martins R.N. Beyreuther K. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2757-2763Google Scholar). Familial AD-linked mutations of amyloid protein precursor, presenilin-1 and presenilin-2, increase the concentration of Aβ1–42 (3Suzuki N. Cheung T.T.

Aβ1–42 is toxic in primary neuronal culture at μm concentrations (4Yankner B.A. Duffy L.K. Kirschner D.A. Science. 1990; 250: 279-282Google Scholar), by an unclear mechanism likely to be mediated by reactive oxygen species generation (5Behl C. Davis J.B. Lesley R. Schubert D.

We recently reported that Aβ binds Cu2+ with very high affinity (K Aβ1–42 = 8 attomolar) (7Atwood C.S. Moir R.D. Huang X. Bacarra N.M.E. Scarpa R.C. Romano D.M. Hartshorn M.A. Tanzi R.E. Bush A.I. J.

The Aβ·Cu2+ complex is redox-active and produces H2O2 from O2 through the reduction of Cu2+ (10Huang X. Atwood C.S. Hartshorn M.A. Multhaup G. Goldstein L.E. Scarpa R.C. Cuajungco M.P. Gray D.N.

The H2O2 that Aβ directly generates contributes to the neurotoxicity of the peptide in primary neuronal cultures (11Huang X. Cuajungco M.P. Atwood C.S. Hartshorn M.A. Tyndall J. Hanson G.R. Stokes K.C. Leopold M. Multhaup G. Goldstein L.E. Scarpa R.C. Saunders A.J. Lim J. Moir R.D. Glabe C. Bowden E.F. Masters C.L. Fairlie D.P. Tanzi R.E. Bush A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37111-37116Google Scholar). This is important because of the marked H2O2-mediated damage to neocortical tissue in AD (12Smith C.D. Carney J.M. Starke-Reed P.E. Oliver C.N.

Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2212-2215Google Scholar). The metal dependence of the generation of H2O2by Aβ may be a target for AD therapeutics. Cu and Zn are markedly elevated in amyloid plaques (15Lovell M.A. Robertson J.D. Teesdale W.J. Campbell J.L. Markesbery W.R. J. Neurol. Sci. 1998; 158: 47-52Google Scholar, 16Suh S.W. Jensen K.B. Jensen M.S. Silva D.S. Kesslak J.P. Danscher G. Frederickson C.J. Brain Res. 2000; 852: 274-278Google Scholar). Therefore it is significant that H2O2 generation by Aβ in vitro is abolished by chelators (10Huang X. Atwood C.S. Hartshorn M.A. Multhaup G. Goldstein L.E. Scarpa R.C. Cuajungco M.P. Gray D.N. Lim J.

Xilinas M.E. Gray D.N. Jones W.D. McLean C.A. Barnham K.J. Volitakis I. Fraser F.W. Kim Y.-S. Huang X. Goldstein L.E. Moir R.D. Lim J.T. Beyreuther K. Zheng H. Tanzi R.E. Masters C.L. Bush A.I. Neuron. 2001; 30: 665-676Google Scholar). The chemical origin of the electrons in the Aβ-mediated reduction of O2 to generate H2O2 (10Huang X. Atwood C.S. Hartshorn M.A. Multhaup G. Goldstein L.E.

Here we elaborate this reaction mechanism, demonstrating the donation of electrons from biological reducing agents (e.g. cholesterol, catecholamines, vitamin C). We further demonstrate that this reaction is catalytic and that the Aβ·Cu complex is a cuproenzyme that can be purified from the human brain. The neurotoxicity of Aβ in cell culture is shown to be completely dependent upon both the binding of Cu2+ and the simultaneous presence of a reducing agent. Taken together, these data argue that Aβ toxicity is because of abnormal enzymatic activity, which represents an important target for medical chemistry approaches for the treatment of AD. Aβ peptides were synthesized by the W. Keck Laboratory, Yale University, New Haven, CT. Confirmatory data were obtained by employing Aβ peptides synthesized in the laboratory of Dr. C. Glabe, University of California, Irvine, CA. Aβ peptide stock solutions were prepared in water treated with Chelex (Bio-Rad) and quantified according to established procedures (19Huang X. Atwood C.S. Moir R.D. Hartshorn M.A. Vonsattel J.-P. Tanzi R.E. Bush A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26464-26470Google Scholar). Cu2+-Gly (1:6) was prepared as described previously (8Atwood C.S. Scarpa R.C. Huang X. Moir R.D. Jones W.D. Fairlie D.P. Tanzi R.E. Bush A.I. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1219-1233Google Scholar). Monoclonal anti-Aβ antibodies 4G8 (which detects Aβ residues 17–21) and 6E10 (which detects residues 9–16) were obtained from Senetek, and 10H3 (immunogen is residues 1–28 of Aβ) were obtained from Pierce Endogen. The other reagents were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise noted. Dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCF; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was dissolved (5 mm) in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide (argon purged for 2 h at 20 °C), deacetylated with 0.25 m NaOH for 30 min, and then neutralized, pH 7.4, to a final concentration of 1 mm. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) stock solution was prepared to 1 μm in PBS, pH 7.4. The reactions were carried out in PBS, pH 7.4, under ambient conditions in a 96-well plate (250 μl/well) containing freshly prepared synthetic peptide (up to 1 μm), Cu-Gly (up to 2 μm), reducing agents (up to 10 μm), deacetylated DCF (100 μm), and HRP (0.1 μm), incubated at 37 °C. 10 μm EDTA was included to prevent reactions with contaminating concentrations (<0.2 μm) of free Cu2+. The concentrations of Aβ used varied to bring readout values into a convenient target range. For example, in studies to determine which reducing agents would promote H2O2 production (see Fig. 1) relatively higher peptide concentrations (1 μm) were studied so that low production of H2O2 would not be overlooked. In most experiments, though, Aβ was used at 200 nm to reflect the soluble concentration in the AD brain (20McLean C. Cherny R. Fraser F. Fuller S. Smith M. Beyreuther K. Bush A. Masters C. Annal. Neurol. 1999; 46: 860-866Google Scholar). Studies were completed on the day of reagent preparation. Reactions were conducted in the dark to avoid photodynamic effects. The signal specific for H2O2 was the decrease in fluorescence of parallel samples coincubated with catalase (4000 units/ml; 10 μm). Fluorescent readings were recorded by a Packard Fluorocount plate reader (485 nm excitation, 530 nm emission), against a standard curve of reagent grade H2O2 in PBS, pH 7.4. Cortical neuronal cultures were prepared as described previously (18Cuajungco M.P. Goldstein L.E. Nunomura A. Smith M.A. Lim J.T. Atwood C.S. Huang X. Farrag Y.W. Perry G. Bush A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19439-19442Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, embryonic day 18 BL6Jx129sv mouse cortices were removed, dissected free of meninges, and dissociated in 0.025% (w/v) trypsin. Dissociated cells were plated in poly-l-lysine-coated 48-well culture plates (Nunc) at a density of 1 × 105cells/cm2 in plating medium (minimum Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum and 5% horse serum). Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 2 h before the plating medium was replaced with Neurobasal growth medium containing B27 supplements. This method resulted in cultures highly enriched for neurons (≈5% glia). After 6 days in culture, the medium was replaced with fresh Neurobasal medium supplemented with B27 lacking antioxidants (to minimize scavenging of H2O2 generated in the medium) or Locke's buffer, which contained the following (in mm): NaCl, 154; KCl, 5.6; CaCl2, 2.3; MgCl2, 1; NaHCO3, 3.6; glucose, 5; Hepes, pH 7.4, 5, into which experimental compounds were added. For treatment of neuronal cultures fresh Aβ stock solution was diluted (final concentration 0.2–2.5 μm) in Neurobasal medium or Locke's buffer and coincubated (15 min, 20 °C) ± Cu-Gly (0.4–5 μm), DA (5–20 μm), catalase (1000 unit/ml), or Me2SO (98 μm). The mixtures were then added to neuronal cultures for up to 24 h, and cell viability was then assayed. Cell survival was monitored by phase contrast microscopy, and cell viability was quantitated using the MTS assay as described previously (21White A.R. Huang X. Jobling M.F. Barrow C.J. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Bush A.I. Cappai R. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1509-1520Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed two times with 250 μl of Locke's buffer, then placed in Neurobasal medium (250 μl), and 25 μl of MTS (Promega) was added to each well and incubated for 4 h in a 48-well plate. Absorbance (490 nm) was determined using a Wallac Victor Multireader and compared with MTS incubated in cell-free medium. The data were calculated as a percentage of values from untreated cells. TCEP, used in our previous studies to detect H2O2, may have served as the source of electrons to form H2O2 from O2, because it is also a reducing agent (10Huang X. Atwood C.S. Hartshorn M.A. Multhaup G. Goldstein L.E. Scarpa R.C. Cuajungco M.P. Gray D.N. Lim J. Moir R.D. Tanzi R.E. Bush A.I. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7609-7616Google Scholar, 11Huang X. Cuajungco M.P. Atwood C.S. Hartshorn M.A. Tyndall J. Hanson G.R. Stokes K.C. Leopold M. Multhaup G. Goldstein L.E. Scarpa R.C. Saunders A.J. Lim J. Moir R.D. Glabe C. Bowden E.F. Masters C.L. Fairlie D.P. Tanzi R.E. Bush A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37111-37116Google Scholar). To evaluate this possibility we coincubated Aβ complexed with Cu2+(Aβ·Cu) ± TCEP using the DCF assay to measure H2O2. A ratio of 2Cu:Aβ was chosen for initial studies, because Aβ1–42 can bind up to two Cu atoms at pH 7.4 (8Atwood C.S. Scarpa R.C. Huang X. Moir R.D. Jones W.D. Fairlie D.P. Tanzi R.E. Bush A.I. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1219-1233Google Scholar). TCEP was indeed found to be a significant substrate for H2O2 formation by Aβ·Cu (Fig.1 A); however H2O2 formation by Aβ·Cu alone was not observed. HRP is used in the DCF-based H2O2assay to catalyze the reaction of H2O2 with the DCF detection reagent. As negative controls, we confirmed that Aβ·Cu did not increase DCF fluorescence in the absence of HRP and that catalase abolished DCF fluorescence in these and subsequent assays (not shown). Therefore, DCF is a suitable reagent to detect H2O2 production by Aβ. Furthermore, in the absence of Aβ, the Cu2+ (≤2 μm) alone did not generate H2O2 in these and subsequent experiments, indicating that EDTA at this concentration (10 μm, present in all subsequent experiments) blocks H2O2 generation by any possible free Cu+. Having established that a non-biological reducing agent (TCEP) will serve as a reservoir substrate for the generation of H2O2 by Aβ·Cu, we next surveyed a variety of neurochemicals to identify candidate biological substrates for the same reaction (Fig. 1 B). H2O2production was greatest for the stronger biochemical reducing agents, vitamin C (1.9 μm) > DA (1.7 μm) > l-DOPA (1.3 μm). Other agents that promoted significant H2O2production included cholesterol, progesterone (0.5 μm), epinephrine (0.4 μm), norepinephrine, serotonin, and NADPH (0.3 μm). Equivocal H2O2levels were generated by NADH and β-estradiol. Acetylcholine, histamine, l-phenylalanine, l-tyrosine, and methionine were all unable to generate H2O2 in the presence of Aβ·Cu. To characterize the enzymology of catalytic H2O2 production by Aβ·Cu in vitro, we elected DA as the test substrate, because its redox chemistry is well understood. We first optimized H2O2 production as a product of the stoichiometry of Cu bound to Aβ1–42. Under the same conditions as in Fig. 1 B, we incubated Aβ1–42 (200 nm) with Cu2+ (0 to 1000 nm) and assayed resultant H2O2 levels generated in the presence of DA (5 μm) and EDTA (Fig. 1 C). H2O2 production by Aβ·Cu saturated at a molar ratio of 2Cu:1Aβ (AβCu2) suggesting that there the two Cu binding sites coordinated by each Aβ monomer at pH 7.4 (8Atwood C.S. Scarpa R.C. Huang X. Moir R.D. Jones W.D. Fairlie D.P. Tanzi R.E. Bush A.I. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1219-1233Google Scholar) both support redox activity. The saturation of H2O2 production in this experiment confirms that only the Cu2+ bound to Aβ, and not free Cu2+, contributed to the production of H2O2. We studied the dynamic range of H2O2 production from AβCu2 by incubating the complex (0–900 nm Aβ) with DA (5 μm). H2O2 production was linearly dependent on AβCu2 concentrations between 100 and 600 nm(Fig. 1 D). To determine the Michaelis-Menten relationships between AβCu2 and DA, we demonstrated that the rate of H2O2 production by AβCu2 (200 nm Aβ) was dependent upon DA concentration (0 to 10 μm) (Fig. 2 A). The data obtained at 60 min of incubation were plotted using a Lineweaver-Burk equation (Fig. 2 B). This revealed a linear relationship (R2 = 0.998) between 1/v and 1/DA and aV max of 34.5 nm/min andK m of 8.9 μm. 60 min was chosen as the interval for the Lineweaver-Burk transformation, because it was midpoint of the 120-min study, and because H2O2production was occurring at a constant rate for all DA concentrations during the incubation period. The transformation yielded similar values for data from the 30-, 90-, and 120-min incubation values (not shown). Because reaction with DA may alter the redox activity of Aβ·Cu, we repeated some previous observations of Aβ-mediated H2O2 production, this time in the presence of DA. AβCu2 (0.5 μm) + DA (5 μm) generated no detectable superoxide ( O2˙¯) using dihydroethidium (20 μm; Molecular Probes) as an indicator following 1 h of incubation. Catalytic H2O2 was readily detected from AβCu2 at 200 nm (Fig. 1, B andC), so lack of detectable O2˙¯ from a 2.5-fold greater concentration of AβCu2 suggests that H2O2 is not generated by disproportionation of O2˙¯, in agreement with our previous report (10Huang X. Atwood C.S. Hartshorn M.A. Multhaup G. Goldstein L.E. Scarpa R.C. Cuajungco M.P. Gray D.N. Lim J. Moir R.D. Tanzi R.E. Bush A.I. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7609-7616Google Scholar). The H2O2 catalytic activity of variant Aβ peptides (prepared as AβCu2), using DA as substrate, was again found to exhibit the same relative redox activities (Aβ1–42 > Aβ1–40 > rat Aβ1–42 > rat Aβ1–40) (see Figs. 1 C and 3 A) as reported previously, correlating with the respective abilities of the peptides to reduce Cu2+ and their toxicity in neuronal culture (10Huang X. Atwood C.S. Hartshorn M.A. Multhaup G. Goldstein L.E. Scarpa R.C. Cuajungco M.P. Gray D.N. Lim J. Moir R.D. Tanzi R.E. Bush A.I. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7609-7616Google Scholar,11Huang X.

Fairlie D.P. Tanzi R.E. Bush A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37111-37116Google Scholar). The lower H2O2 catalytic activity of rat Aβ1–42 compared with human Aβ1–42 did not appear to be because of decreased Cu2+ affinity or stoichiometry, because excess Cu2+ added to rat Aβ1–42 did not enhance its activity to the same level as human Aβ1–42, saturating at a binding ratio of 2Cu:1Aβ (Fig. 1 C). Importantly, cerebral amyloid deposits are scarce in aged rats and mice (22Vaughan D.W. Peters A. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1981; 40: 472-487Google Scholar), which possess a homologue with three amino acid substitutions (23Shivers B.D. Hilbich C. Multhaup G. Salbaum M. Beyreuther K. Seeburg P.H. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1365-1370Google Scholar). Aβ1–28 and Aβ25–35, as well as control peptides insulin and apotransferrin, were again found to be redox inert in the presence of DA (Fig.3 A) (10Huang X. Atwood C.S. Hartshorn M.A. Multhaup G. Goldstein L.E. Scarpa R.C. Cuajungco M.P. Gray D.N. Lim J. Moir R.D. Tanzi R.E. Bush A.I. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7609-7616Google Scholar, 11Huang X.

Fairlie D.P. Tanzi R.E. Bush A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37111-37116Google Scholar). To appraise the affinity of the active Cu2+ in catalytic H2O2 production, we studied the effects of chelators of higher Cu2+ affinity than EDTA. DTPA and CDTA have both been observed previously to deplete Cu2+from Aβ1–42 (8Atwood C.S. Scarpa R.C. Huang X. Moir R.D. Jones W.D. Fairlie D.P. Tanzi R.E. Bush A.I. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1219-1233Google Scholar) and were found to abolish H2O2 production in the presence of DA (Fig.3 B). Similarly, DETC, which inhibits Cu-mediated superoxide dismutase activity, inhibited H2O2 production. In contrast, melatonin, which has little affinity for Cu2+, was unable to inhibit H2O2 production (data not shown). The effects of stereochemical occlusion of the AβCu2active site were studied using anti-Aβ monoclonal antibodies. AβCu2 was preincubated (30 min) with various antibodies, and H2O2 generation upon incubation with DA (5 μm) was determined. All three anti-Aβ antibodies significantly inhibited H2O2 production (10H3 > 4G8 > 6E10), whereas a nonspecific anti-IgG antibody present at 5-fold greater excess than the anti-Aβ antibodies had no inhibitory effect (Fig. 3 C). Cytotoxic H2O2 production by Aβ, which is augmented by Cu in cultures (11Huang X. Cuajungco M.P. Atwood C.S. Hartshorn M.A. Tyndall J. Hanson G.R. Stokes K.C. Leopold M. Multhaup G. Goldstein L.E.

To test this, we studied the effects of Aβ1–42, Cu2+, and DA together and individually, upon the survival of E18 primary neurons studied in media that lacked H2O2 scavengers. To achieve this, the cells were first grown in Neurobasal medium plus B-27 supplement with antioxidants, and after 6–8 days the medium was changed to Locke's buffer without antioxidants for the experiments. We treated the cultures with Aβ1–42 (2.5 μm) ± Cu2+-Gly (5 μm), in the presence or absence of DA (20 μm), and assayed for survival at 14 and 16 h (Fig. 4 A). Because DA rapidly oxidizes in culture medium, it was necessary to abbreviate the onset of toxicity, which was achieved by using higher concentrations of reagents than were employed in the H2O2 assay studies. Aβ1–42 by itself was not toxic (Fig. 4 A), but when bound to Cu Aβ1–42 became rapidly toxic (85% survival at 14 h, 60% survival at 16 h; intervals chosen after pilot studies showed that cell death commenced after 12 h and was near total by 24 h). The time dependence of toxicity in the absence of DA was compatible with the catalytic H2O2production by AβCu2 utilizing reducing agents released by the cells and accumulating in the culture medium. Compatible with H2O2 production mediating cell death, AβCu2 toxicity was markedly exaggerated by the addition of exogenous DA. Neither Cu alone nor DA alone was toxic (Fig.4 A). To ensure that the neurotoxicity was not because of unbound Cu2+, EDTA (10 μm) was present in the incubation medium. We investigated the H2O2-related toxicity of Aβ1–42 at lower peptide concentration (200 nm) to test whether toxicity will occur at physiological peptide concentrations (20McLean C. Cherny R. Fraser F. Fuller S. Smith M. Beyreuther K. Bush A. Masters C. Annal. Neurol. 1999; 46: 860-866Google Scholar) and when the cells are under less acute stress. Because toxicity evolved more slowly at this lower concentration, a longer incubation was needed. Therefore, to avoid toxicity due to serum deprivation, Neurobasal medium (lacking B27) was employed instead of Locke's buffer. Under these conditions, we observed that 200 nmAβCu2 was markedly toxic in the presence of 5 μm DA (<45% survival after 24 h; see Fig.4 B). The toxicity of AβCu2 was completely rescued (100% viability) by the selective H2O2scavenging enzyme, catalase, but only partially rescued by the radical scavenger Me2SO (Fig. 4 B). Hence, the toxicity of Aβ could be attributed entirely to catalytic H2O2 production. To ascertain whether these in vitro reactions could occur in AD, we measured catalytic H2O2 production from Aβ purified from AD plaque (24Roher A.E. Chaney M.O. Kuo Y.M. Webster S.D. Stine W.B. Haverkamp L.J. Woods A.S. Cotter R.J. Tuohy J.M. Krafft G.A. Bonnell B.S. Emmerling M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20631-20635Google Scholar). This Aβ preparation is neurotoxic in neuronal primary cell culture (24Roher A.E. Chaney M.O. Kuo Y.M. Webster S.D. Stine W.B. Haverkamp L.J. Woods A.S. Cotter R.J. Tuohy J.M. Krafft G.A. Bonnell B.S. Emmerling M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20631-20635Google Scholar). We found that the purified Aβ generated a significant amount of H2O2 (≈270 nm; see Fig. 5). Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry found that the only metals it contained were Zn (1.7 eq), Cu (0.4 eq), Al (0.2 eq), and Fe (0.1 eq). By comparison, synthetic AβCu2 generated ≈630 nm H2O2, whereas AβCu2 incubated with a 4-fold excess of Zn2+generated a similar amount of H2O2 as the human-derived Aβ (which also bound an ≈4-fold excess of Zn2+ to Cu2+). Zn2+ binding inhibits Aβ-mediated H2O2 production (18Cuajungco M.P. Goldstein L.E. Nunomura A. Smith M.A. Lim J.T. Atwood C.S. Huang X. Farrag Y.W. Perry G. Bush A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19439-19442Google Scholar). However, the Aβ within amyloid is not bound to sufficient Zn2+ to prevent Cu2+-mediated H2O2 production. The major finding in this report is that Aβ forms an H2O2-producing cuproenzyme-like activity utilizing O2 and biological reducing agents as substrates. The K m for DA as the substrate (8.9 μm) indicates that this enzyme-like reaction is likely to occur under physiological conditions. Because H2O2 could not be generated by free Cu in this assay system (which was complexed by EDTA), Aβ must therefore generate a specific structure that presents redox-active Cu to O2 and certain reducing substrates. This structure could be similar to the Cu binding site on CuZn-superoxide dismutase (9Curtain C. Ali F. Volitakis I. Cherny R. Norton R. Beyreuther K. Barrow C. Masters C. Bush A. Barnham K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20466-20473Google Scholar), which also catalyzes the reduction of O2 (25Estevez A.G. Crow J.P. Sampson J.B. Reiter C. Zhuang Y. Richardson G.J. Tarpey M.M. Barbeito L. Beckman J.S. Science. 1999; 286: 2498-2500Google Scholar). A proposed reaction pathway for the sequence of electron transfers that converts O2 into H2O2 is described in Fig. 6. In this model, an electron is initially transferred from Aβ to reduce Cu2+ to Cu+. It is also possible that two electrons reduce two Cu2+ atoms bound to a single molecule of Aβ (11Huang X. Cuajungco M.P. Atwood C.S. Hartshorn M.A. Tyndall J. Hanson G.R. Stokes K.C. Leopold M. Multhaup G. Goldstein L.E. Scarpa R.C. Saunders A.J. Lim J. Moir R.D. Glabe C. Bowden E.F. Masters C.L. Fairlie D.P. Tanzi R.E. Bush A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37111-37116Google Scholar). After transferring the electron(s) to Cu2+, the Aβ peptide forms a positively charged radical (Aβ+⋅). The oxidized site of Aβ that supports this electron transfer is uncertain, but the sole Met residue at position 35 is a candidate for this reaction. This residue is essential for Cu2+reduction, which is abolished when the peptide buries this residue by membrane insertion (9Curtain C. Ali F. Volitakis I. Cherny R. Norton R. Beyreuther K. Barrow C. Masters C. Bush A. Barnham K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20466-20473Google Scholar), and is also abolished in Aβ1–28, which lacks Met (11Huang X. Cuajungco M.P. Atwood C.S. Hartshorn M.A. Tyndall J. Hanson G.R. Stokes K.C. Leopold M. Multhaup G. Goldstein L.E. Scarpa R.C. Saunders A.J. Lim J. Moir R.D. Glabe C. Bowden E.F. Masters C.L. Fairlie D.P. Tanzi R.E. Bush A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37111-37116Google Scholar). Met-35 is also essential for the toxicity of Aβ (26Varadarajan S. Yatin S. Kanski J. Jahanshahi F. Butterfield D.A. Brain Res. Bull. 1999; 50: 133-141Google Scholar). The strong reducing potential of the Aβ·Cu2+ complex (+550 mV) (11Huang X. Cuajungco M.P. Atwood C.S. Hartshorn M.A. Tyndall J. Hanson G.R. Stokes K.C.

https://openalex.org/W2071057714,"Frustrated systems are ubiquitous, and they are interesting because their behaviour is difficult to predict; frustration can lead to macroscopic degeneracies and qualitatively new states of matter. Magnetic systems offer good examples in the form of spin lattices, where all interactions between spins cannot be simultaneously satisfied. Here we report how unusual composite spin degrees of freedom can emerge from frustrated magnetic interactions in the cubic spinel ZnCr(2)O(4). Upon cooling, groups of six spins self-organize into weakly interacting antiferromagnetic loops, whose directors -- the unique direction along which the spins are aligned, parallel or antiparallel -- govern all low-temperature dynamics. The experimental evidence comes from a measurement of the magnetic form factor by inelastic neutron scattering; the data show that neutrons scatter from hexagonal spin clusters rather than individual spins. The hexagon directors are, to a first approximation, decoupled from each other, and hence their reorientations embody the long-sought local zero energy modes for the pyrochlore lattice."

These findings indicate that BAD is a novel substrate of JNK that links the stress-activated signaling pathway to the cell death machinery. Regulation of cell death is critical to the normal development and homeostasis of multicellular organisms. In the developing nervous system, neurons are produced in excess, and naturally occurring neuronal cell death is thus critical in ensuring that neurons form the appropriate connections (1Lewin G.R. Barde Y.-A. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 289-317Google Scholar). In the mature nervous system, abnormally occurring neuronal cell death contributes to the pathogenesis of a variety of diseases including stroke, epilepsy, and neurodegenerative diseases (2Choi D.W. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1996; 6: 667-672Google Scholar, 3Lowenstein D.H. Shimosaka S., So, Y.T. Simon R.P. Epilepsy Res. 1991; 10: 49-54Google Scholar, 4Cotman C.W. Neurobiol. Aging. 1998; 19: S29-S32Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, the mechanisms that underlie neuronal cell death have been the subject of intense interest. Studies of cell death in a variety of organisms have revealed that members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins act as gatekeepers of the cell death machinery (5Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; : 267Google Scholar, 6Reed J.C. Adv. Pharmacol. 1997; 41: 501Google Scholar, 7Chao D.T. Korsmeyer S.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 395Google Scholar). Under conditions in which cells are destined to undergo programmed cell death (apoptosis), the proapoptotic multidomain Bcl-2 proteins, including Bax, induce the release of cytochromec from mitochondria leading to the activation of a caspase cascade that executes the cell death program (8Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Google Scholar, 9Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Google Scholar). The prosurvival multidomain Bcl-2 proteins, including Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl, interact with and inhibit the proapoptotic multidomain Bcl-2 proteins (10Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Google Scholar). The BH3-only subfamily of Bcl-2 proteins appears to play an important role in regulating the function of the multidomain Bcl-2 protein in response to signals from the cell surface or the cytoskeleton (11Huang D.C. Strasser A. Cell. 2000; 103: 839-842Google Scholar). The BH3-only protein BAD promotes cell death by interacting with and inhibiting the prosurvival multidomain Bcl-2 proteins (10Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Google Scholar). Survival factors suppress BAD-mediated apoptosis by inducing the phosphorylation of BAD at serine 136, serine 112, or both, culminating in the interaction and sequestration of phosphorylated BAD by members of the 14-3-3 family of proteins (12Zha J. Harada H. Yang E. Jocket J. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 619-628Google Scholar). The protein kinases Akt, p21-activated kinase 1, and p70S6 kinase appear to mediate survival factor-induced phosphorylation of BAD serine 136 (13del Peso L. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Page C. Herrera R.

On the other hand, the protein kinases Rsk, protein kinase A, and p21-activated kinase 1 are thought to mediate survival factor-induced phosphorylation of BAD serine 112 (16Schurmann A. Mooney A.F.

Recently, we reported that BAD is also the target of an apoptotic signaling pathway (22Konishi Y. Lehtinen M. Donovan N. Bonni A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1005-1016Google Scholar). We found that the protein kinase Cdc2, previously established as controlling the transition of proliferating cells through mitosis, mediates apoptosis of newly generated postmitotic granule neurons of the developing rat cerebellum (22Konishi Y. Lehtinen M. Donovan N. Bonni A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1005-1016Google Scholar). Cdc2 triggers the phosphorylation of BAD at the novel site of serine 128, which lies near the growth factor-induced site of phosphorylation of serine 136 (22Konishi Y. Lehtinen M. Donovan N. Bonni A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1005-1016Google Scholar). The Cdc2-induced phosphorylation of BAD at serine 128 inhibits the interaction of growth factor-induced serine 136-phosphorylated BAD with 14-3-3 proteins and thereby activates the apoptotic effect of BAD (22Konishi Y. Lehtinen M. Donovan N. Bonni A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1005-1016Google Scholar). A major question that is raised by these findings is whether BAD, in particular BAD serine 128, is the target of other protein kinases that propagate apoptotic signals. The c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) 1The abbreviations used are: JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEK, MAPK/extracellular signal-related kinase kinase; MEKK1, MEK kinase 1; MKK3, MAPK kinase 3; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; GST, glutathione S-transferase; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; IGF1, insulin-like growth factor 1; LC, liquid chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry; P6, postnatal day 6 rats; DIV, days in vitro . represents a group of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) that mediate stress-induced cellular responses including programmed cell death (23Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Google Scholar). JNK is thought to induce apoptosis via transcription-dependent and transcription-independent mechanisms that remain incompletely understood. Studies of JNK-induced neuronal apoptosis suggest that JNK-induced phosphorylation of the transcription factor c-Jun and the consequent expression of c-Jun-induced genes mediate JNK-induced apoptosis (24Estus S.

The JNK-induced phosphorylation of Bcl-2 appears to suppress the prosurvival function of Bcl-2 (33Yamamoto K. Ichijo H. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell.

However, under certain circumstances, the phosphorylation of Bcl-2 at the site of the JNK-induced phosphorylation of Bcl-2 has been suggested to be required for the prosurvival function of Bcl-2 (34Ito T. Deng X. Carr B. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11671-11673Google Scholar). In this study, we have characterized a novel mechanism by which JNK directly activates the cell death machinery in neurons. We have found that JNK catalyzes the phosphorylation of the BH3-only protein BADin vitro at the distinct site of serine 128. Activation of the JNK signaling pathway in vivo was found to induce the serine 128 phosphorylation of BAD, including endogenous BAD in primary cerebellar granule neurons. We also found that JNK signaling pathway-induced phosphorylation of BAD at serine 128 promotes the apoptotic effect of BAD in granule neurons by opposing growth factor-inhibition of BAD-mediated apoptosis. These findings define a new mechanism by which the stress-activated signaling pathway triggers apoptosis. In addition, together with our recent characterization of the Cdc2-BAD apoptotic pathway (22Konishi Y. Lehtinen M. Donovan N. Bonni A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1005-1016Google Scholar), our results suggest that BAD serine 128 represents a common link for apoptosis-inducing protein kinases with the cell death machinery. The BAD plasmids (pCDNA3-BAD wild type and pCDNA3-BADS128A) (22Konishi Y. Lehtinen M. Donovan N. Bonni A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1005-1016Google Scholar), activated MEKK1 (36See R.H. Calvo D. Shi Y.

The N-20 BAD (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), phospho112-BAD (New England Biolabs), phospho136-BAD (New England Biolabs), anti-hemagglutinin (Santa-Cruz Biotechnology), phospho-JNK (New England Biolabs), and phospho-p38MAPK (New England Biolabs) antibodies were purchased. The phospho128-BAD antibody was generated as described (22Konishi Y. Lehtinen M. Donovan N. Bonni A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1005-1016Google Scholar). The JNK inhibitor II (SP600125) and the p38MAPK inhibitor (SB203580) were purchased from Calbiochem.

Peptides were separated by nanoscale microcapillary high performance liquid chromatography as described (37Stemmann O. Zou H. Gerber S.A. Gygi S.P. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 2001; 107: 715-726Google Scholar). Eluting peptides were ionized by electrospray ionization and analyzed by an LCQ-DECA ion trap mass spectrometer as described (37Stemmann O. Zou H. Gerber S.A. Gygi S.P. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 2001; 107: 715-726Google Scholar). Western analyses were carried out as described (22Konishi Y. Lehtinen M. Donovan N. Bonni A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1005-1016Google Scholar). Briefly, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked for 1 h in a Tris-buffered saline solution containing 0.05% Tween and 3% bovine serum albumin (USB). Following the blocking step, membranes were incubated with primary antibody (dilution of 1:1000) for 1 h at room temperature followed by the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody at 1:20,000 for 45 min. All Westerns were developed by enhanced chemiluminescence. Neuro2A cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were split the day before transfection onto 6-well plates and transfected when cells became 60% confluent using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The total amount of DNA (2 μg) was added to 100 μl of OptiMEM (Invitrogen), mixed gently with 6 μl of LipofectAMINE in 100 μl of OPTIMEM, allowed to incubate at room temperature for 45 min, and then 1 ml of serum-free DMEM was added to the mixture. The DNA/LipofectAMINE/DMEM mixture was then added to the cells for 3 h. Following transfection, cells were returned to DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. In the experiments in which inhibitors were added, the inhibitors SP600125 and SB203580 were used at 10 and 5 μm, respectively, and were added at the time that DMEM (plus 10% FBS) was added to cells. Lysates were prepared from transfected cultures 20 h after transfection. Cerebellar granule neurons were prepared as described (22Konishi Y. Lehtinen M. Donovan N. Bonni A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1005-1016Google Scholar) and transfected using a calcium phosphate transfection method. For the experiments depicted in Fig. 5, cultures from postnatal day 6 that were in culture for 7 or 8 days were transfected with 0.05 μg of BAD or BADS128A and 0.5 μg of activated MEKK1 or the control vector together with 0.25 μg of a plasmid encoding β-galactosidase. The calcium phosphate precipitate was placed on granule neurons (50 μl/well in a 24-well plate) for 20 min, and cultures were then returned to conditioned medium (basal medium Eagle containing 10% calf serum and 30 mmKCl). After overnight incubation with conditioned medium, cultures were deprived of conditioned medium and left in basal medium Eagle in the presence or absence of insulin (10 μg/ml) for 8 h. Cultures were fixed and subjected to indirect immunofluorescence using a mouse monoclonal antibody to β-galactosidase. Cell survival and death were assessed in β-galactosidase-expressing neurons based on the integrity of the neurites and the nucleus as determined by the DNA dye bisbenzimide (Hoechst 33258). Cell counts were carried out in a blinded manner. We investigated the mechanism by which JNK might directly regulate the cell death machinery via the BH3-only protein BAD. In a recent study (22Konishi Y. Lehtinen M. Donovan N. Bonni A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1005-1016Google Scholar) we found that Cdc2 directly couples the cell cycle to the cell death machinery by inducing the phosphorylation of BAD at the novel site of serine 128. Because JNK, like Cdc2, is a proline-directed kinase, and serine 128 conforms to the type of sequence that might be phosphorylated by JNK, we investigated the possibility that JNK might couple the stress-induced signaling pathways to the cell death machinery via the phosphorylation of BAD at serine 128. We first examined whether JNK phosphorylates BAD in vitro. In an in vitro kinase assay, we found that recombinant JNK robustly catalyzed the phosphorylation of a recombinant GST-BAD fusion protein (Fig. 1 A). To determine whether JNK induces the phosphorylation of BAD at serine 128, we subjected recombinant GST-BAD that was phosphorylated by JNK to mass spectrometry. Following preparative SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie staining, the JNK-phosphorylated BAD band was cut from the gel, digested with trypsin, and subjected to LC-MS/MS. Tryptic peptides were identified that matched the sequence of BAD. Analysis of the peptide encompassing serine 128 (His-110 to Arg-131) revealed that serine 128 within this peptide is modified by a phosphate group (Fig. 1 B). These results indicate that JNK induces the phosphorylation of BAD at serine 128 in vitro. To further support the conclusion that JNK phosphorylates BAD at serine 128, we employed a phosphospecific antibody that we raised to recognize BAD only when BAD is phosphorylated at serine 128 (phospho128-BAD antibody) (22Konishi Y. Lehtinen M. Donovan N. Bonni A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1005-1016Google Scholar). Recombinant BAD protein was subjected to an in vitro kinase reaction with JNK or Cdc2 and then immunoblotted with the phospho128-BAD or the N-20 BAD antibody that recognizes BAD regardless of its phosphorylation state. In these experiments, we found that JNK induced the phosphorylation of BAD at serine 128 as robustly as Cdc2 (Fig. 2 A). We also determined whether JNK induces the phosphorylation of BAD at the nearby sites of serine 112 and serine 136, sites that are phosphorylated by kinases propagating survival signals (10Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Google Scholar). Cyclic AMP-dependent kinase (protein kinase A) phosphorylated BADin vitro at serine 112 and serine 136 but not at serine 128 (Fig. 2 B). By contrast, JNK induced the phosphorylation of BAD at serine 128 but failed to phosphorylate BAD effectively at serine 112 or serine 136 (Fig. 2 B). Together, these results establish that JNK phosphorylates BAD specifically at serine 128in vitro. We next determined whether activation of the JNK signaling pathway induces the phosphorylation of BAD at serine 128 within cells. We expressed BAD alone or together with an expression plasmid encoding the activated form of the kinase MEKK1 in the mouse neuroblastoma cell line Neuro2A. MEKK1 is the prototypical MAPK kinase kinase that activates the JNK signaling pathway. One day after transfection, we subjected Neuro2A cell lysates to immunoblotting using the phospho128-BAD or the N-20 BAD antibody. We found that the expression of activated MEKK1 together with BAD induced the phosphorylation of BAD at serine 128 in Neuro2A cells (Fig. 3 A). The phospho128-BAD immunoreactivity was specific in Neuro2A cells, because the phospho128-BAD antibody failed to recognize a BAD mutant in which serine 128 was replaced with alanine (BADS128A) that was coexpressed with activated MEKK1 in these cells (Fig. 3 B). Together, these results suggest that activation of the JNK pathway triggers the phosphorylation of BAD serine 128 in vivo. We next investigated the mechanism by which MEKK1 induces the phosphorylation of BAD serine 128 in Neuro2A cells. MEKK1 has been reported to induce protein kinase cascades that culminate in the activation of the MAPKs JNK and p38MAPK (23Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Google Scholar). In Neuro2A cells, activated MEKK1 did induce the phosphorylation of both JNK and p38MAPK on sites that reflect the activation of these protein kinases as determined by Western analyses of lysates of Neuro2A cells using antibodies that recognize the phosphorylated forms of p38MAPK or JNK specifically (Fig. 3 C). To determine the relative importance of p38MAPK and JNK in the MEKK1-induced phosphorylation of BAD serine 128, we first tested the ability of a constitutive active form of the p38MAPK activator MKK3 to induce the phosphorylation of BAD at serine 128. The expression of activated MKK3 in Neuro2A cells induced the phosphorylation of p38MAPK but not JNK (Fig. 3 C). We found that activated MKK3 failed to induce the BAD serine 128 phosphorylation effectively (Fig. 3 C), suggesting that p38MAPK does not mediate BAD serine 128 phosphorylation. In other experiments, we determined the ability of activated MEKK1 to induce BAD phosphorylation in Neuro2A cells that were incubated with the p38MAPK inhibitor SB203580 or the JNK inhibitor SP600125 (38Bennett B.L. Sasaki D.T. Murray B.W. O'Leary E.C. Sakata S.T., Xu, W. Leisten J.C. Motiwala A. Pierce S. Satoh Y. Bhagwat S.S. Manning A.M. Anderson D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13681-13686Google Scholar). We found that the p38MAPK inhibitor failed to reduce the ability of activated MEKK1 to induce the BAD Serine 128 phosphorylation (Fig. 3 D). By contrast, the JNK inhibitor reduced significantly the MEKK1-induced BAD serine 128 phosphorylation (Fig. 3 D). Together, these data suggest that JNK mediates the ability of stress-induced signals to induce the phosphorylation of BAD at serine 128. To determine whether the JNK signaling pathway induces the phosphorylation of endogenous BAD in vivo, we tested whether anisomycin, a stimulus known to induce the JNK signaling pathway in cells (23Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Google Scholar), induces the phosphorylation of BAD at serine 128 in NIH-3T3 cells. We found that exposure of NIH-3T3 cells to anisomycin induced the phosphorylation of endogenous BAD at serine 128 (Fig.4 A). Inhibition of JNK activity by the inhibitor SP600125 reduced effectively anisomycin-induced phosphorylation of BAD at Serine 128 (Fig. 4A). These results suggest that JNK mediates the phosphorylation of BAD atSerine 128 in vivo. To assess whether the JNK signaling pathway induces the phosphorylation of BAD that is endogenously expressed within neurons, we examined the phosphorylation of endogenous BAD in cerebellar granule neurons that were exposed to anisomycin. We found that anisomycin induces the phosphorylation of endogenous BAD at serine 128 in cerebellar granule neurons (Fig. 4 B). We also determined the effect of activated MEKK1 on the phosphorylation of endogenous BAD in cerebellar granule neurons. We carried out immunocytochemical analyses of cerebellar granule neurons that were transfected with the activated MEKK1 expression plasmid or the control expression plasmid. We found that a small fraction (14.3 ± 4.2%) of granule neurons transfected with the control vector plasmid displayed phospho128-BAD immunoreactivity (Fig. 4 C). However, phospho128-BAD immunoreactivity was detected in a large fraction (71.4 ± 3.6%) of granule neurons expressing activated MEKK1 (Fig. 4 C). These results suggest that activation of the JNK signaling pathway induces the phosphorylation of endogenous BAD at serine 128 in granule neurons. To determine the functional effect of the JNK-induced phosphorylation of BAD at serine 128 on the function of BAD, we expressed BAD alone or together with activated MEKK1 in primary cerebellar granule neurons. After transfection, granule neurons were deprived of survival factors or treated with a high concentration of insulin (10 μg/ml) that activates the IGF1 receptor for 8 h. The expression of BAD alone induced apoptosis of cerebellar granule neurons, and IGF1 receptor activation inhibited BAD-mediated apoptosis (Fig. 5). The expression of activated MEKK1 together with BAD did not increase BAD-mediated apoptosis in survival factor-deprived granule cell cultures (Fig. 5). However, IGF1 receptor activation failed to inhibit the apoptotic effect of BAD when BAD was co-expressed with activated MEKK1 (Fig. 5). These results suggest that activated MEKK1 induces a signal that opposes growth factor inhibition of BAD. We next determined the role of MEKK1-induced phosphorylation of BAD at serine 128 in MEKK1-induction of BAD-mediated apoptosis. We tested the effect of activated MEKK1 on the apoptotic effect of a BAD mutant in which serine 128 was replaced with alanine (BADS128A). In contrast to the ability of activated MEKK1 to promote the apoptotic effect of wild type BAD in insulin-treated granule neuron cultures, activated MEKK1 failed to antagonize the ability of insulin to inhibit the apoptotic effect of BADS128A (Fig. 5). Together, our results suggest that activation of the JNK signaling pathway induces the phosphorylation of BAD at serine 128 and thereby promotes the apoptotic effect of BAD by antagonizing growth factor-inhibition of BAD. In this study, we have characterized a novel mechanism by which the JNK signaling pathway promotes neuronal apoptosis. We have found that JNK catalyzes the phosphorylation of the BH3-only protein BAD at the distinct site of serine 128 in vitro. Activation of the JNK signaling pathway induced the phosphorylation of BAD serine 128in vivo, including in primary cerebellar granule neurons. The JNK-induced phosphorylation of BAD serine 128 triggers the apoptotic effect of BAD by opposing growth factor-inhibition of BAD-mediated apoptosis. Our findings define a mechanism that directly links the JNK signaling pathway to the cell death machinery. We have recently identified BAD serine 128 as a target of Cdc2-induced apoptosis in cerebellar granule neurons (22Konishi Y. Lehtinen M. Donovan N. Bonni A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1005-1016Google Scholar). The finding that the JNK signaling pathway also induces BAD-mediated apoptosis via the phosphorylation of BAD serine 128 suggests that BAD serine 128 represents a common target that links kinases propagating apoptotic signals with the cell death machinery. Cdc2 induces the phosphorylation of BAD serine 128 in newly generated granule neurons that are prepared from postnatal day 6 rats and cultured in vitro for 2 days (P6 + 2 DIV) (22Konishi Y. Lehtinen M. Donovan N. Bonni A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1005-1016Google Scholar). Interestingly, we found that activation of the JNK signaling pathway induces BAD-mediated apoptosis in more mature granule neurons (P6 + 6–8 DIV). These observations raise the possibility that within the developing cerebellar granule neuron population, different kinases might target BAD serine 128 at distinct stages of granule neuron maturation. The identification of BAD serine 128 as a site phosphorylated by JNK represents the first report of a BH3-only protein that is targeted by a member of the stress-activated protein kinase family. It will be important in the future to determine whether the JNK signaling pathway regulates other members of the BH3-only family of proteins. A link between JNK and the cell death machinery has been suggested by reports of JNK-induced phosphorylation of Bcl-2 (31Fan M. Goodwin M., Vu, T. Brantley-Finley C. Gaarde W.A. Chambers T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29980-29985Google Scholar, 32Maundrell K. Antonsson B. Magnenat E. Camps M. Muda M. Chabert C. Gillieron C. Boschert U. Vial-Knecht E. Martinou J.C. Arkinstall S. J. Biol.

The JNK-induced phosphorylation of Bcl-2 appears to suppress the prosurvival function of Bcl-2 (33Yamamoto K. Ichijo H. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8469-8478Google Scholar, 35Srivastava R.K., Mi, Q.-S. Hardwick J.M. Longo D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3775-3780Google Scholar). In contrast to the inhibitory effect of most phosphorylation events within Bcl-2 family proteins on the function of these proteins (including Bcl-2), the serine 128 phosphorylation of BAD, whether it is induced by Cdc2 or by JNK, activates the apoptotic function of BAD. We have found that the JNK-induced serine 128 phosphorylation of BAD promotes the apoptotic effect of BAD by antagonizing growth factor-inhibition of BAD-mediated apoptosis. The serine 128 phosphorylation of BAD opposes growth factor suppression of BAD by inhibiting the interaction of growth factor-induced serine 136-phosphorylated BAD with 14-3-3 proteins (22Konishi Y. Lehtinen M. Donovan N. Bonni A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1005-1016Google Scholar). The finding that JNK-induced phosphorylation of BAD at serine 128 opposes growth factor inhibition of BAD supports the idea that BAD is a point of convergence for both survival and apoptotic signals. Survival-promoting kinases including Akt, Rsk, p21-activated kinase 1, p70S6 kinase, and mitochondrially anchored protein kinase A induce the phosphorylation of BAD at serine 112 or serine 136 leading to the sequestration of BAD with 14-3-3 proteins (12Zha J.

Taylor S.S. Scott J.D. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 413-422Google Scholar), whereas the apoptosis-inducing kinases JNK and Cdc2 induce the phosphorylation of BAD at serine 128 (this study and Ref. 22Konishi Y. Lehtinen M. Donovan N. Bonni A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1005-1016Google Scholar). Thus, BAD might serve as a protein that integrates prosurvival and proapoptotic signals with the net effect contributing to the decision of the cell to survive or undergo apoptosis. JNK-induced apoptosis is thought to play an important role in the development of the nervous system (39Kuan C.Y. Yang D.D. Samanta Roy D.R. Davis R.J. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Neuron. 1999; 22: 667-676Google Scholar, 40Sabapathy K. Jochum W. Hochedlinger K. Chang L. Karin M. Wagner E.F. Mech. Dev. 1999; 89: 115-124Google Scholar). In future studies, it will be important to determine whether the JNK-induced phosphorylation of BAD plays a role in neuronal cell death during normal brain development. Neuronal apoptosis is also thought to contribute to neuronal cell loss upon exposure to pathogenic stimuli, including those that occur in ischemia, epilepsy, and neurodegenerative diseases of the brain (2Choi D.W. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1996; 6: 667-672Google Scholar, 3Lowenstein D.H. Shimosaka S., So, Y.T. Simon R.P. Epilepsy Res. 1991; 10: 49-54Google Scholar, 4Cotman C.W. Neurobiol. Aging. 1998; 19: S29-S32Google Scholar). It will be interesting to determine whether JNK-induced BAD serine 128 phosphorylation contributes to neuronal cell loss in these neuropathological conditions. We thank S. Gygyi for analysis of JNK-phosphorylated BAD by mass spectrometry and Y. Shi for providing the activated MEKK1 plasmid."

https://openalex.org/W1656220430,"A function of the transcription factor REST is to block the expression of neuronal phenotypic traits in non-neuronal cells. Previous studies have shown that REST-mediated repression requires histone deacetylase activity and that recruitment of deacetylases is mediated by two co-repressors, Sin3A and CoREST. In this study, we show that a repressor domain in CoREST interacts with BRG1-associated factor (BAF) 57, a component of the hSWI·SNF complex. In vivo, BAF57 occupies the neuronal sodium channel gene (Nav1.2) promoter, and targeting to this gene requires REST. In addition to BAF57, the ATPase BRG1 and BAF170, other members of the hSWI·SNF complex, are also present in the REST·CoREST repressor complex. Microinjection of specific antibodies against BRG1, BAF57, or BAF170 into Rat1 fibroblasts relieves repression of RE1 reporter genes. Together, our data suggest that ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling, as well as histone deacetylation, is needed for REST-mediated repression.

Together, our data suggest that ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling, as well as histone deacetylation, is needed for REST-mediated repression. The acquisition and the maintenance of cell phenotype depend upon precisely controlled transcriptional events. For neurons, intrinsic repressor mechanisms are important for controlling multiple steps in the differentiation program, from neural induction to neural specification. In addition, an extrinsic repression mechanism, which correlates with modification of chromatin structure for at least one gene (1Vandenbergh D.J. Wuenschell C.W. Mori N. Anderson D.J. Neuron. 1989; 3: 507-518Google Scholar), blocks expression of neuronal traits outside the nervous system. The transcriptional repressor, REST (also called NRSF) (2Chong J.A. Tapia-Ramirez J. Kim S.

Because ectopic expression of REST target genes, such as voltage-dependent ion channels and synaptic proteins, is likely to have deleterious effects in non-neuronal cells, there has been much interest in determining the long term repressor mechanism underlying REST function. REST is a modular protein that represses via two distinct repressor domains. Repression from the amino terminus is mediated by a Sin3·histone deacetylase (HDAC) 1The abbreviations used are: HDAC, histone deacetylase; BAF, BRG1-associated factor; SANT, SW13/ADA2/NcoR/TFIIIB; HMG, high mobility group; GST, glutathione S-transferase; h, human; AD, activation domain; dox, doxycycline; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactoside. complex (8Tapia-Ramirez J.

CoREST is in complexes with class I HDACs (1 and 2) both in non-neuronal and neuronal cell lines (7Ballas N. Battaglioli E. Atouf F. Andres M.E. Chenoweth J. Anderson M.E. Burger C. Moniwa M.

Like REST, CoREST contains two repressor domains. The amino-terminal domain coincides with the REST binding site and is dependent upon HDAC activity for repression (7Ballas N. Battaglioli E. Atouf F. Andres M.E. Chenoweth J. Anderson M.E. Burger C. Moniwa M. Davie J.R. Bowers W.J. Federoff H.J. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Brehm P. Mandel G. Neuron. 2001; 31: 353-365Google Scholar, 14You A. Tong J.K. Grozinger C.M. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1454-1458Google Scholar). Trichostatin A treatment, as well as HDAC2 antibody microinjection experiments, suggest that the carboxyl-terminal repressor domain is also associated with HDAC activity (7Ballas N. Battaglioli E. Atouf F. Andres M.E. Chenoweth J. Anderson M.E. Burger C. Moniwa M. Davie J.R. Bowers W.J. Federoff H.J. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Brehm P. Mandel G. Neuron. 2001; 31: 353-365Google Scholar). It is not known why REST needs two distinct repressor domains if each recruits HDAC activity. One possibility is that CoREST recruits an additional activity specifically involved in maintaining long term repression. Indeed, it is now very well accepted that multiple covalent and non-covalent chromatin modifications are required for proper gene expression. The best studied covalent modifications occur on histones and include acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination (16Cheung P. Allis C.D. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 2000; 103: 263-271Google Scholar, 17Wu J. Grunstein M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 619-623Google Scholar). In particular, hypoacetylated histones have been associated primarily with repressed or silenced genes, and manybona fide co-repressor complexes have been described that contain HDAC activity (18Khochbin S. Verdel A. Lemercier C. Seigneurin-Berny D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 162-166Google Scholar). Non-covalent modifications are energy-dependent chromatin modifications made by ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complexes, such as the SWI·SNF complex. The mammalian SWI·SNF complex is a family of 2-MDa multisubunit ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complexes that exists in a variety of biochemically diverse forms (19Kingston R.E. Narlikar G.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2339-2352Google Scholar, 20Vignali M. Hassan A.H. Neely K.E. Workman J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1899-1910Google Scholar). Central to the activity is either the ATPase BRG1 or BRM that serve as the catalytic components. Although ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling activity was associated originally with transcriptional activation, it has become increasingly clear that remodeling activity is also involved in transcriptional repression. For example, microarray analysis of both yeast and human SWI·SNF mutants result in both repression and de-repression of genes (21Holstege F.C. Jennings E.G. Wyrick J.J. Lee T.I. Hengartner C.J.

More specifically, the human homologue of yeast SWI·SNF (hSWI·SNF) has been implicated in repression of the c-fos gene (24Murphy D.J. Hardy S. Engel D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2724-2733Google Scholar) and is required for retinoblastoma-mediated repression during the cell cycle (25Zhang H.S. Gavin M. Dahiya A. Postigo A.A., Ma, D. Luo R.X. Harbour J.W.

A. 2000; 97: 7748-7753Google Scholar). The Mi-2·NURD complex contains both HDACs and ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling components, suggesting that these activities can be coupled to regulate transcription in vivo (27Xue Y. Wong J. Moreno G.T. Young M.K. Cote J. Wang W. Mol Cell. 1998; 2: 851-861Google Scholar, 28Zhang Y. LeRoy G. Seelig H.P. Lane W.S. Reinberg D. Cell. 1998; 95: 279-289Google Scholar). Furthermore, two mammalian co-repressors, Sin3 and NcoR, have been identified in complexes with hSWI·SNF components (29Kuzmichev A. Zhang Y. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 835-848Google Scholar, 30Sif S. Saurin A.J. Imbalzano A.N. Kingston R.E. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 603-618Google Scholar, 31Underhill C. Qutob M.S. Yee S.P. Torchia J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40463-40470Google Scholar). Most recently, BAF57, a subunit of the hSWI·SNF complex, has been demonstrated to be required for the silencing of the CD4 gene (32Chi T.H. Wan M. Zhao K. Taniuchi I. Chen L. Littman D.R. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 2002; 418: 195-199Google Scholar). To test whether a CoREST co-repressor complex might also recruit remodeling components, in addition to HDAC, to a specific RE1 sequence, we performed a two-hybrid screen in yeast using the carboxyl-terminal repressor domain of CoREST as bait. We found that this domain interacted with a component of the mammalian SWI·SNF complex, the high mobility group (HMG) protein, BAF57 (33Wang W. Chi T. Xue Y. Zhou S. Kuo A. Crabtree G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 492-498Google Scholar). Further analysis showed that CoREST, as well as REST, was in complexes with two additional hSWI·SNF components, BRG1 and BAF170. When this association was perturbed in living cells by the microinjection of specific antibodies against BRG1, BAF57, or BAF170, repression of RE1-containing reporter genes was relieved. Furthermore, BAF57 was associated with the RE1 element of the endogenous brain sodium channel gene Nav1.2 in vivo, and this association occurred only in the presence of REST. Our findings suggest that the hSWI·SNF complex plays an important role in REST-mediated repression of neuronal genes, most likely through its ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling activity. pBTMCoREST, a fusion between the LexA DNA binding (LexA) domain with full-length CoREST, pBTMCoREST1–293, and pBTMKIA containing the LexA DNA binding domain, respectively, fused to amino acids 1–293 and amino acids 102–482 of CoREST, have been described previously (9Grimes J.A. Nielsen S.J. Battaglioli E. Miska E.A. Speh J.C. Berry D.L. Atouf F. Holdener B.C. Mandel G. Kouzarides T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9461-9467Google Scholar, 13Andres M.E. Burger C. Peral-Rubio M.J. Battaglioli E. Anderson M.E. Grimes J. Dallman J. Ballas N. Mandel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9873-9878Google Scholar). A fusion of the LexA DNA binding domain to CoREST fragments encompassing amino acids 292–381, amino acids 292–354, and amino acids 373–442 were made by cloning a BamHI/SacI-blunt fragment of Gal4 CoREST (292–381, 292–354, and 373–442, respectively) into pBTM116 cut with BamHI/PstI-blunt. A fusion of the LexA DNA binding domain and CoREST fragments encompassing amino acids 187–442 and amino acids 291–442 were obtained by cloning into pBTM116 by standard PCR cloning techniques. pGADBAF57 and pGADBAF57v were obtained by cloning full-length BAF57 and full-length BAF57v from pBLUEBAF57 and pBLUEBAF57v into the BamHI/EcoRI restriction sites in pGADGH. Fusions between the activation domain of Gal4 (Gal4AD) and different fragments of BAF57 proteins were obtained by standard PCR techniques and were named as follows: pGADBAF57 (1–280), pGADBAF57 (1–218), pGADBAF57 (105–363), pGADBAF57v (219–363), pGADBAF57 (219–280), pGADBAF57 (219–249), and pGADBAF57v (258–280). Full-length GSTBAF57 and full-length GSTBAF57v were cloned into pGEX-3X by standard PCR cloning techniques. The Tet-On plasmid was purchased from Clontech, and the tetracycline-inducible pTREFLAGREST was described previously (7Ballas N. Battaglioli E. Atouf F. Andres M.E. Chenoweth J. Anderson M.E. Burger C. Moniwa M. Davie J.R. Bowers W.J. Federoff H.J. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Brehm P. Mandel G. Neuron. 2001; 31: 353-365Google Scholar, 9Grimes J.A. Nielsen S.J. Battaglioli E. Miska E.A. Speh J.C. Berry D.L. Atouf F. Holdener B.C. Mandel G. Kouzarides T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9461-9467Google Scholar). The pBJ5-BRG1 expression vector was generously donated by G. R. Crabtree. Full-length BAF57 and full-length BAF57v were cloned in theSmaI site of pBSIIKS by reverse transcription and standard PCR techniques with primers designed in the 5′ and 3′-untranslated regions of the human BAF57 cDNA sequence using a HeLa cDNA library. pcDNACoREST was described previously (13Andres M.E. Burger C. Peral-Rubio M.J. Battaglioli E. Anderson M.E. Grimes J. Dallman J. Ballas N. Mandel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9873-9878Google Scholar). All fusion protein constructs were sequenced across the junction to ensure that inserts were in-frame. All constructs generated by PCR were sequenced completely. The yeast two-hybrid method used here has been described previously (13Andres M.E. Burger C. Peral-Rubio M.J. Battaglioli E. Anderson M.E. Grimes J. Dallman J. Ballas N. Mandel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9873-9878Google Scholar). Briefly, pBTMKIA was co-transformed into L40 yeast, together with a HeLa cell cDNA library fused to the activation domain of Gal4. An estimated 9 × 106 transformants were screened. Positive clones were identified by growth on selective medium lacking histidine and confirmed by assaying for β-galactosidase activity. Specificity of interaction was tested by a mating assay between the positive L40 transformants and an AMR-70 strain expressing pBTMKIA and several LexA fusion proteins not related to CoREST. Positive clones were characterized by sequence analysis. Direct yeast interaction assays were performed using yeast transformed with either LexACoREST or smaller fragments of CoREST fused to the LexA DNA binding domain and with either pGADBAF57 or pGADBAF57v or smaller fragments of these proteins fused to the activation domain of Gal4. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed as described previously (7Ballas N. Battaglioli E. Atouf F. Andres M.E. Chenoweth J. Anderson M.E. Burger C. Moniwa M. Davie J.R. Bowers W.J. Federoff H.J. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Brehm P. Mandel G. Neuron. 2001; 31: 353-365Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were cross-linked by addition of formaldehyde to 1% final concentration for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were harvested and lysed in a buffer containing 5 mmHEPES, pH 8, 85 mm KCl, and 0.5% Triton. Isolated nuclei were resuspended in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, 10 mm EDTA, and 1% SDS and sonicated to obtain DNA fragments of a length between 200 and 600 bp. Sonicated chromatin was precleared with protein G-agarose beads at 4 °C for 2 h. Precleared chromatin was incubated with 5 μg of each antibody (anti-REST, anti-CoREST, anti-BAF57, and anti-preimmune serum) and 5 μl of anti-Ac.H4 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) in immunoprecipitation buffer (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) at 4 °C overnight. Immunocomplexes were collected on protein G-agarose beads preadsorbed with sonicated single-stranded DNA. Following washes and elution, cross-linking was reversed by heating overnight at 65 °C. Samples were purified, and the specific DNA sequences in the immunoprecipitates were detected by PCR. For real-time PCR detection of immunoprecipitated chromatin, an ABI Prism 7700 sequence detector was used to measure the incorporation of the fluorescent dye SYBR-green into PCR product. 8% of the DNA purified from the immunoprecipitation was used in the PCR reaction with primers for the rat Nav1.2 regulatory region (forward, 5′-AGGAGAGCCTGTAATTGGGTTTC; reverse, 5′-CAAGCAGGGTCAGGAACCA). DNA samples were heated to 95 °C° for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of heating to 95 °C for 15 s and a combined annealing/extension at 56 °C for 1 min. Cycle thresholds for each immunoprecipitation were normalized to immunoprecipitation inputs, and comparisons were performed using the cycle threshold comparative method. Expression and purification of GST fusion proteins and GST pull down assays were performed as described (13Andres M.E. Burger C. Peral-Rubio M.J. Battaglioli E. Anderson M.E. Grimes J. Dallman J. Ballas N. Mandel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9873-9878Google Scholar). In vitrotranscription/translation was performed using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate-based TnT system from Promega according to the manufacturer's instructions. The in vitro-translated CoREST in pCDNA 1.1Amp was described previously (13Andres M.E. Burger C. Peral-Rubio M.J. Battaglioli E. Anderson M.E. Grimes J. Dallman J. Ballas N. Mandel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9873-9878Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were grown as described previously (13Andres M.E. Burger C. Peral-Rubio M.J. Battaglioli E. Anderson M.E. Grimes J. Dallman J. Ballas N. Mandel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9873-9878Google Scholar) and transfected using the LipofectAMINE 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen). When transfected with pTetOn and pTRE-RESTFLAG doxycycline (Sigma) was added to the medium to a final concentration of 1 μg/ml to induce the expression of FLAGREST. Immunoprecipitation assays were performed essentially as described (7Ballas N. Battaglioli E. Atouf F. Andres M.E. Chenoweth J. Anderson M.E. Burger C. Moniwa M. Davie J.R. Bowers W.J. Federoff H.J. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Brehm P. Mandel G. Neuron. 2001; 31: 353-365Google Scholar). Antibodies used were anti-REST (2Chong J.A. Tapia-Ramirez J. Kim S. Toledo-Aral J.J. Zheng Y. Boutros M.C. Altshuller Y.M. Frohman M.A. Kraner S.D. Mandel G. Cell. 1995; 80: 949-957Google Scholar) and anti-CoREST (13Andres M.E. Burger C. Peral-Rubio M.J. Battaglioli E. Anderson M.E. Grimes J. Dallman J. Ballas N. Mandel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9873-9878Google Scholar). Anti-BAF57 and anti-BAF57v were generated as follows: peptides corresponding to BAF57 (amino acids 394–411, ATVEEPPTDPIPEDEKKE) and BAF57v (amino acids 349–363, CPRKTLTSRYTDFPD) were synthesized, injected into rabbits, and used to prepare peptide affinity columns for antibody purification from antisera by ResGen (Invitrogen). Anti-CoREST monoclonal was generated following standard hybridoma methodology (34Trimmer J.S. Trowbridge I.S. Vacquier V.D. Cell. 1985; 40: 697-703Google Scholar). The antibody was raised against GST fusion protein containing amino acids 101–293 of hCoREST. Anti-BRG1 and anti-BAF170 were kindly provided by G. R. Crabtree; preimmune rabbit IgG was from Sigma. Western blot analysis was carried out using standard techniques. Microinjection analysis was performed essentially as described previously (6Paquette A.J. Perez S.E. Anderson D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12318-12323Google Scholar). Prior to the injection, Rat-1 fibroblasts were rendered quiescent by incubation in serum-free medium for 24–36 h. Plasmids were injected into the nuclei of cells at a concentration of 100 mg/ml. In all cases, where no antibody was used in the experiment, preimmune rabbit or guinea pig IgG was co-injected. Injected cells were identified by co-injection of fluorescein-conjugated dextran (Molecular Probes). β-Galactosidase activity was detected by incubation with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactoside (X-gal). All cells showing any trace of blue staining were scored as positive for expression, to avoid any possible subjectivity in the analysis. All experiments were done at least two times, with a minimum of 250 microinjected cells in each experiment. A fragment of the human CoREST cDNA encoding amino acids 102–482 was fused to LexA and used as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen with a HeLa cell cDNA library. A screen of 9 × 106 transformants yielded several positive clones that failed to interact with unrelated LexA fusion proteins (data not shown). One of the positive cDNA clones encoded an open reading frame of 255 amino acids in-frame with the fused Gal4 activation domain. The first 235 amino acids were identical to a portion of BAF57, a known component of the hSWI·SNF ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complex, and corresponded to the amino acids coded by the exons 4 through 10 of the BAF57 gene (Fig. 1 a). The carboxyl terminus of the clone was distinct from the BAF57 sequence published previously. The clone corresponded to an alternatively spliced form containing a unique exon, exon 11 (shaded in Fig. 1 a). Exon 11 encodes 20 amino acids followed by a stop codon and the 3′-untranslated region. The alternatively spliced form was BAF57v (BAF57variant), and full-length cDNA was cloned by reverse transcriptase PCR using primers specifying the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of the human BAF57 cDNA. PCR amplification using these primers yielded two products corresponding to the expected cDNA sizes of both BAF57 and BAF57v. BAF57v cDNA encodes a putative protein of 363 amino acids of which the first 343 amino acids are identical to BAF57. Antibodies specific for BAF57 and BAF57v were raised against peptides from the unique carboxyl termini of each variant. The anti-BAF57v antibody recognized the recombinant hemagglutinin-tagged BAF57v from transfected HEK293 nuclear extracts, as well as the endogenous protein (45 kDa; Fig. 1 b). The presence of the respective immunizing peptides blocked immunoreactivity in the Western blots (data not shown). Like BAF57, BAF57v is expressed in several human cell lines of distinct cellular origin, both non-neuronal and neuronal (Fig.1 c). Co-immunoprecipitation assays using whole cell extracts of HEK293 cells revealed that the ATPase BRG1 was present in both anti-BAF57 and anti-BAF57v immunocomplexes suggesting that BAF57v, as well as BAF57, is associated with the hSWI·SNF complex (Fig.1 d). Using an antibody raised against an epitope shared by both the splice variants, we found that the two proteins were expressed to similar levels (data not shown). To define the minimal domains required for the interaction between CoREST and the BAF57 proteins, we performed a yeast two-hybrid assay. A family of deletion mutants of LexACoREST was generated and assayed for the ability to interact with Gal4ADBAF57v fusion protein in yeast (Fig.2 a). Full-length CoREST interacted strongly with full-length BAF57v in this assay. Deletional analysis showed that BAF57v interacted specifically with the carboxyl-terminal repressor domain of CoREST located between amino acids 292 and 442 (shaded in Fig. 2 a) (7Ballas N. Battaglioli E. Atouf F. Andres M.E. Chenoweth J. Anderson M.E. Burger C. Moniwa M. Davie J.R. Bowers W.J. Federoff H.J. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Brehm P. Mandel G. Neuron. 2001; 31: 353-365Google Scholar). A family of deleted BAF57v proteins fused to the Gal4AD was also generated and assessed for interaction with CoREST (Fig.2 b). The minimal fragment of BAF57v able to interact with CoREST contained amino acids 219 to 280, spanning the region in the molecule containing the coiled-coil domain. Full-length BAF57 did not interact with CoREST in two-hybrid assay (data not shown) although BAF57 and BAF57v share identical coiled-coil domains. To test whether this result was because of a peculiarity of the assay, we investigated the interaction between CoREST and both BAF57 and BAF57v in an in vitro assay independent of transcription. GST fusion proteins containing full-length BAF57 or full-length BAF57v were expressed and purified from bacteria and immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads. Fig. 3 a shows that in vitro-translated CoREST proteins labeled with [35S]methionine interacted with both GSTBAF57 and GSTBAF57v fusion proteins but not GST alone (Fig. 3 a). These results indicate that, in vitro, both BAF57 and BAF57v are able to interact with CoREST and that the CoREST carboxyl repressor domain interacts with the coiled-coil domain of the BAF57 proteins.Figure 3CoREST interacts with BAF57 in vitro and in vivo. a, CoREST-BAF57 interactions by GST pull-down assay.

Input corresponds to 10% of the total protein. b, Western blot indicating that whole cell immunoprecipitates from HEK293 cells using a monoclonal anti-CoREST antibody, but not preimmune IgG (PI IgG), contain BAF57 epitopes. Input corresponds to the 5% of the total cell extract.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To verify the relevance of thein vitro interaction between CoREST and the BAF57 proteins, we tested whether BAF57 and/or BAF57v were part of a CoREST complexin vivo. CoREST immunocomplexes from HEK293 whole cell extracts were analyzed by Western blotting for the presence of BAF57 and BAF57v. Fig. 3 b shows that BAF57 is part of the CoREST complex; we were unable to detect BAF57v epitopes in the CoREST immunoprecipitates (data not shown). Therefore, we focused our attention on the in vivo interaction between CoREST and BAF57. Our experiments showed that BAF57 and REST were in a complex together (Fig. 4 a), indicating that BAF57 is relevant for REST-mediated repression. Because BAF57 is part of the hSWI·SNF complex, we asked subsequently whether BRG1, the catalytic subunit of the hSWI·SNF complex, and BAF170, an additional hSWI·SNF component, were also associated with REST (Fig. 4,b–d). FLAG-tagged REST epitopes were present in anti-BRG1 and anti-BAF170 immunocomplexes isolated from whole cell extracts of HEK293 cells overexpressing FLAGREST (Fig. 4, band c). Additionally, anti-REST immunoprecipitates from HEK293 cells over-expressing BRG1 contained BRG1 epitopes (Fig.4 d). CoREST is also associated with BRG1 and BAF170 in immunocomplexes (Fig. 4, e and f). Thus, REST and CoREST are associated with components of the hSWI·SNF complex. However, because two hSWI·SNF complexes have been shown to contain Sin3 (29Kuzmichev A. Zhang Y. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 835-848Google Scholar, 30Sif S. Saurin A.J. Imbalzano A.N. Kingston R.E. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 603-618Google Scholar, 31Underhill C. Qutob M.S. Yee S.P. Torchia J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40463-40470Google Scholar), we cannot exclude the possibility that BRG1 could also be associated with REST through a Sin3 interaction. It has been shown that repression mediated by the carboxyl-terminal repressor domain of CoREST is trichostatin A-sensitive and can be relieved by microinjection of HDAC2 antibody (7Ballas N. Battaglioli E. Atouf F. Andres M.E. Chenoweth J. Anderson M.E. Burger C. Moniwa M. Davie J.R. Bowers W.J. Federoff H.J. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Brehm P. Mandel G. Neuron. 2001; 31: 353-365Google Scholar). The interaction between CoREST and BAF57 occurs through this repressor domain. Therefore, to determine whether components of the hSWI·SNF complex could target HDACs to a repressor complex containing the carboxyl repressor domain of CoREST, whole cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-BAF57, anti-BRG1, anti-BAF170, and anti-CoREST. These immunocomplexes all contained epitopes for HDACs 1 and 2 (Fig.4 g). We performed chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis of the Nav1.2 RE1 to identify proteins associated with this sequence. Antibodies directed against REST, CoREST, and BAF57 were used to immunoprecipitate chromatin from L6 muscle cells that do not express the Nav1.2 gene. Associated DNA fragments were amplified using primers that flanked the Nav1.2 RE1 sequence (304 bp; see Fig. 5 a) (7Ballas N. Battaglioli E. Atouf F. Andres M.E. Chenoweth J. Anderson M.E. Burger C. Moniwa M. Davie J.R. Bowers W.J. Federoff H.J. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Brehm P. Mandel G. Neuron. 2001; 31: 353-365Google Scholar). All three proteins occupied the RE1 sequence; no amplification products were observed using preimmune IgG or in the absence of any antibodies. The presence of BAF57 on the RE1 DNA sequence further supports the involvement of hSWI·SNF components in REST-mediated repression. The hSWI·SNF complex can be present on a genomic locus prior to the binding of a specific transcription factor or it can be targeted specifically to DNA through interactions with a transcription factor (35Peterson C.L. Workman J.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 187-192Google Scholar). To determine whether the targeting of BAF57 to the RE1 sequence depends upon REST, we took advantage of a stable neuronal PC12 cell line, PC12tetREST (6Paquette A.J. Perez S.E. Anderson D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12318-12323Google Scholar), in which REST expression was under control of doxycycline (dox) and in which REST was shown to repress the endogenous Nav1.2 gene. We analyzed the Nav1.2 RE1 element for occupancy by BAF57, in the absence (Fig. 5 b) and presence (Fig. 5 c) of REST expression. Neither CoREST nor BAF57 were present on the RE1 element in PC12tet cells despite the expression of both CoREST and BAF57. Chromatin immunoprecipitation with an anti-acetyl histone H4 antibody was used as control for chromatin quality (Fig. 5 b). Upon induction of REST expression in the PC12tetREST cell line, REST, CoREST, and BAF57 were all found to occupy the RE1 site (Fig. 5 c). These data suggest that BAF57 is recruited to the RE1 sequence only upon REST expression. Furthermore, to determine whether the induction of REST modified the chromatin of an endogenous gene in vivo, we compared the acetylation state of histone H4 proximal to the RE1 element in different cellular contexts using both semiquantitative and quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis (Fig. 5,a and b). The amount of H4 acetylated histone in PC12 cells was similar to that of the PC12tet line. In contrast, Rat1 fibroblast expressing endogenous REST, or PC12tetREST treated with dox showed a 50% reduction of H4 acetylation. The uninduced PC12tetREST cells expressed a low level of REST protein (data not shown), and this likely accounts for the lower level of Ac. H4 when compared with PC12 and PC12tet cells. The association of components of the hSWI·SNF complex with the REST·CoREST complex raises the question of the functional significance of this interaction. We tested the ability of REST to repress an RE1 tk-lacZ reporter gene in the presence of neutralizing antibodies. Under normal conditions in Rat1 fibroblasts, the reporter gene is repressed by the presence of the endogenous REST repressor complex. It has already been shown that the same reporter gene is de-repressed by the microinjection of both anti-REST and anti-CoREST antibodies (7Ballas N. Battaglioli E. Atouf F. Andres M.E. Chenoweth J. Anderson M.E. Burger C. Moniwa M. Davie J.R. Bowers W.J. Federoff H.J. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Brehm P. Mandel G. Neuron. 2001; 31: 353-365Google Scholar). Antibodies against BAF57, BRG1, or BAF170 relieved repression of the RE1 reporter gene (Fig.6). The amount of de-repression was quantified for each microinjection experiment and was expressed as the percentage of cells that stained positively for β-galactosidase in the total number of injected cells (fluorescein-positive) within a field. Microinjection of control antibody did not relieve repression. Furthermore, to exclude the possibility that microinjection of antibodies against the hSWI·SNF complex components could interfere with the general transcription machinery, we used as a control a reporter gene identical to the RE1 tk-lacZ except the upstream activating sequences replaces the RE1 sequence (6Paquette A.J. Perez S.E. Anderson D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12318-12323Google Scholar). This reporter was active in fibroblast, and we showed that the microinjection of BRG1, BAF57, or BAF170 did not affect basal activity (Fig. 6 b). Together these results indicate that REST repression of RE1 reporter gene requires the presence of components of the hSWI·SNF complex. It has been suggested previously that REST might utilize the Sin3 and CoREST complexes differentially depending upon their relative availabilities during development (9Grimes J.A. Nielsen S.J. Battaglioli E. Miska E.A. Speh J.C. Berry D.L. Atouf F. Holdener B.C. Mandel G. Kouzarides T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9461-9467Google Scholar). In this paper, we suggest an additional possibility. We have identified an interaction of CoREST with BAF57, a component of the hSWI·SNF ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complex. Further analysis revealed that REST was in complexes with the ATPase BRG1, as well as with BAF170, both intrinsic components of the hSWI·SNF complex. Microinjection experiments using specific antibodies against the ATPase BRG1, as well as against BAF57 and BAF170, relieved repression from a RE1-reporter gene, indicating that these components were required for repression in this assay. Thus, it is possible that the presence of two repressor domains in CoREST reflects a requirement for remodeling activity recruited by the carboxyl-terminal repressor domain. Our results suggest that BAF57 targets the hSWI·SNF complex to the Nav1.2 RE1 DNA element by binding to CoREST via its coiled-coil domain. This role for BAF57 is consistent with the idea that specific subunits of the hSWI·SNF complex might either modulate the activity of the core ATPase (36Phelan M.L. Sif S. Narlikar G.J. Kingston R.E. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 247-253Google Scholar) or be involved in the targeting of the complex to specific sites in chromatin (19Kingston R.E. Narlikar G.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2339-2352Google Scholar, 37Narlikar G.J. Fan H.Y. Kingston R.E. Cell. 2002; 108: 475-487Google Scholar). Our findings with BAF57 are similar to the findings for two other hSWI·SNF subunits, hSNF5/Ini1/BAF47 (38Wu D.Y. Kalpana G.V. Goff S.P. Schubach W.H. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6020-6028Google Scholar) and BAF250 (39Nie Z. Xue Y. Yang D. Zhou S. Deroo B.J. Archer T.K. Wang W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8879-8888Google Scholar). Interaction of hSNF5/Ini1/BAF47 with the co-activator EBNA2 leads to the recruitment of BRG1 to a specific set of target genes controlled by the DNA-binding proteins RBP-JK and PV.1 (38Wu D.Y. Kalpana G.V. Goff S.P. Schubach W.H. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6020-6028Google Scholar). Similarly, BAF250 is involved in the targeting of the remodeling complex to genes regulated by the glucocorticoid receptor, by directly interacting with the glucocorticoid receptor (39Nie Z. Xue Y. Yang D. Zhou S. Deroo B.J. Archer T.K. Wang W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8879-8888Google Scholar). In addition to containing a coiled-coil motif, BAF57 is an HMG protein. Its ability to bind to cruciform DNA structures (33Wang W. Chi T. Xue Y. Zhou S. Kuo A. Crabtree G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 492-498Google Scholar) suggests that it might also contribute to stabilization of the interaction of the hSWI·SNF complex with the DNA. Another HMG protein, BRAF35 (BRACA-2-associatedfactor 35), has recently been shown to be a component of a CoREST·HDAC core-complex purified from HeLa cells (40Hakimi M.A. Bochar D.A. Chenoweth J. Lane W.S. Mandel G. Shiekhattar R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7420-7425Google Scholar). Like BAF57, BRAF35 also contains a coiled-coil domain. Whether BRAF35 interacts directly with CoREST is not known, but it could subserve a similar “bridge” function in another CoREST complex. The presence of multiple copies of the same structural motif in the REST·CoREST repressor complex is not restricted to the HMG and coiled-coil domains of BAF57 and BRAF35. Another domain present in more than one copy in the complex is the SANT domain, a domain common to several other transcriptional activators and repressors that may have evolved from the myb DNA binding domain. The SANT domain can mediate DNA binding and protein-protein interactions (41Aasland R. Stewart A.F. Gibson T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 87-88Google Scholar). CoREST itself contains two SANT motifs that are required for repression. SANT domain I is required for interaction with REST and is involved in recruiting HDAC activity (7Ballas N. Battaglioli E. Atouf F. Andres M.E. Chenoweth J. Anderson M.E. Burger C. Moniwa M. Davie J.R. Bowers W.J. Federoff H.J. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Brehm P. Mandel G. Neuron. 2001; 31: 353-365Google Scholar, 14You A. Tong J.K. Grozinger C.M. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1454-1458Google Scholar). We show here that SANT domain II is involved in the interaction with BAF57, in addition to recruiting HDAC activity. At least four additional components of the REST·CoREST complex contain SANT or SANT-like domains: KIAA0601 (a protein with homology to polyamine oxidases) (14You A. Tong J.K. Grozinger C.M. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1454-1458Google Scholar, 15Humphrey G.W. Wang Y. Russanova V.R. Hirai T. Qin J. Nakatani Y. Howard B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6817-6824Google Scholar, 40Hakimi M.A. Bochar D.A. Chenoweth J. Lane W.S. Mandel G. Shiekhattar R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7420-7425Google Scholar), BAF170 (42Wang W. Xue Y. Zhou S. Kuo A. Cairns B.R. Crabtree G.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2117-2130Google Scholar), and HDACs 1 and 2 (Fig.7). Interestingly, MeCP2, another protein involved in repression, also contains a SANT-like motif. Thus, it is likely that these conserved domains provide “hot spots” for building distinct complexes with similar components. How might ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling activity affect REST-mediated repression? ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling has been postulated to be involved at different levels in gene regulation. It can facilitate the binding of a transcription factor to its cognate DNA binding site by relocating nucleosomes and exposing the DNA target. Alternatively, it can be targeted by a transcription factor to a specific genomic site and regulate recruitment and/or the enzymatic activity of other factors in situ (37Narlikar G.J. Fan H.Y. Kingston R.E. Cell. 2002; 108: 475-487Google Scholar). In the case of the Mi-2·NURD complex, which contains both HDACs and ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling components, enhanced deacetylase activity is dependent upon ATP, a result that suggests that nucleosome remodeling improves the access or the affinity of HDACs to chromatin (43Tong J.K. Hassig C.A. Schnitzler G.R. Kingston R.E. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1998; 395: 917-921Google Scholar). On the other hand, genetic and biochemical evidence suggests that the activity of theDrosophila Imitation Switch (ISWI) ATPase is affected by the acetylation state of histone H4 (44Corona D.F. Clapier C.R. Becker P.B. Tamkun J.W. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 242-247Google Scholar). In our study, we show that the recruitment of BAF57 to the RE1 sequence occurs only upon expression of the DNA-binding protein, REST. Therefore, the hSWI·SNF complex might modulate the enzymatic activity of other components in the chromatin-remodeling complex, for example the HDACs associated with the REST complex. The need to recruit complexes with distinct activities for the repression of specific genes has been shown for other transcription factors (37Narlikar G.J. Fan H.Y. Kingston R.E. Cell. 2002; 108: 475-487Google Scholar). It has been suggested that coordination among different chromatin-remodeling activities might involve a “histone code” that reflects specific combinations of covalent and non-covalent histone modifications for each promoter (45Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Google Scholar, 46Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Google Scholar). The modular structure of REST, and its association both with factors that covalently modify histones and factors that are involved in ATP-dependent remodeling of chromatin, presents an opportunity to characterize the histone code (46Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Google Scholar) responsible for REST-mediated, long-term neuronal gene repression. We thank Dr. James S. Trimmer and Lynn Buchwalder for generating the monoclonal antibody to CoREST. We also gratefully acknowledge the helpful discussions with Dr. Nurit Ballas, Dr. Ivan A. Olave, and Dr. Richard H. Goodman."

https://openalex.org/W1998592507,"Neuronal cell membranes are particularly rich in gangliosides, which play important roles in brain physiology and pathology. Previously, we reported that gangliosides could act as microglial activators and are thus likely to participate in many neuronal diseases. In the present study we provide evidence that JAK-STAT inflammatory signaling mediates gangliosides-stimulated microglial activation. Both in rat primary microglia and murine BV2 microglial cells, gangliosides stimulated nuclear factor binding to GAS/ISRE elements, which are known to be STAT-binding sites. Consistent with this, gangliosides rapidly activated JAK1 and JAK2 and induced phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3. In addition, gangliosides increased transcription of the inflammation-associated genes inducible nitric-oxide syn- thase, ICAM-1, and MCP-1, which are reported to contain STAT-binding elements in their promoter regions. AG490, a JAK inhibitor, reduced induction of these genes, nuclear factor binding activity, and activation of STAT1 and -3 in gangliosides-treated microglia. AG490 also inhibited gangliosides-induced release of nitric oxide, an inflammation hallmark. Furthermore, AG490 markedly reduced activation of ERK1/2 MAPK, indicating that ERKs act downstream of JAK-STAT signaling during microglial activation. However, AG490 did not affect activation of p38 MAPK. We also report that the sialic acid residues present on gangliosides may be one of the essential components in activation of JAK-STAT signaling.

The present study indicates that JAK-STAT signaling is an early event in gangliosides-induced brain inflammatory responses. Gangliosides are sialic acid-containing glycosphingolipids that are constituents of mammalian cell membranes. Gangliosides are particularly abundant in neuronal cell membranes and participate in various cellular events of the nervous system (1Derry D.M. Wolfe L.S. Science. 1967; 158: 1450-1452Google Scholar, 2Rodden F.R. Wiegandt H. Bauer B.L. J. Neurosurg. 1991; 74: 606-619Google Scholar). The major types of gangliosides in the brain are GM1, GD1a, GD1b, GT1b, and GQ1b, which differ in their profiles of sialic acid residues and carbohydrate moieties. Several lines of evidence point to the importance of the brain-derived gangliosides in immune responses and the pathogenesis of brain disease. There are reports that brain injury can cause release of gangliosides from damaged neuronal cells into the extracellular space, which may lead to pathophysiological conditions (3Michikawa M. Gong J. Fan Q. Sawamura N. Yanagisawa K. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7226-7235Google Scholar, 4Blennow K. Davidsson P. Walin A. Fredman P. Gottfries C.G. Karlsson I. Mansson J.E. Svennerholm L. Arch.

Gangliosides have also been reported to interact with Aβ, suggesting they play a role in Aβ toxicity as well as in the deposition of Aβ into senile plaques associated with Alzheimer's disease (6Yanagisawa K. Okada A. Suzuki N. Ihara Y. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 1062-1066Google Scholar, 7Ledesma M.D. Silva J.S.D. Cassaerts K. Delacourte A. Strooper B.D. Dotti C.G.

Chem. 2001; 276: 42027-42034Google Scholar). In addition, gangliosides regulate the production of various inflammatory mediators, such as cytokines and inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) 1The abbreviations used are: iNOS, inducible nitric-oxide synthase; NO, nitric oxide; JAK-STAT, JAK-STAT, Janus kinase-signal transducers and activators of transcription; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MAPKs, mitogen-activated protein kinases; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; GAS/ISRE, γ-interferon-activated sequence/interferon-α-stimulated response element; RT, reverse transcription; MCP-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1; ICAM-1, intercellular adhesion molecule-1; IFN, interferon; IL, interleukin.

Despite the evidence of a role for gangliosides in brain pathology, there appears to be little known about how gangliosides act. Janus kinase-signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK-STAT) signaling pathways have been reported to be involved not only in the immune response of numerous cytokines but also in the actions of primarily non-immune mediators such as growth factors and hormones. Specific subtypes of JAK and STAT molecules are activated by different signals, resulting in specificity of response (12Kishimoto T. Taga T. Akira S. Cell. 1994; 76: 253-262Google Scholar, 13Igaz P. Toth S. Falus A. Inflamm. Res. 2001; 50: 435-441Google Scholar). The binding of ligand to its receptor induces assembly of an active receptor complex and consequent phosphorylation of the receptor-associated JAKs (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2). Phosphorylated JAKs lead to the activation of neighboring JAKs, receptor subunits, and several other substrates. Phosphorylation of JAKs provides the docking sites for STATs, which in turn become phosphorylated on tyrosine and serine residues; the phosphorylation of both amino acid species is required for full STAT activity. Phosphorylated STATs are released from the receptor complex and form dimers. These dimers translocate to the nucleus where they directly bind to the promoter region of specific target genes, thus regulating transcription of these genes, many of which are involved in immune responses (13Igaz P. Toth S. Falus A. Inflamm. Res. 2001; 50: 435-441Google Scholar, 14Kovarik P. Mangold M. Ramsauer K. Heidari H. Steinborn R. Zotter A. Levy D.E. Muller M. Decker T.

Microglia are the major immune effector cells in the brain, and microglial activation is an early event in central nervous system inflammation (17Streit W.J. Walter S.A. Pennell N.A. Prog. Neurobiol. (New York). 1999; 57: 563-581Google Scholar, 18Fischer H. Reichmann G. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 2717-2726Google Scholar). Previously, we demonstrated that gangliosides could activate microglia, inducing release of inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor-α and nitric oxide (NO) (10Pyo H. Joe E. Jung S. Lee S.H. Jou I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34589-34594Google Scholar, 19Yang M.S. Park E.J. Sohn S. Kwon H.S. Shin W.H. Pyo H.K. Jin B. Choi K.S. Jou I. Joe E. Glia. 2002; 38: 273-280Google Scholar). Here we show that the molecular mechanisms underlying this gangliosides-induced activation of microglia include triggering of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Bovine brain gangliosides mixture, GM1 and GD1a, was purchased from Matreya (Pleasant Gap, PA). Asialoganglioside GM1 was from Sigma. Rat IFN-γ, α-cyano-(3,4-dihydroxy)-N-benzylcinnamide (AG490), and PD98059 were from Calbiochem. Anthrobacter ureafaciensneuraminidase was from Sigma. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and minimal essential medium were from Invitrogen. Antibodies against STAT1, Tyr-701-phosphorylated STAT1, Ser-727-phosphorylated STAT1, and Tyr-705-phosphorylated STAT3 were from Cell Signaling Technology(Beverly, MA). Antibodies against phosphorylated ERK, ERK, and phosphorylated p38 were from Calbiochem. Antibodies against phosphorylated JAK1 and -2 were from Affinity Bioreagents (Denver, CO). Primary microglia were cultured from the cerebral cortices of 1–3-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats as described previously (10Pyo H. Joe E. Jung S. Lee S.H. Jou I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34589-34594Google Scholar). Briefly, the cortices were triturated into single cells in minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) and plated in 75-cm2 T-flasks (0.5 hemisphere/flask) for 2–3 weeks. Microglia were then detached from the flasks by mild shaking and filtered through a nylon mesh to remove astrocytes. Cells were plated in 6-well plates (7 × 104 cells/well), 60-mm dishes (5 × 105cells/dish), or 100-mm dishes (106 cells/well). One hour later, the cells were washed to remove unattached cells before being used in experiments. BV2 immortalized murine microglia cells were from Dr. E. J. Choi. The BV2 cell line was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. Cells were serum-starved overnight before treatment with gangliosides. Cells were harvested and suspended in 9 times packaged cell volume of a hypotonic solution (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) including 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Cells were centrifuged at 500 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the pellet (nuclear fraction) was saved. The nuclear fractions were resuspended in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 0.4m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, incubated on ice for 60 min with occasional gentle shaking, and centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for 20 min. The crude nuclear proteins in the supernatant were collected and stored at −70 °C for EMSA. EMSA was performed for 30 min on ice in a volume of 20 μl, containing 4 μg of nuclear protein extract in a reaction buffer containing 8.5 mmEDTA, 8.5 mm EGTA, 8% glycerol, 0.1 mmZnSO4, 50 μg/ml poly(dI-dC), 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 6 mmMgCl2, and γ−32P-radiolabeled oligonucleotide probe (3 × 104 cpm), with or without 20–50-fold excess unlabeled probe. In supershift experiments, protein extracts were incubated with 0.2–0.5 μg of STAT1 and STAT3 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 30 min prior to the addition of 32P-labeled probe. DNA-protein complexes were separated on 6% polyacrylamide gels in Tris/glycine buffer. The dried gels were exposed to x-ray film. The following double-stranded oligonucleotide was used in these studies: GAS/ISRE, 5′-AAGTACTTTCAGTTTCATATTACTCTA-3′, 27 bp (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., sc-2537). 5′-End-labeled probes were prepared with 40 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega) and were purified on Quick Spin Columns Sephadex G-25 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Total RNA was extracted using RNAzol B (Tel-Test Inc.) and cDNA was prepared using reverse transcriptase that originated from avian myeloblastosis virus (Takara), according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR was performed with 30 cycles of sequential reactions as follows: 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. Oligonucleotide primers were purchased from Bioneer (Seoul, Korea). The sequences of PCR primers are as follows: (reverse) 5′-GCAGAATGTGACCATCATGG-3′ and (forward) 5′-ACAACCTTGGTGTTGAAGGC-3′ for iNOS; (reverse) 5′-AAGGCCGCAGAGAGCAAAAGAAGC-3′ and (forward) 5′-CTGGAGAGCACAAACAGCAGAG-3′ for ICAM-1; (reverse) 5′-ATGCAGGTCTCTGTCACGCT-3′ and (forward) 5′-CTAGTTCTCTGTCATACTGG-3′ for MCP-1; (reverse) 5′-AGATCCACAACGGATACATT-3′ and (forward) 5′-TCCCTCAAGATTGTCAGCAA-3′ for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed in ice-cold modified RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmNa3VO4, and 1 mm NaF) containing protease inhibitors (2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 mm EDTA). The lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 × g at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was incubated with primary antibodies and peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and then visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Sigma). Media nitrite concentration was measured as an indication of NO release. Following the indicated cell incubations, 50 μl of culture medium was removed and mixed with an equal volume of Griess reagent (0.1% naphthylethylenediamine, 1% sulfanilamide, 2.5% H3PO4), and absorbance of the mixture at 540 nm was measured. Neuraminidase derived from A. ureafaciens was used for cleaving sialic acids residues from gangliosides. Gangliosides were dissolved in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, containing 1 μg of sodium cholate per μl and were incubated with A. ureafaciens neuraminidase (Sigma) at 37 °C for 2 h. Functional GAS/ISRE elements are found in the promoter regions of several inflammation-related genes, such as iNOS, and these elements are known to bind the phosphorylated STAT dimer (15Park C. Schindler C. Methods. 1998; 15: 175-188Google Scholar, 20Xuan Y.-T. Guo Y. Han H. Zhu Y. Bolli R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9050-9055Google Scholar, 21Ehret G.B. Reichenbach P.

In an attempt to explore the molecular mechanism of gangliosides on microglial activation, we investigated whether STATs could be involved in gangliosides-induced activation of microglia. We first examined the transcript level of iNOS in gangliosides-treated rat primary microglia. Gangliosides markedly induced iNOS mRNA within 1 h, suggesting that gangliosides directly regulate NO production at the level of transcription (Fig.1 A). Our assumption was subsequently evaluated by EMSA using a γ-32P-labeled consensus GAS/ISRE oligonucleotides probe. After the cells were treated with 50 μg/ml brain-derived ganglioside mixture for the indicated times, nuclear extracts were prepared and then analyzed by EMSA. The specific binding complex was detected in nuclear extracts from gangliosides-treated rat primary and murine BV2 microglia (Fig. 1,A and B). Time course analysis showed that gangliosides rapidly induced the nuclear factor binding within 5 min and that the binding activity was decreased to basal levels after 30 min in both microglial cell types (Fig. 1 B and data not shown). The specificity of the shifted bands was confirmed by competition assay using excess amounts of unlabeled oligonucleotides (Fig. 1 B). In addition, gel shift assay showed that the binding complex was diminished by addition of anti-STAT1 and anti-STAT3, indicating that both STAT1 and STAT3 are constituents of the nuclear factor binding complex (Fig. 1 C). These results show that functional GAS/ISRE elements may be involved in gangliosides-induced activation of microglia. Essential roles for STAT signaling in brain inflammatory response have emerged (20Xuan Y.-T. Guo Y. Han H. Zhu Y. Bolli R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9050-9055Google Scholar, 23Ganster R.W. Taylor B.S. Shao L. Geller D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8638-8643Google Scholar, 24Gao J.J. Morrison D.C. Parmely T.J. Russell S.W. Murphy W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1226-1230Google Scholar). Because gangliosides rapidly induced the GAS/ISRE-nuclear factor binding, we examined whether gangliosides indeed caused phosphorylation of STAT proteins. Primary microglial cells were stimulated with 50 μg/ml gangliosides for the indicated times, and the levels of phosphorylated STAT1 were determined by Western blot analysis using antibodies against Tyr-701-STAT1 and Ser-727-STAT1. Both phosphorylations of STAT1 occurred within 1 min of gangliosides addition and then decreased at 30 min (Fig.2 A). Similar patterns of phosphorylation were observed in lysates from murine BV2 microglial cells, where incubation of cells with gangliosides resulted in STAT1 phosphorylation on tyrosine and serine residues, with phosphorylation levels returning to basal at 30 min (Fig. 2 B). In addition to phosphorylation of STAT1, we detected gangliosides-induced phosphorylation of STAT3 in both microglial cell types. The pattern of STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation appeared similar to that of STAT1 phosphorylation (Fig. 2, A and B). The Western blotting data show that gangliosides trigger rapid phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3, suggesting their involvement in gangliosides-induced microglial activation. The phosphorylation patterns of both STAT1 and STAT3 determined by Western blotting correlate with the binding activity results from EMSA. Phosphorylation of STATs depends on the activation of JAKs (25Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R.G. Silvermann R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Google Scholar). JAKs both functionally and physically associate with cytokine signaling. In particular, activation of JAK1 and JAK2 provides a molecular explanation for cellular actions of a broad range of cytokines (26Schindler C. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 7-14Google Scholar, 27O'Shea J. Immunity. 1997; 7: 1-11Google Scholar). Thus, we investigated whether JAK1 and JAK2 could be involved in gangliosides-induced STAT phosphorylation. Primary rat microglial cells were stimulated with 50 μg/ml gangliosides for the indicated times, and cell lysates were Western blotted using antibodies directed against phosphorylated JAK1 and JAK2. The data presented in Fig. 3 A show that following addition of gangliosides to cells, phosphorylation of both JAK1 and JAK2 occurred within 5 min, after which phosphorylation levels returned to basal levels by 30 min. The involvement of JAK signaling in gangliosides-induced microglial activation was also shown using a second, independent approach. The pharmacological agent AG490 is known to inhibit the phosphorylation of both JAK1 and JAK2 (20Xuan Y.-T. Guo Y. Han H. Zhu Y. Bolli R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9050-9055Google Scholar). We found that pretreatment of rat primary microglial cells with AG490 effectively reduced gangliosides-induced phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 (Fig. 3 B). In addition, AG490 inhibited the nuclear factor binding to GAS/ISRE nucleotides in gangliosides-treated microglial cells (Fig. 3 C). These results indicate that gangliosides induce phosphorylation and activation of STAT1 and STAT3 through phosphorylation and activation of JAK1 and JAK2. Brain inflammatory responses are coordinated by the production of cytokines, chemokines, and reactive oxygen species (17Streit W.J. Walter S.A. Pennell N.A. Prog. Neurobiol. (New York). 1999; 57: 563-581Google Scholar). The above data indicate that gangliosides-induced microglial activation may be mediated, at least in part, by JAK-STAT-dependent transcriptional responses. Therefore, we examined the transcript level of genes that have been reported previously (29Tessitore A. Pastore L. Rispoli A. Cilenti L. Toniato E. Flati V. Farina A.R. Frati L. Gulino A. Martinotti S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 968-975Google Scholar, 30Zhou Z.H. Chaturvedi P. Han Y.L. Aras S., Li, Y.S. Kolattukudy P.E. Ping D. Boss J.M. Ransohoff R.M. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 3908-3916Google Scholar) to have functional GAS elements and act as mediators of inflammation, namely monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). Rat primary microglial cells and BV2 cells were stimulated with 50 μg/ml gangliosides for 3 h, and total RNA was extracted for RT-PCR analysis. Addition of gangliosides rapidly increased the mRNA levels of both MCP-1 and ICAM-1, as did IFN-γ, which was included as a positive control (Fig.4 A). Pretreatment with AG490 significantly inhibited gangliosides-induced transcription of both genes (Fig. 4 B). These findings demonstrate that gangliosides trigger STAT-dependent transcriptional activation of inflammatory genes in microglia. NO is known as an important physiological signaling molecule in the brain. Aberrant iNOS expression and excessive NO production are observed in various pathophysiological conditions (31Ganster R.W. Geller D.A. Ignaro L. Nitric Oxide: Biology and Pathobiology. Academic, San Diego2000: 129-156Google Scholar). Previously, we showed (10Pyo H. Joe E. Jung S. Lee S.H. Jou I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34589-34594Google Scholar) that gangliosides-induced microglial activation was accompanied by induction of NO release. Thus, we tested whether gangliosides induced NO release via JAK-STAT signaling. First, we examined the effect of JAK inhibition on gangliosides-induced transcription of iNOS in rat primary microglial cells. RT-PCR analysis showed that the inhibitor AG490 reduced mRNA levels of iNOS (Fig. 5). Second, we investigated the effect of AG490 on NO release. In these studies, the ERK inhibitor, PD98059, was also used since we have shown previously (10Pyo H. Joe E. Jung S. Lee S.H. Jou I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34589-34594Google Scholar) that it reduced gangliosides-induced NO release. In the presence of AG490, microglial cells were treated with 50 μg/ml gangliosides for 48 h, and the amount of NO produced was determined by measuring the amount of nitrite converted from NO in the media. AG490 significantly reduced gangliosides-enhanced NO release, as did PD98059 (Fig. 5). Compared with cells treated with gangliosides alone, NO release was reduced to 38.6 ± 4.3 and 25.2 ± 14% in cells co-treated with PD98059 and AG490, respectively. These results are consistent with the results shown in Figs. 3 and 4. The findings indicate that JAK-STAT signaling is required for NO release and provide evidence of the critical functional involvement of JAK-STAT signaling in gangliosides-induced microglial activation. There are several reports (32David M. Petricoin III, E. Benjamin C. Pine R. Weber M.J. Lancer A.C. Science. 1995; 269: 1721-1723Google Scholar, 33Takaoka A. Tanaka N. Mitani Y. Miyazaki T. Fujii H. Sato M. Kovarik P. Decker T. Schlessinger J. Taniguchi T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2480-2488Google Scholar) showing that the transcriptional activity of STATs is regulated through mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). MAPKs are considered as common intracellular signaling molecules involved in microglial activation. Previous reports by others and us (10Pyo H. Joe E. Jung S. Lee S.H. Jou I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34589-34594Google Scholar, 34Gouni-Berthold I. Seul C., Ko, Y. Hescheler J. Sachinidis A. Hypertension. 2001; 38: 1030-1037Google Scholar) showed that gangliosides induced activation of MAPKs in microglia. In the present study, we used pharmacological inhibitors to examine possible cross-talk between the JAK-STAT and MAPKs signaling pathways. When primary rat microglial cells were pretreated for 2 h with the JAK inhibitor AG490, gangliosides-induced activation of ERK1/2 was significantly reduced compared with controls with no AG490 (Fig.6). In contrast, no significant suppression of p38 was observed under this condition. However, in the presence of PD98059, an ERK inhibitor, not only ERK but also p38 activation was completely inhibited. These results indicate that gangliosides-stimulated JAK activation leads to activation of ERK in microglial cells. These pharmacological studies also indicate that gangliosides-stimulated activation of p38 may not be due to activation of ERK by JAK. The major types of gangliosides in brain are GM1, GD1a, GD1b, GT1b, and GQ1b. These gangliosides differ with respect to the number and position of sialic acid residues attached to the carbohydrates (35Dreyfus H. Guerold B. Freysz L. Hicks D. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 249: 67-78Google Scholar). The approximate percentages of each ganglioside present in the brain gangliosides mixture used in the current study are 18% GM1, 55% GD1a, 15% GD1b, 10% GT1b, and 2% others. To address whether the structural diversity of gangliosides affected activation of STAT, we compared the effect of GM1, which has one molecule of sialic acid, with GD1a, which has two molecules of sialic acid, on phosphorylation of STAT1. Primary microglial cells were treated with GM1 or GD1a for 2 min, and levels of phosphorylated STAT1 were determined by Western blot analysis using antibodies against Tyr-701-STAT1. The data in Fig.7 A show both GM1 and GD1a stimulated phosphorylation of STAT1 within 2 min. The level of STAT1 phosphorylation stimulated by either GM1 or GD1a was similar to that caused by the gangliosides mixture, suggesting that the number of sialic acid residues per ganglioside molecule has little effect on the phosphorylation of STAT1 in microglial cells (Fig. 7 A). Because sialic acid residues are characteristic of gangliosides, we examined whether sialic acid residues were important for gangliosides-stimulated STAT phosphorylation. Gangliosides were preincubated with either 550 or 1000 units/ml A. ureafaciensneuraminidase, which is known to release sialic acid attached to an internal galactose in any gangliosides including GM1 (36Saito M. Sugano K. Nagai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7845-7854Google Scholar, 37Kielczynski W. Harrison L.C. Leedman P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1991-1995Google Scholar). Primary microglia cells were stimulated with gangliosides or neuraminidase-treated gangliosides (desialylated gangliosides) for 2 min, and levels of phosphorylated STAT1 were determined by Western blot analysis. The data presented in Fig. 7 B show a dose-dependent inhibitory effect of neuraminidase treatment on phosphorylation of STAT1, indicating that sialic acid residues are required for stimulation of JAK-STAT signaling. To rule out the possibility that these reductions are due to contaminating sialic acid or neuraminidase, we compared the effect of GM1 and asialo-GM1(Sigma) on phosphorylation of STAT and transcription of STAT-responsive genes. Consistent with Fig. 7, not only the phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 but also the transcriptions of iNOS, MCP-1, and ICAM-1 were not induced in asialo-GM1-treated primary microglial cells (Fig. 8). Taken together, these results suggest that the presence of sialic acid residues is important for gangliosides-stimulated JAK-STAT signaling, although the number of sialic residues per ganglioside molecule may not influence phosphorylation.Figure 8Asialo-GM1 does not activate the JAK-STAT signaling in primary microglial cells.

These functions appear to occur simultaneously and influence each other (38Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18713-18716Google Scholar). Identification of the precise mechanisms underlying how gangliosides regulate cellular responses has been the subject of many investigations, but it appears there is still much that is unknown (11Kanda N. Watanabe S. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 72-80Google Scholar, 34Gouni-Berthold I. Seul C., Ko, Y. Hescheler J. Sachinidis A. Hypertension. 2001; 38: 1030-1037Google Scholar, 39Kassahara K. Watanabe Y. Yamamoto T. Sanai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29947-29953Google Scholar). In this study, we reveal that gangliosides directly induce the activation of JAK-STAT signaling, a key pathway in inflammation, which leads to the expression of several inflammation-associated genes. JAK-STAT signaling has been reported to be closely involved in inflammation. Although STAT proteins were discovered during the course of analysis of interferon signaling, recent studies (40Fu X.-Y.

Recently, we showed that this predominantly microsomal protein is also localized in rat hepatic mitochondria. In this report, we show that the N-terminal 30 amino acids of CYP2E1 contain a chimeric signal for bimodal targeting of the apoprotein to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria. We demonstrate that the cryptic mitochondrial targeting signal at sequence 21–31 of the protein is activated by cAMP-dependent phosphorylation at Ser-129. S129A mutation resulted in lower affinity for binding to cytoplasmic Hsp70, mitochondrial translocases (TOM40 and TIM44) and reduced mitochondrial import. S129A mutation, however, did not affect the extent of binding to the signal recognition particle and association with ER membrane translocator protein Sec61. Addition of saturating levels of signal recognition particle caused only a partial inhibition of CYP2E1 translation under in vitro conditions, and saturating levels of ER resulted only in partial membrane integration. cAMP enhanced the mitochondrial CYP2E1 (referred to as P450MT5) level but did not affect its level in the ER. Our results provide new insights on the mechanism of cAMP-mediated activation of a cryptic mitochondrial targeting signal and regulation of P450MT5 targeting to mitochondria.

Our results provide new insights on the mechanism of cAMP-mediated activation of a cryptic mitochondrial targeting signal and regulation of P450MT5 targeting to mitochondria. Accurate targeting of proteins to their designated subcellular compartments is critical for maintaining the distinctive structural and functional characteristics of individual cellular components. At least three major types of import/transport systems have been described for targeting proteins translated in the cytoplasm to different organelles in the eukaryotic cells. 1) Proteins destined for the ER, 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; CYP, cytochrome P450; db-cAMP, dibutyryl cAMP; DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; DTT, dithiothreitol; Hsp, heat shock protein; CyHsp70, cytoplasmic Hsp70; MtHsp70, mitochondrial Hsp70; MBS, m-maleimidobenzoyl- N-hydroxysuccinimidate ester; S-MBS, m-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysulfosuccinimidate ester; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; MPP, matrix processing peptidase; PPL, preprolactin; PKA, protein kinase A; PKI, protein kinase A inhibitor myristoylated peptide; RRL, rabbit reticulocyte lysate; SRP, signal recognition particle; TIM, translocase of the inner membrane; TOM, translocase of the outer membrane; WGL, wheat germ lysate; WT, wild-type. 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; CYP, cytochrome P450; db-cAMP, dibutyryl cAMP; DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; DTT, dithiothreitol; Hsp, heat shock protein; CyHsp70, cytoplasmic Hsp70; MtHsp70, mitochondrial Hsp70; MBS, m-maleimidobenzoyl- N-hydroxysuccinimidate ester; S-MBS, m-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysulfosuccinimidate ester; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; MPP, matrix processing peptidase; PPL, preprolactin; PKA, protein kinase A; PKI, protein kinase A inhibitor myristoylated peptide; RRL, rabbit reticulocyte lysate; SRP, signal recognition particle; TIM, translocase of the inner membrane; TOM, translocase of the outer membrane; WGL, wheat germ lysate; WT, wild-type. Golgi, plasma membrane, and also those secreted out of cells, are targeted to the ER through a signal recognition particle (SRP)-dependent mechanism. This pathway is mostly co-translational and involves the delivery of nascent chains by SRP to the translocon complex on the ER membrane (1Schatz G. Dobberstein B. Science. 1996; 271: 1519-1526Google Scholar, 2Keenan R.J. Freymann D.M. Stroud R.M. Walter P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 755-775Google Scholar). 2) Protein targeting to mitochondria occurs mostly by a post-translational mechanism, although exceptions to this generality have been reported (3Lithgow T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 22-26Google Scholar, 4Fujiki M. Verner K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1914-1920Google Scholar). As part of the mitochondrial targeting pathway, an unfolded polypeptide is brought in contact with the outer and inner membrane translocase complexes (TOM and TIM, respectively) (5Neupert W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 863-917Google Scholar). The protein is unidirectionally translocated through transmembrane protein channels formed of TOM40 and TIM23/TIM17 subunits, and its entry into the matrix space is finally facilitated by an ATP-dependent pull exerted by the mitochondrial Hsp70 chaperone protein (6Schneider H.C. Berthold J. Bauer M.F. Dietmeier K. Guiard B. Brunner M. Neupert W. Nature. 1994; 371: 768-777Google Scholar). 3) The peroxisomal protein targeting, although it occurs post-translationally, involves a distinct set of cytosolic receptors. These proteins not only guide the precursor proteins to the peroxisomal membrane receptor Pex, they also lead the polypeptide into the matrix compartment and eventually recycle back to the cytosol for reutilization (7Smith M.D. Schnell D.J. Cell. 2001; 105: 293-296Google Scholar, 8Subramani S. Koller A. Snyder W.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 399-418Google Scholar). As predicted by the signal hypothesis, the targeting specificity of proteins is dictated by the signal sequences that function as specific “address codes” (2Keenan R.J. Freymann D.M. Stroud R.M. Walter P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 755-775Google Scholar). The signal sequences required for protein targeting to the ER, mitochondria and peroxisomes are quite different, and it is generally believed that a protein may carry only one type of signal, thus ensuring its targeting to the correct membrane compartment.In contrast to this general view, recent studies from our laboratory showed that xenobiotic inducible CYP1A1 and CYP2B1 contain “atypical” signals at the N termini, which we named “chimeric signals,” that were capable of targeting the apoprotein chains to both the ER and mitochondria under in vitro and in vivo conditions (9Addya S. Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Biswas G. Bhagwhat S.V. Mullick J. Avadhani N.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 589-599Google Scholar, 10Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Biswas G. Mullick J. Sepuri N.B.V. Otvos L. Pain D. Avadhani N.G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5494-5504Google Scholar). In the case of CYP1A1, the protein chains that escaped ER targeting (∼25% of the total pool) were cleaved past N-terminal residues 4 and 32, thereby activating a cryptic mitochondrial targeting signal (9Addya S. Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Biswas G. Bhagwhat S.V. Mullick J. Avadhani N.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 589-599Google Scholar). In the case of CYP2B1, an intact but Ser-128-phosphorylated protein was transported to mitochondria with high efficiency (10Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Biswas G. Mullick J. Sepuri N.B.V. Otvos L. Pain D. Avadhani N.G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5494-5504Google Scholar). Ser-128-phosphorylated CYP2B1 nascent chains showed vastly reduced efficiency for binding to SRP, but increased mitochondrial transport. These latter results suggested that protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent phosphorylation at Ser-128 activates the cryptic mitochondrial targeting signal. Dual localization of yeast fumarase with identical N terminus in the cytosol and mitochondria has been reported to involve a novel mitochondrial processing of the primary translation product for subsequent export to the cytosol (11Sass E. Blachinsky E. Karniely S. Pines O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46111-46117Google Scholar).Recently we studied the nature of hepatic mitochondrial CYP2E1 (alternatively referred to as P450MT5), which exhibits immunological and molecular properties similar to microsomal CYP2E1 (12Robin M.-A. Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Fang J.K. Cudic M. Otvos L. Avadhani N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24680-24689Google Scholar). The ethanol- and pyrazole-inducible CYP2E1 is thought to play important roles in the metabolism of ethanol, acetone, and induction of oxidative stress (13Tanaka E. Terada M. Misawa S. J. Clin. Pharmacol. Ther. 2000; 25: 165-175Google Scholar, 14Wu D. Cederbaum A.I. Alcohol Clin. Exp. Res. 1999; 23: 67-76Google Scholar). Our results with combinatorial approaches showed that mitochondrial P450MT5 has identical primary structure to that of microsomal CYP2E1, although the former exhibited a much higher level of Ser-129 phosphorylation, and significantly different helical and β-sheet contents (12Robin M.-A. Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Fang J.K. Cudic M. Otvos L. Avadhani N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24680-24689Google Scholar). In the present study we demonstrate that CYP2E1 contains a cryptic mitochondrial targeting signal at amino acid residues 21–31, in addition to the previously demonstrated ER targeting signal within the first 30 residues of the protein (15Monier S. Van Luc P. Kreibich G. Sabatini D.D. Adesnik M. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 457-470Google Scholar, 16Szczesna-Skorupa E. Kemper B. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 206: 64-75Google Scholar). A comparison of chimeric signals of CYP1A1, CYP2B1, and CYP2E1 shows subtle differences in terms of affinity for binding to SRP and mitochondrial translocases, but all of them show a distinct resistance to translational arrest in response to saturating levels of SRP, and propensity for translation in a membrane-free form. Our results also show for the first time that Ser-129 phosphorylation increases the affinity of the protein for binding to cytoplasmic Hsp70 (CyHsp70) family chaperones as a possible basis for increased mitochondrial targeting of P450MT5 but does not affect the binding of nascent chains to SRP or the major ER translocator protein Sec61.DISCUSSIONA recent study from our laboratory showed that hepatic mitochondrial P450MT5 from pyrazole-treated rats exhibits primary sequence identical to that of similarly induced microsomal CYP2E1, except that it has a higher level of Ser-129 phosphorylation (12Robin M.-A. Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Fang J.K. Cudic M. Otvos L. Avadhani N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24680-24689Google Scholar). In support of these results, here we show that Ser-129 phosphorylated CYP2E1 protein is efficiently targeted to mitochondrial compartment both in vitro and in vivo. It was recently shown that the N-terminal 29 amino acid residues, the putative transmembrane anchor domain of CYP2E1, contain the signal for ER targeting although it is inefficient for retaining the protein in the ER (26Hill K. Model K. Ryan M.T. Dietmeier K. Martin F. Wagner R. Pfanner N. Nature. 1998; 395: 516-521Google Scholar). This study demonstrates that the sequence region between residues 21 and 31 also contains a cryptic signal for mitochondrial targeting, which is activated by phosphorylation at Ser-129. In this study, we show that Ser-129-phosphorylated CYP2E1 with intact N terminus is efficiently targeted to mitochondrial compartment bothin vitro and in vivo. We demonstrate that the sequence region between 21 and 31 also contains a cryptic mitochondrial targeting signal, which is activated by phosphorylation at Ser-129. Previously we showed that cAMP-mediated phosphorylation markedly increases the efficiency of CYP2B1 targeting to the mitochondrial compartment (10Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Biswas G. Mullick J. Sepuri N.B.V. Otvos L. Pain D. Avadhani N.G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5494-5504Google Scholar). In extension of these results, we now show that phosphorylation at Ser-129 markedly increases the extent of CYP2E1 protein binding to cytoplasmic chaperone Hsp70 under both in vitro and in vivo conditions, which in turn increases the affinity of the nascent protein for mitochondrial translocase TOM40. It is likely that CyHsp70 binding induces a conformational change in CYP2E1 protein, thus facilitating its interaction with TOM40 and other mitochondrial translocases. The phosphorylation-mediated signal activation, therefore, appears to be related to pre-translocation steps of chaperone binding and presentation to translocase complexes.CYP2E1 is believed to play important roles in modulating oxidative stress-related cellular pathologies and toxicity. Its expression at both mRNA and protein levels is induced under various pathophysiological conditions, including diabetes, obesity, starvation (13Tanaka E. Terada M. Misawa S. J. Clin. Pharmacol. Ther. 2000; 25: 165-175Google Scholar), and alcohol ingestion (33Dupont I. Bodenez P. Berthou F. Simon B. Bardou L.G. Lucas D. Alcohol Alcoholism. 2000; 35: 98-103Google Scholar). CYP2E1 metabolizes endogenous compounds of physiological importance, such as lipid hydroperoxides and ketone bodies (34Coons M.J. Vaz A.D. Bestervelt L.L. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 428-434Google Scholar, 35Koop D.R. Coon M.J. Alcohol Clin. Exp. Res. 1986; 10: S44-S49Google Scholar), in addition to various exogenous chemicals (36Guengerich F.P. Shimada T. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1991; 4: 391-407Google Scholar,37Gonzalez F.J. Gelboin F.J. Drug Metab. Rev. 1994; 26: 165-183Google Scholar). Recent studies show that CYP2E1 has a direct role in the production of reactive O2 species, induction of oxidative stress, and apoptosis (38Fataccioli V. Andraud E. Gentil M. French S.M. Rouach H. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 14-20Google Scholar, 14Wu D. Cederbaum A.I. Alcohol Clin. Exp. Res. 1999; 23: 67-76Google Scholar). Because of the expanding role of mitochondrial genetic and membrane systems in diverse metabolic processes, integration and execution of apoptotic signal (39Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Google Scholar), and generation of stress signaling that affects nuclear gene expression (40Biswas G. Adebanjo O.A. Freedman B.D. Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Vijayasarathy C. Zaidi M. Kotlikoff M. Avadhani N.G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 522-533Google Scholar, 41Amuthan G. Biswas G. Zhang S.Y. Klein-Szanto A. Vijayasarathy C. Avadhani N.G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1910-1920Google Scholar), it is important to understand the mechanism of CYP2E1 targeting and its regulation.The present study demonstrates that the two positively charged residues at positions 24 and 25 are critical for mitochondrial targeting. The chimeric N-terminal signal (residues 1–31) of CYP2E1 appears to resemble the bimodal targeting signal of CYP2B1 with subtle differences. A recent study using transient transfection of CYP2E1 lacking the N-terminal 1–29 residues of the protein concluded that the mitochondrially targeted component is a 40-kDa soluble protein, which is generated by the MPP-mediated cleavage at an undetermined N-terminal site (42Neve E.P. Ingelman-Sundberg M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 309-314Google Scholar, 43Neve E.P. Ingelman-Sundberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11317-11322Google Scholar). Using a full-length protein, however, we were unable to demonstrate any detectable processing either under conditions when MPP activity was induced by Mg2+ and Mn2+ or by incubation with purified yeast MPP protein (results not presented). Furthermore, in our hands any deletion beyond the positively charged residue at position 25 abolished mitochondrial targeting under bothin vivo and in vitro conditions. The physiological significance of the earlier study (43Neve E.P. Ingelman-Sundberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11317-11322Google Scholar) using a truncated protein that lacked the critical components of the mitochondrial targeting signal remains unclear.Protein phosphorylation plays a critical role in many cellular processes, including signal amplification, modulation of structure/function of proteins, and protein ubiquitination (44Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 80: 225-236Google Scholar). In extension of our recent observation with CYP2B1, the present study demonstrates yet another function for protein phosphorylation in the activation of an otherwise inactive mitochondrial targeting signal. Specifically, our results show that phosphorylation at an internal site results in increased affinity of nascent CYP2E1 for binding to CyHsp70in vitro as well as in vivo, and for a major mitochondrial outer membrane translocase, TOM40. In this respect, our present and previous studies (10Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Biswas G. Mullick J. Sepuri N.B.V. Otvos L. Pain D. Avadhani N.G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5494-5504Google Scholar) together provide an important insight into a novel cAMP-dependent regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis. A notable difference from the previously published results with CYP2B1 is that phosphorylation at Ser-129 did not alter the efficiency of nascent CYP2E1 protein binding to SRP. In contrast, the phosphorylated nascent CYP2B1 showed a markedly lower affinity for binding to SRP. We believe that phosphorylation of CYP2E1 translated on free ribosomes for mitochondrial targeting is a distinct event from the phosphorylation of microsome-associated CYP2E1, which has been implicated in the regulation of catalytic function of the microsomal CYP (45Oesch-Bartlomowicz B. Padma P.R. Becker R. Richter B. Hengstler J.G. Freeman J.E. Wolf C.R. Oesch F. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 242: 294-302Google Scholar) and its ubiquitination (46Banerjee A. Kocarek T.A. Novak R.F. Drug Metab. Disp. 2000; 28: 118-124Google Scholar).Another major difference between the bimodal targeting of CYP2E1, CYP2B1, and CYP1A1 is their mode of translation. Our results show thatin vitro translation of CYP2B1 is nearly completely inhibited by saturating levels of SRP, whereas the translation of CYP2E1 was inhibited by only ∼40%. Inhibition of CYP1A1 followed a pattern intermediary to these two proteins (9Addya S. Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Biswas G. Bhagwhat S.V. Mullick J. Avadhani N.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 589-599Google Scholar). 3M.-A. Robin, H. K. Anandatheerthavarada, G. Biswas, N. B. V. Sepuri, D. M. Gordon, D. Pain, and N. G. Avadhani, unpublished results. Extent of membrane insertion as tested by alkaline Na2CO3extraction and binding to SRP by chemical cross-linking essentially follow this pattern. CYP2E1 showed a generally low affinity for binding to SRP, as indicated by cross-linking, and a large fraction (>50%) of CYP2E1 was not inserted into added ER membrane, further suggesting that part of the nascent chains is translated in membrane-free form. On the other hand, under low cAMP conditions, CYP2B1 was translated as abona fide ER-targeted protein (10Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Biswas G. Mullick J. Sepuri N.B.V. Otvos L. Pain D. Avadhani N.G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5494-5504Google Scholar), with a markedly higher efficiency for binding to SRP and >90% of nascent chains associating with ER. CYP1A1 behaved in an intermediary manner in that ∼25–30% of the nascent chains escaped ER targeting irrespective of the phosphorylation status (9Addya S. Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Biswas G. Bhagwhat S.V. Mullick J. Avadhani N.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 589-599Google Scholar). The contrasting efficiencies of phosphorylated CYP2E1 and CYP2B1 for binding to SRP is further supported by cross-linking studies under in vivoconditions (Fig. 8), which show no change in interaction of CYP2E1 with Sec61 under induced cAMP conditions, when interaction of CYP2B1 with Sec61 is markedly decreased. A comparison of the structural properties of sequence 1–36, representing the chimeric signals of those three CYP proteins is presented in TableI. The PROT-SCALE-based analysis shows that the chimeric signal of CYP2E1 is least hydrophobic and has least α-helical content, and is conformationally most unstable as compared with that of CYP2B1, which is at the other end of the spectrum with respect to these properties. CYP1A1 exhibits intermediary properties.Table IComparison of the N-terminal regions of CYPs that contain chimeric signals for bimodal targetingSignal parametersCYP1A1CYP2B1CYP2E1α-Helicity++++++Hydrophobicity++++++++++StabilityStableVery stableUnstableThe N-terminal amino acid 1–36 sequence regions were analyzed using ExPaSy (Expert Protein Analysis System) molecular biology server of the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics. The number of + indicates the degree of α-helicity or hydrophobicity. Open table in a new tab A common property among the three CYPs (2E1, 2B1, and 1A1) with chimeric signals is their inability to undergo elongation arrest duringin vitro translation in the presence of added SRP (10Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Biswas G. Mullick J. Sepuri N.B.V. Otvos L. Pain D. Avadhani N.G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5494-5504Google Scholar, 47Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. Sato R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3361-3364Google Scholar). Elongation arrest is thought to increase the translocation efficiency of nascent chains possibly by extending the time of its interaction with the translocation machinery (2Keenan R.J. Freymann D.M. Stroud R.M. Walter P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 755-775Google Scholar, 29Pyerin W. Tanaguchi H. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3003-3010Google Scholar). In the case of CYP2B1, a high affinity of the ER targeting signal for SRP under non-phosphorylated state probably enables its efficient targeting to the ER. In the case of CYP1A1 and CYP2E1, the relatively low efficiency of the N-terminal signal for SRP binding, coupled with inability to undergo elongation arrest may be the reason why ∼25–50% of the nascent chains escape ER targeting and undergo translation in a membrane-free state. Phosphorylated CYP2B1, on the other hand, behaves similarly to the chimeric signal of CYP2E1, in that it shows lower affinity for SRP binding, thus showing higher propensity for translation in a membrane-free form. Consistent with this, results of in vitro and in vivo studies together show that phosphorylated CYP2E1 binds to CyHsp70 with increased efficiency, which in turn increases the efficiency with which the nascent protein binds to TOM40. Based on these observations, we propose a model for mitochondrial CYP2E1 targeting (Fig. 9), which implies that lower affinity for SRP binding under both high cAMP or low cAMP conditions causes >50% of the nascent chains to escape ER targeting and undergo translation as membrane free protein. cAMP-dependent phosphorylation at Ser-129 of the protein results in the activation of cryptic mitochondrial signal, which includes more efficient association with cytoplasmic chaperones and more efficient binding to mitochondrial translocases. We postulate that these latter two events enable preferential targeting of complete, unprocessed, but phosphorylated apoprotein to mitochondria (Fig. 8). In variance from the mechanism described for CYP2B1, cAMP regulates only the mitochondrial targeting but not the ER targeting of CYP2E1.Figure 9A model for the biogenesis of microsomal CYP2E1 and mitochondrial MT5.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In summary, we provide confirmatory evidence for a novel class of chimeric signals with dual targeting property. Results also provide valuable new insight as to how cellular cAMP levels regulate the biogenesis of mitochondrial enzymes associated with drug and alcohol toxicity by modulating the rate of mitochondrial targeting of CYP2E1 and also other CYPs. Accurate targeting of proteins to their designated subcellular compartments is critical for maintaining the distinctive structural and functional characteristics of individual cellular components. At least three major types of import/transport systems have been described for targeting proteins translated in the cytoplasm to different organelles in the eukaryotic cells. 1) Proteins destined for the ER, 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; CYP, cytochrome P450; db-cAMP, dibutyryl cAMP; DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; DTT, dithiothreitol; Hsp, heat shock protein; CyHsp70, cytoplasmic Hsp70; MtHsp70, mitochondrial Hsp70; MBS, m-maleimidobenzoyl- N-hydroxysuccinimidate ester; S-MBS, m-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysulfosuccinimidate ester; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; MPP, matrix processing peptidase; PPL, preprolactin; PKA, protein kinase A; PKI, protein kinase A inhibitor myristoylated peptide; RRL, rabbit reticulocyte lysate; SRP, signal recognition particle; TIM, translocase of the inner membrane; TOM, translocase of the outer membrane; WGL, wheat germ lysate; WT, wild-type. 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; CYP, cytochrome P450; db-cAMP, dibutyryl cAMP; DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; DTT, dithiothreitol; Hsp, heat shock protein; CyHsp70, cytoplasmic Hsp70; MtHsp70, mitochondrial Hsp70; MBS, m-maleimidobenzoyl- N-hydroxysuccinimidate ester; S-MBS, m-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysulfosuccinimidate ester; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; MPP, matrix processing peptidase; PPL, preprolactin; PKA, protein kinase A; PKI, protein kinase A inhibitor myristoylated peptide; RRL, rabbit reticulocyte lysate; SRP, signal recognition particle; TIM, translocase of the inner membrane; TOM, translocase of the outer membrane; WGL, wheat germ lysate; WT, wild-type. Golgi, plasma membrane, and also those secreted out of cells, are targeted to the ER through a signal recognition particle (SRP)-dependent mechanism. This pathway is mostly co-translational and involves the delivery of nascent chains by SRP to the translocon complex on the ER membrane (1Schatz G. Dobberstein B. Science. 1996; 271: 1519-1526Google Scholar, 2Keenan R.J. Freymann D.M. Stroud R.M. Walter P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 755-775Google Scholar). 2) Protein targeting to mitochondria occurs mostly by a post-translational mechanism, although exceptions to this generality have been reported (3Lithgow T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 22-26Google Scholar, 4Fujiki M. Verner K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1914-1920Google Scholar). As part of the mitochondrial targeting pathway, an unfolded polypeptide is brought in contact with the outer and inner membrane translocase complexes (TOM and TIM, respectively) (5Neupert W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 863-917Google Scholar). The protein is unidirectionally translocated through transmembrane protein channels formed of TOM40 and TIM23/TIM17 subunits, and its entry into the matrix space is finally facilitated by an ATP-dependent pull exerted by the mitochondrial Hsp70 chaperone protein (6Schneider H.C. Berthold J. Bauer M.F. Dietmeier K. Guiard B. Brunner M. Neupert W. Nature. 1994; 371: 768-777Google Scholar). 3) The peroxisomal protein targeting, although it occurs post-translationally, involves a distinct set of cytosolic receptors. These proteins not only guide the precursor proteins to the peroxisomal membrane receptor Pex, they also lead the polypeptide into the matrix compartment and eventually recycle back to the cytosol for reutilization (7Smith M.D. Schnell D.J. Cell. 2001; 105: 293-296Google Scholar, 8Subramani S. Koller A. Snyder W.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 399-418Google Scholar). As predicted by the signal hypothesis, the targeting specificity of proteins is dictated by the signal sequences that function as specific “address codes” (2Keenan R.J. Freymann D.M. Stroud R.M. Walter P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 755-775Google Scholar). The signal sequences required for protein targeting to the ER, mitochondria and peroxisomes are quite different, and it is generally believed that a protein may carry only one type of signal, thus ensuring its targeting to the correct membrane compartment. In contrast to this general view, recent studies from our laboratory showed that xenobiotic inducible CYP1A1 and CYP2B1 contain “atypical” signals at the N termini, which we named “chimeric signals,” that were capable of targeting the apoprotein chains to both the ER and mitochondria under in vitro and in vivo conditions (9Addya S. Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Biswas G. Bhagwhat S.V. Mullick J. Avadhani N.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 589-599Google Scholar, 10Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Biswas G. Mullick J. Sepuri N.B.V. Otvos L. Pain D. Avadhani N.G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5494-5504Google Scholar). In the case of CYP1A1, the protein chains that escaped ER targeting (∼25% of the total pool) were cleaved past N-terminal residues 4 and 32, thereby activating a cryptic mitochondrial targeting signal (9Addya S. Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Biswas G. Bhagwhat S.V. Mullick J. Avadhani N.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 589-599Google Scholar). In the case of CYP2B1, an intact but Ser-128-phosphorylated protein was transported to mitochondria with high efficiency (10Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Biswas G. Mullick J. Sepuri N.B.V. Otvos L. Pain D. Avadhani N.G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5494-5504Google Scholar). Ser-128-phosphorylated CYP2B1 nascent chains showed vastly reduced efficiency for binding to SRP, but increased mitochondrial transport. These latter results suggested that protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent phosphorylation at Ser-128 activates the cryptic"
https://openalex.org/W1974946679,"Human prostate tumors have elevated levels of 15-lipoxygenase-1 (15-LOX-1) and data suggest that 15-LOX-1 may play a role in the development of prostate cancer. In contrast, 15-LOX-2 expression is higher in normal rather than in tumor prostate tissue and appears to suppress cancer development. We recently reported that 13-(S)-HODE, the 15-LOX-1 metabolite, up-regulates the MAP kinase signaling pathway and subsequently down-regulates PPARγ in human colorectal carcinoma cells. To determine whether this mechanism is applicable to prostate cancer and what the effects of 15-LOX-2 are, we investigated the effect of 15-LOX-1, 15-LOX-2, and their metabolites on epidermal growth factor (EGF)- and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 signaling in prostate carcinoma cells. In PC3 cells, 13-(S)-HODE, a 15-LOX-1 metabolite, up-regulated MAP kinase while in contrast 15-(S)-HETE, a 15-LOX-2 metabolite, down-regulated MAP kinase. As a result, 13-(S)-HODE increased PPARγ phosphorylation while a subsequent decrease in PPARγ phosphorylation was observed with 15-(S)-HETE. Thus, 15-LOX metabolites have opposing effects on the regulation of the MAP kinase signaling pathway and a downstream target of MAP kinase signaling like PPARγ. In addition to the EGF signaling pathway, the IGF signaling pathway appears to be linked to prostate cancer. 13-(S)-HODE and 15-(S)-HETE up-regulate or down-regulate, respectively, both the MAPK and Akt pathways after activation with IGF-1. Thus, the effect of these lipid metabolites is not solely restricted to EGF signaling and not solely restricted to MAPK signaling. These results provide a plausible mechanism to explain the apparent opposing effects 15-LOX-1 and 15-LOX-2 play in prostate cancer.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1128: 117-131Google Scholar). For example, 15-LOXs oxygenate the substrate arachidonic acid at C-15. Two different human 15-LOXs have been identified that differ in tissue distribution and substrate preference. 15-LOX-1 is expressed in reticulocytes, eosinophils, macrophages, tracheobronchial epithelial cells, and skin (2Funk C.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1304: 65-84Google Scholar). 15-LOX-2 has limited tissue distribution, with mRNA detected in prostate, lung, skin, and cornea (3Shappell S.B. Boeglin W.E. Olson S.J. Kasper S. Brash A.R. Am. J. Path. 1999; 155: 235-245Google Scholar). In terms of enzymatic characteristics, 15-LOX-1 preferentially metabolizes linoleic acid primarily to 13-(S)-HODE, but also metabolizes arachidonic acid to 15-(S)-HETE. 15-LOX-2, on the other hand, converts arachidonic acid to 15-(S)-HETE and metabolizes linoleic acid poorly (4Brash A.R. Boeglin W.E. Chang M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6148-6152Google Scholar).Human prostate tumors have higher expression of 15-LOX-1 compared with normal adjacent tissue and this expression correlates with the Gleason score of the cancer (5Kelavkar U.P. Cohen C. Kamitani H. Eling T.E. Badr K.F. Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 1777-1787Google Scholar). 13-(S)-HODE, the 15-LOX-1 metabolite, is detected in adenocarcinoma tissue (5Kelavkar U.P. Cohen C. Kamitani H. Eling T.E. Badr K.F. Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 1777-1787Google Scholar). Furthermore, nude mice injected with 15-LOX-1-overexpressing prostate cells have increased frequency and size of tumors compared with nude mice injected with control cells (6Kelavkar U.P. Nixon J.B. Cohen C. Dillehay D. Eling T.E. Badr K. Carcinogenesis. 2001; 22: 1765-1773Google Scholar). These data taken together suggest a possible pro-tumorigenic role for 15-LOX-1 in prostate tumor development. In contrast, 15-LOX-2 is expressed in normal prostate tissue, but poorly expressed in prostate tumors (3Shappell S.B. Boeglin W.E. Olson S.J. Kasper S. Brash A.R. Am. J. Path. 1999; 155: 235-245Google Scholar). The 15-LOX-2 expression is inversely correlated with the Gleason score of the tumor (3Shappell S.B. Boeglin W.E. Olson S.J. Kasper S. Brash A.R. Am. J. Path. 1999; 155: 235-245Google Scholar). Furthermore, 15-(S)-HETE is detected in benign prostate tissue samples, and 15-LOX-2 is a negative cell cycle regulator in normal prostate epithelial cells (3Shappell S.B. Boeglin W.E. Olson S.J. Kasper S. Brash A.R. Am. J. Path. 1999; 155: 235-245Google Scholar, 7Tang S. Bhatia B. Maldonado C.J. Yang P. Newman R.A. Liu J. Chandra D. Traag J. Klein R.D. Fischer S.M. Chopra D. Shen J. Zhau H. Chung L.W.K. Tang D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16189-16201Google Scholar). These results suggest there may be different, if not opposing, biological functions for 15-LOX-1 and 15-LOX-2 in the prostate.Human prostate carcinomas express peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily (8Shappell S.B. Gupta R.A. Manning S. Whitehead R. Boeglin W.E. Schneider C. Case T. Price J. Jack G.S. Wheeler T.M. Matusik R.J. Brash A.R. DuBois R.N. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 497-503Google Scholar). Ligand activation of this receptor causes many cancer cell lines to undergo a differentiative response and reverse their malignant phenotype (9Sarraf P. Mueller E. Jones D. King F.J. DeAngelo D.J.

Breyer R.M. Davis L. Breyer M.D. Neoplasia. 1999; 1: 330-339Google Scholar). How the activation of PPARγ leads to growth inhibition is not known, but the data suggest that PPARγ could act as a tumor suppressor.Metabolites of 15-LOX have recently been reported to serve as ligands for PPARγ. 13-(S)-HODE, 13-(S)-HpODE, and 15-(S)-HETE all show binding activity for PPARγ but at relatively high concentrations (19Nagy L. Tontonoz P. Alvarez J.G. Chen H. Evans R.M. Cell. 1998; 93: 229-240Google Scholar, 20Huang J.T. Welch J.S. Ricote M. Binder C.J. Willson T.M. Kelly C. Witztum J.L. Funk C.D. Conrad D. Glass C.K. Nature. 1999; 400: 378-382Google Scholar). Also, recently, it was shown that exogenous 15-(S)-HETE could activate PPARγ using luciferase reporter assays and inhibit proliferation in prostate cells (8Shappell S.B. Gupta R.A. Manning S. Whitehead R. Boeglin W.E. Schneider C. Case T. Price J. Jack G.S. Wheeler T.M. Matusik R.J. Brash A.R. DuBois R.N. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 497-503Google Scholar). Thus, based on activation of PPARγ, one could conclude that 15-LOX-1 may have antitumorigenic activity. However, this hypothesis is in conflict with the elevated 15-LOX-1 expression in tumorsversus normal tissue and with observed increased frequency and size of tumors in nude mice injected with 15-LOX-1-overexpressing cells compared with mice injected with control cells (6Kelavkar U.P. Nixon J.B. Cohen C. Dillehay D. Eling T.E. Badr K. Carcinogenesis. 2001; 22: 1765-1773Google Scholar, 21Ikawa H. Kamitani H. Calvo B.F. Foley J.F. Eling T.E. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 360-366Google Scholar).Recently, we reported that 15-LOX-1 linoleic acid metabolites up-regulate the MAP kinase signaling pathway (22Hsi L.C. Wilson L. Nixon J. Eling T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34545-34552Google Scholar). MAP kinase can subsequently phosphorylate PPARγ, one potential downstream target of MAP kinase, and thus down-regulate PPARγ activity in human colorectal carcinoma cells (22Hsi L.C. Wilson L. Nixon J. Eling T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34545-34552Google Scholar). The up-regulation of the MAP kinase pathway provides a rationale to explain how 15-LOX-1 may play a protumorigenic role and may provide a clue to the difference between the biological function of 15-LOX-1 and 15-LOX-2. The aim of the present study is: 1) to compare the effects of 13-(S)-HODE, a 15-LOX-1 metabolite, to the effects of 15-(S)-HETE, a 15-LOX-2 metabolite, on MAP kinase signaling in prostate, 2) to determine whether changes in MAP kinase alter PPARγ in prostate, and 3) to determine whether any phenomenon observed is unique to EGF signaling.DISCUSSIONPreviously, we have shown that the 15-LOX-1 metabolite, 13-HODE, increases EGF-dependent MAPK activity, which in turn can cause a decrease in PPARγ activity in colorectal cancer cells (22Hsi L.C. Wilson L. Nixon J. Eling T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34545-34552Google Scholar). In the current study, we have furthered our studies to include 15-LOX-2 and prostate cells since 15-LOX-1 and 15-LOX-2 differ in their expression in tumor and normal prostate tissue. The difference between 15-HETE, the major metabolite of 15-LOX-2, and 13-HODE, the major metabolite of 15-LOX-1, effects on MAPK activity was investigated. Both exogenous and endogenous 13-HODE increases MAPK activity and thus decreases PPARγ activity. In contrast, both exogenous and endogenous 15-HETE decreases MAPK activity, which in turn results in an increase in PPARγ activity. In addition, the effects of the 15-LOX metabolites on MAPK are not unique to EGF signaling, as the IGF signaling pathway and Akt phosphorylation are also affected in prostate cells. These findings are of particular interest given the fact that 15-LOX-1 expression is higher in tumors whereas 15-LOX-2 expression is higher in normal prostate tissue. Also, given the importance of the IGF/Akt pathway in prostate tissue, showing the metabolites alter this signaling pathway is particularly relevant to tumor development. Thus, the findings presented here advance our understanding of the two human 15-LOX enzymes, 15-LOX-1 and 15-LOX-2, which differ in their expression and their apparent biological activity in human prostate.In prostate, higher expression of 15-LOX-1 in tumors is linked to Gleason score of the tumor whereas 15-LOX-2 is expressed in normal prostate tissue and inversely correlates with Gleason score (3Shappell S.B. Boeglin W.E. Olson S.J. Kasper S. Brash A.R. Am. J. Path. 1999; 155: 235-245Google Scholar, 5Kelavkar U.P. Cohen C. Kamitani H. Eling T.E. Badr K.F. Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 1777-1787Google Scholar). Based upon several experimental findings, 15-LOX-1 appears to have a pro-tumorigenic activity while 15-LOX-2 appears to have anti-tumorigenic activity (6Kelavkar U.P. Nixon J.B. Cohen C. Dillehay D. Eling T.E. Badr K. Carcinogenesis. 2001; 22: 1765-1773Google Scholar, 7Tang S. Bhatia B. Maldonado C.J. Yang P. Newman R.A. Liu J. Chandra D. Traag J. Klein R.D. Fischer S.M. Chopra D. Shen J. Zhau H. Chung L.W.K. Tang D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16189-16201Google Scholar). These results thus suggest opposing biological functions for 15-LOX-1 and 15-LOX-2 in the prostate. The results presented here provide a rationale for understanding the different biological activity between 15-LOX-1 and 15-LOX-2 in human prostate and is based, in part, on differences in substrate preference for the two enzymes. 15-LOX-1 preferentially metabolizes linoleic acid to 13-(S)-HODE while 15-LOX-2 metabolizes arachidonic acid to 15-(S)-HETE but poorly metabolizes linoleic acid (4Brash A.R. Boeglin W.E. Chang M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6148-6152Google Scholar). Thus, as normal tissue undergoes transformation to a tumor with the loss of 15-LOX-2 and gain of 15-LOX-1, the metabolites also shift from 15-(S)-HETE to 13-(S)-HODE.Exogenous 13-(S)-HODE up-regulates the EGF- and IGF-1-dependent MAP kinase pathway in prostate cells. In contrast, exogenous 15-(S)-HETE down-regulates the EGF- and IGF-1-dependent MAP kinase pathway. To confirm that endogenous 15-LOX metabolites produce the same responses, we utilized stable 15-LOX-1 overexpressing PC3 cells. By treating these cells with linoleic acid or arachidonic acid, we found that endogenous 15-LOX metabolites had the same effect as addition of exogenous 13-(S)-HODE or 15-(S)-HETE. Thus, in PC3 cells, endogenous 15-LOX metabolites have opposing effects on the regulation of MAP kinase, a key pathway linked to cell proliferation and tumor development. Although it is possible that other 15-LOX products may be playing a role in the proposed action, we do know that the main metabolites generated are 13-(S)-HODE with linoleic acid as a substrate and 15-(S)-HETE with arachidonic acid as a substrate.13-HODE and 15-HETE bind and activate PPARγ in vitrosuggesting that the metabolites may function as endogenous ligands for PPARγ (19Nagy L. Tontonoz P. Alvarez J.G. Chen H. Evans R.M. Cell. 1998; 93: 229-240Google Scholar). However, these findings are observed with high concentrations of the metabolites (30–100 μm) and most of these studies employ only exogenous metabolites (19Nagy L. Tontonoz P. Alvarez J.G. Chen H. Evans R.M. Cell. 1998; 93: 229-240Google Scholar, 20Huang J.T. Welch J.S. Ricote M. Binder C.J. Willson T.M. Kelly C. Witztum J.L. Funk C.D. Conrad D. Glass C.K. Nature. 1999; 400: 378-382Google Scholar). The physiological relevance of these lipid substances as regulators of PPARγ in vivo is not fully established. One potential downstream target of MAPK signaling is PPARγ. Phosphorylation of PPARγ results in a decrease in transcriptional activity (28Camp H.S. Tafuri S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10811-10816Google Scholar, 29Hu E. Kim J.B. Sarraf P. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1996; 274: 2100-2103Google Scholar, 30Reginato M.J. Krakow S.L. Bailey S.T. Lazar M.A. J. Biol.

MAP kinase, a central regulator of cell growth, phosphorylates a key residue, Ser-82 on PPARγ1, which results in a decrease in PPARγ transcriptional activity (28Camp H.S. Tafuri S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10811-10816Google Scholar, 29Hu E. Kim J.B. Sarraf P. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1996; 274: 2100-2103Google Scholar, 32Adams M. Reginato M.J. Shao D. Lazar M.A. Chatterjee V.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5128-5132Google Scholar). In PC3 cells, endogenous 15-LOX metabolites have opposing effects on the regulation of MAP kinase activity and have opposing effects on PPARγ activity. Based on data from this and previous studies (8Shappell S.B. Gupta R.A. Manning S. Whitehead R. Boeglin W.E. Schneider C. Case T. Price J. Jack G.S. Wheeler T.M. Matusik R.J. Brash A.R. DuBois R.N. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 497-503Google Scholar, 22Hsi L.C. Wilson L. Nixon J. Eling T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34545-34552Google Scholar), it appears that down-regulation of PPARγ activity is specific for linoleic acid metabolites as 13-(S)-HODE, 13-(R)-HODE, and 13-(S)-HpODE all increase MAPK activity and hence PPARγ phosphorylation whereas 15-(S)-HETE, an arachidonic acid metabolite, has the opposite effect. These effects on MAP kinase are observed with endogenously generated metabolites and the addition of the 15-LOX metabolites alters MAP kinase at lower concentrations than required to observe PPARγ ligand binding in vitro. Thus, these findings indicate that endogenous 15-LOX metabolites alter PPARγ transcriptional activity via MAPK phosphorylation rather than acting as a ligand for this receptor. PPARγ agonists inhibit proliferation and potentially induce differentiation in many carcinoma cell lines (8Shappell S.B. Gupta R.A. Manning S. Whitehead R. Boeglin W.E. Schneider C. Case T. Price J.

Breyer M.D. Neoplasia. 1999; 1: 330-339Google Scholar), suggesting that PPARγ could act as a tumor suppressor. The 15-LOX metabolites appear to modulate this activity via MAPK phosphorylation.In addition to the EGF signaling, IGF-1 signaling appears to play an important role in prostate cancer. Epidemiologic studies suggest an association between increased serum levels of IGF-1 and an increased risk of prostate cancer (33Wolk A. Mantzoros C.S. Andersson S-O. Bergstrom R. Signorello L.B. Lagiou P. Adami H.O. Trichopoulos D. J. Natl. Can. Inst. 1998; 90: 911-915Google Scholar). Furthermore, transgenic mice expressing human IGF-1 in basal epithelial cells of prostate led to activation of the IGF-1R and spontaneous tumorigenesis in prostate epithelium (34DiGiovanni J. Kiguchi K. Frijhoff A. Wilker E. Bol D.K. Beltrán L. Moats S. Ramirez A. Jorcano J. Conti C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3455-3460Google Scholar,35DiGiovanni J. Bol D.K. Wilker E. Beltran L. Carbajal S. Moats S. Ramirez A. Jorcano J. Kiguchi K. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1561-1570Google Scholar). In response to IGF-1, the Raf-MEK-ERK and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways are often simultaneously activated and play important roles in IGF-1R-induced cellular proliferation and the inhibition of apoptosis. Traditionally, the Ras/Raf/MAP kinase pathway was thought to primarily mediate the cell proliferative response to IGF-1, whereas the PI3 kinase pathway, which activates Akt/PKB, was primarily implicated in mediating the anti-apoptotic effects of IGF-1 (36Kulik G. Klippel A. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1595-1606Google Scholar, 37Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S., Fu, H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Google Scholar, 38Dudek H. Datta S.R. Franke T.F. Birnbaum M.J. Yao R. Cooper G.M. Segal R.A. Kaplan D.R. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1997; 275: 661-665Google Scholar). However, recent studies have demonstrated a role for both pathways in mediating both responses. Coordination of the two pathways in a single cellular response may depend on cell type or the stage of differentiation (39Alblas J. Slager-Davidov R. Steenbergh P.H. Sussenbach J.S. van der Burg B. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 131-139Google Scholar, 40Dufourny B. Alblas J. van Teeffelen H.A. van Schaik F.M. van der Burg B. Steenbergh P.H. Sussenbach J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31163-31171Google Scholar, 41Jiang B.H. Aoki M. Zheng J.Z., Li, J. Vogt P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2077-2081Google Scholar).In prostate PC3 cells, 13-(S)-HODE and 15-(S)-HETE up-regulate or down-regulate, respectively, both the MAPK and Akt pathways after activation with IGF-1. However, the magnitude of the response on MAPK is greater than on Akt. Thus, the effect of these lipid metabolites is not solely restricted to EGF signaling and not solely restricted to MAPK signaling. Exactly where in the signaling pathway the 15-LOX metabolites are regulating MAP kinase in the prostate carcinoma cells is not known and remains to be elucidated. Nonetheless, it appears that regulation of MAP kinase by 15-LOX metabolites may have important implications relevant to tumorigenesis, particularly in the prostate.Opposing biological actions by eicosanoids is frequently observed. For example, the conversion of arachidonic acid to thromboxane A2 promotes platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction, whereas the formation of prostacyclin inhibits platelet aggregation and promotes vasodilation (42Ullrich V. Zou M.H. Bachschmid M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1532: 1-14Google Scholar). The two lipoxygenases, 15-LOX-1 and 15-LOX-2, are other examples where the balance between two enzymes that metabolize cis-unsaturated fatty acids appear to antithetically modulate the activity of a key pathway regulating biological events. In this particular case, a balance between two opposing effects could determine the role 15-LOX plays in the development of prostate cancer. Perhaps there is a shift in expression of 15-LOX-2 to 15-LOX-1, and presumably a shift from 15-(S)-HETE to 13-(S)-HODE, as a cell undergoes neoplastic progression from a normal cell to a tumor cell (Fig.10). These metabolites exert a dramatically opposite effect on EGF and IGF-1 signaling pathways leading to an increase or decrease in MAP kinase activity. MAP kinase may be a key player in determining whether a pro-tumorigenic activity or an anti-tumorigenic response is observed. Loss of 15-LOX-2 expression and gain of 15-LOX-1 may contribute to prostate cancer development and progression. Thus, a shift from 15-LOX-2 expression to 15-LOX-1 expression may serve as a useful marker of prostate cancer development. Further investigation of 15-LOXs in prostate will need to be done to clarify their function in cancer development.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1128: 117-131Google Scholar). For example, 15-LOXs oxygenate the substrate arachidonic acid at C-15. Two different human 15-LOXs have been identified that differ in tissue distribution and substrate preference. 15-LOX-1 is expressed in reticulocytes, eosinophils, macrophages, tracheobronchial epithelial cells, and skin (2Funk C.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1304: 65-84Google Scholar). 15-LOX-2 has limited tissue distribution, with mRNA detected in prostate, lung, skin, and cornea (3Shappell S.B. Boeglin W.E. Olson S.J. Kasper S. Brash A.R. Am. J. Path. 1999; 155: 235-245Google Scholar). In terms of enzymatic characteristics, 15-LOX-1 preferentially metabolizes linoleic acid primarily to 13-(S)-HODE, but also metabolizes arachidonic acid to 15-(S)-HETE. 15-LOX-2, on the other hand, converts arachidonic acid to 15-(S)-HETE and metabolizes linoleic acid poorly (4Brash A.R. Boeglin W.E. Chang M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6148-6152Google Scholar). Human prostate tumors have higher expression of 15-LOX-1 compared with normal adjacent tissue and this expression correlates with the Gleason score of the cancer (5Kelavkar U.P. Cohen C. Kamitani H. Eling T.E. Badr K.F. Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 1777-1787Google Scholar). 13-(S)-HODE, the 15-LOX-1 metabolite, is detected in adenocarcinoma tissue (5Kelavkar U.P. Cohen C. Kamitani H. Eling T.E. Badr K.F. Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 1777-1787Google Scholar). Furthermore, nude mice injected with 15-LOX-1-overexpressing prostate cells have increased frequency and size of tumors compared with nude mice injected with control cells (6Kelavkar U.P. Nixon J.B. Cohen C. Dillehay D. Eling T.E. Badr K. Carcinogenesis. 2001; 22: 1765-1773Google Scholar). These data taken together suggest a possible pro-tumorigenic role for 15-LOX-1 in prostate tumor development. In contrast, 15-LOX-2 is expressed in normal prostate tissue, but poorly expressed in prostate tumors (3Shappell S.B. Boeglin W.E. Olson S.J. Kasper S. Brash A.R. Am. J. Path. 1999; 155: 235-245Google Scholar). The 15-LOX-2 expression is inversely correlated with the Gleason score of the tumor (3Shappell S.B. Boeglin W.E. Olson S.J. Kasper S. Brash A.R. Am. J. Path. 1999; 155: 235-245Google Scholar). Furthermore, 15-(S)-HETE is detected in benign prostate tissue samples, and 15-LOX-2 is a negative cell cycle regulator in normal prostate epithelial cells (3Shappell S.B. Boeglin W.E. Olson S.J. Kasper S. Brash A.R. Am. J. Path. 1999; 155: 235-245Google Scholar, 7Tang S. Bhatia B. Maldonado C.J. Yang P. Newman R.A. Liu J. Chandra D. Traag J. Klein R.D. Fischer S.M. Chopra D. Shen J. Zhau H. Chung L.W.K. Tang D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16189-16201Google Scholar). These results suggest there may be different, if not opposing, biological functions for 15-LOX-1 and 15-LOX-2 in the prostate. Human prostate carcinomas express peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily (8Shappell S.B. Gupta R.A. Manning S. Whitehead R. Boeglin W.E.

https://openalex.org/W2045631017,"DNA replication is controlled by the stepwise assembly of a pre-replicative complex and the replication apparatus. Cdt1 is a novel component of the pre-replicative complex and plays a role in loading the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) 2–7 complex onto chromatin. Cdt1 activity is inhibited by geminin, which is essential for the G2/M transition in metazoan cells. To understand the molecular basis of the Cdt1-geminin regulatory mechanism in mammalian cells, we cloned and expressed the mouse Cdt1 homologue cDNA in bacterial cells and purified mouse Cdt1 to near homogeneity. We found by yeast two-hybrid analysis that mouse Cdt1 associates with geminin, MCM6, and origin recognition complex 2. MCM6 interacts with the Cdt1 carboxyl-terminal region (amino acids 407–477), which is conserved among eukaryotes, whereas geminin associates with the Cdt1 central region (amino acids 177–380), which is conserved only in metazoans. In addition, we found that Cdt1 can bind DNA in a sequence-, strand-, and conformation-independent manner. The Cdt1 DNA binding domain overlaps with the geminin binding domain, and the binding of Cdt1 to DNA is inhibited by geminin. Taken together, we have defined structural domains and novel biochemical properties for mouse Cdt1 that suggest that Cdt1 behaves as an intrinsic DNA binding factor in the pre-replicative complex.

Chromosomal DNA replication is subject to strict cell cycle control, which ensures that cells enter S phase once and only once per cell cycle. A considerable body of evidence from both genetic analyses of yeast mutants and biochemical studies using Xenopus egg extracts has shown that the initiation of replication requires the stepwise assembly of protein complexes on chromatin to form a pre-replicative complex (pre-RC) 1The abbreviations used are: pre-RC, pre-replicative complex; ORC, origin recognition complex; MCM, minichromosome maintenance; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; mCdt1, mouse Cdt1; GST, glutathione S-transferase; FL, full-length. 1The abbreviations used are: pre-RC, pre-replicative complex; ORC, origin recognition complex; MCM, minichromosome maintenance; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; mCdt1, mouse Cdt1; GST, glutathione S-transferase; FL, full-length.

Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 690-696Google Scholar). The pre-RC includes the origin recognition complex (ORC), the minichromosome maintenance protein complex (MCM), and the Cdc6 and Cdt1 proteins. After the activation of S phase-promoting kinases, CDKs, and the Dbf4-dependent kinase, DNA helicase unwinds the two DNA strands, and replication protein A stabilizes single-stranded DNA, thereby allowing an initiation complex to be formed by the loading of DNA polymerases onto the pre-RC. Because most of the components of the pre-RC identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae andXenopus have been found in other eukaryotes including humans, it is believed that the mechanisms controlling the initiation of replication are conserved in all eukaryotes. However, the DNA helicase that is associated with the replication fork has not yet been identified, even in S. cerevisiae (1Bell S.P. Dutta A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 333-374Google Scholar, 6Kelly T.J. Brown G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 829-880Google Scholar, 8Takisawa H. Mimura S. Kubota Y. Curr. Opin.

The MCM2–7 complex was first identified as a set of genes required for minichromosome maintenance in S. cerevisiae, and it was subsequently identified as a critical component of the replication licensing system in Xenopus egg extracts (3Blow J.J. Hodgson B. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 72-78Google Scholar, 9Labib K. Diffley J.F. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 64-70Google Scholar,10Lei M. Tye B.K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1447-1454Google Scholar). MCM2–7 proteins are loaded onto chromatin at late telophase and gradually released as replication forks proceed, and concomitantly, chromatin undergoes a transition to the unlicensed state (3Blow J.J. Hodgson B. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 72-78Google Scholar, 8Takisawa H. Mimura S. Kubota Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 690-696Google Scholar, 11Madine M.A. Khoo C.Y. Mills A.D. Laskey R.A. Nature. 1995; 375: 421-424Google Scholar). The mouse and Schizosaccharomyces pombe MCM4/6/7 complexes possess low but significant DNA helicase activity (12Ishimi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24508-24513Google Scholar, 13You Z. Komamura Y. Ishimi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8003-8015Google Scholar, 14Lee J.K. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18871-18878Google Scholar). The presence of single-stranded tails in forked DNA substrates stimulates the processive helicase activity of the S. pombe MCM4/6/7 complex, suggesting that MCM may function as an intrinsic processive DNA helicase whose activity is controlled by as yet undefined modifications or uncharacterized interactions with other factors (15Lee J.K. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 54-59Google Scholar). Thus, to understand the function of the MCM helicase in replication, it is important to determine not only the mechanism by which MCM is loaded onto chromatin but also the interplay between MCM and other replication components of the pre-RC at the onset of replication. Two factors have been identified as necessary to load MCM proteins onto chromatin: Cdc6 and Cdt1 (1Bell S.P. Dutta A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 333-374Google Scholar, 2Diffley J.F. Labib K. J.

Cdc6 is an essential component of the pre-RC and is conserved among organisms ranging from yeast to humans. Cdc6 is a member of a large superfamily of ATPases known as the AAA+ family, and it exhibits significant sequence similarity to subunits of clamp-loading proteins in eukaryotes (the replication factor C complex) and prokaryotes (the γ-complex), which load the ring-shaped sliding clamp onto DNA (17Perkins G. Diffley J.F. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 23-32Google Scholar). Interestingly, S. pombe, mouse, and archaeal MCM complexes have been observed by electron microscopic analysis to have a donut-like shape (18Adachi Y. Usukura J. Yanagida M. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 467-479Google Scholar, 19Chong J.P. Hayashi M.K. Simon M.N., Xu, R.M. Stillman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1530-1535Google Scholar, 20Sato M. Gotow T. You Z. Komamura-Kohno Y. Uchiyama Y. Yabuta N. Nojima H. Ishimi Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 421-431Google Scholar). The loading of MCM onto chromatin is dependent on ORC and Cdc6 in S. cerevisiae, S. pombe, Xenopus, and humans (1Bell S.P. Dutta A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 333-374Google Scholar, 3Blow J.J. Hodgson B. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 72-78Google Scholar, 9Labib K. Diffley J.F. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 64-70Google Scholar, 10Lei M. Tye B.K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1447-1454Google Scholar). Therefore, Cdc6 has been considered to function as a clamp loader that facilitates the loading of the ring-shaped MCM2–7 complex onto DNA. However, thein vivo subunit composition of the MCM complex remains unclear. In addition, the loading of the MCM2–7 complex onto chromatin has not yet been reconstituted in vitro. Moreover, the stoichiometry of the pre-RC components, including the ORC, the MCM complex, and Cdc6, as well as the local architectural features that are conducive to pre-RC formation and the regulatory mechanisms that govern the conversion of the pre-RC to an initiation complex, remain to be clarified. Recently, a novel component of the pre-RC, termed Cdt1, has been identified (2Diffley J.F. Labib K. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 869-872Google Scholar, 16Maiorano D. Mechali M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E58-E59Google Scholar). Cdt1 was first identified in S. pombe as a gene induced by the CDK-dependent transcription factor cdc10 (21Hofmann J.F. Beach D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 425-434Google Scholar). In both S. pombe and Xenopus, Cdt1 has been shown to be essential for chromosomal replication and the assembly of MCM2–7 on chromatin (22Nishitani H. Lygerou Z. Nishimoto T. Nurse P. Nature. 2000; 404: 625-628Google Scholar, 23Maiorano D. Moreau J. Mechali M. Nature. 2000; 404: 622-625Google Scholar). The association of Cdt1 with the pre-RC depends on ORC but is independent of Cdc6 and takes place prior to the association of MCM2–7 with chromatin (22Nishitani H. Lygerou Z. Nishimoto T. Nurse P. Nature. 2000; 404: 625-628Google Scholar, 23Maiorano D. Moreau J. Mechali M. Nature. 2000; 404: 622-625Google Scholar). Cdt1 appears to be identical to the essential component of the replication licensing factor RLF-B that has been characterized by Blow and co-workers (24Tada S., Li, A. Maiorano D. Mechali M. Blow J.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 107-113Google Scholar) and Wohlschlegel et al. (25Wohlschlegel J.A. Dwyer B.T. Dhar S.K. Cvetic C. Walter J.C. Dutta A. Science. 2000; 290: 2309-2312Google Scholar) as the licensing element in Xenopus egg extracts. ADrosophila homologue of Cdt1 has also been isolated (26Whittaker A.J. Royzman I. Orr-Weaver T.L. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1765-1776Google Scholar); the Double Parked gene product is essential for replication, and the protein co-localizes with ORC at sites of chorion gene amplification in ovarian follicle cells. Xenopus,Drosophila, and human Cdt1 are tightly associated with geminin, which is a negative regulator of pre-RC formation that prevents the loading of MCM onto chromatin (1Bell S.P. Dutta A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 333-374Google Scholar, 24Tada S., Li, A. Maiorano D. Mechali M. Blow J.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 107-113Google Scholar, 25Wohlschlegel J.A. Dwyer B.T. Dhar S.K. Cvetic C. Walter J.C. Dutta A. Science. 2000; 290: 2309-2312Google Scholar, 27McGarry T.J. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1998; 93: 1043-1053Google Scholar). To date, geminin has been widely used as an inhibitor of pre-RC formation in studies of metazoan DNA replication. In contrast, a geminin counterpart has not been found in S. cerevisiae and S. pombe. Most pre-RC components are conserved among eukaryotes, but geminin is perhaps unique to metazoans. Very recently, an S. cerevisiaehomologue of Cdt1 has been identified and shown to be included in the pre-RC and to function in loading the MCM complex onto chromatin (28Tanaka S. Diffley J.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 198-207Google Scholar,29Devault A. Vallen E.A. Yuan T. Green S. Bensimon A. Schwob E. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 689-694Google Scholar). Surprisingly, S. cerevisiae Cdt1 and XenopusCdt1 are only weakly similar (12%), suggesting that amino acid sequence alignments may not be useful in identifying Cdt1 functional domains, regulatory mechanisms, and interactions within the pre-RC. Thus, Cdt1 represents a new target for the regulation of pre-RC formation, and considerable attention has been focused on the molecular function of Cdt1 in DNA synthesis. To better understand the relevance of the geminin-Cdt1 system to replication in higher eukaryotes, we characterized mouse homologues of Cdt1 (mCdt1). We cloned the mCdt1 cDNA, overexpressed the protein in bacterial cells, and purified it to near homogeneity. Biochemical analysis of purified proteins and yeast two-hybrid analysis allowed us to determine the organizational structure of mCdt1. mCdt1 is divided into three domains: an amino-terminal region, which is poorly conserved among eukaryotes, a central region (amino acids 177–380), which contains a geminin binding site and which is conserved among metazoans, and a carboxyl-terminal region (amino acids 407–477), which binds to MCM6 and is highly conserved among eukaryotes. Unexpectedly, we found that mCdt1 binds to both single- and double-stranded DNA in a sequence-nonspecific manner. The DNA binding domain was found to reside in the amino-terminal region that overlaps with the geminin binding domain. Interestingly, geminin disrupts not only the interaction between mCdt1 and MCM6 but also the mCdt1 DNA binding activity. These results suggest that mCdt1 plays a key role in the establishment of the pre-RC by mediating protein-protein interactions via specific domains and that it possesses an intrinsic DNA binding activity that allows it to anchor the MCM complex onto chromatin. The amino acid sequence of the human Cdt1 was used to screen the NCBI EST database for the murine Cdt1 homologue. This search identified three murine expressed sequence tagsAI605978, AA139554, and AA671429 (NCBI accession numbers). Sequence-specific primers were used to generate a FLAG tagged full-length mCdt1 by PCR from a murine embryonic cDNA library (Clontech). PCR primers were as follows: forward primer, 5′-CCGCTAGCGACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAGCATATGGCGCAAAGTCGTGTTACCGA-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GGCTCGAGCCCCTCGGCGTGGACGTG-3′. The PCR product was digested with NheI-XhoI and inserted intoNheI- and XhoI-digested pET24b (Novagen) to generate pET-FLAG-mCdt1-His6. The FLAG tag was incorporated into the forward primer. Yeast two-hybrid analysis was performed as described (30Izumi M. Yanagi K. Mizuno T. Yokoi M. Kawasaki Y. Moon K.Y. Hurwitz J. Yatagai F. Hanaoka F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4769-4777Google Scholar). cDNAs for full-length mCdt1, mouse ORC1, -2, -3, -4, -5, and -6, mouse geminin, mouse Cdc45, and mouse Cdc6 were synthesized by PCR from a murine embryonic cDNA library (Clontech) using the following oligonucleotides to incorporate appropriate restriction sites. Primer sets were as follows: mCdt1, 5′-CCGAATTCATGGCGCAAAGTCGTGTTAC-3′ and 5′-GGCTCGAGCCCCTCGGCGTGGACGTG-3′; mORC1, 5′-GGCAATTGATGCCATCCTACCTCACAAG-3′ and 5′-CCGTCGACTACTCTTCTTTGAGAGCAAA-3′; mORC2, 5′-GGGAATTCGGATCCATGAGCACTCTGCAGTTAAA-3′ and 5′-CCGTCGACGGTACCTATGCCTCCTCCTCTTCCT-3′; mORC3, 5′-GGCAATTGATGCACACGGGGCCGCGCAC-3′ and 5′-GGCTCGAGTTAACAGCCTCCCCATGTAA-3′; mORC4, 5′-GGCAATTGATGAGCAGTCGTAAAACCAA-3′ and 5′-GGCTCGAGTCACAGCCAGCTTAGTGAGG-3′; mORC5, 5′-CCGAATTCATGTCTCACTTGGAGAGCAT-3′ and 5′-GGCTCGAGTCACAAGAAATCATACAAGT-3′; mORC6, 5′-CCGAATTCATGGAGTCGGAGCTGGTACG-3′ and 5′-GGCTCGAGTCAATCTGCTGGTGCTGTCT-3′; mCdc6, 5′-GGCAATTGGGATCCATGCCTCAAACCAGATCCCAG-3′ and 5′-GGCTCGAGGTACCTAGGGCAGACCAGCAGCGAG-3′; mCdc45, 5′-CCGGATCCGGGAATTCGCTGGTACCATGTTCGTGA-3′ and 5′-CCGTCGACTCGAGACAGCAGTGACACAAGAGC-3′; geminin, 5′-CCGAATTCGAGCTCATGAATCTCAGTATGAAGCA-3′ and 5′-GGCTCGAGGTACCTCATGTACACGGCCTAGCAT-3′. The cDNAs for mCdt1 amino-terminally truncated mutants were amplified by using the reverse primer 5′-GGCTCGAGCCCCTCGGCGTGGACGTG-3′ with one of the following forward primers: ΔN1–171, 5′-CCGAATTCACAGAGCAACCATGTGTCGA-3′; ΔN1–334, 5′-CCGAATTCGTGCCGGACGACCAGCTGAC-3′; or ΔN1–458, 5′-CCGAATTCCGCCTGCAGCGGTTAGAGCG-3′. The cDNAs for carboxyl-terminally truncated mutants were amplified by using the forward primer 5′-CCGAATTCATGGCGCAAAGTCGTGTTAC-3′ and one of the following reverse primers: ΔC520–557, 5′-GGCTCGAGCGGCAGCAACTCTGCCAGGA-3′; ΔC289–557, 5′-GGCTCGAGCAGCAAGGGCTCGATGGTGA-3′; or Δ131–557, 5′-GGCTCGAGGTCCTCTGAGGGGATCTTGC-3′. The PCR products were digested with EcoRI, MunI, SalI, orXhoI and subcloned into compatible sites of pLexA and pB42AD, respectively. For the construction of GST-tagged mCdt1 deletion mutants, PCR fragments were subcloned into the vector pSKB4 (a kind gift of Dr. K. Kamada, RIKEN) derived from pGEX6P-1 (Amersham Biosciences). The cDNAs encoding amino-terminally truncated mutant proteins were amplified by using the reverse primer 5′-GGCTCGAGCCCCTCGGCGTGGACGTG-3′ and one of the following forward primers: GSTΔN1–127, 5′-GGCATATGTCAGAGGACTCCGTCTCTGA-3′; GSTΔN1–176, 5′-GGCATATGGTCGAGAAAGCTCCTGCCTA-3′; GSTΔN1–293. 5′-GGCATATGGGTGCCACCCAGCTCACAGC-3′; GSTΔN1–406, 5′-GGCATATGTCTACTCCACCACTCCCGGCCACT-3′; or GSTΔN1–478, 5′-GGCATATGTCTGAGCGGAAGCCGGCACTCACT-3′. The cDNAs for carboxyl-terminally truncated mutants were amplified by using the forward primer 5′-CCGAATTCATGGCGCAAAGTCGTGTTAC-3′ and one of the following reverse primers: GSTΔC131–557, 5′-GGCTCGAGGTCCTCTGAGGGGATCTTGC-3′; GSTΔC180–557, 5′-GGCTCGAGTTTCTCGACACATGGTTGCT-3′; or GSTΔC381–557, 5′-GGCTCGAGCTCAGCCGAGCGCAGGGCCA-3′. The PCR products were digested with either NdeI or XhoI and subcloned into the compatible sites of pSKB4. The identities of all these constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing on an Applied Biosystems 377A automatic DNA sequencer. FLAG-tagged mCdt1 was overproduced in the E. colistrain BL21(DE3) grown in 2× YT medium (1.6% tryptone, 1% yeast extract, and 0.5% NaCl) with 100 μg/ml kanamycin. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.4 mm, and the cells were incubated for an additional 1 h at 25 °C. Cells were lysed by sonication in Buffer A containing 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The lysate was cleared by centrifugation and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with phosphocellulose resin (Whatman) previously equilibrated with Buffer A. Following incubation, the resin was washed extensively with Buffer A, and the proteins were eluted with Buffer A plus 300 mm KCl. The eluate was mixed with cobalt-chelating TALON-Sepharose (Clontech) equilibrated with Buffer A. The resin was washed with 10 column volumes of Buffer A plus 300 mmNaCl, and the protein was eluted with Buffer A containing 150 mm imidazole and 150 mm KCl. The eluate was mixed with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody-conjugating Sepharose (Sigma) equilibrated with Buffer A for 2 h at 4 °C. Following incubation, the resin was washed extensively with Buffer A, and the proteins were eluted with Buffer A plus 0.1 mg/ml FLAG peptide. Finally, the proteins were applied to a Superdex 200 PC2.3/30 SMART column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with Buffer A containing 150 mm KCl. Deletion mutants with the GST tag were purified according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). T7- and His6-tagged mouse geminin was expressed in bacteria and purified to near homogeneity by cobalt-chelating TALON-Sepharose (Clontech) on a MiniS SMART column followed by a Superdex 200 PC2.3/30 SMART column according to instructions provided by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). Purification of the recombinant mouse MCM4/6/7 complex in insect cells was performed as described previously (13You Z. Komamura Y. Ishimi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8003-8015Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibody was prepared from a rabbit injected with the carboxyl-terminal fragment of bacterially expressed mCdt1 (amino acids 425–557). A PCR fragment containing this fragment was digested by EcoRI and BamHI and subcloned into EcoRI- and BamHI-digested pET24a (Novagen). PCR primers were as follows: 5′-CCGAATTCAGCGCCCTGAAGGGTGTGTC-3′ and 5′-CCGGTACCTCGAGCCCCTCGGCGTGGACGT-3′. Antibody was purified with Thiophilic-Uniflow resin (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fifty ng of mCdt1 and 50 ng of MCM4/6/7 complex were mixed in the presence or absence of various amounts of geminin and immunoprecipitated with 1 μl of anti-mCdt1 antiserum or preimmune serum that had been pre-absorbed to protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 4 h at 0 °C in 100 μl of NET-gel buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.25% gelatin. After washing with NET-gel buffer, precipitates were dissolved with 30 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer and then subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using anti-MCM6, anti-geminin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-mCdt1 antibodies as described previously (31Mizuno T. Yamagishi K. Miyazawa H. Hanaoka F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7886-7896Google Scholar). Fifty ng of GST-tagged mCdt1 mutant proteins and geminin or the MCM4/6/7 complex were mixed with glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 4 h at 4 °C in 100 μl of NET-gel buffer. After washing with NET-gel buffer, GST-tagged proteins were eluted with 30 μl of Laemmli sample buffer and then subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using anti-GST (Amersham Biosciences), anti-MCM6 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or anti-T7 tag (Novagen) antibodies. Fifty ng of GST-tagged mCdt1 was incubated with 20 μl of single-stranded DNA-cellulose or double-stranded DNA-cellulose (Sigma), which had been equilibrated with Buffer A for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing with Buffer A, bound proteins were eluted by increasing concentrations of NaCl. Proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining. To identify the mCdt1 domain essential for DNA binding, full-length mCdt1 was mixed simultaneously with five amino-terminally truncated proteins (GSTΔN1–127, GSTΔN1–176, GSTΔN1–293, GSTΔN1–406, and GSTΔN1–478) or three carboxyl-terminally truncated proteins (GSTΔC381–557, GSTΔC180–557, and GSTΔC131–557) and incubated with DNA-cellulose, and bound proteins were eluted by increasing concentrations of NaCl. Proteins were detected by silver staining. To examine the effect of geminin on the DNA binding activity of mCdt1, increased amounts of T7-tagged geminin were preincubated with 50 ng of GST-tagged mCdt1 for 1 h at 4 °C and incubated with double-stranded DNA-cellulose for 1 h 4 °C, and unbound proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis with an anti-mCdt1 and anti-geminin antibodies. Sequences of the oligonucleotides used are as follows: 17-mer, 5′-GTTTTCCCAGTCACGAC-3′; 37-mer, 5′-GTTTTCCCAGTCACGACGTTGTAAAACGACGGCCAGT-3′; 70-mer, 5′-GTTTTCCCAGTCACGACGTTGTAAAACGACGGCCAGTGCCAAGCTTGCATGCCTGCAGGTCGACTCTAGA-3′; 70-mer (AT), 5′-TTTTATGTTTAGATCTTTTATGCTTGCTTTTCAAAAGGCCTGCAGGCAAGTGCACAAACAATACTTAAAT-3′. The gel-purified oligonucleotides were 5′-end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP.32P-End-labeled oligonucleotide (50 fmol) and 50 ng of FLAG-tagged mCdt1 were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5% glycerol, 0.05% Triton X-100, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) in a 10-μl reaction volume. Protein·DNA complexes were resolved on 1% agarose gels at 4 °C in 0.5× TBE buffer (45 mm Tris-HCl, 45 mmH3BO3, 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.3) at 10 V. After electrophoresis, the gel was fixed, dried, and subjected to autoradiography. For super-shift assays, anti-T7 or anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma) antibody was added to the above reaction, and the mixture was incubated on ice for 10 min before loading on gels. To identify the cDNA encoding the mouse Cdt1, we screened the mouse EST database and obtained the clones AI605978, AA139554, and AA671429. The full-length open reading frame was obtained by screening a mouse embryonic fibroblast cDNA library (Clontech). The cloned cDNA encodes a putative protein of 557 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 61.5 kDa. The predicted protein is 72% identical and 79% similar to human Cdt1, 46% identical toXenopus Cdt1, and 25% identical to DrosophilaCdt1/DUP. Alignment of the mCdt1 cDNA sequence with the human,Xenopus, Drosophila, S. pombe, andS. cerevisiae sequences reveals extensive conservation in the carboxyl-terminal region of the proteins for a broad range of eukaryotes (Fig. 1). The center region, spanning 200 to 350 residues, is conserved among metazoans but is not found in fungi. Canonical sequence motifs were not detected for the mouse sequence. We also screened genomic sequence databases with the mCdt1 cDNA and found genomic sequences containing mCdt1 open reading frames. The full-length mCdt1 open reading frame consists of 10 exons interrupted by 9 introns and overall spans 4598 bases (data not shown). All exon-intron junction sequences conform to the canonical GT/AG rule. The positions of introns are depicted byarrowheads in Fig. 1 B. Interestingly, the central region conserved among metazoans is encoded exactly by exons 4 and 5, whereas the carboxyl-terminal region conserved among eukaryotes is encoded by exons 9 and 10. While our manuscript was in preparation, cDNA encoding mouse Cdt1 homologue was reported (32Arentson E. Faloon P. Seo J. Moon E. Studts J.M. Fremont D.H. Choi K. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1150-1158Google Scholar). The coding sequence of our mCdt1 cDNA was identical to that of the mCdt1 gene published recently (32Arentson E. Faloon P. Seo J. Moon E. Studts J.M. Fremont D.H. Choi K. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1150-1158Google Scholar). To analyze mCdt1 protein-protein interactions, we carried out a yeast two-hybrid analysis. Full-length mCdt1 was fused to the LexA DNA binding domain as a bait, and various replication factors, including mouse ORC1–6, MCM2–7, Cdc6, Cdc45, and geminin, were fused to the BA42 transcriptional activation domain as prey, and interactions between bait and prey were monitored in yeast cells. We found that mCdt1 associates tightly with mouse MCM6 and mouse geminin (Fig. 2 A). In addition, a weak but significant interaction of mCdt1 with mouse ORC2 was also detected. To further determine which domains are required for interactions with MCM6 and geminin, an mCdt1 deletion series was constructed as baits, as shown in Fig. 2 B, and two-hybrid analyses were performed. The amino-terminally truncated mutant ΔN1–171 and the carboxyl-terminally truncated mutant ΔC520–557 strongly interact with both geminin and Mcm6, as efficiently as does full-length mCdt1. The interaction involving the ΔC520–557 construct reproducibly yielded higher β-galactosidase activity than did interactions involving full-length mCdt1, suggesting that the carboxyl-terminal region (521–557) may inhibit the binding of mCdt1 to geminin or MCM6. In contrast, mutant constructs with larger deletions (ΔN1–458 and ΔC131–557) are not capable of binding to MCM6 and geminin fusions. Interestingly, the amino-terminally truncated mutant ΔN1–334 associates with MCM6 but not with geminin, whereas the carboxyl-terminally truncated mutant ΔC289–557 associates with geminin but not with MCM6. These results suggest that the central region (residues 172–288) is important for interaction with geminin, whereas the carboxyl terminus (residues 335–519) is required for interaction with MCM6. These results were confirmed by in vitro binding experiments as described below (see Fig. 4).Figure 4mCdt1 interacts with the MCM4/6/7 complex and geminin in vitro.

The major component of NFTs is aberrantly hyperphosphorylated microtubule-associated protein tau. Because appropriate in vivo models have been lacking, the role of tau phosphorylation in NFTs formation has remained elusive. Here, we describe a new model in which adenovirus-mediated gene expression of tau, ΔMEKK, JNK3, and GSK-3β in COS-7 cells produces most of the pathological phosphorylation epitopes of tau including AT100. Furthermore, this co-expression resulted in the formation of tau aggregates having short fibrils that were detergent-insoluble and Thioflavin-S-reactive. These results suggest that aberrant tau phosphorylation by the combination of these kinases may be involved in “pretangle,” oligomeric tau fibril formation in vivo.

Moreover, this aggregate formation is enhanced by the existence of a polyanion such as heparin (7Goedert M. Jakes R. Spillantini M.G. Hasegawa M. Smith M.J. Crowther R.A.

Pathol. 1997; 150: 2181-2195PubMed Google Scholar) in the absence of tau phosphorylation. However, these in vitro conditions may not be relevant to the mechanism underlying the formation of NFTs, because tau is always aberrantly hyperphosphorylated in AD. Therefore, it would seem necessary to consider the role of hyperphosphorylation of tau in the abnormal aggregation of filamentous tau. The assembly of phosphorylated tau was also observed during the presence of 4-hydoroxy-2-nonenal (11Perez M. Cuadros R. Smith M.A. Perry G. Avila J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 486: 270-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), a lipid peroxidation by-product of oxidative stress. Increased oxidative stress is reported to occur in AD (12Perry G. Roder H. Nunomura A. Takeda A. Friedlich A.L. Zhu X. Raina A.K. Holbrook N. Siedlak S.L. Harris P.L. Smith M.A. Neuroreport. 1999; 10: 2411-2415Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 13Behl C.

Neurochem. 2000; 74: 270-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Interestingly, phospho-tau immunoreactive neurons are also stained positively with 8-hydroxy-oxyguanine, another marker for oxidative stress (16Nunomura A. Perry G. Pappolla M.A. Wade R. Hirai K. Chiba S. Smith M.A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1959-1964Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Nunomura A. Perry G. Aliev G. Hirai K. Takeda A. Balraj E.K. Jones P.K. Ghanbari H. Wataya T. Shimohama S.

These results suggest that oxidative stress may, in part, trigger the formation of NFTs. If oxidative stress does participate in NFTs formation in AD, such stress can lead to the activation of kinases that phosphorylate tau and stimulate NFT formation. One such candidate kinase is stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK), a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family that is activated by several kinase cascades. Recent studies, employing antibodies against paired helical filaments (PHFs), have reported that activated phospho-JNK co-localized in neurons displaying PHF immunoreactivities (18Mohit A.A. Martin J.H. Miller C.A. Neuron. 1995; 14: 67-78Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 19Zhu X. Raina A.K. Rottkamp C.A. Aliev G. Perry G. Boux H. Smith M.A. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 435-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Phospho-JNK was also shown to translocate from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in NFT-bearing neurons (19Zhu X. Raina A.K. Rottkamp C.A. Aliev G. Perry G. Boux H. Smith M.A. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 435-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Furthermore, JNK has been shown to phosphorylate tau at Ser422 (20Goedert M. Hasegawa M. Jakes R. Lawler S. Cuenda A. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), a site that is specifically phosphorylated in AD brains (21Zheng-Fischhofer Q. Biernat J. Mandelkow E.M. Illenberger S. Godemann R. Mandelkow E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 252: 542-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). To understand the role of tau phosphorylation in NFT formation, we sought to develop a model that could reproduce the aberrant tau phosphorylation, including phosphorylation of Thr212 and Ser214, key sites commonly referred to as the AT100 epitope. The AT100 epitope appears to be more specific for Alzheimer tau and required more than one kinase to be accomplished in vitro (22Hasegawa M. Morishima-Kawashima M. Takio K. Suzuki M. Titani K. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17047-17054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we used an adenovirus-mediated gene expression system to synergistically express tau, ΔMEKK, JNK3, and GSK-3β. This system enabled us to produce hyperphosphorylation of tau in cultured cells including that at AT100 and PS422. This hyperphosphorylated tau formed aggregates that were detergent-insoluble and Thioflavin-S-reactive and displayed relatively shorter fibrils than PHF. Our results suggest that the aberrant phosphorylation of tau can contribute to the formation of oligomeric tau fibrils and that other additional factors may be required for the growth step of tau fibrils. All transcription units were ligated into cassette cosmid pAxCAwt (TaKaRa) digested withSwaI, so that the insert was transcribed under the control of the CAG promoter (23Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4617) Google Scholar). Using PCR and Pyrobest DNA polymerase (TaKaRa) with pFLAG-CMV2-JNK3 (24Ito M. Yoshioka K. Akechi M.

Biol. 1999; 19: 7539-7548Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) as a template, the mouse JNK3 open reading frame was amplified along with the FLAG tag primer (5′-ACCATGGACTACAAAGACGATGACGAC-3′) and the arm primer of these expression vectors (5′-GCACTGGAGTGGCAACTTC-3′). pcDNA3-FLAG-ΔMEKK (24Ito M. Yoshioka K. Akechi M. Yamashita S. Takamatsu N. Sugiyama K. Hibi M. Nakabeppu Y. Shiba T. Yamamoto K.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7539-7548Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), which encodes residues 1169–1488 of mouse MEKK1, was used as a template to generate pAxCA-FLAG-ΔMEKK via PCR and the FLAG tag primer and ΔMEKK-ter primer (5′-CTACCACGTGGTACGGAAG-3′). Human wild type GSK-3β cDNA, tagged with a Myc epitope at the carboxyl terminus, was cloned into the pCIneo vector (Promega). The GSK-3β open reading frame was excised by EcoRI digestion from pCIneo-GSK-3β, blunt-ended, and cloned into pAxCAwt at theSwaI site (designated pAxCA-GSK-3β). Human wild type Tau four-repeat (Tau4RWT) cDNA, tagged with a FLAG epitope at the amino-terminal and a Myc epitope at the carboxyl terminus, was cloned into pCIneo. The Tau4RWT open reading frame was excised byXhoI and NotI digestion from pCIneo-Tau4RWT, blunt-ended, and then inserted into pAxCAwt at the SwaI site (designated pAxCA-Tau4RWT). These resulting cosmid clones were used to generate recombinant adenoviruses (designated AxCA vector) using the COS-TPC method (25Miyake S. Makimura M. Kanegae Y. Harada S. Sato Y. Takamori K. Tokuda C. Saito I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1320-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). Briefly, cosmid DNA was co-transfected with theEcoT221-digested DNA-terminal protein complex of Ad-dlX (26Saito I. Oya Y. Yamamoto K. Yuasa T. Shimojo H. J. Virol. 1985; 54: 711-719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) into human embryonic kidney 293 cells to generate the recombinant viruses via homologous recombination. These recombinant viruses were propagated in 293 cells. After the third propagation, viruses were extracted from the 293 cells, purified using a double cesium step gradient purification (27Kanegae Y. Makimura M. Saito I. Jpn. J. Med. Sci. Biol. 1994; 47: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar), dialyzed against a vehicle solution containing 10% glycerol in PBS (pH 7.4), and stored at −80 °C. Titers of the recombinant viruses were determined with the modified end point cytopathic effect assay and 293 cells (27Kanegae Y. Makimura M. Saito I. Jpn. J. Med. Sci. Biol. 1994; 47: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Titers were expressed in plaque-forming units. Positive expression of the inserted gene product was confirmed by Western blot analysis using COS-7 cells. Adenoviruses containing JNK3, ΔMEKK, GSK-3β, Tau4RWT, and LacZ were named AxCA-JNK3, AxCA-ΔMEKK, AxCA-GSK-3β, AxCA-Tau4RWT, and AxCAi-LacZ, respectively. COS-7 cells were exposed to recombinant adenovirus at various multiplicities of infection (MOI) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum. 48 h after infection, cells were washed once with PBS and harvested. Cells were lysed with RIPA buffer (50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1% SDS, 5 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzene-sulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, 2 ng/ml aprotinin, 5 ng/ml leupeptin, 5 ng/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm NaF, 1 mmNa3VO4, and 1 mmβ-glycerophosphate). Cell lysates were briefly sonicated, and then protein concentrations were determined using the BCA method (Pierce). 5–30 μg of total protein per lane were separated on 8% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp.). The blotted membranes were blocked with 5% skimmed milk in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) for 1 h at room temperature, washed with PBST, and then incubated for 2 h at room temperature with primary antibodies. A variety of different primary antibodies and dilutions were used during these experiments.

Res. 1993; 34: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), 1:5000 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), was also used. After primary antibody incubation, the membranes were washed with PBST three times and incubated with either goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) at a dilution of 1:5000 for 1 h at room temperature. In cases showing mobility shifts of phosphorylated tau, the membranes were reincubated with goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Promega) at a dilution of 1:7500 for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with PBST three times, the bands were visualized by the ECL system (AmershamBiosciences). Images were documented with a LAS-1000 luminescent image analyzer (Fuji Films). For quantification of proteins on immunoblots, serial dilutions of cell lysates were loaded onto gels to obtain a calibration curve, which allowed reliable quantification. All bands were quantified using the proprietary software, Image Gauge (version 3.0) (Fuji Films Science Lab 97). Statistical analyses were performed using one-factor analysis of variance (p < 0.01), followed by post hoc pairwise comparisons using Fisher's protected least significant differences. In all bar graphs, error bars indicate the S.E. of three separate experiments, whereas ** and * represent significant differences of p < 0.001 andp < 0.01, respectively. COS-7 cells infected with recombinant adenoviruses were lysed with RIPA buffer containing 1% SDS. 2 mg of cell lysate were centrifuged for 20 min at 100,000 × g at 4 °C. The resulting pellet was washed four times with 300 μl of RIPA buffer using a sonic homogenizer. The insoluble pellet was solubilized in 70% formic acid for use in the immunoblot analysis or resuspended in 100 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.3) for examination using electron microscopy. Following centrifugation for 20 min at 100,000 × g at 4 °C, the formic acid fraction was collected, air-dried, and subjected to immunoblot analysis after suspension in SDS gel loading buffer. The samples were resolved on 8% SDS-PAGE gels, transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and isolated, and insoluble tau was identified with the TauC antibody, as mentioned above. For double immunohistochemistry, cell preparation and immunohistochemical staining was performed as previously described (33Chui D.H. Shirotani K. Tanahashi H. Akiyama H. Ozawa K. Kunishita T.

Briefly, cells in culture dishes were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 4 min and then with cold methanol-acetone (1:2) for 6 min. The fixed cells were incubated with anti-AT8 (1:400) for 3 h at 4 °C followed by incubation with the secondary antibody, Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Capple) for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were subsequently double-labeled using standard Thioflavin-S histochemistry. The stained cells were mounted in PBS-glycerin (1:9) and analyzed with a fluorescence microscope. For immunoelectron microscopy, the RIPA-insoluble pellet that was resuspended in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3) (see above) was absorbed onto glow-charged supporting membranes placed on 300-mesh grids. After three washes with 100 mm phosphate buffer, treated samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C in primary antibody solution containing either AT8 (1:20) or AT100 (1:40) or no antibody (for negative control) diluted in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3). After washing, the samples were incubated with colloidal-gold conjugated secondary antibody (5 nm in diameter; 1:50, British BioCell International) for 2 h, fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde in 100 mm phosphate buffer for 5 min, negatively stained with neutralized 2% sodium phosphotungstic acid, and examined with an electron microscope (LEO 912AB, LEO Electron Microscopy, Ltd.). The cell pellets were suspended in 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer for 4 h at 4 °C. After washing, cells were embedded in 3% agarose, and then the samples were cut into 0.5-mm3 blocks. The sample blocks were cryoprotected by immersion in graded concentrations of glycerol (10, 20, and 30%) in 0.1 m phosphate buffer. The slices were plunged rapidly into liquid propane (−184 °C) by using a Leica EM CPC rapid freezing unit (Reichert, Vienna, Austria). The sections were dehydrated in 0.5% uranyl acetate dissolved in anhydrous methanol for 48 h at −90 °C followed by raising of the temperature in steps of 4 °C/h from −90 to −45 °C in a Leica AFS cryosubstitution unit (Reichert). After washing with anhydrous methanol, the sections were infiltrated with Lowicryl HM20 resin (Polyscience, Inc., Warrington, PA) with a progressive increase in the ratio of resin to methanol and polymerized with ultraviolet light (360 nm) for 24 h at −45 °C. For immunostaining, ultrathin sections (70–80 nm) mounted on nickel grids were incubated with saturated sodium (meta)periodate for 20 min. After washing, the sections were incubated with 5% normal goat serum in washing buffer (0.1 mTris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% gelatin) for 20 min and then with primary antibody (anti-TauC, 1:50 dilution) overnight at 4 °C. The sections were then washed with washing buffer and incubated with 5-nm colloidal gold-conjugated secondary antibody for 2 h. After a thorough wash, the sections were counterstained and examined electron-microscopically (LEO 912AB, LEO, Oberkochen, Germany). Because JNK is activated through ΔMEKK (35Yan M. Dai T. Deak J.C.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3369-3381Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), we first investigated the ability of JNK3 to phosphorylate tau in the presence or absence of ΔMEKK (Fig. 1). Four different combinations of cDNAs (longest human tau with JNK3 and/or ΔMEKK or with LacZ) were introduced into COS-7 cells by using the adenovirus-mediating gene transfer method (Fig. 1). All of the cells expressed significant levels of tau, JNK3, ΔMEKK, and/or LacZ (100% expression efficiency was obtained when the MOI of each construct used was over 10; data not shown). Cells co-expressing tau and JNK3 exhibited only negligible levels of activated forms of JNK (Fig.1 B, lane 1). In contrast, cells co-expressing tau, JNK3, and ΔMEKK exhibited significant levels of activated JNK (Fig. 1 B, lane 2). JNK activation by ΔMEKK was associated with the reduced mobility of tau in SDS-PAGE and the reduced Tau-1-immunoreactivity (Fig. 1,C and D, lane 2) when compared with those in cells co-expressing tau with JNK3 alone, ΔMEKK alone, or LacZ (Fig. 1, lanes 1, 3, and 4). These results suggest that ΔMEKK activation is required for JNK3 to phosphorylate tau in COS-7 cells. We further analyzed phosphorylated tau epitopes in cells co-expressing tau, JNK3, and ΔMEKK using the well characterized phosphorylation dependent anti-tau antibodies PS199, PT205, PT231, PS262, PS396, PS404, PS422, AT8, AT100, AT180, and AT270 (Fig. 2). The level of tau phosphorylation at each site was quantified as a ratio of immunoreactivity of each antibody to that of phospho-independent tau antibody TauC (Fig. 2 a). Images of Western blots are shown in the lower panels of Fig. 2, and the graphs showing the corresponding quantification are shown in theupper panels. The levels of phosphorylation at PT205, PT231, PS396, AT8, AT180, AT270, PS422, and AT100 sites were significantly increased in cells expressing activated JNK3 (Fig. 2,b–i). In particular, tau phosphorylation at PT205, AT8, and PS422 was dramatically increased in response to JNK3 activation. Activation of JNK3 by ΔMEKK (MOI = 100) resulted in a 77-fold increase in PT205 immunoreactivity, an 81-fold increase in AT8 immunoreactivity, and a 330-fold increase in PS422 immunoreactivity (Fig. 2, b, e, and h, lane 3, respectively) when compared with those from cells co-infected with LacZ (MOI = 100). AT100 immunoreactivity in these cells displayed an 18-fold increase over that in control cells expressing LacZ (Fig. 2 i, lane 3). Interestingly, AT100 as well as PS422 epitopes are known to be more specific in Alzheimer tau (21Zheng-Fischhofer Q. Biernat J. Mandelkow E.M. Illenberger S. Godemann R. Mandelkow E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 252: 542-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 22Hasegawa M. Morishima-Kawashima M. Takio K. Suzuki M. Titani K. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17047-17054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The immunoreactivities of PT231, PS396, AT180, and AT270 in activated JNK3-expressing cells (Fig. 2,c, d, f, and g,lane 3, respectively) exhibited 3–5-fold increases over those in control cells. PS199, PS262, and PS404 immunoreactivities increased only 1–1.8-fold, suggesting that these epitopes are not major phosphorylation sites for JNK3 (Fig. 2,j–l, lane 3, respectively). Thus, with JNK3 activation, the Ser202, Thr205, and Ser422 sites were most susceptible, the Thr212and Ser214 sites were moderately susceptible, and the Thr181, Thr231, Ser235, and Ser396 sites were relatively less but significantly susceptible to JNK3-mediated phosphorylation. The Ser199, Ser262, and Ser404 sites appear to be unsusceptible to JNK3 phosphorylation. JNK3 phosphorylates tau at most of the pathological sites except Ser199, Ser262, and Ser404. These JNK3-sensitive or -insensitive sites overlapped with those reported in a previous in vitro study using recombinant proteins (39Reynolds C.H. Betts J.C. Blackstock W.P. Nebreda A.R. Anderton B.H. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1587-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). In the same study, GSK-3β was reported to phosphorylate some of the JNK-insensitive sites. Motivated by this finding, we next attempted to simultaneously express tau, ΔMEKK, JNK3, and GSK-3β in COS-7 cells to determine the effect of simultaneous overexpression of activated JNK3 and GSK-3β on tau phosphorylation in our model. We refer to this co-expression as quadruple expression in this paper. Fig. 3 a shows a result from the Western blot analysis probed with the phospho-independent anti-tau antibody TauC. With quadruple expression, tau migrated more slowly almost as a single band than tau phosphorylated solely by activated JNK3 (Fig. 3 a, lanes 1 and2), suggesting that additional overexpression of GSK-3β to activated JNK3 causes additive effect on tau phosphorylation in COS-7 cells. The Western blot analysis using the PS199, PS262, and PS404 antibodies indicated the enhanced phosphorylation at these JNK3-insensitive sites (Fig. 3, b–d). Moreover, other sites also displayed enhanced phosphorylation in response to additional GSK-3β expression. For example, the immunoreactivities of AT8 (Fig.3 g), AT180 (Fig. 3 e), and AT100 (Fig.3 i) with quadruple expression increased 2–3.4-fold compared with those with activated JNK3 expression alone. In contrast, additional GSK-3β expression had no significant additive effect on the AT270 (Fig. 3 f) and PS422 (Fig. 3 h) immunoreactivities. Taken together, activated JNK3 and GSK-3β synergistically phosphorylated tau at most of the pathological phosphorylation sites of tau in COS-7 cells. To determine whether this quadruple expression in COS-7 cells induces aberrant tau aggregates, cells were stained with the phospho-dependent anti-tau antibody AT8 (Fig.4 b) and Thioflavin-S histochemistry (Fig. 4 a). Thioflavin-S is known as a marker for the insoluble protein aggregates with β-pleated sheets, as is shown in Fig. 4 g, displaying an NFT-bearing neuron in an AD brain. AT8 staining was confined mainly to the cytoplasm of quadruple expressing cells. Some of these cells exhibited Thioflavin-S staining in the cytoplasm, probably showing a partial aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau in these cells (Fig. 4, a–c). We never found Thioflavin-S staining in tau/JNK3/ΔMEKK-, tau/GSK-3β-, and tau/LacZ-expressing cells (Fig. 4, d–f). These data suggest that some cells simultaneously expressing tau, activated-JNK3, and GSK-3β occasionally form aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau with β-sheet structures. We further investigated biochemically whether hyperphosphorylated tau formed insoluble fibrillar aggregates. Lysates from cells co-expressing tau, ΔMEKK, JNK3, and/or GSK-3β were dissolved in RIPA (containing 1% SDS) buffer, and both RIPA-soluble and -insoluble fractions were analyzed. Fig. 5 a shows an immunoblot of the RIPA-soluble fractions probed with the phospho-independent anti-tau antibody TauC. Although the total amounts of tau recovered in the RIPA-soluble fractions were almost constant, mobility of tau in each lane changed depending on the combination of kinases expressed. RIPA-insoluble materials were next solubilized using 70% formic acid and dissolved into Laemmli sample buffer after lyophilization. Only tau from quadruple-expressing cells was recovered in the formic acid fraction (Fig. 5 b), suggesting that tau from quadruple-expressing cells becomes partly insoluble in RIPA (containing 1% SDS). The ultrastructure of immunolabeled RIPA insoluble materials from quadruple expressing cells and AD brains were investigated by using the electron microscope. We found RIPA-insoluble tau filaments from AD brains identified with the AT8 and AT100 antibodies (Fig. 5,c and e, respectively) that had two different shapes with different diameters: short fibrils with 10-nm diameter (Fig. 5 c) and relatively longer fibrils with 20-nm diameter (Fig. 5 e). Consistent with this observation, in the RIPA-insoluble fractions of quadruple-expressing cells, the AT8- and AT100-positive tau aggregates were identified that contain short fibril-like structures with about 10-nm diameters (Fig. 5, dand f, respectively). The similar tau aggregates were found in the perinuclear regions of the quadruple expressing cells (Fig.5 g) but not in control cells expressing tau and LacZ (Fig.5 h). These data suggest that hyperphosphorylation of tau by GSK-3β and activated JNK3 could enforce the formation of tau aggregates sometimes containing short fibrils. In this report, we demonstrate that activated JNK3 phosphorylates tau in COS-7 cells. This kinase increases levels of tau phosphorylation at the epitopes of PT205, PT231, PS396, PS422, AT8, AT100, AT180, and AT270. This is almost consistent with the results obtained from thein vitro studies (40Reynolds C.H. Utton M.A. Gibb G.M. Yates A. Anderton B.H. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1736-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The combination of activated JNK3 and GSK-3β cooperatively phosphorylates 12 Ser and Thr residues of tauin vivo. These include the AT100 site, which is the specific phosphorylation site in PHF tau. There are more than 19 phosphorylation sites identified in PHF tau (41Morishima-Kawashima M. Hasegawa M. Takio K. Suzuki M. Yoshida H. Titani K. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 823-829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Most phosphorylation-dependent tau antibodies, however, also have been known to recognize a fraction of tau from biopsied normal adult or fetal brains, although the levels of phosphorylation are less than those recognized in AD brains (42Matsuo E.S. Shin R.W. Billingsley M.L. Van deVoorde A. O'Connor M. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Neuron. 1994; 13: 989-1002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Among these antibodies, AT100 never recognizes normal adult or fetal tau but does specifically recognize PHF tau (22Hasegawa M. Morishima-Kawashima M. Takio K. Suzuki M. Titani K. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17047-17054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Matsuo E.S. Shin R.W. Billingsley M.L. Van deVoorde A. O'Connor M. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Neuron. 1994; 13: 989-1002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Thus, the AT100 epitope is a unique and specific phosphorylation site in PHF tau. In this sense, tau in quadruple expressing cells is in a similar phosphorylation state to that in AD. The in vitro phosphorylation of AT100 epitope was reported by using the combination of protein kinase A and GSK-3β (22Hasegawa M. Morishima-Kawashima M. Takio K. Suzuki M. Titani K. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17047-17054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). According to this study, the phosphorylation of the AT100 epitope required the sequential phosphorylation of GSK-3β and protein kinase A, although the other combination may be due to the phosphorylation of these epitopes. This combination may not be relevant to AD tau formation, because neither GSK-3β nor protein kinase A can phosphorylate Ser422, a site that is highly phosphorylated in AD brain (20Goedert M. Hasegawa M. Jakes R. Lawler S. Cuenda A. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 21Zheng-Fischhofer Q. Biernat J. Mandelkow E.M. Illenberger S. Godemann R. Mandelkow E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 252: 542-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). In our study, activated JNK3 phosphorylated tau both at the Ser422 and AT100 epitopes. However, activated JNK3 did not phosphorylate the Ser199, Ser262, and Ser404 sites, phosphorylation of which required the additional expression of GSK-3β. Furthermore, immunoreactivity for AT100 epitopes is much more enhanced in cells co-expressing both activated JNK3 and GSK-3β. It is also possible that the formation of AT100 epitopes in cells expressing only activated JNK3 may result from the synergism between JNK3 and endogenous GSK-3β. Thus, the combination of GSK-3β and activated JNK3 can phosphorylate tau at most of the phosphorylation sites documented in AD. Recent studies reported that activated phospho-JNK or GSK-3β co-localized in NFT-bearing (18Mohit A.A. Martin J.H. Miller C.A.

Taken together, activated JNK and GSK-3β may be a strong candidate kinase combination involved in the mechanisms of tau pathology in AD. It has been a question for a long time whether the aberrant phosphorylation of tau is a cause of NFT formation or just a consequence of some other unidentified process. One hint was provided by a recent in vitro study that showed that hyperphosphorylation of tau in AD brain induces self-assembly of tau into PHF (51Alonso A. Zaidi T. Novak M. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6923-6928Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). Our present results indicate that the aberrant phosphorylation of tau results in the formation of short fibrils that are RIPA-insoluble. These fibrils were relatively shorter than reported PHF in AD brains. Since similar types of fibrils were also recovered from AD brains, tau fibrils observed in the quadruple expressing COS-7 cells might be a good model to study tau aggregation in a cellular environment. The formation of NFTs is mainly divided into three stages. First is the pretangle stage, which exhibits PHF epitopes and becomes Gallyas silver-positive. Second is the mature tangle stage, which shows PHF epitopes, Gallyas silver staining, and Thiazine Red staining, which recognizes fibrillar structures. The last is the ghost tangle stage. Our histochemical study revealed AT8 and Thioflavin-S-positive staining; Thioflavin-S is more sensitive than Thiazine Red when recognizing oligomeric fibrils with β-sheet structure (52LeVine III, H. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 274-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1213) Google Scholar). However, overall the staining pattern did not show a clear fibrillar structure, suggesting that COS-7 cells expressing both activated JNK3 and GSK-3β may mimic the neurons in the pretangle stage but not in the mature tangle stage. Thus, the aberrant phosphorylation of tau probably promotes tau oligomer formation such as seen in the pretangle stage. Other factors or certain intracellular environment are apparently required for the development of this stage to the mature one. For example, antiapoptotic factors might be such candidates, since activated JNK3 and GSK-3β have been known to activate a cascade for apoptosis. Further studies will be required to identify this tau fibril growth factors."

This study addresses the role of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress proteins (bip, grp94) in GEC injury. GEC that overexpress cPLA2 (produced by transfection) and “neo” GEC (which expresses cPLA2at a lower level) were incubated with complement (40 min), and leakage of constitutively expressed bip and grp94 from ER into cytosol was measured to monitor ER injury. Greater leakage of bip and grp94 occurred in complement-treated GEC that overexpress cPLA2, as compared with neo, implying that cPLA2 activation perturbed ER membrane integrity. After chronic incubation (4–24 h), C5b-9 increased bip and grp94 mRNAs and proteins, and the increases were dependent on cPLA2. Expression of bip-antisense mRNA reduced stimulated bip protein expression and enhanced complement-dependent GEC injury. Glomerular bip and grp94 proteins were up-regulated in proteinuric rats with PHN, as compared with normal control. Pretreatment of rats with tunicamycin or adriamycin, which increase ER stress protein expression, reduced proteinuria in PHN.

Physiol. 1989; 256: F44-F51Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, cPLA2 may mediate GEC injury more directly (16Cybulsky A.V. Monge J.C. Papillon J. McTavish A.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: F739-F749Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). cPLA2 (group IV PLA2) is regulated by [Ca2+]i and phosphorylation (27Hirabayashi T. Shimizu T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1488: 124-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 28Dessen A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1488: 40-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Stimuli that raise [Ca2+]i in the submicromolar range may induce translocation of cPLA2 from cytosol to an intracellular membrane, where cPLA2 would bind via its N-terminal Ca2+-dependent lipid binding or C2 domain, gaining access to phospholipid substrate. We have demonstrated that cPLA2 is the major PLA2 in GEC and that complement enhances cPLA2 phosphorylation and catalytic activity (16Cybulsky A.V. Monge J.C. Papillon J. McTavish A.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: F739-F749Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, C5b-9 increases free AA in GEC, and release of AA is amplified by overexpression of cPLA2 (16Cybulsky A.V. Monge J.C. Papillon J. McTavish A.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: F739-F749Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,17Panesar M. Papillon J. McTavish A.J. Cybulsky A.V. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 3584-3594PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated that cPLA2 localizes and hydrolyzes phospholipids at the plasma membrane in GEC, the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and the nuclear envelope but not at mitochondria or Golgi (29Liu J. Takano T. Papillon J. Khadir A. Cybulsky A.V. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Thus, the activation of cPLA2 and release of AA are compartmentalized to specific organelles, but it is presently unknown if hydrolysis of membrane phospholipids by cPLA2 leads to injury of these organelles in GEC. Based on studies in cell culture, complement attack may injure cells but may also activate pathways that restrict injury or facilitate recovery. One mechanism of protection from complement attack is “ectocytosis” (shedding) of C5b-9 complexes from cell membranes (1Morgan B.P. Curr. Topics. Microbiol. Immunol. 1992; 178: 115-140PubMed Google Scholar,2Nicholson-Weller A. Halperin J.A. Immunol. Res. 1993; 12: 244-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). There are undoubtedly other recovery mechanisms that require delineation. For example, exposure of cells to environmental stress increases expression of stress proteins in cellular compartments such as the ER. There are several types of ER stress responses, including the “unfolded protein response” (30Lee A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 31Pahl H.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 683-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 32Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1923) Google Scholar). ER stress proteins are believed to be induced by accumulation of abnormal proteins or depletion of ER Ca2+ stores and include the glucose-related proteins (grp), grp94, bip (grp78), and erp72. Tunicamycin, a nucleoside antibiotic that blocks N-linked glycosylation and is believed to cause an accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER, and the Ca2+ ionophore, ionomycin, which can deplete Ca2+ from intracellular stores, can induce ER stress proteins (30Lee A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 31Pahl H.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 683-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 32Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1923) Google Scholar). Under normal conditions, ER stress proteins might serve as protein chaperones for exocytosis from ER, and they might complex with defective proteins and target them for degradation. During stress, the induction of ER stress proteins may limit accumulation of abnormal proteins in cells (31Pahl H.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 683-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 32Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1923) Google Scholar). Generally, regulation of ER stress proteins appears to be controlled at the transcriptional level, and requires several hours and de novo protein synthesis. Moreover, exposure of cells to mild stress, which induces ER stress proteins, may be protective to additional insults (33Liu H. Bowes R.C. van de Water B. Sillence C. Nagelkerke J.F. Stevens J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21751-21759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 34Bush K.T. George S.K. Zhang P.L. Nigam S.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F211-F218PubMed Google Scholar), although prolonged or more substantial ER stress may lead to cell death by apoptosis (35Rao R.V. Hermel E. Castro-Obregon S. del Rio G.

The aim of the present study was to determine if C5b-9-mediated activation of cPLA2 and GEC injury are associated with induction of the ER unfolded protein response. We demonstrate that C5b-9 may damage the ER and enhance expression of ER stress proteins via activation of cPLA2. Induction of ER stress proteins limits complement-dependent GEC injury in culture and in PHN.

GEC that express only the neomycin-resistance gene (neo) were used as control. Briefly, GEC were co-transfected with the expression vector of interest, and pRc/RSV (molar ratio 12.5:1), using a CaPO4 technique. Colonies of GEC resistant to G418 were isolated and expanded. Transfectants were selected for a high level of cPLA2 activity and protein expression or, in the case of bip antisense cDNA, inhibition of stimulated bip protein expression (determined by immunoblotting). Compared with parental or neo GEC, PLA2 activity was increased ∼5-fold in GEC that overexpress cPLA2, but was nevertheless within a physiological range, and comparable to the level in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (16Cybulsky A.V. Monge J.C. Papillon J. McTavish A.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: F739-F749Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Panesar M. Papillon J. McTavish A.J. Cybulsky A.V. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 3584-3594PubMed Google Scholar). To activate complement, GEC in monolayer culture were incubated with rabbit anti-GEC antiserum (5% v/v) in modified Krebs-Henseleit buffer containing 145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.5 mm MgSO4, 1 mmNa2HPO4, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 5 mm glucose, and 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, for 40 min at 22 °C (16Cybulsky A.V. Monge J.C. Papillon J. McTavish A.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: F739-F749Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Panesar M. Papillon J. McTavish A.J. Cybulsky A.V. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 3584-3594PubMed Google Scholar). GEC were then incubated with normal human serum (diluted in Krebs-Henseleit buffer in acute incubations, or K1 medium in chronic incubations) or with heat-inactivated (decomplemented) human serum (56 °C) in controls, at 37 °C. In some experiments, antibody-sensitized GEC were incubated with C8-deficient human serum or C8-deficient serum supplemented with purified C8 (80 μg/ml undiluted serum). We have generally used heterologous complement to facilitate studies with complement-deficient sera, and to minimize possible signaling via complement-regulatory proteins, however, in earlier studies results of several experiments were confirmed with homologous (rat) complement. There was some variability in sublytic and lytic concentrations of complement among batches of sera. In GEC, complement is not activated in the absence of antibody, and antibody does not independently affect free [3H]AA (16Cybulsky A.V. Monge J.C. Papillon J. McTavish A.J. Am. J.

Methods Enzymol. 1988; 162: 421-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Male Sprague-Dawley rats (150 g, Charles River, St. Constant, Quebec) were injected with 350 μl of sheep anti-Fx1A antiserum. This batch of antiserum caused little proteinuria in the heterologous phase (day 5 or earlier) but induced significant proteinuria in the autologous phase (days 7–14). Rats were sacrificed at various intervals, and glomeruli were isolated by differential sieving (37Salant D.J. Cybulsky A.V. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 162: 421-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence microscopy for sheep IgG, rat IgG, and rat C3 was performed as described previously (11Cybulsky A.V. Rennke H.G. Feintzeig I.D. Salant D.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 77: 1096-1107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 4-μm cryostat kidney sections were stained with fluorescein-conjugated IgG fractions of monospecific antisera. The immunofluorescence signals from whole glomeruli were evaluated using a Leitz immunofluorescence microscope with visual output connected to a Nikon UFX-II photomultiplier and camera, similar to a method described earlier (38Pruchno C.J. Burns M.M. Schultze M. Johnson R.J. Baker P.J. Alpers C.E. Couser W.G. Am. J. Pathol. 1991; 138: 203-211PubMed Google Scholar). Densitometry readings were done under immersion oil, and the biopsy material was magnified 400 times, such that the glomerular cross-section filled the majority of the densitometry field. The time required to collect an image from a glomerulus is inversely proportional to immunofluorescence intensity. Times required to collect images from three representative glomeruli in each tissue section were recorded and averaged. Serum creatinine measurements were performed in the clinical biochemistry laboratory of the Royal Victoria Hospital (Montreal, Quebec). GEC phospholipids were labeled to isotopic equilibrium with [3H]AA for 48–72 h, as detailed previously (16Cybulsky A.V. Monge J.C. Papillon J. McTavish A.J. Am. J.

Pathol. 2000; 156: 2091-2101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA was extracted from GEC using the TRIzol reagent. RNA was separated by gel electrophoresis (1% agarose containing 1.9% formaldehyde) and was transferred to a nylon membrane. Coding regions of rat bip, grp94, and erp72 cDNAs were radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the Random Primer DNA Labeling System. Membranes were hybridized in buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin, 7% SDS, 0.5 m sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, 1 mm EDTA, and 1–2 × 106 cpm/ml of radiolabeled probe for 16 h at 42 °C. Membranes were washed in buffer containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 5% SDS, 40 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, 1 mm EDTA twice for 20 min at 65 °C, and then buffer containing 1% SDS, 40 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, 1 mm EDTA four times for 20 min at 65 °C. Membranes were exposed to x-ray film with an intensifying screen at −70 °C for 48–72 h. For immunoblotting, GEC or glomerular lysates were mixed with Laemmli sample buffer and were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose paper, blocked with 5% fat-free dry milk in 20 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, with 0.05% Tween 20 (15–17). Blots were incubated with primary antibodies. After washing with Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20 solution, blots were incubated with secondary antibody and developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence technique. Quantification of Northern blots and immunoblots was performed by densitometry. Blots were scanned, specific bands of interest were selected, and the density of the bands was measured using National Institutes of Health Image software. Results are expressed in arbitrary units. Preliminary studies demonstrated that there was a linear relationship between densitometric measurements and the amounts of protein loaded onto gels. Complement-mediated cell lysis was determined by measuring release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), as described previously (15Cybulsky A.V. Takano T. Papillon J. McTavish A.J. Am. J.

Kidney Int. 1998; 34: 43-52Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Specific release of LDH was calculated as [NS − HIS]/[100 − HIS], where NS represents the percentage of total LDH released into cell supernatants in incubations with normal serum, and HIS is the percentage of total LDH released into cell supernatants in incubations with heat-inactivated serum (36Quigg R.J. Cybulsky A.V. Jacobs J.B. Salant D.J. Kidney Int. 1998; 34: 43-52Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Thet statistic was used to determine significant differences between two groups. For more than two groups, one-way analysis of variance was used to determine significant differences among groups, and where significant differences were found, individual comparisons were made between groups using the t statistic, and adjusting the critical value according to the Bonferroni method. Two-way analysis of variance was used to determine significant differences in multiple measurements among groups. Incubation of GEC with antibody and complement increases free AA (16Cybulsky A.V.

Stable overexpression of cPLA2 in GEC amplifies the complement-induced increase in free AA (465 ± 183% control at 24 h) (19Cybulsky A.V. Takano T. Papillon J. McTavish A.J. Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 1052-1062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Table I shows levels of free [3H]AA in complement-treated GEC that stably overexpress cPLA2. Incubation of antibody-sensitized GEC with normal serum as the complement source increased [3H]AA more than 3-fold, as compared with heat-inactivated (decomplemented) serum. C8 is the key component of the C5b-9 membrane attack complex. Incubation of GEC with C8-deficient serum reconstituted with purified C8 also increased free [3H]AA more than 3-fold, as compared with unreconstituted C8-deficient serum or with heat-inactivated serum. Therefore, PLA2-mediated release of AA is due to assembly of C5b-9, whereas C5b-7 has no significant effect.Table IC5b-9-induced release of [3H]AAFree [3H]AAA)NS2.96 ± 0.66ap < 0.01versus HIS.HIS0.86 ± 0.16B)C8DS + C85.47 ± 0.47bp < 0.005 versusC8DS and HIS; three experiments performed in duplicate.C8DS1.57 ± 0.42HIS1.25 ± 0.20A: [3H]AA-labeled GEC that overexpress cPLA2 were incubated with anti-GEC antibody and normal serum (NS) at a sublytic concentration (2.5% v/v), or heat-inactivated serum (HIS) in controls, for 40 min at 37 °C.

Complement-induced activation of cPLA2 leads to phospholipid hydrolysis at the membrane of the ER (29Liu J. Takano T. Papillon J. Khadir A. Cybulsky A.V. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We assessed whether hydrolysis of ER membrane phospholipids may induce injury to the ER compartment. Resting GEC express the ER stress proteins, bip and grp94, and these proteins are localized mainly in the ER (Fig.1). The integrity of the ER membrane was monitored by the leakage of constitutively expressed bip and grp94, from the ER compartment into the cytosol. Brief incubation of GEC with complement (2.5% normal serum, 40 min) induced significant increases in the amounts of bip or grp94 in the cytosol of the GEC that overexpress cPLA2 (a representative immunoblot is shown in Fig. 1 A, and densitometric quantification is given in TableII A). The amount of bip or grp94 in the cytosol represented only a minor proportion of the total (<15%), and brief incubation with complement did not induce significant increases in total ER stress protein expression (Fig. 1). At the concentration of complement that induced increases in bip and grp94 in the cytosol of GEC that overexpress cPLA2, there were no significant increases in bip or grp94 in the cytosol of neo GEC (Table II A). However, increases in bip and grp94 could be detected in the cytosol of neo GEC when the concentration of complement was increased (4.0% normal serum, Fig.1 B and Table II B). These results suggest that activation of cPLA2 by complement perturbed the ER membrane sufficiently to allow a small portion of bip"
https://openalex.org/W1550663817,"α-Hemoglobin stabilizing protein (AHSP) is a small (12 kDa) and abundant erythroid-specific protein that binds specifically to free α-(hemo)globin and prevents its precipitation. When present in excess over β-globin, its normal binding partner, α-globin can have severe cytotoxic effects that contribute to important human diseases such as β-thalassemia. Because AHSP might act as a chaperone to prevent the harmful aggregation of α-globin during normal erythroid cell development and in diseases of globin chain imbalance, it is important to characterize the biochemical properties of the AHSP·α-globin complex. Here we provide the first structural information about AHSP and its interaction with α-globin. We find that AHSP is a predominantly α-helical globular protein with a somewhat asymmetric shape. AHSP and α-globin are both monomeric in solution as determined by analytical ultracentrifugation and bind each other to form a complex with 1:1 subunit stoichiometry, as judged by gel filtration and amino acid analysis. We have used isothermal titration calorimetry to show that the interaction is of moderate affinity with an association constant of 1 × 107m−1 and is thus likely to be biologically significant given the concentration of AHSP (∼0.1 mm) and hemoglobin (∼4 mm) in the late pro-erythroblast. α-Hemoglobin stabilizing protein (AHSP) is a small (12 kDa) and abundant erythroid-specific protein that binds specifically to free α-(hemo)globin and prevents its precipitation.

Mammalian hemoglobin, the red blood cell oxygen transport molecule, is a tetramer of two α- and two β-globin chains. Exquisitely coordinated expression of these α- and β-globin chains is required during erythropoiesis to generate high concentrations of hemoglobin, without production of either chain in excess; any disruption of normal globin gene expression patterns can lead to serious human disease (1Rachmilewitz E.A. Schrier S.L. Nagel R.L. Disorders of Hemoglobin. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge2001: 233-251Google Scholar, 2Nathan D.G. Gunn R.B. Am. J. Med. 1966; 41: 815-830Google Scholar). One such disease is β-thalassemia, a common genetic disorder caused by mutations in one or more of the β-globin gene loci that result in reduced β-globin production. In addition to the direct effects of reduced β-globin synthesis, many of the symptoms of this disorder appear to be consequences of the resulting cytotoxic buildup of free α-globin (1Rachmilewitz E.A. Schrier S.L. Nagel R.L. Disorders of Hemoglobin. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge2001: 233-251Google Scholar, 2Nathan D.G. Gunn R.B. Am. J. Med. 1966; 41: 815-830Google Scholar). Free α-globin is highly unstable and readily precipitates, damaging membrane structures and triggering the apoptotic cell death of erythroid precursors (1Rachmilewitz E.A. Schrier S.L. Nagel R.L. Disorders of Hemoglobin. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge2001: 233-251Google Scholar). The effects of dysregulated expression of individual globin chains can be severe, and consequently, it has long been thought that additional factors within the cell may assist with the processing of free globin chains and their assembly into mature hemoglobin (3Huang S.-C. Benz E.J. Nagel R.L. Disorders of Hemoglobin. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge2001: 166-173Google Scholar). The identification of any such factors proved elusive for a long time. Recently however, Kihm et al. (4Kihm A.J. Kong Y. Hong W. Russell J.E. Rouda S. Adachi K. Simon M.C. Blobel G.A. Weiss M.J. Nature. 2002; 417: 758-763Google Scholar) identified α-hemoglobin stabilizing protein (AHSP), 1The abbreviations used are: AHSP, α-hemoglobin stabilizing protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HPLC, high-performance liquid chromatography; PMB, p-hydroxymercuribenzoate; CD, circular dichroism. 1The abbreviations used are: AHSP, α-hemoglobin stabilizing protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HPLC, high-performance liquid chromatography; PMB, p-hydroxymercuribenzoate; CD, circular dichroism. a small 102-residue protein that may act to neutralize the harmful effects of any free α-globin generated during either normal erythropoiesis or in circumstances of disease (4Kihm A.J. Kong Y. Hong W. Russell J.E. Rouda S. Adachi K. Simon M.C. Blobel G.A. Weiss M.J. Nature. 2002; 417: 758-763Google Scholar). Expression of the AHSP gene is strongly up-regulated by the essential erythroid transcription factor GATA-1 such that AHSP accumulates to relatively high concentrations (∼0.1 mm) in late erythroid precursor cells (4Kihm A.J. Kong Y. Hong W. Russell J.E. Rouda S. Adachi K. Simon M.C. Blobel G.A. Weiss M.J. Nature. 2002; 417: 758-763Google Scholar, 5Shirihai O.S. Gregory T., Yu, C. Orkin S.H. Weiss M.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2492-2502Google Scholar). AHSP mRNA is present specifically in all hematopoietic tissues of the fetus and adult mouse, consistent with a role in the regulation of hemoglobin production throughout pre- and post-natal life. AHSP specifically binds to the α-chain of hemoglobin, but not to the β-chain or to tetrameric hemoglobin, making it an ideal candidate for an α-globin-specific chaperone. Consistent with a role for AHSP in regulating coordinated globin expression, gene-targeting studies in mice showed that ablation of AHSP function leads to erythrocyte abnormalities that are also observed in β-thalassemia. The staining of erythrocytes from these mice with crystal violet reveals that they contain inclusion bodies of denatured hemoglobins, know as Heinz bodies (4Kihm A.J. Kong Y. Hong W. Russell J.E. Rouda S. Adachi K. Simon M.C. Blobel G.A. Weiss M.J. Nature. 2002; 417: 758-763Google Scholar). AHSP also prevents the precipitation of α-globin both in vitro and in COS cells, further supporting the idea that AHSP may prevent pathological aggregation and precipitation of α-globinin vivo. Little further is currently known about the action of AHSP or the molecular details of its interaction with α-globin. Interestingly, however, the protein was previously identified (and named EDRF, for erythroid differentiation related factor) as a marker for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (6Miele G. Manson J. Clinton M. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 361-364Google Scholar), although the significance of this finding is currently unclear. Nothing is known about the physical or conformational properties of AHSP. Little information is available from sequence comparisons, because AHSP displays no clear homology to any protein of known structure. Here, we present the first biophysical analysis of AHSP and its specific interaction with α-globin. We demonstrate that AHSP is primarily α-helical in conformation, probably with an extended C-terminal region, and that it is slightly elongated. We also show that AHSP is monomeric in solution at concentrations of up to 1 mm and that the AHSP·α-globin complex has a 1:1 stoichiometry with an association affinity constant (K A) of 1.0 × 107m−1 at 20 °C. The formation of this complex does not appear to involve large-scale structural rearrangements of either component, judging from circular dichroism data, although small changes in either one or both components may take place. In addition, we find that the heme group of α-globin is not required for AHSP interaction. Finally, the behavior of truncation mutants of AHSP indicates that at least six amino acids from the N terminus and 17 from the C terminus are dispensable for α-globin binding activity. Full-length human AHSP cDNA (GenBankTM accession number AF147435) was sub-cloned into the bacterial expression vector pGEX-2T (AmershamBiosciences). Expression from this plasmid in Escherichia coli BL21 cells yielded full-length AHSP as a protein fusion with glutathione S-transferase (GST). AHSP expression was performed in shaker flasks overnight at 25 °C. Following cell lysis, the fusion protein was captured on a reduced glutathione-agarose column (Amersham Biosciences), and the AHSP polypeptide was subsequently released from the column by treatment with thrombin (Sigma), which acted at the engineered cleavage site encoded by the pGEX-2T vector. AHSP fractions were dialyzed into 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and applied to an UNO-Q anion exchange column (Bio-Rad). Isocratic elution of AHSP in 50 mm NaCl, 20 mmsodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, yielded protein of >95% purity as determined by reversed-phase HPLC (Phenomenex C18) and SDS-PAGE analysis. A final gel filtration step on Superose 12 (AmershamBiosciences) produced a single protein peak corresponding to AHSP. The molecular mass of the purified protein as determined by electrospray mass spectrometry was 11,984 ± 0.5 Da, in agreement with the predicted mass of 11,984 Da (including an additional Gly-Ser dipeptide at the N terminus of the protein, which remains after thrombin cleavage). The final yield was ∼26 mg of purified AHSP per liter of bacterial culture. Purified α- and β-globin were obtained from human blood. All purification steps were carried out at 4 °C, where possible. Human red blood cells were obtained from whole blood by centrifugation (3000 rpm, 10 min) and washing with 0.9% (w/v) NaCl. Carbon monoxide was bubbled through the cell suspension to form CO-liganded hemoglobin, a stable form more resistant to oxidation-induced precipitation. Hemolysates were generated by addition of five cell-pellet volumes of deionized water on ice, and membrane fractions were removed by centrifugation (7000 rpm, 15 min) after addition of NaCl to a final concentration of 0.9% (w/v). The α- and β-globin chains were separated using the well-established method of reaction withp-hydroxymercuribenzoate (PMB) (7Bucci E. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 97-106Google Scholar). In this case, 2.4 g of hemoglobin was incubated overnight with 143 mg of PMB, and the globin chains were separated on DEAE-Sepharose following Ikeda-Saitoet al. (8Ikeda-Saito M. Inubushi T. Yonetani T. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 113-121Google Scholar). PMB was removed from both chains by overnight incubation with 20 mm dithiothreitol. Mass spectrometry analysis was used to monitor PMB-globin adduct formation and to confirm quantitative removal of PMB from the final globin preparations. Further purification of α-globin was performed by fast-protein liquid chromatography using an Amersham Biosciences Mono-S column. Protein was loaded in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.6), and α-globin eluted in linear gradient of 0–175 mm NaCl over 6 column volumes. For β-globin fractions, protein was applied to a Mono-Q column in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.5, buffer A) and eluted in a gradient of 0–100% buffer B (20 mm sodium phosphate, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.0). Purified α- and β-globin were stored frozen at −80 °C until required. After thawing, purified globins were re-charged with CO, and a final gel filtration step on Superose 12 (Amersham Biosciences) was performed directly prior to use in all experiments (any apo-α-globin formed during purification was excluded from the column). Concentrations of purified globin chains were estimated from the concentration of the associated heme group, which was calculated by measuring absorption at 390 nm of globin samples unfolded in 6m guanidine hydrochloride. Measured absorbances were compared with a standard curve generated from purified hemin (Sigma). As a further control, heme concentration was also estimated from iron concentration as determined by flame ionization atomic absorption spectroscopy (using a Varian ApectrAA-20). These two methods gave consistent results. Aliquots of apo-α-globin and apo-β-globin, which lack the heme prosthetic group, were prepared by reversed-phase HPLC. For each aliquot, ∼5 mg of protein from the DEAE-Sepharose α- or β-globin fraction was loaded onto an Alltima C18 column (Alltech) in 10% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and a gradient of 10–90% acetonitrile was applied over 50 min at a flow rate of 1 ml min−1. The apo-globin fraction was lyophilized and stored at −20 °C. Apo-globins were re-suspended in 50 mmsodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and filtered through a 0.2 μm membrane directly prior to use. N- and C-terminal truncation mutants were generated by PCR and cloned into the pGEX6P1 expression plasmid (Amersham Biosciences), and their identities were verified by DNA sequencing. Expression and purification were carried out as described for the full-length protein, except that AHSP was liberated from the GST portion of the fusion protein using the PreScission protease (Amersham Biosciences). The masses of the deletion proteins were verified by electrospray mass spectrometry to exclude the possibility of further unwanted proteolytic digestion. Spectra were collected on a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter, using a 1-mm path-length cell, and the temperature was controlled using a water-jacketed cell holder. Spectra were collected at 20 °C over the wavelength range 184–260 nm, using a resolution of 0.5 nm and a bandwidth of 1 nm. Final spectra were the sum of three scans accumulated at a speed of 20 nm min−1 with a response time of 1 s. For the thermal denaturation measurements, the ellipticity at 222 nm was monitored over a temperature range of 10–88 °C, using a resolution of 0.2 °C, a bandwidth of 1 nm, and a temperature gradient of 1 °C min−1. CD spectra were analyzed, essentially by the method of Chen and Yang (9Chen Y.H. Yang J.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1971; 44: 1285-1291Google Scholar), using the CDPro software package available from lamar.colostate.edu/∼sreeram/CDPro/main.html (10Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 282: 252-260Google Scholar). Size exclusion chromatography was carried out at either 16 or 4 °C using either a Superose 12 column (Amersham Biosciences) with a running buffer containing 150 mm NaCl and 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, or a TSK-GEL column (G2000SWXL, MAC-MOD) with a running buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mmHepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA. The columns were calibrated using the molecular mass standards RNase A (13.7 kDa), chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), and albumin (67 kDa), and a standard curve was constructed by plotting log10 M r against elution volume. Molecular weights for injected samples were estimated by comparison to the standard curve. Amino acid analysis was performed by the Australian Proteome Analysis Facility (Sydney, Australia) to determine the compositions and concentrations of purified AHSP, α-globin, and AHSP·α-globin complex. Due to the similar retention times of the AHSP and AHSP·α-globin peaks during gel filtration, complexes for amino acid analysis were collected after injection of mixtures containing excess α-globin to avoid contamination with free AHSP. The quantity of each amino acid was expressed as a molar percentage of the total measured amino acid content, and these values were compared with calculated amino acid percentages for theoretical complexes of 1:1, 1:2, and 2:1 ratios of AHSP·α-globin. To determine the goodness of fit, χ2 values were calculated as Σ(quantityexpected − quantitycalculated)2. Serine was excluded from our analysis due to systematic error in this measurement. Calorimetric experiments were carried out using a MicroCal VP-ITC titration calorimeter. Protein solutions were buffer-exchanged into 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 150 mm NaCl by gel filtration chromatography. Heats of reaction were determined by multiple injections of 100 μm AHSP into 10 μmα-globin at 20 °C, with stirring at 310 rpm and a delay of 250 s between each injection. The reverse experiment (i.e. injections of 100 μm α-globin into 10 μm AHSP) was also performed. Heats of dilution for all experiments were measured from injection of each protein into buffer, and these values were subtracted from the binding data. Titration curves were analyzed using Origin 5.0 software (MicroCal) by fitting to various simple models provided in the software. Equilibrium and sedimentation velocity experiments were performed using a Beckman model XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with an An-60 Ti rotor. Proteins were buffer exchanged into 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 150 mm NaCl by gel filtration chromatography, and protein concentrations were determined in the XL-A by reference to a blank containing this buffer alone. For equilibrium measurements, data were collected in six-sector cells as absorbance (280 nm) versus radius scans (0.001-cm increments, 10 averages) at 18,000, 30,000, and 42,000 rpm. Scans were collected at 3-h intervals and compared to determine when the samples reached equilibrium. Analysis of the data was carried out using the NONLIN software (11Johnson M.L. Correia J.J. Yphantis D.A. Halvorson H.R. Biophys. J. 1981; 36: 575-588Google Scholar), and the best model and final parameters were determined by examination of the residuals derived from fits to several models. For sedimentation velocity experiments, absorbance data were collected in two-channel centerpieces in continuous mode with a step size of 0.003 cm and at time intervals of 900 s, with no signal averaging. Preceding each run, the samples were spun at 3000 rpm for at least 3 h so that they reached thermal equilibrium in the rotor. Data were analyzed using the program Sedfit (12Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Google Scholar) to simultaneously determine the apparent molecular weight (M r,app) and sedimentation coefficient for a given buffer and temperature (s T,b). In the above analyses, the partial specific volumes (- v)of each protein were determined from the amino acid sequences (13Perkins S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 157: 169-180Google Scholar) and adjusted for temperature (14Durchschlag H. Hinz H.-J. Thermodynamic Data for Biochemistry and Biotechnology. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1986: 45Google Scholar) using the program SEDNTERP. 2D. B. Hayes, J. P. Philo, and T. M. Laue (1994)sedNTerp: Interpretation of Sedimentation Data Version 1.X, 2000 lines of Visual Basic code, written for Windows 3.X, www.bbri.org/rasmb/rasmb.html. The buffer density was taken to be 1.0068 g ml−1 and the viscosity 0.0105 Poise at 20 °C. For other temperatures, buffer density (ρT,b) and viscosity (ηT,b) were calculated using the SEDNTERP program, assuming the bulk of the temperature dependence to be contributed by the majour component, water. Values fors T,b were transformed to standard sedimentation coefficients in water at 20 °C (s 20,w) using the following equation (16Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. The Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge1992: 90-125Google Scholar), where the density of water at 20 °C (ρ20,w) is 0.9982 g ml−1 and the viscosity (η20,w) is 0.01002 poise. For consideration of theoretical spherical molecules, the anhydrous radius (R) was calculated from molecular weight following the empirical relationship r = 6.72 × 10−9 M r1/3 (17Teller D.C. Nature. 1976; 260: 729-731Google Scholar), and values for the frictional coefficient (f o) ands were calculated as described previously (16Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L.

A secondary structure prediction carried out on the amino acid sequence of AHSP revealed that the protein may contain substantial amounts of α-helix (Fig.1 A). We therefore sought to confirm this experimentally. A far-UV circular dichroism spectrum of AHSP (Fig. 1 B) displays minima at 209 and 222 nm and a maximum at ∼190 nm, indicating that the protein is folded and adopts a largely α-helical conformation. Analysis of the CD spectrum using the CDPro software package suggests that AHSP contains ∼70% α-helix. A thermal denaturation experiment, monitored using the ellipticity at 222 nm, showed that AHSP unfolds reversibly with aT m of 60 °C. All of these data are consistent with the protein adopting a well-defined, largely α-helical conformation. Given that free oxy-α-globin has a propensity to aggregate and precipitate, we investigated the possibility that the protein might be partially unfolded and that the binding of AHSP might stabilize α-globin by inducing substantial conformational change. A far-UV CD spectrum (Fig. 1 C), deconvoluted using CDPro, reveals that free α-globin contains ∼80% α-helix. Notably, α-globin within the hemoglobin tetramer is ∼75% α-helix, suggesting that free α-globin retains similar levels of secondary structure even in the absence of its β-globin partner, a conclusion in line with previous studies (19Beychok S. Tyuma I. Benesch R.E. Benesch R. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 2460-2462Google Scholar). In addition, thermal denaturation of α-globin, carried out as described above, revealed a single highly cooperative unfolding transition with a T m of 59 °C, consistent with a well-defined fold. Formation of the AHSP·α-globin complex appears to result in a small reduction in total α-helical content (Fig. 1 C), but there is little evidence for large-scale structural rearrangement, suggesting that α-globin stabilization by AHSP occurs through an alternative mechanism. It should be borne in mind, however, that changes in the spatial organization of α-helices might not be detected in this experiment. We next sought to define the aggregation states of both AHSP and α-globin in solution. As noted previously, oxy-α-hemoglobin is unstable, largely as a result of oxidation of the iron (II) heme group to iron (III), and subsequent reactions leading to protein precipitation (20Rachmilewitz E.A. Peisach J. Blumberg W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 3356-3366Google Scholar, 21Macdonald V.W. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 231: 480-490Google Scholar). In contrast, the CO-liganded form of α-globin is much more resistant to this oxidation-induced precipitation but retains the ability to bind AHSP (4Kihm A.J. Kong Y. Hong W. Russell J.E. Rouda S. Adachi K. Simon M.C. Blobel G.A. Weiss M.J. Nature. 2002; 417: 758-763Google Scholar). Thus, we have used the CO-liganded form of α-globin to study the physical properties of the molecule and its interaction with AHSP. Gel filtration chromatography of purified AHSP indicated that the protein forms a single species of discrete molecular size, with no evidence of aggregation into high molecular weight forms, even at concentrations up to 1 mm (AHSP is estimated to attain a concentration of 0.1 mm in pro-erythroblasts (4Kihm A.J. Kong Y. Hong W. Russell J.E. Rouda S. Adachi K. Simon M.C. Blobel G.A. Weiss M.J. Nature. 2002; 417: 758-763Google Scholar)). Calibration of the column with molecular weight standards indicated that AHSP migrates in a position consistent with a globular protein of ∼23 kDa, roughly twice the mass predicted by the primary amino acid sequence. By comparison, α-globin ran close to its expected monomeric size of ∼14 kDa. However, because the elution properties of proteins in size exclusion chromatography are shape-dependent, we chose to characterize the aggregation state of both AHSP and α-globin using sedimentation equilibrium experiments. The data in Fig.2 A show clearly that AHSP is monomeric, suggesting that its gel filtration profile may reflect anisotropy in the shape of the protein. A single species fit was observed for all protein concentrations examined, up to 0.1 mm (the higher protein concentrations were monitored at 250 nm; not shown). To investigate the hydrodynamic properties of AHSP further, we performed a series of sedimentation velocity experiments to measure the sedimentation coefficient (s) of AHSP (Fig. 2 B). The model that best fitted the experimental data incorporated a non-interacting single species with M r,app = 11,800 ± 460 Da (n = 14) and a sedimentation coefficient, extrapolated to infinite dilution ( s 20,w0), of 1.52 S (Fig. 2 B). This result is in close agreement with the mass determined from equilibrium experiments and with a theoretical mass of 11,986 Da for the monomeric protein. Calculation of s for a theoretical sphere of the same mass yielded values in the range 1.86 ≥ s ≥ 1.58, depending upon the level of hydration (ranging from anhydrous to hydration at 0.41 g of H2O per 1 g of protein based on amino acid composition (22Kuntz I.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1971; 93: 514-516Google Scholar)). Hence, our data are consistent with AHSP assuming a globular fold, but, because the rate of sedimentation observed was slower than predicted by a spherical model, we suggest that AHSP may have a slightly elongated shape, consistent with the behavior of the molecule by gel filtration. A similar analysis of CO-liganded α-globin indicated that it is also monomeric in solution (Fig. 3). Some small systematic deviations between the non-interacting monomer model and the experimental data were observed (Fig. 3 A, residuals), but introducing either self-association or non-ideality into the model could not reduce these deviations. One possibility is that small amounts of oxidized material form aggregates during the course of the experiment, although the majority of α-globin was in the CO-liganded form as judged by spectrophotometric measurements in the region 540–550 nm (not shown). Given the small magnitude of the residuals, we propose that the monomer model is valid. Sedimentation velocity experiments yielded a value fors 20,w of 1.97 S (Fig. 3 B). As before, s was calculated for a theoretical sphere of the same mass and yielded values in the range 2.09 ≥s ≥ 1.64 (ranging from anhydrous to hydration at 3.9 g of H2O per 1 g of protein). These values suggest that α-globin is rather spherical, in accordance with the gel filtration data. Note that the possible effects of the heme prosthetic group were ignored for the purposes of this analysis. Taken together, the results from gel filtration and sedimentation analysis indicate that purified AHSP and α-globin are both monomers in solution, but that AHSP is probably more elongated than α-globin. To examine the AHSP·α-globin complex in detail, we titrated AHSP into a solution of α-globin and monitored the formation of complex by gel filtration chromatography (Fig.4 A). These experiments showed that the interaction between AHSP and α-globin is sufficiently tight that, when mixed together, free monomers only occur in measurable quantities when one of the two proteins is in excess, even at protein concentrations below 10 μm (suggesting aK A > 106m−1 for formation of the complex). Upon addition of 1 molar equivalent of AHSP to a sample of α-globin, a single species eluted from the gel filtration column with an apparent molecular size of ∼30 kDa, suggesting the formation of a heterodimeric AHSP·α-globin complex. To confirm the stoichiometry, gel filtration fractions corresponding to the AHSP·α-globin complex were collected and subject to amino acid analysis. This method does not rely on estimates of protein concentration derived from optical absorbance measurements and, therefore, provides an independent measurement of subunit concentrations in the complex. The experimentally derived amino acid composition was compared with values calculated for theoretical AHSP·α-globin complexes of 1:1, 2:1, and 1:2 subunit stoichiometry. Analysis of the relative levels of amino acids characteristic of either AHSP or α-globin indicated a 1:1 subunit stoichiometry for the complex (Fig. 4 B). Global analysis of the data by determination of Σresiduals2between observed and calculated amounts of every residue gave values of 0.8, 8.5, and 9.8 for the 1:1, 2:1, and 1:2 models, respectively, confirming the 1:1 model to be the best fit. Samples of AHSP and α-globin alone were also analyzed, and the expected amino acid compositions were confirmed. In summary, all the data indicate the AHSP·α-globin complex is a heterodimer. We next used isothermal titration calorimetry to measure thermodynamic parameters for the AHSP·α-globin interaction. Fig.5 shows that formation of the complex is exothermic, and the data fitted well to a simple 1:1 binding model (Fig. 5, lower panel) with ΔH = 8.75 ± 0.07 kcal mol−1 and K A = 1.0 × 107m−1 at 20 °C. We note that this interaction affinity is greater than that observed for the α1β1 (dimer) ↔ α1β1·α2β2(tetramer) equilibrium state of fully oxygenated hemoglobin. Hence, AHSP binding could have consequences for oxygen transport if it contacted the residues of α-globin that mediate this dimer ↔ tetramer association (i.e. those residues at the α1β2 interface). To investigate this possibility, w"

The substrate specificity of the ubiquinone cofactor ( CoQn) that is required for the oxidation of FMN in the second step of the reaction was also determined.

All five compounds were poor inhibitors of the malarial enzyme, with IC50's ranging from 0.1–1.0 mm. The IC50 values for inhibition of the malarial enzyme are 102-104-fold higher than the values reported for the mammalian enzyme, demonstrating that inhibitor binding to DHODH is species specific.

Currently, several medicinal therapies are available for use as prophylaxis and treatment for at-risk or infected individuals. However, widespread drug resistance against these agents (e.g. chloroquine (3Wellems T. Plowe C. J. Infect. Dis. 2001; 184: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar), atovaquone (4Srivastava I. Morrisey J. Darrouzet E. Daldal F. Vaidya A. Mol.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3807-3815Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar)), has compromised the effectiveness of these treatments resulting in the pressing need for the development of new anti-malarial compounds. The identification of targets that exploit the unique biology of the parasite is an essential step in the development of new therapeutics. Pyrimidines are essential metabolites in all cells. They are required not only for DNA and RNA biosynthesis, but also for the biosynthesis of phospholipids and glycoproteins. The de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway is intact in most organisms, includingPlasmodium (7Reyes P. Rathod P. Sanchez D. Mrema J. Rieckmann K. Heidrich H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1982; 5: 275-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 8Wang C. Aldritt S. J. Exp. Med. 1983; 158: 1703-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 9Hammond D. Gutteridge W. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1984; 13: 243-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). However, unlike mammalian cells, the human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, cannot salvage preformed pyrimidine bases or nucleosides and utilizes de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis exclusively to meet its metabolic requirements (7Reyes P. Rathod P. Sanchez D. Mrema J. Rieckmann K. Heidrich H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1982; 5: 275-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 10Sherman I. Microbiol.

Blood Cells. 1990; 16: 467-484PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway to the survival of the malarial parasite is demonstrated by the finding that dihydrofolate reductase is a validated target for the treatment of the parasite (13White N. Br. Med. Bull. 1998; 54: 703-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a number of inhibitors directed at thymidylate synthetase, such as 5-fluoroorotate (5-FO),1 have nanomolar anti-malarial activity in vitro and cure malaria without toxicity in vivo (14Rathod P. Khatri A. Hubbert T. Milhous W. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1989; 33: 1090-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 15Rathod P. Leffers N. Young R. Antimicrob.

Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 1047-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). As expected from the inability of the parasite to use nucleosides, the antiproliferative effects of thymidylate synthetase inhibitors on the malarial parasite cannot be reversed by thymidine, whereas mammalian cells cultured in the presence of thymidine were resistant to these inhibitors (16Rathod P. Reshmi S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 476-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 17Jiang L. Lee P. White J. Rathod P. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 1047-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that additional enzymes in the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway should be studied for their potential as drug targets in the malarial parasite. Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) catalyzes the fourth step in the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway. In human cells, DHODH is localized in the mitochondria and is the rate-limiting enzyme in UMP formation (18Jones M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 253-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Although human cells can both salvage and synthesize pyrimidinesde novo, activated T- and B-lymphocytes require de novo synthesis. A potent inhibitor of human DHODH (A77 1726) has been shown to be the active metabolite of a recently approved treatment for rheumatoid arthritis (leflunomide, Arava®), and strong evidence has been reported that the mechanism of action of leflunomide is inhibition of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis in these cells (19Goldenberg M.

In addition to A77 1726, a number of high affinity inhibitors of human DHODH have been reported along with extensive structure-activity analysis (22Batt D. Petraitis J. Sherk S. Copeland R.

Furthermore, high affinity inhibitors of Helicobacter pylori DHODH and theEscherichia coli enzyme have also been described that display considerable species selectivity (26Copeland R. Mareinkeviciene J. Haque T. Kopcho L. Jiang W. Wang K. Ecret L. Sizemore C. Amsler K. Foster L. Tadesse S. Combs A. Stern A. Trainor G. Slee A. Rogers M. Hobbs F. J. Biol.

Thus, the known species differences in DHODH inhibitor binding, and the established clinical pharmacology of DHODH inhibitors in humans, suggest that selective DHODH inhibitors may also be developed for malaria chemotherapy. DHODH catalyzes the oxidation of dihydroorotate to orotate utilizing the flavin cofactor FMN in the first of two half reactions (SchemeFS1). In the second step, the enzyme catalyzes the re-oxidation of FMNH2 using one of several cofactors. Two forms of DHODH have been described, cytoplasmic and membrane-bound (28Nara T. Hshimoto T. Aoki T. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 257: 209-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic enzymes utilize fumarate or NAD+ to oxidize FMNH2, whereas the membrane-bound enzymes, which are mitochondrial in eukaryotes, require respiratory quinones as their physiological oxidant (18Jones M.

A. 1992; 89: 8966-8970Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Mammals, plants, and most Gram-negative bacteria have membrane-bound enzymes. There are, however, no unifying rules. Although some yeast, eubacteria, and protozoa utilize fumarate or NAD+, others require respiratory quinones (28Nara T. Hshimoto T. Aoki T. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 257: 209-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of the malarial DHODH gene (Fig. 1) demonstrates that it belongs to the mitochondrial-type enzymes (28Nara T. Hshimoto T. Aoki T. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 257: 209-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The enzyme has also been localized to the mitochondria by studies in parasites (30Krungkrai J. Biochim. Biophys.

Sequences were taken from GenBankTM. The sequence of the malarial DHODH gene was previously reported (42LeBlanc S. Wilson C. Mol. Biochem.

Neidhardt E. Grossman T. Ocain T. Clardy J. Structure. 1999; 8: 25-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (274) Google Scholar) in complex with orotate and FMN, plus the anti-inflammatory compounds brequinar and A77 1726 (the active metabolite of leflunomide). The enzyme is a β/α barrel, and the orotate and FMN stack against each other in the center of the barrel. Brequinar and A77 1726 are thought to bind to the ubiquinone binding site. Consistent with this model, brequinar is a competitive inhibitor of ubiquinone, however, the kinetics of A77 1726 are more complex (33McLean J. Neidhardt E. Grossman T. Hedstrom L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2194-2200Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In the x-ray structure, the inhibitors bind in a channel between two α-helices at the N terminus of the molecule that extend away from the β/α domain (Fig. 2). This slot forms the entrance to a tunnel that ends at FMN, and presumably extends from the membrane allowing ubiquinone to diffuse into the site during the catalytic cycle. This binding pocket is present only in enzymes of the mitochondrial type. Biochemical characterization of malarial DHODH has been limited to the study of partially purified enzyme preparations from cultured parasite cells, in which detailed characterization of the enzyme was limited by both purity and quantity of the preparation (30Krungkrai J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1243: 351-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 31Krungkrai J. Cerami A. Henderson G. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1934-1939Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In this study the truncated soluble form of DHODH from P. falciparum has been overexpressed in E. coli and purified to near homogeneity. The biochemical properties of the recombinant DHODH were examined to determine pH dependence, substrate specificity, and inhibition profiles for a series of compounds that are effective against the human enzyme. l-DHO, 5-FO, FMN, CoQ0, CoQD(decylubiquinone), CoQ4, CoQ6, vitamin K3, DCIP, and all other reagents, unless noted otherwise, were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). Dichloroallyl lawsone (NCI, National Institutes of Health no. 126771) and Redoxal (NCI/NIH no. 73735) were obtained from the NCI/NIH Developmental Therapeutics Program. The “RIG” plasmid was provided by W. G. J. Hol, University of Washington, Seattle, WA. The polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify a truncated segment of the pyrDgene from P. falciparum strain C2B genomic DNA encoding the enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase. Primers 1 (CCTGAATTTTTTTCCATGGATATATTTTTAAAATTC) and 2 (CACTTATGTGTCGACCGTGTTTAATTAACTTTTGC), which introduceNcoI and SalI restriction sites, respectively (shown in boldface), were used to generate a 1244-bp DNA fragment. The PCR product was ligated into the pProEX HTa prokaryotic expression vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) that produces protein fused to an N terminus His6 sequence. The cloned gene was sequenced to verify that no unintentional mutations were introduced. The 42-amino acid insert unique to P. falciparum was verified by PCR amplification of a pyrD gene fragment encoding this region using the cDNA library from strainDd2 (MR4/ATCC, Manassas, VA). Primers 3 (GGAAGATACGCTGATTATATAGC) and 2 were used to amplify a fragment of ∼750 bp that was directly ligated into ZeroBlunt TOPO vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The cloned pyrD fragment was sequenced with the M13/reverse primer following amplification and purification of plasmid DNA. Chemically competent E. coli DH5α cells were cotransformed with the His6-DHODH expression vector and the RIG plasmid that encodes the rare tRNAs encoding Arg, Ile, and Gly residues (34Baca A. Hol W. Int. J. Parasitol. 2000; 30: 112-118Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The overexpressed enzyme of ∼45-kDa molecular mass lacks 168 amino acids from the N terminus thereby removing the hydrophobic membrane-associated domain (Fig. 1). Cells were grown in LB medium to an A 600 nm of 0.5, supplemented with 0.1 mm flavin mononucleotide and induced with 0.6 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Fisher Scientific, Fair Lawn, NJ) and harvested by centrifugation 3 h after induction, followed by freezing in liquid nitrogen. Typically, 5 g of cell paste was obtained per liter of liquid culture. Frozen cell paste was resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mmTris, pH 8.5, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm FMN, and 10% glycerol) at a ratio of 5 ml per gram of cells. A protease inhibitor mixture consisting of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (200 μm), leupeptin (1 μg/ml), antipain (2 μg/ml), benzamidine (10 μg/ml), pepstatin (1 μg/ml), and chymostatin (1 μg/ml) was added to the final concentrations indicated. Lysozyme was added to a final concentration of 0.1% (w/v) and incubated for 2 h on ice. The mixture was frozen in liquid nitrogen, thawed, and then sonicated for 2 min. The lysate was centrifuged for 30 min at 85,000 × g. The supernatant recovered by centrifugation was loaded onto 10 ml of nickel agarose resin (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) equilibrated with buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 20 mm imidazole, 0.1 mm FMN, and 10% glycerol). The column was washed with ten volumes of buffer A, followed by elution of bound protein with buffer B (50 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 300 mm imidazole, 0.1 mm FMN, and 10% glycerol). The eluted material was concentrated to ∼1 ml with a Centri-Prep 10 ultrafiltration device (Amicon Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) and applied to a Hi-Load 16/60 gel filtration column packed with Superdex 200 resin (AmershamBiosciences, Piscataway, NJ) equilibrated with 100 mmHEPES, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol. The flow rate was maintained at 0.5 ml/min, and 3-ml fraction sizes were collected. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (35Laemmli U. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) for purity, and the appropriate fractions were pooled and concentrated as described previously. Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay with bovine serum albumin as a standard (36Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). The yield of purified protein is generally 1.5–2 mg per gram of cell paste for the 45-kDa DHODH. All measurements were performed on enzyme preparations containing the His6 tag, except where noted. In such cases, the tagged enzyme was incubated with TEV-protease immobilized on glutathione-agarose overnight at 4 °C as described (37Grishin N. Osterman A. Goldsmith E. Phillips M. Proteins. 1996; 24: 272-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). DHODH was eluted from the reduced glutathione beads, and the fraction of enzyme with the His6 tag remaining was removed by additional chromatography on Ni2+-agarose resin. The gene encoding an N-terminal truncation of human DHODH (Met30-Arg396) was amplified from a cDNA library derived from human pituitary gland (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) by PCR using primers hD1 (GCCTCCTACCATATGGCCACGGGAG) and hD2 (ACGCTGGAATTCCTCCGATGATCTGCTCC), which introduceNdeI and EcoRI restriction sites, respectively. The 1125-bp PCR product was ligated into pCR-Blunt II-TOPO vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Recombinant plasmids were digested withNdeI and EcoRI restriction enzymes and separated by electrophoresis. The PCR product was extracted using a gel purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and ligated into a similarly restricted and purified pET22b (Novagen, Madison, WI) protein overexpression vector to generate a construct with a His6C-terminal tag. This construct is similar to previously described expression constructs for truncated human DHODH (33McLean J. Neidhardt E. Grossman T. Hedstrom L.

Transformed BL21(DE3) cells were grown at 37 °C in rich LB medium (35 g of Tryptone, 20 g of yeast extract, 5 g of NaCl, and 10% glycerol per liter) to an A 600 nm of 0.6, and 100 μm FMN was added followed by 200 μmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were harvested after 4 h of growth at 30 °C. All other details of the purification are identical to the procedure for isolation ofpfDHODH outlined above. Approximately 2 mg of purified hDHODH was obtained per liter of medium. Steady-state measurements to determine the pH dependence of enzyme activity were performed by varying the l-DHO concentration (5–500 μm) and measuring the reduction of 2,6-dichloroindophenol (DCIP) at 600 nm (ε = 18.8 mm−1cm−1) as described (38Miller R. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 51: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The pH range of the reaction was varied by employing the following buffers (100 mm): MES, pH 6–7; HEPES, pH 7–8; and Tris, pH 8–8.5. DCIP was added to a final concentration of 60 μmin the buffer indicated above at saturating QD (100 μm). Inhibition studies on 5-FO and IC50 data (Table II) were also performed with this assay. Reactions were initiated by addition of enzyme to a final concentration of 5–50 nm, and the temperature was maintained at 25 °C with a circulating water bath.Table ISubstrate specificity of pfDHODH for the ubiquinone cofactorFixed substrateVaried co-substratek catK mapps−1μml-DHOQ01.8 ± 0.15114 ± 17l-DHOVitamin K32.0 ± 0.2856 ± 18l-DHOQ42.0 ± 0.0621 ± 2l-DHOQ62.0 ± 0.3015 ± 1l-DHOQD2.0 ± 0.1016 ± 1Q4l-DHO1.8 ± 0.0635 ± 4Q6l-DHO2.0 ± 0.0362 ± 3QDl-DHO1.8 ± 0.0832 ± 6Errors represent the standard error of the fit.

Compound structures are displayed in SchemeFS2. For analysis of the CoQ substrate specificity and inhibition patterns by DCL, Redoxal, and CCHNP, formation of l-orotate was measured by the direct assay (39Hines V. Keys L. Johnston M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11386-11392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with a Beckman DU-650 spectrophotometer. The form of the enzyme used in these studies lacked the N-terminal histidine tag. For inhibitor studies decylubiquinone (ε = 4.3 mm−1 cm−1) was used as the cosubstrate, and assays were performed at 296 nm. For quinone specificity determinations, the CoQ concentration was varied (1–150 μm) and the production of orotic acid was measured at 287 nm (ε = 6.04 mm−1cm−1) for CoQ0, 293 nm for CoQ4/6 (ε = 4.7 mm−1cm−1), and 282 nm (ε = 6.6 mm−1cm−1) for vitamin K3. Assays were performed in buffer containing 100 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol. l-DHO and CoQ were added as 100× stocks to the final concentrations. For inhibition studies, DCL (NCI no. 126771) and Redoxal (NCI no. 73735) were dissolved in Me2SO as 100× stocks to determine IC50values. CCHNP, Redoxal, and DCL inhibition patterns were determined by separately varying l-DHO (5–500 μm) and CoQD (20–200 μm) concentrations. The synthesis and testing of the A77 1726 derivatives as inhibitors of mammalian DHODH has been previously described (24Kuo E. Hambleton P. Kay D. Evans P. Matharu S. Little E. McDowall N. Jones C.

Reactions were initiated by addition of enzyme to a final concentration of 5–50 nm, and the temperature was maintained at 25 °C with a circulating water bath. SigmaPlot 2001 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) was used for graphing and calculation of the kinetic constants by non-linear regression of the data using the Michaelis-Menten equation and variations thereof describing competitive (Equation 1), non-competitive (Equation 2), and uncompetitive inhibition (Equation 3) as well as for analysis of the pH dependence (Equation 4), v=Vmax[S][S]+Kmapp1+[I]KIappEquation 1 v=Vmax[S]([S]+Kmapp)1+[I]KIappEquation 2 v=Vmax[S][S]1+[I]KIapp+KmappEquation 3 kcat=kmax1+10pKa−pH+10pH−pKbEquation 4 The derivatives of A77 1726 were synthesized in two steps as described (24Kuo E.

In step one the respective para-substituted aniline (SchemeFS2, R = NO2, CF3, or CN) was condensed with cyanoacetic acid to form the corresponding cyanoacetamide. In step 2, the product of this reaction was acylated with cyclopropanecarbonyl chloride to form the corresponding β-hydroxy enamide. The three resulting compounds (CCHNP, R = NO2; CCHTFP, R= CF3; CCHCP, R = CN, numbered 49, 17, and 38, respectively, in the original publication (24Kuo E. Hambleton P. Kay D. Evans P. Matharu S.

The identity of each compound was verified by liquid chromatography-MS, MS-MS, IR, and NMR analysis. Malarial DHODH has a significantly longer N-terminal sequence (129 amino acids) than the human enzyme (Fig. 1). The N-terminal sequence contains the membrane-binding domain, which localizes the enzyme to the mitochondria. Soluble overexpression of human DHODH was achieved by truncating 30 amino acids from the N-terminal membrane anchor (40Copeland R. Davis J. Dowling R. Lombardo D. Murphy K. Patterson T. Arch.

We transfected a series of hemagglutinin epitope-tagged eNOS mutant cDNAs deficient in palmitoylation (palm−) and/or myristoylation (myr−) into bovine aortic endothelial cells; after treatment with the eNOS agonists sphingosine 1-phosphate or vascular endothelial growth factor, the recombinant eNOS was immunoprecipitated using an antibody directed against the epitope tag, and patterns of eNOS phosphorylation were analyzed in immunoblots probed with phosphorylation state-specific eNOS antibodies. The wild-type eNOS underwent agonist-induced phosphorylation at serine 1179 (a putative site for phosphorylation by kinase Akt), but phosphorylation of the myr− eNOS at this residue was nearly abrogated; the palm− eNOS exhibited an intermediate phenotype. The addition of the CD8 transmembrane domain to the amino terminus of eNOS acylation-deficient mutants rescued the wild-type phenotype of robust agonist-induced serine 1179 phosphorylation. Thus, membrane targeting, but not necessarily acylation, is the critical determinant for agonist-promoted eNOS phosphorylation at serine 1179. In striking contrast to serine 1179, phosphorylation of eNOS at serine 116 was enhanced in the myr− eNOS mutant and was markedly attenuated in the CD8-eNOS membrane-targeted fusion protein.

In vascular endothelial cells and in cardiac myocytes, eNOS is targeted to signal-transducing microdomains in the plasma membrane termed caveolae, where eNOS interacts with the scaffolding protein caveolin (for review, see Ref. 3Michel T. Feron O. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2146-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). Plasmalemmal caveolae serve as membrane sites of sequestration of signaling proteins including receptors, G proteins, and protein kinases as well as eNOS (for review, see Ref. 4Shaul P.W. Anderson R.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L843-L851PubMed Google Scholar). The targeting of eNOS to the membrane is mediated by dual acylation, an irreversible N-myristoylation at Gly2, and reversible thiopalmitoylation at Cys15 and Cys26 (5Robinson L.J. Michel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11776-11780Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of the eNOS myristoylation site blocks both myristoylation and palmitoylation and converts the membrane-targeted wild-type eNOS to a soluble protein; the myr− mutant is recovered in the soluble subcellular fraction when expressed in cells (6Robinson L.J.

The addition of a prototypical transmembrane domain to the myr− eNOS is sufficient to promote eNOS palmitoylation as well as targeting to caveolae (8Prabhakar P. Cheng V. Michel T. J. Biol.

Taken together, these results suggest that the caveolar location and functionality of eNOS are determined by structural features of the eNOS molecule that are distinct from the enzyme sites of acylation (10Feron O.

The pathways involved in agonist-specific modulation of these distinct phosphorylation sites remain under active investigation, and the inter-relationships between eNOS acylation and phosphorylation are incompletely understood. In the present study, we have analyzed the role of eNOS targeting in the regulation of enzyme phosphorylation. We studied the phosphorylation patterns of a series of hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged eNOS acylation mutants in which the myristoylation and/or palmitoylation sites had been inactivated by site-directed mutagenesis. We analyzed these constructs in transient transfection experiments performed in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC), thereby avoiding the potential confounding effects of cell-specific phosphorylation pathways. To distinguish the recombinant eNOS constructs from the native enzyme expressed in BAEC, we immunoprecipitated the recombinant protein using an antibody against the HA epitope tag. Using a series of phosphorylation state-specific antibodies, we were able to show that distinct eNOS phosphorylation sites are differentially affected by altering the subcellular targeting of the protein.

Chimeric cDNA constructs encoding the fusion proteins CD8.myr− eNOS and CD8.myr− palm− eNOS have also been described (8Prabhakar P. Cheng V. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19416-19421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The HA epitope tag was added to these various CD8.eNOS chimeras by interchanging the untagged 3′-terminal 1.5 kilobases of these constructs with the corresponding HA epitope-tagged eNOS cDNA, taking advantage of a propitious BglII restriction site. For cell imaging studies, we constructed a series of eNOS fusion proteins with the fluorescent protein EGFP; our preliminary studies had revealed that the constructs tagged with the HA epitope yielded a signal-to-noise ratio that was insufficient for high resolution fluorescence imaging. The plasmid encoding the eNOS-EGFP fusion protein was made by cloning the cDNA encoding the sequence of bovine wild-type eNOS into the mammalian expression vector pEGFP-N1 (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) after first modifying the stop codon at the 3′ end of the eNOS sequence by using PCR-based mutagenesis to generate a BamHI restriction site; the stop codon was then used to clone the eNOS sequence in-frame with the EGFP sequence. To produce palm−eNOS-EGFP, CD8.myr− eNOS-EGFP, and CD8.myr− palm− eNOS-EGFP, these cDNAs were digested with EcoRI and KpnI, and the 5′ fragment was use to replace the corresponding region in the wild-type eNOS-EGFP plasmid that had been similarly digested to release the corresponding 5′ fragment. To construct myr−eNOS-EGFP, the CD8.myr− eNOS was first digested with ClaI, blunted with mung bean nuclease, and digested with KpnI; this cDNA fragment was subcloned into eNOS-EGFP that had been first digested with NheI, blunted with mung bean nuclease, and digested with KpnI to release the 5′ fragment that was then replaced by the myr−sequence. Bovine aortic endothelial cells were obtained from Cell Systems (Kirkland, WA) and maintained in culture in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum (10% v/v) as described (12Michel T., Li, G.T. Busconi L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6252-6256Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Cells were plated onto gelatin-coated culture dishes and studied before cell confluence between passages 5 and 9. BAEC in 60-mm dishes were transfected with plasmids encoding wild-type eNOS, eNOS mutants, and chimeric constructs using FuGENE 6 (following the supplier's instructions) and were analyzed 48 h after transfection. The culture medium was changed to serum-free medium, and incubation proceeded overnight before all experiments were conducted (21Igarashi J. Bernier S.G. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12420-12426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 27Lee H. Goetzl E.J. An S. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2000; 278: 612-618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); transfection frequency using these conditions was ∼35%. S1P was solubilized in methanol and stored at −20 °C; the same volume of methanol was used as vehicle control, and the final concentration of methanol did not exceed 0.4% (v/v). VEGF was solubilized in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and stored at −70 °C. Wortmannin was solubilized in dimethyl sulfoxide and kept at −20 °C; where indicated dimethyl sulfoxide 0.1% (v/v) was used as vehicle control. After drug treatments, BAEC were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 10 min in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml antipain, 2 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 2 μg/ml lima trypsin inhibitor). Cells were harvested by scraping and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. For immunoprecipitation, aliquots of cell homogenates were incubated with 12CA5 monoclonal antibody against the HA epitope (4 μg/ml) for 1 h at 4 °C. Protein G-Sepharose beads were added to the supernatant, incubated for 1 h, and washed extensively with lysis buffer. Bound immune complexes were eluted by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE on 7.5% gels, and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Immunoblots were probed with phospho-Ser1179-eNOS, phospho-Ser116-eNOS, eNOS, and HA epitope antibodies using protocols provided by the suppliers. For immunoblot analyses of cell lysates, 20 μg of cellular protein were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and analyzed with phospho-Akt and Akt antibodies. Densitometric analyses of the immunoblots were performed using a ChemiImager 4000 (Alpha-Innotech). BAEC transfected with HA-tagged wild-type eNOS and myr− eNOS were harvested, lysed, and immunoprecipitated with anti-HA monoclonal antibody as described above. The immune complexes were isolated with protein G-Sepharose and incubated with active recombinant Akt (0.1–0.5 μg) in phosphorylation assay buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 25 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol) at 30 °C for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 2× Laemmli sample buffer. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with the phospho-Ser1179-eNOS antibody. BAEC grown on coverslips were transfected at 50–60% confluency with plasmids encoding EGFP fusion constructs using FuGENE 6 reagent then incubated for 24 h to allow protein expression. The transfected cells were fixed using a 3.7% formaldehyde solution in phosphate-buffered saline and mounted on microscope slides with SlowFade® antifade kit (Molecular Probes, Inc.). Samples were imaged using a 60× differential interference contrast oil immersion objective lens on a Nikon E800 upright microscope with a Bio-Rad Radiance 2000 confocal attachment. Images are shown as single optical slices in the z axis. We first studied the role of eNOS acyl modifications on agonist-induced eNOS phosphorylation at serine 1179, the putative site for agonist-modulated enzyme phosphorylation by kinase Akt (13Gallis B.

BAEC were transfected with cDNA encoding wild-type eNOS, myr− eNOS, or palm− eNOS, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cells were treated with S1P (100 nm) or VEGF (1 nm) for 5 min, and the recombinant proteins were immunoprecipitated with the anti-HA epitope antibody. eNOS phosphorylation at serine 1179 was analyzed in immunoblots probed with a phospho-specific antibody. As shown in Fig.1, wild-type eNOS was robustly phosphorylated at serine 1179 in response to S1P and VEGF stimulation. However, S1P-induced serine 1179 phosphorylation of the myr− eNOS was completely abrogated, whereas the response to VEGF was reduced by 91 ± 3% (n = 3,p < 0.01) in the myr− eNOS. An intermediate phenotype was found for the palm− eNOS: S1P-induced serine 1179 phosphorylation was reduced by 72 ± 7% (n = 3, p < 0.01), and there was a 30 ± 9% decrease (n = 3, p < 0.05) in the serine 1179 phosphorylation in response to VEGF. We next analyzed the time course and dose response for S1P- and VEGF-induced serine 1179 phosphorylation in wild-type and myr− eNOS. As seen in Fig.2, both agonists stimulated a dose-dependent increase in serine 1179 eNOS phosphorylation of the wild-type enzyme, with EC50 values of 10 nm and 0.01 nm for S1P and VEGF, respectively. The phosphorylation of myr− eNOS at serine 1179 was attenuated even at the highest agonist doses (Fig. 2). As shown in Fig.3, S1P and VEGF exhibited a similar time course for agonist-induced phosphorylation of wild-type eNOS at serine 1179, but the myr− eNOS showed markedly attenuated phosphorylation at all time points in response to these agonists. As shown in Figs. 2 and 3, agonist-induced phosphorylation of kinase Akt was unaffected by transfection of the different eNOS constructs; loading controls showed equivalent levels of protein expression under these different experimental conditions. We next used purified kinase Akt to explore whether there was an intrinsic difference between the wild-type and myr− eNOS in their suitability as a substrate for this kinase. As shown in Fig.4, both the wild-type and myr− eNOS served as effective substrates for in vitro phosphorylation by kinase Akt, with identical dose responses and time courses of Akt-induced phosphorylation. The control experiments shown in Fig. 4 established the specificity both of the phosphoserine 1179 antibody as well as the immunoprecipitation of recombinant eNOS using the HA epitope tag; for the S1179A eNOS mutant, in which the putative Akt phosphorylation site at serine 1179 was changed to alanine, there was no phosphorylation whatsoever when this immunoprecipitated mutant eNOS was incubated with purified kinase Akt.Figure 3Time course of S1P - and VEGF-induced serine 1179 phosphorylation in wild-type and acylation-deficient eNOS. BAEC transfected with cDNA encoding wild-type (WT) eNOS and myr− eNOS were treated with S1P (100 nm,upper panel) or VEGF (1 nm, lower panel) for the indicated times. Recombinant proteins were immunoprecipitated with the anti-HA epitope antibody, and the immune complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed in immunoblots probed with phospho-Ser1179-eNOS and anti-HA epitope polyclonal antibody, as noted. In parallel, cell lysates (20 μg/line) were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with phospho-Akt and Akt antibodies. These experiments were repeated three times with equivalent results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 4In vitro phosphorylation of wild-type and acylation-deficient eNOS by kinase Akt. BAEC transfected with wild-type (WT) eNOS, myr−eNOS, and S1179AeNOS were lysed, and recombinant eNOS was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA epitope antibody and analyzed in a kinase activity assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In panel A, immunoprecipitates were incubated with the indicated amounts of purified recombinant active Akt for 10 min, and the reaction mixture was resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with phospho-Ser1179-eNOS antibody. Equal loading of samples was confirmed by re-probing the immunoblots with eNOS antibody. These experiments were repeated twice with equivalent results. Panel B shows the time course for in vitro phosphorylation of wild-type eNOS and myr− eNOS by Akt. Wild-type eNOS and myr− eNOS immunoprecipitated with anti-HA epitope antibody from BAEC lysates were incubated with 0.25 μg of recombinant Akt for the indicated times.

Cheng V. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19416-19421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We have previously used biochemical approaches to explore features of the acylation and targeting of these chimeras (8Prabhakar P. Cheng V. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19416-19421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.5, we used here cellular imaging methodologies to further characterize the subcellular distribution of these CD8.eNOS chimeras by first fusing these constructs at their carboxyl termini to the green fluorescent protein EGFP and then performing laser scanning confocal microscopy on BAEC transfected with these plasmids. The subcellular distribution of these various EGFP-tagged eNOS constructs, wild-type eNOS (panel A), myr− mutant eNOS (panel B), palm−mutant eNOS (panel C), or the CD8 fusion constructs ligated to myr− eNOS (panel D) or to myr−palm− mutant eNOS (panel E), revealed distinctive patterns (Fig. 5). The wild-type eNOS-EGFP fusion protein targeted to peripheral as well as intracellular membranes. By contrast, the myr−-EGFP fusion protein showed a diffuse intracellular pattern, consistent with prior reports that used biochemical (7Busconi L. Michel T. J. Biol.

The palmitoylation-deficient eNOS-EGFP fusion protein had a pattern of intracellular distribution similar to the wild type, but there was less uniform staining of the peripheral cell membrane in the palm− mutant enzyme compared with wild-type eNOS (Fig.5 C). The addition of the CD8 transmembrane domain rescued the phenotype of the myr− and palm− mutants, restoring membrane targeting to yield a pattern similar to that of the wild-type eNOS-EGFP protein.

https://openalex.org/W2132697082,"A systematic mutagenesis study of the 10-23 DNA enzyme was performed to analyze the sequence requirements of its catalytic domain. Therefore, each of the 15 core nucleotides was substituted separately by the remaining three naturally occurring nucleotides. Changes at the borders of the catalytic domain led to a dramatic loss of enzymatic activity, whereas several nucleotides in between could be exchanged without severe effects. Thymidine at position 8 had the lowest degree of conservation and its substitution by any of the other three nucleotides caused only a minor loss of activity. In addition to the standard nucleotides (adenosine, guanosine, thymidine, or cytidine) modified nucleotides were used to gain further information about the role of individual functional groups. Again, thymidine at position 8 as well as some other nucleotides could be substituted by inosine without severe effects on the catalytic activity. For two positions, additional experiments with 2-aminopurine and deoxypurine, respectively, were performed to obtain information about the specific role of functional groups. In addition to sequence-function relationships of the DNA enzyme, this study provides information about suitable sites to introduce modified nucleotides for further functional studies or for internal stabilization of the DNA enzyme against endonucleolytic attack."

https://openalex.org/W1980881069,"To elucidate the mechanism of αA-crystallin chaperone function, a detailed thermodynamic analysis of its binding to destabilized, site-directed mutants of T4 lysozyme was carried out. The selected mutants form a ladder of stabilities spanning the 5–10 kcal/mol range of free energy of unfolding. The crystal structures of the majority of the mutants have been previously determined and found to be similar to that of the wild type with no evidence of static local unfolding. Complex formation between αA-crystallin and T4 lysozyme was observed directly via the changes in the electron paramagnetic resonance lineshape of a nitroxide introduced at a non-destabilizing, solvent exposed site in T4 lysozyme. αA-Crystallin differentially interacts with the mutants, binding the more destabilized ones to a larger extent despite the similar structure of their native states. Our results suggest that the states recognized by αA-crystallin are non-native excited states distinct from the unfolded state. Stable complexes are formed when the free energy of binding to αA-crystallin is on the order of the free energy associated with the transition from the excited state to the native state. Biphasic binding isotherms reveal two modes of interactions with distinct affinities and stoichiometries. Highly destabilized mutants preferentially bind to the high capacity mode, suggesting conformational preference in the use of each mode.

In the crowded molecular environment of the cell, protein folding, stability, and solubility are critically dependent on a specialized protein machinery consisting of multiple superfamilies of heat shock proteins, the molecular chaperones. By recognizing and binding non-native protein states, chaperones protect the cell from the toxic and pathogenic consequences of protein aggregation (1Grantcharova V. Alm E.J. Baker D. Horwich A.L.

These non-native states are not only a byproduct of the folding process but are also populated through fluctuations in the native structure, the rate of which increases under extreme physicochemical conditions. The diversity of the molecular chaperones has been associated with distinct roles at different stages of the protein life cycle and in response to different cellular conditions (3Parsell D.A.

In humans, six sHSP have been identified in various tissues (6Macrae T.H. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 899-913Google Scholar). The α-crystallins are the main protein component in the lens, where they play a critical role in establishing and maintaining its optical properties (11Delaye M. Tardieu A.

It has been hypothesized that α-crystallin chaperone function prevents the early aggregation and precipitation of lens proteins. In non-lenticular tissues, compelling evidence suggests an important role for sHSP in transduction pathways related to cellular growth and differentiation (10Rogalla T. Ehrnsperger M. Preville X.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 483-490Google Scholar).Two functional characteristics distinguish sHSP from other molecular chaperones such as members of the heat shock protein 60 family. The first is a higher capacity in binding non-native proteins. Binding stoichiometry by some sHSP reaches one substrate of equal molecular weight per subunit (13Horwitz J. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 53-60Google Scholar, 22Boelens W.C. De Jong W.W. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1995; 21: 75-80Google Scholar). This is contrasted to the one chain per 14-subunit oligomer of GroEL (2Xu Z. Sigler P.B. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 124: 129-141Google Scholar). The second unique characteristic is the lack of ATP hydrolysis by sHSP, which brings into question the fate of the bound polypeptides. Recent studies indicate that proteins bound to sHSP can be refolded in the presence of ATP-dependent chaperones (23Lee G.J. Roseman A.M. Saibil H.R. Vierling E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 659-671Google Scholar, 24Ehrnsperger M. Graber S. Gaestel M. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 221-229Google Scholar). Unlike the chaperonins, the function of which is to supervise the folding process, the high capacity and absence of energy consumption make sHSP proteins an efficient defense mechanism under stressful conditions that promote the indiscriminate unfolding of cellular proteins and where the use of ATP-dependent chaperones might be wasteful of cell resources (23Lee G.J. Roseman A.M. Saibil H.R. Vierling E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 659-671Google Scholar, 24Ehrnsperger M. Graber S. Gaestel M. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 221-229Google Scholar).The detailed mechanism of sHSP chaperone function is not well understood. Most previous studies relied on assays where the native state of the substrate protein is thermally or chemically destabilized causing aggregation and precipitation. The functional characteristics of a sHSP are inferred from its efficiency in suppressing aggregation, as reflected in the reduction of light scattering by the substrate protein or the partial recovery of function upon the return to permissive temperatures.Despite their convenience and usefulness in establishing some of the basic aspects of the in vitro function of sHSP, aggregation-based assays are inadequate for the thermodynamic and kinetic dissection of the sHSP chaperone function. Because these assays are carried out under non-equilibrium conditions, it is not possible to measure affinities and stoichiometries. Furthermore, the experimental observable, the reduction in light scattering, reflects in part the kinetic competition between self-association of the substrate and the binding to the chaperone (25Farahbakhsh Z.T. Huang Q.L. Ding L.L. Altenbach C. Steinhoff H.J. Horwitz J. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 509-516Google Scholar). This has a confounding effect on the interpretation of the changes in apparent chaperone activity of sHSP mutants and their differential interactions with substrates. In addition, the strongly denaturing conditions used result in a conformationally heterogeneous ensemble of states that is not amenable to structural analysis and may simultaneously destabilize or inactivate the sHSP. The development of a mechanistic model of sHSP chaperone function requires assays that allow the separation of the multiple events that underlie the interaction with non-native substrates. The direct detection of complex formation is a central feature of such assays (25Farahbakhsh Z.T. Huang Q.L. Ding L.L. Altenbach C. Steinhoff H.J. Horwitz J. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 509-516Google Scholar, 26Zhang Y.L. Mchaourab H.S. Huang Q. Horwitz J. Hubell W.L. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: A102Google Scholar).Fundamentally, sHSP should recognize and bind proteins prior to nucleation of aggregation, i.e. should detect the increased excursion of destabilized proteins toward the aggregation-prone non-native states. This implies that binding can be induced by a progressive reduction in the folding equilibrium constant of a particular substrate until a stable complex is formed. Such incremental changes in protein stability can be achieved by site-directed mutagenesis. The advantage of this approach is that the substrate itself remains predominantly in the native state. Furthermore, the free energy of folding of the mutants can be characterized as a function of physicochemical variables such as pH and temperature and correlated with changes in the binding to the chaperone.This study uses this approach to gain insight into the mechanism of αA-crystallin chaperone function using T4 lysozyme as a substrate. A set of mutants spanning the 5–10 kcal/mol range of free energy of unfolding, ΔG unf, was constructed. Binding to αA-crystallin was detected using a nitroxide spin label introduced on the solvent-exposed surface of the substrate (25Farahbakhsh Z.T. Huang Q.L. Ding L.L. Altenbach C. Steinhoff H.J. Horwitz J. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 509-516Google Scholar, 26Zhang Y.L. Mchaourab H.S. Huang Q. Horwitz J. Hubell W.L. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: A102Google Scholar). αA-Crystallin binds T4L mutants using two modes having different affinities and stoichiometries. The two modes have distinct energetic thresholds for binding and may be associated with the recognition of different conformational states of T4L. These results are discussed in the context of the coupling between the dynamics of the oligomeric structure and the chaperone function in sHSP. The knowledge of the structure and folding of the T4L variants provides new insight into the recognition and binding events and the energetics associated with them.DISCUSSIONOne of the mechanisms of protein aggregation involves the increase in the equilibrium population of non-native states, including the globally unfolded state, characterized by exposed hydrophobic surfaces. These on or off folding pathways intermediate states are populated as a consequence of the finite value of the equilibrium constants that characterize their interconversion with the native state. To be effective, molecular chaperones should detect the increased population of these states prior to the nucleation of aggregation. The recognition and binding either targets these proteins for turnover or allows their refolding.Similar to other heat shock proteins, sHSP recognize and bind non-native protein states. Although the binding of ATP to sHSP has been reported (36Muchowski P.J., Wu, G.J. Liang J.J. Adman E.T. Clark J.I. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 397-411Google Scholar, 37Wang K. Spector A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 6335-6345Google Scholar), there is no evidence for an energy consumption step in the chaperone mechanism of sHSP. These functional characteristics have been established in extensive studies based on the suppression of aggregation of substrate proteins and enzymatic recovery studies (23Lee G.J. Roseman A.M. Saibil H.R. Vierling E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 659-671Google Scholar,38Lee G.J. Pokala N. Vierling E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10432-10438Google Scholar). For a variety of reasons, these assays were not conducive to defining the mechanistic details of the chaperone function.The simplest model of α-crystallin chaperone function has to include: 1) the identification of the conformational states recognized by the chaperone, 2) the description of the structural changes in the chaperone that are required or accompany recognition and binding, and 3) the measurement of the binding affinity and stoichiometry. Previous studies provided conflicting evidence regarding the nature of the binding process and the identity of the recognized states (39Rajaraman K. Raman B. Rao C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27595-27600Google Scholar, 40Rajaraman K. Raman B. Ramakrishna T. Rao C.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 917-921Google Scholar, 41Treweek T.M. Lindner R.A. Mariani M.

Changes in the αA-crystallin oligomeric structure associated with substrate binding have been deduced from structural analysis, functional studies, and temperature activation of chaperone function (45Ehrnsperger M. Lilie H. Gaestel M. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14867-14874Google Scholar, 46Das K.P. Surewicz W.K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 321-325Google Scholar, 47Das B.K. Liang J.J. Chakrabarti B. Curr.

Biol. 1999; 294: 561-577Google Scholar).For this purpose a set of T4L mutants forming an energetic ladder of lower stability were selected, expressed, and characterized. When presented with these mutants, αA-crystallin was able to sort them according to their stability, binding the mutants with reduced ΔG unf to a larger extent. Given that the T4L mutants have structures similar to the native state, αA-crystallin cannot be recognizing static local unfolding or packing defects. Furthermore, because the aggregation propensity of the variants is negligible on the time scale of binding, aggregation is not a prerequisite for binding.Conformational States of T4L Recognized by αA-CrystallinThe folding equilibrium of all the T4L mutants is two-state. Thus, the simplest interpretation for the differential binding of the T4L mutants is that αA-crystallin recognizes the unfolded state, the equilibrium population of which increases as ΔG unf is reduced. In the range of stability of the mutants reported in this paper, the equilibrium population of the unfolded state is too small to be detected by spectroscopic approaches. Therefore, αA-crystallin shifts the folding equilibrium of T4L by thermodynamic coupling, i.e. stable complexes are detected when the free energy of binding to αA-crystallin is comparable with the free energy of refolding. A simplified coupled equilibrium that does not include possible structural changes in the chaperone associated with substrate binding is shown by Reactions 1 and 2. N⇌UU+αA⇌αAUReactions 1 and 2 These reactions predict that the apparent binding constant of Reaction 2, obtained from linear fits such as those of Fig. 2, is a ratio of the intrinsic binding constant,Kbi, to the folding constant of Reaction 1,Kf. It follows that the ratio of the apparent binding constants of two mutants should reflect their folding equilibrium constant. Kba1Kba2=Kf1Kf2Equation 2 For linear binding isotherms obtained at the same temperature, where a single binding mode predominates, it is possible to test whether this relation holds. An example is the differential apparent affinity at 23 °C, pH 7.6, to L99A and L99A/A130S. For the more than 1 kcal/mol difference in ΔG unf, at least a 5-fold increase in the apparent binding constant is predicted. The observed change is less than a factor of 2.An alternative interpretation of the results is that αA-crystallin is recognizing partially unfolded, excited states that are transiently populated even under native conditions (51Bai Y. Sosnick T.R. Mayne L. Englander S.W. Science. 1995; 269: 192-197Google Scholar, 52Englander S.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 378-381Google Scholar). Despite the apparent two-state nature of protein unfolding curves, it has been demonstrated that proteins in solution are constantly sampling higher energy conformational states that differ significantly in structure and packing from the native state. Whether these states are on the folding pathway has been the subject of debate (53Clarke J. Itzhaki L.S. Fersht A.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 284-287Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the partial loss of structure in these states implies that they are distributed on the energy scale relative to the unfolded state, making them more accessible. Consequently, the free energy change associated with the transition from the native state to one of these states is smaller than ΔG unf.For T4L, native state H/D exchange reveals a continuum of conformations characterized by an average stability in the C-terminal domain that is significantly higher than the N-terminal domain (54Llinas M. Gillespie B. Dahlquist F.W. Marqusee S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 1072-1078Google Scholar). Thus, fluctuations from the native states are likely to occur to states with unfolded N-terminal domain. Furthermore, mutations can alter the energy landscape of these excited states. For instance, recent NMR study of the L99A mutant dynamics reveals interconversion with an excited state that is 2 kcal/mol higher in energy (55Mulder F.A. Mittermaier A. Hon B. Dahlquist F.W. Kay L.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 932-935Google Scholar). The excited state is characterized by partial unfolding in the vicinity of L99A in the C-terminal domain.If αA-crystallin recognizes one or more of these higher energy states, then the reduced overall stability is expected to enhance the binding to the extent detectable by spectroscopic methods, assuming that the mutations destabilize the native state rather than stabilize the unfolded state. The free energy required for the detection of a stable complex is correspondingly smaller than if the binding occurred to the unfolded state. This model is described by the following coupled equilibrium. N⇌I1⇌…⇌IiαA+(I1Ii)⇌(αAI1αAIi)Reactions 3 and 4 The transition from N to Ii is described by an equilibrium constant Kei. This constant replaces Kf in Equation 2. From an energetic perspective, the changes in ΔG unfas a consequence of the decreased stability of N may or may not affect the ΔG of N to Itransition to the same extent, depending on whether the disrupted interactions are present in the excited state. Consequently, the change in K ba is not expected to proportionally track the changes in Kf, as observed experimentally. Although our data do not provide definite evidence of αA-crystallin trapping of these kinetic intermediates, this interpretation is also consistent with the two modes of binding as described below.It is possible that I 1 andIi interconvert in the bound state. Furthermore, if these states are on the unfolding pathway, they are likely to be in equilibrium with the bound unfolded state. Whether such interconversion occurs to a significant extent depends on the balance of the equilibrium constants that characterize these transitions relative to those of the corresponding binding equilibria to αA-crystallin.This paper does not report on the kinetic of complex formation. Consequently, the details of the transition between the recognition and binding events including any conformational rearrangements in either substrate or chaperone have yet to be addressed.Two Modes of BindingThat the binding of the excited states occurs through two modes was demonstrated by the biphasic binding isotherms under different combinations of temperatures and pH. Each mode is characterized by a different affinity and stoichiometry. One of the more significant results of this paper is the selective use of the low affinity mode to bind highly destabilized mutants. This is illustrated in the shift in the number of available sites for L99A/A130S versus those available for L99A/F153A at pH 7.2, 23 °C, or the shift in the binding mode observed at 37 °C between D70N and L99A. In the context of Reactions 3 and 4, this conformational preference might accompany binding of highly unfolded states such asI 1 that appear more frequently as the global ΔG unf is reduced. If indeed αA-crystallin modes of binding display conformational preferences, it is likely that the energetic thresholds for activation are substrate-specific.Given the high stoichiometry in the high capacity mode, it is logical to consider the possibility that T4L might be aggregating in the bound state. Such aggregate will be nucleated by the initial population of globally or partially unfolded T4L bound in the low capacity mode. There are two lines of evidence that exclude this possibility. First, T4L aggregation is unlikely to result in a finite and uniform apparent stoichiometry. Second, such T4L-rich aggregates are likely to be detected as separate peaks on SEC. Unpublished studies using bimane-labeled T4L mutants did not detect such complexes and reveal a rather uniform distribution of bound fluorescent T4L across the αA-crystallin peak.Our data do not exclude the possibility that the two modes correspond physically to the same binding sites, thus the use of the term “mode of binding.” If this is the case, the change in the available number of binding sites may reflect increased access depending on the presented conformational state of the substrate.Activation of αA-Crystallin Chaperone FunctionThe binding of αA-crystallin to its substrate is enhanced by an increase in temperature. Previous studies probing the temperature enhancement of the chaperone efficiency, i.e. the suppression of substrate aggregation, reported similar conclusions (42Neal R. Zigler Jr., J.S. Bettelheim F.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 14-18Google Scholar, 43Bettelheim F.A. Ansari R. Cheng Q.F. Zigler Jr., J.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 292-297Google Scholar, 44Das K.P. Surewicz W.K. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 367-370Google Scholar, 45Ehrnsperger M. Lilie H. Gaestel M. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14867-14874Google Scholar, 46Das K.P. Surewicz W.K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 321-325Google Scholar). However, this is the first direct demonstration that this occurs through the effective increase in the number of binding sites via the activation of a second mode of binding. The quantitative comparison of affinities and stoichiometries at different temperatures is complicated by the presence of the two modes, particularly as the energetic threshold associated with binding to the second mode is approached. This is at the origin of the seemingly similar affinities obtained for substrates with different stabilities, a striking example being L99A and D70N at 37 °C. For the former the main mode of binding occurs at the high capacity sites, whereas for the latter, the binding occurs at the low capacity sites. As a result, despite the reduced stability of L99A relative to D70N, the apparent affinity is similar. The data illustrate the intrinsic problem associated with the interpretation of the aggregation-based assays where it is not possible to distinguish affinity and stoichiometry effects.Similarly, the pH activation involves an increase in the affinity of both modes. This was demonstrated by the increase in the fraction of bound D70N and M102K at higher pH. The pH-induced contribution of the second mode is manifested either by a curved isotherm or by an increase in the apparent number of binding sites in a linear isotherm. The former is more prevalent when the ΔG unfapproaches 5 kcal/mol at 23 °C and 6 kcal/mol at 37 °C. The lower apparent affinity at pH 8 for L99A and M102K compared with pH 7.2 reflects a partial contribution from this mode that is reflected in the increase in the effective number of binding sites.Because the activation process of the high capacity mode is dependent on substrate conformation, a feasible model for activation is through a structural rearrangement in αA-crystallin to accommodate the more unfolded excited states. Such a rearrangement can occur via subunit exchange that involves the transient dissociation of a group of subunits (56Bova M.P. Horwitz J. Fung B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29511-29517Google Scholar, 57Bova M.P. Yaron O. Huang Q. Ding L. Haley D.A. Stewart P.L. Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6137-6142Google Scholar). In the context of this model, an appropriate modification of model 2 would be to add the following equilibrium, where (αA)a is an activated form of αA-crystallin. αA⇌n(αA)aReaction 5 Toward a Mechanistic Model of sHSP Chaperone FunctionFrom the results presented in this paper emerges the outline of a mechanistic model of αA-crystallin with implications for the entire sHSP superfamily. The chaperone function of αA-crystallin involves the recognition of non-native protein states distinct from either the native or the globally unfolded states. These states are populated through fluctuations from the native state as a consequence of the distribution of stabilities across the polypeptide chain (52Englander S.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 378-381Google Scholar). The rates of these fluctuations increase as N is destabilized, be it via directed mutagenesis or as a consequence of changes in the physicochemical conditions. The resulting decrease in the ΔG of interconversion between N andIi makes the association with the chaperone more favorable than refolding to N resulting in a stable complex. Consequently, in a set of mutant of similar native state structures, αA-crystallin is able to “sense” the reduction in the stability of the native state.The transient non-native states are necessarily conformationally heterogeneous as they span a wide range of energies. αA-Crystallin seems to classify them in two categories that are correspondingly bound using two different modes. One interpretation of the data presented in this paper is that αA-crystallin uses the low capacity mode to bind compact native-like states, whereas the high capacity mode is used to bind states that resemble the globally unfolded states. This model predicts that the threshold for binding to each mode will be dependent on the substrate identity because native state fluctuations are dependent on the stability distribution in the context of a structure.The activation of the two modes of binding is significant from two perspectives. First, in many lower organisms, sHSPs are involved in thermotolerance; therefore, a temperature-dependent switch in the structure is not unexpected. Second, mammalian sHSPs, particularly the α-crystallins, have been shown to have a dynamic oligomeric struc"

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3454-3458Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). CMO is not found in animals or bacteria. In these organisms, the first step is catalyzed by membrane-bound choline dehydrogenase (CDH) or soluble choline oxidase (COX) (9Lamark T. Kaasen I. Eshoo M.W. McDougall J. Strom A.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 1049-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 10Boch J. Kemp B. Schmid R. Bremer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 178: 5121-5129Google Scholar, 11Yamada H. Mori N. Tani Y. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1979; 43: 2173-2177Google Scholar). CMO is not well known, having so far been found only in Chenopodiaceae (spinach and sugar beet) and Amaranthaceae (7Burnet M. Lafontaine P.J. Hanson A.D. Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 12Russell B.L. Rathinasabapathi B. Hanson A.D. Plant Physiol. 1998; 116: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 13Wang Y. Meng Y-L. Ishikawa H. Hibino T. Tanaka Y. Nii N. Takabe T. Plant Cell Physiol. 1999; 40: 668-674Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and not detected even in some betaine-accumulating plants such as mangrove (14Hibino T. Meng Y-L. Kawamitsu Y. Uehara N. Matsuda N. Tanaka Y. Ishikawa H. Baba S. Takabe T. Wada K. Ishii T. Takabe T. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 44: 353-363Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar). CMO purified from spinach leaves are shown to be soluble and insensitive to carbon monooxide, contains a Rieske-type iron-sulfur center, and consists of homo-dimer or -trimer of subunitM r 42,000 (7Burnet M. Lafontaine P.J. Hanson A.D. Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 8Rathinasabapathi B. Burnet M. Russell B.L. Gage D.A. Liao P-C. Nye G.J. Scot P. Golbeck J.H. Hanson A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3454-3458Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). These properties are completely unrelated to CDH, COX, and cytochrome P-450-type monooxygenases. The activity of purified CMO is extremely low (393 picokatal mg−1) probably due to the labile property of the enzyme (7Burnet M. Lafontaine P.J. Hanson A.D. Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), which hampers further characterization. For functional characterization of CMO, it would be useful to express it in E. coli, which has not yet been reported. In this study, we examined whether CMO could function in E. coli and cyanobacteria. E. coli contains a bet gene cluster consisting of betA, betB,betT, and betI, which encode CDH, BADH, choline transport, and regulatory protein, respectively (9Lamark T. Kaasen I. Eshoo M.W. McDougall J. Strom A.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 1049-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). We constructed the expression vectors in which the CDH gene of E. coli bet gene clusters was replaced with CMO or deleted. The vectors were used for the transformation of E. coli (DH5α) and fresh water cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC7942, neither of which could synthesis betaine. For operation of CMO in these organisms, the Rieske-type iron-sulfur center must be assembled into the CMO polypeptide, and reduced ferredoxin is required. We tested whether the heterologous expression could be used for the characterization of functional properties of spinach CMO and obtained information on the active site of CMO by a site-directed mutagenesis approach. A recent genome sequence of Arabidopsis revealed thatArabidopsis contains a CMO-like gene (accession nos. NM_119135 and CAB43664). Because Arabidopsis is a betaine non-accumulating plant, we examined whether the CMO-like gene is expressed in Arabidopsis and its physiological function if any. Here, we show that a CMO-like gene was transcribed inArabidopsis, but the protein was not detected. Although both spinach CMO and Arabidopsis CMO-like protein could be expressed in E. coli, only spinach CMO was involved in betaine synthesis. The spinach CMO gene was isolated by PCR technique from the spinach cDNA library, which was a kind gift from Prof. K. Saito, Faculty of Pharmacy of Chiba University. Using the forward primer SpPCMO-F and reverse primer SpPCMO-R (Table I), a 1320-bp fragment was amplified and ligated into the EcoRV site of pBluescript II SK+. The resulting plasmid pSPCMO encodes the precursor CMO (8Rathinasabapathi B. Burnet M. Russell B.L. Gage D.A. Liao P-C. Nye G.J. Scot P. Golbeck J.H. Hanson A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3454-3458Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). For the construction of mature CMO expression vector, the forward primer SpMCMO-F, containing the 121–133 bases of spinach CMO cDNA (8Rathinasabapathi B. Burnet M. Russell B.L. Gage D.A. Liao P-C. Nye G.J. Scot P. Golbeck J.H. Hanson A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3454-3458Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) andNdeI site, and the reverse primer SpPCMO-R, containing the stop codon, were used. The amplified fragment, 1145 bp, was ligated into the EcoRV site of pBluescript II SK+ and then digested with the NdeI and BamHI. The resulting fragment was ligated into the corresponding site of pET3a plasmid vector, which generated the plasmid, pSMCMO, encoding the mature CMO.Table IPrimers for isolation and expression of CMO genesPrimers5′—-3′Base pairsSpPCMO-F5′-TAATGATGGCAGCAAGCGCAA-3′21 merSpPCMO-R5′-AATTACTTCAAAGTTTGTTGCAAC-3′24 merSpMCMO-F5′-TACATATGGCCGTCGCGGCACCGT-3′24 merAtPCMO-F5′-ATGATGACCACGTTAACGGC-3′20 merAtPCMO-A5′-CAGTTTGAGATTGTGATGTA-3′20 merSpMCMONae-F5′-AACGCCGGCGCGGCACCGTCCT-3′22 merAtMCMONae-F5′-ATGCCGGCAGATTTCACAATC-3′21 merAtMCMO-A5′-ATGGTACCTCACAGTTTGAGATT-3′23 merC181STA-R5′-ATCCATGGTAAGGGG(C/T/A)CACGAAACACGACTT-3′33 merH287Nde-R5′-ATCATATGAGCTATCCAAGTA-3′21 merH278GVANde-F5′-CTCATATG(G/T/C)TGTTCCTTATGCACAC-3′27 mer Open table in a new tab The transcription of Arabidopsis CMO-like gene was examined by the reverse transcription (RT) reaction technique. For this, total RNA was extracted from Arabidopsis leaves by using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide as described previously (14Hibino T. Meng Y-L. Kawamitsu Y. Uehara N. Matsuda N. Tanaka Y. Ishikawa H. Baba S. Takabe T. Wada K. Ishii T. Takabe T. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 44: 353-363Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The single strand DNA was constructed by RT-PCR reaction using the forward primer AtPCMO-F and reverse primer AtPCMO-R, which matched to the 5′- and 3′-terminal sequences of genomic DNA of Arabidopsis CMO-like gene, respectively. The amplified fragment was ligated into theEcoRV site of pBluescript II SK+. The E. coli bet gene cluster was ligated into theBamHI site of an E. coli/Synechococcusshuttle vector pUC303-Bm (15Nomura M. Ishitani M. Takabe T. Rai A.K. Takabe T. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 703-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), which was designated as pBET+CDH. For the substitution of betA gene with spinach CMO orArabidopsis CMO-like gene, first, the NaeI site was introduced at the 5′-terminal region of mature spinach CMO orArabidopsis CMO-like gene. For the mature spinach CMO, the forward primer SpMCMONae-F, containing NaeI site and 187–199 bases of spinach CMO cDNA (8Rathinasabapathi B. Burnet M. Russell B.L. Gage D.A. Liao P-C. Nye G.J. Scot P. Golbeck J.H. Hanson A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3454-3458Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) and reverse primer SpPCMO-R, were used. For the Arabidopsis CMO-like gene, the forward primer AtMCMONae-F, containing NaeI site and 121–133 bases of Arabidopsis CMO-like gene, and the reverse primer AtMCMO-R, containing BamHI site and stop codon, were used. The amplified fragments were ligated into the EcoRV site of pBluescript II SK+. The resulting plasmids were digested withNaeI and also with KpnI derived from the pBluescript II SK+. On the other hand, the bet gene cluster was digested with BamHI and ligated into theBamHI site of pUC18. The resulting plasmid pUCBET was digested with NaeI and KpnI, which removed most of the betA gene (nucleotides 31–1430 of betA). Then, the NaeI/KpnI-digested mature spinach CMO or Arabidopsis CMO-like gene was ligated into the corresponding site of pUCBET. The resulting plasmids were digested withHindIII (derived from the pBluescript II SK+) andXbaI (derived from the pUC18) and ligated into theSalI site of pUC303-Bm. The generated plasmid, pBET+SpCMO or pBET+AtCMO, encodes a protein containing the extra 9 N-terminal residues of CDH fused to mature protein, but the second residue Val in the mature protein was changed to Gly. For deletion of betA from the bet gene cluster, pUCBET was digested withNaeI and KpnI, filled in with Klenow DNA polymerase, and then digested with BamHI and XbaI (derived from the pUC18). The resulting fragment was ligated into the corresponding site of pUC303-Bm, and the plasmid pBET-CDH was generated. The plasmids pBET+CDH, pBET+SpCMO, pBET+AtCMO, and pBET-CDH were expressed in E. coli DH5α cells in which thebet gene cluster was deleted from the host genome. The mutant spinach CMO genes were constructed by the PCR technique using the plasmid pSMCMO as template. The second Cys in the putative consensus sequence (CXHX 15–17CX 2H) for coordination of Rieske-type [2Fe-2S] cluster was changed to Ser, Ala, and Thr. The forward primer was SpMCMONae-F. For the reverse primer, the NcoI site at position 549 in the CMO gene was used. The reverse primer C181STA-R, corresponding to the 526–558 bases of spinach CMO cDNA, contains the NcoI site and mixed nucleotides (T/A/G)CC, which encode Ser, Thr, and Ala in place of TGC encoding Cys-181. The amplified fragment was ligated into the EcoRV site of pBluescript II SK+, double digested withNaeI/NcoI, and ligated into theNaeI/NcoI sites in pSMCMO. The mutant CMO genes were transferred to the pBET+SpCMO as described above. The resulting plasmids encoding CMO mutants, C181S, C181T, and C181A, were designated as pBET+SpCMOC/S, pBET+SpCMOC/T, and pBET+SpCMOC/A, respectively. Next, the first His in the putative consensus sequence for coordination of mononuclear non-heme Fe, G/DX 3–4DX 2HX 4–5H, was changed to Gly, Ala, and Val. For this, a NdeI site was introduced at position 854 in the spinach CMO gene. The 5′-terminal part in the CMO gene was amplified by PCR using the plasmid pSMCMO as the template. The forward primer SpMCMONae-F and the reverse primer H287Nde-R, containing the introduced NdeI site were used. The 3′-terminal part of the CMO gene was amplified by using the forward primer H278GVANde-F and the reverse primer SpPCMO-R. The forward primer contains the introduced NdeI site and mixed nucleotides G(G/T/C)T, which encode Gly, Val, and Ala in place of CAT encoding His-287. Both amplified fragments were mixed, annealed, and amplified by using the primer sets SpMCMONae-F and SpPCMO-R. The amplified fragment was ligated into the EcoRV site of pBluescript II SK+ and then transferred to the pBET+SpCMO as described above. The generated plasmids that encode the CMO mutants, H287G, H287V, and H287A, were designated as pBET+SpCMOH/G, pBET+SpCMOH/V, and pBET+SpCMOH/A, respectively. For the expression of betaine synthesis genes in E. coli and Synechococcus, E. coli DH5α andSynechococcus sp. PCC7942 cells were transformed with pBET+CDH, pBET+SpCMO, pBET+AtCMO, and pBET-CDH. E. colicells were grown at 30 °C in l-broth supplemented with 100 μm choline and 50 μg ml−1streptomycin. Synechococcus cells were subcultured at 30 °C under continuous fluorescent white light at 80 μEm−2 s−1 in BG 11 liquid medium supplemented with 100 μm choline and 10 μg ml−1 streptomycin and bubbled with air. Cells at the logarithmic phase were transferred into fresh medium containing various concentrations of NaCl. The cultures were incubated for various times as indicated. For the expression of mature spinach CMO, E. coli BL21(DE3) cells transformed with pSMCMO were grown at 30 °C in Terrific-broth with 50 μg/ml ampicillin until the optical density at 600 nm reached 0.6, and then 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added (16Incharoensakdi A. Matsuda N. Hibino T. Meng Y-L. Ishikawa H. Hara A. Funaguma T. Takabe T. Takabe T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 7015-7023Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). After induction, 250 μm ferric ammonium citrate was added four times at intervals of 30 min. Cells were allowed to grow overnight and harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 rpm for 10 min. The pellets were dissolved in 20 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.02% β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (buffer A) per liter of culture medium and sonicated for 5 min. After centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 30 min, the supernatant was used for the measurement of CMO activity. For the construction of binary vector of spinach CMO, the pSPCMO plasmid was double digested with NdeI and BamHI. The resulting fragment was blunt-ended and ligated into theSmaI/SacI-digested and blunt-ended pBI121 vector. The resulting vector was designated as pBI-SpCMO. For the construction of binary vector coexpressing spinach CMO and BADH, the full-length spinach BADH gene was amplified by PCR as previously described (16Incharoensakdi A. Matsuda N. Hibino T. Meng Y-L. Ishikawa H. Hara A. Funaguma T. Takabe T. Takabe T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 7015-7023Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and ligated into the HincII site of pUC119. The resulting plasmid was digested with XbaI and BamHI. The digested fragment was ligated into the corresponding site of pBI121. Then, a SmaI/SacI fragment containing the glucuronidase gene was removed and blunt-ended to give pBI-BADH. On the other hand, pBI-SpCMO was digested byHindIII/EcoRI, blunt-ended, and ligated into the partially digested EcoRI site of pBI-BADH to give pBI-SpCMO+BADH. Arabidopsis plants (ecotype Columbia) were transformed by the Agrobacterium-mediated method as described previously (17Hoshida H. Tanaka Y. Hibino T. Hayashi Y. Tanaka A. Takabe T. Takabe T. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 43: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Two transformants homozygous for the introduced genes and showing high level expressions were used for the analysis of stress tolerance. Plants were incubated with Murashige & Skoog medium containing 1 mm choline in a growth chamber (Sanyo MLR-350HT, Japan) at 22 °C with a 16-h light (150 mEm−2 s−1)/8-h dark cycle and 60% relative humidity. For salt stress, 3-week-old Arabidopsisplants were treated with 200 mm NaCl. The quantum yield in photosystem II (PSII) was measured. For drought stress, water was withheld for 24 h and then resupplied, and percentages of surviving plants were counted. Low temperature treatment was carried out with the incubation at 5 °C under continuous irradiation. For the experiments of exogenous betaine, 1 mm betaine was added to the growth medium in place of choline. Betaine was extracted as described previously and measured after esterification with time of flight mass spectroscopy (KOMPACT MALDI IV tDE, Shimadzu/Kratos) using d11-betaine as an internal standard (14Hibino T. Meng Y-L. Kawamitsu Y. Uehara N. Matsuda N. Tanaka Y. Ishikawa H. Baba S. Takabe T. Wada K. Ishii T. Takabe T. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 44: 353-363Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 18Rhodes D. Rich P.J. Myers A.C. Reuter C.C. Jamieson G.C. Plant Physiol. 1987; 84: 781-788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Photosynthetic activities were measured using a pulse amplitude modulation chlorophyll fluorometer (Walz, Effeltrich, Germany) (17Hoshida H. Tanaka Y. Hibino T. Hayashi Y. Tanaka A. Takabe T. Takabe T. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 43: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Before the measurements, cells were dark-adapted for 10 min, and then the quantum yield in photosystem II under continuous light (200 μE m−2 s−1) was calculated by the equation, (Fm′−F)/Fm′, where, F and Fm′ represent the fluorescence levels under irradiation before and after a saturating flash, respectively. SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were carried out as previously described (14Hibino T. Meng Y-L. Kawamitsu Y. Uehara N. Matsuda N. Tanaka Y. Ishikawa H. Baba S. Takabe T. Wada K. Ishii T. Takabe T. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 44: 353-363Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar). N-terminal amino acid sequencing was carried out as described (19Lee B.H. Hibino T., Jo, J. Viale A.M. Takabe T. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 35: 763-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Antiserum raised against the spinach CMO was prepared using a white New Zealand rabbit female as previously described (13Wang Y. Meng Y-L. Ishikawa H. Hibino T. Tanaka Y. Nii N. Takabe T. Plant Cell Physiol. 1999; 40: 668-674Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 19Lee B.H. Hibino T., Jo, J. Viale A.M. Takabe T. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 35: 763-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To examine whether the CMO-like gene is expressed in Arabidopsis, we carried out RT-PCR. Using the primer sets, which completely matched the 5′- and 3′-terminal regions of putative CMO-like gene, a 1.3-kb fragment was amplified. The nucleotide sequence revealed that the amplified fragment was the putative CMO-like gene. However, the CMO-like protein deduced from the amplified cDNA was different from that of the genome sequence in two points. As shown in Fig.1, ten amino acids (115RLGDVDFVVC124) deduced from the cDNA were missing in the putative CMO-like protein deduced from the genome sequence. By contrast, 14 amino acids (279TLVASCDELYGLRY292) deduced from the genome sequence were missing in our cDNA. These differences were probably due to the inaccurate prediction of exon in the genome sequence. Another difference was the change of Ile-371 (ATC) in the genomic DNA to Val-367 (GTC) in the cDNA. Regardless of these differences, the present results indicate that the full-length CMO-like gene was transcribed in Arabidopsis. We also amplified the spinach CMO gene and sequenced it. Its nucleotide sequence completely coincided with the published one (8Rathinasabapathi B. Burnet M. Russell B.L. Gage D.A. Liao P-C. Nye G.J. Scot P. Golbeck J.H. Hanson A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3454-3458Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Alignment of amino acids between Arabidopsis CMO-like protein, spinach CMO, and sugar beet CMO (12Russell B.L. Rathinasabapathi B. Hanson A.D. Plant Physiol. 1998; 116: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) revealed that all these proteins contain the putative consensus sequences for coordination of the Rieske-type [2Fe-2S] cluster, CXHX 15–17CX 2H (where X represents any amino acid), and for coordination of mononuclear non-heme Fe, G/DX 3–4 DX 2HX 4–5H (8Rathinasabapathi B. Burnet M. Russell B.L. Gage D.A. Liao P-C. Nye G.J. Scot P. Golbeck J.H. Hanson A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3454-3458Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). However, the Pro after the second Cys of the Rieske-type cluster motif in CMO proteins was changed to Leu in ArabidopsisCMO-like protein. The tripeptide TyrTyrAla after the second His of mononuclear non-heme motif in CMO proteins was also changed to Gly-Leu-Met in Arabidopsis CMO-like protein. At the amino acid level, Arabidopsis CMO-like protein shares 51% identity with spinach CMO (8Rathinasabapathi B. Burnet M. Russell B.L. Gage D.A. Liao P-C. Nye G.J. Scot P. Golbeck J.H. Hanson A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3454-3458Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) and 48% identity with sugar beet CMO (12Russell B.L. Rathinasabapathi B. Hanson A.D. Plant Physiol. 1998; 116: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The identity increased to 78% when spinach CMO was compared with sugar beet CMO. Presence of chloroplast targeting transit peptides in spinach (8Rathinasabapathi B. Burnet M. Russell B.L. Gage D.A. Liao P-C. Nye G.J. Scot P. Golbeck J.H. Hanson A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3454-3458Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) and sugar beet (12Russell B.L. Rathinasabapathi B. Hanson A.D. Plant Physiol. 1998; 116: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) CMOs has been shown. Fig. 1 suggests that Arabidopsis CMO-like protein also contains the transit peptide, although its homology with those of spinach and sugar beet CMOs is rather low. To examine whether the CMO-like protein is expressed in Arabidopsis, the soluble proteins were extracted from Arabidopsis. Western blotting analysis using an antibody raised against spinach CMO showed that unlike spinach CMO, the Arabidopsis CMO-like protein could not be detected in either the root or leaf ofArabidopsis (Fig.2 A). These results suggest that the CMO-like protein does not accumulate in Arabidopsisor cannot be detected by the antibody raised against spinach CMO. We examined whether spinach CMO andArabidopsis CMO-like protein could be expressed inE. coli. The expression vectors pBET+CDH, pBET+SpCMO, pBET+AtCMO, and pBET-CDH were constructed as shown in Fig.3 A and used for transformingE. coli DH5α cells. The expressed proteins were analyzed by Western blotting. DH5α cells transformed with pBET+SpCMO or pBET+AtCMO accumulated a protein that cross-reacted with the antibody raised against spinach CMO (Fig. 2 B, lanes 2 and3), whereas E. coli cells expressing pBET+CDH (Fig. 2 B, lane 1) or pBET-CDH (data not shown) did not show the cross-reaction band. When the mature spinach CMO (8Rathinasabapathi B. Burnet M. Russell B.L. Gage D.A. Liao P-C. Nye G.J. Scot P. Golbeck J.H. Hanson A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3454-3458Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) and Arabidopsis CMO-like protein were expressed in E. coli, the mature-size proteins accumulated in the soluble fraction, whereas when the precursor spinach CMO was expressed inE. coli, most of the precursor protein accumulated in the insoluble fraction without processing (data not shown). These results indicate that both spinach CMO and Arabidopsis CMO-like protein could be expressed in E. coli and that the failure of detection of CMO-like protein in Arabidopsis (Fig.2 A) was not due to the weak reactivity of the spinach CMO antibody with Arabidopsis CMO-like protein. Next, we examined the accumulation of betaine in the transformants. As shown in Fig. 4, the E. coli DH5α cells transformed with pBET+CDH accumulated betaine and its contents increased as the concentration of NaCl increased. However, the betaine levels in DH5α cells or DH5α cells expressing pBET-CDH were negligible even if the cells were grown at high salinity (0.5m NaCl). They were about 2% of those produced by thebet gene cluster. By contrast, the E. coli cells expressing pBET+SpCMO accumulated betaine at about 37% of that expressing pBET+CDH at 0.5 m NaCl. The E. colicells expressing pBET+AtCMO did not accumulate betaine. These results indicate that spinach CMO catalyzes the oxidation of choline to betaine aldehyde in E. coli, whereas Arabidopsis CMO-like protein is not involved in betaine synthesis. Because reduced ferredoxin is required for the function of CMO (7Burnet M. Lafontaine P.J. Hanson A.D. Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 8Rathinasabapathi B. Burnet M. Russell B.L. Gage D.A. Liao P-C. Nye G.J. Scot P. Golbeck J.H. Hanson A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3454-3458Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), the present results suggest that E. coli ferredoxin (21Ta D.T. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11120-11125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) could replace spinach ferredoxin. Due to the absence of the bet gene cluster, the E. coliDH5α cells are relatively salt-sensitive. We examined the effects of CMO expression on the salt tolerance of DH5α cells. All the DH5α cells transformed with pBET+CDH, pBET+SpCMO, and pBET-CDH grew normally on agar plates containing 100 mm NaCl (Fig.5 A). By contrast, only the cells transformed with pBET+CDH and pBET+SpCMO could grow on agar plates containing 500 mm NaCl (Fig. 5 B). The three transformants grew almost at the same rate in minimum medium containing 10 mm NaCl as shown in Fig.5 C. However, at high salinities (250 mm and 500 mm NaCl), the DH5α cells transformed with pBET+CDH and pBET+SpCMO showed a higher growth rate than pBET-CDH. These results clearly indicate that spinach CMO could complement the salt-sensitive phenotype of E. coli DH5α cells. The nucleotide sequence showed that the CMO gene contains a Rieske-type [2Fe-2S] cluster motif as well as mononuclear non-heme Fe binding motif (8Rathinasabapathi B. Burnet M. Russell B.L. Gage D.A. Liao P-C. Nye G.J. Scot P. Golbeck J.H. Hanson A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3454-3458Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 12Russell B.L. Rathinasabapathi B. Hanson A.D. Plant Physiol. 1998; 116: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). However, no experimental evidence on the specific amino acids has been reported. Therefore, we modified the second Cys in the putative consensus sequence for coordination of Rieske-type [2Fe-2S] cluster to Ser, Ala, and Thr. The C181S, C181A, and C181T mutants were expressed in E. coli. The accumulation levels of protein in mutants were almost the same as that of the wild-type CMO (Fig.6 A).

Compared with kinases, very little is known about the regulation of protein phosphatases. PP2A,1 one of the four major classes of protein serine/threonine phosphatases in cells, is a family of abundant and ubiquitous enzymes with pleiotropic functions ranging from cell cycle regulation to synaptic plasticity (1Janssens V. Goris J. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 417-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1549) Google Scholar). The predominant form of PP2A in cells has a heterotrimeric subunit structure, consisting of a core dimer of ∼36 kDa catalytic and ∼65 kDa scaffold subunits (subunits C and A, respectively) complexed to a third variable subunit. Variable subunits are encoded by three multigene families (B, B′, B“) and are believed to dictate substrate specificity, subcellular localization, and regulation of PP2A by phosphorylation. There is growing evidence that incorporation of different variable subunits imparts specific cellular functions to PP2A. PP2A, containing B′ (B56, PR61) family subunits, participates in Wnt/β-catenin signaling, a signal transduction pathway necessary for vertebrate axis formation in early embryogenesis (2Hsu W. Zeng L.

B′ subunits bind to cyclin G1 and G2, suggesting that PP2A holoenzymes containing these subunits are involved in cell cycle regulation (4Okamoto K. Kamibayashi C. Serrano M. Prives C. Mumby M.C.

The B“ subunit PR48 was first identified in a screen for proteins that interact with cdc6, a component of DNA prereplication complexes (7Yan Z. Fedorov S.A. Mumby M.C. Williams R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1021-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and may mediate the obligatory role of PP2A in the initiation of chromosomal DNA replication (8Lin X.H. Walter J. Scheidtmann K. Ohst K. Newport J. Walter G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14693-14698Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Another B” subunit, PR59, recently identified as an interaction partner for the retinoblastoma-related p107 protein (9Voorhoeve P.M. Hijmans E.M. Bernards R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 515-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), could be important in the rapid dephosphorylation of p107 following DNA damage (10Voorhoeve P.M. Watson R.J. Farlie P.G. Bernards R. Lam E.W. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 679-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). PP2A holoenzymes containing B“ family subunits may thus be specialized regulators of the G1/S cell cycle transition. Despite being the first PP2A regulatory subunits to be identified, roles of members of the B-type subunit family (PR55) are still largely enigmatic. In mammals, four genes (Bα–δ) code for 54–57-kDa proteins, which are additionally diversified by alternative splicing or promoter use. Bα–δ are more than 80% identical at the amino acid level, with the greatest clustering of divergent residues at the N terminus. B-family PP2A subunits are predicted to adopt a seven-blade β-propeller fold similar to the β-subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins (11Strack S. Ruediger R. Walter G. Dagda R.K. Barwacz C.A.

Bβ and Bγ expression is differentially regulated during development and maturation of the rat brain; Bβ protein and mRNA levels are high in late embryonic brain and decrease modestly after birth. In contrast, Bγ expression increases sharply postnatally to plateau at 2 weeks of age (17Strack S. Zaucha J.A. Ebner F.F. Colbran R.J. Wadzinski B.E. J. Comp.

This report begins to analyze the functions of neuronal PP2A regulatory subunits in the pheochromocytoma PC12 cell line, an experimentally tractable model system of neuronal differentiation and neurite outgrowth (19Segal R.A.

Upon NGF treatment, PC12 cells develop into sympathetic neuron-like cells with elaborate neurites capable of generating action potentials (23Toledo-Aral J.J. Brehm P. Halegoua S. Mandel G. Neuron. 1995; 14: 607-611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Although NGF binding to the TrkA receptor tyrosine kinase activates several signaling pathways, sustained activation of the MAP kinase cascade is both obligatory and sufficient for neurite outgrowth and differentiation (24Qui M.S. Green S.H. Neuron. 1992; 9: 705-717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 25Traverse S. Gomez N. Paterson H. Marshall C. Cohen P. Biochem.

Evidence from several laboratories supports a model in which NGF promotes persistent activation of the small GTPase Rap1. Rap1 then recruits the serine/threonine kinase B-Raf to the membrane and maintains its activity by poorly understood mechanisms ((Refs. 27York R.D. Yao H. Dillon T. Ellig C.L. Eckert S.P.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5905-5912Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Raf family kinases phosphorylate the dual-specificity kinase MEK1, which in turn activates MAP kinases of the ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) family. ERKs are broad specificity serine/threonine kinases that target cytosolic as well as nuclear substrates, including the transcription factors Myc and Elk1 (31Pearson G. Robinson F. Beers Gibson T., Xu, B.E. Karandikar M. Berman K. Cobb M.H. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 153-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (3564) Google Scholar). Here, I show that NGF-mediated differentiation of a PC12 subline leads to expression of neuronal PP2A regulatory subunits. One of these subunits, Bγ, can promote neuronal differentiation through the MAP kinase pathway by activating B-Raf. The PC6-3 cell line (32Pittman R.N. Wang S. DiBenedetto A.J. Mills J.C. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 3669-3680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was obtained from Henry Paulson (University of Iowa). This PC12 subline was found to display less propensity to form cell aggregates and could be transfected with higher efficiency than its parental cell line. PC6-3 cells were grown on uncoated plastic in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% horse serum and 5% fetal bovine serum in a 5% CO2 incubator. HEK293 and COS-M6 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/high glucose containing 10% fetal bovine serum. cDNAs of B subunits were isolated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction from rat brain total RNA (Access RT-PCR kit, Promega, Madison, WI), subcloned into a pcDNA3.1 mammalian expression vector under control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter and FLAG epitope-tagged at the N terminus by PCR. The addition of the FLAG epitope did not affect the activity of Bγ in neurite outgrowth and MAP kinase assays (not shown). The Bγ 1-35α chimera was constructed by PCR-amplifying Bα 5′ and Bγ 3′ sequences and ligating the fragments utilizing an introduced silent NheI site. Plasmids encoding FLAG-ERK2 and Myc-B-Raf were obtained from Philip Stork (Vollum Institute) and Richard Marais (Royal Cancer Hospital, London), respectively. Hemagglutinin (HA)-MEK1 wild-type and dominant-negative MEK1 K97R plasmids were provided by Jeffrey Pessin (University of Iowa). HA-tagged B′ (B56) α-subunit plasmid and B′ antibodies were obtained from David Virshup (University of Utah). PP2A/A, Bα/δ, Bβ, and Bγ antibodies were from Brian Wadzinski (Vanderbilt University) (17Strack S. Zaucha J.A. Ebner F.F. Colbran R.J. Wadzinski B.E. J. Comp. Neurol. 1998; 392: 515-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The following reagents were obtained commercially: antibodies to the PP2A C subunit, ERK1/2, B-Raf, protein G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); FLAG-tag antibody (M2) and its agarose conjugate (Sigma); 2.5S NGF, glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-ERK2, GST-MEK1 (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY); GST-Elk1, phospho-Ser-383 Elk1 antibody, phospho-ERK1/2 antibody (Cell Signaling Technologies, Beverly, MA); Myc- and HA-tag-directed antibodies (Covance, Princeton, NJ); U0126, K252A (Calbiochem). PC6-3 cells were transfected at 20–30% confluency with 1 μg of DNA (0.8 μg of PP2A subunit plasmid, 0.2 μg of pEGFP-C1, a green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression vector), and 2 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) per well of a 12-well plate according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 36–48 h, neurite outgrowth of living cells was analyzed by capturing digital images from 4–5 randomly selected fields on an inverted epifluorescence microscope. Transmitted and mercury light sources were adjusted to superimpose phase contrast and fluorescence signals on the same image (Kodak MDS290 documentation system). Images were analyzed using NIH Image software by a second, naive experimenter, who either counted cells with neurites longer than 2-cell body diameters or measured the area of a rectangle bounding the cell body and neurites. Tetracycline-inducible, stably Bγ-expressing PC6-3 cell lines were generated by two rounds of antibiotic selection essentially as described by the vendor of the T-Rex system (Invitrogen). Briefly, PC6-3 cells were transfected with the linearized vector pcDNA6/TR encoding the tetracycline repressor (TR) protein. After selection in blasticidine (5 μg/ml), 48 clones were expanded and tested for TR function by transfection with a pcDNA5/TO/LacZ reporter plasmid and chemiluminescent β-galactosidase assay (Galacto-Star, Tropix, Bedford, MA). One clone (PC6-3/TR156) displayed 25-fold induction of β-galactosidase activity upon treatment with doxycycline and was transfected with linearized pcDNA5/TO/FLAG-Bγ, a plasmid encoding FLAG-tagged Bγ under control of a chimeric CMV promoter/tetracycline operator. Cells were selected for plasmid integration in 500 μg/ml hygromycin, 2 μg/ml blasticidine. Eighty-four clones were expanded and tested for inducible Bγ expression by MAP kinase reporter assays (below) and immunoblotting. Eight clones showed more than 3-fold doxycycline-inducible MAP kinase activity and a high level of Bγ expression. Cells were cultured in 24-well plates for up to 4 days in the presence of 1 μg/ml doxycycline, 20 ng/ml NGF, or vehicle. [3H]Thymidine (2 μCi/ml) was added to the medium for 6 h followed by a wash with phosphate buffered saline and incubation with 0.5 ml/well 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid for 20 min at 4 °C to remove unincorporated label. DNA was solubilized with 0.5 ml/well 0.1 n NaOH and scintillation-counted. Cells cultured in 24-well plates were transfected at 40–70% confluency with 1 μl/well LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) and 500 ng/well DNA comprising 250 ng of PP2A regulatory subunit plasmid (or empty vector), 125 ng of pFR-Luc (GAL4 promoter-driven luciferase), 12.5 ng of pFA-Elk1 (CMV promoter-driven GAL4 DNA binding domain-Elk1 fusion protein, Elk1 PathDetect Trans-reporter assay, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and 112.5 ng of pSV40-βGal (SV40 promoter-driven β-galactosidase). After 16–18 h of serum starvation (1/10 normal serum concentration) and 36–48 h following transfection, cells were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 100 μl/well lysis buffer (luciferase assay kit, Promega). Luciferase activity was measured from cleared lysates (20,000 × g, 15 min) with a tube luminometer according to the manufacturer's instructions and normalized to β-galactosidase activity determined from the same lysates by a chemiluminescent assay (Galacto-Star, Tropix). PC6-3 cells were cultured in 12-well plates to 40–70% confluency and transfected with 2 μl/well LipofectAMINE 2000 and 1 μg/well DNA (750 ng of Bγ plasmid or empty vector plus 250 ng of epitope-tagged kinase (B-Raf, MEK1, or ERK2) plasmid). 36–48 h after transfection and following an overnight incubation with low serum medium (1% horse serum, 0.5% fetal calf serum), cells were lysed in 150 μl/well immunoprecipitation/kinase lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris pH 7.5, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 1 mm Na3V04, 1 mmNa4P2O7, 1 μmmicrocystin-LR, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm benzamidine) and sonicated for 2 s at low intensity with a probe tip sonicator. Debris was pelleted (20,000 × g, 15 min), and kinases were immunoprecipitated from the cleared lysate with 0.5–2 μg of epitope-tagged antibodies and 6 μl of protein G-agarose for 4 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed with 6 ml of immunoprecipitation/kinase lysis buffer and 1.5 ml of kinase assay buffer (25 mm Tris pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mmβ-glycerolphosphate, 0.1 mmNa3V04, 1 μm microcystin-LR). Kinase assays were started by adding 25 μl of assay mix to the immunoprecipitates; the mixture was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with intermittent agitation, and assays were stopped by the addition of 10 μl of 4× SDS-sample buffer containing 100 mm EDTA. The assay mixes contained 40 μg/ml GST-Elk1 substrate and 200 μm ATP in kinase assay buffer. MEK1 assays additionally included 20 μg/ml GST-ERK2, and B-Raf assays included GST-ERK2 in addition to 2 μg/ml GST-MEK1. Kinase assays were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with phospho-Ser-383 Elk1 antibodies and chemiluminescent detection (SuperSignal, Pierce) on a Kodak Imager 440. Serially diluted samples were analyzed to ensure quantification in the linear range of detection. Phospho-Ser-383 Elk1 immunoreactivity was quantified from digital images using NIH Image software, subtracting negligible background phosphorylation from immunoprecipitates of mock-transfected cells. PC6-3 cells are a subline of PC12 cells. Upon withdrawal of NGF, differentiated PC6-3 cells undergo rapid apoptosis even in the presence of serum, which may make them a better model of sympathetic neurons than PC12 cells (32Pittman R.N. Wang S. DiBenedetto A.J. Mills J.C. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 3669-3680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the expression of endogenous PP2A subunits, PC6-3 cells were treated for several days in the presence or absence of NGF and analyzed by immunoblotting with specific antibodies (17Strack S. Zaucha J.A. Ebner F.F. Colbran R.J. Wadzinski B.E. J. Comp. Neurol. 1998; 392: 515-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). NGF treatment resulted in robust neurite outgrowth and expression of differentiation markers such as VGF and neurofilament heavy chain (Fig. 1 and not shown). Concomitant with differentiation, NGF induced expression of the brain-specific Bβ and Bγ, as well as the brain-enriched B′β isoform of PP2A regulatory subunits. Levels of the catalytic C, the scaffolding A, the Bα and Bδ subunit (detected by an antibody that recognizes both B subunits), and B′α and B′δ remained unchanged. Thus, differentiation of PC6-3 cells is accompanied by the induction of neuronal PP2A holoenzymes. To test whether neuronal PP2A isoforms are involved in the establishment of the neuronal phenotype, PC6-3 cells were transiently transfected with a panel of regulatory subunit expression plasmids or vector alone together with a plasmid encoding GFP to mark transfected cells. Expression was verified by immunoblotting; however, protein levels could not be compared because of a lack of antibodies that recognize all regulatory subunits (not shown). 48 h after transfection, living cells were scored for neurite outgrowth by measuring the area of a rectangle that bounded the cell body and neurites. Transfection with Bγ, but not Bα or Bβ, resulted in the extension of numerous short neurites quantified as an increase of the bounding rectangle area (51 ± 9%,n = 11 experiments, Fig.2 and data not shown). Bγ also enhanced neurite outgrowth in cells treated 24 h after transfection with NGF (46 ± 16%, n = 9 experiments), indicating that NGF and this PP2A subunit act synergistically. NGF-treated cells were also scored for neurite outgrowth by counting cells with neurites longer than twice the diameter of the soma (Fig. 2 C). This method gave similar results as the bounding rectangle method. The bounding area method was used in all subsequent experiments, as it allowed quantification of early morphological changes. Neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells involves a “cell fate” choice characterized by morphological changes (i.e. neuritogenesis) but also cessation of growth, loss of chromaffin cell markers, and synthesis of neuronal proteins. Previous studies with the protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid have shown that PP2A activity is required for neurite maintenance of differentiated neurons (33Chiou J.Y. Westhead E.W. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 1963-1966Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 34Giasson B.I. Mushynski W.E. J. Neurobiol. 1997; 32: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 35Merrick S.E. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 5726-5737Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It therefore became important to investigate whether Bγ expression causes neuronal differentiation as opposed to neurite outgrowthper se. To this end, PC6-3 cell lines were created that express FLAG epitope-tagged Bγ under control of a tetracycline-inducible CMV promoter (see “Experimental Procedures”). Several clonal isolates exhibited no detectable leak expression and responded to the addition of the tetracycline analog doxycycline to the medium with Bγ protein levels that were 5–10-fold higher than could be achieved by transient transfection of CMV-promoter driven cDNAs. In agreement with transient transfection studies, doxycycline treatment for 36–48 h resulted in robust neurite outgrowth; however, neurites appeared somewhat shorter than in NGF-treated sister cultures (Fig.3 A). To test whether Bγ causes the growth arrest characteristic of neuronal differentiation, cells lines were incubated for 4 days with doxycycline, NGF, or vehicle alone and assayed for DNA synthesis by pulse-labeling with [3H]thymidine. Cell line 275, which expresses high inducible levels of Bγ, responded to doxycycline or NGF treatment with a ∼50% decrease in [3H]thymidine incorporation (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, cell line 280, which was isolated in parallel but failed to induce Bγ, showed decreased DNA synthesis only when cultured in NGF, demonstrating that doxycycline itself does not slow down growth. Cell line 275 was next analyzed for neuronal protein expression. Doxycycline or NGF but not vehicle treatment for 4 days induced high levels of neurofilament heavy chain protein (Fig.3 C). Bγ must incorporate into the PP2A heterotrimer to escape degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (11Strack S. Ruediger R. Walter G. Dagda R.K. Barwacz C.A. Cribbs J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20750-20755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The percentage of endogenous A and C subunits that associates with inducibly expressed Bγ was determined by quantitative immunoprecipitation. PP2A holoenzymes containing Bγ were estimated to comprise 5% of the total PP2A pool in the inducible PC6-3 line 275 (Fig. 3 D). Thus, incorporation of Bγ into a minor pool of PP2A holoenzymes is sufficient for NGF-independent neuronal differentiation of PC6-3 cells. It is well established that activation of the MAP kinase signaling cascade is both necessary and sufficient for neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells (26Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar). This also holds for the PC12-derived PC6-3 cell line, because the MEK inhibitor U0126 blocks NGF-induced neurite outgrowth (Fig.5 B), and transfection of a constitutively active MEK1 mutant promotes neuritogenesis, growth arrest, and neurofilament expression (data not shown). Because of the pivotal role of this signaling cascade in neuronal differentiation, a possible activation of the MAP kinase signaling by Bγ was investigated. PC6-3 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding different PP2A regulatory subunits or empty vector in combination with reporter plasmids that read out ERK-dependent activation of the transcription factor Elk1 (Elk1 PathDetect Trans-reporter assay, Stratagene). Transfection of Bγ, but not any other regulatory subunit tested, resulted in robust activation of the MAP kinase reporter (Fig.4 A, 15.1 ± 2.6-fold activation, n = 13 experiments). Activation was not only subunit- but also cell line-specific, because Bγ had no effect on ERK activity in HEK293 and COS-M6 cells even though Bγ could be expressed to significantly higher levels in these non-neuronal cell lines (Fig. 4 B). MAP kinase activation by Bγ in PC6-3 cells was comparable to stimulation with low (∼ 1 ng/ml) NGF concentrations, and a combination of both treatments resulted in more than additive induction of Elk1-mediated luciferase activity (Fig.4 C). Fig. 4 D illustrates this effect over a range of NGF concentrations. Bγ transfection caused a leftward shift of the NGF dose-response curve, enhancing MAP kinase signaling from 2-fold at saturating NGF concentrations to 12-fold in the absence of NGF in this experiment.Figure 4Bγ activates MAP kinase signaling. PC6-3 (A–D), HEK293 (B), and COS-M6 (B) cells were cotransfected with the indicated expression vectors and plasmids that report ERK/MAP kinase activity by luciferase expression and then assayed 36–48 h later for reporter activity. PC6-3 cells in C and D were treated for 6 h with the indicated NGF concentrations prior to the assay. Shown are the means ± S.E. of normalized activities from triplicate transfections of a representative experiment. For the experiment in B, cells transfected with empty vector (−) or Bγ (+, duplicate loading) were also analyzed for FLAG- Bγ, PP2A catalytic (C) subunit, and B-Raf expression by immunoblotting. E, PC6-3 line 275 was treated for 24 h in the presence of vehicle (−) or doxycycline (+Dox, 1 μg/ml) to induce Bγ expression. Cells were then stimulated for 5 min with the indicated concentrations of NGF and analyzed for ERK phosphorylation by immunoblotting total lysates for phosphorylated (pERK1, pERK2) and total ERK1/2. The inset shows a representative blot of cells treated without NGF. ERK phosphorylation was quantified by densitometry as the ratio of phosphoreactivity to total immunoreactivity normalized to control. The means ± standard deviation of duplicate pERK2 determinations from a representative experiment are plotted. ERK1 phosphorylation followed an almost identical dose response. F, PC6-3 line 275 was induced to express Bγ by the addition of doxycycline (1 μg/ml) or treated with NGF (20 ng/ml) for 9–96 h. Total lysates were immunoblotted for the indicated proteins, and ERK1/2 phosphorylation was quantified as described for panel E (average of duplicate determinations from a representative experiment). Significant increases over control: *, p < 0.05, **,p < 0.005.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Tetracycline-inducible PC6-3 cells were used to investigate whether Bγ activates MAP kinase signaling by stimulating ERK phosphorylation of activation loop residues (Thr-202 and Tyr-204 in human ERK1). Cells treated for 24 h in the absence or presence of doxycycline to induce Bγ expression were challenged for 5 min with increasing concentrations of NGF, and ERK1/2 phosphorylation was assayed by immunoblotting lysates with a phosphorylation-state specific antibody (Fig. 4 E).

S., Fukuda, M., Ariga, H., and Mikoshiba, K. (2002)J. Biol. Chem. 277, 9212–9218; Fukuda, M., Kuroda, T. S., and Mikoshiba, K. (2002) J. Biol. Chem.277, 12432–12436). The SHD consists of two conserved α-helical regions (SHD1 and SHD2) that are often separated by two zinc finger motifs. However, the structural basis of Rab27A recognition by the SHD (i.e. involvement of each region (SHD1, zinc finger motifs, and SHD2) in Rab27A recognition and critical residue(s) for Rab27A/SHD interaction) had never been elucidated. In this study, systematic deletion analysis and Ala-based site-directed mutagenesis showed that SHD1 of Slac2-a/melanophilin alone is both necessary and sufficient for high affinity specific recognition of the GTP-bound form of Rab27A. By contrast, the zinc finger motifs and SHD2 are not an autonomous Rab27A-binding site and seem to be important for stabilization of the structure of the SHD or higher affinity Rab27A binding. In addition, chimeric analysis of Rab3A and Rab27A showed that the specific sequence of the switch II region of Rab27 isoforms (especially Leu-84, Phe-88, and Asp-91 of Rab27A), which is not conserved in the Rab3 or Rab8 isoforms, is essential for recognition by the Slac2-a SHD. Based on these findings, I propose that SHD1 of the Slp and Slac2 families be referred to as RBD27 (Rab-bindingdomain specific for Rab27 isoforms).

In this study, systematic deletion analyses combined with Ala-based site-directed mutagenesis showed that SHD1 of Slac2-a alone is both necessary and sufficient for recognition of the GTP-bound form of Rab27A, and the zinc finger motifs were shown to be important for protein stability of the SHD and SHD2 for higher affinity binding to Rab27A (16Kuroda T.S.

J. 1997; 323: 421-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The blots and gels shown in the figures are representative of at least two or three independent experiments. The SHD of Slac2-a consists of three regions, SHD1, zinc finger motifs, and SHD2 (Fig.1 A) (15Fukuda M. Saegusa C. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and SHD1 and SHD2 are predicted to form an α-helix by Chou and Fasman secondary structure analysis (DNASIS Version 3.6, Hitachi Software Engineering Co., Ltd.), the same as the Rab3A-binding domain of rabphilin (31Ostermeier C. Brunger A.T. Cell. 1999; 96: 363-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). However, the contributions of each region of the Slac2-a SHD to Rab27A recognition had never been elucidated. To determine which regions in the SHD of Slac2-a function as the minimal essential region for recognition of the GTP-bound form of Rab27A, systematic deletion analyses were performed (Fig. 1 A); and because the protein expression levels of several deletion mutants (T7-Slac2-a-SHD1, T7-Slac2-a-Zn2+, and T7-Slac2-a-SHD2) in COS-7 cells were extremely low compared with that of the whole SHD molecule (data not shown), a GST tag was added to the N terminus to stabilize these mutants (T7-GST-Slac2-a-SHD1, T7-GST-Slac2-a-Zn2+, and T7-GST-Slac2-a-SHD2). Because the expression levels of other mutants (T7-Slac2-a-ΔSHD1, T7-Slac2-a-ΔSHD2, and T7-Slac2-a-SHD(CA)) were also lower than that of the whole SHD molecule (data not shown), four times greater amounts of mutant plasmids (2 μg) than that of the whole SHD plasmid (0.5 μg) were used for transfection to express equivalent amounts of T7-tagged proteins in the cell lysates (Fig. 1 B, lower panel). As shown in Fig. 1 B (middle panel), SHD1 alone, but not the zinc finger motifs or SHD2, was sufficient for Rab27A binding (compare lanes 2–4). To further determine whether SHD1 alone is sufficient for specific recognition of Rab27A, the SHD mutants containing SHD1 were processed for specific Rab binding experiments. To my surprise, SHD1 alone specifically recognized Rab27A, but not Rab3A, Rab8A, or Rab10 (Fig.2 D, lane 4), the same as the whole SHD. SHD1 alone also recognized Rab27A(Q78L), a dominant-active form that mimics the GTP-bound state, but not Rab27A(T23N), a dominant-negative form that mimics the GDP-bound state (Fig. 3 D, lanes 1and 2). I therefore concluded that SHD1 alone is both necessary and sufficient for specific recognition of the GTP-bound form of Rab27A.Figure 3SHD1 of Slac2-a functions as a GTP-Rab27A-binding site. A–D, pEF-T7-Slac2-a mutants and pEF-FLAG-Rab27A(Q78L) or pEF-FLAG-Rab27A(T23N) were cotransfected into COS-7 cells. The proteins expressed were immunoprecipitated with anti-T7 tag antibody-conjugated agarose as described previously (22Fukuda M. Kuroda T.S. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12432-12436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar,32Fukuda M. Kanno E. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol.

Co-immunoprecipitated FLAG-Rab proteins were first detected with HRP-conjugated anti-FLAG tag antibody (1:10,000 dilution) (B–D, upper panels). The same blots were stripped and reprobed with HRP-conjugated anti-T7 tag antibody to ensure that the same amounts of mutant T7-Slac2-a proteins had been loaded (B–D, lower panels). Total expressed FLAG-Rab27A proteins (0.0125 volumes of reaction mixtures; input) used for immunoprecipitation are shown in A. Note that SHD1 alone is sufficient for recognition of Rab27A(Q78L), a dominant-active form that mimics the GTP-bound form (lane 1), but not Rab27A(T23N), a dominant-negative form that mimics the GDP-bound form (lane 2).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To identify the critical residues for Rab27A binding in SHD1 of Slac2-a, the amino acid sequences of various SHD1 domains from the Slp and Slac2 families were first compared (Fig.4 A), and Ala-based site-directed mutagenesis was performed with the initial focus on six highly conserved amino acids in SHD1 (Glu-14, Val-18, Val-21, Arg-24, Glu-32, and Leu-39 of Slac2-a) (Fig. 4 A,arrowheads). However, mutation to an Ala residue never greatly altered the α-helical propensity of SHD1 by secondary structure prediction (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 4 B, Glu-14, Val-18, Val-21, and Glu-32 were found to be essential for Rab27A binding, whereas mutation of Arg-24 and Leu-39 had little effect on Rab27A binding. It should be pointed out that a small deletion (amino acids 31–37 of Slac2-a) in SHD1 has been found inleaden mice, which exhibit a lighter coat color (i.e. accumulation of melanosomes in the perinuclear region) due to defects in melanosome transport (Fig. 4 A, solid line) (26Matesic L.E. Yip R. Reuss A.E. Swing D.A. O'Sullivan T.N. Fletcher C.F. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10238-10243Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Because the deletion contains one of the critical residues for Rab27A binding (Glu-32), I hypothesized that Slac2-a inleaden mice is unable to recognize Rab27A on the melanosome. As expected, neither Slac2-a-SHD(leaden) nor full-length Slac2-a(leaden) bound Rab27A (Fig. 4, C andD, middle panels), whereas both wild-type and mutant Slac2-a(leaden) did bind myosin Va (Fig.4 D, upper panel). These results indicate that the defect in melanosome transport observed in leaden mice is attributable to lack of Rab27A binding (i.e. inability to form the tripartite protein complex (Rab27A·Slac2-a·myosin Va) essential for melanosome transport) (22Fukuda M.

Although zinc finger motifs themselves are not essential for Rab27A binding, they are often found between SHD1 and SHD2 in the Slp and Slac2 families and thus should have an important role in the SHD. Interestingly, the zinc finger motifs of the SHD exhibited weak homology to the FYVE domain of early endosome antigen-1 (Fig.5 A, asterisks), a recently identified phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate-binding domain (42Mu F.T.

Two independent phospholipid binding assays were performed (liposome sedimentation and dot-blot assays) to determine whether the zinc finger motifs of the Slac2-a SHD function as a phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate-binding domain, but no significant phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate-binding activity of the Slac2-a SHD was observed (data not shown). Because the protein expression level of the Slac2-a-SHD(CA) mutant was always much lower than that of the wild-type protein, as noted above, I next evaluated the protein stability property of the Slac2-a-SHD(CA) mutant by limited proteolysis (Fig. 5 B). To do so, both the wild-type and mutant SHDs were first purified with anti-T7 tag antibody-conjugated agarose (16Kuroda T.S. Fukuda M. Ariga H. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9212-9218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). At low trypsin concentrations (5 ng/ml), both wild-type and mutant T7-Slac2-a-SHD (Fig. 5 B, arrows) were resistant to trypsin (lane 2). At 10 ng/ml trypsin, wild-type T7-Slac2-a-SHD was still resistant; and an ∼16–17-kDa tryptic fragment of the Slac2-a SHD was protected (Fig. 5 B, upper panel,lanes 3 and 4, asterisk), but it was not detected at 100–500 ng/ml trypsin. By contrast, the Slac2-a-SHD(CA) mutant was rapidly degraded at 10 ng/ml trypsin (Fig.5 B, lower panel, lane 3). These results indicate that the zinc finger motifs of the Slac2-a SHD are involved in the stability property of the SHD rather than in Rab27A recognition. Finally, I attempted to determine structural determinants on the Rab27A·SHD complex in Rab27A. Because rabphilin recognizes Rab3A, Rab8A, and Rab27A, whereas Slac2-a recognizes only Rab27 isoforms (16Kuroda T.S. Fukuda M. Ariga H. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9212-9218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 22Fukuda M. Kuroda T.S. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12432-12436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), the amino acid sequences of Rab3A/B/C/D, Rab8A/B, and Rab27A/B were first compared (Fig.6 A). Several amino acids were found to be conserved only in the Rab27 isoforms, and not in the Rab3 or Rab8 isoforms (e.g. Glu-48, Asp-91, Cys-123, and Cys-188 in Rab27A). Among these residues, I especially focused on the amino acids present in the switch I and switch II regions because, in the rabphilin·Rab3A complex, these two regions of Rab3A directly interact with the α1-helix of rabphilin (31Ostermeier C. Brunger A.T. Cell. 1999; 96: 363-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), which corresponds to SHD1 of Slac2-a. When three amino acids (Leu-84, Phe-88, and Asp-91) in the switch II region of Rab27A were mutated (Rab27A(L84I/F88Y/D91G), carrying the Rab3- and Rab8-type switch II regions) (Fig.6 A), Slac2-a did not recognize the Rab27A mutant at all (Fig. 6 B, middle panel, lane 6). The single D91G mutation also dramatically reduced the binding activity of Slac2-a (Fig. 6 B, middle panel, lane 3). By contrast, other mutants (E48V, Y122W/C123W, and C188S) including the switch I mutant had little effect on the Rab27A/SHD interaction. More importantly, the Rab27A(D91G) and Rab27A(L84I/F88Y/D91G) mutants were found to be recognized by rabphilin (Fig. 6 B, middle panel, lanes 8 and9), the same as wild-type Rab3A and Rab27A. These results indicate that the SHD of Slac2-a recognizes specific amino acids (e.g. Asp-91) in the switch II region of Rab27A, whereas the Rab-binding domain of rabphilin more loosely recognizes the switch II region of Rab3A, Rab8A, and Rab27A. The results of this study demonstrate that SHD1 of Slac2-a, a predicted α-helical region (α1), is a critical determinant of high affinity, GTP-dependent, and specific binding of Rab27A, whereas SHD2, another predicted α-helical region (α2), is not an autonomous Rab27A-binding site (Fig.1 B). Actually, SHD2 of the Slp and Slac2 families is not very well conserved compared with SHD1, and only the short (S/T)(G/L)(E/D)WF(Y/F) sequence is conserved at the N terminus of SHD2 (15Fukuda M. Saegusa C. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, a Slac2-a mutant carrying SLEWY-to-ALAAA substitutions in SHD2 (referred to as Slac2-a(A4)) exhibits reduced Rab27A/B-binding activity (22Fukuda M. Kuroda T.S. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12432-12436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Therefore, SHD2 is involved in higher affinity Rab27A binding possibly by stabilizing Rab27A bound to SHD1 rather than recognition of Rab27A itself. The accessory role of SHD2 of Slac2-a in high affinity Rab27A binding seems to be critical under physiological conditions because the expression level of ΔSHD2 protein is very low in COS-7 cells (see above), and all of the Rab27A-binding proteins reported thus far contain both SHD1 and SHD2 (15Fukuda M.

Moreover, a search of the human (and mouse) genome and expressed sequence tag data bases failed to retrieve any other protein(s) containing SHD1 alone without SHD2 (data not shown). The zinc finger motifs are essential for the stability property of the whole SHD of Slac2-a and are not involved in Rab27A binding. Therefore, even without the zinc finger motifs, the SHD of Slp1, Slp2-a, and Slac2-b recognizes Rab27A with high affinity (16Kuroda T.S. Fukuda M. Ariga H. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9212-9218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). How does the SHD of Slac2-a specifically recognize the Rab27 isoforms? Based on the following evidence, I inferred that the fundamental structure of the Rab27A·SHD complex is similar to that of the rabphilin·Rab3A complex previously reported (31Ostermeier C. Brunger A.T. Cell. 1999; 96: 363-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). First, Rab27A is the Rab that is phylogenetically closest to the Rab3 isoforms (6Pereira-Leal J.B. Seabra M.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 889-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar), and the SHD of Slac2-a exhibits significant homology to the Rab3A-binding domain of rabphilin and shares the same domain structures (α1, two zinc motifs, and α2) (16Kuroda T.S. Fukuda M. Ariga H. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9212-9218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 26Matesic L.E. Yip R. Reuss A.E. Swing D.A. O'Sullivan T.N.

Cell. 1999; 96: 363-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Second, the N-terminal α-helical region (α1) of Rim1 and rabphilin, corresponding to SHD1, but not the zinc finger motifs or α2, is the minimal essential domain for Rab3A binding (48Wang X., Hu, B. Zimmermann B. Kilimann M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32480-32488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 49Sun L. Bittner M.A. Holz R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12911-12917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), the same as SHD1 being critical for Rab27A binding. Third, the α1-region of rabphilin directly interacts with the switch I and switch II regions of Rab3A (Fig. 6 A) (31Ostermeier C. Brunger A.T. Cell. 1999; 96: 363-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Similarly, SHD1 of Slac2-a presumably recognizes specific amino acids in the switch II region of Rab27A (e.g. Leu-84, Phe-88, and Asp-91) because mutation(s) in the switch II region in Rab27A or SHD1 of Slac2-a completely abrogated Rab27A/Slac2-a interaction (Figs. 4 and6). All of these similarities between rabphilin·Rab3A and Rab27A·Slac2-a complexes suggest that the Rab3A-binding domain of rabphilin and Rim1 and the SHD of the Slp and Slac2 families may be derived from a common ancestor and have acquired different Rab-binding specificity during evolution as a result of changes in the nature of the α1-region. Consistent with this, the SHD of the Slp and Slac2 families forms a branch distinct from the Rab3A-binding domain of Rim1, Rim2, rabphilin, and Noc2 in the phylogenetic tree (16Kuroda T.S. Fukuda M. Ariga H. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9212-9218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). One critical determinant of Rab27A recognition by the Slac2-a SHD is a Gly-to-Asp variation in the switch II region of Rab27A (Fig.6 A) because the Rab27A(D91G) mutant hardly bound to the Slac2-a SHD. It should be noted that the corresponding position is occupied by Gly in most other Rab proteins, including Rab3A/B/C/D and Rab8A/B (data not shown). However, the Gly-to-Asp variation in the switch II region should not be sufficient for specific Rab27A recognition by the SHD, and the surrounding sequence around the Gly-to-Asp variation must also be important for its specific recognition. For instance, the Gly-to-Asp variation (boldface) in the switch II region was also found in Rab6 (GQERFRSLIPSYIRDST) and Rab37 (GQERFRSVTHAYYRDAQ), which do not interact with the Slac2-a SHD (16Kuroda T.S. Fukuda M. Ariga H. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9212-9218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar); but the surrounding sequence in the switch II region of these Rab proteins is different from that in Rab27A (e.g. di-Phe residues are missing in Rab6 and Rab37, and YI or YY residues occupy the corresponding positions (underlined above)). Therefore, the SHD of Slac2-a is likely to recognize a specific sequence in the switch II region of the Rab27 isoforms (i.e.Leu-84, Phe-88, and Asp-91 of Rab27A/B). Additional three-dimensional analysis is necessary to determine the involvement of each of the amino acids in the switch II region of Rab27A in the recognition by the SHD. In summary, I have demonstrated that SHD1 of Slac2-a alone, but not the zinc finger motifs or SHD2, is both necessary and sufficient for high affinity specific recognition of the GTP-bound form of Rab27A, and I propose that SHD1 of the Slp and Slac2 families be referred to as RBD27 (Rab-binding domain specific for Rab27 isoforms).

https://openalex.org/W1988569065,"Matrix metalloproteinase-14 is required for degradation of fibrillar collagen by mesenchymal cells. Here we show that keratinocytes use an alternative plasminogen and matrix metalloproteinase-13-dependent pathway for dissolution of collagen fibrils. Primary keratinocytes displayed an absolute requirement for serum to dissolve collagen. Dissolution of collagen was abolished in plasminogen-depleted serum and could be restored by the exogenous addition of plasminogen. Both plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase blocked collagen dissolution, demonstrating the requirement of both plasminogen activation and matrix metalloproteinase activity for degradation. Cell surface plasmin activity was critical for the degradation process as aprotinin, but not α2-antiplasmin, prevented collagen dissolution. Keratinocytes with single deficiencies in either urokinase or tissue plasminogen activator retained the ability to dissolve collagen. However, collagen fibril dissolution was abolished in keratinocytes with a combined deficiency in both urokinase and tissue plasminogen activator. Combined, but not single, urokinase and tissue plasminogen activator deficiency also completely blocked the activation of the fibrillar collagenase, matrix metalloproteinase-13, by keratinocytes. The activation of matrix metalloproteinase-13 in normal keratinocytes was prevented by plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and aprotinin but not by tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 and -2, suggesting that plasmin activates matrix metalloproteinase-13 directly. We propose that plasminogen activation facilitates keratinocyte-mediated collagen breakdown via the direct activation of matrix metalloproteinase-13 and possibly other fibrillar collagenases. Matrix metalloproteinase-14 is required for degradation of fibrillar collagen by mesenchymal cells. Here we show that keratinocytes use an alternative plasminogen and matrix metalloproteinase-13-dependent pathway for dissolution of collagen fibrils. Primary keratinocytes displayed an absolute requirement for serum to dissolve collagen. Dissolution of collagen was abolished in plasminogen-depleted serum and could be restored by the exogenous addition of plasminogen. Both plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase blocked collagen dissolution, demonstrating the requirement of both plasminogen activation and matrix metalloproteinase activity for degradation. Cell surface plasmin activity was critical for the degradation process as aprotinin, but not α2-antiplasmin, prevented collagen dissolution. Keratinocytes with single deficiencies in either urokinase or tissue plasminogen activator retained the ability to dissolve collagen. However, collagen fibril dissolution was abolished in keratinocytes with a combined deficiency in both urokinase and tissue plasminogen activator. Combined, but not single, urokinase and tissue plasminogen activator deficiency also completely blocked the activation of the fibrillar collagenase, matrix metalloproteinase-13, by keratinocytes. The activation of matrix metalloproteinase-13 in normal keratinocytes was prevented by plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and aprotinin but not by tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 and -2, suggesting that plasmin activates matrix metalloproteinase-13 directly. We propose that plasminogen activation facilitates keratinocyte-mediated collagen breakdown via the direct activation of matrix metalloproteinase-13 and possibly other fibrillar collagenases. The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) 1The abbreviations used are: MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; α2-AP, α2-antiplasmin; FBS, fetal bovine serum; IL-1β, interleukin-1β; MT, membrane-type; PA, plasminogen activation; PAI, plasminogen activator inhibitor; Plg, plasminogen; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; tPA, tissue plasminogen activator; uPA, urokinase plasminogen activator; uPAR, uPA receptor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; TIMPs, tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases. constitute a large family of structurally related matrix degrading proteases that have pivotal roles in development, tissue remodeling, and cancer (1Birkedal-Hansen H.

Rinkenberger J.L. Coussens L.M. Acta Pathol. Microbiol. Immunnol. Scand. 1999; 107: 11-18Google Scholar). The MMPs share a number of common structural and functional features. All MMPs have essential zinc and calcium ions, are synthesized as zymogens, and are inhibited by tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) in a 1:1 enzyme-inhibitor complex. MMPs have multiple domains that control their secretion, specificity, and substrate binding. The function of the MMPs is also tightly regulated at the level of gene expression, zymogen activation, enzyme activity, and cell surface localization (1Birkedal-Hansen H. Moore W.G. Bodden M.K.

Immunnol. Scand. 1999; 107: 11-18Google Scholar). An intramolecular complex between an unpaired Cys residue in the propeptide domain and the active site zinc inherently blocks the catalytic activity of all MMPs, and this propeptide is removed by endoproteolytic cleavage during MMP activation (6Van Wart H.E. Birkedal-Hansen H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5578-5582Google Scholar). As is the case with most zymogen cascades, many aspects of the mechanisms leading to the activation of pro-MMPs under physiological conditions are still incompletely understood. Membrane-type (MT) MMPs and MMP-11 (stromelysin-3) are equipped with a furin recognition site and are activated by furin or furin-like enzymes in the secretory pathway or on the cell surface (7Pei D. Weiss S.J. Nature. 1995; 375: 244-247Google Scholar). Most MMPs, however, do not contain a furin recognition site, and their activation appears to be dependent on propeptide cleavage by MT-MMPs, MMP-11, plasmin (see below), and possibly other serine proteases (8Strongin A.Y. Collier I. Bannikov G. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5331-5338Google Scholar, 9Knauper V. Will H. Lopez-Otin C. Smith B. Atkinson S.J. Stanton H. Hembry R.M.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1382-1397Google Scholar). The plasminogen activation (PA) system represents a second extracellular proteolytic system with pleiotropic functions in physiological and pathological tissue remodeling (11Dano K. Romer J. Nielsen B.S. Bjorn S. Pyke C. Rygaard J. Lund L.R. Acta Pathol. Microbiol. Immunnol. Scand. 1999; 107: 120-127Google Scholar, 12Andreasen P.A. Kjoller L. Christensen L. Duffy M.J. Int. J.

The PA system is a complex system of serine proteases, protease inhibitors, and protease receptors that governs the conversion of the abundant protease zymogen, plasminogen (Plg), to the active serine protease, plasmin. Plg is predominantly produced by the liver and is present in high concentrations in plasma as well as most extravascular fluids (14Dano K. Andreasen P.A. Grondahl-Hansen J. Kristensen P. Nielsen L.S. Skriver L. Adv. Cancer Res. 1985; 44: 139-266Google Scholar). Plasmin is formed by the proteolytic cleavage of Plg by either of two Plg activators, the urokinase Plg activator (uPA) and the tissue Plg activator (tPA). Activation of Plg appears to be strictly associated with the cell surface via the binding to specific receptors, as well as other surfaces that present kinetically favorable circumstances for Plg activation, such as the fibrin thrombus. Surface-generated plasmin, unlike plasmin in solution, is relatively protected from its primary physiological inhibitor α2-antiplasmin (α2-AP) (15Ellis V. Behrendt N. Dano K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12752-12758Google Scholar, 16Plow E.F. Freaney D.E. Plescia J. Miles L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2411-2420Google Scholar, 17Hall S.W. Humphries J.E. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12329-12336Google Scholar). Cell surface Plg activation by uPA and tPA is regulated by two physiological inhibitors, Plg activator inhibitor-1 and -2 (PAI-1 and PAI-2) (18Cubellis M.V. Andreasen P. Ragno P. Mayer M. Dano K. Blasi F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4828-4832Google Scholar, 19Ellis V. Wun T.C. Behrendt N. Ronne E. Dano K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9904-9908Google Scholar, 20Baker M.S. Bleakley P. Woodrow G.C. Doe W.F. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 4676-4684Google Scholar), each forming a 1:1 complex with uPA and tPA. The functional association between the MMPs and the PA system, in particular the role of plasmin as a pro-MMP activator, has generated substantial attention in the context of both physiological and pathological tissue remodeling. The MMPs and components of the PA system are co-expressed with remarkable consistency during development, tissue remodeling, tissue repair, and in multiple diseases such as tumor invasion, metastasis, arthritis, vessel wall disease, and neurodegenerative diseases (2McCawley L.J.

Moreover, numerous studies have demonstrated that plasmin can contribute to the proteolytic activation of pro-MMP-1, -2, -3, -9, -10, -12, and -13in vitro (29Woessner J.F. Nagase H. Matrix Metalloproteinases and TIMPs. Oxford University Press, Oxford1996Google Scholar). A less clear picture of plasmin as a pro-MMP activator has emerged from cell-based assays. Plasmin has been reported to be both a poor activator and a very efficient activator of MMP-9 (23Lijnen H.R. Van Hoef B. Lupu F. Moons L. Carmeliet P. Collen D. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

Macrophage and endothelial cell-produced uPA contributes to MMP-1 and -13 activation via the activation of Plg (21Carmeliet P. Moons L. Lijnen R. Baes M. Lemaitre V. Tipping P. Drew A. Eeckhout Y.

Plasmin can also activate MMP-13 in fibroblast cultures. The interstitial, fibrillar type I–III collagens are the most abundant proteins in connective tissues. These collagen monomers consist of three polypeptide chains, which contain a single long uninterrupted section of Gly-X-Yrepeats. The three helical chains are intertwined to produce a tight superhelix that buries the peptide bonds within the interior of the helix. The fibrillar collagens spontaneously self-associate to form fibrils that range in diameter from 10 to 300 nm (33Linsenmayer T.F. Hay E.D. Cell Biology of Extracellular Matrix. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1991: 7-44Google Scholar, 34Van der R.M. Garrone R. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2814-2823Google Scholar). This unique supramolecular organization makes fibrillar collagens resistant to degradation by most proteases. However, once cleaved within their triple helical domain, collagens quickly denature and are easily hydrolyzed by a variety of proteases. Several molecular pathways exist for the dissolution of collagen fibrils. One pathway is intracellular and involves the phagocytosis of collagen fibrils via integrin receptors, followed by the degradation of the internalized collagen in the lysosome (35Segal G. Lee W. Arora P.D. McKee M. Downey G. McCulloch C.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 119-129Google Scholar). A second, cathepsin-mediated, pathway for collagen degradation takes place in the acidic microenvironment that underlies osteoclasts during bone resorption (36Gelb B.D. Shi G.P. Chapman H.A. Desnick R.J. Science. 1996; 273: 1236-1238Google Scholar, 37Saftig P. Hunziker E. Wehmeyer O. Jones S. Boyde A. Rommerskirch W. Moritz J.D. Schu P. von Figura K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13453-13458Google Scholar). However, a subset of the MMPs, the collagenases, are attributed with being primarily responsible for the initial cleavage of interstitial collagen fibrils under normal and pathological conditions (1Birkedal-Hansen H. Moore W.G. Bodden M.K. Windsor L.J. Birkedal-Hansen B. DeCarlo A. Engler J.A. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1993; 4: 197-250Google Scholar). They do so in a highly specific manner, cleaving all three chains of the collagen monomer at a specific locus located approximately three-quarters from the N terminus (38Birkedal-Hansen H. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 144: 140-171Google Scholar, 39Mookhtiar K.A. Van Wart H.E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10620-10627Google Scholar, 40Knauper V. Lopez-Otin C. Smith B. Knight G. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1544-1550Google Scholar). While it was previously believed that only the “genuine” collagenases, MMP-1, -8, and -13, were capable of hydrolyzing fibrillar collagens, other members of the MMP family have now been reported to display “triple-helicase” activity, including MMP-2 and the membrane type MMPs (MT-MMPs) (41Aimes R.T.

Collectively, these studies have demonstrated a pivotal role of MT1-MMP (MMP-14) in mesenchymal cell-mediated collagen turnover. In this paper, we report the identification of an alternative, keratinocyte-specific, pathway for collagenase activation and fibrillar collagen dissolution that requires Plg activation and MMP-13.

The genotype of all pups was determined by PCR using DNA derived from ear or tail biopsies as described previously (43Holmbeck K. Bianco P. Caterina J. Yamada S. Kromer M. Kuznetsov S.A. Mankani M.

Primary human skin keratinocytes were isolated from human neonatal foreskin (Cooperative Human Tissue Network) as described previously (51Pentland A.P. Needleman P. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 77: 246-251Google Scholar). Briefly, the tissue was cut into 4–5-mm pieces and floated dermis side down on 0.25% trypsin in Dulbecco's PBS solution overnight at 4 °C. The epidermal layer was peeled away from the dermis and further dissociated by pipetting up and down 10 times in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 20% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), supplemented with 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 1 nm cholera toxin, 0.4 μg/ml hydrocortisone, and penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). The cell suspension was seeded into tissue culture flasks. The medium was replaced the following day with Defined Keratinocyte-SFM (Invitrogen). Primary murine skin keratinocytes were isolated from the epidermis of 1–3-day-old mice essentially as described previously (52Yuspa S.H. Skerrow D. Skerrow C. Methods in Skin Research. John Wiley and Sons, Ltd., Chichester, UK1985: 213-249Google Scholar). Briefly, the skin of newborn mice was floated overnight at 4 °C with the dermis facing down in 0.25% trypsin in Dulbecco's PBS solution (Invitrogen). The epidermal layer was then peeled away from the dermis with sterile forceps. To release the partially dissociated keratinocytes, the epidermis was minced with forceps and pipetted up and down 10 times in minimum Eagle's medium without calcium chloride (BioWhittaker, Inc., Walkersville, MD) supplemented with 8% Chelex-treated heat-inactivated FBS (HyClone Laboratories Inc., Logan, UT), 1.3 mm CaCl2, and penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). The cell suspension was then filtered through a 70-μm cell strainer to remove the stratum corneum, and the filtered suspension was seeded into tissue culture plates for 4 h at 37 °C in a humidified 7% CO2-buffered tissue culture incubator. The medium was then replaced with minimum Eagle's medium with 8% Chelex-treated, heat-inactivated FBS, containing 0.05 mm CaCl2, and penicillin/streptomycin. Primary murine skin fibroblasts were isolated from the dermis as described previously (43Holmbeck K. Bianco P. Caterina J. Yamada S. Kromer M. Kuznetsov S.A. Mankani M. Robey P.G. Poole A.R. Pidoux I. Ward J.M. Birkedal-Hansen H. Cell. 1999; 99: 81-92Google Scholar). Briefly, the skin of newborn mice was floated dermis side down on 0.25% trypsin in Dulbecco's PBS solution (Invitrogen) overnight at 4 °C. The dermis was dissociated by forcing it through a 3-ml syringe. The cell suspension was seeded in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 50% heat-inactivated FBS and penicillin/streptomycin. The serum concentration was gradually reduced to 10%, and the fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% heat-inactivated FBS and penicillin/streptomycin. The assay has been described recently and discussed in detail (53.Windsor, L. J., Havemose-Poulsen, A., Yamada, S., Lyons, J. G., Birkedal-Hansen, B., Stetler-Stevenson, W. G., and Birkedal-Hansen, H. (2002) (Morgan, K., ed) Matrix Metalloproteinases. Current Protocols in Cell Biology, in press.Google Scholar). Briefly, 24-well tissue culture plates were coated with type I collagen derived from rat tails (kindly provided by Dr. Jack Windsor, Indianapolis) as described previously (45Havemose-Poulsen A. Holmstrup P. Stoltze K. Birkedal-Hansen H. J. Periodontal Res. 1998; 33: 280-291Google Scholar), and 0.37 ml of 300 μg/ml collagen was added to each well for 2 h at 37 °C. The collagen film was then dried down, and the salt was removed by distilled water to leave a thin hydrated layer of collagen fibrils. The integrity of the collagen fibrils was verified by incubation of the film with either 25 mg/ml trypsin (Invitrogen), 20 ng/ml MMP-9 (kindly provided by Dr. William Stetler-Stevenson, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda), or 20 ng/ml MMP-1 (kindly provided by Dr. Jack Windsor, University of Indianapolis) at 37 °C for 4 h and staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue as described below. Keratinocytes were grown in Defined Keratinocyte-SFM supplemented with 1.0 or 1.3 mmCaCl2, and fibroblasts were grown in Opti-MEM (both from Invitrogen). Thirty thousand cells in 30 μl of medium were applied to the center of each well, and the cells were allowed to attach to the collagen layer for 5 h at 37 °C. Thereafter, the cells were incubated in 1 ml of medium with or without the following additions: 10% heat-inactivated FBS (HyClone Laboratories), 20 nmGlu-Plg, 50 nm mutant murine PAI-1, 40 nmaprotinin, 200 nm α2-AP (all fromCalbiochem-Novabiochem), 5 nm tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), 2.5 nm interleukin-1β (IL-1β) (PeproTech, Inc., Rocky Hill, NJ), 160 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (Sigma), 200 nm TIMP-1 (kindly provided by Dr. Jack Windsor, Indianapolis), or 200 nmTIMP-2 (Fuji Chemical Industries, Toyama, Japan). To visualize zones of cell-mediated lysis, the cells were removed by a trypsin/EDTA solution (Invitrogen) containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 (Sigma). The wells were then stained with 0.5% (w/v) Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 for 5 min and rinsed with distilled water. Murine keratinocytes were grown in Defined Keratinocyte-SFM supplemented with 1.3 mmCaCl2 for 18 h in the presence or absence of 5 nm TNF-α and 2.5 nm IL-1β. Murine fibroblasts were grown in Opti-MEM for 15 h in the presence or absence of 5 nm TNF-α and 2.5 nm IL-1β. Total RNA was isolated from the keratinocytes using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA (5 μg/lane) was separated by electrophoresis on 1% agarose-formaldehyde gels and transferred to Nytran membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) by capillary blotting. The following DNA fragments were used as probes: full-length murine MMP-2, MMP-9, and MMP-13 cDNAs (54Henriet P. Rousseau G.G. Eeckhout Y. FEBS Lett. 1992; 310: 175-178Google Scholar, 55Blavier L.

The cDNA fragments were radiolabeled with [32P]dCTP by random prime labeling using the Random Primed DNA Labeling Kit (Roche Diagnostics) and purified on ProbeQuant G-50 columns (Amersham Biosciences). Prehybridization was carried out at 65 °C in 10 ml of Quickhyb (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The labeled DNA probe was boiled in 1 mg of salmon sperm DNA (Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL) and then added to the QuikHyb solution after 30 min of prehybridization. Hybridization was carried out for 2 h at 65 °C. The membranes were washed 3 times for 20 min each in 2× SSC with 1% SDS at 65 °C and exposed overnight to a PhosphorImager screen (Amersham Biosciences). Twenty five μl of conditioned medium from murine keratinocytes that were grown for 5 days on collagen-coated plates was resolved under reducing conditions by SDS-PAGE on 4–12% NuPAGE BisTris gels (NOVEX, San Diego, CA). The medium contained equivalent amounts of total protein as estimated by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. The separated proteins were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell), blocked with 5% nonfat milk and 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma) in PBS, and probed with an anti-MMP-13 monoclonal antibody, LIPCO IID1 (Labvision Inc., Fremont, CA). Rat pro-MMP-13 (Labvision) and active rat MMP-13 (a kind gift from Dr. Jack Windsor, Indianapolis) were used as controls for the migration of the two forms of MMP-13. Plg/plasmin fragments were detected with a polyclonal rabbit antibody to human plasminogen, A0081 (Dako Inc., Carpinteria, CA). Antibody bound to the membrane was detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or rabbit secondary antibody (Dako Inc., Carpinteria, CA), followed by exposure to Renaissance Solutions (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) or a Western Breeze kit (Invitrogen) and visualization by autoradiography. Serum-free conditioned medium (25 μl/lane) was resolved by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions on a 12% gel that incorporated 1% boiled, nonfat dry milk, with or without 20 μg/ml Plg (58Sawaya R. Highsmith R. J. Neurosurg. 1988; 68: 73-79Google Scholar). The gel was washed twice for 30 min each in 2.5% Triton X-100 to remove SDS and renature proteins and developed overnight in 0.1 m glycine, pH 8.0, at 37 °C. The gel was stained with 0.1% Amido Black (Bio-Rad) and destained in 30% methanol and 10% acetic acid solution to visualize the zones of lysis. Conditioned medium from cytokine-stimulated keratinocyte cultures was incubated for 1 h with purified α2-macroglobulin (55 nm final concentration) at room temperature. The samples were incubated for 3 h in SDS sample buffer with 5% mercaptoethanol and the protein complexes resolved on 4–12% NuPAGE gels, and MMP-13-α2-macroglobulin protein complexes were visualized by Western blot analysis with MMP-13 antibodies as described above. We used a previously described cell-mediated collagen fibril film dissolution assay (53.Windsor, L. J., Havemose-Poulsen, A., Yamada, S., Lyons, J. G., Birkedal-Hansen, B., Stetler-Stevenson, W. G., and Birkedal-Hansen, H. (2002) (Morgan, K., ed) Matrix Metalloproteinases. Current Protocols in Cell Biology, in press.Google Scholar), to study the ability of primary keratinocytes and fibroblasts to degrade fibrillar collagen. The film was easily degraded by incubation with purified MMP-1 but resistant to degradation by both purified trypsin and MMP-9, confirming the integrity of the triple helical collagen fibrils (data not shown). Human primary keratinocytes degraded this collagen fibril film when stimulated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or cytokines to induce MMP expression (Fig. 1, panel A, and data not shown). As shown previously for fibroblasts (43Holmbeck K. Bianco P. Caterina J. Yamada S. Kromer M. Kuznetsov S.A. Mankani M. Robey P.G. Poole A.R. Pidoux I. Ward J.M. Birkedal-Hansen H. Cell. 1999; 99: 81-92Google Scholar), collagen breakdown took place exclusively under the layer of seeded cells and occurred in the presence of serum. Collagen degradation was prevented by the exogenous addition of both TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 to the medium, demonstrating the critical role of MMPs in the process. Surprisingly, however, collagen dissolution was also completely blocked by the addition of PAI-1, suggesting a specific requirement of Plg activators in the process. To further investigate the possible role of the PA system in collagen breakdown by keratinocytes, Plg was depleted from the culture medium by lysine-Sepharose chromatography (59Deutsc"
https://openalex.org/W2104987598,"We here report on the identification and detailed biochemical characterization of two novel GTPase-activating proteins, Gyp5p and Gyp8p, whose efficient substrate is Ypt1p, a Ypt/Rab-GTPase essential for endoplasmic reticulum-to-Golgi trafficking in yeast. Gyp5p accelerated the intrinsic GTPase activity of Ypt1p 4.2 × 104-fold and, surprisingly, the 40-fold reduced GTP hydrolysis rate of Ypt1(Q67L)p 1.5 × 104-fold. At steady state, the two newly discovered GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) as well as the previously described Gyp1p, which also uses Ypt1p as the preferred substrate, display different subcellular localization. To add to an understanding of the significance of Ypt1p-bound GTP hydrolysis in vivo, yeast strains expressing the GTPase-deficient Ypt1(Q67L)p and having different Ypt1-GAP genes deleted were created. Depending on the genetic background, different mutants exhibited growth defects at low temperature and, already at permissive temperature, various morphological alterations resembling autophagy. Transport of proteins was not significantly impaired. Growth defects of Ypt1(Q67L)-expressing cells could be suppressed on high expression of all three Ypt1-GAPs. We propose that permanently active Ypt1p leads to increased vesicle fusion, which might induce previously unnoticed autophagic degradation of exaggerated membrane-enclosed structures. The data indicate that hydrolysis of Ypt1p-bound GTP is a prerequisite for a balanced vesicle flow between endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi compartments.

The data indicate that hydrolysis of Ypt1p-bound GTP is a prerequisite for a balanced vesicle flow between endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi compartments. In eukaryotic cells, a large number of newly synthesized proteins and of proteins internalized from the plasma membrane pass through membrane-enclosed compartments to reach their final destination. Transport between organelles of the biosynthetic and the endocytic pathway involves vesicular intermediates that fuse with specific target compartments to deliver their cargo (1Mellman I. Warren G. Cell. 2000; 100: 99-112Google Scholar). Transport vesicle formation and targeting require complex molecular machines, and different Ras-like GTPases act as key regulators in assembling specific protein complexes at different donor and target membranes (2Barlowe C. Orci L. Yeung T. Hosobuchi M. Hamamoto S. Salama N. Rexach M.F. Ravazzola M. Amherdt M. Schekman R. Cell. 1994; 77: 895-907Google Scholar, 3Guo W. Sacher M. Barrowman J. Ferro-Novick S. Novick P.

Genetic and in vitro transport studies in yeast indicate that Ypt/Rab-GTPases act in tethering transport vesicles to their cognate acceptor membranes before SNARE 1The abbreviations used are: SNARE, solubleN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor; GAP, GTPase-activating protein; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; GFP, green fluorescent protein; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; P10, pellet after 10,000 × g centrifugation; P100, pellet after 100,000 × g centrifugation (high speed pellet); VSV, vesicular stomatitis virus. pairing (5Cao X.C. Ballew N. Barlowe C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2156-2165Google Scholar, 6Wickner W. Haas A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 247-275Google Scholar), but the molecular details of GTPase function are still unresolved. Of the 11 yeast Ypt/Rab family members, only the ones involved in the secretory pathway are essential for cell viability (7Lazar T. Gotte M. Gallwitz D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 468-472Google Scholar). Among them is Ypt1p, the regulator of forward transport between the ER and the Golgi. Ypt1p appears to exert its vesicle tethering function when bound to the target membrane of early Golgi compartment(s) (8Cao X.C. Barlowe C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 55-65Google Scholar). Since Ypt/Rab-GTPases, like Ras, cycle between an active, GTP-bound and an inactive, GDP-bound conformation, GDP-GTP exchange by specific exchange factors (guanine nucleotide exchange factors) and hydrolysis of the bound GTP catalyzed by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) are expected to play important roles in the functioning of these proteins. The hydrolysis of GTP has been associated with either the membrane fusion process itself, with the recycling of the GTPases, or with the role of the GTPase as a timer for membrane fusion (9Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1990; 348: 125-132Google Scholar, 10Rybin V. Ullrich O. Rubino M. Alexandrov K. Simon I. Seabra C. Goody R. Zerial M. Nature. 1996; 383: 266-269Google Scholar). In a perhaps extreme view, it has even been argued that, in the case of Ypt1p, GTP hydrolysis is not important for the protein's function in vesicular transport (11Richardson C.J. Jones S. Litt R.J. Segev N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 827-838Google Scholar). Although Ypt/Rab- GTPases possess a slow intrinsic GTPase activity, which in most cases is significantly slower than 0.01 min−1 at 30 °C (12Will E. Albert S. Gallwitz D. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 329: 50-58Google Scholar), effective down-regulation of the regulators requires specific GTPase-activating proteins. The first Ypt/Rab-specific GAPs, termed Gyp (GAP forYpt proteins), were isolated from yeast by high expression cloning (13Strom M. Vollmer P. Tan T.J. Gallwitz D. Nature. 1993; 361: 736-739Google Scholar, 14Vollmer P. Gallwitz D. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 257: 118-128Google Scholar, 15Vollmer P. Will E. Scheglmann D. Strom M. Gallwitz D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 284-290Google Scholar). It was subsequently noted that these GAPs contained regions of sequence similarity with many proteins of unknown function from yeast and higher eukaryotes (16Neuwald A.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 243-244Google Scholar). This was also helpful for the identification and cloning of other Ypt/Rab-GAPs from yeast (17Albert S. Gallwitz D. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 453-456Google Scholar, 18Albert S. Will E. Gallwitz D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5216-5225Google Scholar, 19Albert S. Gallwitz D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33186-33189Google Scholar, 20Du L.L. Collins R.N. Novick P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3253-3256Google Scholar). So far, six related GAPs from Saccharomyces cerevisiae constitute a protein family that we have termed GYP. Most of the yeast Ypt/Rab-GAPs have a rather broad substrate specificity, but all of them are highly active, accelerating the intrinsic GTP hydrolysis rate of their preferred substrates 104- to 106-fold. Among the six known Gyp proteins, only Gyp1p efficiently uses Ypt1p as substrate in vitro, but this GAP accelerates the intrinsic GTPase activities of Ypt51p, Sec4p, and Ypt7p with similar efficiency (18Albert S. Will E. Gallwitz D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5216-5225Google Scholar, 20Du L.L. Collins R.N. Novick P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3253-3256Google Scholar). The overlapping substrate specificity of GYP family members might explain why the chromosomal deletion of individual GYP genes is phenotypically neutral. Concerning ER-to-Golgi transport, it was also possible that additional Ypt1-GAPs might participate in the regulation of Ypt1p activity. We have now isolated two novel GYP genes whose protein products, Gyp5p and Gyp8p, are potent Ypt1-GAPs. Whereas Gyp5p has a remarkable specificity for Ypt1p in vitro, Ypt6p, which appears to be functionally linked to Ypt1p (21Li B.J. Warner J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 915-922Google Scholar), 2Z. Luo and D. Gallwitz, unpublished observations. is the preferred substrate for Gyp8p. We now find that Ypt1(Q67L)p, unlike the equivalent mammalian Ras(Q61L) mutant protein, served as efficient substrate for Gyp5p, explaining, at least in part, why previous studies using the ypt1 Q67L mutant allele did not cause major phenotypic alterations in some yeast strains (11Richardson C.J. Jones S. Litt R.J. Segev N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 827-838Google Scholar). Synthetic growth defects and morphologically prominent alterations in mutants with a combination of the ypt1 Q67L mutant allele and Ypt1-GAP gene deletions, which we describe here, demonstrate that hydrolysis of Ypt1p-bound GTP is in fact required for effective functioning of this regulatory GTPase. S. cerevisiae strains cl3-ABYS-86 (MATαura3-5 leu2-3 112 his3 pra1-1 prb1-1 prc1-1 cps1-3 can R) from D. H. Wolf (University of Stuttgart, Germany) and MSUC-3D (MATα ura3 trp1 leu2 his3 lys2) (this laboratory) were used for further genetic manipulations. For expression and purification of potential GAPs, the protease-deficient yeast strain BJ5459 (MAT a ura3 leu2 his3 lys2 pep4::HIS3 prb1D.16R kan1), originally obtained from the Yeast Genetic Stock Center, University of California, Berkeley, was employed. To analyze growth of different strains at various temperatures, logarithmically growing cultures were diluted into fresh YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose) to an optical density ofA 600 ∼0.01. From serial 10-fold dilutions, 4 μl each were spotted onto YPD-agar plates, and cells were grown at the appropriate temperatures. Cell growth in liquid cultures was followed by measuring the optical density at 600 nm, and the duplication time was calculated from the exponential parts of the growth curves. Gene deletions were performed by replacement withloxP-KanMX-loxP cassettes (22Guldener U. Heck S. Fiedler T. Beinhauer J. Hegemann J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2519-2524Google Scholar); carboxyl-terminal epitope tagging was as described by De Antoni and Gallwitz (23De Antoni A. Gallwitz D. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 246: 179-185Google Scholar). Replacement of the YPT1 gene on chromosome VI with the mutantypt1 Q67L gene was achieved by transforming relevant yeast strains with the linearized vector pREypt1Q67L as previously described (24Schmitt H.D. Puzicha M. Gallwitz D. Cell. 1988; 53: 635-647Google Scholar). Open reading frames YPL249c (GYP5) and YFL027c (GYP8) were amplified by high stringency PCRs using proofreading DNA polymerases (12Will E. Albert S. Gallwitz D. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 329: 50-58Google Scholar). Forward primers started with the translation initiation codon (boldface type) and had a 5′ overhang with restriction enzyme recognition sequences (underlined). Reverse primers contained six consecutive histidine codons in front of the translational stop codon: GYP5-forward, 5′-CATGGATTCCAT ATGTCTTCATCAGACAAATCTATTG-3′; GYP5-reverse, 5′-ACGGCTAGCGTCGAC TTAATGGTGATGGTGATGGTGTTTAAAAACTTTTTTAAAACCAGTC-3′; GYP8-forward, 5′-ATCAGATCTCAT ATGCCATTAAGGTCATTATTTC-3′; GYP8-reverse, 5′-GTACTCGAGAAGCTT AGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGTCTAGTTGGATGCCCCAG-3′. GYP5 PCR products were cleaved with BamHI andNheI and ligated intoBamHI-XbaI-cleaved pYES2 plasmid (Invitrogen). GYP8 PCR products were cleaved with NdeI and XhoI and ligated into pET22a (Novagen) cleaved with the same enzymes. Truncated genes were created by cloning the appropriate PCR products as described above and ligation into pET30a (Novagen). Suppression analysis of yeast mutants was done withGYP genes cloned under TPI promoter control in the 2μ-based vector pYX212 (R & D Systems). Subcellular fractionation by differential centrifugation and the preparation of yeast cell extracts for immunological protein detection were as described previously (26Benli M. Doring F. Robinson D.G. Yang X. Gallwitz D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6460-6475Google Scholar). Proteins in SDS-PAGE-fractionated extracts were detected immunologically after electrotransfer onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) and incubation with appropriately diluted anti-VSV epitope antibodies (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Gyp-GFP fusions were prepared by cloning of BamHI- plusSalI-cleaved GYP genes (recognition sequences were included in the PCR primers) into pUG23 vector (27Niedenthal R.K. Riles L. Johnston M. Hegemann J.H. Yeast. 1996; 12: 773-786Google Scholar). For YFP-CFP double fluorescence studies, pUG23 was modified by replacing the GFP gene with YFP or CFP. YFP and CFP genes were obtained by PCR from vectors pEYFP and pECFP (CLONTECH), respectively. For coexpression of GYP1-YFP and GYP8-CFP, the GYP8-CFP expression cassette was transplanted from pUG23-GYP8-CFP (HIS3 marker) into URA3-marked vector pUG36 (27Niedenthal R.K. Riles L. Johnston M. Hegemann J.H. Yeast. 1996; 12: 773-786Google Scholar). Double transformants were grown in selective medium lacking both histidine and uracil and analyzed by confocal fluorescence microscopy using Leica TCSSP2. Fluorescent data were recorded at CFP- and YFP-specific excitation and emission wavelengths. Records at different wavelengths were merged using Photoshop 5.5 software. Ypt-GTPases were expressed from pET vectors in E. coli BL21(DE3) (Novagen) and purified by anion exchange chromatography and gel filtration (28Wagner P. Hengst L. Gallwitz D. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 219: 369-387Google Scholar). Bacterially expressed, catalytically active Gyp5–58p and Gyp8–49p, His6-tagged at their C termini, were affinity-purified on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) and further purified by ion exchange chromatography on MonoQ HR10/10 (AmershamBiosciences) and by gel filtration using Sephacryl S-200 HR 16/60. The purification method described (12Will E. Albert S. Gallwitz D. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 329: 50-58Google Scholar, 18Albert S. Will E. Gallwitz D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5216-5225Google Scholar) was modified in that 1% of Triton X-100 (Baker) was included in the cell lysis buffer to facilitate protein solubility. If required, purified proteins were concentrated by ultrafiltration using Microsep (Pall Filtron Corp.). Filter GAP assays using [γ-32P]GTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) were performed as described (14Vollmer P. Gallwitz D. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 257: 118-128Google Scholar). HPLC-based GAP assays were performed exactly as previously described (12Will E. Albert S. Gallwitz D. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 329: 50-58Google Scholar). For determining the extremely low intrinsic hydrolysis rates of Ypt1(Q67L)p mutant protein, the incubation time at 30 °C was extended over 8 h. The biochemical properties of Gyp5p with Ypt1p and Ypt1(Q67L)p as substrates were determined using an integrated Michaelis-Menten procedure (29Duggleby R.G. Clarke R.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1080: 231-236Google Scholar) as described (18Albert S. Will E. Gallwitz D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5216-5225Google Scholar). Due to the extremely slow intrinsic GTP hydrolysis rate of Ypt1(Q67L)p, rates of the GAP-accelerated reactions were followed using fixed concentrations of the mutant GTPase (10 and 20 μm, respectively, for the Gyp5p- and Gyp8p-catalyzed reaction) and excessive amounts of the two GAPs. To augment intracellular membranes, yeast cells were fixed with potassium permanganate and processed for electron microscopy as described previously (26Benli M. Doring F. Robinson D.G. Yang X. Gallwitz D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6460-6475Google Scholar). Six moderately conserved sequence segments constitute the GYP domain of the catalytically active region of Ypt/Rab-specific GAPs. Within this region of the biochemically identified GAPs, six from yeast and two from mammals, there are three absolutely conserved “GYP fingerprint” sequences, RXXXW, IXXDXXR, and YXQ (Fig.1 A), which are helpful to identify members of this class of proteins. Using this criterion, two other yeast proteins, encoded by the reading frames YPL249c and YFL027c, were predicted to be members of the GYP family. The genes were amplified by PCR from total S. cerevisiae DNA and expressed from a multicopy vector as C-terminally His6-tagged proteins in yeast. Proteins adsorbed to Ni2+-agarose were first tested for GAP activity with different GTP-loaded Ypt-GTPases in a standard assay (12Will E. Albert S. Gallwitz D. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 329: 50-58Google Scholar). We found that the protein product of YPL249c, hereinafter termed Gyp5p, accelerated the intrinsic GTP hydrolysis rate of Ypt1p significantly and that of Sec4p marginally. High expression and purification of full-length YFL027c protein was not successful either in yeast or in Escherichia coli. Because our previous studies (18Albert S. Will E. Gallwitz D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5216-5225Google Scholar) had shown that deletion of sequences outside the catalytic domain can result in improved yield and solubility of bacterially produced Ypt-GAPs, short C-terminal truncations of 33 and 77 amino acids, respectively, were made of the YFL027 protein. The larger truncation was found to allow easy production in E. coli of soluble protein with GAP activity toward Ypt1p and Ypt6p. The gene comprising the reading frame YFL027c was therefore designatedGYP8. As shown in Fig. 1, the GYP domain of the 101.6-kDa Gyp5p is localized in the C-terminal half of the protein (amino acids 451–624), whereas in the 57.6-kDa Gyp8p it occupies most of the N-terminal half (amino acids 68–275). Gyp5p harbors a coiled-coil region of about 140 amino acid residues at its C terminus and a serine- and proline-rich domain located N-terminally of the GYP domain. In correspondence with mutational studies of Gyp1p and Gyp7p (18Albert S. Will E. Gallwitz D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5216-5225Google Scholar), we observed that deletion of the large N-terminal region preceding the GYP domain of Gyp5p did not affect its GAP activity and that a larger sequence segment following the GYP domain was required for the protein's catalytic activity. However, at least 135 amino acids could be removed from the C-terminal end of Gyp5p without interfering with its GAP activity (Fig.1 B). For the biochemical characterization, a 493-amino acid-long fragment of Gyp5p (Gyp5–58p, residues 400–892) and a 420-amino acid-long Gyp8 protein lacking only the C-terminal 77 residues (Gyp8–49p) were produced in E. coli and purified by affinity and ion exchange chromatography and by gel filtration. Our previous studies had shown that various biochemical parameters, like substrate specificity and activation rates, did not change significantly when full-length and truncated active Gyp proteins were compared (18Albert S. Will E. Gallwitz D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5216-5225Google Scholar). We first inquired into the substrate specificity of the novel GAPs employing a quantitative HPLC-based method to compare the GAP activity with different GTP-loaded GTPases (12Will E. Albert S. Gallwitz D. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 329: 50-58Google Scholar). As shown in Table I, Gyp5–58p exhibited a clear preference for Ypt1p over Sec4p, the only other GTPase whose intrinsic GTPase activity was accelerated by this GAP. For Gyp8–49p, which had a higher specific activity than Gyp5–58p (Fig. 2 A), Ypt1p and Ypt6p were the most efficient substrates (Table I). Although in the standard assay, the acceleration of the intrinsic GTP hydrolysis rate was higher for Ypt6p due to its extremely slow intrinsic GTPase activity, in absolute terms the reaction rate with Ypt1p (k = 1.144 min−1) was higher than that with Ypt6p (k= 0.385 min−1). In addition, Sec4p and, less pronounced, the redundant GTPases Ypt31p and Ypt32p served as substrate for Gyp8–49p in vitro.Table ISubstrate specificities of Gyp5p and Gyp8p in vitroGTPaseIntrinsic GTP hydrolysis rateaAll experiments were performed at 30°C, data from Albert and Gallwitz (17).Gyp5–58p-stimulated GTP hydrolysis accelerationb20 μm Ypt-GTP complexes were incubated with 100 nm Gyp5–58p.Gyp8–49p-stimulated GTP hydrolysis accelerationc20 μm Ypt-GTP complexes were incubated with 20 nm Gyp8–49p.min−1-fold-foldYpt1p0.0025150.0457.8Sec4p0.001623.6175.2Ypt31p0.00641.230.9Ypt32p0.00831.043.0Ypt51p0.00521.66.8Ypt52p0.08621.41.5Ypt53p0.01021.07.2Ypt6p0.00022.21923.0Ypt7p0.00231.06.6a All experiments were performed at 30°C, data from Albert and Gallwitz (17Albert S.

Wittinghofer A. Warshel A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14225-14231Google Scholar) (Fig.2 B). In a reaction with a 200-fold excess of Ypt1p·GTP over Gyp5–58p, we determined k cat to be 106 min−1, which corresponds to a 4.24 × 104-fold acceleration of the intrinsic hydrolysis rate of this GTPase. With a K m of 74.5 μm, Gyp5–58p, like other Ypt-GAPs (18Albert S. Will E. Gallwitz D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5216-5225Google Scholar, 19Albert S. Gallwitz D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33186-33189Google Scholar, 31Will E. Gallwitz D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12135-12139Google Scholar), has a low affinity for its preferred substrate GTPase Ypt1p. So far, k catand K m for Gyp8–49p could not be determined with certainty, since under the experimental conditions of the HPLC-based GAP assay, increasing substrate concentrations tended to inhibit GAP activity. One of the structural hallmarks of Ypt-GAPs is a conserved arginine within the IXXDXXR sequence motif (Fig.1 A). This residue is critical for GAP catalytic function (18Albert S. Will E. Gallwitz D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5216-5225Google Scholar, 31Will E. Gallwitz D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12135-12139Google Scholar), and the three-dimensional structure of Gyp1p (32Rak A. Fedorov R. Alexandrov K. Albert S. Goody R.S. Gallwitz D. Scheidig A.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5105-5113Google Scholar) indicates that it might act in catalysis like the “finger arginine” of Ras-GAP (33Ahmadian M.R. Stege P. Scheffzek K. Wittinghofer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 686-689Google Scholar). We have substituted this arginine with either alanine or lysine in both Gyp5p (Arg496) and Gyp8p (Arg114) and found that each of the four mutant proteins almost completely lost GAP activity (shown for Gyp5p in Fig.2 A). Of the eight Gyp family members in yeast, three (Gyp1p (18Albert S. Will E. Gallwitz D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5216-5225Google Scholar, 34Du L.L. Novick P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1215-1226Google Scholar), Gyp5p, and Gyp8p (this report)) are now known to be potent GAPs in vitro for Ypt1p, the GTPase with an essential function in ER-to-Golgi transport. In a recent report (34Du L.L. Novick P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1215-1226Google Scholar), fluorescence microscopic data were presented showing that on high expression, red fluorescent protein-tagged Gyp1p partially colocalized in punctate structures with a GFP fusion of the Golgi protein Bet3p, suggesting Golgi association of Gyp1p. In a first attempt to assign Gyp5p and Gyp8p to their main cellular compartment(s) and to determine the relative abundance of the three Ypt1-GAPs, Gyp5p, Gyp8p, and Gyp1p were C-terminally tagged with VSV, MYC, or hemagglutinin epitopes and expressed from the modified genes that were integrated into the genome of the protease-deficient strain Cl3-ABYS-86 such that they replaced the respective chromosomal wild type copies. This experimental procedure was chosen to also avoid possible artifacts resulting from unphysiologically high intracellular concentration of the GAPs. The relative abundance of the three GAPs was calculated from immunoblots of electrophoretically separated total cellular proteins performed with antibodies specific for the protein tags. Fig.3 shows an immunoblot with VSV-tagged Ypt-GAPs, which was subjected to quantification of the reactive protein bands using a Lumi-Imager. According to these analyses, the intracellular levels of Gyp5p and Gyp1p were about 12.5 and 6 times higher, respectively, than that of Gyp8p. In subcellular fractionation experiments, Gyp1p was distributed almost equally between the P10, P100, and soluble fractions. In contrast, Gyp5p was in the soluble fraction nearly exclusively. Gyp8p was enriched in the P10 fraction, suggesting that a significant portion was either part of large protein complexes or associated preferentially with the ER and/or the plasma membrane (data not shown). The intracellular distribution of the three Ypt1-GAPs was also studied by fluorescence microscopy using C-terminal GFP fusions. In agreement with the cell fractionation data, the Gyp5-GFP was predominantly cytosolic, whereas Gyp8-GFP localized to few and bright punctate structures (Fig. 4 A). Gyp1-GFP that, according to a recent study (34Du L.L. Novick P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1215-1226Google Scholar), might be confined to Golgi compartments labeled smaller and more frequent punctate structures than Gyp8-GFP. To ascertain this observation, we co-expressed Gyp1-YFP with Gyp8-CFP and examined the cells by confocal microscopy. The fluorescence of YFP and CFP was recorded separately. As shown in Fig. 4 B, the structures labeled by Gyp1-YFP and Gyp8-CFP are obviously not identical, indicating a concentration of at least part of the two GAPs in different cellular compartments. These analyses show that despite the different abundance of the three GAPs, each has a typical intracellular localization profile at steady-state. Previous studies have shown that single deletions of either of the known Ypt-GAP-encoding genes did not result in clearly observable phenotypes when cells were grown in rich media. Since Gyp1p, Gyp5p, and Gyp8p are potent Ypt1-GAPs, we deleted the three chromosomal genes singly and in different combination in two strains of different genetic background. All mutants were viable and grew like “wild type”; only the triple Δgyp1/Δgyp5/Δgyp8 deletion in the protease-deficient strain cl3ABYS-86 had a somewhat retarded growth at low temperature (15 °C) compared with single and double deletion mutants. We reasoned that if the three GAPs accepted Ypt1p as substrate also in vivo, specific defects might become apparent when the GYP genes were deleted in cells that expressed the GTPase-deficient Ypt1(Q67L) mutant protein. Substitution with leucine of this highly conserved glutamine, which in Ras is essential for intrinsic and GAP-accelerated GTP hydrolysis (35Frech M. Darden T.A. Pedersen L.G. Foley C.K. Charifson P.S. Anderson M.W. Wittinghofer A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3237-3244Google Scholar), has been reported to be phenotypically silent in yeast, and this was taken as evidence that GTP hydrolysis might not be important for Ypt1p function (11Richardson C.J. Jones S. Litt R.J. Segev N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 827-838Google Scholar). We first replaced the chromosomal YPT1 gene with the mutant gene expressing Ypt1(Q67L)p in the haploid strains MSUC-3D and cl3ABYS-86 and found that cell growth of the MSUC-3D(ypt1 Q67L) strain was unaffected at temperatures ranging from 15 to 37 °C, whereas the protease-deficient strain cl3ABYS-86 did not grow at 15 °C (Fig. 5, A andB). We then attempted to introduce theypt1 Q67L mutant allele into haploid strains lacking one or more of the Ypt1-GAP genes. As can be seen from TableII, the triple deletion ofGYP1, GYP5, and GYP8 precluded chromosomal exchange of the YPT1 gene by theypt1 Q67L allele in MSUC-3D, indicating that such cells are inviable. In cl3-ABYS-86 background, the replacement ofYPT1 by the ypt1 Q67L mutant gene was inefficient when one of the three Ypt1-GAP genes was deleted, and it was unsuccessful when two of them were deleted. Importantly, MSUC-3D(ypt1 Q67L) cells lacking either theGYP5 gene alone or GYP5 in combination withGYP1 or GYP8 displayed a somewhat reduced growth at suboptimal temperatures (25 or 20 °C) and complete growth inhibition at 15 °C. For example, the growth rates of theypt1 Q67L strain and theypt1 Q67L/Δgyp5 strain at 30 °C were 92 and 101 min, and the rates at 20 °C were 195 and 230 min, respectively. Single deletions of GYP1, GYP8, or the Ypt7-GAP-encoding GYP7 gene did not affect the growth properties of the MSUC-3D(ypt1 Q67L) mutant strain (Fig. 5 A). The consequences of Ypt1-GAP gene deletions were even more severe in the cl3ABYS-86(ypt1 Q67L) strain; already single knockouts of either GYP5 or GYP8led to reduced growth at 20 °C. However, regardless of the growth temperature, none of the mutants described above exhibited significant alterations of transport or maturation of newly synthesized secr"
https://openalex.org/W1993204706,"GRP94 is a molecular chaperone that carries immunologically relevant peptides from cell to cell, transferring them to major histocompatibility proteins for presentation to T cells. Here we examine the binding of several peptides to recombinant GRP94 and study the regulation and site of peptide binding. We show that GRP94 contains a peptide-binding site in its N-terminal 355 amino acids. A number of peptides bind to this site with low on- and off-rates and with specificity that is distinct from that of another endoplasmic reticulum chaperone, BiP/GRP78. Binding to the N-terminal fragment is sufficient to account for the peptide binding activity of the entire molecule. Peptide binding is inhibited by radicicol, a known inhibitor of the chaperone activities of HSP90-family proteins. However, the peptide-binding site is distinct from the radicicol-binding pocket, because both can bind to the N-terminal fragment simultaneously. Furthermore, peptide binding does not cause the same conformational change as does binding of radicicol. When the latter binds to the N-terminal domain, it induces a conformational change in the downstream, acidic domain of GRP94, as measured by altered gel mobility and loss of an antibody epitope. These results relate the peptide-binding activity of GRP94 to its other function as a chaperone.

These results relate the peptide-binding activity of GRP94 to its other function as a chaperone. GRP94 has long been inferred to be a peptide-binding protein because of its ability to augment presentation of peptides to T cells (1Srivastava P.K. Adv. Cancer Res. 1993; 62: 153-177Google Scholar). Direct evidence for peptide binding was obtained in recent years by identification of peptides in acid eluates of purified GRP94 (2Nieland T.J. Tan M.C. Monne-van Muijen M. Koning F. Kruisbeek A.M. van Bleek G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6135-6139Google Scholar, 3Li Z. Srivastava P.K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3143-3151Google Scholar) and by direct binding of several peptides to purified GRP94 (4Blachere N.E., Li, Z. Chandawarkar R.Y. Suto R. Jaikaria N.S. Basu S. Udono H. Srivastava P.K. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1315-1322Google Scholar, 5Wearsch P.A. Nicchitta C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5152-5156Google Scholar). A number of exciting studies, both in vitro and in vivo, showed that GRP94 introduces its bound peptides into professional antigen presenting cells, by endocytosis via the CD91 receptor (6Blachere N.E. Udono H. Janetzki S., Li, Z. Heike M. Srivastava P.K. J. Immunother. 1993; 14: 352-356Google Scholar, 7Suto R. Srivastava P.K. Science. 1995; 269: 1585-1588Google Scholar, 8Basu S. Binder R.J. Ramalingam T. Srivastava P.K. Immunity. 2001; 14: 303-313Google Scholar) or via a CD91-independent pathway (9Berwin B. Hart J.P. Pizzo S.V. Nicchitta C.V. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 4282-4286Google Scholar), thereby dramatically increasing peptide recognition by T cells (6Blachere N.E. Udono H. Janetzki S., Li, Z. Heike M. Srivastava P.K. J. Immunother. 1993; 14: 352-356Google Scholar, 7Suto R. Srivastava P.K. Science. 1995; 269: 1585-1588Google Scholar, 8Basu S. Binder R.J. Ramalingam T. Srivastava P.K. Immunity. 2001; 14: 303-313Google Scholar). These studies point to immunization with GRP94 as a potentially effective tool to boost immune responses that are otherwise very weak. To better utilize GRP94 as a vaccine, the properties of peptide binding need to be characterized. An unusual property of GRP94 is that its peptide binding is stimulated by treatments that are expected to destabilize the protein, such as heat shock (7Suto R. Srivastava P.K. Science. 1995; 269: 1585-1588Google Scholar) or guanidinium hydrochloride (10Wearsch P.A. Voglino L. Nicchitta C.V. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5709-5719Google Scholar). The peptide binding activity of GRP94 is also stimulated by bis-ANS, 1The abbreviations used are: ANS, 1,1′-bis(4-anilino-5-naphthalenesulfonic acid). which binds to the same N-terminal domain as adenosine nucleotides, the ansamycin antibiotic geldanamycin, and another fungal metabolite, radicicol (11Wassenberg J.J. Reed R.C. Nicchitta C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22806-22814Google Scholar). Such stimulation of peptide binding is attributable to conformational changes in the chaperone, reflected in oligomerization and increased binding of hydrophobic dyes, but which are as yet only partly mapped and defined. The sequence analysis of GRP94 and its comparison with the known structure of HSP90 predicts GRP94 to be a multidomain protein. The putative N-terminal domain (amino acids 1–263) is highly homologous to the proteolytic fragment of HSP90 encompassing residues 9–232, which was shown to be the radicicol/geldanamycin/nucleotide-binding domain (12Stebbins C.E. Russo A.A. Schneider C. Rosen N. Hartl F.U. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1997; 89: 239-250Google Scholar, 13Prodromou C. Roe S.M. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. Cell. 1997; 90: 65-75Google Scholar). It is followed by a sequence (amino acids 264–344) with many runs of acidic residues, which contains the recognition site for the commonly used monoclonal anti-GRP94 antibody (14Sargan D.R. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 6252-6258Google Scholar). Both the putative N-terminal domain and the acidic domain are required for binding of nucleotides and inhibitors to GRP94 (15Schulte T.W. Akinaga S. Murakata T. Agatsuma T. Sugimoto S. Nakano H. Lee Y.S. Simen B.B. Argon Y. Felts S. Toft D.O. Neckers L.M. Sharma S.V. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1435-1448Google Scholar). A peptide-binding site was defined within the C-terminal domain of GRP94 by cross-linking pyrene-modified VSV8 (16Linderoth N.A. Popowicz A. Sastry S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5472-5477Google Scholar, 17Linderoth N.A. Simon M.N. Hainfeld J.F. Sastry S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11049-11054Google Scholar), an octapeptide known to be presented via GRP94 to T cells (3Li Z. Srivastava P.K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3143-3151Google Scholar). This site, centered around amino acids 624–630, was modeled as a shallow surface groove formed by α helices, resembling the peptide-binding site of a major histocompatibility locus protein (16Linderoth N.A. Popowicz A. Sastry S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5472-5477Google Scholar). Site-directed mutations showed that VSV8 binding to this site is dependent on aromatic side chains for binding affinity (17Linderoth N.A. Simon M.N. Hainfeld J.F. Sastry S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11049-11054Google Scholar). Fluorescence polarization and energy transfer experiments suggested that peptide was bound to higher order GRP94 assemblies (18Sastry S. Linderoth N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12023-12035Google Scholar, 19Linderoth N.A. Simon M.N. Rodionova N.A. Cadene M. Laws W.R. Chait B.T. Sastry S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1483-1495Google Scholar), as was also proposed for the homologous cytosolic chaperone HSP90 (20Prodromou C. Roe S.M. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 477-482Google Scholar). In the case of HSP90, both the C and N termini were shown to be needed for binding of substrates (21Freeman B.C. Myers M.P. Schumacher R. Morimoto R.I. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2281-2292Google Scholar, 22Young J.C. Schneider C. Hartl F.U. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 139-143Google Scholar, 23Scheibel T. Weikl T. Buchner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1495-1499Google Scholar, 24Tanaka E. Nemoto T.K. Ono T. Eur J Biochem. 2001; 268: 5270-5277Google Scholar), and two separate peptide-binding and/or chaperone sites with different specificities were proposed (22Young J.C. Schneider C. Hartl F.U. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 139-143Google Scholar,23Scheibel T. Weikl T. Buchner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1495-1499Google Scholar). In the former study, only the C-terminal site bound peptides, whereas the chaperone site in the N-terminal fragment was sensitive to geldanamycin. In the latter study, the N-terminal site was capable of binding peptides with preference for 10 residues or longer, in ATP-dependent fashion (23Scheibel T. Weikl T. Buchner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1495-1499Google Scholar). It is possible, therefore, that GRP94 also possesses two peptide/substrate binding sites. To characterize peptide binding by GRP94 we undertook a different approach, defining the peptide binding capability in solution of truncated and in-frame-deleted versions of the full-length GRP94. In the work described here we find a different peptide-binding site, capable of binding a number of peptides, within the first 355 amino acids of GRP94. We show that peptide binding to this site is inhibited by known ligands of GRP94 and that the inhibition is due to transmission of a conformational change along the chaperone. Full-length murine GRP94 was expressed and purified as recombinant protein in insect cells. The expression construct for GRP94 contained a His6 tag at its N terminus, followed by a TEV protease cleavage site. It lacked the signal sequence of the protein and harbored one amino acid substitution, T198I, ablating the one glycosylation site, which is usually used in mammalian GRP94. As shown previously non-glycosylated GRP94 binds to its cellular substrates as efficiently as the glycosylated protein (25Melnick, J., Structural Maturation of Immunoglobulins in Vivo: Characterization of Their Interactions with the Chaperones BiP and GRP94.Ph.D. thesis, 1995, Duke University, Durham, NC.Google Scholar). This expression construct was made as follows: a GRP94 cDNA clone (pGEM99.2; Ref. 26Mazzarella R.A. Green M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8875-8883Google Scholar); a generous gift from Dr. M. Green, St. Louis University, MO) was used as a PCR template. The substitution T198I was introduced into this clone and then the cDNA insert (without the signal sequence) was PCR-cloned into pFastBacHTb baculovirus expression vector (Invitrogen). The construct was verified by sequencing. In numbering amino acids of GRP94 we designate as +1 the Asp residue that is the N-terminal amino acid of the mature protein, after cleavage of the signal sequence. The construct for N355 was similar to that for the full-length protein, except that the endoplasmic reticulum-targeting signal KDEL followed by stop codons was introduced by PCR into codon 356 of the mature GRP94 sequence. N355 therefore contains the entire sequence, which is homologous to the proteolytic N-terminal domain of HSP90 (12Stebbins C.E. Russo A.A. Schneider C. Rosen N. Hartl F.U. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1997; 89: 239-250Google Scholar), and in addition it contains the first acidic domain. The Δ355 construct contained amino acids 356–802 of murine GRP94. It was expressed in SF9 cells as a His-tagged fusion protein, as described above. All the above constructs were expressed in SF9 cells via baculovirus infection, following the protocols in the manufacturer's manual. Pellets containing 2 × 109 infected cells were lysed in 1% Nikkol (Sigma Chemicals) in 20 mm phosphate buffer pH 7.2, containing 500 mm NaCl and 20 mmimidazole. The recombinant proteins were purified from the soluble fractions of cell lysates, after centrifugation to remove nuclei and cell debris. The supernatants were passed through 0.2-mm filters and then loaded onto nitrilotriacetic acid columns (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Bound proteins were eluted with 20 mm phosphate buffer pH 7.2, containing 500 mmimidazole and 500 mm NaCl, dialyzed, and concentrated. Proteins were stored in 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 110 mm KOAc, 20 mm NaCl, 1 mmMg(OAc)2, 0.1 mm CaCl2 (buffer A) containing 30% glycerol at −80 °C. The preparations used in this work were >80% pure as determined by SDS-PAGE. In some cases, further purification by ion exchange columns was performed, but the activity of the proteins was unchanged when the purity exceeded 95%. Tissue-derived GRP94 was purified from pooled mouse livers as described in Ref. 27Srivastava P.K. DeLeo A.B. Old L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3407-3411Google Scholar. BiP was tagged with His6 and purified as described in Ref. 28Davis D.P. Khurana R. Meredith S. Stevens F.J. Argon Y. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 3842-3850Google Scholar. All peptides were synthesized at the University of Chicago facility and verified by mass spectrometry. The sequences of the peptides and their proteins of origin are as follows: VSV8, RGYVYQGL, from the VSV N protein; Pep A, KRQIYTDLEMNRLGK, from the VSV G protein, NYLA, NYLAWYQQKPG, from the human immunoglobulin light chain; RAH, RAHYNIVTF, from the E-6 protein of human papilloma virus 16; FYQ, FYQLALT, a synthetic pan-HSP70-binding peptide. Stock solutions were prepared in either Me2SO or water and stored at −80 °C. Peptide concentrations were determined by a BCA assay (Pierce). Peptides containing tyrosine residues were iodinated by the IodoBead method (Pierce), and unincorporated iodine was removed by passage over a short Dowex AG1X8 column. The specific radioactivity of the peptides was routinely 2 × 1014 to 1 × 1015 cpm/mol. Assays of peptide binding to GRP94 were routinely performed in 25-μl total volume of buffer A, with 2–4 μg of recombinant protein and 100–1000 μm125I-labeled peptide. Radicicol (Sigma) or geldanamycin (NCI program on biological response modifiers), dissolved in Me2SO, were used as inhibitors of binding. Maximal final concentration of Me2SO was 1%. In some experiments, the reactions were incubated at room temperature for up to 20 h, a time that allows saturation binding at the peptide and protein concentrations used here. In other experiments, chaperone-peptide mixtures were incubated at 50 °C for 10 min, followed by 30 min at room temperature. These two procedures yield indistinguishable data with respect to dose, specificity, or reversibility of binding. At the end of the incubations, reducing SDS sample buffer was added, and samples were resolved on polyacrylamide gels. The intensities of bands migrating as 100-kDa species (in the case of full-length GRP94) or 55-kDa species (for N355) were quantified by phosphorimaging, using a STORM 820 phosphorimager and the associated ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The unbound peptide band in the samples was also quantified, to enable the calculation of binding in absolute units. In some experiments, binding was measured by direct γ counting after separation of the bound and free peptide over spin columns containing P30 beads in buffer A. For these experiments, 20 μg of protein was used per reaction. There was excellent correspondence between the data obtained by the two methods of quantitation. The same spin column method was also used semipreparatively to separate peptide-chaperone complexes from free peptides. Peptide binding to BiP was assayed by the spin column methods described in Ref. 28Davis D.P. Khurana R. Meredith S. Stevens F.J. Argon Y. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 3842-3850Google Scholar. To demonstrate saturable binding, dose binding assays of125I-peptides were performed by adding increasing concentrations of peptide to a fixed concentration of GRP94 (2–20 μm, depending on the assay, as above). ApparentK d values were calculated from IC50values (the concentrations of peptide required to obtain half maximal inhibition) as described in Ref. 28Davis D.P. Khurana R. Meredith S. Stevens F.J. Argon Y. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 3842-3850Google Scholar. We note that these values are only apparent because of the unusually long time required for peptide dissociation. Nonetheless, they provide a means of quantitative comparison of peptides. Peptide-chaperone complexes were analyzed by electrophoresis through a 10% reducing SDS gel. After drying, the gels were exposed to a low energy phosphorimager screen for 2–16 h for quantification. Analysis of GRP94 or N355 by native gel electrophoresis was accomplished by using 5–15% gradient acrylamide gels in the Laemmli gel system without SDS. For blue native gels (29Schagger H. Cramer W.A. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Google Scholar) Coomassie Brilliant Blue G 250 (Sigma Chemicals) was included in the cathode buffer at a final concentration of 0.02%. When dark blue bands signifying binding of the dye to protein were visible, the cathode buffer was replaced with buffer without dye, to destain the gels during the subsequent run. GRP94 constructs, FLAG-tagged at either the N or C terminus and lacking the signal sequence, were translated in vitro with a TnT kit (Promega, Madison, WI), in the absence of microsomal membranes and in the presence of [35S]methionine, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Constructs for in vitro translation were made from the pGEM99.2 plasmid by addition of the FLAG octapeptide via PCR to either the N or C terminus of the GRP94 coding sequence, followed by cloning into pGEM-T Easy (Promega, Madison, WI). The products were verified by sequencing. Translation products were immunoprecipitated with M1 or M2 monoclonal anti-FLAG (Sigma Chemicals) followed by protein A-Sepharose (Repligen Corporation, Needham, MA), or 9G10 monoclonal anti-GRP94 (StressGen, Vancouver, BC) followed by protein G-Sepharose (Sigma Chemicals or Pierce) as described in Ref. 30Melnick J. Dul J.L. Argon Y. Nature. 1994; 370: 373-375Google Scholar. They were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the gels were dried, exposed to phosphorimager screens, and recorded using the STORM 820. The characterization of the mode of peptide binding by GRP94 is important because of the ability of this chaperone to mediate presentation of peptides to T cells (31Tamura Y. Peng P. Liu K. Daou M. Srivastava P.K. Science. 1997; 278: 117-120Google Scholar). Toward this end, we have produced recombinant GRP94, using the baculovirus expression system and analyzed the peptide binding properties of both full-length GRP94 and a truncated version, consisting of the N-terminal 355 amino acids, termed N355. N355 consists of two putative domains. Its first 263 amino acids are highly homologous to the crystallized N-terminal domain of HSP90, which contains a nucleotide-binding site. The sequence 265–344 is rich in acidic residues (39%), is longer in all GRP94s than in the HSP90 proteins, and is referred to in this paper as an acidic (or negatively charged) domain. As was shown previously, this acidic domain is necessary for radicicol or geldanamycin binding to the N-terminal domain of GRP94 (15Schulte T.W. Akinaga S. Murakata T. Agatsuma T. Sugimoto S. Nakano H. Lee Y.S. Simen B.B. Argon Y. Felts S. Toft D.O. Neckers L.M. Sharma S.V. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1435-1448Google Scholar). N355 therefore contains the necessary structural determinants for at least one known activity of GRP94, binding of inhibitory ligands. Two previously known GRP94-binding peptides, the octamer VSV8 (7Suto R. Srivastava P.K. Science. 1995; 269: 1585-1588Google Scholar) and the 15-mer peptide A (10Wearsch P.A. Voglino L. Nicchitta C.V. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5709-5719Google Scholar), were labeled with radioactive iodine and used to assess the activity of the two recombinant proteins. The iodinated peptides were allowed to bind in solution, followed by separation of bound from free peptides using either spin columns or gel electrophoresis. As previously shown by Blachere et al. (4Blachere N.E., Li, Z. Chandawarkar R.Y. Suto R. Jaikaria N.S. Basu S. Udono H. Srivastava P.K. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1315-1322Google Scholar), the complexes between GRP94 (or N355) and peptides were stable enough to withstand resolution by SDS gel electrophoresis. Therefore, in the current study peptide binding to the recombinant proteins was quantified both by gamma counting and phosphorimaging. VSV8 bound to N355 in dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 1 a). Saturation was reached at a concentration of 800 μm, and the estimated apparent K d was 400 μm. Similar binding was observed for peptide A (Fig. 1 b). Binding of VSV8 and peptide A was specific, it was inhibited by addition of excess unlabeled peptide (Fig. 2 b). Significantly, peptide binding was inhibited by incubation with radicicol (Fig. 1, a and c; for peptide A see Fig. 3). This fungal metabolite is a pan-HSP90 ligand and is widely used as an inhibitor of HSP90 chaperone function (32Pearl L.H. Prodromou C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 46-51Google Scholar, 33Roe S.M. Prodromou C. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 260-266Google Scholar). Half maximal inhibition of peptide binding was observed at ∼50 μm radicicol (Fig. 1 c). We previously showed that radicicol binds to GRP94 with an estimatedK d of 0.1 μm (15Schulte T.W. Akinaga S. Murakata T. Agatsuma T. Sugimoto S. Nakano H. Lee Y.S. Simen B.B. Argon Y. Felts S. Toft D.O. Neckers L.M. Sharma S.V. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1435-1448Google Scholar), and the radicicol-binding pocket in the N-terminal domain of GRP94 (34Schulte T.W. Akinaga S. Soga S. Sullivan W. Stensgard B. Toft D. Neckers L.M. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1998; 3: 100-108Google Scholar) is known to be virtually identical to the radicicol-binding pocket identified in the crystal structure of HSP90 (32Pearl L.H. Prodromou C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 46-51Google Scholar, 33Roe S.M. Prodromou C. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 260-266Google Scholar). Furthermore, radicicol and geldanamycin were shown to inhibit the chaperone activity of GRP94 in vivo. Thus, peptide binding in our assay was dependent on a known structural aspect of GRP94 and is very likely to be relevant to the physiological function of GRP94.Figure 2Peptide binding to recombinant GRP94. a, recombinant full-length GRP94 (3.6 μm) was incubated at room temperature for 20 h with increasing concentrations of iodinated VSV8 peptide and binding was quantified and presented as described in the legend to Fig. 1. Shown are mean values (± S.D.) of association in the absence (black triangles) or presence (white triangles) of radicicol (300 μm). b, cold competition of peptide binding. Iodinated VSV8 (600 μm) was incubated at room temperature for 20 h with either recombinant GRP94 (triangles) or N355 protein (squares) (3.6 μm each), in the absence of unlabeled peptide, or in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled peptide. The extent of binding was quantified as described in the legend to Fig. 1. In the absence of unlabeled peptide the occupancy was 0.77 mol of VSV8 per mol of chaperone.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 3The selectivity of peptide binding by chaperones. GRP94, N355, or BiP were loaded with either VSV8, peptide A or FYQ, under conditions that approach complete binding, as in legend to Fig. 1. Each chaperone was used at 15 μm per reaction, and the peptides were at 300 μm each. The specific activities of all three peptides were similar. The binding reactions included either no inhibitor, 1 mm ATP, or 300 μm radicicol. The complexes of peptides and chaperones were then resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by phosphorimaging. VSV8 and PepA bind to GRP94 and N355 much more avidly than to BiP, whereas FYQ binding to BiP is stronger than to GRP94 or N355. It should be emphasized that because BiP-peptide complexes are partly sensitive to SDS, unlike GRP94-peptide complexes, the data for BiP binding are underestimates of the actual levels of binding. As shown before, the reason for the incomplete inhibition of peptides binding to BiP by ATP is re-association of complexes under the conditions employed; complete inhibition is observed when a single cycle binding assay is performed (28Davis D.P. Khurana R. Meredith S. Stevens F.J. Argon Y. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 3842-3850Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Since a VSV8-binding site was previously mapped to the region around amino acids 624–630 of GRP94 (16Linderoth N.A. Popowicz A. Sastry S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5472-5477Google Scholar), we created a construct complementary to N355, encompassing amino acids 356–802, and tested its ability to bind VSV8. This construct, termed Δ355, was expressed and purified from insect cells by the same method used for N355. As shown in Fig. 1 d, when tested for binding of iodinated VSV8, Δ355 showed only marginal level of peptide association, no different from that displayed by serum albumin. Δ355 binding of the VSV8 peptide was at least 20-fold lower than that of N355 (as determined by phosphorimaging), and we consider it a nonspecific association. Since to date there is no other known functional assay for the C-terminal portion of GRP94, we could not exclude the possibility that the lack of binding activity by Δ355 was due to inactivity or misfolding of this protein construct. We therefore compared the peptide binding ability of N355 to that of the full-length GRP94. As shown in Fig. 2 a, the VSV8 binding curve of N355 was very similar to the binding curve of full-length GRP94, with saturation at 800 μm and an approximate K d of 450 μm. The occupancy levels of both GRP94 and N355 are similar, typically 0.5–0.7 mol of peptide bound per mol of chaperone (Figs. 1 and 2) and in some assays as high as 0.9. Iodinated peptide binding to each version of the protein was inhibited by excess cold peptide, and the cold inhibition curves for both full-length GRP94 and N355 are essentially superimposable (Fig. 2 b). As can be seen from comparison of the data in Figs. 1 and 2, excess cold peptide inhibited binding to the same extent as excess radicicol. Furthermore, similar cold competition assays showed that VSV8 and peptide A inhibited each other's binding (data not shown), indicating that both peptides bind to the same site. It was possible that recombinant GRP94 differed in its peptide binding activity from tissue-derived GRP94, previously used to assess this activity (4Blachere N.E., Li, Z. Chandawarkar R.Y. Suto R. Jaikaria N.S. Basu S. Udono H. Srivastava P.K. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1315-1322Google Scholar, 5Wearsch P.A. Nicchitta C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5152-5156Google Scholar, 7Suto R. Srivastava P.K. Science. 1995; 269: 1585-1588Google Scholar, 35Srivastava P.K. Udono H. Blachere N.E. Li Z. Immunogenetics. 1994; 39: 93-98Google Scholar). Therefore, we compared recombinant GRP94 with liver-derived GRP94 purified using the procedure of Srivastava et al. (27Srivastava P.K. DeLeo A.B. Old L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3407-3411Google Scholar). In our hands, the specificity, affinity, and sensitivity to inhibitors of recombinant GRP94 were indistinguishable from that of liver-derived GRP94 (data not shown). Thus, the properties of our recombinant GRP94 are the same as those of the natural protein. We conclude that the N355 protein, containing the first two domains of GRP94, can essentially account for the known peptide binding activity of the full-length protein. Although our data do not formally exclude the possibility that GRP94 contains another peptide-binding site, they strongly suggest the existence of only a single peptide-binding site in the N-terminal portion of the chaperone. A number of ER chaperones are known to be peptide-binding proteins. The best defined is BiP (36Blond-Elguindi S. Cwirla S.E. Dower W.J. Lipshutz R.J. Sprang S.R. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 717-728Google Scholar), but several other chaperones, including calreticulin (37Nair S. Wearsch P.A. Mitchell D.A. Wassenberg J.J. Gilboa E. Nicchitta C.V. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 6426-6432Google Scholar), calnexin, ERp72 (38Spee P. Subjeck J. Neefjes J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10559-10566Google Scholar), GRP170, and protein-disulfide isomerase (39Spee P. Neefjes J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 2441-2449Google Scholar) may be active in antigen re-presentation to T cells. Because GRP94 often binds to the same protein substrates as BiP, we compared the peptide selectivity of GRP94 and BiP. The binding conditions for the two proteins are sufficiently different that a very rigorous comparison cannot be made at present, but we did establish a rank order of respective affinities among a small set of peptides. Inhibition of binding by radicicol was used as a criterion for specific binding to GRP94 (or N355), much in the same way that inhibition by ATP is used to show specific peptide binding to HSP70 proteins. Peptide A and VSV8 were the best GRP94 binders (Fig.3), followed by RAHYNIVTF, a nonapeptide from the E6 protein of HPV-16 (data not shown).

https://openalex.org/W2070997079,"A novel family of cysteine-rich secreted proteins with unique tissue distribution has recently been identified. One of the members, resistin (for “resistance to insulin”), also called FIZZ3, was identified in a screen for molecules that are down-regulated in mature adipocytes upon administration of thiazolidinediones. The prototypical member of this family was originally identified from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of inflamed lungs and designated FIZZ1 (“found in inflammatory zone”). This molecule was also found to be highly expressed in adipose tissue and was named resistin-like molecule α (RELMα). Here we demonstrate that RELMα inhibits the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into adipocytes. RELMα has no effect on proliferation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Pretreatment of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes with RELMα does not affect insulin- or platelet-derived growth factor-induced mitogenesis. IRS-1 phosphorylation and glucose transport stimulated by insulin in mature adipocytes were also unaffected by RELMα. We show that RELMα forms disulfide-linked homooligomers based on results from electrophoresis under reducing and nonreducing conditions, coimmunoprecipitation experiments as well as by mass spectrometry. In addition, RELMα is able to form heterooligomers with resistin but not RELMβ. Since RELMα is expressed by adipose tissue and it is a secreted factor, our findings suggest that RELMα may be involved in the control of the adipogenesis as well as in the process of muscle differentiation.

In addition, adipose tissue plays an important role in the regulation of glucose levels in the blood and is one of the target sites for the insulin-dependent glucose uptake (1MacDougald O.A. Lane M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 345-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar, 2Saltiel A.R. Cell. 2001; 104: 517-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). The development of mature adipose cells from adipose precursor cells is accompanied by morphological changes, rearrangement of extracellular matrix, and increased expression of genes involved in lipid and glucose metabolism (3Gregoire F.M. Smas C.M. Sul H.S. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 783-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1873) Google Scholar). In order to determine the molecular mechanisms of adipocyte differentiation, several preadipocyte cell lines such as 3T3-L1 have been generated. The differentiation of these cells into adipocytes can be induced by stimulation with a combination of dexamethasone, 3-isobutyl-1-methyxanthine, and insulin (4MacDougald O.A. Cornelius P. Lin F.T. Chen S.S. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19041-19047Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The process of differentiation is regulated by a coordinated expression of key transcription factors such as sterol regulatory element-binding protein, PPARγ,1 and C/EBPα that are expressed during this conversion process (1MacDougald O.A. Lane M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 345-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). Despite its primary function as an organ for storing surplus energy, adipose tissue is now believed to be a major secretory organ that secretes factors that influence not only adipocyte growth and differentiation but also total body homeostasis (5Ahima R.S. Flier J.S. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 11: 327-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar). The factors secreted by adipocytes control processes ranging from inflammation and angiogenesis to modulation of insulin action and appetite control (6Halvorsen Y.D. Wilkison W.O. Briggs M.R.

Recently, a member of a novel class of cysteine-rich proteins, resistin (for “resistance to insulin”) or FIZZ3, was demonstrated to be secreted by adipocytes (8Steppan C.M. Bailey S.T. Bhat S.

The expression of resistin is induced during adipocyte differentiation and is down-regulated by thiazolidinediones that represent a class of insulin-sensitizing drugs known to serve as ligands for PPARγ (8Steppan C.M.

When administrated to mice, resistin impairs glucose tolerance and antagonizes insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in vitro. Therefore, resistin has been suggested to serve as a link between obesity and type II diabetes. There are two other members of the resistin family of molecules, RELMα and RELMβ, that are 29 and 37% identical, respectively, to resistin at the protein level (9Holcomb I.N. Kabakoff R.C. Chan B.

In this report, we have produced biologically active recombinant RELMα. When added to a culture of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes that have been stimulated to undergo differentiation, RELMα has an inhibitory effect on this process. The inhibition is accompanied by a decrease in the mRNA levels of several markers of differentiation including PPARγ, C/EBPα, aP2, Acrp30, and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (13Rosen E.D. Spiegelman B.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 145-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar, 14Scherer P.E. Williams S. Fogliano M. Baldini G. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26746-26749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2760) Google Scholar). In addition, RELMα was able to inhibit the conversion of C2C12 myoblasts into myotubes. No proliferation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes was observed upon the addition of RELMα although a proliferative response was clearly seen both with insulin and with PDGF. This suggests that the inhibition of adipocyte differentiation by RELMα is not mediated by induction of mitogenesis, as is the case with several growth factors such as epidermal growth factor and PDGF. The addition of RELMα had no effect on insulin- or PDGF-induced mitogenesis. Furthermore, RELMα did not alter insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by mature adipocytes. Since the resistin family of molecules is rich in cysteine residues, the migration of RELMα was examined by SDS-PAGE under reducing and nonreducing conditions. It was found that although RELMα migrated as a monomer under reducing conditions, several forms were detected under nonreducing conditions, suggesting formation of homooligomers. This was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation experiments using FLAG and V5-tagged versions of RELMα. In order to confirm the presence of higher order oligomers, we subjected reduced and unreduced samples of RELMα to mass spectrometry and observed only monomers under reducing conditions, whereas trimers, dimers, and monomers were detected under nonreducing conditions. The existence of oligomeric forms of RELMα was confirmed in mouse serum using an antibody directed against the endogenous protein. Finally, we observed heterooligomerization of RELMα with resistin but not with RELMβ, suggesting that the formation of homo- or heterooligomers may serve to regulate the biological activity of this family of molecules. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were grown in DMEM with 10% calf serum plus antibiotics in 5% CO2. C2C12 cells and 293T cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine and 10% fetal bovine serum plus antibiotics in 5% CO2. PDGF and anti-phosphotyrosine mouse monoclonal antibody (4G10) were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-V5 monoclonal antibody was from Invitrogen, anti-IRS-1 antibody (C-20) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), and anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody was from Sigma. Recombinant mouse resistin was from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). A keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated peptide, ENKVKELLANPANYP, was used to generate a rabbit polyclonal antibody against murine RELMα (Biocarta, Carlsbad, CA). Expressed sequence tag clones with GenBankTM accession numbers AI528963, AA712003, andAA518288 were used as templates to amplify the open reading frames for resistin, RELMα, and RELMβ, respectively. For carboxyl terminus FLAG-tagged ligands, polymerase chain reaction fragments were subcloned into pCMV-Tag4a vectors (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). RELMα fragment was also subcloned into pcDNA6/V5-His vector (Invitrogen). Constructs were confirmed by sequencing. A cDNA encoding RELMα without a signal sequence was subcloned into pBAD/gIII vector (Invitrogen) to produce recombinant ligand from bacteria. The predicted average molecular mass of mature recombinant RELMα is 11,214.8 in its completely reduced state. 293T cells were transfected with an empty vector or an expression vector encoding FLAG-tagged RELMα. 24 h after transfection, the medium was changed to serum-free medium, and the cells were allowed to grow for a further 48 h. The supernatant from transfected dishes was then harvested, pooled, and concentrated using Amicon Centriprep centrifugal filtration devices with a 3,000-Dalton cutoff. For production of recombinant bacterial RELMα, competent Escherichia coliwere transformed with FLAG-tagged RELMα in pBAD/gIII vector. The bacteria were then grown to log phase, and protein expression was induced by 0.04% arabinose. 4 h after induction, the cells were pelleted and subjected to osmotic shock by first treating them with 20% sucrose, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2.5 mm EDTA and then with 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2.5 mm EDTA for releasing recombinant RELMα from the periplasmic space. The shock fluid was then purified on an anti-FLAG immunoaffinity column and then eluted by 0.5 mg/ml FLAG peptide in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by extensive dialysis against PBS. 293T cells in 10-cm dishes were transfected with 15 μg of plasmid encoding a FLAG-tagged RELMα alone or 7.5 μg of each plasmid if V5-tagged RELMα was cotransfected with FLAG-tagged RELMα, resistin, or RELMβ. 48 h after transfection, the supernatants were harvested and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibodies. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times in PBS, and the eluates were resolved by SDS-PAGE (Novex, San Diego, CA) followed by transfer onto nitrocellulose. The membranes were Western blotted with anti-V5 or anti-FLAG antibodies. The membrane shown in the top panel in Fig. 5 was stripped after Western blotting with anti-V5 and reprobed with anti-FLAG antibody to confirm equal expression. The supernatants were also directly Western blotted with anti-V5 antibody to check equal expression of V5-tagged molecules. Detection was performed by enhanced chemiluminescence method according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). For the experiments shown in Fig. 3 C, 3T3-L1 adipocytes in 6-cm dishes were serum-deprived for 18 h and left untreated or pretreated with 1 μm RELMα for the indicated times, stimulated with 50 nm insulin for 5 min, and processed as described previously (15Pandey A. Podtelejnikov A.V. Blagoev B. Bustelo X.R. Mann M. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Cleared cell lysates were incubated with anti-IRS-1 antibody coupled to agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) for 6 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were then washed in lysis buffer, boiled in sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto nitrocellulose. The membrane was first probed with 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody and then stripped and reprobed with anti-IRS-1 antibody to confirm an equal loading. For in vivo studies of RELMα (Fig. 7), 50 μl of mouse serum was filtered through a 100,000-Dalton cut-off Microcon filter device (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) and resolved by SDS-PAGE under reducing or nonreducing conditions. Proteins from the gel were then transferred onto nitrocellulose, and Western blotting was performed using rabbit anti-RELMα immune serum. Mouse 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were differentiated essentially as previously described (16Rubin C.S. Hirsch A. Fung C. Rosen O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7570-7578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown to confluence in DMEM with 10% calf serum plus antibiotics in 5% CO2. Two days after the cells were confluent (day 0), the cells were induced to differentiate by changing the medium to DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum plus 0.5 mm3-isobutyl-1-methyxanthine (Sigma) and 1 μm dexamethasone (Sigma). After 48 h (day 2), the medium was replaced with DMEM containing only 10% fetal bovine serum. The medium was changed every second day. In cases where supernatant was used, cells were cultured in medium containing 50% supernatant and 50% DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (plus dexamethasone and 3-isobutyl-1-methyxanthine for the first 2 days). 250 nm, 500 nm, 750 nm, or 1 μm of purified recombinant RELMα was used in experiments shown in Fig. 2 B. To examine a possible effect of RELMα on muscle differentiation, C2C12 cells were grown to complete confluence in 6-cm dishes, and the medium was then changed to differentiation medium containing 2% horse serum instead of 10% bovine serum. Purified RELMα (1 μm) was added, and cells were fed with fresh medium every second day. 3T3-L1 cells were grown in complete medium until they were ∼60% confluent. The medium was then changed to serum-free medium containing purified RELMα (1 μm), insulin (50 nm), and PDGF (4 nm) alone or in combination, as indicated in Fig.3 A, and the cells were grown for an additional 21 h. During the last 7 h of treatment, 1 μCi/ml of3H-labeled thymidine (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Costa Mesa, CA) was added. Cells were then washed twice with PBS and trypsinized for 10 min at 37 °C and then transferred onto glass microfiber filters. Subsequently, the filters were washed twice with PBS, twice with 5% trichloroacetic acid, and once with absolute ethanol. The incorporated radioactivity was measured using liquid scintillation mixture on a Tri-Carb 2100R liquid scintillation counter (Packard Instrument Co.). To test if RELMα has an effect on glucose uptake by adipocytes, 3T3-L1 cells were differentiated as previously described (4MacDougald O.A. Cornelius P. Lin F.T. Chen S.S. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19041-19047Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and fully differentiated adipocytes were then incubated in serum-free medium in the presence or absence of purified RELMα or resistin (1 μm). After 20 h, 1 μCi/ml14C-labeled d-glucose (Amersham Biosciences) was added to the medium, and the cells were stimulated for 15 min with 15 nm insulin (see Fig. 3 B). Subsequently, cells were washed two times with PBS, harvested in water, and lysed by freezing and thawing. Measurements were done using a liquid scintillation counter. Total RNA was prepared as described previously (17Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Reverse transcription reactions were performed in a 25-μl volume containing 1 μg of total RNA, 3 μg of random hexamers (Amersham Biosciences), 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 75 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 40 units of RNA-guard (AmershamBiosciences), 0.9 mm dNTPs, and 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Reactions were left for 10 min at room temperature, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 1 h. After cDNA synthesis, reactions were diluted with 50 μl of water. Multiplex reverse transcription-PCR was performed as described with minor modifications (18Hansen J.B. Petersen R.K. Larsen B.M. Bartkova J. Alsner J. Kristiansen K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2386-2393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). All reactions contained the TBP primer set as an internal standard. PPARγ2, C/EBPα, aP2, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and Acrp30-specific primers were used as markers of adipocyte differentiation. The samples were dried down after the PCR and resolved on 0.4-mm, 8 m urea, 1× TBE, 6% polyacrylamide gels. The gels were dried and exposed overnight on a PhosphorImager storage screen. Screens were subsequently scanned on a PhosphorImager plate (Amersham Biosciences). Purified RELMα was loaded onto a Poros R2™ (Perseptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) microcolumn for desalting. Subsequently, the protein was eluted with 60% acetonitrile, 5% formic acid directly into a nanoelectrospray needle (MDS-Proteomics, Odense, Denmark). Nanoelectrospray mass spectrometry (19Wilm M. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (1719) Google Scholar) was performed on a quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (QSTAR Pulsar, PE Sciex, Toronto, Canada) equipped with a nanoelectrospray source (MDS-Proteomics). To determine biological properties of RELMα, we generated an epitope-tagged version with a FLAG tag at the C terminus. We chose a C-terminal tag, because a C-terminally FLAG-tagged version of resistin has previously been shown to have functional activity (8Steppan C.M. Bailey S.T. Bhat S. Brown E.J. Banerjee R.R. Wright C.M. Patel H.R. Ahima R.S. Lazar M.A. Nature. 2001; 409: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (4004) Google Scholar). 293T cells were then transfected with the cDNA constructs, and the supernatants were tested for expression of the respective recombinant proteins. As shown in Fig.1 A, we were able to detect RELMα at the expected molecular weights by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. We also produced recombinant RELMα in bacteria followed by immunoaffinity purification on an anti-FLAG column. Fig.1 B shows a silver-stained gel of purified recombinant RELMα under reducing and nonreducing conditions. We found that although RELMα migrated strictly as a monomer under reducing conditions, it migrated as at least two additional forms with higher apparent molecular weights under nonreducing conditions. The molecular weight of these two higher forms was consistent with their being a dimer and a trimer of RELMα. It is possible that even higher order multimers are formed. RELMα is expressed highly in white adipose tissue and the lungs (9Holcomb I.N. Kabakoff R.C. Chan B. Baker T.W. Gurney A. Henzel W. Nelson C. Lowman H.B. Wright B.D. Skelton N.J. Frantz G.D.

Since it is a secreted protein, it seems plausible that it may have the capacity to modulate the adipogenic process. To test this, we subjected 3T3-L1 preadipocytes to the standard differentiation program in the presence of mock-conditioned medium or RELMα -conditioned medium. As shown in Fig. 2 A, the conversion of preadipocytes into adipocytes was significantly inhibited by treatment with RELMα. We also tested the purified bacterially expressed recombinant RELMα for activity in this assay. As shown in Fig.2 B, we again observed a significant inhibition of adipocyte differentiation. Since the program of differentiation involves up-regulation of a subset of genes that are specific for maturing or mature adipocytes, we tested whether the expression of mRNAs of these genes correlated with the inhibition of differentiation. A multiplex reverse transcription-PCR using mRNA isolated from control and RELMα-treated cells was performed for this purpose. As seen in Fig. 2 C, the expression of C/EBPα, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, Acrp30, aP2, and PPARγ2 was down-regulated, whereas the expression of a control gene, TBP, was unaffected, confirming that the differentiation of preadipocytes into adipocytes is indeed inhibited by RELMα. We also observed a similar inhibition when differentiation was induced by rosiglitazone, a thiazolidinedione (data not shown). Inhibition of differentiation may be brought about by an induction of proliferation in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, as is the case with other antiadipogenic factors such as epidermal growth factor and PDGF (20Hauner H. Rohrig K. Petruschke T. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 25: 90-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Therefore, we performed a thymidine incorporation assay to examine the effect of purified RELMα on DNA synthesis in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Fig.3 A shows that RELMα does not have any effect on proliferation. Although RELMα does not have any effect on 3T3-L1 cells on its own, it was possible that it might be able to modulate the effects on proliferation by other growth factors. To test this possibility, we treated 3T3-L1 cells with insulin or PDGF in the presence of RELMα. As shown in Fig. 3 A, no effect on insulin- or PDGF-induced mitogenesis was observed, suggesting that RELMα may exert its effects by other mechanisms. We next examined the effect of RELMα on glucose uptake in adipocytes either alone or in combination with insulin. As shown in Fig.3 B, the addition of RELMα had no effect on glucose uptake in adipocytes, whereas resistin, used here as a control, suppressed insulin-stimulated glucose transport into these cells although it was not dramatic. Since secreted factors such as tumor necrosis factor-α and endothelin-1 modulate insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 (21Guo D. Donner D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 615-618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 22Ishibashi K.I. Imamura T. Sharma P.M. Huang J. Ugi S. Olefsky J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 1193-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), we decided to check whether RELMα has any effect on IRS-1 phosphorylation. Fig. 3 C shows that RELMα alone does not induce any tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, and short or long-term pretreatment with RELMα does not alter the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 induced by insulin. RELMα was originally identified as a protein expressed in the lung and adipose tissues. Since it is a secreted factor that is able to inhibit adipocyte differentiation, we decided to test whether it can affect differentiation of other cell types as well. For this purpose, C2C12 myoblasts were subjected to a differentiation protocol in the presence or absence of RELMα. It was observed that the addition of RELMα was able to inhibit the differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts into myotubes (Fig. 4). The resistin family of molecules is quite rich in cysteines, with 10 cysteine residues being conserved among all members. Resistin and RELMβ contain one additional cysteine residue at their N termini. The structure of these molecules is distantly reminiscent of epidermal growth factor repeats found in other soluble factors. Although it is possible that these cysteine residues solely mediate the intramolecular disulfide bond, we reasoned that some of these residues might mediate intermolecular disulfide bridges, leading to formation of higher order oligomers. We cotransfected 293T cells with V5 epitope-tagged RELMα and FLAG-tagged resistin or RELMβ cDNAs. 2 days later, the supernatants were collected and immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody. Fig. 5 shows that V5-tagged RELMα was coimmunoprecipitated with both FLAG-tagged RELMα and resistin, indicating that they formed oligomers. FLAG-tagged RELMβ served as a negative control, since it did not bind to RELMα. This experiment shows that RELMα forms a homo-oligomeric complex that is a dimer at a minimum. This is consistent with the migration of RELMα as a dimer and trimer as shown in Fig. 1 B. Since assessment of higher order multimers is difficult using such an epitope-tagging approach, we resorted to mass spectrometry to determine whether RELMα could form higher order oligomers than a dimer (see below). Interestingly, coimmunoprecipitation of RELMα with resistin shows that they are able to form heterooligomers (Fig. 5). This may serve to regulate their biological activity in vivo, since they are both secreted by adipocytes. Mass spectrometry has been successfully used to investigate disulfide bond formation in proteins. We subjected recombinant purified RELMα to nanoelectrospray mass spectrometry on a quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer before and after reduction of the sample. As shown in Fig.6 A, the unreduced sample showed several peaks corresponding to multiple charge states of RELMα. The molecular masses derived from the spectrum were 11,203.6 ± 0.7, 22,406.7 ± 1.5, and 33,611.8 ± 1.9, which are in agreement with monomeric, dimeric, and trimeric forms of RELMα. Reduction of the sample abolished the dimeric and trimeric species from the mass spectrum, since only a single charge series with a derived molecular mass of 11,212.9 ± 0.2 was observed (Fig.6 B). These molecular masses correspond to the calculated mass of RELMα with all 10 cysteine residues in their reduced state. These findings confirm the oligomerization pattern that was predicted for RELMα based on its migration on electrophoretic gels under reducing and nonreducing conditions (Fig. 1 B). Since our studies regarding oligomeric nature of RELMα were performed using the recombinant form, we decided to check whether such oligomerization also occurs in vivo. For this purpose, we generated rabbit polyclonal antibody against mouse RELMα. A synthetic peptide corresponding to 15 amino acids at the amino terminus was used as an immunogen as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Equal amounts of mouse serum were resolved on SDS-PAGE under reducing or nonreducing conditions followed by Western blotting with anti-RELMα antibody. As shown in Fig. 7(left panel), only a single band with an approximate size of 10 kDa was observed when the electrophoresis was performed under reducing conditions. When the same experiment was performed under nonreducing conditions (right panel), two extra bands in the region between 28 and 38 kDa were detected. All of these experiments clearly show that RELMα is capable of forming higher order oligomers that are mediated by covalent bonds between cysteine residues. Resistin and Related Molecules, RELMα and RELMβ, belong to a new family of cysteine-rich secreted proteins. Although their precise physiological role is not yet understood, resistin has been shown to be up-regulated during the process of adipocyte conversion, and its expression is down-regulated by thiazolidinediones. Administration of resistin to mice results in impaired glucose tolerance, suggesting that it may predispose to type II diabetes. More recently, resistin expression was shown to be greatly induced by refeeding of normal mice or administration of insulin to diabetic mice, and the addition of resistin inhibited conversion of preadipocytes into adipocytes (23Kim K.H. Lee K. Moon Y.S. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11252-11256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). This is analogous to leptin, which is also up-regulated dramatically by refeeding and by diabetes/insulin."
https://openalex.org/W1967194148,"The growth arrest-specific-3 (GAS3)/PMP22 proteins are members of the four-transmembrane (tetraspan) superfamily. Although the function of these proteins is poorly understood, GAS3/PMP22 proteins have been implicated in the control of growth and progression of certain cancers. Epithelial membrane protein-2 (EMP2), a GAS3/PMP22 family member, was recently identified as a putative tumor suppressor gene. Here, we addressed the normal function of EMP2 by testing the prediction that it influences integrin-related cell functions. We observed that EMP2 associates with the β1 integrin subunit. Co-immunoprecipitation and immunodepletion experiments indicated that ∼60% of β1integrins and EMP2 can be isolated in common protein complexes. Whereas this association between EMP2 and β1 integrin may be direct or indirect, it has features of integrin heterodimer selectivity. Thus, by laser confocal microscopy, EMP2 colocalized with α6β1 but not α5β1 integrin. Increased expression of EMP2 also influenced the integrin heterodimer repertoire present on the plasma membrane. EMP2 specifically increased the surface expression of the α6β1 integrin while decreasing that of the α5β1 protein. Reciprocally, reduction in EMP2 expression using a specific ribozyme decreased surface expression of α6β1 integrin. Accordingly, these EMP2-mediated changes resulted in a dramatic alteration in cellular adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins.

Functionally, the best understood tetraspan proteins are connexins, which form the major structural elements of gap junctions. On the other hand, tetraspanins have recently gained prominence for their role as “molecular facilitators” in the assembly of mixed protein signaling complexes, including those involving integrins (1Berditchevski F. Odintsova E. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 477-492Google Scholar, 2Maecker H.T. Todd S.C. Levy S. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 428-442Google Scholar). Functionally, tetraspanins have been shown to influence integrin-mediated events such as cell proliferation, migration, and tumor cell invasion in a variety of cell types (3Berditchevski F.

Berditchevski F. Harler M.B. Reichner J. Hemler M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2751-2765Google Scholar). Currently, there are at least six known members of the GAS3/PMP22 family: PMP22, EMP1 (or TMP), EMP2 (or XMP), EMP3 (or YMP), PERP, and brain cell membrane protein 1 (9Attardi L.D. Reczek E.E.

These genes share ∼30–40% amino acid identity (11Taylor V. Suter U. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 175: 115-120Google Scholar, 13Wang C.X. Wadehra M. Fisk B.C. Goodglick L. Braun J. Blood. 2001; 97: 3890-3895Google Scholar). All GAS3/PMP22 members are predicted to contain two extracellular loops and a small cytoplasmic tail, but beyond this structural information, little is known about the endogenous function(s) associated with most of the family members. What is known is that many of these proteins appear to be involved with cell proliferation, cell-cell, and cell-matrix interactions and/or myelin formation. Dysregulation of certain family members has been linked with disease (11Taylor V. Suter U. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 175: 115-120Google Scholar, 14Naef R. Suter U. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1998; 41: 359-371Google Scholar). For example, PMP22 has gained prominence due to the fact that genetic alterations in this gene (e.g. mutations, deletions, or duplications) lead to peripheral neuropathies such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A and Dejerrine Sottas syndrome (14Naef R. Suter U. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1998; 41: 359-371Google Scholar, 15Dackovic J. Rakocevic-Stojanovic V. Pavlovic S. Zamurovic N. Dragasevic N. Romac S. Apostolski S. Eur.

Neurochem. 1993; 61: 1961-1964Google Scholar). Epithelial membrane protein-2 (EMP2) was first identified based on its homology to PMP22 (11Taylor V. Suter U. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 175: 115-120Google Scholar). Our laboratory initially encountered EMP2 as part of a search for genes involved in the malignant progression of B cell lymphomas using suppression subtractive hybridization (13Wang C.X. Wadehra M. Fisk B.C. Goodglick L. Braun J. Blood. 2001; 97: 3890-3895Google Scholar). Disruption of EMP2 yielded dramatic phenotypes. Specifically, in a model of B cell lymphoma progression, EMP2 appears to act as a tumor suppressor (13Wang C.X. Wadehra M. Fisk B.C. Goodglick L. Braun J. Blood. 2001; 97: 3890-3895Google Scholar). Moreover, ectopic overexpression of in cultured cells promoted stress-induced apoptosis (13Wang C.X. Wadehra M. Fisk B.C. Goodglick L. Braun J. Blood. 2001; 97: 3890-3895Google Scholar). In this study, we begin to address the biochemical function of GAS3/PMP22 family members. We test the idea that they may share with tetraspanins the capacity to interact with integrins (1Berditchevski F. Odintsova E. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 477-492Google Scholar, 18Sugiura T. Berditchevski F. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1375-1389Google Scholar, 19Penas P.F. Garcia-Diez A. Sanchez-Madrid F. Yanez-Mo M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2000; 114: 1126-1135Google Scholar). Integrins are αβ heterodimeric receptors that bind and organize cellular responses to ECM proteins and cellular receptors (21Shimizu Y. Hum. Cell. 1996; 9: 175-180Google Scholar, 22Dedhar S. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 1999; 6: 37-43Google Scholar). There is exceptional combinatorial diversity in this receptor system, with 16 α and 9 β subunits and alternate splicing of individual subunits (11Taylor V. Suter U. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 175: 115-120Google Scholar, 23Meredith Jr., J.E. Kiosses W.B. Takada Y. Schwartz M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8111-8116Google Scholar). Individual integrin αβ heterodimers display distinct specificities for various ECM proteins and cell surface receptors, so changes in the expression of these various integrins have profound effects on the repertoire of cell proliferation, survival, adhesion, and migration (12Christophe-Hobertus C. Szpirer C. Guyon R. Christophe D. Genomics. 2001; 2: 3-10Google Scholar, 14Naef R. Suter U. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1998; 41: 359-371Google Scholar, 24Keely P. Parise L. Juliano R. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 101-106Google Scholar). The present study tests whether EMP2 phenotypic effects are mediated through its interaction with integrins. We show that EMP2 associates with the β1 integrin subunit and appears to have a selective effect on the surface expression of the α6β1 integrin heterodimer. This change in integrin expression mediated by EMP2 confers unique binding properties onto the cell, namely adhesion to the ECM component laminin. These observations reflect an important role for EMP2 in the regulation of an integrin-mediated cellular phenotype. An EMP2-specific hammerhead ribozyme was constructed and used to decrease the endogenous expression of EMP2 in NIH3T3 cells (25McCall M.J. Hendry P. Jennings P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5710-5714Google Scholar). Briefly, two complementary 42-bp oligonucleotides, EMP2Rz1a and EMP2Rz1s, were synthesized by Invitrogen. The sequences were as follows: EMP2Rz1a, 5′-TCATCATTGTTTCGTCCTTTCGGACTCATCAGTTCCACATCG-3′; EMP2Rz1s, 5′-CGATGTGGAACTCAGGAGTCCGAAAGGACGAAACAATGATGA-3′. Incorporated into these oligonucleotides was the 22 bases of the hammerhead ribozyme conserved catalytic core (underlined) and two 10 nucleotide EMP2-specific recognition domains (GenBankTMaccession number AF346627; nucleotides 204–224 of the murine EMP2). To construct the ribozyme, the two oligonucleotides were phosphorylated, hybridized to one other, and ligated into the unique HpaI site located in the 3′-untranslated region of the green fluorescent protein gene in plasmid pEGFP-N3 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). NIH3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 2 mml-glutamine (Invitrogen), 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin (Invitrogen), and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). NIH3T3 cells stably expressing a FLAG-tagged murine EMP2 (referred to as “3T3/EMP2”) or an empty vector control (referred to as “3T3/V”) were established as previously described (13Wang C.X. Wadehra M. Fisk B.C. Goodglick L. Braun J. Blood. 2001; 97: 3890-3895Google Scholar). NIH3T3 cells were also stably transfected with the EMP2-specific ribozyme vector (described above; pEGP-N3-EMP2) using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) per the manufacturer's instructions. Stable clones were selected using Geneticin (800 μg/ml; Invitrogen). NIH3T3 cells transfected with the ribozyme construct were referred to as “3T3/RIBO.” Both 3T3/EMP2 and 3T3/RIBO represent pooled, heterogeneous populations of stably transfected cells. All cells were grown at 37 °C in a humidified, 5% CO2 atmosphere. In vivo ribozyme cleavage of EMP2 transcripts was verified by Northern analysis. Total RNA was isolated from NIH3T3 or 3T3/RIBO cells using an RNA purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). RNA (5 μg) was subjected to agarose electrophoresis, transferred to a nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences) by capillary action, and cross-linked by UV irradiation (Stratalinker; Stratagene, San Diego, CA). A full-length EMP2 cDNA fragment (516 bp) was labeled using random primer synthesis (Amersham Biosciences) with [32P]dCTP as previously described (13Wang C.X. Wadehra M. Fisk B.C. Goodglick L. Braun J. Blood. 2001; 97: 3890-3895Google Scholar). Membranes were prehybridized with Rapid-Hyb buffer (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h and hybridized with labeled probe for 2 h at 65 °C. Blots were washed with a high stringency buffer (60 °C, 0.1× SSC, and 0.5% SDS) and exposed to x-ray film. Rabbit polyclonal anti-EMP2 antibodies were produced as previously described (13Wang C.X. Wadehra M. Fisk B.C. Goodglick L. Braun J. Blood. 2001; 97: 3890-3895Google Scholar). The anti-integrin monoclonal antibodies used were from cell clones 346-11A (anti-β4), G0H3 (anti-α6), and 5H10-27 (anti-α5) (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA). The anti-β1 integrin antibody clones 9EG7 and 18 were purchased from BD Biosciences. Monoclonal anti-β1 integrin antibody TS2/16 was provided by Dr. D. Chang (UCLA School of Medicine). Purified monoclonal rat anti-CD9 (MZ3) was provided by Dr. J. Kearney (University of Alabama, Birmingham) (27Won W.J. Kearney J.F. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 5605-5611Google Scholar). An anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (M2) was purchased from Sigma. Rabbit preimmune sera or isotype-matched antibodies were used as negative controls. NIH3T3 (5 × 106), 3T3/V (5 × 106), or 3T3/EMP2 (5 × 106) cells were washed two times with PBS, placed in lysis solution (1% Nonidet P-40 containing 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml, pepstatin, 10 mm iodoacetamide, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, and 10 mmKCl), and solubilized for 30 min at 4 °C. Lysates were sonicated for 15 s, and the insoluble materials were pelleted at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. The cell lysates were precleared by incubation with protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Precleared lysates were divided into three tubes and incubated overnight with agarose beads bound to either anti-EMP2 rabbit polyclonal antisera, an anti-β1 monoclonal antibody (clone TS2/16), or isotype control IgG. The beads were washed three or four times in lysis solution and finally in 50 mmTris buffer (pH 8). Immune complexes were eluted from the beads using Laemmli sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.01% bromphenol blue, 2% β-mercaptoethanol). EMP2 contains multiple glycosylation sites (13Wang C.X. Wadehra M. Fisk B.C. Goodglick L. Braun J. Blood. 2001; 97: 3890-3895Google Scholar). In order to detect EMP2 in coimmunoprecipitation experiments, N-linked glycans were cleaved using peptide:N-glycanase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Eluates were treated as per the manufacturer's instructions at 37 °C for 2 h. Eluted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were stained with Ponceau S (Sigma) to determine transfer efficiency. Membranes were blocked with 10% low fat milk in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and probed with an anti-β1 integrin monoclonal antibody or EMP2 antisera. Protein bands were visualized using a horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody (BD Biosciences; Southern Biotechnology Associates, Birmingham, AL) by chemiluminescence (ECL;Amersham Biosciences). Experiments were repeated at least four times. NIH3T3 (1 × 107), 3T3/V (1 × 107), or 3T3/EMP2 (1 × 107) cells were lysed and solubilized as described above. Each lysate was divided into three equal portions to be immunodepleted overnight using (i) protein-A/G agarose alone, (ii) protein-A/G agarose plus EMP2 antisera, or (iii) protein A/G-agarose plus an anti-β1 integrin antibody (clone TS2/16). Samples were centrifuged, and the unbound supernatant was collected. This supernatant was diluted 1:1 in 2× Laemmli buffer and boiled for 5 min. Samples were treated with peptide:N-glycanase as described above for EMP2 detection. Supernatants were then subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western analysis. Protein expression was quantitated using the Personal Densitometer SI and ImageQuanNT software (Amersham Biosciences). Stoichiometry was calculated by dividing the volume intensities before and after immunodepletion as described by Stipp et al. (28Stipp C.S. Orlicky D. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4853-4862Google Scholar). Experiments were repeated three times. A standard static adhesion assay (15–20 min) was performed as previously described (29Weitzman J.B. Pasqualini R. Takada Y. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8651-8657Google Scholar). Briefly, 96-well plates were precoated overnight with the ECM substrates laminin, fibronectin, poly-d-lysine (Roche Molecular Biochemicals; 5–10 μg/ml), or 1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (Sigma). For collagen I or collagen IV (Becton Dickinson Labware, Bedford, MA), plates were coated 2 h as per the manufacturer's instructions. Cells (7 × 104) were plated onto the ECM in serum-free conditions and incubated at 37 °C. Unbound cells were washed away. Bound cells were stained with toluidine blue and then lysed using 2% SDS (Biowhittaker, Walkersville, MD). The resultant soluble toluidine blue was quantitated by measuring the absorbance at 595 nm. Binding to each ECM was performed in triplicate. Each experiment was repeated at least three times. An unpaired Student'st test was used to confirm significance between 3T3/EMP2 and 3T3/V as well as between 3T3/V and 3T3/RIBO. In antibody blocking experiments, cells were preincubated with various dilutions of anti-α5 or anti-α6 integrin monoclonal antibody for 60 min at 4 °C. Cells (7 × 104) were aliquoted into a 96-well plate precoated with laminin or poly-d-lysine and allowed to adhere for 30 min. Unbound cells were washed away, and bound cells were quantitated as described above. Each experiment was repeated five times. 3T3/V, 3T3/RIBO, or 3T3/EMP2 cells were plated overnight onto glass coverslips (Fisher). Cells were fixed and permeabilized in cold methanol for 30 min at −20 °C and then blocked with 1% normal goat serum for 45 min. Cells were incubated 2 h at room temperature in a humidified chamber with the primary antibody and then washed 3–4 times with PBS plus 0.01% Triton X-100 (PBST). Cells were incubated overnight with a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated donkey anti-rat IgG and Texas Red-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) at 4 °C in a humidified chamber. Cells were washed with PBST, rinsed briefly with double-distilled H2O, and mounted onto microscope slides using a 3.5%n-propyl gallate-glycerol solution (Sigma). Laser-scanning confocal microscopy was used to assess the distribution and colocalization of proteins. Samples were analyzed using a Fluoview laser-scanning confocal microscope (Olympus America Inc., Melville, NY). To simultaneously detect FITC-labeled and Texas Red-labeled cells, samples were excited with argon and krypton lasers at 488 and 568 nm. Light emitted between 525 and 540 nm or above 630 nm was recorded for FITC or Texas Red, respectively. 20–30 horizontal (x,y) sections were obtained at 0.5-μm intervals. Colocalization experiments were studied in singlex-y optical sections and merged using the Fluoview image analysis software (version 2.1.39). In all experiments, cells were observed using a 60× oil immersion objective. Each experiment was repeated at least four times. The membrane expression of α5, α6, and β1 integrin subunits was assessed by flow cytometry. Cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde (w/v) in PBS for 20 min on ice. Cells were incubated with primary antibody (1:200) for 30 min on ice in PBS plus 2% fetal calf serum, washed two times, and then incubated with red-phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-rat Ig, κ light chain antibody (0.25 μg/106 cells; BD Biosciences) for 30 min on ice. Negative control cells were incubated with the secondary antibody alone. After two consecutive washes, cells were resuspended in PBS and analyzed with a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Integrin expression levels were calculated as mean fluorescent intensity (MFI). Experiments were repeated three times. In order to elucidate the cellular function of EMP2, we first created a number of cell lines engineered to express different levels of the gene. We capitalized on the fact that wild type NIH3T3 cells express moderate levels of EMP2, so we could create variants that overexpressed (3Berditchevski F. Bazzoni G. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17784-17790Google Scholar) or underexpressed (described below) this gene compared with the wild type cells. The latter was accomplished through the stable introduction of an EMP2-specific hammerhead ribozyme vector (30Amarzguioui M. Prydz H. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 1175-1202Google Scholar), which down-regulates EMP2 expression by specific cleavage of its transcript. Northern blot analysis was used to directly validate that the EMP2-specific ribozyme cleaved the EMP2 message (Fig.1 A). Wild type NIH3T3 cells yielded a single EMP2 transcript at 4.8 kb (Fig. 1 A). However, NIH3T3 cells stably transfected with an EMP2 ribozyme (called 3T3/RIBO cells) retained only a minimal signal for the normal transcript and displayed an additional lower band representing the cleaved EMP2 transcript (arrow). The residual intact EMP2 transcript probably reflects variable ribozyme expression in this nonclonal transfectant population. We used Western analysis to characterize the protein levels of EMP2 in empty vector control NIH3T3 cells (3T3/V), cells expressing a FLAG-tagged recombinant EMP2 (3T3/EMP2), and cells expressing the EMP2-specific ribozyme (3T3/RIBO) (Fig. 1 B, upper panel). Compared with 3T3/V cells, EMP2 protein levels were higher in 3T3/EMP2 cells and undetectable in 3T3/RIBO. Western analysis was also performed to measure the levels of an independent tetraspan protein (the tetraspanin, CD9). Protein levels of CD9 were unaffected among the three recombinant 3T3 cell lines (Fig. 1 B,lower panel). These observations indicated that our recombinant 3T3 cell lines were modified as intended for EMP2 expression and suggested that the modification was specific for EMP2. Using these engineered NIH3T3 variants, we examined the normal cellular function of EMP2. Initially, we chose a candidate approach drawing on the observation that numerous members of the tetraspanins associated with integrin dimers containing the β1 subunit (12Christophe-Hobertus C. Szpirer C. Guyon R. Christophe D. Genomics. 2001; 2: 3-10Google Scholar, 13Wang C.X. Wadehra M. Fisk B.C. Goodglick L. Braun J. Blood. 2001; 97: 3890-3895Google Scholar, 22Dedhar S. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 1999; 6: 37-43Google Scholar). Specifically, we sought to establish whether EMP2 associated with integrins and/or modified integrin-dependent function. In order to determine whether EMP2 and the β1 integrin subunit could associate, a coimmunoprecipitation approach was employed. Cellular lysates were produced from NIH3T3 (or 3T3/V) and 3T3/EMP2 cells, incubated with an anti-β1 integrin antibody to immunoprecipitate this molecule, and subjected to Western analysis using EMP2 antisera. As shown in Fig.2 A, Western analysis demonstrated that EMP2 immunoprecipitated with the β1 integrin subunit. The reciprocal experiment showed similar results; lysates treated with an anti-EMP2 antibody immunoprecipitated EMP2 plus β1 integrin protein (Fig.2 B). Positive controls, in which EMP2 and β1integrin immunoprecipitates were probed for the cognate protein (Fig.2, C and D), suggested that a substantial amount of these proteins were in a common coimmunoprecipitable complex. To estimate the fraction of the β1 integrin subunit that associates with EMP2, immunodepletion experiments were performed according to the procedure of Stipp et al. (28Stipp C.S. Orlicky D. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4853-4862Google Scholar) (see “Materials and Methods”). Lysates of 3T3/V or 3T3/EMP2 cell lysates were incubated overnight with anti-β1 integrin antibody or EMP2 antisera, and the antibody with bound proteins was then immunodepleted using protein A/G beads. The amounts of EMP2 and β1 integrin in the lysates before and after immunodepletion were quantitated by Western analysis and densitometry, and these values were used to calculate the percentage of protein in the coimmunoprecipitation (Fig. 2, E and F). As expected, anti-EMP2 and anti-β1 integrin each depleted >90% of their cognate antigen (EMP2 and β1 integrin, respectively). Anti-EMP2 immunoprecipitation coimmunoprecipitated 56% of the β1 integrin subunit from 3T3/V cells and 70% from 3T3/EMP2 cells. Anti-β1 integrin antibody coimmunoprecipitated ∼65% of EMP2 in both cell types. Taken together, these data indicate that ∼60% of β1 integrin and EMP2 pools (the averages of the depletion numbers above) are present in a common co-immunoprecipitable complex after Nonidet P-40 solubilization. This association between EMP2 and β1integrin may be direct or indirect. However, it should be noted that the interaction between EMP2 and β1 integrin was preserved in the presence of 1% Nonidet P-40, which unlike certain other nonionic detergents (CHAPS, Brij-97) disrupts most tetraspan-tetraspan interactions observed after such detergent solubilization (7Serru V., Le Naour F. Billard M. Azorsa D.O. Lanza F. Boucheix C. Rubinstein E. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 103-111Google Scholar, 8Yauch R.L. Berditchevski F. Harler M.B. Reichner J. Hemler M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2751-2765Google Scholar, 32Yauch R.L. Kazarov A.R. Desai B. Lee R.T. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9230-9238Google Scholar). It thus appears that the association was not due to this type of nonspecific hydrophobic interactions. We further examined the association and colocalization of EMP2 and the β1 integrin subunit using laser-scanning confocal microscopy. NIH3T3, 3T3/V, or 3T3/EMP2 cells were stained with anti-β1 integrin and anti-EMP2, and serial laser confocal images were captured and analyzed using Fluoview image analysis software (Fig. 3). In NIH3T3 (not shown) or 3T3/V cells (Fig. 3), EMP2 expression is predominantly perinuclear, with an additional component of dispersed cytoplasm granules and low levels of plasma membrane expression. The perinuclear staining is consistent with endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus localization. 2M. Wadehra, L. Goodglick, and J. Braun, unpublished data. Overexpression of EMP2 in 3T3/EMP2 cells resulted in increased EMP2 on the plasma membrane. When 3T3/V cells were double-labeled with anti-EMP2 and anti-β1 integrin, there was a significant colocalization of staining both in the perinuclear region and cytoplasmic vesicles. In 3T3/EMP2 cells, β1 integrin colocalized with EMP2 on the plasma membrane. These results were specific for β1integrin, since no colocalization was observed between EMP2 and another tetraspan protein, CD9, in either 3T3/V or 3T3/EMP2 cells (data not shown). We next examined whether the apparent association of EMP2 with the β1 integrin subunit had functional consequences. Specifically, we tested whether modulation of EMP2 expression affected the binding of cells to the ECM. To evaluate this, 3T3/V, 3T3/EMP2, and 3T3/RIBO cells were incubated for 15–20 min in plates coated with various ECM proteins (laminin, fibronectin, collagen I, collagen IV). Poly-d-lysine and 1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin were used as positive and negative substrates, respectively. Unbound cells were rinsed away, and the attached cells were stained with toluidine blue and quantitated as described under “Materials and Methods.” Interestingly, the cells that overexpressed EMP2 (3T3/EMP2 cells) exhibited an approximate 2-fold increase in laminin binding compared with 3T3/V cells (p < 0.05; Fig.4 A), and a 4-fold increase in laminin binding compared with 3T3/RIBO (p < 0.005; Fig. 4 A). In contrast to the results with laminin, EMP2 expression levels inversely correlated with fibronectin binding. Specifically, the cells with lower levels of EMP2 (3T3/RIBO cells) demonstrated significantly greater binding to fibronectin compared with either 3T3/V or 3T3/EMP2 cells (Fig. 4 B). Within the 15–20-min incubation period, none of the cell variants displayed significant binding to collagen I or IV even in the presence of Mn2+, which is known to enhance integrin-mediated adhesion (34Kern A. Marcantonio E.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 176: 634-641Google Scholar) (data not shown). Laminin binding is primarily, although not exclusively, mediated by the α6β1 integrin (35Belkin A.M. Stepp M.A. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2000; 51: 280-301Google Scholar). To verify that laminin binding in 3T3/V and 3T3/EMP2 cells was mediated by α6integrins, we tested whether an anti-α6 integrin would successfully block this interaction. Cells were incubated with anti-α6 integrin or with anti-α5 integrin as a control and then allowed to adhere to a laminin-coated plate for 30 min. As anticipated, anti-α6 integrin but not anti-α5 integrin antibodies specifically reduced binding of 3T3/V and 3T3/EMP2 cells to laminin-coated plates (Fig. 4,C and D). We demonstrated above that EMP2 could coprecipitate with the β1 integrin subunit and that EMP2 levels could modulate binding to laminin presumably through altering the expression and/or activity of the α6 integrin subunit. Here we assessed whether EMP2 colocalized with the α6 integrin subunit and whether altered protein levels of EMP2 would modulate the cellular distribution of the α6 integrin protein"

To inhibit cadmium-induced damage, cells respond by increasing the expression of genes that encode stress-response proteins. We previously reported the identification of 48 cadmium-inducible mRNAs in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Here we describe a new cadmium-responsive gene, designated cdr-1, whose rate and level of inducible expression parallel those of the C. elegansmetallothioneins. The CDR-1 mRNA contains an open reading frame of 831 bp and encodes a predicted 32-kDa, integral membrane protein. Following cadmium exposure, cdr-1 is transcribed exclusively in intestinal cells of post-embryonic C. elegans. In vivo, the CDR-1 protein is targeted specifically to the intestinal cell lysosomes. cdr-1transcription is significantly induced by cadmium but not by other tested stressors. These results indicate that cdr-1expression is regulated by cadmium and in a cell-specific fashion. Inhibition of CDR-1 expression renders C. eleganssusceptible to cadmium toxicity. In conclusion, cdr-1defines a new class of cadmium-inducible genes and encodes an integral membrane, lysosomal protein. This protein functions to protect against cadmium toxicity.

Toxicological responses of cadmium exposure include kidney damage, respiratory diseases, neurological disorders, and lung, kidney, prostate, and testicular cancers (4Waalkes M., P. Coogan T.P. Barter R.A. Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 1992; 22: 175-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Cadmium induces intracellular damage via the (a) nonspecific inactivation/denaturation of proteins, by binding to free sulfhydryl residues; (b) displacement of zinc co-factors from a variety of proteins, including transcription factors; and (c) generation of reactive oxygen species, which ultimately oxidize DNA, proteins, and lipids. Although cadmium itself is not redox activein vivo and cannot directly catalyze the reduction of molecular oxygen, it has been suggested that the production of reactive oxygen species is a consequence of a cadmium-induced depletion of cellular glutathione or the inactivation of copper/zinc-superoxide dismutase (5Stohs S.J.

The functions of these proteins can be broadly defined, because those that repair intracellular damage or those that remove the toxicants (e.g. cadmium, reactive oxygen species). To remove toxicants, cells activate the transcription of genes that encode proteins that are involved in scavenging reactive oxygen species, including heme oxygenase, γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase, superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (7Hamer D.H.

Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4707) Google Scholar). Forty-eight differentially expressed mRNAs, which correspond to the products of thirty-two independent genes, were identified in the non-parasitic nematodeCaenorhabditis elegans (17Liao V.H.

In the collection of cadmium-responsive C. elegans ESTs identified by differential display, four were derived from an identical mRNA (17Liao V.H. Freedman J.H. J. Biol.

Here we describe the isolation and characterization of the full-length mRNA and the gene, designated cdr-1(cadmium-responsive gene family), from which the ESTs were derived. CDR-1 encodes a novel protein, which is transcribed exclusively in the intestinal cells of post-embryonicC. elegans and is targeted to lysosomes. Transcription of cdr-1 is activated in response to cadmium exposure, whereas several common environmental stressors are not effective inducers. This is unique among metal-inducible genes, which are typically activated by multiple stressors (7Hamer D.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 913-951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Kiang J.G. Tsokos G.C. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 80: 183-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar). In contrast, the level of responsiveness and sensitivity of cdr-1 to cadmium exposure are comparable to those previously reported for the twoC. elegans MT genes, mtl-1 and mtl-2(19Freedman J.H. Slice L.W. Dixon D. Fire A. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2554-2564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When CDR-1 expression is inhibited, and nematodes are exposed to cadmium in vivo, the pseudo-ceolomic space accumulates fluid. In addition, reproduction and development are inhibited. The results presented in the current report support the hypothesis thatcdr-1 represents a new class of metal-responsive genes that encode novel defense/repair proteins. The Bristol N2 strain of C. elegans was grown on NGM agar plates at 20 °C as previously described (17Liao V.H. Freedman J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31962-31970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To obtain large quantities of C. elegans, nematodes were grown in liquid S medium using Escherichia coli OP50 as a food source. In experiments where nematodes were exposed to cadmium, the S medium was supplemented with 100 μm CdCl2 (19Freedman J.H. Slice L.W. Dixon D. Fire A. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2554-2564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The four ESTs identified by differential display that are derived from CDR-1 (DDRT2, DDRT7, DDRT16, and DDRT26; accession numbers: AF071362, AF071398, AF0771356, andAF071379, respectively) are between 217 and 240 bp in length and come from the 3′-end of the mRNA (17Liao V.H. Freedman J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31962-31970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The full-length sequence of CDR-1 was obtained using the 5′-rapid amplification of complementary DNA ends (5′-RACE) protocol as previously described (19Freedman J.H. Slice L.W. Dixon D. Fire A. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2554-2564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cDNA was synthesized from 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA that was isolated from cadmium-treated C. elegans, and the cDNA was then tailed with ∼20 dA residues. Subsequently, the tailed-cDNA was mixed with 10 pmol of 5′ anchor oligo(dT) primer (5′-CGTCTAGAGATGCATGCATC(T)19-3′), 25 pmol of 5′ anchor primer (5′-CGTCTAGAGATGCATGCATC-3′) and 25 pmol of the 3′ gene-specific primer VHCL3 (5′-CACATAGTAAAGTCCTTTGG-3′). This primer is the inverse complement of nt 829–848 (relative to the transcription start site) in the cDNA encoding CDR-1. The CDR-1 cDNA was amplified by 30 cycles of the PCR using the following conditions: denaturation at 94 °C for 60 s, annealing at 50 °C for 90 s, and extension at 72 °C for 60 s. The products of this reaction were then subjected to a second round of the PCR using the conditions described above with the following modifications: the 5′ anchor oligo(dT) primer was omitted, the annealing temperature was raised to 60 °C, and the magnesium concentration was increased from 1.5 to 3 mm. In addition, the 3′ gene-specific primer VHCL3 was replaced with an alternative gene-specific primer VHCL4 (5′-TATCTAGAAGTCCTTTTCGAGAACATCC-3′). The sequence of VHCL4 is the inverse complement of nt 762–783 in CDR-1. The amplified DNA was subsequently purified, inserted into the pGEM-T vector (Promega), and sequenced. Sequence analysis showed that this protocol did not produce a full-length CDR-1 cDNA (i.e. the fragment did not include an initiator ATG codon). To obtain cDNAs that include the 5′-end of the CDR-1 mRNA, a third 5′-RACE reaction was performed. The cDNA products obtained in the reaction containing the 5′ anchor primer and VHCL4 were subjected to an additional round of the PCR using the conditions described above except VHCL4 was replaced with the primer VHCL10 (5′-TTGTAGAATTCGTCGACAGC-3′). VHCL10 is the inverse complement of nt 463–482 and includes a uniqueEcoRI restriction site, which is present in the CDR-1 cDNA (underlined). Products of this reaction were purified, inserted into the pGEM-T vector, and sequenced. Sequence analysis confirmed that the 5′-end of CDR-1 was isolated using this protocol. A cDNA clone that contained the full-length CDR-1 sequence was subsequently created by first digesting a plasmid that contained the 3′-end of CDR-1, pGEM-VHCL3, with NcoI and EcoRI. Following agarose gel electrophoresis, a 3377-bp fragment was isolated. This fragment contained the pGEM-T vector and 377 bp of the 3′-end of the CDR-1 cDNA, which includes the translation stop codon. A cDNA fragment that contained the 5′-end of the CDR-1 was obtained following the digestion of the plasmid pGEM-VHCL10 with NcoI and EcoRI. A 488-bp fragment, which includes the translation start site, 5′-untranslated region, and 15 bp of the pGEM multiple cloning site, was purified, inserted into the 3377-bp plasmid, and sequenced. Sequence analysis confirmed the presence of a full-length CDR-1 cDNA clone. This plasmid was designated pGEM5-CDR-1. Analysis of nucleotide and amino acid sequence data, including assembly of continuous cDNA sequences, sequence comparisons, and data base searches were performed using PCGENE-IntelliGenetics software (IntelliGenetics, Mountainview, CA) and BLAST programs (31Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar, 32Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar). Genomic sequence data were obtained from theC. elegans Genome Project (available through the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute). The location within the C. elegansgenome of cdr-1 was determined using ACeDb (AC. e legans Database) (33Eeckman F.H. Durbin R. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 48: 583-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). BLAST nucleotide sequence analysis identified several cosmids that include the entirecdr-1 coding and potential 5′-regulatory regions. One of these cosmids, F35E8 (accession number: Z81529), was obtained from theC. elegans Genome Project. To isolate a genomic fragment that contains cdr-1, F35E8 was digested with XbaI. Based on the sequence data, F35E8 contains two XbaI sites at 15,882 and 21,707, which flank the 5′- and 3′-ends of cdr-1. Following XbaI digestion, a 5,825-bp fragment was purified and then inserted into pGEM3zf(−), which was cut with XbaI. TotalC. elegans RNA was prepared from washed nematodes as previously described (19Freedman J.H. Slice L.W. Dixon D. Fire A. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2554-2564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For some experiments poly(A)+RNA was purified using the Poly (A) Tract System, following the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Northern blot analysis was performed using 32P-labeled EST clone DDRT16 or full-length CDR-1 cDNA as probes, as previously described (19Freedman J.H. Slice L.W. Dixon D. Fire A. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2554-2564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PhosphorImager analysis and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamic System) were used to determine the amount of probe that hybridized to the RNA. After the amount of CDR-1 was determined, the bound probe was removed by incubating the membrane at 95 °C for 1 h in 0.1% SDS. The RNA was then re-hybridized to a32P-labeled C. elegans myosin light-chain probe, which served as a loading control. The steady-state level of CDR-1 mRNA was normalized to that of the constitutively expressed myosin light-chain mRNAs (∼1150 and 680 nt) (34Cummins C. Anderson P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 5339-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The rate of CDR-1 mRNA accumulation following cadmium exposure was determined by exposing C. elegans to 100 μm cadmium for different times (19Freedman J.H. Slice L.W. Dixon D. Fire A. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2554-2564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When cadmium was added, the culture contained nematodes at all stages of development and an adequate supply of food. After exposing C. elegans to cadmium for 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24 h, the nematodes were isolated, total RNA was then prepared and Northern blot analysis performed. The steady-state level of CDR-1 mRNA at each time point was normalized to the levels of the two myosin light-chain mRNAs. A ∼3.5-kbp fragment of genomic DNA that is immediately upstream from the initiator ATG in cdr-1 was prepared from the cosmid F35E8 by employing the PCR. The cdr-1 promoter/enhancer fragment was amplified by using Pfu polymerase and the primers VHCL11 and VHCL12. The 5′ primer VHCL12 (5′-CGCGGATCCCTAAGCCAGGATCATGCACC-3′) precedes a BamHI site in F35E8 and corresponds to nt 13,809–13,828 in the cosmid. The 3′ primer VHCL11 (5′-TCCCCCGGGACTTGAGACAGTAGTACATA-3′) is the reverse complement of nt 17,377–17,358 in F35E8. VHCL11 incorporates aSmaI site (underlined) at the 3′-end of the amplified product. The amplification conditions were as follows: denaturation at 94 °C for 45 s, annealing at 55 °C for 60 s, and extension at 72 °C for 9 min. Following amplification, the genomic fragment was purified and then digested with BamHI andSmaI. The fragment was then inserted into the C. elegans β-galactosidase expression vector pPD95.10, which was cut with the identical enzymes. The cdr-1/lacZ C. elegans vector expresses a β-galactosidase reporter gene that is preceded by the SV40 large T antigen nuclear targeting sequence. Thus, the 5′-promoter/enhancer region ofcdr-1 will control the expression of a β-galactosidase fusion enzyme that accumulates in nuclei (35Mello C. Fire A. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 48: 451-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). C. elegans were transformed by microinjecting a mixture of the recombinant reporter plasmid DNA (100 μg/ml) and a plasmid containing the dominant selectable marker gene rol-6 into the gonadal syncytium of young adult C. elegans as described previously (19Freedman J.H. Slice L.W. Dixon D. Fire A. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2554-2564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Mello C. Fire A. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 48: 451-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). Transgenic C. elegans were selected and maintained as indicated in previous studies (19Freedman J.H. Slice L.W. Dixon D. Fire A. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2554-2564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These lines of transgenic nematodes contain the reporter transgene as a heritable extrachromosomal array, which can be lost after several generations (35Mello C. Fire A. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 48: 451-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). To permanently integrate the array into the C. elegans genome, transgenic nematodes were exposed to 300 J/m2 of ultraviolet radiation. After several generations,C. elegans that contain the integrated transgene were isolated by identifying individual nematodes of which 100% of the progeny express the rol-6 phenotype. IntegratedC. elegans were out-crossed four times with a wild type strain to remove any mutations that may have occurred because of the radiation treatment. The transgenic strain used in the subsequent studies is designated JF9 (mtIs7,cdr-1/lacZ). Cell-specific, developmentally regulated patterns of cdr-1transcription were determined in cadmium-exposed and non-exposedC. elegans as previously described (19Freedman J.H. Slice L.W. Dixon D. Fire A. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2554-2564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transgenic C. elegans were fixed and stained for β-galactosidase activity as described in Freedman et al. (19Freedman J.H. Slice L.W. Dixon D. Fire A. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2554-2564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells that actively transcribe cdr-1 were identified from the level of β-galactosidase activity and visualized by microscopy. C. elegans JF9 (mtIs7, cdr-1/lacZ) were used to investigate the effects of exposure to heat shock, transition metals, and oxidative stress on cdr-1 transcription. The effect of heat shock on cdr-1 transcription was determined using conditions previously described (19Freedman J.H. Slice L.W. Dixon D. Fire A. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2554-2564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Stringham E.G. Candido E.P.M. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 1994; 13: 1211-1220Crossref Google Scholar). Briefly, transgenic C. elegans were incubated at 33 °C for 1.5 h. The nematodes were allowed to recover by incubating at 20 °C for 16 h. After the recovery period, nematodes were collected and the level of β-galactosidase activity was quantified from the amount of blue chromogen produced as previously described (37Cioci L.K. Qiu L. Freedman J.H. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 2000; 19: 2122-2129Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To examine the effects of metals and oxidative stress oncdr-1 transcription, nematodes were collected and then suspended in K medium (38Williams P.L. Dusenbery D.B. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 1990; 9: 1285-1290Crossref Google Scholar). C. elegans were exposed to CdCl2·2.5 H2O, CuSO4·5 H2O, ZnSO4·7 H2O, HgCl2, or Pb(NO3)2 with constant, gentle agitation at 20 °C for 24 h. The concentrations of added metals have been previously shown to induce the transcription ofmtl-2 and hsp-16 (36Stringham E.G. Candido E.P.M. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 1994; 13: 1211-1220Crossref Google Scholar, 37Cioci L.K. Qiu L. Freedman J.H. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 2000; 19: 2122-2129Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and are below their respective LC50 values (38Williams P.L. Dusenbery D.B. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 1990; 9: 1285-1290Crossref Google Scholar, 39Tatara C.P. Newman M.C. McCloskey J.T. Williams P.L. Aquat. Toxicol. (Amsterdam). 1997; 39: 279-290Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To induce oxidative stress, C. elegans were exposed to either paraquat or jugalone for 24 h at concentrations that are reported to inducehsp-16 and glutathione S-transferase transcription in C. elegans (24Tawe W.N. Eschbach M.L. Walter R.D. Henkle-Duhrsen K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1621-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar,36Stringham E.G. Candido E.P.M. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 1994; 13: 1211-1220Crossref Google Scholar). 2C. D. Link, University of Colorado Boulder, personal communication. The effects of these stressors on cdr-1 transcription were then determined from the levels of β-galactosidase activity. A population of wild type C. elegans at all developmental stages were treated with 100 μm cadmium for 24 h. Nematodes were isolated and fixed and the external collagenous cuticle was permeabilized and prehybridized as previously described (40Ross L.H. Freedman J.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22066-22075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Digoxigenin-labeled probes were then added to a suspension of fixed, permeabilized nematodes in 40% (v/v) formamide, 5× SSC, 0.1 mg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA, 50 μg/ml heparin, and 0.1% Tween 20. Hybridization was carried out at 48 °C for 16 h. To synthesize the digoxigenin-labeled probes, anchored PCR was employed using pGEM5-CDR-1 as a template. An antisense CDR-1 DNA probe was generated using plasmid DNA, which was linearized followingNcoI digestion, and a SP6 primer. A CDR-1 sense probe was prepared from linearized pGEM5-CDR-1, which was digested withNotI, and a T7 primer. Binding sites for both T7 and SP6 primers are in pGEM5zf(+) and flank the CDR-1 cDNA insert. Following the hybridization, C. elegans were washed and then incubated at 4 °C for 20 h with a 1:2500 dilution of alkaline phosphatase-linked anti-digoxigenin antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Following several washes, antigen-antibody complexes were visualized by incubating the nematodes with 4-nitroblue tetrazolium chloride and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) (40Ross L.H. Freedman J.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22066-22075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To determine the intracellular location of CDR-1 in vivo, a C. elegans expression vector was constructed in which the expression of a CDR-1-eGFP fusion protein is regulated by the cdr-1promoter. The eGFP contains the Ser-65 to Cys-65 substitution (41Heim R. Tsien R.Y. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 178-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1213) Google Scholar). To generate the CDR-1-eGFP fusion cDNA, full-length CDR-1 cDNA was prepared by the PCR using the primers VHCL14 (5′-CCGGTACCTTAATTGACATAGTAAAGTCC-3′) and VHCL15 (5′-TCCCCCGGGTCTCAAGTATGTTGG-3′). VHCL14 is the inverse complement of nt 834–854 in the CDR-1 cDNA. This primer introduces a KpnI site (underlined) at the 5′-end of the amplified product and converts the stop codon (boldface) to a serine residue (TGA → TCA). VHCL15 is identical to nt 6–22, and it adds aSmaI site to the 5′-end of the amplified product (underlined). Following amplification, the DNA was digested withSmaI and KpnI and then inserted into the C. elegans eGFP expression vector pPD117.01, which was digested with the same enzymes. The ∼3.5-kbp cdr-1 promoter/enhancer fragment, described above, was then inserted into BamHI andSmaI sites that are upstream of the CDR-1-eGFP cDNA in the expression vector. To remove the mec-7 promoter fragment that is present in the pPD117.01 vector, thecdr-1/CDR-1-eGFP expression plasmid was digested with SacII and BamHI. The ∼8.1-kbp plasmid was then purified; the ends were subsequently made blunt and then joined. Transgenic C. elegans were generated by microinjection as described above. This strain was designated JF13 (mtEx10,cdr-1/CDR-1-GFP). Prior to establishing the intracellular location of CDR-1, intestinal cell lysosomes of JF13 (mtEx10, cdr-1/CDR-1-GFP) C. elegans were rhodamine-labeled. This was accomplished by feeding transgenic nematodes RITC-dextran. It has been previously demonstrated that C. elegans accumulate RITC-dextran into intestinal cell lysosomes (42Clokey G.V. Jacobson L.A. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1986; 35: 79-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). To label the lysosomes, C. elegans were suspended in BU buffer (70 mm NaCl, 72 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0) that contained 10 mg/ml of RITC-dextran (Sigma Chemical Co.) (42Clokey G.V. Jacobson L.A. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1986; 35: 79-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). After incubating at 20 °C for 8 h, nematodes were washed three times with BU buffer and collected by centrifugation. To remove the unincorporated probe from the intestinal lumen, C. elegans were then placed on NGM plates with food and allowed to feed for 4 h. The nematodes were collected from the plates, suspended in M9 buffer and exposed to 100 μm cadmium at 20 °C for 16 h. As a control, an identical population of JF13 (mtEx10, cdr-1/CDR-1-GFP)C. elegans was grown in the absence of cadmium. The intracellular locations of CDR-1-eGFP and lysosomes were determined by fluorescence microscopy using eGFP- and rhodamine-specific filter sets, respectively. RNA interference experiments were performed by feeding wild type or JF13 (mtEx10,cdr-1/CDR-1-GFP) nematodes bacteria that express full-length CDR-1 dsRNA (43Timmons L. Fire A. Na"

NADPH is a required cofactor for the NADPH oxidase to produce reactive oxygen metabolites, an important microbicidal tool in host defense. p21-Activated kinases (Paks) are regulated by the GTPases Rac and Cdc42 and control actin dynamics and phosphorylation of the oxidase component p47phox. Here we report the interaction of Pak with phosphoglycerate mutase (PGAM)-B, an enzyme of the glycolytic pathway. Activated Pak1 inhibits glycolysis by association of its catalytic domain with PGAM-B and subsequent phosphorylation of the enzyme on serine residues 23 and 118, thereby abolishing PGAM activity. Leukocyte activation through chemoattractant receptors leads to Pak activation and transient inhibition of endogenous PGAM-B activity. Consistent with these observations, treatment of neutrophils with phosphoglycolic acid, a competitive PGAM-B inhibitor, increases upstream intermediates, thereby amplifying the respiratory burst.

The invasion of pathogens presents an acute challenge to the host organism, which requires an immediate defensive response. Innate immune cells, mainly macrophages, neutrophils, Kupffer cells, and microglia, are specialized in the physical destruction of the invading pathogen via phagocytosis and oxidative burst. These activities are elicited by the binding of chemoattractants including bacterial-derived formylated peptides (formyl-Met-Leu-Phe) to G protein-coupled receptors on the cell surface. The chemotactic stimulus leads to activation of the low molecular weight GTP-binding proteins Rac and Cdc42 and their downstream mediators p21-activated kinases (Paks) 1The abbreviations used are: Pak, p21-activated kinase; PGAM, phosphoglycerate mutase; PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; G6P, glucose 6-phosphate; ROS, reactive oxygen species, fMLF, formyl-Met-Leu-Phe; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; PGA, phosphoglycolic acid.

Rac and Pak signaling is essential in cytoskeletal reorganization including membrane ruffling and formation of filopodia and lamellipodia, thus enabling cell motility during the chemotactic response (3Hall A.

The NADPH oxidase converts molecular oxygen to superoxide anion by electron transport from NADPH, a process that involves translocation and association of active Rac, p67phox, and phosphorylated p47phox with membrane-bound cytochromeb 558 (7Quinn M.T. Evans T. Loetterle L.R. Jesaitis A.J. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20983-20987Google Scholar). Pak participates in this pathway by phosphorylation of several serine residues on p47phox, which are required for oxidase activity and possibly for assembly of the active oxidase (8Knaus U.G. Morris S. Dong H.J. Chernoff J. Bokoch G.M. Science. 1995; 269: 221-223Google Scholar). Neutrophils contain at least three Pak isoforms whose fMLF-induced activation kinetics coincide with Rac2 activation, p47phox phosphorylation, and oxidant production (8Knaus U.G. Morris S. Dong H.J. Chernoff J. Bokoch G.M. Science. 1995; 269: 221-223Google Scholar, 9Huang R. Lian J.P. Robinson D. Badwey J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7130-7138Google Scholar). Uptake and destruction of pathogens during phagocytosis are accompanied by simultaneous elevation of glucose transporter 1 translocation, glucose uptake, and oxygen consumption (10Stjernholm R.L. Sbarra A.J. Straus R.R. The Reticuloendothelial System. 2. Plenum Press, New York1980: 73-85Google Scholar, 11Zatti M. Rossi F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 99: 557-561Google Scholar, 12Hagi A. Hayashi H. Kishi K. Wang L. Ebina Y. J. Med. Investig. 2000; 47: 19-28Google Scholar). In resting neutrophils, 1.3% of the total glucose is utilized via the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), and this figure increases to 30% when activated by bacterial products (13Sbarra A.J. Karnovsky M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 1355-1362Google Scholar). The PPP is connected to the glycolytic pathway by branching off at the level of glucose 6-phosphate (G6P), generating NADPH, ribose-5-phosphate, and, finally, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, which then can be shunted back to glycolysis for oxidation to pyruvate. Phosphoglycerate mutase (PGAM) is an enzyme in the lower part of the glycolytic pathway that catalyzes the interconversion of 3- and 2-phosphoglycerate. In this study, we show a direct physical and functional connection between the Rac/Cdc42 effector Pak and the glycolytic enzyme PGAM, causing a switch from glycolysis to PPP in order to increase oxidative and microbicidal phagocyte responses. Isolation of human neutrophils from healthy donors, cytosol preparation, and four-step chromatography were performed as described previously (14Knaus U.G. Heyworth P.G. Kinsella B.T. Curnutte J.T.

Briefly, combined polymorphonuclear neutrophil cytosols were concentrated, followed by DEAE-Sephacel, gel filtration on Sephacel S-200, ion exchange chromatography on Mono Q, and hydrophobic interaction chromatography on heptylamine-Sepharose. Kinase reaction with purified recombinant Pak on column fractions or on recombinant PGAM was performed in kinase buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mmMnCl2, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 μm ATP) with 10 μCi of [32P]ATP/reaction. The reactions were analyzed using gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Combined hydrophobic interaction chromatography fractions containing a M r 30,000 Pak substrate (p30) were resolved on 20% SDS-PAGE, and the excised, Coomassie Blue-stained protein band was trypsin-digested and analyzed by mass spectrometry (W. M. Keck Biomedical Mass Spectrometry Laboratory). Monoclonal anti-His and 9E10 anti-Myc antibody (Covance, Richmond, CA), polyclonal anti-His and anti-Myc antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), polyclonal anti-Pak1 (8Knaus U.G. Morris S. Dong H.J. Chernoff J. Bokoch G.M. Science. 1995; 269: 221-223Google Scholar), and polyclonal anti-PGAM antibodies were prepared in rabbits by immunization with full-length affinity-purified PGAM or were gifts of Dr. K. Uchida (anti-PGAM-B) or Dr. F. Climent. Reagents for measurements of glycolysis intermediates, enzymes, and phosphoglycolic acid (PGA) were purchased from Sigma. A clone expressing PGAM-B was obtained from the IMAGE clone collection. PGAM-B was cloned into pPROEX htb with an amino-terminal His tag, into pCVM6 with a carboxyl-terminal His tag (pCMV6-PGAM-His), or untagged into pCMV6. Serine to alanine and serine to aspartic acid mutants were prepared using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). PGAM-B deletion mutants were prepared as pCMV6M-PGAM (amino acids 1–130), pCMV6M-PGAM (amino acids 21–130), pCMV6M-PGAM (amino acids 24–130), and pCMV6M-PGAM (amino acids 131–254). GST-Pak1, pCMV6M Pak1, pCMV6M Pak1 (T423E, L107F), pCMV6M Pak1 (amino acids 1–205), and pCMV6M Pak1 (amino acids 206–545) have been described previously (4Sells M.A. Knaus U.G. Bagrodia S. Ambrose D.M. Bokoch G.M. Chernoff J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 202-210Google Scholar, 15Zenke F.T. King C.C. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32565-32573Google Scholar). Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, HEPES (10 mm), l-glutamine (2 mm), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μm). Cells were transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen). Cells were lysed in Tris-HCl (25 mm, pH 7.5), EDTA (1 mm), MgCl2 (5 mm), EGTA (0.1 mm), NaCl (100 mm), 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μm okadaic acid, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 5 mm NaF. For immunoprecipitations, cell extracts were incubated with primary antibody for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by incubation for 1 h with 15–25 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads. Samples were washed and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). GTPγS labeling of cell lysates was performed according to Ref. 16Mira J.P. Benard V. Groffen J. Sanders L.C. Knaus U.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 185-189Google Scholar. For phosphoamino acid analysis, PGAM-B was separated on 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and detected by autoradiography. The bands were excised, hydrolyzed in 6.0 N HCl acid at 110 °C for 4 h, lyophilized, and analyzed according to Boyle et al. (17Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Google Scholar). Two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping was done after expression of PGAM-B and Pak1 (amino acids 206–545) in 293T cells labeled with [32P]H3PO4 (50 μCi/ml) overnight. PGAM was immunoprecipitated with anti-His antibody, separated on 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose, and detected by autoradiography. Band intensities were quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Tryptic digestion and phosphopeptide mapping were performed as described previously (17Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Google Scholar, 18King C.C. Reilly A.M. Knaus U.G. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 325: 155-166Google Scholar). Full-length wild-type Pak1 fused to GST (GST-Pak1) and His-tagged PGAM-B were expressed and affinity-purified as described previously (18King C.C. Reilly A.M. Knaus U.G. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 325: 155-166Google Scholar). 10 μg of GST-Pak1 or GST were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads in binding buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm MnCl2). 10 μg of His-PGAM-B were added and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by three washes in binding buffer. Samples were boiled in SDS sample buffer and separated on SDS-PAGE gels for immunoblotting. PGAM activity was determined by coupling the formation of 2-phosphoglycerate from 3-phosphoglycerate with the enolase-, pyruvate kinase-, and lactate dehydrogenase-catalyzed reactions. Assays were performed at 37 °C and measured at 340 nm according to Beutler (19Beutler E. Red Cell Metabolism: A Manual of Biochemical Methods. Grune and Stratton, Orlando, FL1984Google Scholar). Cell lysates for enzymatic activity were prepared with lysis buffer. The reaction mixture contained 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm EDTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm NADH, 1.5 mm ADP, 10 μm 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate, lactate dehydrogenase (0.6 unit/ml), pyruvate kinase (0.5 unit/ml), enolase (0.3 unit/ml), and 1 mm 3-phosphoglycerate. Experiments were performed at least three times in triplicates. Protein was determined by using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Preparation of perchloric acid cell extracts and measurement of glucose 6-phosphate were performed according to Ref. 19Beutler E. Red Cell Metabolism: A Manual of Biochemical Methods. Grune and Stratton, Orlando, FL1984Google Scholar in triplicates. Briefly, 108neutrophils in 1 ml were lysed with 500 μl of 8% perchloric acid and centrifuged. 10 μl of 0.05% methyl-orange, a pH indicator, were added to the supernatant, which was then neutralized by slowly adding 3 m K2CO3. Glucose 6-phosphate was assayed at 340 nm. The reaction mixture contained 100 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm NADP, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (0.33 unit/ml). Serial dilutions of glucose 6-phosphate were used as standard. Protein was determined by using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). 3 × 105neutrophils were incubated in 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 118 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mmKH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 5.5 mm glucose, and 1.0 mm CaCl2(KRHG) at 37 °C with 71 μm luminol and 50 μg/ml horseradish peroxidase and stimulated with fMLF at 1 μmfinal concentration. Chemiluminescence was recorded every 20 s for 15 min. Experiments were performed at least three times in triplicates using a Wallac Berthhold plate luminometer. The data accumulated thus far implicate Pak in several signaling events that mediate phagocyte functions. To gain further insight into additional functional roles of Paks in innate immune cells, the identification of novel Pak target proteins and their contribution to microbicidal activity was initiated. Cytosol from unstimulated human neutrophils was fractionated by sequential column chromatography, assessing putative target proteins in each fraction by in vitro kinase reaction with and without the addition of recombinant GST-Pak1. Fusion to GST renders Pak1 constitutively active by releasing the carboxyl-terminal kinase domain from the inhibitory effect exerted by the intramolecular folding of the amino-terminal regulatory domain (15Zenke F.T. King C.C. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32565-32573Google Scholar). Two proteins served as major phosphorylation substrates of the recombinant kinase during fractionation: p47phox, the cytosolic NADPH oxidase component previously identified as a Pak1 target; and an unidentified protein of relative molecular weight 30,000. This p30 protein was further resolved by heptylamine-Sepharose chromatography to become the sole Pak1 phosphorylation target in the unbound column fraction (Fig.1, A and B,C7 fraction). No phosphorylation of p30 was detected without addition of active Pak. After SDS-PAGE, Coomassie Blue staining, and tryptic digest of p30, 12 peptide fragments were identified by mass spectroscopy. All of them corresponded to the ubiquitously expressed brain isoform of phosphoglycerate mutase (PGAM-B), together covering 61% of the total protein sequence. The identity of p30 as PGAM-B was confirmed using a brain isoform-specific antibody (20Uchida K. Kondoh K. Matuo Y. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1995; 237: 43-58Google Scholar), which detected a single band in neutrophil cytosol and in the highly purified C7 fraction (Fig. 1 C). The full-length coding sequence of PGAM-B was cloned into expression vectors to prepare recombinant PGAM-B. Comparison with endogenous PGAM revealed that carboxyl-terminal epitope tagging of PGAM did not alter Pak-induced phosphorylation, dimerization, or enzymatic activity. Recombinant PGAM-B was efficiently phosphorylated by kinase active Pak1 (Fig. 1 D). Similar results were obtained with purified PGAM-M, the predominant form of PGAM in muscle (data not shown). These results identify PGAM, an enzyme in the glycolytic pathway, as a novel effector of Pak1. Phosphoamino acid analysis of either endogenous neutrophil or recombinant PGAM-B phosphorylated by Pak1 revealed that phosphorylation of PGAM is exclusively on serine residues (Fig.2 A). To locate the phosphorylated serine residue(s), we used a combined approach of deletion analysis, proteolytic fragment electrophoresis, mass spectrometry, and site-specific mutagenesis. Ser23 and Ser118 of PGAM-B were identified as equally potent phosphorylation sites. To confirm these sites, single or double serine to alanine PGAM mutants were prepared, expressed together with the constitutively active Pak kinase domain, and immunoprecipitated from metabolically labeled 293T cells. Mutation of either Ser23 or Ser118 to alanine (PGAM-BA23, PGAM-BA118) resulted in a 50% decrease in Pak1-induced phosphorylation, whereas PGAM-BA23, A118 showed no incorporation of phosphate (Fig. 2 B). Comparative phosphopeptide mapping of in vivo-labeled wild-type and S→A mutant PGAM confirmed Ser23 and Ser118 as Pak phosphorylation sites. Two distinct spots corresponding to phosphorylated tryptic fragments were observed with wild-type PGAM, which were selectively lost, singly or conjointly, upon mutation of the respective serine residue (Fig. 2 C). The proximity of the amino-terminal catalytic domain of the mutase (His11) to Ser23 did not influence the extent of Pak phosphorylation of this residue because polypeptide fragments spanning either residues 1–130 or 21–130 of PGAM-BA118were equally phosphorylated (data not shown). A bona fide phosphorylation substrate often physically interacts with the respective protein kinase. Immunoprecipitation of Pak1 or PGAM-B, both expressed in 293T cells, revealed that PGAM-B co-precipitated with Pak1. The interaction was strongly enhanced when either a full-length constitutively active PAK1 mutant, Pak1F107, E423 (Fig. 3 A), or the carboxyl-terminal catalytic domain of PAK1 (206–545) was used (Fig.3 B). This demonstrates that only the active form of Pak kinase interacts with PGAM-B and that amino-terminal regulatory elements of Pak including the GTPase-binding domain or proline-rich motifs are not necessary for Pak-PGAM-B association. The complex formation between Pak1 and PGAM-B was entirely dependent on Pak activation because only GTPγS-treated lysates of cells expressing wild-type Pak and PGAM-B showed Pak-PGAM-B interaction (Fig.3 C). In vitro GTPγS loading of whole cell lysates renders Rac and Cdc42 GTPases constitutively active, thereby enabling continuous activation of the effector kinase Pak. We used affinity-purified PGAM-B and active GST-Pak1 bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads to demonstrate direct complex formation between Pak1 and PGAM-B (Fig. 3 D). PGAM activity can be assessed by coupling the last three steps of glycolysis to measure the oxidation of NADH to NAD (19Beutler E. Red Cell Metabolism: A Manual of Biochemical Methods. Grune and Stratton, Orlando, FL1984Google Scholar). To determine the consequences of Pak-mediated PGAM-B phosphorylation on leukocyte function, we evaluated the impact of Pak activation on PGAM-B activity. Neutrophils were stimulated with the chemotactic peptide fMLF, which activates Pak through a heterotrimeric G protein signaling cascade (8Knaus U.G. Morris S. Dong H.J. Chernoff J. Bokoch G.M. Science. 1995; 269: 221-223Google Scholar). Under conditions in which fMLF stimulates superoxide generation and Pak activation, the enzymatic activity of endogenous PGAM-B was transiently inhibited, with an initial 30% decrease after 30 s and a maximal inhibition of up to 60% within 15–20 min after fMLF administration (Fig. 4 A). The immediate and early onset of PGAM inhibition correlates with Pak activation (8Knaus U.G. Morris S. Dong H.J. Chernoff J. Bokoch G.M. Science. 1995; 269: 221-223Google Scholar, 9Huang R. Lian J.P. Robinson D. Badwey J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7130-7138Google Scholar), whereas PGAM dephosphorylation and reactivation are much slower and most likely dependent on an unidentified phosphatase. The direct involvement of Pak in this inhibitory response was assessed by analyzing the effect of increasing amounts of active Pak on the enzymatic activity of either endogenous or transfected PGAM-B in 293T cells. We found a direct dose-response relationship between the amount of activated Pak and the extent of PGAM-B inhibition, which reached 60% at the highest Pak levels (Fig. 4 B). Subsequently, a PGAM-B double mutant mimicking serine phosphorylation, PGAM-BD23, D118 was prepared and tested for enzymatic activity. Mutation of serines to aspartic acids led to complete loss of PGAM-B activity, whereas the counterpart PGAM-BA23, A118, which represents phosphorylation-deficient PGAM-B, retained high enzymatic activity (Fig. 4 C). The enzymatic activity of the PGAM-BA23, A118 mutant was not inhibited by active Pak1, confirming that inhibition of PGAM activity indeed relies on the ability of Pak to phosphorylate PGAM-B on those residues. Single and double mutations of serine 23 and/or 118 to aspartic acid in PGAM showed that serine 23 is the predominant inhibitory phosphorylation site with respect to the enzymatic activity of PGAM (Fig.4 D). PGAM mutations did not affect the association of PGAM-B with the carboxyl-terminal, kinase active Pak1 fragment or its propensity to homodimerize, as determined by native gel electrophoresis (data not shown). These observations rule out the possibility that the loss of enzymatic activity was due to nonspecific conformational effects or the inability of mutant PGAM-B to associate with Pak. Respiratory burst onset is associated with a sudden and transient increase in the activity of the PPP. Therefore, phosphorylation of PGAM-B by Pak could be part of a glycolysis “shut-off” mechanism, serving to divert energy production to the pentose phosphate pathway. Such a scenario may increase the conversion of glucose via G6P into NADPH, the obligatory energy source for the oxidative burst in phagocytes. The levels of glycolytic intermediates after fMLF stimulation of neutrophils were measured. Indeed, whereas the concentrations of lactic acid and pyruvic acid were reduced as expected if glycolysis is inhibited (data not shown), glucose 6-phosphate accumulated rapidly. Moreover, specific competitive inhibition of PGAM-B activity by the substrate analog PGA (21Sasaki R. Hirose M. Sugimoto E. Chiba H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 227: 595-607Google Scholar) further increased both basal and fMLF-induced levels of G6P in intact neutrophils (Fig.5 A). G6P is the substrate of the first and rate-limiting enzyme (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) in the pentose phosphate pathway. When glycolysis is inhibited at the PGAM-B level, G6P accumulates in the cell. G6P will then be catabolized more readily via the pentose phosphate pathway, increasing the cellular supply of NADPH and thus facilitating the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by NADPH oxidase, a requirement for the microbicidal activity of phagocytes. This concept was tested by analyzing chemoattractant-stimulated ROS production by neutrophils after preincubation with the PGAM inhibitor PGA. PGAM inhibition increased the maximal peak of fMLF-stimulated superoxide generation of human neutrophils by 70–100% (Fig.5 B), coinciding with the rapid rise in G6P concentration that is dynamically catabolized at the first critical minute. These observations strongly imply that Pak-induced PGAM-B phosphorylation generates the metabolic environment required for an efficient oxidative burst by transiently diverting the energy production from the glycolytic to the pentose phosphate pathway. Phagocytic cells are critical components of the innate immune response, serving as a first line of defense against pathogens. Upon challenge, leukocytes migrate to the site of infection and engulf the microorganism into the phagolysosome. Consecutive destruction of internalized bacteria is accomplished by release of degrading proteases and reactive oxygen metabolites. The activation of the Rac effector protein kinase Pak is dependent on chemoattractant receptor signaling and integrin ligation, both early events in stimulated phagocytes. Pak has been implicated in NADPH oxidase activation through phosphorylation of the NADPH oxidase component p47phox on several carboxyl-terminal amino acid residues. This phosphorylation is necessary for ROS generation in cell-free assay systems and in ROS-producing model cell lines (22Ago T. Nunoi H. Ito T. Sumimoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33644-33653Google Scholar, 23Inanami O. Johnson J.L. McAdara J.K. Benna J.E. Faust L.R. Newburger P.E. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9539-9543Google Scholar). Our data now show that active Pak kinase fulfills at least one additional essential role for respiratory burst activity—the inhibition of PGAM activity—and the subsequent transient rise of PPP-generated NADPH, an absolute requirement for NADPH oxidase activity. The Pak-mediated phosphorylation of PGAM occurs on two serine residues in the amino-terminal part of the enzyme. The critical importance of the phosphorylation state of both PGAM-B serine residues is evident from structural information obtained from Saccharomyces cerevisiae PGAM. S. cerevisiae PGAM has 64% amino acid homology to mammalian PGAM-B, with close to 100% identity at the catalytically active sites. The high-resolution crystal structure shows that the entrance to the catalytic cleft site is surrounded by Lys97, Arg113, and Arg114 in S. cerevisiae PGAM (Lys100, Arg116, and Arg117 in human PGAM-B) (24Rigden D.J. Alexeev D. Phillips S.E. Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 449-459Google Scholar). The positive electrostatic potential of these basic residues is thought to be necessary to enable binding of highly negatively charged substrates. Pak-induced phosphorylation of the neighboring Ser118, which is highly conserved in yeast and mammalian M- and B-type PGAM, will change accessibility and electrostatic potential at the cleft. The second Pak phosphorylation site on PGAM, Ser23, is located next to the conserved Gly24 (in human PGAM), which is implicated in substrate binding and substrate specificity. Several amino-terminal PGAM deletion mutants were prepared to confirm Ser23 as a Pak phosphorylation site and to ensure the structural integrity of Ser23 mutants because this residue is located close to the catalytically active His11. Alanine substitutions did not abolish PGAM activity, and both alanine and aspartic acid mutants resembled wild-type PGAM-B in their dimer formation. This is in agreement with conclusions drawn from the binding interfaces of theS. cerevisiae PGAM tetramer, which predict that mainly Pro168 and residues at the carboxyl terminus influence multimer formation (25White M.F. Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. Kelly S.M. Price N.C. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 743-748Google Scholar). Most glycolytic enzymes, including PGAM, exist in complexes bound to the microtubule network (26Merkulova T. Lucas M. Jabet C. Lamande N. Rouzeau J.D. Gros F. Lazar M. Keller A. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 791-800Google Scholar, 27Volker K.W. Reinitz C.A. Knull H.R. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 112: 503-514Google Scholar). The GTPases Rac and Cdc42 regulate not only F-actin reorganization but also microtubule dynamics through Pak, which phosphorylates and thereby inhibits the microtubule-destabilizing protein stathmin, leading to microtubule stabilization (28Daub H. Gevaert K. Vandekerckhove J. Sobel A. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1677-1680Google Scholar). Elongation, assembly, and bundling of microtubules are rapid initial changes during chemoattractant stimulation and phagocytosis and might be connected to oxidant production (29Burchill B.R. Oliver J.M. Pearson C.B. Leinbach E.D. Berlin R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1978; 76: 439-447Google Scholar). It is therefore conceivable that microtubules or other cytoskeletal structures serve as a scaffold to connect chemoattractant signaling to metabolic pathways and facilitate the interaction of active Pak and PGAM. Pak-mediated PGAM phosphorylation may act in concert with the phosphorylation of other Pak targets, such as myosin light chain kinase or p47phox of the NADPH oxidase, to cause structural and biochemical changes required for microbicidal activity. Whereas the specific PGAM inhibitor used in this study led to a highly increased rate of ROS generation, and inhibition of Pak activity decreases the oxidative burst up to 60–70%, 2U. G. Knaus, manuscript in preparation. binding and phosphorylation studies as shown in epithelial cells were not possible in chemoattractant-stimulated neutrophils. Three different anti-PGAM antibodies failed to immunoprecipitate PGAM from human neutrophils. The development of Pak-deficient mice and of specific pharmacological inhibitors of glycolytic enzymes upstream of PGAM will aid to establish the molecular mechanisms of Pak-regulated ROS production. It is important to note that phagocytic cells are not the only mammalian cells relying on NADPH derived from the PPP. The reduction of glutathione by erythrocytes, as well as fatty acid and steroid biosynthesis, utilizes large amounts of NADPH. The potential involvement of Pak as an early signaling mediator in these processes could present the regulation for metabolic changes that accommodate immediate cellular needs. We thank M. Kinter (W.

https://openalex.org/W2152970585,"The ability of wild type and mutant T4 DNA polymerases to discriminate in the utilization of the base analog 2-aminopurine (2AP) and the fluorescence of 2AP were used to determine how DNA polymerases distinguish between correct and incorrect nucleotides. Because T4 DNA polymerase incorporates dTMP opposite 2AP under single-turnover conditions, it was possible to compare directly the kinetic parameters for incorporation of dTMP opposite template 2AP to the parameters for incorporation of dTMP opposite template A without the complication of enzyme dissociation. The most significant difference detected was in the K d for dTTP, which was 10-fold higher for incorporation of dTMP opposite template 2AP (∼367 μm) than for incorporation of dTMP opposite template A (∼31 μm). In contrast, the dTMP incorporation rate was reduced only about 2-fold from about 318 s−1 with template A to about 165 s−1 for template 2AP. Discrimination is due to the high selectivity in the initial nucleotide-binding step. T4 DNA polymerase binding to DNA with 2AP in the template position induces formation of a nucleotide binding pocket that is preshaped to bind dTTP and to exclude other nucleotides. If nucleotide binding is hindered, initiation of the proofreading pathway acts as an error avoidance mechanism to prevent incorporation of incorrect nucleotides.

If nucleotide binding is hindered, initiation of the proofreading pathway acts as an error avoidance mechanism to prevent incorporation of incorrect nucleotides. High fidelity DNA polymerases are responsible for replicating the genomic DNA of most organisms. Replication fidelity is achieved by accurate nucleotide incorporation, which has an error frequency of about 1 × 10−5 (1Loeb L.A. Kunkel T.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1982; 52: 429-457Google Scholar), and by exonucleolytic proofreading, which preferentially removes incorrectversus correct nucleotides from the primer terminus (2Muzyczka N. Poland R.L. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 7116-7122Google Scholar, 3Brutlag D. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 241-248Google Scholar) and improves fidelity another 100-fold or more. Many organisms also have additional mismatch correction pathways that further improve fidelity another 100-fold. However, the largest single contributor to accurate DNA replication is the ability of the DNA polymerase to insert the correct nucleotide with high precision. How do DNA polymerases discriminate between correct and incorrect nucleotides? Although hydrogen bonding appears to be an obvious mechanism for determining base pair specificity, this mechanism alone is not adequate. In the presence of water, free energy differences in hydrogen bonding between complementary and noncomplementary bases are not sufficient to produce the observed low nucleotide error frequency of 1 × 10−5 (4Petruska J. Goodman M.F. Boosalis M.S. Sower L.C. Cheng C. Tinoco I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6252-6256Google Scholar). Instead, results from numerous studies are consistent with the proposal that DNA polymerases discriminate between inserting correct or incorrect nucleotides based on the geometry of the base pair. For example, the Klenow fragment ofEscherichia coli DNA polymerase I was shown to incorporate an isosteric analog of thymidylate with accuracy, even though the base analog could not form any hydrogen bonds with the template base (5Moran S. Ren R.X.-F. Kool E.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10506-10511Google Scholar). Structural studies of nucleotide pre-incorporation complexes formed with several DNA polymerases suggest that DNA polymerases may assess the geometry of the newly forming base pair by “closing down” on the primer-terminal region to make several tight contacts that are in position to distinguish between correct and incorrect base pairs (6Pelletier H. Sawaya M.R. Kumar A. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Science. 1994; 264: 1891-1903Google Scholar, 7Kiefer J.R. Mao C. Braman J.C. Beese L.S. Nature. 1998; 391: 304-307Google Scholar, 8Doublié S. Tabor S.

The structural studies are consistent with kinetic studies in which an induced-fit mechanism is proposed to determine nucleotide selectivity (10Sloan D.L. Goodman M.F. Echols H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 6465-6475Google Scholar, 11Kuchta R.D. Mizrahi V. Benkovic P.A. Johnson K.A. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8410-8417Google Scholar, 12Kuchta R.D. Benkovic P.

Despite the above reports, it is still not clear how DNA polymerases distinguish between correct and incorrect nucleotides, because the high fidelity of most DNA polymerases dictates that it is difficult to “capture” a DNA polymerase in the act of inserting an incorrect nucleotide, even in reactions in which only the incorrect nucleotide is supplied. If the DNA polymerase dissociates (k off) from the DNA substrate faster than an incorrect nucleotide is incorporated, then the apparent nucleotide misincorporation rate may be more reflective of multiple cycles of enzyme association and dissociation rather than nucleotide misincorporation (see discussion by Wong et al. (13Wong I. Patel S.S. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 526-537Google Scholar)). There are at least three potential steps in which the DNA polymerase can assert specificity for the correct base pair (reviewed in Ref. 14Goodman M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10493-10495Google Scholar): initial dNTP binding, post-binding selection by an induced-fit mechanism, and the chemical step of phosphodiester bond formation (see Fig. 1, Steps 2–4). Different DNA polymerases have been proposed to derive specificity in nucleotide incorporation from one or more of these steps (for examples see Refs. 10Sloan D.L. Goodman M.F. Echols H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 6465-6475Google Scholar, 11Kuchta R.D. Mizrahi V. Benkovic P.A. Johnson K.A. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8410-8417Google Scholar, 12Kuchta R.D. Benkovic P.

Chem. 2002; 277: 8235-8242Google Scholar) or from the sequential application of each step (18Echols H. Goodman M.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 477-511Google Scholar). We report here that the technical problems in measuring incorporation of an incorrect nucleotide have been overcome for the bacteriophage T4 DNA polymerase by using the base analog 2-aminopurine (2AP). 1The abbreviations used are: 2AP, 2-aminopurine; E pol·D, enzyme·DNA complex with the primer terminus bound in the polymerase active center; E pol·D·dTTP·Mg2+ complex, nucleotide pre-incorporation complex; DTT, dithiothreitol; HMdCTP, hydroxymethylcytosine deoxynucleoside triphosphate. 1The abbreviations used are: 2AP, 2-aminopurine; E pol·D, enzyme·DNA complex with the primer terminus bound in the polymerase active center; E pol·D·dTTP·Mg2+ complex, nucleotide pre-incorporation complex; DTT, dithiothreitol; HMdCTP, hydroxymethylcytosine deoxynucleoside triphosphate. Whereas in some studies the 2AP-T base pair has been viewed as a correct base pair, the T4 DNA polymerase discriminates in the utilization of 2AP (19Reha-Krantz L.J. Bessman M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 145: 677-695Google Scholar, 20Pless R.C. Bessman M.J. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 4905-4915Google Scholar, 21Bloom L.B. Otto M.R. Eritja R. Reha-Krantz L.J. Goodman M.F. Beechem J.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7576-7586Google Scholar). The degree of discrimination, however, is much less for forming the 2AP-T base pair than for forming A-C, G-T, or other mismatched base pairs (22Goodman M.R. Creighton S. Bloom L.B. Petruska J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 83-126Google Scholar), which means that 2AP located in the template position is predicted to slow rather than to block dTMP incorporation. Thus, mechanisms of nucleotide discrimination will be revealed by comparing which step or steps in the nucleotide incorporation pathway are slowed for the incorporation of dTMP opposite template 2AP compared with template A. 2AP also provides a fluorescent reporter of the nucleotide incorporation reaction catalyzed by the T4 DNA polymerase. Although the 2AP free base, nucleoside, and nucleotide are fluorescent, 2AP fluorescence in DNA is quenched due to intrastrand base-stacking interactions (23Ward D.C. Reich E. Stryer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 1228-1237Google Scholar, 24Rachofsky E.L. Osman R. Ross J.A.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 946-956Google Scholar). Thus, changes in the fluorescence intensity of 2AP in DNA can be used to detect protein interactions that perturb 2AP base stacking. Up to a 25-fold increase in fluorescence intensity is produced when the T4 DNA polymerase binds a DNA substrate labeled with 2AP in the template strand in position to bind the next incoming dNTP (the n+1 position) (25Mandal S.S. Fidalgo da Silva E. Reha-Krantz L.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4399-4406Google Scholar, 26Frey M.W. Sowers L.C. Millar D.P. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9185-9192Google Scholar). Base unstacking in the template strand produced by T4 DNA polymerase binding DNA in the polymerase active center is illustrated below in Fig. 1, Step 1. The fluorescence of the enzyme·DNA complex (E pol·D) is quenched when dTTP·Mg2+ is bound to form the nascent 2AP-T base pair (see Fig. 1, Step 2). The decrease in fluorescence intensity is not observed in the absence of Mg2+ (25Mandal S.S. Fidalgo da Silva E. Reha-Krantz L.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4399-4406Google Scholar), which indicates the E pol·D·dTTP·Mg2+complex is a complex poised for nucleotide incorporation. The kinetic parameters for dTTP binding and dTMP incorporation opposite template A and template 2AP were determined for the exonuclease-deficient T4 DNA polymerase by measuring the amount of fluorescence quench as a function of dTTP concentration under single-turnover conditions. Reactions were also done with dCTP, but single-turnover conditions could not be established since dissociation of the enzyme·DNA complex was faster than dCMP incorporation. Kinetic parameters for nucleotide incorporation by mutant T4 DNA polymerases with the L412M and I417V amino acid substitutions in the highly conserved Motif A sequence in the polymerase active center were also determined. The L412M substitution decreased fidelity while increasing the stability of the primer terminus in the polymerase active center; the I417V substitution had the opposite effect. The increased stability of the primer terminus in the polymerase active center of the L412M-DNA polymerase was correlated with decreased proofreading, which indicates that a single amino acid substitution can decrease the fidelity of nucleotide incorporation anddecrease proofreading. Because the T4 DNA polymerase is a member of a large family of protein sequence-related DNA polymerases, including eukaryotic DNA polymerases δ and ε, studies reported here likely have broad implications in understanding the accuracy of DNA replication in many organisms. Purification and characterization of the exonuclease-deficient D112A/E114A T4 DNA polymerase (27Reha-Krantz L.J. Nonay R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27100-27108Google Scholar) and the proofreading-defective, but exonuclease-proficient G255S-DNA polymerase (28Marquez L.A. Reha-Krantz L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28903-28911Google Scholar) have been described. T4 DNA polymerase mutants with single amino acid substitutions in the conserved Motif A sequence, L412M and I417V, have also been described (29Reha-Krantz L.J. Nonay R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5635-5643Google Scholar). The exonuclease-deficient forms of the Motif A mutants were constructed by standard in vitromutagenesis procedures, and the mutant DNA polymerases were purified by standard methods (30Reha-Krantz L.J. Nonay R.L Stocki S. J. Virology. 1993; 67: 60-66Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides (see Table I) were synthesized using solid-state chemistry as described previously (31Baker R.P. Reha-Krantz L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3507-3512Google Scholar). The 3′ terminus of the template strand was protected from DNA polymerase binding and exonuclease digestion by a biotin attachment (BiotinTEG-CPG, Glen Research). The biotin modification at the 3′-end of the template strand ensured that DNA polymerase-DNA interactions were directed to the primer terminus as determined by enzyme titration. All DNAs were purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The primer and template DNAs were annealed in buffer containing 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.6) and 50 mm NaCl with a 20% excess of primer strand to ensure complete hybridization of the template strand. Dideoxy-chain-terminated DNA substrates were synthesized in DNA polymerase reactions with ddATP.Table IDNA substrates labeled at the n+1 or n+2 position with 2APDNA substrateSequencen+1Template3′ B-CCCTTCGTGCAGTAGCCATTAAPGATCGATGGTTTPrimer5′ GGGAAGCACGTCATCGGTAATTn+2 (incorporation of dTMP)Template3′ B-CCCTTCGTGCAGTAGCCATTAAPGATCGATGGTTTPrimer5′ GGGAAGCACGTCATCGGTAATn+2 (incorporation of dAMP)Template3′ B-CCCTTCGTGCAGTAGCCATTAATPGATCGATGGTTTPrimer5′ GGGAAGCACGTCATCGGTAATTn+1 (dd)Template3′ B-CCCTTCGTGCAGTAGCCATTAATPGATCGATGGTTTPrimer5′ GGGAAGCACGTCATCGGTAATTAddn+1 (3′d)Template3′ B-CCCTTCGTGCAGTAGCCATTAATPGATCGATGGTTTPrimer5′ GGGAAGCACGTCATCGGTAATTA3′ dThe base analog 2-aminopurine (2AP) is depicted as a bold Pin the sequences.

Emission data for 2AP·DNAs and polymerase·DNA complexes were obtained with a Photon Technology International scanning spectrofluorometer. Samples were excited at 310 nm, and fluorescence emission data were collected at 368 nm. Solutions contained 200 nm 2AP-labeled DNA, 500 nm T4 DNA polymerase, 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm EDTA. Intrinsic protein fluorescence was subtracted. Stopped-flow experiments were performed with theApplied Photophysics SX.18 MV spectrofluorometer. Excitation was at 310 nm; a 335-nm cut-off filter was used. The temperature in the sample-handling unit was maintained at 20.0 ± 0.5 °C. Primer extension reactions were initiated by mixing equal volumes of a solution of T4 DNA polymerase, DNA, and EDTA in buffer (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mmDTT) with a second solution containing Mg2+ and dNTP in the same buffer. The concentrations of reaction components after mixing were 500 nm T4 DNA polymerase, 200 nm2AP-labeled DNA, 1 mm DTT, 8 mmMgCl2, 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 0.5 mmEDTA, 50 mm NaCl, and variable concentrations of dTTP or dCTP. In reactions in which 2AP was in the template (n+1) position, nucleotide incorporation rates were determined by measuring the rate of decrease in fluorescence intensity due to incorporation of dTMP or dCMP. Nucleotide incorporation rates were also determined in reactions in which 2AP was not a base-pairing partner with DNA substrates labeled at the n+2 position with 2AP. In these reactions, primer extension produced an increase in fluorescence intensity as the primer was elongated to place 2AP in the n+1 position (25Mandal S.S. Fidalgo da Silva E. Reha-Krantz L.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4399-4406Google Scholar). Curves were fit to single- or double-exponential equations using the kinetic software package supplied by Applied Photophysics. Eight or more determinations were performed for each experiment, and the mean values were calculated. To verify that single-turnover conditions were established for reactions in which dTMP was incorporated opposite template 2AP, heparin was used to trap the T4 DNA polymerase (32Reddy M.K. Weitzel S.E. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14157-14166Google Scholar, 33Reha-Krantz L.J. Marquez L.A. Elisseeva E. Baker R.P. Bloom L.B. Dunford H.B. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22969-22976Google Scholar). Primer extension reactions were initiated by mixing equal volumes of a solution of T4 DNA polymerase, DNA, and EDTA in buffer (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT) with a second solution containing buffer, dTTP, Mg2+, and heparin. After mixing, the final concentrations of reactants were 500 nmT4 DNA polymerase, 200 nm 2AP-labeled DNA, 1 mmDTT, 8 mm MgCl2, 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 0.5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 10 μg/ml heparin (Sigma, 3000 average molecular weight from porcine intestinal mucosa) and variable concentrations of dTTP. The amount of heparin needed to give optimal trapping was determined by mixing different amounts of heparin with fluorescent enzyme·DNA complexes formed with the n+1 DNA substrate. Fluorescence intensity decreases when the DNA polymerase dissociates from the DNA and then binds heparin. The optimal concentration of heparin was the lowest concentration in which the maximum decrease in fluorescence intensity due to DNA polymerase dissociation was still observed. Mutation rates in the absence or presence of 2AP were determined by measuring the number of revertants at an rII ochre site, rIIUV199oc in a single cycle of T4 infection as described previously (19Reha-Krantz L.J. Bessman M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 145: 677-695Google Scholar). We have shown that when T4 DNA polymerase binds to a DNA substrate labeled with 2AP at the n+1 template position (Fig.1, Step 1), up to a 25-fold increase in fluorescence intensity is produced due to enzyme-induced base unstacking at the n+1 position (25Mandal S.S. Fidalgo da Silva E. Reha-Krantz L.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4399-4406Google Scholar). In contrast, T4 DNA polymerase binding to DNA templates labeled with 2AP at the more distal n+2 position (Table I) produces only a small, less than 4-fold increase in fluorescence intensity (25Mandal S.S. Fidalgo da Silva E. Reha-Krantz L.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4399-4406Google Scholar). Thus, nucleotide incorporation by the T4 DNA polymerase can be observed as an increase in fluorescence intensity when the primer is extended by one nucleotide to move 2AP initially in the n+2 position to the n+1 position and as a decrease in fluorescence when the primer is elongated further and a nucleotide is incorporated opposite template 2AP (25Mandal S.S. Fidalgo da Silva E. Reha-Krantz L.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4399-4406Google Scholar). The reaction in Fig. 2 shows the sequential incorporation of first dTMP opposite template A (increase in fluorescence intensity) followed by the incorporation of a second dTMP opposite template 2AP (decrease in fluorescence intensity). It is clear, from the faster increase in fluorescence intensity for incorporation of dTMP opposite template A compared with the slower decrease for incorporation of dTMP opposite template 2AP, that 2AP slows nucleotide incorporation. This pattern of nucleotide incorporation was also observed for another n+2 DNA substrate (Table I) in which dAMP was first incorporated relatively rapidly opposite template T and a slower rate was observed for the incorporation of dTMP opposite template 2AP (data not shown). The slower rate for nucleotide incorporation when 2AP is a base-pairing partner was expected, because the T4 DNA polymerase discriminates in the utilization of the base analog (19Reha-Krantz L.J. Bessman M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 145: 677-695Google Scholar, 20Pless R.C. Bessman M.J. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 4905-4915Google Scholar, 21Bloom L.B. Otto M.R. Eritja R. Reha-Krantz L.J. Goodman M.F.

The goal of the following experiments was to determine which step or steps in the nucleotide incorporation pathway catalyzed by the T4 DNA polymerase (Fig. 1) are responsible for slowing the incorporation of dTMP opposite template 2AP. These experiments were performed with the exonuclease-deficient D112A/E114A-DNA polymerase to prevent exonucleolytic degradation of the DNA substrates. DNA polymerase binding to the 3′-end of the template strand was also blocked by a biotin attachment (Table I), which maximized DNA polymerase binding to the primer terminus as determined by enzyme titration. A 2-fold higher concentration of DNA polymerase was required to achieve maximal DNA polymerase binding as determined by fluorescence measurements in the absence of the biotin attachment. Incorporation of dTMP opposite template A was determined with DNA labeled initially at the n+2 template position with 2AP (Table I). The rate of increase in fluorescence intensity produced by primer elongation was measured as a function of dTTP concentration. A solution of preformed enzyme·DNA complexes (1 μm DNA polymerase + 400 nm n+2 DNA) in buffer with 0.5 mm EDTA was mixed in the stopped-flow apparatus with a second solution containing Mg2+ and different concentrations of dTTP. After mixing, the concentrations of reactants were 200 nm n+2 DNA substrate (Table I), 500 nm exonuclease-deficient D112A/E114A-DNA polymerase, 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 8 mmMg2+, and dTTP from 5 to 200 μm. The apparent nucleotide incorporation rates (k obs) were plotted against dTTP concentration (Fig.3). The data were fit to the equation,k obs = k pol[dTTP]/(K d + [dTTP]). The K dfor dTTP with template A ( K ddTTP­A) is 31 ± 4 μm and the k pol is 318 ± 13 s−1. These values are similar to the kinetic parameters determined for the incorporation of dAMP opposite template T also measured by the fluorescence assay, but with another n+2 DNA substrate (Table I): K ddATP­T = 16 ± 3 μm and k pol = 314 ± 18 s−1 (25Mandal S.S. Fidalgo da Silva E. Reha-Krantz L.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4399-4406Google Scholar). Similar kinetic parameters were also obtained for the incorporation of dGMP opposite template C (data not shown). The nucleotide incorporation rates determined by the fluorescence assay, about 314–318 s−1, are slower than the rate of 400 s−1 observed for incorporation of dAMP opposite template T by a radioactive-based, rapid quench assay (34Capson T.L. Peliska J.A. Kaboord B.F. Frey M.W. Lively C. Dahlberg M. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10984-10994Google Scholar). However, nucleotide incorporation reactions were done at pH 8.8 in the rapid quench experiments, but at pH 7.6 for the fluorescence assays. Because higher pH stimulates nucleotide incorporation by the T4 DNA polymerase (35Lo K.-Y. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 2475-2479Google Scholar), the higher apparent nucleotide incorporation rates measured in the rapid quench experiments may reflect differences in the pH of the reaction. The K d for dTTP binding opposite template 2AP was first determined with nonextendable primers to study nucleotide binding in the absence of incorporation. Because Mg2+ is required to detect dTTP binding opposite template 2AP (25Mandal S.S. Fidalgo da Silva E. Reha-Krantz L.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4399-4406Google Scholar), nucleotide incorporation would normally take place unless prevented. A solution of preformed fluorescent enzyme·DNA complexes was made with 200 nm of the ddAMP-terminated n+1 DNA substrate (Table I), 500 nmexonuclease-deficient D112A/E114A-DNA polymerase, 25 mmHEPES (pH 7.6), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and 8 mm Mg2+ and titrated with increasing concentrations of dTTP. The decrease in fluorescence intensity (% Quench) of theE pol·D·dTTP·Mg2+ complexes as a function of dTTP concentration is plotted in Fig.4. The K d for dTTP binding opposite template 2AP with the dideoxy-terminated primer [ Kd (dideoxy­terminated)dTTP­2AP] was determined to be 34 ± 3 μm by fitting the data to the hyperbolic equation, q = [Q][dTTP]/(K d +[dTTP]), whereq is the observed fluorescence quench at various dTTP concentrations and Q is the maximum quench observed at saturating dTTP. Surprisingly, the K d for dTTP binding opposite template 2AP with the dideoxy-terminated primer (∼34 μm) is indistinguishable from the K ddetermined for dTTP in reactions in which dTMP was incorporated opposite template A ( K ddTTP­A ∼ 31 μm) (Fig. 3). This result was unexpected because the T4 DNA polymerase discriminates in the utilization of 2AP (19Reha-Krantz L.J. Bessman M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 145: 677-695Google Scholar, 20Pless R.C. Bessman M.J. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 4905-4915Google Scholar, 21Bloom L.B. Otto M.R. Eritja R. Reha-Krantz L.J. Goodman M.F. Beechem J.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7576-7586Google Scholar). However, there is the possibility that the dideoxy-terminated DNA substrate decreases the ability of the T4 DNA polymerase to discriminate against T-2AP base pairs. This hypothesis is tested by experiments presented in a later section. Experiments were also performed with the 3′-deoxyribonucleotide chain-terminator (Table I). This primer terminus has a hydroxyl group at the 2′ position on the ribose, as in ribonucleotides, but there is no hydroxyl group at the 3′ position. T4 DNA polymerase binding to this substrate also produced an increase in fluorescence intensity equivalent to the fluorescence levels observed for the 2′-deoxyribonucleotide and 2′,3′-dideoxyribonucleotide terminated substrates; however, no decrease in fluorescence intensity was observed by the addition of dTTP·Mg2+ (data not shown). Thus, the presence of the hydroxyl group at the 2′ position appears to prevent dTTP·Mg2+ binding or to prevent binding in a way that restores 2AP base-stacking interactions. Binding of the correct nucleotide by the E pol·D complex is assumed to be very rapid, at the diffusion limit (11Kuchta R.D. Mizrahi V. Benkovic P.A. Johnson K.A. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8410-8417Google Scholar, 12Kuchta R.D. Benkovic P. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6716-6725Google Scholar, 13Wong I. Patel S.S. Johnson K.A.

Lively C. Dahlberg M. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10984-10994Google Scholar). Because nucleotide binding can be measured directly by the decrease in fluorescence intensity for 2AP at the base pairing (n+1) position, we attempted to measure dTTP·Mg2+ binding opposite template 2AP in the stopped-flow apparatus. One syringe contained preformed fluorescent n+1 complexes made with 400 nm of the chain-terminated n+1 DNA substrate (Table I), 1 μmexonuclease-deficient D112A/E114A-DNA polymerase, 25 mmHEPES (pH 7.6), 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT. For the first experiment, the second syringe contained buffer (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 50 mmNaCl, 1 mm DTT) and 16 mm Mg2+. Rapid mixing of equal volumes of the two solutions produced the trace for the level of fluorescence for theE pol·D·Mg2+ complexes formed with a final concentration of 200 nm chain-terminated n+1 DNA and 500 nm enzyme (Fig.5, trace 1). When the experiment was repeated with 400 μm dTTP added to the second syringe, to give a final concentration of 200 μmdTTP after mixing, a lower level of fluorescence intensity was immediately observed"

Human meprin-α, an astacin-like zinc metalloprotease expressed in normal colon epithelial cells, is secreted as a zymogen into the intestinal lumen. Here, meprin is activated after propeptide cleavage by trypsin. In contrast, colorectal cancer cells secrete meprin-α in a non-polarized way, leading to accumulation and increased activity of meprin-α in the tumor stroma. We have analyzed the activation mechanism of promeprin-α in colorectal cancer using a co-culture model of the intestinal mucosa composed of colorectal adenocarcinoma cells (Caco-2) cultivated on filter supports and intestinal fibroblasts grown in the companion dish. We provide evidence that meprin-α is activated by plasmin and show that the presence of plasminogen in the basolateral compartment of the co-cultures is sufficient for promeprin-α activation. Analysis of the plasminogen-activating system in the co-cultures revealed that plasminogen activators produced and secreted by fibroblasts converted plasminogen to active plasmin, which in turn generated active meprin-α.

Sci. (Lond.). 1982; 62: 557-560Google Scholar, 5Sterchi E.E. Green J.R. Lentze M.J. J. Pediatr. Gastroenterol. Nutr. 1983; 2: 539-547Google Scholar, 6Beynon R.J. Shannon J.D. Bond J.S. Biochem.

The protease is a multidomain glycoprotein consisting of evolutionarily related α- and β-subunits with subunit masses of 85–110 kDa (8Sterchi E.E. Naim H.Y. Lentze M.J. Hauri H.P. Fransen J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 265: 105-118Google Scholar,9Marchand P. Tang J. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15388-15393Google Scholar). The subunits form disulfide-linked dimers, which can further oligomerize by noncovalent interactions, leading to homo- or hetero-oligomeric proteins (8Sterchi E.E. Naim H.Y. Lentze M.J. Hauri H.P. Fransen J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 265: 105-118Google Scholar, 9Marchand P. Tang J. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15388-15393Google Scholar, 10Ishmael F.T. Norcum M.T. Benkovic S.J. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23207-23211Google Scholar). Meprins are synthesized as type I transmembrane proteins; however, only the β-subunit has been determined to be an integral membrane protein (11Johnson G.D. Hersh L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7682-7688Google Scholar). The α-subunit is processed post-transcriptionally after the C-terminally located I-domain, resulting in detachment of its membrane-spanning anchor (12Marchand P. Tang J. Johnson G.D. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5449-5456Google Scholar). Thus, when expressed individually, meprin-α is secreted from the cells; when both subunits are expressed, meprin-α associates with meprin-β at the cell surface (11Johnson G.D. Hersh L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7682-7688Google Scholar). Despite their similar protein domain structures, meprin-α and meprin-β show a clear difference in substrate specificity (13Bertenshaw G.P. Turk B.E. Hubbard S.J. Matters G.L. Bylander J.E. Crisman J.M. Cantley L.C. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13248-13255Google Scholar). According to a variety of known in vitro substrates, meprins may be implicated in normal and pathologic processes. They degrade proteins of the extracellular matrix (ECM) 1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; u-PA, urokinase-type plasminogen activator; t-PA, tissue-type plasminogen activator; u-PAR, urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor; PAI, plasminogen activator inhibitor; PET, polyethylene terephthalate; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; PABA peptide, N-benzoyl-l-tyrosyl-p-aminobenzoic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; u-PA, urokinase-type plasminogen activator; t-PA, tissue-type plasminogen activator; u-PAR, urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor; PAI, plasminogen activator inhibitor; PET, polyethylene terephthalate; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; PABA peptide, N-benzoyl-l-tyrosyl-p-aminobenzoic acid. such as type IV collagen, fibronectin, laminin, and nidogen (14Kaushal G.P.

Kidney Int. 1998; 53: 1673-1680Google Scholar) and process biologically active peptides, including bradykinin, angiotensins, parathyroid hormone, gastrin, the β-chain of insulin, growth factors, and cytokines (8Sterchi E.E. Naim H.Y. Lentze M.J. Hauri H.P. Fransen J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 265: 105-118Google Scholar, 13Bertenshaw G.P. Turk B.E. Hubbard S.J. Matters G.L. Bylander J.E. Crisman J.M. Cantley L.C.

Like other astacins, human meprin is initially synthesized as an inactive precursor protein that is activated after proteolytic processing of the N-terminal prosequence (17Bode W. Gomis-Rüth F.X. Huber R. Zwilling R. Stöcker W. Nature. 1992; 358: 164-167Google Scholar). In vitro, trypsin cleaves the propeptide of human meprin following an Arg residue (Arg65 in human meprin-α and Arg61 in human meprin-β) (18Grünberg J. Dumermuth E. Eldering J.A. Sterchi E.E. FEBS Lett. 1993; 335: 376-379Google Scholar), and this is most probably the physiologic mechanism of promeprin activation in the intestinal lumen. However, possible other meprin-activating proteases must exist in vivo, especially in meprin-expressing tissues or cells, where trypsin is absent. Because meprin has also been detected in leukocytes of the subepithelial intestinal mucosa and in a variety of cancer cells and tissues (19Matters G.L. Bond J.S. Mol. Carcinog. 1999; 25: 169-178Google Scholar, 20Lottaz D. Maurer C.A. Hahn D. Büchler M.W. Sterchi E.E. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1127-1133Google Scholar), knowledge of these proteases is an important factor to determine the physiologic significance of meprin activity under normal and pathologic conditions. In this study, we demonstrate that plasmin activates promeprin-α. Plasmin is a trypsin-like protease present in the blood and the extracellular fluid as inactive plasminogen. Conversion of plasminogen to active plasmin is catalyzed by the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) or tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA). Although t-PA is generally accepted to be primarily involved in thrombolysis, it is mainly u-PA that generates active plasmin in processes leading to ECM breakdown (21Andreasen P.A. Kjøller L. Christensen L. Duffy M.J. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 72: 1-22Google Scholar). Several proteases, including serine proteases and metalloproteases, are implicated in tumor growth, invasion into surrounding tissues, and metastasis. Plasmin, through the direct degradation of proteins of the basement membrane and the extracellular matrix (22Mackay A.R. Corbitt R.H. Hartzler J.L. Thorgeirsson U.P. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 5997-6001Google Scholar, 23Goldfinger L.E. Stack M.S. Jones J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 255-265Google Scholar, 24Vassalli J.D. Sappino A.P. Belin D. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1067-1072Google Scholar) or the activation of zymogen forms of ECM-degrading metalloproteases such as interstitial procollagenase (matrix metalloproteinase-1) and prostromelysin (matrix metalloproteinase-3) (25He C.S. Wilhelm S.M. Pentland A.P. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Eisen A.Z. Goldberg G.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2632-2636Google Scholar), plays a crucial part in these tissue-remodeling processes. Cell-surface activation of plasminogen is tightly controlled and is mediated through the concerted action of u-PA, the plasminogen activator receptor (u-PAR), and plasminogen activator inhibitors (PAI-1 and PAI-2) (26Andreasen P.A. Egelund R. Petersen H.H. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 25-40Google Scholar). In the small intestine, both meprin-α and meprin-β are localized in the brush-border membranes of epithelial cells. In the colon, only meprin-α is expressed and is secreted apically into the colon lumen (27Lottaz D. Hahn D. Müller S. Müller C. Sterchi E.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 496-504Google Scholar). We have previously shown that, in contrast to normal colonocytes, colorectal adenocarcinoma cells (Caco-2) secrete meprin-α in a non-polarized way to the apical and basolateral media when grown on Transwell filter dishes (20Lottaz D. Maurer C.A. Hahn D. Büchler M.W. Sterchi E.E. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1127-1133Google Scholar). Moreover, we have observed an increased activity of meprin-α in colorectal cancer tissue homogenates and a diffuse cellular localization in colon cancer cells by immunohistochemistry (20Lottaz D. Maurer C.A. Hahn D. Büchler M.W. Sterchi E.E. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1127-1133Google Scholar). Other authors have described an up-regulation of the expression of u-PA in colorectal carcinomas and its correlation with tumor invasion (28Yang J.L. Seetoo D. Wang Y. Ranson M. Berney C.R. Ham J.M. Russell P.J. Crowe P.J. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 89: 431-439Google Scholar, 29Hansen T.P. Fenger C. Kronborg O. Acta Pathol. Microbiol. Immunol. Scand. 1999; 107: 689-694Google Scholar). Using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, u-PA and u-PAR expression was shown to be localized to colon epithelial cells (30Harvey S.R. Sait S.N., Xu, Y. Bailey J.L. Penetrante R.M. Markus G. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 1115-1120Google Scholar), stromal fibroblasts, and endothelial and/or inflammatory cells (for a review, see Ref. 21Andreasen P.A. Kjøller L. Christensen L. Duffy M.J. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 72: 1-22Google Scholar). We therefore speculated that the plasminogen-activating system plays an important role in meprin-α activation in colorectal cancer tissue, in the subepithelial mucosa, or in other meprin-expressing cells and tissues in vivo. To test this hypothesis, we established a co-culture model of the intestinal mucosa by cultivating Caco-2 cells on Transwell filter inserts together with primary intestinal fibroblasts or HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells in the companion dish. We analyzed meprin-α protein expression and secretion in differentiated Caco-2 cells and demonstrate that addition of the proenzyme plasminogen to the basolateral compartment of the co-cultures was sufficient for meprin-α activation. We examined components of the plasminogen-activating system in the co-cultures and propose a model for meprin-α activation in the subepithelial mucosa and colon cancer stroma in vivo. Cell culture media and all supplements were obtained from Invitrogen (Basel, Switzerland). Enzyme inhibitors, bovine fibrinogen, trypsin, and thrombin were purchased from Sigma. Human plasmin, bovine and human plasminogen, pure high molecular mass u-PA, one-chain t-PA, monoclonal antibody against u-PA (no. 3689), and substrates used for plasmin and plasminogen activator assays were from American Diagnostica. All chemicals for gel electrophoresis were obtained from Bio-Rad. Polyclonal antibodies recognizing promeprin-α and both promeprin-α and its mature form were raised in rabbits by immunization with a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein from a 421-amino acid N-terminal sequence (31Dumermuth E. Eldering J.A. Grünberg J. Jiang W. Sterchi E.E. FEBS Lett. 1993; 335: 367-375Google Scholar) and a 118-amino acid fragment of the intervening domain (27Lottaz D. Hahn D. Müller S. Müller C. Sterchi E.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 496-504Google Scholar). Caco-2 cells at passages 40–50 were grown in HEPES-buffered minimal essential medium supplemented with 20% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 4.5 g/liter d-glucose, nonessential amino acids (100 μm each), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine at 37 °C in 95% air and 5% CO2. Cells were seeded at a density of 6 × 105 on culture plate inserts, comprising a membrane with a 4.2-cm2 growth area (polyethylene terephthalate (PET) membranes, 0.4-μm pore size, BD Biosciences; or polycarbonate membranes, Millicell, Millipore AG). Inserts were placed in six-well plates and incubated in 2.5 ml of apical medium and 3 ml of basolateral medium. The media were changed daily. Establishment of tight monolayers was followed by light microscopy and measurement of the transepithelial electrical resistance at room temperature (Millicell-ERS, Millipore AG). A transepithelial electrical resistance of >250 ohms × cm2 indicated confluence. Primary intestinal fibroblasts were derived from an intestinal mucosal biopsy that was cultured in HEPES-buffered minimal essential medium, 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 200 μg/ml chlorotetracycline, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mmglutamine. For experiments, intestinal fibroblasts at passages 4–10 were used. HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells were grown in the same medium as described for intestinal fibroblasts with addition of 1× nonessential amino acids (100 μm each) and omission of chlorotetracycline. Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells stably transfected with human meprin-α cDNA (32Eldering J.A. Grünberg J. Hahn D. Croes H.J. Fransen J.A. Sterchi E.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 920-932Google Scholar) were grown in HEPES-buffered minimal essential medium supplemented with 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 400 μg/ml Geneticin, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. Confluent cells were incubated for 24 h in serum-free medium. The conditioned medium was removed, sterile-filtered, and stored at −20 °C until further usage. 5 × 105 primary intestinal fibroblasts or HT-1080 cells were seeded on six-well companion plates and grown for 24 h until confluence. Caco-2 cells were grown separately for 7 days post-confluence on filter supports as described above. Cells were washed twice with serum-free medium to remove fetal calf serum. Inserts with Caco-2 cells were then assembled with the fibroblasts grown on the companion plates and incubated for 20 h in 2 ml of serum-free medium in each compartment. Human plasminogen was added to the basolateral medium as indicated. The culture media from the apical and basolateral compartments were collected, sterile-filtered, and stored at −20 °C until further usage. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, scraped with a rubber spatula, and harvested by centrifugation. The sedimented cells were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors (2 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 3.5 μg/ml benzamidine, and 1.7 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and lysed in 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 and 1% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate for 30 min on ice. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant is referred to as the cell lysate. Protein samples were subjected to electrophoresis under reducing or nonreducing conditions on 7.5 or 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Hybond P, Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was saturated with 5% dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline for 2 h, incubated overnight with the indicated antibody (polyclonal anti-meprin-α antibody, 1:2000–1:5000 dilution; or monoclonal anti-u-PA antibody, 1:1000 dilution), and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (1:10,000 dilution) for 1.5 h at room temperature. Immunocomplexes were visualized using the ECL Plus Western blotting kit (Amersham Biosciences) and x-ray films. The activity of plasminogen activators was determined by fibrin zymography as described previously (34Choi N.S. Kim S.H. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 281: 236-238Google Scholar). Bovine fibrin (1.2 mg/ml) and plasminogen (15 μg/ml) were copolymerized on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. 15-μl aliquots of conditioned medium were subjected to electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions. The gel was washed with 2.5% Triton X-100 for 1 h at room temperature to remove SDS, followed by 16 h of development in 30 mmTris-HCl, 200 mm NaCl, and 0.02% NaN3 (pH 7.4) at 37 °C. The gel was stained and fixed with 0.1% Coomassie Blue R-250 in methanol/acetic acid/water (40:10:50). Total RNA was isolated from cultured cells using the acid guanidinium/thiocyanate method according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Trizol reagent, Invitrogen). First-strand cDNA synthesis was carried out with 1 μg of RNA and random hexanucleotide primers using the GeneAmp® RNA PCR kit (Applied Biosystems). The amount of cDNA in each sample was quantified using PCR with primers for the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene as an internal standard. The oligonucleotide primers employed for the PCRs were as follows: meprin-α(5′), 5′-GGGACATCCTCTTGCAGAAATCC-3′; meprin-α(3′), 5′-CAACGAGTCT GTCTGAAGGACTTC-3′; u-PA(5′), 5′-GGAGGGCAGCACTGTGAAATAG-3′; u-PA(3′), 5′-AAGGCAATGTCGTTGTGGTGAG-3′; t-PA(5′), 5′-TGGAGCAGTCTTCGTTTCGC-3′; t-PA(3′), 5′-CCCATTCCCAAAGTAGCAGTCAC-3′; u-PAR(5′, 5′-TGTAAGACCAACGGGGATTGC-3′; u-PAR(3′), 5′-CGGTGGCTACCAGACATTGATTC-3′; PAI-1(5′), 5′-TTTGGTGAAGGGTCTGCTGTGC-3′; PAI-1(3′), 5′-CGTCTGATTTGTGGAAGAGGCG-3′; PAI-2(5′), 5′-CAGAAGGGTAGTTATCCTGATGCG-3′; PAI-2(3′), 5′-GCTGGTCCACTTGTTGAGTTTGTC-3′; GAPDH(5′), 5′-ACATCAAGAAGGTGGTGAAGCAGG-3′; and GAPDH(3′), 5′-CTCTTCCTCTTGTGCTCTTGCTGG-3′. PCR conditions were as follows: 2 min at 95 °C; 35 cycles for 0.5 min at 95 °C, 0.5 min at 56–58 °C, and 1.5 min at 72 °C; and 10 min at 72 °C. Prior to assaying, cells were suspended in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and lysed by sonification for 1 min at 4 °C. Alkaline phosphatase activity was measured at room temperature by following the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate with a commercially available kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Basel). Sucrase-isomaltase activity was assayed in cell extracts using the method of Dahlqvist (35Dahlqvist A. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 1984; 44: 169-172Google Scholar). Meprin-α activity was measured in the culture media after zymogen activation with trypsin or plasmin usingN-benzoyl-l-tyrosyl-p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA peptide) as a substrate and analyzed as described previously (8Sterchi E.E. Naim H.Y. Lentze M.J. Hauri H.P. Fransen J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 265: 105-118Google Scholar). u-PA activity was determined by measuring the increase in absorbance of the free chromophore p-nitroanilide generated after hydrolysis of carbobenzoxy-l-Glu(α-t-butyl-ester)-Gly-Arg-p-nitroanilide (SPECTROZYME® UK, no. 244, American Diagnostica). For the assay, cells were grown for 20 h in serum-free medium (free of colored matter). Enzyme activity was measured in sterile-filtered medium according to the manufacturer's instructions using high molecular mass u-PA as an activity standard. Purification of plasmin-activated meprin-α was achieved according to the procedure described for purification of trypsin-activated meprin-α (36Köhler D. Kruse M.-N. Stöcker W. Sterchi E.E. FEBS Lett. 2000; 465: 2-7Google Scholar) with a slight modification. Recombinant promeprin-α (500 μg), purified by gel filtration from overexpressing High Five insect cell culture medium, was incubated with 10 nm human plasmin in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, 0.1m NaCl, 0.1% polyethylene glycol 8000 (pH 7.5) for 5 h at room temperature. The activated form of meprin-α was loaded onto an affinity column carrying the immobilized inhibitor Pro-Leu-Gly-hydroxamate, which selectively binds active meprin-α. After elution, protein fractions with the highest meprin-α activity were pooled, precipitated, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Following transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, the Coomassie Blue-stained meprin-α band was excised and subjected to N-terminal amino acid sequencing (SeqLab). We have previously shown a non-polarized secretion of meprin-α in Caco-2 cells (20Lottaz D. Maurer C.A. Hahn D. Büchler M.W. Sterchi E.E. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1127-1133Google Scholar). To analyze this further, Caco-2 cells were grown on PET membrane inserts over a period of 21 days post-confluence. During this period, Caco-2 cells differentiate spontaneously to a polarized phenotype (37Mariadason J.M. Rickard K.L. Barkla D.H. Augenlicht L.H. Gibson P.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 347-354Google Scholar). Establishment of tight monolayers was judged by light microscopy and measurement of the transepithelial electrical resistance. At 7 days post-confluence, the transepithelial electrical resistance reached a level of 700–750 ohms × cm2, a value that is generally accepted as proof of a tight cell layer. Apical and basolateral media as well as cell lysates at different days post-confluence were analyzed for meprin-α protein expression by immunoblotting (Fig. 1). A plateau of maximal meprin-α expression was reached at 7 days post-confluence (Fig. 1 A, lane 3). The higher molecular mass form of 100 kDa in cell extracts represents the endoplasmic reticulum resident precursor of meprin-α (18Grünberg J. Dumermuth E. Eldering J.A. Sterchi E.E. FEBS Lett. 1993; 335: 376-379Google Scholar), whereas the 90-kDa protein corresponds to the C-terminally processed form of meprin-α (38Hahn D. Lottaz D. Sterchi E.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 933-941Google Scholar). We confirmed that the 95-kDa secreted form of meprin-α was directed in a non-polarized way to the apical and basolateral compartments (Fig.1 B). In accordance with expression levels, a maximal level of total meprin-α secretion was reached at 7 days post-confluence (Fig. 1 B, lanes 5 and 6). More than 50% of the enzyme reached the basolateral compartment at this time, as verified by densitometric scanning analysis. Although secretion of meprin-α into the apical medium remained constant during the residual culture period, the amount of basolaterally secreted meprin-α diminished in the later phases of cell culture (Fig. 1 B,lanes 10 and 12). This is most likely the result of hindrance of basolateral transport due to the formation of cell multilayers, a phenomenon that has been described for prolonged cultivation of Caco-2 cells on PET filters (39Rothen-Rutishauser B. Braun A. Günthert M. Wunderli-Allenspach H. Pharm. Res. (N. Y.). 2000; 17: 460-465Google Scholar). When Caco-2 cells were grown on polycarbonate membranes (Millicell), ∼50% of meprin-α was secreted basolaterally throughout the 21-day culture period (Fig.1 C, lanes 8, 10, and 12). Thus, cells cultivated for >10 days post-confluence on PET filters were prone to “filter clogging.” To analyze the phenotypic development of cell polarization during the culture period, the activity of two marker enzymes of the brush-border membrane, alkaline phosphatase and sucrase-isomaltase, were assayed in the Caco-2 cell extracts. Alkaline phosphatase and sucrase-isomaltase activities both increased progressively, reaching a 3-fold increase at 7 days post-confluence, further demonstrating that cells had reached a differentiated state (data not shown). In conclusion, meprin-α protein expression is induced in differentiated Caco-2 cells, and targeting and secretion of the enzyme are clearly independent of cell polarization. Taking all these results into account, plus the fact that cells may be monitored by light microscopy on PET filters, we used 7-day post-confluent Caco-2 cells grown on these filter inserts for the subsequent co-cultures experiments. Following zymogen activation by limited trypsin treatment, meprin-α hydrolytic activity was measured using the PABA peptide as a substrate (8Sterchi E.E. Naim H.Y. Lentze M.J. Hauri H.P. Fransen J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 265: 105-118Google Scholar). To investigate whether plasmin activates promeprin-α, the medium of MDCK cells stably transfected with meprin-α cDNA (32Eldering J.A. Grünberg J. Hahn D. Croes H.J. Fransen J.A. Sterchi E.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 920-932Google Scholar) was incubated with various concentrations of human plasmin or trypsin ranging from 10 to 500 nm for 2 h at 37 °C. Measurement of PABA peptide-hydrolyzing activity revealed that active meprin-α was generated in a dose-dependent manner after plasmin and trypsin treatment (Fig. 2). Plasmin showed no hydrolytic activity for the PABA peptide itself (not shown). The activities of trypsin-treated meprin-α were higher than those after plasmin treatment, indicating that activation by trypsin was more efficient. Processing of promeprin-α by plasmin was also assessed by immunoblotting. The zymogen was incubated with pure human plasmin or trypsin (50 nm) for 0–6 h at 37 °C. Immunodetection using an anti-meprin-α antibody directed against both the zymogen and mature enzyme (Fig. 2 B, upper panel) revealed a protein band corresponding to the zymogen (95 kDa) and an additional slightly smaller band after 3 and 6 h of incubation with plasmin. Detection with an antibody recognizing only the zymogen (Fig.2 B, lower panel) showed that this form disappeared with incubation time, confirming that promeprin-α was converted to mature meprin-α by plasmin treatment. Activation of meprin-α with trypsin (50 nm) for 3 h led to a quantitative conversion of promeprin-α to the mature form. To map the cleavage site, plasmin-activated meprin-α was subjected to N-terminal sequence analysis. Recombinant meprin-α (500 μg) isolated from the culture medium of meprin-α-overexpressing High Five insect cells was incubated with human plasmin (10 nm) for 5 h at room temperature. The activated form of meprin-α was then purified by affinity chromatography, followed by SDS-PAGE and transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The N-terminal sequence obtained corresponds to the sequence previously reported for trypsin-activated meprin-α (18Grünberg J. Dumermuth E. Eldering J.A. Sterchi E.E. FEBS Lett. 1993; 335: 376-379Google Scholar). Hence, plasmin and trypsin cleave promeprin-α at the same site, between Arg65 and Asn66, thereby generating mature enzymes with identical N termini. Non-polarized secretion of meprin-α from colon cancer cells, increased meprin-α activity measured in colon cancer tissue homogenates (20Lottaz D. Maurer C.A. Hahn D. Büchler M.W. Sterchi E.E. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1127-1133Google Scholar), and up-regulation of components involved in plasminogen activation described in colon adenocarcinomas (28Yang J.L. Seetoo D. Wang Y. Ranson M.

Addressing this issue, we established an in vitroco-culture model of the intestinal mucosa composed of Caco-2 cells grown on filter supports and primary intestinal fibroblasts grown to confluence in the bottom companion dish (see model in Fig. 8). We investigated whether basolaterally secreted meprin-α was activated if plasminogen was added to the lower compartment of the co-cultures (Fig.3). In addition to primary intestinal fibroblasts that were isolated from an intestinal mucosal biopsy, HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells were used in the co-culture experiments. The latter are known to express elevated levels of plasminogen activators (40Quax P.H. van Leeuwen R.T. Verspaget H.W. Verheijen J.H. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 1488-1494Google Scholar). The presence of plasminogen in the basolateral medium of the co-cultures resulted in a dose-dependent activation of meprin-α in this compartment, whereas no activity was measured in the absence of plasminogen (Fig. 3 A). Addition of plasminogen to the apical compartment did not lead to activation of apically secreted meprin-α. This, plus the fact that addition of plasminogen to the basolateral medium of Caco-2 cells cultured alone did not lead to promeprin-α act"

One of the key players in this machinery appears to be the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA)/uPA receptor system. The role of uPA and its receptor (CD87) in plasminogen (Plg) activation, cell adhesion, and chemotaxis is well established; however, less is known of how these activities are regulated. Here we provide evidence that the mannose 6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor 2 receptor (CD222) controls CD87-mediated functions. Expression of human CD222 in CD222−/− mouse fibroblasts down-regulated Plg activation, cell adhesion, and chemotaxis induced by the uPA/CD87 system. In addition, we demonstrate that the N-terminal region of CD222, which is similar to the Plg-binding site of streptokinase, plays a crucial role in binding of CD87 and Plg. A peptide derived from this region in CD222 is able to disrupt the physical interaction of CD222 with CD87 and, furthermore, mimics the inhibitory effects of CD222 on CD87 functions. Taken together, our results indicate a novel role for CD222 in regulation of fibrinolysis, cell adhesion, and migration.

The migration of leukocytes toward the site of inflammation is a complex process in which several mechanisms are harnessed.

Second, cell surface-mediated proteolysis facilitates leukocyte transmigration across the vessel walls by degrading extracellular matrix proteins and basement membrane.

This machinery is not restricted to leukocytes but used by all cells that migrate including tumor cells.One of the key players in this cell migration event seems to be the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) 1The abbreviations used are: uPA, urokinase-type plasminogen activator; BB, binding buffer; BSA, bovine serum albumin; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; IGF2, insulin-like growth factor 2; LB, lysis buffer; M6-P, mannose 6-phosphate; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PAI, plasminogen activator inhibitor; PBMC, peripheral blood mononuclear cell; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; pepA, peptide A; pepB, peptide B; pepBscr , scrambled peptide B; pepC, peptide C; Plg, plasminogen; TA, tranexamic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: uPA, urokinase-type plasminogen activator; BB, binding buffer; BSA, bovine serum albumin; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; IGF2, insulin-like growth factor 2; LB, lysis buffer; M6-P, mannose 6-phosphate; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PAI, plasminogen activator inhibitor; PBMC, peripheral blood mononuclear cell; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; pepA, peptide A; pepB, peptide B; pepBscr , scrambled peptide B; pepC, peptide C; Plg, plasminogen; TA, tranexamic acid. receptor (CD87). CD87 is a highly glycosylated 50–65-kDa protein linked to the plasma membrane by glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) (3Blasi F. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 415-417Google Scholar, 4Behrendt N. Rønne E. Danø K. Biol. Chem. Hoppe Seyler. 1995; 376: 269-279Google Scholar). CD87 is expressed on a multitude of cells including monocytes, neutrophils, activated T cells, endothelial cells, and tumor cells. It mediates generation of cell-surface proteolytic activity by binding pro-urokinase (pro-uPA). Receptor-bound pro-uPA can be activated to uPA, which in turn activates cell-bound plasminogen (Plg) to plasmin, a serine protease with broad substrate specificity (5Plow E.F. Herren T. Redlitz A. Miles L.A. Hoover-Plow J.L. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 939-945Google Scholar). This conveys to cells a proteolytic potential required for remodeling of pericellular space during migration. Independently of its function in the fibrinolytic (Plg/plasmin) system, CD87 was shown to have further roles in cell migration (6Waltz D.A. Fujita R.M. Yang X. Natkin L. Zhuo S. Gerard C.J.

It was demonstrated that the binding of uPA to CD87 induced adhesion of myeloid cells to the matrix protein vitronectin (8Waltz D.A. Chapman H.A. J. Biol.

In addition, uPA promoted the chemotactic movement of different cell types (10Boyle M.D. Chiodo V.A. Lawman M.J. Gee A.P. Young M. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 169-174Google Scholar, 11Gyetko M.R.

Chapman H.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1285-1294Google Scholar). In addition, specific inhibitors (plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) and type 2 (PAI-2)) control the activity of uPA. Once formed, the complex of PAI-1·uPA·CD87 is immediately internalized by the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein/α2-macroglobulin receptor (CD91). This leads to lysosomal degradation of uPA and subsequent recycling of disengaged CD87 back to the cell surface (18Conese M. Nykjaer A. Petersen C.M. Cremona O. Pardi R. Andreasen P.A. Gliemann J. Christensen E.I. Blasi F. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1609-1622Google Scholar, 19Zhang J.C. Sakthivel R. Kniss D. Graham C.H. Strickland D.K. McCrae K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32273-32280Google Scholar).However, recent studies indicate that there is also an additional mechanism able to internalize CD87 independently of the CD91 pathway (20Vilhardt F. Nielsen M. Sandvig K. van Deurs B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 179-195Google Scholar). This mechanism may be mediated by the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate/IGF2 receptor, recently assigned as CD222 (21Godár S. Leksa V. Cebecauer M. Hilgert I. Horejsi V. Stockinger H. Mason D. Andre P. Bensussan A. Buckley C. Civin C. Clark E. de Haas M. Goyert S. Hadam M. Hart D. Horejsi V. Jones Y. Meuer S. Morrissey J. Schwarz-Albiez R. Shaw S. Simmons D. Turni L. Uguccioni M. van der Schoot E. Vivier E. Zola H. Leukocyte Typing VII. Oxford University Press, Oxford2002: 482-485Google Scholar). CD222 is a ubiquitously expressed 250-kDa type I transmembrane protein. The majority of CD222 molecules (∼90–95%) are located intracellularly; only 5–10% are present on the cell membrane. CD222 is a multifunctional receptor binding a multitude of ligands. It transports newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes, modified by mannose 6-phosphate residues (M6-P), from the Golgi apparatus to lysosomes; however, it also binds and internalizes exogenous M6-P-containing ligands. Furthermore, it is crucial for the internalization and degradation of IGF2 and thereby controls cell growth (22Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 307-330Google Scholar, 23Dahms N.M. Biochem.

CD222 binds also CD87 and, notably, Plg (25Nykjaer A. Christensen E.I. Vorum H. Hager H. Petersen C.M. Roigaard H. Min H.Y. Vilhardt F. Moller L.B. Kornfeld S. Gliemann J. J.

Thus, CD222 is a receptor for two critical components of the fibrinolytic system. This tempted us to speculate that CD222 is involved in the regulation of fibrinolysis.In the present study we show that, in fact, CD222 has a general impact on CD87 functions. By employing CD222-deficient mouse fibroblasts expressing human CD222 and human CD87, we demonstrate that CD222 regulates CD87-dependent Plg activation, cell adhesion, and chemotaxis. Furthermore, we identified an amino acid stretch in CD222 to be involved in binding and regulation of CD87.DISCUSSIONIn the present study we provide for the first time evidence that CD222, which directly binds CD87 and Plg (25Nykjaer A. Christensen E.I. Vorum H. Hager H. Petersen C.M. Roigaard H. Min H.Y. Vilhardt F. Moller L.B. Kornfeld S. Gliemann J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 815-828Google Scholar, 26Godár S. Horejsi V. Weidle U.H. Binder B.R. Hansmann C. Stockinger H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 1004-1013Google Scholar), is a regulator of fibrinolysis and cell migration. By gene transfer we were able to show that CD222 expression down-regulated CD87-mediated Plg activation, cell adhesion, and chemotaxis. Furthermore, a peptide derived from the region within CD222 could be identified as critical for the interaction with CD87 and Plg, and was effective in modulation of CD87-mediated functions.Mouse CD222-negative fibroblasts expressing human CD87 displayed augmented cell surface-associated Plg activation. This finding is in agreement with the established model that binding of uPA to CD87 leads to amplification of cell surface-associated proteolytic activity. PAI-1, a potent inhibitor of uPA, inhibited activation of Plg, confirming the Plg activator dependence of this process. The activation was also totally abolished in the presence of TA, a lysine analogue known to prevent Plg binding to lysine-binding sites on cells (43Lee S.W. Ellis V. Dichek D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2411-2418Google Scholar, 44Ellis V. Whawell S.A. Werner F. Deadman J.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 651-659Google Scholar), indicating that binding of Plg to cells was required for its activation. Co-expression of human CD222 reduced the enhanced ability of CD87+ cells to activate Plg. This finding was the first to indicate that CD222 had a regulatory effect on CD87-mediated functions.In addition to its contribution to the proteolytic cascade, CD87 participates also in cell adhesion and chemotaxis. Occupancy of CD87 by uPA promoted cell adhesion to vitronectin, an abundant component of the extracellular matrix (8Waltz D.A. Chapman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14746-14750Google Scholar, 9Wei Y. Waltz D.A. Rao N. Drummond R.J. Rosenberg S. Chapman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32380-32388Google Scholar), and chemotactic locomotion of different cell types was induced by uPA binding to CD87 (10Boyle M.D. Chiodo V.A. Lawman M.J. Gee A.P. Young M. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 169-174Google Scholar, 11Gyetko M.R. Todd III, R.F. Wilkinson C.C. Sitrin R.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1380-1387Google Scholar, 12Resnati M. Guttinger M. Valcamonica S. Sidenius N. Blasi F. Fazioli F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1572-1582Google Scholar, 13Fazioli F. Resnati M. Sidenius N. Higashimoto Y. Appella E. Blasi F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7279-7286Google Scholar). Our model system is consistent with and confirms these findings. Expression of human CD87 in mouse CD222−/− fibroblasts caused significantly enhanced adhesion to vitronectin, and this increase was more profound in the presence of uPA (Fig. 3). Furthermore, the uPA-induced chemotactic locomotion of CD87+ fibroblasts was significantly higher as compared with the untransduced parental cells. PAI-1 inhibited both the uPA-induced cell adhesion and chemotaxis of CD87+ cells. This inhibition is in accord with previous studies demonstrating down-regulation of adhesion and chemotaxis by PAI-1 through either inhibition of CD87 binding to vitronectin (45Waltz D.A. Natkin L.R. Fujita R.M. Wei Y. Chapman H.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 58-67Google Scholar) and/or promotion of CD87 internalization by CD91 (41Degryse B. Sier C.F. Resnati M. Conese M. Blasi F. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 249-254Google Scholar) and, thus, confirms the uPA/CD87 dependence of these processes in these cells. Noteworthy, as in the Plg activation assay, expression of CD222 reversed the uPA/CD87-mediated adhesion and chemotaxis.To understand how CD222 affects CD87 functions at the molecular level, we mapped the binding sites for CD87 and Plg on CD222. Our data demonstrate that the N-terminal region of CD222 is critical for binding of both CD87 and Plg. The relevance of the N-terminal region of CD222 in this interaction is underlined by its similarity to the N-terminal part of streptokinase (Fig. 7), which binds and activates Plg, thereby facilitating invasion of bacteria through the host tissue barriers. The stretch around Val19 in the N terminus of streptokinase is implicated in Plg binding (35Wang X. Lin X. Loy J.A. Tang J. Zhang X.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1662-1665Google Scholar, 37Kim D.M. Lee S.J. Kim I.C. Kim S.T. Byun S.M. Thromb. Res. 2000; 99: 93-98Google Scholar), and that around Leu42is involved in activation of Plg (38Liu L. Sazonova I.Y. Turner R.B. Chowdhry S.A. Tsai J. Houng A.K. Reed G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37686-37691Google Scholar). From the corresponding sequences within the N terminus of CD222, we designed two peptides, termed pepB and pepC, respectively. PepB but not pepC was able to disrupt physical interaction of CD222 with CD87 as shown by co-precipitation analysis. Moreover, the same peptide had an inhibitory effect on uPA/CD87-mediated Plg activation, cell adhesion, and chemotaxis of CD87+ single transductants, the density-dependent responses of CD222+/CD87+ transductants, as well as the responses of monocytes. Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that we have established an agonistic peptide from CD222, which targets CD222-free forms of CD87 and thereby mimics the inhibitory effect of endogenous CD222 on CD87.Several possibilities can be envisaged of how CD222 controls CD87 functions. First, steric hindrance could lead to masking of uPA binding sites on CD87 by CD222 and thus to the blockade of CD87 functions. Second, the finding of Nykjaer and colleagues (25Nykjaer A. Christensen E.I. Vorum H. Hager H. Petersen C.M. Roigaard H. Min H.Y. Vilhardt F. Moller L.B. Kornfeld S. Gliemann J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 815-828Google Scholar) showing that CD222 targets CD87 into lysosomes suggests internalization of CD87 by CD222 followed by degradation of CD87. This pathway might be different from the CD91-mediated internalization, ligand clearing, and recycling of CD87, which leads to re-activation instead of termination of CD87 functions (18Conese M. Nykjaer A. Petersen C.M. Cremona O. Pardi R. Andreasen P.A. Gliemann J. Christensen E.I. Blasi F. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1609-1622Google Scholar, 19Zhang J.C. Sakthivel R. Kniss D. Graham C.H. Strickland D.K. McCrae K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32273-32280Google Scholar). Third, interaction of CD222 with CD87 could influence the ligand binding capacity of CD87 by changing the CD87 conformation. Finally, binding of CD222 and CD87 could alter the complex formation of CD87 with other membrane partners, Src kinases (46Stefanova I. Horejsi V. Ansotegui I.J. Knapp W. Stockinger H. Science. 1991; 254: 1016-1019Google Scholar), integrins (14Bohuslav J. Horejsi V. Hansmann C. Stockl J. Weidle U.H. Majdic O. Bartke I. Knapp W. Stockinger H. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1381-1390Google Scholar), CD91 (18Conese M. Nykjaer A. Petersen C.M. Cremona O. Pardi R. Andreasen P.A. Gliemann J. Christensen E.I. Blasi F. J.

Immunol. 2001; 166: 4822-4825Google Scholar), and thereby the functions underlying these molecular interactions.The platforms of these interactions seem to be GPI microdomains or lipid rafts (14Bohuslav J.

Stockinger H. Binder B.R. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 305-311Google Scholar). These plasma membrane compartments are more and more viewed as to control receptor signaling across the plasma membrane and execution of receptor functions at the membrane by facilitating association/dissociation of receptors, transmembrane adaptors, and submembrane signaling components (51Horejsi V. Cebecauer M. Cerny J. Brdicka T. Angelisova P. Drbal K. Stockinger H. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 356-361Google Scholar). These microdomains are characterized by low density and by the enrichment of the GPI proteins expressed in a given cell, glycosphingolipids, cholesterol, and Src kinases; they are also devoid of most transmembrane receptor proteins. The “CD87 microdomain” of monocytes is special, as it harbors among GPI proteins exclusively CD87 and contains as constitutive components the transmembrane receptors CD222 and integrins (14Bohuslav J. Horejsi V. Hansmann C. Stockl J. Weidle U.H. Majdic O. Bartke I. Knapp W. Stockinger H. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1381-1390Google Scholar, 26Godár S. Horejsi V. Weidle U.H. Binder B.R. Hansmann C. Stockinger H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 1004-1013Google Scholar). Human CD87 and human CD222 meet also in the membrane of the mouse fibroblast transductants in such low density microdomains (Fig. 1and data not shown).CD222 circles between trans-Golgi network, lysosomes, plasma membrane, and endosomes with a rapid turnover. This trafficking appears to be regulated by a variety of factors including CD222 ligands, growth factors, retinoic acid, and phorbol esters (52Braulke T. Tippmer S. Neher E. von Figura K. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 681-686Google Scholar, 53Prence E.M. Dong J.M. Sahagian G.G. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 319-326Google Scholar, 54Zhang Q. Berggren P.O. Tally M. J. Biol.

Thus, the number of CD222 molecules in the plasma membrane can be rapidly changed in response to various stimuli. In respect to our data, this shuttling might allow cells a tight and quick control of cell surface-associated proteolysis, adhesion, and chemotaxis. CD222 was proposed as a tumor suppressor by, e.g., scavenging of the growth factor IGF2, activation of transforming growth factor-β1 (56De Souza A.T. Yamada T. Mills J.J. Jirtle R.L. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 60-67Google Scholar). The loss of CD222 function may, therefore, not only lead to uncontrolled growth but also to loss of control over CD87 and consequently to elevated pericellular proteolysis and increased invasion of tumor cells. The migration of leukocytes toward the site of inflammation is a complex process in which several mechanisms are harnessed. First, leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium is mediated by a variety of receptors expressed on both leukocytes and endothelial cells. Second, cell surface-mediated proteolysis facilitates leukocyte transmigration across the vessel walls by degrading extracellular matrix proteins and basement membrane. Third, chemoattractants produced at the site of injury promote leukocyte locomotion within target tissues (1Dunon D. Piali L. Imhof B.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 714-723Google Scholar, 2Sendo F. Araki Y. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1999; 66: 369-374Google Scholar). This machinery is not restricted to leukocytes but used by all cells that migrate including tumor cells. One of the key players in this cell migration event seems to be the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) 1The abbreviations used are: uPA, urokinase-type plasminogen activator; BB, binding buffer; BSA, bovine serum albumin; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; IGF2, insulin-like growth factor 2; LB, lysis buffer; M6-P, mannose 6-phosphate; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PAI, plasminogen activator inhibitor; PBMC, peripheral blood mononuclear cell; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; pepA, peptide A; pepB, peptide B; pepBscr , scrambled peptide B; pepC, peptide C; Plg, plasminogen; TA, tranexamic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: uPA, urokinase-type plasminogen activator; BB, binding buffer; BSA, bovine serum albumin; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; IGF2, insulin-like growth factor 2; LB, lysis buffer; M6-P, mannose 6-phosphate; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PAI, plasminogen activator inhibitor; PBMC, peripheral blood mononuclear cell; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; pepA, peptide A; pepB, peptide B; pepBscr , scrambled peptide B; pepC, peptide C; Plg, plasminogen; TA, tranexamic acid. receptor (CD87). CD87 is a highly glycosylated 50–65-kDa protein linked to the plasma membrane by glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) (3Blasi F. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 415-417Google Scholar, 4Behrendt N. Rønne E.

It mediates generation of cell-surface proteolytic activity by binding pro-urokinase (pro-uPA). Receptor-bound pro-uPA can be activated to uPA, which in turn activates cell-bound plasminogen (Plg) to plasmin, a serine protease with broad substrate specificity (5Plow E.F. Herren T. Redlitz A. Miles L.A. Hoover-Plow J.L. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 939-945Google Scholar). This conveys to cells a proteolytic potential required for remodeling of pericellular space during migration. Independently of its function in the fibrinolytic (Plg/plasmin) system, CD87 was shown to have further roles in cell migration (6Waltz D.A. Fujita R.M. Yang X. Natkin L. Zhuo S. Gerard C.J.

Papapoulos S. Lowik C. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 159: 971-982Google Scholar). It was demonstrated that the binding of uPA to CD87 induced adhesion of myeloid cells to the matrix protein vitronectin (8Waltz D.A. Chapman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14746-14750Google Scholar, 9Wei Y. Waltz D.A. Rao N. Drummond R.J. Rosenberg S. Chapman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32380-32388Google Scholar). In addition, uPA promoted the chemotactic movement of different cell types (10Boyle M.D. Chiodo V.A. Lawman M.J. Gee A.P. Young M. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 169-174Google Scholar, 11Gyetko M.R.

It has been suggested that the interaction of CD87 with integrins and caveolin participates in regulation of cell adhesion and in focusing of pericellular proteolysis to specific extracellular sites (14Bohuslav J.

Once formed, the complex of PAI-1·uPA·CD87 is immediately internalized by the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein/α2-macroglobulin receptor (CD91). This leads to lysosomal degradation of uPA and subsequent recycling of disengaged CD87 back to the cell surface (18Conese M. Nykjaer A. Petersen C.M. Cremona O. Pardi R. Andreasen P.A. Gliemann J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 32273-32280Google Scholar). However, recent studies indicate that there is also an additional mechanism able to internalize CD87 independently of the CD91 pathway (20Vilhardt F. Nielsen M. Sandvig K. van Deurs B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 179-195Google Scholar). This mechanism may be mediated by the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate/IGF2 receptor, recently assigned as CD222 (21Godár S. Leksa V. Cebecauer M. Hilgert I. Horejsi V. Stockinger H. Mason D. Andre P. Bensussan A. Buckley C. Civin C. Clark E. de Haas M. Goyert S. Hadam M. Hart D. Horejsi V. Jones Y. Meuer S. Morrissey J. Schwarz-Albiez R. Shaw S. Simmons D. Turni L.

CD222 is a ubiquitously expressed 250-kDa type I transmembrane protein. The majority of CD222 molecules (∼90–95%) are located intracellularly; only 5–10% are present on the cell membrane. CD222 is a multifunctional receptor binding a multitude of ligands. It transports newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes, modified by mannose 6-phosphate residues (M6-P), from the Golgi apparatus to lysosomes; however, it also binds and internalizes exogenous M6-P-containing ligands. Furthermore, it is crucial for the internalization and degradation of IGF2 and thereby controls cell growth (22Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 307-330Google Scholar, 23Dahms N.M. Biochem.

CD222 binds also CD87 and, notably, Plg (25Nykjaer A. Christensen E.I. Vorum H. Hager H. Petersen C.M. Roigaard H. Min H.Y. Vilhardt F. Moller L.B. Kornfeld S. Gliemann J. J.

Thus, CD222 is a receptor for two critical components of the fibrinolytic system. This tempted us to speculate that CD222 is involved in the regulation of fibrinolysis. In the present study we show that, in fact, CD222 has a general impact on CD87 functions. By employing CD222-deficient mouse fibroblasts expressing human CD222 and human CD87, we demonstrate that CD222 regulates CD87-dependent Plg activation, cell adhesion, and chemotaxis. Furthermore, we identified an amino acid stretch in CD222 to be involved in binding and regulation of CD87. DISCUSSIONIn the present study we provide for the first time evidence that CD222, which directly binds CD87 and Plg (25Nykjaer A. Christensen E.I. Vorum H. Hager H. Petersen C.M. Roigaard H. Min H.Y.

All of the antibodies obtained reacted with the same protein bands on SDS-PAGE of hemocyte lysate. Flow cytometry and biotinylation of surface substances on the hemocytes indicated that the antigens are major peripheral proteins of hemocytes. The antigens were purified from hemocyte lysate and were good substrates for the horseshoe crab hemocyte transglutaminase (HcTGase). Transglutaminases play an important role during the final stage of blood coagulation in mammals and crustaceans. Although HcTGase did not intermolecularly cross-link a clottable protein coagulogen or its proteolytic product coagulin, HcTGase promoted the cross-linking of coagulin with the surface antigens, resulting in the formation of a stable polymer. We determined the nucleotide sequences for two isoproteins of the antigens. The two proteins containing 271 and 284 residues (66% identity) were composed of tandem repeats of proline-rich segments. We named them proxins-1 and -2 after proline-rich proteins for protein cross-linking. Proxins may form a stable physical barrier against invading pathogens in cooperation with hemolymph coagulation at injured sites.

All multicellular organisms have some form of innate immune system. Recent studies (1Lemaitre B. Nicolas E. Michaut L. Reichhart J.M. Hoffmann J.A. Cell. 1996; 86: 973-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3020) Google Scholar, 2Medzhitov R. Preston-Hurlburt P. Janeway Jr., C.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (4458) Google Scholar) have revealed that insects and mammals conserve a signaling pathway of the innate immune system through cell-surface receptors, Toll and Toll-like receptors. The system is a sensitive non-self-recognizing cascade triggered by microbial cell wall constituents. The target molecules of innate immune systems are not proteins of direct gene products but rather molecular arrays or patterns shared among groups of pathogens. They are called pathogen-associated molecular patterns and include lipopolysaccharides (LPS),1β-1,3-glucans, and peptidoglycans (3Söderhall K. Cerenius L. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar, 4Ashida M. Brey P.T. Brey P.T. Hultmark D. Molecular Mechanisms of Immune Responses in Insects.

The major host defense system in the horseshoe crab Tachypleus tridentatus is carried by hemolymph that contains a kind of granular hemocytes, which make up 99% of the total hemocytes (7Toh Y. Mizutani A. Tokunaga F. Muta T. Iwanaga S. Cell Tissue Res. 1991; 266: 137-147Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The granular hemocyte is filled with two types of secretory granules, L-granules and S-granules, which selectively store defense molecules such as coagulation factors, protease inhibitors, lectins, and antimicrobial peptides (5Iwanaga S. Kawabata S. Muta T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 6Iwanaga S. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The hemocyte is highly sensitive to LPS, and the defense molecules stored are secreted by exocytosis in response to stimulation by LPS. This response is very important for host defense involving the engulfing and killing of invading microbes, in addition to preventing the leakage of hemolymph. To identify the cell surface proteins of hemocytes involved in the innate immunity, monoclonal antibodies were raised against the hemocytes of T. tridentatus. Here we purified, characterized, and determined the cDNA sequences of the major surface antigens on hemocytes. Coagulogen (8Nakamura S. Iwanaga S. Harada T. Niwa M. J. Biochem.

LPS from Salmonella minnesotaR595 was from List Biological Laboratories, Inc. (Campbell, CA). Hemolymph was collected into 5 volumes of 2% paraformaldehyde in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, containing 0.5 m NaCl and 0.05% NaN2(PBS) and allowed to stand for 10 min at 25 °C. The fixed hemocytes were collected by centrifugation at 800 rpm (100 × g) at 4 °C for 5 min and washed three times with PBS. The cell numbers were counted by a Coulter Z1 cell counter (Coulter Electronics, Ltd., Luton, UK). The immunization and hybridoma preparation were carried out at Panapharm Laboratories, Co., Ltd., Kumamoto, Japan. Five mice were immunized by injection of the fixed hemocyte suspension containing 2 × 106 cells emulsified with complete Freund's adjuvant. Hybridoma cells were plated in microculture plates, and positive hybridomas were screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Positive hybridomas selected were further analyzed by a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Briefly, each culture supernatant was incubated with the fixed hemocytes at 105 cells/ml in PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin on ice for 30 min. After washing with the same buffer, the hemocytes were incubated with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) on ice for 30 min. After washing, the labeled hemocytes were analyzed using the flow cytometer. For each sample, 1.0 × 104 cells were analyzed using Cellquest software. The fixed hemocytes were incubated with a monoclonal antibody at 1.0 μg/ml on ice for 30 min. After washing with PBS, the hemocytes were incubated with an Alexa FluorTM 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) at 20 μg/ml on ice for 30 min. After washing with PBS, fluorescence microscopy was done using an Olympus fluorescence microscope, model BX-FLA (Olympus Optical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Surface substances exposed on hemocytes were biotinylated using the water-soluble biotinylation reagent, sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide long chain biotin (Pierce). Briefly, hemolymph was collected into PBS in a sterilized plastic plate and allowed to stand for 30 min at 4 °C. Hemocytes that adhered to the plate were washed three times with PBS and then incubated with the biotinylation reagent (0.5 mg/ml) in PBS at 4 °C for 30 min with rocking. The biotinylation reaction was stopped by incubating with 100 mm glycine in PBS at 4 °C for 20 min. No morphological change of the hemocytes that adhered to the plate was observed microscopically after biotinylation. The hemocytes biotinylated were lysed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.15m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% Nonidet P-40 at 4 °C for 30 min with rocking. The cell lysate, 20 μl, was mixed with a monoclonal antibody (12.5 μg/ml) and incubated at 4 °C for 4 h. Protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) was then added and further incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. The resulting immunocomplex bound to protein A-Sepharose was collected by centrifugation and washed three times with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.5m NaCl. The pellet was subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the antigens were visualized by streptavidin-biotin-horseradish peroxidase. Protein samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes overnight at 20 V using an electroblot apparatus (Bio-Rad). The membrane was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, and the desired protein bands were excised (12LeGendre N. Matsudaira P.T. Matsudaira P.T. A Practical Guide to Protein and Peptide Purification for Microsequencing. Academic Press Inc., San Diego1989: 49-69Google Scholar). The proteins on the membrane were reduced, S-alkylated with iodoacetamide, and digested with Asp-N protease (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or chymotrypsin (Worthington) (enzyme/substrate = 1:100, w/w) in 30 mmNH4HCO3 containing 5 mmCaCl2 and 10% acetonitrile at 40 (for Asp-N protease) or 37 °C (for chymotrypsin) for 20 h. The resulting peptides were separated by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (rpHPLC) using a Cosmosil 5C18-MS column (2.0 × 150 mm, Nacalai Tesque, Inc., Kyoto, Japan). Peptides were eluted from the column with a linear gradient of 0–72% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for 120 min at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. The effluent was monitored at 210 nm. The degenerate nucleotide sequences of primers used for PCR were based on the amino acid sequences of the peptides derived from chymotrypsin digestion (HDHQHK and ENKPQD). Sense and antisense nucleotides were synthesized with an EcoRI site at the 5′ end. Reactions for PCR contained the cDNA template (corresponding to 0.1 μg of poly(A)+ RNA), and 100 pmol of each primer was carried out using a Takara PCR thermal cycler. The PCR products were treated with EcoRI and purified using agarose gel electrophoresis. Fragments of interest were then ligated into plasmid Bluescript II SK+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) for sequence analysis as described by Sambrook et al. (13Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). One clone that contained the protein sequence was used as a probe. A cDNA library prepared with the λ ZipLox system (Invitrogen) was screened by using the probe, as described previously (14Okino N. Kawabata S. Saito T. Hirata M. Takagi T. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31008-31015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli (15Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 277: 680-685Crossref Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. For immunoblotting, the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes overnight at 20 V using an electroblot apparatus. The membranes were then treated with the first antibody and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and visualized using an ECL kit, according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). Total RNA was extracted from various tissues of T. tridentatus according to Chomczynski and Sacchi (16Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). First-strand cDNA synthesis from 0.1 μg of poly(A)+ RNA was performed using SuperScriptTM II RNase H− reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random primers. One two-hundredth of the first strand of cDNA and 20 pmol of each primer were subjected to PCR (30 cycles) with denaturation at 94 °C for 45 s, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min 30 s. PCR products were analyzed on a 2% agarose gel and visualized following ethidium bromide staining. Freshly prepared hemocytes were lysed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1% Nonidet P-40 at 4 °C for 30 min, and the supernatant was obtained by centrifugation. The transglutaminase reaction of the supernatant was started by adding 10 mm CaCl2and 10 mm dithiothreitol in the presence or absence of 0.5 mm DCA and incubated at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by adding 100 mm EDTA. An aliquot of the reaction mixture was subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the fluorescence-labeled proteins were visualized by a trans-illuminator. HcTGase was partially purified as described (11Tokunaga F. Yamada M. Miyata T. Ding Y.L. Hiranaga-Kawabata M. Muta T. Iwanaga S. Ichinose A. Davie E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 252-261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. The freshly prepared hemocyte lysate was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EDTA. The dialyzed sample was applied to an SP-Sepharose FF column, followed by a DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B column. The transglutaminase activity of each fraction was detected by DCA incorporation into the 8.6-kDa protein. The partially purified HcTGase (13 μg/ml) was incubated with the hemocyte surface antigens (400 μg/ml) in the presence of 10 mm CaCl2 and 10 mm dithiothreitol at 37 °C for 1 h. An aliquot of the reaction mixture was subjected to SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Coagulogen (2 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.15 m NaCl) was incubated with trypsin (Worthington) at 37 °C for 1 h (enzyme/substrate = 1:250, w/w). The resulting coagulin gel was dissolved by 20-fold dilution with the same buffer to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml, and no clot formation was observed under these conditions. The purified hemocyte surface antigens (50 μg/ml) in 50 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, containing 10 mm CaCl2 and 10 mm dithiothreitol, were preincubated with coagulogen, coagulin, or 8.6-kDa protein (50 μg/ml) on ice for 20 min. Partially purified transglutaminase (7 μg/ml) was then added to the mixture and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. An aliquot of the reaction mixture was subjected to electrophoresis using 1% agarose gel, not polyacrylamide gel, under the same conditions of SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting. Microtiter plates were coated with 10 μg/ml coagulogen or coagulin in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.15 m NaCl, by incubating overnight at 4 °C. After washing with the same buffer, the plates were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin, and serial dilutions of samples were added, incubated at 37 °C for 2 h, and then washed. A monoclonal antibody was added and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and washed. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG was added and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The enzyme activity of horseradish peroxidase was detected witho-phenylenediamine at 490 nm, using a microplate reader, model 3550 (Bio-Rad). Hemolymph, 2 ml, was collected into the sterile tube, and the hemocytes were collected by centrifugation at 800 rpm (100 × g) at 4 °C for 5 min and washed twice with 10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.0, containing 0.5 m NaCl. Then the hemocytes were suspended in the same buffer containing 50 mmMgCl2 and various concentrations of LPS and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. HcTGase in the supernatant obtained by centrifugation at 800 rpm (100 × g) at 4 °C for 5 min was detected by ELISA, using polyclonal antibody against HcTGase and the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. To determine whether significant membrane damage of hemocytes occurred because of LPS, the activity of lactate dehydrogenase, a cytosolic enzyme, was measured by using a colorimetric cytotoxicity assay kit according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer (Oxford Biomedical Research, Inc., Oxford, MI). Amino acid analysis was analyzed by an AccQ-Tag system (Waters Associates, Milford, MA). Amino acid sequence analysis was carried out using an Applied Biosystems 491 protein sequencer. Protein concentrations for determining extinction coefficients of the cell surface antigens were calculated from the amino acid mass/A 280. An internal standard, norleucine, was added to the protein hydrolysates to allow for the collection of losses. Fifteen hybridomas producing monoclonal antibodies reacting with surface substances of the horseshoe crab hemocytes were selected by the two screening methods, ELISA and the flow cytometric analysis. Immunoblotting showed that all the monoclonal antibodies produced by these hybridomas reacted with the protein bands of apparent molecular masses of 90 and 120 kDa in the 1% SDS extract of hemocytes (data not shown). One of the hybridomas cloned by limiting dilution, named 6C1-1F, produced an antibody with the highest affinity to the antigens. Flow cytometric analysis confirmed that antibody 6C1-1F reacts with the antigens expressed on the surface of hemocytes (Fig. 1 A). The antigens on the hemocytes were visualized by a fluorescence-labeled second antibody, Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Fig. 1 B). On the other hand, the cell surface substances of hemocytes were biotinylated and then extracted by 1% SDS and subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by detection with streptavidin-biotinylated horseradish peroxidase. At least six protein bands were detected with apparent molecular masses ranging from 48 to 170 kDa (Fig.2, lane 1). The biotinylated cell surface proteins were immunoprecipitated by antibody 6C1-1F and subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by detection with streptavidin-biotinylated horseradish peroxidase (Fig. 2, lane 2). As a result, the proteins of 90 and 120 kDa were immunoprecipitated, indicating that antibody 6C1-1F recognizes the major hemocyte surface antigens, tentatively named band-90 and band-120. The hemocyte lysate (33.6 g wet weight) was fractionated with solid ammonium sulfate, and bands-90 and -120 were precipitated at the saturation of 30%. The precipitate was dissolved in 50 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, containing 8m urea and 1 mm EDTA, and applied to a Sepharose CL-6B column (3.5 × 90 cm) equilibrated with the same buffer (Fig. 3 A). Immunoblotting of every five tubes showed the presence of bands-90 and -120 in the fraction, as indicated by a solid bar. The pooled fraction was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, containing 0.03 m NaCl and 1 mm EDTA and applied to a DEAE-Sephacel column (2.5 × 10 cm) equilibrated with the same buffer. After washing with the equilibration buffer, the proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0.03–0.6 mNaCl in the same buffer (Fig. 3 B). Immunoblot analysis indicated that bands-90 and -120 were eluted in the flow-through fraction. Bands-90 and -120 could not be separated by these purification procedures (Fig. 3 C). The NH2-terminal sequence analysis of bands-90 and -120 transferred to a membrane proved to be identical at least up to 23 residues. The transferred proteins were digested with Asp-N protease or chymotrypsin, and their peptide mappings were done by rpHPLC. As far as they were examined, the peptide sequences derived from band-90 were identical to those from band-120, and the amino acid compositions of bands-90 and -120 were indistinguishable (TableI).

The NH2-terminal sequence of bands-90 and -120 showed significant sequence similarity with that of the 80-kDa protein previously identified in T. tridentatus hemocytes (11Tokunaga F. Yamada M. Miyata T. Ding Y.L. Hiranaga-Kawabata M. Muta T. Iwanaga S. Ichinose A. Davie E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 252-261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The partial NH2-terminal sequence reported for the 80-kDa protein (SVXTLQV) was identical to that of band-90 or band-120 (HVKTLQV), except for the NH2 terminus. The 80-kDa protein is a substrate for HcTGase that catalyzes the DCA incorporation into the 80-kDa protein in a Ca2+-dependent manner. To test whether DCA is incorporated into the surface antigens, the hemocytes lysate was incubated with DCA in the presence of CaCl2, and aliquots were subjected to SDS-PAGE at the indicated times. DCA incorporation into the several specific proteins was observed by UV illumination of the gel, and the proteins of 90- and 120-kDa were most reactive among these DCA-labeled ones (Fig.4 A). The incorporation reaction proceeded rapidly (<5 min), and it was completely inhibited by EDTA, indicating that the intrinsic HcTGase catalyzes the DCA incorporation. Furthermore, the 90- and 120-kDa proteins labeled with DCA were immunoprecipitated by antibody 6C1-1F (Fig. 4 B), indicating that bands-90 and -120 are substrates for HcTGase and function as amine acceptors. To test whether bands-90 and -120 are cross-linked with endogenous proteins, the freshly prepared hemocyte lysate was incubated in the presence of CaCl2, and aliquots were immunoprecipitated by antibody 6C1-1F and then subjected to immunoblotting. Two protein bands with apparent molecular masses of 140 and 200 kDa newly appeared after a 5-min incubation. These bands were not observed in the presence of EDTA (data not shown). Furthermore, the incubation of the purified bands-90 and -120 with HcTGase resulted in the cross-linked products of 140 and 200 kDa (data not shown). These results indicate that bands-90 and -120 are cross-linked intermolecularly by HcTGase. The final stage of the blood coagulation cascade in mammals (17Lorand L. Credo R.B. Janus T.J. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and the hemolymph coagulation reactions in crustaceans (18Kopacek P. Hall M. Söderhall K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 591-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) depends on the transglutaminase-mediated cross-linking of specific clotting proteins. However, HcTGase dose not cross-link a clottable protein coagulogen of the horseshoe crab (11Tokunaga F. Yamada M. Miyata T. Ding Y.L. Hiranaga-Kawabata M. Muta T. Iwanaga S. Ichinose A. Davie E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 252-261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Coagulogen is converted to an insoluble gel known as coagulin polymer through the proteolytic cascade triggered by LPS. HcTGase neither catalyzed DCA incorporation into coagulin nor cross-linked it intermolecularly (data not shown). Interestingly, HcTGase promoted cross-linking of coagulin with bands-90 and -120, resulting in the high molecular weight products located at the top of the gel by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis in the presence of SDS (data not shown). Coagulogen or 8.6-kDa protein, a previously identified substrate for HcTGase (11Tokunaga F. Yamada M. Miyata T. Ding Y.L. Hiranaga-Kawabata M. Muta T. Iwanaga S. Ichinose A. Davie E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 252-261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), did not result in the high molecular weight products cross-linked with bands-90 and -120 by HcTGase. In the absence of HcTGase bands-90 and -120 non-covalently bound to coagulin but not coagulogen-coated on microtiter plates, suggesting that bands-90 and -120 have specific binding affinity to coagulin (Fig.5). To determine whether HcTGase could be released from hemocytes in response to external stimuli, hemocytes were treated with LPS. HcTGase was released from hemocytes into the extracellular fluid in response to the stimulation by LPS, as detected by ELISA (data not shown). The lactate dehydrogenase activity in the extracellular fluid was not detectable under the same conditions. The specific probe of 0.45 kb was identified with oligonucleotide primers corresponding to peptides derived from band-90 or band-120, using PCR and DNA sequence analyses. Screening a hemocyte cDNA library with the probe gave two types of positive clones that code the full length of the protein sequences. They were subjected to restriction mappings followed by sequence determinations of both strands. One cDNA included an open reading frame of 874 nucleotides with a mature protein of 271 residues, and the other included an open reading frame of 926 nucleotides with a mature protein of 284 residues; the overall sequence identity between the two proteins was 66% (Fig. 6,A and B). The intriguing feature of these sequences was the presence of four tandem repeats with an extremely high content of proline, accounting for 18 and 20% of the total residues, respectively (Fig. 7). Therefore, we named them proxin-1 and proxin-2, respectively, after proline-rich proteins for protein cross-linking. There were glutamine-rich regions containing Gln-Gln dipeptides at the NH2-terminal regions of proxins-1 and -2 and the COOH-terminal region of proxin-1.Figure 7Sequence comparisons of proxins-1 and -2. Alignment of the amino acid sequence of proxins-1 and -2. Amino acid residues repeated more than three times in the tandem repeats are shown in boldface letters. All glutamine residues are crowned with dots.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The calculated molecular weights from the deduced sequences of proxins-1 and -2 were 30,899 and 31,890, respectively. Peptide fragments corresponding to only proxin-1 or proxin-2 were obtained from the proteolytic digest of band-90 and from that of band-120 by rpHPLC, indicating that not only band-90 but also band-120 contains both proxins-1 and -2. Several peptide fragments were isolated with low yields, and their sequences were homologous but not identical to those of proxins-1 and -2, indicating the presence of an unidentified isoprotein(s) for the proxins. The proxins did not have putative transmembrane domains or glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor sites in their sequences (19Cross G.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting with antibody 6C1-1F detected the proxins only in hemocytes but not in other tissues, including heart, skeletal muscle, hepatopancreas, and stomach (Fig. 8 A). Furthermore, reverse transcription PCR showed that the cDNA fragments corresponding to proxins were highly amplified only in hemocytes but not in other tissues, thus indicating the specific expression of proxins in hemocytes (Fig. 8 B). In mammals, the coagulation system is based on the proteolytically induced aggregation of fibrinogen into insoluble fibrin (20Doolittle R.F. Putnam F.W. 2nd Ed. The Plasma Proteins. 10. Academic Press, San Diego1984: 421-544Google Scholar, 21Furie B. Furie B.C. Cell. 1988; 53: 505-518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar, 22Daivie E.W. Fujikawa K. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10363-10370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar). Initially, fibrins are non-covalently associated and are further stabilized through the intermolecular cross-linking of ε-(γ-glutamyl)lysine bonds by the plasma transglutaminase. On the other hand, in crustaceans, hemolymph coagulation depends on the transglutaminase-mediated cross-linking of a specific plasma-clotting protein without the proteolytic cascade (18Kopacek P. Hall M. Söderhall K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 591-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 23Doolittle R.F. Riley M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 167: 16-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In the horseshoe crab, the coagulation cascade, whose components have structural similarity to those of the morphogenetic cascade for determining embryonic dorsal-ventral polarity in Drosophila, is activated by LPS or β-1,3-glucans, leading to the conversion of a soluble coagulogen into an insoluble coagulin gel (5Iwanaga S. Kawabata S. Muta T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 6Iwanaga S. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). No transglutaminase activity has been found in horseshoe crab plasma. However, the clots of whole blood yielded significant amounts of ε-(γ-glutamyl)lysine products, suggesting the activity of transglutaminase released from the hemocytes during coagulation (24Wilson J. Rickles F.R. Armstrong P.B. Lorand L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). We identified here the proline-rich surface antigens of the horseshoe crab hemocytes, named proxins, that function as substrates for protein cross-linking with clotting protein coagulin. These results clearly indicate that the horseshoe crab also uses the protein cross-linking reaction at the final stage of the coagulation system as an important host defense system. The apparent molecular masses of proxins on SDS-PAGE are definitively higher than those deduced from the cDNA sequences. Proxins-1 and -2 contained small amounts of galactosamine and no glucosamine in hydrolysates of bands-90 and -120 by amino acid analysis (Table I). Therefore, the glycosylation may not explain the big difference between the molecular weights of proxins estimated by the sequence and those estimated by SDS-PAGE. Bands-90 and -120 may consist of cross-linked oligomers of proxins-1 and -2. In mammals, proline-rich proteins such as cornifins and small proline-rich proteins are involved in the formation of the cornified cell envelope, a highly insoluble structure at the cell periphery of the stratum corneum (25Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17702-17711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 26Robinson N.A. Lapic S. Welter J.F. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12035-12046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The stratum corneum of the skin serves as a forefront physical barrier for invading pathogens. The envelope is composed of multiple membrane-associated and cytosolic proteins, including members of the cornifin/small proline-rich protein family and various other proteins. These proteins are cross-linked into an insoluble mesh by the keratinocyte transglutaminase, a membrane-bound enzyme. Cornifins have no significant sequence similarity to proxins, but cornifins also consist of an NH2-terminal glutamine-rich portion and proline-containing tandem repeats of octa- or nonapeptides (27Austin S.J. Fujimoto W. Marvin K.W. Vollberg T.M. Lorand L. Jetten A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3737-3742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Cornifins function as amine acceptors through glutamine residues of the NH2-terminal portion. The similar glutamine cluster is also present at the NH2-terminal regions of proxins-1 and -2 and the COOH-terminal region of proxin-1 (Fig. 7). Possibly, these glutamine residues of proxins function as amine acceptors. HcTGase cross-linked proxins with coagulin but did not catalyze DCA incorporated into coagulin. Therefore, glutamine residues functioning as amine acceptors are not present on coagulin, but several lysine residues on coagulin function as amine donors for protein cross-linking with proxins. The three-dimensional structural and protein chemical studies of coagulogen suggest a possible polymerization mechanism in which the release of the helical peptide C of coagulogen would expose a hydrophobic cove on the head, which interacts with the hydrophobic tail of a second molecule, resulting in the formation of coagulin gel (28Kawasaki H.

Iwanaga S. Typke D. Huber R. Bode W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6789-6797Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A hypothetical scheme of the cross-linked coagulin polymer is shown in Fig. 9. Furthermore, coagulin fibers tend to aggregate laterally to form a thicker fiber, probably through other hydrophobic patches on the coagulin surface, resulting in the formation of a reticulate (29Bergner A. Oganessyan V. Muta T. Iwanaga S. Typke D. Huber R. Bode W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6789-6797Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Proxins may participate in forming the stable reticulate structure, a casting net, and an important physical barrier for invading microbes. We thank W. Kamada, M. Hiranga-Kawabata, and N.

It is a highly efficient inhibitor of neutrophil granule proteases. Four murine genes with high sequence identity with MNEI were identified and fully sequenced, and these were named EIA, EIB, EIC, and EID. EIA, EIB and EIC showed the same seven-exon gene structure asSERPINB1. However, EIC included an additional, alternatively spliced, exon due to the insertion of an endogenous retrovirus-like sequence. EID lacked several exons and is a pseudogene. Reverse transcriptase-PCR showed that EIA, like MNEI, is expressed at high levels in many tissues. EIB is mainly expressed in brain, and EIC was only expressed as splicing variants unlikely to encode a functional serpin. Upon incubation with serine proteases, EIA formed inhibitory covalent complexes with pancreatic and neutrophil elastases, cathepsin G, proteinase-3, and chymotrypsin, as previously shown for MNEI, whereas EIB was only able to do so with cathepsin G. According to the new serpin nomenclature, the genes encoding EIA, EIB, EIC, and EID will be called Serpinb1,Serpinb1b, Serpinb1c, andSerpinb1-ps1.

Serpins regulate important intracellular and extracellular proteolytic events, including apoptosis, complement activation, fibrinolysis, and blood coagulation (1Potempa J. Korzus E. Travis J. J.

Serpins inhibit proteases by a suicide substrate inhibition mechanism, whereby the protease reactive center interacts with a bait cleavage site between the P1 and P1′ residues of the reactive center loop of the serpin (3Patston P.A. Gettins P. Beechem J. Schapira M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8876-8882Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The two molecules form a 1:1 stoichiometric intermediate, which is stabilized into a covalent inhibitory complex. Fluorescence energy transfer experiments have shown that the stable inhibitory complex involves full insertion of the cleaved proximal reactive center loop (RCL)1 of the serpin into β-sheet A of the molecule, which results in the pole to pole displacement of the protease (4Stratikos E. Gettins P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4808-4813Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 5Stratikos E. Gettins P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The recent, and long awaited, crystal structure of a covalent serpin-protease inhibitory complex has shed light on the mechanism of inhibition of serpins (6Huntington J.A. Read R.J. Carrell R.W. Nature. 2000; 407: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). The full insertion of the RCL results in a hyperstable serpin molecule and leads to the distortion of the protease by pulling away the reactive serine from its catalytic partners. This mechanism of inhibition by distortion is dependent on the length of the RCL (6Huntington J.A. Read R.J. Carrell R.W. Nature. 2000; 407: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar, 7Zhou A. Carrell R.W. Huntington J.A. J. Biol.

Genome Res. 2000; 10: 1845-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar), human serpins have been classified in nine clades. Clade B, also called ov-serpins (ovalbumin-related serpins), is the second largest clade in humans with 13 members identified so far. OV-serpins share a high degree of sequence identity and conserved exon-intron patterns. They differ from other serpin clades by the lack of N- and C-terminal extensions, the lack of a cleavable hydrophobic signal sequence for secretion and the presence of other signature sequence motifs (9Remold-O'Donnell E. FEBS Lett. 1993; 315: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Recent studies of exon-intron structures indicate that serpins are likely to have evolved by massive intron insertion and show that ov-serpins form an evolutionary distinct clade (10Atchley W.R. Lokot T. Wollenberg K. Dress A. Ragg H. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2001; 18: 1502-1511Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 11Ragg H. Lokot T. Kamp P.B. Atchley W.R. Dress A. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2001; 18: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in contrast to other serpin clades, ov-serpins lack signal sequences for secretion and are found in the cytoplasm (9Remold-O'Donnell E. FEBS Lett. 1993; 315: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) and, to a lesser extent, on the cell surface (12Sheng S. Carey J. Seftor E.A. Dias L. Hendrix M.J. Sager R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11669-11674Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) and in the nucleus (13Bird C.H. Blink E.J. Hirst C.E. Buzza M.S. Steele P.M. Sun J. Jans D.A. Bird P.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5396-5407Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Human ov-serpin genes are clustered in two loci, 6p25 and 18q21, and fall into two subgroups based on the number of exons (14Scott F.L. Hirst C.E. Sun J. Bird C.H. Bottomley S.P. Bird P.I. Blood. 1999; 93: 2089-2097Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The eight-exon ov-serpins are only found on chromosome 18, whereas the seven-exon ov-serpins are found on both loci. The seven-exon ov-serpin, human monocyte neutrophil elastase inhibitor (MNEI, SERPINB1), is one of the most efficient inhibitor of the neutrophil granule proteases, which include neutrophil elastase, proteinase-3 (PR3), and cathepsin G (CatG) (15Remold-O'Donnell E.

Nature. 2002; 416: 291-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar), but, conversely, an excessive release of neutrophil proteases in the extracellular milieu induces tissue damage (19Birrer P. Respiration. 1995; 62 Suppl. 1: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and impairs the clearance of apoptotic cells in chronic inflammatory diseases (20Vandivier R.W. Fadok V.A. Hoffmann P.R. Bratton D.L. Penvari C. Brown K.K. Brain J.D. Accurso F.J. Henson P.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 661-670Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In an animal model of chronic lung inflammation, aerosolized recombinant human MNEI reduced the severity and the extent of the elastase-induced tissue damage (21Rees D.D. Rogers R.A. Cooley J. Mandle R.J. Kenney D.M. Remold-O'Donnell E. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 20: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The sustained activity of MNEI after instillation supports its potential use as a therapeutic for inflammatory pulmonary diseases driven by excess of neutrophil-derived proteases, such as cystic fibrosis and chronic pulmonary disease. To better understand the biological role of MNEI, we describe here the cDNA cloning, the gene structure, and biological characterization of the putative murine ortholog of MNEI together with three paralogs. Using human MNEI cDNA sequence, mouse dbEST data base was searched with BLAST (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/), and matches were further analyzed using DNAStar software for PC (DNAStar Inc., Madison, WI). Selected clones with high homology were obtained from the I.M.A.G.E. Consortium (22Lennon G. Auffray C. Polymeropoulos M. Soares M.B. Genomics. 1996; 33: 151-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar) and sequenced. Based on the cDNA sequence of EIA (AF426024) and the gene structure of MNEI (SERPINB1), two 32P-labeled probes in the exon 7 coding region and 3′-untranslated region were generated as described previously (23Zeng W. Silverman G.A. Remold-O'Donnell E. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 213: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Mouse genomic DNA was digested with restriction enzymes, separated on 0.8% agarose gels, and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were hybridized, washed, and autoradiographed as described previously (23Zeng W. Silverman G.A. Remold-O'Donnell E. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 213: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). A genomic lambda phage library from 129/SvJ mice, a generous gift from Dr. Michael Carroll (Center for Blood Research, Boston, MA), was screened with a32P-labeled EIA exon 7 probe. Lambda clone #1 containing EIA was digested with SacI, and lambda clone #3 containing EIB was digested with BamHI. Fragments were subcloned in pBluescript (Stratagene) and sequenced. The sequence data of EIA and EIB from these subclones were fragmentary, and mouse PAC clones from library RPCI21, constructed using female 129/SvevTACfBr mouse genomic spleen, were screened with EIA- and EIB-specific primers. PAC clone 507G8 was shown to contain EIA and two apparent paralogs, EIC and EID. PAC clone 672N8 contained EIB. Introns were cloned from PAC 507G8, using primers based on cDNA or genomic sequences from CeleraTM or GenBankTM databases. All PCR fragments were amplified with Turbo Pfu polymerase (Stratagene), cloned in pSTBlue-1 or pT7Blue-2 (Novagen), and sequenced in both directions using an “oligonucleotide walk” strategy at the Molecular Biology Core Facilities of the Dana Farber Cancer Institute (Boston, MA). These PCR fragments were designed to overlap widely within exons to build the contig without ambiguity on the origin of the fragments. Mouse brain, heart, liver, lung, spleen, testis total RNA, and bone marrow and pancreas mRNA were obtained from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). Five micrograms of total RNA or 1 μg of mRNA were reverse-transcribed in a 40-μl reaction using Superscript II and oligo(dT) primers (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Identical control reactions were performed without reverse transcriptase to rule out genomic DNA contamination. mRNA expression levels of the “housekeeping” gene β-actin were also assayed using primers described previously (24Bartuski A.J.

The complete cDNA coding sequences of EIA (AF426024) and EIB (AF426025) were subcloned into pET17b (Novagen). The proteins were synthesized byin vitro transcription and translation in the presence of [35S]methionine for 2 h at 37 °C using anEscherichia coli T7 S30 extract system for circular DNA (Promega). Human neutrophil elastase (hNE), and porcine pancreatic elastase (pPE) were from Elastin Products (Owensville, MO); cathepsin G (hCatG) and proteinase-3 (hPR3) from human neutrophils were from Athens Research and Technology (Athens, GA); bovine chymotrypsin (bChy) was from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). They were stored in 1 mg/ml aliquots at −20 °C. Purified recombinant murine granzyme B (mGrzB) (26Xia Z. Kam C.M. Huang C. Powers J.C. Mandle R.J. Stevens R.L. Lieberman J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 384-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) was a generous gift from Dr. Judy Lieberman (Center for Blood Research, Boston, MA) and was kept in 0.5 mg/ml aliquots at −20 °C. The ability of recombinant EIA and EIB to form inhibitory complexes with proteases was assessed by incubating 2.5 μl of the in vitro translation reaction with different concentrations of proteases in a final volume of 20 μl phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4). All the reactions were prepared on ice and incubated for 5 min at 37 °C. Where indicated, EIB was incubated with proteases for up to 30 min. Samples were chilled on ice and acetone-precipitated. Pellets were resuspended in 1× NuPAGE LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen), boiled for 3 min, loaded onto 10% Bis-Tris NuPAGE gels, and separated under reducing conditions in MES buffer. 35S-Labeled proteins were detected in dried gels by phosphorimaging (Storm 860 PhosphorImager, Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) and analyzed using the ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). In preliminary screening of the dbEST data base, fourteen murine submissions with high homology to human MNEI (SERPINB1) were identified using a BLASTn search. Sequencing of selected clones revealed one full-length clone (I.M.A.G.E. Consortium CloneID 63727). The thirteen partial clones were 97–100% identical to the full-length clone, strongly indicating that all are products of the same gene, which was named EIA. However, Southern blot analysis of digested genomic DNA using two EIA probes in exon 7 coding and non-coding regions revealed three bands, indicating the presence of three or more homologous genes in the mouse genome (Fig. 1). Four genes with homology with SERPINB1 were fully sequenced as follows. Mouse genomic DNA lambda clones containing EIA and a homologous gene, EIB, were isolated after screening with a32P-labeled EIA exon 7 probe and sequencing PCR products with primers based on exon 7 sequence. The sequencing data obtained from SacI subclones of lambda clone #1 containing EIA and from BamHI subclones of lambda clone #3, containing EIB, provided the sequence from exon 5 to 7 and several kilobases of 3′-flanking region of both genes. Using a PAC DNA library and primers based on cDNA sequence of exons, the sequence for EIA and EIB introns were obtained from PAC clones 507G8 and 672N8, respectively. Amplification from exon 4 to 5 of EIA using low stringency conditions produced two additional fragments with a small difference in size. Sequencing identified these as fragments of two new genes, EIC and EID. EIC gene was fully sequenced from exon 1 to 7 from PAC 507G8 using primers based on cDNA sequences obtained from RT-PCR studies (see below). EID putative exons were identified by searching the Celera data base with exon sequences of the other mouse EI genes. EID was sequenced using primers designed on genomic DNA sequences of putative exons 2, 4, 5, and 6 from BLAST searches of the Celera data base using EIA and EIC exon sequences. The structure of human MNEI and the four murine homologs is shown in Fig. 2. The complete sequencing of the four identified mouse genes showed both conserved and different features compared with human MNEI gene,SERPINB1 (Fig. 2). EIA and EIB had a similar seven-exon structure with exon size and codon phasing identical to those of human MNEI. The introns sizes were also similar. EIC shared these features and only differed in that an unusually large (∼8.0kb) intron II was present, when compared with other ov-serpin genes. The sequence analysis of this intron revealed that this was due to the insertion of a murine endogenous retrovirus-like (MuERV-L) element of ∼6.5 kb widely found in the murine genome (27Benit L., De Parseval N. Casella J.F. Callebaut I. Cordonnier A. Heidmann T. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 5652-5657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Benit L. Lallemand J.B. Casella J.F. Philippe H. Heidmann T. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3301-3308Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In RT-PCR analysis (see below), it appeared that this large intron includes an alternatively spliced exon 2b, which contains a premature stop codon. Although EID contains structural similarities with MNEI, no putative exon 3 or exon 7 were found in the Celera data base nor in the sequenced PAC 507G8 fragment amplified from exon 2 to 4. Moreover, exons 2 and 5 contain several stop codons, and both exons induce a codon phase shift, because they are one base pair longer or shorter than the consensus, respectively. The base pair identity score of the overlapping cDNA coding sequences for the four murine genes is 85–89% when compared with each other and 74–79% when compared with MNEI, with EIA being the closest to MNEI. Due to the high level of sequence identity between the four mouse EI genes, the specificity of each reaction was confirmed in control PCRs with cloned cDNA templates of EIA, EIB, and EIC and cloned genomic template of EID. EIA mRNA was expressed in all tissues investigated, and the signals were comparable to those of β-actin, except in bone marrow, spleen, and pancreas, where EIA mRNA expression was higher than that of β-actin, and in heart and liver where a lower expression level was observed (Fig.3 A). EIB signal was comparable to that of EIA in brain, but the signal was one to two orders of magnitude lower in lung, spleen, and testis, and no amplification was seen in the other tissues. Interestingly, EIC was only detectable in heart, but the product (∼830 bp) was smaller than expected (972 bp, from exon 2 to 7). EID could not be amplified from any tissue. To characterize the EIC PCR product, a second round of PCR was performed with the same primer pair (exons 2 and 7). Four products were sequenced, and all arose from EIC by alternative splicing (Fig.3 B). Two of these variants contained premature stop codons (indicated by asterisks in Fig. 3 B). The two other variants lacked the endogenous retrovirus exon 2b as well as exons 4 and 5 or exon 5 and 64 bp of exon 6. If these messages are translated into proteins, they are unlikely to be functional serpins because they all lack exon 5, which encodes for strand 3 of β-sheet A, a critical structure for the correct insertion of the RCL. A further degree of complexity into EIC structure was added with the sequencing results of 5′-RACE. Several fragments were cloned and sequenced after two rounds of PCR using nested primers specific for exon 3 of EIC. One product contained sequences of exons 1, 2, and 3 of EIC but not exon 2b. Interestingly, another product contained exon 3 of EIC preceded by 555 bp with high homology with another murine ov-serpin, R86, found in the same locus on chromosome 13 (29). Analysis of the Celera genomic data base revealed a gene remnant that mapped ∼40 kb upstream of EIC and consisted only of exons 1 and 2; it was named R86B. To rule out a cloning artifact during 5′-RACE, the expression of the R86B/EIC chimeric mRNA was re-examined by RT-PCR using a R86B-specific exon 2 forward primer together with the same reverse primer in exon 7 of EIC. The expression level and tissue pattern was identical to that of EIC (Fig. 3 A). Furthermore, the R86B/EIC band was also smaller than expected corresponding to a splicing product unlikely to produce a functional serpin. The amino acid sequence and the length of the RCL are critical in defining the target range and the efficency of the inhibitory function of serpins. Fig. 4 shows an alignment of EIA, EIB, and EIC RCL with MNEI and other relevant human and murine serpins. EIA and MNEI show a strikingly conserved RCL length and sequence with identical putative P1 and P1′ residues. It is predictable that MNEI and EIA share protease targets, whereas EIB would target a different range of enzymes. EIC, however, has two residues (Thr and Asp) in the hinge region, which are likely to interfere with a correct insertion of the RCL into β-sheet A. To verify their predicted function, EIA and EIB were produced in vitro with 35S-label and allowed to form stable covalent complexes with several proteases (Fig.5). EIC and EID were not tested because no full-length EIC cDNA could be identified and EID lacks exon 7, which contains the RCL. EIA formed SDS-stable complexes with human neutrophil elastase, porcine pancreatic elastase, human cathepsin G, bovine chymotrypsin, and human proteinase-3 but not with granzyme B (Fig. 5 A). When tested in parallel with the same proteases, EIB could only form a stable complex with cathepsin G but at a lesser efficiency than EIA (not shown). To make the case clearer, EIB was incubated for up to 30 min with hCatG or hNE, and the total amount of protein electrophoretically separated was doubled (Fig.5 B).Figure 5EIA and EIB form stable inhibitory complexes with different sets of serine proteases. A,35S-labeled EIA, generated by in vitrotranscription/translation, was incubated (in 20 μl) at 37 °C for 5 min with the indicated amounts of neutrophil elastase (hNE), pancreatic elastase (pPE), cathepsin G (hCatG), chymotrypsin (bChy), proteinase-3 (hPR3), and granzyme B (mGrzB). Phosphorimages are shown. Native EIA is indicated by filled arrowheads to the left ofeach panel. Inhibitory complexes (cpx) are indicated by open arrowheads on the right ofeach panel. Note that EIA forms inhibitory complexes with hNE, pPE, hCatG, bChy, and hPR3. In these conditions, EIB forms complexes with hCatG only and is proteolytically degraded by hNE, pPE, bChy, hPR3, but not mGrzB (not shown). B,35S-labeled EIB was incubated at 37 °C for the indicated time with 200 ng of hCatG or hNE. Note that EIB forms stable complexes with hCatG, whereas it is degraded by increasing concentrations of hNE without formation of complex, indicating that EIB is a substrate for this protease.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The length and the sequence of the reactive center loop are critical for the inhibitory activity of serpins (6Huntington J.A.

MNEI and EIA share the same Cys-Met residues at position P1–P1′, and the lengths of the RCL are identical. Complex formation assays confirmed that EIA and MNEI share the same target proteases, because EIA formed stable complexes with the three neutrophil granule proteases, elastase, cathepsin G, and proteinase-3, and with pancreatic elastase and chymotrypsin. Furthermore, MNEI and EIA are both expressed in a wide range of tissues with the highest levels of expression in bone marrow, spleen, and pancreas. Interestingly, these tissues contain cells that constitutively produce large amounts of elastase and other target proteases, indicating that the presence of these serpins may protect against unwanted protease leakage, as previously proposed (14Scott F.L. Hirst C.E. Sun J. Bird C.H. Bottomley S.P. Bird P.I. Blood. 1999; 93: 2089-2097Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Sugimori T. Cooley J. Hoidal J.R. Remold-O'Donnell E. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1995; 13: 314-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The constitutive tissue expression of MNEI and EIA in many human and mouse tissues indicates that these molecules may also limit the tissue-damaging effects of neutrophil proteases in inflammatory processes. This view is supported by the protective effects of instilled recombinant human MNEI on elastase-induced pulmonary injury in rats (21Rees D.D. Rogers R.A. Cooley J. Mandle R.J. Kenney D.M. Remold-O'Donnell E. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 20: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This strongly supports the development of inhaled recombinant MNEI as a potential aerosol treatment for inflammatory lung diseases, including cystic fibrosis. However, although extracellular MNEI was shown to be a strong inhibitor of neutrophil elastase, the mechanism of release of MNEI from the cytosol to the extracellular milieu remains to be demonstrated and may involve an alternative secretion pathway, because ov-serpins lack signal peptide for secretion. Furthermore, PI-6, a closely related serpin, failed to be secreted from activated and unactivated platelets and various cultured cell lines (30Scott F.L. Coughlin P.B. Bird C. Cerruti L. Hayman J.A. Bird P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1605-1612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It was also shown that overexpression and the addition of an N-terminal signal peptide did not result in secretion of the protein. Therefore, it is also possible that the ubiquitous expression of MNEI in humans and EIA in mouse is required for the inhibition of other proteases with a wider expression pattern than neutrophil proteases or pancreatic elastase. We recently showed that MNEI inhibits mast cell chymase, chymotrypsin, and prostate-specific antigen but not granzymes, trypsin-like serine proteases, or cysteine and metalloprotease family members (31Cooley J. Takayama T.K. Shapiro S.D. Schechter N.M. Remold-O'Donnell E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15762-15770Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The role of MNEI and EIA at inhibiting proteases with chymotrypsin-like specificity in vivo may provide further understanding of the conserved wide tissue range of expression in these species. MNEI is the product of a single gene (SERPINB1), which is located on chromosome 6p25 (32Evans E. Cooley J. Remold-O'Donnell E. Genomics. 1995; 28: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) together with two other seven-exon ov-serpins, PI-6 (SERPINB6) and PI-9 (SERPINB9) (33Sun J. Stephens R. Mirza G. Kanai H. Ragoussis J. Bird P.I. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1998; 82: 273-277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a recent mapping study, we have shown that the four murine MNEI homologs are located on chromosome 13 together with PI-6- and PI-9-related genes, in a region syntenic to human 6p25 (29Kaiserman D. Knaggs S. Scarff K.L. Gillard A. Mirza G. Cadman M. McKeone R. Denny P. Cooley J. Benarafa C. Remold-O'Donnell E. Ragoussis J. Bird P.I. Genomics. 2002; 79: 349-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The analysis of the mouse locus shows that it is likely that the common ancestor locus contained three genes corresponding to MNEI, PI-6, and PI-9, and that the murine gene repertoire expansion occurred after the two species diverged (29Kaiserman D. Knaggs S. Scarff K.L. Gillard A. Mirza G. Cadman M. McKeone R. Denny P. Cooley J. Benarafa C. Remold-O'Donnell E. Ragoussis J. Bird P.I. Genomics. 2002; 79: 349-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is supported by the presence of several pseudogenes and remnants in the mouse locus, whereas none have been identified in the human locus. If EIA is functionally similar to MNEI, what is the role of the three other paralogs? The gene and predicted protein structures of EIB indicate that it is a biologically active serpin. This was confirmed by its ability to form stable inhibitory complexes with cathepsin G, a protease with chymotrypsin-like specificity. However, EIB failed to inhibit elastase-like proteases, which was predicted by the great divergence of its RCL. Moreover, EIB is proteolytically degraded by elastases, proteinase-3, and chymotrypsin. EIB also differs from MNEI in that it has a lower level and restricted tissue range of mRNA expression. This demonstrates that EIB does not duplicate the activity of EIA. The sequencing data show that EIC has the same gene structure as EIA and EIB with identical exon sizes and similar intron size, except that the insertion of a full-length MuERV-L element into what once was intron II has modified this region of the gene leading to the transcription of the alternatively spliced exon 2b (Figs. 2 and3 B). The insertion of such sequences within genes has been shown to induce alternative splicing events involving the long terminal repeat (LTR) region of the endogenous retrovirus (34Seperack P.K. Mercer J.A. Strobel M.C. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2326-2332Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 35Kapitonov V.V. Jurka J. J. Mol.

In contrast, exon 2b of EIC corresponds to the antisense strand of the protease region of the pol gene. The pol gene, unlike the LTR, has no polyadenylation signal and therefore allows the transcription to carry on to the downstream exons of EIC. The mechanisms that produce the atypical splicing events involving exons 4, 5, and 6 of EIC as well as the intergenic variants of R86B/EIC are unclear because the exon/intron junctions are conserved. In any case, the cDNA sequences show that it is unlikely that any of the EIC splicing variants would translate into a biologically active serpin. Furthermore, the presence of polar and charged residues in the proximal hinge region of the RCL are unfavorable for serpin inhibitory activity. The second and fourth splicing variants described in Fig. 3 Bmay produce proteins with yet unknown functions. Evolutionarily interesting splicing variants have been described in insect serpins where the exon containing the RCL is present in twelve alternative forms, which are mutually exclusive, offering a powerful way of expanding the target repertoire (37Jiang H. Wang Y. Kanost M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 55-58Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Jiang H. Wang Y. Huang Y. Mulnix A.B. Kadel J. Cole K. Kanost M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28017-28023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Alternative splicing was also observed in human ov-serpins, squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCCA) 1 and 2 (SERPINB3 and 4) and hurpin (SERPINB13), but their biological relevance remains unclear (39Abts H.F. Welss T. Scheuring S. Scott F.L. Irving J.A. Michel G. Bird P.I. Ruzicka T. DNA Cell Biol. 2001; 20: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 40Suminami Y. Kishi F. Murakami A. Sakaguchi Y. Nawata S. Numa F. Kato H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1519: 122-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Similarly to EIC, mRNA splicing variants containing the first two exons of R86B and the downstream exons of EIC are unlikely to be functional serpins. However, the possibility that such chimeric proteins may be produced indicates that the repertoire of serpins may be even larger than that predicted by the number of genes. EID lacks important features of an active serpin at the genomic level, and no mRNA transcript has been detected in any tissue: it is clearly a pseudogene. The absence of exon 7 in EID resolves the discrepancy between the Southern blot analysis and the number of genes, because the screening was done using exon 7 probes (Fig. 1). Moreover, the restriction map of the fully sequenced mouse genes (not shown) is consistent with the size of the bands observed in Fig. 1, indicating that it is unlikely that another gene with homology with MNEI and with a functional RCL (encoded in exon 7) is present in the mouse genome. The four murine ov-serpins described here are homologous to human MNEI (SERPINB1) but have met different evolutionary fates. According to the new serpin nomenclature guidelines (2Silverman G.A. Bird P.I. Carrell R.W. Church F.C. Coughlin P.B. Gettins P.G. Irving J.A. Lomas D.A. Luke C.J. Moyer R.W. Pemberton P.A. Remold-O'Donnell E. Salvesen G.S. Travis J. Whisstock J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33293-33296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar), the genes encoding EIA, EIB, and EIC will be called Serpinb1,Serpinb1b, and Serpinb1c, respectively. Because it is a pseudogene, EID will be called Serpinb1-ps1. Similarly, R86B is a pseudogene showing sequence homology with PI-9 and will therefore be called Serpinb9-ps2. We can conclude that, based on mRNA expression pattern and protease targets, EIA is the functional murine counterpart of MNEI and that, based on genomic mapping and sequence homology, it is likely that EIA is the mouse ortholog of MNEI. The phenotype of mice lacking EIA (Serpinb1) will provide interesting insight on the role of MNEI in regulating the activity of granule proteases against pathogens and in inflammatory diseases.

We hypothesized that α-helix D is the site II of the cytokine that binds IL13Rα1, a component of the normal tissue heterodimeric signaling IL13/4 receptor (IL13/4R), and that α-helix D independently binds a monomeric IL13Rα2 receptor, which is a non-signaling glioma-restricted receptor for IL13. Therefore, we alanine-scanned mutagenized helix D of IL13 to identify the residues involved in the respective receptors interaction. Recombinant muteins of IL13 were produced in Escherichia coli, and their structural integrity and identity were verified. The alanine mutants were tested in functional cellular assays, in which IL13 interaction with IL13Rα2 (glioma cells) or an ability to functionally stimulate IL13/4R (TF-1 cells) were examined, and also in binding assays.

We had found that malignant glioma cells express restricted, IL4-independent, intermediate to high affinity binding sites for IL13, the feature resembled by IL13Rα2 receptor (11Debinski W. Gibo D.M. Mol. Med. 2000; 6: 440-449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Debinski W. Obiri N.I. Powers S.K. Pastan I. Puri R.K. Clin. Cancer Res. 1995; 1: 1253-1258PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, we have recently identified IL13Rα2 as this glioma-restricted receptor (13Mintz A. Gibo D.M. Becky S.W. Christensen N.D. Debinski W. Neoplasia. 2002; 4: 388-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Thus, there are two types of IL13 receptors: (a) one present on normal cells and shared with IL4, IL13/4R and (b) one that is more restricted, in that it does not bind IL4 and is expressed primarily in malignancy, IL13Rα2 (13Mintz A. Gibo D.M. Becky S.W. Christensen N.D. Debinski W. Neoplasia. 2002; 4: 388-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Consequently, our research effort has been to design a form of IL13, which would have preserved more affinity toward glioma-associated receptor, IL13Rα2, than toward IL13/4 receptor to specifically and effectively target brain tumors. Our earlier rational mutational studies of IL13 revealed several mutants in A, C, and D helices with altered reactivity toward the IL13/4 receptor (14Debinski W. Gibo D.M. Obiri N.I. Kealiher A. Puri R.K. Nat. Biotech. 1998; 16: 449-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 15Debinski W. Thompson J.P. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 3143-3147PubMed Google Scholar, 16Thompson J.P. Debinski W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29944-29950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). For example, we documented the importance of glutamic acid in positions 13 and 16 in helix A in cellular activation through IL13/4R. Moreover, our results initially suggested potential importance of arginine at position 109 in α-helix D, because its mutation to aspartic acid impaired an ability of IL13 to bind to the IL13/4R as well as to glioma-associated receptor (16Thompson J.P. Debinski W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29944-29950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We have also demonstrated that arginine and serine at positions 66 and 69 in helix C, respectively, were important for inducing biological signaling, because their mutation to aspartic acid resulted in reduced signaling through IL13/4R. In other words, our studies revealed site I composed of regions within α-helix A and C, which is most likely responsible for the binding of IL13 to IL4Rα of the IL13/4 receptor (17Debinski W. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1998; 9: 255-268PubMed Google Scholar). Our earlier observations led us to hypothesize that the site II in IL13, which is responsible for the binding to IL13Rα2, is located at the C-terminal region of IL13 molecule in the α-helix D (17Debinski W. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1998; 9: 255-268PubMed Google Scholar). The recently documented solution structure of IL13 is very much in line with this hypothesis (5Moy F.J. Diblasio E. Wilhelm J. Powers R. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 219-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 18Eisenmesser E.Z. Horita D.A. Alteiri A.S. Byrd R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These facts prompted us to examine in more detail α-helix D of IL13, which we believed interacts non-concomitantly with both glioma-associated receptor IL13Rα2 and/or a segment of IL13/4R, IL13Rα1 (5Moy F.J. Diblasio E. Wilhelm J. Powers R. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 219-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 14Debinski W. Gibo D.M. Obiri N.I. Kealiher A. Puri R.K. Nat.

In the present study, alanine-scanning mutagenesis was carried out for the entire α-helix D, and the functional properties of the resulting alanine mutants were investigated. We determined new positions in helix D that are important for interacting with either of the IL13 receptors. This new knowledge should prove useful in designing novel IL13 agonists and/or antagonists for the treatment of brain tumors or other disorders in which IL13 plays a significant role, like asthma (19Huang S.K.

A fast protein liquid chromatographic system, columns, and media and a unique site elimination mutagenesis kit were obtained fromAmersham Biosciences (Piscataway, NJ). Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized in house at the Macromolecular Core Laboratory, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA. The GBM cell line, U-251 MG, was from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (Rockville, MD). G-26 mouse glioma cells were transfected with IL13Rα2 receptors to obtain G-26-IL13Rα2(+) cells (13Mintz A. Gibo D.M. Becky S.W. Christensen N.D. Debinski W. Neoplasia. 2002; 4: 388-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). A TF-1 cell line was obtained from the ATCC. Tissue culture equipment was from Corning Glass (Corning, NY). MTS/PMS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt/phenazine methosulfate was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). SDS-PAGE and Western blot transferring equipment were from Bio-Rad. Antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). SuperSignal Substrate for chemiluminescent detection was from Pierce. Mutations in the gene encoding for wild type IL13 were introduced by a unique site-elimination method (21Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar) in which site-specific mutations are introduced in the plasmid using a target mutagenic primer (Table I) and a selection primer as suggested by the manufacturer. Primers were designed using Vector NTI Suite software (Bethesda, MD). A selection primer 5′-TGAGGATCCGAGCTCTAATCTAGAGGCTGCTAAC-3′ was used to convertEcoRI enzyme site in the plasmid to XbaI site, to achieve more efficient mutagenesis through restriction selection digestion and transformation. All the mutated plasmids were isolated, purified, and subsequently sequenced in house.Table IOligonucleotide mutagenic primers used for alanine scanning mutagenesis of α-helix D segment of IL13PositionMutagenic primer 5′-3′K90AGTCCGAGACACCGCAATCGAGGTGI91ACGAGACACCAAAGCCGAGGTGGCCCAGE92AGACACCAAAATCGCAGTGGCCCAGTTV93AACCAAAATCGAGGCTGCCCAGTTTGTAA94VaAlanine in the 94th position is substituted by valine.AAAATCGAGGTGGTACAGTTTGTAAAAQ95ATCGAGGTGGCCGCATTTGTAAAAGATCTGF96AATCGAGGTGGCCCAGGCTGTAAAAGATCTGV97AGTGGCCCAGTTTGCAAAAGATCTGCTCK98AGCCCAGTTTGTAGCAGATCTGCTCTTAD99AGCCCAGTTTGTAAAAGCTCTGCTCTTAL100AGCCCAGTTTGTAAAAGATGCTCTCTTACL101AGTAAAAGATCTGGCCTTACATTTAAAGL102AAAAGATCTGCTCGCACATTTAAAGAAACH103AGATCTGCTCTTAGCTTTAAAGAAACTTL104ACTGCTCTTAGCAAAACTTTTTCGCK105ACTCTTACATTTAGCAAAACTTTTTCGCK106ATTACATTTAAAGGCACTTTTTCGCGAGGGAL107ATTAAAGAAAGCTTTTCGCGAGGGAF108ATTAAAGAAACTTGCTCGCGAGGGACGGR109AAAGAAACTTTTTGCCGAGGGACGGTTCE110AACTTTTTCGCGCAGGACGGTTCAACG111AAAACTTTTTCGCGAGGCACGGTTCAACTGAR112AAAACTTTTTCGCGAGGGAGCCTTCAACTGAF113ACGCGAGGGACGGGCCAACTGAGGAThe underlined codons denote alanine.a Alanine in the 94th position is substituted by valine. Open table in a new tab The underlined codons denote alanine. All the plasmids encoding the protein of interest were constructed with T7 promoters and an ampicillin-resistant gene as described previously (16Thompson J.P. Debinski W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29944-29950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli strain BL21 (λDE3) cells, carrying an IPTG-inducible T7 RNA polymerase gene, and an IPTG-inducible form was used as host for the expression of alanine mutant proteins. BL21 E. coli cells were transformed with appropriate plasmid and cultured in 1.0 liter of LB broth. When A 600reached a value of 2.0, IPTG was added to a final concentration of 250 μm and incubated for 2 h. The proteins localized in the inclusion body pellets were isolated after tissuemizing, washing, and denaturing it in 7 m guanidine HCl and renaturing it in presence of l-arginine and oxidized glutathione as described previously (22Debinski W. Puri R.K. Kreitman R.J. Pastan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14065-14070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The renatured proteins were then dialyzed against 10 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.2, and purified on two ion exchange columns, SP-Sepharose and Mono S using a fast protein liquid chromatography system (fast protein liquid chromatography, Amersham Biosciences). The molecular weight and purity of alanine mutants of α-helix D of IL13 were verified by SDS-PAGE, under non-reducing conditions. The mutants were electrophoresed in 15% SDS-PAGE gel. The separated proteins in the gel were stained in Coomassie Blue for visual inspection. For the Western blot, the proteins from the gel were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane in a transfer buffer at 4 °C. Then, the membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat milk in phosphate-buffered saline for about 2 h at room temperature and incubated for 45 min in 5% milk containing the primary antibody, polyclonal goat anti-human IL13 antibody (1:1000 dilution). The membrane was washed three times for 5 min each in 0.05% Tween 20/PBS and was incubated for 45 min in 5% milk containing anti-goat IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:15,000 dilution), a secondary antibody, which was raised against the peptide derived from C terminus of IL13. Subsequently, the membrane was washed three times with 0.05% Tween 20/PBS. The proteins were detected on the film by enhanced chemiluminescent substrate (ECL) detection system (Pierce). For CD spectral analysis, each mutant protein was suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (0.1 mg/ml). All the mutants were analyzed under similar condition at 37 °C, and the spectra were recorded using a demountable “strain-free” quartz cuvette with path length of 2 mm, using a Jasco J-710 spectropolarimeter calibrated with (+)-camphor-10-sulfonic acid. The spectra were obtained in the wavelength range of 195–260 nm and subtracted with that of blank PBS spectrum. Reported spectra were the average of three consecutive runs for each sample. TF-1 cells, the pre-leukemic human B cells, which express the shared IL13/4 receptor, but not IL13Rα2 (23Zurawski S.M. Vega Jr., F. Huyghe B. Zurawski G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2663-2670Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), were grown in the presence of different concentrations of wild type IL13 and their mutants in 96-well culture plates. After 72 h of incubation at 37 °C, the rate of proliferation of TF-1 cells was determined by a colorimetric MTS/PMS cell proliferation assay. The cell samples were incubated with the dye for 4 h, and then their absorbance at 490 nm was recorded for each well using a microplate reader. The wells with cells treated with high concentrations of cycloheximide served as background for the assay. The experiment was performed in duplicate. The relative potency of IL13 mutantsversus wild type cytokine was estimated as follows, Proliferation(IL13mutant)at100ng/mlProliferation(wild type IL13)at100ng/ml×100Equation 1 The blocking or neutralizing efficiency of the alanine mutants of human IL13 against IL13-based cytotoxin, IL13-PE38QQR, were tested in U-251 MG and G-26-hIL-13Rα2(+) cell lines. IL13-PE38QQR is a cytotoxin obtained by fusing a derivative of Pseudomonas exotoxin, PE38QQR, to IL13, which potently kills HGA (9Debinski W. Obiri N.I. Pastan I. Puri R.K. J. Biol.

In our studies, 1 × 103 cells/well of U-251 MG cells and 2.5 × 103 cells/well of G-26 cells were plated in 96-well culture plates and incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2, and 90% humidity for 24 h. Then, IL13 or its mutants were added to cells for 1 h at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml. In the positive control wells, 0.1% PBS/bovine serum albumin of volume equal to IL13 or its mutants were added. After 1 h of incubation, increasing concentrations of the IL13-based cytotoxin (0.01–100 ng/ml final concentration) were added, and the cells were incubated for 2 days. The number of proliferating cells in each well was determined by colorimetric MTS/PMS method described above. The experiment was performed in duplicate. The neutralization efficiency of the alanine mutants with respect to the wild type IL13 at a cytotoxin concentration of 100 ng/ml were calculated as follows. %Neutralization efficiencyEquation 2 =[A490(mutant)/A490(wild type)]×100or %Loss in neutralization efficiency=[A490(wild type)−A490(mutant)]/A490(wild type)×100Equation 3 IL13 was labeled with 125I using IODO-GEN reagent (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions (25Salacinski P.R.P. McLean C. Sykes J.E.C. Clement-Jones V.V. Lowry P.J. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 117: 136-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar). On each slide, 2.5 × 104 U-251 MG cells were spotted in duplicate and ethanol-fixed and dried. The specific activity of 125I-IL13 was 120 μCi/μg of protein. To determine the competition in the binding efficiency of125I-IL13 in the presence of alanine mutants on U-251 cells, the slides were incubated with the IL13 alanine mutants of varied concentrations (0.1–200 nm) for 1 h. All the dilutions were made in binding buffer composed of 200 mmsucrose, 50 mm HEPES, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 10 mm EDTA. Subsequently, the cell spots were incubated with 1.0 nm125I-IL13 in binding buffer. The nonspecifically bound radioligand were dissociated by rinsing the spots in three consecutive changes (5 min each) of ice-cold 0.1 mPBS. After drying, the radiolabeled sections were exposed to Phosphor screen cassettes for 12 h. Autoradiographic images were scanned by Laser Scanning Module PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA), with integral ImageQuaNT data system. The area integration was carried out on the radioactive spots using ImageQuaNT software, and the percent relative intensities were plotted against the concentration of blocker. TF-1 cells growing in a log phase were harvested and sedimented by low speed centrifugation, then washed twice and resuspended in ice cold PBS. For saturation curve binding analysis, 1 × 106 cells were incubated in 250 μl of PBS in duplicates containing 0.1–1000 pm concentrations of 125I-IL13 (specific activity, 147 μCi/μg of protein) for 3 h at 4 °C. Cell-bound radioactivity was separated by using a cell harvester (Brandel, Gaithersburg, MD), and the harvested cells were counted in a γ-counter. Nonspecific binding was determined at each concentration of labeled IL13 by adding 500-fold molar excess of the non-labeled IL13. Nonspecific binding was subtracted from all the data points to produce specific binding values. The results represent an average of duplicate determinations in one to three independent assays with variations being less than 20% from the mean. In competition studies, 1 × 106 TF-1 cells were incubated with serial dilutions of wild type and mutant IL13 proteins at 4 °C for 1 h. Next, labeled IL13 was added at a final concentration of 40 pm and incubated with cells for additional 2 h. Then the cell-bound radioactivity was determined as above. We carried out alanine scanning mutagenesis of α-helix D of IL13 using IL13-CLS as the template plasmid. pIL13-CLS contains a gene in which several codons were changed without affecting the corresponding amino acid in IL13 and has been optimized in our laboratory to express higher level of proteins. An alanine substitution is preferred as a first step in a mutational analysis of proteins, because it eliminates potential polar interactions and most hydrophobic interactions with minimum effects on the secondary structure of the α-helical ligand domains (26Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. Science. 1989; 244: 1801-1805Crossref Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). Moreover, changing a residue capable of non-covalent interaction with the receptors to alanine usually gives an initial indication of whether a particular side chain is required for ligand binding. 23 single-site alanine mutants from position 90–113 encompassing the entire length ofd-helix were constructed (TableI). In one instance, we have substituted alanine at position 94, to another hydrophobic neutral amino acid, valine. Plasmids encoding each of the mutant proteins were used to transform BL21 E. coli (λDE3) bacteria, and all the expressed proteins were localized to the inclusion bodies. The final yield of the protein after purification ranged from 0.5 to 1.5 mg/liter culture, except for mutant proteins like IL13.L100A and IL13.H103A, the expressions of which were below 0.5 mg/liter culture. Each mutant protein was purified from the inclusion body pellets to greater than 90% homogeneity and of proper size of ∼13 kDa, as observed from SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 1 A). Furthermore, all the 24 alanine mutant proteins were immunoreactive toward anti-human IL13 antibody (Fig. 1 B) and IL13.K90A was the mutant that showed substantially diminished immunoreactivity in the Western blot. IL13.K90A mutant is of lesser immunoreactivity either because this amino acid represents an important antigenic epitope in IL13 or structurally important β-sheet involving this residue affected the proper folding of the protein resulting in its poor immunoreactivity. The CD spectrum was measured to confirm qualitatively the secondary structural elements in the IL13 mutant proteins. It is important to determine the secondary structural elements, because they are involved in the process of folding of a protein at early stage (27Baldwin R.L. Roder H. Curr. Biol. 1991; 1: 218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 28Goldenberg D.P. Frieden R.W. Haack J.A. Morrison J.B. Nature. 1989; 338: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). CD spectra of α-helical-enriched protein should have two spectral minima at 208 and 222 nm. The CD spectral data were obtained for all the 24-alanine mutants, and all the mutant proteins had those spectral minima and confirmed the fact that, by substituting the residues in IL13 with alanine, the helical coiling behavior remained largely unaffected. We have shown in Fig. 2 only the CD spectral data for functionally important mutants, which displayed altered binding to IL13/4R and/or glioma-restricted receptor to confirm the folded nature of those mutants. By comparing the intensity of peaks with wild type IL13, we observed a decrease in intensity with certain mutants like H103A and L100A. It is possible that replacement of bulky groups might have created a kink in the helix resulting in lower intensity bands. Interestingly, these are the mutants of lowest yield of recombinant proteins. IL13-PE38QQR is a recombinant chimera cytotoxic fusion protein that effectively kills glioma cells through IL13Rα2 binding and internalization (13Mintz A. Gibo D.M. Becky S.W. Christensen N.D. Debinski W. Neoplasia. 2002; 4: 388-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). IL13-based cytotoxin cell killing neutralization by the mutants of IL13 demonstrates, how efficient a mutant competes for the receptor site in cancerous cells that mediates the killing action of a cytotoxin (29Debinski W. Miner R. Leland P. Obiri N.I. Puri R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22428-22433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This phenomenon is of importance to us to design cancer-specific cytotoxins and showed its usefulness and predicted structural features of IL13 confirmed in its solution structure (5Moy F.J. Diblasio E. Wilhelm J. Powers R. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 219-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 18Eisenmesser E.Z. Horita D.A. Alteiri A.S. Byrd R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Cytotoxicity studies were conducted using two cell lines, U-251 MG human cells and G-26 mouse glioma cells, the latter were transfected to express IL13Rα2 (13Mintz A. Gibo D.M. Becky S.W. Christensen N.D. Debinski W. Neoplasia. 2002; 4: 388-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Only G-26 cells transfected with IL13Rα2 and not parental G-26 cells were susceptible to killing by IL13-based cytotoxins. Most alanine mutants neutralized the cytotoxicity of IL13-PE38QQR cytotoxin to a similar extent when compared with wild type IL13 (Fig.3). The first set of analysis (Fig.3 A) demonstrates the blocking efficiency of IL13 alanine mutants in the region encompassing amino acids from positions 90–99 in α-helix D, which forms the beginning of helix D and includes the short β-strand preceding this helix. We found that mutation of lysine at position 90 and isoleucine at position 91 to alanine dramatically impaired the neutralization efficiency of the mutants when compared with wild type IL13 (Fig. 3 A). Lys-90 and Ile-91 both lie in the β-strand preceding α-helix D. Cytotoxic neutralization study indicated the total impairment of neutralization efficiency in the case of IL13.K90A and 64% loss in neutralization for IL13.I91A when compared with wild type IL13 (Fig. 3 A). Substitution of alanine for valine at position 94 in the α-helix D partially impaired its neutralization efficiency against cytotoxin, with a progressive decrease with respect to cytotoxin concentration, reaching a value of 49% at 100 ng/ml cytotoxin. Similar partial impairment in neutralization efficiency was observed for another mutant, IL13.F96A. Lesser loss in neutralization efficiency was observed for mutants like IL13.E92A and IL13.D99A, although they were not significant (Fig.3 A). However, the cytotoxicity neutralization pattern for IL13.Q95A, IL13.V93A, and IL13.V97A appeared to be similar to that for wild type IL13. The neutralization of cytotoxicity by the alanine mutants corresponding to the middle portion of the α-helix D, from positions 100 to 109, is shown in Fig. 3 B. We found that the cytotoxic neutralization effect was almost nullified for the mutant IL13.K105A. Similar loss in blocking effect was observed for IL13.K106A, although less pronounced (Fig. 3 B). There was also 52% loss in blocking efficiency for IL13.R109A at a higher concentration of cytotoxin (100 ng/ml). Although other mutants like IL13.L101A and IL13.L107A exhibited an apparent decrease in blocking activity, they were less prominent than that for IL13.K105A and IL13.K106A. Fig. 3 C includes the cytotoxic neutralization pattern of the alanine mutants located toward the end of helix D at the C-terminal end of the protein (positions 110–113). The respective alanine mutants did not show dramatic alterations toward binding to glioma-restricted receptor, because there was no change in their blocking efficiency of cytotoxin killing (Fig. 3 C) when compared with wild type IL13, with the exception of IL13.E110A and IL13.R112A where we observed a partial decrease in blocking efficiency at 100 ng/ml cytotoxin concentration. U-251 MG cells not only overexpress IL13Rα2, but also express IL13/4R (11Debinski W. Gibo D.M. Mol. Med. 2000; 6: 440-449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we re-analyzed the blocking efficiency of d-helix mutants of IL13 in a cell system, in which IL13/4R does not contribute to IL13-based cytotoxin cell killing as evidenced by the fact that G-26 mouse glioma parental cells are not killed by IL13-PE38QQR toxin (13Mintz A. Gibo D.M. Becky S.W. Christensen N.D. Debinski W. Neoplasia. 2002; 4: 388-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar).

We injected in vitro transcribed cRNA encoding AQPxlo into Xenopus oocytes for functional characterization. AQPxlo expression increased osmotic water permeability (P f), as well as the uptake of glycerol and urea. However, AQPxlo excluded larger polyols and thiourea. An alkaline extracellular pH (pHo) increasedP f and to a lesser extent urea uptake but not glycerol uptake. Remarkably, low HgCl2 concentrations (0.3–10 μm) reduced P f and urea uptake, whereas high concentrations (300–1000 μm) reversed the inhibition.

The Xenopus laevis oocyte is an important and powerful expression system for the study of foreign mRNAs and translated proteins from animals, plants, fungi, and prokaryotes.Xenopus oocytes are popular because of their large size (diameter 1.0–1.3 mm), robustness, the ease with which one can inject them with mRNA or other substances, and their suitability for a wide variety of experimental manipulations.Because Xenopus oocytes are extensively used to study the properties of exogenous channels and transporters, an awareness and understanding of endogenous membrane protein expression is of paramount importance. The native oocyte expresses many ion channels (recently reviewed in Ref. 1Weber W.-M. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 170: 1-12Google Scholar) and transporters. Moreover, the overexpression of exogenous membrane proteins may change the expression of native oocyte proteins. If these proteins are not present in significant amounts in the control oocyte, it can be difficult to determine which properties can be attributed to a heterologously expressed protein and which are due to a change in the activity of endogenous protein.Inasmuch as the water permeability of the native oocyte membrane is low, it was long thought that oocytes possess few endogenous water channels (i.e. aquaporins or AQPs). 1The abbreviations used are: AQP, aquaporin; CFTR, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; IBMX, isobutyl-1-methylxanthine; CHES, 2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; TOPO, topoisomerase. 1The abbreviations used are: AQP, aquaporin; CFTR, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; IBMX, isobutyl-1-methylxanthine; CHES, 2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; TOPO, topoisomerase. Recently, Schreiberet al. (2Schreiber R. Pavenstadt H. Greger R. Kunzelmann K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 475: 291-295Google Scholar) cloned an AQP3 orthologue (xAQP3) from the A6X. laevis cell line (derived from kidney). They showed that, in oocytes expressing the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), stimulation of CFTR activity with 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) increased the water and glycerol permeability of the oocyte membrane. They concluded that CFTR regulates the activity of endogenously expressed xAQP3, because IBMX failed to stimulate glycerol permeability in oocytes injected with antisense oligonucleotides complimentary to xAQP3. However, in the absence of exogenous CFTR expression, xAQP3 activity in the oocytes remained undetectable.We report here the cloning of a novel member of the AQP family fromX. laevis oocytes. In addition, we have studied the permeability properties of this novel clone by overexpressing it in its native host, the oocyte.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning of AQPxloBy searching the GenBankTM data base for sequences with homology to known AQPs, we identified two novel EST sequences (GenBankTM accession numbers AW200125 and AW199121) fromX. laevis oocytes. To obtain the full-length coding region, we performed PCR on an X. laevis oocyte library (X. laevis oocyte 5′-STRETCH cDNA λTriplEx library, Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) using primers specific to the coding sequence and to the vector sequences flanking the 5′ and 3′ ends of the insert. The resulting PCR products were subcloned into a pCR 2.1 TOPO-vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced. We performed end-to-end PCR with primers designed to the 5′ and 3′ regions flanking the open reading frame to obtain a continuous cDNA fragment containing the entire coding region. The sense primer was 5′-ACTCGAGGCCGCGTCGACTGG and the antisense primer was 5′-TACTAGTGCCAATCAAGAAGCAGATTCCC, where the underlined sequence corresponds to engineered XhoI (sense) and SpeI (antisense) restriction sites. The resulting PCR product was cloned into pCR 2.1 TOPO-vector and sequenced. All sequencing was performed by the Keck Biotechnology Resource Laboratory (Boyer Center for Molecular Medicine, Yale University). The cDNA sequence was deposited into the GenBankTM (accession numberAY120934). We have provisionally named the clone AQPxlo (forX enopus laevis oocyte).Cloning of Rat AQP7For the sake of comparing the functional properties of AQPxlo to those of a related mammalian AQP, we cloned rat AQP7. We performed PCR using sense primer 5′-GTGACCATGGGAATACATG and antisense primer 5′-GGATGCCTATCATGAGGG. As a template we used rat kidney cDNA, which was a kind gift or Dr. Inyeong Choi (Yale University). The PCR product was subcloned into a pCR 2.1 TOPO-vector and sequenced. The cDNA (GenBankTM accession number AY120935) contained an 810-bp open reading frame encoding 269 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence was 97% identical to the published rat AQP7 sequence (GenBankTM accession number NM_019157).Northern BlotTotal RNA from oocytes, lung, skin, fat body, muscle, kidney, urinary bladder, stomach, intestine, and liver was extracted from adult female X. laevis using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen), according to manufacturer's directions. Total RNA (10 μg) was resolved by formaldehyde-agarose (1%) denaturing gels and blotted to positively charged nylon membrane (Hybond XL, AmershamBiosciences) by capillary elution. Blots were prehybridized by incubation in ExpressHyb hybridization solution (Clontech Laboratories, Inc) at 65 °C for 30 min and then hybridized with an α-32P-labeled probe (Random Primer labeling kit, Invitrogen) corresponding to the full-length AQPxlo sequence at 65 °C for 90 min. The blots were subjected to a high stringency wash (two 15-min washes at room temperature with 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS and two 30-min washes at 50 °C with 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS), after which they were mounted and autoradiographed.Oocyte ExpressionThe AQPxlo fragment was excised from pCR 2.1 TOPO usingXhoI and SpeI and subcloned into a KSM oocyte expression vector, in which the multiple cloning site is surrounded by the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions for Xenopus β-globin. This expression vector was a kind gift of Dr. William Joiner (Yale University). Rat AQP7 was excised from pCR 2.1 TOPO usingXhoI and HindIII and ligated to KSM. Capped cRNA was transcribed in vitro using T3 Message Machine kit (Ambion, Austin, TX).Stage V–VI oocytes were defolliculated with collagenase type Ia (Sigma) and stored in OR3 medium (Sigma) as described previously (3Romero M.F. Fong P. Berger U.V. Hediger M.A. Boron W.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F425-F432Google Scholar). On the day after isolation, oocytes were injected with 50 nl of cRNA encoding either AQPxlo (0.4 μg/μl), rat AQP3 (0.2 μg/μl), rat AQP7 (0.2 μg/μl), the rat urea transporter UT-A2 (0.2 μg/μl), or human AQP1 (0.05 μg/μl). Control oocytes were injected only with water. The cDNA encoding AQP1 (in the Xenopus expression vector pXβG) was a gift from Dr. Peter Agre (The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD); AQP3 (in pSPORT) was a gift from Dr. Lawrence Palmer (Cornell University, New York, NY); and UT-A2 (in pBluescript) was a gift from Dr. Craig Smith (University of Manchester, UK).Measurement of Oocyte Water PermeabilityWe used a volumetric assay to measure the osmotic water permeability (P f) of oocytes injected with various cRNAs or water (control). The oocyte was placed in a perfusion chamber and illuminated from below. We acquired images of the oocyte silhouette every 2 s through a video camera attached to a stereomicroscope. The images were saved to a disk and analyzed using Optimas software version 5.2 (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). The oocyte volume was calculated from the cross-sectional area of the oocyte, assuming the oocyte to be a perfect sphere. The volume was calibrated using, as an underwater standard, a brass ball bearing placed near the oocyte.The oocyte was initially superfused with isotonic ND96 solution (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, osmolality 200 mOsm) at a solution flow of 4 ml min−1. To induce cell swelling, the perfusate was switched to a hypo-osmotic solution with half the osmolality of ND96, prepared by reducing the concentration of NaCl to 43 mm. Osmolalities were measured using a vapor pressure osmometer (Wescor, Inc. Logan, UT).To study extracellular pH (pHo) sensitivity ofP f in oocytes expressing AQPxlo, we preincubated the oocyte for 2 min in an iso-osmotic solution with the appropriate pH (5–11.5) before switching to the hypo-osmotic solution. For solutions with pH 5 or 6, we replaced HEPES with MES. For solutions with pH 7.5 or 8.5 we used HEPES. For solutions with pH 9.5, 10.5, or 11.5, we replaced HEPES with CHES. To avoid precipitation, we omitted MgCl2 and CaCl2 from the pH 11.5 solutions and increased the amount of NaCl to maintain osmolality.To study the effect of HgCl2 on P f of oocytes expressing AQPxlo, we preincubated the oocytes for 5 min in ND96 solution containing the appropriate concentration of HgCl2 (0.1–1000 μm) before switching to hypo-osmotic solution containing the same HgCl2concentration. We studied the reversibility of the HgCl2treatment by sequentially subjecting the same oocyte to cell swelling three times as follows: (i) without HgCl2, (ii) with 1 μm HgCl2, and (iii) without HgCl2but after a 5-min incubation period with β-mercaptoethanol (5 mm).The osmotic water permeability was calculated using Equation 1 (4Zhang R.B. Logee K.A. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15375-15378Google Scholar, 5Chandy G. Zampighi G.A. Kreman M. Hall J.E. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 159: 29-39Google Scholar), where (d(V/V o)/dt) is the initial rate of increase in relative oocyte volume following a hypo-osmotic challenge; V o is the initial oocyte volume; S is the actual surface area; Δosm is the osmotic gradient across the oocyte membrane, andV w is the molar volume of water. Pf=[d(V/Vo)/dt][Vo/S]/[ΔosmVw]Equation 1 S of the oocyte was obtained by multiplying the geometric surface area (calculated from the measured volume of each oocyte) by 8, as it has been shown that the actual surface area, accounting for the numerous infoldings and microvilli of the plasmalemma, is 8–9 times larger than the area of a sphere of equivalent size (5Chandy G. Zampighi G.A. Kreman M. Hall J.E. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 159: 29-39Google Scholar).Measurement of Osmolyte Permeation in OocyteRadioisotope UptakeWe measured unidirectional influx of urea and glycerol in oocytes using 14C-labeled urea ([14C]urea) and glycerol ([U-14C]glycerol; Moravek Biochemicals, Brea, CA). Four oocytes were placed in a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube in ND96 solution. Measurement of isotope uptake was started by replacing the ND96 solution with 700 μl of uptake solution, which consisted of ND96 containing 1 mm unlabeled analyte and 1 μCi/ml (37 kBq/ml) of the radioisotopically labeled analyte. Oocytes were incubated on a horizontal shaker for 2 min at room temperature. In preliminary experiments, we monitored the time course of 14C uptake to ensure that the uptake was linear during the first 2 min. Radioisotope uptake was stopped by washing oocytes three times in ice-cold ND96 containing 10 mm of the unlabeled analyte. Individual oocytes were transferred to scintillation vials and lysed in 400 μl of 10% SDS with continuous shaking. The 14C activity of individual oocytes was assessed by liquid scintillation counting (LKB-Wallac Rackbeta, Turku, Finland).We calculated an apparent rate constant k using Equation2, k=AOOCYTEAU×tEquation 2 where t is the incubation time;A OOCYTE is the radioactivity accumulated by an oocyte (assuming an oocyte volume of 1 μl) over the time of incubation (t), and A U is the radioactivity of 1 μl of uptake solution.When inhibitors were used, the oocytes were pretreated for 5 min in ND96 solution containing the inhibitor before adding the uptake solution (which also contained the inhibitor). Both HgCl2(1 and 300 μm) and phloretin (0.5 mm, final concentrations) were prepared fresh daily.Reflection Coefficient ςThe reflection coefficient ς is an index of the effectiveness of a solute in generating an osmotic driving force across a semipermeable membrane. For ς = 1, the membrane is impermeant to the solute, and for ς = 0, the permeability of the solute is indistinguishable from that of the solvent. For a semipermeable solute, 0 ≤ ς ≤ 1. To determine ς, we used a variation of the volumetric method (see above) that we used to measure P f. For each oocyte, we obtained an initial P f value by subjecting the oocyte to swelling by exposing it to a hypo-osmotic (100 mOsm) ND96 solution. After allowing the oocyte to recover in iso-osmotic ND96 solution for at least 5 min, we superfused the oocyte with a solution in which we iso-osmotically substituted 100 mm of the test solute for NaCl. When ς ≤ 1, the solute will enter the oocyte together with osmotically obliged water, leading to cell swelling. The oocyte was again allowed to recover before superfusing with another solute (see below). For AQPxlo-expressing oocytes we measured ς for six different solutes as follows: the polyols glycerol (C-3), xylitol (C-5), ribitol (C-5), and mannitol (C-6), as well as urea and thiourea. Ribitol and xylitol were chosen because in ribitol, each of the –OH groups is on the same side of the carbon backbone, whereas in xylitol the –OH groups have a mixed stereospecific arrangement. In the bacterial glycerol facilitator GlpF, such stereoselectivity plays an important role in determining the permeability properties of the channel (6Fu D. Libson A. Miercke L.J. Weitzman C. Nollert P. Krucinski J. Stroud R.M. Science. 2000; 290: 481-486Google Scholar). As controls, we measured ς for glycerol and urea in water-injected oocytes, as well as in oocytes expressing human AQP1 and rat AQP3.We calculated ς according to Equation 3, 1−ς=(dV/dt)/(S×Pf×Δπ×Vw)Equation 3 where (dV/dt) is the initial rate of increase in oocyte volume following an iso-osmotic challenge with a solute; S is the actual surface area; P fis the osmotic water permeability (determined for the same oocyte as described above, using Equation 1); Δπ is the osmotic gradient for the analyte across the oocyte membrane, andV w is the molar volume of water.Measurement of Intracellular pHAn oocyte, placed in a perfusion chamber, was superfused at a rate of 4 ml min−1. pH-sensitive electrodes were fabricated and used as described previously (7Romero M.F. Hediger M.A. Boulpaep E.L. Boron W.F. Nature. 1997; 387: 409-413Google Scholar, 8Siebens A.W. Boron W.F. J. Gen. Physiol. 1987; 90: 799-831Google Scholar). Briefly, the oocyte was impaled with two microelectrodes, one for measuring the membrane potential (V m) and the other one for measuring intracellular pH (pHi). The tip of the pH electrode contained a pH-sensitive liquid membrane (Hydrogen Ionophore I, mixture B, Fluka Chemical Corp., Ronkonkoma, NY). Voltages were measured using an FD 223 Electrometer (World Precision Instruments, Inc., Sarasota, FL), and the voltage due to pHi was obtained by an analogue subtraction of the signals from the V m and pH electrodes. The pH calibration was performed as described previously (9Virkki L.V. Wilson D.A. Vaughan-Jones R.D. Boron W.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C1278-C1289Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONWe have cloned from Xenopus oocytes a novel AQP that is predominantly expressed in fat body, oocytes, and kidney. AQPxlo is permeable to water, glycerol, and urea but excludes the larger polyols xylitol, ribitol, and mannitol, as well as thiourea. Judging from its strong expression in fat body, AQPxlo may play a role in the triglyceride metabolism in this tissue by promoting glycerol transport. The fat body, an organ associated with the anterior testis or ovary, serves as a storage organ for fat and undergoes marked changes in size in many anurans, depending on the season and the nutritional status of the animal.Sensitivity to Changes in pHoTheP f of AQPxlo falls sharply as one lowers pHobelow 9.5 and more gradually as one raises pHo above 9.5 (Fig.4 A). Regarding other AQPs, both the P fand glycerol permeability of AQP3 fall sharply at acidic pHovalues, with a pK of 6.4 for P f and 6.1 for glycerol (10Zeuthen T. Klærke D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21631-21636Google Scholar). According to one report, the P fof bovine major intrinsic protein (AQP0) is maximal at pHo 6.5 and falls at both more acidic and more alkaline pHo values (15Nemeth-Cahalan K.L. Hall J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6777-6782Google Scholar).The biphasic pHo dependence of P f in AQPxlo-expressing oocytes is consistent with the idea that AQPxlo has more than one titratable site that influences the permeability pathway for water, and that the sum of effects is positive in its influence from pH 5.0 to 9.5 and negative above pH 9.5. Because oocyte pHi is remarkably resistant to pHo changes between pHo 5.0 and 10.5 (Fig. 4 B), it is likely that these sites are located where they are accessible to extracellular protons.In stark contrast to P f, which increased 4-fold as we raised pHo from 7.5 to 9.5, glycerol uptake in AQPxlo-expressing oocytes was unaffected (Fig. 5 B). The effect of pHo on urea uptake in AQPxlo-expressing oocytes falls between that of P f and glycerol uptake in that increasing pHo from 7.5 to 9.5 produced a small but significant increase in the rate of urea uptake (Fig. 5 C). Our observation that the movement of the small H2O is very pHo-sensitive, whereas the uptake of the much larger glycerol is not pHo-sensitive at all, suggests that pHosensitivity does not depend in any simple way on molecular size. Rather, the complex pattern of pHo sensitivities may reflect interactions between the transported species and specific titratable residues lining the channel.Sensitivity to HgCl2The effect of HgCl2 on the P f (Fig. 6) and urea uptake (Fig. 8 B) of AQPxlo-expressing oocytes is novel. A low (1 μm) HgCl2 concentration reduces bothP f and urea uptake, whereas a higher (300 μm) concentration reverses the inhibition. In contrast, HgCl2 inhibited glycerol uptake equally well at both low (1 μm) and high (300 μm) HgCl2concentrations (Fig. 8 A).The simplest way to interpret the data is to assume that the action of HgCl2 involves at least two reactive groups. One (a high affinity site) reacts at low concentrations of Hg2+, resulting in a marked decrease in the permeability of AQPxlo to H2O, glycerol, and urea. The other (a low affinity site) reacts only when the HgCl2 concentration is elevated, and its effect is to reverse only the inhibition of P fand urea uptake. Presumably the reaction of the first Hg2+partially obstructs the pore of AQPxlo, reducing the transport of all substances. The second Hg2+ might then cause a conformational change that relieves the obstruction just enough to let H2O and urea (but not glycerol) pass. We do not know the nature of the Hg2+-reaction sites, but they are likely to be thiol groups of cysteine residues, as is the case for several other AQPs. AQPxlo has six cysteines, at positions 24, 40, 74, 105, 174, and 210. Preston et al. (16Preston G.M. Jung J.S. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17-20Google Scholar) showed that of the four cysteines present in AQP1, Cys189 mediates the blocking effect of mercurials. AQPxlo has a tyrosine (Tyr212) at the position equivalent to Cys189 in AQP1 but has a cysteine nearby (Cys210).Interestingly, Yasui et al. (17Yasui M. Hazama A. Kwon T.H. Nielsen S. Guggino W.B. Agre P. Nature. 1999; 402: 184-187Google Scholar) showed that HgCl2 causes an ∼10-fold increase in theP f of oocytes expressing human AQP6, and also induces an ion conductance. The authors showed that the double mutant Cys155–Cys190 is unresponsive to stimulation by HgCl2. AQPxlo has a cysteine (Cys174) at the position equivalent to Cys155 in AQP6 (Cys152in AQP1), but has the aforementioned Tyr212 at the position equivalent to Cys190 in AQP6 (Cys189 in AQP1). Thus, of the six cysteine residues in AQPxlo, Cys174 and Cys210 are good candidates for HgCl2 reaction sites.Does AQPxlo Contribute to Transport in Native Oocytes?Because the water permeability of nativeXenopus oocytes is low, it is perhaps surprising that they should contain significant amounts of mRNA encoding an endogenous water channel, as indicated by our Northern blot analysis (Fig. 2). On the other hand, the AQPxlo protein may not be expressed at the cell membrane or at all. Indeed, oocytes contain large amounts of stored mRNA that are not translated into protein until the egg starts developing. Our data indicate that native AQPxlo expression in the oocyte is, at most, low. For example, the P f of water-injected oocytes showed little (Fig. 5 A) or no (Fig.4) change in response to changes in pHo. Also, glycerol uptake in water-injected oocytes was not blocked by HgCl2. On the other hand, HgCl2 at 1 μm reduces bothP f and urea uptake in water-injected oocytes, consistent with native AQPxlo expression. It is possible that if oocytes express the AQPxlo protein at the cell membrane, then the level of expression might vary among batches of oocytes.However, native AQPxlo might contribute significantly to transport in oocytes heterologously expressing other membrane proteins. Several groups (18Tzounopoulos T. Maylie J. Adelman J.P. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 904-908Google Scholar, 19Estevez R. Camps M. Rojas A.M. Testar X. Deves R. Hediger M.A. Zorzano A. Palacin M. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1319-1329Google Scholar, 20Palacin M. Borsani G. Sebastio G. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 2001; 11: 328-335Google Scholar) have reported examples in which the heterologous expression of a membrane protein in Xenopusoocytes has led to the up-regulation of native Xenopusmembrane proteins. For example, the heterologous overexpression of any of several membrane proteins leads to the appearance of a native nonspecific cation channel in Xenopus oocytes (18Tzounopoulos T. Maylie J. Adelman J.P. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 904-908Google Scholar). In addition, expression of rBAT or 4F2hc in Xenopus oocytes induces amino acid transport, although the proteins themselves do not possess intrinsic transport activity (19Estevez R. Camps M. Rojas A.M. Testar X. Deves R. Hediger M.A. Zorzano A. Palacin M. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1319-1329Google Scholar). Instead, they associate with native Xenopus membrane proteins to form a heteromeric amino acid transporter (20Palacin M. Borsani G. Sebastio G. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 2001; 11: 328-335Google Scholar).The up-regulation of endogenous AQPxlo could account, at least in part, for novel transport activity observed in oocytes heterologously expressing two other membrane proteins. First, expressing major intrinsic protein (AQP0) in oocytes leads to an increase in glycerol permeability (21Kushmerick C. Rice S.J. Baldo G.J. Haspel H.C. Mathias R.T. Exp. Eye Res. 1995; 61: 351-362Google Scholar, 22Kushmerick C. Varadaraj K. Mathias R.T. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 161: 9-19Google Scholar, 23Virkki L.V. Cooper G.J. Boron W.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: R1994-R2003Google Scholar), even though major intrinsic protein in its native environment in the lens does not contribute to significant glycerol permeability (24Varadaraj K. Kushmerick C. Baldo G.J. Bassnett S. Shiels A. Mathias R.T. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 170: 191-203Google Scholar). Second, Schreiber et al. (25Schreiber R. Greger R. Nitschke R. Kunzelmann K. Pfluegers Arch. 1997; 434: 841-847Google Scholar) have shown that IBMX triggers an increase in water and glycerol permeability in oocytes expressing CFTR. In principle, the up-regulation of AQPxlo could account for this observation. On the other hand, Schreiber et al. (2Schreiber R. Pavenstadt H. Greger R. Kunzelmann K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 475: 291-295Google Scholar) eliminated the IBMX-stimulated water and glycerol permeabilities by injecting antisense oligonucleotides directed against a Xenopus AQP3 and concluded that CFTR up-regulates endogenous xAQP3. We were unable to obtain from oocytes a PCR product corresponding to xAQP3 2L. V. Virkki and G. J. Cooper, unpublished observations. ; however, it is possible that the Xenopus used by Schreiber et al. (2Schreiber R. Pavenstadt H. Greger R. Kunzelmann K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 475: 291-295Google Scholar) contained a significant amount of mRNA encoding xAQP3, whereas those used by us did not.Is AQPxlo a New Aquaporin?Our sequence and functional data indicate that AQPxlo is an aquaglyceroporin. Four paralogous aquaglyceroporins are known in mammals, AQPs 3, 7, 9, and 10. The dendrogram in Fig. 1 suggests that AQPxlo is most closely related to AQP3 and AQP10, sharing ∼49% amino acid sequence identity with mammalian and Xenopus AQP3 and ∼45% identity with AQP10. This level of sequence similarity is less than seen between mammalian AQP2 and AQP5 (∼60%), which are recognized as distinct AQP paralogues. Thus, a comparison of deduced amino acid sequences suggests that AQPxlo represents a new paralogous AQP. However, searching the human and mouse genome data bases has thus far failed to reveal a mammalian orthologue of AQPxlo.The permeability properties of AQPxlo are unique. Unlike AQP3 and AQP7, AQPxlo is permeable to urea. Unlike AQP9 (26Tsukaguchi H. Shayakul C. Berger U.V. Mackenzie B. Devidas S. Guggino W.B. Van Hoek A.N. Hediger M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24737-24743Google Scholar), AQPxlo does not serve as a pathway for mannitol or thiourea and is not sensitive to inhibition by phloretin. Unlike the recently cloned AQP10 (14Ishibashi K. Morinaga T. Kuwahara M. Sasaki K. Imai M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1576: 335-340Google Scholar), which takes up glycerol 7-fold faster than urea, AQPxlo takes up glycerol and urea equally fast (as measured by 14C uptake). Also unlike AQP10, whose urea uptake is blocked by phloretin, AQPxlo-mediated urea uptake is not inhibited by phloretin. Thus, the conclusion that AQPxlo is a new AQP paralogue is supported by our observation that the permeability properties of AQPxlo are unlike those of any of the known mammalian aquaglyceroporins. The Xenopus laevis oocyte is an important and powerful expression system for the study of foreign mRNAs and translated proteins from animals, plants, fungi, and prokaryotes.Xenopus oocytes are popular because of their large size (diameter 1.0–1.3 mm), robustness, the ease with which one can inject them with mRNA or other substances, and their suitability for a wide variety of experimental manipulations. Because Xenopus oocytes are extensively used to study the properties of exogenous channels and transporters, an awareness and understanding of endogenous membrane protein expression is of paramount importance. The native oocyte expresses many ion channels (recently reviewed in Ref. 1Weber W.-M. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 170: 1-12Google Scholar) and transporters. Moreover, the overexpression of exogenous membrane proteins may change the expression of native oocyte proteins. If these proteins are not present in significant amounts in the control oocyte, it can be difficult to determine which properties can be attributed to a heterologously expressed protein and which are due to a change in the activity of endogenous protein. Inasmuch as the water permeability of the native oocyte membrane is low, it was long thought that oocytes possess few endogenous water channels (i.e. aquaporins or AQPs). 1The abbreviations used are: AQP, aquaporin; CFTR, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; IBMX, isobutyl-1-methylxanthine; CHES, 2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; TOPO, topoisomerase. 1The abbreviations used are: AQP, aquaporin; CFTR, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; IBMX, isobutyl-1-methylxanthine; CHES, 2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; TOPO, topoisomerase. Recently, Schreiberet al. (2Schreiber R. Pavenstadt H. Greger R. Kunzelmann K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 475: 291-295Google Scholar) cloned an AQP3 orthologue (xAQP3) from the A6X. laevis cell line (derived from kidney). They showed that, in oocytes expressing the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), stimulation of CFTR"

Rapid scanning stopped-flow absorption spectrophotometry in conjunction with multiple turnover chemical quenched-flow kinetic analyses and a newly developed CoA detection method were used to examine the ALAS catalytic reaction and identify the rate-determining step. The reaction of glycine with ALAS follows a three-step kinetic process, ascribed to the formation of the Michaelis complex and the pyridoxal 5′-phosphate-glycine aldimine, followed by the abstraction of the glycine pro-R proton from the external aldimine. Significantly, the rate associated with this third step (k 3 = 0.002 s−1) is consistent with the rate determined for the ALAS-catalyzed removal of tritium from [2-3H2]glycine. Succinyl-CoA and acetoacetyl-CoA increased the rate of glycine proton removal ∼250,000- and 10-fold, respectively, supporting our previous proposal that the physiological substrate, succinyl-CoA, promotes a protein conformational change, which accelerates the conversion of the external aldimine into the initial quinonoid intermediate (Hunter, G. A., and Ferreira, G. C. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 12222–12228). Rapid scanning stopped-flow and quenched-flow kinetic analyses of the ALAS reaction under single turnover conditions lend evidence for two quinonoid reaction intermediates and a model of the ALAS kinetic mechanism in which product release is at least the partially rate-limiting step. Finally, the carbonyl and carboxylate groups of 5-aminolevulinate play a major protein-interacting role by inducing a conformational change in ALAS and, thus, possibly modulating product release. 5-Aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS), a pyridoxal 5′-phosphate-dependent enzyme, catalyzes the first, and regulatory, step of the heme biosynthetic pathway in nonplant eukaryotes and some bacteria. 5-Aminolevulinate synthase is a dimeric protein having an ordered kinetic mechanism with glycine binding before succinyl-CoA and with aminolevulinate release after CoA and carbon dioxide.

Moura J.G. Franco R. Iron Metabolism: Inorganic Biochemistry and Regulatory Mechanisms. Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany1999: 15-34Google Scholar). PLP-dependent enzymes have been classified according to different criteria (e.g. homology in sequence alignments in parallel with similar reaction specificity (C-α, C-β, or C-γ as the reactive C in the amino acid substrate) and, more recently, fold types derived from three-dimensional structures (8Alexander F.W. Sandmeier E. Mehta P.K. Christen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 953-960Google Scholar, 9Grishin N.V. Phillips M.A. Goldsmith E.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1291-1304Google Scholar, 10Schneider G. Kack H.

Biochem. 1994; 219: 953-960Google Scholar) or within class II of fold type I of the PLP-dependent enzyme superfamily (9Grishin N.V. Phillips M.A. Goldsmith E.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1291-1304Google Scholar, 10Schneider G. Kack H. Lindqvist Y. Structure Fold Des. 2000; 8: R1-R6Google Scholar). Alignment of the amino acid sequences of the α-oxoamine synthase enzymes reveals several functionally important, highly conserved residues, although these enzymes share low overall sequence identity (11Alexeev D. Alexeeva M. Baxter R.L. Campopiano D.J. Webster S.P. Sawyer L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 401-419Google Scholar). In addition, α-oxoamine synthase enzymes appear to possess similar catalytic mechanisms; thus, understanding the ALAS mechanistic pathway directly impacts on the mechanistic interpretation of all enzymes of the α-oxoamine synthase family. The results of the original radiolabeling studies withRhodobacter spheroides ALAS provided the critical information to develop a model of the ALAS catalytic reaction mechanism (Scheme FS1) (15Zaman Z. Jordan P.M. Akhtar M. Biochem. J. 1973; 135: 257-263Google Scholar, 16Abboud M.M. Jordan P.M. Akhtar M. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1974; : 643-644Google Scholar, 17Laghai A. Jordan P.M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1977; 5: 299-301Google Scholar). First, as with other PLP-dependent enzymes, a transaldimination reaction occurs between the substrate (glycine in the case of ALAS) and the internal aldimine, formed between the aldehyde group of PLP and an active site lysine residue. Following the transaldimination reaction and formation of the external aldimine, the pro-R proton of glycine is removed, yielding a transient quinonoid species in the presence of succinyl-CoA (17Laghai A. Jordan P.M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1977; 5: 299-301Google Scholar, 18Nandi D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 8872-8877Google Scholar, 19Hunter G.A. Ferreira G.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3711-3718Google Scholar, 20Hunter G.A. Ferreira G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12222-12228Google Scholar). This quinonoid intermediate reacts with succinyl-CoA to form, upon removal of the CoA group, an aldimine to α-amino-β-ketoadipate. Subsequently, cleavage of the C-α–carboxylate bond leads to a stabilized quinonoid intermediate (20Hunter G.A. Ferreira G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12222-12228Google Scholar). A proton is then returned to the C-5 position of the aldimine between PLP and ALA. Finally, the aldimine dissociates to yield ALA and the holoenzyme. ALAS functions as a homodimer; residues from both subunits contribute to the active site (21Tan D. Ferreira G.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8934-8941Google Scholar). Specifically, Lys313 of murine ALAS2 forms a Schiff base linkage with the PLP cofactor in the absence of the glycine substrate (22Ferreira G.C. Neame P.J. Dailey H.A. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1959-1965Google Scholar). Further, Lys313 is postulated to function as the catalytic base in the proton abstraction from the external aldimine intermediate to form the quinonoid intermediate (19Hunter G.A. Ferreira G.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3711-3718Google Scholar). Asp279 has been identified as a crucial residue in ALAS catalysis by enhancing the electron withdrawing capacity of the PLP cofactor through the stabilization of the protonated form of the PLP pyridinium ring nitrogen (23Gong J. Hunter G.A. Ferreira G.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3509-3517Google Scholar). In addition, Arg439 appears to play a role in recognition and binding of glycine through an ionic bond between its guanidinium side chain and the carboxylate of the glycine substrate (24Tan D. Harrison T. Hunter G.A. Ferreira G.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1478-1484Google Scholar). Although the α-oxoamine synthase enzymes are of central importance in the metabolism of heme, biotin, ceramides, and sphingolipids, their enzymatic mechanisms have not been completely resolved. The characteristic absorption spectral bands of the PLP cofactor and the covalent substrate-coenzyme intermediates make possible their spectroscopic monitoring. In addition, examining the formation of the three products (CoA, carbon dioxide, and ALA) can be instrumental in unraveling the reaction mechanism. With these observations in mind, we performed a series of pre-steady-state kinetic studies, involving stopped-flow spectroscopy and chemical quenched flow, in order to provide an in depth transient kinetic analysis aimed at defining the elementary steps of the ALAS reaction pathway and dissecting its rate-limiting step. Multiwavelength kinetics and global analysis of pre-steady-state (single turnover and multiturnover) kinetic data revealed 1) the presence of two quinonoid intermediates, 2) an over 250,000-fold increase in the glycine proton removal and formation of the first quinonoid intermediate in the presence of succinyl-CoA, and 3) that the rate-determining step of the overall reaction is dictated by the release of the ALA product. The following reagents were from Sigma: DEAE-Sephacel, β-mercaptoethanol, PLP, bovine serum albumin, acetoacetyl-CoA, succinyl-CoA, acetylacetone, ALA-hydrochloride, 5-aminopentanoate, HEPES-free acid, MOPS, Tricine, thiamin pyrophosphate, sodium oxalacetate, sodium pyruvate, porcine heart pyruvate dehydrogenase, Thermoplasma acidophilum citrate synthase, and the bicinchoninic acid protein determination kit. Ultrogel AcA-44 was obtained from IBF Biotechnics. Glycerol, glycine, disodium ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid dihydrate, ammonium sulfate, magnesium chloride hexahydrate, and potassium hydroxide were purchased from Fisher. SDS-PAGE reagents were supplied by Bio-Rad. Recombinant murine ALAS2 was overproduced and purified fromEscherichia coli DH5α cells harboring pGF23, an ALAS overexpression plasmid, as previously described (25Ferreira G.C. Dailey H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 585-590Google Scholar), with the following modifications of the purification procedure. The DEAE-Sephacel column (2.7 × 11 cm) was loaded with the protein sample collected from the Ultrogel AcA-44 column (2.8 × 38 cm) and washed with buffer A (20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, 20 μm PLP, 10% glycerol) until the collected protein fractions had values for absorbance at 280 nm lower than 0.1. The elution of ALAS from the DEAE-Sephacel column was with 120 ml of buffer A containing 75 mm potassium chloride. 2A. Cheltsov and G. C. Ferreira, unpublished data. The purified ALAS was concentrated by pressurized dialysis in an Amicon 8050 stir cell equipped with a YM30 membrane. The concentrated, purified ALAS protein, typically at concentration of 550–800 μm, was stored under liquid nitrogen in Nalgene 2.0-ml polypropylene cryovials until use. Protein purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) and was never less than 95%. Protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid method using serum albumin as a standard as described previously (23Gong J. Hunter G.A. Ferreira G.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3509-3517Google Scholar), and all protein concentrations are reported based on a subunit molecular mass of 56,000 Da. Enzymatic activity was determined using a continuous spectrophotometric assay as previously described (27Hunter G.A. Ferreira G.C. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 226: 221-224Google Scholar). Rapid scanning stopped-flow kinetic measurements were performed using a model RSM-1000 stopped-flow spectrophotometer (OLIS Inc.). This instrument has a 2-ms dead time, a 4.0-mm path length, and a thermostatted observation chamber. In general, scan spectra covering the wavelength range of 325–545 nm were collected at a rate of 1000 scans/s. For reactions longer than 5 s, the scan speed was adjusted to 62 scans/s to reduce data files to a manageable level. A fixed 0.6-mm slit was used to collect data. A circulating water bath controlled thermostatically at 20 or 30 °C was used to maintain the temperature of the loading syringes (containing the reactants) and the stopped-flow cell compartment. Reactant concentrations in the two loading syringes were 2-fold greater than the final concentrations in the observation chamber. (These final concentrations are reported in the figure legends). The reaction buffers for the experiments were 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 10% glycerol. Rate constants in the rapid scanning stopped-flow kinetic experiments were determined by Robust Global Fitting of the spectra using software provided by OLIS, Inc. (28Zhou X. Jin X. Medhekar R. Chen X. Dieckmann T. Toney M.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1367-1377Google Scholar, 29Sun S. Bagdassarian C.K. Toney M.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3876-3885Google Scholar, 30Matheson I.B.C. Comput. Chem. 1990; 14: 49-57Google Scholar, 31Beechem J. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 210: 37-54Google Scholar). For each concentration of ligand utilized, the data from at least five runs were averaged. In general, the substrate concentration dependences of the observed rate constants were fit to Equation 1 describing a one-step reaction (32Johnson K.A. Enzymes. 1992; 20: 1-61Google Scholar) using the nonlinear regression analysis program SigmaPlot. kobs=k1[S]+k­1(Eq. 1) Rapid chemical quenched flow experiments were performed using a SFM-400/Q mode quenched-flow apparatus (BioLogic Science Instruments), equipped with a circulating water bath to control the temperature of the reactants. Samples were aged following an interrupted flow and collected using a “partial liquid collection method” as programmed according to the manufacturer's manual. Reactions were initiated by mixing 70 μl of the enzyme (in 10 mm HEPES, 10% glycerol, pH 7.5) with 70 μl of the substrate(s). After transiently stored in the intermixer volume, 40 μl of enzyme and the substrate(s) were used to purge the intermixer volume, and then enzyme (30 μl) and substrate(s) (30 μl) were flowed through the intermixer volume. (In all cases, the concentrations of enzymes and substrates cited in the text are those after mixing and during the enzymatic reaction.) Reactions were quenched with 60 μl of 0.28 m perchloric acid at various aging times. Quenched samples were immediately transferred into ice, vortexed, and centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for 10 min and 4 °C. Protein pellets were discarded, and the supernatants were collected and stored at −70 °C until the next day's analysis. ALA concentration in the quenched samples (i.e. in 100 of 120 μl) was determined after the method of Lien and Beattie (33Lien L.-F. Beattie D.S. Enzyme (Basel). 1982; 28: 120-132Google Scholar) with a few modifications. Specifically, the ether extraction step was eliminated, and an extinction coefficient of 34.9 ± 0.4 mm−1 cm−1, estimated under the present assay conditions, was used to determine ALA concentration from the difference in absorbance at 552 and 650 nm. For the determination of CoA concentration in the quenched samples, we developed a new, rapid, spectrophotometric assay, involving the use of pyridine nucleotide-based enzymatic cycling to improve sensitivity. The general principle of the assay is the coupling of the pyruvate dehydrogenase- and citrate synthase-catalyzed reactions (Fig.1 A). Upon the oxidation of pyruvate, the generated NADH in the pyruvate dehydrogenase-catalyzed reaction is “amplified” through CoA enzymatic recycling. Simply, the citrate synthase-catalyzed condensation of acetyl-CoA with oxalacetate recycles the CoA used in the pyruvate dehydrogenase-catalyzed reaction, thus achieving a far higher analytical sensitivity to determine CoA concentration. To perform the assay, a 600-μl reaction mixture, containing 20 mm HEPES, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm NAD+, 0.2 mm thiamin pyrophosphate, 0.4 mm mercaptoethanol, 1 mmsodium oxalacetate, 10 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.15 unit/ml citrate synthase, 0.10 unit/ml pyruvate dehydrogenase, was prepared and incubated for 5 min at 30 °C. To this reaction mixture, in a 1-ml, 30 °C-thermostatted cuvette, a quenched sample (30 μl), previously neutralized with 8.4 μl of 0.5 m NaOH, was added, and the change in absorbance was monitored at 340 nm. Under these conditions and over the range of 0.1–2.0 μm CoA, the rate of NADH production is linearly dependent on CoA concentration (Fig.1 B). The amounts of CoA and ALA produced at different reaction (or aging) times were plotted against time and fitted, using the nonlinear least-squares regression analysis program Sigmaplot, to Equation 2 (32Johnson K.A. Enzymes. 1992; 20: 1-61Google Scholar), Pt=A(1−e−kbt)+kssE0t(Eq. 2) where P t represents the product concentration at an aging time t, A is the amplitude of the burst phase, k b is the burst rate constant,k ss is the steady-state rate constant, andE 0 is total enzyme concentration. Under pseudo-first-order reaction conditions, with the glycine concentration in excess of ALAS, the reaction of glycine with ALAS is accompanied by the formation of a species absorbing at 415 nm. Global analysis of all the absorbance changes data collected from 312 to 543 nm yielded the absorption spectra for the initial, intermediate, and final species and revealed that the reaction of glycine with ALAS follows a three-step process (Fig. 2). There are no major absorption spectral changes other than those at ∼415 nm. In fact, besides the increase in absorbance at 415 nm, the spectrum of the final species indicates just a slight red shift (to 422 nm) of this spectral band in relation to that of the initial species (Fig. 2 A). We assigned the three phases of the reaction of ALAS with glycine to 1) formation of the enzyme-substrate (Michaelis) complex, 2) formation of the external aldimine, and 3) abstraction of the glycinepro-R proton associated with the production of a carbanion/quinonoid intermediate (EQ1). Binding of glycine to ALAS yielded the Michaelis complex, in which the PLP cofactor still formed the internal aldimine. The spectrum of the species assigned as the Michaelis complex exhibited solely a small red shift of the absorbance band associated with the ALAS Schiff base linkage. The formation of the assigned external aldimine was accompanied by an increase in absorbance at 422 nm, as previously reported for the ALAS-glycine external aldimine (20Hunter G.A. Ferreira G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12222-12228Google Scholar), whereas the phase proposed to be associated with the proton removal from glycine virtually exhibited no shift in the 422-nm absorbance. The rates for the first two phases appear to be dependent on glycine concentration, with a clear sigmoidal dependence for phase 2, which suggests cooperativity between the two ALAS active sites (Fig. 2, B and C). In contrast to the rates for phases 1 and 2, the third phase rate is independent of glycine concentration (even as high as 150 mm) with a value of 0.0019 s−1 (Fig. 2, B–D). This value is in excellent agreement with the rate of 0.0022 s−1 determined for the ALAS-catalyzed removal of tritium from [2-3H2]glycine (19Hunter G.A. Ferreira G.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3711-3718Google Scholar). Previously, we reported that in the presence of succinyl-CoA there is an over 90-fold rate increase in the reaction of ALAS with glycine. We proposed that succinyl-CoA promotes this rise in the rate constant by inducing a conformational change of ALAS toward a “closed conformation,” wherein the condensation between glycine and succinyl-CoA occurs (20Hunter G.A. Ferreira G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12222-12228Google Scholar). In an effort to understand the role of succinyl-CoA in promoting the reaction of glycine with ALAS, we analyzed this reaction in the presence of acetoacetyl-CoA. We reasoned that acetoacetyl-CoA, with the same C-chain length as succinyl-CoA and with an oxo function at the C-3 position, would sustain, albeit to a lower extent, a change in ALAS conformation. The results in Fig.3 indicate this to be the case. Since, at glycine concentrations lower than 80 mm, the small amplitude associated with the different phase rates resulted in low signal to noise ratios, all of the reactions were for glycine concentrations equal or higher than 80 mm (Fig. 3). The global analysis of the data for the reaction of 60 μmALAS with 250 mm glycine plus 30 μmacetoacetyl-CoA at pH 7.5 and 30 °C reveals that the rates for the first and second steps of the three-step kinetic process are of the same order of magnitude as those for the reaction of ALAS with only glycine (Fig. 3 B versus Fig. 2, B andC), suggesting that acetoacetyl-CoA does not have a significant effect on the formation of either the enzyme-glycine (Michaelis) complex or the external aldimine. In contrast, the rate of the third phase, which we assigned to correspond to the proton extraction from glycine, was raised at least 10-fold (Fig.3 C versus Fig. 2 C). Taken together, these results suggest that acetoacetyl-CoA binding can induce a conformational change in ALAS, leading to the appropriate positioning of the catalytic base for the glycine proton abstraction. When ALAS (60 μm) was reacted with ALA (2.0 mm) for 15 s at pH 7.5 and 30 °C, there was an increase in the absorbance of the 515-nm species. ALA concentration was required to be greater than 0.4 mm in order to have enough enzyme to yield measurable changes in absorbance and yet maintain pseudo-first order conditions. Global fitting of the data for the 15-s reaction revealed four kinetically discernible species (Fig. 4 A). The rate constant for the first of the three-phase kinetic process did not exceed 7 s−1 (Fig. 4 B), and we proposed that this step is the transformation of the Michaelis complex (ALA-ALAS) into the enzyme-ALA external aldimine, possessing the 422-nm absorbance maximum as the major spectral feature. Indeed, the spectrum of the first kinetic species (Fig. 4 A) is distinct from that of the ALAS holoenzyme (which was actually identified as the first kinetically competent species in the reaction of ALAS with glycine and identical to that of the proposed ALAS-glycine Michaelis complex (Fig.2 A)). Thus, it appears that in the reaction of ALAS with ALA, the initial species corresponds to the ALAS-ALA complex, and its formation is terminated within the dead time of the stopped-flow instrument. The absorbance features of species 3 reveal those of a quinonoid intermediate, and the kinetics associated with its synthesis exhibit saturation with ALA with a maximum rate constant equal to 1.77 ± 0.01 s−1 (Fig. 4 C). The fourth kinetically competent species appears to be a quinonoid intermediate, and the rate constant governing this third kinetic step is virtually independent of ALA concentration, with an approximate value of 0.17 s−1 (Fig. 4 D). Whereas the reaction of ALAS with ALA is dominated by the quinonoid intermediate (EQ2) formation, the reaction of the enzyme with glycine is more recalcitrant to the delivery of the initial quinonoid intermediate (EQ1). Only the presence of the succinyl-CoA substrate brings the rate of EQ1 production to levels amenable for overall ALA biosynthesis. The differences between the glycine and ALA structures lie in the acyl chain length and a carbonyl group in ALA. To test whether the increased lability of the ALA C-5 position could be due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the adjacent carbonyl group, the reaction of ALAS with 5-aminopentanoate, in which the 4-carbonyl group of ALA has been replaced with a methylene group, was examined using rapid scanning stopped-flow spectroscopy at pH 7.5 and 30 °C (Fig.5). Global fitting data analysis for the first 10 s of the reaction from 312 to 543 nm demonstrated two kinetically competent species with absorbance maxima at 420 nm (Fig.5 A), which were interconverted through a monophasic, exponential process. The observed rates were linearly dependent on 5-aminopentanoate concentration, and the data were fit to Equation 1, yielding values of 0.041 ± 0.001 mm−1s−1 and 0.25 ± 0.03 s−1 fork 1 and k −1, respectively (Fig. 5 B). The k −1 value determined from the global data fitting is, however, ∼0.021 s−1(Fig. 5 C). The higher value for k −1(0.25 s−1) as the intercept on the y axis (Fig.5 B), as dictated in Equation 1, is probably associated with the larger error from inferring k −1. Thus, the dissociation constant, K d, is about 0.51 mm and is lower than that of glycine for ALAS, previously reported to be 22 mm (23Gong J. Hunter G.A. Ferreira G.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3509-3517Google Scholar). In contrast to this 43-fold decrease, the dissociation constant of 5-aminopentanoate from ALAS is 20-fold greater than that of ALA (23Gong J. Hunter G.A. Ferreira G.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3509-3517Google Scholar), suggesting that the carbon chain length and a carboxyl group are key elements to induce the ALAS conformational change. To explore the events occurring at the active site and dissect the rate-limiting step, we performed chemical quenched-flow experiments to look for a pre-steady-state burst of product formation. Initially, we monitored CoA formation, since CoA is the first product to be released in the proposed ALAS reaction pathway (Scheme FS1). To this end, we developed a new rapid and sensitive assay for CoA detection, which was based on coupling the reactions catalyzed by pyruvate dehydrogenase and citrate synthase (Fig. 1 A). Increased sensitivity in the assay was attained through pyridine-nucleotide amplification, which, in turn, was directly coupled with CoA-utilizing reactions (Fig. 1 A). Control experiments indicated that detection of CoA is l"

Here we report the identification of two distinct NF1-containing complexes, one in the soluble and the other in the particulate fraction of HeLa extract. We show that the soluble NF1 complex delineates a large holo-NF1 complex (2 MDa) encompassing the components of a smaller particulate core-NF1 complex (400 kDa). Purification of the core-NF1 complex followed by mass spectrometric analysis revealed the motor protein, kinesin-1 heavy chain (HsuKHC/KIF5B), as a catalytic subunit of both NF-1-containing complexes.

For detection of the NF2 protein, affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies sc331 (A-19) and sc332 (C-18) raised against synthetic peptides corresponding to the NH2 terminus and the COOH terminus of the NF2 protein were used (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For detection of the kinesin-1 protein, one polyclonal antibody raised against the insert 1 region of the head of human uKHC (KIF5B) (gift from Ronald D. Vale's laboratory) and two monoclonal antibodies H1 and H2 raised against bovine brain kinesin (Chemicon International, Inc.) were used.Protein Identification Using Liquid Chromatography-MS/MSGel bands were excised from colloidal Coomassie-stained gels, and bands were destained, alkylated with iodoacetamide, and digested using modified trypsin (Promega) for 16 h at 37 °C essentially. A portion of the extracted peptides were loaded to a nanocapillary reverse-phase 75-μm column terminating in a nanospray 15-μm tip (New Objective) packed with Porous R2 resin (Applied Biosystems). The nanocolumn was directly coupled to a ThermoFinnigan LCQ quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer, and peptides were eluted into the mass spectrometer using an acetic acid-acetonitrile gradient. Data were acquired using triple play mode to automatically obtain peptide masses, peptide charge states, and MS/MS spectra. The resulting data were searched against the non-redundant NCBI using the TurboSEQUEST Browser to identify proteins.Preparation of the Soluble and Particulate Fractions from HeLa Cells or Calf BrainThe method of Dignam et al. (16Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9140) Google Scholar) was used to prepare soluble or particulate fractions from HeLa cells and Calf brain. First, viable cells are prepared and collected in a conical test tube by centrifuging. Next, cells are resuspended in hypotonic buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.2 mm PMSF) that causes them to swell, thus making them easy to lyse. The outer membranes are disrupted by homogenization, and the soluble fraction is then collected after pelleting membrane debris. The particulate fraction is carefully resuspended in buffer B (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF). Following further homogenization and pelleting of the nuclear membrane debris, the particulate fraction is collected.Chromatographic Purification of NF1 Complex from HeLa Cells or Calf BrainHeLa Particulate FractionHeLa particulate extract (3 g) was loaded on a 500-ml column of phosphocellulose (P11, Whatman) and fractionated stepwise by the indicated KCl concentration in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10 mm βME, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mm PMSF). The P11 0.3 m KCl fraction (700 mg) was loaded on a 80-ml DEAE-Sephacel column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with 0.5 m KCl in buffer A. The 0.5 mKCl elution (500 mg) was dialyzed to 10 mmKxPO4 in buffer B (5 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, 10 μmCaCl2, 10% glycerol, 40 mm KCl) and loaded on a 70-ml Bio-Gel HT column (hydroxyapatite, Bio-Rad). The column was resolved by using a linear 10-column volume gradient of 50–500 mm KxPO4. A pool of the fractions 11–13 were dialyzed to 700 mm NH4SO4 in buffer HB (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 4 mm DTT, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm PMSF) and loaded on a butyl-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). The column was resolved using a linear 10-column volume gradient of 700 to 0 mm NH4SO4 in buffer HB. NF1-containing fractions 11–15 were dialyzed to 100 mm KCl in buffer A and loaded on Heparine-5PW (Tosohaas). The column was resolved using a linear 20-column volume gradient of 100–500 mm KCl in buffer A. The fractions 12–14 were used for the immunoaffinity purification of the NF1-containing complex.Calf Brain Particulate FractionCalf brain particulate fraction (1 g) was loaded on a 500-ml column of phosphocellulose (P11, Whatman) and fractionated stepwise by the indicated KCl concentration in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.2 mmEDTA, 10 mm βME, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mm PMSF). The P11 0.5 m KCl fraction (700 mg) was loaded on an 80-ml DEAE-Sephacel column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with 0.5m KCl. 60 mg of the 0.5 m KCl elution was dialyzed to 700 mm NH4SO4 in buffer HB (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 4 mm DTT, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm PMSF) and loaded on a butyl-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). The column was resolved using a linear 10-column volume gradient of 700 to 0 mm NH4SO4 in buffer HB. NF1-containing fractions 10–14 were dialyzed to 100 mm KCl in buffer A and loaded on Heparine-5PW (Tosohaas). The column was resolved using a linear 20-column volume gradient of 100–500 mm KCl in buffer A. The fractions 10–16 were used for the immunoaffinity purification of the NF1-containing complex.Immunoaffinity Purification of the NF1-containing ComplexAnti-NF1 antibodies (500 μg, COOH-terminal, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-68) were cross-linked to protein A-Sepharose (1 ml, Repligen) using standard techniques for affinity purification. The heparin fractions from HeLa cells and calf brain were incubated with 1 ml of antibody-protein A beads for 4–5 h at 4 °C in buffer A. The beads were washed with 1 m KCl and 1% Nonidet P-40 in buffer A. The beads were then washed with 100 mm KCl in buffer A, and the proteins were eluted with 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.5, and neutralized with 0.10 volume 1.0 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0.DISCUSSSIONKinesin-1 is a tetramer consisting of two 120-kDa heavy chains (KHC) and two 64-kDa light chains (KLC). Kinesin-1 heavy chain HsuKHC/KIF5B belongs to the kinesin protein superfamily (KIF) (19Miki H. Setou M. Kaneshiro K. Hirokawa N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7004-7011Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). This family has been shown to transport protein complexes, organelles, and mRNA to specific destinations in an ATP- and microtubule-dependent manner (20Hirokawa N.

Furthermore, some members of this family are also involved in chromosomal and spindle movements during mitosis and meiosis (22Sharp D.J. Rogers G.C. Scholey J.M.

Although a stable association of kinesin-1 and NF1 or NF2 was an unexpected finding, it is consistent with previous microscopy studies indicating the subcellular localization of NF1 and NF2 with the cytoskeleton (17Li C. Cheng Y. Gutmann D.A. Mangoura D. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 2001; 130: 231-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar,24Gregory P.E. Gutmann D.H. Mitchell A. Park S. Boguski M. Jacks T. Wood D.L.

Taken together, the association of NF1 and NF2 with the motor protein kinesin-1 suggests a role for these proteins in microtubule-mediated intracellular signal transduction pathways.Recent studies have shown that the axonal transport of amyloid precursor protein (APP) in neurons is mediated by the direct biochemical interaction between APP and KLC, the light chain subunit of kinesin-1 (28Kamal A.

Goldstein L.S. Nature. 2001; 414: 643-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Considering that microtubule-dependent trafficking requires at least two entities, a cargo-bound receptor and the motor proteins, the authors proposed that APP may be a membrane cargo receptor for a kinesin-mediated axonal transport of β-secretase and presenilin-1 (29Kamal A. Almenar-Queralt A. LeBlanc J.F. Roberts E.A. Goldstein L.S. Nature. 2001; 414: 643-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). In analogy with this model, the association between kinesin-1 and NF1 or NF2 might reflect a new function for these proteins in transport of vesicular cargoes within cells. Although NF1 has several known functions, including Ras GTPase-activating protein activity (8Ballester R. Marchuk D. Boguski M. Saulino A. Letcher R. Wigler M. Collins F.

Thus aberrant kinesin-1/NF1-mediated trafficking or transport of neurotransmitter containing vesicle may affect the normal development of the cerebral cortex. Future studies are needed to test this hypothesis rigorously. In conclusion, our data through the demonstration of a stable association of NF1 and NF2 proteins with the motor protein kinesin-1 identifies a common pathway underlying the mechanism of neurofibromatosis.

Vale's laboratory) and two monoclonal antibodies H1 and H2 raised against bovine brain kinesin (Chemicon International, Inc.) were used.Protein Identification Using Liquid Chromatography-MS/MSGel bands were excised from colloidal Coomassie-stained gels, and bands were destained, alkylated with iodoacetamide, and digested using modified trypsin (Promega) for 16 h at 37 °C essentially. A portion of the extracted peptides were loaded to a nanocapillary reverse-phase 75-μm column terminating in a nanospray 15-μm tip (New Objective) packed with Porous R2 resin (Applied Biosystems). The nanocolumn was directly coupled to a ThermoFinnigan LCQ quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer, and peptides were eluted into the mass spectrometer using an acetic acid-acetonitrile gradient. Data were acquired using triple play mode to automatically obtain peptide masses, peptide charge states, and MS/MS spectra. The resulting data were searched against the non-redundant NCBI using the TurboSEQUEST Browser to identify proteins.Preparation of the Soluble and Particulate Fractions from HeLa Cells or Calf BrainThe method of Dignam et al. (16Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9140) Google Scholar) was used to prepare soluble or particulate fractions from HeLa cells and Calf brain. First, viable cells are prepared and collected in a conical test tube by centrifuging. Next, cells are resuspended in hypotonic buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.2 mm PMSF) that causes them to swell, thus making them easy to lyse. The outer membranes are disrupted by homogenization, and the soluble fraction is then collected after pelleting membrane debris. The particulate fraction is carefully resuspended in buffer B (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF). Following further homogenization and pelleting of the nuclear membrane debris, the particulate fraction is collected.Chromatographic Purification of NF1 Complex from HeLa Cells or Calf BrainHeLa Particulate FractionHeLa particulate extract (3 g) was loaded on a 500-ml column of phosphocellulose (P11, Whatman) and fractionated stepwise by the indicated KCl concentration in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10 mm βME, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mm PMSF). The P11 0.3 m KCl fraction (700 mg) was loaded on a 80-ml DEAE-Sephacel column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with 0.5 m KCl in buffer A. The 0.5 mKCl elution (500 mg) was dialyzed to 10 mmKxPO4 in buffer B (5 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, 10 μmCaCl2, 10% glycerol, 40 mm KCl) and loaded on a 70-ml Bio-Gel HT column (hydroxyapatite, Bio-Rad). The column was resolved by using a linear 10-column volume gradient of 50–500 mm KxPO4. A pool of the fractions 11–13 were dialyzed to 700 mm NH4SO4 in buffer HB (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 4 mm DTT, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm PMSF) and loaded on a butyl-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). The column was resolved using a linear 10-column volume gradient of 700 to 0 mm NH4SO4 in buffer HB. NF1-containing fractions 11–15 were dialyzed to 100 mm KCl in buffer A and loaded on Heparine-5PW (Tosohaas). The column was resolved using a linear 20-column volume gradient of 100–500 mm KCl in buffer A. The fractions 12–14 were used for the immunoaffinity purification of the NF1-containing complex.Calf Brain Particulate FractionCalf brain particulate fraction (1 g) was loaded on a 500-ml column of phosphocellulose (P11, Whatman) and fractionated stepwise by the indicated KCl concentration in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.2 mmEDTA, 10 mm βME, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mm PMSF). The P11 0.5 m KCl fraction (700 mg) was loaded on an 80-ml DEAE-Sephacel column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with 0.5m KCl. 60 mg of the 0.5 m KCl elution was dialyzed to 700 mm NH4SO4 in buffer HB (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 4 mm DTT, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm PMSF) and loaded on a butyl-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). The column was resolved using a linear 10-column volume gradient of 700 to 0 mm NH4SO4 in buffer HB. NF1-containing fractions 10–14 were dialyzed to 100 mm KCl in buffer A and loaded on Heparine-5PW (Tosohaas). The column was resolved using a linear 20-column volume gradient of 100–500 mm KCl in buffer A. The fractions 10–16 were used for the immunoaffinity purification of the NF1-containing complex.Immunoaffinity Purification of the NF1-containing ComplexAnti-NF1 antibodies (500 μg, COOH-terminal, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-68) were cross-linked to protein A-Sepharose (1 ml, Repligen) using standard techniques for affinity purification. The heparin fractions from HeLa cells and calf brain were incubated with 1 ml of antibody-protein A beads for 4–5 h at 4 °C in buffer A. The beads were washed with 1 m KCl and 1% Nonidet P-40 in buffer A. The beads were then washed with 100 mm KCl in buffer A, and the proteins were eluted with 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.5, and neutralized with 0.10 volume 1.0 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Western Blot AnalysisFor detection of the NF1 protein, affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies sc-68 (NF1GRP-D) raised against synthetic peptides corresponding to the carboxyl terminal domain of the human NF1 gene product were used (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).

Recently, we demonstrated that there are two factors produced by activated CD8+ T-cells capable of inhibiting the X4 strain HIV-1IIIB (16Geiben-Lynn R. Kursar M. Brown N. Kerr E. Luster A. Walker B. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 8306-8316Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These factors are distinctive in size and the ability to bind heparin. One of these factors bound heparin at physiological salt concentration, eluted at 350 mm NaCl, and was retained by a 50-kDa cut-off Centricon filter. The other factor did not bind heparin at physiological salt concentration and was filtered through a 50-kDa cut-off Centricon filter. The HIV-1 inhibitory activity of these factors was higher with bulk CD8+ T-cells of seropositive individuals and HIV-1-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL) compared with bulk CD8+T-cells of HIV-1-seronegative individuals (16Geiben-Lynn R. Kursar M. Brown N. Kerr E. Luster A. Walker B. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 8306-8316Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In the present study we identified the heparin binding inhibitory activity as a CD8+ T-cell modified form of antithrombin, which is produced in higher amounts by HIV-1-specific CTL and bulk CD8+ T-cells of seropositive individuals than by bulk CD8+ T-cells of seronegative individuals. In this study for the first time we demonstrate that CD8+ T-cells can activate a serum protein to become inhibitory for HIV, a possibility that has not been addressed previously. Polyclonal CD8+ cells that were 90–99% CD3+- and CD8+-positive were generated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting from the six seronegative and six HIV-1-seropositive long-term nonprogressors by positive selection with anti-CD8 antibody-coated immunomagnetic beads (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) as described (16Geiben-Lynn R. Kursar M. Brown N. Kerr E. Luster A. Walker B. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 8306-8316Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). HIV-1-specific CTL clones were used as described (16Geiben-Lynn R. Kursar M. Brown N. Kerr E. Luster A. Walker B. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 8306-8316Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Bulk CD8+ cell lines from seropositive and seronegative persons were established by incubating purified CD8+ cells (2 × 106) with 2 × 107 irradiated allogeneic feeder cells (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) and 0.25 μg of phytohemagglutinin (Murex, Dartford, UK)/ml for 3 days. Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Sigma) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Sigma), 10 mmHEPES, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units of penicillin/ml, 10 μg of streptomycin/ml, and 50 units of interleukin-2/ml (R10-50). After 2 weeks, 0.5 × 106 cells/ml were stimulated by using CD3 cross-linking in a 1:4 ratio of cells to goat anti-mouse antibody-coated beads (PerSeptive Biosystems) saturated with a mouse anti-human 12F6 CD3 antibody (17Yang O.O. Kalams S.A. Trocha A. Cao H. Luster A. Johnson R.P. Walker B.D. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 3120-3128Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (2 μg of antibody/106 cells). The supernatant fluid was harvested after 4 h by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 10 min. The serum-free medium contained 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma). Human T cells and H9 cell line were acutely infected with X4 HIV-1IIIB, human macrophage-like PMI cells were infected with R5 HIV-1JR-CSF, and macaque T-cell line CEM-174 was infected with SIV-239 or SHIVKU-1 at a multiplicity of infection of 10−2 TCID50/ml and resuspended in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 20% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (R20). The cells were then plated in 2 ml of R20 at 5 × 105 cells/ml in a 24-well plate. Cell supernatant (1 ml) was removed every 3 days and replaced with medium supplemented with fractions (10–100 μl) of the eluates of the purification process or antithrombin. After 9 days the concentration of p24 for the HIV-1 or p27 antigen for the SIV and SHIV strains were measured with an HIV-1 p24 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (ELISA; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) or SIV core antigen ELISA kit (Beckman-Coulter, Miami, FL). The percentage inhibition was calculated against the medium control, which had p24 or p27 levels of >100 ng/ml after 9 days of testing. After 4 h, CD3 antibody stimulation at 37 °C supernatant was collected, centrifuged, and applied to a heparin-Sepharose column (5-ml HiTrap heparin-Sepharose column, Amersham Biosciences). The column was eluted with a continuous gradient to 1 m NaCl in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) as described earlier (16Geiben-Lynn R. Kursar M. Brown N. Kerr E. Luster A. Walker B. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 8306-8316Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Inhibitory fractions were pooled and concentrated with a Centricon 50-kDa cut-off centrifugal concentrator. The sample was applied to a Superdex 200 column (3.2 × 300 mm, Amersham Biosciences), and active 40-kDa fractions were collected as described earlier (16Geiben-Lynn R. Kursar M. Brown N. Kerr E. Luster A. Walker B. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 8306-8316Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). After the heparin-Sepharose column, the inhibitory activity was purified 215 times, and after the Superdex 200 column 909 times (16Geiben-Lynn R. Kursar M. Brown N. Kerr E. Luster A. Walker B. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 8306-8316Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Fractions that inhibited HIV-1 were applied to a Vydac RP-4 HPLC column equilibrated with H2O and 0.1% trifluroacetic acid and tested for purity. Bound protein was eluted with a gradient of acetonitrile in trifluroacetic acid as described earlier (18Van Patten S.M. Hanson E. Bernasconi R. Zhang K. Manavalan P. Cole E.S. McPherson J.M. Edmunds T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10268-10276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Additionally, the purity of the 40-kDa Superdex 200 eluates was assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) with silver staining (16Geiben-Lynn R. Kursar M. Brown N. Kerr E. Luster A. Walker B. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 8306-8316Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The protein concentration of the eluates were determined by the bicinchoninic acid method according to the manufacturer's procedure (Pierce). Fractions with >95% purity as tested by C4-HPLC and silver staining were used for the inhibition tests to determine the ID50 (concentration (μg/ml) of protein necessary for 50% decrease of virus antigen measured by ELISA). For amino acid sequencing following separation of the 40-kDa Superdex eluates by SDS-PAGE, the gel was treated with transfer buffer and blotted onto nitrocellulose paper (19Euhus D.M. Gupta R.K. Morton D.L. Int. J. Cancer. 1990; 45: 1065-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). After blotting the nitrocellulose paper was stained with Ponceau Red (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's procedure. The 43-kDa protein stain was cut out and digested with trypsin (Sigma). The tryptic digest microsequence analysis was done by reverse-phase HPLC nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry (μLC/MS/MS) on a Finnigan LCQ quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer. Commercially available ATIII (human or bovine, 0.2–0.4 units/μg, Sigma), which is purified by heparin-sulfate binding (1 M NaCl eluates), contained the “stressed” (S) configuration. To determine which form of ATIII is capable of inhibiting HIV-1, we further produced a relaxed (R), pre-latent and two latent (L) forms of ATIII from the S form. The R form (Fig.2 A) was produced by incubating S bovine or human antithrombin with porcine pancreatic elastase (Calbiochem) as described (20O'Reilly M.S. Pirie-Shepherd S. Lane W.S. Folkman J. Science. 1999; 285: 1926-1928Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), and the pre-latent form was produced as described earlier (21Larsson H. Akerud P. Nordling K. Raub-Segall E. Claesson-Welsh L. Bjork I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11996-12002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The two different L forms of ATIII were produced by incubating S antithrombin with 0.9 m guanidine (22Carrell R.W. Evans D.L. Stein P.E. Nature. 1991; 353: 576-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) or in 0.25 mm trisodium citrate at 60 °C for 18 h (23Wardell M.R. Chang W.S. Bruce D. Skinner R. Lesk A.M. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13133-13142Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). After incubation, each L form was dialyzed three times against a 1000× volume of phosphate-buffered saline. The NH2-terminal heparin binding site of S ATIII was cleaved through partial digestion as described (24Liu C.S. Chang J.Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 167: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) using an immobilized V-8 protease kit (Pierce) for 1 h at 4 °C. The standard error is shown by error bars. We purified to homogeneity with a purification factor of 909× (16Geiben-Lynn R. Kursar M. Brown N. Kerr E. Luster A. Walker B. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 8306-8316Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) the earlier described 40-kDa (gel filtration) heparin binding HIV-1 inhibitory activity (16Geiben-Lynn R. Kursar M. Brown N. Kerr E. Luster A. Walker B. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 8306-8316Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) found in activated CD8+ T-cell supernatants from HIV-specific CTL clones or bulk CD8+ T-cells. This HIV-1 inhibitory activity, purified using heparin-Sepharose and Superdex 200 size exclusion chromatography, showed one protein peak by C4-HPLC (Fig.1 a). The fractions from the Superdex 200 column that contained anti-HIV-1 activity were pooled, analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and silver-stained under reducing and nonreducing conditions, which revealed a single molecular species migrating at 43 kDa (Fig. 1 b). The ID50of these eluates was 5.5 μg/ml (16Geiben-Lynn R. Kursar M. Brown N. Kerr E. Luster A. Walker B. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 8306-8316Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Microsequence analysis by reverse-phase HPLC nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry of the tryptic digest revealed the identity of bovine antithrombin III (ATIII), which suggests that activated CD8+ T-cell of seropositive individuals or HIV-specific CTL clones can modify this serum protein. The 24 different peptides sequenced (shown in bold type in Fig. 1 c) were identical to bovine antithrombin III. Having identified a form of bovine ATIII as an inhibitor of HIV-1 replication, we determined which of the described forms of ATIII is able to inhibit HIV-1. We therefore investigated whether native or enzymatically modified forms of ATIII can inhibit HIV-1 replication. Under physiological conditions, ATIII exists in different forms. ATIII circulates in a quiescent L form, in which its reactive COOH-terminal loop is not fully exposed and cannot bind target proteins. When ATIII binds to heparin, however, a stressed confirmation, the S form, is induced exposing the reactive COOH-terminal loop and increasing thrombin binding affinity by 100-fold. The thrombin-ATIII complex then slowly dissociates, and the reactive loop of ATIII is cleaved by the released thrombin. The cleaved ATIII consists of disulfide-bonded A and B chains and does not bind target proteases. Additionally, this cleavage induces a conformational change to a relaxed, R form, in which the reactive loop is irreversibly inserted into an A-β sheet (25Schreuder H.A. de Boer B. Dijkema R. Mulders J. Theunissen H.J. Grootenhuis P.D. Hol W.G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). An R form of ATIII was purified based on its antiangiogenetic activity capable of inhibiting tumor growth. This form of ATIII is cleaved between Ser386 and Thr387 and can be generated by digesting with porcine elastase (20O'Reilly M.S. Pirie-Shepherd S. Lane W.S. Folkman J. Science. 1999; 285: 1926-1928Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Other enzymes can cleave ATIII and produce additional R forms such as thrombin (Arg394–Ser395), pancreatic elastase (Val388–Iso389) and human neutrophil elastase (Iso391–Ala392) (26Evans D.L. Marshall C.J. Christey P.B. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12629-12642Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 27Mourey L. Samama J.P. Delarue M. Petitou M. Choay J. Moras D. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 223-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). A “pre-latent” antithrombin with anti-angiogenic activity has also been described in which the antithrombin activity and a high heparin binding affinity are preserved (21Larsson H. Akerud P. Nordling K. Raub-Segall E. Claesson-Welsh L. Bjork I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11996-12002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To determine which form of ATIII is capable of inhibiting HIV-1, we produced the R (Fig.2 A, lane 1), pre-latent, and L forms of ATIII from a commercially available S form (Fig. 2A, lane 2) and tested their ability to inhibit HIV and SIV/SHIV. We found that the R form of antithrombin inhibited X4 virus with half-maximal inhibition (ID50) at ∼25 μg/ml. The S form was even more potent and had an ID50 of 10 μg/ml (∼3 units/ml) (Fig. 2 B). This is similar to the ID50 (5.5 μg/ml, 130 nm) we found for the CD8+ T-cell-modified antithrombin purified from CTL-conditioned medium and also to the ID50 (89 nm) found for SDF-1 using the same in vitrosystem (16Geiben-Lynn R. Kursar M. Brown N. Kerr E. Luster A. Walker B. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 8306-8316Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). No substantial inhibition of the R form (suppression <25%) was found for the R5 virus tested (Fig. 2 B). The S form inhibited SIV and SHIV replication 92 and 91%, respectively, at a concentration of 50 μg/ml (∼15 units/ml). The R form inhibited these strains to a lesser extent (36 and 57%, respectively) (Fig.2 C). Although the pre-latent form was effective in inhibiting X4 HIV replication, all L forms tested at up to 50 μg/ml had no inhibitory activity (Fig. 3). We also tested these various forms of ATIII for heat and enzyme sensitivity and found that both the S and R forms were heat-stable (95 °C, 10 min or 60 °C, 30 min) under physiological salt conditions (Fig. 3). We also found that partial V8 protease digestion, which specifically cleaves the heparin binding site (24Liu C.S. Chang J.Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 167: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), decreases the activity of the S form (Fig. 3), suggesting that this heparin binding domain is important for inhibition. We also found that bovine and human ATIII have a similar profile of inhibitory activity (data not shown). In summary, our data indicate that the purified CD8+T-cell-modified form of ATIII is a unique form of ATIII with respect to size, heparin affinity, heat stability, and HIV inhibitory activity. To exclude the toxic effects of ATIII in the HIV-1 inhibition assay, we analyzed the effects of the various ATIII preparations on cell growth and cell viability. These forms of ATIII used were not toxic to the H9 CD4+ T cells used for the inhibition tests and did not affect cell viability or growth as measured by trypan blue dye exclusion staining (data not shown), which is consistent with previous reports (20O'Reilly M.S. Pirie-Shepherd S. Lane W.S. Folkman J. Science. 1999; 285: 1926-1928Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). In contrast to activated CTL supernatants or CD8+ T-cells supernatant of HIV-1 seropositive individuals, serum-containing medium alone and supernatants from unstimulated CD8+ T-cells grown in serum-containing medium did not substantially inhibit HIV-1IIIB replication (suppression <25%) even when applied to the heparin-Sepharose column. The activity of CD8+ T-cells in HIV-1-seronegative individuals was below 10% inhibition after Superdex 200 gel filtration. Additionally, using untreated serum or supernatants from HIV-1-seronegative individuals, the 43-kDa form of ATIII was not detected following heparin-Sepharose chromatography and Superdex 200 chromatography by either SDS-PAGE silver staining or C4-HPLC (data not shown). These data strongly suggest that activated CD8+ T-cells of HIV-1-seropositive individuals modify ATIII into a form that is capable of inhibiting HIV-1. Because unprocessed ATIII is a glycoprotein with a molecular mass of 53–58 kDa, where 10% of the weight is glucosamine-based carbohydrate chains, and because the form of ATIII we purified with HIV-1 inhibitory activity migrates at 43 kDa by SDS-PAGE or 40 kDa by gel filtration, this led us to hypothesize that activated HIV-specific CTL or CD8+ T-cells of HIV-1-seropositive individuals modify ATIII into a form with HIV-1 inhibitory activity. To test the hypothesis that the heparin binding anti-HIV-1 activity is produced through the modification of ATIII by a heparin nonbinding activity released by activated CD8+ T-cells, CD8+ T-cells were stimulated in serum-free medium and the supernatant was tested for suppressive activity. We found no HIV-1 inhibitory activity in the heparin-bound fractions (data not shown). However, there was still measurable inhibitory activity in the unfractionated supernatants that contained no serum (Fig.4) when added to an HIV-1 inhibition assay that contained serum, suggesting that the non-heparin binding inhibitory factor was still released when CTL were cultured without serum proteins. To confirm that the non-heparin binding inhibitory activity modifies serum proteins, we tested the inhibitory activity of medium containing twice the amount of serum, reasoning that this would double the amount of substrate. Increasing the amount of fetal bovine serum proteins from 10 to 20% (v/v) doubled the inhibitory activity for both M- and T-tropic HIV (Fig. 4), suggesting that serum protein is responsible for the CTL antiviral activity and that CTL modify this serum protein. We purified a form of bovine ATIII activated by HIV-1-specific CTL and bulk CD8+ T-cells of seropositive individuals that is ∼10 kDa smaller than unprocessed ATIII as an inhibitor of HIV-1 replication, and as such, we identified a novel biological activity for ATIII. We demonstrated that the previously described S, R, and pre-latent forms of ATIII inhibited HIV-1, whereas the L form did not. The HIV-1 inhibitory activity of the S, R, and pre-latent ATIII was heat-stable. We also demonstrated that there is another factor produced by activated CTL that generates this modified form of ATIII and speculated that this might be the <50-kDa HIV-1 inhibitory factor that we had described previously (16Geiben-Lynn R. Kursar M. Brown N. Kerr E. Luster A. Walker B. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 8306-8316Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The failure of bulk CD8+T-cells of seronegative individuals to produce this activity in equal amounts might be the result of a less activated or more naive population of CD8+ T cells from seronegative individuals (16Geiben-Lynn R. Kursar M. Brown N. Kerr E. Luster A. Walker B. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 8306-8316Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), resulting in the production of less factor able to modify ATIII. To date, the search for the elusive CAF has focused on CD8+T-cells secreted factors. For the first time we have demonstrated that CD8+ T cells can activate a serum protein to become inhibitory for HIV. Proteolytic processing with an increase of HIV-1 inhibitory activity has been demonstrated for the chemokine MDC (monocyte-derived chemokine), which is cleaved at its NH2terminus by CD26/dipeptidyl-peptidase IV (28Proost P. Struyf S. Schols D. Opdenakker G. Sozzani S. Allavena P. Mantovani A. Augustyns K. Bal G. Haemers A. Lambeir A.M. Scharpe S. Van Damme J. De Meester I. J. Biol.

The modification of serum ATIII that we have described remains unresolved, and it seems plausible that part of CAF might in fact be a protease. There is a growing body of evidence that ATIII has biological activity in addition to its functions in the coagulation cascade. For example, ATIII has anti-inflammatory activity in sepsis (31Souter P.J. Thomas S. Hubbard A.R. Poole S. Romisch J. Gray E. Crit. Care Med. 2001; 29: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), has anti-angiogenic activity and can inhibit tumor growth (20O'Reilly M.S. Pirie-Shepherd S. Lane W.S. Folkman J. Science. 1999; 285: 1926-1928Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), and has chemotactic activity for neutrophils (32Kaneider N.C. Egger P. Dunzendorfer S. Wiedermann C.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 33Dunzendorfer S. Kaneider N. Rabensteiner A. Meierhofer C. Reinisch C. Romisch J. Wiedermann C.J. Blood. 2001; 97: 1079-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The mechanism of action of the diverse biological activity of ATIII, including its HIV-1 inhibitory activity, has not been elucidated. We do not believe that ATIII HIV-1 inhibits HIV-1 as a result of being a competitive agonist at CXCR4, because we did not observe, in our earlier experiments, that the purified protein down-regulates CXCR4 or induces a Ca2+ flux in primary CD4+ T-cells or H9 cells (16Geiben-Lynn R. Kursar M. Brown N. Kerr E. Luster A. Walker B. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 8306-8316Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, ATIII has been shown to down-regulate NF-κB activity in monocytes (34Oelschlager C. Romisch J. Staubitz A. Stauss H. Leithauser B. Tillmanns H. Holschermann H. Blood. 2002; 99: 4015-4020Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), a feature that has also been described for CAF (8Walker C.M. Moody D.J. Stites D.P. Levy J.A.

ATIII has also been shown to bind to the syndecan family of proteoglycans, which may also mediate some of the biological activities of ATIII. In this regard, HIV-1, SIV, and SHIV have a requirement for syndecans for cell attachment, which facilitates HIV/SIV entry into cells (35Valenzuela-Fernandez A. Palanche T. Amara A. Magerus A. Altmeyer R. Delaunay T. Virelizier J.L. Baleux F. Galzi J.L. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. J. Biol.

Virol. 2001; 75: 9187-9200Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In addition, another heparin-binding serine protease inhibitor, the secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLP), is able to inhibit HIV-1. It has been suggested that SLP is an entry inhibitor but blocks a receptor distinct from chemokine receptors and CD4 (37Wahl S.M. McNeely T.B. Janoff E.N. Shugars D. Worley P. Tucker C.

Furthermore, another serine protease inhibitor, α1-antitrypsin, also has been described as an inhibitor of HIV-1. It was shown that α1-antitrypsin HIV-1 inhibition occurs partly through blocking entry and partly through down-regulation of NF-κB activity. In our studies, we used α1-antitrypsin for a comparison with ATIII but found no inhibitory activity for α1-antitrypsin at up to 50 μg/ml (data not shown) in assays in which 10 μg/ml of ATIII was inhibitory. It is interesting to note that α1-antitrypsin lacks the NH2-terminal heparin binding site of ATIII and needs 100–500 times more protein (2–5 mg/ml) (43Shapiro L. Pott G.B. Ralston A.H. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) than ATIII to achieve a similar HIV inhibition. Together with our findings regarding the sensitivity of the anti-HIV-1 activity of ATIII to partial V8 protease digest, which cleaves preferentially the NH2-terminal heparin binding site (21Larsson H. Akerud P. Nordling K. Raub-Segall E. Claesson-Welsh L. Bjork I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11996-12002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), these data suggest that the heparin binding site may be important for the HIV-1 inhibitory effect. Hypercoagulative states in HIV-1 patients have been associated with decreased ATIII levels and have been correlated with HIV-1 disease progression (44Saif M.W. Greenberg B. AIDS Patient Care STDS. 2001; 15: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Our data support the novel concept that ATIII may be protective in HIV-1 disease by inhibiting HIV-1 replication and also suggest that ATIII could be used therapeutically in conjunction with other antiviral agents to treat HIV-1 patients.

https://openalex.org/W1975306052,"Mammalian synapse-associated protein SAP97, a structural and functional homolog of DrosophilaDlg, is a membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) that is present at pre- and postsynaptic sites as well as in epithelial cell-cell contact sites. It is a multidomain scaffolding protein that shares with other members of the MAGUK protein family a characteristic modular organization composed of three sequential protein interaction motifs known as PDZ domains, followed by an Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, and an enzymatically inactive guanylate kinase (GK)-like domain. Specific binding partners are known for each domain, and different modes of intramolecular interactions have been proposed that particularly involve the SH3 and GK domains and the so-called HOOK region located between these two domains. We identified the HOOK region as a specific site for calmodulin binding and studied the dynamics of complex formation of recombinant calmodulin and SAP97 by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy. Binding of various SAP97 deletion constructs to immobilized calmodulin was strictly calcium-dependent. From the rate constants of association and dissociation we determined an equilibrium dissociation constantK d of 122 nm for the association of calcium-saturated calmodulin and a SAP97 fragment, which encompassed the entire SH3-HOOK-GK module. Comparative structure-based sequence analysis of calmodulin binding regions from various target proteins predicts variable affinities for the interaction of calmodulin with members of the MAGUK protein family.

These are multidomain proteins consisting of one or more PDZ domains, an Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, and a guanylate kinase (GK)-like domain (for reviews, see Refs. 1Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. Curr.

Rat SAP97 belongs to the MAGUK subfamily comprising Drosophila Dlg, SAP97/hDlg, SAP90/PSD-95, SAP102/NE-Dlg, and PSD93/Chapsyn110. SAP97 has earlier been reported to be presynaptic (5Muller B.M. Kistner U. Veh R.W. Cases-Langhoff C. Becker B. Gundelfinger E.D. Garner C.C. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 2354-2366Google Scholar), but it has recently been shown also to be present at postsynaptic sites in cerebral cortex (6Valtschanoff J.G. Burette A. Davare M.A. Leonard A.S. Hell J.W. Weinberg R.J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 3605-3614Google Scholar); it is found both at the post-synaptic density (PSD) region and in the cytoplasm of hippocampal synapses, suggesting a role for SAP97 in ionotropic glutamate receptor trafficking (7Sans N. Racca C. Petralia R.S. Wang Y.X. McCallum J. Wenthold R.J. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7506-7516Google Scholar). Recently it was discovered that SAP97, via its guanylate kinase (GK)-like domain, directly regulates the function of an inwardly rectifier potassium channel (8Hibino H. Inanobe A. Tanemoto M. Fujita A. Doi K. Kubo T. Hata Y. Takai Y. Kurachi Y. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 78-83Google Scholar). In addition to its crucial role as a scaffolding protein in neuronal cells, SAP97 is an essential component of the basolateral membrane cytoskeleton in a variety of epithelial cells (5Muller B.M. Kistner U. Veh R.W. Cases-Langhoff C. Becker B. Gundelfinger E.D. Garner C.C. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 2354-2366Google Scholar). Each domain in the SAP subfamily of MAGUKs is highly conserved and has been shown to be a site of protein-protein interaction: PDZ domains bind voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels (3Garner C.C.

Chem. 2000; 275: 28774-28784Google Scholar) are interaction partners of the GK domain. The GK domain is catalytically inactive, although structurally closely related to authentic guanylate kinases as we have shown in previous work (18Kuhlendahl S. Spangenberg O. Konrad M. Kim E. Garner C.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 252: 305-313Google Scholar, 19Li Y. Spangenberg O. Paarmann I. Konrad M. Lavie A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4159-4165Google Scholar). Despite striking overall structural similarities of SAP family members, these proteins associate with their binding partners by specific mechanisms: first, subtle variations in the sequences flanking the conserved PDZ, SH3, and GK domains have been shown to be responsible for the differential localization of these proteins (20Wu H. Reuver S.M. Kuhlendahl S. Chung W.J. Garner C.C. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2365-2376Google Scholar), and second, intramolecular as well as competing intermolecular interactions of the individual domains may regulate the association of specific binding partners (15Brenman J.E.

Gundelfinger E.D. Garner C.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5740-5751Google Scholar). Notably, SAP97 sequences located N-terminal to the first PDZ domain were found essential for multimerization (22Marfatia S.M. Byron O. Campbell G. Liu S.C. Chishti A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13759-13770Google Scholar), and the U5 region, also called the HOOK domain, which is located between the SH3 and GK domains, was reported to contain an actin binding protein 4.1 binding site in the alternative I3 splice variant (23Lue R.A. Marfatia S.M. Branton D. Chishti A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9818-9822Google Scholar) as well as a putative calmodulin (CaM) binding site (24Masuko N. Makino K. Kuwahara H. Fukunaga K. Sudo T. Araki N. Yamamoto H. Yamada Y. Miyamoto E. Saya H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5782-5790Google Scholar). By searching in the SAP97 HOOK domain for potential CaM binding sites that conform to the proposed motifs of charge, hydrophobicity, and amphiphilicity distribution in CaM binding peptides and proteins (25O'Neil K.T. DeGrado W.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 59-64Google Scholar, 26Rhoads A.R. Friedberg F. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 331-340Google Scholar), we identified key residues that are predicted to anchor this region to the N- and C-terminal domains of CaM. Because the SH3 and the GK domains of MAGUKs show both intramolecular and intermolecular interactions (11Nix S.L. Chishti A.H. Anderson J.M. Walther Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41192-41200Google Scholar, 27McGee A.W. Bredt D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17431-17436Google Scholar, 28Shin H.W. Hsueh Y.P. Yang F.C. Kim E. Sheng M. J.

Cell. 2001; 8: 1313-1325Google Scholar), CaM binding to these sites may modulate the scaffolding properties of SAP97 by affecting the equilibrium between intra- and intermolecular assembly. In fact, a CaM-dependent clustering ofN-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptors by heteromeric MAGUK protein complexes has been proposed (24Masuko N. Makino K. Kuwahara H. Fukunaga K. Sudo T. Araki N. Yamamoto H. Yamada Y. Miyamoto E. Saya H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5782-5790Google Scholar), and a pivotal role has been attributed to SAP97 as a major constituent of a membrane-anchoring complex that contains Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, actin, actinin, and protein 4.1 (30Lisman J.E. Zhabotinsky A.M. Neuron. 2001; 31: 191-201Google Scholar). This view has been strengthened by recent mass spectrometric identification of these proteins in large postsynaptic density complexes (31Husi H. Ward M.A. Choudhary J.S. Blackstock W.P. Grant S.G. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 661-669Google Scholar, 32Yoshimura Y. Shinkawa T. Taoka M. Kobayashi K. Isobe T. Yamauchi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 948-954Google Scholar). In the present study, using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy, we have analyzed the structural features required for the molecular interaction between SAP97 and CaM. Our results show that CaM binding to SAP97 occurs at the HOOK domain and that the HOOK domain-GK domain module is sufficient for CaM binding, but the presence of an intact SH3 domain promotes CaM binding, in a strictly calcium-dependent manner. Our findings suggest that calmodulin acts as a trigger for the opening and closing of the SAP97 molecule via a mechanism, which may allow this multidomain protein to differentially associate with various binding partners. CaM was amplified from a human cDNA library (Invitrogen) using the following pair of primers: 5′-GGAATTCCATATGGCTGACCAACTGACTGA-3′ (sense primer, introducing an NdeI restriction site) and 5′-CGGGATCCTCACTTTGCTGTCATCATTTG-3′ (antisense primer, introducing a BamHI site). The SAP97 cDNA clone was a generous gift of C. C. Garner, Department of Neurobiology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL. The intrinsic BamHI site in the GK domain of SAP97 was removed by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis using the following primer pairs (location of the mutated site shown in italics): 5′-CCTGACAAATTTGGCAGCTGTGTCCCTC-3′ (sense), 5′-GAGGGACACAGCTGCCAAATTTGTCAGG-3′ (antisense). The SAP97 N-terminal deletion constructs (as illustrated in Fig. 1 A) were generated using the following sense primers (NdeI andBamHI restriction sites underlined): 5′-GGAATTCCATATGCTCCGAACCAGCCAAAAG-3′ (SAP97-1), 5′-GGAATTCCATATGGTTGGAGTAATTCCTAGTA-3′ (SAP97-2), 5′-GGAATTCCATATGTCATTCAATGACAAGCGTA-3′ (SAP97-3), 5′-GGAATTCCATATGACCCGACCAGTCATCATATTAG-3′ (SAP97-4), 5′-GGAATTCCATATGTCAAAAGGTGGTCAAGAAGAATA-3′ (SAP97-5), and the following antisense primers: 5′-CGGGATCCTCATAATTTTTCTTTTGCTGGGA-3′ (SAP97-1 to SAP97-5), 5′-CGGGATCCAGACTGCTCTTCTATGATCTGCTT-3′ (SAP97-6), 5′-CGGGATCCTCACCCTTTATCTCCTCTTGTTTTAG-3′ (SAP97-7), and 5′-CGGGATCCTCATTCGTCACTCTCACCATCTG-3′ (SAP97-8). All PCR fragments were cloned asNdeI-BamHI-restricted fragments. The dlgm30 (L612P) mutation (33Woods D.F. Hough C. Peel D. Callaini G. Bryant P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1469-1482Google Scholar) was introduced via site-directed mutagenesis using the primer pair: 5′-GGAGATATTCCCCATGTTATCAATGCTTC-3′ (sense; mutated site shown in italics), 5′-GAAGCATTGATAACATGGGGAATATCTCC-3′ (antisense). All constructs were ligated into a modified pGEX-2T expression plasmid described elsewhere (34Brundiers R. Lavie A. Veit T. Reinstein J. Schlichting I. Ostermann N. Goody R.S. Konrad M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35289-35292Google Scholar) and were verified by automatic DNA sequencing (Applied Biosystems 373 Sequencer) and data analysis to confirm clone integrity. All proteins were produced as GST fusion proteins in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) CodonPlus strain (Novagen). Expression of the recombinant proteins was induced with 0.2 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 25 °C overnight. Bacteria were lysed by sonication. Applying the manufacturer's standard protocol (Amersham Biosciences), the cleared lysates were passed over a glutathione-Sepharose column. After extensive washing with phosphate-buffered saline, the proteins were eluted as GST fusion proteins, or cleaved from the beads with thrombin at 4 °C overnight. Protein concentration was determined at 280 nm using specific extinction coefficients (units of cm2mg−1) that were calculated from the amino acid composition according to (35Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Google Scholar): 0.85 for SAP97-1, 0.62 for SAP97-2, 0.69 for SAP97-3, 0.73 for SAP97-4, and 0.65 for SAP97-5. Association and dissociation reactions of calmodulin and SAP97 fragments were performed by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy using a BIAcore 2000 system (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Calmodulin, referred to as the ligand, was immobilized on a sensor chip, and the interaction with SAP97 fragments free in solution, referred to as the analyte, was detected through mass concentration-dependent changes of the refractive index on the sensor surface (for a review of kinetic analyses using the SPR technique, see Ref. 36Karlsson R. Falt A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 200: 121-133Google Scholar). All of the reagents such as an amine coupling kit, surfactant P-20, and the CM-5 sensor chip were purchased from BIAcore AB. Four flow cells were placed in a CM-5 sensor chip surface. Using a GST fusion capture kit (BIAcore), anti-GST antibody was immobilized on all flow cells according to the manufacturer's instructions. GST-tagged CaM was then captured in one flow cell. GST protein alone was captured in a different flow cell, which served for on-line reference subtraction. The running buffer for all experiments, except for determination of the Ca2+dependence of calmodulin binding, was composed of 10 mmCaCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, and 0.05% surfactant P-20. For Ca2+ dependence experiments, 10–300 μm CaCl2, 10 mmdithiothreitol, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.15 mNaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.05% surfactant P-20 were used as running buffer. Captured GST-CaM was regenerated in 1m NaCl. Anti-GST antibody on the CM5 surface was regenerated according to the GST fusion kit manual using 1-min pulses of 10 mm glycine, pH 2.2, at flow rates of 10 μl/min. All solutions used for SPR measurements were filtered (0.22 μm) and degassed. The changes in the observed SPR signal are expressed as resonance units (RU). A response change of 1000 RU corresponds to a change in the surface concentration of about 1 ng of protein per mm2 on the sensor chip (50BIAtechnology Handbook (1998) version AB, pp. 5-1–5-9, Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden.Google Scholar). Rate constants for the association and dissociation of free analyte (A) to sensor chip-bound ligand were calculated using the BIAevaluation 3.1 software. Control experiments using varying ligand densities on the sensor chip (resulting in 300–1500 RU) and flow rates of the analyte (between 5 and 30 μl/min) were performed to detect mass transfer-limited interactions that might affect kinetic analysis (36Karlsson R. Falt A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 200: 121-133Google Scholar). To determine rate constants of association and dissociation, kinetic measurements were performed at a flow rate of 30 μl/min and by adjusting the immobilization level of captured GST-CaM to 300–500 RU. The apparent binding rate under mass transfer-limiting conditions was calculated from the linear part of the association phase using a flow rate of 5 μl/min and 1300 RU of captured GST-CaM ligand. For competition experiments, varying amounts of untagged CaM were co-injected with 0.5 μm SAP97-1, and the binding rate was determined. Assuming a one-to-one binding model without mass transfer, the association reaction was analyzed according to the equation, Rt = { ka[A]Rmax/( ka[A] + kd)} [1 − e−(ka[A]+kd)·t] . Here, R is the time-dependent SPR signal, [A] the concentration of the injected analyte,k a the association rate constant, andk d the dissociation rate constant. Under conditions where k a[A] is much greater thank d, this equation simplifies to:R t = Rmax [1 − e−(ka[A]+kd)·t. The observed rate, k obs, is then linearly dependent upon the concentration of the analyte:k obs = k a[A] +k d. The dissociation phase can be described by Rt = R0e−kd(t−t0), assuming that the rebinding of released analyte is negligible, whereR t is the response at time t andR 0 the signal at an arbitrary starting pointt 0. With the rate constants determined by a series of analyte concentrations, the dissociation constants were calculated according to K d =k d/k a. GST fusion proteins of SAP97 constructs were expressed in E. coli BL21-CodonPlus and purified over a GSH-Sepharose column. The GST moiety was removed by thrombin cleavage, yielding >95% pure proteins. Because it proved to be difficult to overproduce full-length SAP97 (925 amino acid residues) in bacteria, we first generated a 350-residue fragment (construct SAP97-1), which encompassed the entire SH3 domain, the HOOK/U5 region, and the GK domain, including the 12-residue C terminus. To map the putative CaM binding domain and to determine the sequence motifs for specific SAP97 binding, we successively deleted the SH3 domain, the first part of the U5 region, the I3 insert, and the region between the I3 insert and the GK domain (Fig. 1 A). Recombinant proteins that contained the SH3 domain, but lacked the C terminus (constructs SAP97-6, -7, and -8) tended to form inclusion bodies upon bacterial expression and were not analyzed further. As an approach for quantifying the dynamic parameters of the SAP97-calmodulin interaction, we used surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy, which allowed us to directly observe the binding of SAP97 fragments that immobilize GST-calmodulin (GST-CaM) and to assess parameters of binding and dissociation kinetics. To immobilize GST-CaM we used a sandwich assay with anti-GST polyclonal antibodies covalently bound via amine coupling to the carboxylated dextran matrix of the sensor chip surface. We observed that the GST fusion protein bound in this way was fixed to the surface matrix in a nearly irreversible manner. Regeneration with 10 mm glycine, pH 2.2, resulted in complete dissociation of all non-covalently bound ligands, whereas the immobilized antibodies retained almost full binding activity. To screen for the relative affinity of SAP97 fragments to GST-CaM, a single sensor chip was used to detect binding at 1 μmanalyte concentration. Fig. 1 B represents GST-CaM interaction analysis of SAP97 fragments that contain the entire GK domain and adjacent N-terminal regions of variable lengths. Construct SAP97-1, which contains the SH3 domain, shows the strongest interaction; construct SAP97-2, which is devoid of the SH3 domain, has about a 3-fold reduced binding affinity (TableI), whereas deletion of both the SH3 domain and the N-terminal half of the U5 region in SAP97-3 leads to an almost inactive protein in this binding assay. The even shorter fragments SAP97-4 and SAP97-5 showed no interaction, thus highlighting the intact U5 region as an essential structural element for binding of calmodulin.Table ICharacteristics of CaM interaction with SAP97 constructsConstructk ak dK d1/mm·s1/minnmSAP97–119.9 ± 8.30.16 ± 0.10122 ± 46SAP97–1(L612P)7.5 ± 2.30.14 ± 0.04328 ± 76SAP97–210.8 ± 2.30.20 ± 0.05334 ± 141SAP97–3NDaND, not determined.NDWeak bindingSAP97–4−b−, not binding detectable.−No bindingSAP97–5−−No bindingThe kinetic characteristics of the interaction with CaM determined for different SAP97 constructs are summarized (see Fig. 1).

Open table in a new tab The kinetic characteristics of the interaction with CaM determined for different SAP97 constructs are summarized (see Fig. 1). Association rate constants (k a), dissociation rate constants (k d), and equilibrium dissociation constants (K d = k d/k a) are given. In initial experiments, the specificity of the interaction of SAP97 with CaM was evaluated by testing the SAP97-2 fragment for binding to immobilized CaM. Sensorgrams of the association phase were recorded at SAP97-2 concentrations varying from 0 to 500 nm in the running buffer (Fig. 2 A). The apparent binding rate increased linearly in the entire concentration range (Fig. 2 B). To ensure that fragment SAP97-2 bound in the target site of CaM and did not simply show a nonspecific interaction with CaM and to find out whether steric hindrance in protein-protein interaction may become critical when using the SPR technique, we performed competition experiments with soluble, untagged calmodulin. To this end, 0.5 μm SAP97-2 was preincubated with CaM in the 0.25–7.5 μm concentration range for at least 15 min before injection into the flow cell. Monophasic association was observed, with the amplitude of the SPR signal nearly vanishing at the highest concentration chosen. Fig. 2 C shows that surface-bound CaM efficiently competes with free CaM for interaction with SAP97, the apparent EC50 value being about 2 μm. To quantify the interaction of SAP97 with calmodulin as well as to determine comparative values for a presumed interaction of other MAGUKs, we performed surface plasmon resonance measurements using immobilized GST-CaM and purified SAP97-1 protein, which encompasses the SH3, U5, and GK domains. The interaction was studied in real-time as a function of SAP97-1 concentration. Fig.3 A shows traces of the change in mass (resonance units) on the sensor chip surface upon passing increasing concentrations of SAP97-1 over the antibody-fixed GST-CaM ligand. Analysis of the association and dissociation phases of the sensorgrams yielded an association rate constant,k a, of 2 × 104m−1s−1, and a dissociation rate constant of 2.6 × 10−3 s−1. The calculated dissociation equilibrium constant, K d, of 1.3 × 10−7m is indicative of a low to intermediate affinity complex of calmodulin (37Persechini A. Cronk B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6827-6830Google Scholar) and SAP97. The association rate constant is fairly low for a one-to-one reaction type, although it is very similar to the value reported for neuronal and endocrine dlg (NE-dlg) interaction with calmodulin (24Masuko N. Makino K. Kuwahara H. Fukunaga K. Sudo T. Araki N. Yamamoto H. Yamada Y. Miyamoto E. Saya H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5782-5790Google Scholar). The results of the kinetic analysis performed on all five SAP97 deletion constructs as well as on the SAP97-1(L612P) mutant protein are summarized in Table I. A number of target proteins bind to Ca2+-free calmodulin or the affinity of CaM-protein complexes may be quantitatively modulated depending on the extent of calcium saturation of calmodulin (38Jurado L.A. Chockalingam P.S. Jarrett H.W. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 661-682Google Scholar). Therefore, we were interested in answering the question of whether the association of SAP97 is calcium-regulated. When CaCl2 was varied from 10 to 300 μm, in the presence of 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, without EDTA, we observed that binding of the SAP97-1 protein was only weakly affected at concentrations above 30 μmCaCl2, whereas it was hardly detectable at 10 μm (Fig. 3 B). The calculated dissociation constants were 124 ± 62 nm at 30 μm, 113 ± 24 nm at 100 μm, and 171 ± 35 nm at 300 μm Ca2+; no binding was detected at 10 μm Ca2+. Under these conditions, which are in the physiological range of ionic strength and Mg2+ concentration, the Ca2+·CaM complex has an overall apparent dissociation constant of ∼10 μm (39Persechini A. Stemmer P.M. Ohashi I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32217-32225Google Scholar). It can be expected that, despite a direct competition between Ca2+ and Mg2+ binding for the four Ca2+ binding sites (40Gilli R. Lafitte D. Lopez C. Kilhoffer M. Makarov A. Briand C. Haiech J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5450-5456Google Scholar), CaM reaches the Ca2+-saturated state at 30 μmCa2+, implying that it is the (Ca2+)4·CaM species that associates with SAP97. Our kinetic data suggest that the SH3 domain provides little binding energy for complex formation between SAP97 and calmodulin, because the affinity of the SAP97-3 fragment, which lacks the SH3 domain, was only 3-fold weaker than that of the wild-type SAP97-1 construct (Table I). This relatively small, but reproducibly observed differential effect appears to be due to a slight decrease of the association rate constant and a slight increase of the dissociation rate constant. We also tested whether calmodulin association was affected by a leucine-to-proline point mutation in the SH3 domain of SAP97, SAP97(L612P). This leucine residue is conserved among MAGUK family members, and L612P corresponds to a point mutation that was first identified in theDrosophila dlg gene (dlg m30 allele; L632P mutation) where it produced a strong phenotype associated with loss of normal cell proliferation control (33Woods D.F. Hough C. Peel D. Callaini G. Bryant P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1469-1482Google Scholar). Moreover, the equivalent L460P mutation in the PSD-95 protein has been shown to interrupt intramolecular interaction between the SH3 and GK domains (27McGee A.W. Bredt D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17431-17436Google Scholar, 28Shin H.W. Hsueh Y.P. Yang F.C. Kim E. Sheng M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3580-3587Google Scholar). The data we obtained for the SAP97(L612P) protein were very similar to those of the SH3-free protein (SAP97-2 construct), suggesting that calmodulin most efficiently binds to the intact protein in which intramolecular association of the SH3 and GK domains can occur. To understand the structural basis for SAP97-calmodulin interaction, we analyzed the HOOK domain for sequence motifs known to be engaged in calmodulin recognition (26Rhoads A.R. Friedberg F. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 331-340Google Scholar, 41Chin D. Means A.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 322-328Google Scholar). Fig.4 B presents an alignment of amino acid sequences from putative CaM-binding regions of five MAGUKs in comparison with CaM-binding domains of selected target proteins that were shown to bind CaM in a Ca2+-dependent manner. This subclass of CaM-binding proteins contains the so-called 1-8-14 binding motif, which designates the position of conserved hydrophobic/aromatic residues that anchor the target protein to the two lobes of Ca2+·CaM (26Rhoads A.R. Friedberg F. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 331-340Google Scholar). SAP97 and its relatives conform to this 1-8-14 pattern of characteristic CaM binding residues and of net electrostatic charges of +3 to +5 within this motif. In addition, this motif (SAP97 residues 639–652) is situated in an α-helix that covers SAP97 residues 643–660, being equivalent to PSD-95 helix α1 (residues 491–508), which was recognized in the crystal structure of the PSD-95 SH3-GK fragment as a prominent structural element showing high conformational"

One of these protozoa, Toxoplasma gondii, is prevalent and problematic in the United States (8Vasquez J.R. Gooze L. Kim K. Gut J. Petersen C. Nelson R.G. Mol. Biochem.

Opportunistic toxoplasmosis is often associated with the onset of the clinical AIDS syndrome and is a primary cause of suffering and death in AIDS patients (6Roland A.R. Opportunistic Complications of HIV. 1996; 5: 81-107Google Scholar). Enzymes unique to the parasite, including the bifunctional TS-DHFR, are optimal targets for the development of new anti-parasitic drugs. As illustrated in Scheme FS1, TS catalyzes the only de novo source of deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP) from deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP). The reaction uses (6R)-l-5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (CH2H4F) as a cofactor for the one carbon transfer reaction generating 7,8-dihydrofolate (H2F) in the process. DHFR regenerates the fully reduced form of the folate (6R)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate (H4F) from H2F using NADPH as a cofactor and generating NADP+ in the process. H4F can then by primed for subsequent one-carbon transfer reactions in the cell. In the presence of dUMP, NADPH, and CH2H4F, the bifunctional TS-DHFR enzymes catalyze the conversion of CH2H4F directly to H4F.Figure FS1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Scheme FS2 illustrates the detailed catalytic mechanism that has been proposed for the TS reaction (9Spencer H.T.

Following ordered substrate binding, in which dUMP binds first, a conformational change takes place whereby the C-terminal tetrapeptide of TS closes over the substrates to create an active site cavity shielded from solvent (step 1) (1Santi D.V.

It has been suggested that this is followed by the formation of an iminium ion involving the bridge methylene and N-5 of CH2H4F (step 2) (15Carreras C.W. Santi D.V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 721-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). It is this highly reactive electrophilic iminium ion that has been proposed to be the reactive form of the cofactor. In fact, the structure of a TS mutant lacking a C-terminal valine and crystallized with CH2H4F and 5-fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate (FdUMP) in which (6R)-l-5-hydroxymethyltetrahydrofolate (HO-CH2H4F) is bound at the active site provided structural evidence supporting the formation of this iminium ion during TS catalysis (10Perry K.M. Carreras C.W. Chang L.C. Santi D.V. Stroud R.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7116-7125Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Kinetic isotope effect studies suggest that it is bound CH2H4F, potentially in its iminium ion form, that accumulates at the active site (9Spencer H.T. Villafranca J.E. Appleman J.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4212-4222Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Several steps in rapid equilibrium ensue leading up to an overall rate-limiting step involving hydride transfer to form the products dTMP and H2F (steps 3–6) (9Spencer H.T. Villafranca J.E. Appleman J.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4212-4222Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). All known TS enzymes, with the exception of a class of recently discovered flavin-dependent tetrameric TS enzymes from several non-symbiotic microbes, exist as a TS homodimer (16Myllykallio H. Lipowski G. Leduc D. Filee J. Forterre P. Liebl U. Science. 2002; 297: 105-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that TS is a half-sites-reactive enzyme in which only one TS site of dimeric TS productively binds substrates (17Saxl R.L. Changchien L.M. Hardy L.W. Maley F.

Until now, however, definitive kinetic evidence was lacking and the issue of whether TS is actually a half-sites-reactive enzyme has remained unresolved (9Spencer H.T. Villafranca J.E. Appleman J.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4212-4222Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). There is structural and kinetic evidence to suggest that bifunctional TS-DHFRs from certain protozoa, including Leishmania majorand T. gondii exhibit electrostatic substrate channeling in which H2F is directly transferred between the TS and DHFR active sites without release into bulk solvent (5Meek T.D.

Potter M.J. Matthews D.A. Knighton D.R. McCammon J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 370-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Previous kinetic studies from our group provided support for substrate channeling in TS-DHFR from L. major (23Liang P.H. Anderson K.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12195-12205Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These rapid transient kinetic studies on L. major also provided direct kinetic evidence for domain-domain communication in L. majorTS-DHFR in which ligation of the TS active site with FdUMP and CH2H4F to form the covalent FdUMP·CH2H4F·TS-DHFR covalent complex resulted in activation of DHFR chemistry from 14 to 120 s−1 (23Liang P.H. Anderson K.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12195-12205Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In this work, we set out to address fundamental mechanistic questions about the TS-DHFR from T. gondii; a detailed understanding of which might aid in novel anti-parasite drug development against this medically relevant organism. Specifically, we asked: What are the rate-limiting steps in the reactions catalyzed by this bifunctional enzyme? Can we gain any new insight into the catalytic mechanism of TS from this bifunctional enzyme? How does this bifunctional TS-DHFR compare with the previously characterized TS-DHFR from L. major for which a structure is known? In this report, we describe a transient kinetic analysis using rapid chemical quench and stopped-flow methods to provide the first in-depth characterization of the reaction pathway for the bifunctional TS-DHFR from T. gondii. In addition to elucidating the detailed mechanism for the T. gondii TS-DHFR enzyme, this study provides the first direct kinetic evidence for the formation of a TS intermediate and for half-sites TS reactivity. Subsequent analysis ofL. major TS-DHFR, Escherichia coli TS, and human TS provided evidence for an intermediate and for half-sites TS reactivity in these enzymes as well. A clone harboring the p02CLSA-4 plasmid expressed in an E. coli Rue 10 expression vector was used following previously described methods to obtain bifunctional L. majorTS-DHFR of high purity (23Liang P.H. Anderson K.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12195-12205Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 24Grumont R. Washtien W.L. Caput D. Santi D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The TS-DHFR was further purified using a Amersham Biosciences Superdex® 75 HiLoad® (26/60) gel filtration column to rid of residual H2F contaminant. T. gondii TS-DHFR was similarly prepared from E. coliBL21-DE3 cells (Stratagene) freshly transformed with PET15b plasmid containing the coding sequence for T. gondiiTS-DHFR. The T. gondii TS-DHFR plasmid was a generous gift from Dr. David S. Roos. Enzyme concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 67,800 m−1cm−1 forL. major TS-DHFR, 78,800m−1cm−1 for T. gondiiTS-DHFR, 43,800 m−1cm−1 for human TS, and 52,150 m−1cm−1 forE. coli TS. All buffers and other reagents employed were of the highest commercial purity. Millipore ultrapure water was used for all solutions. 7,8-Dihydrofolate (H2F) was chemically prepared by the reduction of folate with sodium hydrosulfite (26Blakely R.L. Nature. 1960; 188: 231-232Crossref Scopus (342) Google Scholar). (6R,S)-5,6,7,8-Tetrahydrofolate (H4F) was obtained from Schirks Laboratories, Switzerland. Radiolabeled H2F was synthesized by sodium hydrosulfite reduction of tritium-labeled [3′,5′,7,9-3H]folic acid obtained from Moravek Biochemicals (Brea, CA). Radiolabeled and unlabeled CH2H4F were prepared by enzymatic conversion of radiolabeled and unlabeled H2F, respectively, to form (6R,S)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate (H4F) and subsequent condensation with formaldehyde (27Mathews C.K. Huennekens F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 130: 134-145Google Scholar). Both H2F and CH2H4F were purified by DE-52 (Whatman Co.) anion exchange chromatography as previously described (28Curthoys N.P. Scott J.M. Rabinowitz J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 1959-1964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 14C-Labeled dUMP was obtained from Moravek Biochemicals (Brea, CA). The concentrations of H2F (ε282 = 28,000m−1cm−1), H4F (ε297 = 28,000m−1cm−1), and CH2H4F (ε290 = 32,000m−1cm−1) were determined spectrophotometrically (29Dawson R.M.C. Elliott W.H. Jones K.M. Data for Biochemical Research. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1969Google Scholar, 30Kallen R.G. Jencks W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 5845-5850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NADPH (ε340 = 6,220m−1cm−1), NADP+(ε260 = 18,000m−1cm−1), dUMP (ε260 = 10000m−1cm−1), and dTMP (ε260 = 8,400m−1cm−1) were purchased from Sigma, and their concentrations were determined using reported molar extinction coefficients. Experiments were carried out at 25 °C in 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.8) containing 1 mm EDTA, 25 mm MgCl2, and 10 mmdithiothreitol. Buffer solutions were purged with argon prior to use. Stopped-flow measurements were performed using a Kintek SF-2001 apparatus (Kintek Instruments, Austin, TX) as previously described (23Liang P.H. Anderson K.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12195-12205Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The data were collected over a given time interval using a PC and software provided by Kintek Instruments. In experiments designed to measure dissociation rate constants, the trapping ligand was used at a concentration of >5-fold excess over that of the bound ligand to allow analysis as a pseudo-first order rate constant. Coenzyme FRET was utilized in DHFR experiments and in all ligand association and dissociation experiments involving NADPH. For these experiments, a monochromator was set to 287 nm on the input and changes in NADPH FRET were monitored with an output filter at 450 nm. For TS and TS-DHFR experiments, changes in absorbance at 340 nm were monitored. For all other ligand binding experiments, changes in fluorescence with excitation at 287 and emission at 340 nm were monitored. Due to ordered binding to TS in which nucleotide binds first, followed by folate; H2F binding to the DHFR domain could be isolated from that to the TS domain by performing the experiments in the absence of nucleotide (dUMP or dTMP). Likewise, binding of H2F to TS could be separately assessed by preincubating enzyme with a DHFR-saturating concentration of H2F (>5 μm) prior to mixing with a large excess of nucleotide and an equimolar concentration of H2F. The combination of rapid chemical quench and stopped-flow methods allowed for an accurate interpretation of fluorescence and absorbance signals. CCD-array stopped-flow measurements were performed using a Kintek SF-2001 apparatus (Kintek Instruments, Austin, TX) and detected with an Ocean Optics PC2000 CCD linear silicon array detector. Absorption measurements were taken for 2.1 s (integration time of 3 ms) from 220 to 450 nm (over 649 elements), and the data were analyzed using a PC and Specfit/32TM Software (Spectrum Software Associates). Rapid chemical quench experiments were performed using a Kintek RFQ-3 Rapid Chemical Quench apparatus (Kintek Instruments, Austin, TX). The reactions were initiated by mixing enzyme solution (15 μl) with radiolabeled substrate (15 μl, ∼20,000 dpm). In all cases, the concentrations of enzyme and substrates cited in the text are those after mixing and during the reaction. Reactions utilizing radiolabeled folates were terminated by quenching with 67 μl of 0.78 n KOH, 10% sodium ascorbate, and 200 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. Ascorbate and 2-mercaptoethanol were added to prevent oxidative degradation of H4F after quenching and resulted in a pH of 12.6 for the base quench solution. Because CH2H4F is more stable under basic conditions, its solutions were maintained at a basic pH (9.5) until mixing with enzyme solution, providing a final pH of 7.8 during the reaction. TS reactions utilizing radiolabeled dUMP were quenched with 67 μl of 0.4 n HCl. The quenched reaction solutions were directly collected into argon-purged Waters Wisp autosampler vials, immediately vortexed, and analyzed by HPLC in combination with radioactivity-flow detection. The substrates and products were then quantified as described below. All samples that were not immediately analyzed were stored at −80 °C until just prior to analysis to minimize degradation. To confirm complete quenching of the enzymatic reactions, controls in which substrate was added to a premixed solution of enzyme and quench solution was included with each experiment. The substrates and products were quantified by radio-HPLC using a BDS-Hypersil C18 reverse phase column (250 × 4.6 mm, Keystone Scientific, Bellefonte, PA) with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. For separation of folates, an isocratic separation using a solvent system of 10% methanol in 180 mm triethylammonium bicarbonate (pH 7.8) was used. The elution times were as follows: H4F, 7.5 min; TS intermediate, 12.5 min; H2F, 14 min, CH2H4F, 16 min. For separation of dUMP and dTMP, an isocratic separation using a solvent system of 200 mm triethylammonium bicarbonate was used. The elution times were as follows: dUMP, 11 min; dTMP, 18 min. The HPLC effluent from the column was monitored continuously using a Flo-One radioactivity-flow detector (Packard Instruments, Downers Grove, IL). The analysis system was automated using a Waters 712B WISP (Milford, MA) autosampler. Rapid chemical quench single turnover and burst data were fit to single-exponential and burst equations, respectively, using the curve fitting program Kaleidagraph. Stopped-flow measurements provided estimates for the association and dissociation rate constants (k on andk off) and for reaction rate constants. Comparison of rapid chemical quench and stopped-flow reaction time courses allowed for the assignment of observed stopped-flow rates to chemical steps or conformational changes. The K m of CH2H4F was determined using a steady-state spectrophotometric kinetic assay. T. gondii TS-DHFR enzyme (25 nm) was preincubated with dUMP (100 μm) prior to mixing with CH2H4F (5 to 350 μm), and absorbance was monitored at 340 nm using a Hewlett-Packard 8452A spectrophotometer. Initial rates were determined in triplicate using the software provided with the instrument, and these rates were converted to units of specific activity using the reported extinction coefficient for the reaction (Δεrxn= 6.4 mm−1cm−1). Data in this paper are presented as the average of triplicate determination with error bars representing the standard deviation. The KINSIM kinetic simulation program was used to model kinetic data presented in this report (31Barshop B.A. Wrenn R.F. Frieden C. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 130: 134-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). The data were fit by a trial and error process, maintaining the constraints of constants measured in this study. The focus of this simulation was to validate the minimal kinetic mechanism elucidated in this study. The model and estimated rate constants are described in Chart FC1. Half-sites TS reactivity was modeled by defining TS (E) and DHFR (Z) as unique species and defining the modeling parameters such that Z = 2E = concentration of TS-DHFR used. A homology model of T. gondii TS-DHFR was built using the Swiss PDB program in conjunction with the Swiss Model homology modeling link available at the Swiss PDB website. The C-terminal 315 amino acids (residues 295–610) and residues 115–166 were modeled using the PDB file for theL. major TS-DHFR structure. The N-terminal 52 amino acids were modeled using the PDB file for Pneumocystis cariniiDHFR (PDB entry 1CD2), which was the highest homology DHFR relative to the N-terminal portion of the T. gondii DHFR domain for which a structure is available. Bifunctional TS-DHFR enzymes catalyze three basic reactions (Scheme FS1), the TS reaction, the DHFR reaction, and a bifunctional TS-DHFR reaction. Moreover, each of these reactions can be further subdivided into two classes of events: binding and dissociation of ligands and those events involved in catalysis. We will first address those events involving binding and dissociation of substrates and products, and we will consider an example experiment used to measure rates for each. Those events involved in chemical catalysis will then be elucidated, including the occurrence of conformational changes, formation of intermediates, and the identification of rate-limiting steps. We begin with the characterization of the DHFR reaction, because it is relatively straightforward and has features used to help interpret the TS reaction. We will then consider the TS and TS-DHFR reactions, providing a complete TS-DHFR reaction mechanism and new insight into the mechanism of TS catalysis. The second-order rate constants for the binding of ligands to TS-DHFR were determined by measuring the ligand concentration dependence of the observed binding rate. The apparent first-order rates for the binding of dUMP, dTMP, and H2F to the TS domain and for H2F, H4F, NADPH, and NADP+ to the DHFR domain were measured using stopped-flow fluorescence. A representative stopped-flow fluorescence trace for the binding of NADPH to the bifunctional enzyme is shown in Fig. 1 a. The trace is biphasic and fits a double-exponential equation with a fast NADPH concentration-dependent phase of 83.0 ± 3.9 s−1 and a slow NADPH concentration-independent phase of 5.6 ± 0.5 s−1. The fast phase represents the apparent first-order binding rate and conforms to the equation,k obs = k on[L] +k off, in which k obs,k on, and k off are the apparent first-order observed binding rate, association rate constant, and dissociation constant, respectively. The plot ofk obs versus [L] for NADPH binding is shown in Fig. 1 b. Accordingly, the binding and dissociation rate constants are 9.0 ± 0.4 μm−1s−1 and 39.8 ± 3.0 s−1 for the formation and dissociation of theE·NADPH complex, respectively, at 25 °C and pH 7.8. The slow NADPH concentration-independent phase is likely to represent a conformational change following NADPH binding. A summary of the association rate constants measured for the various ligands with the bifunctional TS-DHFR enzyme is shown in TableI.Table IKinetics of association of ligands for T. gondii TS-DHFR at pH 7.8 and 25 °CLigandEnzyme speciesK onμm−1s−1aThe error associated with the determination of each rate constant is <10% in all cases.NADPHE·H2F2.9H4FE27 s−1bThe observed rate of H4F binding was independent of concentration and likely reflects a conformational change following rapid binding.NADP+E2.6NADP+E·H2F2.2NADPHE9.0H2FE5.7CH2H4FE2.0cBecause it was not possible to directly measure the rate of CH2H4F binding, this rate was estimated based on the CH2H4F concentration dependence of the TS reaction and by modeling.dUMPE13.4dTMPE10.9H2FE·dTMP·H2FDHFRdH2F binding to the TS domain was isolated from binding to the DHFR domain by taking advantage of TS ordered binding in which dTMP binds first.

A representative stopped-flow trace for the measurement of the dissociation of H2F from the E·H2F complex using methotrexate as the trapping ligand is shown in Fig.2. The resulting trace was fit to a single-exponential equation with a rate of 9.0 ± 0.1 s−1, corresponding to the dissociation rate constant,k off, for H2F release from the DHFR domain of TS-DHFR.

Open table in a new tab The first experiment examining the DHFR activity of the T. gondii TS-DHFR enzyme is a pre-steady-state burst experiment. As shown in Fig.3 a, a burst in DHFR catalysis is observed at a rate of 180 ± 20 s−1. This is followed by slow steady-state product accumulation at a rate of 5.7 ± 0.6 s−1, corresponding to a rate-limiting step preceding subsequent turnover. The observed burst amplitude was 31.1 ± 1.4 μm, within the error of the enzyme concentration used, suggesting that essentially 100% of the DHFR sites are active. The second experiment is a single turnover stopped-flow fluorescence experiment, the time course for which is shown in Fig.3 b. Because enzyme-bound NADPH but not NADP+exhibits coenzyme fluorescence resonance energy transfer, the time course for the fluorescence at 450 nm represents the conversion of NADPH to NADP+ at the active site and, hence, the rate of catalysis. The data was fit to a single-exponential equation with a rate (k chem) of 180 ± 2.7 s−1consistent with the rate of chemistry observed in the burst reaction. There was no increase in the rate of catalysis under conditions in which the enzyme concentration was doubled, indicating that substrate binding was not limiting. Experiments designed to examine whether there was domain-domain communication involving DHFR activation in T. gondii TS-DHFR, as previously observed with the L. major enzyme, were performed. Both DHFR single turnover and burst experiments were similar to those described above, except that the enzyme was preincubated with FdUMP and CH2H4F to form the covalent FdUMP·CH2H4F·TS-DHFR covalent complex. In contrast to the DHFR activation observed with L. majorTS-DHFR (14 to 120 s−1), no significant change in theT. gondii DHFR rate was observed (data not shown). The first experiment examining the TS activity of the T. gondiiTS-DHFR enzyme was a pre-steady-state burst experiment in which enzyme was preincubated with excess [14C]dUMP prior to mixing with a large excess of CH2H4F. The time course for the reaction is shown in Fig.4 a. The reaction occurs at a linear steady-state rate with no burst in [14C]dUMP consumption or [14C]dTMP formation. The absence of a burst suggests that chemistry or a preceding step is limiting in the TS reaction for this enzyme. A second TS burst experiment was conducted in which CH2H4F was the radiolabeled substrate. The time course for the consumption of [3H]CH2H4F is shown in Fig.4 b. In contrast to"

The Rb gene encodes a phosphoprotein (pRb) that regulates the transition between G1 and S phases of the cell cycle by transducing growth-inhibitory signals that arrest cells in G1 (12Chellappan S.P.

Functional regulation of pRb is cell cycle-dependent, being strictly controlled by the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases that regulate the state of pRb phosphorylation. Dephosphorylated pRb inhibits the transcription of genes via its interaction with members of the E2F family of transcription factors. As the cell approaches the G1/S border, cyclin D-cdk4/6 and cyclin E-cdk2 complexes sequentially phosphorylate pRb. These events lead to the release of E2F and subsequent activation of E2F-regulated genes, such as c-myc, cyclin E, PCNA, and DNA polymerase, that are required for entry and activation of the S phase. The control of G1/S transit provides a dogmatic view of pRb function, as cell cycle regulation is vastly more complex than the simple scheme provided here. The overlapping function of two structurally related family members, p107 and p130, represents an interactive mechanism in which pRb, p107, and p130 share the ability to regulate different members of the E2F family and thus a variety of target genes (13Dyson N.

Although structurally similar, there is growing evidence supporting distinct cellular functions for eachRb family member. All three proteins are differentially expressed during mouse development (17Jiang Z. Zacksenhaus E. Gallie B.L. Phillips R.A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1789-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and their ability to initiate growth arrest is cell type-specific (18Zhu L. van den Heuvel S. Helin K. Fattaey A. Ewen M. Livingston D. Dyson N. Harlow E. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1111-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). In addition, these proteins preferentially associate with different E2F family members. Although pRb interacts with E2F1–4, there is apparent redundancy in the regulation of both E2F4 and E2F5 by p107 and p130 (reviewed in Ref.19Dannenberg J.H. van Rossum A. Schuijff L. te Riele H.

The similarities and differences between these proteins are also apparent in mice carrying single or compound knockouts ofRb, p107 and p130. When the Rb gene is deleted through targeted disruption, the embryos die at 13 days of gestation from defective development of erythroid and neuronal tissues (9Clarke A.R.

Nature. 1992; 359: 288-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar). In stark contrast, targeted disruption of either p107 or p130 does not result in an obvious phenotype, and the mice remain viable (20Lee M.H. Williams B.O. Mulligan G. Mukai S. Bronson R.T. Dyson N. Harlow E. Jacks T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1621-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Members of the Rb family are believed to play active roles in tissue development by regulating a postmitotic state required for cellular differentiation (5Lipinski M.M. Jacks T.

The normal differentiation and development of the prostate gland are critically dependent upon androgenic steroids which, following binding to the androgen receptor, transactivate or repress a number of transcriptional targets, including cell cycle regulatory genes. It was recently demonstrated (8Day M.L. Foster R.G. Day K.C. Zhao X. Humphrey P. Swanson P. Postigo A.A. Zhang S.H. Dean D.C. J. Biol.

Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 1571-1578PubMed Google Scholar) that pRb is activated during androgen-stimulated epithelial proliferation and during androgen ablation-induced apoptosis. The pRb protein has also been shown to function as a transcriptional co-activator of the androgen receptor (25Yeh S. Miyamoto H. Nishimura K. Kang H. Ludlow J. Hsiao P. Wang C., Su, C. Chang C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 361-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results tentatively position Rb as a central mediator of androgen action controlling the differentiation, growth, and death of prostate epithelium; however, this hypothesis has not been tested. Cell culture models currently available to study epithelial physiology have a limited scope of relevance with regard to the pRb pathway. Many transformed prostate cell lines, such as DU145, already exhibit nonfunctional pRb due to mutation (26Blagosklonny M.V. Prabhu N.S. El-Deiry W.S. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 320-325PubMed Google Scholar, 27Bookstein R. Shew J.Y. Chen P.L. Scully P. Lee W.H. Science. 1990; 247: 712-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Viral oncogenes are common tools used to immortalize cells in culture or study cell cycle regulatory mechanisms. The viral oncogenes SV-40 large T antigen, adenovirus E1A and E1B, and human papilloma virus E6 and E7 target and inactivate the pocket protein family members (pRb, p107, and p130) as well as p53 (28DeCaprio J.A.

The use of viral oncogenes has provided substantial insight into the function of the Rb family members and their roles in regulating cell cycle, cell growth, and differentiation; however, viral oncogenes are promiscuous in their interactions with other cellular proteins and promote genomic instability making interpretation of these experimental models difficult. The chromosomal imbalances directly influenced by viral oncogenes have been identified as either random or nonrandom genetic events and include gross chromosomal translocations (31Tsao S.W. Wong N.

Therefore, models that specifically target and inactivate Rb, which minimize complicating genetic alterations inherent with viral oncogenes, might provide novel insight into the physiologic role of Rb in epithelial cells. The homozygous deletion of the Rb gene results in embryonic lethality due to a variety of developmental abnormalities (9Clarke A.R. Maandag E.R. van Roon M. van der Lugt N.M. van der Valk M. Hooper M.L. Berns A. te Riele H. Nature. 1992; 359: 328-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar, 10Jacks T. Fazeli A. Schmitt E.M. Bronson R.T. Goodell M.A. Weinberg R.A.

Nature. 1992; 359: 288-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar). The embryonic lethality of the Rb knockout mutation has prevented the development of Rb−/− epithelial cell lines, and thus many of the functional aspects of pRb have not been independently characterized in this cellular population. Recently, the application of tissue recombination, using fetal tissue rescued fromRb−/− embryos and propagated in combination with wild type (Rb+/+) prostate stromal tissue, has enabled the development of Rb−/− prostate (34Wang Y. Hayward S.W. Donjacour A.A. Young P. Jacks T. Sage J. Dahiya R. Cardiff R.D. Day M.L. Cunha G.R. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6008-6017PubMed Google Scholar, 35Phillips J.L. Hayward S.W. Wang Y. Vasselli J.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7115-7119Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In the current study, we describe the isolation and characterization of theRb−/− prostate epithelial cell line, Rb−/−PrE, derived from Rb−/− fetal urogenital precursor tissue rescued from embryonic mice (34Wang Y. Hayward S.W. Donjacour A.A. Young P. Jacks T. Sage J. Dahiya R. Cardiff R.D. Day M.L. Cunha G.R. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6008-6017PubMed Google Scholar). To our knowledge, this is the first in vitro model to allow for the study of targeted Rbdeletion on an epithelial population and provides a unique experimental platform with which to investigate the physiological consequences ofRb deletion on the regulation of cell cycle, differentiation, cell survival, and carcinogenesis. Heterozygous Rb+/− mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). To increase litter size and thus the chances of Rb−/− offspring, the heterozygotes were crossed to CD1 mice. The genetic identity of the offspring was confirmed by PCR genotyping to identify the presence of the neomycin selection cassette that was used to disrupt the Rb gene. The Rb heterozygotes were crossed ant the fetuses rescued, and the prostatic ductal tips were then recombined as described previously (34Wang Y. Hayward S.W. Donjacour A.A. Young P. Jacks T. Sage J. Dahiya R. Cardiff R.D. Day M.L. Cunha G.R. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6008-6017PubMed Google Scholar). The Rbstatus of tissue grafts was determined by PCR analysis. Control (The Jackson Laboratories) and experimental DNA samples were amplified using wild type- and mutant-specific primers and separated on 2% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide. The protocol for PCR cycling conditions was obtained from The Jackson Laboratory technical support ([email protected]). PCR primers (The Jackson Laboratories) used for genotyping tissues and cell lines were as follows:Rb knockout allele, forward 5′-AAT TGC GGC CGC ATC TGC ATC TTT ATC GC-3′ (oIMR025) and reverse 5′-GAA GAA CGA GAT CAG CAG-3′ (oIMR027); Rb wild type allele, forward 5′-AAT TGC GGC CGC ATC TGC ATC TTT ATC GC-3′ (oIMR025) and reverse 5′-CCC ATG TTC GGT CCC TAG-3′ (oIMR026) (10Jacks T. Fazeli A. Schmitt E.M. Bronson R.T. Goodell M.A. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1992; 359: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1505) Google Scholar). Serial tissue recombination was used to assess the ability of theRb−/− epithelial cells to undergo multiple rounds of growth and generate immortalized tissue. A ductal tip of ∼300 μm was micro-dissected from rescued Rb−/− prostatic tissue (34Wang Y. Hayward S.W. Donjacour A.A. Young P. Jacks T. Sage J. Dahiya R. Cardiff R.D. Day M.L. Cunha G.R. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6008-6017PubMed Google Scholar), recombined with normal rat urogenital mesenchyme (rUGM), and grafted beneath the renal capsule of an intact male athymic mouse host. After 1 month of growth, the host was sacrificed, and the graft was retrieved. The resultant 40 mg of prostatic tissue (38Norman J.T. Cunha G.R. Sugimura Y. Prostate. 1986; 8: 209-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) was again micro-dissected, and another 300-μm ductal tip was recombined with fresh rUGM and grafted into a new mouse host to produce a “second generation” graft. This recombination protocol, repeated 8 times, resulted in ∼13 epithelial population doublings for each round of recombination and re-grafting as estimated by the number of epithelial cells from the tissue weight using the Coffey equation 1g = 109 cells (39DeKlerk D.P. Coffey D.S. Investig. Urol. 1978; 16: 240-245PubMed Google Scholar). Rb−/− prostate grafts were established in nude mice, and then the ductal fragments were recombined with rUGM as described previously (34Wang Y. Hayward S.W. Donjacour A.A. Young P. Jacks T. Sage J. Dahiya R. Cardiff R.D. Day M.L. Cunha G.R. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6008-6017PubMed Google Scholar). A portion of each excised graft was fixed for histological examination, and the rest were utilized to create Rb−/−PrE epithelial cultures. The tissue was minced with a scalpel and forceps and plated onto a tissue culture dish coated with collagen substrate in a minimal volume of medium to allow for attachment of the tissue to the matrix. These tissues were grown in RPMI 1640 (BioWhittaker). Culture media were supplemented with ITS (5 μg/ml insulin, 5 μg/ml transferrin, 5 ng/ml selenium, Collaborative Research), BPE (10 μg/ml bovine pituitary extract, Sigma), epidermal growth factor (10 μg/ml, Collaborative Research), cholera toxin (1.0 μg/ml, Sigma), amphotericin B (250 μg/ml, fungizone, Invitrogen), dexamethasone (5 μm, Sigma), 200 mml-glutamine (Invitrogen), and 100 units/ml penicillin G and 100 units/ml streptomycin (BioWhittaker). This formulation supports the growth of epithelial cells while retarding the growth of the fibroblast cells. Approximately 10–14 days after plating, the tissue pieces were removed from the cultures, and selection was initiated with 200 μg/ml G418 (BioWhittaker). Once large areas of epithelial cells became established, cells were passaged 1:3 by trypsinization. Between passage 5 and passage 10, cultures were gradually switched to a medium containing only 5% FBS,l-glutamine (Invitrogen), and 100 units/ml penicillin G and 100 units/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) in RPMI 1640 termed “5% FBS growth medium.” Wild type PrE cultures were generated from prostates excised from 6-week-old strain-matched male CD1 mice (Harlan Laboratories) following euthanasia with CO2. Prostate tissues were minced and plated in the defined BPE-containing culture medium described above. These cultures were maintained identical to the Rb−/−PrE described here without the addition of G418. The wild type control cell line, termed PrE, utilized for comparison herein, spontaneously immortalized in culture and was therefore utilized as a control for spontaneous immortalization of mouse prostatic epithelial cultures. Mouse Rb−/−PrE cells were grown on Falcon chamber slides to 70% confluence and fixed with 100% ethanol on ice for 5 min before washing with two changes of cold PBS. Fixed cells were then stained with Hoechst 33258 dye (5 μg/ml, Sigma) for 1 min at room temperature. Following staining, cultures were again washed three times in cold PBS, wet-mounted (Biomeda Corp.), and photographed using a Zeiss Axioskop fluorescent microscope to confirm that the cells were of mouse origin (40Cunha G.R. Vanderslice K.D. Stain Technol. 1984; 59: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Wild type and Rb−/−PrE (5 × 105) cells were plated into 60-mm culture dishes containing 5% FBS growth medium. Three days after plating (termed “Day 0”), culture media were changed to serum-free media consisting of RPMI 1640 (BioWhittaker), 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 units/ml streptomycin (without phenol red and withoutl-glutamine). Cultures were fed with the aforementioned serum-free medium every 3 days and counted at the indicated times, where each time point is the average and S.D. of triplicate dishes. Viable cell counts were analyzed by trypan blue exclusion. Photographs were taken on a Nikon Diaphot 200 with a Nikon digital camera. At passage 21, Rb−/−PrE cells were utilized to generate prostate grafts via cellular recombination. To prepare grafts, 2.5 × 105 urogenital mesenchymal cells and 1 × 105 Rb−/−PrE cells were combined in a collagen matrix as described previously (41Hayward S.W. Haughney P.C. Lopes E.S. Danielpour D. Cunha G.R. Prostate. 1999; 39: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These grafts were then transplanted beneath the renal capsule of an adult, male nude mouse host (Charles River Laboratories) and grown for 1 month. Host animals were then sacrificed, and the grafts were harvested, subjected to fixation, and evaluated utilizing immunohistochemical techniques. Tissue sections were deparaffinized in Histoclear (National Diagnostic) and hydrated in graded alcoholic solutions and PBS. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with 0.5% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 30 min and washed in PBS prior to staining. Immunocytochemical staining for expression of cytokeratins CK8, CK14, and CK18 in Rb−/−PrE cells was performed as described previously (34Wang Y. Hayward S.W. Donjacour A.A. Young P. Jacks T. Sage J. Dahiya R. Cardiff R.D. Day M.L. Cunha G.R. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6008-6017PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown on chamber slides (Falcon) coated with 5 μg/ml fibronectin prior to fixation with 100% ethanol for 5 min on ice. Cells were then washed with PBS, and glucose oxidase substrate was employed in conjunction with the mouse and rabbit staining kits from Vector Laboratories. Staining for the AR and estrogen receptor α (ERα), mDLP, and p63 was also repeated with the re-grafted Rb−/−PrE cells (passage 20). Following growth in nude mouse hosts, the re-grafted tissue was harvested and subjected to the staining procedure as described previously (34Wang Y. Hayward S.W. Donjacour A.A. Young P. Jacks T.

Primary antibodies were obtained as follows: anti-E-cadherin (Transduction Laboratories, C20820), anti-Rb (Pharmingen, 14001A), anti-p107 (Transduction Laboratories, R27020), anti-p130 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SC-318), anti-p21 (Pharmingen, 556430), anti-p53 (Oncogene, OP29), anti-AR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SC-816), anti-estrogen receptors α and β (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SC-542 and SC-8974, respectively), anti-cyclin D1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SC-8396), anti-cyclin E1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SC-481), anti-PCNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SC-9857), anti-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SC-1615), and high molecular weight pan-cytokeratin (Z0622, Dako). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained as follows: donkey anti-mouse (Amresco, E974), goat anti-rabbit (Bio-Rad), and donkey anti-goat (Bio-Rad). For protein analysis, cultured cells were lysed on ice in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 120 mmNaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EGTA, and protease inhibitors (40 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 μg/ml aprotinin, 200 μm sodium orthovanadate). Following centrifugation, the supernatants were collected, quantitated using a Bradford microtiter assay, and denatured with a reducing 2× sample loading buffer for 5 min at 100 °C. All proteins were then separated on Tris/glycine pre-cast NOVEX gels and analyzed utilizing the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (43Zhao X. Gschwend J.E.

Cultures of PrE and Rb−/− PrE were maintained in RPMI 1640 (BioWhittaker) containing 5% dextran-coated, charcoal stripped FBS, termed “5% CCS growth medium,” and compared with cultures grown in 5% FBS growth medium. For these experiments, PrE and Rb−/−PrE cells were plated at a density of 5 × 105 cells into 100-mm culture dishes, and viability and cell number were assessed via trypan blue (Invitrogen) exclusion on various days after plating. PrE and Rb−/−PrE (1 × 106, passages 15–20) were plated into 100-mm dishes and analyzed 4 days later to determine log phase cell cycle profiles. To ascertain growth arrest in confluent cultures, cells were plated at a higher density (2 × 106 cells per dish) and retained in culture for a total of 15 days. Serum-containing medium was replaced every 3 days on the long term cultures. Cells were harvested by trypsinization, fixed, and stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, dihydrochloride (DAPI). Prior to examination of cells by flow cytometry, 1 × 106 cells were collected by trypsinization, centrifuged, and reconstituted with 800 μl of PBS (without calcium or magnesium). One drop of an internal trout DNA control (Reiss Enterprise, 1007) was added to each sample. Then, 3.5 ml of cold 100% ethanol was added dropwise while mixing for fixation. Samples were then incubated for 1 h on ice prior to centrifugation and re-hydrated with 1 ml of PBS for 15 min on ice. Again, all samples were centrifuged and reconstituted with 1.5 ml of DAPI staining buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40). A final concentration of 1.0 μg/ml DAPI (Molecular Probes, D-1306) was utilized for flow cytometric evaluations. Flow cytometry was carried out at the University of Michigan Flow Cytometry Core facility using BD Biosciences FACSVantage SE model 127. Data were acquired to 105 events per sample. MultiCycle software (Phoenix Flow Systems, San Diego, CA) was utilized to estimate the percentage of cells in G1, S, and G2M phases of the cell cycle populations. Metaphase chromosomes from cultures of wild type PrE and Rb−/−PrE were obtained by mitotic shake off after 1 h of colcemide (1 μg/ml) treatment. Slides were hybridized with SKY kits, prepared from flow-sorted chromosomes, and detected 72 h later as described previously (44Difilippantonio M.J. Zhu J. Chen H.T. Meffre E. Nussenzweig M.C. Max E.E. Ried T. Nussenzweig A. Nature. 2000; 404: 510-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Images of 10–15 metaphase cells were acquired using a DMRXA microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) equipped with a custom-designed SKY-3 optical filter (Chroma Technology, Brattleboro, VT), a spectral cube, and a charge-coupled device camera (Hamamatsu, Bridgewater, NJ). Analysis was performed with SkyView software (Applied Spectral Imaging, Ltd., Migdal Haemek, Israel) as described elsewhere (45Liyanage M. Coleman A. du Manoir S. Veldman T. McCormack S. Dickson R.B.

For CGH analysis, DNA was prepared under high salt conditions. Biotin-labeled DNA was derived from PrE and Rb−/−PrE cultures and co-precipitated with digoxigenin-labeled reference DNA obtained from sex- and strain-matched Rb+/−and/or Rb+/+ mice. DNA was hybridized to sex-matched normal murine (C57) lymphocyte metaphase chromosomes and detected, and images were acquired with Q-CGH software (Leica Imaging Systems, Cambridge, UK) (46Weaver Z.A.

https://openalex.org/W2037496388,"Shiga-like toxin (SLT) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of hemolytic uremic syndrome and its attendant endothelial cell (EC) injury. Key serotypes of Escherichia coli produce SLT-1 in addition to another highly pro-inflammatory molecule, lipopolysaccharide (LPS). It has previously been established that SLT-1 induces EC apoptosis and that LPS enhances this effect. LPS alone has no affect on human EC viability, and the mechanism for this enhancement remains unknown. In the present report, we demonstrate that SLT-1 sensitizes EC to LPS-induced apoptosis. Pretreatment with SLT-1 sensitized EC to LPS-induced apoptosis, whereas pretreatment with LPS did not influence SLT-1-induced apoptosis. SLT-1 exposure resulted in decreased expression of FLICE-like inhibitory protein (FLIP), an anti-apoptotic protein that has previously been shown to block LPS-induced apoptosis. This SLT-1-mediated decrease in FLIP expression preceded the onset of apoptosis elicited by SLT-1 alone or in combination with LPS. SLT-1-mediated decrements in FLIP expression correlated in a dose- and time-dependent manner with sensitization to LPS-induced apoptosis. Finally, transient or stable overexpression of FLIP protected against LPS enhancement of SLT-1-induced apoptosis, and this protection corresponded with sustained expression of FLIP. Together, these data suggest that SLT-1 sensitizes EC to LPS-induced apoptosis by inhibiting FLIP expression."
https://openalex.org/W2063230838,"We have earlier reported that both guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl)-induced and heat-induced unfolding of seed coat soybean peroxidase (SBP), monitored by far UV CD, show single step transition. However, although GdnHCl-induced unfolding follows a two-state pathway, the heat-induced denaturation proceeds through intermediates as indicated by the very low cooperativity of transition. In the former case, analysis of the data based on the two-state model gives true thermodynamic parameters, whereas underestimated values are obtained in the latter case. Available complex equations also cannot be applied for the analysis of the thermal unfolding of SBP due to the absence of separate transitions for the intermediates. In the present study, we report a method to obtain true thermodynamic parameters from thermal transition curves of SBP using the two-state model.

We then obtained the thermodynamic parameters in the absence of GdnHCl by extrapolating the graph of linear dependence of ΔH m on T m to theT m corresponding to 0 m GdnHCl. Another key point for checking the validity of our method was the fact that the unfolded state of SBP generated by either heat or GdnHCl is the same by which we could cross-check our results with that obtained from GdnHCl unfolding.

The corrected author line is shown above. Full-Text PDF Open Access Protein folding/unfolding is one of the most intensely studied aspects of modern biophysics and biochemistry. The denaturant-induced unfolding transitions are measured either spectroscopically or calorimetrically. Far UV CD conforms to the secondary structure of a protein and therefore is used as a tool to monitor protein folding/unfolding. The most common denaturing agents used for the unfolding of proteins are heat, chemical denaturants such as urea and guanidine hydrochloride, and extremes of pH. The simplicity of unfolding transition and its reversibility allow a detailed description of its thermodynamics (1Privalov P.L. Adv. Protein Chem. 1979; 33: 167-241Google Scholar). The two-state model (1Privalov P.L. Adv. Protein Chem. 1979; 33: 167-241Google Scholar, 2Pace C.N. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 266-280Google Scholar, 3Freire E.

Pace C.N. Scholtz J.M. Science. 1995; 4: 2138-2148Google Scholar, 5Makhatadze G.I. Privalov P.L. Adv. Protein Chem. 1996; 47: 307-425Google Scholar). However, in most cases in which the transition is multistep (stable intermediate states), a complete analysis of the system is possible by utilizing more complex equations (2Pace C.N. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 266-280Google Scholar, 3Freire E. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 259: 144-168Google Scholar). If the two-state model is still used in such cases, underestimated values for the thermodynamic parameters are obtained (2Pace C.N. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 266-280Google Scholar, 3Freire E. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 259: 144-168Google Scholar). In certain other cases, although the unfolding curve shows a single step, the transition involves intermediates (2Pace C.N. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 266-280Google Scholar, 6Kamal J.K.A. Behere D.V. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9034-9042Google Scholar, 7Pappa H.S. Cass A.E.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 227-235Google Scholar), which makes the analysis difficult, almost impossible, due to the inability to estimate their fractional contribution to the observed spectroscopic property and thus their concentrations. If, however the number, accumulation, and stability interval of the intermediates are too small, making their presence insignificant, the analysis with the two-state model may provide thermodynamic parameters that can be very close to their true values (6Kamal J.K.A. Behere D.V. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9034-9042Google Scholar, 7Pappa H.S. Cass A.E.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 227-235Google Scholar). Soybean seed coat peroxidase (SBP) 1The abbreviations used are: SBP, seed coat soybean peroxidase; GdnHCl, guanidine hydrochloride. 1The abbreviations used are: SBP, seed coat soybean peroxidase; GdnHCl, guanidine hydrochloride. is an excellent model for studying the energetics and mechanism of protein folding. It contains 326 amino acids with a mean molecular mass of ∼37 kDa (8Gillikin J.W. Graham J.S. Plant. Physiol. 1991; 96: 214-220Google Scholar, 9Gijzen M. Plant J. 1997; 12: 991-998Google Scholar) and belongs to the class III of the plant peroxidase superfamily. The structure is stabilized by a heme prosthetic group, four disulfide bonds, and two calcium ions apart from the stabilization by interresidue interactions (6Kamal J.K.A. Behere D.V. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9034-9042Google Scholar, 10Henriksen A. Mirza O. Indiani C. Teilum K. Smulevich G. Welinder K.G. Gajhede M. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 108-115Google Scholar). It is highly thermally stable, showing a characteristic transition midpoint, T m = 86 °C, for the unfolding of backbone at neutral pH (6Kamal J.K.A. Behere D.V. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9034-9042Google Scholar). 2The expressions used in equations are as follows: [θ], molecular ellipticity; T, temperature;T m, midpoint of thermal unfolding curve;ΔH, change in enthalpy of protein unfolding;ΔH m, change in enthalpy of protein unfolding atT m; ΔS, change in entropy of protein unfolding; ΔS m, change in entropy of protein unfolding at T m; ΔC p, change in heat capacity upon protein unfolding; ΔG o, Gibbs' free energy of protein unfolding; T s, temperature of maximal protein stability. 2The expressions used in equations are as follows: [θ], molecular ellipticity; T, temperature;T m, midpoint of thermal unfolding curve;ΔH, change in enthalpy of protein unfolding;ΔH m, change in enthalpy of protein unfolding atT m; ΔS, change in entropy of protein unfolding; ΔS m, change in entropy of protein unfolding at T m; ΔC p, change in heat capacity upon protein unfolding; ΔG o, Gibbs' free energy of protein unfolding; T s, temperature of maximal protein stability. The Gibbs' free energy of unfolding ΔG o (H2O,25 °C) determined from the guanidine hydrochloride denaturation at neutral pH is 43.3 ± 2.4 kJ mol−1 for SBP (6Kamal J.K.A. Behere D.V. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9034-9042Google Scholar). We observed in our previous study that although the unfolding of SBP induced by guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) occurs via a simple two-state pathway, that induced by heat proceeds through partly folded intermediates whose accumulation is too small to form separate transitions (6Kamal J.K.A. Behere D.V. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9034-9042Google Scholar). In other words, thermal unfolding of SBP is a single step transition that involves multiple intermediates. In the study presented here, we report the fate of the thermal unfolding of SBP when analyzed by the two-state model. The results suggest that the thermodynamic parameters are underestimated. We then describe how we have obtained the true parameters for thermal unfolding of SBP measured spectroscopically utilizing the two-state model. Further we provide details about the thermodynamics and dependence of structural features with the temperature of SBP that help us gain insight into the thermal unfolding mechanism and correlation between stability, activity, and conformational flexibility. SBP (R Z =A 403/A 280 ≈ 0.5, salt-free lyophilized powder) and GdnHCl were purchased from Sigma. SBP was purified by DEAE-Sepharose chromatography toR Z = 3.0 (6Kamal J.K.A. Behere D.V. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9034-9042Google Scholar). apoSBP was prepared by the acid-butanone procedure (11Teale F.W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1959; 35: 543Google Scholar). Concentrations of the enzyme samples were determined spectrophotometrically using ε403 = 94.6 mm−1 cm−1 for SBP and ε280 = 24 mm−1 cm−1for apoSBP (6Kamal J.K.A. Behere D.V. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9034-9042Google Scholar). The GdnHCl concentration in the stock solution was determined using refractometer according to the reported method (2Pace C.N. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 266-280Google Scholar). Deionized water (PURITE RO 50) was used to prepare buffers. Far UV CD at 222 nm was used to monitor thermal unfolding of SBP and apoSBP on a Jasco J-600 spectropolarimeter using a rectangular cuvette of 1-mm path length placed on a thermostated cell holder attached with a thermometer. The temperature was raised from 25 to 95 °C with a heating rate of 0.5 °C/min. Protein solutions of 5 μm, equilibrated previously with various GdnHCl concentrations ranging from 0 to 8 m for 22–23 h at room temperature, were used. CD data, obtained in millidegrees, were expressed in terms of molecular ellipticity [θ] in degrees·cm2·decimols−1using the equation CD/(10 × C ×l) where C is the molar concentration andl is the path length in centimeters (12Sievers G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 536: 212-225Google Scholar). At the end of each thermal unfolding experiment, the sample was cooled immediately to room temperature, and spectra were recorded to know the extent of refolding. In thermal unfolding experiments, the thermodynamic properties of SBP were calculated assuming a two-state denaturation process, N ⇋ U (1, 2). Fractions of the unfolded protein f u, at different temperatures (T), were calculated using Equation 1 (13Agashe V.R. Udgaonkar J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3286-3299Google Scholar) fu=Y0−(YN+mNT)(YU+mUT)−(YN+mNT)Equation 1 where Y 0 is the value of the spectroscopic property of SBP at a given temperature, T. Y N and Y U represent the intercepts, and m N and m U are the slopes of the native and unfolded baselines, respectively. The apparent equilibrium constant of unfolding (K t(app)) and the corresponding free energy change (ΔGoT) at temperature, T can be calculated using Equations 2 and 3 (KT(app))=fu/(1−fu)Equation 2 ΔGTo=−RT ln(KT(app))Equation 3 where R is the gas constant and T is the absolute temperature. The change in enthalpy (ΔH T) and entropy (ΔS T) accompanying unfolding atT are related to ΔG 0T by Equation 4 ΔGTo=−RT ln(KT(app))=ΔHT−TΔSTEquation 4 The temperature dependences of ΔH T and ΔS T, assuming that the heat capacity change (ΔC p) between the native (N) and unfolded (U) state of the system is relatively independent of the temperature in the range of the measurements (3Freire E. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 259: 144-168Google Scholar, 14Privalov P.L. Makhatadze G.I. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 385-391Google Scholar), are as shown in Equations 5 and 6 ΔHT=ΔHm+ΔCp(T−Tm)Equation 5 ΔST=ΔSm+ΔCplnTTmEquation 6 where ΔH m and ΔS m are the enthalpy and entropy changes respectively at the midpoint of transition, i.e. when T =T m. Therefore at T m, ΔG om = 0 according to Equation 7 ΔGTo=ΔHm(1−T/Tm)+ΔCp(T−Tm−Tln(T/Tm))Equation 7 The van't Hoff plot ofln(K T(app)) against 1/T was linearly fitted to Equation 8 ln(KT(app))=ΔSmR−ΔHmR1TEquation 8 Some proteins when unfolded by both GdnHCl and heat show zero or negligible far UV CD signal (15Chiti F. van Nuland N.A.J. Taddei N. Magherini F. Stefani M. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1447-1455Google Scholar). Certain other proteins, however, show characteristic residual CD intensity when unfolded by heat (13Agashe V.R. Udgaonkar J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3286-3299Google Scholar, 16Ionescu R.M. Smith V.F. O'Neill Jr., J.C. Matthews C.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9540-9550Google Scholar). It has been shown that SBP falls under the second category and that the unfolded state generated by either GdnHCl or heat is the same, although the two unfolding pathways are entirely different (6Kamal J.K.A. Behere D.V. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9034-9042Google Scholar). In such circumstances, thermodynamic parameters that are state functions representing the two unfolding reactions must be the same. Fig. 1 represents typical GdnHCl and thermal unfolding curves of SBP, the shapes of which show the difference in the specific pathways of the two transitions. Although GdnHCl unfolding of SBP is fully reversible (6Kamal J.K.A. Behere D.V. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9034-9042Google Scholar), thermal unfolding is associated with irreversibility to some extent that obeys the Lumry and Eyring model, N ⇋ U → F (6, 17). However the thermal unfolding shows substantial reversibility, ∼65% for holo SBP and ∼80% for apoSBP (6Kamal J.K.A. Behere D.V. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9034-9042Google Scholar), to approximate for the equilibrium condition to derive thermodynamic parameters (18McEldoon J.P. Dordick J.S. Biotechnol. Prog. 1996; 12: 555-558Google Scholar). Further support about the reliability of equilibrium treatment comes from the following fact. In the Lumry and Eyring model (17Lumry R. Eyring H. J. Phys. Chem. 1954; 58: 110-120Google Scholar) of unfolding, if the irreversible step is not significant at temperatures slightly above the transition temperature, the equilibrium thermodynamic analysis leads to meaningful values (18McEldoon J.P. Dordick J.S. Biotechnol. Prog. 1996; 12: 555-558Google Scholar, 19Sanchez-Ruiz J.M. Biophys. J. 1992; 61: 921-935Google Scholar, 20Vallée B. Teyssier C. Maget-Dana R. Ramstein J. Bureaud N. Schoentgen F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 40-52Google Scholar). Accordingly, in the present study, we observed full reversibility when SBP is unfolded until 85–87 °C (T m = 86 °C). Thermodynamic parameters ΔH m , T m ,ΔC p , ΔS m (= ΔH m/T m), and ΔG o (H2O, 25 °C) for the thermal unfolding are obtained from the fit to the stability curve (Fig.2) according to Equation 7. Values of ΔH m , ΔS m, andT m are further confirmed from the fit to the van't Hoff plot according to Equation 8 (Fig. 2, inset) and are shown in Table I. The ΔG°(H2O, 25 °C) at pH 7.0 obtained from thermal studies is 10.8 ± 0.1 kJ mol−1, which is very low when compared with that obtained from GdnHCl denaturation (TableII), indicating that the ΔG° (H2O, 25 °C) and thereby ΔH m , ΔS m, and ΔC p values representing thermal unfolding are underestimated. Therefore the two-state model (van't Hoff analysis) is inappropriate for analyzing the thermal unfolding curve of SBP. Meanwhile, when we were carrying out the thermal unfolding experiments of SBP in the presence of different concentrations of GdnHCl to understand the effect of GdnHCl on thermal unfolding, we observed many interesting phenomena. Fig. 3 shows that as the GdnHCl concentration increases from 0 to 6.9 m, the unfolding transition (T m) occurs at lower temperatures, indicating reduced thermal stability of SBP in the presence of GdnHCl. At GdnHCl concentrations ≥ 5.8 m, we observed fully cooperative thermal unfolding (Fig. 3), indicating that the unfolding proceeds in a simple two-state manner. A better cooperative unfolding at higher GdnHCl concentration has been reported for the protein trypsin by Otlewski et al. (21Otlewski J. Sywula A. Kolasinski M. Krowarsch D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 601-607Google Scholar). In such a situation, the van't Hoff analysis must correctly estimate the thermodynamic parameters accompanying unfolding. Table I lists the values of the thermodynamic parameters, thus calculated by the two-state model for the thermal unfolding of SBP at various GdnHCl concentrations. From Table I, it is seen that the ΔH m and ΔS m values at [GdnHCl] = 5.8 m are indeed higher than those measured at lower concentrations or in the absence of GdnHCl. Further the values serially decrease with an increase in GdnHCl concentration above 5.8m GdnHCl in accordance with their T mvalues. The lowering in enthalpy change observed on unfolding in the presence of high concentrations of GdnHCl could be attributed to the replacement of some of the hydrogen bonds by GdnH+interactions, and the corresponding decrease in entropy change is attributed to the ordering of more GdnH+ ions around exposed hydrophobic groups in the unfolded state (22Wittung-Stafshede P. Malmström B.G. Sanders D. Fee J.A. Winkler J.R. Grey H.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3172-3177Google Scholar).Figure 2Stability curve of SBP at pH 7.0 obtained by the van't Hoff analysis of its thermal unfolding curve.

Fig. 4 is the plot of ΔH m of SBP in the presence of various GdnHCl concentrations as a function of the T mvalues. The set of points (open circles) that lie in a straight line are those that occur when GdnHCl concentration is ≥ 5.8 m. Pfeil and Privalov (23Pfeil W. Privalov P. Biophys. Chem. 1976; 4: 33-40Google Scholar), Hawkes et al. (24Hawkes R. Grutter M.G. Schellman J. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 175: 195-212Google Scholar), and Agashe and Udgaonkar (13Agashe V.R. Udgaonkar J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3286-3299Google Scholar) have shown that the enthalpy of unfolding is relatively independent of the presence of guanidine hydrochloride. Based on this, the data in Fig. 4 (open circles) were fitted by least squares to Equation 9 (24Hawkes R. Grutter M.G. Schellman J. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 175: 195-212Google Scholar) ΔHm=A+ΔCpTmEquation 9 From Fig. 4, we can obtain the value of ΔH min the absence of guanidine hydrochloride at the correspondingT m. Thus the value of ΔH m read out at T m = 86 °C (T m of SBP in the absence of GdnHCl) is 778.9 kJ mol−1, which represents the true enthalpy accompanying the unfolding of SBP (TableII). The entropy of unfolding, ΔS m, obtained from the relation ΔS m =ΔH m/T m, is 2.17 kJ mol−1K−1 (Table II). It is noteworthy that these values, obtained from the linearly fitted plot of ΔH m versus T m, are much higher than the values obtained previously from the direct van't Hoff analysis of unfolding curve (Table II). The value of heat capacity change, ΔC p, obtained from the slope of Fig. 4, is 15.5 kJ mol−1 K−1, which translates to a value of 11.4 cal mol−1 K−1 per residue, which compares well with the range of the values, 12–15 cal · mol−1 K−1 per residue, described for other globular proteins such as ribonuclease A, ribonuclease T1, lysozyme, barnase, and staphylococcal nuclease (13Agashe V.R. Udgaonkar J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3286-3299Google Scholar). The standard Gibbs' free energy change, ΔG o (H2O, 25 °C), computed using these parameters from Equation 7, is 47.0 kJ mol−1 (Table II). This is in good agreement with the value obtained from GdnHCl unfolding with the consideration that the ΔH m value is read out at a very long range extrapolation. This method can also be applied to other proteins whose thermal unfolding is poor cooperative/show intermediates, provided that under the influence of other external agents such as urea, GdnHCl, pH, etc., the unfolding becomes cooperative. The ratio of actual enthalpy accompanying unfolding (779 kJ mol−1) of the protein to van't Hoff enthalpy (192 kJ mol−1), R, is a reflection of the cooperative interactions existing in the protein (1Privalov P.L. Adv. Protein Chem. 1979; 33: 167-241Google Scholar,3Freire E. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 259: 144-168Google Scholar). The R value obtained for SBP is 4, indicating that the enzyme has approximately four intrinsic cooperative units per protein molecule (1Privalov P.L. Adv. Protein Chem. 1979; 33: 167-241Google Scholar, 3Freire E. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 259: 144-168Google Scholar), and therefore its thermal unfolding may be via four partly folded intermediates (3Freire E. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 259: 144-168Google Scholar). We also carried out detailed analysis of the thermal unfolding curve of apoSBP to understand the role of heme in the thermal unfolding mechanism of SBP. The values obtained on analyzing the unfolding curve directly by the two-state model are ΔH m = 308.0 ± 2.0 kJ mol−1 , ΔS m = 1.0 ± 0.1 kJ mol−1 K−1, ΔC p = 9.0 ± 1.0 kJ mol−1 K−1,T m = 38 °C, and ΔG o(H2O, 25 °C) = 9.4 ± 0.1 kJ mol−1 (Table II). The ΔG o(H2O, 25 °C) value matched very well with that obtained from GdnHCl unfolding studies (Table II), indicating the validity of the two-state model for the thermal unfolding of apoSBP, which further indicates that apoSBP has a single intrinsic cooperative unit for thermal unfolding, which spreads the entire protein molecule. This further indicates that the protein molecule in the absence of heme behaves as a single cooperative entity toward thermal unfolding, but on binding to heme, the molecule gets divided into approximately four regions of differing stabilization energy, each of which unfolds at different temperature intervals. Binding of heme is equivalent to introducing several hydrophobic groups contributing to the hydrophobic region within the protein structure, resulting in the reorientation of hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues. Further binding of heme imposes extra rigidity to various structural elements. Probably these effects may create a difference in the stabilization of four disulfide bonds such that each of the four intermediates seen in the thermal unfolding of SBP are stabilized by each of the four disulfide bonds. The observation of fully cooperative thermal unfolding of SBP in the presence of higher GdnHCl concentrations may be due to strong interactions existing between these cooperative units, leading to their mutual stabilization by the binding of GdnHCl. The stability curve (25Becktel W.J. Schellman J.A. Biopolymers. 1987; 26: 1859-1877Google Scholar) of SBP constructed from the actual thermodynamic parameters (those obtained from Fig. 4) using Equation 7is shown in Fig. 5. It is evident from Fig. 5 that SBP shows two transition temperatures, one at a higher temperature (86 °C) that has been determined experimentally and another at below the freezing point of water (−5.6 °C). This indicates that SBP does not undergo cold denaturation at the usual working room temperatures. However, one has to be careful while temperature is lowered. The predicted lower T m can be moved above the freezing point of water by the appropriate choice of solvent conditions and can be made amenable to study (24Hawkes R. Grutter M.G. Schellman J. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 175: 195-212Google Scholar). The temperature of maximum conformational stability (T s) can be obtained from Equation 10 (15, 25) Ts=Tm/{exp(ΔHm/(ΔCpTm))}Equation 10 The T s obtained for SBP is 39 °C, corresponding to a free energy of stabilization (ΔG omax (H2O)) of 52.1 kJ mol−1. It is noteworthy that the temperature of optimal activity of SBP has been reported (26Schmitz N. Gijzen M. van Huystee R. Can. J. Bot. 1997; 75: 1336-1341Google Scholar) to be 39 °C. It is reported that the enzyme maintains its native secondary structure and overall tertiary structure at T s (6Kamal J.K.A. Behere D.V. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9034-9042Google Scholar). The Soret absorption band is unaffected for the temperature rise from 25 to 40 °C (6Kamal J.K.A. Behere D.V. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9034-9042Google Scholar).T s is a few degrees below the T m(43 °C), at which the heme cavity undergoes breaking of the hydrogen bonding network (6Kamal J.K.A. Behere D.V. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9034-9042Google Scholar), indicating enhanced hydrogen bond flexibility in the heme cavity at T s. Consequently, the Soret CD intensity is slightly reduced (∼5%), which is reflected in the tryptophan fluorescence as well (6Kamal J.K.A. Behere D.V. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9034-9042Google Scholar). These observations indicate that although overall protein structure remains intact, a conformational flexibility in the heme cavity due to dynamics of hydrogen bonding network may be responsible for the optimum activity. The correlation between catalytic property and conformational flexibility has been established for various proteins (27Fitter J. Herrmann R. Dencher N.A. Blume A. Hauss T. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10723-10731Google Scholar, 28Nicholson L.K. Yamazaki T. Torchia D.A. Grzesiek S. Bax A. Stahl S.J. Kaufman J.D. Wingfield P.T. Lam P.Y. Jadhav P.K. Nat. Struct.

The catalytic activity of thermostable α-amylase at 60 °C is reported to be higher than that at 30 °C and was attributed to a relatively higher conformational flexibility at 60 °C (27Fitter J. Herrmann R. Dencher N.A. Blume A. Hauss T. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10723-10731Google Scholar). It has been stated (27Fitter J. Herrmann R. Dencher N.A. Blume A. Hauss T. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10723-10731Google Scholar) that “equilibrium fluctuations on the picosecond time scale are supposed to be required for catalytic activity because they help to overcome barriers in the conformational energy landscape of the proteins and thereby ‘lubricate’ conformational changes on longer time scales (micro to milliseconds), which are often directly related to the catalytic mechanism.” An increase in conformational fluctuations can occur in the entire protein molecule with an increase in temperature (27Fitter J. Herrmann R. Dencher N.A. Blume A. Hauss T. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10723-10731Google Scholar). Although comparable motions in the active site are associated with catalytic activity, conformational fluctuations outside the active site may be associated with stability and/or activity (32Gershenson A. Schauerte J.A. Giver L. Arnold F.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4658-4665Google Scholar). Therefore we suggest that the optimum stability and activity of SBP atT s is due to the optimal conformational fluctuations with an intact protein native structure."
https://openalex.org/W2078205307,"Small angle x-ray scattering has been used to monitor calpain structural transitions during the activation process triggered by Ca2+ binding. The scattering pattern of the unliganded enzyme in solution does not display any significant difference with that calculated from the crystal structure. The addition of Ca2+ promotes the formation of large aggregates, indicating the exposure of hydrophobic patches on the surface of the protease. In contrast, Ca2+ addition in the presence of the thiol proteinase inhibitor E64 or of the inhibitor leupeptin causes a small conformational change with no dissociation of the heterodimer. The resulting conformation appears to be slightly more extended than the unliganded form. From the comparison between ab initio models derived from our data with the crystal structure, the major observable conformational change appears to be localized at level of the L-subunit and in particular seems to confirm the mutual movement already observed by the crystallographic analysis of the dII (dIIb) and the dI (dIIa) domains creating a functional active site. This work not only provides another piece of supporting evidence for the calpain conformational change in the presence of Ca2+, but actually constitutes the first experimental observation of this change for intact heterodimeric calpain in solution.

This work not only provides another piece of supporting evidence for the calpain conformational change in the presence of Ca2+, but actually constitutes the first experimental observation of this change for intact heterodimeric calpain in solution. Calpains (EC 3.4.22.17) are a family of cytosolic Ca2+-dependent cysteine endopeptidases widely distributed in all mammalian cells and comprising several genetically distinct isozymes and various homologues in different lower organisms (1Sorimachi H. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 721-732Google Scholar, 2Sorimachi H. Suzuki K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 129: 653-664Google Scholar). The physiological role of calpains is related to the transduction of extracellular signals mediated by changes in the permeability of membranes to Ca2+ or by the mobilization of this ion from internal stores. These proteins are involved in physiological and pathophysiological conditions such as cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, cytoskeletal remodeling, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, and muscular dystrophies (1Sorimachi H.

Most biochemical and structural studies concern the two ubiquitous enzymes named μ- and m-calpain exerting their in vitrocatalytic activity at micromolar (10–50 μm) or millimolar (0.2–0.35 mm) Ca2+ concentrations, respectively (1Sorimachi H. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 721-732Google Scholar). The calpain from the Ca2+-activated proteolytic system of human erythrocytes is a μ-calpain localized in the cell soluble fraction that in vitro binds a maximum of eight equivalents of Ca2+ with a K d of ∼25 μm (9Michetti M. Salamino F. Minafra R. Melloni E. Pontremoli S. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 721-726Google Scholar). In vivo, μ-calpain seems to be activated at physiological Ca2+ concentrations of 100–300 nm, suggesting the involvement of other activators (10Melloni E. Michetti M. Salamino F. Pontremoli S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12827-12831Google Scholar). These isoforms of calpain are heterodimers consisting of an 80 kDa catalytic large L-subunit and a 28 kDa small S-subunit, whose function probably consists in the regulation of the catalytic one (1Sorimachi H. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 721-732Google Scholar). On the basis of amino acid homologies, the L-subunit has been described as comprising four domains, namely dI to dIV, while the S-subunit contains dV and dVI domains (11Ohno S. Emori Y. Imajoh S. Kawasaki H. Kisaragi M. Suzuki K. Nature. 1984; 312: 566-570Google Scholar, 12Strobl S. Fernandez-Catalan C. Braun M. Huber R. Masumoto H. Nakagawa K. Irie A. Sorimachi H. Bourenkow G. Bartunik H. Suzuki K. Bode W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 588-592Google Scholar). Two subdomains dIIa and dIIb are distinguished within the dII domain, which shows some similarity to papain, while dIV and dVI are calmodulin-like domains containing EF-hands. A different domain classification, based on the crystal structure of rat calpain, has also been proposed (13Hosfield C.M. Elce J.S. Davies P.L. Jia Z. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6880-6889Google Scholar). In the latter, the domain dI includes domain I and subdomain dIIa whereas dII corresponds to the sole subdomain dIIb of the previous nomenclature. Here, we use the second, structure-based, nomenclature accompanied by the first one in parentheses to facilitate reference to previous reports. In the presence of Ca2+, calpain undergoes autoproteolysis (14Melloni E. Michetti M. Salamino F. Minafra R. Pontremoli S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 229: 193-197Google Scholar). This reaction has been demonstrated to be inhibited by several inhibitors including leupeptin andtrans-epoxysuccinyl-L-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)butane (E64). Previous studies indicate that the binding of both inhibitors requires the presence of Ca2+ (9Michetti M. Salamino F. Minafra R. Melloni E. Pontremoli S. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 721-726Google Scholar, 15Sasaki T. Kikuchi T. Yumoto N. Yoshimura N. Murachi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12489-12494Google Scholar, 16Yoshizawa T. Sorimachi H. Tomioka S. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 358: 101-103Google Scholar, 17Crawford C. Brown N.R. Willis A.C. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 135-142Google Scholar). The kinetics of Ca2+ binding and the onset of proteolytic activity in native calpain and its isolated subunits have been studied, and activity has been shown to appear only after a delay. This delay has been attributed to a Ca2+-induced conformational change making the active site of the enzyme accessible to the substrate (9Michetti M. Salamino F. Minafra R. Melloni E. Pontremoli S. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 721-726Google Scholar). It has been proposed that Ca2+ causes the dissociation of the calpain heterodimer into the constitutive L- and S-subunits (16Yoshizawa T. Sorimachi H. Tomioka S. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 358: 101-103Google Scholar,18Suo S. Koike H. Sorimachi H. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 63-66Google Scholar) thereby yielding the active form of the proteinase (19Bessiere P. Cottin P. Balny C. Ducastaing A. Bancel F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1430: 254-261Google Scholar). However, whether the dissociation has to be considered as the early step in the calpain activation process is still under discussion. Indeed, Nakagawaet al. (20Nakagawa K. Masumoto H. Sorimachi H. Suzuki K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 130: 605-611Google Scholar) suggested that the autolysis of the protein is necessary for the dissociation of m-calpain, whereas Pal et al. (21Pal G.P. Elce J.S. Jia Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47233-47238Google Scholar). observed calpain dissociation, although using the inactive C105S-80k/21k m-calpain form. The crystal structures of Ca2+-free recombinant human and rat m-calpains have recently been determined at 2.3 and 2.6 Å resolution, respectively (12Strobl S. Fernandez-Catalan C. Braun M. Huber R. Masumoto H. Nakagawa K. Irie A. Sorimachi H. Bourenkow G. Bartunik H. Suzuki K. Bode W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 588-592Google Scholar, 13Hosfield C.M. Elce J.S. Davies P.L. Jia Z. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6880-6889Google Scholar). In the absence of Ca2+, m-calpain displays a flat oval disk-like shape with the papain-like catalytic domains dI and dII (or dIIa and dIIb) located at one pole and the calmodulin-like domains dIV-dVI at the opposite pole. The analysis of the crystal structure reveals that some residues of the active site, which are crucial to the proteolytic activity of the protein, are not correctly positioned with respect to the substrate binding site in the unliganded state (12Strobl S. Fernandez-Catalan C. Braun M. Huber R. Masumoto H. Nakagawa K. Irie A. Sorimachi H. Bourenkow G. Bartunik H. Suzuki K. Bode W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 588-592Google Scholar), suggesting the requirement for a structural rearrangement leading to the active form. The authors of the human m-calpain crystal structure postulated the existence of an electrostatic switch caused by the binding of Ca2+ at the interface between dII (dIIb) and the negatively charged loop of dIII, a proposal supported by recent studies carried out on calpain mutants (22Hosfield C.M. Moldoveanu T. Davies P.L. Elce J.S. Jia Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7404-7407Google Scholar). More recently, Moldoveanu et al. (23Moldoveanu T. Hosfield C.M. Lim D. Elce J.S. Jia Z. Davies P.L. Cell. 2002; 108: 649-660Google Scholar) determined the crystal structure of a Ca2+-bound construct of μ-calpain comprising only the dI (dIIa) and dII (dIIb) domains. In this so-called minicalpain structure, Ca2+ is seen bound to two non-EF-hand sites, one in each domain, thereby inducing a structural rearrangement of the active site leading to a correct positioning of the catalytic triad. Previous crystallographic studies on the Ca2+-free and Ca2+-bound isolated domain VI homodimer detected very small conformational changes at the level of the S-subunit upon Ca2+-binding (24Blanchard H. Grochulski P., Li, Y. Arthur J.S. Davies P.L. Elce J.S. Cygler M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 532-538Google Scholar, 25Lin G.D. Chattopadhyay D. Maki M. Wang K.K. Carson M. Jin L. Yuen P.W. Takano E. Hatanaka M. DeLucas L.J. Narayana S.V. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 539-547Google Scholar, 26Cygler M. Grochulski P. Blanchard H. Methods Mol. Biol. 2002; 172: 243-260Google Scholar). However, direct experimental evidence of the overall structural modifications occurring in the complete calpain in solution during its activation is still lacking. We have therefore undertaken a study of the effect of Ca2+and inhibitors of calpain on the enzyme conformation using small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) 1The abbreviations used are: SAXS, small angle x-ray scattering; E64, trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido (4-guanidino)butane; SE-HPLC, size exclusion high pressure liquid chromatography; RMSD, root mean-squared deviation. in solution. This method has been widely used to determine low resolution protein structures and conformational changes and is very sensitive to modifications of the state of aggregation of proteins in solution (27Grossmann J.G. Sharff A.J. O'Hare P. Luisi B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6267-6274Google Scholar, 28Shi L. Kataoka M. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3297-3308Google Scholar). Synchrotron radiation x-ray small angle scattering measurements were carried out on calpain isolated from human erythrocytes. Different solutions of the proteinase were analyzed both in the absence and in the presence of Ca2+. We also investigated the calpain structure in the presence of two different inhibitors, the synthetic inhibitor trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido (4-guanidino)butane (E64), which is known to react with the -SH group at the active site, and the neutral serine and thiol protease inhibitor leupeptin, again in the absence or presence of Ca2+. The shape of the unliganded molecule fits well with the envelope of the crystal structure. While Ca2+ triggers the aggregation of calpain, the molecule remains heterodimeric in solution in the additional presence of inhibitors, allowing us to detect and characterize a conformational change, which appears to be compatible with the mechanism put forward on the basis of the crystal structures. Calpain was purified from human erythrocytes according to Michetti et al. (29Michetti M. Salamino F. Tedesco I. Averna M. Minafra R. Melloni E. Pontremoli S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 11-15Google Scholar) and dissolved in 50 mm sodium borate buffer, pH 7.5 containing 0.1 mm EDTA. Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford method (30Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). The effect of Ca2+ was studied both in the presence and in the absence of 100 μm E64 and leupeptin using the following five different Ca2+ concentrations in excess with respect to the EDTA concentration (i.e. free Ca2+): 10, 25, 100, 200, and 1000 μm. SAXS measurements were performed using the synchrotron radiation beam line D24 at the DCI storage ring of LURE (Laboratoire pour l'Utilisation du Rayonnement Électromagnétique, Orsay, France). The instrument, the data acquisition system (31Boulin C. Kempf R. Koch M.H.J. McLaughlin S.M. Nucl. Instrum. and Meth. 1986; : 399-407Google Scholar), and the evacuated measuring cell (32Dubuisson J.M. Decamps T. Vachette P. J. Appl. Cryst. 1997; 30: 49-54Google Scholar) have already been described. To avoid any possible protein damage due to x-ray irradiation, the protein solution was slowly circulated in the measuring quartz capillary at the constant temperature of 20 °C. In the course of several measuring sessions, samples from four different preparations were used. Freshly prepared samples of calpain were measured in the buffer used in the final step of purification. The monodispersity of each sample was checked immediately before SAXS measurements by SE-HPLC (Waters 486 System with a Shodex Protein KW-802.5 column). Eight frames of 100 s each were recorded using a position-sensitive proportional detector placed 1819 mm downstream from the sample so as to cover the range of momentum transfer q from 0.01 to 0.15 Å−1(q = 4πsinθ/λ, where 2θ is the scattering angle, λ is the radiation wavelength, λ = 1.488 Å, absorption K-edge of Nickel). Frames were visually inspected to check for x-ray damage; none was found. Data were scaled to the transmitted intensity before computing the average and RMSD of each measurement and subtracting the scattering from the corresponding buffer. The structural parameters characterizing calpain in solution were calculated using the following standard procedures. At very small angles, the intensity scattered by a particle can be approximated by a Gaussian curve (33Guinier A. Fournet G. Small Angle scattering of X-rays. Wiley, New York1955Google Scholar) as in Equation 1, I(q)≈I(0)·exp(−q2Rg2/3)Equation 1 and the slope of a Guinier plot (ln[I(q)] versus q 2) readily yields the value of the radius of gyration R g of the particle and the value of the intensity at the origin I(0). This approximation is valid over a restricted q-range (typicallyR g q<1.3). When put on an absolute scale, e.g. by means of a reference sample,I(0)/c (c, protein concentration of the sample) is proportional to the molecular mass m of the protein. Here, the calibration was performed using both the isolated subunit of the hemocyanin from Carcinus aestuarii (sedimentation coefficient 5 S, m = 75 kDa) and its hexameric form (sedimentation coefficient 16 S, m = 450 kDa) (34Dainese E., Di Muro P. Beltramini M. Salvato B. Decker H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 256: 350-358Google Scholar). The distance distribution function p(r) corresponds to the distribution of distances between any two volume elements within one particle. It has been determined using the indirect transform method as implemented in the program GNOM (35Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1992; 25: 495-503Google Scholar). This function provides an alternative estimate of the radius of gyration derived through the relationship shown in Equation 2. Rg2=∫r2p(r)dr2∫p(r)drEquation 2 Scattering intensities were computed from the atomic coordinates of the crystal structure of human m-calpain (1kfu.pdb) by using the program CRYSOL, which takes into account the hydration water by introducing a 3 Å thick border layer surrounding the molecule (36Svergun D.I. Barberato C. Koch M.H. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1995; 28: 768-773Google Scholar). The calculated scattering profile is fitted to the experimental pattern using only two adjustable parameters, the excluded volume of the particle V and the electron density in the border layer ρb, to minimize the discrepancy as shown in Equation3, χ2=1N−1∑i=1NIe(qi)−I(qi)ς(qi)2Equation 3 where N is the number of experimental points andI e(q i) and ς(q i) denote the experimental scattering curve and its RMSD, respectively. The ab initio shape determination was performed with the dummy atom model (DAM) method (37Svergun D.I. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2879-2886Google Scholar) using the program DAMMIN running on a Silicon Graphics O2 work station. A sphere of diameterDmax is filled by closely packed small spheres (dummy atoms) of radius r0≪Dmax. The DAM structure is defined by a configuration vector Xwith N ≈ (Dmax/r0)3 components. Using simulated annealing, the program searches for a configuration that fits the experimental data while a looseness penalty ensures the compactness and connectivity of the solution (37Svergun D.I. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2879-2886Google Scholar). No particular condition of oblateness of the particle shape was imposed as constraint in these calculations. The resulting shape together with the high resolution crystal structure were displayed and manipulated using the graphical software package ASSA (38Kozin M.B. Volkov V.V. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 811-815Google Scholar). The superimposition of the pdb structures with the three-dimensional models of the protein obtained with the DAM method was performed using the program SUPCOMB (39Kozin M.B. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2001; 34: 33-41Google Scholar). The unliganded μ-calpain, at a concentration of 1.6 mg/ml (14.8 μm), shows a value of the radius of gyration calculated from the Guinier analysis of the scattering intensity (Fig.1) of R g = 35.8 ± 0.4 Å. The molecular mass of the native protein calculated from the zero-angle intensity has a value of 110 ± 10 kDa, in close agreement with the value of 108 kDa typical for both μ- and m-isoforms of calpain (1Sorimachi H. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 721-732Google Scholar). This confirms that under our experimental conditions protein solutions are monodisperse (i.e. no species with a different molecular mass can be detected) and the interparticle interactions are negligible. Calculation of the pair distribution function of the unliganded enzyme yields a value for the maximal diameter Dmax of the protein of 120 Å with a value of the radius of gyration of 36.3 ± 0.4 Å, very close to that derived from the Guinier analysis. The program CRYSOL was used to calculate the SAXS pattern from the atomic coordinates of Ca2+-free human m-calpain (1kfu.pdb), which is shown in Fig. 2 together with the experimental scattering curve. The calculated curve, which corresponds to a dry excluded volume of 122 nm3 and to an electron density contrast in the solvation shell δρb = 44 e/nm3 (i.e. density of the solvent in the shell 1.13 g/cm3), neatly fits our experimental data (χ = 1.395). In parallel, an ab initio determination of the overall shape of the unliganded μ-calpain from the SAXS pattern was performed using the program DAMMIN (see “Experimental Procedures”). Ten independent calculations were performed and yielded very similar shapes. A typical result is presented in Fig.3 superimposed on the crystal structure of the human m-calpain. The shape provides a satisfactory fit envelope to the crystal structure.Figure 3Superimposition of the low-resolution shape of Ca2+-free human calpain.

This is not unexpected, considering that the high resolution structure of m-calpain from rat 2Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics Protein Databank, 1df0.pdb.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6880-6889Google Scholar) is very similar to its human counterpart 3Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics Protein Databank, 1kfu.pdb. The atomic coordinates for the crystal structure of this protein are available in the Molecular Modeling Database (www.nnlm.nlm.nih.gov/mar/molbio/3D/index.htm) under MMDB: 18112 (12Strobl S.

(12Strobl S. Fernandez-Catalan C. Braun M. Huber R. Masumoto H. Nakagawa K. Irie A. Sorimachi H. Bourenkow G. Bartunik H. Suzuki K. Bode W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 588-592Google Scholar) with an RMSD over 800 Cα atoms of 1.55 Å. It also demonstrates that the overall shape of the protein does not undergo any significant distortion inside the crystal lattice, a non-trivial result in the case of a multidomain protein for which significant differences between the structure in solution and in the crystal may be observed (40Svergun D.I. Barberato C. Koch M.H. Fetler L. Vachette P. Proteins. 1997; 27: 110-117Google Scholar). μ-Calpain solutions were studied in the presence of variable amounts of Ca2+. At 10 and 25 μm free Ca2+, the scattering curves were identical to that obtained in the absence of Ca2+ (data not shown). In the presence of 100 μm (and 200 μm) free Ca2+, the SAXS pattern displays conspicuous differences from that of the unliganded protease (Fig. 4, dashed line), most notably a marked upward curvature at small angles, which is an unambiguous indication of the formation of large soluble aggregates with a broad size distribution. The addition of 1 mm free Ca2+ causes the formation of amorphous precipitates. Furthermore, preliminary experiments show that the aggregation process observed at 100 μm Ca2+is essentially reversed upon addition of an excess of EDTA or in the presence of 100 mm NaCl, KCl, or NaSCN, confirming the observations of Pal et al. (21Pal G.P. Elce J.S. Jia Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47233-47238Google Scholar). Although aggregation is thought to originate from a conformational change triggered by Ca2+, its effect dominates the scattering pattern at small angles to such an extent that this putative modification in shape cannot even be detected. To investigate whether the aggregation phenomenon can be related to the autoproteolysis process, we resorted to inhibitors of calpain. E64 is a specific inhibitor for cysteine proteases, which irreversibly binds to the SH group at the active site forming a thioether linkage. In the case of calpains, this inhibitor is effective only in the presence of Ca2+ (9Michetti M. Salamino F. Minafra R. Melloni E. Pontremoli S. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 721-726Google Scholar, 17Crawford C. Brown N.R. Willis A.C. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 135-142Google Scholar), as is the competitive inhibitor leupeptin (15Sasaki T. Kikuchi T. Yumoto N. Yoshimura N. Murachi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12489-12494Google Scholar). In the presence of either E64 or leupeptin inhibitor at a concentration of 100 μm, the addition of 100 or 200 μmfree Ca2+ does not cause the previously observed strong increase in the intensity at small angles. This means that no high molecular mass aggregates are formed. The Guinier analysis of each scattering curve yields a slightly larger value of the radius of gyration (R g = 38.5 ± 0.7 Å) with respect to the value calculated for the protein in the absence of Ca2+. Furthermore, the comparison of the pair distribution functions of the protein under these two experimental conditions (Fig.5) shows a shift to higher distances in the position of the maximum of the p(r) function (rmax) by about 4 Å, while the maximum dimension of the particle (Dmax) increases from 120 to 130 Å in the presence of Ca2+. The value ofI(0)/c (where c is the protein concentration), and therefore the molecular mass of the protein, remains constant, which rules out any significant dissociation of calpain into its subunits. The absence of large aggregates suggests that the observed small conformational change induced by Ca2+ binding in the presence of inhibitors, does not lead to the exposure of hydrophobic surfaces. In contrast, the addition of 1 mm Ca2+ leads to the formation of amorphous precipitates, as already observed in the absence of inhibitor. Thus, in the presence of inhibitor, the solution of calpain remains monodisperse upon the addition of 100 or 200 μm free Ca2+; the protein does not dissociate either but undergoes a transition to a more extended conformation. As a control that this change in the scattering pattern was not due to a spurious effect of the inhibitor, scattering curves were recorded with solutions of human erythrocyte calpain containing 100 μmof each inhibitor but no free Ca2+. The two curves are virtually indistinguishable from that of the unliganded molecule (data not shown). The calpain aggregation process together with subunit dissociation have been systematically studied with the inactive C105S-80k/21k m-calpain from rat using light scattering (21Pal G.P. Elce J.S. Jia Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47233-47238Google Scholar). In particular, using both Tris and HEPES buffers at a pH value around neutrality and with a protein concentration of 0.7 μm, the Ca2+concentration required for inactive C105S-80k/21k m-calpain to aggregate ranges from 0.8 to 2 mm. These values are well in excess of the free Ca2+ concentration of only 100 μm at which we reproducibly observed the formation of large soluble aggregates, but the concentration of μ-calpain used in our SAXS measurements was 14.6 μm (i.e. more than 20-fold that used in light scattering measurements). Since the subunit dissociation is a process dependent on protein concentration, ionic strength and salt concentration, a direct and detailed comparison between our results and the studies of Pal et al. (21Pal G.P. Elce J.S. Jia Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47233-47238Google Scholar) is hindered by the differences between proteins (i.e. human μ-calpain versus rat m-calpain), by the large differences in the concentrations used, and by the different sensitivity of the various methods to the presence of small amounts of oligomers. In the conclusion to the study by Pal et al. (21Pal G.P. Elce J.S. Jia Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47233-47238Google Scholar), the subunit dissociation is described as a dynamic process triggered by Ca2+, and the aggregation is said to be most likely caused by the exposure of hydrophobic patches from the dimerization surfaces following dissociation. Based on this view, a possible explanation for our observations suggests itself: the persistence of the heterodimeric form in the presence of Ca2+ and inhibitors might reflect the influence of inhibitors on the dynamic equilibrium of subunit association/dissociation triggered by Ca2+, which could be shifted toward association because of structural constraints imposed by inhibitor binding. However, while this proposal could apply in the case of the larger natural inhibitor calpastatin, which binds to both subunits and thereby stabilizes the heterodimer (21Pal G.P. Elce J.S. Jia Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47233-47238Google Scholar, 41Takano E., Ma, H. Yang H.Q. Maki M. Hatanaka M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 93-97Google Scholar), it seems of little relevance in the case of the binding of the small inhibitors used in our work. Indeed, the crystal structures of complexes of papain with E64 (42Varughese K.I. Ahmed F.R. Carey P.R. Hasnain S. Huber C.P. Storer A.C. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1330-1332Google Scholar) and leupeptin (43Schroder E. Phillips C. Garman E. Harlos K. Crawford C. FEBS Lett. 1993; 315: 38-42Google Scholar) show both inhibitors inserted in the active site, far from the interface between L- and S-subunits. Assuming that inhibitors bind in a similar way to calpain, their influence on the subunit association could only be indirect and most likely limited. An alternative explanation for the persistence of the heterodimeric form in the presence of Ca2+ and inhibitors is that under our experimental conditions (i.e. Ca2+/calpain molar ratio of ∼7–14), Ca2+ binding causes the small conformational change observed by SAXS with no detectable effect on the dynamic dissociation/association equilibrium and that the alteration of the latter can only occur at higher Ca2+ concentration (precipitates are observed at 1 mm also with inhibitors) or following autoproteolysis in the absence of inhibitors. It seems plausible that the conformational change observed by SAXS in the μ-calpain from human erythrocytes in the presence of inhibitors and 100 μm Ca2+ also occurs in the case of the inactive C105S-80k/21k m-calpain but at a Ca2+concentration lower than that required for aggregation as determined by light scattering (21Pal G.P. Elce J.S. Jia Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47233-47238Google Scholar). This proposal could be established using a technique sensitive to conformation changes such as SAXS. Nevertheless, our results are already supported by the observation that the inactive mutant form of m-calpain C105S-m80k/30k does not dissociate in the presence of Ca2+ as recently reported by Nakagawa et al. (20Nakagawa K. Masumoto H. Sorimachi H. Suzuki K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 130: 605-611Google Scholar). The results of ten independent ab initio analyses, carried out using the program DAMMIN on the SAXS data of the proteinase in the presence of 100 μm E64 and 100 μm free Ca2+, yield similar low resolution models. A typical model is reported in Fig. 6, model C. As already suggested by the observed increase of both thermax and the Dmax values from the p(r) analysis, the resulting shape appears to be more elongated than the model obtained for the native calpain (Fig. 6, model B). Most noticeable is the appearance of a protuberance at one end of the particle separated from the rest of the molecule by a slight constriction like a neck barely visible or absent on the models for the unliganded enzyme. The crystal structure of the unliganded enzyme shows that the two domains dI and dII (or dIIa and dIIb) contain the catalytic triad responsible for the protease activity and are located at one end of the molecule (12Strobl S. Fernandez-Catalan C. Braun M. Huber R. Masumoto H. Nakagawa K. Irie A. Sorimachi H. Bourenkow G. Bartunik H. Suzuki K. Bode W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 588-592Google Scholar, 13Hosfield C.M. Elce J.S. Davies P.L. Jia Z. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6880-6889Google Scholar). The active site is however split in two parts, one on each domain, and a mutual movement bringing the two domains together is required to activate the enzyme, an event triggered by Ca2+ binding. Using a μI-II minicalpain, which could be crystallized in the presence of Ca2+, a conformational change has been recently observed that brings the two domains dI (dIIa) and dII (dIIb) together and the active site residues in a suitable position for catalysis (23Moldoveanu T. Hosfield C.M. Lim D. Elce J.S. Jia Z. Davies P.L. Cell. 2002; 108: 649-660Google Scholar). When we consider this process in the context of the entire heterodimer, a more compact protuberance would be formed at the upper end of the proteinase, in agreement with our results. Moreover, at the opposite end of the protein our ab initio model of the Ca2+-bound calpain does not display significant differences with the model obtained for the unliganded form (Fig. 6, C versus B andA). These results are in agreement with the crystallographic studies carried out on the Ca2+-free and Ca2+-bound isolated domain VI homodimer of the S-subunit that detected very localized conformational changes in this region of the proteinase (25Lin G.D. Chattopadhyay D. Maki M. Wang K.K. Carson M. Jin L. Yuen P.W. Takano E. Hatanaka M. DeLucas L.J. Narayana S.V. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 539-547Google Scholar), which would go unnoticed using SAXS (24Blanchard H. Grochulski P., Li, Y. Arthur J.S. Davies P.L. Elce J.S. Cygler M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 532-538Google Scholar,26Cygler M. Grochulski P. Blanchard H. Methods Mol. Biol. 2002; 172: 243-260Google Scholar). In conclusion, our results constitute the first direct experimental evidence that Ca2+ binding, in the presence of inhibitor, triggers a conformational transition of the undissociated heterodimeric form of calpain. Although at low resolution, our model is compatible with the already observed dI-dII (dIIa-dIIb) movement (23Moldoveanu T. Hosfield C.M. Lim D. Elce J.S. Jia Z. Davies P.L. Cell. 2002; 108: 649-660Google Scholar). Indeed, inhibitors which cannot bind in the absence of Ca2+ do so irreversibly with high reactivity (E64) (9Michetti M. Salamino F. Minafra R. Melloni E. Pontremoli S. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 721-726Google Scholar) or with high affinity (leupeptin, μ-calpain K i = 3.2 ×10−7m, m-calpain K i = 4.3 ×10−7m) (15Sasaki T. Kikuchi T. Yumoto N. Yoshimura N. Murachi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12489-12494Google Scholar) in the presence of Ca2+, which could imply that the active site undergoes a conformational change leading to the active conformation as already suggested by Crawford et al. (17Crawford C. Brown N.R. Willis A.C. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 135-142Google Scholar). This result, together with previous studies discussed above, suggests that in the presence of Ca2+ and inhibitors, human μ-calpain could also adopt an active conformation without subunit dissociation. Clearly, this proposal can only be validated by the high resolution structure of our complex. Precisely, the availability of monodisperse solutions of Ca2+-bound μ-calpain open the way to the crystallization and subsequent high resolution structural analysis of the intact heterodimeric calpain in the presence of Ca2+. The conformational change observed in the presence of Ca2+ and inhibitors could be a likely requirement for the interaction with the natural inhibitor, calpastatin (14Melloni E. Michetti M. Salamino F. Minafra R. Pontremoli S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 229: 193-197Google Scholar, 44Pontremoli R. Melloni E. Salamino F. Carafoli E. Klee C. Calcium as a cellular regulator.

We report a novel finding that actin can act as a cofactor for the adenovirus proteinase (AVP) in the degradation of cytoskeletal proteins.

For AVP to cleave cytokeratin 18, a cellular cofactor was shown to be required, consistent with AVP being synthesized as an inactive proteinase. Actin was considered a cellular cofactor for AVP, because the C terminus of actin is homologous to a viral cofactor for AVP.

During viral infections, different properties of actin are exploited (1Cudmore S. Reckmann I. Way M. Trends Microbiol. 1997; 5: 142-148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Actin has been shown to play a role in the transcription of several paramyxoviridae genomes. Actin stimulates human parainfluenza virus type 3 transcription; depletion of actin abolishes viral mRNA synthesis (2De B.P. Lesoon A. Banerjee A.K. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 3268-3275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A hallmark of oncogenic transformation by RNA tumor viruses is the loss of cytoskeletal integrity resulting from the disappearance of actin stress fibers, perturbation of focal adhesions, and aggregation of actin near the ventral surface of the transformed cell (3Boschek C.B. Jockusch B.M. Friis R.R. Back R. Grundmann E. Bauer H. Cell. 1981; 24: 175-184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In the case of human immunodeficiency virus, the Gag protein, which is both necessary and sufficient for viral budding, is associated with the actin cytoskeleton in vitro (4Rey O. Canon J. Krogstad P. Virology. 1996; 220: 530-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and their association at the plasma membrane may play a role in the budding of retroviruses. During baculovirus infection byAutographa californica M nuclear polyhedrosis virus, there is a dramatic rearrangement and eventual destruction of the actin cytoskeleton (5Lanier L.M. Slack J.M. Volkman L.E. Virology. 1996; 216: 380-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The virus encodes a proteinase that specifically degrades actin. Here we reveal another property of actin that is exploited by a virus; actin can act as a cofactor to stimulate a virus-coded proteinase.Throughout an adenovirus infection, the actin, cytokeratin, tubulin, and vimentin networks that make up the cytoskeleton of the cell undergo dramatic changes (6Staufenbiel M. Epple P. Deppert W. J. Virol. 1986; 60: 1186-1191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Chen et al. (7Chen P.H. Ornelles D.A. Shenk T. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3507-3514Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that late in an adenovirus infection, cytokeratin 18 is cleaved at two contiguous adenovirus proteinase (AVP) 1The abbreviations used for: AVP, adenovirus proteinase; pVIc, 11-amino acid peptide, GVQSLKRRRCF, that originates from the C terminus of the viral precursor protein pVI; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; GFP, green fluorescent protein. 1The abbreviations used for: AVP, adenovirus proteinase; pVIc, 11-amino acid peptide, GVQSLKRRRCF, that originates from the C terminus of the viral precursor protein pVI; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; GFP, green fluorescent protein.consensus cleavage sequences, leading to the destruction of the cytokeratin network. In cells infected by a temperature-sensitive mutant of adenovirus that lacks proteinase activity at the non-permissive temperature, cytokeratin 18 is not cleaved, and the cytokeratin network remains intact.This observation raises a conundrum. Cleavage of cytokeratin 18 by AVP takes place in the cytoplasm, yet the proteinase is synthesized in an inactive form and is activated in the nucleus by two viral cofactors within immature virions. One cofactor is pVIc, an 11-amino acid peptide that originates from the C terminus of the precursor to protein VI, pVI (8Mangel W.F. McGrath W.J. Toledo D.L. Anderson C.W. Nature. 1993; 361: 274-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 9Webster A. Hay R.T. Kemp G. Cell. 1993; 72: 97-104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 10Baniecki M.L.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12349-12356Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and the other cofactor is adenovirus DNA (8Mangel W.F. McGrath W.J. Toledo D.L. Anderson C.W. Nature. 1993; 361: 274-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 11McGrath W.J. Baniecki M.L. Li C. McWhirter S.M. Brown M.T. Toledo D.L. Mangel W.F. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13237-13245Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Once AVP becomes activated, it cleaves the virion precursor proteins used in the assembly of virus particles, thereby rendering the virus particles infectious (12Weber J.M. Tihanyi K. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 595-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The two cofactors activate AVP by increasing the specificity constant,k cat/K m, for substrate hydrolysis (11McGrath W.J. Baniecki M.L. Li C. McWhirter S.M. Brown M.T. Toledo D.L. Mangel W.F. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13237-13245Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Compared with AVP alone, thek cat/K m increases 1,130-fold with an AVP-pVIc complex, 110-fold with an AVP-viral DNA complex, and 34,100-fold in the presence of both pVIc and viral DNA. Presumably, if AVP were synthesized in an active form, it would cleave virion precursor proteins before virion assembly thereby aborting the infection (10Baniecki M.L. McGrath W.J. McWhirter S.M.

Labrecque P. Weber J.M. Virology. 1995; 209: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).In this study the conundrum of how AVP may be activated in the cytoplasm is resolved; a new, cellular cofactor for AVP is described, actin. Cytokeratin 18 could not be cleaved by AVP in vitro. However, cytokeratin 18 could be cleaved by AVP in the cytoplasm of HeLa cells in the absence of other viral proteins. This prompted a search for a cellular cofactor. Actin was considered as a cofactor, because its C terminus shares homology with pVIc. In vitro, upon the binding of AVP to the C terminus of actin, the activity of AVP was greatly stimulated. In vitro, cytokeratin 18 could not be cleaved by AVP alone. Most important, in the presence of actin, cytokeratin 18 could be cleaved by AVP.DISCUSSIONThe experiments presented here resolve a conundrum. During an adenovirus infection, how is cytokeratin 18 cleaved by AVP in the cytoplasm since AVP is synthesized in an inactive form that is later activated in the nucleus within immature virions by two viral cofactors? Clearly, the cytokeratin network is destroyed in vivo during an adenovirus infection (23Zhang Y. Schneider R.J. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2544-2555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The transfection experiments with an AVP-GFP chimeric gene showed that AVP destroyed the cytokeratin network in the absence of any other viral components.In vitro, AVP was not able to cleave cytokeratin 18; however, it was able to utilize actin as a cofactor to cleave cytokeratin 18. Thus, AVP can utilize a cellular protein as a cofactor in the cleavage of cytokeratin 18.The rationale for actin being able to serve as a cofactor for AVP is that its C terminus is highly homologous to the viral cofactor pVIc; of the last 8 amino acid residues of actin, 4 are identical and 3 homologous to the last 8 amino acid residues in pVIc. This homology implied that AVP could bind to the C terminus of actin, and it did. Furthermore, this homology implied that actin, like pVIc, could stimulate the activity of AVP; it did so in a concentration-dependent manner.Are other data consistent with the C terminus of actin behaving like pVIc? Of the last 11 amino acids at the C terminus of actin, the 3 at the N terminus, AGP, are not homologous to those in pVIc, GVQ, whereas the next 8 amino acids are homologous. It has been reported that deletion of GVQ in pVIc results in an inactive cofactor (28Cabrita G. Iqbal M. Reddy H. Kemp G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5635-5639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). However, we have observed that deletion of GVQ from pVIc yielded a peptide that binds to AVP with only a 3-fold higher K d value and exhibits a 3-fold lower k cat value than that of wild-type pVIc. 2M. L. Baniecki and W. F. Mangel, unpublished observations. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis on pVIc indicates the GtoA mutant has a 13-fold higher K d value for binding to AVP; the VtoA mutant has a 7-fold lower k cat value for substrate hydrolysis, and the QtoA mutant behaves like wild-type pVIc (10Baniecki M.L. McGrath W.J. McWhirter S.M. Li C. Toledo D.L. Pellicena P. Barnard D.L. Thorn K.S. Mangel W.F. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12349-12356Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It is possible that PRODAN bound to Cys-374 enhanced the binding of AVP to the C terminus of actin. However, AVP binds to underivatized actin with an equilibrium dissociation constant of 4 nm as opposed to the equilibrium dissociation of 1.7 μm with PRODAN-labeled actin. 3M. T. Brown and W. F. Mangel, unpublished observations. Thus, PRODAN bound to Cys-347 of actin actually interferes with the binding of AVP to actin. Additionally, there is direct evidence that AVP binds to the C terminus of actin. We have observed that in the presence of DNA a peptide containing the amino acid sequence of the last 11 amino acids of actin specifically behaves as a cofactor in stimulating AVP and that a peptide with the same amino acids but in a randomly chosen sequence does not stimulate AVP.3There is no facile way to determine the relevance of our observation that actin can act as a cofactor for AVP in vitro to what occurs in vivo in an adenovirus-infected cell. Actin is an essential protein; therefore, a deletion mutant of actin will not be viable. However, given that cytokeratin 18 is cleaved by AVP in vivo (7Chen P.H. Ornelles D.A. Shenk T. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3507-3514Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), that in vitro AVP will not cleave cytokeratin 18 in the absence of a cofactor, that in vitro actin can act as a cofactor for the cleavage of cytokeratin 18, and that theK d value for the binding of actin to AVP is lower than the in vivo G-actin concentration, it seems very likely that in an adenovirus-infected cell, cytokeratin 18 is cleaved by an actin-AVP complex.During an adenovirus infection AVP is exposed to actin in the cytoplasm. In infected cells, proteinase activity can be detected as early as 14 h post-infection with maximal activity beginning at 20 h (29Bhatti A.R. Weber J. Virology. 1979; 96: 478-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). AVP can be detected in the cytoplasm and nucleus at 24 h post-infection by Western blot (30Webster A. Leith I.R. Hay R.T. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7292-7300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This timing correlates with the disassembly of the cytokeratin system that begins to fall apart at about 16 h post-infection (6Staufenbiel M. Epple P. Deppert W. J. Virol. 1986; 60: 1186-1191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), disassembly being complete at 36 h (7Chen P.H. Ornelles D.A. Shenk T. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3507-3514Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In virus-infected cells, cleavage of cytoskeletal proteins weakens the mechanical structure of the cell, and this may promote cell lysis and release of nascent virions (7Chen P.H. Ornelles D.A. Shenk T. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3507-3514Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). AVP cleaves cytokeratin 18 within the N-terminal domain yielding a 41-kDa fragment that is incapable of participating in filament elongation. Such fragments significantly inhibit the elongation of cytokeratin filaments, even when the amount of cleaved cytokeratin comprises only 1% of the population. Inspection of the amino acid sequences of other cytoskeletal proteins reveals AVP consensus cleavage sequences in tubulin, vimentin, and even actin itself (Fig. 2 a). The latter observation raised the possibility that actin may be a cofactor for its own destruction, and this was shown to occur.Degradation of cytoskeletal proteins by virus-coded proteinases during lytic infections is not unusual. The rhinovirus 2A proteinase cleaves cytokeratin 8 (31Seipelt J. Liebig H.-D. Sommergruber W. Gerner C. Kuechler E. J. Biol.

A. 1990; 87: 6336-6349Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). What is currently unique about AVP is that it uses actin as a cofactor. During viral infections, different properties of actin are exploited (1Cudmore S. Reckmann I. Way M. Trends Microbiol. 1997; 5: 142-148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar).

One cofactor is pVIc, an 11-amino acid peptide that originates from the C terminus of the precursor to protein VI, pVI (8Mangel W.F. McGrath W.J. Toledo D.L. Anderson C.W. Nature. 1993; 361: 274-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 9Webster A. Hay R.T. Kemp G. Cell. 1993; 72: 97-104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 10Baniecki M.L.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12349-12356Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and the other cofactor is adenovirus DNA (8Mangel W.F. McGrath W.J. Toledo D.L. Anderson C.W. Nature. 1993; 361: 274-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 11McGrath W.J. Baniecki M.L. Li C. McWhirter S.M. Brown M.T. Toledo D.L. Mangel W.F. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13237-13245Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Once AVP becomes activated, it cleaves the virion precursor proteins used in the assembly of virus particles, thereby rendering the virus particles infectious (12Weber J.M. Tihanyi K. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 595-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The two cofactors activate AVP by increasing the specificity constant,k cat/K m, for substrate hydrolysis (11McGrath W.J. Baniecki M.L. Li C. McWhirter S.M. Brown M.T. Toledo D.L. Mangel W.F. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13237-13245Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Compared with AVP alone, thek cat/K m increases 1,130-fold with an AVP-pVIc complex, 110-fold with an AVP-viral DNA complex, and 34,100-fold in the presence of both pVIc and viral DNA. Presumably, if AVP were synthesized in an active form, it would cleave virion precursor proteins before virion assembly thereby aborting the infection (10Baniecki M.L. McGrath W.J. McWhirter S.M.

Labrecque P. Weber J.M. Virology. 1995; 209: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In this study the conundrum of how AVP may be activated in the cytoplasm is resolved; a new, cellular cofactor for AVP is described, actin. Cytokeratin 18 could not be cleaved by AVP in vitro. However, cytokeratin 18 could be cleaved by AVP in the cytoplasm of HeLa cells in the absence of other viral proteins. This prompted a search for a cellular cofactor. Actin was considered as a cofactor, because its C terminus shares homology with pVIc. In vitro, upon the binding of AVP to the C terminus of actin, the activity of AVP was greatly stimulated. In vitro, cytokeratin 18 could not be cleaved by AVP alone. Most important, in the presence of actin, cytokeratin 18 could be cleaved by AVP. DISCUSSIONThe experiments presented here resolve a conundrum. During an adenovirus infection, how is cytokeratin 18 cleaved by AVP in the cytoplasm since AVP is synthesized in an inactive form that is later activated in the nucleus within immature virions by two viral cofactors? Clearly, the cytokeratin network is destroyed in vivo during an adenovirus infection (23Zhang Y. Schneider R.J. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2544-2555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The transfection experiments with an AVP-GFP chimeric gene showed that AVP destroyed the cytokeratin network in the absence of any other viral components.In vitro, AVP was not able to cleave cytokeratin 18; however, it was able to utilize actin as a cofactor to cleave cytokeratin 18. Thus, AVP can utilize a cellular protein as a cofactor in the cleavage of cytokeratin 18.The rationale for actin being able to serve as a cofactor for AVP is that its C terminus is highly homologous to the viral cofactor pVIc; of the last 8 amino acid residues of actin, 4 are identical and 3 homologous to the last 8 amino acid residues in pVIc. This homology implied that AVP could bind to the C terminus of actin, and it did. Furthermore, this homology implied that actin, like pVIc, could stimulate the activity of AVP; it did so in a concentration-dependent manner.Are other data consistent with the C terminus of actin behaving like pVIc? Of the last 11 amino acids at the C terminus of actin, the 3 at the N terminus, AGP, are not homologous to those in pVIc, GVQ, whereas the next 8 amino acids are homologous. It has been reported that deletion of GVQ in pVIc results in an inactive cofactor (28Cabrita G. Iqbal M. Reddy H. Kemp G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5635-5639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). However, we have observed that deletion of GVQ from pVIc yielded a peptide that binds to AVP with only a 3-fold higher K d value and exhibits a 3-fold lower k cat value than that of wild-type pVIc. 2M. L. Baniecki and W. F. Mangel, unpublished observations. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis on pVIc indicates the GtoA mutant has a 13-fold higher K d value for binding to AVP; the VtoA mutant has a 7-fold lower k cat value for substrate hydrolysis, and the QtoA mutant behaves like wild-type pVIc (10Baniecki M.L. McGrath W.J. McWhirter S.M. Li C. Toledo D.L. Pellicena P. Barnard D.L. Thorn K.S. Mangel W.F. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12349-12356Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It is possible that PRODAN bound to Cys-374 enhanced the binding of AVP to the C terminus of actin. However, AVP binds to underivatized actin with an equilibrium dissociation constant of 4 nm as opposed to the equilibrium dissociation of 1.7 μm with PRODAN-labeled actin. 3M. T. Brown and W. F. Mangel, unpublished observations. Thus, PRODAN bound to Cys-347 of actin actually interferes with the binding of AVP to actin. Additionally, there is direct evidence that AVP binds to the C terminus of actin. We have observed that in the presence of DNA a peptide containing the amino acid sequence of the last 11 amino acids of actin specifically behaves as a cofactor in stimulating AVP and that a peptide with the same amino acids but in a randomly chosen sequence does not stimulate AVP.3There is no facile way to determine the relevance of our observation that actin can act as a cofactor for AVP in vitro to what occurs in vivo in an adenovirus-infected cell. Actin is an essential protein; therefore, a deletion mutant of actin will not be viable. However, given that cytokeratin 18 is cleaved by AVP in vivo (7Chen P.H. Ornelles D.A. Shenk T. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3507-3514Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), that in vitro AVP will not cleave cytokeratin 18 in the absence of a cofactor, that in vitro actin can act as a cofactor for the cleavage of cytokeratin 18, and that theK d value for the binding of actin to AVP is lower than the in vivo G-actin concentration, it seems very likely that in an adenovirus-infected cell, cytokeratin 18 is cleaved by an actin-AVP complex.During an adenovirus infection AVP is exposed to actin in the cytoplasm. In infected cells, proteinase activity can be detected as early as 14 h post-infection with maximal activity beginning at 20 h (29Bhatti A.R. Weber J. Virology. 1979; 96: 478-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). AVP can be detected in the cytoplasm and nucleus at 24 h post-infection by Western blot (30Webster A. Leith I.R. Hay R.T. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7292-7300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This timing correlates with the disassembly of the cytokeratin system that begins to fall apart at about 16 h post-infection (6Staufenbiel M. Epple P. Deppert W. J. Virol. 1986; 60: 1186-1191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), disassembly being complete at 36 h (7Chen P.H. Ornelles D.A. Shenk T. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3507-3514Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In virus-infected cells, cleavage of cytoskeletal proteins weakens the mechanical structure of the cell, and this may promote cell lysis and release of nascent virions (7Chen P.H. Ornelles D.A. Shenk T. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3507-3514Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). AVP cleaves cytokeratin 18 within the N-terminal domain yielding a 41-kDa fragment that is incapable of participating in filament elongation. Such fragments significantly inhibit the elongation of cytokeratin filaments, even when the amount of cleaved cytokeratin comprises only 1% of the population. Inspection of the amino acid sequences of other cytoskeletal proteins reveals AVP consensus cleavage sequences in tubulin, vimentin, and even actin itself (Fig. 2 a). The latter observation raised the possibility that actin may be a cofactor for its own destruction, and this was shown to occur.Degradation of cytoskeletal proteins by virus-coded proteinases during lytic infections is not unusual. The rhinovirus 2A proteinase cleaves cytokeratin 8 (31Seipelt J. Liebig H.-D. Sommergruber W. Gerner C. Kuechler E. J. Biol.

They are attractive targets for antimalarial drug development. The two enzymes are 73% identical, yet have different substrate and inhibitor specificities. The x-ray structures of proform and mature PM II have been determined, but models of PM I do not adequately explain the selectivity of the two proteases. To better understand the basis of these recognition differences, we have identified nine residues of PM II that are in proximity to the inhibitor pepstatin in the crystal structure and differ in PM I. We mutated these residues in PM II to the cognate amino acids of PM I. Kinetic parameters for substrate and inhibitors for the PM II-mutant were similar to those of PM II-wild type (WT). Cleavage specificity was assessed using hemoglobin or a random decamer peptide library as substrate. Again, PM II-mutant behaved like PM II-WT rather than PM I-WT. These results indicate that differences in plasmepsin specificity depend more on conformational differences from distant sites than on specific active site variation.

Malaria is a disease caused by parasites of the genusPlasmodium. The disease afflicts several hundred million and kills up to 3 million annually, mainly children (1Trigg P.I. Kondrachine A.V. Bull. W.H.O. 1998; 76: 11-16Google Scholar). At the intra-erythrocytic stage, these parasites consume hemoglobin as a major nutrient source for parasite growth and maturation. Hemoglobin degradation is mediated by the action of several digestive enzymes in the acidic food vacuole. Plasmepsins are aspartic proteases found in the food vacuole that are essential for degradation of hemoglobin. There appear to be four plasmepsins involved in hemoglobin degradation in the food vacuole of Plasmodium falciparum (2Banerjee R. Liu J. Beatty W. Pelosof L. Klemba M. Goldberg D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 990-995Google Scholar). PM I makes an initial cleavage at Phe-33-Leu-34 on the α-globin chain of hemoglobin (3Goldberg D.E. Slater A.F. Beavis R. Chait B. Cerami A. Henderson G.B. J. Exp.

Structures of PM II in both proforms and mature forms are available (15Silva A.M. Lee A.Y. Gulnik S.V. Maier P. Collins J. Bhat T.N. Collins P.J. Cachau R.E. Luker K.E. Gluzman I.Y. Francis S.E.

Active, recombinant PM I has been generated (13Moon R.P. Tyas L. Certa U. Rupp K. Bur D. Jacquet C. Matile H. Loetscher H. Grueninger-Leitch F. Kay J. Dunn B.M. Berry C. Ridley R.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 552-560Google Scholar), but its limited yield and solubility have prevented its crystallization.Based on the structure of PM II co-crystallized with pepstatin, a specific peptide inhibitor of aspartic proteases (15Silva A.M. Lee A.Y. Gulnik S.V. Maier P. Collins J. Bhat T.N. Collins P.J. Cachau R.E. Luker K.E. Gluzman I.Y. Francis S.E. Oksman A. Goldberg D.E. Erickson J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10034-10039Google Scholar), amino acid residues in the active site of PM II in proximity to the pepstatin molecule were compared with the corresponding amino acids in PM I. Nine amino acids that differed between the two enzymes were chosen for site-directed mutagenesis. We hypothesized that putting these nine amino acid residues of PM I in the PM II scaffold structure would give rise to a specificity similar to that of PM I. We hoped that this approach would allow us to obtain a structure of the PM I active site on the soluble PM II structure core. Unexpectedly, our data show that engineering a PM II with the active site surface of PM I largely maintains the PM II substrate and inhibitor specificity.RESULTSPM I and II are homologous, hemoglobin-degrading aspartic proteases. The mature enzyme sequences are 73% identical (85% homologous). Despite this, the two hydrolases display quite different substrate and inhibitor specificities. To better understand the basis for this difference, we examined the crystal structure of PM II bound to the inhibitor, pepstatin, and identified residues in the active site that are in contact with inhibitor. Nine such amino acids differ between PM I and PM II (Fig. 1). We changed all nine amino acids in the recombinant PM II background to the cognate residues found in PM I. We compared enzyme properties of the mutant PM II to those of wild-type PM I and II. Heterologous expression of recombinant PM I-WT, PM II-WT, and PM II-mutant yielded products of 43 kDa as determined by SDS-PAGE. Activation of these proplasmepsins by lowering the pH to 5 produced the 37-kDa mature forms (Fig.2).Figure 2Activation of plasmepsins upon lowering the pH to 5.0.

The IC50 of PM II-mutant is similar to that of PM II-WT.Table IIInhibition of plasmepsins by peptidomimetic compoundsPlasmepsinK i-PepstatinIC50-SC50083nmμmI-WT0.565 ± 0.2240.132II-WT0.037 ± 0.0103.467II-mutant0.061 ± 0.0244.467The fluorogenic substrate mentioned in Table I was used. For SC-50083, limited compound was available, so inhibition at a fixed substrate concentration (0.4 μm for PM II-WT and PM II-mutant; 0.8 μm for PM I-WT) and a varied inhibitor concentration was measured. Initial rates were determined at 37 °C using 0.3–5 nm enzyme. Open table in a new tab We analyzed the ability of the three enzymes to cleave a random decamer peptide library. N-terminal amino acid sequencing was performed after a 1-h incubation to determine the amino acid preference on the P′ side of the substrate (Fig. 3). Use of a similar dodecamer in other systems has been reported (21Turk B.E. Huang L.L. Piro E.T. Cantley L.C. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 661-667Google Scholar). The most dramatic preferences are seen at the P1′ position, where PM II-WT and PM II-mutant both prefer leucine about 4-fold more than the average amino acid and methionine about 2-fold. PM I-WT has a similar specificity, with a slightly diminished preference for these two residues and an increased preference for serine at P1′. At P2′, serine was preferred by each enzyme. At P3′–P5′ (not shown, variance <2-fold), amino acid preferences are on a much smaller scale and are comparable among the three plasmepsins (data not shown). Similar results were obtained from 4-h and overnight incubations of the random peptide substrate with each plasmepsin (data not shown).Figure 3Analysis of random 10-mer peptide cleavage by plasmepsins. A random peptide substrate was digested by PM I-WT, II-WT, and II-mutant at pH 5.0, 37 °C for 1 h. Cleavage preferences were analyzed by N-terminal amino acid sequencing. Data are normalized so that a value of 1 corresponds to the average quantity per amino acid in a given sequencing cycle. Because of interfering background peaks, glycine, threonine, and arginine could not be reliably quantitated and therefore were omitted.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To extend the results beyond use of peptides and peptide-like compounds, the natural substrate hemoglobin was incubated with each of the three enzymes. Fig. 4 shows the C18-reverse phase HPLC elution profile of peptide products. For a 4-h incubation, the PM II-mutant profile is similar to PM II-WT profile, but the PM I-WT profile is different. For overnight incubation, there are five major peaks of peptide products that differ between wild-type PM I and II. The PM II-mutant profile shares the PM II-WT profile at four of these sites.Figure 4C18 reverse phase-HPLC analysis of hemoglobin degradation products. Hemoglobin A was digested with PM I-WT, II-WT, and II-mutant at pH 5.0, 37 °C for 4 h (A) and 15 h (B).

We have mutated the PM II active site so that its surface mimics that of PM I. Surprisingly, the enzyme specificity is essentially unchanged from the parent enzyme. Based on the PM II crystal structure, Silva et al. (15Silva A.M. Lee A.Y. Gulnik S.V. Maier P. Collins J. Bhat T.N. Collins P.J. Cachau R.E. Luker K.E. Gluzman I.Y. Francis S.E. Oksman A. Goldberg D.E. Erickson J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10034-10039Google Scholar) suggested three amino acids that vary between PM I and II that might be important in selectivity: Thr-114, Leu-292, Phe-294. Our PM II-mutant includes these three changes, yet specificity was not altered. In some aspartic proteases, the polyproline loop can have interactions with substrate. This loop is divergent between the two plasmepsins. However, a swap of PM I and II loops has been carried out without effect on specificity (17Luker K.E. Francis S.E. Gluzman I.Y. Goldberg D.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 79: 71-78Google Scholar). Consistent with this, the loop does not appear to contact pepstatin in the crystal structure of PM II (15Silva A.M. Lee A.Y. Gulnik S.V. Maier P. Collins J. Bhat T.N. Collins P.J. Cachau R.E. Luker K.E. Gluzman I.Y. Francis S.E. Oksman A. Goldberg D.E. Erickson J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10034-10039Google Scholar). Although the high similarity of the two enzymes suggests the same overall folding topology, our findings indicated that there must be sufficient structural differences other than active site residues that influence selectivity of the plasmepsins.The proform and mature form of PM II may be regarded as two proteins with the same active site residues but different activity. Khanet al. (22Khan A.R. Khazanovich-Bernstein N. Bergmann E.M. James M.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10968-10975Google Scholar) have shown that this activity disparity is a result of alteration in active site conformation and not of active site blockage. Upon enzyme activation, the conformational change leads to the formation of a functional PM II active site (22Khan A.R. Khazanovich-Bernstein N. Bergmann E.M. James M.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10968-10975Google Scholar). For the case of PM I and PM II, it is possible that amino acid residues further away from the active site might cause some differences in their active site conformation and hence the differences in enzyme activity. The implication of our results is that differences in amino acid residues distant from the active site may play a significant role in determining specificity differences between two similar enzymes.Interestingly, the most dramatic range of PM II amino acid preference in the random peptide analysis was seen at the P1′ position. This position has not been extensively evaluated in other assays where the P1′ residue was fixed as a chromogenic reporter. As would be expected from previous analysis of globin cleavage sites (6Gluzman I.Y. Francis S.E. Oksman A. Smith C.E. Duffin K.L. Goldberg D.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1602-1608Google Scholar), PM II strongly preferred hydrophobic amino acids at the P1′ site. Proline was also accepted at this position, as is the case for the human immunodeficiency virus protease (23Poorman R.A. Tomasselli A.G. Heinrikson R.L. Kezdy F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14554-14561Google Scholar). The P1′ preference for leucine over the least favored amino acids was >50-fold. In contrast, at each of the other positions (P2′–P5′), all amino acids were tolerated within a 7-fold range.This work gives us insight into the importance of the overall fold of a protein molecule on substrate specificity. Even in quite similar proteins, the geometry of the active site, not just the surface side chains, can be different enough to affect specificity. We have much to learn about the PM I active site that can not be gleaned from homology modeling. Malaria is a disease caused by parasites of the genusPlasmodium. The disease afflicts several hundred million and kills up to 3 million annually, mainly children (1Trigg P.I. Kondrachine A.V. Bull. W.H.O. 1998; 76: 11-16Google Scholar). At the intra-erythrocytic stage, these parasites consume hemoglobin as a major nutrient source for parasite growth and maturation. Hemoglobin degradation is mediated by the action of several digestive enzymes in the acidic food vacuole. Plasmepsins are aspartic proteases found in the food vacuole that are essential for degradation of hemoglobin. There appear to be four plasmepsins involved in hemoglobin degradation in the food vacuole of Plasmodium falciparum (2Banerjee R. Liu J. Beatty W. Pelosof L. Klemba M. Goldberg D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 990-995Google Scholar). PM I makes an initial cleavage at Phe-33-Leu-34 on the α-globin chain of hemoglobin (3Goldberg D.E. Slater A.F. Beavis R. Chait B. Cerami A. Henderson G.B. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 961-969Google Scholar), presumably leading to the unraveling of the hemoglobin molecule such that further proteolysis by PM II, PM IV, histo-aspartic protease (HAP), falcipains, and facilysin can rapidly proceed (2Banerjee R. Liu J. Beatty W. Pelosof L. Klemba M. Goldberg D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 990-995Google Scholar, 4Goldberg D.E. Infect. Agents Dis. 1992; 1: 207-211Google Scholar, 5Francis S.E.

Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 64: 177-190Google Scholar). The small peptides formed from the action of these enzymes are converted to free amino acids by aminopeptidases and perhaps other enzymes (9Kolakovich K.A. Gluzman I.Y. Duffin K.L. Goldberg D.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 87: 123-135Google Scholar, 10Gavigan C.S. Dalton J.P. Bell A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 117: 37-48Google Scholar). The World Health Organization has recognized the plasmepsins as attractive targets for the design of novel chemotherapeutic compounds for the treatment of malaria (11Coombs G.H. Goldberg D.E. Klemba M. Berry C. Kay J. Mottram J.C. Trends Parasitol. 2001; 17: 532-537Google Scholar). The inhibition of their activities by peptidomimetic compounds specific for aspartic proteases results in death of the parasites (12Francis S.E. Gluzman I.Y. Oksman A. Knickerbocker A. Mueller R.

Chem. 1999; 42: 1428-1440Google Scholar). The elucidation of structure-activity relationships for these enzymes will facilitate the development of potent, specific inhibitors. Structures of PM II in both proforms and mature forms are available (15Silva A.M. Lee A.Y. Gulnik S.V. Maier P. Collins J. Bhat T.N. Collins P.J. Cachau R.E. Luker K.E. Gluzman I.Y. Francis S.E. Oksman A. Goldberg D.E. Erickson J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10034-10039Google Scholar, 16Bernstein N.K. Cherney M.M. Loetscher H. Ridley R.G. James M.N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 32-37Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the structure of PM I is still unknown, even though it is important in the first step of hemoglobin degradation. Active, recombinant PM I has been generated (13Moon R.P. Tyas L. Certa U. Rupp K. Bur D. Jacquet C. Matile H. Loetscher H. Grueninger-Leitch F. Kay J. Dunn B.M. Berry C. Ridley R.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 552-560Google Scholar), but its limited yield and solubility have prevented its crystallization. Based on the structure of PM II co-crystallized with pepstatin, a specific peptide inhibitor of aspartic proteases (15Silva A.M. Lee A.Y. Gulnik S.V. Maier P. Collins J. Bhat T.N. Collins P.J. Cachau R.E. Luker K.E. Gluzman I.Y. Francis S.E. Oksman A. Goldberg D.E. Erickson J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10034-10039Google Scholar), amino acid residues in the active site of PM II in proximity to the pepstatin molecule were compared with the corresponding amino acids in PM I. Nine amino acids that differed between the two enzymes were chosen for site-directed mutagenesis. We hypothesized that putting these nine amino acid residues of PM I in the PM II scaffold structure would give rise to a specificity similar to that of PM I. We hoped that this approach would allow us to obtain a structure of the PM I active site on the soluble PM II structure core. Unexpectedly, our data show that engineering a PM II with the active site surface of PM I largely maintains the PM II substrate and inhibitor specificity. RESULTSPM I and II are homologous, hemoglobin-degrading aspartic proteases. The mature enzyme sequences are 73% identical (85% homologous). Despite this, the two hydrolases display quite different substrate and inhibitor specificities. To better understand the basis for this difference, we examined the crystal structure of PM II bound to the inhibitor, pepstatin, and identified residues in the active site that are in contact with inhibitor. Nine such amino acids differ between PM I and PM II (Fig. 1). We changed all nine amino acids in the recombinant PM II background to the cognate residues found in PM I. We compared enzyme properties of the mutant PM II to those of wild-type PM I and II. Heterologous expression of recombinant PM I-WT, PM II-WT, and PM II-mutant yielded products of 43 kDa as determined by SDS-PAGE. Activation of these proplasmepsins by lowering the pH to 5 produced the 37-kDa mature forms (Fig.2).Table I shows the kinetic parameters of PM I-WT, PM II-WT, and PM II-mutant. Using a fluorogenic peptide based on the initial hemoglobin cleavage site, thek cat, K m, andk cat/K m values were comparable for PM II-WT and PM II-mutant. In contrast, these values differed for PM I-WT; most dramatically, the PM I-WT specificity constant (k cat/K m) was about 10-fold lower than those of the PM II enzymes.Table IKinetic parameters of plasmepsins using a fluorogenic substratePlasmepsinK mk catk cat/K mμmsec−1μmsec−1I-WT0.917 ± 0.1440.473 ± 0.1720.528 ± 0.232II-WT0.489 ± 0.0802.313 ± 0.0924.813 ± 0.795II-mutant0.430 ± 0.0642.206 ± 0.1345.196 ± 0.718DABCYL-GABA-Glu-Arg-Met-Phe*Leu-Ser-Phe-Pro-GABA-EDANS (17Luker K.E.

Collins J. Bhat T.N. Collins P.J. Cachau R.E. Luker K.E. Gluzman I.Y. Francis S.E. Oksman A. Goldberg D.E. Erickson J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10034-10039Google Scholar). Although the high similarity of the two enzymes suggests the same overall folding topology, our findings indicated that there must be sufficient structural differences other than active site residues that influence selectivity of the plasmepsins. The proform and mature form of PM II may be regarded as two proteins with the same active site residues but different activity. Khanet al. (22Khan A.R. Khazanovich-Bernstein N. Bergmann E.M. James M.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10968-10975Google Scholar) have shown that this activity disparity is a result of alteration in active site conformation and not of active site blockage. Upon enzyme activation, the conformational change leads to the formation of a functional PM II active site (22Khan A.R. Khazanovich-Bernstein N. Bergmann E.M. James M.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10968-10975Google Scholar). For the case of PM I and PM II, it is possible that amino acid residues further away from the active site might cause some differences in their active site conformation and hence the differences in enzyme activity. The implication of our results is that differences in amino acid residues distant from the active site may play a significant role in determining specificity differences between two similar enzymes. Interestingly, the most dramatic range of PM II amino acid preference in the random peptide analysis was seen at the P1′ position. This position has not been extensively evaluated in other assays where the P1′ residue was fixed as a chromogenic reporter. As would be expected from previous analysis of globin cleavage sites (6Gluzman I.Y. Francis S.E. Oksman A. Smith C.E. Duffin K.L. Goldberg D.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1602-1608Google Scholar), PM II strongly preferred hydrophobic amino acids at the P1′ site. Proline was also accepted at this position, as is the case for the human immunodeficiency virus protease (23Poorman R.A. Tomasselli A.G. Heinrikson R.L. Kezdy F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14554-14561Google Scholar). The P1′ preference for leucine over the least favored amino acids was >50-fold. In contrast, at each of the other positions (P2′–P5′), all amino acids were tolerated within a 7-fold range. This work gives us insight into the importance of the overall fold of a protein molecule on substrate specificity. Even in quite similar proteins, the geometry of the active site, not just the surface side chains, can be different enough to affect specificity. We have much to learn about the PM I active site that can not be gleaned from homology modeling. We thank Dr. Richard P. Moon for the plasmepsin I clone, Dr. Bela Tackac for the plasmepsin I purification protocol, Dr. Porntip Petmitr for FPLC facilities, Dr. Dave McCourt for N-terminal amino acid sequencing, and Dr. Eva Istvan for critical review of this manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2045734993,"Because of the apparently greater conformational flexibility of yeast versus muscle actin and the ability of other members in the actin protein superfamily to efficiently use both ATP and GTP, we assessed the ability of yeast actin to function with GTP. Etheno-ATP exchange studies showed that the binding of GTP to yeast actin is about 1/9 as tight as that of ATP in contrast to the 1/1,240 ratio for muscle actin. Proteolysis of GTP-bound G-yeast actin suggests that the conformation of subdomain 2 is very much like that of ATP-bound actin, but CD studies show that GTP-bound actin is less thermostable than ATP-bound actin. GTP-actin polymerizes with an apparent critical concentration of 1.5 μm, higher than that of ATP-actin (0.3 μm) although filament structures observed by electron microscopy were similar. Yeast actin hydrolyzes GTP in a polymerization-dependent manner, and GTP-bound F-actin decorates with the myosin S1. Conversion of Phe306 in the nucleotide binding site to the Tyr found in muscle actin raised the nucleotide discrimination ratio from the 1/9 of wild-type actin to 1/125. This result agrees with modeling that predicts that removal of the Tyr hydroxyl will create a space for the C2 amino group of the GTP guanine.

This result agrees with modeling that predicts that removal of the Tyr hydroxyl will create a space for the C2 amino group of the GTP guanine. Two cytoskeletal filament systems in the cell, actin microfilaments and tubulin-containing microtubules, depend on the ability to bind and hydrolyze nucleoside triphosphates for proper function. For microtubules, the nucleotide is GTP, and for the actin filaments, the nucleotide is assumed to be ATP (1Carlier M.F. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 12-17Google Scholar). ATP F-actin is more stable than ADP F-actin, and the instability brought about by hydrolysis of the nucleotide is believed to be an important factor in the regulation of the dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton (2Carlier M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1-4Google Scholar). The ATP requirement for actin is based on two criteria: the isolation of actin from a number of sources with a bound ATP, and the demonstration that there is a 500-fold higher affinity of muscle actin for ATP than for GTP (3Iyengar M. Weber H.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1964; 86: 543-553Google Scholar). This difference in nucleotide affinity was also observed in polymerization experiments. Martonosi and Gouvea (4Martonosi A. Gouvea M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 1345-1352Google Scholar) first reported that actin, in the presence of 0.1 m KCl, would not polymerize in the presence of a stoichiometric amount of GTP. Iyengar and Weber (3Iyengar M. Weber H.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1964; 86: 543-553Google Scholar) also generated muscle G-actin free of nucleoside triphosphates and examined the ability of different nucleotides to affect polymerization when added back to the preparation in the presence of salt. Their results showed that whereas 20 μm G-actin would completely polymerize in the presence of a stoichiometric amount of ATP, 100 μm GTP was required to polymerize the actin. Apparently, the free GTP needed to be well above the nm-μm range required for ATP to saturate the high affinity nucleotide binding site of the actin. We have previously used yeast actin as a model system for examining actin structure-function relationships in vitro, and our results have demonstrated significant quantitative differences in the behavior of yeast versus muscle actin. Yeast actin is more susceptible to controlled proteolysis and exchanges nucleotide faster (5Chen X. Peng J. Pedram M. Swenson C.A. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11415-11423Google Scholar). Kim et al. (6Kim E. Miller C.J. Reisler E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16566-16572Google Scholar) showed that beginning with G-actin, the yeast protein reaches steady state polymer levels more rapidly than muscle actin. In another study, kinetic modeling demonstrated this acceleration was because of faster nucleation and filament fragmentation during polymerization leading to more ends for filament extension (7Buzan J.M. Frieden C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 91-95Google Scholar). These results suggest that yeast actin might assume a more open and flexible conformation than muscle actin, a hypothesis that is consistent with additional results from ours and other laboratories. Based on results from optical reconstruction of electron micrographs of yeast actin filaments, Belmont et al. (8Belmont L.D. Orlova A. Drubin D.G. Egelman E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 29-34Google Scholar) suggested that the area in the nucleotide cleft was more open in a yeast than in a muscle actin filament. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that His73 of yeast actin, unlike that of higher actins, is not methylated (9Yao X. Grade S. Wriggers W. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37443-37449Google Scholar) and that this lack of a methyl group may allow the residues at the bottom of the nucleotide cleft to more readily assume a conformation that favors the open conformation (10Chik J.K. Lindberg U. Schutt C.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 607-623Google Scholar) than is the case for other actins. If true, there might be a decrease in nucleotide specificity of yeast in comparison with other actins. Interestingly, Nyman et al. (11Nyman T. Schuler H. Korenbaum E. Schutt C.E. Karlsson R. Lindberg U. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 577-589Google Scholar) have also shown with chicken β-nonmuscle actin produced in yeast (non-methylated) or isolated from tissue (methylated) that lack of methylation of this residue results in an uncoupling of ATP hydrolysis from filament formation. Actin is a member of a superfamily of proteins consisting of hsc70,Escherichia coli DnaK protein, and sugar kinases, such as hexokinase (12Hurley J.H. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1996; 25: 137-162Google Scholar). All share a similar three-dimensional structure around a nucleotide binding core, and all cleave the β-γ bond of ATP resulting in a significant conformational change in the protein. However, in a number of cases, the nucleotide specificity is rather low in comparison to actin. For example, DnaK hydrolyzes GTP with about one-half to one-fourth of the activity it has with ATP (13Liberek K. Skowyra D. Zylicz M. Johnson C. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14491-14496Google Scholar), and hexokinase from rainbow trout is only about twice as active with ATP as with GTP (14Nagayama F. Ohshima H. Suzuki H. Ohshima T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 615: 85-93Google Scholar). Finally, it has recently been reported that MreB, thought to be a bacterial version of actin, will also polymerize in the presence of both ATP and GTP although relative efficiencies with each of these nucleotides was not determined (15van den Ent F. Amos L.A. Lowe J. Nature. 2001; 413: 39-44Google Scholar). We have recently investigated the interaction of Neisseria porins with yeast actin. These porins are nucleotide-gated channels that use either ATP or GTP (16Smith N.H. Maynard Smith J. Spratt B.G. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1995; 12: 363-370Google Scholar), and we wanted to determine the effect of nucleotide on the interaction. As a control, we examined the effect of GTP on yeast actin alone because of the characteristics of yeast actin and the propensity of some actin superfamily members for GTP. The work reported here shows that yeast actin, as opposed to muscle actin, will work with GTP with relatively high efficiency. Affi-Gel 10-activated resin and Bio-Spin® 30 Tris columns were purchased from Bio-Rad. DNase I (grade D) was purchased from Worthington Biochemicals. DNase I affinity columns were made as described previously (17Cook R.K. Blake W.T. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9430-9436Google Scholar). ATP and GTP, purchased from Sigma, were dissolved in water to a final concentration of 50 mm. The pH was adjusted to 7.5 with NaOH prior to storing at −20 °C. The EnzChekTM phosphate assay kit and 1,N 6-ethenoadenosine 5′-triphosphate (εATP) 1The abbreviations used are: εATP, 1,N 6-ethenoadenosine 5′- triphosphate. as a 5 mm stock solution in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR) and stored at −20 °C. The QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit was purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA), and the DNA primers used for site-directed mutagenesis were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Yeast cakes for preparation of wild-type actin were obtained from a local food store. The rabbit muscle acetone powder and the bovine cardiac myosin S1 head preparation were generous gifts from Dr. E. Reisler and Dr. L. Tobacman, respectively. All other chemicals used were reagent grade quality. Yeast wild-type actin was purified in the Ca form by a DNase I affinity chromatography/DEAE ion exchange chromatography protocol as described previously (17Cook R.K. Blake W.T. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9430-9436Google Scholar), and it was stored in Ca G buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 mmATP, 0.2 mm CaCl2, and 0.1 mmdithiothreitol) at 4 °C and used within 3 days. Rabbit skeletal muscle F-actin was prepared from acetone powder according to Spudich and Watt (18Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Google Scholar). The Ca form of actin was converted to the Mg form by adding EGTA to a final concentration equal to the calcium concentration and MgCl2 to a final concentration of 0.2 mm. The actin was then placed on ice for at least 10 min and used within hours. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we replaced the codon for Phe306in yeast actin with a Tyr codon. The actin coding sequence was contained in the centromeric plasmid pRS314 adjacent to the ACT1 promoter (19Chen X. Cook R.K. Rubenstein P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1185-1195Google Scholar). The set of DNA primers, 5′-GGTACCACCATGTACCCAGGTATTGCC-3′ and 5′-GGCAATACCTGGGTACATGGTGGTACC, was used in which the codon for Phe306 (TTC) was changed to Tyr (TAC). A haploid yeast strain expressing the mutant actin as the only actin in the cell was generated as described previously using a plasmid shuffling procedure (19Chen X. Cook R.K. Rubenstein P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1185-1195Google Scholar). The mutant plasmid was rescued from the cell and sequenced to ensure that the mutation was intact. The free nucleotide was depleted from G-actin by passing Ca-actin through a Bio-Spin® 30 Tris column pre-equilibrated with Ca G buffer without nucleotide. Only 1/50 to 1/100 of the free nucleotide from the sample remains in the flow-through based on results with protein-free samples (data not shown). εATP-bound Ca-actin was prepared by incubating 500 μm εATP with 20 μm ATP-bound Ca-actin in the absence of free ATP for at least 1 h on ice (overnight at 4 °C for the muscle actin). GTP-bound Ca-actin was prepared by adding 500 μm GTP to 20 μm Ca εATP-bound actin from which unbound nucleotide had been removed as above and monitoring the decrease in fluorescence until it had reached background levels. Interestingly, the t12 values that characterized the decrease in εATP fluorescence were different for ATP (35–40 s) and GTP (11–15 s), perhaps reflecting differences in on rates for the two nucleotides. The GTP-actin was then depleted of unbound nucleotide as above, and 200 μm fresh GTP was added to the sample to yield the final GTP-actin preparation. The εATP-bound actin and GTP-bound actin were used within 4 h. Fluorescence measurements were obtained using a Fluorolog-3 (Jobin Yvon Inc.) fluorescence spectrometer with a thermostatted water bath attached to the cuvette chamber. Actin polymerization was monitored by a change in light scattering with excitation and emission wavelengths set at 360 nm. The εATP fluorescence intensity change was monitored with excitation and emission wavelengths of 340 and 410 nm, respectively. Aliquots of 2.3 or 4.6 μm Ca εATP-bound actin in the absence of free nucleotide were added to various concentrations of ATP or GTP at 25 °C. Alternatively, ATP or GTP in small aliquots from a 50 mm stock solution were added progressively with constant stirring at 25 °C to 2.3 or 4.6 μm εATP-actin to achieve a final concentration of 700 μm. In both methods, the fluorescence decrease was monitored after the nucleotide was added until the fluorescence signal reached equilibrium. The results obtained from both methods were identical. The observed fluorescence intensity (F obs) obtained by the experiments was the sum of the fluorescence contributed by εATP bound by actin and actin-free εATP, and is shown in Equation 1, Fobs=fɛA[ɛA]+fε[A]Equation 1 where fεA and fε are the specific fluorescence yields derived from experiments for the bound and free εATP forms, respectively. [εA] is the concentration for εATP-bound actin, [ε] is that for free εATP, and the sum of [εA] and [ε] is either 2.3 or 4.6 μm depending on the experiment. The values of [εA] were calculated from Equation 1and were plotted as a function of total concentration of the competing ATP or GTP with the actin concentration constant. The solution to the quadratic expression modified from Ref. 20Klumb L.A. Chu V. Stayton P.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7657-7663Google Scholar was applied to the data with the dissociation constant ratio (KP) as a fitting parameter using Microsoft Excel (Microsoft) and is shown in Equation 2, [εA]=−(KP(NT−ET)+AT+ET)±((KP(NT−ET)+AT+ET)2+4(KP−1)ATET)2(KP−1)Equation 2 where KP is equal to Kε/K N, KNis the equilibrium dissociation constant for nucleotide (either ATP or GTP) binding to actin, K ε is the equilibrium dissociation constant for εATP, [εA] is the concentration of εATP-bound actin, AT is the concentration of the total εATP, NT is the concentration of the total ATP/GTP, and ET is the concentration of the total concentration of actin. The apparent melting temperature of G-actin was determined by circular dichroism according to Yao et al. (9Yao X. Grade S. Wriggers W. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37443-37449Google Scholar). 1 μm G-actin in G buffer was heated at a constant rate of 1 °C/min from 20 to 80 °C with constant stirring. Changes in the actin ellipticity were monitored at 222 nm using an AVIV 62 DS spectropolarimeter. Data were normalized as the fraction of native protein based on the net change in ellipticity then fitted to a two-state model with a single transition between a native and a denatured form of the protein. The Tmvalue was defined as the temperature at which 50% G-actin was denatured. The digestion protocol was essentially the same as described by Kuang and Rubenstein (21Kuang B. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4412-4418Google Scholar) with modification. Briefly, 9.2 μm G-actin was incubated with trypsin (5 μg/ml), subtilisin (1 μg/ml), or α-chymotrypsin (22.5 μg/ml) at room temperature for the desired time. All the digestion reactions were stopped by adding SDS-sample loading buffer and then heating at 95 °C for 3 min. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on a 12.5% polyacrylamide gel, and the bands were visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue. Actin polymerization was triggered by the addition of MgCl2 and KCl to final concentrations of 2 and 50 mm, respectively and was monitored by the increase in light scattering as a function of time at 25 °C. The extent of polymerization of GTP-actin was normalized against the extent of polymerization of an equivalent concentration of ATP-actin for comparison. To measure the critical concentration of ATP/GTP-bound actin, increasing concentrations of actin were induced to polymerize until the steady state was reached, and the net change in light scattering in each experiment was recorded. The net changes were plotted against the concentration of actin, and the critical concentration of actin was obtained by drawing a line through the points and determining its intersection on the x axis. To assess the ability of the actin filament to withstand cold temperature, 9.2 μm actin was polymerized at 25 °C until the steady state was reached. The temperature of the sample was then lowered from 25 to 5 °C using a digitally controlled thermostatted waterbath connected to the cuvette chamber. The inorganic phosphate released from F-actin during polymerization was measured in a coupled assay using the EnzChekTM assay developed by Webb (22Webb M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4884-4887Google Scholar). The assay is based on a Pi-dependent enzymatic conversion of 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine riboside to 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine and ribose 1-phospate by a purine nucleoside phosphorylase. The production of 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine in the reaction results in an increased absorbance at 360 nm. Each reaction contained actin at the desired concentration, 0.5 unit/ml of purine nucleoside phosphorylase, and 200 μm 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine riboside. Pi released from actin in F buffer (5 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 50 mmKCl, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm nucleotide triphosphate) upon actin polymerization was monitored continuously by the change in absorbance at 360 nm. A standard curve allowed conversion of the absorbance change to Pi concentration. To decorate actin filaments with myosin S1, GTP-bound actin (9.2 μm) was polymerized in G buffer with 100 μm GTP at 25 °C for 30 min and then mixed with 4.6 μm myosin S1 for another 30 min. To prepare the samples for electron microscopy, 4.6 μm F-actin or myosin-decorated actin filaments were diluted 4-fold with F-buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm GTP, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol) and were applied to carbon-coated Formvar grids and visualized following negative staining with 1.5% (w/v) uranyl acetate using a Hitachi 7000 electron microscope (University of Iowa Electron Microscope Facility). To determine the capacity of yeast actin to bind GTP, we measured the dissociation constant ratio of ATP and GTP versus εATP for the nucleotide tight binding site in yeast actin by adding free ATP or GTP to εATP-bound Ca-actin in nucleotide-free G buffer. Parallel ATP and GTP titrations were performed on the same preparation of εATP-actin to eliminate inconsistencies arising from differences between actin preparations. Fig. 1, A and Bdemonstrates the relative ability of GTP or ATP to compete with εATP for binding to Ca yeast actin. These data were then fit to Equation 2. The results demonstrate that the dissociation constant ratio of εATPversus ATP,KεATP/KATP, is 2.3 whereas the ratio of εATP versus GTP,KεATP/KGTP, is 0.25. Using these two numbers, we calculate a dissociation constant ratio of GTP versus ATP,KGTP/KATP, of 9.2. This value is ∼50-fold less then than the ratio, 500, previously reported by Iyengar and Weber (3Iyengar M. Weber H.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1964; 86: 543-553Google Scholar) for muscle actin. To ensure that the difference observed between yeast and muscle actins was not simply due to differences in experimental methodologies employed in the two studies, we repeated the identical experiments with Ca muscle actin. From the results shown in Fig. 1, C andD, we calculated the ratios for Ca muscle actin to be 6.2 for KεATP/KATP and 0.005 for KεATP/KGTP. Thus, the dissociation constant ratio of GTP versus ATP,KGTP/KATP, is 1.24 × 103 for our Ca muscle actin experiments. This number is within about a factor of 2 of what was reported previously (3Iyengar M. Weber H.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1964; 86: 543-553Google Scholar), indicating that yeast actin is not as highly selective as muscle actin in its ability to interact with GTP at the tight binding pocket. The 6.2-fold stronger affinity of muscle actin for ATP compared with εATP reported here is slightly higher than the 4-fold difference reported by others (23Kinosian H.J. Selden L.A. Gershman L.C. Estes J.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13176-13188Google Scholar, 24Vinson V.K., De La Cruz E.M. Higgs H.N. Pollard T.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10871-10880Google Scholar), and the small difference in results may reflect different methods used in the different studies. When Mg2+ is bound in the high affinity divalent cation binding site of actin, it changes the flexibility of the actin molecule (25Orlova A. Egelman E.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 334-341Google Scholar). We, thus, examined the dissociation constant ratio of GTPversus ATP for yeast Mg-actin. Fig.2 shows thatKεATP/KATP is 9.44, andKεATP/KGTP is 0.8 for Mg yeast actin, demonstrating an ∼11-fold stronger interaction for Mg yeast actin with ATP than GTP. The slight difference in the values ofKGTP/KATP for Ca-actin, 9.2, and Mg actin, 11, indicates that the divalent cation bound in the cation tight binding site does not significantly alter the ability of actin to interact with GTP. Limited proteolysis has been used widely to probe the conformation of actin subdomain 2. Strzelecka-Golaszewskaet al. (26Strzelecka-Golaszewska H. Moraczewska J. Khaitlina S.Y. Mossakowska M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 731-742Google Scholar) showed that ADP-bound muscle actin is more susceptible to trypsin digestion and less susceptible to subtilisin digestion than ATP-bound muscle actin, indicating distinct conformations of subdomain 2 when muscle actin is bound to ATP or ADP. We thus used limited proteolysis to assess the effect of GTP binding on the structure of subdomain 2. We subjected G-actin to limited proteolysis with trypsin, subtilisin, or α-chymotrypsin, which specifically cleave G-actin at Arg62-Gly63/Lys68-Tyr69, Met47-Gly48, and Met44-Val45/Leu67-Lys68, respectively. SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 3) shows no significant difference in the digestion pattern between the GTP-bound and ATP-bound yeast Ca-actins suggesting that the exposure of the subdomain 2 sites is not significantly different for the two actins. Actin crystallographic data (10Chik J.K. Lindberg U. Schutt C.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 607-623Google Scholar, 27Flaherty K.M. McKay D.B. Kabsch W. Holmes K.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5041-5045Google Scholar, 28Cedergren-Zeppezauer E.S. Goonesekere N.C. Rozycki M.D. Myslik J.C. Dauter Z. Lindberg U. Schutt C.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 240: 459-475Google Scholar) all show that the nucleotide locates at the interface of actin's two major domains near the base of the interdomain cleft; the polyphosphate part of the molecule interacts with both domains, and the base portion interacts with subdomains 3 and 4. Thus, the bound nucleotide functions as a connecting bridge between the two domains. The amino acids rearrange when they interact with either the tri- or diphosphate and cause a subdomain 2 conformational change reported by Strzelecka-Golaszewska et al. (26Strzelecka-Golaszewska H. Moraczewska J. Khaitlina S.Y. Mossakowska M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 731-742Google Scholar). Therefore, our results imply that the triphosphate of GTP locates at or near the same position as the triphosphate of ATP. A structural change in yeast actin subdomains 3 and 4 needed to accommodate GTP might not be detected by limited proteolysis. Thus, we examined the thermal stability of GTP-bound Ca yeast actin by circular dichroism. The molar ellipticity at 222 nm, which reflects the content of α-helical structure in G-actin, was monitored as a function of temperature. The thermal stability of a protein is determined by the apparent melting temperature (Tm), which is defined as the midpoint of the thermal transition curve. Although the transition is not reversible for actin, a comparison of the curves generated by two different actins gives a relative indication of their thermal stabilities. This approach was first used for actin by Strzelecka-Golaszewska et al. (29Strzelecka-Golaszewska H. Venyaminov S. Zmorzynski S. Mossakowska M. Eur. J.

Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 291-298Google Scholar) for muscle actin and validated for yeast actin by us previously (19Chen X. Cook R.K. Rubenstein P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1185-1195Google Scholar). The results in Fig. 4show that the Tm is 49.5 °C for GTP-bound Ca yeast G-actin, whereas the Tm is 59 °C for ATP-bound G-actin. This substantial decrease in the “melting temperature” of the actin in the presence of GTP may result either from a weaker binding of GTP versus ATP to actin giving rise to a less stable actin conformation at higher temperature or from a GTP-induced conformational change in the protein itself. To determine the effect of the replacement of ATP with GTP on actin polymerization, we examined the polymerizability of GTP-bound yeast Ca-actin at different GTP concentrations at 25 °C. The starting material was a solution of a 1:1 complex of actin and GTP from which unbound nucleotide had been removed. Fig. 5 shows that GTP-bound yeast Ca-actin, contrary to the case for muscle actin, polymerizes in the absence of exogenous nucleotide. Samples at the end of each polymerization assay were observed by electron microscopy, and the structure of GTP-bound yeast Ca-actin filaments appears similar to ATP-bound yeast Ca-actin filaments (Fig.6).Figure 6Electron micrographs of GTP and ATP yeast Ca F-actin. At the conclusion of the experiments in Fig. 5, actin was removed, stained with uranyl acetate, and viewed under the electron microscope as described under “Experimental Procedures.”Panel A, ATP-actin; panel B, GTP-actin.Bar = 50 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The purine binding region of actin lies near the intersection of subdomains 3 and 4. Because thermal denaturation results suggested that the binding of GTP altered the conformation of actin, it is possible that the integrity of the 3/4 boundary was affected. Previous results from our laboratory demonstrated that mutations in this region might produce a cold-sensitive polymerization defect (19Chen X. Cook R.K. Rubenstein P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1185-1195Google Scholar, 21Kuang B. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4412-4418Google Scholar). To determine whether the binding of GTP to actin produced such an effect, we polymerized 9.2 μm GTP-bound yeast Ca-actin at 25 °C until a steady state was reached. We then lowered the temperature to 5 °C and monitored light scattering as a function of temperature. We observed no cold sensitivity of the preformed filaments (data not shown). At a concentration of 4.6 μm, the extent of polymerization of GTP-bound actin is ∼35% less than that of ATP-bound actin as shown in Fig. 5suggesting a significant difference in the critical concentration of the GTP- and ATP-actin forms. We thus determined the critical concentrations of the two actin preparations by measuring the increase in light scattering when solutions of different actin concentrations were allowed to polymerize and graphing the magnitude of these changes against the actin concentration. Fig. 7shows that although the critical concentration of ATP-actin is 0.3 μm, that of the GTP-actin is 1.5 μm. To determine whether the GTP- and ATP-actin conformations were interconvertible, we added ATP to a sample of GTP F-actin. Fig.8 demonstrates that the extent of polymerization increased to that of a parallel sample of ATP F-actin showing the GTP did not cause irreversible changes in actin conformation.Figure 8Stimulation of additional actin polymerization by the addition of ATP to Ca GTP F-actin. Both 4.6 μm Ca ATP- (○) and GTP- (▵) Ca yeast actin in the presence of 10 μm of their respective nucleotide were polymerized until the steady state was approached. At 1600 s, equivalent amounts of 100 μm ATP was then added to each sample, and the resulting change in light scattering followed. Both samples reached the same final light scattering value. The sharp deflection in the middle of the plot is because of the opening and closing of the sample changer.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) ATP hydrolysis and Pi release have been proposed to be important determinants of the rate of actin filament turnover (2Carlier M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1-4Google Scholar). The slow polymerization rate and the higher critical concentration of GTP-bound actin described previously suggest that polymerization-induced hydrolysis of bound nucleotide might be affected. Therefore, we assessed the ability of actin to hydrolyze bound GTP. Yao and Rubenstein (31Yao X. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25598-25604Google Scholar) reported that ATPase activity and Pi release are concurrent during yeast actin polymerization; there is no appreciable retention of Pi following nucleo"
