https://openalex.org/W3157070895,"The COVID-19 pandemic has affected cities particularly hard. Here, we provide an in-depth characterization of disease incidence and mortality and their dependence on demographic and socioeconomic strata in Santiago, a highly segregated city and the capital of Chile. Our analyses show a strong association between socioeconomic status and both COVID-19 outcomes and public health capacity. People living in municipalities with low socioeconomic status did not reduce their mobility during lockdowns as much as those in more affluent municipalities. Testing volumes may have been insufficient early in the pandemic in those places, and both test positivity rates and testing delays were much higher. We find a strong association between socioeconomic status and mortality, measured by either COVID-19-attributed deaths or excess deaths. Finally, we show that infection fatality rates in young people are higher in low-income municipalities. Together, these results highlight the critical consequences of socioeconomic inequalities on health outcomes."

As a vaccination effort, the study provided an empirical evidence on willingness to vaccinate by sociodemographic, clinical and regional differences in Bangladeshi adults. Methods This cross-sectional analysis from a household survey of 3646 adults aged 18 years or older was conducted in 8 districts of Bangladesh, from December 12, 2020, to January 7, 2021. Multinomial regression examined the impact of socio-demographic, clinical and healthcare-releated factors on hesitancy and reluctance of vaccination for COVID-19. Results Of the 3646 respondents (2212 men [60.7%]; mean [sd] age, 37.4 [13.9] years), 74.6% reported their willingness to vaccinate against COVID-19 when a safe and effective vaccine is available without a fee, while 8.5% were reluctant to vaccinate. With a minimum fee, 46.5% of the respondents showed intent to vaccinate. Among the respondents, 16.8% reported adequate adherence to health safety regulations, and 35.5% reported high confidence in the country’s healthcare system. The COVID-19 vaccine refusal was significantly high in elderly, rural, semi-urban, and slum communities, farmers, day-laborers, homemakers, low-educated group, and those who had low confidence in the country’s healthcare system. Also, the prevalence of vaccine hesitancy was high in the elderly population, low-educated group, day-laborers, people with chronic diseases, and people with low confidence in the country’s healthcare system. Conclusion A high prevalence of vaccine refusal and hesitancy was observed in rural people and slum dwellers in Bangladesh. The rural community and slum dwellers had a low literacy level, low adherence to health safety regulations and low confidence in healthcare system. The ongoing app-based registration for vaccination increased hesitancy and reluctancy in low-educated group. For rural, semi-urban, and slum people, outreach centers for vaccination can be established to ensure the vaccine’s nearby availability and limit associated travel costs. In rural areas, community health workers, valued community-leaders, and non-governmental organizations can be utilized to motivate and educate people for vaccination against COVID-19. Further, emphasis should be given to the elderly and diseased people with tailored health messages and assurance from healthcare professionals. The media may play a responsible role with the vaccine education program and eliminate the social stigma about the vaccination. Finally, vaccination should be continued without a fee and thus Bangladesh’s COVID vaccination program can become a model for other low and middle-income countries."
https://openalex.org/W3157913201,"Cellular RNAs guide CRISPR-Cas9 The Cas9 nuclease widely used for genome editing is derived from natural bacterial defense systems that protect against invading viruses. Cas9 is directed by RNA guides to cut matching viral DNA. Jiao et al. discovered that RNA guides can also originate from cellular RNAs unassociated with viral defense (see the Perspective by Abudayyeh and Gootenberg). They rendered this process programmable, linking the presence of virtually any RNA to cutting of matching DNA by Cas9. This capability is the basis of a new CRISPR diagnostic method developed by the authors that can detect many biomarkers at once. Named LEOPARD, this method can detect, for example, RNAs from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and other viruses, thereby translating a new CRISPR discovery into a powerful diagnostic tool.

https://openalex.org/W3159236101,"Urban tree cover provides benefits to human health and well-being, but previous studies suggest that tree cover is often inequitably distributed. Here, we use National Agriculture Imagery Program digital ortho photographs to survey the tree cover inequality for Census blocks in US large urbanized areas, home to 167 million people across 5,723 municipalities and other Census-designated places. We compared tree cover to summer land surface temperature, as measured using Landsat imagery. In 92% of the urbanized areas surveyed, low-income blocks have less tree cover than high-income blocks. On average, low-income blocks have 15.2% less tree cover and are 1.5⁰C hotter than high-income blocks. The greatest difference between low- and high-income blocks was found in urbanized areas in the Northeast of the United States, where low-income blocks in some urbanized areas have 30% less tree cover and are 4.0⁰C hotter. Even after controlling for population density and built-up intensity, the positive association between income and tree cover is significant, as is the positive association between proportion non-Hispanic white and tree cover. We estimate, after controlling for population density, that low-income blocks have 62 million fewer trees than high-income blocks, equal to a compensatory value of $56 billion ($1,349/person). An investment in tree planting and natural regeneration of $17.6 billion would be needed to close the tree cover disparity, benefitting 42 million people in low-income blocks."

https://openalex.org/W3157193673,"Granulosa cells (GCs) are regulated by various factors during ovarian development. However, there are few reports on the role of follicular fluid exosomes in ovarian GCs. In this study, porcine ovarian GCs were used to explore the effects of follicular fluid exosomes on GCs. GCs were treated with in vitro, and the changes in cell proliferation, steroid synthesis, and associated signal pathways were detected. The results showed that exosomes increased cell viability and altered the gene expression profile of GCs. Exosomes also increased the level of gene expression associated with both proliferation and progesterone synthesis, in which the MAPK/ERK and WNT/B-CATENIN pathways were involved. In addition, exosome-carried microRNAs were identified by high-throughput sequencing, and exosomal miR-31-5p was found to promote the proliferation of GCs and progesterone synthesis via the WNT/B-CATENIN pathway by targeting the SFRP4 follicle growth inhibitor. In conclusion, this study has demonstrated that exosomes are essential substances involved in regulating the physiological function of GCs."
https://openalex.org/W3157359648,"Recognition of early signs of deterioration in postoperative course could be improved by continuous monitoring of vital parameters. Wearable sensors could enable this by wireless transmission of vital signs. A novel accelerometer-based device, called Healthdot, has been designed to be worn on the skin to measure the two key vital parameters respiration rate (RespR) and heart rate (HeartR). The goal of this study is to assess the reliability of heart rate and respiration rate measured by the Healthdot in comparison to the gold standard, the bedside patient monitor, during the postoperative period in bariatric patients. Data were collected in a consecutive group of 30 patients who agreed to wear the device after their primary bariatric procedure. Directly after surgery, a Healthdot was attached on the patients’ left lower rib. Vital signs measured by the accelerometer based Healthdot were compared to vital signs collected with the gold standard patient monitor for the period that the patient stayed at the post-anesthesia care unit. Over all patients, a total of 22 hours of vital signs obtained by the Healthdot were recorded simultaneously with the bedside patient monitor data. 87.5% of the data met the pre-defined bias of 5 beats per minute for HeartR and 92.3% of the data met the pre-defined bias of 5 respirations per minute for RespR. The Healthdot can be used to accurately derive heart rate and respiration rate in postbariatric patients. Wireless continuous monitoring of key vital signs has the potential to contribute to earlier recognition of complications in postoperative patients. Future studies should focus on the ability to detect patient deterioration in low-care environments and at home after discharge from the hospital."
https://openalex.org/W3159278371,"Protein misfolding is a central feature of most neurodegenerative diseases. Molecular chaperones can modulate the toxicity associated with protein misfolding, but it remains elusive which molecular chaperones and co-chaperones interact with specific misfolded proteins. TDP-43 misfolding and inclusion formation are a hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and other neurodegenerative diseases. Using yeast and mammalian neuronal cells we find that Hsp90 and its co-chaperone Sti1 have the capacity to alter TDP-43 misfolding, inclusion formation, aggregation, and cellular toxicity. Our data also demonstrate that impaired Hsp90 function sensitizes cells to TDP-43 toxicity and that Sti1 specifically interacts with and strongly modulates TDP-43 toxicity in a dose-dependent manner. Our study thus uncovers a previously unrecognized tie between Hsp90, Sti1, TDP-43 misfolding, and cellular toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W3158731750,"Introduction Anemia during pregnancy is a public health problem that leads to different life-threatening complications and poor pregnancy outcomes. So far, the evidence is scarce on pooled prevalence and determinants of anemia during pregnancy in East Africa for integrated intervention. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the prevalence and determinants of anemia among pregnant women in eastern Africa using recent Demographic and Health Surveys. Method Secondary data analysis was conducted using data from recent Demographic and Health Survey datasets from 10 East African countries. A total of 8583 (weighted sample) pregnant women were included in the analysis. The multi-level mixed-effects generalized linear model (Poisson regression with robust error variance) was fitted to identify determinants of anemia. Finally, the adjusted prevalence ratio (aPR) with 95% CI and random effects for the multilevel generalized linear mixed-effects model was reported. Results In this study, the overall prevalence of anemia among pregnant women was 41.82% (95% CI: 40.78, 42.87) with a large difference between specific countries which ranged from 23.36% in Rwanda to 57.10% in Tanzania. In the multi-level analysis, teenage pregnant women (aPR = 1.22;95%CI:1.02, 1.40), unmarried women (aPR = 1.14; 95% CI;1.02,1.28), pregnant women who had unimproved toilet facility (aPR = 1.17;95%CI:1.06,1.27), and those women from countries with high illiteracy level (aPR = 1.12;95%CI; 1.07,1.18) had a higher prevalence of anemia during pregnancy. Conclusion Anemia is still a public health problem in East Africa. Therefore, enabling the households to have improved toilet facilities by strengthening the existing health extension program, reducing teenage pregnancy, and improving the community literacy level is vital to reduce the prevalence of anemia during pregnancy in East Africa."
https://openalex.org/W3159276301,"This study compared the performance of four serology assays for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and investigated whether COVID-19 disease history correlates with assay performance. Samples were tested at Northshore using the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (Roche Diagnostics), Access SARS-CoV-2 IgG anti-RBD (Beckman Coulter), and LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG (DiaSorin) as well as at Genalyte using Maverick Multi-Antigen Serology Panel. The study included one hundred clinical samples collected before December 2019 and ninety-seven samples collected from convalescent plasma donors originally diagnosed with COVID-19 by PCR. COVID-19 disease history was self-reported by the plasma donors. There was no difference in specificity between the assays tested. Clinical sensitivity of these four tests was 98% (Genalyte), 96% (Roche), 92% (DiaSorin), and 87% (Beckman). The only statistically significant differences in clinical sensitivity was between the Beckman assay and both Genalyte and Roche assays. Convalescent plasma donor characteristics and disease symptoms did not correlate with false negative results from the Beckman and DiaSorin assays. All four tests showed high specificity (100%) and varying sensitivities (89–98%). No correlations between disease history and serology results were observed. The Genalyte Multiplex assay showed as good or better sensitivity to three other previously validated assays with FDA Emergency Use Authorizations."

PiPS-A (clinical observations only) and PiPS-B (additionally requiring blood results) consist of 14- and 56-day models (PiPS-A14; PiPS-A56; PiPS-B14; PiPS-B56) to create survival risk categories: days, weeks, months. The primary aim was to compare PIPS-B risk categories against agreed multi-professional estimates of survival (AMPES) and to validate PiPS-A and PiPS-B. Secondary aims were to assess acceptability of PiPS to patients, caregivers and health professionals (HPs).A national, multi-centre, prospective, observational, cohort study with nested qualitative sub-study using interviews with patients, caregivers and HPs. Validation study participants were adults with incurable cancer; with or without capacity; recently referred to community, hospital and hospice palliative care services across England and Wales. Sub-study participants were patients, caregivers and HPs. 1833 participants were recruited. PiPS-B risk categories were as accurate as AMPES [PiPS-B accuracy (910/1484; 61%); AMPES (914/1484; 61%); p = 0.851]. PiPS-B14 discrimination (C-statistic 0.837) and PiPS-B56 (0.810) were excellent. PiPS-B14 predictions were too high in the 57-74% risk group (Calibration-in-the-large [CiL] -0.202; Calibration slope [CS] 0.840). PiPS-B56 was well-calibrated (CiL 0.152; CS 0.914). PiPS-A risk categories were less accurate than AMPES (p<0.001). PiPS-A14 (C-statistic 0.825; CiL -0.037; CS 0.981) and PiPS-A56 (C-statistic 0.776; CiL 0.109; CS 0.946) had excellent or reasonably good discrimination and calibration. Interviewed patients (n = 29) and caregivers (n = 20) wanted prognostic information and considered that PiPS may aid communication. HPs (n = 32) found PiPS user-friendly and considered risk categories potentially helpful for decision-making. The need for a blood test for PiPS-B was considered a limitation.PiPS-B risk categories are as accurate as AMPES made by experienced doctors and nurses. PiPS-A categories are less accurate. Patients, carers and HPs regard PiPS as potentially helpful in clinical practice.ISRCTN13688211."
https://openalex.org/W3157226414,"Alexander disease (AxD) caused by mutations in the coding region of GFAP is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by astrocyte dysfunction, GFAP aggregation, and Rosenthal fiber accumulation. Although how GFAP mutations cause disease is not fully understood, Rosenthal fibers could be induced by forced overexpression of human GFAP and this could be lethal in mice implicate that an increase in GFAP levels is central to AxD pathogenesis. Our recent studies demonstrated that intronic GFAP mutations cause disease by altering GFAP splicing, suggesting that an increase in GFAP isoform expression could lead to protein aggregation and astrocyte dysfunction that typify AxD. Here we test this hypothesis by establishing primary astrocyte cultures from transgenic mice overexpressing human GFAP. We found that GFAP-δ and GFAP-κ were disproportionately increased in transgenic astrocytes and both were enriched in Rosenthal fibers of human AxD brains. In vitro assembly studies showed that while the major isoform GFAP-α self-assembled into typical 10-nm filaments, minor isoforms including GFAP-δ, -κ, and -λ were assembly-compromised and aggregation prone. Lentiviral transduction showed that expression of these minor GFAP isoforms decreased filament solubility and increased GFAP stability, leading to the formation of Rosenthal fibers-like aggregates that also disrupted the endogenous intermediate filament networks. The aggregate-bearing astrocytes lost their normal morphology and glutamate buffering capacity, which had a toxic effect on neighboring neurons. In conclusion, our findings provide evidence that links elevated GFAP isoform expression with GFAP aggregation and impaired glutamate transport, and suggest a potential non-cell-autonomous mechanism underlying neurodegeneration through astrocyte dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W3157484778,"Species of Brachycephalus has been having taxonomical issues due its morphological similarity and genetic conservatism. Herein, we describe a new species of Brachycephalus from the south Mantiqueira mountain range and semidecidual forests in the municipalities of Mogi das Cruzes, Campinas and Jundiaí, state of São Paulo, Brazil, based on an integrative approach. It can be distinguished from all species of the B. ephippium species group based on morphological characters (especially osteology and head shape), advertisement call and divergence in partial mitochondrial DNA gene sequences (16S). The new species is genetically similar to B. margaritatus and morphologically similar to B. ephippium. It can be differentiated from B. ephippium by the presence of dark faded spots on skull and post-cranial plates, presence of black connective tissue connective tissue scattered over dorsal musculature, parotic plate morphology, smaller snout-vent length (adult SVL: males 13.46-15.92 mm; females 16.04-17.69 mm) and 3% genetic distance. We also present natural history data and discuss the robustness of the integrative approach, geographic distribution, genetic data, behaviour, fluorescence in ontogeny, and conservation status."
https://openalex.org/W3159960813,"Quantitative gene expression analysis is an important tool in the scientist’s belt. The identification of evenly expressed reference genes is necessary for accurate quantitative gene expression analysis, whether by traditional RT-PCR (reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction) or by qRT-PCR (quantitative real-time PCR; qPCR). In the Stramenopiles (the major line of eukaryotes that includes brown algae) there is a noted lack of known reference genes for such studies, largely due to the absence of available molecular tools. Here we present a set of nine reference genes ( Elongation Factor 1 alpha (EF1A) , Elongation Factor 2 alpha (EF2A) , Elongation Factor 1 beta (EF1B) , 14-3-3 Protein , Ubiquitin Conjugating Enzyme (UBCE2) , Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate Dehydrogenase (GAPDH) , Actin Related Protein Complex (ARP2/3) , Ribosomal Protein (40s; S23) , and Actin ) for the brown alga Fucus distichus . These reference genes were tested on adult sporophytes across six abiotic stress conditions (desiccation, light and temperature modification, hormone addition, pollutant exposure, nutrient addition, and wounding). Suitability of these genes as reference genes was quantitatively evaluated across conditions using standard methods and the majority of the tested genes were evaluated favorably. However, we show that normalization genes should be chosen on a condition-by-condition basis. We provide a recommendation that at least two reference genes be used per experiment, a list of recommended pairs for the conditions tested here, and a procedure for identifying a suitable set for an experimenter’s unique design. With the recent expansion of interest in brown algal biology and accompanied molecular tools development, the variety of experimental conditions tested here makes this study a valuable resource for future work in basic biology and understanding stress responses in the brown algal lineage."
https://openalex.org/W3157143365,"The impact of the physical workplace on behaviors and attitudes at work is a much-studied topic. Major research streams over the last decades investigated either satisfaction with offices in relation to physical comfort, or how layout decisions influenced interaction and collaboration in the workplace with a focus on open-plan offices. Rather little is known on the effect a workplace layout (such as its openness) has on perceptions of staff regarding teamwork, focused work and perceived productivity. We aim to close this gap by taking a differential approach which appreciates detailed variations within open-plan offices. Not every corner of an office is the same, so the question arises whether satisfaction with workspace differs depending on where someone is sitting. Bringing results of a staff survey in the UK headquarters of a global technology company together with a detailed analysis of spatial qualities at desks based on isovist and visual field analysis, we find that staff are less likely to rate their workplace environment favorably when they have higher numbers of desks within their own field of vision; and when they are facing away from the room with a relatively larger area behind their back compared to the area surrounding them. Aspects of teamwork that are negatively affected include sharing information with others, as well as team identity and cohesion. Focused work (concentration) and working productively are impacted even more so with the largest effect sizes throughout. These findings highlight the relevance of investigating detailed spatial qualities of micro-locations in workplace layouts. Our results also raise important questions regarding the current popular practice in workplace design of providing large open-plan offices for technology companies."
https://openalex.org/W3157546884,"Sensory Substitution Devices (SSDs) convey visual information through audition or touch, targeting blind and visually impaired individuals. One bottleneck towards adopting SSDs in everyday life by blind users, is the constant dependency on sighted instructors throughout the learning process. Here, we present a proof-of-concept for the efficacy of an online self-training program developed for learning the basics of the EyeMusic visual-to-auditory SSD tested on sighted blindfolded participants. Additionally, aiming to identify the best training strategy to be later re-adapted for the blind, we compared multisensory vs. unisensory as well as perceptual vs. descriptive feedback approaches. To these aims, sighted participants performed identical SSD-stimuli identification tests before and after ~75 minutes of self-training on the EyeMusic algorithm. Participants were divided into five groups, differing by the feedback delivered during training: auditory-descriptive, audio-visual textual description, audio-visual perceptual simultaneous and interleaved, and a control group which had no training. At baseline, before any EyeMusic training, participants SSD objects’ identification was significantly above chance, highlighting the algorithm’s intuitiveness. Furthermore, self-training led to a significant improvement in accuracy between pre- and post-training tests in each of the four feedback groups versus control, though no significant difference emerged among those groups. Nonetheless, significant correlations between individual post-training success rates and various learning measures acquired during training, suggest a trend for an advantage of multisensory vs. unisensory feedback strategies, while no trend emerged for perceptual vs. descriptive strategies. The success at baseline strengthens the conclusion that cross-modal correspondences facilitate learning, given SSD algorithms are based on such correspondences. Additionally, and crucially, the results highlight the feasibility of self-training for the first stages of SSD learning, and suggest that for these initial stages, unisensory training, easily implemented also for blind and visually impaired individuals, may suffice. Together, these findings will potentially boost the use of SSDs for rehabilitation."
https://openalex.org/W3157554217,"Ovarian cancer is the fifth most common cause of cancer deaths among American women. Platinum and taxane combination chemotherapy represents the first-line approach for ovarian cancer, but treatment success is often limited by chemoresistance. Therefore, it is necessary to find new drugs to sensitize ovarian cancer cells to chemotherapy. Persistent activation of Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling plays an important role in oncogenesis. Using a novel approach called advanced multiple ligand simultaneous docking (AMLSD), we developed a novel nonpeptide small molecule, LLL12B, which targets the STAT3 pathway. In this study, LLL12B inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation (tyrosine 705) and the expression of its downstream targets, which are associated with cancer cell proliferation and survival. We showed that LLL12B also inhibits cell viability, migration, and proliferation in human ovarian cancer cells. LLL12B combined with either paclitaxel or with cisplatin demonstrated synergistic inhibitory effects relative to monotherapy in inhibiting cell viability and LLL12B-paclitaxel or LLL12B-cisplatin combination exhibited greater inhibitory effects than cisplatin-paclitaxel combination in ovarian cancer cells. Furthermore, LLL12B-paclitaxel or LLL12B-cisplatin combination showed more significant in inhibiting cell migration and growth than monotherapy in ovarian cancer cells. In summary, our results support the novel small molecule LLL12B as a potent STAT3 inhibitor in human ovarian cancer cells and suggest that LLL12B in combination with the current front-line chemotherapeutic drugs cisplatin and paclitaxel may represent a promising approach for ovarian cancer therapy."

The shells were measured using X-ray microcomputed tomography (XMCT) scanning and compared to the physical and chemical properties of the water column including the carbonate chemistry and calcium carbonate saturation of calcite and aragonite. Both living L . helicina and N . pachyderma increased in shell density from the surface to 300 m water depth. Turborotalita quinqueloba increased in shell density to 150–200 m water depth. Deeper than 150 m, T . quinqueloba experienced a loss of density due to internal dissolution, possibly related to gametogenesis. The shell density of recently settled (dead) specimens of planktonic foraminifera from surface sediment samples was compared to the living fauna and showed a large range of dissolution states. This dissolution was not apparent from shell-surface texture, especially for N . pachyderma , which tended to be both thicker and denser than T . quinqueloba . Dissolution lowered the shell density while the thickness of the shell remained intact. Limacina helicina also increase in shell size with water depth and thicken the shell apex with growth. This study demonstrates that the living fauna in this specific area from the Barents Sea did not suffer from dissolution effects. Dissolution occurred after death and after settling on the sea floor. The study also shows that biomonitoring is important for the understanding of the natural variability in shell density of calcifying zooplankton."
https://openalex.org/W3159818962,"Current histological measurement techniques for interstitial collagen, the basis of interstitial fibrosis, are semi-quantitative at best and only provide a ratio of collagen levels within tissues. The Genesis200 imaging system and supplemental image analysis software, FibroIndex from HistoIndex, is a novel, automated platform that uses second-harmonic generation (SHG) for imaging and characterization of interstitial collagen deposition and additional characteristics, in the absence of any staining. However, its ability to quantify renal fibrosis requires investigation. This study compared SHG imaging of renal fibrosis in mice with unilateral ureteric obstruction (UUO), to that of Masson’s trichrome staining (MTS) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) of collagen I. Additionally, the platform generated data on collagen morphology and distribution patterns. While all three methods determined that UUO-injured mice underwent significantly increased renal fibrosis after 7 days, the HistoIndex platform additionally determined that UUO-injured mice had a significantly increased collagen-to-tissue cross reticulation ratio (all P < .001 vs sham group). Furthermore, in UUO-injured mice treated with the relaxin family peptide receptor-1 agonists, relaxin (0.5 mg/kg/day) or B7-33 (0.25 mg/kg/day), or angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitor, perindopril (1 mg/kg/day) over the 7-day period, only the HistoIndex platform determined that the drug-induced prevention of renal fibrosis correlated with significantly reduced collagen fiber thickness and collagen-to-tissue cross reticulation ratio, but increased collagen fiber counts. Relaxin or B7-33 treatment also increased renal matrix metalloproteinase-2 and reduced tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 levels (all P < .01 vs UUO alone). This study demonstrated the diagnostic value of the HistoIndex platform over currently used staining techniques."
https://openalex.org/W3159154696,"Although silver is an efficient antimicrobial and is a widely used antiseptic in wound healing, previous studies have reported the cytotoxic in vitro effects of silver dressings. Moreover, few studies have addressed the distribution of silver in chronic wounds. The study compares the healing of chronic wounds treated with a standard-of-care silver dressing (Ag-CMC) and a dressing containing antiseptic octenidine (OCT-HA). Biopsies were taken from two wound areas before the commencement of treatment (baseline), after 2 weeks and after 6 weeks (the end of the study). We analyzed the histopathologic wound-healing score, silver distribution, and expression of selected genes. The wound-healing score improved significantly in the wounded area treated with OCT-HA after 2 weeks compared to the baseline and the Ag-CMC. The Ag-CMC wound areas improved after 6 weeks compared to the baseline. Moreover, collagen maturation and decreases in the granulocyte and macrophage counts were faster in the OCT-HA parts. Treatment with OCT-HA resulted in less wound slough. The silver, visualized via autometallography, penetrated approximately 2 mm into the wound tissue and associated around capillaries and ECM fibers, and was detected in phagocytes. The metallothionein gene expression was elevated in the Ag-CMC wound parts. This exploratory study determined the penetration of silver into human chronic wounds and changes in the distribution thereof during treatment. We observed that silver directly affects the cells in the wound and elevates the metallothionein gene expression. Octenidine and hyaluronan dressings provide a suitable alternative to silver and carboxymethyl cellulose dressings without supplying silver to the wound."
https://openalex.org/W3159278417,"Aging is a gradual biological process characterized by a decrease in cellular and organism functions. Aging-related processes involve changes in the expression and activity of several proteins. Here, we identified the transmembrane protease serine 11a (TMPRSS11a) as a new age-specific protein that plays an important role in skin wound healing. TMPRSS11a levels increased with age in rodent and human skin and gingival samples. Strikingly, overexpression of TMPRSS11a decreased cell migration and spreading, and inducing cellular senescence. Mass spectrometry, bioinformatics, and functional analyses revealed that TMPRSS11a interacts with integrin β1 through an RGD sequence contained within the C-terminal domain and that this motif was relevant for cell migration. Moreover, TMPRSS11a was associated with cellular senescence, as shown by overexpression and downregulation experiments. In agreement with tissue-specific expression of TMPRSS11a, shRNA-mediated downregulation of this protein improved wound healing in the skin, but not in the skeletal muscle of old mice, where TMPRSS11a is undetectable. Collectively, these findings indicate that TMPRSS11a is a tissue-specific factor relevant for wound healing, which becomes elevated with aging, promoting cellular senescence and inhibiting cell migration and skin repair."
https://openalex.org/W3157348395,"The present study evaluates the effect of calcium alginate aerogel as a potential drug carrier, on the liver and kidney functions, and on the gut microbiota of Wistar rats. The studied alginate aerogel was prepared in the form of nanoparticles using the jet cutting technique, and they were characterized in terms of specific surface areas, outer morphology and particle size distribution. For the in vivo study, calcium alginate aerogel was administered orally, and liver and kidney functions were tested for one week and for four weeks in two distinct studies. During the short-term in vivo study, feces samples were collected for bacterial DNA extraction followed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing analyses to detect changes in gut microbiota. Results showed that the prepared alginate aerogel has an average BET-specific surface area of around 540 m 2 /g, with a pore volume of 7.4 cc/g, and pore width of 30–50 nm. The in vivo study revealed that the levels of the studied kidney and liver enzymes didn’t exceed the highest level of the normal range. The study of gut microbiota showed different patterns; certain groups of bacteria, such as Clostridia and Bacteriodia, increased during the aerogels regime and continued to increase after the aerogel was stopped. While other groups such as Erysipelotrichia , and Candidatus saccharibacteria increased during aerogels treatment, and then decreased again after one month. Members of the Bacilli class showed a unique trend, that is, after being the most abundant group (63%) at time 0, their relative abundance decreased dramatically until it reached &lt; 5%; which was the case even after stopping the aerogel treatment."

The SYNTAX score and metabolic and inflammatory markers were quantified and compared. THP-1 cell studies and an animal study of coronary intimal hyperplasia were also carried out. We found that the DM-AMI group showed a higher SYNTAX score than the non-DM-AMI group (P < .05). The DM-AMI group showed the highest expression levels of TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α), and interleukin (IL)-17 and the lowest expression level of IL-10, followed by the non-DM-AMI group and the SCHD group (P < .05). THP-1 cell studies showed that BAY87-2243 (a HIF-1α inhibitor) reversed the increase in IL-17 and decrease in IL-10 expression induced by hyperglycemia. Amlexanox (a TBK1 inhibitor) reversed the increase in HIF-1α expression induced by hyperglycemia. Amlexanox treatment resulted in lower coronary artery intimal hyperplasia and a larger lumen area in a diabetic swine model. We conclude that hyperglycemia might aggravate the complexity of coronary atherosclerosis through activation of TBK1-HIF-1α-mediated IL-17/IL-10 signaling. Thus, TBK1 may be a novel drug therapy target for CHD complicated with DM."
https://openalex.org/W3159613105,"Introduction In Kenya, Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting (FGM/C) is highly prevalent in specific communities such as the Maasai and Somali. With the intention of curtailing FMG/C prevalence in Maasai community, Amref Health Africa, designed and implemented a novel intervention—community-led alternative rite of passage (CLARP) in Kajiado County in Kenya since 2009. The study: a) determined the impact of the CLARP model on FGM/C, child early and forced marriages (CEFM), teenage pregnancies (TP) and years of schooling among girls and b) explored the attitude, perception and practices of community stakeholders towards FGM/C. Methods We utilised a mixed methods approach. A difference-in-difference approach was used to quantify the average impact of the model with Kajiado as the intervention County and Mandera, Marsabit and Wajir as control counties. The approach relied on secondary data analysis of the Kenya Demographic and Health Survey (KDHS) 2003, 2008–2009 and 2014. A qualitative approach involving focus group discussions, in-depth interviews and key informant interviews were conducted with various respondents and community stakeholders to document experiences, attitude and practices towards FGM/C. Results The CLARP has contributed to: 1) decline in FGM/C prevalence, CEFM rates and TP rates among girls by 24.2% (p&lt;0.10), 4.9% (p&lt;0.01) and 6.3% (p&lt;0.01) respectively. 2) increase in girls schooling years by 2.5 years (p&lt;0.05). Perceived CLARP benefits to girls included: reduction in teenage marriages and childbirth; increased school retention and completion; teenage pregnancies reduction and decline in FGM/C prevalence. Community stakeholders in Kajiado believe that CLARP has been embraced in the community because of its impacts in the lives of its beneficiaries and their families. Conclusion This study demonstrated that CLARP has been positively received by the Maasai community and has played a significant role in attenuating FGM/C, CEFM and TP in Kajiado, while contributing to increasing girls’ schooling years. CLARP is replicable as it is currently being implemented in Tanzania. We recommend scaling it up for adoption by stakeholders implementing in other counties that practice FGM/C as a rite of passage in Kenya and across other sub Saharan Africa countries."
https://openalex.org/W3158114994,"Na+ -K+ -2Cl- cotransporter-1 (NKCC1) facilitates basolateral K+ and Cl- uptake, supporting their efflux across mucosal membranes of colonic epithelial cells. NKCC1 activity has also been shown to be critical for electrogenic K+ secretion induced by aldosterone, which is known to stimulate large-conductance K+ (BK) channel expression in mucosal membranes. This study was aimed to (1) identify whether aldosterone enhances NKCC1 expression specifically to support BK-mediated K+ secretion and (2) to determine whether increased NKCC1 supports electrogenic Cl- secretion in parallel to K+ secretion. Dietary Na+ depletion was used to induce secondary hyperaldosteronism in rats, or aldosterone was administered ex vivo to rat distal colonic mucosae. NKCC1-dependent electrogenic K+ or Cl- secretion was measured as a function of short circuit current (ISC ). qRT-PCR, western blot, and immunofluorescence analyses were performed using standard techniques. Aldosterone enhanced NKCC1 and BKα expression and electrogenic K+ secretion in the distal colon, which was inhibited by either serosal bumetanide (NKCC1 inhibitor) or mucosal iberiotoxin (IbTX; BK channel blocker), but not TRAM-34 (IK channel blocker). Expression of NKCC1 and BKα proteins was enhanced in crypt cells of hyper-aldosterone rats. However, neither NKCC1-dependent Cl- secretion nor CFTR (apical Cl- channel) expression was enhanced by aldosterone. We conclude that aldosterone enhances NKCC1 to support BK-mediated K+ secretion independently of Cl- secretion in the distal colon. The regulation of NKCC1 expression/K+ secretion by aldosterone may be a therapeutic target in treating gastrointestinal disorders associated with alterations in colonic K+ transport, such as colonic pseudo-obstruction, and hyperkalemia associated with renal disease."
https://openalex.org/W3158320892,"The escalating cost of civil litigation is leaving many defendants and plaintiffs unable to meet legal expenses such as attorney fees, court charges and others. This significantly impacts their ability to sue or defend themselves effectively. Related to this phenomenon is the ethics discussion around access to justice and crowdfunding. This article explores the dimensions that explain the phenomenon of litigation crowdfunding. Using data from CrowdJustice, a popular Internet fundraising platform used to assist in turning legal cases into publicly funded social cases, we study litigation crowdfunding through the lenses of the number of pledges, goal achievement, target amount, length of description, country, case category, and others. Overall, we see a higher number of cases seeking funding in the categories of human rights, environment, and judicial review. Meanwhile, the platform offers access to funding for other less prominent categories, such as voting rights, personal injury, intellectual property, and data &amp; privacy. At the same time, donors are willing to donate more to cases related to health, politics, and public services. Also noteworthy is that while donors are willing to donate to education, animal welfare, data &amp; privacy, and inquest-related cases, they are not willing to donate large sums to these causes. In terms of lawyer/law firm status, donors are more willing to donate to cases assisted by experienced lawyers. Furthermore, we also note that the higher the number of successful cases an attorney presents, the greater the amount raised. We analyzed valence, arousal, and dominance in case description and found they have a positive relationship with funds raised. Also, when a case description is updated on a crowdsourcing site, it ends up being more successful in funding—at least in the categories of health, immigration, and judicial review. This is not the case, however, for categories such as public service, human rights, and environment. Our research addresses whether litigation crowdfunding, in particular, levels the playing field in terms of opening up financing opportunities for those individuals who cannot afford the costs of litigation. While it may support social justice, ethical concerns with regards to the kinds of campaigns must also be addressed. Most of the ethical concerns center around issues relating to both the fundraisers and donors. Our findings have ethical and social justice implications for crowdfunding platform design."
https://openalex.org/W3158926095,"Introduction Most evidence on associations between alcohol use behaviors and the characteristics of its social and physical context is based on self-reports from study participants and, thus, only account for their subjective impressions of the situation. This study explores the feasibility of obtaining alternative measures of loudness, brightness, and attendance (number of people) using 10-second video clips of real-life drinking occasions rated by human annotators and computer algorithms, and explores the associations of these measures with participants’ choice to drink alcohol or not. Methods Using a custom-built smartphone application, 215 16-25-year-olds documented characteristics of 2,380 weekend night drinking events using questionnaires and videos. Ratings of loudness, brightness, and attendance were obtained from three sources, namely in-situ participants’ ratings, video-based annotator ratings, and video-based computer algorithm ratings. Bivariate statistics explored differences in ratings across sources. Multilevel logistic regressions assessed the associations of contextual characteristics with alcohol use. Finally, model fit indices and cross-validation were used to assess the ability of each set of contextual measures to predict participants’ alcohol use. Results Raw ratings of brightness, loudness and attendance differed slightly across sources, but were all correlated ( r = .21 to .82, all p &lt; .001). Participants rated bars/pubs as being louder (Cohen’s d = 0.50 [95%-CI: 0.07–0.92]), and annotators rated private places as darker ( d = 1.21 [95%-CI: 0.99–1.43]) when alcohol was consumed than when alcohol was not consumed. Multilevel logistic regressions showed that drinking in private places was more likely in louder (OR participants = 1.74 [CI: 1.31–2.32]; OR annotators = 3.22 [CI: 2.06–5.03]; OR algorithm = 2.62 [CI: 1.83–3.76]), more attended (OR participants = 1.10 [CI: 1.03–1.18]; OR algorithm = 1.19 [CI: 1.07–1.32]) and darker (OR = 0.64 [CI: 0.44–0.94]) situations. In commercial venues, drinking was more likely in darker (OR participants = 0.67 [CI: 0.47–0.94]; OR annotators = 0.53 [CI: 0.33–0.85]; OR algorithm = 0.58 [CI: 0.37–0.88]) and louder (OR participants = 1.40 [CI: 1.02–1.92]; OR algorithm = 2.45 [CI: 1.25–4.80]) places. Higher inference accuracies were found for the models based on the annotators’ ratings (80% to 84%) and the algorithms’ ratings (76% to 86%) than on the participants’ ratings (69% to 71%). Conclusions Several contextual characteristics are associated with increased odds of drinking in private and commercial settings, and might serve as a basis for the development of prevention measures. Regarding assessment of contextual characteristics, annotators and algorithms might serve as appropriate substitutes of participants’ in-situ impressions for correlational and regression analyses despite differences in raw ratings. Collecting contextual data by means of sensors or media files is recommended for future research."
https://openalex.org/W3159328606,"Salmonella Enteritidis is an intracellular foodborne pathogen that has developed multiple mechanisms to alter poultry intestinal physiology and infect the gut. Short chain fatty acid butyrate is derived from microbiota metabolic activities, and it maintains gut homeostasis. There is limited understanding on the interaction between S. Enteritidis infection, butyrate, and host intestinal response. To fill this knowledge gap, chicken macrophages (also known as HTC cells) were infected with S. Enteritidis, treated with sodium butyrate, and proteomic analysis was performed. A growth curve assay was conducted to determine sub-inhibitory concentration (SIC, concentration that do not affect bacterial growth compared to control) of sodium butyrate against S. Enteritidis. HTC cells were infected with S. Enteritidis in the presence and absence of SIC of sodium butyrate. The proteins were extracted and analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry. Our results showed that the SIC was 45 mM. Notably, S. Enteritidis-infected HTC cells upregulated macrophage proteins involved in ATP synthesis through oxidative phosphorylation such as ATP synthase subunit alpha (ATP5A1), ATP synthase subunit d, mitochondrial (ATP5PD) and cellular apoptosis such as Cytochrome-c (CYC). Furthermore, sodium butyrate influenced S. Enteritidis-infected HTC cells by reducing the expression of macrophage proteins mediating actin cytoskeletal rearrangements such as WD repeat-containing protein-1 (WDR1), Alpha actinin-1 (ACTN1), Vinculin (VCL) and Protein disulfide isomerase (P4HB) and intracellular S. Enteritidis growth and replication such as V-type proton ATPase catalytic subunit A (ATPV1A). Interestingly, sodium butyrate increased the expression of infected HTC cell protein involving in bacterial killing such as Vimentin (VIM). In conclusion, sodium butyrate modulates the expression of HTC cell proteins essential for S. Enteritidis invasion."
https://openalex.org/W3159402909,"The biliary system is routinely accessed for clinical purposes via endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). We previously pioneered ERCP-mediated hydrodynamic injection in large animal models as an innovative gene delivery approach for monogenic liver diseases. However, the procedure poses potential safety concerns related mainly to liver or biliary tree injury. Here, we sought to further define biliary hydrodynamic injection parameters that are well-tolerated in a human-sized animal model. ERCP was performed in pigs, and hydrodynamic injection carried out using a novel protocol to reduce duct wall stress. Each pig was subjected to multiple repeated injections to expedite testing and judge tolerability. Different injection parameters (volume, flow rate) and injection port diameters were tested. Vital signs were monitored throughout the procedure, and liver enzyme panels were collected pre- and post-procedure. Pigs tolerated repeated biliary hydrodynamic injections with only occasional, mild, isolated elevation in aspartate aminotransferase (AST), which returned to normal levels within one day post-injection. All other liver tests remained unchanged. No upper limit of volume tolerance was reached, which suggests the biliary tree can readily transmit fluid into the vascular space. Flow rates up to 10 mL/sec were also tolerated with minimal disturbance to vital signs and no anatomic rupture of bile ducts. Measured intrabiliary pressure was up to 150 mmHg, and fluid-filled vesicles were induced in liver histology at high flow rates, mimicking the changes in histology observed in mouse liver after hydrodynamic tail vein injection. Overall, our investigations in a human-sized pig liver using standard clinical equipment suggest that ERCP-guided hydrodynamic injection will be safely tolerated in patients. Future investigations will interrogate if higher flow rates and pressure mediate higher DNA delivery efficiencies."
https://openalex.org/W3159467860,"The objective of this study is to improve and optimize the formulation of Genistein in capsules in order to result in a better pharmacokinetic profile comparing to existing commercial products. In order to do this, five different formulations of Genistein capsules were developed and examined by reviewing their disintegration and dissolution properties. Furthermore, flowability of the powder along with potent incompatibilities between Genistein and its excipients were monitored through their thermal properties. The final formulation of Genistein was quantified using HPLC analysis and then its stability was evaluated thoroughly in real time and accelerated conditions. Finally, with the target to have a product with actual results, in vitro and in vivo studies were conducted. The final product proved to have better results in disintegration and dissolution. Moreover, R.G.C.C.’s capsules exhibited enhanced action in human cell lines as well as impressive pharmacokinetic results in animal models. The in vitro results showed an advantage of the R.G.C.C. product compared to the commercial one, whereas its maximum concertation in vivo was determined 34% higher than the commercial one."
https://openalex.org/W3157471989,"Background Parkinson’s disease is characterized by motor dysfunctions including bradykinesia. In a recent study, eight weeks of daily transcranial stimulation with bipolar pulsed electromagnetic fields improved functional rate of force development and decreased inter-hand tremor coherence in patients with mild Parkinson’s disease. Objective To investigate the effect of long-term treatment with transcranial bipolar pulsed electromagnetic fields on motor performance in terms of movement speed and on neurotrophic and angiogenic factors. Methods Patients diagnosed with idiopathic Parkinson’s disease had either daily 30-min treatment with bipolar (±50 V) transcranial pulsed electromagnetic stimulation (squared pulses, 3ms duration) for three eight-week periods separated by one-week pauses (T-PEMF group) (n = 16) or were included in a PD-control group (n = 8). Movement speed was assessed in a six-cycle sit-to-stand task performed on a force plate. Cerebrospinal fluid and venous blood were collected and analyzed for erythropoietin and vascular endothelial growth factor. Results Major significant improvement of movement speed compared to the natural development of the disease was found (p = 0.001). Thus, task completion time decreased gradually during the treatment period from 10.10s to 8.23s (p&lt;0.001). The untreated PD-control group did not change (p = 0.458). The treated group did not differ statistically from that of a healthy age matched reference group at completion of treatment. Erythropoietin concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid also increased significantly in the treated group (p = 0.012). Conclusion Long-term treatment with transcranial bipolar pulsed electromagnetic fields increased movement speed markedly and elevated erythropoietin levels. We hypothesize that treatment with transcranial bipolar pulsed electromagnetic fields improved functional performance by increasing dopamine levels in the brain, possibly through erythropoietin induced neural repair and/or protection of dopaminergic neurons."
https://openalex.org/W3157542480,"The objectives of this study were to evaluate the accuracy of personalized numerical simulations of the electrical activity in human ventricles by comparing simulated electrocardiograms (ECGs) with real patients’ ECGs and analyzing the sensitivity of the model output to variations in the model parameters. We used standard 12-lead ECGs and up to 224 unipolar body-surface ECGs to record three patients with cardiac resynchronization therapy devices and three patients with focal ventricular tachycardia. Patient-tailored geometrical models of the ventricles, atria, large vessels, liver, and spine were created using computed tomography data. Ten cases of focal ventricular activation were simulated using the bidomain model and the TNNP 2006 cellular model. The population-based values of electrical conductivities and other model parameters were used for accuracy analysis, and their variations were used for sensitivity analysis. The mean correlation coefficient between the simulated and real ECGs varied significantly (from r = 0.29 to r = 0.86) among the simulated cases. A strong mean correlation (r &gt; 0.7) was found in eight of the ten model cases. The accuracy of the ECG simulation varied widely in the same patient depending on the localization of the excitation origin. The sensitivity analysis revealed that variations in the anisotropy ratio, blood conductivity, and cellular apicobasal heterogeneity had the strongest influence on transmembrane potential, while variation in lung conductivity had the greatest influence on body-surface ECGs. Futhermore, the anisotropy ratio predominantly affected the latest activation time and repolarization time dispersion, while the cellular apicobasal heterogeneity mainly affected the dispersion of action potential duration, and variation in lung conductivity mainly led to changes in the amplitudes of ECGs and cardiac electrograms. We also found that the effects of certain parameter variations had specific regional patterns on the cardiac and body surfaces. These observations are useful for further developing personalized cardiac models."
https://openalex.org/W3158508340,"Patients with mild traumatic brain injuries (mTBI) often report difficulties in motor coordination and visuo-spatial attention. However, the consequences of mTBI on fine motor and visuo-motor coordination are still not well understood. We aimed to evaluate whether mTBI had a concomitant effect on fine motor ability and visuo-motor integration and whether this is related to visual perception and visuo-spatial attention impairments, including patients at different symptoms stage. Eleven mTBI patients (mean age 22.8 years) and ten healthy controls participated in the study. Visuo-motor integration of fine motor abilities and form recognition were measured with the Beery-Buktenica Developmental Test of Visual-Motor Integration test, motion perception was evaluated with motion coherence test, critical flicker fusion was measured with Pocket CFF tester. Visuo-spatial was assessed with the Ruff 2 &amp; 7 Selection Attention Test. mTBI patients showed reduced visuo-motor integration, form recognition, and motor deficits as well as visuo-spatial attention impairment, while motion perception and critical flicker fusion were not impaired. These preliminary findings suggest that the temporary brain insults deriving from mTBI compromise fine motor skills, visuomotor integration, form recognition, and visuo-spatial attention. The impairment in visuo-motor coordination was associated with speed in visuo-attention and correlated with symptoms severity while motor ability was correlated with time since concussion. Given the strong correlation between visuomotor coordination and symptom severity, further investigation with a larger sample seems warranted. Since there appeared to be differences in motor skills with respect to symptom stage, further research is needed to investigate symptom profiles associated with visuomotor coordination and fine motor deficits in mTBI patients."
https://openalex.org/W3159472331,"The tiny encryption algorithm (TEA) is widely used when performing dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) calculations in parallel, usually on distributed memory systems. In this research, we reduced the computational cost of the TEA hash function and investigated the influence of the quality of the random numbers generated on the results of DPD calculations. It has already been established that the randomness, or quality, of the random numbers depend on the number of processes from internal functions such as SHIFT, XOR and ADD, which are commonly referred to as “rounds”. Surprisingly, if we choose seed numbers from high entropy sources, with a minimum number of rounds, the quality of the random numbers generated is sufficient to successfully perform accurate DPD simulations. Although it is well known that using a minimal number of rounds is insufficient for generating high-quality random numbers, the combination of selecting good seed numbers and the robustness of DPD simulations means that we can reduce the random number generation cost without reducing the accuracy of the simulation results."
https://openalex.org/W3159500903,"Background Coronavirus disease 2019 is a serious respiratory virus pandemic. Patient characteristics, knowledge of the COVID-19 disease, risk behaviour and mental state will differ between individuals. The primary aim of this study was to investigate these variables in patients visiting an emergency department in the Netherlands during the COVID-19 pandemic and to compare the “COVID-19 suspected” (positive and negative tested group) with the “COVID-19 not suspected” (control group) and to compare in the “COVID-19 suspected” group, the positive and negative tested patients. Methods Consecutive adult patients, visiting the emergency room at the Franciscus Gasthuis &amp; Vlietland, Rotterdam, the Netherlands, were asked to fill out questionnaires on the abovementioned items on an iPad. The patients were either “COVID-19 suspected” (positive and negative tested group) or “COVID-19 not suspected” (control group). Results This study included a total of 159 patients, 33 (21%) tested positive, 85 (53%) negative and 41 (26%) were COVID-19 not suspected (control group). All patients in this study were generally aware of transmission risks and virulence and adhered to the non-pharmaceutical interventions. Working as a health care professional was correlated to a higher risk of SARS-Cov-2 infection (p- value 0.04). COVID-19 suspected patients had a significantly higher level of anxiety compared to COVID-19 not suspected patients (p-value &lt; 0.001). The higher the anxiety, the more seriously hygiene measures were followed. The anxiety scores of the patients with (pulmonary) comorbidities were significantly higher than without comorbidities. Conclusion This is one of the first (large) study that investigates and compares patient characteristics, knowledge, behaviour, illness perception, and mental state with respect to COVID-19 of patients visiting the emergency room, subdivided as being suspected of having COVID-19 (positive or negative tested) and a control group not suspected of having COVID-19. All patients in this study were generally aware of transmission risks and virulence and adhered to the non-pharmaceutical interventions. COVID-19 suspected patients and patients with (pulmonary) comorbidities were significantly more anxious. However, there is no mass hysteria regarding COVID-19. The higher the degree of fear, the more carefully hygiene measures were observed. Knowledge about the coping of the population during the COVID-19 pandemic is very important, certainly also in the perspective of a possible second outbreak of COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W2999953507,"Dynamics of complex social systems has often been described in the framework of temporal networks, where links are considered to exist only at the moment of interaction between nodes. Such interaction patterns are not only driven by internal interaction mechanisms, but also affected by environmental changes. To investigate the impact of the environmental changes on the dynamics of temporal networks, we analyze several face-to-face interaction datasets using the multiscale entropy (MSE) method to find that the observed temporal correlations can be categorized according to the environmental similarity of datasets such as classes and break times in schools. By devising and studying a temporal network model considering a periodically changing environment as well as a preferential activation mechanism, we numerically show that our model could successfully reproduce various empirical results by the MSE method in terms of multiscale temporal correlations. Our results demonstrate that the environmental changes can play an important role in shaping the dynamics of temporal networks when the interactions between nodes are influenced by the environment of the systems."
https://openalex.org/W3157722841,"It is currently unknown whether differences in neural responsiveness to infant cues observed in postpartum affective disturbance are specific to depression/anxiety or are better attributed to a common component of internalizing distress. It is also unknown whether differences in mothers’ brain response can be accounted for by effects of past episodes, or if current neural processing of her child may serve as a risk factor for development of future symptoms. Twenty-four mothers from a community-based sample participated in an fMRI session viewing their 3-month- old infant during tasks evoking positive or negative emotion. They were tracked across the ensuing 15 months to monitor changes in affective symptoms. Past and current episodes of depression and anxiety, as well as future symptoms, were used to predict differences in mothers’ hemodynamic response to their infant in positive compared to negative emotion contexts. Lower relative activation in largely overlapping brain regions involving frontal lobe structures to own infant positive vs. negative emotion was associated with concurrent (3-month) depression diagnosis and prospective (3–18 month) depression and anxiety symptoms. There was little evidence for impacts of past psychopathology (more limited effect of past anxiety and nonsignificant effect of past depression). Results suggest biased maternal processing of infant emotions during postpartum depression and anxiety is largely accounted for by a shared source of variance (internalizing distress). Furthermore, differential maternal responsiveness to her infant’s emotional cues is specifically associated with the perpetuation of postpartum symptoms, as opposed to more general phenotypic or scarring effects of past psychopathology."
https://openalex.org/W3157965995,"Background Theory and research suggest that social dominance is important for multiple forms of psychopathology, and yet few studies have considered multiple dimensions of psychopathology simultaneously, and relatively few have used well-validated behavioral indices. Method Among 81 undergraduates, we used a well-validated experimental approach of assigning participants to a leadership or subordinate position, and we examined how self-rated severity of depression, social anxiety, manic tendencies, and psychopathy relate to psychophysiological and affective reactivity to this role. Results Consistent with hypotheses, manic symptoms related to more discomfort in the subordinate role compared to the leadership role, as evidenced by more decline in positive affect, more discomfort, and a larger RSA decline, while depression symptoms related to a more positive response to the subordinate role than the leadership role, including more positive affect and more comfort in the assigned role. Social anxiety was related to discomfort regardless of the assigned role, and those with higher psychopathy symptoms did not show differential response to assigned roles. Limitations Findings are limited by the mild symptom levels and absence of hormonal data. Conclusions Findings provide novel transdiagnostic evidence for the importance of social dominance to differentiate diverse forms of psychopathology."
https://openalex.org/W3158211927,"Colorectal cancer remains one of the most frequent malignancies (third place at both genders) worldwide in the last decade, owing to significant changes in modern dietary habits. Approximately half of the patients develop metastases during the course of their disease. The available therapeutic armamentarium is constantly evolving, raising questions regarding the best approach for improving survival. Bevacizumab remains one of the most widely used therapies for treating metastatic colorectal cancer and can be used after progression. This study aimed to identify the best chemotherapy partner for bevacizumab after progression. We performed a retrospective analysis of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who were treated with bevacizumab as first- and second-line chemotherapy. Data were collected for 151 patients, 40 of whom were treated with double-dose bevacizumab after the first progression. The two standard chemotherapy regimens combined with bevacizumab were FOLFIRI/CAPIRI and FOLFOX4/CAPEOX. The initiation of first-line treatment with irinotecan-based chemotherapy improved progression-free survival and time to treatment failure but not overall survival. After the first progression, retreatment with the same regimen as that used in the induction phase was the best approach for improving overall survival (median overall survival: 46.5 vs. 27.0 months for the same vs. switched strategy, respectively). No correlations were observed between the dose intensity of irinotecan, oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil, or bevacizumab and the overall survival, progression-free survival in the first-/second-line treatment, and time to treatment failure. Interaction between an irinotecan-based regimen as a second-line treatment and double-dose bevacizumab after progression was associated with an improved overall survival (p = 0.06). Initiating systemic treatment with an irinotecan-based regimen in combination with bevacizumab improved the progression-free survival in the first-line treatment and time to treatment failure. In terms of overall survival, bevacizumab treatment after the first progression is better partnered with the same regimen as that used in the induction phase."
https://openalex.org/W3158620613,"Fetal echocardiography is an operator-dependent examination technique requiring a high level of expertise. Pulsed-wave Doppler (PWD) is often used as a reference for the mechanical activity of the heart, from which several quantitative parameters can be extracted. These aspects suggest the development of software tools that can reliably identify complete and clinically meaningful fetal cardiac cycles that can enable their automatic measurement. Several scientific works have addressed the tracing of the PWD velocity envelope. In this work, we assess the different steps involved in the signal processing chains that enable PWD envelope tracing. We apply a supervised classifier trained on envelopes traced by different signal processing chains for distinguishing complete and measurable PWD heartbeats from incomplete or malformed ones, which makes it possible to determine the impact of each of the different processing steps on the detection accuracy. In this study, we collected 43 images and labeled 174,319 PWD segments from 25 pregnant women volunteers. By considering seven envelope tracing techniques and the 23 different processing steps involved in their implementation, the results of our study reveal that, compared to the steps investigated in most other works, those that achieve binarisation and envelope extraction are significantly more important ( p &lt; 0.05). The best approaches among those studied enabled greater than 98% accuracy on our large manually annotated dataset."
https://openalex.org/W3159387064,"The frequency of foodborne outbreaks epidemiologically associated with Listeria monocytogenes in fresh produce has increased in recent years. Although L . monocytogenes may be transferred from the environment to vegetables during farming, contamination of food products most commonly occurs in food processing facilities, where L . monocytogenes has the ability to establish and persist on processing equipment. The current study was undertaken to collect data on the occurrence of L . monocytogenes and the identity of the endogenous microbiota in a fresh produce processing facility, for which information has remained scarce. L . monocytogenes was not detected in the facility. Experiments simulating conditions in the processing environment were performed, including examination of bacterial growth in nutrients based on vegetables (salad juice) compared to in other types of nutrients (fish, meat). Results showed that the endogenous microbiota (dominated by Pseudomonas ) grew well in iceberg lettuce and rocket salad juice at low temperatures, while growth inhibition of L . monocytogenes was observed, particularly in rocket salad juice. The anti-listerial activity in rocket salad juice was retained in a polar chromatographic fraction containing several metabolites. Characterization of this active fraction, using LC-MS/MS, led to identification of 19 compounds including nucleosides and amino acids. Further work is necessary to determine the molecular mechanism responsible for the inhibitory activity of rocket salad constituents. The study nevertheless suggests that the available nutrients, as well as a low temperature (3 °C) and the in-house bacterial flora, may influence the prevalence of L . monocytogenes in fresh produce processing facilities."
https://openalex.org/W3159402411,"Background Delusion occupies an important position in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with psychoses. Although Karl Jaspers’ concept of the primary delusion (PD) is a key hypothesis in descriptive phenomenology concerning the primordial experience of delusion, to our knowledge it has not been verified in empirical studies of patients with psychosis, and the relationship between PDs and fully developed delusions remains unclear. Methods The subjects were 108 psychiatric patients diagnosed with DSM-IV schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who had persisting delusions. This investigation used a newly devised semi-structured interview, the Delusion and its Origin Assessment Interview (DOAI), and the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. PDs enquired about in the DOAI were delusional perception, delusional memory, delusional mood, and delusional intuition. Associations of PDs with delusion themes and delusion features extracted from DOAI items by factor analysis were examined using correlational and MANCOVA regression analyses. Reliability studies of the DOAI were also conducted. Results The reliability and correlation analyses suggested robust psychometric properties of the DOAI. The percentages of subjects reporting PD phenomena as delusion origins and currently present were 93% and 84%, respectively. MANCOVA revealed several significant associations, including between delusional perception and delusional mood and persecutory themes, between delusional intuition and grandiose delusions, and between delusional perception and intuition and systematization of delusions. Discussion This study demonstrates that PDs can be considered as principal origins of delusions by subjects with psychosis, and have meaningful connections with the characteristics of their fully developed delusions. The associations between PDs and delusion characteristics can be interpreted in terms of progression processes of delusions, which are seen as intensification and generalization of cognitive and affective pathologies in PDs. The findings are also consistent with the neurobiological hypothesis that aberrant salience attribution to stimuli, as in PDs, is the primary phenomenon caused by abnormal dopamine system regulation. Further studies are needed to clarify delusion progression processes relating to PDs and to substantiate their clinical meanings."
https://openalex.org/W3157093977,"Background This study aimed to collect data on “triple therapy” for heart failure (HF) with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (or receptor blockers), β-blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in all eight regions of Japan and clarify the reason for the selection of this therapeutic approach. Methods and results We used data from April 2017 to March 2018 from the Medical Data Vision database (380 facilities) to analyze factors impacting triple therapy for HF. Among patients who were hospitalized for HF during the study period, 51,933 patients met the inclusion criteria and underwent further analyses. A reference value of 20.45% from Kanto was used to compare the eight Japanese regions. From the patient cohort, 10,006 (19.27%) patients receiving triple therapy were identified. The highest and lowest rates of triple therapy were in Chugoku (21.90%) and Shikoku (14.27%), respectively, suggesting regional differences in the use of triple therapy at discharge for patients with HF (P &lt; 0.001). Regression analysis revealed a decrease in the administration of triple therapy for patients with chronic kidney disease (odds ratio [OR], 0.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.43–0.48]; P &lt; 0.001), those aged 75 years and older (OR, 0.46, 95% CI: 0.44–0.49; P &lt; 0.001), those from Shikoku (OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.60–0.80; P &lt; 0.001), those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.68–0.84; P &lt; 0.001), those with anemia (OR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.62–0.98; P = 0.034), and those from Tohoku (OR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.75–0.92; P &lt; 0.001). Conclusions Future efforts to rectify the regional variance in drug therapy conforming to the guidelines for the treatment of acute and chronic HF will help to extend the healthy lifespans of patients with HF. Further clarification is required to determine instances where triple therapy should be avoided based on patient factors, and appropriate countermeasures should be identified."
https://openalex.org/W3157385247,"While public engagement with science activities traditionally inhabits physical environments (i.e., museum exhibits), as the Internet becomes more ubiquitous, new types of public engagement with science mediated through information technologies have emerged. Instead of having scientific findings filtered through traditional mediators, scientists have begun to take advantage of social media in order to communicate directly with the general public. This paper focuses on technology mediated public engagement with science in an online environment, specifically the sub-Reddit called “r/science”, on a popular platform, Reddit, in which we investigated the factors contributing to user engagement and perceived effects of science communication from the users’ perspectives. The survey instrument including user engagement scales, perceived effects of science communication, and demographics were distributed among 2000 participants in the r/science Ask Me Anything (AMA) series. We analyzed 146 survey responses using descriptive statistics and ordinal logistic regression. The findings indicated that the participants were generally engaged compared to ones in other studies that used the same user engagement scales and perceived positive effects on science communication, except when it came to building trust. Furthermore, we found that time spent on this particular platform appeared to be the most important factor when it came to positive perceived effects of r/science AMAs. This type of mediated public engagement has been insufficiently investigated, most particularly in terms of the examination of participants’ perspectives. This void is addressed in this study. The findings from the study will also be informative to similar platforms that support mediated public engagement with science."
https://openalex.org/W3157598718,"In a disease-state-dependent manner, the histamine-resistant itch in dry skin-based skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis (AD) and xerosis is mainly due to hyperinnervation in the epidermis. Semaphorin 3A (Sema3A) is a nerve repulsion factor expressed in keratinocytes and it suppresses nerve fiber elongation in the epidermis. Our previous studies have shown that Sema3A ointment inhibits epidermal hyperinnervation and scratching behavior and improves dermatitis scores in AD model mice. Therefore, we consider Sema3A as a key therapeutic target for improving histamine-resistant itch in AD and xerosis. This study was designed to screen a library of herbal plant extracts to discover compounds with potential to induce Sema3A in normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs) using a reporter gene assay, so that positive samples were found. Among the positive samples, only the extract of S . baicalensis was found to consistently increase Sema3A levels in cultured NHEKs in assays using quantitative real-time PCR and ELISA. In evaluation of reconstituted human epidermis models, the level of Sema3A protein in culture supernatants significantly increased by application of the extract of S . baicalensis . In addition, we investigated which components in the extract of S . baicalensis contributed to Sema3A induction and found that baicalin and baicalein markedly increased the relative luciferase activity, and that baicalein had higher induction activity than baicalin. Thus, these findings suggest that S . baicalensis extract and its compounds, baicalin and baicalein, may be promising candidates for improving histamine-resistant itch via the induction of Sema3A expression in epidermal keratinocytes."
https://openalex.org/W3157616392,"A joint analysis of the NCI60 small molecule screening data, their genetically defective genes, and mechanisms of action (MOA) of FDA approved cancer drugs screened in the NCI60 is proposed for identifying links between chemosensitivity, genomic defects and MOA. Self-Organizing-Maps (SOMs) are used to organize the chemosensitivity data. Student’s t-tests are used to identify SOM clusters with enhanced chemosensitivity for tumor cell lines with versus without genetically defective genes. Fisher’s exact and chi-square tests are used to reveal instances where defective gene to chemosensitivity associations have enriched MOAs. The results of this analysis find a relatively small set of defective genes, inclusive of ABL1 , AXL , BRAF , CDC25A , CDKN2A , IGF1R , KRAS , MECOM , MMP1 , MYC , NOTCH1 , NRAS , PIK3CG , PTK2 , RPTOR , SPTBN1 , STAT2 , TNKS and ZHX2 , as possible candidates for roles in chemosensitivity for compound MOAs that target primarily, but not exclusively, kinases, nucleic acid synthesis, protein synthesis, apoptosis and tubulin. These results find exploitable instances of enhanced chemosensitivity of compound MOA’s for selected defective genes. Collectively these findings will advance the interpretation of pre-clinical screening data as well as contribute towards the goals of cancer drug discovery, development decision making, and explanation of drug mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W3158670115,"Strand displacement DNA synthesis (SDDS) is an essential step in DNA replication. With magnetic tweezers, we investigated SDDS kinetics of wild-type gp90 and its exonuclease-deficient polymerase gp90 exo- at single-molecule level. A novel binding state of gp90 to the fork flap was confirmed prior to SDDS, suggesting an intermediate in the initiation of SDDS. The rate and processivity of SDDS by gp90 exo- or wt-gp90 are increased with force and dNTP concentration. The rate and processivity of exonuclease by wt-gp90 are decreased with force. High GC content decreases SDDS and exonuclease processivity but increases exonuclease rate for wt-gp90. The high force and dNTP concentration and low GC content facilitate the successive SDDS but retard the successive exonuclease for wt-gp90. Furthermore, increasing GC content accelerates the transition from SDDS or exonuclease to exonuclease. This work reveals the kinetics of SDDS in detail and offers a broader cognition on the regulation of various factors on SDDS at single-polymerase level."
https://openalex.org/W3158756891,"Background The number of people with diabetes is estimated to increase to 642 million by 2040, with most having type 2 diabetes. Patients with diabetes require continuous monitoring and possible treatment changes. Patient education is the process of enabling individuals to make informed decisions about their personal health-related behaviours and internet-enabled interventions have the potential to provide support and information to patients with diabetes. Objective The aim of the study was to design a portal prototype based onto two models of care and a contextualised education programme to support the self-management of diabetes patients by involving stakeholders in the Iranian province of Razavi-Khorasan. Methods A Design-Based Research framework was adopted. A qualitative research method was used to analyse interviews with patients and care givers. Mock-ups were developed first and designed with features of user-driven and self-care models of care. The mock-ups also had adaptation features, such as for control of the disease, ability to cure self, and family support. The portal prototype was developed iteratively by building on the mock-ups and evaluated through interviews. The features and elements of the mock-ups and the portal prototype were evaluated in an outpatient diabetes clinic in Mashhad. Results Thirty-three participants were involved in the study. The evaluation of the mock-ups resulted in two themes and seven categories: 1) self-care improvement, including self-care requirements and self-management, and 2) educational usefulness, including medical information, information mode, mobility, interaction, and efficiency. The mock-up evaluation was used as a basis for designing a portal prototype. Next, the portal prototype was evaluated, and three categories emerged from the interview data: 1) user experience, 2) functionality, and 3) interactivity. Participants were not able to prioritise between the two care models. Some functionalities of the portal could benefit from the development within a cultural context to determine differences to the best way to present material. Conclusions A portal prototype has been designed to include two care models to support self-management and functionalities that support aspects of culture-specific diabetes self-care. This study provides guidance on developing an internet-enabled educational portal, aimed at providing support for patients in their social context."
https://openalex.org/W3159218238,"Background In Japan, which has the most rapidly aging population worldwide, the number of geriatric health service facilities (GHSFs) has been increasing. GHSF physicians play significant roles in integrated care for the elderly. However, little is known about the temporal trends of physicians working in GHSFs. Objectives We aim to examine temporal trends in the characteristics of GHSF physicians and identify physician factors associated with starting work at GHSFs. Design Cohort study. Setting and participants Physicians responding to biennial national physician census surveys conducted by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan from 1996 to 2016. The response rate was approximately 90%. Methods We estimated temporal trends in the number, proportion, and characteristics of GHSF physicians. A multivariable logistic regression analysis identified physician factors associated with starting work at GHSFs 10 years after 1996–2006 and 2006–2016 among physicians not working in GHSFs at baseline (1996 and 2006). Results GHSF physicians rapidly increased in the first decade from 1,127 (0.47%) in 1996 to 2,891 (1.04%) in 2006; this trend then slowed and was almost proportional to that of all physicians, reaching 3,345 (1.05%) in 2016. GHSF physicians aged ≥65 years increased from 61.2% in 1996 to 68.5% in 2016, while those aged &lt;40 years decreased from 13.8% to 1.9%. The sex ratio (male vs. female physicians) increased from 5.7 in 1996 to 6.4 in 2016. Physician factors associated with starting to work at GHSFs included older age, female sex, rural area, working at hospitals, and majored in internal medicine and surgery specialties. Conclusions The proportion of GHSF physicians among all physicians has stagnated, and GHSF physicians are aging. Facilitating the transition of younger physicians from clinical practice in hospitals to GHSFs will increase the number of GHSF physicians and improve the quality of care in GHSFs."
https://openalex.org/W3159748226,"Background The serum N-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (NTx) is significantly higher in patients with Crohn disease (CD) than in healthy individuals and patients with ulcerative colitis. This study aimed to investigate whether an elevated serum NTx level is a risk predictor of osteoporosis in patients with CD. Methods Based on whether the femoral Z-score decreased over a 2-year period, 41 CD patients were divided into the ΔZ-score &lt;0 group (Z-score decreased) and the ΔZ-score ≥0 group (Z-score did not decrease). The risk predictors of a femoral Z-score decrease were examined. Furthermore, we investigated the correlations between the ΔZ-score (which represents the change in the Z-score over a 2-year period) and the mean levels of biomarkers, including the Crohn Disease Activity Index (CDAI), serum albumin, C-reactive protein, and bone metabolism markers (including NTx) measured initially (i.e., in our previous study) and 2 years later (present study). The relationships between anti-tumor necrosis factor α (anti-TNF-α) therapy and serum NTx levels were also examined. Results Although there was no correlation between the mean CDAI and the ΔZ-score, the mean serum NTx and albumin levels were significantly correlated with the ΔZ-score (P&lt;0.01 and P = 0.02, respectively). Furthermore, the femoral Z-score tended to be lower in the anti-TNF-α administration group than in the non-administration group. Conclusions These observations indicated that an elevated serum NTx could be a useful marker for predicting a decrease in the femoral bone mineral density in CD patients. Anti-TNF-α therapy maintained an elevated serum NTx level, suggesting that treatment with anti-TNF-α may help control increased bone resorption in CD patients."
