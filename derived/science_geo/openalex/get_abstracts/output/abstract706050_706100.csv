In 214 patients receiving ICB for melanoma, we observed increased severe irAE risk in minor allele carriers of rs16906115, intronic to IL7 . We found that rs16906115 forms a B cell-specific expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) to IL7 in patients. Patients carrying the risk allele demonstrate increased pre-treatment B cell IL7 expression, which independently associates with irAE risk, divergent immunoglobulin expression and more B cell receptor mutations. Consistent with the role of IL-7 in T cell development, risk allele carriers have distinct ICB-induced CD8 + T cell subset responses, skewing of T cell clonality and greater proportional repertoire occupancy by large clones. Finally, analysis of TCGA data suggests that risk allele carriers independently have improved melanoma survival. These observations highlight key roles for B cells and IL-7 in both ICB response and toxicity and clinical outcomes in melanoma."

However, the teenage pregnancy rates during COVID-19 pandemic period were poorly documented. This study aimed at determining the prevalence and the factors associated with teenage pregnancy among in-school teenage girls during the COVID-19 pandemic period in Hoima District Uganda. Methods This was a descriptive cross-sectional study that employed quantitative research methods. A total of 314 in-school teenage girls aged 13–19 years were selected using a multi-stage sampling techniques. Interviewer-administered questionnaires were used to collect the data from the participant’s homes during the period December 2021-January 2022. Data analysis was done using univariate, bi-variate, and multivariate. Results The prevalence of teenage pregnancy among the in-school teenage girls in Hoima district Uganda was 30.6% [96/314]. Higher teenage pregnancy rates were prevalent among the unmarried teenage girls [aOR: 9.6; 95%CI: 4.64–19.87; p = 0.000], teenage girls studying from boarding schools [aOR 2.83, 95%CI 1.36–5.86, p = 0.005], contraceptive non-users [aOR: 2.54; 95%CI: 1.12–5.4; p = 0.015] and teenage girls involved in sex trade [aOR 3.16, 95%CI 1.5–6.7, p = 0.003]. The factors associated with the reduced likelihood for teenage pregnancy included being an adult teenage girl aged 18–19 years [aOR: 0.15; 95%CI: 0.07–0.32; p = 0.000] and not receiving sex education during the period [aOR 0.36, 95%CI 0.13–0.62, p = 0.024]. Conclusion The results indicated that 3 out of 10 in-school teenage girls from Hoima district Uganda got pregnant during the COVID-19 pandemic period of 2021. Teenage pregnancy was prevalent among teenage girls who don’t use modern contraceptive methods and those involved in sex trade. Teenage pregnancy was however, less prevalent among adult teenage girls aged 18–19 years. The findings point to the need for health stakeholders to innovate creative policies, contingency plans and programmes aimed at delaying age for sexual activities, increasing contraceptive use and minimizing pregnancy risk from sex trade among in-school teenage girls during COVID-19 pandemics."
https://openalex.org/W4311691636,"The burden of cancer is large in Australia, and rates of cancer Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) adherence is suboptimal across various cancers.The objective of this study is to characterise clinician-perceived barriers and facilitators to cancer CPG adherence in Australia. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to collect data from 33 oncology-focused clinicians (surgeons, radiation oncologists, medical oncologists and haematologists). Clinicians were recruited in 2019 and 2020 through purposive and snowball sampling from 7 hospitals across Sydney, Australia, and interviewed either face-to-face in hospitals or by phone. Audio recordings were transcribed verbatim, and qualitative thematic analysis of the interview data was undertaken. Human research ethics committee approval and governance approval was granted (2019/ETH11722, #52019568810127).Five broad themes and subthemes of key barriers and facilitators to cancer treatment CPG adherence were identified: Theme 1: CPG content; Theme 2: Individual clinician and patient factors; Theme 3: Access to, awareness of and availability of CPGs; Theme 4: Organisational and cultural factors; and Theme 5: Development and implementation factors. The most frequently reported barriers to adherence were CPGs not catering for patient complexities, being slow to be updated, patient treatment preferences, geographical challenges for patients who travel large distances to access cancer services and limited funding of CPG recommended drugs. The most frequently reported facilitators to adherence were easy accessibility, peer review, multidisciplinary engagement or MDT attendance, and transparent CPG development by trusted, multidisciplinary experts. CPGs provide a reassuring framework for clinicians to check their treatment plans against. Clinicians want cancer CPGs to be frequently updated utilising a wiki-like process, and easily accessible online via a comprehensive database, coordinated by a well-trusted development body.Future implementation strategies of cancer CPGs in Australia should be tailored to consider these context-specific barriers and facilitators, taking into account both the content of CPGs and the communication of that content. The establishment of a centralised, comprehensive, online database, with living wiki-style cancer CPGs, coordinated by a well-funded development body, along with incorporation of recommendations into point-of-care decision support would potentially address many of the issues identified."
https://openalex.org/W4311684229,"Understanding and quantifying inter-joint coordination is valuable in several domains such as neurorehabilitation, robot-assisted therapy, robotic prosthetic arms, and control of supernumerary arms. Inter-joint coordination is often understood as a consistent spatiotemporal relation among kinematically redundant joints performing functional and goal-oriented movements. However, most approaches in the literature to investigate inter-joint coordination are limited to analysis of the end-point trajectory or correlation analysis of the joint rotations without considering the underlying task; e.g., creating a desirable hand movement toward a goal as in reaching motions. This work goes beyond this limitation by taking a model-based approach to quantifying inter-joint coordination. More specifically, we use the weighted pseudo-inverse of the Jacobian matrix and its associated null-space to explain the human kinematics in reaching tasks. We propose a novel algorithm to estimate such Inverse Kinematics weights from observed kinematic data. These estimated weights serve as a quantification for spatial inter-joint coordination; i.e., how costly a redundant joint is in its contribution to creating an end-effector velocity. We apply our estimation algorithm to datasets obtained from two different experiments. In the first experiment, the estimated Inverse Kinematics weights pinpoint how individuals change their Inverse Kinematics strategy when exposed to the viscous field wearing an exoskeleton. The second experiment shows how the resulting Inverse Kinematics weights can quantify a robotic prosthetic arm's contribution (or the level of assistance)."

Although chemotherapy and targeted agents treatment improve median survival and 5-year survival rates, there is only one-third of patients who adhere to treatment protocol until the pause of disease progression. Hezhong granule is a traditional Chinese herbal formula used for mCRC, which has shown good potential in alleviating the adverse effects of chemotherapy, enhancing the effectiveness of chemotherapy, and improving the quality of life. Therefore, the purpose of the study is to further validate the clinical efficacy and safety of the Chinese herbal medicine formula named Hezhong (HZ) in combination with standard chemotherapy and cetuximab (CET) or bevacizumab (BV) for treating mCRC. Methods In this multi-center, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial, 360 eligible mCRC patients who will be randomly assigned to Hezhong or placebo group with a 1: 1 ratio. Participants in the Hezhong group will receive standard chemotherapy and CET or BV plus Hezhong Granule until the pause of disease progression, death, the exhibition of intolerable toxicity, or up to 6 months, while the placebo group will treat with standard chemotherapy and CET or BV plus placebo. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS). The secondary endpoints are overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), safety, quality of life years (QOL), and chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). Expected results The expected results of this trial are to improve the PFS and QOL of patients with mCRC and provide evidence-based recommendations for the treatment of mCRC with traditional Chinese medicine in China. Trial registration The trial has been registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR). The trial registration number was ChiCTR2100041643 ."
https://openalex.org/W4311651321,"The coexistence of diabetes mellitus and hypertension is a worldwide public health problem causing significant morbidity, mortality, and decreased quality of life. Despite the increasing burden of hypertension among patients with DM, data on determinants of hypertension among patients with DM in the Amhara region of Ethiopia is scarce. Hence, this study identified determinants of hypertension among people with diabetes attending chronic disease follow-up clinics in the Amhara region of comprehensive specialized hospitals in Ethiopia.An institutional-based unmatched case-control study was conducted among 470 individuals with diabetes in the Amhara region's comprehensive specialized hospitals (Debre Berhan, Felege Hiwot, and Dessie Comprehensive specialized hospital). A multistage sampling technique was used to select participants for this study. We collected the data using standard questionnaires (short form of international physical activity questionnaire, Morisky medication adherence scale, patient health questionnaire, perceived dietary adherence scale, Oslo social support questionnaire, and alcohol use disorder identification test), physical measurements, and data extraction checklists. A multivariable binary logistic regression was fitted to identify determinants of hypertension, and we presented the findings using an adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI).235 cases and 235 controls participated in this study. The median (IQR) age for the cases was 60 (52-66 = 14), and the mean age (± SD) for the controls was 51.72 (± 12.51). The significant determinants of hypertension with AOR [95% CI] were a lower level of physical activity: 1.82 [1.00, 3.31], depression: 2.00 [1.24, 3.21], family history of hypertension: 2.13 [1.34, 3.37], not having diabetic health education: 1.87 [1.18, 2.96], a longer duration of diabetes: 1.99 [1.05, 3.79], and poor glycemic control: 1.57 [1.01, 2.45].In this study, determinants that increase the risk of hypertension among people with diabetes mellitus were older age, physical inactivity, depression, family history of hypertension, not having diabetic health education, a longer duration of diabetes, and poor glycemic control."
https://openalex.org/W4311651367,"The need to control the sanitary situation during the COVID-19 pandemic has led governments to implement several restrictions with substantial social and economic impacts. We explored people’s trade-offs in terms of their income, life restrictions, education, and poverty in the society, compared to their willingness to avoid deaths. We applied a web-based discrete choice experiment to elicit preferences of the Portuguese citizens for these attributes and computed the marginal rate of substitution in terms of avoided deaths. We recorded 2,191 responses that faced the possibility of having 250 COVID-19 related deaths per day as the worst possible outcome from the choice levels presented. Estimates suggested that individuals would be willing to sacrifice 30% instead of 10% of their income to avoid approximately 47 deaths per day during the first six months of 2021. For the same period, they would also accept 30% of the students’ population to become educationally impaired, instead of 10%, to avoid approximately 25 deaths; a strict lockdown, instead of mild life restrictions, to avoid approximately 24 deaths; and 45% of the population to be in risk of poverty, instead of 25%, to avoid approximately 101 deaths. Our paper shows that avoiding deaths was strongly preferred to the remaining societal impacts; and that being a female, as well as working on site, led individuals to be more averse to such health hazards. Furthermore, we show how a DCE can be used to assess the societal support to decision-making during times of crisis."
https://openalex.org/W4311651498,"In recent years, there has been increasing evidence that several lipid metabolism abnormalities play an important role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. However, it is still unclear which lipid metabolism abnormalities play the most important role in neurodegenerative diseases. Plasma lipid metabolomics (lipidomics) has been shown to be an unbiased method that can be used to explore lipid metabolism abnormalities in neurodegenerative diseases. Plasma lipidomics in neurodegenerative diseases has been performed only in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), and comprehensive studies are needed to clarify the pathogenesis.In this study, we investigated plasma lipids using lipidomics in individuals with neurodegenerative diseases and healthy controls (CNs). Plasma lipidomics was evaluated by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in those with IPD, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), multiple system atrophy (MSA), AD, and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and CNs.The results showed that (1) plasma sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) was significantly lower in all neurodegenerative disease groups (IPD, DLB, MSA, AD, and PSP) than in the CN group. (2) Plasma monohexylceramide (MonCer) and lactosylceramide (LacCer) were significantly higher in all neurodegenerative disease groups (IPD, DLB, MSA, AD, and PSP) than in the CN group. (3) Plasma MonCer levels were significantly positively correlated with plasma LacCer levels in all enrolled groups.S1P, Glucosylceramide (GlcCer), the main component of MonCer, and LacCer are sphingolipids that are biosynthesized from ceramide. Recent studies have suggested that elevated GlcCer and decreased S1P levels in neurons are related to neuronal cell death and that elevated LacCer levels induce neurodegeneration by neuroinflammation. In the present study, we found decreased plasma S1P levels and elevated plasma MonCer and LacCer levels in those with neurodegenerative diseases, which is a new finding indicating the importance of abnormal sphingolipid metabolism in neurodegeneration."
https://openalex.org/W4311684292,"This study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects of moringa isothiocyanate-1 (MIC-1) extracted from seeds of Moringa oleifera Lam. in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation models. MIC-1 decreased nitric oxide production and reduced the expression of pro-inflammatory markers (TNF-α, Ifn-α, IL-1β, IL-6) in C2C12 myoblasts. The daily oral treatment of MIC-1 (80 mg/kg) for three days significantly reduced the expression of pro-inflammatory markers in gastrocnemius muscle tissue of LPS-treated C57BL/6 male mice. Transcriptomic analysis provided further insights into the inhibitory effects of MIC-1 on the LPS-induced inflammation, which suggested that MIC-1 affects inflammation and immunity-related genes in myoblasts and skeletal muscle tissue. MIC-1 inhibited the nuclear accumulation of the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) in the LPS-treated myoblasts. Our data support the hypothesis that the MIC-1’s effects in the muscle cells are mediated through the inhibition of the NF-κB translocation in the nucleus, which, in turn, results in immunomodulating and anti-inflammatory responses at the gene expression levels."
https://openalex.org/W4311684415,"Standard treatment for patients with high-risk neuroblastoma remains multimodal therapy including chemoradiation, surgical resection, and autologous stem cell rescue. Immunotherapy has demonstrated success in treating many types of cancers; however, its use in pediatric solid tumors has been limited by low tumor mutation burdens. Gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRP-R) is overexpressed in numerous malignancies, including poorly-differentiated neuroblastoma. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to GRP-R have yet to be developed but could serve as a potential novel immunotherapy. This preclinical study aims to evaluate the efficacy of a novel GRP-R mAb immunotherapy against neuroblastoma. We established four candidate anti-GRP-R mAbs by screening a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) library. GRP-R mAb-1 demonstrated the highest efficacy with the lowest EC50 at 4.607 ng/ml against GRP-R expressing neuroblastoma cells, blocked the GRP-ligand activation of GRP-R and its downstream PI3K/AKT signaling. This resulted in functional inhibition of cell proliferation and anchorage-independent growth, indicating that mAb-1 has an antagonist inhibitory role on GRP-R. To examine the antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) of GRP-R mAb-1 on neuroblastoma, we co-cultured neuroblastoma cells with natural killer (NK) cells versus GRP-R mAb-1 treatment alone. GRP-R mAb-1 mediated ADCC effects on neuroblastoma cells and induced release of IFNγ by NK cells under co-culture conditions in vitro. The cytotoxic effects of mAb-1 were confirmed with the secretion of cytotoxic granzyme B from NK cells and the reduction of mitotic tumor cells in vivo using a murine tumor xenograft model. In summary, GRP-R mAb-1 demonstrated efficacious anti-tumor effects on neuroblastoma cells in preclinical models. Importantly, GRP-R mAb-1 may be an efficacious, novel immunotherapy in the treatment of high-risk neuroblastoma patients."
https://openalex.org/W4311684417,"Background In Stockholm (Sweden) a substantial number of persons who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 during spring 2020, and received intensive care followed by rehabilitation due to COVID-19, were of working age. For this group, return to work (RTW) is an important part of the rehabilitation, however this is an area that thus far has received little scholarly attention. The Aim of this study was two-fold. First, to descriptively look at self-reported work ability over time using the Work Abilty Index among working age adults who recovered from severe COVID-19, and secondly, to explore experiences and expectations concerning RTW among working age adults who recovered from severe COVID-19. Methods Focus group interviews and qualitative thematic analyses were utilized. In addition, the study populations’ self-reported work ability index was recorded over one year. Findings Qualitative analysis of data resulted in 5 themes: a) Initial experiences after discharge from in-patient rehabilitation, b) Disparate first contact with work, c) Uncertainties about own role in RTW process, d) Working situation for those who had started getting back to work, and e) A need to reprioritize expectations for work in the context of everyday life. There were no statistical differences in work ability index scores between 18 and 52 weeks after discharge from an in-patient rehabilitation unit. Conclusion RTW after COVID-19 can require systematic support for several months as well as be initiated earlier in the rehabilitation process. Further research in the area is needed."
https://openalex.org/W4311691596,"While investigating psychosocial factors on resilience and post-traumatic growth draws attention, research on biological correlates is limited. We investigated the relationship between post-traumatic growth, resilience, post-traumatic stress, and potential biomarkers in female patients with breast cancer (n = 71) from the general surgery or oncology clinics. They completed the Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI), Connor Davidson Psychological Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), Brief Resilience Scale (BRS), PTSD Checklist for DSM-V, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Blood samples were collected for NPY, ALLO, DHEA-S, testosterone, cortisol, and hsCRP levels. The relationship between biochemical parameters and the scales was investigated in the whole patient group and in the subgroup of patients who perceived breast cancer as traumatic. When all the patients were evaluated, hsCRP and depression scores were significantly and positively correlated; and hsCRP, BRS score, and PTGI change in self-perception subscale score were significantly and negatively correlated. There was a significant positive correlation between the ALLO level and the psychological resilience (CD-RISC) score in the patient group who perceived breast cancer as traumatic. It was observed that psychological resilience and PTG were positively correlated, and that multiple biomarkers were associated with psychological resilience in female breast cancer patients. Especially findings regarding ALLO levels and psychological resilience could be a new target for future research."
https://openalex.org/W4311691613,"Elastic knee sleeves are often worn following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. The study aimed to define immediate and 6-week effects of wearing a knee sleeve on ground reaction forces (GRF) and knee joint power during a step-down hop task.Using a cross-over design, we estimated GRF and knee kinematics and kinetics during a step-down hop for 30 participants following ACL reconstruction (median 16 months post-surgery) with and without wearing a knee sleeve. In a subsequent randomised clinical trial, participants in the 'Sleeve Group' (n = 9) wore the sleeve for 6 weeks at least 1 hour daily, while a 'Control Group' (n = 9) did not wear the sleeve. We compared the following outcomes using statistical parametric mapping (SPM): (1) GRF and knee joint power trajectories between three conditions at baseline (uninjured side, unsleeved injured and sleeved injured side); (2) GRF and knee joint power trajectories within-participant changes from baseline to follow-up between groups. We also compared discrete peak GRFs and power, rate of (vertical) force development, and mean knee joint power in the first 5% of stance phase.SPM showed no differences for GRF for the (unsleeved) injured compared to the uninjured sides; when wearing the sleeve, injured side mean power in the first 5% of stance increased significantly from a concentric to an eccentric power. Discrete variables showed lower peak anterior (propulsive) GRF, mean power in the first 5% of stance, peak eccentric and concentric power for the injured compared to the uninjured sides. After six weeks, a directional change for vertical GRF differed showed slightly decreased forces for the Control Group and increased forces for the Sleeve Group.Wearing a knee sleeve on the anterior cruciate ligament injured knee improved knee power during the first 5% of stance during the step-down hop. No consistent changes were observed for ground reaction forces for SPM and discrete variable analyses. Wearing the knee sleeve at least one hour daily for 6-weeks lead to a directional change of increased vertical GRF for the Sleeve Group at follow-up.The trial was prospectively registered with the Australia New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry No: ACTRN12618001083280, 28/06/2018. https: //anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=375347&isClinicalTrial=False."
https://openalex.org/W4311651311,"Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is a monogenic hemoglobinopathy associated with severe acute and chronic complications, with the highest incidence worldwide in Sub-Saharan Africa. The wide variability in clinical manifestations suggest that a uniform response to hydroxurea may not be attained. In view of a potential treatment with hydroxyurea (HU), we assessed the variability of clinical and hematological manifestations in a cohort of adults with SCA in Kinshasa, capital of the DR Congo in Central Africa.A cross-sectional study was conducted in a hospital dedicated to SCA management in Kinshasa. Clinical history of patients was recorded, a complete physical examination performed. The diagnosis was confirmed by means of DNA analysis. A full blood count and hemolysis markers were measured. The severity of the disease was evaluated by means of a previously reported score.The study group consisted of 166 genetically confirmed SCA patients. The SCA severity was mild in 28.9%, moderate in 64.5% and severe in 6.6%. The disease severity score increased with patient's age (p ≤ 0.001). The severity was higher in males compared to females (p = 0.012). In males, the severity score was correlated with the presence of priapism (p = 0.045), a manifestation not previously incorporated in the severity score. The severity score was inversely correlated with the fetal hemoglobin (HbF) rate (p = 0.005). Malnutrition (BMI <18.5 kg/m2) was present in 47% of patients and was related to the male sex, hip disease (aOR 3.11; p = 0.019) and severe phenotype (aOR 3.53; p = 0.012). Leg ulcers were more frequent in males than in females (p = 0.001; OR 24.3) and were correlated with the number of days of hospitalization (p = 0.029). Hip disease was related to the increasing age (p = 0.008).In this selected, hospital-based populations of adults with SCA, severe disease was rare, which may be due to survival bias. However, two thirds had moderate severity of the disease, mostly with a low HbF, and they may benefit from HU treatment. In the Central-African setting the separation between vaso-occlusive and hyperhemolytic sub-phenotypes was not applicable."
https://openalex.org/W4311651313,"The COVID-19 lockdown in Spain caused abrupt changes for students following the Bachelor’s Degree in Civil Engineering at the University of Burgos when face-to-face classes switched to online teaching. The recovery of face-to-face teaching after lockdown meant that classes were taught with obligatory social distancing and the use of masks. Teachers were therefore unable to interact with students closely, to perceive their facial expressions during class, or to conduct group work. The changes to civil-engineering teaching linked to the COVID-19 pandemic and the lessons that civil-engineering teachers learnt from the new teaching scenarios are studied in this paper. The reflections of teachers throughout all three stages of the pandemic (pre-pandemic and lockdown, during lockdown, and post-lockdown), and the qualitative and mixed analysis of their responses to a survey of open-ended questions contributed to the identification of six major lessons: (1) asking questions and using real-time quiz tools enliven classes and help to determine which concepts to emphasize for proper student understanding; (2) autonomous student learning can be promoted through the provision of supplementary documentation and the digitalization of solutions to classroom exercises; (3) virtual site visits and real visual examples interspersed with explanations bring concepts closer to their real applications; (4) the delivery of projects in the form of audio-recorded presentations enable their distribution, so that other students can also learn from them as well as the students who created them; (5) online videoconferences, adapted to the concepts that are addressed, facilitate fast and flexible communication with students; and (6) online continuous-assessment exams can promote better student learning patterns and final-exam preparation. Nevertheless, these six lessons were drawn from the experience of teachers at a small Spanish university where the period of solely online teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic lasted only four months. Thus, it would be interesting to analyze the experience of civil-engineering teachers at larger universities and universities that had longer periods of solely online teaching. A study of the level of implementation of the six aspects when the pandemic is declared over might also be worthwhile."

https://openalex.org/W4311651505,"Quality of life in prostate cancer survivorship is becoming increasingly important, with mental and social wellbeing recognised as key components. However, limited global evaluation of psychosocial challenges experienced after treatment exists. Therefore, we aimed to explore the lived experiences of men who underwent radical treatment, and its psychosocial impact.This qualitative study was conducted using 19 men who had undergone radical treatment (prostatectomy or radiotherapy) for their cancer. Semi-structured interviews were conducted exploring lived experiences of men after treatment. A Structured thematic analysis of collected data was undertaken, with an inductive co-construction of themes through the lens of the biopsychosocial model. Themes generated were considered within a psychological, social, and physical wellbeing framework.An initial knowledge gap meant mental wellbeing was strongly impacted initially leading to a 'Diagnostic Blow and the Search for Clarity'. Doubt over individuals' future resulted in 'An Uncertain Future' in many men. Once treatment was completed a 'Reflective journey' began, with men considering their outcomes and decisions made. Social wellbeing was also impacted with many identifying the 'Emotional Repercussions' on their relationships and the impact their diagnosis had on their partner and family. Many subsequently sought to increase their support through 'The Social Network and Advocacy', while physical changes led to an increased need for 'Social Planning'. Finally, physical wellbeing was highlighted by a continual acknowledgement of the 'Natural process of ageing' leading to a reluctancy to seek help, whilst simultaneously attempting to improve existing health via 'The Health Kick'.Radical treatments have a considerable impact on mental and social wellbeing of individuals. Anxiety after diagnosis and significant uncertainty over individual futures exist, with physical complications of treatment leading to social repercussions. Future research should aim to identify forms of support to improve quality of life of these men."
https://openalex.org/W4311684228,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic has had broad impacts on individuals, families and communities which will continue to require multidimensional responses from service providers, program developers, and policy makers. Objectives The purpose of this study was to use Life Course theory to understand and imagine public health and policy responses to the multiple and varied impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on different groups. Methods “The Cost of COVID-19” was a research study carried out in Kingston, Frontenac, Lennox and Addington counties in South Eastern Ontario, Canada, between June and December 2020. Data included 210 micronarrative stories collected from community members, and 31 in-depth interviews with health and social service providers. Data were analyzed using directed content analysis to explore the fit between data and the constructs of Life Course theory. Results Social pathways were significantly disrupted by changes to education and employment, as well as changes to roles which further altered anticipated pathways. Transitions were by and large missed, creating a sense of loss. While some respondents articulated positive turning points, most of the turning points reported were negative, including fundamental changes to relationships, family structure, education, and employment with lifelong implications. Participants’ trajectories varied based on principles including when they occurred in their lifespan, the amount of agency they felt or did not feel over circumstances, where they lived (rural versus urban), what else was going on in their lives at the time the pandemic struck, how their lives were connected with others, as well as how the pandemic impacted the lives of those dear to them. An additional principle, that of Culture, was felt to be missing from the Life Course theory as currently outlined. Conclusions A Life Course analysis may improve our understanding of the multidimensional long-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated public health countermeasures. This analysis could help us to anticipate services that will require development, training, and funding to support the recovery of those who have been particularly affected. Resources needed will include education, mental health and job creation supports, as well as programs that support the development of individual and community agency."
https://openalex.org/W4311684261,"The nutria ( Myocastor coypus ), also known as the coypu, is a semi-aquatic, invasive rodent native to South America that causes damage to natural riverine and wetland habitats in many parts of the world, including South Korea. Understanding habitat use, connectivity, and gene flow of nutria populations is critical for the sound management of local and regional ecosystems. Here, we assessed habitat suitability and connectivity in relation to the genetic structure of nutria populations in the Nakdong River Basin of South Korea. A total of 321 nutria occurrence sites and seven environmental variables were used to perform ensemble habitat suitability modeling using five species distribution models (SDMs), including boosted regression trees, maximum entropy model, random forest, generalized linear model, and multivariate adaptive regression splines. Using graph and circuit theory approaches, we assessed the population gene flow and current flow betweenness centrality (CFBC) of suitable habitats derived from the ensemble SDM. All SDMs performed well with a range of test AUC values from 0.962 to 0.970 (mean = 0.966) with true skill statistic values over 0.8. The minimum temperature of the coldest month, mean temperature of the warmest quarter, precipitation of the driest quarter, and distance from water bodies were important predictors in nutria habitat modeling. Nutria population gene flow was significantly correlated with the least-cost path distance on a cost resistance surface based on ensemble habitat suitability modeling and roads (Mantel’s r = 0.60, p &lt; 0.05). Finally, the CFBC positively correlated with the genetic diversity of nutria populations was used to identify priority control areas. Habitat suitability and connectivity modeling not only revealed environmental conditions and areas that support the survival and spread of nutrias, but also improved our understanding of the animals’ genetic population structure, thereby indicating priority areas to target for eradication."
https://openalex.org/W4311684286,"Ayahuasca is a blend of Amazonian plants that has been used for traditional medicine by the inhabitants of this region for hundreds of years. Furthermore, this plant has been demonstrated to be a viable therapy for a variety of neurological and mental diseases. EEG experiments have found specific brain regions that changed significantly due to ayahuasca. Here, we used an EEG dataset to investigate the ability to automatically detect changes in brain activity using machine learning and complex networks. Machine learning was applied at three different levels of data abstraction: (A) the raw EEG time series, (B) the correlation of the EEG time series, and (C) the complex network measures calculated from (B). Further, at the abstraction level of (C), we developed new measures of complex networks relating to community detection. As a result, the machine learning method was able to automatically detect changes in brain activity, with case (B) showing the highest accuracy (92%), followed by (A) (88%) and (C) (83%), indicating that connectivity changes between brain regions are more important for the detection of ayahuasca. The most activated areas were the frontal and temporal lobe, which is consistent with the literature. F3 and PO4 were the most important brain connections, a significant new discovery for psychedelic literature. This connection may point to a cognitive process akin to face recognition in individuals during ayahuasca-mediated visual hallucinations. Furthermore, closeness centrality and assortativity were the most important complex network measures. These two measures are also associated with diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, indicating a possible therapeutic mechanism. Moreover, the new measures were crucial to the predictive model and suggested larger brain communities associated with the use of ayahuasca. This suggests that the dissemination of information in functional brain networks is slower when this drug is present. Overall, our methodology was able to automatically detect changes in brain activity during ayahuasca consumption and interpret how these psychedelics alter brain networks, as well as provide insights into their mechanisms of action."
https://openalex.org/W4311684331,"To investigate the risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE) in hospitalized patients with rheumatic diseases in China. The efficacy of the Padua scale was evaluated and an improved model for predicting VTE in hospitalized patients with rheumatic diseases was developed.Records of 2282 patients hospitalized in the department of rheumatology of the Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital were retrospectively reviewed. The risk factors for VTE were analyzed. The efficacy of the Padua scale was evaluated, Padua-combined prediction model and the independent risk factor-combined prediction model for predicting VTE were assessed using the receiver operating curve (ROC).A total of 50 patients in the VTE group and 2232 in the non-VTE group were included. Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), VTE history, a hospital stay of over 3 days, high D-dimer (D-D), and decreased serum albumin were independent risk factors for VTE. APS was very closely associated with VTE (OR = 19.446). Padua scores in the VTE group and the non-VTE group were 3 (2, 6) and 2 (1, 2) points, respectively (p < 0.05), and the proportion of high-risk patients were 48.0% and 7.4%, respectively (p < 0.05). The incidence of VTE in the high-risk (Padua score ≥4) and low-risk (Padua score <4) groups was 12.7% and 1.2%, respectively (p < 0.05). The area under curve (AUC) of the Padua scale, Padua combined prediction model (Padua scale along with D-D and serum albumin), and the independent risk factor-combined prediction model was 0.771, 0.836, and 0.873, respectively.The Padua scale has limited predictive efficacy of VTE in hospitalized rheumatic patients. The independent risk factor-combination prediction model was superior in predicting VTE compared to Padua scale and Padua-combined prediction model."
https://openalex.org/W4311684378,"Seroprevalence studies can contribute to a better assessment of the actual incidence of infection. Since long-term data for Germany are lacking, we determined the seroprevalence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in residual plasma samples of 3,759 German regular blood donors between July 2020 and June 2021. Over almost the entire study period, the incidences determined based on our data were higher than those officially reported by the Robert Koch Institute, the public health institute in Germany. Using our serological testing strategy, we retrospectively detected natural infection in 206/3,759 (5.48%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 4.77–6.25) individuals. The IgG seroprevalence ranked from 5.15% (95% CI: 3.73–6.89) in Lower Saxony to 5.62% (95% CI: 4.57–6.84) in North Rhine Westphalia. The analyses of follow-up samples of 88 seropositive blood donors revealed a comparable fast decay of binding and neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. The antibody avidity remained at a low level throughout the whole follow-up period of up to 181 days. Interestingly, female donors seem to express a stronger and longer lasting humoral immunity against the new coronavirus when compared to males. Conclusion: Overall, our data emphasizes that seroprevalence measurements can and should be used to understand the true incidence of infection better. Further characterization of follow-up samples from seropositive donors indicated rapid antibody waning with sex-specific differences concerning the strength and persistence of humoral immune response."
https://openalex.org/W4311684509,"Numbers of urgent short stay admissions (SSAs) of children to UK hospitals are rising rapidly. This paper reports on experiences of SSAs from the perspective of parents accessing urgent care for their acutely unwell child and of health professionals referring, caring for, or admitting children.A qualitative interview study was conducted by a multi-disciplinary team with patient and public involvement (PPI) to explore contextual factors relating to SSAs and better understand pre-hospital urgent care pathways. Purposive sampling of Health Board areas in Scotland, health professionals with experience of paediatric urgent care pathways and parents with experience of a SSA for their acutely unwell child was undertaken to ensure maximal variation in characteristics such as deprivation, urban-rural and hospital structure. Interviews took place between Dec 2019 and Mar 2021 and thematic framework analysis was applied.Twenty-one parents and forty-eight health professionals were interviewed. In the context of an urgent SSA, the themes were centred around shared outcomes of care that matter. The main outcome which was common to both parents and health professionals was the importance of preserving the child's safety. Additional shared outcomes by parents and health professionals were a desire to reduce worries and uncertainty about the illness trajectory, and provide reassurance with sufficient time, space and personnel to undertake a period of skilled observation to assess and manage the acutely unwell child. Parents wanted easy access to urgent care and, preferably, with input from paediatric-trained staff. Healthcare professionals considered that it was important to reduce the number of children admitted to hospital where safe and appropriate to do so.The shared outcomes of care between parents and health professionals emphasises the potential merit of adopting a partnership approach in identifying, developing and testing interventions to improve the acceptability, safety, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness of urgent care pathways between home and hospital."
https://openalex.org/W4311691554,"The UK Biobank provides a rich collection of longitudinal clinical data coming from different healthcare providers and sources in England, Wales, and Scotland. Although extremely valuable and available to a wide research community, the heterogeneous dataset contains inconsistent medical terminology that is either aligned to several ontologies within the same category or unprocessed. To make these data useful to a research community, data cleaning, curation, and standardization are needed. Significant efforts to perform data reformatting, mapping to any selected ontologies (such as SNOMED-CT) and harmonization are required from any data user to integrate UK Biobank hospital inpatient and self-reported data, data from various registers with primary care (GP) data. The integrated clinical data would provide a more comprehensive picture of one's medical history.We evaluated several approaches to map GP clinical Read codes to International Classification of Diseases (ICD) and Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) terminologies. The results were compared, mapping inconsistencies were flagged, a quality category was assigned to each mapping to evaluate overall mapping quality.We propose a curation and data integration pipeline for harmonizing diagnosis. We also report challenges identified in mapping Read codes from UK Biobank GP tables to ICD and SNOMED CT.Some of the challenges-the lack of precise one-to-one mapping between ontologies or the need for additional ontology to fully map terms-are general reflecting trade-offs to be made at different steps. Other challenges are due to automatic mapping and can be overcome by leveraging existing mappings, supplemented with automated and manual curation."
https://openalex.org/W4311691580,"Graduate admissions committees throughout the United States examine both quantitative and qualitative data from applicants to make admissions determinations. A number of recent studies have examined the ability of commonly used quantitative metrics such as the GRE and undergraduate GPA to predict the likelihood of applicant success in graduate programs. We examined whether an admissions committee could predict applicant success at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center UTHealth Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences based on quantitative metrics. We analyzed the predictive validity of admissions scores, undergraduate GPA, and the GRE for student success. We observed nuanced differences based on gender, ethnicity, race, and citizenship status. The scores assigned to applicants by the admissions committee could not predict time to degree in PhD students regardless of demographic group. Undergraduate GPA was correlated with time to degree in some instances. Interestingly, while GRE scores could predict time to degree, GRE percentile scores could predict both time to degree and PhD candidacy examination results. These findings suggest that there is a level of nuance that is required for interpretation of these quantitative metrics by admissions committees."
https://openalex.org/W4311691638,"Cigarette smoking is disproportionately high among people experiencing homelessness (PEH). Contingency management (CM) is a strategy that has shown considerable efficacy for smoking cessation and has been used in short-term studies of smoking abstinence in PEH. We describe a pilot, pragmatic randomized controlled trial protocol, which leverages an electronic health record (EHR) infrastructure to assess the feasibility and acceptability of an extended CM intervention to improve long-term abstinence in PEH.We will conduct the study at three safety-net clinics in San Francisco among 90 adults experiencing homelessness who smoke cigarettes currently and have a desire to quit. We will encourage all participants to receive smoking cessation services that include behavioral counseling and pharmacotherapy through their clinics. We will randomly assign participants to an extended CM intervention group with escalating incentives contingent on abstinence or to a control group with fixed incentives for attending study visits. We will use the EHR to recruit participants, track receipt of counseling and pharmacotherapy during clinical care, and communicate with providers on participants' progress. CM participants will get escalating incentives for demonstration of carbon monoxide-verified abstinence over 6 months, with a total possible earnings of $475. Control participants will receive a fixed incentive of $5 for attending study visits, totaling $125. We will conduct the carbon-monoxide verified abstinence assessments-which will determine CM incentive amounts-daily during week 1, bi-weekly through week 4, weekly through week 13, and monthly through week 24. Measures of feasibility and acceptability, both quantitative and qualitative, will include assessments of screening and recruitment, adherence to study visits, engagement in smoking cessation clinical care, retention, and participant satisfaction. One of the primary clinical outcomes will be biochemically verified 7-day point prevalence abstinence at 6 months. We will measure secondary outcomes, which will include 7-day point prevalence abstinence at 2 weeks, 3 and 12 months.This trial will allow us to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a CM cessation intervention among PEH. The protocol's clinical setting and use of EHRs gives it significant potential for scalability. If found to be feasible, acceptable, and subsequently efficacious in a larger trial, the intervention could reduce tobacco-related health disparities by increasing long-term smoking abstinence among this vulnerable population.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04982952.

https://openalex.org/W4311691661,"Pygmy Chameleons of the genus Rhampholeon represent a moderately diverse, geographically circumscribed radiation, with most species (18 out of 19 extant taxa) limited to East Africa. The one exception is Rhampholeon spectrum , a species restricted to West-Central African rainforests. We set out to characterize the geographic basis of genetic variation in this disjunctly distributed Rhampholeon species using a combination of multilocus Sanger data and genomic sequences to explore population structure and range-wide phylogeographic patterns. We also employed demographic analyses and niche modeling to distinguish between alternate explanations to contextualize the impact of past geological and climatic events on the present-day distribution of intraspecific genetic variation. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that R . spectrum is a complex of five geographically delimited populations grouped into two major clades (montane vs. lowland). We found pronounced population structure suggesting that divergence and, potentially, speciation began between the late Miocene and the Pleistocene. Sea level changes during the Pleistocene climatic oscillations resulted in allopatric divergence associated with dispersal over an ocean channel barrier and colonization of Bioko Island. Demographic inferences and range stability mapping each support diversification models with secondary contact due to population contraction in lowland and montane refugia during the interglacial period. Allopatric divergence, congruent with isolation caused by geologic uplift of the East African rift system, the “descent into the Icehouse,” and aridification of sub-Saharan Africa during the Eocene-Oligocene are identified as the key events explaining the population divergence between R . spectrum and its closely related sister clade from the Eastern Arc Mountains. Our results unveil cryptic genetic diversity in R . spectrum , suggesting the possibility of a species complex distributed across the Lower Guinean Forest and the Island of Bioko. We highlight the major element of species diversification that modelled today’s diversity and distributions in most West-Central African vertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W4311651325,"Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are considered part of an environmentally friendly technology leading to more timely and cost-effective production and management of farms. Despite the potential of WSNs to agricultural development in the global South, outreach is still very limited, also in Iran. Therefore, in order to facilitate the adoption of WSNs, it is necessary to identify the factors influencing and challenging the adoption of this technology. This exploratory study uses a qualitative approach to identify the main barriers WSN outreach is facing. In the results, we distinguish facts that we define as issues or barriers that were identified by others from fears that are not supported by evidence so far, at the level of the farmers, the government actors as well as the technology itself. Facts include communication barriers such as internet access, farmers' knowledge levels and rigidity to change as well as the government's top-down organisation of the extension programme and support levels. Fears are mainly expressed on the technology itself and relate to costs, a lack of access, the complexity of use and reliability of the data. We provide a nuanced view of how fears need to be acknowledged and facts are to be tackled."

Two consecutive macular 6x6 mm SS-OCTA scans (Plex Elite 9000; Zeiss, Dublin, CA) were obtained from the affected eyes with persistent subretinal fluid (SRF) (CSCR group) and the fellow unaffected eyes (control group). FSV area and the number of contours measurements were analyzed using three slabs: inner CC, outer CC and CH. The repeatability of the measurements was assessed with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and coefficients of variation (CV).In the CSCR group, ICCs for the FSV area in the three slabs were all ≥0.859, observing higher values for the outer CC and the CH (0.959 and 0.964) than for the inner CC (0.859). Similar ICC values were obtained for the FSV area in control eyes, observing the highest values for the outer CC (0.949), followed by the CH (0.932) and inner CC (0.844). Regarding the FSV number of contours measurements, ICCs were higher for the outer CC and CH (0.949 and 0.932) than for inner CC (0.844). CV for the FSV area was 4.7%, 3.8% and 8.6% in the CSCR eyes and 4.8%, 3.9% and 9.3% in the control group for the inner CC, outer CC and CH respectively.SS-OCTA offers good repeatability to quantify macular FSV in CSCR eyes and fellow eyes."
https://openalex.org/W4311651327,"Improved food security and nutrition remain a notable global challenge. Yet, food security and nutrition are areas of strategic importance regarding the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals. The increasingly weakening global food production systems pose a threat to sustainable improved food security and nutrition. Consequently, a significant population remains chronically hungry and severely malnourished. As a remedy, farm production diversity (FPD) remains a viable pathway through which household nutrition can be improved. However, evidence is mixed, or unavailable on how FPD is associated with key nutrition indicators like household dietary diversity, energy, iron, zinc, and vitamin A (micronutrients). We use the Uganda National Panel Survey (UNPS) data for rural households to analyze differential associations of sub-components of FPD on dietary diversity, energy, and micronutrient intake. Panel data models reveal that indeed crop species count, and animal species count (sub-components of FPD) are differently associated with household dietary diversity score (HDDS), energy, and vitamin A sourced from markets. Moreover, when volumes of these nutrition outcomes were disaggregated by source (own farm vs. markets), the animal species count was only positively significantly associated with nutrition outcomes sourced from consumption of produce from own farm. Associations were insignificant for nutrition indicators sourced from markets except vitamin A. The crop species count, however, consistently showed a strong positive and significant association with energy, and all studied micronutrients sourced from own farm produce consumption, as well as those sourced from markets except Vitamin A, which was negative but insignificant. Therefore, inclusive, pro-poor, and pro-nutrition rural policy initiatives in the context of rural Uganda and similar ones, could more widely improve household nutrition through prioritizing crop species diversification on own farms because crops fetch wider nutrition gains."
https://openalex.org/W4311651334,"Accountability is an imperative element of organizations that Human Resource Management establishes as a behavior guideline. It encourages employees to be responsible for decisions and actions they took. Employing Social Cognitive theory, this study aims to investigate the mechanism of how formalization influences employee accountability. We hypothesize that this relationship is mediated by managerial monitoring behavior and perceived competence. Data was collected from 331 employees of a government agency in Indonesia. Structural equation modelling analysis reveals that (1) formalization directly and indirectly influences employee accountability, and its direct effect is higher than its indirect effect, suggesting the importance of formalization system in Human Resource Management; (2) the contribution of perceived competence as a mediator between formalization and employee accountability is higher than the contribution of managerial monitoring behavior, suggesting the importance of micro-foundations of Human Resource research; (3) the relationship between formalization and employee accountability was serially mediated by managerial monitoring behavior, which was preceded by managerial monitoring behavior for task performance and continued by managerial monitoring behavior for interpersonal facilitation This study contributes to international Human Resource Management literature by explaining the mechanism by which formalization affect accountability."
https://openalex.org/W4311651336,"The experience of auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH, “hearing voices”) in schizophrenia has been found to be associated with reduced auditory cortex activation during perception of real auditory stimuli like tones and speech. We re-examined this finding using 46 patients with schizophrenia (23 with frequent AVH and 23 hallucination-free), who underwent fMRI scanning while they heard words, sentences and reversed speech. Twenty-five matched healthy controls were also examined. Perception of words, sentences and reversed speech all elicited activation of the bilateral superior temporal cortex, the inferior and lateral prefrontal cortex, the inferior parietal cortex and the supplementary motor area in the patients and the healthy controls. During the sentence and reversed speech conditions, the schizophrenia patients as a group showed reduced activation in the left primary auditory cortex (Heschl’s gyrus) relative to the healthy controls. No differences were found between the patients with and without hallucinations in any condition. This study therefore fails to support previous findings that experience of AVH attenuates speech-perception-related brain activations in the auditory cortex. At the same time, it suggests that schizophrenia patients, regardless of presence of AVH, show reduced activation in the primary auditory cortex during speech perception, a finding which could reflect an early information processing deficit in the disorder."
https://openalex.org/W4311651360,"Defining demographically independent units and understanding patterns of gene flow between them is essential for managing and conserving exploited populations. The critically endangered scalloped hammerhead shark, Sphyrna lewini , is a coastal semi-oceanic species found worldwide in tropical and subtropical waters. Pregnant females give birth in shallow coastal estuarine habitats that serve as nursery grounds for neonates and small juveniles, whereas adults move offshore and become highly migratory. We evaluated the population structure and connectivity of S . lewini in coastal areas and one oceanic island (Cocos Island) across the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP) using both sequences of the mitochondrial DNA control region (mtCR) and 9 nuclear-encoded microsatellite loci. The mtCR defined two genetically discrete groups: one in the Mexican Pacific and another one in the central-southern Eastern Tropical Pacific (Guatemala, Costa Rica, Panama, and Colombia). Overall, the mtCR data showed low levels of haplotype diversity ranging from 0.000 to 0.608, while nucleotide diversity ranged from 0.000 to 0.0015. More fine-grade population structure was detected using microsatellite loci where Guatemala, Costa Rica, and Panama differed significantly. Relatedness analysis revealed that individuals within nursery areas were more closely related than expected by chance, suggesting that S . lewini may exhibit reproductive philopatric behaviour within the ETP. Findings of at least two different management units, and evidence of philopatric behaviour call for intensive conservation actions for this highly threatened species in the ETP."

The aim of this study was to explore the association of maternal anemia with a range of adverse maternal health and birth outcomes in Bangladesh.A total of 2,259 maternal women data was analyzed, extracted from the 2011 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey. Outcome variables considered were a range of maternal health and birth outcomes. Adverse maternal health outcomes were pregnancy complications, pregnancy termination, menstrual irregularities, cesarean delivery, diabetes, and hypertension. Adverse birth outcomes considered were low birth weight, stillbirths, early neonatal deaths, perinatal deaths, preterm birth, and prolonged labor. The main exposure variable was maternal anemia status. Mixed effect multilevel logistic/poisson regression model was used to determine the association between exposure and outcome variable adjusted for individual-, household-, and community-level factors.The reported prevalence of anemia was 44%. A higher likelihoods pregnancy complication (AOR, 1.39, 95% CI, 1.09-2.41, p<0.05) and lower likelihoods of menstrual irregularities (AOR, 0.79, 95% CI, 0.58-0.94, p<0.05), diabetes (AOR, 0.78, 95% CI, 0.49-0.98, p<0.05) and hypertensive (AOR, 0.79, 95% CI, 0.60-0.96, p<0.05) were found among anemic maternal women as compared to the non-anemic maternal women. Adverse birth outcomes, including preterm birth (AOR, 2.03, 95% CI, 1.01-4.25, p<0.05), early neonatal mortality (AOR, 1.87, 95% CI, 1.06-5.10), and perinatal mortality (AOR, 1.54, 95% CI, 1.09-3.52, p<0.05), were also found higher among newborn of anemic maternal women as compared to the newborn of non-anemic maternal women.Anemia during pregnancy increases the occurrence of adverse maternal health and birth outcomes. Strategies to reduce anemia, such as iron supplementation, during pregnancy and among reproductive-aged women need to be prioritized in the policies and programs."

However, there still lacks robust evidence of imported malaria caused by Plasmodium spp. infected anopheles along international border areas (border-spill malaria). The objectives of this study were to confirm whether an outbreak of Plasmodium vivax malaria is border-spill malaria and assess the effects of China's public health response along China-Myanmar border.Epidemiological, parasitological and entomological investigations were conducted to investigate the outbreak of border-spill malaria. Meanwhile, comprehensive interventions were carried out to prevent further transmission and reintroduction of malaria.Rapid diagnostic testing, microscopy and polymerase chain reaction were performed and the infections were confirmed as P. vivax. A total of 22 (9.21%) of 239 workers contracted P. vivax during the outbreak. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified that the distance of worker shelters in China within 300 meters to the internally displaced person (IDP) camps in Myanmar was a risk factors associated with malaria infection (adjusted odds ratio 7.5920; 95% confidence interval, 2.6079-22.1013; P = 0.0002). After comprehensive interventions, malaria transmission was successfully interpreted and prevented at the project site till the completion of project on 14 January 2020, and recurrence of P. vivax malaria was not detected by the end of 2020.This study provided robust evidence of border-spill malaria along China-Myanmar border. Malaria parasite reservoir and distance travelled by female anopheline mosquitoes are two determinants for border-spill malaria. The public health response to the outbreak indicates that the malaria surveillance and response system works well in preventing reintroduction of malaria. However, prevention of border-spill malaria is still a major challenge in the Yunnan border area, China."

In a cross-sectional study (Study 1, N = 2,822), results showed that past 30 days practice and estimated lifetime number of hours of lovingkindness or compassion meditation were associated with more animal solidarity and greater desire to help animals. Past 30 days practice was also associated with less speciesism, but only when adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics. In an experimental study (Study 2, N = 1,102), results showed that participants randomized to a befriending meditation (a practice similar to loving-kindness and compassion meditation) condition scored higher on animal solidarity and desire to help animals than participants randomized to a control condition. No significant difference was observed on speciesism, but mediation analyses suggested that effects on all three outcomes were mediated through perceived commonality with animals."
https://openalex.org/W4311651448,"Salmonella enterica serovars Typhimurium and Typhi are enteropathogens that differ in host range and the diseases that they cause. We found that exposure to a combination of hypotonicity and the detergent Triton X-100 significantly reduced the viability of the S . Typhi strain Ty2 but had no effect on the S . Typhimurium strain SL1344. Further analysis revealed that hypotonicity was the critical factor: incubation in distilled water alone was sufficient to kill Ty2, while the addition of sodium chloride inhibited killing in a dose-dependent manner. Ty2’s loss of viability in water was modified by culture conditions: bacteria grown in well-aerated shaking cultures were more susceptible than bacteria grown under less aerated static conditions. Ty2, like many S . Typhi clinical isolates, has an inactivating mutation in the rpoS gene, a transcriptional regulator of stress responses, whereas most S . Typhimurium strains, including SL1344, have the wild-type gene. Transformation of Ty2 with a plasmid expressing wild-type rpoS , but not the empty vector, significantly increased survival in distilled water. Moreover, an S . Typhi strain with wild-type rpoS had unimpaired survival in water. Inactivation of the wild-type gene in this strain significantly reduced survival, while replacement with an arabinose-inducible allele of rpoS restored viability in water under inducing conditions. Our observations on rpoS -dependent differences in susceptibility to hypotonic conditions may be relevant to the ability of S . Typhi and S . Typhimurium to tolerate the various environments they encounter during the infectious cycle. They also have implications for the handling of these organisms during experimental manipulations."
https://openalex.org/W4311651504,"The control of Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreaks relies on rapid diagnosis and prompt action, a daunting task in limited-resource contexts. This study develops prediction scores that can help healthcare workers improve their decision-making at the triage-point of EVD suspect-cases during EVD outbreaks.We computed accuracy measurements of EVD predictors to assess their diagnosing ability compared with the reference standard GeneXpert® results, during the eastern DRC EVD outbreak. We developed predictive scores using the Spiegelhalter-Knill-Jones approach and constructed a clinical prediction score (CPS) and an extended clinical prediction score (ECPS). We plotted the receiver operating characteristic curves (ROCs), estimated the area under the ROC (AUROC) to assess the performance of scores, and computed net benefits (NB) to assess the clinical utility (decision-making ability) of the scores at a given cut-off. We performed decision curve analysis (DCA) to compare, at a range of threshold probabilities, prediction scores' decision-making ability and to quantify the number of unnecessary isolation.The analysis was done on data from 10432 subjects, including 651 EVD cases. The EVD prevalence was 6.2% in the whole dataset, 14.8% in the subgroup of suspects who fitted the WHO Ebola case definition, and 3.2% for the set of suspects who did not fit this case definition. The WHO clinical definition yielded 61.6% sensitivity and 76.4% specificity. Fatigue, difficulty in swallowing, red eyes, gingival bleeding, hematemesis, confusion, hemoptysis, and a history of contact with an EVD case were predictors of EVD. The AUROC for ECPS was 0.88 (95%CI: 0.86-0.89), significantly greater than this for CPS, 0.71 (95%CI: 0.69-0.73) (p < 0.0001). At -1 point of score, the CPS yielded a sensitivity of 85.4% and specificity of 42.3%, and the ECPS yielded sensitivity of 78.8% and specificity of 81.4%. The diagnostic performance of the scores varied in the three disease contexts (the whole, fitting or not fitting the WHO case definition data sets). At 10% of threshold probability, e.g. in disease-adverse context, ECPS gave an NB of 0.033 and a net reduction of unnecessary isolation of 67.1%. Using ECPS as a joint approach to isolate EVD suspects reduces the number of unnecessary isolations by 65.7%.The scores developed in our study showed a good performance as EVD case predictors since their use improved the net benefit, i.e., their clinical utility. These rapid and low-cost tools can help in decision-making to isolate EVD-suspicious cases at the triage point during an outbreak. However, these tools still require external validation and cost-effectiveness evaluation before being used on a large scale."
https://openalex.org/W4311651576,"Background: During in-hospital cardiac arrest events, clinical nurses are often the first responders; therefore, nurses require sufficient advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) competency. This study aimed to verify the effects of a hybrid team-based ACLS simulation (HTAS) program (developed in this study) on nurses’ ACLS performance, specifically ACLS knowledge, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) self-efficacy, and CPR-related stress. Methods: The developed HTAS comprised four lecture videos, one team-based skills training video, and a team-based ACLS simulation. A quasi-experimental pretest-posttest design with a comparison group (CG) was used to evaluate the effectiveness of the HTAS. Of the 226 general ward nurses with more than 6 months of clinical experience, 117 were allocated to the intervention group (IG), which attended the HTAS, and 109 to the CG, which attended only basic ACLS training. Results: The IG’s ACLS performance significantly improved (t = 50.8, p &lt; 0.001) after the training. Relative to the respective pretest conditions, posttest ACLS knowledge (t = 6.92, p &lt; 0.001) and CPR self-efficacy (t = 6.97, p &lt; 0.001) of the IG also significantly increased. However, when the mean difference values were compared, there was no significant difference between the two groups with respect to ACLS knowledge (t = 1.52, p = 0.130), CPR self-efficacy (t = -0.42, p = 0.673), and CPR stress (t = -0.88, p = 0.378). Conclusion: The HTAS for ward nurses was effective at enhancing the nurses’ ACLS performance. It is necessary to develop effective training methods for team-based ACLS and verify the sustained effects of such training."
https://openalex.org/W4311651585,"Frequent transfer of rural labor to cities in developing countries significantly impacts agricultural production. However, whether off-farm employment can promote chemical fertilizer (CF) reduction is still controversial. This study incorporates business scale (BS) and fragmentation degree of arable land (FDAL) into the theoretical analysis framework, shedding light on regulating effects of arable land resource endowment in the process of off-farm employment which influences CF application under different BS and FDAL scenarios. It also empirically tests the theoretical framework by employing the survey data of 318 rice farmers in Jilin Province. The results indicate that: (1) off-farm employment, in general, promotes the adoption behavior of machinery by farmers, and mechanical tillage can significantly reduce the intensity of CF application. (2) If farmers have large BS and non-dispersed farmland parcels, contiguous cultivation will meet the scale threshold for mechanical farming and obtain economies of scale to reduce the intensity of CF application. (3) If farmers have small BS and dispersed farmland parcels, the scale threshold of mechanical farming cannot be met. In order to stabilize agricultural production, farmers will increase the intensity of CF application. According to the empirical results, we put forward some suggestions."
https://openalex.org/W4311684314,"Important decisions about risk occur in wide-ranging contexts, from investing to healthcare. While an underlying, domain-general risk attitude has been identified across contexts, it remains unclear what role it plays in shaping behavior relative to more domain-specific risk attitudes. Clarifying the relationship between domain-general and domain-specific risk attitudes would inform decision-making theories and the construction of decision aids. The present research assessed the relative contribution of domain-general and domain-specific risk attitudes to financial risk taking. We examined risk attitudes across different decision domains, as revealed through a well-validated measure, the Domain-Specific Risk-Taking Scale (DOSPERT). Confirmatory factor analysis indicated that a domain-general risk attitude shaped responses across multiple domains, and structural equation modeling showed that this domain-general risk attitude predicted observed behavioral risk premiums in a financial decision-making task better than domain-specific financial risk attitudes. Thus, assessments of risk attitudes that include both economic and non-economic domains improve predictions of financial risk taking due to the enhanced insight they provide into underlying, domain-general risk preferences."
https://openalex.org/W4311684328,"Plasmids are important genetic elements that facilitate horizonal gene transfer between bacteria and contribute to the spread of virulence and antimicrobial resistance. Most bacterial genome sequences in the public archives exist in draft form with many contigs, making it difficult to determine if a contig is of chromosomal or plasmid origin. Using a training set of contigs comprising 10,584 chromosomes and 10,654 plasmids from the PATRIC database, we evaluated several machine learning models including random forest, logistic regression, XGBoost, and a neural network for their ability to classify chromosomal and plasmid sequences using nucleotide k-mers as features. Based on the methods tested, a neural network model that used nucleotide 6-mers as features that was trained on randomly selected chromosomal and plasmid subsequences 5kb in length achieved the best performance, outperforming existing out-of-the-box methods, with an average accuracy of 89.38% ± 2.16% over a 10-fold cross validation. The model accuracy can be improved to 92.08% by using a voting strategy when classifying holdout sequences. In both plasmids and chromosomes, subsequences encoding functions involved in horizontal gene transfer-including hypothetical proteins, transporters, phage, mobile elements, and CRISPR elements-were most likely to be misclassified by the model. This study provides a straightforward approach for identifying plasmid-encoding sequences in short read assemblies without the need for sequence alignment-based tools."
https://openalex.org/W4311684344,"Background/Objectives This study examined the correlation between pancreatic microbiome and patients characteristics. Furthermore, we compared different duodenal materials to examine their reflection of the pancreatic microbiome. Methods Patients undergoing pancreatic surgery were included in the study. Characteristics of those patients were prospectively registered and sterile pancreatic biopsies were collected during surgery. After completion of the resection, duodenal fluid, -tissue and -swab were collected. Bacterial DNA was extracted and analyzed with IS-pro assay. Results Paired samples of 51 patients were available for evaluation, including pancreatic biopsies from all patients, 22 duodenal fluids, 21 duodenal swabs and 11 duodenal tissues. The pancreatic microbiome consisted mostly of Proteobacteria followed by Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Fusobacteria and Verrucomicrobia (FAFV) and Bacteroidetes. On species level, Enterococcus faecalis , Escherichia coli , and Enterobacter-Klebsiella were most abundant. In pancreatic biopsies, the total bacterial load and Proteobacteria load were significantly higher in patients with biliary drainage (54618.0 vs 5623.5; 9119.0 vs 2067.1). Patients who used proton pump inhibitors had a significantly higher total bacterial load (115964.7 vs 8495.8), more FAFV (66862.9 vs 1890.1), more Proteobacteria (24245.9 vs 2951.4) and more Bacteroidetes (542.5 vs 25.8). The head of the pancreas contained significantly more bacteria (21193.4 vs 2096.8) and more FAFV (5225.7 vs 19.0) compared to the tail, regardless of biliary drainage. Furthermore, the microbiome of all duodenal materials showed a weak correlation with the pancreatic microbiome. Conclusion Biliary drainage, use of proton pump inhibitors, and anatomic location of the pancreatic biopsy influence the pancreatic microbiome. Furthermore, the duodenal microbiome does not suffice as a surrogate for the pancreatic microbiome."

Within pituitary gland it acts as autocrine and paracrine signal. In a current study we assessed expression profile of the different subunits of nicotinic as well as muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in RC-4BC cells, which are derived from rat pituitary gland tumor. Our findings indicate that β2, δ, and M2 subunits are expressed by the cells with the lowest Ct values compared to other tested subunits. The detected Ct values were 26.6±0.16, 27.95±0.5, and 28.8±0.25 for β2, δ, and M2 subunits, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W4311691497,"Trust and distrust are considered as crucial elements in the management of hybrid interorganisational relationships with a view to helping to deal with their uncertainty and unpredictability. In this regard this paper seeks to conceptualize and clarify the interorganisational element of organizational trust and distrust and develop scales on which to measure it. The dimensions of the constructs have been tested on a sample of 400 respondents owners or top management on a representative sample by employment size. The research also attempts to identify the relationship between trust and distrust in inter-organisational relations. As a result of the research approach adopted, a one-dimensional scale for examining inter-organisational trust has been developed, as well as a two-dimensional scale for examining distrust in inter-organisational relations. The measurement scales developed and their validation conducted in this study represent a step forward towards the effective and reliable measurement of interorganisational trust and distrust. This is one of the few attempts at empirical verification of these constructs and the relationship between them, providing a comprehensive, operationally valid measure of interorganisational trust and distrust."
https://openalex.org/W4311691555,"Background We have had 3 coronavirus-related pandemics in the last two decades. Each has brought significant toll and with each case there was no cure. Even as vaccines have been developed for the current strain of the virus thereby increasing the prospects of bringing transmissions in communities to a minimum, lessons from this pandemic should be explored in preparation for future pandemics. Other studies have looked at differences in characteristics of patients and mortality rates between the first two waves. In our study we not only identify the differences in outcomes but also explore differences in hospital specific interventions that were implemented at Jersey City Medical Center, NJ, a community-based hospital. Aim The aim of this study is to assess the differences between the first two waves of the COVID -19 pandemic in terms of management and outcomes to help identify any key lessons in the handling of future pandemics. We compared the population demographics, interventions and outcomes used during the first two waves of COVID-19 in a community-based hospital. Methods This is a retrospective single-center cross-sectional study including Laboratory confirmed COVID-19 patients requiring oxygen supplementation admitted at Jersey City Medical Center during the first wave (April 1 to June 30, 2020) and the second wave between (October 1, 2020, and January 1, 2021). The Chi-squared test was used to assess the relationship between categorical variables and the T- test for continuous variables. A Logistic regression model was built comparing the second to the first wave while accounting for important covariates. Results There was a combined total of 473 patients from both waves. Patients in the first wave were older (66.17 years vs 60.38 years, p &lt;0.01), had more comorbidities (2.75 vs 2.29, p 0.003), had more severe disease (50% vs 38.78% p of 0.002), had a longer length of stay (14.18 days vs 8.77 days, p &lt;0.001) and were more likely to be intubated (32.49% vs 21.9 4%, p 0.01). In the univariate model, the odds of mortality in the second wave compared to the first wave was 0.63 (CI, 0.41–0.96) and 1.73 (CI, 0.65–4.66) in the fully adjusted model. Conclusion Overall, there was no statistically significant difference in mortality between the two waves. Interventions that were noted to be significantly different between the two waves were, increased likelihood of mechanical intubation in the first wave and increased use of steroids in the second wave compared to the first."
https://openalex.org/W4311691567,"Background Understanding patients’ perspective to get an insight into cancer, and how best the public health systems can battle with this disease is the way forward in this current world. This study aimed to explore patients’ knowledge about common cancers, barriers to assessing cancer information and cancer preventative approaches in Fiji. Methods The study used a qualitative method approach that was conducted among patients who attended Special Outpatients (SOPD) at the four selected health centres in Lautoka Subdivision, Fiji from 1 st March to 30 th April 2021. A semi-structured open-ended questionnaire was used to guide in-depth interviews. These audio recordings were transcribed and analysed using thematic analysis. All interview transcripts were read and similar words and phrases were assigned numbers which were grouped together to identify themes and sub themes. Results Twenty-eight patients took part in the in-depth interview and the responses were grouped into four themes including; cancer knowledge, diagnosis of cancer in a close friend/family, barriers of communication and optimizing cancer awareness. Patients’ awareness about common cancers and cancer risk factors was low. Many barriers for cancer screening were highlighted including stigmatization, fear, worry, death, lack of information, herbal medicine use, lack of resources and delay in diagnosis. Awareness strategies highlighted by participants included community outreach programs, house to house visits, opportunistic screening, engagement of community health care workers and the concept of a cancer hub centre. Conclusion It is evident that there is a range of views from patients towards cancer and it is important to understand these perceptions to better guide public health interventions concerning cancer. This puts more focus on the need to invest more in information, education, and communication material for public campaigns that target a variety of people for a wider reach."
