https://openalex.org/W2037653131,"Reduced TOR signaling has been shown to significantly increase lifespan in a variety of organisms [1], [2], [3], [4]. It was recently demonstrated that long-term treatment with rapamycin, an inhibitor of the mTOR pathway[5], or ablation of the mTOR target p70S6K[6] extends lifespan in mice, possibly by delaying aging. Whether inhibition of the mTOR pathway would delay or prevent age-associated disease such as AD remained to be determined.We used rapamycin administration and behavioral tools in a mouse model of AD as well as standard biochemical and immunohistochemical measures in brain tissue to provide answers for this question. Here we show that long-term inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin prevented AD-like cognitive deficits and lowered levels of Abeta(42), a major toxic species in AD[7], in the PDAPP transgenic mouse model. These data indicate that inhibition of the mTOR pathway can reduce Abeta(42) levels in vivo and block or delay AD in mice. As expected from the inhibition of mTOR, autophagy was increased in neurons of rapamycin-treated transgenic, but not in non-transgenic, PDAPP mice, suggesting that the reduction in Abeta and the improvement in cognitive function are due in part to increased autophagy, possibly as a response to high levels of Abeta.Our data suggest that inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin, an intervention that extends lifespan in mice, can slow or block AD progression in a transgenic mouse model of the disease. Rapamycin, already used in clinical settings, may be a potentially effective therapeutic agent for the treatment of AD."

The activity of Nrf2 is regulated by the Cul3 adaptor Keap1, yet little is known regarding mechanisms of regulation of Keap1 itself. Here, we have used immunopurification of Keap1 and mass spectrometry, in addition to immunoblotting, to identify sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1) as a cellular binding partner of Keap1. SQSTM1 serves as a scaffold in various signaling pathways and shuttles polyubiquitinated proteins to the proteasomal and lysosomal degradation machineries. Ectopic expression of SQSTM1 led to a decrease in the basal protein level of Keap1 in a panel of cells. Furthermore, RNA interference (RNAi) depletion of SQSTM1 resulted in an increase in the protein level of Keap1 and a concomitant decrease in the protein level of Nrf2 in the absence of changes in Keap1 or Nrf2 mRNA levels. The increased protein level of Keap1 in cells depleted of SQSTM1 by RNAi was linked to a decrease in its rate of degradation; the half-life of Keap1 was almost doubled by RNAi depletion of SQSTM1. The decreased level of Nrf2 in cells depleted of SQSTM1 by RNAi was associated with decreases in the mRNA levels, protein levels, and function of several Nrf2-regulated cell defense genes. SQSTM1 was dispensable for the induction of the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway, as Nrf2 activation by tert-butylhydroquinone or iodoacetamide was not affected by RNAi depletion of SQSTM1. These findings demonstrate a physical and functional interaction between Keap1 and SQSTM1 and reveal an additional layer of regulation in the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway.

These findings demonstrate a physical and functional interaction between Keap1 and SQSTM1 and reveal an additional layer of regulation in the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway. Mammalian cells have evolved a multifaceted and highly regulated defense system to guard against the deleterious effects of chemical/oxidative stress. At the forefront of this system is the transcription factor Nrf2, which serves as a master regulator of the basal and inducible expression of an array of detoxification and antioxidant enzymes, through its action on the cis-acting antioxidant (or electrophile) response element regulatory motif (1Copple I.M. Goldring C.E. Kitteringham N.R. Park B.K. Toxicology. 2008; 246: 24-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The important role of Nrf2 in directing this layer of cell defense has been emphasized in various studies that have demonstrated an increased susceptibility to xenobiotic-induced toxicity in Nrf2 knock-out animals (2Chan K. Han X.D. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 4611-4616Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, 3Rangasamy T. Cho C.Y. Thimmulappa R.K. Zhen L. Srisuma S.S. Kensler T.W. Yamamoto M.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 3410-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). In the absence of chemical/oxidative stress, the activity of Nrf2 is repressed by Keap1, a cysteine-rich protein that acts as a substrate adaptor for the cullin 3-dependent ubiquitination of Nrf2, thereby directing the transcription factor for proteasomal degradation (5Cullinan S.B.

The “hinge and latch” model of Nrf2 regulation proposes that two distinct binding sites in Nrf2 facilitate the interaction with a Keap1 dimer (8Tong K.I. Kobayashi A. Katsuoka F. Yamamoto M. Biol. Chem. 2006; 387: 1311-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Binding to one molecule of Keap1 via the high affinity 79ETGE82 motif within the Neh2 domain of Nrf2 provides the “hinge” through which the transcription factor can move in space relatively freely. Concomitant binding to a second Keap1 molecule via the lower affinity 29DLG31 motif, also located within the Neh2 domain of Nrf2, provides the “latch” that tightly restricts Nrf2 to enable optimal positioning of target lysines for conjugation with ubiquitin (8Tong K.I. Kobayashi A. Katsuoka F. Yamamoto M. Biol. Chem. 2006; 387: 1311-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Keap1 is able to “sense” chemical/oxidative stress at least partly via the modification of a subset of its numerous cysteine residues (9Dinkova-Kostova A.T. Holtzclaw W.D. Cole R.N. Itoh K.

Pharmacol. 2010; 244: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), although phosphorylation of Nrf2 may also play a role in determining the activity of this pathway (1Copple I.M. Goldring C.E. Kitteringham N.R. Park B.K. Toxicology. 2008; 246: 24-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The modification of cysteine residues within Keap1 is postulated to cause a conformational change in the protein that disrupts the interaction between Keap1 and the low affinity 29DLG31 motif within Nrf2, perturbing the ability of Keap1 to direct the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of the transcription factor (8Tong K.I. Kobayashi A. Katsuoka F. Yamamoto M. Biol. Chem. 2006; 387: 1311-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Hence, Keap1 becomes saturated with Nrf2 that cannot be efficiently degraded, and thus newly synthesized Nrf2 is free to accumulate within the nucleus and transactivate antioxidant (or electrophile) response element-driven cytoprotective genes (8Tong K.I. Kobayashi A. Katsuoka F. Yamamoto M. Biol. Chem. 2006; 387: 1311-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Although Nrf2 is the only known substrate of Keap1, the latter has been reported to associate with several other proteins in mammalian cells (7Zhang D.D. Lo S.C. Cross J.V. Templeton D.J. Hannink M.

In this study, we have used immunopurification of Keap1 and liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) 3The abbreviations used are: LC-ESI-MS/MSliquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometrysiRNAshort interfering RNARTreverse transcriptionGCLCglutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunitGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseIKKβinhibitor of κB kinase βNF-κBnuclear factor κB. to enable the identification of additional proteins that associate with Keap1 in the cellular milieu. As well as confirming the identity of some Keap1-interacting proteins already documented in the literature, this approach has identified the multifunctional protein sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1, also known as p62) (18Seibenhener M.L.

Furthermore, evidence is provided to support the concept that SQSTM1 serves an important function in regulating the degradation of Keap1 and thus the integrity of the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway.

Unless noted, all reagents were from Sigma-Aldrich. All cells were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cambrex, Nottingham, UK) supplemented with 584 mg/liter l-glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum (Biowest, Nuaillé, France), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Nrf2 stabilization was induced by exposure of cells to 50 μm iodoacetamide or tert-butylhydroquinone for 1 h. To determine the half-life of Keap1, de novo protein synthesis was inhibited by exposure of cells to 35 μm cycloheximide for up to 16 h. The full-length coding sequence of human Keap1 (Mammalian Gene Collection, IMAGE 1083678) was cloned without the stop codon and inserted into the TOPO cloning site of pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO (Invitrogen). The human SQSTM1-FLAG/His constructs have been described previously (19Najat D. Garner T. Hagen T. Shaw B. Sheppard P.W. Falchetti A. Marini F. Brandi M.L. Long J.E. Cavey J.R. Searle M.S. Layfield R. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2009; 24: 632-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). HEK293T or HeLa cells were transfected for 24 h with the appropriate constructs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer. Clarified lysates were incubated with anti-V5 or anti-FLAG antibody-conjugated agarose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. For Western blotting, beads were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, reconstituted in NuPAGE sample loading buffer (containing 30% (v/v) NuPAGE reducing agent; Invitrogen), and heated at 80 °C for 10 min to elute immunopurified proteins. Following anti-V5 immunopurification of clarified cell lysates, bead-bound Keap1-V5/His was washed in phosphate buffer (67.3 mm Na2HPO4, 13.1 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4) and incubated with 1 mm dithiothreitol for 15 min. Following several more washes, Keap1-V5/His was incubated with 20 mmN-ethylmaleimide for 15 min. All incubations were at 4 °C. Keap1-V5/His was digested with 400 ng of trypsin (Promega) overnight at 37 °C, and the resulting peptides were analyzed by LC-ESI-MS/MS. Samples were delivered into an API QSTAR Pulsar i system (Applied Biosystems) by automated in-line chromatography, using an integrated LCPackings System and 75-μm × 15-cm C18 PepMap column (Dionex, Camberley, UK), via a nanoelectrospray source head and 10-μm inner diameter PicoTip (New Objective, Woburn, MA). The LC conditions were: 5% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.05% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid for 15 min, 5–48% acetonitrile, 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid over 60 min, 99% acetonitrile, 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid for 10 min, 5% acetonitrile, 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid for 10 min, with a flow rate of 0.35 μl/min throughout. MS and MS/MS spectra were acquired automatically in positive ion mode using information-dependent acquisition powered by Analyst QS software (Applied Biosystems). The three most intense ions in each MS spectrum were subjected to MS/MS analysis for 2 s and subsequently excluded from further analysis for 40 s. Proteins present in the immunopurified fraction were identified with ProteinPilot software version 3.0 (Applied Biosystems) using the ParagonTM algorithm (20Shilov I.V. Seymour S.L. Patel A.A.

Protein identifications were accepted if they fell within the 5% local false discovery rate, determined by searching against the reversed SwissProt data base, and if at least two peptides were identified with a confidence >95%. The mass accuracy of each peptide ion was determined at 5–30 ppm. Endogenous SQSTM1 was immunoprecipitated from HEK293T cells, which were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer. The lysate was precleared by incubation with protein A-Sepharose 4B for 1 h at 4 °C. The precleared lysate was then divided equally and incubated for 2 h with or without 2 μg of a rabbit anti-human SQSTM1 antibody (Sigma-Aldrich). The lysates were then supplemented with protein A-Sepharose 4B and incubated for a further 1 h. The beads were washed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer followed by phosphate-buffered saline, reconstituted in NuPAGE sample loading buffer, and heated at 80 °C for 10 min to elute immunoprecipitated proteins. Short interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes targeted against human SQSTM1 (D-010230-03, subsequently referred to as si-SQSTM1 h3), mouse SQSTM1 (D-047628-03 and D-047628-04, subsequently referred to as si-SQSTM1 m3 and m4, respectively), and a scrambled nontargeting control siRNA duplex (D-001210-03, subsequently referred to as si-CON), were purchased from the Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO) siGENOME library. Cells were transfected with 10 nm siRNA using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Hepa-1c1c7 cells were seeded onto Lab-TEK II chamber slides (Nalge Nunc, Rochester, NY) and transfected with siRNA for 48 h. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for 30 min. Fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, quenched with 100 mm glycine, and blocked with 10% fetal bovine serum, for 10 min each. Cells were then incubated with an anti-SQSTM1 antibody (1:500) in 2% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C for 1 h. Following repeated washes in phosphate-buffered saline, cells were incubated with an anti-rabbit IgG fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate (Sigma-Aldrich) in 2% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C for 1 h. Cells were then washed repeatedly, and nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33258 (2 μg/ml; Invitrogen) in phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature for 10 min. Immunofluorescence was visualized using a Leica SP2 AOBS confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Milton Keynes, UK). Multiple fields were evaluated for each condition (representative fields are presented). Cells were transfected with expression constructs for 48 h or siRNA for 48 or 72 h, and lysates were prepared and analyzed by Western blotting as described previously (11Copple I.M. Goldring C.E. Jenkins R.E. Chia A.J. Randle L.E. Hayes J.D. Kitteringham N.R. Park B.K. Hepatology. 2008; 48: 1292-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). SQSTM1 was probed with a rabbit anti-human SQSTM1 antibody for 1 h at 1:10,000 in Tris-buffered saline-Tween containing 2% nonfat dry milk (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Immunoreactive band volumes were quantified using TotalLab 100 software (Nonlinear Dynamics, Newcastle, UK) and normalized to β-actin, which was probed as a loading control. Hepa-1c1c7 cells were transfected with siRNA for 48 h, and total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was synthesized using the ImProm-II reverse transcription system (Promega). The levels of Nrf2, Keap1, heme oxygenase 1, glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC) and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 gene expression were determined using 50 ng of cDNA and SYBR Green JumpStart Taq Ready Mix, using GAPDH as an internal standard for normalization. Gene-specific primers (supplemental Table 1) were synthesized by Sigma-Aldrich. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed on an ABI PRISM 7000 Sequence Detection system (Applied Biosystems). Samples prepared without reverse transcriptase, which produced negligible signals, served as negative controls. Hepa-1c1c7 cells were transfected with siRNA for 72 h, and total cellular glutathione (GSH) content was quantified as previously described (11Copple I.M. Goldring C.E. Jenkins R.E. Chia A.J. Randle L.E. Hayes J.D. Kitteringham N.R. Park B.K. Hepatology. 2008; 48: 1292-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Data are expressed as mean ± S.D. of the mean from at least three independent experiments. The significance of differences within the data were assessed by one-way analysis of variance (with Tukey's post test) or Kruskal-Wallis (with Conover-Inman post test). A two-sided p value of ≤0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Previously, we used LC-ESI-MS/MS to identify the cysteine residues in mouse Keap1-V5/His that are selectively modified by a panel of Nrf2-activating molecules in HEK293T cells (11Copple I.M. Goldring C.E. Jenkins R.E. Chia A.J. Randle L.E. Hayes J.D. Kitteringham N.R. Park B.K. Hepatology. 2008; 48: 1292-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). During the course of this investigation, we noted that the multifunctional protein SQSTM1 was consistently identified as being present in the pulldown fraction alongside Keap1-V5/His (Fig. 1A and supplemental Tables 2 and 3). This raised the possibility that SQSTM1 was a binding partner of Keap1. To confirm the association of Keap1 with SQSTM1, we expressed human Keap1-V5/His or SQSTM1-FLAG/His in HEK293T or HeLa cells and subjected cell lysates to anti-V5 or anti-FLAG pulldown followed by immunoblotting for Keap1 or SQSTM1. In both cell lines, endogenous SQSTM1 was only present in the anti-V5 pulldowns when Keap1-V5/His was expressed in cells (Fig. 1B). In the reverse experiment, endogenous Keap1 was only present in the anti-FLAG pulldowns when SQSTM1-FLAG/His was expressed in cells (Fig. 1B). Importantly, a ΔUBA SQSTM1-FLAG/His mutant lacking the ubiquitin-associated domain was also capable of binding endogenous Keap1 in HEK293T and HeLa cells (Fig. 1B), demonstrating that the interaction between Keap1 and SQSTM1 was not dependent on the presence of the ubiquitin-associated domain of SQSTM1 and implying that the ubiquitination of Keap1 is not required for its association with SQSTM1. To verify that Keap1 and SQSTM1 interact under physiological conditions, endogenous SQSTM1 was immunoprecipitated from HEK293T cells. Endogenous Keap1 was identified as a co-precipitating protein (Fig. 1C), demonstrating that SQSTM1 is a binding partner of Keap1 under physiological conditions. To investigate the biological significance of the interaction between Keap1 and SQSTM1, we examined the effect on Keap1 of depleting endogenous SQSTM1, using siRNA, or ectopically expressing SQSTM1-FLAG/His in a panel of human cell lines originating from discrete organs. In HeLa (cervical adenocarcinoma), HEK293T (kidney), HepG2 (hepatocellular carcinoma), Huh-7 (hepatocellular carcinoma), and CFPAC-1 (pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma) cells, depletion of SQSTM1 with si-SQSTM1 h3 consistently resulted in a increase in the basal protein level of Keap1 (Fig. 2A). Conversely, ectopic expression of SQSTM1-FLAG/His in HeLa, HEK293T, and HepG2 cells consistently caused a decrease in the basal protein level of Keap1 (Fig. 2B). We were unable to express SQSTM1-FLAG/His in Huh-7 or CFPAC-1 cells. To explore further the biological consequences of siRNA depletion of SQSTM1 on the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway, mouse Hepa-1c1c7 cells were transfected with si-SQSTM1 m3 (Fig. 3A) or m4. In these cells, si-SQSTM1 m3 and m4 caused a 7.2- and 9.2-fold increase, respectively, in the basal protein level of Keap1 (Fig. 3B). Concurrently, depletion of SQSTM1 with si-SQSTM1 m3 and m4 resulted in an 89 and 71% decrease, respectively, in the basal protein level of Nrf2 (Fig. 3B). The changes in basal Keap1 and Nrf2 protein levels were not due to the altered transcription of the respective genes because siRNA depletion of SQSTM1 did not significantly affect the mRNA levels of Keap1 or Nrf2 in Hepa-1c1c7 cells (Fig. 3C). These results indicate that SQSTM1 regulates the integrity of the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway in a posttranscriptional manner. To explore the biochemical mechanisms underpinning the changes in Keap1 and Nrf2 protein levels upon manipulation of SQSTM1, Hepa-1c1c7 cells were transfected with si-CON or si-SQSTM1 m3 and then exposed to the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide for up to 16 h. In si-CON-transfected cells, the half-life of Keap1 was 11.3 h (Fig. 3D). In si-SQSTM1-transfected cells, however, the half-life of Keap1 almost doubled to 21.1 h (Fig. 3D), indicating that siRNA depletion of SQSTM1 causes an increase in the basal protein level of Keap1 by slowing its rate of degradation. Notably, the reduction in the basal level of Nrf2 upon siRNA depletion of SQSTM1 did not compromise the inducibility of the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway, as demonstrated by the marked accumulation of Nrf2 in both si-CON and si-SQSTM1 m3-transfected Hepa-1c1c7 cells exposed to iodoacetamide or tert-butylhydroquinone for 1 h (Fig. 3E). These results indicate that SQSTM1 can influence the basal level of Keap1 by regulating its degradation and therefore contribute to the integrity of the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway. However, SQSTM1 appears to be dispensable for the induction of Nrf2. Given that siRNA depletion of SQSTM1 resulted in a decrease in the basal protein level of Nrf2, we hypothesized that this would correspond to a decrease in the capacity of Nrf2-regulated cell defense processes. In Hepa-1c1c7 cells transfected with si-SQSTM1 m3 and m4, the basal mRNA level of three Nrf2-regulated genes, heme oxygenase 1, GCLC, and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1, was reduced significantly, between 37 and 61% compared with si-CON-transfected cells (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, the basal protein level of GCLC was decreased by 39 and 41% in cells transfected with si-SQSTM1 m3 and m4, respectively (Fig. 4B). In keeping with its role as the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of GSH, the functional significance of the decrease in basal mRNA and protein level of GCLC through depletion of SQSTM1 was demonstrated by the 17 and 16% decrease in the basal level of GSH in cells transfected with si-SQSTM1 m3 and m4, respectively (Fig. 4C). These results further indicate that SQSTM1 regulates the basal activity of the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway and thus contributes to the capacity of a cell to defend itself against chemical/oxidative stress. In this study, we have shown that SQSTM1, whose major functions include (i) serving as a scaffold in various signaling pathways through its multiple protein-protein interaction motifs, (ii) sequestering damaged and misfolded proteins into aggregates prior to their degradation, and (iii) shuttling polyubiquitinated proteins to the proteasomal and lysosomal degradation machineries (18Seibenhener M.L. Geetha T. Wooten M.W. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), interacts both physically and functionally with Keap1, the negative regulator of the cytoprotective transcription factor Nrf2. In doing so, we have provided evidence that SQSTM1 can control the integrity of the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway, by regulating the degradation of Keap1 and, consequently, the basal activity of Nrf2. To our knowledge, this provides the first evidence for a post-translational mechanism regulating the basal activity of Keap1. In addition to Nrf2, Keap1 has been reported to associate with several other proteins in mammalian cells. For example, Keap1 associates with PGAM5, which reportedly tethers Keap1 and Nrf2 to the outer membrane of the mitochondria (16Lo S.C. Hannink M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37893-37903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 17Lo S.C. Hannink M. Exp. Cell Res. 2008; 314: 1789-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), implying that the Keap1·Nrf2 complex may be well placed to sense the disruption of mitochondrial function and subsequent elevated generation of reactive oxygen species that can contribute to the onset of oxidative stress.

Cell Res. 2008; 314: 1789-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), we noted that PGAM5 was consistently identified as a Keap1-interacting protein in our LC-ESI-MS/MS study (supplemental Table 4). IκB kinase β (IKKβ) has also been described as a binding partner of Keap1 in cells (21Lee D.F. Kuo H.P. Liu M. Chou C.K. Xia W. Du Y. Shen J. Chen C.T. Huo L. Hsu M.C. Li C.W. Ding Q. Liao T.L.

IKKβ regulates the activity of the transcription factor nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) by phosphorylating, and consequently inactivating, the cytosolic inhibitors of κB (21Lee D.F. Kuo H.P. Liu M. Chou C.K. Xia W. Du Y. Shen J. Chen C.T. Huo L. Hsu M.C. Li C.W. Ding Q. Liao T.L. Lai C.C. Lin A.C. Chang Y.H. Tsai S.F. Li L.Y. Hung M.C. Mol. Cell. 2009; 36: 131-140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Keap1 was shown to be responsible for the ubiquitination, and subsequent degradation, of IKKβ, so that induction of Keap1 results in a decrease in the activity of the NF-κB pathway, through the enhanced turnover of IKKβ (21Lee D.F. Kuo H.P. Liu M. Chou C.K. Xia W. Du Y. Shen J. Chen C.T. Huo L. Hsu M.C. Li C.W. Ding Q. Liao T.L. Lai C.C. Lin A.C. Chang Y.H. Tsai S.F. Li L.Y. Hung M.C. Mol. Cell. 2009; 36: 131-140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Depletion of SQSTM1 is known to cause a decrease in NF-κB activity (22Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Cell. 2009; 137: 1001-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar), and we have shown here that depletion of SQSTM1 is associated with an induction of Keap1 and repression of Nrf2. Taken together, these findings suggest that SQSTM1 serves as a regulatory node in several signaling cascades that contribute to the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. In a very recent report (23Komatsu M. Kurokawa H. Waguri S. Taguchi K. Kobayashi A. Ichimura Y. Sou Y.S. Ueno I. Sakamoto A. Tong K.I. Kim M. Nishito Y. Iemura S. Natsume T. Ueno T. Kominami E. Motohashi H. Tanaka K. Yamamoto M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2010; 12: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1579) Google Scholar), Komatsu and colleagues have demonstrated an interaction between Keap1 and SQSTM1 and have defined the motifs in Keap1 and SQSTM1 responsible for this interaction. SQSTM1 binds to the bottom side of the six-bladed β-propeller structure formed by the DC (double glycine repeat and C-terminal) domain of Keap1 (23Komatsu M. Kurokawa H. Waguri S. Taguchi K. Kobayashi A. Ichimura Y. Sou Y.S. Ueno I. Sakamoto A. Tong K.I. Kim M. Nishito Y. Iemura S. Natsume T. Ueno T. Kominami E. Motohashi H. Tanaka K. Yamamoto M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2010; 12: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1579) Google Scholar). As with Nrf2 (8Tong K.I. Kobayashi A. Katsuoka F. Yamamoto M. Biol. Chem. 2006; 387: 1311-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), PGAM5 (16Lo S.C. Hannink M. J. Biol.

Cell Res. 2008; 314: 1789-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) and IKKβ (21Lee D.F. Kuo H.P. Liu M. Chou C.K. Xia W. Du Y. Shen J. Chen C.T. Huo L. Hsu M.C. Li C.W. Ding Q. Liao T.L. Lai C.C. Lin A.C. Chang Y.H. Tsai S.F. Li L.Y. Hung M.C. Mol. Cell. 2009; 36: 131-140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), the Keap1-interacting motif in SQSTM1 conforms to the consensus sequence (D/N)X(E/S)(T/S)GE (23Komatsu M. Kurokawa H. Waguri S. Taguchi K. Kobayashi A. Ichimura Y. Sou Y.S. Ueno I. Sakamoto A. Tong K.I. Kim M. Nishito Y. Iemura S. Natsume T. Ueno T. Kominami E. Motohashi H. Tanaka K. Yamamoto M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2010; 12: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1579) Google Scholar). Notably, the Keap1-interacting motif identified by Komatsu et al. (23Komatsu M. Kurokawa H. Waguri S. Taguchi K. Kobayashi A. Ichimura Y. Sou Y.S. Ueno I. Sakamoto A. Tong K.I. Kim M. Nishito Y. Iemura S. Natsume T. Ueno T. Kominami E. Motohashi H. Tanaka K. Yamamoto M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2010; 12: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1579) Google Scholar) lies outside of the ubiquitin-associated domain of SQSTM1, consistent with our finding that this domain is dispensable for the interaction with Keap1. In agreement wih Liu et al. (24Liu Y. Kern J.T. Walker J.R. Johnson J.A. Schultz P.G. Luesch H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 5205-5210Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), who observed an induction of Nrf2-dependent cell defence processes following ectopic expression of SQSTM1 in IMR-32 human neuroblastoma cells, Komatsu and colleagues demonstrated that overproduction of SQSTM1 was shown to cause an increase in the cellular Nrf2 level by competing with Nrf2 for binding to Keap1, disrupting the ability of the latter to direct the ubiquitination of Nrf2 efficiently (23Komatsu M. Kurokawa H. Waguri S. Taguchi K. Kobayashi A. Ichimura Y. Sou Y.S. Ueno I. Sakamoto A. Tong K.I. Kim M. Nishito Y. Iemura S. Natsume T. Ueno T. Kominami E. Motohashi H. Tanaka K. Yamamoto M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2010; 12: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1579) Google Scholar). However, we have demonstrated that the ability of SQSTM1 to regulate the basal protein level of Nrf2 is also due to its capacity to alter the basal protein level of Keap1, by affecting its rate of degradation. In light of the observation of Komatsu and colleagues that ectopic expression of SQSTM1 causes a decrease in the ubiquitination of Nrf2, and in turn an increase in the total cellular level of the transcription factor (23Komatsu M. Kurokawa H. Waguri S. Taguchi K. Kobayashi A. Ichimura Y. Sou Y.S. Ueno I. Sakamoto A. Tong K.I. Kim M. Nishito Y. Iemura S. Natsume T. Ueno T. Kominami E. Motohashi H. Tanaka K. Yamamoto M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2010; 12: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1579) Google Scholar), it is plausible that the decrease in total cellular level of Nrf2 following siRNA depletion of SQSTM1 reported here is due to an increase in Keap1-directed ubiquitination of Nrf2, facilitated by the higher basal level of Keap1. Together with the proteasome, autophagy (literally “self-eating”) is responsible for the majority of cellular protein degradation. Following sequestration within autophagic vacuoles, organelles and cytoplasmic fractions are delivered to lysosomes for degradation (25Maiuri M.C. Zalckvar E. Kimchi A. Kroemer G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 741-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (2781) Google Scholar). SQSTM1 targets proteins for degradation via autophagy by associating with ubiquitin on the substrate and with components of the autophagy machinery, including Atg8/LC3 (26Pankiv S. Clausen T.H. Lamark T. Brech A. Bruun J.A. Outzen H. Øvervatn A. Bjørkøy G. Johansen T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24131-24145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3268) Google Scholar). The basal protein level of Keap1 has been shown to be raised in autophagy-deficient cells (23Komatsu M. Kurokawa H. Waguri S. Taguchi K. Kobayashi A. Ichimura Y. Sou Y.S. Ueno I. Sakamoto A. Tong K.I. Kim M. Nishito Y. Iemura S. Natsume T. Ueno T. Kominami E. Motohashi H. Tanaka K. Yamamoto M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2010; 12: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1579) Google Scholar), implying that Keap1 is at least partly degraded via autophagy. It is important to note that SQSTM1 expression is itself up-regulated in an Nrf2-dependent manner under conditions of chemical/oxidative stress (27Ishii T. Itoh K. Takahashi S. Sato H. Yanagawa T. Katoh Y. Bannai S. Yamamoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16023-16029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar, 28Warabi E. Takabe W. Minami T. Inoue K. Itoh K. Yamamoto M. Ishii T. Kodama T. Noguchi N. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2007; 42: 260-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and it is therefore possible that SQSTM1 forms part of a regulatory feedback loop in the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway. Under conditions of Nrf2 activation, the elevated expression of SQSTM1 may enable the targeting of Keap1 for degradation via autophagy, which in turn may (i) further contribute to the activation of Nrf2 and/or (ii) represent a means by which modified/inactivated Keap1 is removed/recycled to restore homeostasis in the pathway (Fig. 5). The regulation of the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway by autophagy warrants further exploration. More than 20 different mutations in the SQSTM1 gene have been identified in patients diagnosed with Paget's disease of bone, a common disorder of bone-resorbing osteoclasts that causes increased bone turnover and is associated with several complications including bone pain, osteoarthritis, and pathological fracture (29Layfield R. Searle M.S. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2008; 36: 469-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The overwhelming majority of these mutations result in an impaired ability of SQSTM1 to bind ubiquitin (29Layfield R. Searle M.S. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2008; 36: 469-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). SQSTM1 is an important component of a signaling pathway that regulates the activity of NF-κB, which partly controls osteoclastogenesis and the bone-resorbing activity of mature osteoclasts, and it appears that dysfunction of SQSTM1 induces NF-κB-dependent cellular processes, causing increased osteoclast-mediated bone turnover (29Layfield R. Searle M.S. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2008; 36: 469-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In light of our finding that SQSTM1 can regulate the activity of the Keap1-Nrf2 cytoprotective pathway, it will be important to determine the role of Nrf2 in the molecular pathogenesis of Paget's disease of bone. In summary, this study has presented evidence for a physical and functional interaction between Keap1 and SQSTM1 in mammalian cells. In demonstrating that SQSTM1 regulates the degradation of Keap1, this work has uncovered an additional layer of regulatory control within the Keap1-Nrf2 cytoprotective pathway. We thank Drs.

https://openalex.org/W2115664664,"Several studies have reported the existence of a subgroup of obese individuals with normal metabolic profiles. It remains unclear what factors are responsible for this phenomenon. We proposed that adipocyte size might be a key factor in the protection of metabolically healthy obese (MHO) individuals from the adverse effects of obesity.Thirty-five patients undergoing bariatric surgery were classified as MHO (n = 15) or metabolically unhealthy obese (MUO, n = 20) according to cut-off points adapted from the International Diabetes Federation definition of the metabolic syndrome. Median body mass index (BMI) was 48 (range 40-71).There was a moderate correlation between omental adipocyte size and subcutaneous adipocyte size (r = 0.59, p<0.05). The MHO group had significantly lower mean omental adipocyte size (80.9+/-10.9 microm) when compared with metabolically unhealthy patients (100.0+/-7.6 microm, p<0.0001). Mean subcutaneous adipocyte size was similar between the two groups (104.1+/-8.5 microm versus 107.9+/-7.1 microm). Omental, but not subcutaneous adipocyte size, correlated with the degree of insulin resistance as measured by HOMA-IR (r = 0.73, p<0.0005), as well as other metabolic parameters including triglyceride/HDL-cholesterol ratio and HbA1c. Twenty-eight patients consented to liver biopsy. Of these, 46% had steatohepatitis and fibrosis. Fifty percent (including all the MHO patients) had steatosis only. Both omental and subcutaneous adipocyte size were significantly associated with the degree of steatosis (r = 0.66, p<0.0001 and r = 0.63, p<0.005 respectively). However, only omental adipocyte size was an independent predictor of the presence or absence of fibrosis.Metabolically healthy individuals are a distinct subgroup of the severely obese. Both subcutaneous and omental adipocyte size correlated positively with the degree of fatty liver, but only omental adipocyte size was related to metabolic health, and possibly progression from hepatic steatosis to fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2097708062,"Dopamine is a mediator of the stimulant properties of drugs of abuse, including ethanol, in mammals and in the fruit fly Drosophila. The neural substrates for the stimulant actions of ethanol in flies are not known. We show that a subset of dopamine neurons and their targets, through the action of the D1-like dopamine receptor DopR, promote locomotor activation in response to acute ethanol exposure. A bilateral pair of dopaminergic neurons in the fly brain mediates the enhanced locomotor activity induced by ethanol exposure, and promotes locomotion when directly activated. These neurons project to the central complex ellipsoid body, a structure implicated in regulating motor behaviors. Ellipsoid body neurons are required for ethanol-induced locomotor activity and they express DopR. Elimination of DopR blunts the locomotor activating effects of ethanol, and this behavior can be restored by selective expression of DopR in the ellipsoid body. These data tie the activity of defined dopamine neurons to D1-like DopR-expressing neurons to form a neural circuit that governs acute responding to ethanol."
https://openalex.org/W1505364624,"Dysfunctional high density lipoprotein (HDL) is implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease, but the underlying pathways remain poorly understood. One potential mechanism involves covalent modification by reactive carbonyls of apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), the major HDL protein. We therefore determined whether carbonyls resulting from lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde (MDA) and hydroxynonenal) or carbohydrate oxidation (glycolaldehyde, glyoxal, and methylglyoxal) covalently modify lipid-free apoA-I and inhibit its ability to promote cellular cholesterol efflux by the ABCA1 pathway. MDA markedly impaired the ABCA1 activity of apoA-I. In striking contrast, none of the other four carbonyls were effective. Liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry of MDA-modified apoA-I revealed that Lys residues at specific sites had been modified. The chief adducts were MDA-Lys and a Lys-MDA-Lys cross-link. Lys residues in the C terminus of apoA-I were targeted for cross-linking in high yield, and this process may hinder the interaction of apoA-I with lipids and ABCA1, two key steps in reverse cholesterol transport. Moreover, levels of MDA-protein adducts were elevated in HDL isolated from human atherosclerotic lesions, suggesting that lipid peroxidation might render HDL dysfunctional in vivo.

In this scenario, HDL removes excess cholesterol from artery wall macrophages and transports it back to the liver for excretion in bile. Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), the major protein of HDL, plays a critical role in the first step of reverse cholesterol transport by enhancing the sterol efflux from macrophages that is accomplished by the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) (3Oram J.F.

Cell Metab. 2008; 7: 365-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). The ligand for ABCA1 is lipid-free apoA-I produced by remodeling HDL (5Curtiss L.K. Valenta D.T.

Invest. 1995; 96: 78-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Activation of ABCA1 depends critically on repeats 1 and 10 of apoA-I, which are located at the N- and C-terminal regions of the protein, respectively (7Burgess J.W. Frank P.G. Franklin V. Liang P.

ApoA-I also activates lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase, which converts free cholesterol to cholesteryl ester, a subsequent step in the maturation of HDL particles (10Jonas A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1084: 205-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 11Sorci-Thomas M.G. Thomas M.J. Trends Cardiovasc.

One potential pathway involves modification of apoA-I by reactive intermediates, perhaps in the artery wall. Indeed, oxidation of apoA-I by myeloperoxidase, a heme protein that generates an array of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, severely impairs cholesterol efflux by the ABCA1 pathway and inhibits the ability of the protein to activate lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (14Bergt C.

However, little is known about the ability of other reactive species to impair the ABCA1 activity of apoA-I.One mechanism for modifying proteins involves reactive carbonyls (21Baynes J.W. Thorpe S.R. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (2129) Google Scholar, 22Shaklai N. Garlick R.L. Bunn H.F. J. Biol.

Arteriosclerosis. 1990; 10: 336-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). They result from oxidation of carbohydrates or amino acids and peroxidation of lipids (21Baynes J.W. Thorpe S.R. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (2129) Google Scholar, 22Shaklai N. Garlick R.L. Bunn H.F. J. Biol.

Major carbonyl products of carbohydrate oxidation in vivo are thought to be glyoxal, methylglyoxal, and glycolaldehyde, which are precursors of advanced glycation end products. Lipid peroxidation yields a different spectrum of reactive carbonyl compounds, including malondialdehyde (MDA), 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE), and acrolein (24Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5849) Google Scholar, 26Stadtman E.R. Levine R.L. Amino Acids. 2003; 25: 207-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar), which have been termed advanced lipoxidation end products (21Baynes J.W. Thorpe S.R. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (2129) Google Scholar). Importantly, advanced lipoxidation and advanced glycation end product levels are elevated in diabetes, which greatly increases the risk for coronary artery disease (21Baynes J.W. Thorpe S.R. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (2129) Google Scholar, 27Brownlee M. Cerami A. Vlassara H. N. Engl. J. Med. 1988; 318: 1315-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (2325) Google Scholar). Reactive carbonyls can also be produced by oxidation of hydroxyamino acids (28Anderson M.M. Hazen S.L. Hsu F.F. Heinecke J.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 424-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). For example, myeloperoxidase uses hydrogen peroxide produced by the NADPH oxidase of phagocytes to convert l-serine to glycolaldehyde, which in turn can react with proteins to form N-(carboxymethyl)lysine (28Anderson M.M. Hazen S.L. Hsu F.F. Heinecke J.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 424-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). This pathway may be physiologically relevant, because N-(carboxymethyl)lysine formation during acute inflammation is impaired in NADPH oxidase-deficient mice (29Anderson M.M. Heinecke J.W. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 2137-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).HDL may be constantly exposed to reactive carbonyls, because it is the major carrier of lipid hydroperoxides in plasma (30Bowry V.W. Stanley K.K. Stocker R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 10316-10320Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Moreover, when plasma is oxidized ex vivo, apoA-I is a major target for covalent modification by lipid oxidation products (31Szapacs M.E. Kim H.Y. Porter N.A. Liebler D.C. J.

Thus, high concentrations of carbonyls modified apoA-I and inhibited lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase activation by HDL, but the underlying mechanisms were not identified (32McCall M.R. Tang J.Y. Bielicki J.K. Forte T.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1599-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). When apoA-I incorporated into discoidal, reconstituted HDL was exposed to methylglyoxal, it lost its ability to activate lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (33Nobecourt E. Davies M.J. Brown B.E. Curtiss L.K. Bonnet D.J. Charlton F. Januszewski A.S. Jenkins A.J. Barter P.J. Rye K.A. Diabetologia. 2007; 50: 643-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This loss was associated with modification of arginine, lysine, and tryptophan residues. We previously showed that acrolein (an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl derived from oxidized lipids and myeloperoxidase-oxidized threonine) modifies a single lysine residue in repeat 10 of apoA-I. That specific modification associated quantitatively with impaired cholesterol transport by ABCA1 (34Shao B. Fu X. McDonald T.O. Green P.S. Uchida K. O'Brien K.D. Oram J.F. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36386-36396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar).Neither the structures of the protein adducts nor the specific amino acid residues that MDA and other reactive carbonyls modify in apoA-I have been identified. In this study, we investigated the reactivity of carbonyls with apoA-I, and we determined whether these compounds altered the ability of the protein to promote cholesterol efflux by the ABCA1 pathway. We focused on five carbonyls implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease (21Baynes J.W. Thorpe S.R. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (2129) Google Scholar, 23Berliner J.A.

Invest. 1991; 88: 1785-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (2462) Google Scholar) as follows: MDA, HNE, glyoxal, methylglyoxal, and glycolaldehyde (Fig. 1A). We found that MDA selectively modifies Lys residues and dramatically impairs the ability of apoA-I to transport cellular cholesterol by the ABCA1 pathway. Moreover, we detected elevated levels of MDA adducts in HDL isolated from human atherosclerotic lesions, raising the possibility that MDA interferes with normal HDL cholesterol transport by modifying Lys residues in apoA-I in the artery wall.DISCUSSIONConversion of HDL to a dysfunctional form has been proposed to impair the cardioprotective properties of the lipoprotein, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood (13Barter P.J. Nicholls S. Rye K.A. Anantharamaiah G.M. Navab M. Fogelman A.M. Circ. Res. 2004; 95: 764-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar, 53Shao B. Oda M.N. Oram J.F. Heinecke J.W. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2010; 23: 447-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). However, many lines of evidence implicate reactive carbonyls in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic and diabetic vascular disease (21Baynes J.W. Thorpe S.R. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (2129) Google Scholar, 27Brownlee M. Cerami A. Vlassara H. N. Engl. J.

Therefore, we determined whether pathophysiologically relevant carbonyls, MDA, HNE, glyoxal, methylglyoxal, and glycolaldehyde, might impair a key aspect of cardioprotective effects of apoA-I, i.e. cholesterol removal by the ABCA1 pathway. Remarkably, we found that MDA, unlike the other carbonyls we tested, potently damages this critical step in reverse cholesterol transport. These observations may be biologically important because we showed that HDL isolated from human atherosclerotic lesions had been modified by MDA.The nature of selective vulnerability of apoA-I to MDA is a key question. Three lines of evidence strongly support the proposal that MDA modifies the ϵ-amino group of Lys residues in the C terminus of apoA-I and that the resulting Lys-MDA adducts impair cholesterol efflux by the ABCA1 pathway. First, quantitative analysis of proteolytic digests of apoA-I by isotope dilution MS revealed that certain Lys residues were converted in high yield to the MDA-Lys or Lys-MDA-Lys adduct. Six of the 10 most reactive Lys residues resided in repeats 7–10 of the C terminus of apoA-I (Fig. 9), suggesting that modification of this region might be an important mechanism for impairing ABCA1 activity. Second, HNE failed to affect the ability of apoA-I to promote cholesterol efflux even though it modified all five His residues of the central domain of apoA-I in high yield (Fig. 9). Glyoxal and methylglyoxal, which likewise failed to affect the ABCA1 activity of apoA-I, modified residues in the N terminus of the protein and the central region of the protein but not its C terminus (Fig. 9). Third, the C terminus of apoA-I was the major site for cross-linking by MDA (Fig. 9). A model based on molecular dynamics energy minimization suggested that cross-linking caused the C terminus of apoA-I to become highly condensed, which should markedly affect its conformation and conformational adaptability. Importantly, studies of deletion mutants of apoA-I suggest that repeat 10 of the C terminus of the protein helps activate ABCA1 (7Burgess J.W. Frank P.G. Franklin V. Liang P. McManus D.C.

Taken together, these observations support the proposal that modification of the C terminus of apoA-I by MDA deprives the protein of its ability to promote cholesterol efflux by the ABCA1 pathway.The C-terminal region of lipid-free apoA-I contains a stretch of random coil (residues 188–208) and a stretch of β-strand (residues 209–220) (44Oda M.N.

The random coil is thought to contribute to the energy requirements of lipid-free to lipid-bound conformational transition, and the β-strand stabilizes the soluble lipid-free conformation of apoA-I (44Oda M.N. Forte T.M. Ryan R.O. Voss J.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 455-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 59Tanaka M. Dhanasekaran P. Nguyen D. Ohta S. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Saito H. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 10351-10358Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). When the protein binds lipid, however, residues 188–220 undergo a transition to an α-helical structure (44Oda M.N. Forte T.M. Ryan R.O. Voss J.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 455-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). This conformational transition has been proposed to account for most of the free energy required to transform apoA-I from its lipid-free to lipid-bound states (44Oda M.N. Forte T.M. Ryan R.O. Voss J.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 455-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 59Tanaka M. Dhanasekaran P. Nguyen D. Ohta S. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Saito H. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 10351-10358Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Molecular dynamics energy minimization modeling, based on the Lys-MDA-Lys adducts we observed in repeats 7–10, suggested that cross-linking limited the conformational adaptability of the C terminus of lipid-free apoA-I. Cross-linking would therefore minimize the enthalpic contribution of this region to lipid binding.Collectively, our observations suggest that MDA alters the ability of apoA-I to promote sterol efflux by impairing two key steps in the ABCA1 pathway (60Vedhachalam C. Duong P.T. Nickel M. Nguyen D. Dhanasekaran P. Saito H. Rothblat G.H. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 25123-25130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). First, MDA-Lys adducts alter the structure and conformation of repeat 10, preventing productive interactions with ABCA1 (61Panagotopulos S.E. Witting S.R. Horace E.M. Hui D.Y. Maiorano J.N. Davidson W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39477-39484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Second, Lys-MDA-Lys cross-links limit the conformational adaptability of the C terminus, reducing the amount of free energy available for the lipid-free to lipid-bound transition of apoA-I.Modification of apoA-I could be physiologically relevant because MDA is one of the most abundant carbonyls generated through lipid peroxidation (24Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5849) Google Scholar). Indeed, immunochemical analyses of HDL with MDA2, a monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity to a variety of MDA-modified proteins (42Palinski W. Ylä-Herttuala S. Rosenfeld M.E. Butler S.W. Socher S.A. Parthasarathy S. Curtiss L.K. Witztum J.L. Arteriosclerosis. 1990; 10: 325-335Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), demonstrated that HDL isolated from atherosclerotic tissue contained a 3.6-fold higher concentration of MDA than HDL from the plasma of apparently healthy humans. Moreover, MDA concentration appears to increase in diseases, such as diabetes mellitus, that increase the risk of cardiovascular disease (54Slatter D.A. Bolton C.H. Bailey A.J. Diabetologia. 2000; 43: 550-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Importantly, MDA adducts have also been detected in low density lipoproteins isolated from atherosclerotic lesions (62Ylä-Herttuala S. Palinski W. Butler S.W. Picard S. Steinberg D. Witztum J.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 32-40Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and modification by MDA of Lys residues in apoB-100 of low density lipoprotein is implicated in macrophage foam cell formation (35Witztum J.L. Steinberg D. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1785-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (2462) Google Scholar, 63Heinecke J.W. Atherosclerosis. 1998; 141: 1-15Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), a critical step in atherogenesis.These observations suggest that modification of Lys residues by MDA generated during lipid peroxidation could promote the formation of macrophage foam cells by two distinct pathways as follows: (i) conversion of low density lipoprotein into a ligand for scavenger receptors that admit cholesterol into macrophages; and (ii) modification of lipid-free apoA-I derived from HDL in a manner that impairs cholesterol efflux by the ABCA1 pathway.Most studies of protein modification have focused on the vulnerability of individual amino acid side chains. Remarkably little is known about the influence of nearby residues, although it is clear that reactive intermediates can modify specific amino acid residues in proteins (19Shao B. Oda M.N. Bergt C.

Cardiol. 2006; 21: 322-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). When we exposed apoA-I to low concentrations of MDA, isotope dilution MS revealed that certain Lys residues were modified in high yield, whereas others were almost completely resistant. Thus, MDA modifies Lys residues only at specific sites in lipid-free apoA-I. Analysis of nearby amino acids in the apoA-I sequence demonstrated that a positively charged amino acid located two residues away (toward the N terminus of the protein) from a Lys residue strongly associated with increased reactivity with MDA. In contrast, a negatively charged amino acid residue located three amino acids toward the C terminus associated with decreased modification by MDA. It is important to note that most of apoA-I has an α-helical structure and that amino acids two and three residues apart in a primary α-helical sequence are closely located in three-dimensional space. Our observations suggest that positively charged amino acids that are appropriately juxtaposed to Lys residues in apoA-I may favor the formation of MDA-Lys adducts. Interestingly, positively charged surfaces in albumin were recently proposed to direct site-specific modification of Lys residues by MDA (66Ishii T. Ito S. Kumazawa S. Sakurai T. Yamaguchi S. Mori T. Nakayama T. Uchida K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 371: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).HNE is perhaps the best studied product of lipid peroxidation (24Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5849) Google Scholar). It can react with imidazoles (His), thiols (Cys), or free amino (Lys) groups of proteins to form stable Michael adducts with hemiacetal structures (39Requena J.R. Fu M.X. Ahmed M.U. Jenkins A.J. Lyons T.J. Baynes J.W. Thorpe S.R. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 67Schaur R.J. Mol. Aspects Med. 2003; 24: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). We readily detected His adducts after we exposed apoA-I to HNE. Quantitative analysis by isotope dilution MS revealed that all five His residues in apoA-I were modified in high yield (∼90%) when the protein was exposed to a 50:1 molar ratio of HNE. Remarkably, this concentration of HNE had no effect on the ability of apoA-I to promote cholesterol efflux by the ABCA1 pathway, likely because all five His residues are located in the central region of the protein, which does not appear to play a major role in activating the transporter.Glyoxal and methylglyoxal can be generated by carbohydrate, lipid, and amino acid oxidation, and elevated levels of these reactive carbonyls are thought to play important roles in the accelerated vascular disease observed in diabetic humans (55Thornalley P.J. Drug Metabol. Drug Interact. 2008; 23: 125-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). However, apoA-I exposed to either carbonyl was still fully competent to promote cholesterol efflux by the ABCA1 pathway. These observations are consistent with the fact that only one Arg residue, Arg215, resides in repeats 9 and 10 of apoA-I. Importantly, this Arg was only minimally modified by glyoxal or methylglyoxal.Glycolaldehyde is produced by carbohydrate oxidation (68Glomb M.A. Monnier V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10017-10026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar) and by activated human neutrophils, which use myeloperoxidase to make it from l-serine (28Anderson M.M. Hazen S.L. Hsu F.F. Heinecke J.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 424-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 29Anderson M.M. Heinecke J.W. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 2137-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, we were unable to detect any modified amino acid residues in apoA-I exposed to glycolaldehyde. Our observations suggest that glycolaldehyde has little impact on the ability of apoA-I to promote cholesterol efflux by ABCA1, but it is unclear whether the carbonyl yields stable adducts in apoA-I under our experimental conditions.In conclusion, we demonstrated that of five reactive carbonyls studied only MDA selectively and dramatically impaired the ability of apoA-I to transport cholesterol. The mechanism likely involves modification of Lys residues, especially cross-linking in repeats 9 and 10 in the C terminus. Our observations raise the possibility that modification of apoA-I by MDA generates dysfunctional HDL that can no longer remove cholesterol from macrophages. In future studies, it will be of interest to determine whether reactive carbonyls impair other key steps in reverse cholesterol transport, such as lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase activation, that depend on apoA-I.

In this scenario, HDL removes excess cholesterol from artery wall macrophages and transports it back to the liver for excretion in bile. Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), the major protein of HDL, plays a critical role in the first step of reverse cholesterol transport by enhancing the sterol efflux from macrophages that is accomplished by the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) (3Oram J."
https://openalex.org/W2020673962,"Background Brucellosis is a zoonosis of veterinary, public health and economic significance in most developing countries. Human brucellosis is a severely debilitating disease that requires prolonged treatment with a combination of antibiotics. The disease can result in permanent and disabling sequel, and results in considerable medical expenses in addition to loss of income due to loss of working hours. A study was conducted in Northern Tanzania to determine the risk factors for transmission of brucellosis to humans in Tanzania. Methods This was a matched case-control study. Any patient with a positive result by a competitive ELISA (c-ELISA) test for brucellosis, and presenting to selected hospitals with at least two clinical features suggestive of brucellosis such as headache, recurrent or continuous fever, sweating, joint pain, joint swelling, general body malaise or backache, was defined as a case. For every case in a district, a corresponding control was traced and matched by sex using multistage cluster sampling. Other criteria for inclusion as a control included a negative c-ELISA test result and that the matched individual would present to hospital if falls sick. Results Multivariable analysis showed that brucellosis was associated with assisted parturition during abortion in cattle, sheep or goat. It was shown that individuals living in close proximity to other households had a higher risk of brucellosis. People who were of Christian religion were found to have a higher risk of brucellosis compared to other religions. The study concludes that assisting an aborting animal, proximity to neighborhoods, and Christianity were associated with brucellosis infection. There was no association between human brucellosis and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) serostatus. Protecting humans against contact with fluids and tissues during assisted parturition of livestock may be an important means of reducing the risk of transferring brucellosis from livestock to humans. These can be achieved through health education to the communities where brucellosis is common."

Although mitochondria contain sphingolipids, direct regulation of their levels in mitochondria or mitochondria-associated membranes is mostly unclear.

To date, three N-SMases have been identified and cloned in mammals: nSMase1 (SMPD2), nSMase2 (SMPD3), and nSMase3 (SMPD4). Among the three enzymes, nSMase1 and nSMase2 were identified according to remote sequence similarity with bacterial SMase (8Tomiuk S. Zumbansen M. Stoffel W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5710-5717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Although nSMase1 exhibits in vitro SMase activity, it showed no effects on SM or ceramide levels when overexpressed in MCF-7 cells but rather had effects on lyso-PAF levels (9Sawai H. Domae N. Nagan N. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38131-38139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, a recent study has suggested that nSMase1 can function as an in vivo SMase in some instances (10Yabu T. Imamura S. Yamashita M. Okazaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 29971-29982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In contrast, nSMase2 possesses both in vitro and in vivo activity, increasing ceramide levels when overexpressed (11Hofmann K. Tomiuk S. Wolff G. Stoffel W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The enzymatic activity of nSMase2 is Mg2+-dependent and is activated by anionic phospholipids such as phosphatidylserine (PS). Moreover, nSMase2 has been implicated in a number of processes including the cellular response to cytokines and oxidative stress, growth arrest, development, and cell death (12Marchesini N. Luberto C. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13775-13783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 13Hayashi Y. Kiyono T. Fujita M. Ishibashi M. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 2008; 74: 1022-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Unlike nSMase1 and nSMase2, nSMase3 was identified using the peptide sequence of a partially purified bovine protein (16Krut O. Wiegmann K. Kashkar H. Yazdanpanah B. Krönke M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13784-13793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Although found to have very low sequence homology to the other N-SMase proteins, nSMase3 is also Mg2+-dependent and is also activated by PS. Recent insight into the functional roles of nSMases has come from the development of knock-out (KO) mice. The nSMase2 KO mice are characterized by a form of dwarfism most visibly manifested in the skeleton with the long bones found to have short stature and deformation (17Stoffel W. Jenke B. Blöck B. Zumbansen M. Koebke J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 4554-4559Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). This report took on greater significance when the fro/fro mouse, a model of osteogenesis imperfecta, was found to carry a mutation in the SMPD3 gene resulting in an inactive enzyme (18Aubin I. Adams C.P. Opsahl S. Septier D. Bishop C.E. Auge N. Salvayre R. Negre-Salvayre A. Goldberg M. Guénet J.L. Poirier C. Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 803-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), thus suggesting a role for nSMase2 in regulation of bone homeostasis. However, despite these findings, no clear abnormality was observed in other tissues. Moreover, neither nSMase1 nor nSMase2 KO mice nor nSMase1-nSMase2 double KO mice appear to possess abnormalities in SM levels (17Stoffel W. Jenke B. Blöck B. Zumbansen M. Koebke J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 4554-4559Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Consequently, it is important to clarify the role of each SMase in cells and various tissues. Furthermore, it is essential to identify any undiscovered N-SMase, which may be important for SM metabolism and ceramide function. Mitochondria contain a variety of sphingolipids, including ceramide and SM (19Ardail D. Popa I. Alcantara K. Pons A. Zanetta J.P. Louisot P. Thomas L. Portoukalian J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 488: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 20Tserng K.Y. Griffin R. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 323: 84-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 21Yabu T. Shimuzu A. Yamashita M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 20349-20363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Ceramide has also been implicated in mitochondria-mediated apoptosis (22Novgorodov S.A. Gudz T.I. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 2009; 53: 198-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 23Futerman A.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1758: 1885-1892Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 24Birbes H. El Bawab S. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 2002; 42: 113-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). However, the direct regulation of sphingolipids in mitochondria or mitochondria-associated membranes is mostly unclear with few reports detecting changes in mitochondrial ceramide in response to induction of apoptosis (25Deng X. Yin X. Allan R. Lu D.D. Maurer C.W. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Fuks Z. Shaham S. Kolesnick R. Science. 2008; 322: 110-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 26Martínez-Abundis E. Correa F. Pavón N. Zazueta C. Febs. J. 2009; 276: 5579-5588Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This lack of information on SMase and other sphingolipid-regulating enzymes in mitochondria has significantly handicapped efforts to delineate signaling pathways in this organelle that involve sphingolipids. Notably, in yeast, the mammalian N-SMase orthologue Isc1p has been localized to both mitochondria and ER and is important for yeast cell growth (27Sawai H. Okamoto Y. Luberto C. Mao C. Bielawska A. Domae N. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39793-39798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In contrast, nSMase2 localizes to the plasma membrane and Golgi, whereas nSMase3 localizes to the Golgi and ER (16Krut O. Wiegmann K. Kashkar H. Yazdanpanah B. Krönke M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13784-13793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 28Corcoran C.A. He Q. Ponnusamy S. Ogretmen B. Huang Y. Sheikh M.S. Mol. Cancer Res. 2008; 6: 795-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). More recently, a zebrafish N-SMase was identified in zebrafish that localized at least partly to mitochondria on overexpression (21Yabu T. Shimuzu A. Yamashita M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 20349-20363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Taken together, this suggests the potential existence of a mitochondria-associated N-SMase in mammals, which could be a key enzyme for sphingolipid metabolism. In this study, we have cloned and characterized a novel murine SMase (SMPD5) that shares significant sequence similarity with nSMase2 and zebrafish mitochondrial SMase and has comparable biochemical properties, indicating that it is a member of the extended N-SMase family. Uniquely among mammalian nSMases, the SMase localizes to both mitochondria and ER. Thus, we propose to name the enzyme as mitochondria-associated neutral SMase (MA-nSMase). Importantly, overexpression of MA-nSMase resulted in significantly increased ceramide with a concomitant decrease of SM level, demonstrating its role in the regulation of cellular sphingolipids. Thus, these studies identify and characterize, for the first time, a mammalian MA-nSMase, with implications for the metabolism of sphingolipids associated with the mitochondria. [Choline-methyl-14C]SM was provided by the Lipidomics Core Facility at the Medical University of South Carolina. All other lipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids. Goat anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse antibodies were acquired from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise stated. A tBLASTn search using the zebrafish mitochondrial nSMase and nSMase2 amino acid sequences identified several partial mouse cDNA sequences from the Expressed Sequence Tags (dbEST) database, including, BB615725.1, CF983093.1, BU583488.1, BY705974.1, CF197814.1, and BX516030.1. A further BLAST search using the identified EST sequences scanning the genomic sequence data bank revealed a sequence (NC000081) in mouse chromosome 15. To clarify the 5′ mouse MA-nSMase sequence, two oligonucleotides were synthesized based on the EST sequences (for primer sequence information, see supplemental Table 1). As several EST sequences were from the testis cDNA library, a mouse testis Marathon-ready cDNA (Clontech) was purchased for identification of the MA-nSMase sequence. Rapid amplification of cDNA ends was used to amplify the 5′ ends from the mouse cDNA according to the manufacturer's instructions. Further, a 1.5-kb cDNA containing the full-length coding region was amplified using the same testis cDNA and Pfu polymerase (Stratagene). PCR mixtures were first incubated at 94 °C for 3 min and then amplified for 45 cycles at 94 °C for 45 s, at 64 °C for 1 min, and at 72 °C for 3 min. The PCR product was sequenced and verified in independent PCR reactions. To express the MA-nSMase, the full-length coding sequence without stop codon was further amplified and then cloned into pcDNA3V5/His-topo vector (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNAs from various mouse tissues were isolated using the Qiagen mini kit for total RNA extraction. cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Real time RT-PCR was performed on an iCycler system (Bio-Rad) using SYBR Green PCR reagents (Bio-Rad). The first step of RT-PCR was performed at 95 °C for 3 min. Cycles (n = 40) consisted of a 15-s melt at 95 °C followed by 60 s at 55 °C. The final step was a 60-s incubation at 55 °C. Reactions were performed in triplicate. The β-actin gene was used as an internal reference control to normalize relative levels of gene expression. Real time PCR results were analyzed using Q-Gene® software (29Muller P.Y. Janovjak H. Miserez A.R. Dobbie Z. BioTechniques. 2002; 32 (1376, 1378–1379): 1372-1374PubMed Google Scholar), which expresses data as mean normalized expression. Mean normalized expression is directly proportional to the amount of RNA of the MA-nSMase relative to the amount of RNA of the β-actin. HEK293 (ATCC CRL-1573) and MCF-7 (ATCC HTB-22) cells were cultured in Eagle's minimum essential medium or RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen), respectively. Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. HEK293 cells were cultured in minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. DNA transfection was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were collected in lysis buffer (25 mm Tris; pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) and homogenized by brief sonication. The homogenate was taken for protein determination using the BCA assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Twenty μg of total proteins from each lysate were loaded onto a 4–20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel, subjected to electrophoresis, and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The blots were probed using 1:2000 dilution of primary antibody followed by horseradish peroxidase labeled secondary antibody (1:5000 dilution) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The signals were detected using ECL chemiluminescence reagents (Pierce). The antibodies against V5 were from Invitrogen. The β-actin antibody was purchased from Sigma. In vitro N-SMase enzymatic assays were performed as described previously with modifications (12Marchesini N. Luberto C. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13775-13783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were collected and lysed as described above, and 25 μg of proteins were used for each activity reaction. The final volume was adjusted to 200 μl. Each reaction mixture contained 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm (6.5 mol %) PS, and 100 μm [choline-methyl-14C]SM. For the pH optimum determination, the substrate was dissolved in 100 mm of the following buffers: acetate buffer (pH 4.0–5.5), MES buffer (pH 5.7–6.3), Tris buffer (pH 7.0–8.5), and glycine-NaOH buffer (pH 9.0–10.0). To determine the cation effects, neutral SMase activity was measured at various concentrations of MgCl2, MnCl2, CaCl2, ZnCl2, FeCl2, or CuCl2. For kinetics determination, 12.5 μm (0.8 mol %) to 400 μm (25.8 mol %) SM was used as a substrate for the activity assays. The kinetic parameters, Vmax and Km, were calculated using GraphPad Prism software. To determine the phospholipid effects on activity, 6.5 mol % of PS or other phospholipids (including phosphatidic acid (PA), phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidyl-ethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), phosphatidylinositol (PI), and cardiolipin (CL)) was included in the reaction. After incubation for 0.5 h at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding 1.5 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1) followed by adding 400 μl of water. Phases were separated by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 5 min. By subjecting 500 μl of the upper phase to scintillation counting, SMase activity was determined by quantification of the amount of released radioactive phosphocholine. Assays were performed as described previously (9Sawai H. Domae N. Nagan N. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38131-38139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) with some modifications. The assay mixture was the same as N-SMase assay described above except that the reaction mixture contained 100 μm [choline-methyl-14C]PC or [1-O-octadecyl-3H]lyso-PAF instead of SM. After 30 min of incubation at 37 °C, the lipid was extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer and separated by TLC in solvent system (chloroform/methanol/2 n NH4OH 60:35:5). The TLC plates were sprayed with autoradiography enhancer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and exposed to film at −80 °C for 5 days. The bands corresponding to monoacylglycerol and diacylglycerol were scraped from the TLC plate for liquid scintillation counting. HEK293 or MCF-7 cells were grown on 35-mm glass-bottom culture dishes (MatTek). Transient transfection of plasmids (1 μg/dish) was performed using Effectene reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. At 24 h after transfection, cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min. Following fixation, cells were permeabilized for 5 min with 100% methanol at −20 °C and then blocked in 2% human serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Anti-Hsp60, anti-Tom20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-giantin (Covance), or anti-calreticulin antibodies were co-incubated with anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen). Incubations were performed in 2% human serum at 1:100 dilutions for 2 h at room temperature. Following primary antibody treatment, cells were washed three times with PBS, probed with fluorescent secondary antibody (1:200 anti-rabbit 555, 1:200 anti-mouse 488, 60 min, room temperature), and washed three times with PBS. Cells were stored at 4 °C under PBS prior to being viewed on a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta confocal microscope. After 18 and 36 h of transfection with control pcDNA3 or MA-nSMase-pcDNA3 vector, the cells were harvested for SM and ceramide measurement. Sphingolipid analysis was performed in the Lipidomics Core Facility of the Medical University of South Carolina, using electrospray ionization/tandem mass spectrometry on a Thermo Finnigan TSQ 7000 triple stage quadrupole mass spectrometer, operating in a multiple reaction monitoring positive ionization mode (30Bielawski J. Szulc Z.M. Hannun Y.A. Bielawska A. Methods. 2006; 39: 82-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Each sample was normalized to its respective total protein levels. Results are expressed as the mean ± S.D. Comparisons among groups were made by Student's t tests. A p value of 0.05 or less was considered as statistically significant. The cloned full-length mouse MA-nSMase cDNA consists of 1449 bp at the coding region (GenBank™ accession number GU144514). This open reading frame encodes a predicted protein of 483 amino acid residues (Fig. 1A) with a calculated molecular mass of 53,868 Da and an isoelectric point of 8.58. The MA-nSMase protein also retained significant motifs and amino acids essential to cation binding and catalytic activity, including the P-loop like domain and the key catalytic residues Asp-470 and His-471 (Fig. 1A) (27Sawai H. Okamoto Y. Luberto C. Mao C. Bielawska A. Domae N. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39793-39798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Hydrophobicity and transmembrane domain analysis found a short sequence in the N-terminal region (amino acids 77–99) that is highly hydrophobic and is predicted to form a transmembrane helix (Fig. 1, A and B). The global GenBank search showed that mouse MA-nSMase is not identical to any identified gene but has high sequence homology with a number of EST clones. This cDNA also matches with the genome sequence from mouse chromosomes, revealing its chromosome location at 15D3. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis revealed (Fig. 1C) that the deduced mouse MA-nSMase protein has homology with other nSMases with the highest sequence homology shown to nSMase2 (50.6% similarity) and the zebrafish mitochondrial SMase (54.2% similarity) (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, the zebrafish SMase shares higher homology (58.5% similarity) to nSMase2 than to MA-nSMase. In summary, the sequence information revealed that the identified cDNA and the enzyme clearly belong to the extended family of N-SMases. Next, the tissue-specific expression of mouse MA-nSMase mRNA was examined by real time RT-PCR (Fig. 2). As can be seen, expression levels varied among tissues with the highest expression found in testis, pancreas, epididymis, and brain. Significant levels of mRNA were also detected in spleen, thymus, and skin, whereas the lowest mRNA levels were detected in stomach, intestine, colon, liver, lung, kidney, heart, ovary, and bladder. Additionally, a database search found MA-nSMase cDNA (EST) sequences in lymphatic tissue, thymus node, mammary gland, stem cells, and embryos at various stages. The expression pattern of MA-nSMase suggests that this enzyme may play important roles in reproductive, neuronal, developmental, and immune functions. Having identified a cDNA that encodes a putative mammalian SMase, it next became important to confirm that the encoded protein is indeed a functional SMase. Accordingly, a V5-tagged cDNA was transfected into HEK293 and MCF-7 cells. By Western blot, no signal was detected in empty vector pcDNA3-transfected cells, whereas a band with a molecular mass of about 50 kDa was detected in the cDNA-overexpressing cells (Fig. 3A). The band detected closely matched the calculated molecular mass of the predicted protein. To establish that the cloned protein functions as an nSMase, activity assays on vector-transfected and cDNA-transfected cells were performed. As can be seen, there was significantly greater N-SMase activity in the SMase-transfected cells than the control cells (Fig. 3, B and C). This confirms that the encoded protein possesses in vitro SMase activity. To determine whether the protein possessed enzymatic activity against lyso-PAF (as with nSMase1) or other lipids as substrates (such as PC), activity assays were performed. However, no significant activity was observed against these other substrates (data not shown). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the cDNA encodes an ∼50-kDa protein that possesses in vitro N-SMase activity. Given the high similarity of MA-nSMase with both nSMase2 and the zebrafish mitochondrial SMase, it became important to determine the subcellular localization of the new nSMase. Accordingly, the V5-tagged protein was transiently expressed in both MCF-7 (Fig. 4A, supplemental Fig. 1A) and HEK293 (Fig. 4B, supplemental Fig. 1B) cells. Cells were co-stained with V5 and antibodies against various subcellular markers. In both cell lines, confocal microscopy revealed that this protein was partly co-localized with the mitochondrial marker HSP60, suggesting that this protein localized to mitochondria. This was further confirmed with Tom20, a mitochondrial outer membrane marker. Interestingly, MA-nSMase showed a doughnut pattern of mitochondria that overlapped much more closely with TOM20 than with HSP60, suggesting that MA-nSMase is a mitochondrial membrane protein and not a matrix protein. Moreover, the protein also showed some overlapping signals with the ER marker calreticulin. However, overlay with the Golgi marker giantin demonstrated no significant co-localization. Taken together, these results demonstrate that MA-nSMase is localized to both mitochondria and ER. Having confirmed that the cloned cDNA encodes a functional in vitro SMase, we next wanted to characterize the biochemical properties of the enzyme. For this, the activity of MA-nSMase was measured using lysates from HEK293 cells transiently transfected with MA-nSMase cDNA or an empty vector as control. As shown in Fig. 5A, the optimal activity of MA-nSMase was found in the neutral range with maximum activity at pH 7.5, confirming that this enzyme should be classified as an N-SMase. In contrast, there was comparable activity of vector control and SMase-overexpressing cells at the acid range of pH 4.0–6.0, suggesting that the new SMase has no acid SMase activity. Additionally, as the SMase activity of the vector control cells was very low at the neutral and alkaline pH range, this provided a low background for further analysis of the enzymatic properties of MA-nSMase in the overexpressing HEK293 cells. We next examined the kinetics of MA-nSMase activity (Fig. 5B) and found that the enzyme followed classical Michaelis-Menten kinetics displaying an apparent Km of 14.3 ± 1.3 mol % and a Vmax of 370.3 ± 16.8 nmol/h/mg of protein. The metal ion dependence of the N-SMase activity was also analyzed. Accordingly, several cations including calcium, manganese, iron, copper, and zinc were substituted for magnesium in the in vitro assay. As can be seen, the N-SMase activity of MA-nSMase-overexpressing cells was strongly dependent on Mg2+ and Mn2+ with Mn2+ showing a higher stimulation (Fig. 5C). In contrast, calcium, copper, iron, or zinc did not support MA-nSMase activity. These results are very comparable with other members of the extended N-SMase family. Anionic phospholipids were previously shown to function as activators of other mammalian N-SMases. Accordingly, the effect of phospholipids on MA-nSMase activity was also examined. At 100 μm (6.5 mol %), PG, PS, and CL strongly induced activity by ∼8-, 15-, and 23-fold, respectively (Fig. 6A). In contrast, other phospholipids such as PA, PC, PE, and PI had minimal effects on MA-nSMase activity. Further analysis demonstrated that CL and PS can activate MA-nSMase in a dose-dependent manner with CL showing a lower Ka and a higher Vmax (Fig. 6B). Overall, these results indicate that MA-nSMase has comparable biochemical properties with other N-SMase family members. Thus far, it has been shown that the MA-nSMase cDNA encodes a protein with in vitro N-SMase activity. Therefore, it became very important to"
https://openalex.org/W2147098807,"Stress granules (SGs) are cytoplasmic foci at which untranslated mRNAs accumulate in cells exposed to environmental stress. We have identified ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), an enzyme required for polyamine synthesis, and eIF5A, a polyamine (hypusine)-modified translation factor, as proteins required for arsenite-induced SG assembly. Knockdown of deoxyhypusine synthase (DHS) or treatment with a deoxyhypusine synthase inhibitor (GC7) prevents hypusine modification of eIF5A as well as arsenite-induced polysome disassembly and stress granule assembly. Time-course analysis reveals that this is due to a slowing of stress-induced ribosome run-off in cells lacking hypusine-eIF5A. Whereas eIF5A only marginally affects protein synthesis under normal conditions, it is required for the rapid onset of stress-induced translational repression. Our results reveal that hypusine-eIF5A-facilitated translation elongation promotes arsenite-induced polysome disassembly and stress granule assembly in cells subjected to adverse environmental conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2024617316,"Vesicomyid bivalves are a consistent component of communities of sulphide-rich reducing environments distributed worldwide from 77° N to 70°S at depths from 100 to 9050 m. Up-to-now the taxonomy of the family has been uncertain. In this paper, the current state of vesicomyid taxonomy and distribution at the generic rank are considered. This survey is founded on a database including information both from literature sources and also unpublished data of the authors on all recent species of vesicomyids. We suggest that the Vesicomyidae is not a synonym of Kelliellidae, and is therefore a valid family name. We propose to divide the family Vesicomyidae into two subfamilies: Vesicomyinae and Pliocardiinae. The Vesicomyinae includes one genus, Vesicomya, which comprises small-sized bivalves characterized by non-reduced gut and the absence of subfilamental tissue in gills. Symbiosis with chemoautotrophic bacteria has, so far, not been proved for Vesicomya and the genus is not restricted to sulphide-rich reducing habitats. The subfamily Pliocardiinae currently contains about 15 genera with mostly medium or large body size, characterized by the presence of subfilamental tissue in the gills. The Pliocardiinae are highly specialized for sulphide-rich reducing environments, harbouring chemoautrophic bacteria in their gills. This is the first summary of the generic structure of the family Vesicomyidae that allow us to analyze the distribution of vesicomyids at the generic level. We recognize here five different distribution patterns that are related to the specific environmental demands. The general trends in the distribution patterns of the vesicomyids are an occurrence of the majority of genera in broad geographical ranges and the prevalence of near continental type of distribution."
https://openalex.org/W2023863037,"Background Aluminum (Al) toxicity is a major worldwide constraint to crop productivity on acidic soils. Al becomes soluble at low pH, inhibiting root growth and severely reducing yields. Maize is an important staple food and commodity crop in acidic soil regions, especially in South America and Africa where these soils are very common. Al exclusion and intracellular tolerance have been suggested as two important mechanisms for Al tolerance in maize, but little is known about the underlying genetics. Methodology An association panel of 282 diverse maize inbred lines and three F2 linkage populations with approximately 200 individuals each were used to study genetic variation in this complex trait. Al tolerance was measured as net root growth in nutrient solution under Al stress, which exhibited a wide range of variation between lines. Comparative and physiological genomics-based approaches were used to select 21 candidate genes for evaluation by association analysis. Conclusions Six candidate genes had significant results from association analysis, but only four were confirmed by linkage analysis as putatively contributing to Al tolerance: Zea mays AltSB like (ZmASL), Zea mays aluminum-activated malate transporter2 (ALMT2), S-adenosyl-L-homocysteinase (SAHH), and Malic Enzyme (ME). These four candidate genes are high priority subjects for follow-up biochemical and physiological studies on the mechanisms of Al tolerance in maize. Immediately, elite haplotype-specific molecular markers can be developed for these four genes and used for efficient marker-assisted selection of superior alleles in Al tolerance maize breeding programs."
https://openalex.org/W2126114470,"Integrin activation is crucial for numerous cellular responses, including cell adhesion, migration, and survival. Recent studies in mice have specifically emphasized the vital role of kindlin-3 in integrin activation. Kindlin-3 deficiency in humans also has now been documented and includes symptoms of bleeding, frequent infections, and osteopetrosis, which are consequences of an inability to activate beta1, beta2, and beta3 integrins. To date, kindlin-3 was thought to be restricted to hematopoietic cells. In this article, we demonstrate that kindlin-3 is present in human endothelial cells derived from various anatomical origins. The mRNA and protein for KINDLIN-3 was detected in endothelial cells by reverse transcription-PCR and Western blots. When subjected to sequencing by mass spectrometry, the protein was identified as authentic kindlin-3 and unequivocally distinguished from KINDLIN-1 and KINDLIN-2 or any other known protein. By quantitative real time PCR, the level of kindlin-3 in endothelial cells was 20-50% of that of kindlin-2. Using knockdown approaches, we show that kindlin-3 plays a role in integrin-mediated adhesion of endothelial cells. This function depends upon the integrin and substrate and is distinct from that of kindlin-2. Formation of tube-like structures in Matrigel also was impaired by kindlin-3 knockdown. Mechanistically, the distinct functions of the kindlins can be traced to differences in their subcellular localization in integrin-containing adhesion structures. Thus, the prevailing view that individual kindlins exert their functions in a cell type-specific manner must now be modified to consider distinct functions of the different family members within the same cell type."
https://openalex.org/W2020134095,"Background Evidence increasingly shows that stream ecosystems greatly contribute to global carbon fluxes. This involves a tight coupling between biofilms, the dominant form of microbial life in streams, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC), a very significant pool of organic carbon on Earth. Yet, the interactions between microbial biodiversity and the molecular diversity of resource use are poorly understood. Methodology/Principal Findings Using six 40-m-long streamside flumes, we created a gradient of streambed landscapes with increasing spatial flow heterogeneity to assess how physical heterogeneity, inherent to streams, affects biofilm diversity and DOC use. We determined bacterial biodiversity in all six landscapes using 16S-rRNA fingerprinting and measured carbon uptake from glucose and DOC experimentally injected to all six flumes. The diversity of DOC molecules removed from the water was determined from ultrahigh-resolution Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS). Bacterial beta diversity, glucose and DOC uptake, and the molecular diversity of DOC use all increased with increasing flow heterogeneity. Causal modeling and path analyses of the experimental data revealed that the uptake of glucose was largely driven by physical processes related to flow heterogeneity, whereas biodiversity effects, such as complementarity, most likely contributed to the enhanced uptake of putatively recalcitrant DOC compounds in the streambeds with higher flow heterogeneity. Conclusions/Significance Our results suggest biophysical mechanisms, including hydrodynamics and microbial complementarity effects, through which physical heterogeneity induces changes of resource use and carbon fluxes in streams. These findings highlight the importance of fine-scale streambed heterogeneity for microbial biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in streams, where homogenization and loss of habitats increasingly reduce biodiversity."
https://openalex.org/W1995299733,"Evolution of resistance by target pests is the main threat to the long-term efficacy of crops expressing Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) insecticidal proteins. Cry2 proteins play a pivotal role in current Bt spray formulations and transgenic crops and they complement Cry1A proteins because of their different mode of action. Their presence is critical in the control of those lepidopteran species, such as Helicoverpa spp., which are not highly susceptible to Cry1A proteins. In Australia, a transgenic variety of cotton expressing Cry1Ac and Cry2Ab (Bollgard II) comprises at least 80% of the total cotton area. Prior to the widespread adoption of Bollgard II, the frequency of alleles conferring resistance to Cry2Ab in field populations of Helicoverpa armigera and Helicoverpa punctigera was significantly higher than anticipated. Colonies established from survivors of F(2) screens against Cry2Ab are highly resistant to this toxin, but susceptible to Cry1Ac.Bioassays performed with surface-treated artificial diet on neonates of H. armigera and H. punctigera showed that Cry2Ab resistant insects were cross-resistant to Cry2Ae while susceptible to Cry1Ab. Binding analyses with (125)I-labeled Cry2Ab were performed with brush border membrane vesicles from midguts of Cry2Ab susceptible and resistant insects. The results of the binding analyses correlated with bioassay data and demonstrated that resistant insects exhibited greatly reduced binding of Cry2Ab toxin to midgut receptors, whereas no change in (125)I-labeled-Cry1Ac binding was detected. As previously demonstrated for H. armigera, Cry2Ab binding sites in H. punctigera were shown to be shared by Cry2Ae, which explains why an alteration of the shared binding site would lead to cross-resistance between the two Cry2A toxins.This is the first time that a mechanism of resistance to the Cry2 class of insecticidal proteins has been reported. Because we found the same mechanism of resistance in multiple strains representing several field populations, we conclude that target site alteration is the most likely means that field populations evolve resistance to Cry2 proteins in Helicoverpa spp. Our work also confirms the presence in the insect midgut of specific binding sites for this class of proteins. Characterizing the Cry2 receptors and their mutations that enable resistance could lead to the development of molecular tools to monitor resistance in the field."
https://openalex.org/W1999401647,"Differentiation of embryonic stem (ES) cells is accompanied by silencing of the Oct-4 gene and de novo DNA methylation of its regulatory region. Previous studies have focused on the requirements for promoter region methylation. We therefore undertook to analyse the progression of DNA methylation of the ∼2000 base pair regulatory region of Oct-4 in ES cells that are wildtype or deficient for key proteins. We find that de novo methylation is initially seeded at two discrete sites, the proximal enhancer and distal promoter, spreading later to neighboring regions, including the remainder of the promoter. De novo methyltransferases Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b cooperate in the initial targeted stage of de novo methylation. Efficient completion of the pattern requires Dnmt3a and Dnmt1, but not Dnmt3b. Methylation of the Oct-4 promoter depends on the histone H3 lysine 9 methyltransferase G9a, as shown previously, but CpG methylation throughout most of the regulatory region accumulates even in the absence of G9a. Analysis of the Oct-4 regulatory domain as a whole has allowed us to detect targeted de novo methylation and to refine our understanding the roles of key protein components in this process."
https://openalex.org/W2086012088,"Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) has appeared to be of importance for prokaryotic species evolution. As a consequence numerous parametric methods, using only the information embedded in the genomes, have been designed to detect HGTs. Numerous reports of incongruencies in results of the different methods applied to the same genomes were published. The use of artificial genomes in which all HGT parameters are controlled allows testing different methods in the same conditions. The results of this benchmark concerning 16 representative parametric methods showed a great variety of efficiencies. Some methods work very poorly whatever the type of HGTs and some depend on the conditions or on the metrics used. The best methods in terms of total errors were those using tetranucleotides as criterion for the window methods or those using codon usage for gene based methods and the Kullback-Leibler divergence metric. Window methods are very sensitive but less specific and detect badly lone isolated gene. On the other hand gene based methods are often very specific but lack of sensitivity. We propose using two methods in combination to get the best of each category, a gene based one for specificity and a window based one for sensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W2047132989,"Background Systematic reviews (SRs) should be up to date to maintain their importance in informing healthcare policy and practice. However, little guidance is available about when and how to update SRs. Moreover, the updating policies and practices of organizations that commission or produce SRs are unclear. Methodology/Principal Findings The objective was to describe the updating practices and policies of agencies that sponsor or conduct SRs. An Internet-based survey was administered to a purposive non-random sample of 195 healthcare organizations within the international SR community. Survey results were analyzed using descriptive statistics. The completed response rate was 58% (n = 114) from across 26 countries with 70% (75/107) of participants identified as producers of SRs. Among responders, 79% (84/107) characterized the importance of updating as high or very-high and 57% (60/106) of organizations reported to have a formal policy for updating. However, only 29% (35/106) of organizations made reference to a written policy document. Several groups (62/105; 59%) reported updating practices as irregular, and over half (53/103) of organizational respondents estimated that more than 50% of their respective SRs were likely out of date. Authors of the original SR (42/106; 40%) were most often deemed responsible for ensuring SRs were current. Barriers to updating included resource constraints, reviewer motivation, lack of academic credit, and limited publishing formats. Most respondents (70/100; 70%) indicated that they supported centralization of updating efforts across institutions or agencies. Furthermore, 84% (83/99) of respondents indicated they favoured the development of a central registry of SRs, analogous to efforts within the clinical trials community. Conclusions/Significance Most organizations that sponsor and/or carry out SRs consider updating important. Despite this recognition, updating practices are not regular, and many organizations lack a formal written policy for updating SRs. This research marks the first baseline data available on updating from an organizational perspective."

EhCPs are encoded by 50 genes, of which ehcp4 (ehcp-a4) is the most up-regulated during invasion and colonization in a mouse cecal model of amebiasis. Up-regulation of ehcp4 in vivo correlated with our finding that co-culture of E. histolytica trophozoites with mucin-producing T84 cells increased ehcp4 expression up to 6-fold. We have expressed recombinant EhCP4, which was autocatalytically activated at acidic pH but had highest proteolytic activity at neutral pH. In contrast to the other amebic cysteine proteinases characterized so far, which have a preference for arginine in the P2 position, EhCP4 displayed a unique preference for valine and isoleucine at P2. This preference was confirmed by homology modeling, which revealed a shallow, hydrophobic S2 pocket. Endogenous EhCP4 localized to cytoplasmic vesicles, the nuclear region, and perinuclear endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Following co-culture with colonic cells, EhCP4 appeared in acidic vesicles and was released extracellularly. A specific vinyl sulfone inhibitor, WRR605, synthesized based on the substrate specificity of EhCP4, inhibited the recombinant enzyme in vitro and significantly reduced parasite burden and inflammation in the mouse cecal model.

Demosponges of the order Dictyoceratida are particularly challenging to identify, but are of ecological as well as biochemical importance. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we apply DNA barcoding with the standard CO1-barcoding marker on selected Indo-Pacific specimens of two genera, Ircinia and Psammocinia of the family Irciniidae. We show that the CO1 marker identifies several species new to science, reveals separate radiation patterns of deep-sea Ircinia sponges and indicates dispersal patterns of Psammocinia species. However, some species cannot be unambiguously barcoded by solely this marker due to low evolutionary rates. Conclusions/Significance We support previous suggestions for a combination of the standard CO1 fragment with an additional fragment for sponge DNA barcoding."

Adjusting the relative dipole orientation of the luminescent protein's chromophores improved the dynamic range of BRET signal change in BRAC up to 60%, which is the largest dynamic range among BRET-based indicators reported so far. Using BRAC, we demonstrated successful visualization of Ca(2+) dynamics at the single-cell level with temporal resolution at 1 Hz. Moreover, BRAC signals were acquired by ratiometric imaging capable of canceling out Ca(2+)-independent signal drifts due to change in cell shape, focus shift, etc.The brightness and large dynamic range of BRAC should facilitate high-sensitive Ca(2+) imaging not only in single live cells but also in small living subjects."

Our data suggest that Gln3 and Gat1 localizations are controlled by two different regulatory pathways. Gln3 localization predominantly responds to intracellular nitrogen levels, as reflected by its stronger NCR-sensitivity, weaker response to Rap treatment, and strong response to methionine sulfoximine (Msx, a glutamine synthetase inhibitor). In contrast, Gat1 localization predominantly responds to TorC1 regulation as reflected by its weaker NCR sensitivity, stronger response to Rap, and immunity to the effects of Msx. Nuclear Gln3 localization in proline-grown (nitrogen limited) cells exhibits no requirement for Pph21/22-Tpd3/Cdc55, whereas nuclear Gat1 localization under these conditions is absolutely dependent on Pph21/22-Tpd3/Cdc55. Furthermore, the extent to which Pph21/22-Tpd3-Cdc55 is required for the TorC1 pathway (Rap) to induce nuclear Gat1 localization is regulated in parallel with Pph21/22-Tpd3-Cdc55-dependent Gln3 dephosphorylation and NCR-sensitive transcription, being highest in limiting nitrogen and lowest when nitrogen is in excess.

Both Sit4 and each PP2A catalytic subunit can also associate with the phosphorylated form of Tor-associated protein, Tap42; TorC1 phosphorylates Tap42 under conditions of nitrogen excess but not starvation (31Di Como C.J.

In nitrogen excess, the Tap42-phosphatase complexes are bound to TorC1 and are inactive.

Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar, 19Bertram P.G. Choi J.H. Carvalho J. Ai W. Zeng C. Chan T.F. Zheng X.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35727-35733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar); (iii) methionine sulfoximine (Msx), a glutamine synthetase inhibitor, elicited nuclear Gln3-Myc13 localization and increased NCR-sensitive transcription leading to the conclusion that “Tor-controlled transcription activators Gln3, Rtg1, and Rtg3 (Rtg1/3 activate retrograde gene expression) are regulated in response to intracellular levels of glutamine” (35Crespo J.L. Powers T. Fowler B. Hall M.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 6784-6789Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Working from the above engaging model, we made seven observations suggesting that Tor regulation of GATA factor localization and NCR-sensitive transcription might be more complicated than initially appreciated and outlined above. (i) The nitrogen source in which cells grow determines whether or not rapamycin can induce Rtg1/3-dependent transcription, i.e. induction is high in ammonia-grown cells and undetectable in proline- or glutamate-grown cells (40Tate J.J.

(ii) Observable Gln3-Myc13 phosphorylation levels do not correlate with the quality or quantity of the nitrogen source provided or the intracellular localization of Gln3-Myc13, i.e. Gln3-Myc13 is hyperphosphorylated in nitrogen-starved, proline-grown, or methionine sulfoximine-treated cells but hypophosphorylated in rapamycin-treated cells. Yet Gln3-Myc13 is nuclear in all four cases (43Tate J.J. Rai R. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280 (Correction (2007) J. Biol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 10270-10278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). (iii) Sit4-dependent Gln3-Myc13 dephosphorylation is greater in glutamine-than proline-grown cells (46Tate J.J. Feller A. Dubois E. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37980-37992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar); i.e. Sit4 is most active toward Gln3 under conditions where it would be expected to be least active according to the initial model (18Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). (iv) Pph21/22-Tpd3-Cdc55/Rts1-dependent Gln3-Myc13 dephosphorylation responds to the nitrogen supply in the same way as NCR-sensitive transcription; i.e. it is greatest with proline as the nitrogen source and least in glutamine-grown cells (47Tate J.J. Georis I. Feller A. Dubois E. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 2522-2534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). (v) In the absence of Pph21/22-Tpd3-Cdc55/Rts1 activity, Gln3-Myc13, which is dephosphorylated to the same level as in glutamine-grown, rapamycin-treated wild type cells, remains localized to the cytoplasm (47Tate J.J. Georis I. Feller A. Dubois E. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 2522-2534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). (vi) nuclear targeting of Gln3-Myc13 alone is insufficient for its recruitment to the DAL5 promoter (48Georis I. Tate J.J. Cooper T.G. Dubois E. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 8919-8929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). (vii) Gln3-Myc13 is not uniformly distributed in the cytoplasm of cells grown under repressive conditions but is associated with a cytoplasmic membrane system (49Cox K.H. Tate J.J. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37559-37566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 50Cox K.H. Tate J.J. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19294-19301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Extending this observation, nuclear Gln3 localization in derepressive conditions was found to require several components that participate in Golgi-to-endosome vesicle transport (51Puria R. Zurita-Martinez S.A. Cardenas M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 7194-7199Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These observations have successively led us to systematically analyze conditions affecting GATA factor phosphorylation, localization, and NCR-sensitive transcription. Work to this point has provided a detailed view of conditions and phosphatase requirements affecting the intracellular localization of Gln3-Myc13. Unfortunately, similar information for Gat1 was lacking except for the observations that rapamycin treatment did not demonstrably affect the electrophoretic mobility of Gat1-Myc13 (44Kulkarni A. Buford T.D. Rai R. Cooper T.G. FEMS Yeast Res. 2006; 6: 218-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and rapamycin-induced nuclear Gat1-Myc13 localization occurred similarly in wild type and sit4Δ cells (48Georis I. Tate J.J. Cooper T.G. Dubois E. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 8919-8929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To fill this significant gap in our knowledge of GATA factor regulation, we analyzed Gat1 localization in a manner that paralleled our earlier studies of Gln3. Experiments described below demonstrate that Gln3 and Gat1 localizations are controlled by two different regulatory pathways. Gln3 localization predominantly responds to intracellular nitrogen levels, as reflected by its stronger NCR sensitivity, weaker response to rapamycin-treatment, and strong response to Msx. In contrast, Gat1 localization predominantly responds to TorC1 regulation as reflected by its weaker NCR sensitivity, stronger response to rapamycin, and immunity to the effects of Msx. Nuclear Gat1 localization in proline-grown (limiting nitrogen) cells is absolutely dependent on Pph21/22-Tpd3-Cdc55, whereas nuclear Gln3 localization exhibits no requirement for Pph21/22-Tpd3-Cdc55 under these conditions. Furthermore, the extent to which Pph21/22-Tpd3-Cdc55 is required for the TorC1 pathway (rapamycin treatment) to induce nuclear Gat1 localization is regulated in parallel with Pph21/22-Tpd3-Cdc55-dependent Gln3 dephosphorylation and NCR-sensitive transcription; it is highest in limiting nitrogen and lowest when nitrogen is in excess. Together these data permit us to draw a consistent picture of intracellular GATA factor localization in response to the nature of the nitrogen source (NCR-sensitive regulation) that differs from the response to TorC1 pathway (rapamycin-induced) regulation. They also suggest that nitrogen source-dependent (NCR-sensitive) control of Pph21/22-Tpd3-Cdc55 regulates the ability of Gat1 localization to respond to rapamycin. S. cerevisiae strains used in this work are listed in Table 1 and are isogenic to wild type TB50. Their construction was described earlier (47Tate J.J. Georis I. Feller A. Dubois E. Cooper T.G. J.

Cells were cultured to mid-log phase (A600 nm = 0.5) in 50 ml of YNB (yeast nitrogen base without amino acids or nitrogen) minimal medium containing the indicated nitrogen sources at a final concentration of 0.1% unless indicated otherwise. Supplements were added to the medium to cover auxotrophic requirements as described earlier (45Cox K.H. Kulkarni A. Tate J.J. Cooper T.G. J. Biol.

Results were recorded on Kodak BioMax XAR film using a wide range of exposures to ensure that all minor species were detected. Films were then digitally photographed, and the images were assembled for publication; gamma settings (Adobe Photoshop) of the photographic images were not changed. Intracellular Gat1 localization was determined by Gat1-GFP fluorescence. This method was chosen in preference to indirect immunofluorescence of Gat1-Myc13 for two reasons. First, it permitted real time collection of localization data, which was necessitated by the fact that the time course of rapamycin-induced intracellular Gat1-GFP movement varied considerably in different mutants. Second, this method minimized variations due to cell manipulation and potential generation of fixation artifacts. A 3–4-μl sample was taken from the growing culture and directly transferred to a slide, and two microscopic images were collected as quickly as possible (Fig. 1A). These images were routinely completed within 90–100 and 130–160 s of sampling, respectively. The time required for further collection of images under some but not all conditions resulted in the appearance of artifacts. Culture sampling for all conditions was initiated before rapamycin addition and continued thereafter for 30 or more min (Fig. 1A). Although data obtained with these methods were relatively similar to those obtained via formalin fixation and indirect immunofluorescence of Gat1-Myc13, their precision and immunity to artifacts that can occur as a result of cell handling or sample fixation (53Tate J.J. Cooper T.G. FEMS Yeast Res. 2008; 8: 1223-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) were greater. Images (subsequently designated, primary images) were collected at room temperature using a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope equipped with a 63×/1.40 Plan-Aprochromat oil objective, a Zeiss Axio camera, and Zeiss Axiovision 3.0 software. Primary, unaltered .zvi files (Zeiss) were converted to .tif files and processed for publication using Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator software. Gamma settings of microscopic images presented in this work were in most cases unaltered; changes were made to the black and white set points exclusively to decrease background fluorescence. On those occasions when gamma settings were changed, it was done conservatively and only when necessary to avoid loss of detail relative to what was observed in the microscope; all changes were applied uniformly to the image presented and as similarly as possible from one image panel to another. In contrast, only primary, unaltered .zvi file images were used for scoring intracellular distributions as described below. A comprehensive description of intracellular Gat1-GFP localization and movement cannot be adequately achieved from one or two subjectively selected images of microscopic fields containing 4–8 cells. Therefore, we manually scored all of the cells in the two images collected from each culture sample. Scoring was performed using primary, unaltered .zvi file images and Zeiss AxioVision 4.6.3 software. Cells were classified into one of three categories: (i) cytoplasmic (cytoplasmic Gat1-GFP fluorescence only; examples in Fig. 1B, panels A and B), (ii) nuclear-cytoplasmic (Gat1-GFP fluorescence in the cytoplasm and additionally Gat1-GFP fluorescence in a clearly delimited structure similar to one in which Gat1-Myc13 (indirect immunofluorescence (44Kulkarni A.

https://openalex.org/W2152232384,"Many clinical isolates of the human pathogen Neisseria gonorrhoeae contain conjugative plasmids. The host range of these plasmids is limited to Neisseria species, but presence of a tetracycline (tetM) determinant inserted in several of these plasmids is an important cause of the rapid spread of tetracycline resistance. Previously plasmids with different backbones (Dutch and American type backbones) and with and without different tetM determinants (Dutch and American type tetM determinants) have been identified. Within the isolates tested, all plasmids with American or Dutch type tetM determinants contained a Dutch type plasmid backbone. This demonstrated that tetM determinants should not be used to differentiate between conjugal plasmid backbones. The nucleotide sequences of conjugative plasmids with Dutch type plasmid backbones either not containing the tetM determinant (pEP5233) or containing Dutch (pEP5289) or American (pEP5050) type tetM determinants were determined. Analysis of the backbone sequences showed that they belong to a novel IncP1 subfamily divergent from the IncP1α, β, γ, δ and ε subfamilies. The tetM determinants were inserted in a genetic load region found in all these plasmids. Insertion was accompanied by the insertion of a gene with an unknown function, and rearrangement of a toxin/antitoxin gene cluster. The genetic load region contains two toxin/antitoxins of the Zeta/Epsilon toxin/antitoxin family previously only found in Gram positive organisms and the virulence associated protein D of the VapD/VapX toxin/antitoxin family. Remarkably, presence of VapX of pJD1, a small cryptic neisserial plasmid, in the acceptor strain strongly increased the conjugation efficiency, suggesting that it functions as an antitoxin for the conjugative plasmid. The presence of the toxin and antitoxin on different plasmids might explain why the host range of this IncP1 plasmid is limited to Neisseria species. The isolated plasmids conjugated efficiently between N. gonorrhoeae strains, but did not enhance transfer of a genetic marker."
https://openalex.org/W2157539728,"The growth hormone (GH)-insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) axis regulates somatic growth during childhood and orchestrates tissue repair throughout the life span. Recently described inactivating mutations in Stat5b in humans with impaired growth have focused attention on this transcription factor as a key agent linking GH-stimulated signals to IGF-I gene expression, and several putative Stat5b sites have been identified in the IGF-I gene. Here, we define and characterize potential GH- and Stat5b-activated chromosomal enhancers that can regulate IGF-I gene transcription. Of 89 recognizable Stat5 sequences in 200 kb centering on the rat IGF-I gene, 22 resided within conserved regions and/or were identical among different species. Only 15 of these sites, organized into 7 distinct domains, were found to bind Stat5b by quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation assays in liver chromatin of rats, but only after acute GH treatment. These sites could bind Stat5b in vitro, and individual domains could mediate GH- and Stat5b-stimulated IGF-I promoter activity in cultured cells. Further analyses revealed that four Stat5b domains possessed chromatin signatures of enhancers, including binding of co-activators p300 and Med1, and RNA polymerase II. These modifications preceded GH-stimulated recruitment of Stat5b, as did lysine 4 monomethylation of histone H3, which was enriched in 6/7 Stat5b-binding elements. In contrast, histone acetylation was induced by GH but was limited to Stat5b binding domains found within the IGF-I transcription unit. We conclude that GH stimulates recruitment of Stat5b to multiple dispersed regions within the igf1 locus, including several with properties consistent with long range transcriptional enhancers that collectively regulate GH-activated IGF-I gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1976823472,"5T4 oncofetal molecules are highly expressed during development and upregulated in cancer while showing only low levels in some adult tissues. Upregulation of 5T4 expression is a marker of loss of pluripotency in the early differentiation of embryonic stem (ES) cells and forms an integrated component of an epithelial-mesenchymal transition, a process important during embryonic development and metastatic spread of epithelial tumors. Investigation of the transcriptional changes in early ES differentiation showed upregulation of CXCL12 and down-regulation of a cell surface protease, CD26, which cleaves this chemokine. CXCL12 binds to the widely expressed CXCR4 and regulates key aspects of development, stem cell motility and tumour metastasis to tissues with high levels of CXCL12. We show that the 5T4 glycoprotein is required for optimal functional cell surface expression of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 and CXCL12 mediated chemotaxis in differentiating murine embryonic stem cells and embryo fibroblasts (MEF). Cell surface expression of 5T4 and CXCR4 molecules is co-localized in differentiating ES cells and MEF. By contrast, differentiating ES and MEF derived from 5T4 knockout (KO) mice show only intracellular CXCR4 expression but infection with adenovirus encoding mouse 5T4 restores CXCL12 chemotaxis and surface co-localization with 5T4 molecules. A series of chimeric constructs with interchanged domains of 5T4 and the glycoprotein CD44 were used to map the 5T4 sequences relevant for CXCR4 membrane expression and function in 5T4KO MEF. These data identified the 5T4 transmembrane domain as sufficient and necessary to enable CXCR4 cell surface expression and chemotaxis. Furthermore, some monoclonal antibodies against m5T4 can inhibit CXCL12 chemotaxis of differentiating ES cells and MEF which is not mediated by simple antigenic modulation. Collectively, these data support a molecular interaction of 5T4 and CXCR4 occurring at the cell surface which directly facilitates the biological response to CXCL12. The regulation of CXCR4 surface expression by 5T4 molecules is a novel means to control responses to the chemokine CXCL12 for example during embryogenesis but can also be selected to advantage the spread of a 5T4 positive tumor from its primary site."
https://openalex.org/W2008733261,"Xenotropic murine leukemia-related retrovirus (XMRV) is a recently discovered retrovirus that has been linked to human prostate cancer and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Both diseases affect a large fraction of the world population, with prostate cancer affecting one in six men, and CFS affecting an estimated 0.4 to 1% of the population.Forty-five compounds, including twenty-eight drugs approved for use in humans, were evaluated against XMRV replication in vitro. We found that the retroviral integrase inhibitor, raltegravir, was potent and selective against XMRV at submicromolar concentrations, in MCF-7 and LNCaP cells, a breast cancer and prostate cancer cell line, respectively. Another integrase inhibitor, L-000870812, and two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, zidovudine (ZDV), and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) also inhibited XMRV replication. When combined, these drugs displayed mostly synergistic effects against this virus, suggesting that combination therapy may delay or prevent the selection of resistant viruses.If XMRV proves to be a causal factor in prostate cancer or CFS, these discoveries may allow for rational design of clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W2012397349,"Background Members of swarming bacterial consortia compete for nutrients but also use a co-operation mechanism called quorum sensing (QS) that relies on chemical signals as well as other secreted products (“public goods”) necessary for swarming. Deleting various genes of this machinery leads to cheater mutants impaired in various aspects of swarming cooperation. Methodology/Principal Findings Pairwise consortia made of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, its QS mutants as well as B. cepacia cells show that a interspecies consortium can “combine the skills” of its participants so that the strains can cross together barriers that they could not cross alone. In contrast, deleterious mutants are excluded from consortia either by competition or by local population collapse. According to modeling, both scenarios are the consequence of the QS signalling mechanism itself. Conclusion/Significance The results indirectly explain why it is an advantage for bacteria to maintain QS systems that can cross-talk among different species, and conversely, why certain QS mutants which can be abundant in isolated niches, cannot spread and hence remain localized."
https://openalex.org/W2073777893,"The glutamate transporter excitatory amino acid carrier 1 (EAAC1) catalyzes the co-transport of three Na(+) ions, one H(+) ion, and one glutamate molecule into the cell, in exchange for one K(+) ion. Na(+) binding to the glutamate-free form of the transporter generates a high affinity binding site for glutamate and is thus required for transport. Moreover, sodium binding to the transporters induces a basal anion conductance, which is further activated by glutamate. Here, we used the [Na(+)] dependence of this conductance as a read-out of Na(+) binding to the substrate-free transporter to study the impact of a highly conserved amino acid residue, Thr(101), in transmembrane domain 3. The apparent affinity of substrate-free EAAC1 for Na(+) was dramatically decreased by the T101A but not by the T101S mutation. Interestingly, in further contrast to EAAC1(WT), in the T101A mutant this [Na(+)] dependence was biphasic. This behavior can be explained by assuming that the binding of two Na(+) ions prior to glutamate binding is required to generate a high affinity substrate binding site. In contrast to the dramatic effect of the T101A mutation on Na(+) binding, other properties of the transporter, such as its ability to transport glutamate, were impaired but not eliminated. Our results are consistent with the existence of a cation binding site deeply buried in the membrane and involving interactions with the side chain oxygens of Thr(101) and Asp(367). A theoretical valence screening approach confirms that the predicted site of cation interaction has the potential to be a novel, so far undetected sodium binding site."

IntroductionIn all eukaryotes, nascent secretory and membrane proteins synthesized at the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 6The abbreviations used are: ERendoplasmic reticulumGUSβ-glucuronidaseMIR motifmotif conserved between protein O-mannosyltransferase, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor, and ryanodine receptorMSMurashige and Skoog saltsUPRunfolded protein responseWTwild-typeDTTdithiothreitolMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidHAhemagglutininSDFstromal cell-derived factorCNXcalnexinCRTcalreticulinr.m.s.root mean square. are translocated, potentially glycosylated, and soon begin to fold with the assistance of molecular chaperones and other folding factors. Many ER-resident proteins are folding and assembly helpers that keep back the newly synthesized proteins in the ER until the correct conformations have been reached. Once nascent proteins fail to fold or assemble properly they accumulate in the ER. This increase of misfolded proteins is perceived as ER stress, triggering a complex protective response, termed the unfolded protein response (UPR) (1Anelli T. Sitia R. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 315-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 2Vitale A. Boston R.S. Traffic. 2008; 9: 1581-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar).UPR is conserved in eukaryotic organisms. Studies in animals have revealed that induction of the UPR is mediated through the transmembrane kinase, inositol-requiring enzyme-1 (IRE1α/IRE1β) and other sensors, namely activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) and protein kinase-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) (3Ron D. Walter P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4773) Google Scholar). The ER luminal domains of IRE1α/IRE1β, ATF6, and PERK, interact with an abundant ER chaperone of the Hsp70 family, the immunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein (BiP) and form inactive sensor complexes. When unfolded proteins begin to accumulate within the ER, BiP is released. As a result, all three sensors enhance the expression of UPR target genes, including genes encoding ER chaperones and other folding helpers to increase overall protein folding and assembly efficiencies within the ER (2Vitale A.

Moreover, PERK activity attenuates translation to adapt the secretory pathway to ER loading. UPR further induces ER-associated protein degradation to dispose of misfolded proteins, and when all other measures fail, apoptotic cell death is activated (2Vitale A. Boston R.S. Traffic. 2008; 9: 1581-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 3Ron D. Walter P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4773) Google Scholar).In all eukaryotes, the most prominent phenomenon induced by the UPR is the transcriptional induction of ER chaperone and protein-folding genes (1Anelli T. Sitia R. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 315-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 4Urade R. FEBS. J. 2007; 274: 1152-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). ER chaperones and protein-folding proteins can be grouped in different classes according to their specificity (1Anelli T. Sitia R. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 315-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). The N-glycan-dependent quality control mechanism of glycoprotein folding, also referred to as calnexin/calreticulin cycle, depends on the presence of both monoglucosylated N-linked glycans and unfolded regions in nascent glycoproteins (5Caramelo J.J. Parodi A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 10221-10225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The second major ER chaperone system depends on the presence of unfolded regions in proteins containing hydrophobic residues, which are recognized by BiP (1Anelli T. Sitia R. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 315-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, BiP can associate with several ER-proteins including stromal cell-derived factor2-like1 (SDF2L1) to form a large ER-localized multiprotein complex suggesting an ER network of chaperones and folding enzymes (6Meunier L. Usherwood Y.K. Chung K.T. Hendershot L.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 4456-4469Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Whereas the molecular functions of most factors are well characterized, SDF2L1 presents a remarkable exception. SDF2L1 and its homolog SDF2 have been identified in mouse and humans (7Fukuda S. Sumii M. Masuda Y. Takahashi M. Koike N. Teishima J. Yasumoto H. Itamoto T. Asahara T. Dohi K. Kamiya K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

These include A23187, a calcium ionophore, and tunicamycin, an inhibitor of protein N-glycosylation. Mouse SDF2L1 associates in vitro with BiP, the Hsp40 ERj3p and other folding enzymes even in the absence of high amounts of misfolded proteins (6Meunier L. Usherwood Y.K. Chung K.T. Hendershot L.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 4456-4469Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 9Bies C. Blum R. Dudek J. Nastainczyk W. Oberhauser S. Jung M. Zimmermann R. Biol. Chem. 2004; 385: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However in mammals it is not known whether SDF2L1 is crucial for ER quality control and the UPR in vivo because no corresponding mutants have been described.SDF2-type proteins are conserved in the animal and plant kingdoms. Recently it was shown that loss of the SDF2L1 homologue from Arabidopsis thaliana results in ER retention and degradation of the surface-exposed leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase EFR (10Nekrasov V. Li J. Batoux M. Roux M. Chu Z.H. Lacombe S. Rougon A. Bittel P. Kiss-Papp M. Chinchilla D. van Esse H.P. Jorda L. Schwessinger B. Nicaise V. Thomma B.P. Molina A. Jones J.D. Zipfel C. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 3428-3438Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) suggesting a conserved role of SDF2-type proteins in ER protein quality control of animals and plants. Here we demonstrate that Arabidopsis SDF2 is a crucial target of the plant UPR in vivo and present the three-dimensional crystal structure providing insights into the molecular function of the protein.RESULTSTo analyze whether SDF2-type proteins play a functional role in the UPR, Arabidopsis is an ideal model system because the principal mechanisms of the UPR are conserved between metazoa and plants (2Vitale A. Boston R.S. Traffic. 2008; 9: 1581-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), and Arabidopsis contains only one gene of the SDF2-type (AtSDF2; At2g25110). Sequence analysis of a full-length cDNA clone (U14608) confirmed the predicted structure of 6 exons and 5 introns (GenBankTM accession number NM_128068). The corresponding 218-residue long SDF2 protein shares 55 and 52% overall amino acid sequence similarity with murine/human SDF2 and SDF2L1, respectively.SDF2 Expression Displays a Similar Induction Pattern as Known UPR TranscriptsTo test the role of SDF2 in the plant UPR we analyzed gene expression in Arabidopsis under ER stress in detail. Several studies addressing ER stress and the UPR employ the reducing agent DTT that is known to induce the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER of plants (21Martínez I.M. Chrispeels M.J. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 22Iwata Y. Fedoroff N.V. Koizumi N. Plant Cell. 2008; 20: 3107-3121Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 23Kamauchi S. Nakatani H. Nakano C. Urade R. FEBS. J. 2005; 272: 3461-3476Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). To investigate SDF2 expression upon UPR induction, total RNA was isolated from 6-day-old wild-type (WT) seedlings after incubation with DTT. Semi-quantitative as well as quantitative RT-PCR revealed a ∼3-fold increase of SDF2 expression in response to DTT (Fig. 1, A and B). The expression of SDF2 is similar to those of known molecular Arabidopsis UPR markers such as the ER chaperone of glycoproteins, calreticulin (CRT2) and the ER chaperones of the HSP 70 family BIP1–3 (Fig. 1A). To substantiate SDF2 induction, polyclonal antibodies were generated that specifically recognize the Arabidopsis SDF2 protein (predicted molecular mass, 24 kDa) (Fig. 1C and supplemental Fig. S4D). Immunoblot analyses of microsomal membrane fractions from DTT-treated WT seedlings demonstrated that not only the SDF2 transcript but also the amount of the SDF2 protein highly increases in response to ER stress (Fig. 1C).Because UPR target gene transcripts accumulate in response to ER stress, we examined the promoter activity of SDF2 during DTT treatment at cell- and tissue-specific levels. To this end, we established transgenic reporter plants expressing the β-glucuronidase (GUS) gene under the control of the SDF2 promoter (ProSDF2:GUS). Under normal growth conditions in the early developing seedling ProSDF2:GUS expression was mainly observed in the cotyledons and in meristematic and elongation zones of roots (supplemental Fig. S1A). At later developmental stages ProSDF2:GUS expression was detected in several tissues including vascular bundles and hydathodes of the cotyledons and in meristematic and elongation zones of shoots and primary and lateral roots (supplemental Fig. S1). Under DTT-induced ER stress conditions, SDF2 promoter activity was dramatically increased especially in meristematic and elongation zones of primary and lateral roots (Fig. 1, D and E and supplemental Fig. S2). We observed very similar ProSDF2:GUS expression when tunicamycin, an inhibitor of protein N-glycosylation that results in the inability of proteins to be N-glycosylated and folded correctly, was used to induce the UPR (Fig. 1F and supplemental Fig. S3). In summary, our data show that SDF2 expression is highly responsive to ER stress conditions that interfere with protein folding.SDF2 Is Required for Seedling Development under ER Stress ConditionsTo further access the function of SDF2 in vivo, we analyzed Arabidopsis T-DNA insertion mutants sdf2-2 (SALK_141321; insertion at position bp +294, exon 2), sdf2-5 (WiscDSLox293–293invl23; insertion at position bp +1080, exon 5) and sdf2-6 (SALK_077481; insertion at position bp −294, promoter region) obtained from the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Center (supplemental Fig. S4, A and B). The individual sdf2 mutants were analyzed for SDF2 transcripts by RT-PCR and for the SDF2 protein by immunoblot analysis. Whereas the sdf2-6 mutant line carrying a promoter insertion still displayed reduced levels of SDF2 transcript, no SDF2 transcript was detectable in mutants sdf2-2 and sdf2-5 (supplemental Fig. S4C). Accordingly, detectable but dramatically reduced SDF2 protein levels were found in sdf2-6 mutant seedlings; however, no SDF2 protein was present in extracts of the knock-out mutants, sdf2-2 and sdf2-5 (supplemental Fig. S4D). For all three mutant lines no visible phenotype was observed under normal growth conditions (data not shown). Because our analyses demonstrated SDF2 induction upon perturbation of ER homeostasis, we particularly examined possible DTT and tunicamycin sensitivity of sdf2 mutants. To this end, Arabidopsis WT and mutant seeds were sown on DTT-containing medium. Detailed characterization of the morphological phenotype at day 6 after germination revealed that growth of WT seedlings was retarded in the presence of DTT. Strong inhibition of primary root elongation and formation of root hairs and lateral roots was observed (Fig. 2, A and B). Compared with WT, sdf2-2 and sdf2-5 seedlings showed pronounced growth retardation and in the majority of cases cotyledons failed to expand (Fig. 2, A and B, supplemental Table S2). Hypocotyls and primary roots were extremely short and formation of root hairs and lateral roots was suppressed. The promoter-insertion line sdf2-6 showed a similar but less pronounced phenotype (Fig. 2, A and B, supplemental Table S2). Interestingly, in contrast to both knock-out mutants the majority of sdf2-6 seedlings could overcome growth retardation after a period of up to 18 days but remained pale green compared with WT seedlings (Fig. 2C). In addition, sdf2 mutants showed increased sensitivity toward tunicamycin again sdf2-6 was less affected (supplemental Fig. S5). In contrast, sensitivities toward stress conditions that are not related to ER stress such as salt and osmotic stress were comparable between all three sdf2 mutants and WT seedlings (supplemental Table S2). Taken together, phenotypic characterization of independent mutant alleles revealed that sdf2 mutants are sensitive toward ER stress induced by the accumulation of unfolded proteins. In the absence of sdf2, seeds germinate but seedlings are not able to develop further in the presence of prolonged ER stress conditions. Yet, minor amounts of SDF2 protein allow seedlings to gradually overcome ER stress.FIGURE 2Growth phenotypes of sdf2 mutant seedlings upon DTT treatment.A, root morphology of sdf2 mutants compared with WT. Seedlings were grown on MS medium in the presence or absence of DTT as indicated. After 7 days of growth, seedlings were placed on MS plates for documentation. Bar: 5 mm.

To exclude the possibility that the absence of SDF2 indirectly interferes with the onset of UPR, we analyzed the expression of known molecular UPR markers in the knock-out mutant sdf2-2 in response to DTT treatment. Thereto, total RNA was isolated from 6 day-old seedlings after incubation with DTT and transcripts of CRT2, BIP1/2, and BIP3 were monitored by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 1A, upon DTT treatment the representative UPR marker transcripts accumulated in sdf2-2 mutants to the same extend as in WT Arabidopsis. These results suggest that deletion of SDF2 does not interfere with sensing of ER stress and that normal induction of UPR target genes occurs in the absence of the SDF2 protein. In combination with the fact that SDF2 is significantly induced in the course of the UPR and, that sdf2 seedlings are ER stress hypersensitive our data demonstrate that SDF2 represents a functional target of the UPR in Arabidopsis.SDF2 Is Associated with the Rough ER MembraneTo characterize the SDF2 protein in more detail, we transiently expressed a HA epitope-tagged version in N. benthamiana leaves. Microsomal preparations were fractionated by isopycnic centrifugation on a continuous sucrose density gradient. On sucrose gradients, Mg2+ ions stabilize the rough ER and ER bands are located in the fractions with the highest sucrose density. In the absence of Mg2+ ions, ribosomes dissociate from the ER, shifting ER bands to fractions with lower densities, whereas bands of other compartments are not affected (24Pryme I.F. Mol Cell Biochem. 1986; 71: 3-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analyses of gradient fractions showed that SDF2-HA co-localizes with the protein marker constituents of the rough ER calnexin (CNX) and calreticulin (CRT), and specifically follows those upon depletion of Mg2+ ions (Fig. 3A). Further, soluble and membrane fractions were prepared and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot. As shown in Fig. 3B, the luminal ER protein CRT is exclusively present in the soluble fractions (lower panel). In contrast, SDF2-HA (upper panel) and the ER membrane protein CNX (middle panel) are predominantly found in the membrane fraction. Treatment with 0.5 m KCl resulted in the release of SDF2, but not CNX, from the ER membrane (Fig. 3C). Under low salt conditions, detergent treatment of membranes resulted in the precipitation of SDF2 probably due to the formation of protein aggregates (Fig. 3C). In addition, localization of SDF2 by immunogold electron microscopy (EM) revealed that ER cisternae are intensely labeled in DTT-induced WT seedlings (Fig. 3D and supplemental Fig. S6). In contrast, virtually no labeling is obtained in non-induced WT seedlings and DTT-induced sdf2-2 mutants (supplemental Fig. S6). In summary, our data prove that SDF2 resides in the rough ER, though in contrast to mammalian SDF2L1 (7Fukuda S. Sumii M. Masuda Y. Takahashi M. Koike N. Teishima J. Yasumoto H. Itamoto T. Asahara T. Dohi K. Kamiya K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), Arabidopsis SDF2 does not contain a typical HDEL ER-retention signal (supplemental Fig. S7A).FIGURE 3Subcellular localization of SDF2.A, sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Microsomal membranes derived from tobacco leaves transiently expressing SDF2-HA were fractionated in the presence (+MgCl2) or absence (−MgCl2) of Mg2+ ions. Gradient fractions from top (1) to bottom (13) were analyzed by immunoblot using specific antibodies directed against SDF2-HA, CNX, and CRT (ER marker), and plasma membrane H+-ATPase (PMA) (PM marker). SDF2 co-fractionates in both gradients with the ER marker proteins. B, cell fractionation. Tobacco protoplasts transiently expressing SDF2-HA were fractionated in supernatant (S1) containing cytosol, supernatant (S2) containing microsomal contents and membrane pellet fraction (P) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Protoplast culture medium (M) was concentrated. SDF2-HA was detected by immunoblot with anti-HA antibodies. Endogenous CNX and CRT were detected using specific antibodies. Protoplasts transformed with the empty vector served as control. C, membrane association of SDF2. Arabidopsis microsomal membranes were treated with extraction buffer supplemented with 0.5 m KCl or 1% Triton X-100 (TX-100) as indicated.

In WT plants treated with 2 mm DTT the ER is intensely labeled (arrows). Corresponding control experiments are shown in supplemental Fig. S6.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The Three-dimensional Structure of SDF2 Adopts a β-Trefoil FoldThe SDF2 protein contains three MIR motifs consisting of residues 34–88 (MIR1), 96–151 (MIR2), and 154–208 (MIR3) (supplemental Fig. S7A). The MIR motif is named after three of the proteins in which it occurs: protein O-mannosyltransferase (Pmt), inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R), and ryanodine receptor (RyR) (25Ponting C.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 48-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MIR motifs are often found in multiple copies, which are characteristically arranged in triplet. However, the function of this domain is not clear to date. To learn more about SDF2 and its MIR motifs, we determined its three-dimensional structure. A construct encoding amino acid residues 24–218 of SDF2 was expressed, and the corresponding protein was purified (16Radzimanowski J. Ravaud S. Schott A. Strahl S. Sinning I. Acta Crystallogr Sect. F. Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2010; 66: 12-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The crystal structure was determined by molecular replacement at 1.95 Å resolution (Table 1). The SDF2 structure (residues 35–215) shows the typical β-trefoil fold and consists of 12 β-strands and three 310 helices forming a globular barrel with approximate dimensions 50 × 35 × 30 Å3. The β-strands are arranged into six two-stranded hairpins, three of which form a barrel while the other three form a triangular array capping the top of the barrel (Fig. 4, A and B). The β-trefoil fold is made up of three structural repeats which correspond to the three MIR motifs, giving rise to a pseudo 3-fold symmetry. As expected from the internal sequence similarities the structures of the different repeats are very similar apart from the variable-sized loops connecting the strands. The β-trefoil fold is found in a number of proteins which generally share little or no detectable sequence similarity. Only key hydrophobic residues, essential for maintaining the β-trefoil fold, are invariant among the family members (26Murzin A.G. Lesk A.M. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 531-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). When the sequence conservation of SDF2-type proteins is analyzed, the triangular cap and residues located at the bottom and the middle layers of the β-trefoil core structure give high scores while rather low conservation is observed in the top layer (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, leucine and valine residues of the second and third strand of each MIR motif are highly conserved (Fig. 4A). In SDF2, Leu-54, Leu-116, and Leu-174 form a hydrophobic layer just at the top of the bottom layer of the barrel (supplemental Fig. S7B). Replacement of these leucines by alanines results in unfolding and aggregation of the SDF2 mutant proteins during purification (data not shown), further emphasizing their crucial role in maintaining the β-trefoil structure.FIGURE 4Structure of SDF2.A, protein sequence of SDF2. Location of the 12 β-strands and three 310 helices is depicted. The α-repeat (MIR1 motif) is colored in green, the β-repeat (MIR2 motif) in magenta, and the γ-repeat (MIR3 motif) in blue. Conserved residues at the interior of the β-trefoil barrel arranged in the bottom and middle layers are highlighted in yellow and orange, respectively. Key residues of the triangular cap are highlighted in cyan. B, ribbon representation of the SDF2 structure. The colors are the same as in A. The view on the right is rotated by 180° along a vertical axis with respect to the view on the left. β-strands are labeled. The position of the bottom (b), middle (m), and top layer (t) of the β-trefoil barrel is indicated as well as the conserved valines (tc (V)) and leucines (tc (L)) of the triangular cap. The bottom layer is comprised of residues just underneath the triangular cap, with the middle and top layers lying parallel to it and away from the cap. Figures were generated with PyMOL. C, same view as in B. The molecular surface is colored blue and red according to positive and negative electrostatic potential, respectively. Potential surfaces were calculated with GRASP (46Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5313) Google Scholar). The corresponding IP3 binding site in IP3R and sugar binding site in HA1 are shown on the left panel. The conserved and highly negatively charged region at the MIR2 motif (β-repeat) is contoured on the right panel. D, same view as in B. The degree of sequence conservation within the SDF2 family is mapped onto the surface of SDF2. Dark green and light green indicate residues that are highly or partially conserved, respectively. Conservation scores were determined with the program Consurf (consurf.tau.ac.il) on the basis of 26 sequences. The corresponding IP3 binding site in IP3R, the sugar binding site in HA1 and the conserved and highly negatively charged region at the MIR2 motif are shown as in C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Functional regions were proposed to reside within the loop regions of the β-trefoil family, which are usually not conserved (27Gosavi S.

Altogether the loop regions of SDF2 account for about 70% of the molecular surface. The loops separating the last two β-strands (β3-β4, β7-β8, β11-β12) contain a 310 α helix while the other loops do not adopt a particular structure (Fig. 4A). To probe the presence of potential binding sites within the structure, we analyzed SDF2 structural homologs. Analysis using the Dali server (28Holm L. Sander C. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 653-662Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) indicated that SDF2 presents the highest homology with the hemagglutinin component (HA1) of the progenitor toxin from Clostridium botulinum (29Inoue K. Sobhany M. Transue T.R. Oguma K. Pedersen L.C. Negishi M. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 3361-3370Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) (apart from IP3R and the unknown function protein used for the molecular replacement) (supplemental Fig. S8). HA1 consists of two β-trefoil domains and was shown to interact with carbohydrates containing galactose moieties (29Inoue K. Sobhany M. Transue T.R. Oguma K. Pedersen L.C. Negishi M. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 3361-3370Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). SDF2 superimposed well with the first β-trefoil (r.m.s.d. 2.1 Å, supplemental Fig. S8A) and especially at the level of the carbohydrate binding site identified for HA1 and made of 4 conserved residues (Asp, Asn, Gln, and one aromatic residue) at the α repeat in the triangular cap (Fig. 5). Interestingly, this region corresponds in SDF2 to a conserved and negatively charged patch located at the MIR1 repeat (HA1 region on Fig. 4, C and D). These findings strongly suggest that this region might accommodate a yet unidentified carbohydrate ligand. Further analysis of surface characteristics revealed that SDF2 exhibits another highly conserved and negatively charged region, at the MIR"
https://openalex.org/W2104576729,"Coordinated gene transcript levels across tissues (denoted “gene synchrony”) reflect converging influences of genetic, biochemical and environmental factors; hence they are informative of the biological state of an individual. So could brain gene synchrony also integrate the multiple factors engaged in neuropsychiatric disorders and reveal underlying pathologies? Using bootstrapped Pearson correlation for transcript levels for the same genes across distinct brain areas, we report robust gene transcript synchrony between the amygdala and cingulate cortex in the human postmortem brain of normal control subjects (n = 14; Control/Permutated data, p<0.000001). Coordinated expression was confirmed across distinct prefrontal cortex areas in a separate cohort (n = 19 subjects) and affected different gene sets, potentially reflecting regional network- and function-dependent transcriptional programs. Genewise regional transcript coordination was independent of age-related changes and array technical parameters. Robust shifts in amygdala-cingulate gene synchrony were observed in subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD, denoted here “depression”) (n = 14; MDD/Permutated data, p<0.000001), significantly affecting between 100 and 250 individual genes (10–30% false discovery rate). Biological networks and signal transduction pathways corresponding to the identified gene set suggested putative dysregulated functions for several hormone-type factors previously implicated in depression (insulin, interleukin-1, thyroid hormone, estradiol and glucocorticoids; p<0.01 for association with depression-related networks). In summary, we showed that coordinated gene expression across brain areas may represent a novel molecular probe for brain structure/function that is sensitive to disease condition, suggesting the presence of a distinct and integrated hormone-mediated corticolimbic homeostatic, although maladaptive and pathological, state in major depression."
https://openalex.org/W1985658688,"Background The pathogenesis of Francisella tularensis, the causative agent of tularemia, has been primarily characterized in mice. However, the high degree of sensitivity of mice to bacterial challenge, especially with the human virulent strains of F. tularensis, limits this animal model for screening of defined attenuated vaccine candidates for protection studies. Methods and Findings We analyzed the susceptibility of the Fischer 344 rat to pulmonary (intratracheal) challenge with three different subspecies (subsp) of F. tularensis that reflect different levels of virulence in humans, and characterized the bacterial replication profile in rat bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM). In contrast to the mouse, Fischer 344 rats exhibit a broader range of sensitivity to pulmonary challenge with the human virulent subsp. tularensis and holarctica. Unlike mice, Fischer rats exhibited a high degree of resistance to pulmonary challenge with LVS (an attenuated derivative of subsp. holarctica) and subsp. novicida. Within BMDM, subsp. tularensis and LVS showed minimal replication, subsp. novicida showed marginal replication, and subsp. holartica replicated robustly. The limited intramacrophage replication of subsp. tularensis and novicida strains was correlated with the induction of nitric oxide production. Importantly, Fischer 344 rats that survived pulmonary infection with subsp. novicida were markedly protected against subsequent pulmonary challenge with subsp. tularensis, suggesting that subsp. novicida may be a useful platform for the development of vaccines against subsp. tularensis. Conclusions The Fischer 344 rat exhibits similar sensitivity to F. tularensis strains as that reported for humans, and thus the Fischer 344 ray may serve as a better animal model for tularemia vaccine development."
https://openalex.org/W1607580885,"Sanguinarine reductase is a plant enzyme that prevents the cytotoxic effects of benzophenanthridine alkaloids, which are the main phytoalexins of Papaveraceae. The enzyme catalyzes the reduction of sanguinarine, the most toxic benzophenanthridine, which re-enters the cytoplasm after its primary accumulation in the cell wall region has reached a threshold concentration. We present the sequence of the gene and protein of sanguinarine reductase isolated from cell cultures of Eschscholzia californica. High sequence similarities indicate that the enzyme evolved from a plant-specific branch of the ubiquitous Rossmann fold NAD(P)H/NAD(P)(+) binding reductases, with NADP-dependent epimerases or hydroxysteroid reductases as the most likely ancestors. Based on the x-ray structure of a close homolog, a three-dimensional model of the spatial conformation and catalytic site of sanguinarine reductase was established and used for in silico screening of known three-dimensional structures. Surprisingly, the enzyme shares high structural similarity with enzymes of human and bacterial origin, which have similar functions as the plant homologs but bear little amino acid sequence similarity. Using site-directed mutagenesis, a series of recombinant enzymes was generated and assayed to reveal the impact of individual amino acids and peptides in the catalytic process. It appears that relatively few innovations were required to generate this selective catalyst for alkaloid detoxication, notably an insertion of 13 amino acids and the generation of a novel catalytic triad of Cys-Asp-His were sufficient."
https://openalex.org/W2032596399,"Background Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), a member of the genus Phlebovirus within the family Bunyaviridae, is a negative-stranded RNA virus with a tripartite genome. RVFV is transmitted by mosquitoes and causes fever and severe hemorrhagic illness among humans, while in livestock it causes fever and high abortion rates. Methodology/Principal Findings Sequence analysis showed that a wild-type RVFV ZH501 preparation consisted of two major viral subpopulations, with a single nucleotide heterogeneity at nucleotide 847 of M segment (M847); one had a G residue at M847 encoding glycine in a major viral envelope Gn protein, while the other carried A residue encoding glutamic acid at the corresponding site. Two ZH501-derived viruses, rZH501-M847-G and rZH501-M847-A, carried identical genomic sequences, except that the former and the latter had G and A, respectively, at M847 were recovered by using a reverse genetics system. Intraperitoneal inoculation of rZH501-M847-A into mice caused a rapid and efficient viral accumulation in the sera, livers, spleens, kidneys and brains, and killed most of the mice within 8 days, whereas rZH501-M847-G caused low viremia titers, did not replicate as efficiently as did rZH501-M847-A in these organs, and had attenuated virulence to mice. Remarkably, as early as 2 days postinfection with rZH501-M847-G, the viruses carrying A at M847 emerged and became the major virus population thereafter, while replicating viruses retained the input A residue at M847 in rZH501-M847-A-infected mice. Conclusions/Significance These data demonstrated that the single nucleotide substitution in the Gn protein substantially affected the RVFV mouse virulence and that a virus population carrying the virulent viral genotype quickly emerged and became the major viral population within a few days in mice that were inoculated with the attenuated virus."
https://openalex.org/W2063770443,"Arrow worms (Phylum Chaetognatha) are abundant planktonic organisms and important predators in many food webs; yet, the classification and evolutionary relationships among chaetognath species remain poorly understood. A seemingly simple body plan is underlain by subtle variation in morphological details, obscuring the affinities of species within the phylum. Many species achieve near global distributions, spanning the same latitudinal bands in all ocean basins, while others present disjunct ranges, in some cases with the same species apparently found at both poles. To better understand how these complex evolutionary and geographic variables are reflected in the species makeup of chaetognaths, we analyze DNA barcodes of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase c subunit I (COI) gene, from 52 specimens of 14 species of chaetognaths collected mainly from the Atlantic Ocean. Barcoding analysis was highly successful at discriminating described species of chaetognaths across the phylum, and revealed little geographical structure. This barcode analysis reveals hitherto unseen genetic variation among species of arrow worms, and provides insight into some species relationships of this enigmatic group."
https://openalex.org/W2033450681,"Background YqeH, a circularly permuted GTPase (cpGTPase), which is conserved across bacteria and eukaryotes including humans is important for the maturation of small (30S) ribosomal subunit in Bacillus subtilis. Recently, we have shown that it binds 30S in a GTP/GDP dependent fashion. However, the catalytic machinery employed to hydrolyze GTP is not recognized for any of the cpGTPases, including YqeH. This is because they possess a hydrophobic substitution in place of a catalytic glutamine (present in Ras-like GTPases). Such GTPases were categorized as HAS-GTPases and were proposed to follow a catalytic mechanism, different from the Ras-like proteins. Methodology/Principal Findings MnmE, another HAS-GTPase, but not circularly permuted, utilizes a potassium ion and water mediated interactions to drive GTP hydrolysis. Though the G-domain of MnmE and YqeH share only ∼25% sequence identity, the conservation of characteristic sequence motifs between them prompted us to probe GTP hydrolysis machinery in YqeH, by employing homology modeling in conjunction with biochemical experiments. Here, we show that YqeH too, uses a potassium ion to drive GTP hydrolysis and stabilize the transition state. However, unlike MnmE, it does not dimerize in the transition state, suggesting alternative ways to stabilize switches I and II. Furthermore, we identify a potential catalytic residue in Asp-57, whose recognition, in the absence of structural information, was non-trivial due to the circular permutation in YqeH. Interestingly, when compared with MnmE, helix α2 that presents Asp-57 is relocated towards the N-terminus in YqeH. An analysis of the YqeH homology model, suggests that despite such relocation, Asp-57 may facilitate water mediated catalysis, similarly as the catalytic Glu-282 of MnmE. Indeed, an abolished catalysis by D57I mutant supports this inference. Conclusions/Significance An uncommon means to achieve GTP hydrolysis utilizing a K+ ion has so far been demonstrated only for MnmE. Here, we show that YqeH also utilizes a similar mechanism. While the catalytic machinery is similar in both, mechanistic differences may arise based on the way they are deployed. It appears that K+ driven mechanism emerges as an alternative theme to stabilize the transition state and hydrolyze GTP in a subset of GTPases, such as the HAS-GTPases."
https://openalex.org/W2141151489,"Vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF165 is a critical element for development of the vascular system in physiological and pathological angiogenesis. VEGF isoforms have different affinities for heparan sulphate proteoglycan (HSPG) as well as for VEGF receptors; HSPGs are important regulators in vascular development. Therefore, inhibition of interactions between VEGF and HSPGs may prevent angiogenesis. Here, we demonstrate that an HSPG-binding synthetic peptide, corresponding to exon 6a-encoded domain of VEGF gene, has anti-angiogenic property. This 20 amino acids synthetic peptide prevents VEGF165 binding to several different cell types, mouse embryonic sections and inhibits endothelial cell migration, despite its absence in VEGF165 sequence. Our in vivo anti-tumor studies show that the peptide inhibits tumor growth in both mouse Lewis-Lung Carcinoma and human Liposarcoma tumor-bearing animal models. This is the first evidence that a synthetic VEGF fragment corresponding to exon 6a has functional antagonism both in vitro and in vivo. We conclude that the above HPSG binding peptide (6a-P) is a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis-dependent diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1997080516,"Background A number of studies have assessed ages of parents of children with autistic spectrum disorders (ASD), and reported both maternal and paternal age effects. Here we assess relationships with grandparental ages. Methods and Findings We compared the parental and grandparental ages of children in the population-based Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), according to their scores in regard to 4 autistic trait measures and whether they had been given a diagnosis of ASD. Mean maternal and paternal ages of ASD cases were raised, but this appears to be secondary to a maternal grandmother age effect (P = 0.006): OR = 1.66[95%CI 1.16, 2.37] for each 10-year increase in the grandmother's age at the birth of the mother. Trait measures also revealed an association between the maternal grandmother's age and the major autistic trait–the Coherence Scale (regression coefficient b = 0.142, [95%CI = 0.057, 0.228]P = 0.001). After allowing for confounders the effect size increased to b = 0.217[95%CI 0.125, 0.308](P<0.001) for each 10 year increase in age. Conclusions Although the relationship between maternal grandmother's age and ASD and a major autistic trait was unexpected, there is some biological plausibility, for the maternal side at least, given that the timing of female meiosis I permits direct effects on the grandchild's genome during the grandmother's pregnancy. An alternative explanation is the meiotic mismatch methylation (3 M) hypothesis, presented here for the first time. Nevertheless the findings should be treated as hypothesis generating pending corroborative results from other studies."
https://openalex.org/W2122061899,"The reduced concentration of stratospheric ozone results in an increased flux of biologically damaging mid-ultraviolet radiation (UVB, 280 to 320 nm) reaching earth surfaces. Environmentally relevant levels of UVB negatively impact various natural populations of marine organisms, which is ascribed to suppressed embryonic development by increased radiation.Inspired by strategies in the living systems generated by evolution, we induce an extra UVB-adsorbed coat on the chorion (eggshell surrounding embryo) of zebrafish, during the blastula period. Short and long UV exposure experiments show that the artificial mineral-shell reduces the UV radiation effectively and the enclosed embryos become more robust. In contrast, the uncoated embryos cannot survive under the enhanced UVB condition.We suggest that an engineered shell of functional materials onto biological units can be developed as a strategy to shield lives to counteract negative changes of global environment, or to provide extra protection for the living units in biological research."
https://openalex.org/W2103476517,"Central carbon metabolism (CCM) is a fundamental component of life. The participating genes and enzymes are thought to be structurally and functionally conserved across and within species. Association mapping utilizes a rich history of mutation and recombination to achieve high resolution mapping. Therefore, applying association mapping in maize (Zea mays ssp. mays), the most diverse model crop species, to study the genetics of CCM is a particularly attractive system.We used a maize diversity panel to test the CCM functional conservation. We found heritable variation in enzyme activity for every enzyme tested. One of these enzymes was the NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH, E.C. 1.1.1.41), in which we identified a novel amino-acid substitution in a phylogenetically conserved site. Using candidate gene association mapping, we identified that this non-synonymous polymorphism was associated with IDH activity variation. The proposed mechanism for the IDH activity variation includes additional components regulating protein level. With the comparison of sequences from maize and teosinte (Zea mays ssp. Parviglumis), the maize wild ancestor, we found that some CCM genes had also been targeted for selection during maize domestication.Our results demonstrate the efficacy of association mapping for dissecting natural variation in primary metabolic pathways. The considerable genetic diversity observed in maize CCM genes underlies heritable phenotypic variation in enzyme activities and can be useful to identify putative functional sites."
https://openalex.org/W1965269018,"Background Modeling of cellular functions on the basis of experimental observation is increasingly common in the field of cellular signaling. However, such modeling requires a large amount of quantitative data of signaling events with high spatio-temporal resolution. A novel technique which allows us to obtain such data is needed for systems biology of cellular signaling. Methodology/Principal Findings We developed a fully automatable assay technique, termed quantitative image cytometry (QIC), which integrates a quantitative immunostaining technique and a high precision image-processing algorithm for cell identification. With the aid of an automated sample preparation system, this device can quantify protein expression, phosphorylation and localization with subcellular resolution at one-minute intervals. The signaling activities quantified by the assay system showed good correlation with, as well as comparable reproducibility to, western blot analysis. Taking advantage of the high spatio-temporal resolution, we investigated the signaling dynamics of the ERK pathway in PC12 cells. Conclusions/Significance The QIC technique appears as a highly quantitative and versatile technique, which can be a convenient replacement for the most conventional techniques including western blot, flow cytometry and live cell imaging. Thus, the QIC technique can be a powerful tool for investigating the systems biology of cellular signaling."

Lamins A and C, along with lamin B, are type V intermediate filament proteins which constitute the proteinaceous boundary of the nucleus. LMNA mutations in humans cause a wide range of phenotypes, collectively termed laminopathies. To identify the mutation and investigate the phenotype of a spontaneous, semi-dominant mutation that we have named Disheveled hair and ear (Dhe), which causes a sparse coat and small external ears in heterozygotes and lethality in homozygotes by postnatal day 10.Genetic mapping identified a point mutation in the Lmna gene, causing a single amino acid change, L52R, in the coiled coil rod domain of lamin A and C proteins. Cranial sutures in Dhe/+ mice failed to close. Gene expression for collagen types I and III in sutures was deficient. Skulls were small and disproportionate. Skeletons of Dhe/+ mice were hypomineralized and total body fat was deficient in males. In homozygotes, skin and oral mucosae were dysplastic and ulcerated. Nuclear morphometry of cultured cells revealed gene dose-dependent blebbing and wrinkling.Dhe mice should provide a useful new model for investigations of the pathogenesis of laminopathies."
https://openalex.org/W1559392370,"The mammalian B-cell receptor-associated proteins of 29 and 31 kDa (BAP29 and BAP31) are conserved integral membrane proteins that have reported roles in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) quality control, ER export of secretory cargo, and programmed cell death. In this study we investigated the yeast homologs of BAP29 and BAP31, known as Yet1p and Yet3p, to gain insight on cellular function. We found that Yet1p forms a complex with Yet3p (Yet complex) and that complex assembly was important for subunit stability and proper ER localization. The Yet complex was not efficiently packaged into ER-derived COPII vesicles and therefore does not appear to act as an ER export receptor. Instead, a fraction of the Yet complex was detected in association with the ER translocation apparatus (Sec complex). Specific mutations in the Sec complex or Yet complex influenced these interactions. Moreover, associations between the Yet complex and Sec complex were increased by ER stress and diminished when protein translocation substrates were depleted. Surprisingly, yet1Delta and yet3Delta mutant strains displayed inositol starvation-related growth defects. In accord with the biochemical data, these growth defects were exacerbated by a combination of certain mutations in the Sec complex with yet1Delta or yet3Delta mutations. We propose a model for the Yet-Sec complex interaction that places Yet1p and Yet3p at the translocation pore to manage biogenesis of specific transmembrane secretory proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2035514791,"Pluripotent stem cells produce tissue-specific lineages through programmed acquisition of sequential gene expression patterns that function as a blueprint for organ formation. As embryonic stem cells respond concomitantly to diverse signaling pathways during differentiation, extraction of a pro-cardiogenic network would offer a roadmap to streamline cardiac progenitor output.To resolve gene ontology priorities within precursor transcriptomes, cardiogenic subpopulations were here generated according to either growth factor guidance or stage-specific biomarker sorting. Innate expression profiles were independently delineated through unbiased systems biology mapping, and cross-referenced to filter transcriptional noise unmasking a conserved progenitor motif (55 up- and 233 down-regulated genes). The streamlined pool of 288 genes organized into a core biological network that prioritized the ""Cardiovascular Development"" function. Recursive in silico deconvolution of the cardiogenic neighborhood and associated canonical signaling pathways identified a combination of integrated axes, CXCR4/SDF-1, Flk-1/VEGF and BMP2r/BMP2, predicted to synchronize cardiac specification. In vitro targeting of the resolved triad in embryoid bodies accelerated expression of Nkx2.5, Mef2C and cardiac-MHC, enhanced beating activity, and augmented cardiogenic yield.Transcriptome-wide dissection of a conserved progenitor profile thus revealed functional highways that coordinate cardiogenic maturation from a pluripotent ground state. Validating the bioinformatics algorithm established a strategy to rationally modulate cell fate, and optimize stem cell-derived cardiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2019037501,"Body weight is controlled through peripheral (white adipose tissue) and central (mainly hypothalamus) mechanisms. We have recently obtained evidence that overexpression of interleukin (IL)-7, a critical cytokine involved in lymphopoiesis, can protect against the development of diet-induced obesity in mice. Here we assessed whether IL-7 mediated its effects by modulating hypothalamic function. Acute subcutaneous injection of IL-7 prevented monosodium glutamate-induced obesity, this being correlated with partial protection against cell death in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC). Moreover, we showed that IL-7 activated hypothalamic areas involved in regulation of feeding behavior, as indicated by induction of the activation marker c-Fos in neural cells located in the ventromedial part of the ARC and by inhibition of food intake after fasting. Both chains of the IL-7 receptor (IL-7Rα and γc) were expressed in the ARC and IL-7 injection induced STAT-3 phosphorylation in this area. Finally, we established that IL-7 modulated the expression of neuropeptides that tune food intake, with a stimulatory effect on the expression of pro-opiomelanocortin and an inhibitory effect on agouti-related peptide expression in accordance with IL-7 promoting anorectic effects. These results suggest that the immunomodulatory cytokine IL-7 plays an important and unappreciated role in hypothalamic body weight regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2074510535,"Lentiviral gene transfer can provide long-term expression of therapeutic genes such as erythropoietin. Because overexpression of erythropoietin can be toxic, regulated expression is needed. Doxycycline inducible vectors can regulate expression of therapeutic transgenes efficiently. However, because they express an immunogenic transactivator (rtTA), their utility for gene therapy is limited. In addition to immunogenic proteins that are expressed from inducible vectors, injection of the vector itself is likely to elicit an immune response because viral capsid proteins will induce ""danger signals"" that trigger an innate response and recruit inflammatory cells.We have developed an autoregulatory lentiviral vector in which basal expression of rtTA is very low. This enabled us to temporally separate the injection of virus and the expression of the therapeutic gene and rtTA. Wistar rats were injected with an autoregulatory rat erythropoietin expression vector. Two or six weeks after injection, erythropoietin expression was induced by doxycycline. This resulted in an increase of the hematocrit, irrespective of the timing of the induction. However, most rats only responded once to doxycycline administration. Antibodies against rtTA were detected in the early and late induction groups.Our results suggest that, even when viral vector capsid proteins have disappeared, expression of foreign proteins in muscle will lead to an immune response."

Studies on synaptic plasticity typically use constant-frequency stimulation to activate synapses, whereas in vivo activity of neurons is irregular. Methodology/Principal Findings Using extracellular and whole-cell electrophysiological recordings, we have here studied the synaptic responses at hippocampal mossy fiber synapses in vitro to stimulus patterns obtained from in vivo recordings of place cell firing of dentate gyrus granule cells in behaving rodents. We find that synaptic strength is strongly modulated on short- and long-lasting time scales during the presentation of the natural stimulus trains.

https://openalex.org/W2039744083,"Background Multiple types of fast and slow skeletal muscle fibers form during early embryogenesis in vertebrates. In zebrafish, formation of the earliest slow myofibers in fin muscles requires expression of the zinc-finger transcriptional repressor Prdm1 (also known as Blimp1). To further understand how the role of Prdm1 in early myogenesis may vary through evolution and during development, we have now analyzed Prdm1 expression in the diverse types of myotubes that form in culture from somitic, embryonic, and fetal chicken myoblasts. Principal Findings In cultures of somitic, embryonic limb, and fetal limb chicken cells, we found that Prdm1 was expressed in all of the differentiated muscle cells that formed, including those that expressed only fast myosin heavy chain isoforms, as well as those that co-expressed both fast and slow myosin heavy chain isoforms. Prdm1 was also expressed in Pax7-positive myoblasts, as well as in non-myogenic cells in the cultures. Furthermore, though all differentiated cells in control somite cultures co-expressed fast and slow myosin heavy chains, antisense knockdown of Prdm1 expression inhibited the formation of these co-expressing cells in somite cultures. Conclusions In chicken myogenic cell cultures, Prdm1 was expressed in most Pax7-positive myoblasts and in all differentiated muscle cells, irrespective of the developmental stage of cell donor or the pattern of fast and slow myosin heavy chains expressed in the differentiated cells that were formed. Thus, Prdm1 was expressed in myogenic cells prior to terminal differentiation; and, after differentiation, Prdm1 expression was not limited to cells that expressed slow myosin heavy chain isoforms. In addition, Prdm1 appeared to be required for differentiation of the somitic myocytes, which are the earliest myocytes to form in the avian embryo."

The two distinct functional PP1 consensus docking motifs, R/Kx((0,1))V/IxF and FxxR/KxR/K, involved in PP1 binding and cell death were previously characterized in the BH1 and BH3 domains of some Bcl-2 proteins.In this study, we demonstrate that DPT-AIF(1), a peptide containing the AIF(562-571) sequence located in a c-terminal domain of AIF, is a new PP1 interacting and cell penetrating molecule. We also showed that DPT-AIF(1) provoked apoptosis in several human cell lines. Furthermore, DPT-APAF(1) a bi-partite cell penetrating peptide containing APAF-1(122-131), a non penetrating sequence from APAF-1 protein, linked to our previously described DPT-sh1 peptide shuttle, is also a PP1-interacting death molecule. Both AIF(562-571) and APAF-1(122-131) sequences contain a common R/Kx((0,1))V/IxFxxR/KxR/K motif, shared by several proteins involved in control of cell survival pathways. This motif combines the two distinct PP1c consensus docking motifs initially identified in some Bcl-2 proteins. Interestingly DPT-AIF(2) and DPT-APAF(2) that carry a F to A mutation within this combinatorial motif, no longer exhibited any PP1c binding or apoptotic effects. Moreover the F to A mutation in DPT-AIF(2) also suppressed cell penetration.These results indicate that the combinatorial PP1c docking motif R/Kx((0,1))V/IxFxxR/KxR/K, deduced from AIF(562-571) and APAF-1(122-131) sequences, is a new PP1c-dependent Apoptotic Signature.

https://openalex.org/W2021093427,"Background Molecular biology is currently facing the challenging task of functionally characterizing the proteome. The large number of possible protein-protein interactions and complexes, the variety of environmental conditions and cellular states in which these interactions can be reorganized, and the multiple ways in which a protein can influence the function of others, requires the development of experimental and computational approaches to analyze and predict functional associations between proteins as part of their activity in the interactome. Methodology/Principal Findings We have studied the possibility of constructing a classifier in order to combine the output of the several protein interaction prediction methods. The AODE (Averaged One-Dependence Estimators) machine learning algorithm is a suitable choice in this case and it provides better results than the individual prediction methods, and it has better performances than other tested alternative methods in this experimental set up. To illustrate the potential use of this new AODE-based Predictor of Protein InterActions (APPIA), when analyzing high-throughput experimental data, we show how it helps to filter the results of published High-Throughput proteomic studies, ranking in a significant way functionally related pairs. Availability: All the predictions of the individual methods and of the combined APPIA predictor, together with the used datasets of functional associations are available at http://ecid.bioinfo.cnio.es/. Conclusions We propose a strategy that integrates the main current computational techniques used to predict functional associations into a unified classifier system, specifically focusing on the evaluation of poorly characterized protein pairs. We selected the AODE classifier as the appropriate tool to perform this task. AODE is particularly useful to extract valuable information from large unbalanced and heterogeneous data sets. The combination of the information provided by five prediction interaction prediction methods with some simple sequence features in APPIA is useful in establishing reliability values and helpful to prioritize functional interactions that can be further experimentally characterized."
https://openalex.org/W2004268177,"Widely accessible small animal models suitable for the study of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in vivo are lacking, primarily because rodent hepatocytes cannot be productively infected and because human hepatocytes are not easily engrafted in immunodeficient mice.We report here on a novel approach for human hepatocyte engraftment that involves subcutaneous implantation of primary human fetal hepatoblasts (HFH) within a vascularized rat collagen type I/human fibronectin (rCI/hFN) gel containing Bcl-2-transduced human umbilical vein endothelial cells (Bcl-2-HUVEC) in severe combined immunodeficient X beige (SCID/bg) mice. Maturing hepatic epithelial cells in HFH/Bcl-2-HUVEC co-implants displayed endocytotic activity at the basolateral surface, canalicular microvilli and apical tight junctions between adjacent cells assessed by transmission electron microscopy. Some primary HFH, but not Huh-7.5 hepatoma cells, appeared to differentiate towards a cholangiocyte lineage within the gels, based on histological appearance and cytokeratin 7 (CK7) mRNA and protein expression. Levels of human albumin and hepatic nuclear factor 4alpha (HNF4alpha) mRNA expression in gel implants and plasma human albumin levels in mice engrafted with HFH and Bcl-2-HUVEC were somewhat enhanced by including murine liver-like basement membrane (mLBM) components and/or hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-HUVEC within the gel matrix. Following ex vivo viral adsorption, both HFH/Bcl-2-HUVEC and Huh-7.5/Bcl-2-HUVEC co-implants sustained HCV Jc1 infection for at least 2 weeks in vivo, based on qRT-PCR and immunoelectron microscopic (IEM) analyses of gel tissue.The system described here thus provides the basis for a simple and robust small animal model of HFH engraftment that is applicable to the study of HCV infections in vivo."

Ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis regulates a wide range of cellular processes by controlling the stability of short-lived proteins, such as cell cycle factors, transcriptional regulators, and signal transducers.

One of the most extensively studied CRLs is SCF, which consists of Skp1, CUL1, Rbx/Hrt1, and one of several F-box domain-containing proteins. Substrate specificity is dictated by the F-box protein: SCFSKP2 binds a number of cell cycle regulators (cyclins D1 and E and the cell cycle inhibitors p27 and p21) through the adaptor SKP2. Conversely, the adaptor β-transducin repeat-containing protein (βTrCP) targets β-catenin and IκB and is involved in the regulation of these transcriptional pathways (3Frescas D. Pagano M. Nat.

The pleiotropic properties of CSN may be explained in part by its ability to control ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation through several mechanisms. The CSN can affect protein ubiquitination through association with a deubiquitinating enzyme of the cysteine protease family, called Ubp12 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe (16Zhou C. Wee S. Rhee E. Naumann M. Dubiel W. Wolf D.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 927-938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) or USP15 in mammalian cells (17Hetfeld B.K. Helfrich A. Kapelari B.

An additional ubiquitin isopeptidase activity, consisting in cleavage of monoubiquitin from Cul4, has been ascribed to CSN5 (18Groisman R. Polanowska J. Kuraoka I. Sawada J. Saijo M. Drapkin R. Kisselev A.F. Tanaka K. Nakatani Y. Cell. 2003; 113: 357-367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). The CSN may also affect protein degradation indirectly through the recruitment of protein kinases (inositol-1,3,4-triphosphate 5/6-kinase, protein kinase D, and casein II) (19Qian X. Mitchell J. Wei S.J. Williams J. Petrovich R.M. Shears S.B. Biochem. J. 2005; 389: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 20Uhle S. Medalia O. Waldron R. Dumdey R. Henklein P. Bech-Otschir D. Huang X. Berse M. Sperling J. Schade R. Dubiel W. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1302-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and possibly of some of their substrates, such as c-Jun and the p53 tumor suppressor protein (21Seeger M. Kraft R. Ferrell K. Bech-Otschir D. Dumdey R. Schade R. Gordon C. Naumann M. Dubiel W. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), affecting protein phosphorylation and stability. Perhaps the best characterized biochemical property of the CSN is its deneddylase activity, which requires a zinc protease motif in CSN5, as well as the integrity of the whole complex (22Cope G.A. Suh G.S. Aravind L. Schwarz S.E. Zipursky S.L. Koonin E.V. Deshaies R.J. Science. 2002; 298: 608-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 23Lyapina S. Cope G. Shevchenko A. Serino G. Tsuge T. Zhou C. Wolf D.A. Wei N. Shevchenko A. Deshaies R.J. Science. 2001; 292: 1382-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). In vitro studies have suggested that CSN-mediated deneddylation inhibits CRL activity (18Groisman R. Polanowska J. Kuraoka I. Sawada J. Saijo M. Drapkin R. Kisselev A.F. Tanaka K. Nakatani Y. Cell. 2003; 113: 357-367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar, 24Yang X. Menon S. Lykke-Andersen K. Tsuge T. Xiao D. Wang X. Rodriguez-Suarez R.J. Zhang H. Wei N. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 667-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, CSN inactivation in vivo, while inducing cullin hyperneddylation, results in the accumulation of some CRL substrates, indicating that CRL function may be impaired when CSN activity is deficient (25Wei N. Serino G. Deng X.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2008; 33: 592-600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). To explain this apparent contradiction, it has been proposed that the CSN is required to transiently inactivate CRLs (perhaps affecting E2 recruitment) to protect selected substrate adaptors, such as Skp2, from autocatalytic ubiquitination and destruction (26Wee S. Geyer R.K. Toda T. Wolf D.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 387-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 27Cope G.A. Deshaies R.J.

Chem. 2006; 281: 32188-32196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In this work, we investigated how loss of the CSN affects the activity of the E2 enzymes associated with SCF. We found that human UBC3, but not UBC4/5, is a target for SCFβTrCP-mediated ubiquitination and that the CSN is required to protect UBC3 from proteasome-dependent degradation. The pCMVΔ8.9 and vesicular stomatitis virus G lentiviral vectors were provided by P. Charneau (Institut Pasteur, Paris). The short hairpin RNA (shRNA) plasmids (pTCN.control, pTCN.iCSN4, and pTCN.iCSN5) have been described previously (28Denti S. Fernandez-Sanchez M.E. Rogge L. Bianchi E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 32188-32196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The expression vectors pCS2+HAhUBC3 (wild type), pCS2+HAhUBC3–5PT, and pCS2+HAhUBC3-(1–200) were a generous gift of Dr. P. R.Yew (University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX). The pCS2+HAhUBC3-(1–229) plasmid was generated by amplifying wild-type UBC3 with oligonucleotides that introduce a stop codon at amino acid 229. The pcDNAI-HAUBCH5A and pcDNAI-HAUBCH5B plasmids were obtained by PCR amplification. pcDNAI-HAUBCH5A+3tail and pcDNAI-HAUBCH5B+3tail were similarly generated by PCR amplification: the C-terminal fragment (amino acids 199–236) of UBC3 was subcloned in-frame at the 3′-end of UBCH5A or UBCH5B. HEK293T and HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone). Expression plasmids were transfected in HEK293T and HeLa cells with the jetPEITM transfection reagent (Polyplus Transfection) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Analysis of transfected cells was performed 48 h after transfection. 2 × 106 HEK293T cells were plated on 100-mm plates. The following day, the cells were cotransfected by calcium phosphate precipitation with 10 μg of the pCMVΔ8.9 packaging vector, 5 μg of the vesicular stomatitis virus G envelope vector, and 10 μg of the shRNA vector pTCN (pTCN.control, pTCN.iCSN4, or pTCN.iCSN5). The next day, the medium was substituted with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% fetal bovine serum and 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4). After 24 h, supernatants were collected, centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 5 min, and concentrated with Amicon Ultra filter devices (Millipore) at 3300 rpm for 10 min. 5 × 105 HEK293T or HeLa cells seeded in a 6-well plate were incubated with the viral supernatant. To evaluate the efficiency of viral transduction, cells were analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting for nerve growth factor receptor expression 4 days after the infection (murine anti-nerve growth factor receptor monoclonal antibody clone 20.4). All experiments were performed 5–10 days after transduction. Cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 0.05% SDS) plus 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF), 1 mm Na3VO4, and 10 mmN-ethylmaleimide. The protein content of the supernatant was measured by colorimetric reaction (Bradford assay, Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Hybond-P, Amersham Biosciences), and hybridized with the appropriate antibodies, followed by detection using enhanced chemiluminescence (Western LightningTM, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For protein stability studies, cells were treated with 60 μg/ml cycloheximide (CHX; Sigma) for the indicated times. Treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (20 μm; Sigma) was performed for 6 h. To test the stability of the different UBC3 and UBCH5 constructs, they were transfected into HEK293T cells together with green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a transfection efficiency control. The transfected cultures were split in two after 24 h. 48 h after transfection, one dish was treated with CHX alone, and the second dish was treated with CHX and MG132 for 6 h. Cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Protein levels were quantified by phosphorimaging (Kodak). The following antibodies were used for this study: anti-CSN5 monoclonal antibody SP282, described previously (29Bianchi E. Denti S. Granata A. Bossi G. Geginat J. Villa A. Rogge L. Pardi R. Nature. 2000; 404: 617-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar); anti-CSN4 antibody (A300-013A) from Bethyl Laboratories; anti-Cul1 (71-8700) and anti-p45 SKP2 (32-3300) antibodies from Zymed Laboratories Inc.; anti-p27 (C-19, sc-528), IκB-α (C-21, sc-371), UBC4 (C-15, sc-15000), and UBC9 (H-81, sc-10759) antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; anti-β-catenin antibody (C19220) from Transduction Laboratories; anti-UBC3 polyclonal antibody (4997) from Cell Signaling; anti-UBC3 monoclonal antibody (90.12) from GeneTex, Inc.; anti-hemagglutinin (HA) (clone HA-7, H9658), anti-β-tubulin (clone TUB2.1, T4026), anti-actin (20-33, A5060), anti-Myc monoclonal (clone 9E10), and anti-FLAG M2 antibodies from Sigma; and anti-USP15 antibody from Abnova. The anti-βTrCP polyclonal antibody was kindly provided by G. J. Strous (University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands). 48 h after transfection, HEK293T cells were treated with 20 μm MG132 for 5 h and lysed in 1% SDS, 50 mm Tris (pH 8.5), 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm AEBSF, and 10 mmN-ethylmaleimide. The lysates were incubated at 95 °C for 5 min, diluted up to a final volume of 1 ml with nondenaturing buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm AEBSF, and 10 mmN-ethylmaleimide), subjected to mechanical shearing, and cleared by incubation with 60 μl of Pansorbin® cells (Calbiochem) for 30 min at 4 °C. Homogenates were spun at 14,000 rpm for 20 min, and supernatants were measured by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of protein were incubated with 1 μg of anti-HA antibody for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by incubation with protein G-SepharoseTM 4 Fast Flow (GE Healthcare). After six washes with nondenaturing buffer, bound proteins were eluted with sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Transfected HEK293T cells were lysed in Triton X-100 buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 0,1% Triton X-100, 15% glycerol, 1 mm AEBSF, 20 mm NaF, and 1 mm Na3VO4). After centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 30 min, equal amounts of protein were precleared with 15 μl of protein A-SepharoseTM 4 Fast Flow (GE Healthcare) and subsequently incubated with 20 μl of anti-FLAG® M2-agarose (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C. The FLAG beads were washed five times with Triton X-100 buffer, and bound proteins were eluted with FLAG® peptide (Sigma) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. For co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous proteins, cells were lysed in 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 0,1% digitonin, 15% glycerol, 1 mm AEBSF, 20 mm NaF, and 1 mm Na3VO4, and immunoprecipitates were washed as described above. Monoclonal antibody 90.12 was used for UBC3 immunoprecipitation. RNA was extracted with the NucleoSpin RNA II kit (Macherey-Nagel) following the manufacturer's instructions and quantified with a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer. 1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed with SuperScriptTM II (Invitrogen) using anchored oligo(dT)25V (MP Biomedicals) or p(dN)6 random primers (Roche Applied Science). Real-time fluorogenic reverse transcription-PCR (Applied Biosystems) was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol: 20 ng of cDNA was amplified with 4 μl of the “Assays-on-Demand” oligonucleotide in a final volume of 25 μl (Applied Biosystems TaqMan® gene expression assays COPS4, Hs00275045_m1; COPS5, Hs00272789_m1; CUL1, Hs00269187_m1; CUL4A, Hs00757716_m1; SKP2, Hs00180634_m1; BTRC, Hs00182707_m1; CDC34, Hs00362082_m1; UBE2D1, Hs00234280_m1; UBE2D2, Hs00366152_m1; UBE2D3, Hs00704312_m1; and CTNNB1, Hs00170025_m1). Samples were analyzed with the ABI Prism 7300 real-time PCR machine. Relative mRNA levels were normalized using 18 S rRNA/VICTM-MGB. As a control, normalization to human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase/VICTM-MGB or human hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase/VICTM-MGB (Applied Biosystems) was performed and gave similar results. 7 × 104 HEK293T or HeLa cells were seeded in a 12-well plate. 24 h later, the cells were transiently transfected with a small interfering RNA (siRNA) oligonucleotide (5 nm) using INTERFERinTM (Polyplus Transfection). After 48 h, the cells were lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and analyzed by Western blotting. The siRNA oligonucleotides used were control (1022076), Cul1.5 (SI02225657), Cul1.6 (SI02225664), Cul4A.1 (SI00356937), Cul4A.2 (SI00356944), Skp2.5 (SI00287819), Skp2.8 (SI02659692), bTrCP.A (SI00058065), bTrCP.B (SI02632322), and bTrCP (09-3342-3/3) (MWG Biotech) and USP15 (s19338 and s19339, Applied Biosystems). To investigate whether the CSN affects E2 recruitment to SCFSkp2, we down-regulated the expression of CSN4 or CSN5 by lentivirus-mediated RNA interference. As shown previously (28Denti S. Fernandez-Sanchez M.E. Rogge L. Bianchi E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 32188-32196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), down-regulation of either subunit was sufficient to disrupt the CSN complex and induce cullin hyperneddylation and degradation of the F-box protein Skp2. In CSN-deficient cells (CSNkd cells), we observed a marked decrease in UBC3 protein levels, without a concomitant decrease in mRNA levels, pointing to a post-transcriptional mechanism for UBC3 loss (Fig. 1A). UBC3 decrease was observed following CSN down-regulation in transformed cell lines (293T and HeLa), as well as in primary cultures of normal human fibroblasts and T lymphocytes (Fig. 1, A and B). CSN down-regulation did not affect the levels of UBC4/5 proteins or of the small ubiquitin-like modifier E2 UBC9 (Fig. 1A). Treatment of CSNkd cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 recovered UBC3 protein levels without increasing UBC3 mRNA (Fig. 1C), indicating that UBC3 loss in these cells results from proteasome-dependent degradation. To confirm that the loss of UBC3 in CSNkd cells was due to increased turnover, we analyzed UBC3 levels in total lysates from control and CSN4kd cells at different time points after the addition of the protein synthesis inhibitor CHX. UBC3 turnover was accelerated in CSN4kd cells compared with control cells (Fig. 1D), indicating that loss of the CSN destabilizes UBC3. Similar results were obtained by down-regulation of CSN5 (data not shown). Ubiquitinated forms of UBC3/Cdc34 have been detected in yeast cells (4Goebl M.G. Yochem J. Jentsch S. McGrath J.P. Varshavsky A. Byers B. Science. 1988; 241: 1331-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) and in S. cerevisiae Cdc34 ubiquitination is enhanced by recruitment to SCF (6Seol J.H. Feldman R.M. Zachariae W. Shevchenko A. Correll C.C. Lyapina S. Chi Y. Galova M. Claypool J. Sandmeyer S. Nasmyth K. Deshaies R.J. Shevchenko A. Deshaies R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1614-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). We therefore asked whether the degradation of human UBC3 observed in CSNkd cells was also dependent on CUL1. Down-regulation of CUL1 using siRNA recovered UBC3 protein levels in CSNkd cells without affecting UBC3 levels in control cells (Fig. 2A and supplemental Fig. S1A). This effect is specific for Cul1 because inhibition of Cul4 did not influence UBC3 levels (supplemental Fig. S1B). Mammalian UBC3 presents at its C terminus a consensus sequence for binding to the adaptor βTrCP (amino acids 230–236, DSGTEES) (supplemental Fig. S2) (30Semplici F. Meggio F. Pinna L.A. Oliviero S. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3978-3987Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Recruitment of substrates to βTrCP through the classical consensus sequence (DpSGXXpS) depends on phosphorylation of the serine residues, and amino acids 231, 233, and 236 of UBC3 have been shown to be phosphorylated in vivo (31Block K. Boyer T.G. Yew P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41049-41058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We therefore explored the possibility that UBC3 is targeted for degradation through an SCFβTrCP-dependent pathway. Endogenous UBC3 and βTrCP interacted in co-immunoprecipitation assays using either anti-UBC3 (middle panel) or anti-βTrCP (right panel) antibody for the immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2B). HA-UBC3 co-immunoprecipitated both with full-length βTrCP and with a deletion construct (βTrCPΔFbox) that lacks the F-box domain and does not bind to SCF (Fig. 2C), indicating that the interaction between UBC3 and βTrCP does not require binding to CUL1. We then investigated whether the observed UBC3/βTrCP interaction resulted in UBC3 ubiquitination in vivo. Low levels of UBC3-ubiquitin conjugates were visible in UBC3 immunoprecipitates in the presence of transfected Myc-ubiquitin. Overexpression of βTrCP1 and, to a lesser extent, βTrCP2 increased the amount of ubiquitinated UBC3, whereas overexpression of an unrelated F-box protein (SKP2) did not induce UBC3 ubiquitination (Fig. 2D). Consistent with the role of βTrCP in promoting UBC3 ubiquitination, down-regulation of endogenous βTrCP levels by RNA interference caused an accumulation of the endogenous UBC3 protein, as well as increased levels of a known βTrCP target, β-catenin (Fig. 2E), demonstrating that βTrCP plays a role in regulating UBC3 levels in vivo. Down-regulation of SKP2 did not affect UBC3 levels, as predicted by Skp2 inability to promote UBC3 ubiquitination (Fig. 2F). To investigate the role of the DSGTEES motif in targeting UBC3 to βTrCP, we tested the ability of βTrCP1 to interact with a deletion mutant of UBC3 lacking this motif (UBC3-(1–229)) (Fig. 3A). Deletion of amino acids 230–236 markedly decreased the interaction of UBC3 with endogenous βTrCP (Fig. 3B) or transfected βTrCPΔFbox (supplemental Fig. S3A), although some residual βTrCP was still able to co-immunoprecipitate with UBC3-(1–229) in both cases. Consistently, βTrCP overexpression still promoted some ubiquitination of UBC3-(1–229), although less efficiently compare with wild-type UBC3 (Fig. 3C). Interaction with endogenous βTrCP and βTrCPΔFbox was also impaired in the absence of phosphorylation of the UBC3 C-terminal domain, as shown by the analysis of a phosphorylation-defective construct (UBC3–5PT) (supplemental Fig. S3) (31Block K. Boyer T.G. Yew P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41049-41058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that the DSGTEES motif plays a major role in UBC3 binding to βTrCP1. However, in the absence of the DSGTEES motif, additional elements may come into play in UBC3 interaction with βTrCP. Several βTrCP substrates that contain variant or noncanonical recognition motifs have been identified recently (3Frescas D. Pagano M. Nat. Rev. 2008; 8: 438-449Crossref Scopus (724) Google Scholar). Notably, acidic residues have been reported to substitute for the phosphorylated residues of the classical consensus sequence (32Kanemori Y. Uto K. Sagata N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 6279-6284Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). UBC3/Cdc34 is characterized by a C-terminal extension that contains an acidic domain essential for yeast Cdc34 cell cycle functions (supplemental Fig. S2) (4Goebl M.G. Yochem J. Jentsch S. McGrath J.P. Varshavsky A. Byers B. Science. 1988; 241: 1331-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 33Kolman C.J. Toth J. Gonda D.K. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3081-3090Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Deletion of the UBC3 acidic domain (UBC3-(1–200)) (Fig. 3A) completely abolished the interaction between UBC3 and endogenous βTrCP (Fig. 3B) or βTrCPΔFbox (supplemental Fig. S3A), as well as βTrCP-induced ubiquitination (Fig. 3C), suggesting that multiple sequences in the C-terminal extension can interact with βTrCP. As a consequence of the above findings, we predicted UBC3-(1–200) to be more stable than wild-type UBC3. To assess the relative stability of these proteins, we coexpressed them with GFP as an internal control in cells treated or not with MG132. Western blot analysis and quantification of the UBC3/GFP ratio showed that MG132 treatment increased the levels of wild-type UBC3, but not of UBC3-(1–200), indicating that the latter is less sensitive to proteasome-dependent degradation (Fig. 3D). Enzymes of the UBC4/5 family, which were stable in CSNkd cells (Fig. 1A), lack the acidic domain present in UBC3 (supplemental Fig. S2). We therefore asked whether this domain could confer instability to UBC4/5 proteins. We constructed chimeric UBCH5A and UBCH5B proteins containing UBC3 amino acids 200–236 at their C termini (Fig. 4A). Turnover of the UBCH5A+3tail chimera in CHX-treated cells was enhanced compared with turnover of wild-type UBCH5A (Fig. 4B), indicating that the acidic domain has a destabilizing effect on the protein. Similarly, proteasome inhibition did not affect the levels of wild-type UBCH5B but caused accumulation of UBCH5B+3tail (Fig. 4C), showing that amino acids 200–236 of UBC3 are sufficient to confer proteasomal sensitivity to UBCH5B. The acidic domain also conferred to the chimeric protein the ability to bind βTrCPΔFbox in co-immunoprecipitation assays (Fig. 4D). As a consequence, UBCH5B+3tail was more efficiently ubiquitinated in vivo in a βTrCP-dependent manner (Fig. 4E). Taken together, these data demonstrate that UBC3 is a ubiquitination substrate of SCFβTrCP and that targeting to βTrCP requires the UBC3 acidic C-terminal extension. The decrease in UBC3 observed in CSNkd cells depended on the presence of Cul1 (Fig. 2A). We therefore asked whether SCFβTrCP could be responsible for UBC3 loss under these conditions. βTrCP suppression by RNA interference restored UBC3 levels in CSNkd cells (Fig. 5A), indicating that the SCFβTrCP complex is actively ubiquitinating UBC3 in these cells. Similarly, the known SCFβTrCP substrate β-catenin was strongly accumulated upon βTrCP down-regulation in CSNkd cells (Fig. 5A). These findings indicate that SCFβTrCP is still active in these CSNkd cells, contrary to what has been observed for SCFSkp2 (27Cope G.A. Deshaies R.J. BMC Biochem. 2006; 7: 1Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 28Denti S. Fernandez-Sanchez M.E. Rogge L. Bianchi E. J. Biol.

BMC Biochem. 2006; 7: 1Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 28Denti S. Fernandez-Sanchez M.E. Rogge L. Bianchi E. J. Biol.

The ubiquitin-specific protease enzyme USP15 (Ubp12 in yeast) can be found associated with the CSN, and it has been shown to protect selected CRL components from autocatalytic ubiquitination and degradation (35Wu J.T.
