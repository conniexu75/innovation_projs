Naive mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are shown here to specify lineage and commit to phenotypes with extreme sensitivity to tissue-level elasticity. Soft matrices that mimic brain are neurogenic, stiffer matrices that mimic muscle are myogenic, and comparatively rigid matrices that mimic collagenous bone prove osteogenic. During the initial week in culture, reprogramming of these lineages is possible with addition of soluble induction factors, but after several weeks in culture, the cells commit to the lineage specified by matrix elasticity, consistent with the elasticity-insensitive commitment of differentiated cell types. Inhibition of nonmuscle myosin II blocks all elasticity-directed lineage specification–without strongly perturbing many other aspects of cell function and shape. The results have significant implications for understanding physical effects of the in vivo microenvironment and also for therapeutic uses of stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W2156281856,"In multicellular organisms, the ability to regulate reproduction, development, and nutrient utilization coincided with the evolution of nuclear receptors (NRs), transcription factors that utilize lipophilic ligands to mediate their function. Studying the expression profile of NRs offers a simple, powerful way to obtain highly relational information about their physiologic functions as individual proteins and as a superfamily. We surveyed the expression of all 49 mouse NR mRNAs in 39 tissues, representing diverse anatomical systems. The resulting data set uncovers several NR clades whose patterns of expression indicate their ability to coordinate the transcriptional programs necessary to affect distinct physiologic pathways. Remarkably, this regulatory network divides along the following two physiologic paradigms: (1) reproduction, development, and growth and (2) nutrient uptake, metabolism, and excretion. These data reveal a hierarchical transcriptional circuitry that extends beyond individual tissues to form a meganetwork governing physiology on an organismal scale."

Surveying the diurnal expression profiles of all 49 mouse nuclear receptors in white and brown adipose tissue, liver, and skeletal muscle revealed that of the 45 NRs expressed, 25 are in a rhythmic cycle and 3 exhibit a single transient pulse of expression 4 hr into the light cycle. While thyroid hormones are generally constant, we find that TRalpha and beta dramatically cycle, suggesting that fundamental concepts such as ""basal metabolism"" may require reexamination. The dynamic but coordinated changes in nuclear receptor expression, along with their key target genes, offers a logical explanation for known cyclic behavior of lipid and glucose metabolism and suggests novel roles for endocrine and orphan receptors in coupling the peripheral circadian clock to divergent metabolic outputs."
https://openalex.org/W2123230988,"A fundamental question in cell and developmental biology is how epithelial cells construct the diffusion barrier allowing them to separate different body compartments. Formation of tight junction (TJ) strands, which are crucial for this barrier, involves the polymerization of claudins, TJ adhesion molecules, in temporal and spatial manners. ZO-1 and ZO-2 are major PDZ-domain-containing TJ proteins and bind directly to claudins, yet their functional roles are poorly understood. We established cultured epithelial cells (1(ko)/2(kd)) in which the expression of ZO-1/ZO-2 was suppressed by homologous recombination and RNA interference, respectively. These cells were well polarized, except for a complete lack of TJs. When exogenously expressed in 1(ko)/2(kd) cells, ZO-1 and ZO-2 were recruited to junctional areas where claudins were polymerized, but truncated ZO-1 (NZO-1) containing only domains PDZ1–3 was not. When NZO-1 was forcibly recruited to lateral membranes and dimerized, claudins were dramatically polymerized. These findings indicate that ZO-1 and ZO-2 can independently determine whether and where claudins are polymerized."

Molecular mechanisms underlying the generation and refinement of these patterns during cell fate determination remain unexplored because of the absence of suitable experimental systems. Using PU.1−/− progenitors, we demonstrate that at subthreshold levels, this Ets transcription factor regulates a mixed pattern (macrophage/neutrophil) of gene expression within individual myeloid progenitors. Increased PU.1 levels refine the pattern and promote macrophage differentiation by modulating a novel regulatory circuit comprised of counter antagonistic repressors, Egr-1,2/Nab-2 and Gfi-1. Egr-1 and Egr-2 function redundantly to activate macrophage genes and to repress the neutrophil program. These results are used to assemble and mathematically model a gene regulatory network that exhibits both graded and bistable behaviors and accounts for the onset and resolution of mixed lineage patterns during cell fate determination. Hematopoietic stem cells and their progenitors exhibit multilineage patterns of gene expression.

These results are used to assemble and mathematically model a gene regulatory network that exhibits both graded and bistable behaviors and accounts for the onset and resolution of mixed lineage patterns during cell fate determination. Hematopoietic multipotential progenitors exhibit low levels of multilineage gene expression patterns (Hu et al., 1997Hu M. Krause D. Greaves M. Sharkis S. Dexter M. Heyworth C. Enver T. Multilineage gene expression precedes commitment in the hemopoietic system.Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 774-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar, Miyamoto et al., 2002Miyamoto T. Iwasaki H.

This phenomenon has been termed transcriptional priming and it appears to reflect, at a molecular level, the developmental potency of a multilineage progenitor. These observations suggest that hematopoietic cell fate specification depends on induction as well as repression of subsets of lineage-specific genes. Regulatory mechanisms that initiate and resolve mixed lineage gene expression patterns during cell fate specification remain unexplored because of a lack of suitable experimentally manipulable cellular systems. Antagonistic interplay between primary lineage determining factors has been proposed as a molecular mechanism for initiating and resolving mixed lineage states (Orkin, 2000Orkin S.H. Diversification of haematopoietic stem cells to specific lineages.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2000; 1: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). This widely accepted model is based on studies which have demonstrated that transcription factors such as GATA-1 and PU.1 physically interact and can functionally antagonize one another in transactivation and differentiation assays (Rekhtman et al., 1999Rekhtman N. Radparvar F. Evans T. Skoultchi A.I.

USA. 1999; 96: 8705-8710Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Although this is an attractive regulatory model, its key features remain to be rigorously tested in a suitable experimental system that dynamically primes and resolves alternate lineage expression patterns during cell fate determination. Furthermore, the model does not account for specification of cell fates that involve cooperative rather than antagonistic interplay between primary lineage-determining transcription factors; although GATA-2 and PU.1 have also been shown to mutually antagonize one another, the development of mast cell precursors requires their cooperative interplay (Walsh et al., 2002Walsh J.C. DeKoter R.P. Lee H.J. Smith E.D. Lancki D.W. Gurish M.F. Friend D.S. Stevens R.L. Anastasi J. Singh H. Cooperative and antagonistic interplay between PU.1 and GATA-2 in the specification of myeloid cell fates.Immunity. 2002; 17: 665-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Macrophage and neutrophil cell fate specification require the transcription factors PU.1 and C/EBPα, respectively (Scott et al., 1994Scott E.W. Simon M.C. Anastasi J. Singh H. Requirement of transcription factor PU.1 in the development of multiple hematopoietic lineages.Science. 1994; 265: 1573-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar, Zhang et al., 1997Zhang D.E.

USA. 1997; 94: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). The relative levels of PU.1 and C/EBPα in granulocytic-macrophage progenitors have been suggested to regulate macrophage versus neutrophil cell fate choice (Dahl et al., 2003Dahl R. Walsh J.C. Lancki D. Laslo P. Iyer S.R. Singh H. Simon M.C. Regulation of macrophage and neutrophil cell fates by the PU.1:C/EBPalpha ratio and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor.Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 1029-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), although the underlying molecular mechanism remains obscure. Paradoxically, both transcription factors are highly expressed in macrophages and neutrophils and synergistically regulate transcription of genes that are active in one or the other cell type (Smith et al., 1996Smith L.T. Hohaus S. Gonzalez D.A. Dziennis S.E. Tenen D.G. PU.1 (Spi-1) and C/EBP alpha regulate the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor promoter in myeloid cells.Blood. 1996; 88: 1234-1247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Zhang et al., 1996Zhang D.E. Hetherington C.J. Meyers S. Rhoades K.L. Larson C.J. Chen H.M. Hiebert S.W. Tenen D.G.

Biol. 1996; 16: 1231-1240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This regulatory feature is not taken into consideration by the aforementioned regulatory model. We establish a cellular system to analyze mixed lineage transcriptional priming and its resolution in the context of macrophage versus neutrophil cell fate determination. The analysis uncovers a novel regulatory circuit comprised of counter-acting (mutual) repressors. Mathematical modeling of the assembled gene regulatory network shows that such a network architecture can exhibit both graded and bistable (switch-like) behaviors. The model accounts for both the onset and resolution of mixed lineage patterns during cell fate determination. In particular, the model shows how upregulation of a common pair of primary lineage determinants can contribute to specification and commitment from a cell state in which the potential for two distinct fates coexists. PU.1−/− myeloid progenitors can be expanded in culture using the cytokine IL-3 and established as cell lines (Walsh et al., 2002Walsh J.C. DeKoter R.P. Lee H.J. Smith E.D. Lancki D.W. Gurish M.F. Friend D.S. Stevens R.L. Anastasi J. Singh H. Cooperative and antagonistic interplay between PU.1 and GATA-2 in the specification of myeloid cell fates.Immunity. 2002; 17: 665-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). These cells can be induced to differentiate into macrophages or neutrophils by re-expression of PU.1. Cell fate specification in this system is dictated by the relative levels of PU.1 and C/EBPα at the onset of differentiation (Dahl et al., 2003Dahl R. Walsh J.C. Lancki D. Laslo P. Iyer S.R. Singh H. Simon M.C. Regulation of macrophage and neutrophil cell fates by the PU.1:C/EBPalpha ratio and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor.Nat.

Singh H. Cooperative and antagonistic interplay between PU.1 and GATA-2 in the specification of myeloid cell fates.Immunity. 2002; 17: 665-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The PU.1 gene is expressed at low levels in common myeloid progenitors (CMP) and its expression is induced in vivo and in vitro as these cells differentiate into macrophages and neutrophils (Nutt et al., 2005Nutt S.L. Metcalf D. D'Amico A. Polli M. Wu L. Dynamic regulation of PU.1 expression in multipotent hematopoietic progenitors.J. Exp. Med. 2005; 201: 221-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar; see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data). To examine the consequences of differing levels of PU.1 on the differentiation fate of PU.1−/− myeloid progenitors, we made use of mutant clones expressing varied physiological levels of a conditionally active PU.1 protein fused to the ligand binding domain of the estrogen receptor (PUER). The PUERhi cells express approximately 5-fold higher levels of the PUER transcript (Figure S1) and the fusion protein (Figure 1A) compared with PUERlo counterparts. The levels of PU.1 RNA in PUERlo and PUERhi cells are physiologically appropriate as they are comparable to those observed in CMPs and macrophages, respectively (Figure S1). In the absence of 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (OHT), both PUERlo and PUERhi cells retain myeloid progenitor morphology (Figure 1A) and are c-kithiGr-1loF4/80− (Figure S2). Upon OHT addition, the PUERhi cells undergo rapid growth arrest and differentiate within 4 to 7 days into adherent c-kit−CD11bhiF4/80+ macrophages (Figure 1A, Figure S2). In contrast, the PUERlo cells do not undergo discernable morphological differentiation with OHT addition (Figure 1A, Figure S2). PUERlo and PUERhi cells were analyzed for the expression of macrophage- or neutrophil-specific genes (Figure 1B). Strikingly, the induction of PU.1 activity in PUERlo cells appears to activate a mixed (macrophage/neutrophil) pattern of gene expression within 24 hr. This pattern is sustained over the course of 4 to 7 days and is not accompanied by overt differentiation (Figures 1A and 1B). Induction of PU.1 activity in PUERhi cells also seemingly activates a mixed lineage pattern of gene expression within 24 hr (Figure 1B). However, this pattern, with the exception of G-CSFR, is resolved into a macrophage-specific subset. As noted above, the PUERhi cells undergo overt differentiation into macrophages within 4 to 7 days. To test if PU.1 activates a mixed lineage pattern of gene expression within individual cells, we treated PUERhi cells for 24 hr with OHT and performed single-cell multiplex RT-PCR (Figure 1C). Of 21 single cells that were analyzed, all coexpressed at least one macrophage- and neutrophil-specific gene. These results reveal that the PUER cells represent an experimentally manipulable model system for analyzing regulatory mechanisms that underlie transcriptional priming and resolution during cell fate determination. Furthermore, the experiments demonstrate that subthreshold levels of PU.1 activate a mixed lineage pattern of gene expression within individual myeloid progenitors. An increase in PU.1 activity beyond the threshold induces resolution of the mixed lineage pattern and is accompanied by overt differentiation into macrophages. The repression of neutrophil genes during macrophage differentiation could be directly mediated by higher levels of PU.1 or indirectly mediated via the induction of a negative regulator(s). We explored these possibilities by performing genome-wide expression analysis. Among the large set of genes whose expression was induced by PU.1, ten encoded regulatory factors (data not shown). The expression of five of these regulatory genes (Id2, Egr-2, Nab-2, Miz1, and NCoA3) was strongly induced in PUERhi, but not PUERlo, cells (Figure 2A). Egr-2 (Krox-20) and Nab-2 were of interest since the related zinc finger family transcription factor Egr-1 (Krox-24) has been implicated in regulating macrophage differentiation (Nguyen et al., 1993Nguyen H.Q. Hoffman-Liebermann B. Liebermann D.A. The zinc finger transcription factor Egr-1 is essential for and restricts differentiation along the macrophage lineage.Cell. 1993; 72: 197-209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Egr-1 and Egr-2 interact with the corepressor Nab-2, which can inhibit the ability of Egr proteins to activate transcription (Svaren et al., 1996Svaren J. Sevetson B.R. Apel E.D. Zimonjic D.B. Popescu N.C. Milbrandt J. NAB2, a corepressor of NGFI-A (Egr-1) and Krox20, is induced by proliferative and differentiative stimuli.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3545-3553Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). These results suggested that PU.1-induced Egr/Nab complexes could function in the repression of neutrophil-specific genes. To test this, we employed a shRNA-based approach. PUERhi cells expressing shRNA directed against Egr-2 (shEgr-2) showed a reduction (approximately 5-fold) in the accumulation of Egr-2 protein upon activation of PUER (Figure 2B). We note that PUERhi cells express Egr-1 and that its expression is downregulated by inducing high PU.1 activity. Importantly, the Egr-2 shRNA did not perturb the levels of Egr-1 protein. Induction of PU.1 activity in the shEgr-2 cells resulted in a striking morphological alteration (Figure 2B). The cells increased in size with an extensive cytoplasm resembling that of a macrophage but contained segmented nuclei with numerous lobes, a feature characteristic of neutrophils. Additionally, these cells did not adhere and failed to express the F4/80 antigen (Figure S2). The shEgr-2 cells not only induced but also sustained a mixed pattern of gene expression, with high levels of certain macrophage (mmp12) and neutrophil (IL-1R (II), lactoferrin, proteinase 3) RNAs (Figure 2C). These results demonstrate that PU.1 initially activates a mixed lineage pattern of gene expression in myeloid progenitors, then utilizes Egr-2 to resolve this pattern into a macrophage-specific output. To determine if Nab-2 functions in concert with Egr-2, we stably expressed a shNab-2 construct. This construct resulted in a 3-fold reduction of the basal and PU.1-induced levels of the Nab-2 protein (Figure 2B). Attenuation of Nab-2 levels did not appreciably affect the PU.1-dependent morphological differentiation (Figure 2B). However, the knockdown of Nab-2 protein resulted in both a marked reduction of F4/80+ cells (Figure S2) and, importantly, a failure to downregulate the neutrophil genes IL-1R (II) and proteinase 3 (Figure 2C). To examine the subsets of macrophage and neutrophil genes that are coregulated by Egr-2 and Nab-2, we performed genome-wide expression analysis with the shEgr-2 and shNab-2 cells. The induction of PU.1 in the PUERhi cells resulted in the expression of 142 macrophage-specific genes (Figure 2D). Expression of 22 of these genes was found to be dependent on both Egr-2 and Nab-2 (see Table S1 in the Supplemental Data). Conversely, attenuation of Egr-2 resulted in the mis-expression of 70 neutrophil genes, 18 of which were also improperly expressed as a consequence of reduction of Nab-2 (Figure 2D, Table S2). The finding that Egr-2 mediates repression of a larger set of neutrophil genes than Nab-2 may be due to the fact that Egr-2 is capable of interacting with a related corepressor, Nab-1 (Russo et al., 1995Russo M.W. Sevetson B.R. Milbrandt J. Identification of NAB1, a repressor of NGFI-A- and Krox20-mediated transcription.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1995; 92: 6873-6877Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, our results demonstrate that Egr-2 and Nab-2 function in concert to repress a subset of 18 neutrophil-specific genes. We note that both Egr-2 and Nab-2 reinforce macrophage gene activity while antagonizing neutrophil-specific gene expression. Egr-2 can function as a positive regulator of transcription and therefore likely upregulates the expression of a large subset of macrophage genes (Figure 2D). The molecular function of Nab-2 in promoting macrophage differentiation is analyzed below. The phenotypes of the shEgr-2 and shNab-2 cells paralleled those of myeloid cells lacking the zinc finger transcription factor, Gfi-1. In Gfi-1−/− mice, neutrophil development is impaired and the mutant granulocytic cells mis-express the macrophage genes, c-fms and Mac-3 (Hock et al., 2003Hock H. Hamblen M.J. Rooke H.M. Traver D. Bronson R.T. Cameron S. Orkin S.H. Intrinsic requirement for zinc finger transcription factor Gfi-1 in neutrophil differentiation.Immunity. 2003; 18: 109-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Collectively, these analyses led us to consider that Egr-1,2/Nab-2 and Gfi-1 represent lineage-specific counter-acting repressors. Consistent with this possibility, Egr-1,2/Nab-2 and Gfi-1 exhibited a reciprocal pattern of expression in macrophages and neutrophils (Figure S3). We next analyzed the dynamics of Egr-2/Nab-2 and Gfi-1 expression using PUERhi cells, under conditions that favor the generation of macrophages (IL-3) or neutrophils (G-CSF) (Dahl et al., 2003Dahl R. Walsh J.C. Lancki D. Laslo P. Iyer S.R. Singh H. Simon M.C. Regulation of macrophage and neutrophil cell fates by the PU.1:C/EBPalpha ratio and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor.Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 1029-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Macrophage differentiation was accompanied by the induction of Egr-2 and Nab-2 and the concomitant downregulation of Gfi-1 (Figure 3A). Conversely, differentiation of PUERhi cells into neutrophils resulted in sustained expression of Gfi-1 and a failure to significantly upregulate Egr-2 or Nab-2 in spite of induction of high PU.1 activity. Impairing Egr-2 or Nab-2 induction resulted in sustained expression of Gfi-1, demonstrating that Egr-2 and Nab-2 negatively regulate Gfi-1 expression (Figure 3B). We suggest that the macrophage differentiation defect observed in the shNab-2 cells (i.e., the failure to induce 22 macrophage genes, Figure 2D) is due to sustained expression of Gfi-1, which likely represses these genes. Interestingly, loss of Egr-2 did not affect the induction of Nab-2 and vice versa, suggesting that both Egr-2 and Nab-2 are independently regulated by PU.1 during macrophage differentiation (Figure 3B). Based on the above analysis, we predicted that Egr-1,2/Nab-2 should bind the Gfi-1 gene to directly mediate its repression. By DNA sequence analysis, we identified several putative Egr binding sites in the promoter region of the Gfi-1 gene. One of these sites, positioned 176 bp upstream of the transcription start site, is bound with high affinity by Egr-2 (Figure S4) as well as Egr-1 (data not shown). It has not been possible to detect the assembly of Egr-1,2/Nab cocomplexes on DNA by gel electrophoresis (Svaren et al., 1996Svaren J. Sevetson B.R. Apel E.D. Zimonjic D.B. Popescu N.C. Milbrandt J. NAB2, a corepressor of NGFI-A (Egr-1) and Krox20, is induced by proliferative and differentiative stimuli.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3545-3553Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). To determine if Egr-2 and Nab-2 associate with the Gfi-1 promoter, we carried out chromatin cross-linking and immunoprecipitation assays. Induction of Egr-2 and Nab-2 by PU.1 resulted in their cross-linking to the Gfi-1 promoter region containing the Egr binding site (Figure 3B). Importantly, the Gfi-1 promoter was repressed via the Egr site by coexpression of Egr-2 and Nab-2 (Figure 3C). Thus, Egr-2 and Nab-2 directly repress the Gfi-1 gene. To test if Gfi-1 can counter antagonize the expression of Egr-1,2/Nab-2, we utilized PUERhi cells expressing elevated levels of Gfi-1 (Figure 3B, right panel). Sustained expression of Gfi-1 inhibits PU.1-induced macrophage differentiation (R. Dahl, personal communication and data not shown). Importantly, overexpression of Gfi-1 in these cells resulted in the attenuation of both Egr-1 and Egr-2 expression, but not Nab-2. To determine if Gfi-1 repression of Egr-1 and Egr-2 can occur in the absence of PU.1 and other myeloid regulatory factors, we expressed Gfi-1 in NIH3T3 fibroblasts. Egr-1,2/Nab-2 are induced in fibroblasts upon serum starvation and restimulation (Svaren et al., 1996Svaren J. Sevetson B.R. Apel E.D. Zimonjic D.B. Popescu N.C. Milbrandt J. NAB2, a corepressor of NGFI-A (Egr-1) and Krox20, is induced by proliferative and differentiative stimuli.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3545-3553Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Gfi-1 inhibited the growth factor-induced expression of both Egr-1 and Egr-2 (Figure 3B, right panel). As was the case with PUERhi cells, Nab-2 expression was not affected by Gfi-1. The Egr-2 promoter region (−650 to +150) contains multiple putative Gfi-1 binding sites (data not shown). Importantly, Gfi-1 could be shown to repress the Egr-2 promoter (Figure 3C, right panel). Repression by Gfi-1 required a functional SNAG domain as it was not observed with the P2A mutant (Grimes et al., 1996Grimes H.L. Chan T.O. Zweidler-McKay P.A. Tong B. Tsichlis P.N. The Gfi-1 proto-oncoprotein contains a novel transcriptional repressor domain, SNAG, and inhibits G1 arrest induced by interleukin-2 withdrawal.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6263-6272Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Although the Gfi-1 binding site(s) required for Egr-2 repression remain(s) to be delineated, our results establish that Gfi-1 can counter-repress the Egr-1 and Egr-2 genes in two different cellular contexts. Egr-2−/− mice exhibit perinatal lethality (Swiatek and Gridley, 1993Swiatek P.J. Gridley T. Perinatal lethality and defects in hindbrain development in mice homozygous for a targeted mutation of the zinc finger gene Krox20.Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2071-2084Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), but the development of macrophages in Egr-2−/− embryos has not been examined. We analyzed the generation of myeloid cells in the fetal liver of E14.5 embryos. Loss of Egr-2 did not impair the production of CD11b+Gr-1+ or CD11b+Gr-1− myeloid cells (data not shown). Furthermore, Egr-2−/− Lin− hematopoietic progenitors could be induced to differentiate into macrophages by culturing in M-CSF (Figure 4A). Since macrophages express Egr-1, which is also not essential for macrophage differentiation (Lee et al., 1996Lee S.L. Wang Y. Milbrandt J. Unimpaired macrophage differentiation and activation in mice lacking the zinc finger transplantation factor NGFI-A (EGR1).Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4566-4572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we reasoned that the two regulators may functionally substitute for one another. Egr-2−/− macrophages express wild-type levels of Egr-1, but not detectable levels of Egr-3 and Egr-4 (Figure 4A). Furthermore, in the PU.1−/− progenitors, induction of PUER results in the expression of Egr-2 and downregulation of Egr-1 (Figure 4A), thereby likely accounting for our ability to reveal a nonredundant function for Egr-2 in macrophage differentiation in these cells. We directly tested the redundant functions of Egr-1,2 by using the PU.1−/− cell system. Initially, we complemented shEgr-2 cells by expressing human Egr-2 (Figure 4B). This resulted in the restoration of PU.1-dependent macrophage differentiation comparable to that of control cells based on morphology, F4/80 expression, and the downregulation of neutrophil genes. Importantly, increased expression of murine Egr-1 in shEgr-2 cells also complemented the mutant phenotype (Figure 3B). We note that neither Egr-1 nor Egr-2 promoted macrophage differentiation in the absence of PU.1 induction (data not shown). Thus, Egr-1 and Egr-2 function redundantly in promoting macrophage differentiation and repressing neutrophil genes. To test the redundant role of Egr-1,2 in primary hematopoietic progenitors, we employed a dominant-negative Egr protein. This protein (δEgr-2) represents the zinc finger DNA binding domain (amino acids 330–470) of murine Egr-2 and lacks both trans-activation and Nab interaction domains. We generated PUERhi cells stably expressing the δEgr-2 construct. Induction of PU.1 activity in these cells resulted in a significant loss of F4/80+ cells, and importantly, mis-expression of Gfi-1 (Figure 4C). These phenotypes paralleled those of the shEgr-2 cells, thereby validating the utility of the δEgr-2 protein. Fetal liver Lin− hematopoietic progenitors from Egr-1−/− mice can differentiate into macrophages as a result of Egr-2 expression. Expression of δEgr-2 in these progenitors impaired their M-CSF-dependent differentiation into CD11b+F4/80+ macrophages (Figure 4D). These results strongly suggest that Egr-1 and Egr-2 function redundantly to regulate the differentiation of primary hematopoietic progenitors into macrophages. Loss of Egr-1 and Egr-2 results in early embryonic lethality (Grose et al., 2002Grose R. Harris B.S. Cooper L. Topilko P. Martin P. Immediate early genes krox-24 and krox-20 are rapidly up-regulated after wounding in the embryonic and adult mouse.Dev. Dyn. 2002; 223: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Therefore, to genetically test the redundant functions of Egr-1 and Egr-2 in regulating macrophage development, we made use of Egr-1−/−Egr-2+/− compound mutant mice. These mutant mice appeared healthy yet displayed severe growth retardation when compared to their wild-type, Egr-1−/−, or Egr-2+/− littermates (Figure 5A, data not shown). This size difference correlated with a decrease (control 21.41 ± 2.82 g; Egr-1−/−Egr-2+/− 15.08 ± 2.14 g; n = 5) in total body weight. There were no notable abnormalities in the hematopoietic system in 5-week-old compound mutant mice in relation to their Egr-1−/− counterparts as determined by peripheral blood and bone marrow differentials (data not shown). We analyzed hematopoietic progenitors from these mice for their ability to undergo M-CSF-dependent differentiation. The compound mutant progenitors gave rise to fewer CFU-M colonies in methylcellulose assays, and the majority of these colonies were smaller in size than those of their Egr-1−/− control counterparts (Figure 5B). In contrast, macrophage differentiation in response to GM-CSF was unimpaired. When plated in liquid culture in M-CSF, the Egr-1−/−Egr-2+/− progenitors gave rise to substantially fewer (6-fold) F4/80+ macrophages (Figure 5C). Importantly, the CD11b+Gr-1-F4/80− macrophage precursors generated from the compound mutant progenitors expressed higher levels of Gfi-1 (3-fold) and lower levels of PU.1 (3-fold) transcripts (Figure 5D). Thus, Egr-1−/−Egr-2+/− hematopoietic progenitors are defective in undergoing M-CSF-dependent macrophage differentiation and fail to properly repress the Gfi-1 gene. In vivo, homeostatic mechanisms, e.g. GM-CSF signaling, may enable restoration of the macrophage compartment. Nevertheless, these results provide genetic support for the redundant roles of Egr-1 and Egr-2 in promoting macrophage differentiation and repressing the Gfi-1 gene. To analyze how the cross-antagonism between Egr-1,2/Nab-2 and Gfi-1 initiates and resolves a mixed lineage pattern of gene expression, we assembled a minimal regulatory network for the macrophage-neutrophil developmental program based on our results and earlier findings (Dahl et al., 2003Dahl R.

Cognitive deficits following Aβ elevation are seen in amyloid-depositing models such as double transgenic (Tg) mice overexpressing APP (K670N:M671L) together with PS1 (M146L) (APP/PS1 mice). These mice overproduce Aβ and show inhibition of long-term potentiation (LTP), a type of synaptic plasticity related to memory, at young ages (Trinchese et al., 2004Trinchese F. Liu S. Battaglia F.

Since application of Aβ to hippocampal slices from wild-type (wt) animals inhibits LTP, the deficit in Tg animals is likely to be due to Aβ rather than other changes in the brain (Cullen et al., 1997Cullen W.K.

LTP inhibition in slices is reversible by treatments that raise the intracellular concentration of cyclic AMP (cAMP) (Vitolo et al., 2002Vitolo O.V. Sant'Angelo A. Costanzo V. Battaglia F. Arancio O.

It has been proposed that the effect of Aβ on LTP and memory is mediated by the inhibition of phosphorylation of the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) (Dineley et al., 2001Dineley K.T.

USA. 2002; 99: 13217-13221Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar), a transcription factor that is activated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). PKA activity is regulated both by the dissociation of its catalytic and regulatory subunits and by the degradation of its regulatory subunits by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) (Chain et al., 1999Chain D.G. Casadio A. Schacher S. Hegde A.N. Valbrun M. Yamamoto N. Goldberg A.L. Bartsch D. Kandel E.R. Schwartz J.H.

Moreover, long-term facilitation, a form of plasticity occurring in Aplysia, is mediated by a concurrent increase of cAMP and of a neuron-specific ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase (Uch), an enzyme that enhances the recycling of ubiquitin (Hegde et al., 1997Hegde A.N. Inokuchi K. Pei W. Casadio A. Ghirardi M. Chain D.G. Martin K.C. Kandel E.R. Schwartz J.H.

The brains of AD patients show an accumulation of ubiquinated proteins (de Vrij et al., 2004de Vrij F.M. Fischer D.F. van Leeuwen F.W. Hol E.M. Protein quality control in Alzheimer's disease by the ubiquitin proteasome system.Prog. Neurobiol. 2004; 74: 249-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), suggesting inhibition of the protein degradation machinery. Analysis of proteasome function in postmortem human AD brains shows little change in the levels of mRNA or protein for the major proteasomal components but a strong inhibition of degradative activity (Keller et al., 2000Keller J.N. Hanni K.B. Markesbery W.R. Impaired proteasome function in Alzheimer's disease.J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 436-439Crossref Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Uch-L1, a neuron- and testis-specific enzyme, is downregulated in AD brains. AD brains show prominent Uch-L1 immunostaining associated with neurofibrillary tangles and levels of soluble Uch-L1 inversely proportional to the number of tangles (Choi et al., 2004Choi J. Levey A.I. Weintraub S.T. Rees H.D. Gearing M. Chin L.S. Li L. Oxidative modifications and down-regulation of ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase L1 associated with idiopathic Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13256-13264Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). We investigated the effects of Uch-L1 inhibition on LTP and memory and asked if increasing Uch activity by the application of a fusion protein containing Uch-L1 rescues synaptic dysfunction in hippocampal slices treated with oligomeric Aβ. These studies were validated on the APP/PS1 model of AD. We also examined whether Uch activity and levels of Uch-L1 are modified in the double Tg mice. Finally we examined the effects of exogenous Uch-L1 on the PKA-CREB pathway. To test if Uch-L1 is required for synaptic function in the mouse brain we measured hydrolase activity and LTP in hippocampal slices exposed to the Uch-L1 inhibitor, LDN-57444 (LDN), a reversible, competitive, active site-directed isatin oxime with an IC50 value of 0.88 μM for Uch-L1 and 25 μM for its systemic isoform, Uch-L3 (Liu et al., 2002Liu Y. Fallon L. Lashuel H.A. Liu Z. Lansbury Jr., P.T. The UCH-L1 gene encodes two opposing enzymatic activities that affect alpha-synuclein degradation and Parkinson's disease susceptibility.Cell. 2002; 111: 209-218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). Maximal inhibition of Uch activity (70%) was obtained with 5 μM LDN in 1 hr (Figures 1A and 1B). This was not due to inhibition of Uch-L3 since there was no reduction in hydrolysis of Nedd8-AMC, a ubiquitin-like protein that binds to and is cleaved by Uch-L3, when 20 nM Uch-L3 was incubated with 5 μM LDN (Wada et al., 1998Wada H. Kito K. Caskey L.S. Yeh E.T. Kamitani T. Cleavage of the C-terminus of NEDD8 by UCH-L3.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 688-692Crossref Scopus (120) Google Scholar) (Figure S1A). We found a 15 min perfusion with 5 μM LDN reduced enzymatic activity by 20% but did not affect basal synaptic transmission (BST) or LTP at the CA3-CA1 connection (Figures S1B and S1C). A 2 hr exposure reduced activity by 70% and diminished LTP without affecting BST, and a 4 hr exposure reduced both BST and LTP (Figures 1C–1F). A similar reduction in LTP with normal BST was observed following 2–4 hr of perfusion with 2.7 μM LDN (Figure S1D) that reduced enzymatic activity by ∼40% but not with a concentration of 1 μM that produced only a 20% reduction (Figure 1A). These findings are consistent with recent work showing normal LTP, contextual learning, and cued learning in Uch-L3 null mice (Wood et al., 2005Wood M.A. Kaplan M.P. Brensinger C.M. Guo W. Abel T. Ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L3 (Uchl3) is involved in working memory.Hippocampus. 2005; 15: 610-621Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The LDN-induced alterations are similar to those induced by Aβ treatment and those seen in APP/PS1 mice (see below) where we have found Uch-L1 activity to be decreased by approximately 30% (Figure 2A).Figure 2TAT-Linked Uch-L1 Retains Biological ActivityShow full caption(A) Preincubation for 1 hr with V-Uch-L1 (20 nM) re-established normal Uch activity in slices exposed to 200 nM Aβ for 20 min (n = 9 in all groups, p < 0.01 in the Aβ group compared to the vehicle group).(B) Western blotting shows that 1 hr preincubation with V-Uch-L1 (20 nM) blocks the decrease of monoubiquitin levels in hippocampal slices treated with 200 nM Aβ for 20 min.

To manipulate the levels of Uch-L1, we produced a fusion protein in which the 11-amino acid transduction domain of the HIV-transactivator protein (TAT) was fused with an HA tag and Uch-L1 (TAT-HA-Uch-L1 = V-Uch-L1) (Wadia and Dowdy, 2003Wadia J.S.

Transducible V fusogenic peptide enhances escape of TAT-fusion proteins after lipid raft macropinocytosis.Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 310-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (1328) Google Scholar). As controls we produced fusion proteins between TAT and HA (TAT-HA = V) and between TAT and inactive Uch-L1 from which 57 amino acids (130 to 186) are deleted (V-iUch-L1) (see below). Hippocampal slices perfused with V-Uch-L1, V-iUch-L1, or V (20 nM) for 1 hr followed by fixation and staining with anti-Uch-L1 or anti-HA, as appropriate, showed a 3-fold increase in staining intensity as compared to vehicle-treated slices from the same animals (Figure S2A). These proteins also enter the brains of living animals following i.p. injection and cultured neurons (Supplemental Results and Figures S2B and S2C). Finally, V-Uch-L1 is found exclusively in the soluble fraction of hippocampal homogenates 1 hr after its administration (Figure S2D). Uch enzymes play a major role in the generation of monomeric ubiquitin (Wilkinson, 2000Wilkinson K.D. Ubiquitination and deubiquitination: targeting of proteins for degradation by the proteasome.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 141-148Crossref Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Treatment with oligomeric Aβ42 (200 nM for 20 min) decreases monoubiquitin levels by ∼70% (Figure 2B). When slices are incubated for 1 hr with V-Uch-L1 (20 nM) before Aβ treatment (20 min in the continued presence of V-Uch-L1) normal monoubiquitin levels and Uch activity are maintained (Figures 2A and 2B). V-Uch-L1 alone produced a slight increase in monoubiquitin levels and in enzymatic activity while inactive V-iUch-L1 and V had no effect. These results show that the V-Uch-L1 fusion protein enters cells, is enzymatically active, and is capable of re-establishing normal hydrolase levels. Perfusion of hippocampal slices with oligomeric Aβ (200 nM) reduces LTP by ∼60% in CA1 compared to vehicle-treated controls (Figures 3A and 3B) (Cullen et al., 1997Cullen W.K. Suh Y.H. Anwyl R.

Pretreatment with V-Uch-L1 (20 nM) for 1 hr followed by perfusion with 200 nM oligomeric Aβ plus V-Uch-L1 before theta-burst stimulation protected against LTP suppression (Figure 3A). V-iUch-L1 was not protective (Figure 3B). V-Uch-L1 alone had no effect on LTP evoked with 3 theta-burst trains, but it enhanced LTP when applied before a weaker tetanus (1 theta-burst train) (Figure S3), suggesting that the stronger tetanus produces maximal potentiation that cannot be further augmented by exogenous Uch-L1 (a similar finding was observed with the PDE4 inhibitor rolipram that increased LTP following weak tetanus [Barad et al., 1998Barad M. Bourtchouladze R. Winder D.G. Golan H. Kandel E. Rolipram, a type IV-specific phosphodiesterase inhibitor, facilitates the establishment of long-lasting long-term potentiation and improves memory.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Arancio O. Shelanski M. Amyloid beta -peptide inhibition of the PKA/CREB pathway and long-term potentiation: reversibility by drugs that enhance cAMP signaling.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 13217-13221Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar]). These results show clear parallels between the effect of V-Uch-L1 on hydrolase activity and its ability to block deleterious actions of Aβ. However, Uch-L1 has two distinct enzymatic activities. The C90 and H161 sites are involved in both hydrolase and ligase function whereas the S18 site modulates dimer formation that correlates with the ligase activity (Liu et al., 2002Liu Y. Fallon L. Lashuel H.A. Liu Z. Lansbury Jr., P.T. The UCH-L1 gene encodes two opposing enzymatic activities that affect alpha-synuclein degradation and Parkinson's disease susceptibility.Cell. 2002; 111: 209-218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). To investigate which function of Uch-L1 is involved in its effect on Aβ-induced block of LTP, we used site-directed mutagenesis to produce three mutant constructs of V-Uch-L1: V-Uch-L1(C90S), V-Uch-L1(S18Y), and V-iUch-L1. The last of these has a 57 amino acid deletion (130–186) including the H161 site. V-Uch-L1 and V-Uch-L1(S18Y) have similar hydrolase activity, while V-Uch-L1(C90S), V, and V-iUch-L1 have little or no activity (Figure 3C). Preincubation (1 hr) with either V-Uch-L1(C90S) or V-iUch-L1 failed to protect against LTP suppression while V-Uch-L1(S18Y) protected to the same extent as an unmodified construct (Figures 3D and 3E). V-Uch-L1(C90S) alone produced a significant decrease (∼60%) in potentiation compared to slices treated with vehicle or V-iUch-L1 (Figures 3D and 3E), suggesting that it is a dominant-negative inhibitor. Since the S18Y form dimerizes at higher concentrations than wt Uch-L1 (Liu et al., 2002Liu Y. Fallon L. Lashuel H.A. Liu Z. Lansbury Jr., P.T. The UCH-L1 gene encodes two opposing enzymatic activities that affect alpha-synuclein degradation and Parkinson's disease susceptibility.Cell. 2002; 111: 209-218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of different concentrations of V-Uch-L1 and V-Uch-L1(S18Y) on LTP rescue after Aβ, reasoning that the lower ligase activity of the S18Y form at a given concentration should produce less potentiation if ligase activity is critical for rescue. We found no difference in the two (Figure 3F). We also examined dimer formation by V-Uch-L1 at concentrations of 1 μM and 5 μM—many times higher than those used in these experiments—and found no dimer formation at 1 μM (Figure S4). Similar results were obtained in slices from APP/PS1 mice. These mice start depositing Aβ at 8–10 weeks and partially reproduce the cognitive deficits that occur in AD patients. They display impaired LTP and contextual learning at 3–4 months of age and deficits in BST at 5–6 months of age (Trinchese et al., 2004Trinchese F. Liu S. Battaglia F. Walter S. Mathews P.M. Arancio O. Progressive age-related development of Alzheimer-like pathology in APP/PS1 mice.Ann. Neurol. 2004; 55: 801-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). They also show a reduction of basal CREB levels (Gong et al., 2004Gong B. Vitolo O.V. Trinchese F. Liu S. Shelanski M. Arancio O. Persistent improvement in synaptic and cognitive functions in an Alzheimer mouse model following rolipram treatment.J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 114: 1624-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar) and an increase in PKA-RIIα subunit (Figure S5). Examination of Uch-L1 in these animals revealed little difference between APP/PS1 and wt mice in mRNA levels for Uch-L1 (Figure 4A) or Uch-L3 (Figure S6A). There was no change in total Uch-L1 protein level in their hippocampi. However, there was a ∼30% decrease of Uch-L1 protein in the soluble fraction of hippocampal homogenates from APP/PS1 mice compared to wt littermates with a similar increase in the insoluble fraction (Figures 4B and 4C). This reduction is reflected in the soluble Uch activity. The specific activity of the Uch-L1 in the insoluble fraction was very low (∼15% of the soluble enzyme). Thus, the total activity in the APP/PS1 mice was decreased (Figure 4D). APP/PS1 mice showed a 30% decrease in total hippocampal hydrolase activity at 4–6 months and a 45% loss at 15–18 months. Single Tg APP mice showed only a slight decrease of activity at 4–6 months but a 30% loss at 15–18 months. wt and single Tg PS1 mice did not differ significantly and showed a reduction of about 10% in activity at 15–18 months (Figure 4E). When mice were injected with V-Uch-L1 (0.02–0.04 g/kg, i.p.), Uch activity returned to control levels in APP/PS1 mice and increased above control level in wt mice (Figure 4F). Since the Ub-AMC assay is not specific for Uch-L1, we also measured Uch-L3 protein in soluble and insoluble fractions of hippocampal tissue from APP/PS1 and wt littermates and used the Nedd8-AMC assay to examine total Uch-L3 activity (Figure S6). We found no difference in either among genotypes, suggesting that Uch-L3 is not involved in the decrease of hydrolase activity. Taken together these findings support the hypothesis that a reduction in Uch-L1 protein levels leads to a lower hydrolase activity and the impairment of both synaptic function and cognition in the APP/PS1 mice. The loss of hydrolase activity in the APP/PS1 mice is less than the reduction in slices treated with 5 μM LDN for 60 min (∼30% versus ∼70%), suggesting that Uch-L1 activity is not completely blocked in APP/PS1 mice. Indeed, if hippocampal slices of wt and APP/PS1 mice were exposed for 2 hr to 5 μM LDN, the inhibitor reduces enzymatic activity to the same level in the two genotypes (∼70% of values in vehicle-treated wt slices) (Figure S7A). However, LDN (5 μM for 2 hr) does not reduce potentiation further in APP/PS1 slices or in wt slices exposed to 200 nM Aβ (Figures S7B and S7C), suggesting that a 30% decrease of hydrolase activity is sufficient to produce maximal levels of LTP reduction. When hippocampal slices from 4-month-old APP/PS1 mice are perfused with V-Uch-L1 (20 nM) for 1 hr, Uch activity is restored and LTP amplitude following theta burst is elevated above vehicle-treated slices and is similar to that of wt mice (Figures 5A and 5B). Neither V- nor V-iUch-L1-treated slices differed from vehicle-treated slices. V-Uch-L1 had no effect on LTP amplitude in hippocampal slices from wt mice (Figure 5B). There was no difference in BST among the different groups as measured by plotting the fEPSP slope versus the stimulus intensity or versus the amplitude of the fiber afferent volley (data not shown). Similar effects were seen in older APP/PS1 mice (12–18 months) with severe plaque load (Figures 5C and 5D). BST in APP/PS1 mice, initially lower than in wt mice, was also improved in the V-Uch-L1 group as compared to vehicle- or V-iUch-L1-treated slices (Figure 5E). Fear conditioning, a form of learning impaired in several AD mouse models (Dineley et al., 2002Dineley K.T. Xia X. Bui D. Sweatt J.D. Zheng H.

Persistent improvement in synaptic and cognitive functions in an Alzheimer mouse model following rolipram treatment.J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 114: 1624-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), was used to determine whether Uch-L1 is critical in this form of memory in mice. The fear-conditioning paradigm depends on the hippocampus and amygdala. The hippocampus is required for contextual fear learning (Phillips and LeDoux, 1992Phillips R.G. LeDoux J.E. Differential contribution of amygdala and hippocampus to cued and contextual fear conditioning.Behav. Neurosci. 1992; 106: 274-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (2490) Google Scholar), a form of associative memory in which mice must associate a neutral stimulus with an aversive one. We used the inhibitor LDN to probe the role of Uch-L1 in this process. Following a single i.p. injection of inhibitor (0.4 mg/kg), maximal inhibition of hydrolase activity (∼40% of control) was seen at 30 min post-injection with recovery by 8 hr (Figure 6A). For fear conditioning, LDN-treated and vehicle-treated mice were placed in a novel context (fear-conditioning box) and were exposed to a tone (conditioned stimulus [CS]) paired with a mild foot shock (unconditioned stimulus [US]) (training phase of the fear conditioning) (Bourtchuladze et al., 1994Bourtchuladze R. Frenguelli B. Blendy J. Cioffi D. Schutz G. Silva A.J. Deficient long-term memory in mice with a targeted mutation of the cAMP-responsive element-binding protein.Cell. 1994; 79: 59-68Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1537) Google Scholar). Conditioning was assessed 24 hr later by measuring “freezing” behavior—the absence of all movement except respiration—in response to the context (contextual conditioning) or the auditory cue (CS) within a completely different context (cued conditioning). During the training phase, no difference in the freezing of LDN- or vehicle-injected mice was seen. Twenty-four hours later there was a decrease in the freezing time of LDN-treated mice to 65% of that of vehicle-treated mice in contextual conditioning (Figure 6B). On the other hand, cued fear conditioning showed no difference in freezing behavior between the two groups (data not shown), suggesting that the amygdala, which is involved mainly in cued conditioning (Phillips and LeDoux, 1992Phillips R.G. LeDoux J.E. Differential contribution of amygdala and hippocampus to cued and contextual fear conditioning.Behav. Neurosci. 1992; 106: 274-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (2490) Google Scholar), is not impaired by Uch-L1 inhibition. The difference in the freezing time persisted when contextual learning was assessed 7, 14, and 21 days after exposure to the electric shock, with LDN-injected mice having values of 70% of those in vehicle-treated mice at 21 days (Figure 6B). LDN failed to impair contextual learning when it was injected at 4 and 1 hr before the shock or at 1 hr after the shock (Supplemental Experimental Procedures), suggesting that there is a time window at 4 hr after the electric shock during which Uch-L1 is required for contextual fear memory processes in hippocampus. Similar to LDN, V-Uch-L1(C90S) (0.04 g/kg i.p., injected 4 hr after the electric shock) impaired contextual learning assessed at 1 day and at 7, 14, and 21 days compared to vehicle-treated mice (Figure 6C), suggesting that it is a dominant-negative inhibitor as described above for the experiments on LTP (Figure 3D). When 3- to 5-month-old APP/PS1 mice were injected with V-Uch-L1 or V-iUch-L1 or V (0.02-0.04 g/kg, i.p.) 4 hr before training, no significant differences in freezing behavior were seen between the groups in the training phase. Treatment with V-Uch-L1 in APP/PS1 mice failed to re-establish normal freezing when the animals were reintroduced into the same context 1 day after training (Figure 6D). There were also no differences between the four groups in cued conditioning (data not shown). However, treatment with V-Uch-L1 greatly increased the freezing time in APP/PS1 mice compared to V-iUch-L1- and V-treated APP/PS1 littermates when contextual learning was assessed over time. V-Uch-L1-treated APP/PS1 mice showed about 85% of the freezing time of wt mice, compared to ∼40% for V-iUch-L1-treated APP/PS1 mice at 21 days after training. V-Uch-L1 did not change the freezing time in wt littermates compared with control wt mice (∼95% that of V-iUch-L1-treated wt mice) (Figure 6D). Given the physiological and behavioral effects of V-Uch-L1 treatment in APP/PS1 mice, we examined whether treatment with V-Uch-L1 affected Aβ levels, a hallmark of AD. ELISA of extracts of hippocampal and cerebral cortices revealed no difference in Aβ42 levels 4 hr after injection of V-Uch-L1 (0.02–0.04 g/kg, i.p.) in 4-month-old APP/PS1 mice (hippocampal Aβ42, about 94% that of vehicle-treated APP/PS1 mice; cortical Aβ42, about 104%; Figure S8A). No Aβ was detected in wt littermates. Similar results were obtained by measuring Aβ levels in mice that received V-Uch-L1 and were tested for fear conditioning over 21 days (hippocampal Aβ42, about 106% that of vehicle-treated APP/PS1 mice; cortical Aβ42, about 103%; Figure S8B). Thus, it is unlikely that a single injection of V-Uch-L1 produces its beneficial effects on learning and memory in the APP/PS1 mice by interfering with Aβ production or clearance (Supplemental Discussion). Taken together, these data strongly suggest that Uch-L1 activity plays a role in normal contextual fear learning, that exogenous Uch-L1 improves the retention of contextual learning in APP/PS1 mice, and that the changes are not dependent on changes in Aβ levels.

Activated Yorkie drives growth by stimulating cell proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis, but how it achieves this is not understood. Yorkie is known to activate Cyclin E (CycE) and the apoptosis inhibitor DIAP1. However, overexpression of these targets is not sufficient to cause tissue overgrowth. Here we show that Yorkie also activates expression of the bantam microRNA, a known regulator of both proliferation and apoptosis. bantam overexpression mimics Yorkie activation while loss of bantam function slows the rate of cell proliferation. bantam is necessary for Yorkie-induced overproliferation and bantam overexpression is sufficient to rescue survival and proliferation of yorkie mutant cells. Finally, we show that bantam levels are regulated during both developmentally programmed proliferation arrest and apoptosis. In summary, the results show that the Hippo pathway regulates expression of bantam to control tissue growth in Drosophila."
https://openalex.org/W1971159715,"The exon junction complex (EJC) plays a major role in posttranscriptional regulation of mRNA in metazoa. The EJC is deposited onto mRNA during splicing and is transported to the cytoplasm where it influences translation, surveillance, and localization of the spliced mRNA. The complex is formed by the association of four proteins (eIF4AIII, Barentsz [Btz], Mago, and Y14), mRNA, and ATP. The 2.2 Å resolution structure of the EJC reveals how it stably locks onto mRNA. The DEAD-box protein eIF4AIII encloses an ATP molecule and provides the binding sites for six ribonucleotides. Btz wraps around eIF4AIII and stacks against the 5′ nucleotide. An intertwined network of interactions anchors Mago-Y14 and Btz at the interface between the two domains of eIF4AIII, effectively stabilizing the ATP bound state. Comparison with the structure of the eIF4AIII-Btz subcomplex that we have also determined reveals that large conformational changes are required upon EJC assembly and disassembly.

Comparison with the structure of the eIF4AIII-Btz subcomplex that we have also determined reveals that large conformational changes are required upon EJC assembly and disassembly. The expression of protein-encoding genes in eukaryotes involves a series of steps, starting from transcription, through processing of the precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA), to translation, and ultimately to decay in the cytoplasm. Although these steps are mechanistically distinct, they are functionally coupled, contributing to the efficiency and fidelity of gene expression (reviewed in Moore, 2005Moore M.J. From birth to death: the complex lives of eukaryotic mRNAs.Science. 2005; 309: 1514-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). A well-known example in this context is the influence of nuclear splicing on translational yield, stability, and localization of mRNAs, events that occur long after the intron lariat has been excised (reviewed in Le Hir et al., 2003Le Hir H. Nott A. Moore M.J. How introns influence and enhance eukaryotic gene expression.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 215-220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). How the molecular memory of introns is carried forward to the cytoplasm had been a puzzling question until the discovery that splicing not only alters the nucleotide sequence of the nascent transcript but also deposits a protein complex, the exon junction complex (EJC), as a landmark on the transcript (Le Hir et al., 2000Le Hir H. Izaurralde E. Maquat L.E. Moore M.J. The spliceosome deposits multiple proteins 20-24 nucleotides upstream of mRNA exon-exon junctions.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6860-6869Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). In human cells, the EJC is assembled during the second step of splicing, when the lariat has been formed and the exons are being ligated (Reichert et al., 2002Reichert V.L. Le Hir H. Jurica M.S. Moore M.J. 5′ exon interactions within the human spliceosome establish a framework for exon junction complex structure and assembly.Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2778-2791Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) (Shibuya et al., 2004Shibuya T. Tange T.O. Sonenberg N. Moore M.J. eIF4AIII binds spliced mRNA in the exon junction complex and is essential for nonsense-mediated decay.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The complex is loaded onto the mRNA in a sequence-independent manner at a fixed distance (20–24 nucleotides) upstream of the exon-exon junction (Le Hir et al., 2000Le Hir H. Izaurralde E. Maquat L.E. Moore M.J. The spliceosome deposits multiple proteins 20-24 nucleotides upstream of mRNA exon-exon junctions.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6860-6869Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). The EJC remains stably bound at this position as the mature messenger ribonucleoprotein particle (mRNP) is exported to the cytoplasm. The stable core of the complex contains four proteins: Mago, Y14, eIF4AIII, and Barentsz (Btz, also known as MLN51). As it proceeds through the different cellular environments, the EJC core acquires and loses additional factors. Peripherally associated proteins include splicing coactivators (Srm160, Pinin, RNPS1), mRNA export factors (REF/Aly, TAP-p15) and factors involved in cytoplasmic mRNA surveillance (UPF3 and UPF2) (reviewed in Tange et al., 2004Tange T.O. Nott A. Moore M.J. The ever-increasing complexities of the exon junction complex.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Thus, the EJC provides a platform for anchoring proteins that function at different steps of mRNA metabolism. The complex is believed to be eventually removed by ribosomes in the first or “pioneering” round of translation (Dostie and Dreyfuss, 2002Dostie J. Dreyfuss G.

Surveillance of mRNAs by the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway has long been known to depend on exon-exon boundaries in human cells (Cheng et al., 1994Cheng J. Belgrader P. Zhou X. Maquat L.E. Introns are cis effectors of the nonosense-codon-mediated reduction in nuclear mRNA abundance.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8219-8228Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). NMD elicits rapid degradation of aberrant mRNAs containing a premature stop codon (PTC) if an exon-exon junction is present at least 50 nucleotides downstream of a stop codon (reviewed in Conti and Izaurralde, 2005Conti E.

Mechanistic links between nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and pre-mRNA splicing in mammalian cells.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). NMD can be recapitulated by tethering either Mago, Y14, eIF4AIII, or Btz within the 3′ UTR of a reporter mRNA in human cells, as in the case of the bona fide NMD factor UPF3 (Ferraiuolo et al., 2004Ferraiuolo M.A. Lee C.S.

Biol. 2004; 11: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). This indicates that when present downstream of a translation termination site, the EJC coordinates a series of interactions necessary for NMD, thus providing the direct molecular link for splicing-dependent PTC recognition. When present upstream of the stop codon (i.e., in a normal situation), the EJC increases the translational yield of the mRNA. Tethering EJC core components within the open reading frame of a reporter mRNA enhances polysome association (Nott et al., 2004Nott A. Le Hir H. Moore M.J. Splicing enhances translation in mammalian cells: an additional function of the exon junction complex.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 210-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The EJC is thus the direct link for the stimulatory effect of splicing on mRNA translation (Lu and Cullen, 2003Lu S. Cullen B.R.

The core components of the human EJC are conserved in other eukaryotes, with the notable exception of S. cerevisiae. Drosophila Mago, Y14, eIF4AIII, and Btz are all essential for the localization of oskar mRNA at the posterior pole of the oocyte (Hachet and Ephrussi, 2001Hachet O. Ephrussi A.

Cell Biol. 1991; 154: 511-523Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Oskar mRNA localization is required for germ line and abdomen formation in Drosophila and is dependent on splicing (Hachet and Ephrussi, 2004Hachet O. Ephrussi A. Splicing of oskar RNA in the nucleus is coupled to its cytoplasmic localization.Nature. 2004; 428: 959-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). In contrast to what is observed in human cells, neither splicing nor the EJC are required for NMD in Drosophila (Gatfield et al., 2003Gatfield D. Unterholzner L. Ciccarelli F.D. Bork P. Izaurralde E. Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay in Drosophila: at the intersection of the yeast and mammalian pathways.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3960-3970Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). These data suggest that although a structurally homologous EJC complex exists in Drosophila, the EJC splicing “mark” imprinted on the mRNA is interpreted to trigger different cytoplasmic events in this organism. In human cells, Btz has also been found as a component of dendritic mRNPs in hippocampal neurons, suggesting that in humans the EJC might also be involved in either localization or regulated expression of specific mRNAs (Macchi et al., 2003Macchi P. Kroening S. Palacios I.M. Baldassa S. Grunewald B. Ambrosino C. Goetze N. Lupas A. St Johnston D. Kiebler M.A. Barentsz, a new component of the Staufen-containing ribonucleoprotein particles in mammalian cells, interacts with Staufen in an RNA-dependent manner.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5778-5788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). EJC assembly is splicing dependent in vivo but can be recapitulated in vitro when all the constituent components of the complex are simultaneously present (Ballut et al., 2005Ballut L. Marchadier B. Baguet A. Tomasetto C. Seraphin B. Le Hir H. The exon junction core complex is locked onto RNA by inhibition of eIF4AIII ATPase activity.Nat. Struct. Mol.

Biochemical analysis of the EJC reveals two new factors and a stable tetrameric protein core.RNA. 2005; 11: 1869-1883Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). EJC assembly not only requires the protein components but also depends on the presence of ATP and single-stranded RNA, both of which are an integral part of the complex (Ballut et al., 2005Ballut L. Marchadier B. Baguet A. Tomasetto C. Seraphin B. Le Hir H. The exon junction core complex is locked onto RNA by inhibition of eIF4AIII ATPase activity.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 861-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The in vitro reconstituted EJC protects eight to nine nucleotides from nuclease digestion, corresponding to the footprint characteristic of the EJC assembled in a splicing reaction (Ballut et al., 2005Ballut L. Marchadier B. Baguet A. Tomasetto C. Seraphin B. Le Hir H. The exon junction core complex is locked onto RNA by inhibition of eIF4AIII ATPase activity.Nat. Struct. Mol.

The spliceosome deposits multiple proteins 20-24 nucleotides upstream of mRNA exon-exon junctions.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6860-6869Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). While Btz displays no homology to proteins of known function, eIF4AIII belongs to the well-studied family of DEAD-box proteins (reviewed in Cordin et al., 2006Cordin O. Banroques J. Tanner N.K. Linder P. The DEAD-box protein family of RNA helicases.Gene. 2006; 367: 17-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). Proteins belonging to this family have RNA-dependent ATPase activity and range from acting as “molecular motors” in unwinding nucleic acid duplexes (hence the name “helicase”) to RNA “place holders” as in the case of eIF4AIII (Shibuya et al., 2004Shibuya T. Tange T.O. Sonenberg N. Moore M.J. eIF4AIII binds spliced mRNA in the exon junction complex and is essential for nonsense-mediated decay.Nat. Struct. Mol.

Cell. 2001; 8: 251-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). In the EJC, the ATPase activity of eIF4AIII is inhibited by the presence of Mago and Y14 (Ballut et al., 2005Ballut L. Marchadier B. Baguet A. Tomasetto C. Seraphin B. Le Hir H. The exon junction core complex is locked onto RNA by inhibition of eIF4AIII ATPase activity.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 861-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). EJC incorporation is specific for eIF4AIII and does not occur with the highly similar translation initiation factor eIF4AI (Shibuya et al., 2006Shibuya T. Tange T.O. Stroupe M.E. Moore M.J. Mutational analysis of human eIF4AIII identifies regions necessary for exon junction complex formation and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay.RNA. 2006; 12: 360-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Understanding how the EJC is formed by the cooperative action of all its constituents requires knowledge of its three-dimensional structure, which we report here at 2.2 Å resolution. The crystal structure of the Mago-Y14-eIF4AIII-Btz-AMPPNP-U6 RNA complex also explains why the binding of RNA within the EJC is stable and specific, despite being sequence independent. The 3.0 Å resolution structure of the eIF4AIII-Btz subcomplex reveals a dramatic conformational change of the helicase domains as compared to EJC bound eIF4AIII. More generally, we propose that similarly to what observed for protein kinases, members of the DEAD-box family of proteins are likely to adopt a similar structure in their “on” state (when bound to ATP and RNA) despite having different conformations in their “off” states. The human EJC was reconstituted with the components previously described (Ballut et al., 2005Ballut L. Marchadier B. Baguet A. Tomasetto C. Seraphin B. Le Hir H. The exon junction core complex is locked onto RNA by inhibition of eIF4AIII ATPase activity.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 861-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Crystals that diffract to 3.2 Å resolution were obtained with the complex of Mago (full length), Y14 (residues 66–174, referred to as Y14ΔN), eIF4AIII (full length), Btz (the SELOR domain, residues 137–286, Degot et al., 2004Degot S. Le Hir Alpy F. Kedinger V. Stoll I. Wendling C. Seraphin B. Rio M.C. Tomasetto C.

Chem. 2004; 279: 33702-33715Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog (AMPPNP), and U15 RNA. A crystal form that diffracts to 2.2 Å resolution was obtained by reconstituting the EJC with a Y14 construct that also lacks the low-complexity C terminal region (Y14ΔCΔN, residues 66–154) (Figure 1). The 2.2 Å structure of the EJC (containing Y14ΔCΔN) was determined by molecular replacement and refined to an Rfree of 21.9% and R factor of 18.8%. It has good stereochemistry, with 91.4% of the residues lying in the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot (see Table 1 for data collection and refinement statistics). The final model includes six bases of polyU RNA, AMPPNP, essentially all of Mago-Y14 (Mago residues 4–146 and Y14 residues 66-154), most of eIF4AIII (except for the 20 N-terminal residues that are disordered), and two ordered stretches of Btz (residues 168–196 and 215–230) (Figure 1). The 3.2 Å structure of the EJC containing Y14ΔN does not show ordered electron density for the C-terminal region of Y14, but in this crystal form additional residues of Btz can be modeled (residues 168–196 and 214–248; Rfree of 27.7%, R factor of 23.3%).Table 1Crystallographic StatisticsData CollectionData SetEJC (Y14 ΔNΔC)EJC (Y14 ΔN)eIF4AIII-BtzSpace groupP64P212121C2221Unit cell (Å)a = b = 169.44 c = 71.04a = 69.15 b = 161.24 c = 193.24a = 71.76 b = 107.19 c = 243.95Wavelength (Å)0.9800.9800.980Resolution range (Å)aValues in parentheses correspond to the highest resolution shell.50-2.2 (2.3-2.2)50-3.2 (3.4-3.2)15-3.0 (3.2-3.0)Unique reflections586313492618221Completeness (%)aValues in parentheses correspond to the highest resolution shell.98.9 (95.6)95.4 (97.2)94.2 (86.4)I/σ (I)aValues in parentheses correspond to the highest resolution shell.11.1 (2.5)4.8 (2.0)4.3 (2.0)Rsym (%)aValues in parentheses correspond to the highest resolution shell.8.7 (54.5)24.7 (68.3)22.0 (61.8)RefinementResolution range (Å)aValues in parentheses correspond to the highest resolution shell.50-2.2 (2.3-2.2)50-3.2 (3.3-3.2)15-3.0 (3.1-3.0)Rfree (%)aValues in parentheses correspond to the highest resolution shell.21.9 (36.3)27.7 (41.0)32.5 (43.3)Rwork (%)aValues in parentheses correspond to the highest resolution shell.18.8 (30.1)23.3 (37.0)27.1 (35.7)Rmsd bond (Å)0.0140.0090.011Rmsd angle (°)1.51.31.4B factor protein (Å2)446752B factor ligands (Å2)5156Ramachandran valuesMost favored (%)91.486.583.7Additionally allowed (%)7.812.614.8Generously allowed (%)0.30.70.9Disallowed (%)0.50.20.6a Values in parentheses correspond to the highest resolution shell. Open table in a new tab The EJC structure resembles an L-shaped molecule, with eIF4AIII-Btz at the base of the assembly and Mago-Y14 arranged almost perpendicularly to it (Figure 2). The core structure of Mago-Y14 in the EJC is essentially identical to that observed for the heterodimer in isolation (Fribourg et al., 2003Fribourg S. Gatfield D. Izaurralde E. Conti E.

Xu R.M. Crystal structure of the Drosophila Mago nashi-Y14 complex.Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 971-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Mago folds into a flat antiparallel β sheet flanked on one side by two parallel α helices (blue, Figure 2). The α-helical surface of Mago interacts with the RNA binding domain (RBD) of Y14 (magenta, Figure 2). This protein-protein interaction is mediated by the β sheet surface of the RBD that is instead generally used in this type of folds to bind RNA (reviewed in Hall, 2002Hall T.M. RNA-protein interactions.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The β sheet surface of Mago is entirely exposed to solvent (Figure 2), but part of it is expected to interact with the N-terminal α helix of Y14 (Fribourg et al., 2003Fribourg S. Gatfield D. Izaurralde E. Conti E. A novel mode of RBD-protein recognition in the Y14-Mago complex.Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) that is not present in the construct crystallized. The domain organization of eIF4AIII (yellow in Figure 2) is typical of the DEAD-box family of proteins, with two RecA-like domains (reviewed in Cordin et al., 2006Cordin O. Banroques J. Tanner N.K. Linder P. The DEAD-box protein family of RNA helicases.Gene. 2006; 367: 17-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). The two domains are arranged to form a deep interdomain cleft where ATP binds (gray, Figure 2). Single-stranded RNA (black, Figure 2) binds with an overall bent conformation in a shallow cleft across the two RecA-like domains and is flanked on one side by Btz. Btz (red, Figure 2) does not have a globular fold; instead it extends with two separate stretches over both domains of eIF4AIII and also contacts Mago. The Mago-Y14 heterodimer interacts mainly with domain 2 of eIF4AIII but also docks into the interdomain cleft. Thus, the components of the EJC engage one another in a network of interactions that are centered at eIF4AIII (summarized in Figure 1). In eIF4AIII, the RecA-like domain 1 (residues 38–240) is joined to domain 2 (residues 251–411) by a 10-residue linker and is flanked by an N-terminal sequence that is characteristic of eIF4AIII (Figure 1A). Each RecA-like domain is formed by a parallel β sheet with loops on both the N-terminal and C-terminal ends of the β strands. These loops contain the motifs that are characteristic of the DEAD-box family of proteins (Cordin et al., 2006Cordin O. Banroques J. Tanner N.K. Linder P. The DEAD-box protein family of RNA helicases.Gene. 2006; 367: 17-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar, Gorbalenya and Koonin, 1993Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Helicases: amino acid sequence comparisons and structure-function relationships.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 419-429Crossref Scopus (990) Google Scholar) and are involved in either ATP binding or RNA binding (shown in green for domain 1 and in orange for domain 2 in Figures 3A and 3B). Within the EJC, the two domains of eIF4AIII are in close proximity and are oriented in such a way that the β sheets lie almost perpendicular to each other. The overall conformation of eIF4AIII in the EJC structure is similar to that observed for the Vasa helicase in complex with ATP and RNA (Figure 3C) (Sengoku et al., 2006Sengoku T. Nureki O. Nakamura A. Kobayashi S. Yokoyama S. Structural basis for RNA unwinding by the DEAD-Box protein drosophila Vasa.Cell. 2006; 125: 287-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). The two proteins superpose with a root mean square deviation (rmsd) of 1.7 Å over 369 α-carbon atoms, distributed over the entire molecule. This similarity is striking considering that previous structural studies of DEAD-box proteins in the absence of RNA have shown a variety of conformations. However, the comparison between eIF4AIII and Vasa is the first for two different DEAD-box proteins locked in the same on state, i.e., in a productive complex with ATP and nucleic acid. The ATP binding site is at an interface between the two RecA-like domains of eIF4AIII and is formed by the loops at the C-terminal ends of the domain 1 β strands (motifs Q, I, II, and III) and loops at the N-terminal ends of the domain 2 β strands (motifs V and VI) (Figure 3A). Motif I is the so-called Walker A motif (or P loop) and binds the ATP phosphate groups, in particular with Lys88 bridging the β and γ phosphates. Motif II is the Walker B motif (the Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp sequence from which the name of the DEAD-box family derives). Asp187 of motif II coordinates the magnesium ion together with Thr89 from motif I (Figure 3E and Figure S1). From domain 2, Asp342 of motif V contacts the ribose (at the 3′ OH), and Arg367 and Arg370 of motif VI interact with the γ phosphate of ATP. Of the three water molecules at the active site, one is the likely candidate for being activated by a general base for the in-line nucleophilic attack in the ATPase reaction (Figure 3E). This water is at 3.7 Å from the ATP γ-phosphate and is coordinated by Glu188 (motif II) and His363 (motif VI), which in turn is hydrogen bonded to Thr220 (motif III). The adenine base of ATP is bound both with specific hydrogen bonds (with Gln65 in the Q motif) and by stacking interactions (with Phe58 in the Q motif and with Tyr371 in motif VI). The C-terminal residue of Mago (Ile146) makes van der Waals contacts with Tyr371 of eIF4AIII, capping the adenine binding site (Figure 3E). Comparison with the structure of Vasa shows that ATP is held in place by a similar set of interactions. The only interaction with ATP that is not present in Vasa is the contribution of the C terminus of Mago to the hydrophobic environment of the adenine base. Instead, in Vasa a hydrophobic residue from the N-terminal flanking region (Phe225) is positioned at a similar structural position to Ile146 of Mago. Single-stranded RNA binds eIF4AIII on the opposite surface from the ATP binding site (Figure 2). Although the complex that was crystallized contained a U15 RNA, ordered electron density is observed only for six nucleotides (Figure S2). The nucleotides bind with the 3′ end interacting with domain 1 of eIF4AIII and with the 5′ end interacting with domain 2, where it is stacked against Btz (Figure 3B). Contacts are made primarily by the ribose-phosphate backbone of the nucleic acid, with the bases facing the solvent. The ribose and phosphate moieties bind in consecutive binding pockets formed by the sequential arrangement of the loops at the C-terminal end of the β sheets, which contain conserved helicase motifs (Figure 3B). Proceeding from U2 to U6, five phosphates contact sequentially motifs IV, V, QxxR (from domain 2), and Ia, GG, Ib (from domain 1). The fourth nucleotide (U4) is at the interface of the two domains, with its phosphate moiety interacting both with Arg316 and Arg116 (motifs QxxR and Ia, respectively) (Figures 3D and 3F). Four of the six nucleotides form hydrogen bonds between the 2′-OH groups of the riboses and eIF4AIII: U1 with Asn285 (motif IV), U3 with Pro114 (motif Ia), U4 with Gln200, and U5 with Asp169 (motif Ib) (Figure 3D). The uracyl bases form only a few specific contacts with eIF4AIII (Figure 3D). At the 5′ end, U1 stacks against the aromatic ring of Phe188 of Btz (Figure 3F). The bases of U1, U2, U3, and U4 also stack on each other. Between U4 and U5, the RNA bends dramatically, probably due to the position of motif Ib, which would sterically interfere with a straight RNA geometry (Figure 3B). This bent conformation of the RNA is similar to that observed in the Vasa helicase (Figure 3C), where it was suggested to play a role in unwinding of nucleic acids (Sengoku et al., 2006Sengoku T. Nureki O. Nakamura A. Kobayashi S. Yokoyama S. Structural basis for RNA unwinding by the DEAD-Box protein drosophila Vasa.Cell. 2006; 125: 287-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). The SELOR domain of Btz is molded on the surface of eIF4AIII with two separate stretches interacting with two distinct sites (Figure 2). The N-terminal stretch (residues 168–196) binds to domain 2 of eIF4AIII and the C-terminal stretch (residues 214–248) binds to domain 1. The two stretches contain all the residues of Btz that are conserved across species (Figure 1B). They are connected by a flexible linker, as judged by the lack of ordered electron density (represented by a dotted line in Figure 2A). The C-terminal stretch of Btz binds to the loops at the N-terminal end of the domain 1 β sheet. In this area there are extensive hydrophobic interactions: Bt"
https://openalex.org/W2151490567,"Cyclic di-guanosine monophosphate is a bacterial second messenger that has been implicated in biofilm formation, antibiotic resistance, and persistence of pathogenic bacteria in their animal host. Although the enzymes responsible for the regulation of cellular levels of c-di-GMP, diguanylate cyclases (DGC) and phosphodiesterases, have been identified recently, little information is available on the molecular mechanisms involved in controlling the activity of these key enzymes or on the specific interactions of c-di-GMP with effector proteins. By using a combination of genetic, biochemical, and modeling techniques we demonstrate that an allosteric binding site for c-di-GMP (I-site) is responsible for non-competitive product inhibition of DGCs. The I-site was mapped in both multi- and single domain DGC proteins and is fully contained within the GGDEF domain itself. In vivo selection experiments and kinetic analysis of the evolved I-site mutants led to the definition of an RXXD motif as the core c-di-GMP binding site. Based on these results and based on the observation that the I-site is conserved in a majority of known and potential DGC proteins, we propose that product inhibition of DGCs is of fundamental importance for c-di-GMP signaling and cellular homeostasis. The definition of the I-site binding pocket provides an entry point into unraveling the molecular mechanisms of ligand-protein interactions involved in c-di-GMP signaling and makes DGCs a valuable target for drug design to develop new strategies against biofilm-related diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2016983085,"The ER's capacity to process proteins is limited, and stress caused by accumulation of unfolded and misfolded proteins (ER stress) contributes to human disease. ER stress elicits the unfolded protein response (UPR), whose components attenuate protein synthesis, increase folding capacity, and enhance misfolded protein degradation. Here, we report that P58(IPK)/DNAJC3, a UPR-responsive gene previously implicated in translational control, encodes a cytosolic cochaperone that associates with the ER protein translocation channel Sec61. P58(IPK) recruits HSP70 chaperones to the cytosolic face of Sec61 and can be crosslinked to proteins entering the ER that are delayed at the translocon. Proteasome-mediated cytosolic degradation of translocating proteins delayed at Sec61 is cochaperone dependent. In P58(IPK-/-) mice, cells with a high secretory burden are markedly compromised in their ability to cope with ER stress. Thus, P58(IPK) is a key mediator of cotranslocational ER protein degradation, and this process likely contributes to ER homeostasis in stressed cells."
https://openalex.org/W2062266980,"Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated macrophages are pivotal in innate immunity. With LPS treatment, extracellular signals are transduced into macrophages via Toll-like receptor 4 and induce inflammatory mediator production by activating signaling pathways, including the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) pathway and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. However, the mechanisms by which the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) increases and protein kinase C (PKC) is activated remain unclear. Therefore, we investigated the signaling pathway for Ca2+- and PKC-dependent NF-kappaB activation, inducible nitric-oxide synthase expression, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) production in LPS-stimulated rat peritoneal macrophages. The results demonstrated that the LPS-induced transient [Ca2+]i increase is due to Ca2+ release and influx. Extracellular and intracellular Ca2+ chelators inhibited phosphorylation of PKCalpha and PKCbeta. A PKCbeta-specific and a general PKC inhibitor blunted phosphorylation of serine in mitogen-activated/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase kinase (MEKK) 1. Moreover, a MEKK inhibitor reduced activation of inhibitorykappaB kinase and NF-kappaB. Upstream of the [Ca2+]i increase, a protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor reduced phosphorylation of phospholipase C (PLC) gamma. Furthermore, a PLC inhibitor eliminated the transient [Ca2+]i increase and decreased the amount of activated PKC. Therefore, these results revealed the following roles of Ca2+ and PKC in the signaling pathway for NF-kappaB activation in LPS-stimulated macrophages. After LPS treatment, protein-tyrosine kinase mediates PLCgamma1/2 phosphorylation, which is followed by a [Ca2+]i increase. Several PKCs are activated, and PKCbeta regulates phosphorylation of serine in MEKK1. Moreover, MEKKs regulate inhibitory kappaB kinase activation. Sequentially, NF-kappaB is activated, and inducible nitric-oxide synthase and tumor necrosis factor-alpha production is promoted."
https://openalex.org/W2059781917,"The target of rapamycin (TOR) kinase is an important regulator of growth in eukaryotic cells. In budding yeast, Tor1p and Tor2p function as part of two distinct protein complexes, TORC1 and TORC2, where TORC1 is specifically inhibited by the antibiotic rapamycin. Significant insight into TORC1 function has been obtained using rapamycin as a specific small molecule inhibitor of TOR activity. Here we show that caffeine acts as a distinct and novel small molecule inhibitor of TORC1: (i) deleting components specific to TORC1 but not TORC2 renders cells hypersensitive to caffeine; (ii) rapamycin and caffeine display remarkably similar effects on global gene expression; and (iii) mutations were isolated in Tor1p, a component specific to TORC1, that confers significant caffeine resistance both in vivo and in vitro. Strongest resistance requires two simultaneous mutations in TOR1, the first at either one of two highly conserved positions within the FRB (rapamycin binding) domain and a second at a highly conserved position within the ATP binding pocket of the kinase domain. Biochemical and genetic analyses of these mutant forms of Tor1p support a model wherein functional interactions between the FRB and kinase domains, as well as between the FRB domain and the TORC1 component Kog1p, regulate TOR activity as well as contribute to the mechanism of caffeine resistance."

Trypanosomes encounter diverse environments during their life cycle with different fatty acid requirements. The tsetse vector form requires synthesis of stearate (C18), whereas the bloodstream form needs myristate (C14). We find that trypanosome fatty acid synthesis is modular, with ELO1 converting C4 to C10, ELO2 extending C10 to C14, and ELO3 elongating C14 to C18.

In blood, ELO3 downregulation favors myristate synthesis, whereas low concentrations of exogenous fatty acids in cultured parasites cause upregulation of the entire pathway, allowing the parasite to adapt to different environments. Trypanosoma brucei, the sleeping sickness parasite, divides its life cycle between the tsetse fly vector and the mammalian host. The bloodstream form (BSF) evades the host's immune response by switching surface coats composed of 107 variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) molecules (Donelson, 2003Donelson J.E. Antigenic variation and the African trypanosome genome.Acta Trop. 2003; 85: 391-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Each VSG is tethered to the plasma membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor whose fatty acids (FAs) are exclusively myristate (tetradecanoate), a 14-carbon saturated FA (Ferguson and Cross, 1984Ferguson M.A. Cross G.A.

Myristate, via myristoyl-CoA, is incorporated into the GPI precursor in a microsomal FA remodeling reaction that replaces other long chain FAs with myristate (Masterson et al., 1990Masterson W.J. Raper J. Doering T.L. Hart G.W. Englund P.T.

In contrast, tsetse fly procyclic forms (PCFs) do not myristoylate the GPI anchors of their surface glycoproteins (Field et al., 1991Field M.C. Menon A.K. Cross G.A. A glycosylphosphatidylinositol protein anchor from procyclic stage Trypanosoma brucei: lipid structure and biosynthesis.EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2731-2739Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). BSF trypanosomes need massive quantities of myristate for their GPI anchors. It was long believed that they were unable to synthesize FAs de novo (Dixon et al., 1971Dixon H. Ginger C.D. Williamson J. The lipid metabolism of blood and culture forms of Trypanosoma lewisi and Trypanosoma rhodesiense.Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 1971; 39: 247-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and that they acquired all FAs, including myristate, from the host blood. Although trypanosomes salvage myristate efficiently (Doering et al., 1993Doering T.L. Pessin M.S. Hoff E.F. Hart G.W. Raben D.M. Englund P.T. Trypanosome metabolism of myristate, the fatty acid required for the variant surface glycoprotein membrane anchor.J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9215-9222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the myristate concentration in blood is hardly adequate to support GPI myristoylation at high parasite densities (Paul et al., 2001Paul K.S.

Fatty acid synthesis in African trypanosomes: a solution to the myristate mystery.Trends Parasitol. 2001; 17: 381-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Several years ago we questioned whether trypanosomes synthesize FAs and discovered that indeed they do (Morita et al., 2000Morita Y.S. Paul K.S. Englund P.T. Specialized fatty acid synthesis in African trypanosomes: myristate for GPI anchors.Science. 2000; 288: 140-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We developed a cell-free system for FA synthesis containing trypanosome membranes (a source of enzymes), butyryl-CoA (the four-carbon primer; acetyl-CoA does not prime), malonyl-CoA (the two-carbon donor), and NADPH. The end product with BSF membranes is predominantly myristate, which can be used for GPI anchors. In contrast, the longest end product in PCFs is stearate (octadecanoate; C18). In other cell types, FAs are made by a type I or type II FA synthase (Smith, 1994Smith S. The animal fatty acid synthase: one gene, one polypeptide, seven enzymes.FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1248-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, White et al., 2005White S.W. Zheng J. Zhang Y.M. Rock C.O. The structural biology of type II fatty acid biosynthesis.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 791-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). Type I enzymes, found in the cytosol of mammals and fungi, have multiple catalytic activities residing on separate domains of one or two large polypeptides (Smith, 1994Smith S. The animal fatty acid synthase: one gene, one polypeptide, seven enzymes.FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1248-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). An exception is found in Musca domestica and Blattella germanica. In addition to a cytosolic type I FA synthase, both insects utilize a type I FA synthase that is a microsomal peripheral membrane protein in the integument to produce methyl-branched FAs (Juarez et al., 1992Juarez P. Chase J. Blomquist G.J.

Characterization of a novel microsomal fatty acid synthetase (FAS) compared to a cytosolic FAS in the housefly, Musca domestica.Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 118: 447-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Type II FA synthases, also soluble and found in bacteria, plants, and in eukaryotic organelles of prokaryotic origin, have similar catalytic activities, but each is on a separate polypeptide (White et al., 2005White S.W. Zheng J. Zhang Y.M. Rock C.O. The structural biology of type II fatty acid biosynthesis.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 791-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar, Zhang et al., 2005Zhang L. Joshi A.K. Hofmann J. Schweizer E. Smith S. Cloning, expression, and characterization of the human mitochondrial beta-ketoacyl synthase. Complementation of the yeast CEM1 knock-out strain.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12422-12429Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In both systems the growing chain is esterified to acyl-carrier protein (ACP) or an ACP-like domain. So which system makes FAs in T. brucei? The T. brucei genome does not encode a type I FA synthase, but does predict a type II system (Paul et al., 2001Paul K.S. Jiang D. Morita Y.S. Englund P.T. Fatty acid synthesis in African trypanosomes: a solution to the myristate mystery.Trends Parasitol. 2001; 17: 381-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Thus, we naturally assumed that the synthase was type II. However, several observations taken together suggested the type II pathway is not responsible for trypanosome bulk FA synthesis. First, typical type II systems are composed of soluble proteins, yet the trypanosome activity is membrane-associated. Second, type II enzymes and ACP localize to the trypanosome's single mitochondrion (J.S., unpublished data), but the myristate product is needed in the ER where GPI remodeling occurs. Third, triclosan, a type II enoyl-ACP reductase inhibitor, affects cell-free FA synthesis only at high concentrations, suggesting nonspecific inhibition (Paul et al., 2004Paul K.S. Bacchi C.J. Englund P.T. Multiple triclosan targets in Trypanosoma brucei.Eukaryot. Cell. 2004; 3: 855-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Fourth, cerulenin, which inhibits the β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase (KAS; both type I and type II), does not affect cell-free synthesis of intermediates up to C10, although it does inhibit extension beyond C10 (Morita et al., 2000Morita Y.S. Paul K.S. Englund P.T. Specialized fatty acid synthesis in African trypanosomes: myristate for GPI anchors.Science. 2000; 288: 140-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). This specificity of cerulenin could be explained by the existence of two KAS activities; however, the genome predicts only one. Finally, and most compellingly, RNA interference (RNAi) silencing of ACP, a key component of type II systems, has no effect on FA synthesis in the cell-free system (Figure 1A). For these and other reasons we concluded that the type II pathway is mitochondrial and that its products are produced at low levels. Therefore, bulk FA synthesis in trypanosomes must be unconventional, involving neither a type I nor a type II FA synthase. As an alternative we considered the possibility that a microsomal FA elongase system is involved. Elongase systems in all known cell types extend the products of type I FA synthase (myristate in yeast and palmitate [hexadecanoate; C16] in mammals) to longer-chain FAs (Moon et al., 2001Moon Y.A.

The chemistry of the elongase reactions (diagrammed in Figure 2) resembles that of type I and type II systems, except the growing acyl chain is esterified to CoA instead of ACP. The ELOs condense malonyl-CoA with the growing acyl chain, extending it by two carbon atoms (Figure 2, step 1). The resulting β-ketoacyl-CoA is then reduced (β-ketoacyl-CoA reductase, step 2), dehydrated (β-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrase, step 3), and reduced again (trans-2-enoyl-CoA reductase, step 4), producing a longer, saturated acyl-CoA (Leonard et al., 2004Leonard A.E. Pereira S.L. Sprecher H. Huang Y.S. Elongation of long-chain fatty acids.Prog. Lipid Res. 2004; 43: 36-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). The two reduction steps require NADPH. We now describe the trypanosome's unusual biochemical machinery involving FA elongases for bulk FA synthesis. T. brucei has four candidate ELO genes. ELO1–3 are in tandem on chromosome seven (NCBI AAX70671, AAX70672, and AAX70673) while ELO4 is on chromosome five (with allelic variants AAX69821 and AAX70768). Like S. cerevisiae ELOs, the trypanosome ELOs have multiple predicted transmembrane domains and an HXXHH amino acid motif (Oh et al., 1997Oh C.S. Toke D.A. Mandala S. Martin C.E. ELO2 and ELO3, homologues of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ELO1 gene, function in fatty acid elongation and are required for sphingolipid formation.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17376-17384Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). We used RNAi to silence ELO1 in PCF trypanosomes and then assayed membrane isolates for FA synthesis. In contrast to the effect of ACP RNAi, ELO1 knockdown drastically reduced FA synthesis (Figure 1B). RNAi also provided preliminary evidence that other ELOs act on longer acyl chains (Figure 1C). These studies indicated that the ELO pathway is involved in cell-free FA synthesis. To confirm the predicted intracellular localization of one of the enzymes in this pathway, we expressed ELO3 tagged with a C-terminal GFP; fluorescence microscopy showed that it colocalized with ER Tracker predominantly in the perinuclear region (Figure 1D), similar to the localization of the yeast ELO pathway (Kohlwein et al., 2001Kohlwein S.D. Eder S. Oh C.S. Martin C.E. Gable K. Bacikova D. Dunn T. Tsc13p is required for fatty acid elongation and localizes to a novel structure at the nuclear-vacuolar interface in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 109-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). To evaluate more rigorously the role of each ELO in FA synthesis, we made knockout strains for each of the four ELO genes (Δelo) in BSF trypanosomes. Figure 3 shows Southern blots confirming the knockout of each gene. We assayed membranes from wild-type and knockout strains in the cell-free FA synthesis system (Morita et al., 2000Morita Y.S. Paul K.S. Englund P.T. Specialized fatty acid synthesis in African trypanosomes: myristate for GPI anchors.Science. 2000; 288: 140-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) using acyl-CoA primers of varying chain length. We detected and quantitated the products by thin layer chromatography (TLC) and phosphorimaging (Figure 4A), and we determined the product chain lengths by reverse-phase TLC of their methyl esters (Figure 5A). These data (presented below) show that ELO1 mainly extends C4 to C10, ELO2 extends C10 to C14, and ELO3 extends C14 to C18. Furthermore, the ELO specificities are overlapping. For example, ELO2, which prefers C10- and C12-CoA primers, also has low activity with C8- and C14-CoA.Figure 4Fatty Acid Synthesis by BSF Δelo1–4 Membranes from Various acyl-CoA PrimersShow full caption(A) The segment of the TLC plate with free FAs is shown (1.8 × 107 cell equivalents/lane).

Using wild-type membranes, we found robust synthesis with primer lengths from four to 12 carbons, though utilization of C4- and C12-CoA primers was about half as efficient as that of the intermediate primers (Figure 4A). Wild-type membranes showed relatively low extension of C14- and C16-CoA, as expected, because BSFs mainly synthesize C14 (Morita et al., 2000Morita Y.S. Paul K.S. Englund P.T. Specialized fatty acid synthesis in African trypanosomes: myristate for GPI anchors.Science. 2000; 288: 140-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Chain-length analysis of the FA products from these wild-type reactions revealed that C4-CoA is elongated efficiently, mostly to C14, with little accumulation of intermediates (Figure 5A). In contrast, elongation of C6- and C8-CoA appeared less processive, with more accumulation of intermediates. Argentation TLC, a procedure that fractionates FAs by degree of unsaturation, revealed small amounts of unsaturated FAs (Figure 5B); these are likely due to the activity of desaturases on the products of the ELO pathway. In Δelo1 membranes, synthesis from primers ranging from C4- to C12-CoA was almost completely lost, whereas synthesis from C14- and C16-CoA was less affected (Figure 4A). Despite these observations, other evidence indicates that ELO1 is mainly involved in synthesis up to C10. As shown in Figures 4A and 5A, BSF Δelo2 membranes efficiently utilize primers up to C8 (forming C10), an activity that must be due to ELO1. Furthermore, cerulenin does not affect synthesis in the cell-free system up to C10, but blocks further elongation (Morita et al., 2000Morita Y.S. Paul K.S. Englund P.T. Specialized fatty acid synthesis in African trypanosomes: myristate for GPI anchors.Science. 2000; 288: 140-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), suggesting that it inhibits ELO2, but not ELO1. We do not know the reason why BSF Δelo1 is defective in ELO2 activity; perhaps ELO1 protein is required for downstream ELO activity in vitro. We used the same approach to study the specificities of ELO2–4. Membranes from Δelo2 were mainly deficient in extending C10- and C12-CoA primers (Figure 4A). As mentioned, chain-length analysis of these products showed that Δelo2 stops FA synthesis at C10 with shorter primers (Figure 5A). The minor chain elongation of C10- and C12-CoA in Δelo2 membranes is likely due to overlapping ELO1 and ELO3 activities. Similarly, Δelo3 membranes appeared deficient in extending C14- and C16-CoA and chain elongation of shorter primers stopped at C14 (Figures 4A and 5A). The chain-length specificity of ELO3 was confirmed using PCF ELO3 RNAi membranes (Figure 1C). Residual elongation of C14-CoA in Δelo3 membranes is likely due to overlapping ELO2 activity. Substrate preferences for ELO1–3 are summarized in Figure 5C. Taken together, these data indicate that ELO1–3 account for virtually all of the FA synthesis observed in the cell-free system. Using primers up to C16-CoA, the products of Δelo4 membranes resembled those of wild-type, indicating ELO4 is not involved in FA synthesis up to C18 (Figures 4A and 5A). However, ELO4 elongates the unsaturated long chain FA arachidonate (C20:4 or 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoate). Although wild-type membranes efficiently elongated arachidonoyl-CoA (Figure 4B) and chain-length analysis revealed a single radiolabeled product that coeluted with C22:4 (S.H.L., unpublished data), Δelo4 membranes were inactive in this reaction. We next tested whether the ELO pathway is responsible for FA synthesis in cultured T. brucei. We identified a single gene for enoyl-CoA reductase (EnCR; NCBI AAX80213) on chromosome three by homology to that from S. cerevisiae, where it functions downstream of all three yeast ELOs (Kohlwein et al., 2001Kohlwein S.D. Eder S. Oh C.S. Martin C.E. Gable K. Bacikova D. Dunn T. Tsc13p is required for fatty acid elongation and localizes to a novel structure at the nuclear-vacuolar interface in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 109-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). We found EnCR RNAi cells defective for growth in both low-lipid (Figure 6A) and, to a lesser extent, normal media (S.H.L., unpublished data), indicating that the ELO pathway is essential in PCF trypanosomes. The growth defect was reversed by stearate addition (Figure 6A). This rescue, signifying that inadequate stearate is produced in the RNAi cells, demonstrates that the ELO pathway is involved in stearate synthesis in cultured T. brucei. We then assayed RNAi membranes for cell-free FA synthesis and found 77%, 63%, and 54% reduced activity, compared to uninduced control, using C4-, C10-, and C14-CoA primers, respectively (Figure 6B). As with many other trypanosome genes, EnCR RNAi was incomplete. Based on the RNAi phenotype, it is likely, as in yeast, that ELO1–3 share a single EnCR. Finally, we measured the effect of EnCR RNAi on FA synthesis in cultured parasites. Since trypanosomes do not take up [14C]acetate (Morita et al., 2000Morita Y.S. Paul K.S. Englund P.T. Specialized fatty acid synthesis in African trypanosomes: myristate for GPI anchors.Science. 2000; 288: 140-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), an FA precursor, we radiolabeled them with [14C]threonine, which is catabolized to glycine and acetyl-CoA (van Weelden et al., 2005van Weelden S.W. van Hellemond J.J. Opperdoes F.R. Tielens A.G. New functions for parts of the Krebs cycle in procyclic Trypanosoma brucei, a cycle not operating as a cycle.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12451-12460Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The latter compound is incorporated into FAs following conversion to malonyl-CoA (Klein and Linstead, 1976Klein R.A. Linstead D.J. Threonine as a preferred source of 2-carbon units for lipid synthesis in Trypanosoma brucei.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1976; 4: 48-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, van Weelden et al., 2005van Weelden S.W. van Hellemond J.J. Opperdoes F.R. Tielens A.G. New functions for parts of the Krebs cycle in procyclic Trypanosoma brucei, a cycle not operating as a cycle.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12451-12460Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We detected all FA synthesis intermediates between C8 and C18 (C6 methyl ester is lost during the hexane extraction), which indicates that the whole pathway is active in the parasite (Figure 6C). Because [14C]threonine labeling of FAs from C8 to C18 is reduced by 48% in normal and 68% in low-lipid medium by EnCR RNAi (Figure 6C, lanes 1 and 2 or 3 and 4), and because RNAi was likely incomplete, the ELO pathway must be responsible at least for the majority of FA synthesis in cultured T. brucei. It appears that the T. brucei ELO pathway is regulated. Comparison of lanes 1 and 3 in Figure 6C (both uninduced for RNAi) shows that PCF FA synthesis is increased 98% following growth in low-lipid medium, indicating that the entire ELO pathway is upregulated in a low-lipid environment. In a control experiment, we found that [14C]threonine was taken up at a 38% lower rate (average of three time points up to 4.5 hr) by cells grown in low-lipid medium than by those grown in normal medium. Therefore, the higher rate of incorporation of 14C into FAs in low-lipid medium is not due to higher uptake of the [14C]threonine precursor. The genomes of related disease-causing trypanosomatids Leishmania major and Trypanosoma cruzi also encode ELO systems. Indeed, like T. brucei, their membranes efficiently synthesize FAs from butyryl-CoA but not acetyl-CoA (Figure 7). Although in vitro synthesis activity was more robust in T. cruzi than in L. major, FA synthesis products ranging from C8 to C18 were observed in both systems. African trypanosomes use an unprecedented mechanism to synthesize FAs. All other cell types, whether prokaryotic or eukaryotic, utilize conventional type I or type II FA synthases. T. brucei is the first example of a cell that has adapted microsomal elongases for bulk FA synthesis. We have also presented evidence that two related parasites, L. major and T. cruzi, utilize elongases for FA synthesis. Whereas the T. brucei genome encodes four ELOs, L. major and T. cruzi genomes encode 13 and five, respectively. As with T. brucei, the genomes of these related parasites also encode a type II FA synthase, but not a type I. We have found in T. brucei that components of the type II system localize to the mitochondrial matrix (K.P. and J.S., unpublished data), and the same is likely true for L. major and T. cruzi. We also have found that FA products of the trypanosome mitochondrial system are produced at a very low level (J.S., unpublished data). Therefore, nearly all of the FAs synthesized in T. brucei are produced by the elongase pathway. Why do these parasites utilize the elongase pathway for FA synthesis? One obvious advantage is that synthesis is near the site of product utilization. Phospholipid synthesis in the ER membrane can utilize FAs made nearby. Also, GPI myristoylation, which occurs in the ER of BSF trypanosomes, can employ myristate, a major product of the ELO pathway. Another advantage is that the stepwise synthesis of FAs to C10, C14, and finally to C18 allows convenient switching of the products of the pathway. The obvious example is in BSF T. brucei where selective downregulation of ELO3 (see below) results in synthesis of myristate. We speculate that some of the 13 ELOs in L. major are specialized for synthesis of the long-chain fatty acyl groups and synthesis of the carbon chains of the alkyl groups needed for both glycoinositolphospholipids and the GPI anchors of promastigote surface protease and lipophosphoglycan (Ferguson, 1997Ferguson M.A. The surface glycoconjugates of trypanosomatid parasites.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1997; 352: 1295-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The versatility of the ELO pathway is enhanced by the fact that it can be regulated to suit the parasite's needs. We found in PCFs that the entire pathway is upregulated when the cells are cultured in low-lipid medium (Figure 6C). There are also previously published observations that can now be explained in terms of regulation of the ELO pathway. These include the facts that the rate of FA synthesis in PCFs, as measured in the cell-free system, is 5.3-fold higher than in BSFs, indicating upregulation of the pathway in PCFs (Morita et al., 2000Morita Y.S. Paul K.S. Englund P.T. Specialized fatty acid synthesis in African trypanosomes: myristate for GPI anchors.Science. 2000; 288: 140-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Also, the different FA products produced in BSFs and PCFs can be explained by selective up- or downregulation of ELO3 (Morita et al., 2000Morita Y.S. Paul K.S. Englund P.T. Specialized fatty acid synthesis in African trypanosomes: myristate for GPI anchors.Science. 2000; 288: 140-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Another example comes from our previous report that BSFs grown in medium containing 5% serum efficiently elongate exogenous [3H]myristate to palmitate and stearate, whereas trypanosomes in whole blood do not (Doering et al., 1993Doering T.L. Pessin M.S. Hoff E.F. Hart G.W. Raben D.M. Englund P.T. Trypanosome metabolism of myristate, the fatty acid required for the variant surface glycoprotein membrane anchor.J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9215-9222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whole blood has 20 times more palmitate and stearate than media with 5% serum. Therefore, BSF ELO3 must be downregulated during culture in whole blood and upregulated during growth in FA-depleted medium. These findings indicate that trypanosomes regulate FA synthesis by the ELO pathway in response to environmental FAs. We do not yet know the molecular mechanisms by which they sense the level of exogenous FAs and possibly even distinguish among exogenous FAs that differ in chain length. We also do not know the mechanism of regulation of the pathway; in S. cerevisiae the level of ELO mRNA depends on the concentration of exogenous FAs (Toke and Martin, 1996Toke D.A. Martin C.E. Isolation and characterization of a gene affecting fatty acid elongation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18413-18422Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Thus, the elongase pathway is ideally suited for parasites that migrate between vector and host and from one compartment to another within the vector or host. Depending upon the needs of a life-cycle stage and the availability of exogenous FAs, the ELO pathway can readily adapt to produce different products at the appropriate concentration. For example, we speculate that when BSFs invade the cerebrospinal fluid, where the ratio of total lipids to that in serum is ∼0.003 (Lentner, 1981Lentner C. Geigy Scientific Tables: Units of Measurement, Body Fluids, Composition of the Body, Nutrition, Volume One, Eighth Edition. Ciba Geigy Ltd., Switzerland1981Google Scholar), the ELO pathway would be upregulated to produce not only myristate for GPI anchors, but also longer FAs for phospholipids. There are still unanswered questions concerning the ELO pathway. One critical question is whether the pathway is essential for growth of BSFs and therefore a candidate drug target. ELOs are clearly essential for PCF trypanosomes. RNAi silencing of EnCR, an enzyme in the ELO pathway, causes growth arrest, but normal growth is restored when the culture is supplemented with stearate. In the case of BSFs, ELO knockout lines grew normally in culture and were competent for infection in rats, suggesting that the pathway may not be required for growth in lipid-rich environments. However, it is possible that ELO specificities overlap sufficiently to compensate for knockout of a single ELO; another possibility is that the pathway is essential only in lipid-poor environments. Although we know the origin of most of the substrates for the ELO pathway, the source of the butyryl-CoA primer is not yet known. The malonyl-CoA is formed by an acetyl-CoA carboxylase, probably in the cytosol, and NADPH can be produced either by oxidation of malate to pyruvate by a cytosolic malic enzyme (van Weelden et al., 2005van Weelden S.W. van Hellemond J.J. Opperdoes F.R. Tielens A.G. New functions for parts of the Krebs cycle in procyclic Trypanosoma brucei, a cycle not operating as a cycle.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12451-12460Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) or by the pentose phosphate shunt, which may be localized in both the cytosol and the glycosomes (Duffieux et al., 2000Duffieux F. Van Roy J. Michels P.A. Opperdoes F.R. Molecular characterization of the first two enzymes of the pentose-phosphate pathway of Trypanosoma brucei. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconolactonase.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27559-27565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). It is important to note that the ELO3 component of the pathway can act as a conventional ELO system, elongating exogenously supplied myristate to palmitate and stearate (Doering et al., 1993Doering T.L. Pessin M.S. Hoff E.F. Hart G.W. Raben D.M. Englund P.T. Trypanosome metabolism of myristate, the fatty acid required for the variant surface glycoprotein membrane anchor.J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9215-9222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, ELO4 acts as a conventional polyunsaturated FA elongase in that it elongates arachidonoyl-CoA (C20:4) to C22:4. It is striking that cell-free FA synthesis utilizing wild-type BSF membranes and a butyryl-CoA primer appears processive. Under these conditions, there are only low concentrations of intermediates detected, and the major product is C14 (Figure 5A, second panel). It is possible that when the entire pathway is operational, starting with butyryl-CoA, growing acyl-CoAs are channeled, with no release of intermediates. In contrast, use of C6- and C8-CoA primers (Figure 5A, third and fourth panels), results in nonprocessive synthesis of C14, with detection of all intermediates. The mechanistic explanation for these differences is not known, but a similar situation occurs in yeast (Dittrich et al., 1998Dittrich F. Zajonc D. Huhne K. Hoja U. Ekici A. Greiner E. Klein H. Hofmann J. Bessoule J.J. Sperling P. Schweizer E. Fatty acid elongation in yeast–biochemical characteristics of the enzyme system and isolation of elongation-defective mutants.Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 252: 477-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Substrate channeling might not only increase the efficiency of FA synthesis, but it also could impact GPI myristoylation. We found previously that the GPI remodeling enzymes in vitro can utilize FAs shorter than myristate; among shorter acyl chains, lauroyl-CoA and octanoyl-CoA are the preferred substrates (Morita and Englund, 2001Morita Y.S. Englund P.T. Fatty acid remodeling of glycosyl phosphatidylinositol anchors in Trypanosoma brucei: incorporation of fatty acids other than myristate.Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 115: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Myristate specificity in remodeling was previously assumed to be due to the lack of other available short-chain fatty acyl-CoAs. However, we now know that these other substrates (octanoyl-CoA to lauroyl-CoA) are present in the cell as intermediates in the FA synthesis pathway. Substrate channeling through the ELO pathway could prevent their incorporation into GPIs. T. brucei and its trypanosomatid kin are unique among eukaryotes in that they synthesize FAs with a microsomal elongase pathway that is distinct from conventional type I and II synthases. This mechanism is a third type of FA synthesis. It is likely that the parasite's need for rapid adaptation to diverse host environments had a hand in the evolution of this piecemeal FA synthesis pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2014462486,"Oxidation products of unsaturated fatty acids, collectively known as oxylipins, function as signaling molecules in plants during development, wounding, and insect and pathogen attack. Certain oxylipins are also known to have direct cytotoxic effects on pathogens. We used inducible expression of bacterial avirulence proteins in planta to study the involvement of oxylipins in race-specific defense against bacterial pathogens. We demonstrate that recognition of the Pseudomonas syringae avirulence protein AvrRpm1 induces 9- and 13-lipoxygenase-dependent oxylipin synthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana. The major oxylipins accumulated were jasmonic acid, 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid, and dinor-oxo-phytodienoic acid. The majority of the newly formed oxylipins (>90%) was found to be esterified to glycerolipids, whereby 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid and dinor-oxo-phytodienoic acid were found to be esterified to a novel galactolipid. The structure of the substance was determined as a monogalactosyldiacylglycerol containing two 12-oxo-phytodienoic acids and one dinor-oxo-phytodienoic acid acyl chain and was given the trivial name arabidopside E. This substance accumulated to surprisingly high levels, 7-8% of total lipid content, and was shown to inhibit growth of a bacterial pathogen in vitro. Arabidopside E was formed also after recognition of the avirulence protein AvrRpt2, suggesting that this could be a conserved feature of defense reactions against bacterial pathogens. In conclusion, the data presented suggest a role of enzymatically formed oxylipins, especially the octadecanoids and arabidopside E in race-specific resistance against bacterial pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2035828746,"As a key cellular regulatory protein p53 is subject to tight regulation by several E3 ligases. Here, we demonstrate the role of HECT domain E3 ligase, WWP1, in regulating p53 localization and activity. WWP1 associates with p53 and induces p53 ubiquitylation. Unlike other E3 ligases, WWP1 increases p53 stability; inhibition of WWP1 expression or expression of a ligase-mutant form results in decreased p53 expression. WWP1-mediated stabilization of p53 is associated with increased accumulation of p53 in cytoplasm with a concomitant decrease in its transcriptional activities. WWP1 effects are independent of Mdm2 as they are seen in cells lacking Mdm2 expression. Whereas WWP1 limits p53 activity, p53 reduces expression of WWP1, pointing to a possible feedback loop mechanism. Taken together, these findings identify the first instance of a ubiquitin ligase that causes stabilization of p53 while inactivating its transcriptional activities."
https://openalex.org/W2121053020,"The mitochondrial RNA binding proteins MRP1 and MRP2 form a heteromeric complex that functions in kinetoplastid RNA editing. In this process, MRP1/MRP2 serves as a matchmaker by binding to guide RNAs and facilitating their hybridization with cognate preedited mRNAs. To understand the mechanism by which this complex performs RNA matchmaking, we determined structures of Trypanosoma brucei apoMRP1/MRP2 and an MRP1/MRP2-gRNA complex. The structures show that MRP1/MRP2 is a heterotetramer and, despite little sequence homology, each MRP subunit exhibits the same “Whirly” transcription-factor fold. The gRNA molecule binds to the highly basic β sheet surface of the MRP complex via nonspecific, electrostatic contacts. Strikingly, while the gRNA stem/loop II base is anchored to the basic surface, stem/loop I (the anchor sequence) is unfolded and its bases exposed to solvent. Thus, MRP1/MRP2 acts as an RNA matchmaker by stabilizing the RNA molecule in an unfolded conformation suitable for RNA-RNA hybridization."
https://openalex.org/W2003607337,"Double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR), a ubiquitously expressed serine/threonine kinase, has been implicated in the regulation or modulation of cell growth through multiple signaling pathways, but how PKR regulates tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced signaling pathways is poorly understood. In the present study, we used fibroblasts derived from PKR gene-deleted mice to investigate the role of PKR in TNF-induced activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and growth modulation. We found that in wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF), TNF induced NF-κB activation as measured by DNA binding but deletion of PKR abolished this activation. This inhibition was associated with suppression of inhibitory subunit of NF-κB (IκB)α kinase (IKK) activation, IκBα phosphorylation and degradation, p65 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation, and NF-κB-dependent reporter gene transcription. TNF-induced Akt activation needed for IKK activation was also abolished by deletion of PKR. NF-κB activation was diminished in PKR-deleted cells transfected with TNF receptor (TNFR) 1, TNFR-associated death domain and TRAF2 plasmids; NF-κB activated by NF-κB-inducing kinase, IKK or p65, however, was minimally affected. Among the MAPKs, it was interesting that whereas TNF-induced c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation was abolished, activation of p44/p42 MAPK and p38 MAPK was potentiated in PKR-deleted cells. TNF induced the expression of NF-κB-regulated gene products cyclin D1, c-Myc, matrix metalloproteinase-9, survivin, X-linked inhibitor-of-apoptosis protein (IAP), IAP1, Bcl-xL, A1/Bfl-1 and Fas-associated death domain protein-like IL-1β-converting enzyme-inhibitory protein in wild-type MEF but not in PKR−/− cells. Similarly, TNF induced the proliferation of wild-type cells, but this proliferation was completely suppressed in PKR-deleted cells. Overall, our results indicate that PKR differentially regulates TNF signaling; IKK, Akt and JNK were positively regulated, whereas p44/p42 MAPK and p38 MAPK were negatively regulated."
https://openalex.org/W2033109447,"Abstract The RNA-binding protein CsrA (carbon storage regulator) of Escherichia coli is a global regulator of gene expression and is representative of the CsrA/RsmA family of bacterial proteins. These proteins act by regulating mRNA translation and stability and are antagonized by binding to small noncoding RNAs. Although the RNA target sequence and structure for CsrA binding have been well defined, little information exists concerning the protein requirements for RNA recognition. The three-dimensional structures of three CsrA/RsmA proteins were recently solved, revealing a novel protein fold consisting of two interdigitated monomers. Here, we performed comprehensive alanine-scanning mutagenesis on csrA of E. coli and tested the 58 resulting mutants for regulation of glycogen accumulation, motility, and biofilm formation. Quantitative effects of these mutations on expression of glgCA`-'lacZ, flhDC `-'lacZ, and pgaA`-'lacZ translational fusions were also examined, and eight of the mutant proteins were purified and tested for RNA binding. These studies identified two regions of the amino acid sequence that were critical for regulation and RNA binding, located within the first (β1, residues 2-7) and containing the last (β5, residues 40-47) β-strands of CsrA. The β1 and β5 strands of opposite monomers lie adjacent and parallel to each other in the three-dimensional structure of this protein. Given the symmetry of the CsrA dimer, these findings imply that two distinct RNA binding surfaces or functional subdomains lie on opposite sides of the protein."

https://openalex.org/W1971217281,"To evaluate the pathogenic potential of Bacillus anthracis-secreted proteases distinct from lethal toxin, two neutral zinc metalloproteases were purified to apparent homogeneity from the culture supernatant of a non-virulent delta Ames strain (pXO1–, pXO2–). The first (designated Npr599) is a thermolysin-like enzyme highly homologous to bacillolysins from other Bacillus species. The second (designated InhA) is a homolog of the Bacillus thuringiensis immune inhibitor A. These proteases belong to the M4 and M6 families, respectively. Both enzymes digested various substrates, including extracellular matrix proteins, endogenous inhibitors, and coagulation proteins, with some differences in specificity. In addition, InhA accelerated urokinase-mediated plasminogen activation, suggesting that InhA acts as a modulator of plasmin in the host inflammatory system. Relevant to epithelial barrier function, Npr599 and InhA significantly enhanced syndecan-1 shedding from cultured normal murine mammary gland cells without affecting their viability through stimulation of the host cell ectodomain shedding mechanism. In addition, Npr599 and InhA directly cleaved recombinant syndecan-1 fused to glutathione S-transferase. Mass spectrometric analysis suggested that the cleavage sites of Npr599 and InhA are the Asp39–Asp40 and Gly48–Thr49 bonds, respectively. We propose that Npr599 and InhA from B. anthracis are multifunctional pathogenic factors that may contribute to anthrax pathology through direct degradation of host tissues, increases in barrier permeability, and/or modulation of host defenses."

To understand this further, we determined the crystal structures of canine adenovirus serotype 2 (CAV-2) and the human adenovirus serotype 37 (HAd37) in complex with human CAR D1 at 2.3 and 1.5Å resolution, respectively. Structure comparison with the HAd12 fiber head-CAR D1 complex showed that the overall topology of the interaction is conserved but that the interfaces differ in number and identity of interacting residues, shape complementarity, and degree of conformational adaptation. Using surface plasmon resonance, we characterized the binding affinity to CAR D1 of wild type and mutant CAV-2 and HAd37 fiber heads. We found that CAV-2 has the highest affinity but fewest direct interactions, with the reverse being true for HAd37. Moreover, we found that conserved interactions can have a minor contribution, whereas serotype-specific interactions can be essential.

They have been isolated from a wide variety of vertebrates, including mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish (1Benko M. Harrach B. Curr. Top. Microbiol.

The ∼50 human Ad serotypes (HAd) (divided into species A-F) lead to serotype-specific respiratory, ocular, and enteric infections that are usually self-limiting diseases in immunocompetent individuals. However, Ad infections are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in newborns and immunosuppressed individuals (2Kojaoghlanian T. Flomenberg P. Horwitz M.S. Rev. Med. Virol. 2003; 13: 155-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Notably, bone marrow and solid organ transplant patients who have severe lymphocytopenia are at the highest risk for Ad-induced disease (3Chakrabarti S. Mautner V. Osman H. Collingham K.E. Fegan C.D.

In addition, there are no drugs currently available that efficiently prevent or treat infections from all HAd serotypes. The major adenovirus capsid protein is the trimeric hexon, 240 of which form the 20 facets of the icosahedron. The 12 vertices are composed of the penton complex, which comprises the pentameric penton base and the externally projecting trimeric fiber. The fiber has a shaft of variable length with a terminal globular knob or head domain. In most cell types in vitro, the fiber head and penton base mediate attachment and entry, respectively.

Based on similarities in overall capsid architecture and capsid protein structure, Adenoviridae probably share an ancient common ancestor with bacteriophages of the Tectiviridae family (17Abrescia N.G.

The initial stages of adenoviral infection, cellular attachment, and internalization have been described as a two-step mechanism. In the best characterized pathway, based on studies using HAd species C serotypes 2 and 5 (HAd2/5), the fiber head first binds to a primary receptor. In the second step, a conserved Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif in the penton base binds to integrins, triggering endocytosis (20Wickham T.J. Mathias P. Cheresh D.A. Nemerow G.R. Cell. 1993; 73: 309-319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1948) Google Scholar). Enteric HAds belonging to subgroup F and also canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2) do not possess an RGD motif in the penton base and may use alternative mechanisms to trigger cell entry (21Albinsson B.

The first primary Ad receptor identified was the immunoglobulin-like coxsackie and adenovirus receptor (CAR) (24Bergelson J.M. Cunningham J.A. Droguett G. Kurt-Jones E.A. Krithivas A. Hong J.S.

Bergelson J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15191-15196Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). A variety of representative viruses from human Ad species A and C-F and nonhuman Ads (e.g. CAV-2) have been shown to use CAR as a primary receptor (22Soudais C. Boutin S. Hong S.S. Chillon M.

In lung epithelial cells, CAR is located predominantly on the basolateral side of the cells, where it plays a role in cell-cell adhesion, probably via dimerization of the D1 domain (CAR D1) (26Cohen C.J. Shieh J.T. Pickles R.J. Okegawa T. Hsieh J.T. Bergelson J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15191-15196Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar, 28Honda T. Saitoh H. Masuko M.

Cell Res. 2006; 312: 1566-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the HAd12 fiber head in complex with human CAR D1 revealed the binding site at the interface of HAd12 fiber head monomers and highlighted the AB loop as a critical region involved in CAR binding (13Bewley M.C. Springer K. Zhang Y.B. Freimuth P. Flanagan J.M. Science. 1999; 286: 1579-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). The HAd12 fiber head-CAR D1 binding site overlaps with the CAR D1 dimerization site (30van Raaij M.J. Chouin E. van der Zandt H. Bergelson J.M. Cusack S. Struct. Fold Des. 2000; 8: 1147-1155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The fact that the HAd2 fiber head-CAR D1 affinity is 1000-fold higher than the affinity between CAR D1 monomers supports the finding that excess fiber produced during replication disrupts tight junctions by binding to CAR D1, thus promoting the spread of progeny virus (31Walters R.W. Freimuth P. Moninger T.O. Ganske I. Zabner J. Welsh M.J. Cell. 2002; 110: 789-799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Most species B (e.g. HAd3) and some species D viruses (e.g. HAd37) do not use CAR as a primary receptor in vivo but attach to CD46 (or MCP (membrane cofactor protein), a regulator of complement activation), sialic acids, and/or other primary receptors (12Burmeister W.P.

Crystal structures of HAd3 (11Durmort C. Stehlin C. Schoehn G. Mitraki A. Drouet E. Cusack S. Burmeister W.P. Virology. 2001; 285: 302-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and HAd41 short fiber (10Seiradake E. Cusack S. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 14088-14094Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) show that the reason for the inability to bind CAR is different in each case. For HAd3, there are incompatible charged residues in the AB loop, although the main-chain conformation of the loop is otherwise suitable, whereas for HAd41 short fiber, the AB loop has an altered conformation inconsistent with CAR binding (10Seiradake E. Cusack S. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 14088-14094Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, HAd37 virions and recombinant fiber heads bind to CAR in an overlay blot assay, although the virus does not use CAR as a receptor (37Wu E. Fernandez J. Fleck S.K. Von Seggern D.J. Huang S. Nemerow G.R. Virology. 2001; 279: 78-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This may be because the HAd37 fiber shaft is too short and rigid to allow efficient binding to cellular CAR when the fiber is attached to the virus (38Wu E. Pache L. Von Seggern D.J. Mullen T.M. Mikyas Y. Stewart P.L. Nemerow G.R. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 7225-7235Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Other studies also confirm that the length and flexibility of the fiber shaft is critical in infectivity (39Shayakhmetov D.M. Lieber A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 10274-10286Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In addition to their importance as human pathogens, Ads are promising tools for the development of gene transfer vectors. Because Ad-induced morbidity is relatively species-specific, we and others hypothesized that vectors derived from nonhuman Adenoviridae would be more clinically useful than those derived from human serotypes, based, in part, on the potential lack of ubiquitous memory immunity (cellular and humoral) found in humans (40Both G.W. Curiel D. Douglas J. Adenoviral Vectors for Gene Therapy. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego2002: 447-479Google Scholar, 41Paillard F. Hum.

FASEB J. 2004; 18: 391-393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), one of the >50 nonhuman Adenoviridae currently identified. We showed that in the central nervous system of several species (including ex vivo human tissue), CAV-2 vectors preferentially transduce neurons and lead to an efficient level of axoplasmic transport (45Soudais C. Laplace-Builhe C. Kissa K. Kremer E.J. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2283-2285Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Helper-dependent CAV-2 vectors (i.e. constructs that contain the Ad inverted terminal repeats, packaging domain, and an exogenous expression cassette but are otherwise devoid of all other viral coding sequences (reviewed in Ref. 47Amalfitano A. Parks R.J. Curr. Gene Ther. 2002; 2: 111-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar)) lead to long term transgene expression in the central nervous system (46Soudais C. Skander N. Kremer E.J. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 391-393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and respiratory tract (48Keriel A. René C. Galer C. Zabner J. Kremer E.J. J. Virol. 2005; 80: 1487-1496Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar) of immunocompetent rodents without immunosuppression. These data and those from studies using helper-dependent HAd vectors (47Amalfitano A. Parks R.J. Curr. Gene Ther. 2002; 2: 111-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) suggest that helper-dependent CAV-2 vectors could be used for the long term treatment of some global neurodegenerative disorders (49Kremer E.J.

To gain further insight into the plasticity of the CAR-fiber head interaction and more generally to improve understanding of adenovirus tropism and vector design, we determined two new crystal structures, those of CAV-2 and HAd37 fiber head in complex with human CAR D1. The structures were solved to 2.3 and 1.5 Å resolution, respectively, significantly better than previous fiber head CAR complex structures. We also determined the structure of the CAV-2 fiber head alone at 1.5 Å resolution, which, together with the known structure of unliganded HAd37 fiber head (12Burmeister W.P. Guilligay D. Cusack S. Wadell G. Arnberg N. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 7727-7736Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), allows assessment of eventual conformational changes upon complex formation. Based on the structures, we analyzed the CAR-binding properties of wild type and mutant HAd37 and CAV-2 fiber heads using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Together with existing structural information on the HAd12 fiber head in complex with human CAR D1, we present a more complete understanding of the Ad fiber head interaction with CAR D1. Plasmids and Cloning—Two vectors derived from pAB3 were kindly provided by Mark van Raaij (Universidad de Santiago), both containing the gene coding for residues 15-140 of human CAR D1, one without any tag (pAB3.CAR15-140) and the other with a noncleavable C-terminal His tag (pAB3.CAR15-140H) (30van Raaij M.J.

Delphine Guilligay (EMBL Grenoble Outstation) generously provided a vector derived from pPROEX HTb (Invitrogen) containing a construct of the HAd37 fiber head (residues 177-365), an N-terminal His6 tag, and a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage site (12Burmeister W.P. Guilligay D. Cusack S. Wadell G. Arnberg N. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 7727-7736Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). A fragment coding for CAV-2 fiber head residues 358-542 was generated by PCR using CAV-2 genomic DNA as template and cloned into a pQE vector (Qiagen) containing a noncleavable N-terminal His6 tag. The same fragment was cloned into pPROEX HTb, a vector containing an N-terminal His6 tag and a TEV protease cleavage site. For crystallization, only the CAV-2 fiber head containing the noncleavable His tag was used. All binding assays using SPR were performed exclusively with the second CAV-2 construct (wild type and mutants), after removal of the tag. To simplify the description of the methods, both constructs will be referred to as “CAV-2 fiber head.” For CAR D1, only the untagged construct was used for crystallization, and only the His-tagged construct was used for SPR assays. The point mutants for SPR assays were created using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit as suggested by the manufacturer (Stratagene). Expression and Purification of Proteins—Fiber head constructs in pPROEX HTb were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 Star (DE3) (Invitrogen). The CAV-2 fiber head in pQE was expressed in E. coli strain M15 (Qiagen). All proteins were expressed at 37 °C and in the soluble fraction. Cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, Boehringer Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture) and lysed by sonication. The cell lysate was centrifuged for 30 min at 25,000 × g, and the supernatant was loaded on an Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen). Protein bound to the resin was washed with wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 50 mm imidazole) and eluted with elution buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 500 mm imidazole). To separate the His tag from constructs containing a TEV protease cleavage site, proteins were incubated overnight with 1:100 His-tagged TEV protease at 10 °C. Imidazole was removed by dialysis against lysis buffer. Uncleaved protein and TEV protease were removed by binding to a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin. Fiber head protein was concentrated to about 5 mg/ml and either used for complex formation with CAR D1 or loaded onto a Superdex200 column (Amersham Biosciences) for further purification and changing of the buffer to 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). The preparation of periplasmic extract containing His-tagged or untagged CAR D1 was performed as described (30van Raaij M.J. Chouin E. van der Zandt H. Bergelson J.M. Cusack S. Struct. Fold Des. 2000; 8: 1147-1155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Briefly, CAR D1 with or without His tag was expressed in E. coli strain XL1 blue (Stratagene) at 25 °C. The cell pellet was washed with phosphate-buffered saline (8 g/liter NaCl, 0.2 g/liter KCl, 1.44 g/liter Na2HPO4, 0.24 g/liter KH2PO4 (pH 7.4)) and then with (200 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 m sucrose) and finally incubated for 20 min in 150 ml of distilled water to release the periplasmic fraction. Boehringer Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture was added. For the purification of untagged CAR D1, NaH2PO4, Na2HPO4, and NH4SO4 were added up to the final concentrations of 25 mm, 25 mm, and 1.5 m, respectively. After centrifugation, the supernatant was loaded onto a 75-ml phenyl-Sepharose FF high sub (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with a linear gradient of 1.5-0.0 m NH4SO4 in PE buffer (25 mm NaH2PO4, 25 mm Na2HPO4, 1 mm EDTA). Fractions containing CAR D1 were dialyzed against crystallization buffer (see below) and concentrated to 10 mg/ml. For the purification of His-tagged CAR D1, NaCl, Tris, pH 7.5, and imidazole were added to the periplasmic extract to final concentrations of 150, 20, and 20 mm, respectively, and the solution was loaded on a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column. Protein bound to the resin was washed with wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 50 mm imidazole) and eluted with elution buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 500 mm imidazole). Eluted CAR D1 was concentrated and loaded on a Superdex200 column (Amersham Biosciences). During this step, the buffer was changed to 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. To form complexes, fiber head and CAR D1 proteins were mixed in an approximate ratio of 1:1 (w/w), incubated for 10 min at 4 °C, and loaded on a Superdex200 column (Amersham Biosciences). During this step, the buffer was changed to crystallization buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5). The peak fractions containing the complex of CAR D1 and fiber head were pooled and concentrated to 8.5 mg/ml (HAd37 fiber head and CAR D1) or 9 mg/ml (CAV-2 fiber head and CAR D1). Crystallization, Data Collection, and Processing of HAd37 Fiber Head in Complex with CAR D1—Crystals were obtained at 20 °C in hanging drops containing 1 μl of protein solution and 1 μl of crystallization solution (17% polyethylene glycol 6000, 0.5 m LiCl, 0.1 m Tris, pH 8) and were flash-frozen in the same solution containing 20% glycerol. Diffraction data were collected to 1.5 Å at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) on beamline ID14-EH1 using an ADSC Q4R detector. Data were integrated and scaled with XDS (52Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1988; 21: 916-924Crossref Scopus (1681) Google Scholar) (space group I23). Data statistics are summarized in Table 1. The asymmetric unit contained one fiber head chain (194 residues, 21.7 kDa) and one chain of CAR D1 (138 residues, 15.3 kDa). Molecular replacement was performed with PHASER (53McCoy A.J.

Data were collected on ESRF beamline ID14-EH1 using an ADSC Q4R detector and integrated with MOSFLM (54Leslie A.G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1696-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar) (Table 1). Crystals diffracted to 1.5 Å and contained two fiber head trimers (591 residues, 65 kDa each) in the asymmetric unit (space group P21). Using an HAd2 fiber head model (Protein Data Bank entry 1QHV) (8van Raaij M.J. Louis N. Chroboczek J. Cusack S. Virology. 1999; 262: 333-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), a convincing molecular replacement solution was found by PHASER (53McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2005; 61: 458-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (1597) Google Scholar). However, the model could not be used directly in refinement or automated model building; therefore, RESOLVE was used in prime-and-switch mode with 6-fold noncrystallographic symmetry (55Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). The six noncrystallographic symmetry matrices and subunit centers of mass were derived from the molecular replacement model using SUPER-POSE (56Iwase K. Hirono S. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 1999; 13: 499-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Initial phases from the model (829 residues) were calculated with SFALL and SIGMAA from the CCP4 suite (57Collaborative Computational Project 4Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19734) Google Scholar), and these were used for automated model building using ARP/wARP (58Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2563) Google Scholar), which automatically built 1027 of the final 1086 residues modeled in the asymmetric unit. Crystallization, Data Collection, and Processing of CAV-2 Fiber Head in Complex with CAR D1—Crystals were obtained at 20 °C in hanging drops containing 1 μl of protein solution and 1 μl of crystallization condition 1 (20% polyethylene glycol monomethyl-ether 550, 0.1 m Bicine, pH 9, 0.1 m NaCl) or condition 2 (0.1 m Hepes, pH 7.5, 30% polyethylene glycol 400, 0.2 m MgCl2). Crystals were flash-frozen without adding additional cryoprotectant. Data were collected on ESRF beamline ID14-EH2 using an ADSC Q4R detector (Table 1). Crystals from condition 1 were of space group I422 (a = b = 219.9 Å, c = 387.5 Å), diffracted to 2.3 Å, and contained four trimeric complexes (i.e. 12 + 12 chains of fiber head + CAR D1) in the asymmetric unit (total 4020 residues, 443.6 kDa). Crystals from condition 2 were of space group I4 (a = b = 158.8 Å, c = 183.2 Å), also diffracted to 2.3 Å, and contained two trimeric complexes (i.e. 6 + 6 chains of fiber head + CAR D1) in the asymmetric unit.

https://openalex.org/W2163727049,"Cyanobacteria contain several genes coding for small one-helix proteins called SCPs or HLIPs with significant sequence similarity to chlorophyll a/b-binding proteins. To localize one of these proteins, ScpD, in the cells of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, we constructed several mutants in which ScpD was expressed as a His-tagged protein (ScpDHis). Using two-dimensional native-SDS electrophoresis of thylakoid membranes or isolated Photosystem II (PSII), we determined that after high-light treatment most of the ScpDHis protein in a cell is associated with PSII. The ScpDHis protein was present in both monomeric and dimeric PSII core complexes and also in the core subcomplex lacking CP43. However, the association with PSII was abolished in the mutant lacking the PSII subunit PsbH. In a PSII mutant lacking cytochrome b559, which does not accumulate PSII, ScpDHis is associated with CP47. The interaction of ScpDHis with PsbH and CP47 was further confirmed by electron microscopy of PSII labeled with Ni-NTA Nanogold. Single particle image analysis identified the location of the labeled ScpDHis at the periphery of the PSII core complex in the vicinity of the PsbH and CP47. Because of the fact that ScpDHis did not form any large structures bound to PSII and because of its accumulation in PSII subcomplexes containing CP47 and PsbH we suggest that ScpD is involved in a process of PSII assembly/repair during the turnover of pigment-binding proteins, particularly CP47.

The sequences of helix I and III are highly similar and evolutionarily related, comprising the Chl a/b-binding (CAB) residues and held together by an arginine (Arg)-glutamic acid (Glu) salt bridge. The CAB residues are made up of about 25 amino acids and include the Chl binding fold. An array of 8 Chl a, 6 Chl b, 3-4 carotenoids, and two lipids are assumed to be bound to each individual LHC apoprotein molecule (6Standfuss J. Terwisscha van Scheltinga A.C. Lamborghini M. Kühlbrandt W. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 919-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). LHC proteins are the most abundant members of the extended protein family with conserved Chl binding residues. Several distant relatives of LHC proteins from this family have been described from higher plants, algae, or cyanobacteria (7Adamska I. Aro E.M.

A. 1995; 92: 636-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). SCPs, predicted to have a single membrane-spanning α-helix, with homologues in red algae and in higher plants, were first identified in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 (13Dolganov N.A.M. Bhaya D. Grossman A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 636-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Scp genes are present in all sequenced cyanobacteria, the highest number of scp genes has been found in the genomes of marine cyanobacteria adapted to high-light (HL) (14Bhaya D. Dufresne A. Vaulot D. Grossman A.R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2002; 215: 209-219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp.

SCPs have been found to be synthesized in response to excess excitation energy stress such as chilling, nitrogen or sulfur deprivation as well as HL (15He Q. Dolganov N. Björkman O. Grossman A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 306-314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the presence of photosynthetic electron transport inhibitor DBMIB, low intensity blue or UV-A light also induced scp genes (16Salem K. van Waasbergen L.G.

Recent studies suggest that a sensory histidine kinase NblS of Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942 may regulate the expression of scp genes (23van Waasbergen L.G. Dolganov N. Grossman A.R. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2481-2490Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Moreover, the NblS homologue in Synechocystis 6803, Hik33 (also called DspA), also controls the expression of scp genes in response to low temperature and osmotic stress (20Mikami K. Kanesaki Y.

The ELIPs have been indicated to function in photoprotection (26Adamska I. Kloppstech K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30221-30226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), most likely by functioning as transient pigment carriers during light stress-induced turnover of Chl-binding proteins (29Hutin C.

Like the ELIPs, the SCPs are localized in the thylakoid membranes and are important for photoacclimation during HL exposure (15He Q. Dolganov N. Björkman O. Grossman A.R. J. Biol.

By analogy to ELIPs, it has been proposed that SCPs may function directly or indirectly in the dissipation of excess light energy (25Jansson S. Andersson J. Kim S.J. Jackowski G. Plant Mol.

They could also serve as transient carriers of Chl (12Funk C. Vermaas W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9397-9404Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and modulate tetrapyrrole biosynthesis (32Xu H.

Here we demonstrate that the ScpD protein tagged by the His6 epitope is specifically associated with PSII. Immunogold labeling, followed by single particle analysis, identified the location of the ScpD protein to be at the periphery of the PSII complex. With the help of various PSII mutants, we have shown that ScpD protein interacts with the PSII proteins PsbH and CP47. These results are discussed in terms of the ScpD role in PSII. Growth Conditions—Wild type (WT) and mutants (as described in Table 1) of Synechocystis 6803 were grown in liquid BG-11 medium (37Rippka R. Deruelles J. Waterbury J.B. Herman M. Stanier R.Y. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1979; 111: 1-61Crossref Google Scholar) supplemented by 10 mm glucose at 30 °C at 30 μmol photon m-2 s-1 (in PSI containing strain) or 3 μmol photon m-2 s-1 (in PSI- strain) on a rotary shaker. For HL treatment, cells were incubated at 500 μmol photon m-2 s-1.TABLE 1Synechocystis 6803 mutantsStrainsRef.WT64ΔCyt65,66ΔCP4767ΔH50ScpDHis/ΔScpDThis studyScpDHis/ΔScpD/PSI−This studyScpDHis/ΔScpD/PSI−/ΔCytThis studyScpDHis/ΔScpD/PSI−/ΔCP47This studyScpDHis/ΔScpD/PSI−/ΔHThis study Open table in a new tab Mutant Construction—The Synechocystis 6803 ScpDHis strain with ScpD protein tagged with the His6 epitope (His tag) on its N terminus, expressed under psbA2 promoter, was constructed in a procedure analogous to that described in Ref. 38Tichý M. Photosynthetica. 2003; 41: 583-588Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar. The scpD gene was amplified by PCR using a mix of Taq and Pfu DNA polymerases and gene-specific primers with artificially generated restriction sites for NdeI and BamHI and containing 6 histidine codons (CAT) in the forward primer. After restriction, the PCR fragment was cloned into the NdeI and BamHI sites of the pSBA plasmid (39Lagarde D. Beuf L. Vermaas W. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2000; 66: 64-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) containing the upstream and downstream regions of the Synechocystis 6803 psbA2 gene. The ligation mix was amplified by PCR using pSBA primers amplifying the scpDHis gene flanked by 0.5-kbp upstream and downstream regions of psbA2. This 1.2 kbp PCR product was directly used to transform the Synechocystis 6803 psbAII-KS strain, where the psbA2 gene was replaced by a kanamycin-resistance/sacB cartridge (39Lagarde D. Beuf L. Vermaas W. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2000; 66: 64-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The sacB gene codes for levan sucrase, leading to sucrose sensitivity of this strain. After transformation, Synechocystis cells were grown on BG-11 plates for 4 days. The transformants were then transferred to plates with 5% sucrose and sucrose-resistant colonies were checked for kanamycin sensitivity. The resulting strain expressing both the wild-type and His-tagged forms of ScpD protein was transformed with chromosomal DNA from the ΔScpD strain (32Xu H. Vavilin D. Funk C. Vermaas W. Plant Mol. Biol. 2002; 49: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Proper insertion of the scpDHis gene was confirmed by DNA sequencing, and deletion of the WT copy of the scpD gene was confirmed by PCR. The ScpDHis/ΔScpD strain was transformed with chromosomal DNA from a PSI- cell to obtain the ScpDHis/ΔScpD/PSI- strain. The ScpDHis/ΔScpD/PSI- strain was further transformed with chromosomal DNA from ΔCyt, ΔCP47, and ΔH cells (see Table 1). The deletions were confirmed by PCR. Radiolabeling of the Cells, Membrane Preparation, and Protein Analysis Using Two-dimensional Blue Native/SDS, Two-dimensional Native Deriphat/SDS Electrophoresis, and Immunoblotting—Radioactive labeling of cells using a mixture of l-[35S]methionine and l-[35S]cysteine (>1000 Ci mmol-1, Trans-label, ICN, final activity 400 μCi ml-1) and isolation of membranes was performed as described in Ref. 40Komenda J.

Isolated membranes were solubilized with n-dodecyl-β-maltoside (DM) (DM/Chl = 20 and 100 (w/w) in PSI-containing and PSI- strain, respectively), and obtained complexes were separated in the first dimension by either blue-native electrophoresis at 4 °C in 5-14% polyacrylamide gel according to (41Schägger H. von Jagow G.

Biochem. 2002; 269: 610-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Subunit composition of the complexes was assessed by electrophoresis in a denaturing 12-20% linear gradient polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea (in the second dimension) (40Komenda J. Reisinger V.

Proteins separated in the gel were transferred onto PVDF membrane. The membrane was incubated with specific primary antibodies followed by incubation with a secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Sigma) and chemiluminescence Lumilight substrate (Roche Applied Science). The primary antibodies used in the study were raised in rabbits against: (i) residues 58-86 of the spinach D1 polypeptide, (ii) residues 380-394 of barley CP47 (40Komenda J. Reisinger V. Müller B.C.

For autoradiography, the gel or the membrane with labeled proteins was exposed to x-ray film at laboratory temperature for 2-3 days. Isolation of PSII and Protein Analysis—The isolation of thylakoid membranes was performed as described in Ref. 42Komenda J. Lupínková L. Kopecký J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 610-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar. The thylakoid membranes were washed until the supernatant became colorless with a buffer containing 25 mm MES, pH 6.5, 5mm MgCl2 and 5 mm CaCl2. The washed thylakoid membranes (0.25 mg Chl ml-1) were solubilized with DM (1% final concentration) for 10 min on ice. Nonsolubilized material was removed by centrifuging at 18,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. PSII complexes were either isolated using sucrose density gradient centrifugation or a combination of affinity and anion exchange chromatography. The supernatant was loaded onto a discontinuous sucrose gradient (20, 30 and 50%, respectively) in buffer containing 25 mm MES, pH 6.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm CaCl2 and 0.04% DM. The PSII complexes were separated by centrifugation at 100,000 rpm (HITACHI Himac CS 120 FX, S100AT5-0208 rotor) for 4 h at 4 °C. The monomeric and dimeric PSII was recovered from the sucrose gradient and concentrated on Microcon YM-50. For chromatography, the supernatant was applied onto the column of chelating Sepharose loaded with copper ions and then the non-bound material directly passed onto the Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) from which the PSII complexes were eluted by 25 mm MES, pH 6.5 containing 250 mm NaCl and 0.03% DM as described in Ref. 42Komenda J. Lupínková L. Kopecký J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 610-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar. Composition of isolated PSII was analyzed by SDS-PAGE in a denaturing 12-20% linear gradient polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea. For electrophoresis, the isolated PSII was solubilized in 25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, containing 2% SDS (w/v) and 2% dithiothreitol (w/v) at room temperature for 60 min. Separated proteins in the gel were either stained by Coomassie Blue or transferred onto PVDF membrane and used for immunodetection. Determination of Chl—Chl was extracted from cell pellets (50 ml, OD730 ∼0.5) by 100% methanol. Chl content was measured spectrophotometrically on a Spectronic Unicam UV500 spectrophotometer (43Porra R.J. Thompson W.A. Kriedemann P.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 975: 384-394Crossref Scopus (4659) Google Scholar). Gold Labeling of the His-tagged PSII Particles—To visualize the position of the ScpDHis subunit, Ni-NTA Nanogold (Nanoprobes Inc.) was used. This label is a gold cluster with attached Ni2+ enabling specific binding of the gold particle to the Histagged proteins. Well-washed thylakoid membranes were suspended in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, and 5 mm CaCl2 at a Chl concentration of 100 μgml-1 and mixed with an equal volume of Ni-NTA Nanogold solution (30 nm). The solution was incubated for 30 min at 4 °C and the free Ni2+-NTA groups on gold labels were saturated by 1 mm l-histidine for a further 10 min on ice. Thylakoid membranes were then solubilized with 1% DM for 15 min and the unsolubilized material was removed by centrifugation at 60,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was loaded onto a freshly prepared 0.1-1.2 m continuous sucrose density gradient prepared by freezing and thawing the centrifuge tubes filled with a buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 0.6 m sucrose, 10 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and 0.05% DM (44Bumba L. Havelkova-Dousova H. Husak M. Vacha F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 2967-2975Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and the PSII complexes were separated by centrifugation at 150,000 × g (Hitachi, P56SW rotor) for 14 h at 4 °C. The lower green band containing the PSII dimers was harvested with a syringe and loaded onto a Sephadex G-25 (Amersham Biosciences) desalting column equilibrated with 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4) containing 0.05% DM. Nonlabeled PSII particles were prepared as described above, but the Ni-NTA Nanogold labeling step was omitted during the procedure. Electron Microscopy and Image Analysis—Freshly prepared labeled PSII complexes eluted from the desalting column were placed on glow-discharged carbon-coated copper grids and negatively stained with 0.75% uranyl acetate. Electron microscopy was performed with a Philips TEM 420 electron microscope using 80 kV at ×60,000 magnification. Micrographs free from astigmatism and drift were scanned with a pixel size corresponding to 4.5 Å at the specimen level. Image analyses were carried out using SPIDER software (45Frank J. Radermacher M. Penczek P. Zhu J. Li Y.H. Ladjadj M. Leith A. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1806) Google Scholar). From 63 micrographs of the PSII cores, about 2900 top-view projections of unlabeled particles and 472 side-view projections of labeled particles were selected for analysis. Both separate data sets were rotationally and translationally aligned, and subjected to multivariate statistical analysis in combination with classification (46van Heel M. Frank J. Ultramicroscopy. 1981; 6: 187-194PubMed Google Scholar, 47Harauz G. Boekema E. van Heel M. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 164: 35-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Classes from each of the subsets were used for refinement of alignments and subsequent classifications. For the final sum, the best of the class members were summed using a cross-correlation coefficient of the alignment procedure as a quality parameter. The resolution of the images was calculated using the Fourier ring correlation method (48van Heel M. Ultramicroscopy. 1987; 21: 95-100Crossref Scopus (299) Google Scholar). For molecular modeling, the coordinates were taken from the Protein Data Bank under the code 1S5L for PSII structure at 3.5-Å resolution (49Ferreira K.N. Iverson T.M. Maghlaoui K. Barber J. Science. 2004; 303: 1831-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (2845) Google Scholar). The overlay cartoon was generated by the freeware program Accelrys ViewerLite 4.2 ScpDHis Protein Is Localized in the Thylakoid Membrane—To localize the ScpD protein in the cells of Synechocystis 6803, we constructed mutants in which the scpD gene had been tagged by the His6 epitope (ScpDHis strains) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As higher accumulations of ScpC/D proteins have been detected in PSI- strains (12Funk C. Vermaas W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9397-9404Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), the ScpDHis/ΔScpD/PSI- strain was used to determine the localization of the ScpDHis protein. Using the anti-His monoclonal antibody, a single band was detected in the thylakoids of the ScpDHis/ΔScpD/PSI- strain (Fig. 1). No such band was detected in the fraction of soluble proteins from this strain and in the thylakoids of PSI- (not shown) and ScpDHis/ΔScpD strains grown at 30 μmol photon m-2 s-1 (Fig. 1). However, the ScpDHis band was detectable in the ScpDHis/ΔScpD strain grown under HL (Fig. 1). The ScpDHis Protein Is Associated with Photosystem II—To further localize the ScpDHis protein in the thylakoid membranes, we performed two-dimensional analysis of thylakoid proteins. Mildly solubilized thylakoid protein complexes from the ScpDHis/ΔScpD/PSI- strain were first separated by nondenaturing blue native (BN) or Deriphat PAGE and their subunit composition was determined by SDS-PAGE in combination with Western blotting in the second dimension. Both methods yielded similar results with the majority of the ScpDHis being present in two complexes at about 300 and 220 kDa (Fig. 2A). These complexes had been previously identified as a monomeric reaction center core complex (RCC1) and a smaller reaction center core subcomplex (RC47), which contains CP47 but no CP43 (40Komenda J.

BN-PAGE provided a better separation of the complexes than Deriphat-PAGE (not shown) and was therefore used subsequently. In the ΔCP47 background where no PSII core is assembled, the ScpDHis/ΔScpD/PSI-/ΔCP47 mutant accumulated a significant amount of ScpDHis; however this protein was localized in a region of the small protein complexes and free proteins (Fig. 2B). Thus, ScpDHis comigrated with PSII in two different buffer systems and ScpDHis association with large thylakoid complexes was dependent on PSII accumulation, indicating that ScpDHis is associated with PSII.FIGURE 3Autoradiogram of thylakoid membrane proteins from HL-induced WT (left) and ScpDHis/ΔScpD (right)of Synechocystis 6803 cells after separation of proteins by two-dimensional BN/SDS-PAGE. Thylakoid membrane proteins from both strains were pulse radiolabeled for 30 min, separated in the first dimension by BN-PAGE and in the second dimension by denaturing SDS-PAGE, blotted onto PVDF membrane, and exposed to x-ray film. For the ScpDHis/ΔScpD autoradiogram, same membrane was used as in Fig. 2A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm that the ScpDHis protein is indeed associated with PSII we used a combination of several independent methods for isolation of PSII. Monomeric and dimeric reaction center core complexes were isolated from the ScpDHis/ΔScpD/PSI- strain by sucrose density gradient centrifugation or by a combination of affinity and ion exchange chromatography. The complexes were further purified by BN-PAGE. Green PSII bands were cut from the native gel and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunodetected with anti-His antibody. ScpDHis protein was present in all PSII preparations (Fig. 4). The His tag is widely used to isolate tagged proteins under native conditions by nickel affinity chromatography allowing co-purification of proteins associated with the tagged protein. However, native isolation of the ScpDHis protein was not successful and no ScpD"
https://openalex.org/W2072742925,"The nucleolar Arf protein has been shown to regulate cell cycle through both p53-dependent and -independent pathways. In addition to the well-characterized Arf-mdm2-p53 pathway, several partners of Arf have recently been described that could participate in alternative regulation process. Among those is the nucleolar protein B23/NPM, involved in the sequential maturation of rRNA. p19ARF can interact with B23/NPM in high molecular complexes and partially inhibit the cleavage of the 32S rRNA, whereas the human p14ARF protein has been shown to participate in the degradation of NPM/B23 by the proteasome. These data led to define Arf as a negative regulator of ribosomal RNA maturation. Our recent finding that the human p14ARF protein was able to specifically interact with the rRNA promoter in a p53-independent context, led us to analyse in vitro and in vivo the consequences of this interaction. Luciferase assay and pulse-chase experiments demonstrated that the rRNA transcription was strongly reduced upon p14ARF overexpression. Investigations on potential interactions between p14ARF and the transcription machinery proteins demonstrated that the upstream binding factor (UBF), required for the initiation of the transcriptional complex, was a new partner of the p14ARF protein. We next examined the phosphorylation status of UBF as UBF phosphorylation is required to recruit on the promoter factors involved in the transcriptional complex. Upon p14ARF overexpression, UBF was found hypophosphorylated, thus unable to efficiently recruit the transcription complex. Taken together, these data define a new p53-independent pathway that could regulate cell cycle through the negative control of rRNA transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1967386798,"Although dysregulation of tight junction (TJ) proteins is observed in epithelial malignancy, their participation in epithelial transformation is poorly understood. Recently we demonstrated that expression of oncogenic Raf 1 in Pa4 epithelial cells disrupts TJs and induces an oncogenic phenotype by downregulating expression of the TJ protein, occludin. Here we report the mechanism by which Raf 1 regulates occludin expression. Raf 1 inhibited occludin transcription by repressing a minimal segment of the occludin promoter in concert with upregulation of the transcriptional repressor, Slug without influencing the well-documented transcriptional repressor, Snail. Overexpression of Slug in Pa4 cells recapitulated the effect of Raf 1 on occludin expression, and depletion of Slug by small interfering RNA abrogated the effect of Raf 1 on occludin. Finally, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays and site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated a direct interaction between Slug and an E-box within the minimal Raf 1-responsive segment of the occludin promoter. These findings support a role of Slug in mediating Raf 1-induced transcriptional repression of occludin and subsequent epithelial to mesenchymal transition."

https://openalex.org/W2172102850,"In bacteria, ribosome-bound Trigger Factor assists the folding of newly synthesized proteins. The N-terminal domain (N) of Trigger Factor mediates ribosome binding, whereas the middle domain (P) harbors peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity. The function of the C-terminal domain (C) has remained enigmatic due to structural instability in isolation. Here, we have characterized a stabilized version of the C domain (CS), designed on the basis of the recently solved atomic structure of Trigger Factor. Strikingly, only the isolated CS domain or domain combinations thereof (NCS, PCS) revealed substantial chaperone activity in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, to disrupt the C domain without affecting the overall Trigger Factor structure, we generated a mutant (Δ53) by deletion of the C-terminal 53 amino acid residues. This truncation caused the complete loss of the chaperone activity of Trigger Factor in vitro and severely impaired its function in vivo. Therefore, we conclude that the chaperone activity of Trigger Factor critically depends on its C-terminal domain as the central structural chaperone module. Intriguingly, a structurally similar module is found in the periplasmic chaperone SurA and in MPN555, a protein of unknown function. We speculate that this conserved module can exist solely or in combination with additional domains to fulfill diverse chaperone functions in the cell."

Ectodomain shedding is essential to the biological functions of HB-EGF and is strictly regulated. However, the mechanism that induces the shedding remains unclear. We have recently identified nardilysin (N-arginine dibasic convertase (NRDc)), a metalloendopeptidase of the M16 family, as a protein that specifically binds HB-EGF (Nishi, E., Prat, A., Hospital, V., Elenius, K., and Klagsbrun, M. (2001) EMBO J. 20, 3342-3350). Here, we show that NRDc enhances ectodomain shedding of HB-EGF. When expressed in cells, NRDc enhanced the shedding in cooperation with tumor necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme (TACE; ADAM17). NRDc formed a complex with TACE, a process promoted by phorbol esters, general activators of ectodomain shedding. NRDc enhanced TACE-induced HB-EGF cleavage in a peptide cleavage assay, indicating that the interaction with NRDc potentiates the catalytic activity of TACE. The metalloendopeptidase activity of NRDc was not required for the enhancement of HB-EGF shedding. Notably, a reduction in the expression of NRDc caused by RNA interference was accompanied by a decrease in ectodomain shedding of HB-EGF.

Ectodomain shedding is an irreversible post-translational modification that releases the extracellular domain of membrane-anchored proteins through proteolysis. A broad spectrum of membrane proteins are susceptible to ectodomain shedding. Ectodomain shedding of most proteins occurs constitutively in resting cells, but can be rapidly and markedly induced by cell activation.

Commun. 2001; 283: 915-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). With respect to the mechanism of the induction, however, very little is known.Ectodomain shedding of HB-EGF is indispensable for G-protein-coupled receptor-induced epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) transactivation, which plays critical roles in biological consequences of G-protein-coupled receptor activation (17Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1491) Google Scholar). The physiological significance of HB-EGF ectodomain shedding was further underscored by the findings that knock-in mice harboring an uncleavable mutant construct of HB-EGF show phenotypes very similar to those of HB-EGF knock-out mice (e.g. hypertrophied cardiac valve and dilated heart) and that knock-in mice with the soluble mutant have even more severe phenotypes (18Yamazaki S.

Notably, a similarly defective valvulogenesis was observed in both EGFR- and TACE-deficient mice, suggesting that HB-EGF-induced EGFR activation and TACE-induced HB-EGF shedding are required for valvulogenesis (19Jackson L.F.

In other words, ectodomain shedding of pro-HBEGF is required for the activation of EGFR by HB-EGF. The same conclusion was obtained in a study that showed that most of the biological effects of EGFR ligands in cell culture are blocked by metalloprotease inhibitors (22Dong J. Opresko L.K.

Prat A. Hospital V. Elenius K. Klagsbrun M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3342-3350Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). NRDc was originally identified as a dibasic selective metalloendopeptidase of the M16 family (24Chesneau V. Pierotti A.R. Barre N. Creminon C. Tougard C. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2056-2061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Pierotti A.R. Prat A. Chesneau V. Gaudoux F. Leseney A.M. Foulon T. Cohen P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

NRDc is expressed mainly in the cytoplasm, but interestingly, it is also exported out of cells and distributed on the cell surface, although it has no apparent signal peptide sequence (27Chesneau V.

While examining the biological significance of the binding of NRDc to pro-HBEGF, we found that NRDc enhances ectodomain shedding of the growth factor. Here, we demonstrate that a metalloendopeptidase, NRDc, potentiates the catalytic activity of TACE and enhances ectodomain shedding of HB-EGF.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids—cDNA encoding human NRDc (Met50-Lys1150, completely matching GenBank™ accession number BC008775) was cloned into pcDNA3.1/V5-His (Invitrogen) to generate pcDNA3.1-hNRDc-V5. The cDNA of human NRDc C-terminally tagged with FLAG was cloned into pcDNA3 and pFast-Bac1 (Invitrogen) to generate pcDNA3-hNRDc-FLAG and pFastBac1-hNRDc-FLAG, respectively. A cDNA encoding an enzymatically inactive mutant of human NRDc was obtained by substituting the Glu235 codon (GAG) with an Ala codon (GCG) using the PCR technique. The full-length human TACE cDNA was cloned into pME18S to generate pME18S-hTACE. The expression plasmid for hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged HB-EGF was described previously (30Gechtman Z. Alonso J.L. Raab G. Ingber D.E. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28828-28835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The expression plasmid for alkaline phosphatase (AP)-tagged HB-EGF (31Tokumaru S. Higashiyama S. Endo T. Nakagawa T. Miyagawa J.I. Yamamori K. Hanakawa Y. Ohmoto H. Yoshino K. Shirakata Y.

Higashiyama.Small Interfering RNAs (siRNAs)—The sequences for siRNA duplexes were as follows: NRDc-1, 5′-GGGUAGUGAUAAUGCCUCAACUGAU-3′; NRDc-2, 5′-GACUACUUAGCUGAGUUCAAUUCCA-3′; Control-2, 5′-ACGUGACACGUUCGGAGAA-3′. NRDc-1 and NRDc-2 are Stealth™ siRNA duplex oligoribonucleotides synthesized by Invitrogen. Control-2 is a control (nonsilencing) siRNA purchased from Qiagen Inc. Control-1 is a Stealth RNAi negative control duplex with medium GC content purchased from Invitrogen, the sequence of which is not available to the public.Antibodies and Reagents—The antibodies were from the following sources: anti-HA tag antibody HA11, Covance; anti-V5 tag antibody, Invitrogen; anti-FLAG tag antibody M2, Sigma; anti-TACE antibodies (C-15 and H-300), Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.; anti-TACE antibody (clone 111633), R&D Systems; anti-HB-EGF antibody, Calbiochem; and anti-glyceraldehyde-3 phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) antibody, Research Diagnostics, Inc. Anti-TACE antibody 41 (used for immunoprecipitation) was a gift from M. E. Milla. Mouse anti-NRDc monoclonal antibody 23 was raised against recombinant human NRDc in our laboratory. Recombinant NRDc was synthesized using the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen). Briefly, pFastBac1-hNRDc-FLAG was introduced into DH10Bac competent cells to isolate recombinant bacmid DNA. Sf9 cells were transfected with the bacmid DNA, and the recombinant baculovirus-containing supernatant was harvested. Sf9 cells inoculated with the recombinant virus were lysed in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.2 mg/ml Pefabloc SCPLUS (Roche Applied Science), and 1% Nonidet P-40, and the total cell lysate was loaded onto an anti-FLAG antibody M2 affinity gel column (Sigma) and eluted with FLAG peptide (100 μg/ml). Recombinant TACE was purchased from R&D Systems.Cells and Transfections—COS-7 and 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. MKN45 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Transfections were carried out using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) for plasmids and siFECTOR (B-Bridge International Inc.) for siRNA according to the manufacturers' instructions. CHO-K1 cells stably expressing HA-HB-EGF (CHO-K1-HA-HB-EGF cells) and AP-HB-EGF (CHOK1-AP-HB-EGF cells) were selected in nutrient mixture F-12 containing 10% fetal calf serum and 500 mg/ml G418, respectively. Clones of CHO-K1-HA-HB-EGF cells were tested for HA-HBEGF expression by Western blotting with anti-HA antibody. CHO-K1-AP-HB-EGF cells were sorted by the expression of AP-HB-EGF (using anti-AP antibody) using a FACSAria flow cytometer (BD Biosciences).Western Blot Analysis—Cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. After blocking with 5% nonfat milk in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20, filters were incubated with primary antibodies, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. The immobilized peroxidase activity was detected with the enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL, Amersham Biosciences).Immunoprecipitation—Cell lysates were incubated with the appropriate antibodies, and immune complexes were collected with protein G-Sepharose beads.Pulldown Assay—Recombinant NRDc (FLAG-tagged at the C terminus; 11 μg/ml), TACE (10 μg/ml), and HB-EGF (2.8 μg/ml) were mixed in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.9), 1 mm CaCl2, and 15 mm ZnCl2. The mixture was incubated with anti-FLAG antibody-conjugated beads for 4 h, followed by extensive washes, and the precipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and blotted with anti-TACE antibody (clone 111633).Peptide Cleavage and Molecular Mass Analysis—The fluorescence-quenching peptide substrate corresponding to the cleavage site of HB-EGF (2-(N-methylamino)benzoyl-LPVENRLYK(2,4-dinitrophenyl)d-Arg-amide) was synthesized by Peptide Institute, Inc. (Osaka, Japan). Peptide substrate for the HB-EGF cleavage site (GLSLPVENRLYTYD) used for molecular mass analysis was synthesized by Hokkaido System Science Co., Ltd. (Hokkaido, Japan). In vitro peptide cleavage assays were performed in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0) and 2.5 μm ZnCl2. Molecular mass analyses of peptides were performed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) using an Ultraflex TOF/TOF system (Bruker Daltonics Inc.).Immunocytochemistry—Cells were fixed with 50% acetone and 50% methanol. Nonspecific staining was blocked with blocking solution (5% donkey and 1% sheep sera in phosphate-buffered saline). The cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with a proper dilution of primary antibodies in blocking solution, followed by the respective secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. The stained cells were observed with a Zeiss LSM 510 META laser scanning confocal microscope or a Zeiss Axioskop 2 fluorescence microscope. Collected data were exported as eight-bit TIFF files and processed using ImageJ Version 1.30 (available at rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/).RESULTSNRDc Induces Ectodomain Shedding of HB-EGF—To define the biological significance of the binding of NRDc to pro-HBEGF, we examined the effects of NRDc on HB-EGF ectodomain shedding. To facilitate detection of shed soluble HB-EGF in the conditioned medium, two N-terminally tagged pro-HB-EGFs, HA-HB-EGF (30Gechtman Z. Alonso J.L. Raab G. Ingber D.E. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28828-28835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and AP-HB-EGF (31Tokumaru S. Higashiyama S. Endo T. Nakagawa T. Miyagawa J.I. Yamamori K. Hanakawa Y. Ohmoto H. Yoshino K. Shirakata Y. Matsuzawa Y. Hashimoto K. Taniguchi N. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 209-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), were used. Recombinant NRDc tagged with FLAG at the C terminus was produced in a baculovirus-insect cell system and purified by immunoaffinity chromatography with anti-FLAG antibody. Coomassie Blue staining of eluted fractions showed very high purity of the recombinant NRDc (Fig. 1A), and the enzymatic activity of NRDc was confirmed by conducting a cleavage assay with a fluorescence-quenching peptide substrate (2-(N-methylamino)benzoyl-GGFLRRVGK(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-amide; fluorescence intensity at 340/430 nm of 38,740 arbitrary units at 177 μm recombinant NRDc and of 1581 arbitrary units at the same concentration of the enzymatically inactive mutant of NRDc). Treatment of CHO-K1-HA-HB-EGF cells with recombinant NRDc induced ectodomain shedding of HB-EGF in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). Recombinant NRDc also enhanced HB-EGF shedding in CHO-K1-AP-HB-EGF cells in a similar manner (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, NRDc induced HB-EGF shedding more rapidly compared with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) in the early time course.Although NRDc is found in conditioned media, it is found primarily in the cytosol and on the cell surface (27Chesneau V. Prat A. Segretain D. Hospital V. Dupaix A. Foulon T. Jegou B. Cohen P. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2737-2745Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Hospital V. Nishi E. Klagsbrun M. Cohen P. Seidah N.G. Prat A. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 229-238Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we examined the effect of coexpression of NRDc and AP-HB-EGF on HB-EGF shedding. Cells expressing NRDc released significantly more AP activity in the conditioned medium compared with cells transfected with an empty vector (Fig. 2A). The enzymatically inactive mutant of NRDc (E235A) also enhanced HBEGF shedding (Fig. 2A), indicating that the metalloendopeptidase activity of NRDc is not required for the enhancement of HB-EGF shedding. Western blot analysis showed a comparable expression level of NRDc and the inactive mutant of NRDc (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that NRDc does not directly cleave HB-EGF, suggesting that it modulates shedding by regulating other pathways of the mechanism.FIGURE 2Expression of NRDc induces ectodomain shedding of HB-EGF, and NRDc enzymatic activity is not required for the induction. A, an expression vector encoding AP-HB-EGF was cotransfected into COS-7 cells with a control vector, an expression vector for wild-type NRDc-V5 (WT), or an enzymatically inactive mutant of NRDc-V5 (E235A (E > A)). The culture medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.1% bovine serum albumin 20 h post-transfection.

To determine whether NRDc has a cooperative effect on TACE activity, cotransfection experiments were performed in COS-7 cells, and HBEGF ectodomain shedding was evaluated by Western blotting for HBEGF released into the conditioned medium. The transfection of only NRDc had a significant but relatively small effect on HB-EGF shedding (2.3-fold increase) (Fig. 3, A, compare the first and second lanes; and B, compare the first and second bars), compatible with the result in Fig. 2A. However, coexpression of NRDc and TACE dramatically enhanced HB-EGF ectodomain shedding compared with expression of TACE alone (Fig. 3, A, compare the third and fourth lanes; and B, compare the third and fourth bars). A quantitative analysis of shed HB-EGF in the five independent experiments clearly showed that the effect of the combination was not additive, but was synergistic (2.3-fold increase by NRDc, 4.5-fold increase by TACE, and 11.3-fold increase by NRDc and TACE) (Fig. 3B). We performed the same cotransfection experiments in a different cell line (293T cells) and obtained very similar results (Fig. 3C). The synergistic effect of the enzymatically inactive mutant of NRDc on TACE-induced HB-EGF shedding was also examined in 293T cells. The inactive NRDc mutant showed a similar enhancing effect on HBEGF shedding compared with wild-type NRDc (Fig. 3, C and D), indicating that the metalloendopeptidase activity of NRDc is not required for the shedding-enhancing effect of NRDc. HBEGF has multiple forms because of N-terminal heterogeneity and O-glycosylation as reported previously (35Higashiyama S. Lau K. Besner G.E. Abraham J.A. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6205-6212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and shows different patterns in different cell lines (Fig. 3, A and C).FIGURE 3NRDc and TACE cooperate to enhance ectodomain shedding of HB-EGF. A, HA-HB-EGF was transiently cotransfected into COS-7 cells with combinations of expression vectors for NRDc-V5 and TACE as indicated. The culture medium of transfected cells was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.1% bovine serum albumin 20 h post-transfection. The conditioned medium (CM) and total cell lysates (TCL) were collected after an additional4hof incubation. Western blot analysis with anti-V5 (NRDc), anti-TACE (C-15), and anti-HA (HB-EGF) antibodies was conducted for the total cell lysates. Blotting with anti-HA antibody (HB-EGF) was carried out for the soluble HB-EGF released in the conditioned medium, which was partially purified with heparin-Sepharose beads.

In this study, we have shown that p21<i><sup>waf1</sup></i> functions as a transcriptional repressor of the <i>myc</i> and <i>cdc25A</i> genes. Ectopic expression of the cell cycle inhibitor down-modulates <i>myc</i> and <i>cdc25A</i> transcription but has no effect on cdk4 levels. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we found that p21<i><sup>waf1</sup></i> is recruited to the promoters of these two genes together with the STAT3 and E2F1 transcription factors. Its presence on DNA is associated with an inhibition of the recruitment of the p300 histone acetylase and with a down-regulation of histone H4 acetylation. The same effect was also observed following DNA damage because topoisomerase inhibitors such as sn38 or doxorubicin also induce the association of p21<i><sup>waf1</sup></i> with DNA. Following transcriptional repression of the <i>myc</i> and <i>cdc25A</i> genes, cells were arrested in the fraction with 4 N DNA content.

https://openalex.org/W2043019778,"Small GTPase Rab27A plays a pivotal role in melanosome transport in melanocytes and in secretion by various secreting cells. Because the GTP- or GDP-locked mutant of Rab27A causes perinuclear aggregation of melanosomes, appropriate GTP-GDP cycling of Rab27A is essential for melanosome transport, and certain guanine nucleotide exchange factors and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) of Rab27A must be present in melanocytes. However, no such regulators of Rab27A have ever been identified. In this study we developed novel methods of rapidly screening 40 different TBC (Tre2/Bub2/Cdc16) proteins, putative Rab-GAPs, for Rab27A-GAP by: (i) searching for TBC proteins that induce melanosome aggregation in melanocytes; (ii) trapping GTP-Rab27A with a Rab27A effector domain (i.e. the SHD of Slac2-a) in cultured cells that express both Rab27A and TBC proteins; and (iii) measuring in vitro Rab27A-GAP activity. These methods allowed us to identify EPI64, previously characterized as an EBP50-binding protein that contains an orphan TBC domain, as a specific Rab27A-GAP. We further showed that mutations in the catalytic domain of EPI64 caused complete loss of its ability to induce melanosome aggregation. This is the first report of screening for Rab27A-GAP based on functional interactions, and our screening methods can be applied for other uncharacterized TBC proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2058264483,"RIP140 is a corepressor for nuclear receptors that regulates energy expenditure in adipose tissue by suppressing the expression of clusters of metabolic genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism. The gene encoding RIP140/Nrip1 contains only one coding exon but has multiple promoters and 5′ non-coding exons that are subject to alternative splicing. In adipocytes we have defined a promoter, referred to as P2, that is preferentially utilized and activated during adipogenesis. Expression studies and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that estrogen-related receptor α (ERRα), the level of which increases during adipogenesis in parallel with RIP140, stimulates transcription from the P2 promoter. Further analysis indicates that ERRα is capable of activating RIP140 gene transcription by two mechanisms, directly by binding to an estrogen receptor element/ERR element at –650/–633 and indirectly through Sp1 binding sites in the proximal promoter. Thus, the up-regulation of RIP140 by ERRα during adipogenesis may provide an inhibitory feedback mechanism to control the expression of many nuclear receptor target genes. RIP140 is a corepressor for nuclear receptors that regulates energy expenditure in adipose tissue by suppressing the expression of clusters of metabolic genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism. The gene encoding RIP140/Nrip1 contains only one coding exon but has multiple promoters and 5′ non-coding exons that are subject to alternative splicing. In adipocytes we have defined a promoter, referred to as P2, that is preferentially utilized and activated during adipogenesis. Expression studies and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that estrogen-related receptor α (ERRα), the level of which increases during adipogenesis in parallel with RIP140, stimulates transcription from the P2 promoter. Further analysis indicates that ERRα is capable of activating RIP140 gene transcription by two mechanisms, directly by binding to an estrogen receptor element/ERR element at –650/–633 and indirectly through Sp1 binding sites in the proximal promoter. Thus, the up-regulation of RIP140 by ERRα during adipogenesis may provide an inhibitory feedback mechanism to control the expression of many nuclear receptor target genes. Adipogenesis is regulated by the coordinated expression of transcription factors that control the formation and function of white adipose tissue as a fat storage depot. The identification of many of these transcription factors has relied upon the analysis of preadipocyte cell lines, notably 3T3-L1, that can be induced to undergo differentiation upon exposure to a number of hormone signals, namely glucocorticoid, insulin, and inducers of cAMP. This leads to the activation of a cascade of transcription factors including CCAAT enhancer-binding protein β, CCAAT enhancer-binding protein δ, and SREBP1c that then induce the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ and CCAAT enhancer-binding protein α and the formation of adipocytes (1Fajas L.

Many other transcription factors, such as Krupple-like factor 5 and E2F1, also facilitate adipogenesis by promoting expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, whereas some, such as E2F4 and GATA2/3 that are inhibitory, are down-regulated during adipogenesis (6Oishi Y.

The importance of these transcription factors has been confirmed by the analysis of mouse gene knockouts, but CCAAT enhancer-binding protein α and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ2 appear to play a crucial role, with the latter often regarded as a master regulator of adipogenesis (10Linhart H.G.

The function of adipose tissue in the control of fat storage and utilization also depends on the transcriptional control of networks of genes. Among the many transcription factors that control metabolic gene networks are nuclear receptors including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, thyroid hormone receptors, and estrogen-related receptors (ERRs) 2The abbreviations used are: ERR, estrogen-related receptor; ERE, estrogen receptor element; ERRE, ERR element; RIP140, repressor-interacting protein 140; Sp1, specificity factor 1; SREBP, sterol response element-binding protein; PGC-1, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; siRNA, small interfering RNA; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation.

The ability of nuclear receptors to regulate the expression of genes involved in triglyceride synthesis or fatty acid oxidation is mediated by coactivators and corepressors. Among these are the PGC-1 coactivators that seem to play key roles in activating metabolic gene networks (18Kamei Y. Ohizumi H. Fujitani Y. Nemoto T. Tanaka T. Takahashi N. Kawada T. Miyoshi M.

Although the importance of gene activation is well established, it is evident that gene repression is also a regulatory mechanism in adipogenesis (21Yu C. Markan K. Temple K.A. Deplewski D. Brady M.J. Cohen R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13600-13605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Recent studies have determined that gene repression is also a crucial factor in adipocyte function. In particular, the RIP140 corepressor is essential for triglyceride storage in adipose tissue, with RIP140 null mice being lean and resistant to high fat diet-induced obesity (22Leonardsson G. Steel J.H. Christian M. Pocock V. Milligan S. Bell J. So P.W. Medina-Gomez G. Vidal-Puig A. White R. Parker M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 8437-8442Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). The depletion of fat stores in white adipose tissue is accompanied by an increase in expression of clusters of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation, glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and glucose utilization (22Leonardsson G. Steel J.H. Christian M. Pocock V. Milligan S. Bell J. So P.W. Medina-Gomez G. Vidal-Puig A. White R. Parker M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Previous work has demonstrated that RIP140, which is encoded by a single exon (25Cavailles V. Dauvois S. L'Horset F. Lopez G. Hoare S. Kushner P.J. Parker M.G.

Its expression is subject to regulation by peptide hormones, retinoids, and steroid hormones (26White R. Leonardsson G. Rosewell I. Ann J.M. Milligan S. Parker M. Nat.

Sequencing of transcripts from breast cancer cells identified the presence of additional non-coding exons, one of which is downstream of the ERE at –100 kb (29Augereau P. Badia E. Fuentes M. Rabenoelina F. Corniou M. Derocq D. Balaguer P. Cavailles V. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 1338-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 33Carroll J.S. Liu X.S. Brodsky A.S. Li W. Meyer C.A.

Because the distal ERE is capable of physically interacting with this non-coding region, it appears that estrogens stimulate RIP140 transcription through both distal and proximal regulatory domains (33Carroll J.S. Liu X.S. Brodsky A.S. Li W. Meyer C.A. Szary A.J. Eeckhoute J. Shao W. Hestermann E.V. Geistlinger T.R. Fox E.A. Silver P.A. Brown M. Cell. 2005; 122: 33-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). Nuclear receptors have been shown to act both directly by binding to specific DNA sequences as well as indirectly via association with other transcription factors such as NF-κb and Sp1 (35Kalaitzidis D. Gilmore T.D. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2005; 16: 46-52Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 36Safe S. Kim K. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2004; 77: 1-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). This increases the complexity of nuclear receptor action on target promoters. RIP140 is highly expressed in white and brown adipose tissue relative to other tissues, and expression profiling and real-time PCR analysis indicate that it increases progressively in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes when they are induced to undergo adipogenesis (22Leonardsson G. Steel J.H. Christian M. Pocock V. Milligan S. Bell J. So P.W. Medina-Gomez G. Vidal-Puig A. White R. Parker M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 34167-34174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). This increase is consistent with the role of RIP140 in controlling the function of mature adipocytes rather than the process of adipogenesis. In this study, we have determined the exon-intron organization of the RIP140 gene and found that it is subject to alternate splicing from multiple promoters, one of which is specifically utilized in adipocytes. We focused on the mechanism by which RIP140 expression is up-regulated following adipogenesis and report a dual role for the orphan nuclear receptor ERRα in regulating RIP140 expression. 5′RACE—RNA from the human breast cancer cell line ZR-75, mouse 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and mouse ovarian tissue was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer. 5′RACE using the RNA described above and the RLM-RACE kit (Ambion) was carried out according to the manufacturer's guidelines. PCR products were cloned using pCRII-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced using standard methods by the AB1 3100 sequencer. Real-time PCR—RNA was extracted using TRIzol as described above, and 1 μg was reverse transcribed using the Superscript First Strand synthesis kit (Invitrogen). Real-time PCR was carried out with the Opticon 2 (GRI) detection system. Primers (Thermoelectron) and FAM-labeled Taqman probes (Qiagen) were designed using Primer Express software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The ribosomal coding gene L19 was used to normalize cDNA levels, and the bacterial artificial chromosome RP23–71H12 (bacpac.chori.org/) containing the whole mouse RIP140 gene was used to generate a standard curve for absolute quantification of mRNA. In Situ Hybridization—Exons 1a and 1b were amplified using specific primers and cloned into pCRII-TOPO vector. RNA probes were transcribed using a Megascript SP6 or T7 kit (Ambion). 3T3-L1 cells, grown on plastic chamber slides, were fixed in neutral buffered formalin and hybridized to digoxigenin-labeled probes corresponding to RIP140 exons 1a and 1b as described previously (38Steel J.H. Jeffery R.E. Longcroft J.M. Rogers L.A. Poulsom R. Eur. J. Histochem. 1998; 42: 143-150PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid Construction—Each RIP140 promoter region was cloned into the pGL3 basic vector (Promega). To generate P1, a 3.5-kb region, located directly upstream of exon 1a, was amplified from mouse genomic DNA using 5′-CCAATTGAGCTCTCCTGCAGTCTTCCTGGTCT-3′ (forward primer, F) and 5′-AATTGGCTCGAGGGAACCTGGTTTCTCTTCTGC-3′ (reverse primer, R) and cloned using SacI and XhoI. For P2, a –791 to +16 nucleotide region relative to exon 1b was amplified using 5′-CCAATTCTCGAGCAAAGCAGCAGAAGAGAAACC-3′ (F) and 5′-AATTGGAAGCTTCTCTGCTGCAATGTCTGCGAGGCTG-3′ (R) and cloned using XhoI and HindIII. The P1/P2 construct was amplified using the forward P1 primer and a modified reverse P2 primer (XhoI site instead of HindIII), and the fragment was cloned using SacI and XhoI. The P2 construct containing point mutations in the ERR binding sites was generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All P2 deletion mutants were constructed from PCR products amplified from the P2 wild-type construct. Reporter construct sequences were confirmed using standard methods by the AB1 3100 sequencer. Transient Transfection Assay—Transient transfection assays were carried out using Cos1 and 3T3-L1 cells. Cos1 cells were seeded in 96-well plates in 5% dextran charcoal-stripped fetal bovine calf serum. After 24 h, when cells reached between 50–80% confluence, 20 ng of either wild-type or mutant P2 constructs were transfected into each well with 5 ng of pCMV-Renilla (Promega) using FuGENE (Roche Applied Science). 25 h post-transfection the ERRα inverse agonist XCT790 (10 μm) (GSK) and/or mithramycin A (100 nm) (BIOMOL) was added as indicated in the figure legends. 48 h post-transfection, cell extracts were prepared for analysis using the luminescence reporter gene assay system (PerkinElmer), and luciferase activity was measured using the Victor2 1420 Multilabel counter (PerkinElmer). 3T3-L1 cells were seeded in 6-well plates in medium containing 10% newborn calf serum in order to reach confluence 24 h later. Immediately after seeding cells, each well was transfected with 20 μg of either P1, P2, or P1/2 and 500 ng of pCMV-Renilla. 24 h post-transfection, medium was replaced with 10% fetal bovine serum containing an adipocyte differentiation mixture (170 nm insulin, 250 nm dexamethasone, 500 μm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 2.5 nm rosiglitazone). 48 h after the differentiation mixture was added, it was replaced with medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, rosiglitazone (2.5 nm), and insulin (170 nm) and maintained like this for a further 24 h, when cell extracts were prepared for analysis as described above. Data shown are representative of four independent experiments. Western Blot Analysis—A modified method of Rittenhouse and Marcus was used for protein analysis (39Rittenhouse J. Marcus F. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 442-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by BCA kit (Pierce), and equal amounts of whole cell extracts (50 μg) were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel before electrotransfer at 120 V onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Hybond P; Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Nonspecific binding sites were blocked by 1 h of incubation with 5% dried skimmed milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS), 130 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6) containing 1% Tween (TBS-T). Primary antibodies were incubated at the indicated dilutions in TBS-T containing 2.5% dried skimmed milk overnight at 4 °C as follows: ERRα (LS-A5402; 1 in 1000; Lifespan), RIP140 (mouse monoclonal antibody generated against residues 301–478; 1 in 500), RNA polymerase II (Sc-899; 1 in 1000; Santa Cruz), SREBP-1 (Sc-8984X; 1 in 5000; Santa Cruz), E2F-1 (Sc-22820; 1 in 5000; Santa Cruz), and Sp1 (1 in 5000; S9809; Sigma). All secondary antibodies were incubated in TBS-T at room temperature, 1 h, 1 in 5000. For detection of ERRα, RNA polymerase II, SREBP-1, Sp1, and E2F1, the blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated polyclonal goat anti-rabbit IgG (DAKO P0448). For detection of RIP140, the blot was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated polyclonal goat anti-mouse IgG (DAKO PO447). Protein bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL plus Western blotting detection; Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—ERRα was in vitro translated from pCMX-ERRα using the TNT T7 polymerase Quick-Coupled Transcription/Translation System (Promega). Electrophoretic mobility shift assay studies were carried out as described previously (40Fawell S.E. Lees J.A. White R. Parker M.G. Cell. 1990; 60: 953-962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar) with the following modifications: 1 μl of in vitro translated ERRα was incubated with 100 ng of a T4-polynucleotide kinase end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe corresponding to the RIP140 ERE/ERRE. For supershift analysis, 1 μg of ERRα antibody was added to the reaction. DNA-protein complexes were separated and visualized as described previously. ChIP—Cells were incubated in 10% formaldehyde for 15 min at 37 °C. The cells were then lysed, sonicated, and chromatin immunoprecipitated with 5 μgofERRα antibody as described previously (23Christian M. Kiskinis E. Debevec D. Leonardsson G. White R. Parker M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9383-9391Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). DNA fragments were purified, and PCR amplification was performed using P2 promoter-specific oligonucleotide primers. siRNA—To deplete cells of Sp1, Sp1-targeting small interfering RNA (siRNA) from Dharmacon was used, target sequence: 5′-AAAGCGCUUCAUGAGGAGUGA-3′. Cos1 cells were transfected in a 24-well plate with either 100 pmol siSp1 or siControl (5′-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGU-3′) and 100 ng of P2 luciferase reporter gene, 100 ng of pCMX-ERRα, and 20 ng of pcDNA3-PGC-1α using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as described previously (41Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Weber K. Tuschl T. Methods. 2002; 26: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar). Medium was refreshed 5 and 24 h after transfection, and cell extracts were prepared for analysis using the luminescence reporter gene assay system as described above. Computer-assisted Sequence Analysis—Computer-assisted sequence analysis of the DNA sequence contained in P2 was carried out using the TRANSFAC motif library found at //motif.genome.jp (42Heinemeyer T.

All primer and probe sequences not listed are available on request. Transcription start sites from the RIP140 gene were determined by 5′RACE using RNA extracted from a number of cell types, including differentiated mouse 3T3-L1 adipocytes, mouse ovarian tissue, and human ZR-75 breast cancer cells. Several distinct tissue- and cell-specific RNA transcripts were identified that differ at their 5′ ends, but they all share a single common coding exon that we had identified previously (25Cavailles V. Dauvois S. L'Horset F. Lopez G. Hoare S. Kushner P.J. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3741-3751Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar, 26White R. Leonardsson G. Rosewell I. Ann J.M. Milligan S. Parker M. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1368-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Comparison of the transcripts indicates that exons 1a, 1b, 2, 3, and 5 are conserved in the mouse and human genome but revealed the existence of additional novel exons, namely 1c, 4a, and 4b that are not conserved (Fig. 1, A and B). Exons 1a, 1b, and 1c were found at the 5′ ends of distinct transcripts (Fig. 1, A and B and supplemental data), suggesting that the mouse gene encoding RIP140 may contain at least three promoters. From our analysis we established that RIP140 mRNA from 3T3-L1 adipocytes was transcribed from four exons, namely 1a or 1b, 2, 3, and 5 (Fig. 1A). The alternately spliced transcripts contain exon 1a or 1b but never both, suggesting that the Nrip1 gene might be transcribed from two promoters in adipocytes that we named P1 and P2. We determined the relative expression levels of the two RNA transcripts during adipogenesis using real-time PCR. Analysis of exon 5 expression showed an increase as 3T3-L1 cells undergo differentiation (Fig. 1C) in accordance with published data (22Leonardsson G. Steel J.H. Christian M. Pocock V. Milligan S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 34167-34174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), which is accompanied by a parallel increase in exon 1b, but not exon 1a, expression. Likewise, in situ hybridization showed a marked increase in transcripts derived from exon 1b, but not exon 1a, following differentiation (Fig. 1D). Thus we conclude that the Nrip1 gene is transcribed predominantly from the P2 promoter upstream of the exon 1b in adipocytes. We next investigated the relative promoter activities of DNA sequences contained in either the 3.5-kb region upstream of exon 1a (P1), the –791/+16 region relative to exon 1b transcription start site (P2), or the DNA sequence comprising both (P1/P2). The fragments were fused to a luciferase reporter gene, transiently transfected in 3T3-L1 cells, and luciferase activity was measured before and after differentiation (Fig. 2A). P1 and P2 exhibited similar basal activities in undifferentiated 3T3-L1 cells, but that of P2 increased to a greater extent following adipocyte differentiation. The presence of both P1 and P2 did not result in a further increase in reporter activity. Therefore, we conclude that the 720-bp DNA sequence between the 1a and 1b exons contains regulatory elements sufficient for the increased transcription of the RIP140 gene during adipogenesis. We used computer-assisted sequence analysis to identify putative transcription factor binding sites in the P2 promoter.

https://openalex.org/W2115721023,"Apicomplexan parasites rely on actin-based motility to drive host cell invasion. Motility and invasion also require thrombospondin-related anonymous protein (TRAP) adhesins, which are secreted apically and translocated to the posterior end of the parasite before they are shed by the activity of a rhomboid protease. TRAP orthologs, including Toxoplasma gondii MIC2 (microneme protein 2), possess a short cytoplasmic tail, which is essential for motility. Previous studies have shown that aldolase forms a critical bridge between actin filaments and the cytoplasmic domains of MIC2 and TRAP. The cytoplasmic tails of TRAP family members harbor a conserved penultimate tryptophan, which is essential for aldolase binding, and clustered acidic residues. Herein, we determined the role of the conserved acidic residues by using alanine point mutants to investigate aldolase binding in vitro and to test functionality in the parasite. Our studies revealed two separate acidic residue clusters in the cytoplasmic domain of MIC2 that are essential for parasite survival. One region, located at the extreme C terminus, is required for the direct interaction with aldolase, whereas the second upstream acidic region is not necessary for aldolase binding but is nonetheless essential to parasite survival. Both acidic domains are conserved throughout TRAP orthologs, implicating a central role for these motifs in apicomplexan motility.

Toxoplasma gondii is a member of the phylum Apicomplexa, which is unified by a complex cytoskeleton; the presence of an apical conoid structure in most members; and three sets of apical secretory organelles: the micronemes, rhoptries, and dense granules (1Morrissette N.S.

Apicomplexans are primarily obligate intracellular organisms and must invade host cells to survive (4Sibley L.D. Science. 2004; 304: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). In addition to invasion of host cells, the gliding motility of T. gondii contributes to productive dissemination to new sites of infection (5Barragan A. Sibley L.D. Trends Microbiol. 2003; 11: 426-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The ability to invade is absolutely dependent on the actin-based gliding motility of the parasite (6Dobrowolski J.M. Niesman I.R. Sibley L.D. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1997; 37: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Gliding motility is a substrate-dependent mode of locomotion that is a hallmark of apicomplexan organisms (4Sibley L.D.

Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 383-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Invasion by T. gondii is a multistep process that is largely independent of the host cell. Initially, secretion of the microneme contents results in deposition of adhesive molecules onto the parasite surface, which enables multivalent contacts between the apical end of the parasite and the host cell to be established (9Carruthers V.B. Sibley L.D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 73: 114-123PubMed Google Scholar). Translocation of the secreted microneme proteins toward the parasite posterior pulls the organism within the host cell (12Carruthers V.B. Sherman G.D. Sibley L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14346-14353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Productive invasion of the host cell also requires a cleavage event, severing the microneme extracellular adhesive component from the parasite surface by an intramembrane rhomboid protease (13Dowse T.J.

One of the proteins first demonstrated as integral for gliding motility and subsequent invasion identified in Plasmodium was the thrombospondin-related anonymous protein (TRAP) 4The abbreviations used are: TRAP, thrombospondin-related anonymous protein; TRAPt, thrombospondin-related anonymous protein cytoplasmic tail; MIC2t, MIC2 cytoplasmic tail; GST, glutathione S-transferase; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter.

Dijkema R. Kok J.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 49: 277-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), Cryptosporidium (TRAP-C1) (21Spano F. Putignani L. Naitza S. Puri C. Wright S. Crisanti A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 92: 147-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and T. gondii (MIC2) (22Wan K.L. Carruthers V.B. Sibley L.D. Ajioka J.W. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 84: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). MIC2 (microneme protein 2) and other TRAP family members are type I transmembrane proteins, the extracellular domains of which contain two motifs: an A-domain and one or more type 1 thrombospondin repeats (22Wan K.L. Carruthers V.B. Sibley L.D. Ajioka J.W. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 84: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Additionally, both proteins possess a short C-terminal cytoplasmic domain or tail. The cytoplasmic tails do not exhibit extensive primary sequence similarity, but contain a concentration of acidic amino acid residues and a penultimate tryptophan (23Jewett T.J. Sibley L.D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 885-894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Deletion of the TRAP cytoplasmic tail (TRAPt) in Plasmodium berghei sporozoites results in non-motile parasites, despite the presentation of the ectodomain on the parasite surface (24Kappe S. Bruderer T. Gantt S. Fujioka H. Nussenzweig V. Ménard R. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 937-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Similarly, the cytoplasmic tail of MIC2 (MIC2t) is essential for parasite survival (25Jewett T.J. Sibley L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 275: 9362-9369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic tails are functionally conserved as shown by Kappe et al. (24Kappe S. Bruderer T. Gantt S. Fujioka H. Nussenzweig V. Ménard R. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 937-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), who found that wild-type gliding motility can be restored by replacing the TRAPt with the MIC2t, despite the absence of primary amino acid sequence similarity. The experimental results strongly suggest that the cytoplasmic tail has a conserved function in motility. Because of the crucial roles of the TRAP family of adhesins and the motor complex during effective gliding motility, it was hypothesized the TRAPt and MIC2t might directly interact with the actin cytoskeleton; however, numerous experimental studies ruled out a role for direct binding (26Ménard R. Cell. Microbiol. 2001; 3: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 27Opitz C. Soldati D. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 28Brossier F. Sibley L.D. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2005; 37: 2266-2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Instead, the cytoplasmic domains of MIC2 and TRAP were shown to interact with aldolase, thus bridging the interaction between extracellular adhesive domains and the cytoskeleton (23Jewett T.J. Sibley L.D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 885-894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). In addition to its participation in glycolysis, the homotetrameric enzyme is capable of bundling and cross-linking actin filaments (29Wang J. Morris A.J. Tolan D.R. Pagliaro L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6861-6865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Thus, aldolase functions as an intermediary to link the parasite cytoskeleton to the extracellular adhesin, powering motility and subsequent invasion. A previous study demonstrated that the interaction between the TRAPt and aldolase in vitro requires the penultimate tryptophan and acidic residues at the extreme C terminus of the cytoplasmic tail (30Buscaglia C.A. Coppens I. Hol W.G. Nussenzweig V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4947-4957Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). We sought to more thoroughly examine the role of two clusters of acidic residues in the MIC2t in the aldolase interaction in vitro and in survival in vivo. Our findings define two essential interactions in the MIC2t, which are likely conserved in the phylum. Growth of Host Cells and Parasite Strains—T. gondii tachyzoites of the RH (ATCC 50174), RH hxgprt- (31Donald R.G. Roos D.S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 91: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and EtM1/TgM2KO (32Huynh M.H. Opitz C. Kwok L.Y. Tomley F.M. Carruthers V.B. Soldati D. Cell. Microbiol. 2004; 6: 771-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) strains were used in this study. Parasites were maintained by growth in monolayers of human foreskin fibroblasts propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), and 20 μg/ml gentamycin (complete medium). Protein Sequence Alignment of TRAP Family Cytoplasmic Tails—Protein sequence alignment of the TRAP family cytoplasmic tails was carried out using ClustalW (available at www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/) with the default parameters. The following protein sequences were obtained from the NCBI Protein Database using the indicated accessions numbers: T. gondii MIC2 (accession number AAB63303), Neospora caninum MIC2 (accession number AAF01565), Cryptosporidium parvum TRAP-C1 (accession number AAC48311), Plasmodium falciparum merozoite-specific TRAP homolog (accession number PF10_0281), T. gondii MIC6 (accession number AAD28185), P. falciparum CTRP (circumsporozoite protein/thrombospondin-related anonymous protein-related protein; accession number CAB38978), Eimeria tenella MIC1 (accession number AAD03350), and P. falciparum TRAP (accession number AAA29778). Cloning of MIC2t Point Mutants—Mutants were generated in a plasmid encoding the MIC2t from Ser721 to Glu769, fused to the C terminus of glutathione S-transferase (GST), as described previously (23Jewett T.J. Sibley L.D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 885-894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Point mutants were generated using PCR with the following strategy. The MIC2t was amplified from cDNA using the forward primer FP-MIC2t (5′-GAACCCGGGAGTTACCACTACTATTTGAGCTC-3′) and a reverse primer encoding the specified point mutation to alanine. The PCR products were purified on QIAquick PCR purification columns (Qiagen Inc.), digested with SmaI and EcoRI (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), and cloned into similarly digested pGEX-3X vector (Amersham Biosciences) to generate translational fusions with the C terminus of GST. The c-Myc epitope-tagged constructs expressing promoterless wild-type MIC2 and point mutants were generated from a previously described full-length version of the MIC2 gene (37Brossier F. Jewett T.J. Lovett J.L. Sibley L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6229-6234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). A 1-kilobase pair DNA fragment containing an internal c-Myc epitope tag at Ser659 was PCR-amplified using a 5′-primer appended with a HindIII restriction site (5′-GAGCAGAAGCTTATCTCAGAAG-3′) and a 3′-primer appended with a PacI restriction site (5′-GGGTTAATTAACTACTCCATCCACATATCACTATC-3′). The point mutations were generated by altering the sequence of the reverse primer. The resulting PCR products (lacking the C-terminal 9-amino acid hemagglutinin tag) were purified using QIAquick PCR purification columns, digested with HindIII and PacI (New England Biolabs), and cloned into similarly digested MIC2-TAG-P- vector as described previously (25Jewett T.J. Sibley L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 275: 9362-9369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmids contained a promoterless copy of either the wild-type or mutant MIC2 gene containing an internal c-Myc epitope tag. Plasmids for expression of c-Myc epitope-tagged point mutants under the control of the native promoter were generated by digesting the promoterless constructs with PacI and RsrII. The resulting DNA fragment was then subcloned into a similarly digested MIC2 HXGPRT expression plasmid as described previously (31Donald R.G. Roos D.S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 91: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Quantitative Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) Analysis—Recombinant T. gondii aldolase and the GST-MIC2t fusion proteins were purified from the BL21 strain of Escherichia coli as described previously (23Jewett T.J. Sibley L.D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 885-894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Following purification, recombinant proteins were dialyzed overnight in ½× XB buffer (½× XB buffer = 25 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm EDTA (pH 7.5)). Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA assay (Pierce). T. gondii aldolase was used to coat high binding 96-well Greiner Bio-One polypropylene ELISA plates (VWR International, Batavia, IL) with 100 μl of 10 μg/ml ELISA coating buffer (50 mm sodium carbonate/bicarbonate (pH 9.6)) overnight at 4 °C. ELISA plates were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.01% Tween 20 and blocked in 10% bovine serum albumin in PBS containing 0.01% Tween 20 for 1 h. 10-Fold serial dilutions of GST-MIC2t fusion protein (wild-type or point mutants) were made in 1× XB buffer. The dilutions were added in triplicate and incubated for 2 h, with shaking at room temperature. After three washes with PBS containing 0.01% Tween 20, the GST-MIC2t/aldolase interaction was detected using a peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-GST antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA). Horseradish peroxidase was detected with equal volumes of substrate A/B from a BD OptEIA kit (BD Biosciences) and quenched with 2 m H2SO4, and the absorbance was read at 450 nm using an EL800 universal plate reader. The KD values were determined using the nonlinear regression Hill equation in the KaleidaGraph graphing software package (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). GST-MIC2t Fusion Protein Pulldown Assays—GST and GST-MIC2t fusion proteins were purified from the E. coli BL21 strain as described previously (23Jewett T.J. Sibley L.D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 885-894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Purified proteins were dialyzed and quantitated as described above. Washed glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added to 60 μg of GST fusion proteins and allowed to bind in PBS for 2 h at 4 °C. During binding, T. gondii strain RH tachyzoites were harvested from host monolayers and resuspended to 4 × 109 parasites/ml in 1× XB buffer. Parasites were lysed using sequential freeze-thaws in liquid nitrogen and emersion at 37 °C, followed by three sonication bursts of 15 s at setting 3 in a Fisher Model 550 Sonic Dismembrator equipped with a microtip. The insoluble fraction was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 relative centrifugal force for 11 min. After binding, the Sepharose beads were washed twice with 1× XB buffer and resuspended in buffer. The beads were incubated with either 20 μg of purified recombinant T. gondii or P. falciparum aldolase or 100 μl of soluble parasite lysate for 4 h at 4°C. Following incubation, the beads were washed five times with 1 ml of ½× XB buffer and resuspended in 1× sample buffer. Bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and examined by either Coomassie Blue staining or Western blot analysis. Immunoblotting and Antibodies—Protein samples were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, immunoblotted with peroxidase-conjugated secondary IgG antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.), and visualized with SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Rabbit anti-T. gondii aldolase polyclonal antibody (WU1614) was raised against a GST-aldolase fusion protein and reacts specifically with T. gondii aldolase. Anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibody 9E10 was purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (South San Francisco, CA). Rabbit anti-M2AP (MIC2-associated protein) polyclonal antiserum was described previously (32Huynh M.H. Opitz C. Kwok L.Y. Tomley F.M. Carruthers V.B. Soldati D. Cell. Microbiol. 2004; 6: 771-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-MIC4 polyclonal antibody was described previously (33Brecht S. Carruthers V.B. Ferguson D.J.P. Giddings O.K.

Alexa 488 (green)- and Alexa 594 (red)-conjugated secondary IgG antibodies were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Parasite Transfections—T. gondii strain RH hxgprt- tachyzoites were transfected by electroporation as described previously (31Donald R.G. Roos D.S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 91: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Transfected parasites were then allowed to invade host human foreskin fibroblast cells. Complete tissue culture medium was replaced 6 h post-transfection with complete medium containing 25 μg/ml mycophenolic acid (Sigma) and 50 μg/ml xanthine (Sigma). Parasites were grown for 18 days in the presence of drug selection prior to fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis. T. gondii strain EtM1/TgM2KO tachyzoites were transfected by electroporation as described previously (32Huynh M.H. Opitz C. Kwok L.Y. Tomley F.M. Carruthers V.B. Soldati D. Cell. Microbiol. 2004; 6: 771-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Transgenic parasites were then allowed to infect human foreskin fibroblast cells seeded onto coverslips. Tachyzoites were allowed to grow overnight and then processed for immunofluorescence microscopy. Flow Cytometry—Following 18 days of drug selection, extracellular tachyzoites were harvested from host cell monolayers and stained with anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibody 9E10 and Alexa 488-conjugated secondary antibodies. The stained parasites were examined by flow cytometry to determine the frequency of c-Myc-positive cells. Tachyzoites (1-5 × 107 parasites/ml) were fixed in PBS containing 4% formaldehyde for 30 min. Fixed parasites were simultaneously blocked and permeabilized in PBS containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.02% saponin (blocking solution) for 1 h. Anti-c-Myc epitope tag monoclonal antibody 9E10 was diluted into blocking solution and used to stain parasites for 1 h. Following incubation, parasites were washed three times with PBS containing 0.02% saponin. Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes) was diluted in blocking solution and used to stain parasites for 1 h. Parasites were then washed six times: four times with PBS containing 0.02% saponin and twice with PBS alone. Parasites were resuspended in PBS, and 1 × 105 parasites were examined using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). The number of epitope-positive parasites was determined with the CellQuest program (BD Biosciences). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—To localize epitopetagged MIC2 mutants, transiently transfected parasites were inoculated onto host cells seeded on coverslips, grown overnight, and processed for immunofluorescence. Cells were prepared for immunofluorescence as described previously (25Jewett T.J. Sibley L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 275: 9362-9369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies were diluted in blocking solution and incubated with the coverslips for 1 h. Following six washes with PBS containing 0.1 mm CaCl2, coverslips were incubated with either Alexa 488- or Alexa 594-conjugated IgG secondary antibodies diluted in blocking solution for 1 h. Following six washes with PBS containing 0.1 mm CaCl2, coverslips were rinsed in distilled H2O and mounted with VECTASHIELD containing 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Cells were examined using a Zeiss Axioplan microscope equipped with phase-contrast and epifluorescence optics. Images were obtained using a Zeiss AxioCam cooled CCD camera directed by Zeiss AxioVision software (Version 4.5), including a deconvolution package. The images were deconvolved using the inverse relation and the nearest neighbor algorithms, and the resulting images were processed using Adobe Photoshop CS (Version 8.0). The negative control parasite (EtM1/TgM2KO) images were deconvolved using the nearest neighbor algorithm and matched input compensation. T. gondii MIC2 and other members of the TRAP family containing extracellular adhesive domains are anchored in the plasma membrane by a single transmembrane domain and contain short cytoplasmic tails. The short cytoplasmic tails of T. gondii MIC2 and P. falciparum TRAP mediate a specific interaction with the glycolytic enzyme aldolase (23Jewett T.J. Sibley L.D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 885-894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that the interaction with aldolase is dependent upon the presence of an absolutely conserved tryptophan residue located 1-5 residues from the C terminus (Fig. 1) (23Jewett T.J. Sibley L.D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 885-894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 30Buscaglia C.A. Coppens I. Hol W.G. Nussenzweig V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4947-4957Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In addition to the conserved tryptophan residue, the cytoplasmic tails contain a concentration of acidic amino acid residues (Fig. 1). A closer examination of the MIC2t and other members of this family highlights the presence of two clusters of acidic residues, one proximal to the C terminus and the other more distal. The proximal and distal clusters are separated by 5 residues containing a minimum of three hydrophobic residues. In the case of MIC2, the proximal cluster contains a concentration of aspartic acids, whereas the residues distal to the C terminus are glutamic acids. In this study, we sought to determine the role of these acidic residues in the interaction with aldolase by utilizing a series of alanine point mutants tested in vitro and in vivo. The acidic residues in the MIC2t were selectively changed to alanine by PCR mutagenesis (Fig. 2A), and the wild-type and mutant forms were purified as fusion proteins with the C terminus of GST. The effect of the point mutations on the interaction with T. gondii aldolase was evaluated using a purified protein pulldown assay. Purified fusion proteins (wild-type or mutant MIC2t) or GST alone was affixed to glutathione-Sepharose beads and incubated with purified recombinant T. gondii aldolase in XB buffer. GST-MIC2t (wild-type) specifically interacted with purified aldolase, whereas GST-W767A disrupted the association, consistent with a previous report (23Jewett T.J. Sibley L.D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 885-894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). GST-D761A,D762A,D763A, GST-D765A, and GST-E769A lost the ability to interact with aldolase (Fig. 2B). GST-M766A and GST-M768A had no effect on the interaction (Fig. 2B). For GST-M766A, there was a slight increase in binding compared with GST-MIC2t. Interestingly, GST-E751A,E752A,E753A and GST-E755A, the residues of which are separated from the proximal acidic residues by the hydrophobic stretch, did not contribute to the interaction with aldolase (Fig. 2B). The high degree of conservation between the MIC2t and TRAPt led us to also investigate whether the same acidic residues important for the T. gondii aldolase interaction also participate in an association with P. falciparum aldolase. Utilizing the same MIC2t fusion proteins, the purified protein pulldown assay was repeated, replacing T. gondii aldolase with purified P. falciparum aldolase. The results mirrored those obtained with T. gondii aldolase; however, the interaction appeared weaker, as the amount of aldolase recovered by the wild-type MIC2t was less (Fig. 2C). The result of this comparative experiment indicates a conserved role during the interaction with aldolase for the acidic residues located proximal to the C terminus within the cytoplasmic tails of TRAP family proteins. To provide a more quantitative measure of binding, a quantitative ELISA was developed to monitor binding between aldolase and the MIC2t. Purified recombinant T. gondii aldolase was used to coat high affinity ELISA plates, and the plates were incubated with MIC2t fusion proteins and probed with anti-GST antibody. Binding affinities were estimated as apparent KD values (based on first-order binding kinetics estimated from a Hill plot) or as 50% of the maximum binding (Table 1). The apparent affinity estimated for GST-MIC2t (wild-type) was ∼4.0 nm. GST-W767A had an estimated binding affinity of 82.5 nm, a >20-fold increase over the wild-type fusion protein (Fig. 3). The apparent binding affinities of aldolase for the MIC2t correlated with the strength of the interaction as determined by the purified protein pulldown assay.TABLE 1Summary of mutational analysis of the acidic amino acid residues in the MIC2tMIC2tPurified protein pulldownaAs determined by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 2).Estimated KDbAs determined by quantitative ELISA (Fig. 3).50% maximum bindingcAs determined by Western blot analysis (Fig. 4).Lysate pulldowncAs determined by Western blot analysis (Fig. 4).Promoter trapdAs determined by promoter-trapping FACS analysis (Fig. 5).nmnm%Wild-typeInteraction4.004.0Interaction100E751A,E752A,E753AInteraction0.950.9Interaction3.3ePercent of promoterless c-Myc epitope-tagged wild-type MIC2.K754AInteraction0.440.7Interaction135.0E755AInteraction1.602.2Interaction4.4D761A,D762A,D763ANo interaction15.2628.0No interaction8.5S764AInteraction3.493.6Interaction72.3D765ANo interaction13.7310.0No interaction26.4M766AInteraction0.961.6Interaction65.0W767ANo interaction82.5082.0No interaction3.9M768AInteraction1.813.3Interaction176E769ANo interaction91.0089.0No Interaction1.9a As determined by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 2).b As determined by quantitative ELISA (Fig. 3).c As determined by Western blot analysis (Fig. 4).d As determined by promoter-trapping FACS analysis (Fig. 5).e Percent of promoterless c-Myc epitope-tagged wild-type MIC2.

CMP-sialic acid is transported into the lumen of the Golgi complex through the CMP-sialic acid transporter, an antiporter that also functions to transport CMP into the cytosol. We localized the transporter using immunofluorescence and deconvolution microscopy to test the prediction that it is broadly distributed across the Golgi stack to serve the many sialyltransferases involved in glycoconjugate sialylation. The transporter co-localized with ST6GalI in the medial and trans Golgi, showed partial overlap with a medial Golgi marker and little overlap with early Golgi or trans Golgi network markers. Endoplasmic reticulum-retained forms of sialyltransferases did not redistribute the transporter from the Golgi to the endoplasmic reticulum, suggesting that transporter-sialyltransferase complexes are not involved in transporter localization. Next we evaluated the role of the transporter's N- and C-terminal cytoplasmic tails in its trafficking and localization. The N-tail was not required for either endoplasmic reticulum export or Golgi localization. The C-tail was required for endoplasmic reticulum export and contained di-Ile and terminal Val motifs at its very C terminus that function as independent endoplasmic reticulum export signals. Deletion of the last four amino acids of the C-tail (IIGV) eliminated these export signals and prevented endoplasmic reticulum export of the transporter. This form of the transporter supplied limited amounts of CMP-sialic acid to Golgi sialyltransferases but was unable to completely rescue the transporter defect of Lec2 Chinese hamster ovary cells.

Finally, the overall importance of glycoconjugate sialylation is highlighted by the finding that inactivation of the UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase, a bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes the first two steps in sialic acid biosynthesis, causes early embryonic lethality in mice (22Schwarzkopf M.

The addition of sialic acid residues to terminal positions of glycan structures is catalyzed by different substrate- and linkage-specific sialyltransferases (25Harduin-Lepers A. Vallejo-Ruiz V. Krzewinski-Recchi M.A. Samyn-Petit B. Julien S. Delannoy P. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 727-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). The functional efficiency of these enzymes depends upon their ability to encounter both their glycoprotein substrates, which are made in the same or earlier compartments, and their nucleotide sugar donor, CMP-sialic acid. CMP-sialic acid is synthesized in the nucleus by CMP-sialic acid synthetase (26Coates S.W. Gurney T. Sommers L.W. Yeh M. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol.

Since CMP is an inhibitor of sialyltransferases, its rapid removal from the Golgi complex is important to optimize sialyltransferase activity (33Chiaramonte M. Koviach J.L. Moore C. Iyer V.V.

Recent studies by Tiralongo et al. (32Tiralongo J. Ashikov A. Routier F. Eckhardt M. Bakker H. Gerardy-Schahn R. von Itzstein M. Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) suggest that the CST is a simple mobile carrier with a binding site that alternates between both sides of the membrane. Genetic abnormalities in nucleotide sugar transporters, including the CST, are the basis for several developmental defects and diseases. For example, in C. elegans, mutations in the SQV7 nucleotide sugar transporter compromise chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate biosynthesis, leading to developmental defects in vulval formation (42Bulik D.A. Wei G. Toyoda H. Kinoshita-Toyoda A. Walrip W.R. Esko J.D. Robbins P.W. Selleck S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10838-10843Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 43Herman T.

In humans, mutations in nucleotide sugar transporters are responsible for some congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) in which large groups of glycans are reduced or missing, leading to multisystemic health problems that include increased infections, hypotonia, psychomotor and growth retardation, and bleeding disorders (1Freeze H.H. Aebi M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2005; 15: 490-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). For example, leukocyte adhesion deficiency II/CDG IIc is caused by defects in the GDP-fucose transporter that lead to a severe reduction in fucosylated glycans, including selectin ligands, which are important in the inflammatory response and lymphocyte homing (44Lubke T. Marquardt T. Etzioni A. Hartmann E. von Figura K. Korner C. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 45Lubke T. Marquardt T. von Figura K. Korner C. J. Biol.

More recently, a new CDG type II, initially identified in a child lacking sialyl LewisX glycans on polymorphonuclear cells, was revealed to be the result of inactivating mutations in the patient's two CST alleles (47Martinez-Duncker I. Dupre T. Piller V. Piller F. Candelier J.-J. Trichet C. Tchernia G. Oriol R. Mollicone R. Blood. 2005; 105: 2671-2676Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Sialyltransferases are found in different Golgi cisternae, reflecting their functional order in the glycosylation pathway in which they participate. The sialyltransferases modifying Asnlinked glycans of glycoproteins are localized primarily in the distal Golgi cisternae, because they are among the last enzymes to act in this pathway (24Kornfeld S. Kornfeld R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3776) Google Scholar, 48Grabenhorst E. Conradt H.S. J. Biol.

This is exemplified by the ST6Gal I enzyme that has been localized to the trans cisternae and trans reticular network (trans Golgi network (TGN)) of rat hepatocytes (49Roth J. Taatjes D.J. Lucoq J.M. Weinstein J. Paulson J.C. Cell. 1985; 43: 287-295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Our laboratory has localized this enzyme to the medial and trans cisternae of the HeLa cell Golgi (50Chen T.-L. L. Chen C. Bergeron N.Q. Close B.E. Bohrer T. Vertel B.M. Colley K.J.

In ganglioside biosynthesis, sialic acid is added both early and late in the synthetic sequence, and thus the sialyltransferases involved in this pathway are localized across the Golgi stack. The work of Maccioni and colleagues (23Maccioni H.J.F. Daniotti J.L. Martina J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1437: 101-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 51Maccioni H.J.F. Giraudo C.G.

Res. 2002; 27: 629-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) shows that the sialyltransferase responsible for the biosynthesis of the GM3 ganglioside is localized earlier in the Golgi (cis-medial) than the sialyltransferase required for the biosynthesis of the GT3 ganglioside (trans) and that a third sialyltransferase that converts GM1 to GD1 is probably found in the TGN. Most recently, work by Sewell et al. (52Sewell R. Backstrom M. Dalziel M. Gschmeissner S. Karlsson H. Noll T. Gatgens J. Clausen H. Hansson G.C. Burchell J. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. J. Biol.

Since the CST supplies CMP-sialic acid to all sialyltransferases, it seems that the exchange of CMP-sialic acid and CMP between these enzymes and the CST would be more efficient if these proteins were localized in the same Golgi subcompartments and existed as functional complexes. Previous studies demonstrated that a portion of the UDP-galactose transporter relocalizes to the ER by association with the UDP-galactose:ceramide galactosyltransferase to allow UDP-Gal import into the ER lumen for galactosyl-ceramide synthesis (53Sprong H. Degroote S. Nilsson T. Kawakita M. Ishida N. van der Sluijs P. van Meer G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3482-3493Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In this work, we have tested the hypothesis that the CST is localized across the Golgi stack in order to more efficiently supply the sialyltransferases involved in glycoprotein and glycolipid biosynthesis with CMP-sialic acid. Using immunofluorescence and deconvolution microscopy, we find that the CST is restricted to the medial-trans cisternae of the HeLa cell Golgi complex, mirroring the localization of the exogenously expressed ST6Gal I STtyr isoform. Redistribution experiments provide no evidence for physical association of either ST6Gal I STtyr isoform or ST8Sia IV polysialyltransferase with the CST, making it unlikely that sialyltransferase association is responsible for the restricted CST localization pattern or its overall Golgi localization. Studies of the sequence requirements for CST trafficking and localization showed that the CST C-terminal tail sequences contain two independent ER export signals. An ER-retained CST mutant lacking the export signals provides a limited amount of CMP-sialic acid to Golgi sialyltransferases but is unable to completely restore sialylation to Lec2 CHO cells lacking functional CST. These data suggest that although an ER-retained CST is active and CMP-sialic acid is free to diffuse throughout the ER-Golgi system, efficient sialylation occurs only when both the CST and sialyltransferases are compartmentalized in the Golgi apparatus.

Construction of the HA-tagged CST Protein—Murine CST cDNA was inserted into the pCIneo expression vector (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) using EcoRI and XbaI restriction sites. The wild type (WT) CST-pCIneo construct was used as a template to insert a hemagglutinin (HA) tag (YPYDBPDYASL) following Ser202 in the cytoplasmic loop between transmembrane helices 6 and 7.

The PCR products of all the deletion mutants were digested with restriction enzymes EcoRI and XbaI and ligated into pCIneo vector cut with the same enzymes. The sequences of the cDNAs of all of the mutants were confirmed by sequencing using the Quick Denature plasmid sequencing kit. Transfection of COS-1, HeLa, and Lec2 CHO Cells—Cells were maintained in DMEM (for COS-1 and HeLa cells) or MEM (for Lec2 CHO cells) containing 10% FBS and antibiotics and grown in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator until 50-70% confluent in 100-mm tissue culture dishes or in 24-well plates containing 12-mm glass coverslips. For COS-1 cells, Lipofectin transfections were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 30 μl of Lipofectin and 20 μg of DNA were incubated separately in 1.5 ml of Opti-MEM in polystyrene culture tubes at room temperature for 35 min. They were then mixed together and incubated for another 15 min at room temperature. The transfection mixtures were then added to cells washed with 2 × 5 ml of Opti-MEM. The cells were then incubated in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator. Seven milliliters of DMEM with 10% FBS and antibiotics was added to the plates at 6 h, and the incubation continued for another 18 h. For HeLa cells, Targefect transfection was performed following the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 1.5 μl of Targefect F-2 and 0.8 μg of DNA were incubated together in 50 μl of DMEM, 10% FBS in polystyrene culture tubes at room temperature for 20 min. The mixtures were then added to the cells on coverslips together with 450 μl of DMEM, 10% FBS. The cells were incubated in the 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator for 24 h. For Lec2 CHO cells, Fugene 6 transfection was performed following the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 3 μl of Fugene 6 was incubated in 100 μl of MEM in polystyrene culture tubes at room temperature for 5 min. Then 1.5 μg of DNA was added, and the mixture was incubated for another 30 min and added to the cells on coverslips. After cells were incubated in the 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator for 5 h, 1 ml of MEM, 10% FBS was added to cells, and the incubation continued for another 24 h. Metabolic Labeling of Cells—16-20 h following transfection, cells were incubated with 10 ml of Cys/Met-free DMEM for 1 h. After incubation, the medium was replaced with 4 ml of fresh Cys/Met-free DMEM containing 100 μCi/ml 35S-Express protein labeling mix (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cells were radiolabeled for 2 h in a 37°C, 5%CO2 incubator. After labeling, the cells were washed with 10 ml of PBS and then lysed with 1 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer 2 (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS). Cell lysates and medium samples were stored at -20 °C overnight. Immunoprecipitation of Metabolically Labeled HA-tagged CST Proteins—CST proteins were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using 3 μl of anti-HA epitope tag antibody (Sigma H9658) and 50 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose, as described previously (54Fenteany F.H. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5423-5429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitation beads were resuspended in 50 μl of Laemmli sample buffer, and the entire sample, including Sepharose beads, was directly loaded into the gel well. The proteins were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Radiolabeled proteins were visualized by fluorography using 10% 2,5-diphenyloxazole in Me2SO, and gels were exposed to Eastman Kodak Co. BioMax MR films. COS-1 cells were used for these experiments because they are easily transfected with high efficiency and yield the levels of expressed proteins required for immunoprecipitation analysis. Indirect Immunofluorescence Localization of WT and Mutant CST Proteins—HeLa cells were plated on glass coverslips and transiently transfected with the CST cDNA expression constructs, as described above. Cells were processed for immunofluorescence 24 h post-transfection, as described previously (50Chen T.-L. L. Chen C. Bergeron N.Q. Close B.E. Bohrer T. Vertel B.M. Colley K.J.

https://openalex.org/W1972560438,"Apoptin, a protein of the chicken anemia virus (CAV), represents a novel potential anticancer therapeutic, because it induces apoptotic death specifically in tumor but not normal cells. The cellular localization appears to be crucial for apoptin's selective toxicity. In normal cells apoptin remains in the cytoplasm, whereas in transformed cells it migrates into the nucleus and kills the cell. However, the manner by which apoptin is able to distinguish between tumor and normal cells is unknown. Here, we report for the first time that apoptin interacts directly with the promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) in tumor cells and accumulates in PML nuclear bodies (NBs), which are involved in apoptosis induction and viral replication. We also demonstrate that apoptin is sumoylated and that a sumoylation-deficient apoptin mutant is no longer recruited to PML-NBs, but localizes in the nuclear matrix. This mutant fails to bind PML, but can still induce apoptosis as efficiently as wild-type apoptin. Moreover, apoptin kills also PML-/- cells and promyelocytic leukemia cells with defective PML expression. Our results therefore suggest that apoptin kills tumor cells independently of PML and sumoylation, however, the interaction of apoptin with PML and small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) proteins might be relevant for CAV replication."
https://openalex.org/W2040680061,"The human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 oncoprotein Tax is a phosphoprotein with a predominately nuclear subcellular localization that accomplishes multiple functions via protein-protein interactions. It has been proposed that regulation of this protein's pleiotropic functions may be accomplished through phosphorylation of specific amino acid residues. We have conducted a phosphoryl mapping of mammalian-expressed Tax protein using a combination of affinity purification, liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, and site-directed substitution mutational analysis. We achieved physical coverage of 77% of the Tax sequence and identified four novel sites of phosphorylation at Thr-48, Thr-184, Thr-215, and Ser-336. Previously identified potential serine phosphorylation sites at Ser-10, Ser-77, and Ser-274 could not be confirmed by mass spectrometry. The functional significance of these novel phosphorylation events was evaluated by mutational analysis and subsequent evaluation for activity via both CREB and NF-κB-responsive promoters. Our results demonstrate that phosphorylation at Thr-215 is associated with loss of both Tax functions, phosphorylation at Thr-48 was specifically deficient for activation via NF-κB, and phosphorylation at Thr-184 and Ser-336 had no effect on these Tax functions. Semiquantitation of phosphopeptides revealed that the majority of Tax was phosphorylated at Thr-48, Thr-184, Thr-215, and Ser-336, whereas only a minor population of Tax was phosphorylated at either Ser-300 or Ser-301. These results suggest that both positive and negative phosphorylation signals result in the maintenance of a subfraction of Tax as active protein."

We explored these hypotheses by introducing a variety of substitutions in region 17–31 of PTH-(1–31) and assessing, via competition assays, their effects on binding to the wild-type PTHR and to PTHR-delNt, which lacks most of the N domain. Substitutions at Arg20 reduced affinity for the intact PTHR by 200-fold or more, but altered affinity for PTHR-delNt by 4-fold or less. Similar effects were observed for Glu substitutions at Trp23, Leu24, and Leu28, which together form the hydrophobic face of the predicted amphiphilic α-helix. Glu substitutions at Arg25, Lys26, and Lys27 (which forms the hydrophilic face of the helix) caused 4–10-fold reductions in affinity for both receptors. Thus, the side chains of Arg20, together with those composing the hydrophobic face of the ligand's putative amphiphilic α-helix, contribute strongly to PTHR-binding affinity by interacting specifically with the N domain of the receptor. The side chains projecting from the opposite helical face contribute weakly to binding affinity by different mechanisms, possibly involving interactions with the extracellular loop/transmembrane domain region of the receptor.

PTH interacts with a Class 2 G protein-coupled receptor that is prominently expressed in bone osteoblasts and in cells located in the proximal and distal portions of the renal convoluted tubules. The PTH receptor (PTHR) is also expressed in the primordia of developing long bones, heart, mammary glands, and other tissues, where it mediates the morphogenic actions of PTH-related protein (PTHrP) (1Strewler G.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 342: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). For both PTH and PTHrP, the bioactive portions of the molecule reside within the first 34 amino acids of the processed polypeptides. Within region 1–34, the principal determinants of receptor-binding affinity and receptor-signaling activity map to the C- and N-terminal domains, respectively (2Tregear G.W. Van Rietschoten J.

The mechanism by which PTH interacts with its receptor has been investigated via the approaches of ligand analog design, receptor mutagenesis, and photochemical cross-linking (reviewed in Ref. 12Gensure R.C. Gardella T.J. Jüppner H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 328: 666-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The view that has emerged from these studies is that the overall mechanism consists of two principal and, to some extent, autonomous components: 1) an interaction between the C-terminal helical domain of the ligand and the N-terminal extracellular domain (N domain; spanning Tyr23 to approximately Ile190) of the mature receptor and 2) an interaction between the N-terminal portion of the ligand and the juxtamembrane domain (J domain) of the receptor containing the extracellular loops and seven transmembrane helices. The N domain component of the interaction is thought to provide the major portion of binding energy and stability to the complex, and the J domain component is thought to mediate the conformational changes involved in receptor activation (13Hoare S.R.J. Gardella T.J. Usdin T.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7741-7753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). It now seems likely that most, if not all, of the 15 or so other Class 2 G protein-coupled receptors utilize a similar two-site binding mechanism for interacting with their cognate peptide ligands (14Tan Y.V.

Consistent with such a two-site binding mechanism for PTH and the PTHR, we have shown that N-terminal PTH peptide fragments, such as PTH-(1–14), bind only extremely weakly to the receptor, but can nevertheless induce at least measurable increases in cAMP levels in PTHR-expressing cells (17Luck M.D. Carter P.H. Gardella T.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 670-680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The potency of such N-terminal PTH fragments can be significantly enhanced by introducing substitutions that improve the affinity of the ligand for the PTHR J domain (18Dean T. Linglart A. Mahon M.J.

Thus, the analog [Aib1,3,Gln10,Har11,Trp14]PTH-(1–14)-NH2 is equipotent to PTH-(1–34) in stimulating cAMP as well as inositol phosphate (IP) production in PTHR-expressing cells. Moreover, such optimized N-terminal PTH analogs retain full potency in cells expressing PTHR-delNt, a PTHR construct that lacks most (Ala24–Arg181) of the N domain, whereas unmodified PTH-(1–34) exhibits at least 100-fold reductions in potency and affinity for PTHR-delNt compared with its actions on the intact PTHR (18Dean T.

The large reduction in affinity/potency that unmodified PTH-(1–34) exhibits for PTHR-delNt can be attributed, according to the two-site interaction model, to the loss of the binding interactions that normally occur between the C-terminal helical domain of the ligand and the N domain of the receptor. The cross-linking approach has indeed established spatial proximities between PTH residues 23, 27, and 28, when substituted with para-benzoyl-l-phenylalanine (Bpa), and the N domain of the receptor (21Mannstadt M.

On the other hand, [Lys27(Bp)2]PTH-(1–34)-NH2, which contains the photoreactive Bp moiety attached to the Lys27 side chain amino groups, was shown to cross-link to the first extracellular loop of the PTHR (23Greenberg Z. Bisello A. Mierke D.F. Rosenblatt M. Chorev M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8142-8152Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This observation raised the possibility that the C-terminal binding domain of PTH can functionally interact with the receptor J domain. Consistent with this possibility, we recently showed that methylation of several backbone nitrogen atoms in region 17–31 of PTH-(1–31) impairs, albeit modestly, the capacity of the ligand to stimulate cAMP formation in cells expressing PTHR-delNt (8Barbier J.-R.

Taken together, these observations point to the uncertainty that exists in our understanding of the specific mechanisms by which the C-terminal domain of PTH contributes to the PTHR-binding process. This study was undertaken to examine further the mode of action used by the C-terminal binding domain of PTH. We sought to address the roles that the side chains in this domain play in the PTHR-binding process, the general functional importance of amphiphilicity, and the potential for binding interactions with the receptor J domain. Our strategy was to introduce a variety of conservative and non-conservative substitutions in region 17–31 of PTH-(1–31)-NH2 and to assess their effects on binding to the intact PTHR and to PTHR-delNt. The overall results indicate a dominant role for specific interactions between side chains on the hydrophobic face of the C-terminal helix and the receptor N-terminal domain. They also provide evidence for weak interactions between side chains projecting from the hydrophilic face of the helix and the PTHR J domain. The data also shed new light on the overall topology of the bimolecular complex, as they support folding of the bound ligand and proximity of the binding sites in the N and J domains of the receptor. Peptide Synthesis—Peptides were based on the human PTH-(1–31)-NH2 sequence (SVSEIQLMHNLGKHLNSMERVEWLRKKLQDV-NH2). The alanine substitutions were incorporated into this otherwise unmodified PTH-(1–31)-NH2 scaffold. Subsequently, cyclohexylalanine (Cha) and Glu substitutions were incorporated into the [Ala1,Arg19]PTH-(1–31)-NH2 scaffold, which, because of the Ser1 → Ala and Glu19 → Arg substitutions, exhibits improved affinity for PTHR-delNt (19Shimizu M.

Potts Jr., J.T. Gardella T.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13224-13233Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These Ala-, Cha-, and Glu-substituted PTH-(1–31)-NH2 and [Ala1,Arg19]PTH-(1–31)-NH2 peptides and their corresponding parental controls were synthesized by the Massachusetts General Hospital Biopolymer Core facility using conventional methodologies as we described previously (20Shimizu N. Guo J. Gardella T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49003-49012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Additional analogs of PTH-(1–31)-NH2 with substitutions at position 20 were prepared as part of a previous study (25Barbier J.-R. MacLean S. Whitfield J.F. Morley P. Willick G.E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8955-8961Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). All peptides were verified by analytical HPLC, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry, and amino acid analysis, and peptide concentrations of stock solutions were established by amino acid analysis. The radioligands 125I-[Nle8,21,Tyr34]rPTH-(1–34)-NH2 and 125I-[Aib1,3,Nle8,Gln10,Har11,Ala12,Trp14,Tyr15]rPTH-(1–15)-NH2 (henceforth referred to as 125I-[Aib1,3,M]rPTH-(1–15)-NH2) were prepared by the oxidative chloramine-T procedure using Na125I (specific activity of 2200 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and purified by reversed-phase HPLC. Circular Dichroism—CD spectra were obtained on a Jasco J-600 spectropolarimeter at 20 °C. Four spectra were averaged, and the data were smoothed by the Jasco software. The instrument was calibrated with ammonium (+)-10-camphorsulfonate. Data are expressed as the number of helical residues/peptide chain as calculated from –[θ]222 × 30/28,000, where [θ]222 is the mean residue ellipticity at 222 nm, as we described previously (8Barbier J.-R.

Cell Culture—Cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan UT), 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate (Invitrogen). For binding and cAMP experiments performed with the intact PTHR, the HKRK-B7 and ROS 17/2.8 cell lines were used. HKRK-B7 cells are derived from the porcine kidney cell line LLC-PK1 and express, via stable DNA transfection, the wild-type human PTHR at an approximate surface density of 950,000 PTH-binding sites/cell (26Takasu H. Guo J. Bringhurst F. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). ROS 17/2.8 cells are rat osteosarcoma cells and express the endogenous PTHR at an approximate surface density of 70,000 PTH-binding sites/cell (27Yamamoto I. Shigeno C. Potts Jr., J.T. Segre G.V. Endocrinology. 1988; 122: 1208-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The cells were plated and assayed in 24-well plates. PTHR-delNt was derived from the human PTHR by site-directed mutagenesis and lacks most (Ala24–Arg181) of the N domain (28Shimizu M. Carter P.H. Khatri A. Potts Jr., J.T. Gardella T.J. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 3068-3074Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). PTHR-delNt was expressed in COS-7 cells via transient DNA transfection. For binding assays, cell membranes were prepared from the transfected COS-7 cells. To increase the maximum binding of 125I-[Aib1,3,M]rPTH-(1–15)-NH2 to PTHR-delNt in these membranes, the cells were cotransfected with a negative-dominant mutant Gαs protein (Gαs(α3β5/Gly226 → Ala/Ala366 → Ser); hereafter referred to as GαsND). This mutant Gαs subunit is thought to couple to cognate receptors, and thus stabilize high affinity receptor conformations more efficiently than does wild-type Gαs without increasing basal cAMP levels (29Berlot C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21080-21085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We recently used a precursor of this Gαs mutant, Gαs(α3β5), to increase the binding of 125I-[Aib1,3,M]rPTH-(1–15)-NH2 to PTHR-delNt in COS-7 cell membranes (18Dean T. Linglart A. Mahon M.J. Bastepe M. Jüppner H. Potts Jr., J.T. Gardella T.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 20: 931-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We subsequently found that GαsND, which contains the same five-amino acid replacement of the corresponding Gαi residues in the α3β5 loop as does Gαs(α3β5) plus the point mutations Gly226 → Ala, which increases affinity for Gβ/γ, and Ala366 → Ser, which decreases affinity for GDP (29Berlot C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21080-21085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), yielded ∼2-fold higher levels of specific binding of 125I-[Aib1,3,M]rPTH-(1–15)-NH2 than did Gαs(α3β5) (data not shown). The COS-7 cells were cotransfected in 6-well plates using plasmid DNA encoding PTHR-delNt (1 μg/well), plasmid DNA encoding GαsND (1 μg/well), and FuGENE 6 reagent (6 μl/well; Roche Diagnostics). Control experiments were performed with COS-7 cells similarly cotransfected with GαsND and the wild-type PTHR. Cells were harvested 3 days after transfection, and membranes were prepared as described (18Dean T. Linglart A. Mahon M.J. Bastepe M. Jüppner H. Potts Jr., J.T. Gardella T.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 20: 931-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Receptor Binding—Binding to the intact PTHR in HKRK-B7 and ROS 17/2.8 cells was assessed using 125I-[Nle8,21, Tyr34]rPTH-(1–34)-NH2 as a tracer radioligand as described (28Shimizu M. Carter P.H. Khatri A. Potts Jr., J.T. Gardella T.J. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 3068-3074Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In brief, confluent cells in 24-well plates (∼500,000 cells/well) were incubated in binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 5% heat-inactivated horse serum, 0.5% fetal bovine serum, adjusted to pH 7.7 with HCl) containing radioligand (∼100,000 cpm/well) with or without unlabeled peptide ligand (3 × 10–9 to 1 × 10–5 m) for 4 h at 15 °C. The binding mixture was then removed by aspiration' the cells were rinsed three times with binding buffer and lysed in 1 m NaOH; and the entire lysate was counted for γ-irradiation in a γ-counter. Binding to PTHR-delNt in COS-7 cell membranes was assessed in 96-well vacuum filtration plates (Multi-Screen-HV Durapore, 0.65-μm membranes; Millipore Corp.) using 125I-[Aib1,3,M]rPTH-(1–15)-NH2 as a tracer radioligand as described (18Dean T. Linglart A. Mahon M.J. Bastepe M. Jüppner H. Potts Jr., J.T. Gardella T.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 20: 931-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In brief, cell membranes (20 μg/well) were incubated in membrane binding buffer containing radioligand (∼30,000 cpm/well) with or without unlabeled peptide ligand (3 × 10–9 to 1 × 10–5 m) for 90 min at 21 °C (reaction volume of 200 μl). The plates were then subjected to rapid vacuum filtration, and the filters were washed once with buffer, airdried, detached from the plate, and counted for γ-irradiation in a γ-counter. Nonspecific binding was defined as the binding observed in the presence of 1 × 10–6 m PTH-(1–31)-NH2 for HKRK-B7 and ROS 17/2.8 cells and of 1 × 10–6 m [Aib1,3,M]rPTH-(1–15)-NH2 for PTHR-delNt. Specifically bound radioactivity was calculated as a percentage of the radioactivity specifically bound in the absence of competing ligand. Stimulation of Intracellular cAMP and IP—The capacities of the ligands to stimulate formation of cAMP were assessed in intact ROS 17/2.8 cells, as described (28Shimizu M. Carter P.H. Khatri A. Potts Jr., J.T. Gardella T.J. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 3068-3074Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In brief, cells in 24-well plates were incubated in binding buffer containing the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (2 mm) with or without a peptide ligand (3 × 10–11 to 1 × 10–6 m) for 30 min at room temperature. The medium was then removed, and the cells were lysed by adding 50 mm HCl and freezing the plate on dry ice. The cAMP in the thawed lysate was quantified by radioimmunoassay. The stimulation of production of inositol phosphates (IP1 + IP2 + IP3) was assessed in COS-7 cells transfected with the intact human PTHR as we described previously (28Shimizu M. Carter P.H. Khatri A. Potts Jr., J.T. Gardella T.J. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 3068-3074Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In brief, intact transfected COS-7 cells in 24-well plates were labeled with myo-[3H]inositol (specific activity of 25 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 16 h. The labeled cells were then treated for 30 min with ligand in the presence of LiCl2 (30 mm), and the medium was removed and replaced with ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (5%). After 2 h on ice, the acid lysates were extracted with ether and processed by ion-exchange chromatography (0.5-ml resin bed), and the ammonium formate-eluted [3H]inositol phosphates were quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Data and Statistical Calculations—Binding and cAMP data were processed for curve fitting and derivation of IC50 and EC50 values using least-squares nonlinear regression analysis and the following equation: y = ymin + (ymax–ymin/1 + (IC50/x)n, where y, ymin, and ymax are the observed, minimum, and maximum response values, respectively; x is the ligand concentration; and n is the slope factor. In cases in which incomplete inhibition of binding occurred, e.g. with certain PTH-(1–31)-NH2 analogs binding to PTHR-delNt, the curves were extrapolated to nonspecific binding. Paired data sets were statistically compared using a two-tailed Student's t test, assuming unequal variance for the two sets. Alanine Scan of Region 17–31 of PTH—We first individually replaced each residue in region 17–31 of PTH-(1–31)-NH2 with alanine and assessed the effects of the substitutions on binding to the intact human PTHR stably expressed in HKRK-B7 cells. Binding was assessed by competition methods using 125I-[Nle8,21,Tyr34]rPTH-(1–34)-NH2 as a tracer radioligand. The parental PTH-(1–31)-NH2 peptide fully inhibited the binding of this tracer with an IC50 of 68 ± 10 nm (Fig. 1A and Table 1). The various alanine substitutions had a range of effects on this binding. Most dramatic was that of the Arg20 → Ala substitution, which abolished detectable binding (Fig. 1A). The alanine substitutions at Trp23 and Leu24 reduced the apparent binding affinity by 19- and 12-fold, respectively, relative to the parental peptide (p < 0.05). The alanine substitutions at Val21, Arg25, Lys27, Leu28, and Val31 reduced affinity by ∼3-fold, and the remaining alanine substitutions altered affinity by 2-fold or less (Fig. 1, A and B; and Table 1). The alanine substitutions at Glu19, Glu22, and Gln29 each produced a small (≤2-fold) enhancement of the apparent binding affinity, as did the Glu19 → Arg substitution, which we have shown previously to enhance cAMP-stimulating potency in PTH-(1–34) and PTH-(1–20) peptides (24Shimizu M. Shimizu N. Tsang J.C. Petroni B.D. Khatri A. Potts Jr., J.T. Gardella T.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13224-13233Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The Ala22 substitution was thus paired with Ala19 as well as with Arg19, but neither pairing improved affinity further relative to the single substitutions alone (Table 1).TABLE 1Helical contents and PTHR-binding properties of PTH-(1–31)-NH2 analogsCD helical residuesIC50PTHR-WT (HKRK-B7 cells)PTHR-delNt (COS-7 cells)mmnmPTH-(1-31)-NH2868 ± 10 (23)3666 ± 431 (13)Ser17 → Ala1057 ± 12 (4)4678 ± 386 (4)Met18 → Ala1092 ± 14 (3)8799 ± 2334 (4)Glu19 → Ala949 ± 11 (4)2940 ± 833 (4)Arg20 → Ala10>10,000 (3)19,343 ± 8100 (4)Val21 → Ala10200 ± 18 (3)5686 ± 486 (4)Glu22 → Ala936 ± 2 (4)5857 ± 2237 (4)Trp23 → Ala71312 ± 139 (3)7357 ± 1832 (4)Leu24 → Ala7807 ± 165 (3)8764 ± 1167 (4)Arg25 → Ala7281 ± 67 (3)7177 ± 1083 (4)Lys26 → Ala7125 ± 8 (3)6210 ± 948 (4)Lys27 → Ala9217 ± 7 (3)7288 ± 615 (4)Leu28 → Ala8290 ± 63 (3)3459 ± 482 (4)Gln29 → Ala944 ± 11 (3)1931 ± 303 (4)Asp30 → Ala1063 ± 7 (4)1545 ± 215 (4)Val31 → Ala9176 ± 23 (4)4911 ± 1341 (4)Glu19 → Ala/Glu22 → Ala949 ± 9 (4)619 ± 75 (4)Glu19 → Arg/Glu22 → Arg854 ± 13 (4)360 ± 19 (4)Glu19 → Arg842 ± 6 (4)1226 ± 332 (4)Arg20 → Gln7>10,000 (3)10,284 ± 121 (3)Arg20 → Glu7>10,000 (3)14,747 ± 324 (3)Arg20 → Lys8>10,000 (3)7105 ± 1275 (3)Arg20 → Nle1215,404 ± 2334 (4)10,688 ± 1033 (3)Arg20 → Cit911,925 ± 2151 (4)10,624 ± 1612 (3)Arg20 → Orn6>10,000 (4)5530 ± 279 (3)Arg20 → ApaND>10,000 (3)5740 ± 775 (3)Arg20 → GphND>10,000 (3)2047 ± 442 (3)Arg20 → PipGly814135 ± 5345 (4)6605 ± 2407 (5)[Aib1,3,M]rPTH-(1-15)-NH2NDND2.2 ± 0.5 (8) Open table in a new tab We then assessed the effects of the alanine substitutions on binding to PTHR-delNt. For these experiments, we used membranes prepared from COS-7 cells transiently transfected with PTHR-delNt. As a tracer radioligand, we used 125I-[Aib1,3,M]rPTH-(1–15)-NH2, which we have shown binds exclusively to the PTHR J domain (30Shimizu N. Dean T. Tsang J.C. Khatri A. Potts Jr., J.T. Gardella T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1797-1807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To increase the total specific binding of 125I-[Aib1,3,M]rPTH-(1–15)-NH2 to these membranes, the cells were cotransfected with a negative-dominant mutant Gαs subunit (GαsND), which promotes ligand binding presumably by stabilizing high affinity receptor conformations (29Berlot C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21080-21085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Unlabeled [Aib1,3,M]rPTH-(1–15)-NH2 (used as a control peptide) fully inhibited the binding of 125I-[Aib1,3,M]rPTH-(1–15)-NH2 to these membranes with high apparent affinity (IC50 = 2.2 ± 0.5 nm) (Fig. 1, C and D; and Table 1). As expected from the absence of ligand interactions with the PTHR N domain, unmodified PTH-(1–31)-NH2 bound to PTHR-delNt with relatively low affinity (IC50 = 3700 ± 400 nm) (Fig. 1, C and D; and Table 1). This binding was nevertheless sufficient to assess the effects of the alanine substitutions on the capacity of the ligand to interact with PTHR-delNt. None of the alanine substitutions altered binding to PTHR-delNt by >5-fold, including the Arg20 → Ala substitution, which had strongly diminished binding to the intact PTHR (Fig. 1, A versus C). Similarly, the Ala substitutions at Trp23 and Leu24, which reduced affinity for the PTHR by 19- and 12-fold, respectively, reduced affinity for PTHR-delNt by only ∼2-fold. These findings indicate that the mechanisms by which the Ala substitutions at Arg20, Trp23, and Leu24 impair binding to the intact PTHR are largely independent of interactions with the PTHR J domain. None of the alanine substitutions had a major impact on the secondary structure of the peptide as revealed by CD spectroscopy analysis. Thus, the CD spectrum of each analog exhibited clear negative deflections in the regions at 209 and 222 nm, which are indicative of α-helical structure (Fig. 2). The number of helical resides/peptide chain (calculated from the CD sign"
https://openalex.org/W2049485403,"E2F factors modulate a plethora of cell functions, including proliferation, differentiation, DNA repair and apoptosis. We have shown that differentiation in primary epidermal keratinocytes leads to E2F1 downregulation via activation of protein kinase C and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. We now demonstrate that E2F1 downregulation in differentiating keratinocytes involves its ubiquitination, as well as proteasomal degradation subsequent to CRM1-dependent nuclear export. E2F1 nuclear export specifically in response to differentiation requires regions adjacent to the cyclin A-binding domain in the N-terminus of this protein. Significantly, inhibition of p38 interferes with nuclear export and degradation of E2F1 during differentiation, but has no effect on E2F1 in undifferentiated cells. Thus, induction of differentiation in epidermal keratinocytes activates a specific program for post-transcriptional downregulation of E2F1, which involves signaling through p38 and activation of nuclear export pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1997038002,"The serine/threonine kinases Akt1/PKBα, Akt2/PKBβ, and Akt3/PKBγ have been implicated in preventing cells from undergoing apoptosis. Although several small molecule inhibitors of Akt have been reported to induce apoptosis in cancer cells, these inhibitors may have additional targets. In the current study, we used an Akt3 small interfering RNA (Akt3 siRNA) to analyze apoptosis induction in Akt1 and Akt2 double knock-out mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (MEF-Akt1,2-DKO). Our data indicated that Akt3 siRNA inhibited Akt3 protein expression in a dose-dependent manner. As a result, phosphorylation of Akt and its downstream targets, including FKHRL1 and GSK3α/β, were reduced accordingly. The treatment also induced apoptosis in MEF-Akt1,2-DKO cells. However, apoptosis induction is significant only when more than 80% of Akt3 protein was depleted. Reintroducing Akt3 totally rescued Akt3-siRNA-induced apoptosis in MEF-Akt1,2-DKO cells. In addition, reintroducing Akt1 also inhibited apoptosis induced by Akt3 siRNA. Moreover, Akt3 siRNA potentiated different stress-induced apoptosis in MEF-Akt1,2-DKO cells at a lower dose when compared with what is required for apoptosis induction by itself. Our study suggests that only a small portion of Akt is active in wild-type MEF cells and a threshold of Akt inhibition is required to induce apoptosis by pure Akt inhibitors. In addition, our data indicate that cells under stress require more Akt for its survival."
https://openalex.org/W2049275438,"Abstract Dolichol kinase (DK) catalyzes the CTP-dependent phosphorylation of dolichol in the biosynthesis de novo and possibly the recycling of dolichyl monophosphate in yeast and mammals. A cDNA clone from human brain encoding the mammalian homologue, hDKp, of the yeast enzyme has recently been identified. In this study hDK has been overexpressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells and shown to be a polytopic membrane protein localized in the endoplasmic reticulum with an N terminus extended into the lumen and a cytoplasmically oriented C terminus. A conserved sequence, DXXAXXXGXXXGX8KKTXEG, found in several enzymes utilizing CTP as substrate including DKs, phytol kinases, and several CDP-diacylglycerol synthetases has been identified, and the possibility that it is part of the CTP-binding domain of hDKp has been investigated. Topological studies indicate that the loop between transmembrane domains (TMD) 11 and TMD12 of hDKp, containing the putative CTP binding domain, faces the cytoplasm. Deletion of the loop between TMD11-12, hDK(Δ459-474), or mutation of selected conserved residues within the cytoplasmic loop results in either a partial or total loss of activity and significant reductions in the affinity for CTP. In addition, the SEC59 gene in the yeast DK mutant was sequenced, and a G420D substitution was found. Conversion of the corresponding residue Gly-443 in hDKp to aspartic acid resulted in inactivation of the mammalian enzyme. These results extend the information on the topological arrangement of hDKp and indicate that the cytoplasmic loop between TMDs 11-12, containing the critical conserved residues, lysine 470 and lysine 471 in the 470KKTXEG475 motif, is part of the CTP-binding site in hDK."
https://openalex.org/W2055123042,"The Wilms' tumour suppressor gene, WT1, encodes a zinc-finger protein that is mutated in Wilms' tumours and highly expressed in a wide variety of other malignancies. WT1 is a transcription factor that is likely to have additional, post-transcriptional, regulatory roles, although the molecular mechanisms by which WT1 acts remain poorly understood. We have combined genetic and biochemical approaches to show, that endogenous WT1 binds to heterogeneous nuclear ribonuclear protein U (hnRNP-U), that this interaction does not require any other proteins or nucleic acids, involves the zinc-fingers of WT1 and the middle domain of hnRNP-U, and that hnRNP-U can modulate WT1 transcriptional activation of a bona fide WT1 target gene. These findings increase our knowledge of how WT1 exerts its transcriptional regulatory role and suggests that hnRNP-U may be a candidate Wilms' tumour gene at 1q44."
https://openalex.org/W2058585682,"Rad23 proteins function in both DNA repair and protein stability regulation. As ubiquitinated forms of p53 are stabilized after DNA damage in concert with p53 functional activation, and human Rad23 proteins (hHR23A and B) regulate p53 stability in unstressed cells, the role of hHR23B in post-genotoxin regulation of p53 was investigated. Depletion of hHR23B by specific short interfering RNA before genotoxic exposure attenuated p53, p21 and bax induction, abrogated the accumulation of ubiquitinated p53 and suppressed apoptosis. Expression of ubiquitin derivatives with all lysines mutated except K48 or K63 demonstrated that K48-linked p53-ubiquitin conjugates were specifically induced after DNA damage. hHR23B, along with native and ubiquitinated p53, accumulated in chromatin after genotoxic exposure, and the accumulation of ubiquitinated p53 in chromatin was prevented by hHR23B depletion. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that hHR23B and p53 both localized to the p21 promoter shortly after DNA damage. hHR23B thus plays a critical role in the activation and function of p53 after specific genotoxic exposures."
https://openalex.org/W2084092423,"The human reduced folate carrier (hRFC) facilitates membrane transport of folates and antifolates. hRFC is characterized by 12 transmembrane domains (TMDs). To identify residues or domains involved in folate binding, we used substituted cysteine (Cys) accessibility methods (SCAM) with sodium (2-sulfonatoethyl)methanethiosulfonate (MTSES). We previously showed that residues in TMD11 of hRFC were involved in substrate binding, whereas those in TMD12 were not (Hou, Z., Stapels, S. E., Haska, C. L., and Matherly, L. H. (2005) J. Biol. Chem. 280, 36206-36213). In this study, 232 Cys-substituted mutants spanning TMDs 1-10 and conserved stretches within the TMD6-7 (residues 204-217) and TMD10-11 connecting loop domains were transiently expressed in hRFC-null HeLa cells. All Cys-substituted mutants showed moderate to high levels of expression on Western blots, and only nine mutants including R133C, I134C, A135C, Y136C, S138C, G163C, Y281C, R373C, and S313C were inactive for methotrexate transport. MTSES did not inhibit transport by any of the mutants in TMDs 1, 3, 6, and 9 or for positions 204-217. Whereas most of the mutants in TMDs 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 10, and in the TMD10-11 connecting loop were insensitive to MTSES, this reagent inhibited methotrexate transport (25-75%) by 26 mutants in these TMDs. For 13 of these (Y126C, S137C, V160C, S168C, W274C, S278C, V284C, V288C, A311C, T314C, Y376C, Q377C, and V380C), inhibition was prevented by leucovorin, another hRFC substrate. Combined with our previous findings, these results implicate amino acids in TMDs 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 11, but not in TMDs 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, or 12, as important structural or functional components of the putative hydrophilic cavity for binding of anionic folate substrates. The human reduced folate carrier (hRFC) facilitates membrane transport of folates and antifolates. hRFC is characterized by 12 transmembrane domains (TMDs).

In this study, 232 Cys-substituted mutants spanning TMDs 1-10 and conserved stretches within the TMD6-7 (residues 204-217) and TMD10-11 connecting loop domains were transiently expressed in hRFC-null HeLa cells. All Cys-substituted mutants showed moderate to high levels of expression on Western blots, and only nine mutants including R133C, I134C, A135C, Y136C, S138C, G163C, Y281C, R373C, and S313C were inactive for methotrexate transport. MTSES did not inhibit transport by any of the mutants in TMDs 1, 3, 6, and 9 or for positions 204-217. Whereas most of the mutants in TMDs 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 10, and in the TMD10-11 connecting loop were insensitive to MTSES, this reagent inhibited methotrexate transport (25-75%) by 26 mutants in these TMDs. For 13 of these (Y126C, S137C, V160C, S168C, W274C, S278C, V284C, V288C, A311C, T314C, Y376C, Q377C, and V380C), inhibition was prevented by leucovorin, another hRFC substrate. Combined with our previous findings, these results implicate amino acids in TMDs 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 11, but not in TMDs 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, or 12, as important structural or functional components of the putative hydrophilic cavity for binding of anionic folate substrates. Folic acid is the fully oxidized monoglutamyl form of the water-soluble vitamin that is used in dietary supplements and in fortified foods. In cells and tissues, folic acid is converted to coenzyme forms required in one-carbon transfer reactions involved in the biosynthesis of nucleotides and the amino acids, serine and methionine (1Stokstad E.L.R. Picciano M.F. Stokstad E.L.R. Greogory J.F. Folic Acid Metabolism in Health and Disease. Wiley-Liss, New York1990: 1-21Google Scholar). Thus, folates are critical for cell proliferation and tissue regeneration. Further, folic acid supplementation has been credited with providing a beneficial role in preventing a range of disorders, including cardiovascular disease, neural tube defects, and cancer (2Lucock M. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2000; 71: 121-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 3Bailey L.B. Rampersaud G.C. Kauwell G.P. J. Nutr. 2003; 133: 1961-1968Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because folates cannot be synthesized de novo in mammalian cells, external dietary sources are essential. Reflecting their anionic character, the natural folates show only a minimal capacity to cross biological membranes by diffusion alone. Accordingly, sophisticated membrane transport systems have evolved to facilitate uptake of folate cofactors by mammalian cells and tissues, of which the ubiquitously expressed reduced folate carrier (RFC) 2The abbreviations used are: RFC, reduced folate carrier; Mtx, methotrexate; hRFC, human RFC; TMD, transmembrane domain; SCAM, substituted cysteine accessibility methods; leucovorin, (6R,S)-5-CHO-H4PteGlu; MTSES, sodium (2-sulfonatoethyl)methanethiosulfonate; MFS, major facilitator superfamily; LacY, lactose/proton symporter; GlpT, inorganic phosphate/glycerol 3-phosphate antiporter. (4Whetstine J.R. Flatley R.M. Matherly L.H. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 629-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) appears to predominate (5Matherly L.H. Goldman I.D. Vitam. Horm. 2003; 66: 403-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). RFC levels are also important determinants of the anti-tumor activities of chemotherapy drugs such as methotrexate (Mtx) and the newer antifolates, pemetrexed (Alimta) and raltitrexed (Tomudex). Moreover, loss of RFC activity is a common mechanism of antifolate resistance both in vitro and in vivo (6Goldman I.D. Matherly L.H. Pharmacol. Ther. 1985; 28: 77-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 7Goldman I.D. Zhao R. Semin. Oncol. 2002; 29: 3-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In clinical studies, low levels of human RFC (hRFC) transcripts accompanied impaired Mtx transport and a poor prognosis in primary osteosarcomas (8Guo W. Healey J.H. Meyers P.A. Ladanyi M. Huvos A.G. Bertino J.R. Gorlick R. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 621-627PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, in a recent case-control study of primary specimens from children diagnosed with B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia, low levels of hRFC correlated with treatment failure (9Ge Y. Haska C. LaFiura K. Devidas M. Linda S.B. Taub J.W. Matherly L.H. Abstracts, American Association for Cancer Research. 2006; 47: 1015Google Scholar). hRFC belongs to the major facilitator superfamily (MFS), the largest group of ion-coupled transporters (10Saier M.H. Beatty J.T. Goffeau A. Harley K.T. Heijne W.H.M. Huang S. Jack D.L. Jahn P.S. Lew K. Liu J. Pao S.S. Paulsen L.T. Tseng T. Virk P.S. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1999; 1: 257-279PubMed Google Scholar). MFS proteins generally contain 400-600 amino acids and a symmetrical structure composed of two halves, each including six transmembrane segments connected by a large hydrophilic loop with cytosolic N and C termini (Fig. 1 is a schematic of hRFC topology that conforms to this structure). Structural insights into this family of transporters have been fostered by reports in 2003 of high resolution crystal structures of the lactose/proton symporter (LacY) (11Abramson J. Smirnova I. Kasho V. Verner G. Kaback H.R. Iwata S. Science. 2003; 301: 610-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (1228) Google Scholar) and the inorganic phosphate/glycerol 3-phosphate antiporter (GlpT) (12Huang Y. Lemieux M.J. Song J. Auer M. Wang D.N. Science. 2003; 301: 616-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). Mechanistic studies of RFC have focused on the identification of key structural or functional domains and/or amino acids. Thus, removal of 27 N-terminal or 139 C-terminal amino acids from hRFC had only a modest effect on surface targeting or transport function (13Marchant J.S. Subramanian V.S. Parker I. Said H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33325-33333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Deletions of 49 or 60 amino acids from the TMD6-7 linker domain completely abolished transport activity (14Liu X.Y. Witt T.L. Matherly L.H. Biochem. J. 2002; 369: 31-37Crossref Google Scholar). However, replacement of the deleted segments with nonhomologous 73- or 84-amino acid segments of the structurally analogous thiamine transporter, SLC19A2, restored transport, although maximal activity had an absolute requirement for the conserved 204-214 peptide. From mutant studies, highly conserved amino acids in or flanking the TMDs including Gly-44, Glu-45, Ser-46, Ile-48, Asp-88, Val-106, Trp-107, Ser-127, Ala-132, Arg-133, Ser-313, Arg-373, and Lys-411 were implicated as functionally or structurally important (the numbers refer to the positions in the hRFC molecule) (15Wong S.C.

Most recently, by co-expression and N-hydroxysuccinimide Mtx radioaffinity labeling of hRFC TMD1-6 and TMD7-12 half-molecules combined with 2-nitro-5-thiocyanatobenzoic acid cleavage adjacent to cysteine residues, a substrate binding region was localized to between amino acids 394 and 457, corresponding to TMDs 11 and 12 (30Hou Z. Stapels S.E. Haska C.L. Matherly L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36206-36213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis results have been corroborated by those with “substituted cysteine accessibility methods” or SCAM (31Akabas M. Stauffer D. Xu M. Karlin A. Science. 1992; 258: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 32Xu M. Akabas M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 107: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 33Wilson G. Karlin A.

FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1281-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). In our SCAM studies with hRFC, cysteines were inserted into a “cysteine-less” hRFC template, and functional cysteine mutants were expressed in RFC-null cells. Substrate binding domains were localized to positions flanking TMD1 and within TMD11 by monitoring the loss of activity and substrate protection upon treatment with membrane-impermeable hydrophilic sodium (2-sulfonatoethyl)methanethiosulfonate (MTSES) (30Hou Z.

J. 2003; 374: 27-36Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Surface accessibility for loop domains connecting TMDs 9-12 of hRFC was confirmed by reactivity with impermeable 3-(N-maleimidylpropionyl)-biocytin (i.e. biotin maleimide) (30Hou Z. Stapels S.E.

In this study, we considered the tertiary structure of hRFC. We continued our SCAM studies of hRFC TMDs 1-10, drawing from our previous SCAM results with TMDs 11 and 12 (30Hou Z. Stapels S.E. Haska C.L. Matherly L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36206-36213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and the solved structures for the LacY and GlpT MFS homologs (11Abramson J. Smirnova I. Kasho V. Verner G. Kaback H.R. Iwata S. Science. 2003; 301: 610-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (1228) Google Scholar, 12Huang Y. Lemieux M.J. Song J. Auer M. Wang D.N. Science. 2003; 301: 616-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). Our results strongly support a role for amino acids localized to TMDs 4, 5, 7, 8, and 10, in addition to those previously identified in TMD11 (30Hou Z. Stapels S.E. Haska C.L. Matherly L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36206-36213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), in forming the putative substrate-binding pocket of hRFC. Our proposed model for hRFC tertiary structure appears to be in excellent agreement with mutant data for the murine and human carriers, validating the notion that transporter tertiary structure is highly conserved among MFS family members, including those with divergent substrates and origins (39Vardy E. Arkin I.T. Gottschalk K.E. Kaback H.R. Schuldiner S. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 1832-1840Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Reagents—[3′,5′,7-3H]Mtx (20 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Moravek Biochemicals (Brea, CA). Unlabeled Mtx and (6-R,S)-5-CHO-H4PteGlu (leucovorin) were provided by the Drug Development Branch, NCI, National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD). Both labeled and unlabeled Mtx were purified by high pressure liquid chromatography prior to use (40Fry D.W. Yalowich J.C. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1890-1896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Synthetic oligonucleotides were obtained from Invitrogen. Tissue culture reagents and supplies were purchased from assorted vendors with the exception of fetal bovine serum, which was purchased from Hyclone Technologies (Logan, UT). MTSES was purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals (Toronto, Ontario, Canada). Mutagenesis—Single cysteine-substituted hRFC mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange™ kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Primers for generating Cys substitutions were designed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sequences for the mutation primers are available upon request. hRFCmyc-his6Cys-less, in which cysteines were uniformly replaced by serines (36Cao W. Matherly L.H. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 27-36Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in pcDNA3.1, was used as template to generate 232 single cysteine replacement mutant constructs in which each residue from predicted TMDs 1-10, positions 204-217 in the TMD6-7 loop domain, and the TMD10-11 connecting loop (supplemental Table 1) was replaced individually by a cysteine residue. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cell Culture— hRFC-null Mtx-resistant HeLa cells, designated R5 (41Zhao R. Chattopadhyay S. Hanscom M. Goldman I.D. Clin. Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 8735-8742Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), were a gift of Dr. I. David Goldman (Bronx, NY). R5 cells were maintained as reported previously (30Hou Z. Stapels S.E. Haska C.L. Matherly L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36206-36213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). hRFCmyc-his6Cys-less and the single cysteine-substituted hRFCmyc-his6 constructs (see below) were transfected into R5 cells with Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen) (30Hou Z. Stapels S.E. Haska C.L. Matherly L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36206-36213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested after 48 h for the preparation of plasma membranes and Western blotting. For other experiments (MTSES treatments, transport assays), cultures were split 24 h after transfection and assayed after an additional 24 h. Western analysis of Mutant hRFC Transfectants—Plasma membrane preparation, SDS gel electrophoresis, electrotransfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and fluorescence detection of immunoreactive proteins were performed exactly as reported previously (30Hou Z. Stapels S.E. Haska C.L. Matherly L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36206-36213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Membrane Transport Assay, MTSES Treatment, and Leucovorin Protection—The uptake of [3H]Mtx (0.5 μm) was measured over a span of 2 min at 37 °C in 60-mm dishes in Hepes-Sucrose-Mg+2 buffer (HSM; 20 mm Hepes, 235 mm sucrose, pH adjusted to 7.3 with MgO) as described previously (30Hou Z. Stapels S.E. Haska C.L. Matherly L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36206-36213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Levels of intracellular radioactivity were expressed as pmol/mg protein calculated from direct measurements of radioactivity and protein contents of cell homogenates. Protein assays were based on the method of Lowry et al. (42Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MTSES treatments of cells were performed as in our previous report (30Hou Z. Stapels S.E. Haska C.L. Matherly L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36206-36213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) followed by assays of [3H]Mtx uptake. To assess the protective effects of a hRFC substrate from MTSES inhibition, leucovorin (300 μm final concentration) was added 5 min before adding the MTSES reagent. Modeling of hRFC—The sequences of GlpT and LacY (Protein Data Bank codes 1PW4 and 1PV6, respectively) were aligned on the basis of their structures using the Dali server (43Holm L. Sander C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 316-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). The putative transmembrane-spanning helices of hRFC were then aligned with the respective α-helices of GlpT and LacY. This initial alignment was optimized by fine-tuning some regions using computed helical wheel plots and experimental data. Modeling was performed with the “auto” mode for Modeler 8v1 (44Marti-Renom M.A. Stuart A.C. Fiser A. Sanchez R. Melo F. Sali A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 291-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (2594) Google Scholar) using the structures of GlpT and LacY as templates and the final sequence alignment as input. Expression and Function of Single Cysteine-substituted hRFC Mutants for TMDs 1-10, Amino Acids 204-217, and the TMD10-11 Connecting Loop—A goal of our study was to use SCAM and published structures for the LacY and GlpT proteins (11Abramson J. Smirnova I. Kasho V. Verner G. Kaback H.R. Iwata S. Science. 2003; 301: 610-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (1228) Google Scholar, 12Huang Y. Lemieux M.J. Song J. Auer M. Wang D.N. Science. 2003; 301: 616-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar) to generate a workable model of hRFC tertiary structure. As an extension of our previously published results with affinity labeling and SCAM that identified TMD11 of hRFC as important to substrate binding (30Hou Z. Stapels S.E. Haska C.L. Matherly L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36206-36213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), we focused our effort toward establishing the functional roles of amino acids spanning TMDs 1-10 of hRFC. Accordingly, we used the hRF-Cmyc-his6Cys-less construct (36Cao W. Matherly L.H. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 27-36Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as a template to prepare 204 single Cys-substituted mutants for amino acids located in TMDs 1-10 (supplemental Table 1). In addition, we generated 28 mutants spanning the highly conserved stretches from Lys-204 to Arg-217 flanking TMD6 and from Val-380 to Lys-393 in the loop domain between TMDs 10 and 11 (Fig. 1) to explore the possibility that these highly conserved segments might be functionally important. The single Cys-substituted mutant hRFC constructs were transiently transfected into hRFC-null R5 HeLa cells. Representative Western blotting results of plasma membrane proteins from the 232 mutant transfectants, along with membrane proteins from hRFCmyc-his6Cys-less transfected and untransfected R5 cells are included in supplemental Fig. S1, and densitometry results are summarized in supplemental Table 1. With only a few exceptions (i.e. R133C, G163C, S168C, D216C, L316C, I319C, F322C, A323C, A324C), the single Cys-substituted constructs were expressed in R5 cells within a 2-3-fold range. Although the migrations and apparent molecular masses for the 232 hRFC mutants were nearly identical to that for hRFCmyc-his6Cys-less and spanned a broad range (∼65 to ∼80 kDa), for the S360C, S361C, I362C, W363C, and L364C mutants of TMD10 (supplemental Fig. S1), additional higher molecular mass bands, presumably corresponding to aggregated hRFC, were reproducibly seen. The basis for this anomalous migration is not clear. To establish the functional consequences of the cysteine substitutions, [3H]Mtx uptake was measured over a 2-min span for each hRFCmyc-his6 Cys mutant. The uptake results were expressed as a percentage of that for hRFCmyc-his6Cys-less and compared with those for R5 cells (supplemental Table 1). For only nine residues, including Arg-133, Ile-134, Ala-135, Tyr-136, and Ser-138 in TMD4, Gly-163 in TMD5, Tyr-281 in TMD7, Ser-313 in TMD8, and Arg-373 in TMD10, did cysteine substitution abolish transport (equal or less than 2-fold over the residual level in R5 cells; highlighted in supplemental Table 1). Loss of transport activity was not associated with low levels of hRFC membrane proteins on Western blots (supplemental Fig. S1 and supplemental Table 1). Although activity was low (only 2-3-fold over R5 cells) for other mutants (e.g. G36C, Y74C, P82C, F141C, S142C, S167C, G171C, L210C, D310C, G317C, G325C, G374C, Y376C, A388C), in general, cysteine substitutions in the TMDs were extremely well tolerated, given that Mtx uptake far exceeded the residual low level in the hRFC-null R5 subline. The significant and disproportionate losses of transport activity for G36C, G171C, G317C, and G374C mutants further support the uniquely important roles of these conserved glycine residues in hRFC function as facilitators of conformational changes required for substrate translocation (46Abramson J. Kaback H.R. Iwata S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2004; 14: 413-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In our previous report, G401C was functionally inert (30Hou Z. Stapels S.E. Haska C.L. Matherly L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36206-36213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Although deletion of the segment between 204 and 214 was previously found to abolish transport by hRFC (14Liu X.Y. Witt T.L. Matherly L.H. Biochem. J. 2002; 369: 31-37Crossref Google Scholar), the only Cys mutant from 204-217 that showed an appreciable loss of transport activity was L210C (supplemental Table 1). Similarly, for the conserved TMD10-11 loop domain, previous amino acid replacements (i.e. I387N) abolished activity (47Liu X.Y. Matherly L.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1564: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar); however, we found that cysteine substitutions in this stretch were reasonably well tolerated. Replacement of Arg-133 in hRFC (with Glu, His, or Leu) or Arg-373 in hamster RFC (with His, Gln, Asn, or Ala) or substitution of leucine at the homologous positions in murine RFC (Arg-131 and Arg-373, respectively) significantly inhibited Mtx transport activity (20Liu X.Y. Matherly L.H. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 511-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 23Sharina I.G. Zhao R. Wang Y. Babani S. Goldman I.D. Mol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 42105-42112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, replacement of arginine at these positions with a positively charged lysine was reasonably well tolerated (20Liu X.Y. Matherly L.H. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 511-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 26Sadlish H. Williams F.M. Flintoff W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42105-42112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). For hRFC, Arg-133 appeared to form a charge-pair with Asp-88 in TMD2 (20Liu X.Y. Matherly L.H.

Characterization of Mtx-resistant L1210 murine leukemia cells identified S309L (corresponding to Ser-313 in hRFC), suggesting that this position may play an important role in substrate selectivity involving the one-carbon moiety at the N-5 position of reduced folate forms such as 5-methyl and 5-formyl tetrahydrofolate (25Zhao R.

Although Ile-134, Ala-135, Tyr-136, Ser-138, and Tyr-281 have not previously been implicated in carrier function, these residues are highly conserved between the human and rodent transporters (Fig. 1), suggesting their possible structural or functional importance. Effects on Transport Activity of Cys-Substituted hRFC Mutants of TMDs 1-10, Amino Acids 204-217, and the TMD10-11 Connecting Loop by MTSES—The underlying principle behind our SCAM experiments was to establish aqueous accessibility of residues predicted to lie within the lipid bilayer (reflecting their participation in forming the putative aqueous “channel” for hydrophilic folate and antifolate substrates) through replacement with cysteines and their reactivity with the small, water-soluble thiol-reactive alkylthiosulfonate reagent MTSES (30Hou Z.

Fig. 2 shows the effects of treating the 223 active single Cys-substituted hRFCmyc-his6 transfectants for TMDs 1-10 and the 204-217 and 380-393 peptides with 10 mm MTSES on [3H]Mtx uptake. Results were compared with those for hRFCmyc-his6Cys-less. Of the 187 active Cys mutants predicted to lie within the TMDs by topology models, 25, including those in TMD2 (P70C, L72C), TMD4 (Y126C, S137C), TMD5 (V160C, L161C, V164C, S167C, S168C, G171C, Q172C, V175C), TMD7 (W274C, S278C, Y282C, L283C, V284C, V285C, Y287C, V288C), TMD8 (A311C, T314C, G317C), and TMD10 (Y376C, Q377C), showed appreciable (25-75%) losses of Mtx transport activity resulting from MTSES treatment (Fig. 2). By contrast, the activities for none of the single hRFCmyc-his6 Cys mutants in TMDs 1, 3, 6, and 9 or positions 204-217 were impacted by MTSES treatment (Fig. 2). Although our original hydropathy model for hRFC (30Hou Z. Stapels S.E. Haska C.L. Matherly L.H. J. Biol.

These results are best explained by previous results that Leu-70 in the homologous hamster RFC (corresponds to Leu-72 in hRFC) is extracellular (i.e. outside the plane of the lipid bilayer) where it readily reacts with membrane-impermeable biotin maleimide (37Flintoff W.F.

Matherly L.H. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) that suggests an intracellular localization rather than involvement in reentrant loop structures for these regions (Fig. 1). However, V380C, also predicted to lie in the TMD10-11 loop by computer models (30Hou Z. Stapels S.E. Haska C.L. Matherly L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36206-36213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), resembles Y376C and Q377C in its MTSES sensitivity, suggesting the aqueous accessibility of the former and its contribution to the TMD10 helical segment. Of course, evidence for direct accessibility of these aqueous-exposed residues to bound (anti)folate involves protection from MTSES inhibition by excess leucovorin, an established transport substrate. When transfected cells expressing the 26 MTSES-sensitive hRFCmyc-his6 cysteine mutants were treated with MTSES in the presence of 300 μm leucovorin, inhibition for 13 of these mutants (Y126C, S137C, V160C, S168C, W274C, S278C, V284C, V288C, A311C, T314C, Y376C, Q377C, V380C) was at least partially abolished (1.3-2.1-fold) (Fig. 3). These results strongly suggest that amino acids localized to TMDs 4, 5, 7, 8, and 10 contribute to the substrate-binding pocket in hRFC. The lack of protection of the other MTSES-sensitive mutants presumably reflects the aqueous accessibility of these positions independent of their juxtaposition to bound transport substrate (e.g. P70C and L72C). Tertiary Structure Model for hRFC—Our present and previous (30Hou Z. Stapels S.E. Haska C.L. Matherly L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36206-36213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) results establish that cysteine insertions localized to TMDs 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 11 are aqueous-accessible and sensitive to MTSES and that MTSES-sensitive cysteines in these TMDs are at least partly protected by leucovorin. These results are consistent with the published crystal structures of the LacY and GlpT MFS homologs in that helices I, II, IV, V, VII, VIII, X, and XI for these bacterial transporters comprise a hydrophilic cavity and that residues located in TMDs I, IV, V, VII, and XI participate in binding of hydrophilic substrates (11Abramson J. Smirnova I. Kasho V. Verner G. Kaback H.R. Iwata S. Science. 2003; 301: 610-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (1228) Google Scholar, 12Huang Y. Lemieux M.J. Song J. Auer M. Wang D.N. Science. 2003; 301: 616-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). Helices III, VI, IX, and XII appear to serve mostly structural roles in the LacY and GlpT proteins. Based on this analogy and on our SCAM results for hRFC, we present folding models of hRFC tertiary structure consisting of α-helices of helix-forming amino acids localized to the TMDs (Figs. 4 and 5). For the two-dimensional model in Fig. 4, all of the MTSES-sensitive positions are predicted to lie on one (aqueous-accessible) face of each TMD helix (shown as numbered red and yellow circles) with the exception of Leu-283 in TMD7. Protection from MTSES inhibition by leucovorin (Fig. 4, red circles) identifies positions that directly abut the bound folate within the putative transmembrane channel; however, this may or may not be coincident with amino acids directly involved in substrate binding.FIGURE 5Proposed three-dimensional models of hRFC, based on solved crystal structures of LacY and GlpT and SCAM analysis, and the hypothesized substrate binding site of hRFC. A three-dimensional hypothetical model for hRFC is presented based on structure alignments between hRFC and LacY and GlpT and fine-tuned based on experimental data. Modeling was performed with the Modeler 8v1 auto mode (44Marti-Renom M.A. Stuart A.C. Fiser A. Sanchez R. Melo F. Sali A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 291-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (2594) Google Scholar). All models were drawn using PyMOL (50DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA2002Google Scholar). A, a side view of the hRFC for which the extended C-terminal segment is truncated at Lys-479. TMDs 1, 2, 4, and 5 of the N-terminal region and TMDs 7, 8, 10, and 11 of the C-terminal region are hypothesized to be involved in formation of the hydrophilic cavity for anionic substrate binding (colored sky blue). TMDs 3, 6, 9, and 12 are likely buried in the lipid bilayer and do not directly participate in substrate binding (colored green). Panel A also depicts key amino acids (shown in assorted colors) that may contribute to the binding pocket for anionic folate substrates, as described under “Results and Discussion.” B, a cytosolic view of only the TMD segments (numbered 1-12 as in Fig. 4) of the hRFC molecule so that the order of helix packing can be seen easily. TMD coloring is the same as described in A and in the two-dimensional model of hRFC in Fig. 4. C, enhanced view of the hypothetical substrate binding site comprising the same key amino acids depicted in A, including Lys-411, Ser-313, Tyr-281, and Arg-373, as described in the text. Other residues that may contribute to the substrate-binding pocket are also shown and include Arg-133, Ile-134, Ala-135, Tyr-136, and Ser-138. The physical distances between the α carboxyl groups of Lys-411, Ser-313, Tyr-281, and Arg-373 are given in angstroms.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Leu-283 is preceded by Gly (at position 280), a well established “helix breaker.” Glycine was implied to facilitate the bending of helices in the LacY and GlpT structures. This supports the notion that such “irregular” helices provide the structural flexibility needed to assume the conformations required for transport (46Abramson J. Kaback H.R. Iwata S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2004; 14: 413-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In hRFC, Gly-280 may serve a similar purpose and may render position 283 aqueous-accessible for reaction with MTSES. Similar functional roles were previously implied for Gly-401 in TMD11 (30Hou Z. Stapels S.E. Haska C.L. Matherly L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36206-36213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and in the present study for Gly-36 (TMD1), Gly-171 (TMD5), Gly-317 (TMD8), and Gly-374 (TMD10) for which replacement with cysteines resulted in significant losses of transport activity. A three-dimensional model for hRFC based on the solved MFS structures and the biochemical data for hRFC is shown in Fig. 5, A and B, which depicts TMDs 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 11 as components of the putative membrane-spanning channel flanked by TMDs 3, 6, 9, and 12 (although amino acids within TMDs 1 and 2 were not directly implicated as aqueous-accessible in the present study, these regions contributed to the aqueous transmembrane channel in the LacY and GlpT structures, as noted above). From the nearly complete ablation of transport activity upon cysteine substitution, a number of amino acids would seem to be structurally or functionally important in hRFC, including Arg-133, Ile-134, Ala-135, Tyr-136, and Ser-138 in TMD4, Tyr-281 in TMD7, Ser-313 in TMD8, and Arg-373 in TMD10. Moreover, our previous results imply that Lys-411 in TMD11 is important for binding certain transport substrates (28Witt T.L. Matherly L.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1567: 56-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and, most recently, that it is a likely target for covalent modification by the activated ester N-hydroxysuccinimide Mtx. 4Y. Deng and L. H. Matherly, manuscript in preparation. This suggests that Lys-411 participates in binding to the glutamate moiety in Mtx and reduced folates. Compelling evidence from mutant studies establishes that Ser-313 and Arg-373 are functionally important and contribute to substrate binding specificity (25Zhao R. Gao F. Goldman I.D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 58: 1615-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 26Sadlish H. Williams F.M. Flintoff W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42105-42112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). From these results, we suggest that Lys-411, Ser-313, and Arg-373 comprise a hydrophilic binding pocket for anionic folate substrates (Fig. 5C). Given its close juxtaposition to both Ser-313 and Arg-373 in this model, the conserved Tyr-281 can easily be envisaged to participate in substrate binding as well. Our finding that cysteine substitutions of Arg-133, Ile-134, Ala-135, Tyr-136, and Ser-138 abolished transport is, likewise, consistent with earlier suggestions of functionally important residues localized to TMD4 (Ser-127, Ala-132, Arg-133) (20Liu X.Y.

Clearly, an important step toward better understanding the molecular mechanism of concentrative (anti)folate transport by hRFC will involve identification of key determinants of substrate recognition and membrane translocation through the use of systematic site-directed mutagenesis of these potentially critical amino acids.

This pattern is conserved in epithelia from diverse species, suggesting that this distribution is a fundamental property of proliferating epithelial sheets. A specific and unexpected distribution pattern of polygonal cell shapes in proliferating epithelia is revealed in a recent study that combines mathematical modeling with experimental data (Gibson et al., 2006Gibson M.C. Patel A.B. Nagpal R. Perrimon N. Nature. 2006; (in press Published online August 9, 2006)https://doi.org/10.1038/nature05014Crossref Scopus (288) Google Scholar). This pattern is conserved in epithelia from diverse species, suggesting that this distribution is a fundamental property of proliferating epithelial sheets. Modulation of cell shape is a key process that drives morphogenesis during development. For example, in the Drosophila embryo, constriction of the apical epithelial surface during gastrulation results in invagination (Figure 1A), whereas more complex cell shape changes give rise to other structures such as grooves and tubes. Within the plane of an epithelial sheet, regulated cell shape—as defined by the polygonal character of the cells in two dimensions—is critical to the formation of some tissues. How these polygonal shapes form is a fascinating question. In a recent study in Nature, Gibson et al., 2006Gibson M.C. Patel A.B. Nagpal R. Perrimon N. Nature. 2006; (in press Published online August 9, 2006)https://doi.org/10.1038/nature05014Crossref Scopus (288) Google Scholar address this question in the proliferating wing-disc epithelium of Drosophila. Achieving a particular polygonal cell shape is not simply a consequence of optimal cell packing (see Figure 1). In the fly embryo, elongation and narrowing of the embryo along the anterior-posterior axis is accompanied by a transition from a relatively ordered hexagonal packing pattern to one in which this pattern is largely extinguished, suggesting that modulation of cell geometry is important for this process (Zallen and Zallen, 2004Zallen J.A. Zallen R. J. Phys. Condens. Matter. 2004; 16: S5073-S5080Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The elongation and narrowing is driven, at least in part, by cells intercalating between their neighbors in an oriented fashion (Figure 1B). This process appears to depend on the directed reorganization of cellular junctions controlled by myosin II-dependent cytoskeletal reorganization (Bertet et al., 2004Bertet C. Sulak L. Lecuit T. Nature. 2004; 429: 667-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). Different forces are at work in the fly retina, which is composed of a repeating pattern of defined cell types, each of a specific polygonal shape, and each fitting into its specified position in the pattern (Hayashi and Carthew, 2004Hayashi T. Carthew R.W. Nature. 2004; 431: 647-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Here, selective cell adhesion, mediated by selective expression of cadherins, together with an apparent tendency to minimize surface free energy, contributes to the shape of the cells (Figure 1C). Theories of how polygonal cell shape in an epithelial sheet is controlled have often invoked physical-chemical properties, such as minimization of surface free energy, to explain why cell packing patterns tend toward regular hexagonal arrays and how they evolve over time (Taylor, 1976Taylor J.E. Ann. Math. 1976; 103: 489-539Crossref Google Scholar). Although some epithelia appear to approach the ideal hexagonal packing predicted by minimization of surface free energy, others, notably including those that are proliferating, contain many hexagonal cells yet are far from regular hexagonal arrays. Gibson et al., 2006Gibson M.C. Patel A.B. Nagpal R. Perrimon N. Nature. 2006; (in press Published online August 9, 2006)https://doi.org/10.1038/nature05014Crossref Scopus (288) Google Scholar considered the question of what controls the distribution of polygonal shapes in a proliferating epithelium. Using a first-order Markov model with assumptions validated by data gathered from live imaging, the authors tested the possibility that the distribution of polygonal cell shapes in proliferating epithelia is a simple and predictable consequence of the changes in cell sidedness associated with cell divisions. They came to the remarkable conclusion that the frequency distribution of cellular polygons of a given number of sides converges to an invariant steady state, and this distribution is extraordinarily well matched by empirical data from epithelia of widely divergent species. Therefore, this steady-state distribution of polygons appears to be a fundamental property of epithelia in which cells are replicating. Focusing on the fly wing imaginal disc—an epithelium that undergoes a massive proliferation prior to differentiation into a wing—the authors determined that daughters of replicating cells share a common, new cell border at least 94% of the time. Furthermore, although the mitotic mother cell enlarges and rounds up, it maintains its contacts with neighboring cells throughout the division. Both observations indicate that cell migration is negligible during this phase of growth. Based on these and other empirical observations, they then defined six conditions from which to construct their Markov model: (1) Cells have four or more sides; (2) cell migration or sorting is insignificant; (3) sister cells retain a shared cell junction after division (the difference between modeling 94% and 100% is subsequently shown to be very small); (4) cell cycles are asynchronous and of similar length; (5) cleavage planes intersect sides rather than vertices of a cell; and (6) existing cell junctions are randomly distributed to daughter cells, but no fewer than two segregate to each daughter. The net result for the model is that the daughter cells have fewer sides than the mother, whereas two immediate neighbors acquire an extra side in a defined way (Figure 1D). The Markov model describes the state of the system at discrete times, as defined by the number of sides of each cell, as well as the probability of each cell transitioning from one state to another through time. Because the Markov model satisfies defined criteria (the Perron-Frobenius theorem), it rapidly converges to a steady state independent of the starting conditions. The model predicts a steady-state distribution of 28.9% pentagons, 46.4% hexagons, 20.8% heptagons, 3.6% octagons, and declining fractions of cells with increasing numbers of sides. Remarkably, this distribution is almost indistinguishable from those empirically observed in the imaginal wing-disc epithelium, as well as for proliferating epithelia from Xenopus and hydra. The steady-state polygon distribution can therefore be regarded as an emergent property of the process by which cells replicate; the result requires no consideration of surface free energy and only assumes that cell adhesion is stable through cell divisions. What, then, are the implications of this observation? At least two processes whose study might be informed by extension of these results come to mind: anisotropy of tissue growth from oriented cell division, and cell competition during which faster- and slower-growing cells coordinate to regulate tissue or organ size. Through the study of clone size and shape and of oriented cell divisions, researchers have deduced that anisotropic growth of clones (progeny of an individual cell) can determine the final shape of a plant or animal organ such as a flower petal or wing (Resino et al., 2002Resino J. Salama-Cohen P. Garcia-Bellido A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 7502-7507Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, Rolland-Lagan et al., 2003Rolland-Lagan A.G. Bangham J.A. Coen E. Nature. 2003; 422: 161-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In turn, oriented cell division appears to regulate the shape and orientation of clone growth (Baena-Lopez et al., 2005Baena-Lopez L.A. Baonza A. Garcia-Bellido A. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1640-1644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). However, no detailed analysis of cell shapes when cleavage planes are oriented has been performed. What would be the cell geometric consequences of orienting cell divisions during replication? Orienting the cleavage plane does not violate the six preconditions of the model, but neither does the model explicitly capture orientation of polygons. Might there be a signature of cell geometries resulting from various forms of anisotropic growth that could be recognized as diagnostic of the anisotropy? It has long been known that tissues and organs grow to a predetermined size even if a fraction of the cell population comprising them is impaired for growth or supercharged for growth. The strong competitors express higher levels of Myc (de la Cova et al., 2004de la Cova C. Abril M. Bellosta P. Gallant P. Johnston L.A. Cell. 2004; 117: 107-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar) and send a signal that induces apoptosis in the neighboring, weaker competitors (Moreno et al., 2002Moreno E. Basler K. Morata G. Nature. 2002; 416: 755-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). But what is the signal that recognizes the difference between the populations? What maintains this balance in a wild-type tissue? Gibson et al., 2006Gibson M.C. Patel A.B. Nagpal R. Perrimon N. Nature. 2006; (in press Published online August 9, 2006)https://doi.org/10.1038/nature05014Crossref Scopus (288) Google Scholar show that a clone of more rapidly proliferating cells shifts to a polygon profile with a lower average number of sides. Is the correlation between reduced mean number of sides and more rapid proliferation incidental, or might the number of sides be involved in regulating a cell's competitiveness? Finally, many postmitotic epithelia show a much more regular hexagonal packing pattern than their replicating precursors. The force driving reorganization from the distribution described by Gibson et al., 2006Gibson M.C. Patel A.B. Nagpal R. Perrimon N. Nature. 2006; (in press Published online August 9, 2006)https://doi.org/10.1038/nature05014Crossref Scopus (288) Google Scholar to a more regular hexagonal array is not known. It will be important to determine whether this is a passive physical process or a genetically encoded transition. A resurgence of mathematical modeling applied to biological problems has provided new insights into a variety of processes. Gibson et al., 2006Gibson M.C. Patel A.B. Nagpal R. Perrimon N.

https://openalex.org/W1997148405,"The serine protease inhibitor SerpinB2 (plasminogen activator inhibitor-2) is a major product of activated monocytes and macrophages and is substantially induced during most inflammatory processes. Distinct from its widely described extracellular role as an inhibitor of urokinase plasminogen activator, SerpinB2 has recently been shown to have an intracellular role as a retinoblastoma protein (Rb)-binding protein that inhibits Rb degradation. Here we show that HIV-1 infection and gp120 treatment of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells resulted in induction of SerpinB2. Furthermore, SerpinB2 expression in THP-1 monocyte/macrophage, Jurkat T, and HeLa cell lines increased replication of HIV-1 and enhanced transcription from the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter by 3-10-fold. Increased HIV-1 gene expression and transcription was also observed in activated macrophages from SerpinB2+/+ mice compared with macrophages from SerpinB2-/- mice. The SerpinB2-mediated elevation of Rb protein levels appeared to be responsible for enhancing transcription from the core promoter region of the LTR by relieving HDM2-mediated inhibition of Sp1 and/or by increasing the Sp1/Sp3 expression ratios. This is the first report associating HIV-1 replication with SerpinB2 expression and illustrates that SerpinB2 is a potentially important inducible host factor that significantly promotes HIV-1 replication."

Although well respected, German universities are no longer considered world class. Efforts to rejuvenate the German university system include a competition to confer elite status on the country's ten leading universities. German universities are no longer considered to be at the forefront of teaching and research as they were before World War II. They are no longer able to compete with the Ivy League universities of the US, such as Harvard and Yale, or with universities such as Oxford and Cambridge in the UK. According to an article ranking the top universities worldwide in the October 2005 issue of the Times Higher Education Supplement, the highest ranked German university was Heidelberg (# 45), followed by the Technical University of Munich (# 55). To combat this trend, in June 2004, the minister for education and research at the time, Edelgard Bulmahn, announced a special initiative: a national competition in which the nation's 100 or so universities would have the opportunity to compete for “elite university” status. The German government has committed 1.9 billion Euros (US $2.3 billion) of additional funds over 5 years to the ten universities selected as elite. There are two rounds to the competition, with the first round winners due to be announced in October this year. The declared aim of the initiative, called the “Exzellenziniative,” is to raise Germany's international competitiveness in science and therefore its economic power by creating “beacons of science” that embrace the broad spectrum of science and arts—from physics to philosophy. The competition for elite university status is administered by the German federal government's main grant funding body, the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG), and by the German Science Council (Wissenschaftsrat). The science committee of the DFG presides over the peer reviewed distribution of research grants worth 1.5 billion Euros annually. The German Science Council publishes reports on quality of research and advises the federal and state governments on science policies but does not distribute grants itself. The DFG established a jury including German politicians and leading scientists from both within and outside Germany to assess proposals from German universities seeking elite status. Part of the problem with the German university system lies in its history of egalitarianism and decentralization. Traditionally, German universities have offered equal opportunities to all members of society for a university education and until recently did not even charge tuition fees. Germany is a federation of states, and science and education policies are decided on a state by state basis, with the 16 states carrying political and financial responsibilities for the universities in their region. The central government can only introduce nationwide programs or support individual university projects if all 16 states agree. Largely dependent on the government of their state, German universities have suffered from a lack of autonomy and insufficient funding. Indeed, since 1975 the share of the gross domestic product spent on teaching and research in German universities has declined to 0.84%. In contrast, non-university research institutes in Germany, such as those run by the Max-Planck, Helmholtz, and Fraunhofer societies, have prospered; and many of them are considered world class. The downward trend for German universities is set to change with the introduction of the elite competition and a commitment on the part of Angela Merkel, Chancellor of Germany, to increase spending on R&D to 3% of gross domestic product by 2010. The elite university competition, although at first greeted with scepticism, has now been embraced by the universities and their students. This success prompted the German government to broaden the scope of the original elite university initiative to supply two extra streams of funding—for about 40 graduate schools and 30 research network “centers of excellence.” German universities can submit preliminary proposals in either the first or second round for any or all of the three categories: graduate schools, research network centers of excellence, and institutional development strategies to promote top-level research (from which the ten elite universities are to be selected). In addition to the international jury convened by the DFG, 20 science panels have examined the 319 proposals received in the first round of selection for the three funding programs. Of 135 proposals submitted by 74 universities for the graduate school category, 39 universities were selected and invited to submit full proposals to receive an extra one million Euros per year. Of the 157 proposals submitted for the centers of excellence category, 41 universities and institutes were selected and invited to submit full proposals to receive an extra 6.5 million Euros per year. But perhaps the category that has prompted the most interest and scrutiny is that for institutional development strategies from which the shortlist of ten elite universities is to be culled. Of the 27 proposals, ten universities were pre-selected earlier this year as candidates to ultimately achieve elite status; if chosen, each will receive an extra 25 million Euros per year for 5 years. The elite university shortlist includes, as expected, those universities located in the more prosperous southern states: the universities of Freiburg, Tübingen, Heidelberg, and Würzburg, as well as Munich's Ludwig-Maximilians and Technical University. However, there was relief among other regions of the country when universities such as the Free University of Berlin, as well as two smaller universities (Technical University of Aachen and the University of Bremen), made the top ten shortlist. In October this year, the German government will announce the five or so universities that have been selected from this shortlist to receive elite status; the remaining elite universities will be announced in October 2007. The winners of the first round selection for the graduate school and research centers of excellence funding programs will also be announced this October. “We have learnt a great deal from the international peer review of the submitted proposals,” said Professor Ernst-Ludwig Winnacker at the annual meeting of the DFG in Munich in June this year. “Two points were heavily criticised by our advisors from abroad: the lack of internationality and the failure to provide even chances for women scientists,” said Winnacker. Only 5% of professorships at German universities are held by foreign scientists, and less than 9% of the university chairs are occupied by women. President of the DFG since 1998 (he will hand over the presidency at the end of 2006), Winnacker, a biochemist from Ludwig-Maximilians University in Munich, has praised the elite university initiative. However, he points out that even an investment of 25 million Euros per year in each elite university will not guarantee their entry into the ranks of the world's top universities. The elite university competition and the two other initiatives for excellence have garnered broad support. Says Peter Hommelhoff, rector of Heidelberg University, “The public has regained some of their trust in universities, and they have got some of their dignity back.” The head of the German Science Council, the neurologist Karl Max Einhäupl from Charité University Hospital in Berlin, has pointed out that “the long desired change in paradigms has taken place and we can now say goodbye to the concept of homogeneity and get used to the concept of diversity and competition between universities.” Others are not so convinced. Says stem cell researcher Hans Schöler, who returned from the University of Pennsylvania to become Director of the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Medicine in Münster, “There is a lot of talk about elite universities and grants for science, but in the end it needs a lot of money to carry out such a program.” Molecular biologist Thomas Tuschl, who was a junior research group leader in Göttingen and now heads a laboratory at Rockefeller University in New York, thinks that Germany's main problem is not lack of funds for research facilities and equipment but rather for professors and qualified research and teaching personnel, given the huge numbers of students at German universities. He welcomes the elite university competition particularly if it is used to set up independent and well-staffed research departments with interesting and innovative research programs. The German government seems to be off to an impressive start with its reorganization of the university system, but only time will tell whether these new initiatives will ensure that Germany's universities regain their former glory."
