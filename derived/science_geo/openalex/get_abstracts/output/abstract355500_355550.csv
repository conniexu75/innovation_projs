https://openalex.org/W2128963410,"Ebola virus (EBOV) entry requires the surface glycoprotein (GP) to initiate attachment and fusion of viral and host membranes. Here we report the crystal structure of EBOV GP in its trimeric, pre-fusion conformation (GP1+GP2) bound to a neutralizing antibody, KZ52, derived from a human survivor of the 1995 Kikwit outbreak. Three GP1 viral attachment subunits assemble to form a chalice, cradled by the GP2 fusion subunits, while a novel glycan cap and projected mucin-like domain restrict access to the conserved receptor-binding site sequestered in the chalice bowl. The glycocalyx surrounding GP is likely central to immune evasion and may explain why survivors have insignificant neutralizing antibody titres. KZ52 recognizes a protein epitope at the chalice base where it clamps several regions of the pre-fusion GP2 to the amino terminus of GP1. This structure provides a template for unravelling the mechanism of EBOV GP-mediated fusion and for future immunotherapeutic development."

https://openalex.org/W1974440260,"Meiotic recombination has a central role in the evolution of sexually reproducing organisms. The two recombination outcomes, crossover and non-crossover, increase genetic diversity, but have the potential to homogenize alleles by gene conversion. Whereas crossover rates vary considerably across the genome, non-crossovers and gene conversions have only been identified in a handful of loci. To examine recombination genome wide and at high spatial resolution, we generated maps of crossovers, crossover-associated gene conversion and non-crossover gene conversion using dense genetic marker data collected from all four products of fifty-six yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) meioses. Our maps reveal differences in the distributions of crossovers and non-crossovers, showing more regions where either crossovers or non-crossovers are favoured than expected by chance. Furthermore, we detect evidence for interference between crossovers and non-crossovers, a phenomenon previously only known to occur between crossovers. Up to 1% of the genome of each meiotic product is subject to gene conversion in a single meiosis, with detectable bias towards GC nucleotides. To our knowledge the maps represent the first high-resolution, genome-wide characterization of the multiple outcomes of recombination in any organism. In addition, because non-crossover hotspots create holes of reduced linkage within haplotype blocks, our results stress the need to incorporate non-crossovers into genetic linkage analysis."

https://openalex.org/W2165108457,"Congruent findings from studies of fear learning in animals and humans indicate that research on the circuits mediating fear constitutes our best hope of understanding human anxiety disorders. In mammals, repeated presentations of a conditioned stimulus that was previously paired to a noxious stimulus leads to the gradual disappearance of conditioned fear responses. Although much evidence suggests that this extinction process depends on plastic events in the amygdala, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Intercalated (ITC) amygdala neurons constitute probable mediators of extinction because they receive information about the conditioned stimulus from the basolateral amygdala (BLA), and contribute inhibitory projections to the central nucleus (CEA), the main output station of the amygdala for conditioned fear responses. Thus, after extinction training, ITC cells could reduce the impact of conditioned-stimulus-related BLA inputs to the CEA by means of feed-forward inhibition. Here we test the hypothesis that ITC neurons mediate extinction by lesioning them with a toxin that selectively targets cells expressing micro-opioid receptors (microORs). Electron microscopic observations revealed that the incidence of microOR-immunoreactive synapses is much higher in ITC cell clusters than in the BLA or CEA and that microORs typically have a post-synaptic location in ITC cells. In keeping with this, bilateral infusions of the microOR agonist dermorphin conjugated to the toxin saporin in the vicinity of ITC neurons caused a 34% reduction in the number of ITC cells but no significant cell loss in surrounding nuclei. Moreover, ITC lesions caused a marked deficit in the expression of extinction that correlated negatively with the number of surviving ITC neurons but not CEA cells. Because ITC cells exhibit an unusual pattern of receptor expression, these findings open new avenues for the treatment of anxiety disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2043698583,"All viruses rely on host cell proteins and their associated mechanisms to complete the viral life cycle. Identifying the host molecules that participate in each step of virus replication could provide valuable new targets for antiviral therapy, but this goal may take several decades to achieve with conventional forward genetic screening methods and mammalian cell cultures. Here we describe a novel genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) screen in Drosophila that can be used to identify host genes important for influenza virus replication. After modifying influenza virus to allow infection of Drosophila cells and detection of influenza virus gene expression, we tested an RNAi library against 13,071 genes (90% of the Drosophila genome), identifying over 100 for which suppression in Drosophila cells significantly inhibited or stimulated reporter gene (Renilla luciferase) expression from an influenza-virus-derived vector. The relevance of these findings to influenza virus infection of mammalian cells is illustrated for a subset of the Drosophila genes identified; that is, for three implicated Drosophila genes, the corresponding human homologues ATP6V0D1, COX6A1 and NXF1 are shown to have key functions in the replication of H5N1 and H1N1 influenza A viruses, but not vesicular stomatitis virus or vaccinia virus, in human HEK 293 cells. Thus, we have demonstrated the feasibility of using genome-wide RNAi screens in Drosophila to identify previously unrecognized host proteins that are required for influenza virus replication. This could accelerate the development of new classes of antiviral drugs for chemoprophylaxis and treatment, which are urgently needed given the obstacles to rapid development of an effective vaccine against pandemic influenza and the probable emergence of strains resistant to available drugs."

https://openalex.org/W1973607597,"The purpose of the present study was to search for the presence of a tumor-initiating stem cell population in renal carcinomas. Based on the recent identification of mesenchymal stem cells in normal kidneys, we sorted cells expressing the mesenchymal stem cell marker CD105 from 5 human renal carcinomas. Because the CD105(+) but not the CD105(-) population showed enhanced tumorigenicity when injected in severely compromised immunodeficient (SCID) mice, we cloned and characterized CD105(+) cells and evaluated their stemness, differentiative ability, and serial tumor generation. Characterization of the phenotype of CD105(+) clones revealed several stem cell properties: 1) clonogenic ability, 2) expression of nestin, Nanog, Oct4 stem cell markers, and lack of differentiative epithelial markers, 3) ability to grow in nonadhesive spheroids, 4) in vitro differentiation into epithelial and endothelial cell types, and 5) generation in vivo of serially transplantable carcinomas containing an undifferentiated CD105(+) tumorigenic and a differentiated CD105(-) nontumorigenic population. In addition, some vessels present in carcinomas generated from CD105(+) clones were of human origin, suggesting the capability of tumor-initiating stem cells to in vivo differentiate also in endothelial cells. In conclusion, we demonstrate that CD105(+) cells and clones derived from renal carcinomas were enriched in tumor-initiating cells with stem characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W2003519013,"Rho GTPases (20 human members) comprise a major branch of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases, and aberrant Rho GTPase function has been implicated in oncogenesis and other human diseases. Although many of our current concepts of Rho GTPases are based on the three classical members (RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42), recent studies have revealed the diversity of biological functions mediated by other family members. A key basis for the functional diversity of Rho GTPases is their association with distinct subcellular compartments, which is dictated in part by three posttranslational modifications signaled by their carboxyl-terminal CAAX (where C represents cysteine, A is an aliphatic amino acid, and X is a terminal amino acid) tetrapeptide motifs. CAAX motifs are substrates for the prenyltransferase-catalyzed addition of either farnesyl or geranylgeranyl isoprenoid lipids, Rce1-catalyzed endoproteolytic cleavage of the AAX amino acids, and Icmt-catalyzed carboxyl methylation of the isoprenylcysteine. We utilized pharmacologic, biochemical, and genetic approaches to determine the sequence requirements and roles of CAAX signal modifications in dictating the subcellular locations and functions of the Rho GTPase family. Although the classical Rho GTPases are modified by geranylgeranylation, we found that a majority of the other Rho GTPases are substrates for farnesyltransferase. We found that the membrane association and/or function of Rho GTPases are differentially dependent on Rce1- and Icmt-mediated modifications. Our results further delineate the sequence requirements for prenyltransferase specificity and functional roles for protein prenylation in Rho GTPase function. We conclude that a majority of Rho GTPases are targets for pharmacologic inhibitors of farnesyltransferase, Rce1, and Icmt.

Our results further delineate the sequence requirements for prenyltransferase specificity and functional roles for protein prenylation in Rho GTPase function. We conclude that a majority of Rho GTPases are targets for pharmacologic inhibitors of farnesyltransferase, Rce1, and Icmt. Rho proteins are members of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases and function as GDP/GTP-regulated switches (1Colicelli J. Science's STKE 2004. 2004; : RE13Google Scholar, 2Wennerberg K. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 843-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar). Much of our current understanding of the biochemistry and biology of the Rho family has come from the extensive evaluation of three classical members, RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 (3Wennerberg K. Der C.J. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1301-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Similar to Ras, Rho GDP/GTP cycling is regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors that promote the formation of the active GTP-bound form (4Schmidt A. Hall A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar) and GTPase-activating proteins that catalyze the intrinsic GTPase activity and promote the formation of inactive GDP-bound Rho (5Bernards A. Settleman J. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 377-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Active, GTP-bound Rho GTPases bind preferentially to downstream effectors, stimulating diverse cytoplasmic signaling cascades that control actin reorganization and regulate cell shape, polarity, motility, adhesion, and membrane trafficking (6Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3794) Google Scholar). As such, it is thought that activated Rho proteins contribute to cancer progression by influencing the ability of cells to migrate and thus to invade and metastasize. In addition to these alterations in cellular function, aberrant activation of Rho proteins has also been shown to contribute to other cancer phenotypes by promoting cell growth, proliferation, survival, and angiogenesis (7Ridley A.J. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2004; 84: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Therefore, defining pharmacologic approaches for inhibition of Rho GTPase function represents an important direction for target-based anti-cancer drug discovery.Similar to Ras, the majority of Rho family GTPases are known or anticipated to undergo a series of posttranslational modifications that promote proper subcellular localization to the plasma membrane and/or endomembranes, which is required for biological activity. This series of modifications is initiated by the recognition of a carboxyl-terminal CAAX tetrapeptide motif (where C represents cysteine, A is an aliphatic amino acid, and X is any amino acid), which is found on 16 of 20 Rho GTPases (Table 1; canonical CAAX motifs are not present in the Wrch-1, Chp/Wrch-2, RhoBTB1, or RhoBTB2). The first step, mediated by farnesyltransferase (FTase) 2The abbreviations used are: FTasefarnesyltransferaseRce1Ras-converting enzyme 1Icmtisoprenylcysteine-O-carboxyl methyltransferaseGGTase-Igeranylgeranyltransferase type IFTIfarnesyltransferase inhibitorGGTIgeranylgeranyltransferase I inhibitorMEFmouse embryonic fibroblastGFPgreen fluorescent protein2-BP2-bromopalmitateBiotin-BMCC1-biotinamido-4-(4′-(maleimidomethyl cyclohexanecarboxamido) butaneGTPaseguanine triphosphataseGFPgreen fluorescent protein. 2The abbreviations used are: FTasefarnesyltransferaseRce1Ras-converting enzyme 1Icmtisoprenylcysteine-O-carboxyl methyltransferaseGGTase-Igeranylgeranyltransferase type IFTIfarnesyltransferase inhibitorGGTIgeranylgeranyltransferase I inhibitorMEFmouse embryonic fibroblastGFPgreen fluorescent protein2-BP2-bromopalmitateBiotin-BMCC1-biotinamido-4-(4′-(maleimidomethyl cyclohexanecarboxamido) butaneGTPaseguanine triphosphataseGFPgreen fluorescent protein. and/or geranylgeranyltransferase type I (GGTase-I), results in the covalent addition of a farnesyl or geranylgeranyl isoprenoid lipid, respectively, to the cysteine residue of the CAAX sequence. Next, the -AAX peptide is cleaved from the carboxyl terminus by the Rce1 (Ras-converting enzyme 1) endoprotease. Finally, isoprenylcysteine-O-carboxyl methyltransferase (Icmt) catalyzes the addition of a methyl group to the prenylated cysteine residue (8Sebti S.M. Der C.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Together, these modifications increase protein hydrophobicity and facilitate membrane association. Where studied, mutation of the cysteine residue of the CAAX motif, which prevents all three modifications, renders Rho GTPases inactive due to mislocalization to the cytosol (9Winter-Vann A.M. Casey P.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Thus, pharmacological inhibitors of protein prenylation are anticipated to be effective inhibitors of Rho GTPase activity. Recent observations upon genetic ablation of GGTase-I activity support this possibility. Transient genetic depletion of GGTase-I caused mouse embryonic fibroblasts to undergo growth arrest, cell rounding, impaired cell migration, and reduced actin polymerization, and these phenotypic alterations were partially rescued by GGTase-I-independent, farnesylated variants of RhoA and Cdc42 (10Sjogren A.K. Andersson K.M. Liu M. Cutts B.A. Karlsson C. Wahlstrom A.M. Dalin M. Weinbaum C. Casey P.J. Tarkowski A. Swolin B. Young S.G. Bergo M.O. J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 117: 1294-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). These phenotypic consequences are consistent with loss of Rho GTPase function but additionally suggest that multiple GGTase-I substrates are important for regulation of cell morphology and actin organization. Similarly, loss of GGTase-I activity was lethal in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and the combined expression of GGTase-I-independent, farnesylated variants of RhoA and Cdc42 suppressed this lethality (11Ohya Y.

Open table in a new tab Although the CAAX-signaled posttranslational modifications are necessary for Ras and Rho GTPase function and membrane association, these three modifications alone are not sufficient to promote full membrane association or to target the proteins to the specific cellular subdomains required for proper GTPase function (12Cox A.D. Der C.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 1008-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Instead, at least two distinct sequence elements positioned immediately upstream of the CAAX motif serve as additional signals that are required to promote efficient membrane association and biological function. One element is composed of clusters of polybasic amino acid residues, as seen in K-Ras4B, that provide a positive charge that facilitates association with acidic membrane-associated lipids. The second sequence element present upstream of CAAX in some Rho GTPases is one or two cysteine residues that undergo post-translational modification by the fatty acid palmitate. Palmitoylated cysteines comprise the additional targeting signal for H-Ras and N-Ras proteins as well as for some Rho family GTPases (RhoB and TC10). Mutant Ras proteins that undergo the CAAX-signaled modifications but lack either the polybasic residues or palmitoylated cysteine(s) are mislocalized and are significantly compromised in their biological activities. Finally, additional sequences flanking these elements form a largely uncharacterized third signal that also contributes to dictating the precise subcellular localization of Ras and Rho GTPases (13Willumsen B.M. Cox A.D. Solski P.A. Der C.J. Buss J.E. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1901-1909PubMed Google Scholar, 14Parton R.G. Hancock J.F.

Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 162-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These locations can vary significantly; whereas some Rho GTPases are found predominantly at the plasma membrane (e.g. Rac1), some are associated mainly with endomembranes (e.g. RhoH), and still others are associated with endosomes (e.g. RhoD) (Table 1).Because of the importance of CAAX-signaled modifications for small GTPase localization and function, farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs) were developed initially as anti-Ras therapies for cancer treatment. Unfortunately, K-Ras and N-Ras (the two Ras isoforms most commonly mutated in human cancers) undergo alternative prenylation by GGTase-I when in the presence of FTIs and therefore escape FTI-mediated inhibition of membrane association (16Rowell C.A. Kowalczyk J.J. Lewis M.D. Garcia A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14093-14097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 17Whyte D.B. Kirschmeier P. Hockenberry T.N.

Nevertheless, FTIs have exhibited anti-tumor activity in preclinical and clinical trial analyses, presumably due to the inhibition of function of other FTase substrates (8Sebti S.M. Der C.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In light of the role of aberrant Rho GTPase function in oncogenesis, Rho family GTPases (e.g. RhoB) are logical candidates for key targets of FTIs (18Prendergast G.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 166-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Although GGTase-I modifies the classical Rho GTPases, the nature of the CAAX sequences of other members suggests that they may be FTase substrates.The observation that K-Ras and N-Ras undergo alternative prenylation in response to FTI treatment has also stimulated interest in the development of inhibitors that block other enzymes that facilitate Ras membrane association. First, GGTase-I inhibitors (GGTIs) were developed to block the function of the alternatively prenylated Ras proteins (19Sebti S.M. Hamilton A.D. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6584-6593Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Furthermore, with increasing evidence for the involvement of normally geranylgeranylated proteins in cancer (e.g. Ral and Rho GTPases) (7Ridley A.J. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2004; 84: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 20Sahai E. Marshall C.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1215) Google Scholar), there is now additional interest in the development of GGTIs to target these GGTase-I substrates for cancer treatment. Second, efforts to develop inhibitors of Rce1 and Icmt as novel anti-cancer agents have recently intensified (9Winter-Vann A.M. Casey P.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). However, there is concern regarding their effectiveness, since Ras proteins that fail to undergo these two modifications do retain partial localization and function (21Kato K. Cox A.D. Hisaka M.M. Graham S.M. Buss J.E. Der C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6403-6407Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 22Michaelson D. Ali W. Chiu V.K. Bergo M. Silletti J. Wright L. Young S.G. Philips M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1606-1616Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Additionally, since many FTase and GGTase-I substrates are also substrates for these two enzymes, there is also concern that such inhibitors will affect a broad array of cellular proteins and cause significant cell toxicity in normal cells. Support for this latter concern is provided by the observed embryonic lethality in mice deficient in either Rce1 or Icmt. Whether similar toxicity would be seen in adult animals is an important area of investigation.In light of the essential function of Rho family GTPases in normal cell physiology and their aberrant activation in oncogenesis (7Ridley A.J. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2004; 84: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 20Sahai E. Marshall C.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1215) Google Scholar), establishing the sensitivity of Rho GTPases to FTI and GGTI inhibitors and the contribution of Rce1- and Icmt-catalyzed modifications to their cellular functions will be critical to the successful development of inhibitors of CAAX-signaled modifications. Therefore, we have utilized pharmacologic and genetic approaches to establish the importance of CAAX-signaled modifications for the functions of the less studied Rho GTPases. We found that, in contrast to the common perception based on the study of the classical Rho GTPases, farnesylation is a lipid modification that is equally important as geranylgeranylation for Rho GTPase function. Furthermore, we conclude that the rules governing palmitoylation of cysteine-containing signal sequences and even CAAX tetrapeptide prenyltransferase specificity derived from structural studies are imprecise and that experimental analyses are still required to establish the lipid modification status of a particular CAAX-terminating protein. Finally, our observations that Rho GTPase subcellular localization and/or function depend on Rce1 and/or Icmt enzymatic activity support the value of developing inhibitors of these two enzymes as therapeutic strategies to block Rho GTPase function.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExpression Constructs and Cell Culture Lipid Inhibitor Analyses—cDNAs for human Ras and Rho GTPases (H-Ras, K-Ras, RhoA, Rnd1, and Rnd2 and Rnd3, RhoD, RhoH, TC10, TCL, and Rif) and rat RhoB were cloned into pEGFP mammalian expression vectors (Clontech) as previously described (23Berzat A.C.

Colonies were allowed to form for 2 weeks, after which viable colonies were stained with 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide tetrazolium salt. Plates were scanned, and the number of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide-positive colonies was quantified using ImageJ software. Results for transformation assays are representative of at least three experiments from independently generated sets of stable cell lines.1-Biotinamido-4-(4′-(maleimidomethyl Cyclohexanecarboxamido) Butane (Biotin-BMCC) Labeling—Analyses of protein palmitoylation were done as described in Refs. 31Drisdel R.C.

Briefly, 293T cells were transfected with 7 μg of the indicated pEGFP construct using a calcium phosphate transfection technique. Forty-eight h after transfection, cells were lysed and incubated with 5 μg of anti-GFP monoclonal antibody (JL-8; Clontech) at 4 °C for 1 h, at which point 20 μg of protein G (Invitrogen) was added to the lysates and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. Bound protein was washed and incubated with lysis buffer containing 50 mm N-ethylmaleimide (Sigma) for 48 h at 4 °C. Bound protein was then washed and treated with 1 m hydroxylamine, pH 7.4, to cleave thioester bonds for 1 h at 25 °C, washed again, and treated with biotin-BMCC (Pierce), which recognizes free sulfhydryl groups, for 2 h at 25 °C. Bound protein was washed again, resuspended in 50 μl of 2 × sample loading buffer, resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Labeled protein was detected by incubation with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (Pierce), and the membrane was washed and exposed to x-ray film. Twenty μg of lysate was resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred, incubated with anti-GFP primary antibody and anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody, and exposed to x-ray film to verify the presence of each GFP-tagged protein.In Vitro Prenylation Analyses—Full-length human Rnd, RhoB, and TC10 proteins were expressed as fusion proteins containing six histidine residues at the amino terminus. The cDNA coding regions were amplified from appropriate cell lines by PCR and subcloned into the pQE bacterial expression vector (Qiagen). The identity of all plasmids was confirmed by restriction mapping and DNA sequencing of the PCR-amplified fragments. Six-histidine-tagged Rnd1, Rnd2, Rnd3, and TC10 were expressed and purified from Escherichia coli by nickel affinity chromatography, as we have described previously for Ras proteins (33Zhang F.L. Kirschmeier P. Carr D. James L. Bond R.W. Wang L. Patton R. Windsor W.T. Syto R. Zhang R. Bishop W.R. J. Biol.

Expression and purification of recombinant human FTase and GGTase-I from SF9 insect cells (∼50% pure) were performed as we have described elsewhere (33Zhang F.L. Kirschmeier P. Carr D. James L.

FTase and GGTase-I activity were determined by measuring the transfer of [3H]farnesyl or [3H]geranylgeranyl to the Rho GTPase substrate in reaction mixtures containing (in 200 μl) 50 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2. The concentration of recombinant FTase and GGTase-I was 0.5 μm, whereas the GTPase protein substrate concentrations were varied from 0 to 1.0 μm. Reactions were started by the addition of 20 ng of FTase or GGTase-I and proceeded for 4 min at 37 °C.Statistical Analysis—Data were analyzed by the use of Student's t test. In all analyses, p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant, and data are presented as mean ± S.D.RESULTSInhibition of Farnesyltransferase Blocks Rho Family GTPase Localization and Function—Substrate specificity of FTase and GGTase-I toward small GTPases is determined primarily by the sequence of the CAAX tetrapeptide motif (Table 1). Biochemical and structural studies of CAAX peptides in complex with FTase and GGTase-I have defined rules that govern substrate selectivity (34Reid T.S. Terry K.L. Casey P.J. Beese L.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 343: 417-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Whereas the specific isoprenoid modification of the classical Rho GTPases and of their highly related isoforms (RhoA/B/C, Rac1/2/3, and Cdc42) has been confirmed in vivo, the precise isoprenoid modification of the majority of Rho family GTPases has not been tested. Where studied, the prenylation of Ras and Rho small GTPases has been found to be essential for proper subcellular localization. Therefore, to determine the importance of farnesylation or geranylgeranylation to Rho GTPase localization, we ectopically expressed GFP-fusion Rho GTPase proteins to visualize their subcellular localization in live cells and determined the ability of treatment with the potent and highly selective FTI (FTI-2153) and/or GGTI (GGTI-2417) to alter their subcellular location (35Berzat A.C. Brady D.C. Fiordalisi J.J. Cox A.D. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 407: 575-597Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Exogenous expression of GFP fusion proteins has been used extensively to evaluate the subcellular localization of small GTPases and has been validated as an accurate reflection of the subcellular location of the endogenous protein (24Michaelson D.

For these analyses, we utilized wild-type (and therefore predominantly GDP-bound) human Rho GTPases to avoid potential complications in Rho GTPase localization due to effector association or to altered interaction with Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor proteins seen with the activated forms of some Rho GTPases (24Michaelson D.

To date, no biological substrate for class IIa HDACs has been identified, and only low activity on acetylated lysines has been demonstrated. Here, we describe inhibitor-bound and inhibitor-free structures of the histone deacetylase-4 catalytic domain (HDAC4cd) and of an HDAC4cd active site mutant with enhanced enzymatic activity toward acetylated lysines. The structures presented, coupled with activity data, provide the molecular basis for the intrinsically low enzymatic activity of class IIa HDACs toward acetylated lysines and reveal active site features that may guide the design of class-specific inhibitors. In addition, these structures reveal a conformationally flexible structural zinc-binding domain conserved in all class IIa enzymes. Importantly, either the mutation of residues coordinating the structural zinc ion or the binding of a class IIa selective inhibitor prevented the association of HDAC4 with the N-CoR·HDAC3 repressor complex.

Eukaryotic histone deacetylases (HDACs) 3The abbreviations used are: HDAChistone deacetylaseHDLPHDAC-like proteinHDAHHDAC-like amidohydrolaseMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidWTwild typeTFMKtrifluoromethylketoneHAhydroxamic acidGOFgain of functionDMSOdimethyl sulfoxide. were initially discovered in transcriptional repressor complexes, where they deacetylate acetylated lysines in histone N termini (1Cress W.D. Seto E. J. Cell Physiol. 2000; 184: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Histone deacetylation is thought to promote the tight histone-DNA interactions characteristic of nucleosomes in condensed chromatin, where access to DNA for processes including transcription, DNA repair, recombination, or replication is limited. More recently, HDACs have also been shown to deacetylate nonhistone proteins, predominantly transcription factors (2Ito A. Kawaguchi Y. Lai C.H. Kovacs J.J. Higashimoto Y. Appella E. Yao T.P. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6236-6245Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 3Glozak M.A. Sengupta N. Zhang X. Seto E. Gene (Amst.). 2005; 363: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar, 4Chen L.

Science. 2005; 307: 269-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Due to their critical role in regulation of chromatin structure and gene expression, HDACs have become major drug targets. Indeed, several HDAC inhibitors have entered clinical trials (6Bolden J.E. Peart M.J. Johnstone R.W. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2006; 5: 769-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2549) Google Scholar, 7Gallinari P. Di Marco S. Jones P. Pallaoro M. Steinkuhler C.

There are currently 18 known mammalian HDACs, grouped into four classes based on sequence similarity (8de Ruijter A.J. van Gennip A.H. Caron H.N. Kemp S. van Kuilenburg A.B. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 737-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (2494) Google Scholar). The class I, II, and IV HDACs are zinc-dependent enzymes, whereas class III HDACs (SIRT1-SIRT7) require NAD+ for activity. The class I HDACs (HDAC1, -2, -3, and -8) are ∼400 residues long and are generally nuclear, whereas the class II HDACs (HDAC4, -5, -6, -7, -9, and -10) exhibit nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. In turn, class II HDACs are subdivided into class IIa (HDAC4, -5, -7, and -9) and IIb (HDAC6 and -10). Class IIa enzymes are characterized by the presence of an N-terminal extension of ∼600 residues with distinct regulatory and functional properties, whereas the class IIb enzymes contain two catalytic domains (9Guo L. Han A. Bates D.L. Cao J. Chen L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 4297-4302Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 10Verdin E. Dequiedt F. Kasler H.G.

Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 2873-2884Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Class IV currently includes only HDAC11, which shares greatest sequence similarity to the class I enzymes. HDACs have been extensively studied, but the function of the class IIa enzymes is only partially understood. The most well characterized roles of class IIa HDACs are as transcriptional repressors, often resulting in the suppression of cellular hypertrophy (reviewed recently in Refs. 12McKinsey T.A. Kass D.A. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2007; 6: 617-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar and 13Martin M. Kettmann R. Dequiedt F. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 5450-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). For example, HDAC4 was shown to regulate chondrocyte hypertrophy and skeletogenesis, an activity at least partially exerted through a repressive interaction with the transcription factor RUNX2 (14Vega R.B. Matsuda K. Oh J. Barbosa A.C. Yang X. Meadows E. McAnally J. Pomajzl C. Shelton J.M. Richardson J.A. Karsenty G. Olson E.N.

Although RUNX2 has been implicated as a substrate for deacetylation by HDAC4 and -5 (16Jeon E.J. Lee K.Y. Choi N.S. Lee M.H. Kim H.N. Jin Y.H. Ryoo H.M. Choi J.Y. Yoshida M. Nishino N. Oh B.C.

Chem. 2006; 281: 16502-16511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), the involvement of a class IIa deacetylase activity has not been demonstrated. Further, HDAC4 was shown to form a complex with HDAC3 via N-CoR, but therein the catalytic domain of HDAC4 did not contribute to the enzymatic activity toward acetylated histone peptides (17Fischle W. Dequiedt F. Hendzel M.J. Guenther M.G. Lazar M.A. Voelter W. Verdin E. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 45-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Consistently, we recently reported that class IIa HDACs possess only weak, but measurable, lysine deacetylation activity in vitro (18Lahm A. Paolini C. Pallaoro M. Nardi M.C. Jones P. Neddermann P. Sambucini S. Bottomley M.J. Lo Surdo P. Carfi A. Koch U. De Francesco R. Steinkuhler C. Gallinari P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 17335-17340Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). For a long time, structural information on zinc-dependent HDAC catalytic domains has been limited to a bacterial HDAC-like protein (HDLP) resembling a class I enzyme (19Finnin M.S. Donigian J.R.

Schwienhorst A. Ficner R. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 354: 107-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 23Nielsen T.K. Hildmann C. Riester D. Wegener D. Schwienhorst A. Ficner R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2007; 63: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, recent progress includes the structures of a catalytically dead HDAC8 active site mutant bound to an acetyl-lysine peptidic substrate (24Vannini A. Volpari C. Gallinari P. Jones P. Mattu M. Carfi A. De Francesco R. Steinkuhler C. Di Marco S. EMBO Rep. 2007; 8: 879-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) and the class IIa HDAC7 catalytic domain (25Schuetz A. Min J. Allali-Hassani A. Schapira M. Shuen M. Loppnau P. Mazitschek R. Kwiatkowski N.P. Lewis T.A. Maglathin R.L. McLean T.H. Bochkarev A. Plotnikov A.N. Vedadi M. Arrowsmith C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 11355-11363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Here we report the crystal structures of the HDAC4 catalytic domain (HDAC4cd) and of an active site mutant (H976Y) with enhanced activity toward acetylated lysines, both in complexes with two different inhibitors. Moreover, we present the structure of an inhibitor-free HDAC4cd. These structures reveal a flexible structural zinc-binding domain conserved in all class IIa enzymes. Mutagenesis, activity, and binding data suggest a key role of this domain in substrate recognition and in the association of HDAC4 with the HDAC3·N-CoR co-repressor complex. In addition, the structures and accompanying activity data provide the molecular basis for the intrinsically low enzymatic activity of class IIa HDACs toward acetylated lysines and for the design of class-selective HDAC inhibitors. Protein Expression and Purification—The human HDAC4 catalytic domain (residues Thr648-Thr1057) was produced in Escherichia coli BL21 cells using the pETM-11 vector (EMBL Heidelberg) and was purified via a His6 tag later removed by a solubility-enhanced TEV protease (26van den Berg S. Lofdahl P.A. Hard T. Berglund H. J. Biotechnol. 2006; 121: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The complete expression and purification protocol is given in the supplemental materials. Deacetylation Assays—Deacetylation assays were performed as reported previously using either the “Fluor de Lys” acetamide substrate (BIOMOL International) or the trifluoroacetamide substrate (18Lahm A. Paolini C. Pallaoro M. Nardi M.C. Jones P. Neddermann P. Sambucini S. Bottomley M.J. Lo Surdo P. Carfi A. Koch U. De Francesco R. Steinkuhler C. Gallinari P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 17335-17340Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar), which both comprise an acetylated lysine side chain and a methyl-coumarin group. Deacetylation sensitizes the substrate so that treatment with the “Fluor de Lys” developer produces a fluorophore. Crystallization of the HDAC4 Catalytic Domain—Prior to crystallization screening of protein-inhibitor complexes, the HDAC4cd was incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with a 3-fold molar excess of inhibitor dissolved in DMSO. The synthesis of inhibitors used has been reported elsewhere (27Jones P. Bottomley M.J. Carfi A. Cecchetti O. Ferrigno F. Lo Surdo P. Ontoria J.M. Rowley M. Scarpelli R. Schultz-Fademrecht C. Steinkuhler C. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2008; 18: 3456-3461Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Crystals of protein-inhibitor complexes were obtained by the hanging drop vapor diffusion technique. Drops were mixed to contain 1 μl each of protein-inhibitor complex at 6-8 mg/ml and reservoir solution containing 1.6 m ammonium sulfate, 0.1 m MES buffer, pH 6.5, 10% dioxane, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Crystals of HDAC4cd-inhibitor complexes grew after 2 days of equilibration at 18 °C. The wild type (WT) crystals belonged to the C2221 space group with one molecule per asymmetric unit, whereas the cysteine-mutant crystals belonged to the P21 space group with two molecules per asymmetric unit. The two crystal forms have an almost identical crystal packing; the noncrystallographic 2-fold axis relating two HDAC4cd molecules in the P21 space group becomes crystallographic in the C2221 space group (Table S1). After preincubating the protein with a molar excess of substrate for 30 min at 4 °C, crystals of the inhibitor-free “gain of function mutant” (GOF) HDAC4cd protein were obtained in 6-8 h. Crystals were not obtained if substrate was omitted. The inhibitor-free crystals grew in 0.1 m Hepes, pH 7.5, 18% polyethylene glycol 10,000, 1 mm dithiothreitol. Data Collection, Structure Determination, and Refinement—X-ray diffraction data were collected at the ID14, BM30, and ID29 beam lines at ESRF (Grenoble, France) from single crystals flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Data were indexed and integrated with MOSFLM (28Leslie A.G.W. Joint CCP4 + ESF-EAMCB Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1992; 26Google Scholar). The CCP4 program suite (29CCP4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar) was used for further data processing and analysis. The structure of WT HDAC4cd-trifluoromethylketone (TFMK) complex was solved by the single anomalous dispersion method. A 2.5 Å resolution data set was collected at the absorption peak for zinc as determined by x-ray fluorescence. The position of the zinc ion was located in an anomalous Patterson map. A combination of single anomalous dispersion phasing and electron density modification as implemented in CNX (Accelrys Software Inc.) yielded an interpretable electron density map. Several cycles of model building in Coot (30Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar) and positional restrained refinement in REFMAC (29CCP4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar) allowed building of the entire model, excepting the N- and C-terminal regions Thr648-Pro650 and Glu1051-Thr1057. The structures of the complex with the HA and of the other HDAC4cd mutants were solved by molecular replacement with Phaser (29CCP4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar), using as a search model the refined WT HDAC4cd-TFMK complex after removal of the inhibitor, side chains of active site residues, and loops containing residues involved in binding the structural zinc ion. When the data resolution was better than 2.5 Å, the electron density maps were improved using Arp/Warp in Molrep mode (31Perrakis A. Harkiolaki M. Wilson K.S. Lamzin V.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1445-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). All of the structures were refined using restrained positional refinement, isotropic B-factor refinement, and bulk solvent correction with a maximum likelihood target as implemented in REFMAC. Structure quality and Ramachandran statistics were assessed using Molprobity (32Davis I.W. Murray L.W. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W615-W619Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar); images were prepared with PyMol (DeLano Scientific LLC). Iodoacetamide Alkylation Protection Experiments—Alkylation reaction experiments were performed by incubating 20 μm WT HDAC4cd in buffer containing 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 0.1% n-octyl-β-glucopyranoside with 200 μm iodoacetamide in the dark for 1 h at room temperature. Following the reaction, excess iodoacetamide was removed by dialysis. Prior to analysis by mass spectrometry, 10-μg aliquots of the alkylated HDAC4 samples and nonalkylated HDAC4 controls were incubated overnight at 37 °C with 0.4 μg of trypsin in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0, in 30 μl. Subsequently, 1 μl of each sample was mixed with 1 μl of matrix solution (cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in CH3CN plus 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (10 mg/ml)) and loaded directly onto the matrix for analysis by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight spectrometry. In the alkylated and digested WT HDAC4cd sample, we observed that the peptide containing both Cys667 and Cys669 had reacted with two molecules of iodoacetamide. Likewise, a peptide containing Cys751 had reacted with one molecule of iodoacetamide. We did not identify a Cys667/Cys669-containing peptide that had reacted with only one alkylated group. In addition, we found that cysteines buried in the structure were not alkylated. These results suggest that in solution, Cys667 and Cys669 are both exposed to the alkylating agent, and thus neither is protected by binding to the zinc ion. Mammalian Cell Expression of Full-length HDAC4-FLAG—HEK293 cells, maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) with mammalian pcDNA3 expression plasmids encoding full-length, C-terminal FLAG-tagged, wild type or doubly mutated (C669A/H675A) HDAC4 proteins. Cells were harvested after 24 h, as described previously (18Lahm A. Paolini C. Pallaoro M. Nardi M.C. Jones P. Neddermann P. Sambucini S. Bottomley M.J. Lo Surdo P. Carfi A. Koch U. De Francesco R. Steinkuhler C. Gallinari P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 17335-17340Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). The double mutation was introduced using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). To investigate the effects of a cell-permeable HDAC4 inhibitor, HEK293 cells were stably transfected to enable the doxycyclin-inducible expression of full-length HDAC4-FLAG, as described previously (33Illi B.

Cells were maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and, when 90% confluent, were induced with 1 μg/ml doxycyclin 20 h prior to the addition of inhibitor. A cell-permeable trifluoromethylketone inhibitor closely resembling the co-crystallized TFMK was added to the medium at 10 μm final concentration for 4 h, after which cells were harvested. Immunoprecipitation of HDAC4-FLAG and Analysis of Its Association with N-CoR·HDAC3—All cells were harvested in ice-cold PBS, homogenized, and sonicated in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.25 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 250 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), followed by a 1-h incubation at 4 °C. Soluble whole-cell extracts were obtained by centrifugation. HDAC4-F protein complexes were immunoprecipitated on anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) and eluted in buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, and 0.01% Triton X-100 in the presence of 100 mg/ml 3× FLAG peptide (Sigma). Purified HDAC4-F wild type and mutant protein concentrations were normalized via a Western blot developed using an anti-FLAG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody. Finally, the co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous HDAC3 with HDAC4-FLAG was evaluated by Western blotting using a rabbit anti-HDAC3 antibody and developed using an anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Upstate Biotechnology). Identification of Novel HDAC4 Inhibitors—We previously found that HDAC4 had only marginal activity against acetylated lysine-containing peptides, whereas an active site mutant (H976Y), which we refer to as the GOF HDAC4, was active on these molecules (18Lahm A. Paolini C. Pallaoro M. Nardi M.C. Jones P. Neddermann P. Sambucini S. Bottomley M.J. Lo Surdo P. Carfi A. Koch U. De Francesco R. Steinkuhler C. Gallinari P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 17335-17340Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Moreover, we discovered one molecule, a trifluoroacetamide, on which both full-length and the catalytic domain of HDAC4 were highly active when tested in the same deacetylation assay previously reported. In contrast, this compound was a poor substrate for class I and IIb HDACs, including HDAC1, -3, and -6 (18Lahm A. Paolini C. Pallaoro M. Nardi M.C. Jones P. Neddermann P. Sambucini S. Bottomley M.J. Lo Surdo P. Carfi A. Koch U. De Francesco R. Steinkuhler C. Gallinari P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 17335-17340Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar) and the GOF HDAC4cd (Fig. 1, A and B). Within a medicinal chemistry effort, we have now identified two compounds that inhibit HDAC4 in the hydrolysis of the trifluoroacetamide substrate with IC50 values in the nanomolar range (Fig. 1, B and C). The two inhibitors have identical scaffolds but differ in their zinc-chelating groups: a hydroxamic acid (HA) or a TFMK. The inhibitory potency of these molecules on the GOF HDAC4 mutant was also evaluated using an acetamide version of the same substrate (Fig. 1, B and C). Structure Determination of Inhibitor-bound HDAC4 Catalytic Domains—To gain structural insights into class IIa HDACs and the mechanism of their inhibition, we crystallized the WT and GOF HDAC4cds in complex with the TFMK and HA inhibitors. The four complexes crystallized in the same conditions and gave similar crystals (see Table S1). We initially solved the structure of the WT HDAC4cd-TFMK complex by the single anomalous dispersion method. This structure was then used as the starting model to solve and refine all the structures reported here (see “Experimental Procedures”). Global Structure Description—The HDAC4cd-inhibitor complex structures are essentially identical (Cα coordinate root mean square deviation ∼0.3 Å) except for differences in the interactions with inhibitors. The HDAC4cd core exhibits a layered α-β-α fold, with a central parallel β-sheet of eight β-strands (Fig. 2A) and overall is similar to HDAC8 (Cα coordinate root mean square deviation 2.2 Å). The catalytic zinc ion, located in the center of the catalytic domain, is bound by the inhibitors (see Fig. S1). In addition, as observed in HDAC8, two potassium ions are proximal to the active site, coordinated by residues largely conserved among HDACs (Figs. 2A and 3) (20Somoza J.R. Skene R.J.

The first segment forms a 17-amino acid loop (Lα1-α2) and contributes three zinc ligands: His665, Cys667, and His678 (Fig. 2 and Table S2). The second segment is a 35-residue insertion (α6-α7-β3-β4) forming a helix-turn-helix motif followed by a β-hairpin containing at its tip a fourth zinc ligand, Cys751. Notably, these four zinc ligands are strictly conserved in all class IIa enzymes but are absent in other HDACs (Fig. 3). The presence of the structural zinc-binding domain and additional differences in loop structures result in HDAC4 having a more accessible active site than HDAC8 or HDAH (Fig. 2, A-C). Moreover, the water-filled tunnel proposed to enable release of the acetate reaction product in HDAC8, HDLP, and HDAH is not formed (19Finnin M.S. Donigian J.R. Cohen A. Richon V.M. Rifkind R.A.

Analysis of the crystal packing revealed that an intermolecular disulfide bond had formed between Cys669, lying within the structural zinc-binding domain (Fig. 2), and Cys700 from a neighboring molecule. To exclude the possibility that disulfide formation might have affected the interaction of the inhibitors with active site residues, we also solved the structures of WT and GOF HDAC4cd containing either a C669A/C700A double mutation or a C700A single mutation in complex with the inhibitors. The structures of the mutants were identical to those of the corresponding nonmutated WT and GOF proteins except for the structural zinc-binding domain that was now disordered (i.e. no electron density was observed). Therefore, we conclude that in the HDAC4cd-inhibitor complexes, this domain is flexible and that the intermolecular disulfide bond had previously locked it in place. Hereafter, for each of the WT and GOF inhibitor complexes, only the higher resolution structures are described, independently of the presence of cysteine mutations (Table S1). Analyses of the Inhibitor-bound HDAC4 Active Sites and Comparison with Class I and IIb HDACs—In the HDAC4cd structures, the inhibitors occupy the same position but establish different interactions with the zinc ion. In the complex with the TFMK, the inhibitor is in its hydrated form and employs both oxygens for coordinating the catalytic zinc ion (Fig. 4A and Table S2). Notably, NMR analyses showed that the TFMK is already 70-90% hydrated in solution (27Jones P. Bottomley M.J. Carfi A. Cecchetti O. Ferrigno F. Lo Surdo P. Ontoria J.M. Rowley M. Scarpelli R. Schultz-Fademrecht C. Steinkuhler C. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2008; 18: 3456-3461Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In contrast, in the WT HDAC4cd-HA complex, the inhibitor binds the catalytic zinc ion in a monodentate fashion, with its carbonyl oxygen replacing one of the TFMK-OH groups and a zinc-bound water molecule (W1 in Fig. 4A and Table S2) substituting the other. In the two complexes, the trifluoromethyl group of the TFMK and the hydroxyl group of the HA point toward a pocket formed by Pro800, Gly811, Phe812, Glu973, and Gly974. In particular, the trifluoromethyl group makes van der Waals contacts with the Pro800 pyrrolidine ring (Fig. 4). The residues composing this pocket are largely conserved among class II HDACs. However, a similar pocket is also formed in HDAC8 (class I) despite the sequence differences and lack of proline residues (Fig. 3). This is achieved through replacement of the HDAC4 Pro800 side chain with the indole ring of HDAC8 Trp141 and a different arrangement of the HDAC8 polypeptide chain in the region corresponding to HDAC4 residues Arg798-Gly801 (Fig. 4B). This region is relatively well conserved among class I HDACs, but Trp141 is replaced by Leu in HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3, probably resulting in a larger pocket (Figs. 3 and 4B). An additional difference between HDAC8, HDLP, and HDAH and the inhibitor-bound HDAC4cd"

https://openalex.org/W2014534488,"In order to understand the origin of superconductivity, it is crucial to ascertain the nature and origin of the primary carriers available to participate in pairing. Recent quantum oscillation experiments on high Tc cuprate superconductors have revealed the existence of a Fermi surface akin to normal metals, comprising fermionic carriers that undergo orbital quantization. However, the unexpectedly small size of the observed carrier pocket leaves open a variety of possibilities as to the existence or form of any underlying magnetic order, and its relation to d-wave superconductivity. Here we present quantum oscillations in the magnetisation (the de Haas-van Alphen or dHvA effect) observed in superconducting YBa2Cu3O6.51 that reveal more than one carrier pocket. In particular, we find evidence for the existence of a much larger pocket of heavier mass carriers playing a thermodynamically dominant role in this hole-doped superconductor. Importantly, characteristics of the multiple pockets within this more complete Fermi surface impose constraints on the wavevector of any underlying order and the location of the carriers in momentum space. These constraints enable us to construct a possible density-wave scenario with spiral or related modulated magnetic order, consistent with experimental observations."

Previous experiments have investigated the role of CA in coral calcification, mainly by pharmacological approaches. This study reports the molecular cloning, sequencing, and immunolocalization of a CA isolated from the scleractinian coral Stylophora pistillata, named STPCA. Results show that STPCA is a secreted form of α-CA, which possesses a CA catalytic function, similar to the secreted human CAVI. We localized this enzyme at the calicoblastic ectoderm level, which is responsible for the precipitation of the skeleton. This localization supports the role of STPCA in the calcification process. In symbiotic scleractinian corals, calcification is stimulated by light, a phenomenon called “light-enhanced calcification” (LEC). The mechanism by which symbiont photosynthesis stimulates calcification is still enigmatic. We tested the hypothesis that coral genes are differentially expressed under light and dark conditions. By real-time PCR, we investigated the differential expression of STPCA to determine its role in the LEC phenomenon. Results show that the STPCA gene is expressed 2-fold more during the dark than the light.

One specific feature of calcification in symbiotic corals is that calcium carbonate deposition in skeleton is higher in light than in dark conditions. This phenomenon, called “light-enhanced calcification” (LEC), is due to the symbiosis that corals establish with their photosynthetic Dinoflagellates. Despite numerous studies performed on this symbiotic relationship, the mechanisms linking photosynthesis of the symbionts to coral calcification remain largely unknown (see review in Refs. 19Gattuso J.-P.

In this study, we have cloned, sequenced, and localized an α-CA from the coral Stylophora pistillata and then determined the differential gene expression between light and dark to generate more information on the function of CA in coral calcification and in the light-enhanced calcification phenomenon. Our results allow us to propose a model to explain the role of CA in the coral calcification process. Biological Materials—Experiments were conducted in the laboratory on the branching symbiotic scleractinian coral S. pistillata (Esper, 1797). Colonies were stored in a 300-liter aquarium, supplied with seawater from the Mediterranean Sea (exchange rate 2% h-1) under controlled conditions: semi-open circuit, temperature of 26.0 ± 0.2 °C, salinity of 38.2 psu, light of 175 μmol photons m-2 s-1 (using the fluorescent tube Custom Sea Life®) on a 12:12 photoperiod. Lighting-on occurred at 9:00 AM. Corals were fed three times weekly with a mix of Artemia salina nauplii, A. salina frozen adults, and frozen krill. RNA Extraction—Extractions of RNA were performed at 12:00 AM for the light condition and at 12:00 PM for the dark condition, because we have previously shown that calcification rates were stable in the light and dark with a 2.6-fold enhancement of calcification rates in light (21Moya A. Tambutté S. Tambutté E. Zoccola D. Caminiti N. Allemand D. J. Exp. Biol. 2006; 209: 3413-3419Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Total RNAs were extracted with Trizol® reagent (Invitrogen) according to the Chomczynski method (22Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63190) Google Scholar), which was slightly modified (23Moya A. Tambutté S. Béranger G. Gaume B. Scimeca J.C. Allemand D. Zoccola D. Marine Biotechnol. 2008; 10.1007/s10126-008-9101-1Google Scholar). Briefly, five grams of coral apexes were ground into powder in a cryogrinder (Freezer/Mill 6770, Spex Sample Prep®) and dissolved in 20 ml of Trizol® reagent. Three centrifugations (10 min, 15,000 × g, 4 °C) were performed. 4 ml of chloroform were added to the last supernatant and incubated 2–3 min at room temperature. A centrifugation (15 min, 12,000 × g, 4 °C) allowed separation of two phases, an aqueous phase and a phenol-chloroform phase. The aqueous phase, containing RNA, was subjected to a second chloroform extraction (v/v). 10 ml of isopropyl alcohol were added to the second aqueous phase, vigorously shaken, and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. A centrifugation (15 min, 12,000 × g, 4 °C) permitted the pelleting of the RNA. This pellet was washed in 5 ml of ethanol (70%), centrifuged (5 min, 7500 × g, 4 °C), dried 10 min at room temperature, and then resuspended in 100–200 μl of RNase-free water (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). The RNA sample was finally centrifuged (20,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C) to remove the last contaminants. DNase treatment of samples was performed to avoid genomic DNA contamination (Turbo DNA-free™ kit, Ambion). For real-time PCR experiments, mRNA from each sample was purified using the mRNA isolation kit (Roche Applied Sciences) according to the instructions of the supplier. Moreover, we performed control PCR reactions with non-reverse-transcribed samples and achieved negative results to confirm the absence of DNA contamination (results not shown). cDNA Synthesis, PCR Amplification, Cloning, and Sequencing—Reverse transcription was performed using 50 units μl-1 RTIII Superscript (Invitrogen) according to the instructions of the supplier on 2 μg of DNase-treated (Turbo DNA-free™ kit) RNA with an oligo(dT) primer for the cloning of carbonic anhydrase and on 200 ng of mRNA using random hexamer primers for real-time PCR experiments. PCR amplification was carried out using Platinium TaqDNA polymerase (Invitrogen) and degenerate primers: forward (5′-CAGTTNCAYTTYCAYTGGGG-3′) designed for the conserved Q(L/F)HFHWG region, and reverse (5′-ACCRASCACWGCCARGCC-3′) designed for the conserved PDGLAVLG region. The PCR amplification product was ligated into a plasmid vector (pGEM-T easy vector system II, Promega). Competent cells Escherichia coli were transformed and plated on LB/ampicillin plates spread with x-gal and isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. White colonies were subcultured and screened for the presence of the correct insert. DNA sequencing of three independent clones was carried out on both strands with SP6 and T7 primer sequences by Macrogen, Inc. To obtain the 5′- and 3′-ends of the sequence, rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) experiments were performed using the primers SP2 (5′-TGAGCTCTTCCTTGGTAAACAC-3′) and SP3 (5′-AAATTTTCTTCCACCGACCTG-3′) for 5′-RACE and SP4 (5′-GCGGTTCAGAGCATCAGGTC-3′) and SP5 (5′-TGTACACTGCAATGCGGAAAAG-3′) for 3′-RACE. Both ends were cloned in pGEM-T easy vector and sequenced as mentioned above. Sequence and Phylogenetic Analyses—BLASTX analyses were conducted on the NCBI server in the GenBank™ data base. The signal peptide presence was determined using the server SignalP-3 (24Emanuelsson O. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Nielsen H. Nat. Protocols. 2007; 2: 953-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (2625) Google Scholar)). Phosphorylation and glycosylation prediction analyses were performed on the Centre for Biological Sequence analysis prediction server (25Blom N. Gammeltoft S. Brunak S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1351-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (2525) Google Scholar). GPI (glycosylphosphatidylinositol) modification site prediction was performed using both the big-PI predictor (26Eisenhaber B. Bork P. Eisenhaber F. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 741-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar) and DGPI servers, and the presence of the transmembrane domain was performed using the Tmpred (27Hofmann K. Stoffel W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 374: 166Google Scholar) and NPS servers. The alignments of carbonic anhydrase amino acid sequences were performed with ClustalW in MEGA 3.1. A phylogenetic tree was constructed with both the Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Bayesian methods. The best-fitting model of protein sequence evolution was selected using ProtTest 1.3 (28Abascal F. Zardoya R. Posada D. Bioinformatics. 2005; 21: 2104-2105Crossref PubMed Scopus (2536) Google Scholar) among a set of 53 candidate models constituted through all combinations of the empirical amino acid substitution matrices (JTT, mtREV, mtMam, mtArt, Dayhoff, WAG, rtREV, cpREV, Blosum62, and VT) with a gamma distribution with four rate categories, a proportion of invariable sites (+I), and observed amino acid frequencies (+F). All statistical criteria selected WAG+G+F as the best-fitting model, with WAG+I+G +F coming a close second. To check for concordance of the results, Phyml with either a BIONJ (29Guindon S. Gascuel O. Syst. Biol. 2003; 52: 696-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (14250) Google Scholar) or a Bayesian (30Huelsenbeck Ronquist Bioinformatics. 2001; 17: 754-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (19269) Google Scholar) defined starting tree were used to obtain ML trees under a concatenated model assuming the WAG amino acid substitution matrix model and the parameter values previously estimated by ProtTest. The ML bootstrap proportion was obtained after 100 (MrBAYES and BIONJ) bootstrap replicates. Bayesian inferences were performed with MrBayes v3.1.2. Each Bayesian analysis used 4 Metropolis-coupled Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMCMC). Bayesian posterior probabilities were obtained from the majority rule consensus of the tree sampled after the initial burn-in period, as determined by checking the convergence of likelihood values across MCMCMC generations. 1,000,000 MCMCMC generations with sampling every 100 generations were run under the WAG+G+F model. Synthesis of a Specific Antibody—Synthesis of peptide antigen and production of antiserum were performed by Eurogentec. The peptide (H2N-RDP EGP DTW KHH YKD C-COOH) corresponds to the N-terminal sequence of the protein with the peptide signal removed. Briefly, the peptide with Freund's complete adjuvant and coupled to KLH (keyhole limpet hemocyanin) was injected intraperitoneally into two rabbits to elicit an immune response. Prior to injection, a blood sample from each rabbit was collected to serve as control preimmune serum. Every 2 weeks, rabbits were boosted with the same amount of antigen. Three months after the initial injections, the final bleeds containing the specific antibody against the carbonic anhydrase from S. pistillata, anti-STPCA, were collected, divided into aliquots, and stored at -20 °C for further immunological analyses. Immunolocalization with Anti-STPCA—Apexes of colonies were prepared for immunolocalization as described previously by Puverel et al. (31Puverel S. Tambutte E. Zoccola D. Domart-Coulon I. Bouchot A.

Briefly, apexes of S. pistillata were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde in S22 buffer (450 mmol liter-1 NaCl, 10 mmol liter-1 KCl, 58 mmol liter-1 MgCl2, 10 mmol liter-1 CaCl2, 100 mmol liter-1 Hepes, pH 7.8) at 4 °C overnight and then decalcified using 0.5 mol liter-1 EDTA in Ca-free S22 at 4 °C. They were then dehydrated in an ethanol series and embedded in Paraplast. Cross-sections (7-μm thick) were cut and mounted on silane-coated glass slides. Immunolocalization was performed according to the protocol previously described by Puverel et al. (31Puverel S. Tambutte E. Zoccola D. Domart-Coulon I. Bouchot A. Lotto S. Allemand D. Tambutte S. Coral Reefs. 2005; 24: 149-156Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Briefly, deparaffinized sections of tissues were incubated for 1 h in saturating medium (1% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% teleostean gelatin, 0.05% Tween 20 in 0.05 mol liter-1 phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4) at room temperature. The samples were then incubated with the anti-STPCA or the preimmune serum as primary antibodies (1:200 dilution, 1 h at room temperature and overnight at 4 °C in moist chambers). After rinsing in saturating medium, samples were incubated with biotinylated anti-rabbit antibodies (Amersham Biosciences 1:250 dilution, 1 h at room temperature) as secondary antibodies. After rinsing with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, samples were finally stained for 20 min with streptavidin AlexaFluor 568 (Molecular Probes, 1:50 dilution) and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, DAPI (Sigma, 2 μg ml-1). Samples were embedded in Pro-Long antifade medium (Molecular Probes) and observed with a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Leica, TCS4D). Expression of STPCA in HEK 293 Cells—PCR products were prepared from oligo(dT) RT coral cDNAs and cloned into pIRES-DSRED mammalian expression vector (Clontech, Inc). The PCR reaction was carried out with the following primers: forward: (5′-CTAGCTAGCTAGACCATGAAACTCTCCCTATT-3′) and reverse (5′-TCCCCCGGGGGATCAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGCGATCCTCTTTGGAAGCTTCGGATGACAG-3′). The recombinant vector STPCAORFHIS contains a chimeric sequence encoding the open reading frame of the STPCA fused to a polyhistidine region at the C terminus. After sequencing, the plasmid clone was introduced into HEK 293 cells with the Lipofectamine transfection reagent (Invitrogen). A positive clone (HEK-STPCA), obtained by limiting dilution, was used to produce STPCA. Purification of Recombinant STPCA—When the HEK-STPCA cells were 70–80% confluent, the supplemented DMEM was replaced with serum-free DMEM; medium was harvested 7 days later. Then, the supernatant of culture medium was loaded onto a Ni-NTA-agarose column, to which the His6 tag of the recombinant protein would bind. The Ni-NTA-agarose column was washed with wash buffer (20 mm imidazole, 300 mm NaCI, 50 mm NaH2PO4, and 0,05% Tween 20, pH 8.0), and the His6-tagged protein was eluted with the elution buffer (200 mm imidazole, 300 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaH2PO4, and 0,05% Tween 20, pH 8.0). The removal of imidazole was accomplished by concentration of eluted protein, then diluting the retentate with phosphate-buffered saline using a Centricon Plus Centrifugal Filter unit (5,000 MW cutoff). The process was repeated four times. At the end of the process, the retentate was collected, and protein concentration was measured using a Qubit kit assay (Invitrogen). Deglycosylation Experiment and Western Blotting—Recombinant STPCA was incubated overnight at 37 °C in 250 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm 1,10-phenanthroline, 0.5% Nonidet P40, 0.25% SDS, 50 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, with or without N-glycosidase F (Roche Applied Science). Then, proteins were subjected to 5–12% SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. To verify protein expression, blots were probed with the monoclonal mouse anti-histidine tag (Serotec, 1:1000 dilution) or anti-STPCA (1:3000 dilution) using the ECL Western blotting kit (Amersham Biosciences). For the anti-phosphorylation Western blot, anti-phosphoserine, anti-phosphothreonine, and anti-phosphotyrosine were supplied by Abcam®. CA Activity and Inhibition Assay—An Applied Photophysics stopped-flow instrument was used for assaying the CA-catalyzed CO2 hydration activity (32Khalifah R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 2561-2573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phenol red (at a concentration of 0.2 mm) was used as an indicator, working at the maximal absorbance of 557 nm, with 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.5) or Tris, pH 8.3 as buffer, and 20 mm Na2SO4 or 20 mm NaCl (for maintaining constant ionic strength), following the CA-catalyzed CO2 hydration reaction for a period of 10–100 s. The CO2 concentrations ranged from 1.7 to 17 mm for the determination of the kinetic parameters and inhibition constants. For each inhibitor, at least six traces of the initial 5–10% of the reaction were used for determining the initial velocity. The uncatalyzed rates were determined in the same manner and subtracted from the total observed rates. Stock solutions of inhibitor (1 mm) were prepared in distilled-deionized water with 10–20% (v/v) DMSO (which is not inhibitory at these concentrations), and dilutions up to 0.01 nm were done thereafter with distilled-deionized water. Inhibitor and enzyme solutions were preincubated together for 15 min at room temperature prior to the assay, to allow for the formation of the E-I complex. The inhibition constants were obtained by non-linear least-squares methods using PRISM 3 from Lineweaver-Burk plots, as reported earlier, and represent the mean from at least three different determinations. Real-time PCR Experiments—Real-time PCR was performed on the following genes of S. pistillata: STPCA (cloned in the present study, GenBank™ accession no. EU159467), STP36B4 (Ref. 23Moya A. Tambutté S. Béranger G. Gaume B. Scimeca J.C. Allemand D. Zoccola D. Marine Biotechnol. 2008; 10.1007/s10126-008-9101-1Google Scholar, GenBank™ accession no. EU069460), and β-actin (Ref. 33Zoccola D. Tambutté E. Kulhanek E. Puverel S. Scimeca J.C. Allemand D. Tambutté S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1663: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, accession no. AY360081). Specific primers of STPCA: forward (5′-GGACATACCGTTCAGGCGACTTTT-3′) and reverse (5′-TTTCTTCCACCGACCTGATGCTCT-3′); STP36B4: forward (5′-ATGCAGCAAATCCGTCAGTCTCT-3′) and reverse (5′-TGGCCTTTCTTATCATGGTGTTCT-3′); and β-actin: forward (5′-GACTTGGCCGGCAGGGACTTA-3′) and reverse (5′-GCTCGGCGGTTGTGGTGAAA-3′) were designed using the software Primer express (PerkinElmer/Applied Biosystems Divisions). PCR efficiency was calculated according to the equation E = 10-1/slope - 1 where maximal efficiency, E = 1 (100%), means that every single template is replicated in each cycle. Real-time PCR was performed using the Prism 7300 sequence detector and 2× SYBR® Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems Divisions) in triplicate in a 96-well optical plate (PerkinElmer/Applied Biosystems Divisions) in 20:5 μl of cDNA (diluted 1:10), 0.2 μl each of primers (10 μm), 10 μl of Mix SYBRgreen, and 4.6 μl of RNase-free water. PCR was performed with the following PCR parameters: 50 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 10 min, then 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 1 min for 40 cycles plus a dissociation step (60–95 °C). RNA transcription levels were determined by the method of direct comparison of CT values between target (STPCA) and reference (STP36B4 and β-actin) genes (23Moya A. Tambutté S. Béranger G. Gaume B. Scimeca J.C. Allemand D. Zoccola D. Marine Biotechnol. 2008; 10.1007/s10126-008-9101-1Google Scholar) and relative quantities calculated by the ΔΔCT equation with the light value as calibrator. Finally, data were transformed into linear form by 2-ΔΔCT (34Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (124899) Google Scholar). Data representative of four independent experiments are presented. Statistical analysis was performed using a Student's t test (Software Jump 5.1, Cary, NC). Results are considered statistically significant when p < 0.05. Cloning of a Carbonic Anhydrase from the Coral S. pistillata—PCR using degenerate primers provided a S. pistillata partial sequence. A GenBank™ comparison using BLASTX confirmed that the partial sequence derived from S. pistillata corresponds to a carbonic anhydrase. RACE experiments were used to obtain full-length cDNA. The complete sequence consists of 1542 bp long with a 972-nucleotide open reading frame beginning 97 nucleotides downstream from the 5′-end. This sequence codes for a protein of 324 amino acids and a calculated molecular mass of 36.6 kDa. The nucleotide sequence of the STPCA is available on the GenBank™ data base with accession number EU159467. Sequence Analysis—BLAST searches in GenBank™ reveal numerous significant alignments with vertebrate and invertebrate α-CA sequences. A conserved domain search on NCBI confirmed the presence of the carbonic anhydrase catalytic domain containing the three histidine residues essential for the zinc cofactor binding noted by an H in Fig. 1, and the thirty-three important amino acids involved in the hydrogen bond network noted by an asterisk in Fig. 1. A signal peptide is present in the STPCA sequence, with predicted cleavage between positions 23 and 24, indicating that the sequence is probably secreted or membrane-bound. Because no predicted GPI anchor and no transmembrane domain such as a hydrophobic α-helix or β-sheet could be detected, we suggest that the protein STPCA is a secreted form of CA. Other particular motifs are also present in the STPCA sequence: two N-glycosylation sites in positions 98 and 103, and seventeen predicted phosphorylation sites (10 serine, 5 threonine, and 3 tyrosine residues). Phylogenetic Tree of α-CA Sequences—ML and Bayesian method trees produced similar topologies. Bootstrap values for ML and MR Bayes are shown near the recurrent nodes in Fig. 2. Fifty-three sequences are included in this tree, rooting with the α-CA from the cyanobacterium Nostoc sp. (GenBank™ accession number BAB74628). The STPCA sequence groups with the sequences of two cnidarians: Nematostella vectensis and aposymbiotic larvae of Fungia scutaria. Immunolocalization—To localize the STPCA enzyme in coral, tissue sections were immunolabeled with the anti-STPCA antibody (Fig. 3). S. pistillata is a colonial coral characterized by the presence of numerous polyps, linked together by a common tissue usually referred to as the coenosarc. The tissue in contact with seawater is the oral whereas the tissue adjacent to the skeleton is the aboral tissue. The tissues consist of two epithelial layers named ectoderm and endoderm. The aboral ectoderm is a specialized tissue that is in contact with the skeleton. This calcium carbonate-producing cell layer is often referred to as the skeletogenic tissue, the calicoblastic ectoderm (for histology details see Refs. 31Puverel S. Tambutte E. Zoccola D.

Tambutté S. Coral Reefs. 2007; 26: 517-529Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Fig. 3A shows a section of S. pistillata tissue in the coenosarc region with the oral tissue facing the seawater and the aboral tissue facing the skeleton. Fig. 3B is a magnification of the aboral tissue and shows the labeling of the calicoblastic ectoderm. No staining was observed in controls using preimmune serum (Fig. 3C). Biochemical Characterization of the Carbonic Anhydrase—A recombinant form of the carbonic anhydrase was produced in HEK 293 cells. The chimeric form with a polyhistidine tag at the C terminus was harvested in the culture medium and purified on NTA beads. Then STPCA was submitted to N-glycanase (N-PGNase) and migrated on SDS-PAGE. A Western blot (Fig. 4A) with anti-STPCA or antihistidine tag was performed. The glycosylated protein possesses an apparent molecular mass of about 44 kDa, whereas the N-PGNase-treated protein is 36.6 kDa as predicted by the primary sequence. In the same manner, the recombinant STPCA was submitted to a Western blot with anti-phosphoserine, anti-phosphothreonine, or anti-phosphotyrosine. Results show that only serines are phosphorylated on the molecule (Fig. 4B). CA activity and inhibition assays were performed on the recombinant STPCA. The kinetic parameters for the CO2 hydration reaction by the STPCA, as well as for the human isoforms are shown in Table 1. The results show that the STPCA has a lower catalytic activity than hCAII, but of the same order of magnitude as that of the cytosolic isoform hCAI. In fact, this activity is very similar to the hCAVI, which is also a secreted isoform. As shown in Table 1, hCAI, hCAVI, and STPCA have a very similar kcat and a near-similar kcat/Km, close to 5.0 × 107 m-1 s-1. It may also be observed from the data of Table 1 that STPCA is highly inhibited by acetazolamide, similar to hCA II and hCAVI.TABLE 1Kinetic parameters for the CO2 hydration reaction Shown are kinetic parameters for the CO2 hydration reaction (32Khalifah R.G.

https://openalex.org/W2054040367,"Reward from a particular action is seldom immediate, and the influence of such delayed outcome on choice decreases with delay. It has been postulated that when faced with immediate and delayed rewards, decision makers choose the option with maximum temporally discounted value. We examined the preference of monkeys for delayed reward in an intertemporal choice task and the neural basis for real-time computation of temporally discounted values in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. During this task, the locations of the targets associated with small or large rewards and their corresponding delays were randomly varied. We found that prefrontal neurons often encoded the temporally discounted value of reward expected from a particular option. Furthermore, activity tended to increase with [corrected] discounted values for targets [corrected] presented in the neuron's preferred direction, suggesting that activity related to temporally discounted values in the prefrontal cortex might determine the animal's behavior during intertemporal choice."
https://openalex.org/W2037723816,"Measuring stress changes within seismically active fault zones has been a long-sought goal of seismology. One approach is to exploit the stress dependence of seismic wave velocity, and we have investigated this in an active source cross-well experiment at the San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth (SAFOD) drill site. Here we show that stress changes are indeed measurable using this technique. Over a two-month period, we observed an excellent anti-correlation between changes in the time required for a shear wave to travel through the rock along a fixed pathway (a few microseconds) and variations in barometric pressure. We also observed two large excursions in the travel-time data that are coincident with two earthquakes that are among those predicted to produce the largest coseismic stress changes at SAFOD. The two excursions started approximately 10 and 2 hours before the events, respectively, suggesting that they may be related to pre-rupture stress induced changes in crack properties, as observed in early laboratory studies."
https://openalex.org/W2144680438,"The threat of a pandemic outbreak of influenza virus A H5N1 has become a major concern worldwide. The nucleoprotein (NP) of the virus binds the RNA genome and acts as a key adaptor between the virus and the host cell. It, therefore, plays an important structural and functional role and represents an attractive drug target. Here, we report the 3.3-A crystal structure of H5N1 NP, which is composed of a head domain, a body domain, and a tail loop. Our structure resolves the important linker segments (residues 397-401, 429-437) that connect the tail loop with the remainder of the molecule and a flexible, basic loop (residues 73-91) located in an arginine-rich groove surrounding Arg150. Using surface plasmon resonance, we found the basic loop and arginine-rich groove, but mostly a protruding element containing Arg174 and Arg175, to be important in RNA binding by NP. We also used our crystal structure to build a ring-shaped assembly of nine NP subunits to model the miniribonucleoprotein particle previously visualized by electron microscopy. Our study of H5N1 NP provides insight into the oligomerization interface and the RNA-binding groove, which are attractive drug targets, and it identifies the epitopes that might be used for universal vaccine development."
https://openalex.org/W1964607399,"Structured RNAs embedded in the untranslated regions (UTRs) of messenger RNAs can regulate gene expression. In bacteria, control of a metabolite gene is mediated by the self-cleaving activity of a ribozyme embedded in its 5' UTR. This discovery has raised the question of whether gene-regulating ribozymes also exist in eukaryotic mRNAs. Here we show that highly active hammerhead ribozymes are present in the 3' UTRs of rodent C-type lectin type II (Clec2) genes. Using a hammerhead RNA motif search with relaxed delimitation of the non-conserved regions, we detected ribozyme sequences in which the invariant regions, in contrast to the previously identified continuous hammerheads, occur as two fragments separated by hundreds of nucleotides. Notably, a fragment pair can assemble to form an active hammerhead ribozyme structure between the translation termination and the polyadenylation signals within the 3' UTR. We demonstrate that this hammerhead structure can self-cleave both in vitro and in vivo, and is able to reduce protein expression in mouse cells. These results indicate that an unrecognized mechanism of post-transcriptional gene regulation involving association of discontinuous ribozyme sequences within an mRNA may be modulating the expression of several CLEC2 proteins that function in bone remodelling and the immune response of several mammals."
https://openalex.org/W2057723954,"Phospholipases A(2) (PLA(2)s) catalyze hydrolysis of fatty acids from the sn-2 position of phospholipids. Here we report the identification and characterization of a membrane-associated intracellular calcium-dependent, adipose-specific PLA(2) that we named AdPLA (adipose-specific phospholipase A(2)). We found that AdPLA was highly expressed specifically in white adipose tissue and was induced during preadipocyte differentiation into adipocytes. Clearance of AdPLA by immunoprecipitation significantly decreased PLA activity in white adipose tissue lysates but had no effect on liver lysates, where expression was hardly detectable. In characterizing AdPLA, we employed radiochemical assays with TLC analysis of the enzyme activity of lysates from COS-7 cells overexpressing AdPLA. For kinetic studies, we produced purified recombinant AdPLA for use in a lipoxidase-coupled spectrophotometric assay. AdPLA generated free fatty acid and lysophospholipid from phosphatidylcholine with a preference for hydrolysis at the sn-2 position. Although we found low but detectable lysophospholipase activity, AdPLA showed no significant activity against a variety of other lipid substrates. Calcium was found to activate AdPLA but was not essential for activity. Studies with known phospholipase inhibitors, including bromoenolactone, methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphate, AACOCF(3), 7,7-dimethyl-5,8-eicosadienoic acid, and thioetheramide, supported that AdPLA is a phospholipase. Mutational studies showed that His-23 and Cys-113 are critical for activity of AdPLA and suggested that AdPLA is likely a His/Cys PLA(2). Overall, although AdPLA is similar to other histidine phospholipases in pH and calcium dependence, AdPLA showed different characteristics in many regards, including predicted catalytic mechanism. AdPLA may therefore represent the first member of a new group of PLA(2)s, group XVI."

https://openalex.org/W2080148830,"TRAF6, a crucial adaptor molecule in innate and adaptive immunity, contains three distinct functional domains. The C-terminal TRAF domain facilitates oligomerization and sequence-specific interaction with receptors or other adaptor proteins. In conjunction with the dimeric E2 enzyme Ubc13-Uev1A, the N-terminal RING domain of TRAF6 functions as an E3 ubiquitin (Ub) ligase that facilitates its own site-specific ubiquitination through the generation of a Lys-63-linked poly-Ub chain. This modification does not cause its proteasomal degradation but rather serves as a scaffold to activate both the IKK and stress kinase pathways. Connecting the N-and C-terminal regions, the four internal zinc finger (ZF) motifs have yet to be functionally defined. In this study, we examined the role of the ZF domains in interleukin-1, lipopolysaccharide, and RANKL signaling by reconstitution of TRAF6-deficient cells with point mutations or deletions of these ZF motifs. Although ZF domains 2-4 are dispensable for activating IKK, p38, and JNK by interleukin-1 and lipopolysaccharide, the first ZF domain together with an intact RING domain of TRAF6 is essential for activating these pathways. Furthermore, TRAF6 autoubiquitination and its interaction with Ubc13 are dependent on ZF1 and an intact RING domain. Additionally, expression of TRAF6 lacking ZF2-4 in TRAF6-deficient monocytes rescues RANKL-mediated osteoclast differentiation and LPS-stimulated interleukin-6 production. These data provide evidence for the critical role of the Ub ligase activity of TRAF6, which is coordinated via the RING domain and ZF1 to supply the necessary elements in signaling by cytokines dependent upon TRAF6.

Following binding to their respective receptors, these ligands induce a cascade of signaling events leading to the activation of transcription factors, such as the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and AP1 (activator protein-1) family, through activation of upstream kinases, including inhibitor of κ-B kinase (IKK) and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family (i.e. p38, JNK, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase) (1Chung J.Y.

TRAF6 contains three major domains: 1) the C-terminal domain, which facilitates oligomerization and interaction with receptors and other adaptor proteins in a sequence-specific manner; 2) the N-terminal domain, which possesses a RING (really interesting new gene) motif that is found in a number of E3 Ub ligases; and 3) a series of four internal ZF motifs without an ascribed function that connect the N- and C-terminal regions. Biochemical reconstitution experiments have first indicated that the RING domain of TRAF6 is a Ub ligase that in conjunction with a dimeric Ub-conjugating enzyme complex (Ubc13-UeV1A) catalyzes the formation of a unique poly-Ub chain linked through Lys-63 of Ub.

Subsequently, we have recently demonstrated that a single point mutation in the RING domain (TRAF6-C70A) rendered TRAF6 incapable of rescuing IL-1 or RANKL (receptor activator of NF-κB ligand) signaling events in TRAF6-deficient cells (12Lamothe B.

Additionally, stable knockdown of Ubc13 in an osteoclast progenitor cell line impaired the ability of RANKL to cause TRAF6 ubiquitination, IKK and JNK activation, and osteoclast differentiation (13Lamothe B.

Furthermore, we have also identified Lys-124 as a major Ub Lys acceptor for TRAF6 autoubiquitination, and mutation of this site abolished TRAF6-mediated NEMO ubiquitination, TAK1 and IKK activation, NF-κB activation, and spontaneous osteoclast differentiation (12Lamothe B.

These data support the essential requirement of the RING-dependent Ub ligase activity for TRAF6 to function in cells. Although our studies have clearly demonstrated the critical requirement of the RING domain of TRAF6 and its Ub ligase activity for RANKL and to some extent for IL-1 signaling (12Lamothe B. Besse A. Campos A.D. Webster W.K. Wu H. Darnay B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 4102-4112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 13Lamothe B. Webster W.K. Gopinathan A. Besse A. Campos A.D. Darnay B.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 359: 1044-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), a previous report concluded that the RING domain is not required for its function (14Kobayashi N. Kadono Y. Naito A. Matsumoto K. Yamamoto T. Tanaka S. Inoue J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1271-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). However, in this report, large deletion mutants of the RING domain (and its ZF motifs) were employed to ascertain their function, whereas our reports used a single point mutation in the RING domain. Since these studies show conflicting results for the function of the TRAF6 RING and ZF domains in IL-1, LPS, and RANKL signaling, we decided to reevaluate the role of these domains. To circumvent the anomalies associated with large deletions, we generated point mutations in each of the four ZF motifs separately. Transient expression of these mutants in HEK293 cells indicated that an intact ZF2, -3, or -4, was not required for activating IKK and JNK. Moreover, in TRAF6-deficient MEFs stably expressing each of the ZF mutants, only a defective ZF1, like a defective RING mutant, could not rescue IKK activation and phosphorylation of IκBα after IL-1 stimulation. Likewise, an intact RING and ZF1 were also required for JNK and p38 activation in response to IL-1 and LPS or for IL-6 production in response to IL-1. Consistent with these data, only intact RING and ZF1 domains of TRAF6 were necessary and sufficient for its autoubiquitination and interaction with Ubc13. Furthermore, TRAF6 carrying an internal deletion of ZF2 to -4 was able to form a complex with NEMO and to rescue IKK, JNK, and p38 activation in response to IL-1 in TRAF6-deficient MEFs. Notably, expression of this deletion mutant of TRAF6 in TRAF6-deficient monocytes could also rescue either RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation or LPS-induced IL-6 secretion. In summary, we demonstrated that not only is the RING domain of TRAF6 required for its Ub ligase activity and biological function in the IL-1, LPS, and RANKL pathways, but also these studies highlight the significant utility of the first ZF domain of TRAF6 in its function.

The yeast cells were co-transformed with the indicated genes in pGAD-T7- and pGBK-T7-based plasmids. Following double selection on synthetic dextrose (SD) lacking Trp and Leu (SD-Trp-Leu), at least three separate colonies were then picked and spotted onto both SD-Trp-Leu and SD-Trp-Leu-His (with 5 mm 1, 2, 4-amino triazole) plates. The plates were incubated at 30 °C until growth appeared on the master plate (SD-Trp-Leu), typically within 2-3 days, and positive interaction was then determined by equivalent growth of colonies on SD-Trp-Leu-His plates. An Intact RING Domain and ZF1 of TRAF6 Are Required for IKKβ and JNK Activation in HEK293 Cells—TRAF6 is composed of an N-terminal RING domain followed by a series of ZF motifs and a C-terminal TRAF homology domain (Fig. 1A). Although considerable characterization of the C-terminal TRAF domain has been elucidated, recent biochemical and biological data have revealed that the N-terminal RING domain of TRAF6 belongs to a family of Ub ligases, also known as E3s. RING-type E3s contain an octet of Cys and His residues distinctly separated to constitute a novel zinc-binding domain, which coordinates two zinc ions in a unique “cross-brace” arrangement (Fig. 1B). Following the RING domain of TRAF6, there are five predicted classical ZF domains, of which four conform to the Cys2-His-Cys (C2HC) motif (Fig. 1C). We have previously shown that the Ub ligase activity of TRAF6 requires an intact RING domain by generating a mutant of TRAF6 in which the first Cys residue in its RING domain was mutated to Ala (TRAF6-C70A) (Fig. 1B) (12Lamothe B.

To investigate the functional role of the ZF domains of TRAF6 to activate signaling in cells, we respectively mutated the first two Cys residues to Ala in ZF1 (C135A/C140A; TRAF6-ZF1m), ZF2 (C164A/C167A; TRAF6-ZF2m), ZF3 (C189A/C192A; TRAF6-ZF3m), and ZF4 (C215A/C218A; TRAF6-ZF4m) (Fig. 1C). As an initial characterization of these mutations, we examined whether they could activate IKKβ and JNK by transient expression in HEK293 cells. Co-transfection of the FLAG-tagged TRAF6 mutants with HA-tagged IKKβ or HA-tagged JNK indicated that TRAF6-WT, TRAF6-ZF2m, TRAF6-ZF3m, and TRAF6-ZF4m, but not TRAF6-C70A or TRAF6-ZF1m, activated IKKβ (Fig. 1D) and JNK (Fig. 1E). These results suggest that an intact RING domain and ZF1 domain are critical for TRAF6 to activate IKK and JNK. An Intact ZF1 and RING Domain Are Critical for IL-1 and LPS Signaling in TRAF6-deficient MEFs—TRAF6 plays a critical role in IL-1 and LPS signaling, as indicated by loss of function in TRAF6-deficient MEFs (7Lomaga M.A. Yeh W.C.

Following IL-1 stimulation, only expression of TRAF6-WT, TRAF6-ZF2m, TRAF6-ZF3m, and TRAF6-ZF4m, but not TRAF6-C70A and TRAF6-ZF1m, were able to activate IKK, resulting in the phosphorylation of IκBα (Fig. 2A). Immunoblotting with an anti-FLAG antibody revealed that protein expression of TRAF6-ZF2m and TRAF6-ZF3m and to a lesser extent TRAF6-ZF4m was less than TRAF6-WT or the other mutants (Fig. 2A) but sufficient to induce significant IKK activation or phosphorylation of IκBα as compared with TRAF6-C70A or TRAF6-ZF1m. This difference in protein expression suggests that mutations in ZF domains 2-4 might affect the stability of the protein in the cells, since the level of GFP, which is expressed from the same transcript, was similar in each cell line (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, IL-1-induced JNK activation and phosphorylation of p38 was not rescued in cells expressing TRAF6-C70A or TRAF6-ZF1m as compared with TRAF6-WT (Fig. 2B). To examine whether the failure of TRAF6-C70A and TRAF6-ZF1m to rescue IKK and stress kinase activation would be translated to their inability to activate target genes, we measured IL-6 secretion by TRAF6-deficient MEFs expressing these mutants after IL-1 stimulation. Although expression of TRAF6-WT rescued IL-6 production by IL-1, TRAF6-C70A- and TRAF6-ZF1m-expressing cells showed impaired induction of IL-6 (Fig. 2C). Having established that an intact RING domain and ZF1 are required for IL-1 responsiveness, we next addressed whether these domains are also important"
https://openalex.org/W2000406786,"TAK1 (transforming growth factor-beta-activated kinase 1), a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase, is activated by various cytokines, including interleukin-1 (IL-1). However, the precise regulation for TAK1 activation at the molecular level is still not fully understood. Here we report that dual phosphorylation of Thr-178 and Thr-184 residues within the kinase activation loop of TAK1 is essential for TAK1-mediated NFkappaB and AP-1 activation. Once co-overexpressed with TAB1, TAK1 mutant with alanine substitution of these two residues fails to activate IKKbeta-mediated NFkappaB and JNK-mediated AP-1, whereas TAK1 mutant with replacement of these two sites with acidic residues acts like the TAK1 wild type. Consistently, TAK1 mutant with alanine substitution of these two residues severely inhibits IL-1-induced NFkappaB and AP-1 activities, whereas TAK1 mutant with replacement of these two sites with acidic residues slightly enhances IL-1-induced NFkappaB and AP-1 activities compared with the TAK1 wild-type. IL-1 induces the phosphorylation of endogenous TAK1 at Thr-178 and Thr-184. Reconstitution of TAK1-deficient mouse embryo fibroblast cells with wild-type TAK1 or a TAK1 mutant containing threonine 178 and 184 to alanine mutations revealed the importance of these two sites in IL-1-mediated IKK-NFkappaB and JNK-AP-1 activation as well as IL-1-induced IL-6 gene expression. Our finding is the first report that substitution of key serine/threonine residues with acidic residues mimics the phosphorylated state of TAK1 and renders TAK1 active during its induced activation."
https://openalex.org/W2020764867,"Deletion of the distal region of chromosome 1 frequently occurs in a variety of human cancers, including aggressive neuroblastoma. Previously, we have identified a 500-kb homozygously deleted region at chromosome 1p36.2 harboring at least six genes in a neuroblastoma-derived cell line NB1/C201. Among them, only KIF1Bβ, a member of the kinesin superfamily proteins, induced apoptotic cell death. These results prompted us to address whether KIF1Bβ could be a tumor suppressor gene mapped to chromosome 1p36 in neuroblastoma. Hemizygous deletion of KIF1Bβ in primary neuroblastomas was significantly correlated with advanced stages (p = 0.0013) and MYCN amplification (p < 0.001), whereas the mutation rate of the KIF1Bβ gene was infrequent. Although KIF1Bβ allelic loss was significantly associated with a decrease in KIF1Bβ mRNA levels, its promoter region was not hypermethylated. Additionally, expression of KIF1Bβ was markedly down-regulated in advanced stages of tumors (p < 0.001). Enforced expression of KIF1Bβ resulted in an induction of apoptotic cell death in association with an increase in the number of cells entered into the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, whereas its knockdown by either short interfering RNA or by a genetic suppressor element led to an accelerated cell proliferation or enhanced tumor formation in nude mice, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the rod region unique to KIF1Bβ is critical for the induction of apoptotic cell death in a p53-independent manner. Thus, KIF1Bβ may act as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor, and its allelic loss may be involved in the pathogenesis of neuroblastoma and other cancers. Deletion of the distal region of chromosome 1 frequently occurs in a variety of human cancers, including aggressive neuroblastoma. Previously, we have identified a 500-kb homozygously deleted region at chromosome 1p36.2 harboring at least six genes in a neuroblastoma-derived cell line NB1/C201. Among them, only KIF1Bβ, a member of the kinesin superfamily proteins, induced apoptotic cell death. These results prompted us to address whether KIF1Bβ could be a tumor suppressor gene mapped to chromosome 1p36 in neuroblastoma. Hemizygous deletion of KIF1Bβ in primary neuroblastomas was significantly correlated with advanced stages (p = 0.0013) and MYCN amplification (p < 0.001), whereas the mutation rate of the KIF1Bβ gene was infrequent. Although KIF1Bβ allelic loss was significantly associated with a decrease in KIF1Bβ mRNA levels, its promoter region was not hypermethylated. Additionally, expression of KIF1Bβ was markedly down-regulated in advanced stages of tumors (p < 0.001). Enforced expression of KIF1Bβ resulted in an induction of apoptotic cell death in association with an increase in the number of cells entered into the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, whereas its knockdown by either short interfering RNA or by a genetic suppressor element led to an accelerated cell proliferation or enhanced tumor formation in nude mice, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the rod region unique to KIF1Bβ is critical for the induction of apoptotic cell death in a p53-independent manner. Thus, KIF1Bβ may act as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor, and its allelic loss may be involved in the pathogenesis of neuroblastoma and other cancers. Neuroblastoma is one of the most common malignant solid tumors occurring in infancy and childhood and accounts for 10% of all pediatric cancers (1Westemann F. Schwab M. Cancer Lett. 2002; 184: 127-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Neuroblastomas are derived from sympathetic neuroblasts with various clinical outcomes from spontaneous regression because of neuronal differentiation and/or apoptotic cell death to malignant progression. Extensive cytogenetic and molecular genetic studies identified that genetic abnormalities such as loss of short arm of chromosome 1 (1p), amplification of MYCN, and 17q gain are frequently observed and often associated with poor clinical outcome (2Brodeur G.M.

A chromosomal locus 1p36 is frequently deleted in aggressive neuroblastoma, pheochromocytoma, colon, liver, brain, breast, and other cancers (18Schwab M. Praml C. Amler L.C. Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1996; 16: 211-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 19Schwab M. Westermann F. Hero B. Berthold F.

Transfer of 1p chromosome segments into neuroblastoma-derived cell line NGP.1A.TR1 resulted in a significant suppression of their tumor formation (20Bader S.A. Fasching C. Brodeur G.M. Stanbridge E.J. Cell Growth & Differ. 1991; 5: 245-255Google Scholar). Furthermore, previous studies indicated that there is no single site of deletion on the distal part of 1p36, but there are at least three discrete regions that are commonly deleted in neuroblastoma, indicating that they may harbor potential tumor suppressor gene(s) (8Brodeur G.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 203-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (1711) Google Scholar). Tumor suppressor genes, one of the main classes of cancer-associated genes, encode inhibitors of cell proliferation and/or activators of apoptotic cell death and are involved in a variety of molecular mechanisms behind cell growth suppression (21Sherr C.J. Cell. 2004; 116: 235-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). Tumor suppressor genes frequently mutated in other malignancies do not appear to play a major role in the generation of neuroblastoma, indicating that development of this type of tumor employs one or more previously unidentified genetic pathways. To date, a majority of candidate tumor suppressor genes has been identified by mapping the minimal deleted region and searching for the intact homologous region of mutated genes. This experimental strategy fails when the second allele is silenced by promoter hypermethylation or the targeted gene is haploinsufficient for tumor suppression, a situation where loss of one allele confers a selective advantage for tumor growth. Several examples of such haploinsufficiency for tumor suppression have been demonstrated in the case of p27KIP1, p53, and PTEN (22Cook W.D. McCaw B.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3434-3438Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 23Fodde R. Smits R. Science. 2002; 298: 761-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). We and other investigators have previously identified a 500-kb homozygous deletion at 1p36.2 harboring at least six genes, PEX14, UFD2a, KIF1B, CORT, DFF45, and PGD, in a neuroblastoma-derived cell line NB1/C201 (12Ohira M.

In this study, we have demonstrated that only KIF1Bβ, a member of the kinesin 3 family genes (25Lawrence C.J. Dawe R.K. Christie K.R. Cleveland D.W. Dawson S.C. Endow S.A. Goldstein L.S. Goodson H.V.

Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 19-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar), might be a tumor suppressor gene mapped to chromosome 1p36 in neuroblastoma. Kinesins are microtubule-dependent intracellular motors involved in the transport of organelles, vesicles, protein complexes, and RNA to specific destinations (26Hirokawa N. Science. 1998; 279: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar, 27Goldstein L.S. Philp A.V. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 141-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). KIF1B encodes two alternatively spliced isoforms, including KIF1Bα and KIF1Bβ, and both form homodimers and transport mitochondria and synaptic vesicle precursors, respectively (28Nangaku M. Sato-Yoshitake R. Okada Y. Noda Y. Takemura R. Yamazaki H. Hirokawa N. Cell. 1994; 79: 1209-1220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal motor domain of KIF1Bα is identical to KIF1Bβ, whereas COOH-terminal tails share no structural homology. A point mutation in the ATP-binding site within the motor domain of KIF1Bβ has been closely linked to Charcot-Marie Tooth disease type 2A (29Zhao C. Takita J. Tanaka Y. Setou M. Nakagawa T. Takeda S.

In this study, we cloned a full-length KIF1Bβ cDNA, generated recombinant adenovirus encoding KIF1Bβ, and examined its biological role in neuroblastoma and other cell lines. We systematically analyzed KIF1Bβ for LOH, 2The abbreviations used are:LOHloss of heterogeneityCGHcomparative genomic hybridizationFHAforkhead-associatedGSEgenetic suppressor elementKIFkinesin superfamily proteinNBneuroblastomaNGFnerve growth factorFACSfluorescence-activated cell sortersiRNAshort interfering RNAMTT3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromideRTreverse transcriptionGFPgreen fluorescent protein. mutation, and promoter methylation.

Cell Lines and Tumor Samples—Human neuroblastoma (NB) cell lines such as SH-SY5Y, NB1, and SK-N-BE were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. NMuMG, COS7, HEK293, and HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Tumor DNA and RNA samples were obtained from our Neuroblastoma Resource Bank. Informed consent was obtained at each hospital. GSE-mediated Tumor Formation in Nude Mice—GSE assay was performed as described previously (30Garkavtsev I. Kazarov A. Gudkov A. Riabowol K. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 415-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). In brief, a cDNA fragment (nucleotide number 2658–3115 of GenBank™ accession number AB017133) corresponding to the unique region of KIF1Bβ was amplified by PCR-based strategy and subcloned into the HpaI site of the pLXSN vector in an antisense orientation to give pLXSN-antisense KIF1Bβ. NMuMG mammary gland cells (1 × 106 cells) infected with pLXSN or with pLXSN-antisense KIF1Bβ were inoculated subcutaneously into the femoral region of nude mice. In the experiments using live animals, we strictly followed the Chiba Cancer Center Research Institute guidelines and protocols for handling live animals. Construction of Expression Plasmids and Recombinant Adenovirus—KIF1Bβ splicing variants I, III, and IV fused to the FLAG epitope at their NH2 termini were amplified by PCR using cDNA prepared from CHP134 cells as a template and subcloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). KIF1Bβ-GFP deletion constructs were produced by PCR-based amplification. The recombinant adenovirus was constructed as described previously (31Mizuguchi H. Kay M.A. Hum. Gene Ther. 1998; 9: 2577-2583Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, KIF1Bβ cDNA was subcloned into pHMCMV6 adeno-shuttle vector. The shuttle vector was then digested with I-Ceu I and PI-Sce I and inserted into the identical restriction sites of the adenovirus expression vector pAdHM4. All of the recombinant vectors were verified by DNA sequencing. Recombinant adenoviruses were produced by transfecting the PacI-digested expression constructs into HEK293 cells. An expression vector encoding GFP was used to monitor the efficiency of infection. Mutation Analysis—For the detection of KIF1Bβ mutations, we designed primer sets covering the motor domain and 2 kb of the 5′-upstream region of KIF1Bβ. After PCR-based amplification, PCR products were separated by 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoresis, PCR products were gel-purified and subcloned into pGEM-T Easy Vector (Promega), and their DNA sequences were determined by an automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Flow Cytometry—Cells were fixed in ice-cold 70% ethanol, treated with 50 mm sodium citrate, 100 μg/ml RNase A, 50 μg/ml propidium iodide and subjected to FACS analysis (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Construction of KIF1Bβ siRNA Expression Vector—An siRNA expression vector termed pMuniH1, in which the cytomegalovirus promoter of pcDNA 3.1 was replaced with the H1 promoter, was generated. Sense and antisense oligonucleotides for KIF1Bβ (nucleotide number 371–389 of GenBank™ accession number AB017183) were joined by a 9-base loop, annealed, and subcloned into pMuniH1. Luciferase Reporter Assay—The genomic fragments corresponding nucleotide positions –887/+106, –630/+106, and –294/+106 of the KIF1Bβ gene were amplified from human placenta genomic DNA and cloned into pGL3-Basic luciferase reporter plasmid (Promega) to give pGL3(–887/+106), pGL3(–630/+106), and pGL3(–294/+106). For luciferase assay, SK-N-BE cells were transfected with pRL-TK (Promega) encoding Renilla luciferase cDNA and the indicated luciferase reporter constructs. Forty eight hours after transfection, firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured by dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega), and firefly luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity. Methylation-specific PCR—The methylation status of the promoter region of KIF1Bβ was assessed by methylation-specific PCR as described previously (32Herman J.G. Graff J.R. Myohansen S. Nelkin B.D. Baylin S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9821-9826Crossref PubMed Scopus (5240) Google Scholar). Cell Cycle Analysis—Cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 and DNA was stained with 0.1 μg/ml of 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Cellular DNA content was analyzed by laser scanning cytometry (LSC2 System, Olympus). Array-CGH Analysis—Array CGH analysis of 112 sporadic primary neuroblastomas using a chip carrying 2,464 bacterial artificial chromosome clones was conducted as described previously (33Tomioka N. Oba S. Ohira M. Misra A. Fridlyand J. Ishii S. Nakamura Y. Isogai E. Hirata T. Yoshida Y. Todo S. Kaneko Y. Albertson D.G. Pinkel D. Feuerstein B.G. Nakagawara A. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 441-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). All array-CGH data are available at NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO, www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) with accession number GSE 5784. Caspase Assay—Caspase activity was measured by using caspase-3/7 assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Statistics—The Student's t test was used as a statistical method. Statistical significance was declared if the p value was <0.05. Identification of KIF1Bβ as a Candidate Tumor Suppressor Mapped to Chromosome 1p36.2—To search for a candidate tumor suppressor gene(s), we first transferred each of the above-mentioned six genes into NB1 and nontransformed NMuMG mouse epithelial cells (30Garkavtsev I. Kazarov A. Gudkov A. Riabowol K. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 415-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), and we found that only KIF1Bβ induces growth suppression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). In contrast, our preliminary observations indicated that its alternative splicing variant KIF1Bα lacking a COOH-terminal rod region has marginal effects on cell growth in NB1 cells (data not shown). In support of these results, siRNA-mediated knockdown of KIF1Bβ in HeLa cells without 1p loss markedly enhanced their cell growth (Fig. 1B). In addition, enforced expression of KIF1Bβ induced growth retardation in p53-deficient H1299 cells and HeLa cells in which p53 is inactivated because of the presence of E6-AP (data not shown). Overexpression of KIF1Bβ in Neuroblastomas-induced Apoptotic Cell Death—During PCR-based screening of human KIF1Bβ cDNA from human neuroblastoma cell lines, we identified at least four splicing variants that lacked exons 14 and/or 15 (supplemental Fig. S1). Similar splicing variants have also been observed in mice and rats (34Gong T.W. Winnicki R.S. Kohrman D.C. Lomax M.I. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 239: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We successfully generated recombinant adenoviruses for human KIF1Bβ-I, -III, and -IV variants (Fig. 2A). Enforced expression of these splicing variants promoted apoptotic cell death in both SH-SY5Y (without 1p loss) and NB1 neuroblastoma cell lines as determined by MTT and FACS analyses (Fig. 2A and supplemental Fig. S2). Consistent with these results, colony formation assay showed that all these KIF1Bβ splicing variants strongly reduced the number of drug-resistant colonies in SH-SY5Y and NB1 neuroblastoma cells (Fig. 2B). These findings suggest that multiple KIF1Bβ splicing isoforms possess tumor suppressor activity. Intriguingly, the expression pattern of KIF1Bβ splicing variants was varied among various human tissues (supplemental Fig. S3). Knockdown of KIF1Bβ Expression Accelerates Growth of NMuMG Cells and Tumor Formation in Nude Mice—We then asked whether genetic disruption of KIF1Bβ gene could be critical for tumorigenesis. For this purpose, we employed a genetic suppressor element (GSE) strategy (30Garkavtsev I. Kazarov A. Gudkov A. Riabowol K. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 415-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). A mouse genomic DNA corresponding to a KIF1Bβ cDNA fragment (nucleotide number 2658–3115 of GenBank™ accession number AB017133) encoding the unique region of KIF1Bβ was subcloned into the retrovirus pLXSN vector in an antisense orientation to give pLXSN-KIF1Bβ-AS. NMuMG cells, immortalized mouse mammary gland cells, stably infected with pLXSN-KIF1Bβ-AS, showed more than 80% reduction in endogenous KIF1Bβ expression (Fig. 3A) and formed significantly larger colonies than empty vector-infected control cells in soft agar medium (Fig. 3B). In addition, all eight mice subcutaneously transplanted with NMuMG cells stably infected with pLXSN-KIF1Bβ-AS displayed remarkable tumor growth (Fig. 3C). On the other hand, only two of eight mice transplanted with the empty vector-infected cells formed tumors, which were smaller in both cases (note log scale in Fig. 3C). The tumors formed by cells lacking KIF1Bβ expression were histologically diagnosed as poorly differentiated invasive ductal carcinoma and frequently metastasized to the lung (Fig. 4). Thus, it is likely that KIF1Bβ exerts tumor-suppressive function in vivo.FIGURE 4Histology of tumors generated in nude mice. Representative photographs of tumors (upper panels) and lung metastasis (lower panels) are shown. For histological analyses, tumor tissues were removed from animals and immediately fixed in 10% formaldehyde and embedded in paraffin, and 3-μm sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) LOH of KIF1Bβ Locus Is Frequently Observed in Primary Advanced Neuroblastomas—We next sought to search for LOH at chromosome 1p36 in 112 sporadic neuroblastomas using array-based comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH). Similar to previous reports, the smallest region of overlap at the distal region of chromosome 1p identified in 37 primary neuroblastomas with 1p loss was between 1p36.22 and 1pter and included KIF1B, CHD5, TP73, and SKI (supplemental Fig. S4). Thirty two percent (30/95) of neuroblastomas examined had lost one KIF1Bβ allele as determined by quantitative real time genomic PCR (Table 1). KIF1Bβ was hemizygously deleted in 18% of early neuroblastomas (stages 1 and 2, n = 51), in 55% of advanced neuroblastomas (stages 3 and 4, n = 38) (p = 0.0013), in 13% of primary neuroblastomas with a single copy of MYCN (n = 70), and in 84% of MYCN-amplified primary neuroblastomas (n = 25) (p < 0.001). No homozygous deletion was detected in the primary tumors examined.TABLE 1Frequency of LOH of the KIF1B geneCategorynKIF1B LOHLOH (+)%Stage 136617 215320 37343 4311858 4s600MYCN Single copy70913 Amplification252184Total953032 Open table in a new tab Decreased Expression of KIF1Bβ Is Associated with Monoallelic Loss of the Gene in Primary Neuroblastomas—We examined expression levels of KIF1Bβ mRNA in 102 primary neuroblastomas by using both semi-quantitative and quantitative real time PCRs. As shown in Fig. 5, A and B, expression levels of KIF1Bβ mRNA were significantly higher in tumors at favorable stages (1, 2, and 4s, 1.654 ± 0.257, mean ± S.E., n = 60) than in those at advanced stages (3 and 4, 0.503 ± 0.180, n = 42, p < 0.001). To address whether its expression levels could be correlated with number of alleles at the KIF1Bβ gene locus, we examined primary tumors with a diploid karyotype. As shown in the lower panel of Fig. 5B, tumors with monoallelic loss of KIF1Bβ gene locus expressed significantly lower levels of KIF1Bβ mRNA (0.126 ± 0.092, n = 13) as compared with those with two KIF1Bβ alleles (0.364 ± 0.035, n = 16, p = 0.019). These results suggest that KIF1Bβ is a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor gene in high risk neuroblastomas. No Promoter Methylation and Rare Mutations Are Observed in Neuroblastoma Cell Lines and Primary Neuroblastomas—Our initial mutation searches of KIF1Bβ gene were focused on its motor domain and the proximal (∼2 kb) promoter region in 21 primary neuroblastomas with 1p36 LOH and in 17 neuroblastoma cell lines. As shown in Table 2, we identified only a silent mutation GCC-GCG (at codon 95) in two primary tumors, a 2-bp (CC) deletion (at –113/–114) and G-A base change (at –336) in the KIF1Bβ promoter region in three primary tumors and four neuroblastoma cell lines. Because these aberrations were also found in the control samples, it is likely that these base changes reflect single nucleotide polymorphisms of the Japanese population.TABLE 2Mutation analyses of KIF1Bβ geneS. no.Case no.Exon 4-6KIF exon 15KIF promotor F12KIF promotor F11F/UFaFor Shimada classification, F indicates favorable histology; UF indicates unfavorable histology, and NA indicates not analyzed.1NB-1NA2NB-2G→AΔ2 bp (-113-4)G→A (-366)NA3NB-3UF4NB-4G→AUF5NB-5/NA6NB-6GCC/GCG (95)/Δ2 bp (-113-4)G→A (-366)F7NB-7/UF8NB-8/UF9NB-9/F10NB-10/F11NB-11/UF12NB-12/UF13NB-13GCC/GCG (95)/Δ2 bp (-113-4)G→A (-366)UF14NB-14/NA15NB-15/NA16NB-16/NA17NB-17/NA18NB-18/NA19NB-19/UF20NB-20/NA21NB-21/F22NB-GAMBG>AΔ2 bp (-113-4)G→A (-366)Cell line23NB-GOTO/P3Cell line24NB-KANG>AΔ2 bp (-113-4)G→A (-366)Cell line25NB-LHNG>AΔ2 bp (-113-4)G→A (-366)Cell line26NB-NB9Cell line27NB-NB69/Cell line28NB-NBLS/Cell line29NB-NBTu-1/Cell line30NB-NLF/Cell line31NB-NMB/Δ2 bp (-113-4)G→A (-366)Cell line32NB-OAN/Cell line33NB-SK-N-AS/Cell line34NB-SK-N-BE/Cell line35NB-SK-N-SH/Cell line36NB-SH-SY5Y/Cell line37NB-CHP134/Cell line38NB-TGWGCC/GCG (95)/Cell linea For Shimada classification, F indicates favorable histology; UF indicates unfavorable histology, and NA indicates not analyzed. Open table in a new tab To further extend our mutation searches, we have examined the presence or absence of KIF1Bβ mutations within its whole coding region in 100 primary neuroblastoma tissues. Finally, we found out the missense mutations (N737S) in six independent cases. However, their functional significances remained unclear. Methylation of CpG islands in the promoters has been considered to be another well recognized molecular mechanism behind the inactivation of the tumor suppressor gene. To determine whether the methylation of CpG island could contribute to the inactivation of KIF1Bβ, the region spanning exon 1 and 5′-upstream sequences (nucleotide number –877 to +106) of KIF1Bβ was cloned and analyzed for promoter activity by luciferase reporter assay. As shown in Fig. 6, A and B, KIF1Bβ promoter region existed at nucleotide position between –630 and –294. We then identified KIF1Bβ CpG islands within the promoter region and investigated whether these CpGs could be methylated in primary neuroblastomas as well as cell lines. The methylation-specific PCR analysis demonstrated that all of the CpG clusters are unmethylated, suggesting that KIF1Bβ is not inactivated by methylation (Fig. 6C). The COOH-terminal Region between FHA and Pleckstrin Homology Domains of KIF1Bβ Is Responsible to Induce Apoptotic Cell Death—To map a critical domain(s) of KIF1Bβ responsible for its tumor-suppressive function, we generated NH2-terminal deletion mutants of KIF1Bβ splicing isoform IV lacking motor domain (KIF1Bβ-IV-Del 1-GFP), motor and FHA domains (KIF1Bβ-IV-Del 2-GFP), coiled-coil domain (KIF1Bβ-IV-Del 3-GFP), and FHA and coiled-coil domains (KIF1Bβ-IV-Del 4-GFP) fused with enhanced green fluorescent protein at their COOH termini (Fig. 7A). COS7 cells were transfected with wild-type or with KIF1Bβ-IV-Del-GFP fusion constructs and followed by live confocal laser scanning microscopy. Forty eight hours after transfection, KIF1Bβ-GFP-positive cells began to lose their normal cell morphology. Seventy two hours after transfection, most of the cells underwent apoptotic cell death and detached from the cell culture dish (Fig. 7, B and D). Expression of splicing variants-I, -III, and -IV along with deletion mutants of splicing variant-IV lacking the motor domain (with or without FHA domain) also induced apoptotic cell death. In contrast, expression of KIF1Bβ mutants lacking the COOH-terminal rod domain did not promote apoptotic cell death (Fig. 7, A and B). Under our experimental conditions, enforced expression of KIF1Bβ variant-IV resulted in a significant increase in the casp"

To investigate possible functions for these intracellularly generated oligopeptides, we fused them to a cationic transactivator peptide sequence using reversible disulfide bonds, introduced them into cells, and analyzed their effect on G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signal transduction. A mixture containing four of these peptides (20–80 μm) significantly inhibited the increase in the extracellular acidification response triggered by angiotensin II (ang II) in CHO-S cells transfected with the ang II type 1 receptor (AT1R-CHO-S). Subsequently, either alone or in a mixture, these peptides increased luciferase gene transcription in AT1R CHO-S cells stimulated with ang II and in HEK293 cells treated with isoproterenol. These peptides without transactivator failed to affect GPCR cellular responses. All four functional peptides were shown in vitro to competitively inhibit the degradation of a synthetic substrate by thimet oligopeptidase. Overexpression of thimet oligopeptidase in both CHO-S and HEK293 cells was sufficient to reduce luciferase activation triggered by a specific GPCR agonist. Moreover, using individual peptides as baits in affinity columns, several proteins involved in GPCR signaling were identified, including α-adaptin A and dynamin 1. These results suggest that before their complete degradation, intracellular peptides similar to those generated by proteasomes can actively affect cell signaling, probably representing additional bioactive molecules within cells.

Intracellular protein turnover is a crucial process for normal cell function; an excess of aged proteins usually leads to the formation of insoluble aggregates within the cell, causing severe pathologies (1Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Varshavsky A. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1073-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). The concomitant action of proteasomes and other extralysosomal proteolytic systems (2Geier E.

The proteasome exists as a 2.4-MDa ATP-dependent complex containing proteolytic subunits that possess cleavage activity specific for hydrophobic, basic, and acidic amino acids (6Kisselev A. F Kaganovich D. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22260-22270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). As expected from such a broad catalytic specificity, protein degradation by the proteasome produces oligopeptides containing 2–20 amino acids within cell nuclei and the cytosol (7Dolenc I. Seemüller E. Baumeister W. FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 357-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Although some of the peptides produced by the proteasome are known to escape degradation and are presented at the cell surface as antigens, the majority of these proteasomal products are thought to be rapidly broken down further into free amino acids (4Goldberg A.L. Nature. 2003; 426: 895-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (1662) Google Scholar, 8Reits E. Griekspoor A. Neijssen J. Groothuis T. Jalink K. van Veelen P. Janssen H. Calafat J. Drijfhout J.W. Neefjes J.

However, the demonstration that free peptides added to the intracellular milieu can regulate cellular functions mediated by protein interactions suggests new putative roles for these molecules in gene regulation, metabolism, cell signaling, and protein targeting. Such interactions frequently involve specific consensus amino acid sequences that can be predicted based on similarities in domain composition. For example, a rationally designed peptide of eight residues was shown to inhibit δ-protein kinase C (PKC) 4The abbreviations used are:PKCprotein kinase CGPCRG protein-coupled receptorCHO-SChinese hamster ovary-SHEKhuman embryonic kidneyEP24.15thimet-oligopeptidase EC 3.4.24.15ECARextracellular acidification ratesCREcAMP-responsive elementQFSquenched fluorescence substrateHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyRDrandom peptideang IIangiotensin IILCliquid chromatographyMSmass spectrometryESIelectrospray ionizationTATtransactivatorWT-EP24.15wild type EP24.15. 4The abbreviations used are:PKCprotein kinase CGPCRG protein-coupled receptorCHO-SChinese hamster ovary-SHEKhuman embryonic kidneyEP24.15thimet-oligopeptidase EC 3.4.24.15ECARextracellular acidification ratesCREcAMP-responsive elementQFSquenched fluorescence substrateHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyRDrandom peptideang IIangiotensin IILCliquid chromatographyMSmass spectrometryESIelectrospray ionizationTATtransactivatorWT-EP24.15wild type EP24.15. translocation and function, as evidenced by its protective effect in a model of myocardial infarction (9Kheifets V.

The c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase, a member of the stress-activated group of mitogen-activated protein kinases, is inhibited by a cell membrane-permeable peptide that decreases intracellular c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase signaling and confers long term protection to pancreatic β-cells against IL-1β-induced apoptosis (10Bonny C. Oberson A. Negri S. Sauser C. Schorderet D.F. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Therefore, we have previously suggested that the natural peptides generated by proteasomes could interfere with intracellular protein interactions before their complete degradation, thereby affecting cell signaling, gene regulation, metabolism, and protein targeting (11Ferro E.S.

Thimet oligopeptidase (EC 3.4.24.15; EP24.15) was first described as a neuropeptide-degrading enzyme present in the soluble fraction of rat brain homogenates (12Orlowski M. Michaud C. Chu T.G. Eur.

The primarily intracellular location (e.g. cytosolic and nuclear) of oligopeptidase EP24.15 suggests that this enzyme has other functions in addition to degrading extracellular neuropeptides and hormones (11Ferro E.S.

EP24.15 substrate specificity has been shown to depend predominantly on the peptide size with no clear preference for amino acid sequence (15Camargo A.C. Gomes M.D. Reichl A.P. Ferro E.S.

In fact, EP24.15 has recently been shown to play an intracellular role in either degrading or protecting major histocompatibility complex class I antigenic peptides produced by the proteasome (24Silva C.L.

To further explore the role of oligopeptidases in the metabolism of intracellular peptides, we recently developed an experimental approach employing a recombinant, catalytically inactive mutant form of EP24.15 to “capture” endogenous peptide substrates of this enzyme (22Rioli V. Gozzo F.C. Heimann A.S. Linardi A. Krieger J.E. Shida C.S. Almeida P.C. Hyslop S. Eberlin M.N. Ferro E.S. J. Biol.

The smallest peptide isolated in these assays contained 5 amino acids, and the largest had 16 amino acids (11Ferro E.S. Hyslop S. Camargo A.C. J.

Although the peptides captured using this approach are mainly intracellular protein fragments (distinct from neuropeptides) that efficiently interacted (Ki of ∼1–10 μm) with EP24.15 without being degraded, some others are typical substrates generally cleaved at more than one peptide bond to produce multiple shorter peptides (22Rioli V. Gozzo F.C. Heimann A.S. Linardi A. Krieger J.E. Shida C.S. Almeida P.C. Hyslop S. Eberlin M.N. Ferro E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8547-8555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Additionally, the majority of the peptides identified using the inactive EP24.15 were shown to contain a putative protein kinase phosphorylation site (31Machado M.F. Cunha F.M. Berti D.A. Heimann A.S. Klitzke C.F. Rioli V. Oliveira V. Ferro E.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 339: 520-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Actually, substrate phosphorylation changes the kinetic parameters of structurally related oligopeptidases, including EP24.15, neurolysin (EC 3.4.24.16), and angiotensin-converting enzyme (EC 3.4.15.1) (31Machado M.F. Cunha F.M. Berti D.A. Heimann A.S. Klitzke C.F. Rioli V. Oliveira V. Ferro E.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 339: 520-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of peptides leads to reduced degradation, whereas phosphorylation of peptides that interact as competitive inhibitors of these enzymes alters only the Ki values (31Machado M.F. Cunha F.M. Berti D.A. Heimann A.S. Klitzke C.F. Rioli V. Oliveira V. Ferro E.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 339: 520-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These data suggest that substrate phosphorylation could be one of the mechanisms whereby some intracellular peptides can escape degradation, thus becoming available to interfere, for example, in cell signaling and protein network composition (11Ferro E.S. Hyslop S. Camargo A.C. J. Neurochem. 2004; 91: 769-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 31Machado M.F. Cunha F.M. Berti D.A. Heimann A.S. Klitzke C.F. Rioli V. Oliveira V. Ferro E.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 339: 520-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Regulatory regions in proteins are frequently produced in a cassette-like fashion from domains that mediate molecular interactions or have enzymatic activity. Several interaction domains are present in hundreds of copies in the human proteome, and these are used repeatedly to regulate distinct aspects of cellular organization. These interaction domains can target proteins to a specific subcellular location, provide a means of recognition for protein post-translational modifications or chemical second messengers, nucleate the formation of multiprotein signaling complexes, and control the conformation, activity, and substrate specificity of enzymes (32Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1896) Google Scholar, 33Pawson T. Nash P. Science. 2003; 300: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar). In signal transduction, enzymes (e.g. kinases) often generate modified amino acids on their substrates that are then recognized by specific modules. The cell therefore uses various combinations of a limited set of interaction domains to direct the actions of complex regulatory systems. Given the broad repertoire of protein-protein interactions involved in cell signaling, the direct approach of interfering with signaling cascades is of great value for the understanding and control of cell function. Moreover, the majority of peptide-based drugs that have achieved market-place status are of natural rather than combinatorial library origin (34Watt P.M. Nature Biotech. 2006; 24: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and peptides that alter intracellular protein interactions have yielded lead compounds with in vivo activity (34Watt P.M. Nature Biotech. 2006; 24: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Here, we have evaluated the intracellular effect of peptides isolated from rat brain homogenates using the inactive EP24.15 “substrate capture” assay that contains a PKC phosphorylation site. Our results show that such peptides can efficiently interfere with GPCR signal transduction in CHO-S cells expressing AT1 receptors (AT1R-CHO-S) stimulated with angiotensin II and in HEK293 cells stimulated with isoproterenol. Thus, these data suggest the existence of an entirely new group of bioactive molecules having pharmacological effects within cells. Peptide Extraction—Crude peptide extracts from rat brains and CHO-S and HEK293 cells were prepared as previously described with some modifications (35Che F.Y. Yan L. Li H. Mzhavia N. Devi L.A. Fricker L.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9971-9976Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Briefly, male Wistar rats were killed by decapitation, and the entire head was subjected to 10 s of microwave radiation in order to inactivate protein and peptide degradation (36Che F.Y. Lim J. Pan H. Biswas R. Fricker L.D. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 1995; 4: 1391-1405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Tissues from five rats were added to hot (70 °C) 10 mm HCl and homogenized (Polytron; Brinkmann). Homogenates were maintained at 70 °C for 15 min and centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 40 min at 4 °C. CHO-S or HEK293 cells (8 × 107 cells) were first washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline by centrifugation at 800 × g for 5 min. The pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of H2O and was heated in a water bath for 20 min at 80 °C to inactivate proteases. After cooling on ice, 20 μl of 5 m HCl was added to give a final concentration of 10 mm. The cells were sonicated three times with 20 pulses (4 Hz). The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 40 min at 4 °C. After this point, the respective supernatants from either tissue or cells were collected in plastic ultracentrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was again collected and filtered through a Millipore centrifugal filter unit with a molecular weight cut-off of 5,000 Da. Peptides contained in the samples were further purified and concentrated with C18-like Oasis columns (Waters) and dried in a vacuum centrifuge. Peptide Quantification—Peptide concentration in the peptide extracts described above was determined at pH 6.8 using fluorescamine, as previously described (37Saric T. Graef C.I. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46723-46732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 38Undenfriend S. Stein S. Bohlen P. Dairman W. Leimgruber W. Weigele M. Science. 1972; 178: 871-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (2196) Google Scholar). The reaction was performed at pH 6.8 to ensure that only the amino groups of peptides and not those of free amino acids reacted with fluorescamine (38Undenfriend S. Stein S. Bohlen P. Dairman W. Leimgruber W. Weigele M. Science. 1972; 178: 871-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (2196) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2.5 μl of sample was mixed with 25 μl of 0.2 m phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) and 12.5 μl of a 0.3 mg/ml acetone fluorescamine solution. After vortexing for 1 min, 110 μl of water was added, and fluorescence was measured with a SpectraMax M2e plate reader (Molecular Devices) at an excitation wavelength of 370 nm and an emission wavelength of 480 nm. A peptide mixture of known composition and concentration was used as the standard reference for determining the peptide concentration in HEK293 extracts (data not shown). Inactive EP24.15 “Substrate Capture” Assays—Mutated, catalytically inactive EP24.15 (E474A; 90 μg) was incubated with 50 μg of the rat brain peptide extracts as described above and in 200 μl of buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 125 mm NaCl and 0.1% of bovine serum albumin) for 30 min at room temperature. At the end of this period, the reaction mixture was layered onto a dried Sephadex G-25 column (previously washed and equilibrated with Tris-buffered saline followed by centrifugation to remove the buffer) and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 2 min. The flow-through (∼200 μl) was collected, and the peptide content was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a Chromolith performance column (4.6 × 100 mm; Merck), having a linear gradient of 5–35% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, for 20 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Specific peptide peaks were manually collected according to previous reports (22Rioli V. Gozzo F.C. Heimann A.S. Linardi A. Krieger J.E. Shida C.S. Almeida P.C. Hyslop S. Eberlin M.N. Ferro E.S. J.

Krieger J.E. Physiol. Genomics. 2005; 20: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and identified as described below. Peptide Sequencing and Bioinformatic Analysis—Peptides peaks manually collected as described above were sequenced by positive nanoelectrospray ionization using peptide-containing aliquots collected during HPLC. Typical conditions were a capillary voltage of 1 kV, a cone voltage of 30 V, and a dessolvation gas temperature of 100 °C. The protonated peptides were subjected to collision-induced dissociation with argon in the 15–45 eV collision energy range. All of the mass spectrometry experiments were done with a Q-tof mass spectrometer (Micromass, UK) in a Qq-orthogonal time-of-flight configuration. Peptide sequences were determined manually from the ESI-MS/MS product ion mass spectra with the help of the Pep-Seq software package (Micromass, UK). To identify the putative protein precursors of the peptides sequenced by ESI-MS/MS, a protein data base (available on the World Wide Web) was searched for short, nearly exact matches (rodentia origin), as previously described (39Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59759) Google Scholar). The prediction of post-translational modification sites in sequenced peptides was done with the ExPASy Proteomics Server on the World Wide Web. Peptide Selection and Synthesis—Peptides identified as described above were further selected for functional analysis on GPCR signal transduction based on their ability to both interact with EP24.15 (either as substrates or competitive inhibitors only) and on possessing a predicted PKC post-translational modification site. These peptides (supplemental Table 2) were synthesized with or without a fluorescein-labeled peptide (NH2-terminal) either coupled to the TAT peptide (CRKKRRQRRR) sequence through reversible disulfide bonds (40Soughayer J.S.

EP24.15 Enzyme Assays—The enzymatic activity of EP24.15 was determined in triplicate in a continuous assay using the quenched fluorescent substrate (QFS) (7-methoxycoumarin-4-acetyl-Pro-Leu-Gly-Pro-d-Lys-(2,4-dinitrophenyl), as previously described (41Shrimpton C.N. Glucksman M.J. Lew R.A. Tullai J.W. Margulies E.H. Roberts J.L. Smith A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17395-17399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 42Tullai J.W.

Analysis of Peptide Phosphorylation by PKC—In order to determine if peptides are substrates of PKC, each peptide (30 μm) was incubated with 25 ng of PKC (Promega) for 2 h at 30 °C in the appropriate buffer as indicated by the manufacturer. The incubation product was then analyzed by LC-MS (Surveyor MSQ Plus; Thermo Finnigan) with a SOURCE 5RPC ST column (21.1/150; GE Healthcare) at a 200-μl/min flux of water/acetonitrile (8:2) and formic acid (0.1%). Phosphate addition to the original peptide was identified by mass spectrometry using positive electrospray ionization, a source voltage of 3.5 kV, and a cone voltage of 40 V (Finnegan). Analysis of Peptide Entry and Stability within Cells—The entry of peptides into CHO-S cells was analyzed by HPLC coupled to a fluorescence detector. CHO-S cells grown under standard conditions (43Carreño F.R. Goñi C.N. Castro L.M. Ferro E.S. J. Neurochem. 2005; 93: 10-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) were incubated with the studied peptides (20 μm) for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were then scraped from 6-well plates, suspended in 6 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, and centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The cell pellet was resuspended in milli-Q water plus protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and cell lysis was carried out using three freeze-thaw cycles. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 20,200 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was acidified, and peptide content was separated by HPLC on a C-18 chromatographic column (5 μm, 4.6 × 100 mm; Waters XTerra™ RP18), having a linear gradient from 20 to 80% acetonitrile plus 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for 20 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. To enable highly sensitive detection of fluorescein-labeled peptides despite acidic chromatography conditions, the column eluate was mixed on-line with an aqueous ammonia solution (NH4OH/water, 2.5:100, v/v) with a flow rate of 0.75 ml/min (44Baechle D. Fischer R. Cansier A. Brock R. Kalbacher H. Anal. Biochem. 2005; 345: 161-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Peak identification and quantification was made possible by using standards comprising the peptide in the TAT-containing form and the TAT-lacking form, which was achieved by incubating the peptides in thiol-reducing dithiothreitol (10 mm). Fluorescence was monitored at an excitation wavelength of 490 nm and an emission wavelength of 520 nm. Measurement of the Extracellular Acidification Rates—Extracellular acidification rates (ECAR) in CHO-S cells were evaluated as an index of metabolic activity by the application of a cytosensor microphysiometer (Molecular Devices) and a computer work station. AT1R-CHO-S cells were subcultured onto a polycarbonate membrane with a 3-μm pore size in transwell capsules at a density of 2 × 105 cells. On the day of the experiment, a spacer ring and an insert cup were placed into each transwell, and the assembled units were transferred into the microphysiometer chambers. Low buffered Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium enriched with NaCl (2.26 g/liter) was used as the running medium in the microphysiometer, with a perfusion rate of 100 μl/min. The extracellular acidification rate was measured as the change in pH over time, which was determined by 15-s potentiometer rate measurements (μV/s; pump-off cycle) after a 40-s pump cycle with a 20-s delay (60 s total cycle time). Acidification rates (μV/s) were normalized as a percentage of the base line, since the acidification rate data are dependent on cell seeding density and uniformity. Experiments were carried out as follows: cells were allowed to stabilize for 60 min, having been perfused with running medium in the cytosensor chambers. Initially, a 15-s stimula"
https://openalex.org/W2057222662,"Gain modulation is a widespread neuronal phenomenon that modifies response amplitude without changing selectivity. Computational and in vitro studies have proposed cellular mechanisms of gain modulation based on the postsynaptic effects of background synaptic activation, but these mechanisms have not been studied in vivo. Here, we used intracellular recordings from cat primary visual cortex to measure neuronal gain while changing background synaptic activity with visual stimulation. We found that increases in the membrane fluctuations associated with increases in synaptic input do not obligatorily result in gain modulation in vivo. However, visual stimuli that evoked sustained changes in resting membrane potential, input resistance, and membrane fluctuations robustly modulated neuronal gain. The magnitude of gain modulation depended critically on the spatiotemporal properties of the visual stimulus. Gain modulation in vivo may thus be determined on a moment-to-moment basis by sensory context and the consequent dynamics of synaptic activation."
https://openalex.org/W2125088903,"Seeking to better understand how membrane trafficking is coordinated with phospholipid synthesis in yeast, we investigated lipid synthesis in several Sec(-) temperature-sensitive mutants, including sec13-1. Upon shift of sec13-1 cells to the restrictive temperature of 37 degrees C, phospholipid synthesis decreased dramatically relative to the wild type control, whereas synthesis of neutral lipids, especially triacylglycerol (TAG), increased. When examined by fluorescence microscopy, the number of lipid droplets appeared to increase and formed aggregates in sec13-1 cells shifted to 37 degrees C. Electron microscopy confirmed the increase in lipid droplet number and revealed that many were associated with the vacuole. Analysis of lipid metabolism in strains lacking TAG synthase genes demonstrated that the activities of the products of these genes contribute to accumulation of TAG in sec13-1 cells after the shift to 37 degrees C. Furthermore, the permissive temperature for growth of the sec13-1 strain lacking TAG synthase genes was 3 degrees C lower than sec13-1 on several different growth media, indicating that the synthesis of TAG has physiological significance under conditions of secretory stress. Together these results suggest that following a block in membrane trafficking, yeast cells channel lipid metabolism from phospholipid synthesis into synthesis of TAG and other neutral lipids to form lipid droplets. We conclude that this metabolic switch provides a degree of protection to cells during secretory stress."
https://openalex.org/W1967813793,"Inflammatory cytokines cause tissue dysfunction. We previously reported that retinal inflammation down-regulates rhodopsin expression and impairs visual function by an unknown mechanism. Here, we demonstrate that rhodopsin levels were preserved by suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), a negative feedback regulator of STAT3 activation. SOCS3 was expressed mainly in photoreceptor cells in the retina. In the SOCS3-deficient retinas, rhodopsin protein levels dropped sooner, and the reduction was more profound than in the wild type. Visual dysfunction, measured by electroretinogram, was prolonged in retina-specific SOCS3 conditional knock-out mice. Visual dysfunction and decreased rhodopsin levels both correlated with increased STAT3 activation enhanced by SOCS3 deficiency. Interleukin 6, one of the inflammatory cytokines found during retinal inflammation, activated STAT3 and decreased rhodopsin protein in adult retinal explants. This was enhanced by inhibiting SOCS3 function in vitro, indicating that rhodopsin reduction was not a secondary effect in the mutant mice. Interestingly, in the inflamed SOCS3-deficient adult retina, rhodopsin decreased post-transcriptionally at least partly through ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent degradation accelerated by STAT3 activation and not transcriptionally as in the developing retina, on which we reported previously. A STAT3-dependent E3 ubiquitin ligase, Ubr1, was responsible for rhodopsin degradation and was up-regulated in the inflamed SOCS3-deficient retinas. These results indicate that in wild-type animals, a decrease in rhodopsin during inflammation is minimized by endogenous SOCS3. However, when STAT3 activation exceeds some threshold beyond the compensatory activity of endogenous SOCS3, rhodopsin levels decrease. These findings suggest SOCS3 as a potential therapeutic target molecule for protecting photoreceptor cell function during inflammation. Inflammatory cytokines cause tissue dysfunction.

One effect of retinal inflammation that impairs visual function is the decreased expression of rhodopsin, an essential protein for photoreceptor function (4Kurihara T. Ozawa Y. Shinoda K. Nagai N.

Previous reports have shown that gp130 signals influence rhodopsin expression in the developing retina.

Neurosci. 2004; 24: 9779-9788Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The high level of STAT3 activation in the late embryonic period must be down-regulated postnatally to initiate rhodopsin expression and photoreceptor cell differentiation (8Ozawa Y. Nakao K. Shimazaki T. Takeda J. Akira S. Ishihara K. Hirano T. Oguchi Y. Okano H. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2004; 26: 258-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). STAT3 activation is declined not only by cytokine depletion but also by suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), a negative feedback modulator of STAT3 activation (10Ozawa Y. Nakao K. Shimazaki T. Shimmura S. Kurihara T. Ishida S. Yoshimura A. Tsubota K. Okano H. Dev. Biol. 2007; 303: 591-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). SOCS3 functions by inhibiting the Janus kinase (JAK), which activates STAT3 downstream of the gp130 signal. Because the inhibition of STAT3 permits the transcription of rhodopsin and its upstream transcription factor crx during development (8Ozawa Y. Nakao K. Shimazaki T. Takeda J. Akira S. Ishihara K. Hirano T. Oguchi Y. Okano H. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2004; 26: 258-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 10Ozawa Y. Nakao K. Shimazaki T. Shimmura S. Kurihara T. Ishida S. Yoshimura A. Tsubota K. Okano H. Dev. Biol. 2007; 303: 591-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), it seemed likely that a similar mechanism might be responsible for inhibiting rhodopsin expression during inflammation. If rhodopsin expression during inflammation was indeed negatively regulated by STAT3 activation and rescued by SOCS3, SOCS3 would be an ideal therapeutic target molecule. In fact, CNTF promotes retinal survival in degenerative disease models but does not improve electroretinogram (ERG), because rhodopsin expression is decreased by unknown mechanisms (11Rhee K.D.

This side effect is now the focus of considerable interest, as CNTF is a potential candidate for the treatment of retinitis pigmentosa (11Rhee K.D. Ruiz A. Duncan J.L. Hauswirth W.W. Lavail M.M.

Here, we have demonstrated that SOCS3 preserved rhodopsin levels and visual function by reducing STAT3 activation during retinal inflammation. We used a model of LPS-induced retinitis with uveitis in which the IL-6/gp130 receptor signal is up-regulated (3Nagai N. Oike Y. Noda K. Urano T. Kubota Y. Ozawa Y. Shinoda H. Koto T. Shinoda K. Inoue M. Tsubota K. Yamashiro K. Suda T. Ishida S. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2005; 46: 2925-2931Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and rhodopsin is down-regulated (4Kurihara T. Ozawa Y. Shinoda K. Nagai N. Inoue M. Oike Y. Tsubota K. Ishida S. Okano H. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2006; 47: 5545-5552Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). During retinal inflammation, SOCS3-deficient mice showed excessive STAT3 activation, which caused a more profound loss of rhodopsin and worse visual disturbance than identically stimulated wild-type animals. Furthermore, the endogenous SOCS3 in wild-type mice contributed to the recovery of visual function but failed to prevent the effects of activated STAT3 at its peak levels. The reduced rhodopsin levels were regulated post-transcriptionally, unlike in embryos, by degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) most probably mediated by the STAT3-dependent E3 ubiquitin ligase, Ubr1. Thus, SOCS3 was required to minimize the influence of inflammatory cytokines and preserve visual function. SOCS3 therefore may be a good therapeutic target for controlling retinal neural function during inflammation. Animals—C57BL/6 mice (8 weeks old) were purchased from Clea Japan (Tokyo). SOCS3 floxed mice were generated in Dr. Yoshimura's laboratory (Kyushu University) (14Mori H. Hanada R. Hanada T. Aki D. Mashima R. Nishinakamura H. Torisu T. Chien K.R. Yasukawa H. Yoshimura A. Nat.

Animals received a single intraperitoneal injection of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (6.0 mg/kg body weight) (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline. Animals were sacrificed and evaluated at the indicated time points. CAG-CAT-EGFP transgenic mice, which were used to show the expression of Cre recombinase, were kindly provided by Dr. J.

All procedures conformed to the Policies on the Use of Animals and Humans in Neuroscience Research as approved by the Institutional Safety Committee on Recombinant DNA Experiments and the Animal Research Committee of Keio University. Retinal Explant Culture—Retinal explant culture was performed using adult mouse neural retina as described previously, with modifications to the protocol described by Tomita et al. (17Tomita K. Ishibashi M. Nakahara K. Ang S.L. Nakanishi S. Guillemot F. Kageyama R. Neuron. 1996; 16: 723-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Briefly, eyes were enucleated, and the neural retinas were isolated and placed on a Millicell chamber filter (Millipore, Billeria, MA; pore size, 0.4 μm) with the ganglion cell layer facing up. The chamber was then placed in a well of a 6-well culture plate that contained 50% minimum Eagle's medium (Invitrogen), 25% Hanks' balanced salt solution (Invitrogen), 25% horse serum (Thermo Trace, Victoria, Australia), 200 mm l-glutamine, and 6.75 mg/ml d-glucose. The explants were incubated at 34 °C in 5% CO2 for 1 night and then at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 4 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum with or without IL-6 (10 ng/ml, Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ), AG490 (7.5 or 15 μm, Calbiochem), or MG132 (10 μm, Biomol, Philadelphia). For immunoprecipitation, adult retinal explants were incubated for 30 min under each condition with MG132 (10 μm). Electroporation—Electroporation was performed as described previously (8Ozawa Y.

Briefly, a retinal explant on a filter membrane was placed into the appropriate DNA solution (5 μg/μl in phosphate-buffered saline minus), which was dropped on an agarose gel, and electric pulses (20 V for 50 ms, 6 times) were applied with an electroporator (CUY21 NEPPA GENE, Chiba, Japan) without contacting the tissue.

The control was an empty transfection vector, pCAG, which was introduced along with pCAG-EGFP. Lentivirus Infection—Lentivirus vector carrying shRNA targeting Ubr1 and a random control shRNA was purchased from Sigma. Lentivirus was produced along with the company's guidance and infected into adult retinal explants. Immunohistochemistry—Cryosections of the retina (12–16 μm) fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde were prepared as described elsewhere (8Ozawa Y. Nakao K. Shimazaki T. Takeda J. Akira S. Ishihara K. Hirano T. Oguchi Y. Okano H. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2004; 26: 258-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The sections were first incubated with 0.1% Triton and 10% goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline and then at 4 °C with primary mouse anti-rhodopsin (1:100, Abcam, Cambridge, MA), rabbit anti-rhodopsin (1:1000, LSL, Tokyo), or anti-glutamine synthetase antibodies (1:400, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) diluted in 0.1% Triton and 2% goat serum. The sections were then incubated with Alexa 555-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:500, Molecular Probes; Invitrogen).

Finally, the immunoreactions were detected with a tyramide signal amplification fluorescein system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), as described previously (8Ozawa Y. Nakao K. Shimazaki T. Takeda J. Akira S. Ishihara K. Hirano T. Oguchi Y. Okano H. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2004; 26: 258-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Double immunostained sections were examined with a laser scanning confocal microscope (LSM510, Carl Zeiss). Each set of experiments was performed in parallel. The length of the outer segments was measured in the mid-peripheral part of the retinas in three sections from three individual animals after immunostaining with anti-rhodopsin antibody. Immunoblot Analysis—Retinal extract proteins were fractionated by electrophoresis on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and then electrophoretically transferred to membranes and incubated with rabbit anti-phospho-STAT3 (Tyr-705) (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit anti-rhodopsin (1:16000, LSL), mouse anti-rhodopsin (1:1000, Abcam), rabbit anti-Ubr1 (1:200, Abcam), mouse anti-α-tubulin (1:2000, Sigma), or mouse anti-ubiquitin (1:500, Nippon Biotest Laboratories, Tokyo) antibodies followed by horseradish peroxidase- or biotin-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson Immuno-Research Laboratory, West Grove, PA). The immunoreactive proteins were detected with an ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). The intensity of the bands was measured using the NIH Imaging system, and the levels of proteins of interest were normalized to that of α-tubulin. Rhodopsin appeared as two bands on the immunoblots, which probably represent monomeric and dimeric forms. These bands appeared in all of the samples (as the intensity levels of the bands in each sample were in parallel, we have shown only the monomers in most of the figures for the sake of simplicity). For immunoprecipitation, retinal extract was obtained in the presence of MG132 (20 μm) in the lysis buffer and reacted with rabbit anti-rhodopsin. Real-time RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from the retina, and the cDNAs were synthesized after RNase-free DNase (Invitrogen) treatment. Real-time PCR was performed using an Mx3000p, with SYBR Green (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan). The primers for crx and rhodopsin detection were described by Furukawa et al. (21Furukawa T. Morrow E.M. Li T. Davis F.C. Cepko C.L. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 466-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar) and Peng et al. (22Peng G.H. Ahmad O. Ahmad F. Liu J. Chen S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 747-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), respectively. The results are presented as the ratio of the mRNA of interest to the mRNA of an internal control gene, gapdh. The gapdh primer sequences were accacagtccatgccatcac (forward) and tccaccaccctgttgctgta (reverse). Electroretinogram—ERG recording was performed as described previously (4Kurihara T. Ozawa Y.

Briefly, animals were dark-adapted for at least 12 h and prepared under dim red illumination. Mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (70 mg/kg of body weight; Dainippon Sumitomo Pharmaceutical Co., Osaka, Japan) and kept on a heating pad throughout the experiment. The pupils were dilated with one drop of a mixed solution of 0.5% tropicamide and 0.5% phenylephrine (Santen Pharmaceutical Co., Osaka, Japan). The ground electrode was a subcutaneous needle inserted in the tail, and the reference electrode was placed subcutaneously between the eyes. The active contact lens electrodes (Mayo, Inazawa, Japan) were placed on the cornea. Recordings were performed with the PowerLab system 2/25 (AD Instruments, New South Wales, Australia). Responses were differentially amplified and filtered through a digital bandpass filter ranging from 0.3 to 500 Hz to yield a- and b-waves. Light pulses of 800 cd-s/m2 were delivered via a Ganzfeld System SG-2002 (LKC Technologies). The amplitude of the a-wave was measured from the base line to the trough of the a-wave, and the amplitude of the b-wave was determined from the trough of the a-wave to the peak of the b-wave. The implicit time of the a- and b-waves was measured from the onset of stimulus to the peak of each wave. Statistical Analysis—Data were expressed as the mean ± S.D. Statistical significance was tested with the unpaired two-tailed Student's t test or analysis of variance. Expression of SOCS3 and Activated STAT3 during Inflammation in the Retina—First, we found that SOCS3, which is expressed mainly in the photoreceptor cells during development (10Ozawa Y. Nakao K. Shimazaki T. Shimmura S. Kurihara T. Ishida S. Yoshimura A. Tsubota K. Okano H. Dev. Biol. 2007; 303: 591-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), was also expressed in the photoreceptor cells in the normal adult retinas, most prominently in the inner segments (Fig. 1A). SOCS3 was present in the neurites of the cells in the inner layers as well. Eight hours after LPS injection, which induces retinal inflammation (3Nagai N. Oike Y. Noda K. Urano T. Kubota Y. Ozawa Y.

This is consistent with the fact that SOCS3 is rapidly up-regulated during LPS-induced inflammation in certain organs and tissues (2Shouda T. Yoshida T. Hanada T. Wakioka T. Oishi M. Miyoshi K.

We had reported previously immunoblot evidence that STAT3, which is activated downstream in IL-6/gp130 signaling, is also activated in LPS-induced retinal inflammation (4Kurihara T. Ozawa Y. Shinoda K. Nagai N. Inoue M. Oike Y. Tsubota K. Ishida S. Okano H. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2006; 47: 5545-5552Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In the present study, we used immunohistochemistry to learn which cells express activated STAT3. In the control retina, we detected activated STAT3 in retinal ganglion cells (RGC) and some of the inner nuclear layer cells (INL) in their nuclei (Fig. 1, F and G) but not in the photoreceptor cells (Fig. 1F). Eight hours after LPS injection, activated STAT3 was up-regulated in the retinal ganglion and inner nuclear layer cells, and moreover, activated STAT3 appeared in a subset of photoreceptor cells as well (Fig. 1H, arrows). Sixteen hours after LPS injection, activated STAT3 was obvious in most of the photoreceptor cells in the ONL (Fig. 1I). Thus, STAT3 activation was gradually, not rapidly, up-regulated in the photoreceptor cells by 16 h after LPS administration. In the photoreceptor cells, activated STAT3 (Fig. 1, J and K, green) was observed mainly in the cytoplasm with slight expression in the nuclei (Fig. 1K, pink). Generally, STAT3 is transported into the nucleus as soon as it is phosphorylated, where it up-regulates the transcription of its target genes (29Reich N.C. Liu L. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 6: 602-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). However, some cytosolic phosphorylated form of STAT3 activated by the IL-6/gp130 signal has been found in the endosomal fraction as well, which then translocates into the nucleus and activates transcription (29Reich N.C. Liu L. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 6: 602-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 30Shah M. Patel K. Mukhopadhyay S. Xu F. Guo G. Sehgal P.B. J. Biol.

The activated STAT3 in the photoreceptor cells may have different kinetics from that in the retinal ganglion and inner nuclear layer cells, but it may also act as a transcription regulator in both cases. As regards activated ERK, another pathway downstream of IL-6/gp130 signaling, it was observed mainly in the cells of the inner layers, and hardly any was detected in the photoreceptor cells (data not shown). Down-regulation of Rhodopsin Is More Severe and ERG Changes More Prolonged in SOCS3-deficient Mice after LPS Injection—Previous findings had suggested the correlation between STAT3 activation and down-regulation of rhodopsin protein during retinal inflammation (4Kurihara T. Ozawa Y. Shinoda K. Nagai N. Inoue M. Oike Y. Tsubota K. Ishida S. Okano H. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2006; 47: 5545-5552Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). If this was correct, it seemed likely that SOCS3 inhibited STAT3 activation in the photoreceptor cells to avoid the decrease in rhodopsin. To investigate this possibility, we obtained mice with a SOCS3-deficient retina by generating retina-specific conditional knock-out mice (α-Cre SOCS3flox/flox mice), because the total knock-out mutation in mice is embryonic lethal (32Roberts A.W. Robb L. Rakar S. Hartley L. Cluse L. Nicola N.A. Metcalf D. Hilton D.J. Alexander W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9324-9329Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The α-Cre recombinase is expressed only in the retina; its expression begins at embryonic day 12 (15Marquardt T. Ashery-Padan R. Andrejewski N. Scardigli R. Guillemot F. Gruss P.

Within the P2X family, P2X7 subunits are unique in possessing an extended carboxyl tail. We expressed the human P2X7 subunit as two complementary fragments, a carboxyl tail-truncated receptor channel core (residues 1-436 or 1-505) and a tail extension (residues 434-595) in Xenopus laevis oocytes. P2X7 channel core subunits efficiently assembled as homotrimers that appeared abundantly at the oocyte surface, yet produced only ∼5% of the full-length P2X7 receptor current. Co-assembly of channel core subunits with full-length P2X7 subunits inhibited channel current, indicating that the lack of a single carboxyl tail domain is dominant-negative for P2X7 receptor activity. Co-expression of the tail extension as a discrete protein increased ATP-gated current amplitudes of P2X7 channel cores 10-20-fold, fully reconstituting the wild type electrophysiological phenotype of the P2X7 receptor. Chemical cross-linking revealed that the discrete tail extension bound with unity stoichiometry to the carboxyl tail of the P2X7 channel core. We conclude that a non-covalent association of crucial functional importance exists between the carboxyl tail of the channel core and the tail extension. Using a slightly shorter P2X7 subunit core and subfragments of the tail extension, this association could be narrowed down to include residues 409-436 and 434-494 of the split receptor. Together, these results identify the tail extension as a regulatory gating module, potentially making P2X7 channel gating sensitive to intracellular regulation.

Together, these results identify the tail extension as a regulatory gating module, potentially making P2X7 channel gating sensitive to intracellular regulation. The P2X7 receptor, an ATP-gated cation channel, is expressed predominantly in immune cells (such as macrophages and lymphocytes), glial cells, and epithelial cells (for recent reviews, see Refs. 1Ferrari D. Pizzirani C. Adinolfi E. Lemoli R.M. Curti A. Idzko M. Panther E. Di Virgilio F. J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 3877-3883Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar and 2Khakh B.S. North R.A. Nature. 2006; 442: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). Activation of the P2X7 receptor has been implicated in pivotal inflammatory responses resulting from ATP-stimulated pro-inflammatory cytokine release (particularly of interleukin-1β and interleukin-18) through exosomes (3Qu Y. Franchi L. Nunez G. Dubyak G.R. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 1913-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar) during cell proliferation and apoptosis (1Ferrari D. Pizzirani C. Adinolfi E. Lemoli R.M.

Nature. 2006; 442: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). These functions of the P2X7 receptor have been attributed to its unusual dual role as a classic ligand-gated channel for small cations and as a cytolytic pore (4Surprenant A. Rassendren F. Kawashima E. North R.A. Buell G. Science. 1996; 272: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1519) Google Scholar, 5Rassendren F. Buell G.N. Virginio C. Collo G. North R.A. Surprenant A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5482-5486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Cloning of the P2X7 receptor revealed a typical P2X subunit “core” structure, with a short cytoplasmic NH2-terminal tail and two transmembrane segments connected by a large N-glycosylated ectodomain. However, the P2X7 receptor has a carboxyl tail extension that is 120-200 amino acids longer than that of the other six P2X family members, P2X1-P2X6 (4Surprenant A. Rassendren F. Kawashima E. North R.A. Buell G. Science. 1996; 272: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1519) Google Scholar, 5Rassendren F. Buell G.N. Virginio C. Collo G. North R.A. Surprenant A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5482-5486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Because the cytolytic pore-forming ability of P2X7 is not shared by the other P2X receptor subtypes, this function has been plausibly assigned to the long carboxyl tail. Indeed, truncation of most of the extra portion of the carboxyl tail of P2X7 prevented cytolytic pore formation, apparently without affecting the function of the receptor as an ATP-gated channel for small cations (4Surprenant A. Rassendren F. Kawashima E. North R.A. Buell G. Science. 1996; 272: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1519) Google Scholar, 5Rassendren F. Buell G.N. Virginio C. Collo G. North R.A. Surprenant A. J.

Additional functions distinct from cytolytic pore formation that have been assigned to the carboxyl tail include interactions with adaptor and effector proteins (6Kim M. Jiang L.H. Wilson H.L.

Conflicting data have been published as to whether the cytolytic pore is formed by the P2X7 receptor itself through progressive dilatation of the cation-conducting pore from 7 Å to up to 40 Å (12Virginio C. MacKenzie A. North R.A. Surprenant A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 519: 335-346Crossref Scopus (326) Google Scholar), or secondarily by the opening of a distinct accessory channel (13Schilling W.P.

Support for the view that P2X7 receptor-induced permeability increases must be secondary to P2X7 receptor activation was provided by single-channel analysis of P2X7 receptor kinetics, which showed that pore dilatation observed in macroscopic current recordings had no molecular correlate at the single P2X7 channel level (16Riedel T. Lozinsky I. Schmalzing G. Markwardt F. Biophys. J. 2007; 92: 2377-2391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 17Riedel T. Schmalzing G. Markwardt F. Biophys. J. 2007; 93: 846-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The P2X7 receptor subunit might be regarded as consisting of two structurally and functionally distinct parts: an NH2-terminal receptor core (comprising roughly two-thirds of the polypeptide chain) sufficient for ligand-gated channel opening and cation permeation, and a carboxyl tail (the remaining one-third of the polypeptide) harboring topogenic information and a series of protein recruitment domains, but dispensable for channel gating and cation permeation. Because we previously observed that COOH-terminal truncation of the human P2X7 (hP2X7) subunit at a position (residue 436) expected to allow for efficient surface expression (10Smart M.L. Gu B.

Chem. 2003; 278: 8853-8860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) greatly reduced the current amplitudes compared with the wild type hP2X7 receptor (18Klapperstück M. Büttner C. Schmalzing G. Markwardt F. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 534: 25-35Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar), we asked whether the carboxyl tail contributes in an unknown manner to P2X7 receptor channel function. Here, we addressed this issue by co-expressing the truncated tail portion and the carboxyl tail-truncated hP2X7 receptor core as discrete proteins and testing for functional restoration. We show the ability of the truncated tail portion to fully restore the wild type electrophysiological phenotype by physically interacting with the carboxyl tail of the hP2X7 receptor core. These results define a novel function of the carboxyl tail as a modulator of the gating of the hP2X7 receptor.

To generate truncation mutants of the 595-amino acid hP2X7 subunit (shown schematically in Fig. 1A), premature stop codons were inserted by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany) COOH-terminal to the second transmembrane domain at codon positions His408, Phe436, and Ala505; the corresponding constructs were designated hP2X71-408, hP2X71-436, and hP2X71-505, respectively. To generate constructs encoding subfragments of the COOH-terminal domain of the hP2X7 subunit, COOH-terminal domain cDNAs (codons Met434-Tyr595, Glu465-Tyr595, and Glu495-Tyr595) were amplified by PCR using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene). The PCR products were restriction digested with NsiI/XbaI and directionally subcloned into the oocyte expression vector pNKS2 (20Gloor S. Pongs O. Schmalzing G. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 160: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) to yield hP2X7434-595 (Fig. 1A), hP2X7465-595, and hP2X7495-595. Constructs were NH2 terminally fused to an initiating ATG codon, followed by the coding sequence for a hexahistidine tag. In addition, His-hP2X71-436, hP2X7434-595, hP2X7465-595, and hP2X7495-595 were COOH terminally fused to the coding sequence for a StrepII tag (NWSHPQFEK) to allow for purification of the expressed proteins by two different affinity chromatography media (see below).

Protein Expression in Xenopus laevis Oocytes—Capped cRNA was synthesized from linearized templates with SP6 RNA polymerase (Epicenter Biotechnologies, Madison, WI). It was then purified and quantified based on its absorbance at 260 nm. Fully defolliculated stage V-VI X. laevis oocytes were obtained by collagenase treatment as previously described (16Riedel T. Lozinsky I. Schmalzing G. Markwardt F. Biophys. J. 2007; 92: 2377-2391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The cRNAs were injected singly or in various pairwise combinations at 1 or 50 ng/oocyte for patch clamping or two-electrode voltage clamping, respectively. Until use 1-3 days later, the oocytes were maintained at 19 °C in a modified Barth solution containing the following (in mm): 100 NaCl, 1 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, and 5 or 10 Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4, supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin or 50 μg/ml gentamycin. Two-electrode Voltage-clamp and Single-channel Recordings—One to 3 days after cRNA injection, membrane currents were recorded by two-electrode voltage clamping at ≈22 °C and a holding potential of -40 mV, exactly as described previously (18Klapperstück M. Büttner C. Schmalzing G. Markwardt F. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 534: 25-35Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Single hP2X7 channel recordings were performed on excised outside-out patches from X. laevis oocytes, and analyzed as previously described (16Riedel T. Lozinsky I. Schmalzing G. Markwardt F. Biophys.

The statistical significance (p < 0.05) of the differences between means was determined by one-way analysis of variance, followed by a Bonferroni multiple comparison t test using Jandel Sigmastat statistical software (SPSS, Chicago, IL). The Sigmaplot program (SPSS) was used for function fitting and graphical representation of the data. Metabolic [35S]Methionine and Surface Labeling of Oocytes—For metabolic radiolabeling of oocyte-expressed proteins, cRNA-injected oocytes were incubated overnight with l-[35S]methionine (>40 TBq/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at ∼100 MBq/ml (0.4 MBq per oocyte) in modified Barth solution at 19 °C. After an additional 24- or 48-h chase period, plasma membrane-bound proteins were selectively labeled using the amino-reactive fluorescent dye Cy5 N-hydroxysuccimide (NHS) ester (GE Healthcare), which is membrane-impermeant due to its two sulfonic acid groups. Shortly before Cy5 dye addition, oocytes were washed in oocyte-phosphate-buffered saline at pH 8.5 (in mm: 20 sodium phosphate, 110 NaCl, 1 MgCl2), and then incubated for 30 min at ambient temperature (21-24 °C) with the Cy5 dye, which was diluted 200-fold from a dimethyl sulfoxide stock solution to a final concentration of 50 μg/ml. The reaction was terminated by washing the cells with oocyte-phosphate-buffered saline, followed by membrane protein extraction with digitonin and receptor purification (see below). In some experiments, hP2X7 receptor constructs at the plasma membrane were selectively labeled with 125I-labeled sulfosuccinimidyl-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propionate exactly as described previously (21Aschrafi A.

Chemical Cross-linking—Oocytes were lysed in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, supplemented with 1% digitonin and one of two reversible, homobifunctional cross-linkers (Pierce): the membrane-impermeable NHS ester DTSSP (3,3′-dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidylpropionate)) or its membrane-permeable analogue DSP (dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate)). DTSSP and DSP were dissolved just before use in sodium citrate buffer, pH 5.0, or dry dimethyl sulfoxide, respectively, and diluted to the desired concentration in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, 1% digitonin. The cross-linking reaction was initiated by adding this reaction mixture to the cells and immediately lysing the cells by passing them through a 200-μl pipette tip. After 30 min of incubation at 21 °C, excess cross-linker was quenched by the addition of Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, to a final concentration of 50 mm. A digitonin extract was then prepared from the cells, from which hP2X7 receptor proteins were purified by affinity chromatography as detailed below. Affinity Purification and PAGE—Proteins from digitonin (1.0%) extracts of oocytes were purified by Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) or by Strep-Tactin™ Sepharose (IBA, Göttingen, Germany) affinity chromatography. Proteins were eluted from Ni-NTA-agarose or Strep-Tactin Sepharose with the appropriate non-denaturing elution buffer consisting of 0.5% digitonin and 250 mm imidazole/HCl, pH 7.4, or 2.5 mm d-desthiobiotin in 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA, respectively.

For partial dissociation of natively purified hP2X7 receptor complexes into lower-order oligomers (down to single polypeptides), samples were treated for 1 h at 37 °C with 0.1% SDS with or without 0.1 m dithiothreitol as indicated before loading onto the blue native PAGE gel. For SDS-PAGE, proteins were supplemented with the appropriate SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 20 or 50 mm dithiothreitol, followed by heating to 56 °C for 15 min. Denatured samples were electrophoresed in parallel with 14C-labeled molecular mass markers (Rainbow™, GE Healthcare) and blue-stained mass markers (Precision Plus Protein All Blue Standard, Bio-Rad). Cy5-labeled proteins were visualized by scanning of the wet SDS-PAGE gel with a fluorescence scanner (Typhoon, GE Healthcare). For subsequent visualization of radiolabeled proteins, the SDS-PAGE gel was fixed, dried, exposed to a PhosphorImager screen and scanned using a Storm 820 PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare). Individual bands were quantified with ImageQuant software. All biochemical experiments were performed at least in triplicate. Macroscopic hP2X7 Receptor Current Kinetics Are Strongly Affected by Truncation, but Are Restored by Co-expression of the Truncated Carboxyl Tail—Fig. 1, B-F, shows typical traces of currents induced by 1 mm free ATP (ATP4-) and recorded by the two-electrode voltage-clamp method from intact X. laevis oocytes expressing the indicated hP2X7 constructs. The ATP-induced wild type current consists of two components, an exponentially saturating current a (see labeling in Fig. 1B) and a linearly increasing current b that are directly hP2X7 receptor-mediated and, evidently, secondary to activation of oocyte-endogenous channels, respectively (18Klapperstück M. Büttner C. Schmalzing G. Markwardt F. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 534: 25-35Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Based on concentration-response analysis, it is known that high-affinity and low-affinity sites for ATP4- (KD values of ∼4 and ∼220 μm) are responsible for ∼10 and ∼90%, respectively, of the exponentially saturating current a (18Klapperstück M. Büttner C. Schmalzing G. Markwardt F. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 534: 25-35Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The deactivating current may also be separated into two distinct components characterized by fast and slow exponential decay (c and d in Fig. 1B). Truncation of the hP2X7 receptor at position 436 strongly diminished the ATP-induced current amplitude, causing a leftward shift in the concentration-response curve for ATP (Fig. 1N), and abolishing the exponentially saturating current a as well as the linearly increasing and the fast deactivating current components (Fig. 1C). All of these effects may be explained kinetically by a selective functional loss of ATP activation at the low-affinity site; the leftward shift of the concentration-response curve results from the unchanged current activation of the high-affinity site (18Klapperstück M. Büttner C. Schmalzing G. Markwardt F. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 534: 25-35Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Remarkably, co-expression of the hP2X71-436 receptor core with the hP2X7434-595 carboxyl tail as discrete polypeptides increased the ATP-induced current amplitude ∼15-fold, reaching a value near that of the non-split full-length hP2X7 (Fig. 1, D, G, and H). Similar results were obtained for a mutant hP2X7 truncated at position 505, hP2X71-505 (Fig. 1, E and F). Two observations indicate that this stimulating effect specifically involves the carboxyl tail-truncated hP2X7 receptor cores: (i) expression of the hP2X7434-595 tail alone did not lead to ATP-activated currents (data not shown), and (ii) currents mediated by the wild type hP2X7 receptors were not significantly affected by co-expression of the carboxyl tail (cf. Fig. 5D, left two bars). To provide a quantitative basis for this observation, the activating part of the hP2X7 receptor current (Iact(t)) during ATP4- application was fitted according to the following equation. lact(t)=lact,∞⋅(1-e-tτact)+s⋅t+l0(Eq. 1) In other words, the current time course was approximated by the sum of an exponentially saturating and a linearly increasing component (18Klapperstück M. Büttner C. Schmalzing G. Markwardt F. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 534: 25-35Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar), where Iact,∞ is the amplitude of the exponentially saturating current a (cf. Fig. 1, B-F) after an infinite time of agonist application, τact is the activation time constant, s is the slope of the linearly rising current, and I0 is the steady-state current without ATP4- application. The best approximation of the deactivating current (Ideact(t)) during washout of ATP4- was achieved using a bi-exponentially decaying function, ldeact(t)=ldeact,1⋅e-tτdeact,1+ldeact,2⋅e-tτdeact,2+l0(Eq. 2) where I0 has the same meaning as in Equation 1, Ideact,1 and Ideact,2 are the initial amplitudes, and τdeact,1 and τdeact,2 are the time constants of the slow and fast deactivating component, respectively. The loss of both the linearly increasing and the fast decaying current component upon COOH-terminal truncation of the hP2X7 receptor at position F436 is substantiated by the statistical analysis (Fig. 1, G-M). The current amplitude Iact,6s elicited by 6-s applications of different concentrations of ATP4- ([ATP4-]) (see Fig. 1B) was used to define the ATP4- concentration dependence of the full-length and split hP2X7 receptors. To account for cell-to-cell variation in receptor expression, the activating current Iact,6s ([ATP4-]) was normalized to the current measured at 1 mm ATP4-. The concentration-response curves of the calculated relative amplitudes Irel ([ATP4-]) of the full-length hP2X7 receptor and the co-expressed split hP2X7 constructs were fitted to a model of two equal high-affinity and two equal low-affinity non-cooperative activating sites (18Klapperstück M. Büttner C. Schmalzing G. Markwardt F. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 534: 25-35Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1N) as shown, lrel([ATP4-])=lact,6s([ATP4-])lact,6s([1 mMATP4-])=lrel,∞,1(1+10-log KD,1C)2+lrel,∞,2(1+10-log KD,2C)2(Eq. 3) where Irel,∞,1 and Irel,∞,2 are the maximal relative current components contributing to Irel ([ATP4-]) after saturating of the effector sites at infinite agonist concentrations with apparent dissociation constants KD,1 and KD,2, respectively. A coefficient of 2 yielded higher correlation coefficients than models having one, three, or more than three equal effector sites. This model fitted the data significantly better (26Horn R. Biophys. J. 1987; 51: 255-263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) than a simpler model assuming only one effector site (Irel,∞,2 = 0). The calculated pKD values for the high-affinity and low-affinity ATP4- effector sites were not significantly different from the full-length hP2X7 receptor (pKD,1 = -5.5 ± 0.4, pKD,2 = -3.6 ± 0.2, mean ± S.E.) or the hP2X71-436 truncation mutant co-expressed with the hP2X7434-595 carboxyl tail (pKD,1 = -5.6 ± 0.8, pKD,2 = -3.9 ± 0.3). Curve-fitting further indicated that the high-affinity and low-affinity effector sites accounted, in both cases, for ∼10 and ∼90% of the ATP-induced current, respectively. The concentration-response curve for the truncation mutant alone could best be described by a function with only one kind of effector site (Irel,∞,2 = 0) displaying high-affinity for ATP4-. The calculated pKD,1 = -5.4 ± 0.1 was not significantly different from that of the apparent high-affinity effector site of the wild type hP2X7 receptor or the hP2X71-436 receptor core co-expressed with the hP2X7434-595 tail domain. The apparent leftward shift of the concentration-response curve is fully compatible with the view that activation of the hP2X71-436 receptor core is mediated only by the high-affinity effector site and that the gating effect of the low-affinity site is abolished by the truncation. The more right-handed position of the concentration-response curve for the (intact or split) full-length P2X7 receptor is predominantly determined by the low-affinity effector site, which accounts for ∼9-fold more current than the high-affinity site. The marked changes in the ATP4--gated membrane currents might result from a reduction in receptor synthesis, assembly, surface trafficking, channel function, or a combination of these factors. Carboxyl tail-truncated hP2X7 receptors efficiently assembled stable homotrimers as evidenced by their migration in blue native PAGE gels (Fig. 2, A and B), thus excluding an assembly defect as an explanation for the weak receptor function. To assess cell surface expression, we labeled plasma membrane-bound hP2X7 receptors with a membrane-impermeant, amino-reactive fluorophore, Cy5 NHS ester, and visualized the SDS-PAGE-separated receptor subunits by fluorescence scanning (Fig. 2C). Because the synthesized proteins were also metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine, the total receptor pool (surface plus internal) could be visualized by phosphorimaging autoradiography of the same SDS-PAGE gel (Fig. 2D). Quantification of SDS-PAGE-resolved, surface-labeled receptors established that the large increase in ATP-gated membrane current upon co-expression of hP2X71-436 and hP2X7434-595 was not paralleled by a proportional increase in the cell surface expression (Fig. 2C) or total expression (Fig. 2D) of the hP2X71-436 truncation mutant. In fact, co-expression of the hP2X7434-595 carboxyl tail decreased rather than increased cell surface abundance of the truncated hP2X71-436 receptor (Fig. 2, C, lanes 5 and 6, and E). We consider this effect to result specifically from the interaction of the hP2X71-436 receptor with the hP2X7434-595 carboxyl tail and an ensuing hP2X7434-595 domain-dependent change of the intracellular trafficking of the holoprotein toward the trafficking properties of the wild type hP2X7 receptor. Together, these findings indicate that the carboxyl tail domain boosts hP2X71-436 channel function by a mechanism that is independent of plasma membrane incorporation. Characterization of a Split hP2X7 Receptor at the Single-channel Level—To unequivocally exclude any contribution of a contaminating current component to the effects observed at the macroscopic whole cell level, we recorded ATP4--induced single-channel activity in excised outside-out patches from oocytes expressing the full-length and a split hP2X7 receptor. Oocytes expressing the wild type hP2X7 receptor (Fig. 3A) or co-expressing the truncated hP2X71-505 receptor and the hP2X7434-595 carboxyl tail (Fig. 3B)"
https://openalex.org/W2072481196,"Establishing what information is actively maintained in working memory (WM) and how it is represented and controlled is essential to understanding how such information guides future behavior. WM has traditionally been investigated in terms of the maintenance of stimulus-specific information, such as locations or words. More recently, investigators have emphasized the importance of rules that establish relationships between those stimuli and the pending response. The current study used a mental arithmetic task with fMRI to test whether updating of numbers (i.e., stimuli) and updating of mathematical operations (i.e., rules) in WM relies on the same neural system. Results indicate that, while a common network is activated by both types of updating, rule updating preferentially activates prefrontal cortex while number updating preferentially activates parietal cortex. The results suggest that both numbers and rules are maintained in WM but that they are different types of information that are controlled independently."

Shear stress also induces a time- and strain-dependent degradation of keratin IFs, and the current study examines the mechanisms involved in degradation of keratin proteins in human A549 cells exposed to 0–24 h of shear stress (7.5–30 dynes/cm2). Ubiquitin was found to be covalently associated with keratin proteins immunoprecipitated from shear-stressed cells, and pretreatment with the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 prevented the degradation of the keratin IF network. Importantly, phosphorylation of K8 Ser-73 is required for the shear stress-mediated ubiquitination, disassembly, and degradation of the keratin IF network. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that shear stress caused the thin array of keratin fibrils observed in control cells to be reorganized into a perinuclear aggregate, known as an aggresome, and that ubiquitin was also associated with this structure. Finally, the E2 enzymes, UbcH5b, -c, and Ubc3, but not E2-25K are required for the shear stress-mediated ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation of keratin proteins.

Mechanical stimuli are important modulators of cellular function; this is especially true in the mechanically ventilated lungs of patients with acute lung injury.

Dis. 1989; 139: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The prototype structure of all IF proteins, including keratins, consists of a structurally conserved central coiled-coil α-helix termed the “rod” that is flanked by non-α-helical N-terminal “head” and C-terminal “tail” domains (6Herrmann H. Aebi U. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Most of the structural heterogeneity of the different keratins resides in their head and tail domains, which contain the sites for several post-translational modifications including phosphorylation and ubiquitination. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPP) (10Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6876) Google Scholar) is involved in regulating the cell cycle, signal transduction, differentiation, and stress response. Most of these functions are mediated by the conditional turnover of regulatory and structural proteins (10Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6876) Google Scholar, 11Ciechanover A. Orian A. Schwartz A.L. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 34: 40-51Crossref Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 12Shang F. Gong X. Taylor A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23086-23093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The process begins with activation of ubiquitin by the ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1) (10Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6876) Google Scholar), followed by transfer of ubiquitin to E2, an ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. E2 shuttles the ubiquitin molecule to the substrate-specific ubiquitin ligase (E3), which then delivers the ubiquitin to the substrate to be degraded. Polyubiquitin chain formation continues by the conjugation of subsequent ubiquitin moieties to the attached ubiquitin, and the substrate-ubiquitin conjugate is then degraded by the 26 S proteasome in an ATP-dependent manner. Isopeptidases cleave the ubiquitin chain, and the single ubiquitin molecules are recycled (10Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6876) Google Scholar). We examined the assembly state of keratin IFs in human A549 cells and found that shear stress results in the disassembly and degradation of keratin proteins via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Inhibition of the proteasome prevents the degradation of keratin proteins in shear-stressed cells. Interestingly, recognition of the keratin protein for ubiquitination, and subsequent degradation, appears to be dependent upon the phosphorylation of K8 Ser-73 via protein kinase C (1Ridge K. Linz L.

Thus, phosphorylated keratin IF proteins are targeted for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in A549 cells in response to a mechanical stimulus.

Subsequently, cells were labeled for 30 min with a mixture of [35S]methionine/cysteine (200 μCi/ml; EaseTag™ mix, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and then exposed to shear stress (30 dynes/cm2) in the presence of pre-warmed Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5 mm unlabeled l-methionine/l-cysteine. At the indicated times, the cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, collected, and then an equal number of cells were resuspended in identical volumes of TX-100 containing buffer and centrifuged at low speeds to obtain soluble and insoluble fractions. Keratin 8/18 was immunoprecipitated from both fractions as described above in the presence of serine protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). And then pre-absorbed for 1 h with protein-A/G plus and incubated with anti-K8 and K18 antibodies overnight at 20 °C followed by a 3-h incubation with protein-A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Next, the agarose beads were washed five times with modified lysis buffer containing 0.1% digitonin and then mixed with a modified 2× loading sample buffer (2.5% SDS, 0.1 m dithiothreitol, 0.06 m Tris base, 20% glycerol, 0.008 m EDTA, pH 6.8). Proteins were separated on 7.5% or 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Gels were stained, fixed in 50% methanol, 10% acetic acid, then treated with Fluorenhance (Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min, dried, and exposed to either x-ray film (Hyperfilm; (Eastman Kodak Co.) at 80 °C for 16–24 h or put on an intensifying screen for quantification with a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Samples were also taken for scintillation counting. Transient Transfections of Dominant Negative (DN) Constructs—A549 cells were transiently transfected with ∼2.5 μg of a cDNA coding the dominant-negative UbcH5a, -b, -c, Ubc3, and E2–25K (DN-UbH5a, DN-UbH5b, DN-UbH5c, DN-Ubc3, or DN-E2–25K, respectively). All constructs were tagged with His. The Amaxa Nucleofector apparatus (Amaxa, Cologne, Germany) was used for transfection. 2.5 μg of plasmid DNA was mixed with 0.1 ml of cell suspension, transferred to a 2.0 mm electroporation cuvette and nucleofected. DNA quantity, cell concentration, and buffer volume were kept constant for all experiments. After electroporation, cells were immediately transferred to 2.0 ml of complete medium, and cultured at 37 °C until analysis. Viability of cells immediately after transfection was determined by trypan blue exclusion. Miscellaneous—Lactate dehydrogenase release was measured using a commercially available assay (Cytotoxicity Detection kit, Roche Pharmaceuticals, Indianapolis, IN). Protein content was determined according to Bradford using a commercial dye reagent (Bio-Rad). Statistical Analysis—Comparisons were performed using the unpaired Student's t test. One-way analysis of variance with Tukey's test was used to analyze the data. p < 0.05 values were considered significant. Effect of Shear Stress on Keratin Protein Turnover—A549 cells exposed to shear stress (7.5, 15, and 30 dynes/cm2) for 16 h exhibit a strain-dependent decrease in K8 and K18 protein levels (Fig. 1A). This decrease in protein abundance may be a reflection of increased degradation or changes in the rate of transcription/translation of the protein. To test for increased degradation, we examined the effect of shear stress on the stability of keratin proteins in the absence of new protein synthesis by adding cycloheximide (CHX). A549 cells were exposed to shear stress (30 dynes/cm2) for 0, 8, and 16 h in the presence CHX (μm); at the end of each time point total cell lysates were prepared. Under control conditions, keratin protein levels were reduced by ∼10 and 40% after 8 and 16 h, respectively. In contrast, A549 cells exposed to shear stress had a ∼50 and 75% decrease in keratin protein levels after 8 and 16 h, respectively (Fig. 1B) indicating that keratin proteins were degraded following exposure to prolonged shear stress. To determine whether the rates of degradation were different for soluble or insoluble (particles or filaments) keratin proteins, pulse chase experiments were performed. A549 cells were labeled for 30 min with [35S]methionine and chased with medium containing a 10-fold excess of unlabeled methionine for 0, 4, 8, 16, 24 h. A549 cells were simultaneously exposed to shear stress (30 dynes/cm2) during the chase. Proteins were separated into TX-100 soluble and insoluble fractions followed by immunoprecipitation of keratin using an anti-keratin 8 antibody. As shown in Fig. 1C, under control conditions the TX-100 insoluble, filamentous keratin protein (open squares, dashed line) has a half-life of ∼20 h, which is in agreement with previous reports. The TX-100 soluble, non-filamentous keratin protein has a half-life of ∼10 h (Fig. 1C, closed square, dashed line). Shear stress significantly alters the half-life of both insoluble and soluble keratin proteins, 8 and 4 h, respectively, as compared with control (Fig. 1C, open and closed circles, solid lines). A549 cells exposed to shear stress (30 dynes/cm2) for 0, 4, 8, and 16 h exhibited a time-dependent decrease in the amount of TX-100 insoluble (i.e. pelletable, filamentous) K8 and K18; which coincided with significant increases in the TX-100 soluble (i.e. non-filamentous, disassembled) keratin 8 and 18 protein levels detected in the supernatant (Fig. 2A; see “Experimental Procedures”). These results are in agreement with our previously published report (1Ridge K. Linz L. Flitney F. Kuczmarski E. Chou Y. Omary M. Sznajder J. Goldman R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30400-30405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2B, when the membrane was re-blotted with an anti-ubiquitin antibody, a high molecular weight smear, representing ubiquitinated keratin, was observed in TX-100 insoluble fraction (filamentous protein) extracted from A549 cells exposed to shear stress for either 8 or 16 h (Fig. 2B). However, the strongest ubiquitin signal was associated with the TX-100 soluble fraction (non-filamentous protein) extracted from shear-stressed A549 cells. The ubiquitinated conjugates migrated primarily as a high molecular weight smear, shown by the arrow, although lower molecular weight bands were also detected in TX-100 soluble fraction (Fig. 2B). To determine if keratin IF proteins were degraded via the UPP, A549 cells were treated with proteasome inhibitor MG132 (50 μm) and subsequently exposed to shear stress. Total cell lysates (Fig. 3A) and keratin proteins fractionated in TX-100 soluble and insoluble fractions (Fig. 3B), separated on SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with antibodies against K8/K18 and ubiquitin were analyzed. The shear stress-induced degradation of keratin 8 and 18 was prevented in A549 cells incubated with MG132. Effect of Mechanical Stimuli on the Keratin IF Network in A549 Cells—We previously observed that shear stress induces changes in the keratin IF network (1Ridge K. Linz L. Flitney F. Kuczmarski E. Chou Y. Omary M. Sznajder J. Goldman R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30400-30405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). To determine whether ubiquitin is associated with keratin proteins, A549 cells exposed to shear stress were fixed and processed for indirect immunofluorescence using anti-K8/K18 and anti-ubiquitin antibodies. In cells exposed to shear stress for 16 h, ubiquitin was associated with a filamentous staining pattern which co-localized with keratin IFs (Fig. 4, panels A–C). Between 16 and 24 h, we observed the formation of Mallory bodies/aggresomes and both keratin and ubiquitin proteins were co-localized in this perinuclear structure (Fig. 4, panels D–F). By 36 h, the keratin IF network was extensively disassembled and the non-filamentous keratin particles or “dots” co-localized with ubiquitin (Fig. 4, panels G–I). Keratin and ubiquitin were not associated in control cells (data not shown). Phosphorylation of K8 Ser-73 Acts as a Signal Recognition for Ubiquitin Conjugation—Previously, we reported that the phosphorylation of K8 pSer-73, but not K8 pSer-23 or K8 pSer-43, was associated with the shear stress-mediated disassembly of the keratin IF network (1Ridge K. Linz L. Flitney F. Kuczmarski E. Chou Y. Omary M. Sznajder J. Goldman R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30400-30405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). To determine whether the phosphorylation of K8 Ser-73 was required for substrate recognition by ubiquitin A549 cells were stably transfected GFP-K8 or GFP-K8 S73A constructs. These cells were exposed to shear stress (30 dynes/cm2, 16 h), the GFP-tagged K8 was immunoprecipitated, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred, and immunoblotted with anti-K8 and anti-ubiquitin antibodies. As shown in Fig. 5 (upper panel), ubiquitin was not covalently associated with GFP-tagged K8S73A in either control or shear-stressed cells. As anticipated, the wild-type GFP-tagged K8 was covalently associated with ubiquitin in cells exposed to shear stress. In Fig. 5 (lower panel), we examined whether expression of the mutant GFP-tagged K8S73A affected the keratin IF network in either control or shear stress cells as compared with GFP-tagged K8. Stably transfected A549 cells exposed to shear stress were fixed and processed for indirect immunofluorescence using anti-K8 and direct immunofluorescence for GFP. In GFP-K8S73A cells exposed to shear stress for ∼16 h, the endogenous keratin IF network (red channel) was disassembled; in contrast the GFP-K8S73A IF network was not affected following exposure to shear stress. In the GFP-K8 cells exposed to shear stress both the endogenous keratin (red channel) and GFP-K8 (green channel) IF networks were disassembled, as compared with static control cells. Ubiquitin Carrier Proteins Involved in Shear Stress-mediated Degradation of Keratin IF Proteins—To study the role of UbcH5a, -b, -c, Ubc3, and E2–25K in the degradation of keratin IF proteins, we tested whether DN constructs of the enzymes had an effect on the shear stressed-induced degradation of keratin IF proteins in A549 cells. As shown in Fig. 6, transient expression of DN Ubc3, UbcH5b, UbcH5c, and to a lesser extent UbcH5a (data not shown), significantly inhibit the shear stress-mediated degradation of keratin IF proteins. In A549 cells transiently transfected with the DN E2–25K or mock-transfected, the keratin IF proteins are degraded following exposure to shear stress. Transfection efficiency was assessed by the expression of His protein (data not shown). Cells transfected with the dominant negative ligase constructs had no changes in cell death, as measured by lactate dehydrogenase levels (data not shown), as compared with non-transfected control cells. The physiological significance of keratin IF networks becomes evident in disease conditions, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), wherein the loss of the mechanical integrity of the lung epithelium results in flooding of lung airspaces with plasma, impaired gas exchange, and consequent patient mortality. Mechanical ventilation is often required to manage patients with acute respiratory failure of different origins. However, mechanical ventilation itself can also cause or exacerbate lung injury, resulting in ventilator induced lung injury (VILI) (16Lecuona E. Saldias F. Comellas A. Ridge K. Guerrero C. Sznajder J.I. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1999; 159: 603-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 17Sznajder J.I. Ridge K.M. Saumon G. Dreyfuss D. Matthay M. Ingbar D. Pulmonary Edema. 13. Marcel Dekker, 1998: 413-430Google Scholar). The mechanisms associated with VILI have not been fully elucidated but it is believed that the opening of a fluid-filled, collapsed airway generates a shear force across the epithelium (18Bilek A.M. Dee K.C. Gaver III, D.P. J. Appl. Physiol. 2003; 94: 770-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). These harmful mechanoforces within the lung are borne by the lung epithelial cells (1Ridge K. Linz L. Flitney F. Kuczmarski E. Chou Y. Omary M. Sznajder J. Goldman R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30400-30405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 13Sivaramakrishnan S. DeGiulio J.V. Lorand L. Goldman R.D. Ridge K.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 889-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The shear stress gradient generated under these conditions has been estimated to be between 5 and 325 dynes/cm2 (18Bilek A.M. Dee K.C. Gaver III, D.P. J. Appl. Physiol. 2003; 94: 770-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Hence in this study we used a shear stress of 7.5–30 dyn/cm2 to examine mechanisms involved in the degradation of the keratin IF network to approximate the in vivo pathophysiologic conditions. It is important to note that the shear stresses used in our study are much greater than in vivo normal physiological levels (no shear stress for normal alveolar epithelial cells and 5–7 dyn/cm2 on endothelial cells). We have previously reported that shear stress alters the assembly state of the keratin IF network in alveolar epithelial cells via a PKC-dependent phosphorylation of K8 pSer 73 (1Ridge K. Linz L. Flitney F. Kuczmarski E. Chou Y. Omary M. Sznajder J. Goldman R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30400-30405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Changes in the assembly state of IF networks may have a significant impact on signaling networks that regulate responses to changes in the cellular environment. Specifically, the assembly state of IFs is important in the determination and maintenance of cell shape, transmission of mechanical stress, and targeting of molecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm (19Ku N.O. Zhou X. Toivola D.M. Omary M.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: G1108-G1137PubMed Google Scholar, 20Chang L. Goldman R.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 601-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Traditionally, the IF network has been viewed as a static architecture, based on the low solubility and detergent extractability of IF proteins. Several reports have now demonstrated that IFs are highly dynamic cellular structures as reflected by their assembly/disassembly states throughout the cell cycle (4Yoon K.H. Yoon M. Moir R.D. Khuon S. Flitney F.W. Goldman R.D. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 503-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 21Toivola D.M. Goldman R.D. Garrod D.R. Eriksson J.E. J.

While details regarding the mechanisms regulating the assembly dynamics of keratin IFs are not known, there are a number of reports that demonstrate the significance of phosphorylation and ubiquitination in regulating the assembly dynamics of keratin IFs (4Yoon K.H. Yoon M. Moir R.D. Khuon S. Flitney F.W. Goldman R.D. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 503-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 21Toivola D.M. Goldman R.D. Garrod D.R. Eriksson J.E. J.

Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 1051-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Our studies demonstrate that shear stress effects the assembly state of the keratin IF network (Figs. 2 and 4). As shown in Fig. 2, A549 cells exposed to shear stress for as little as 8 h had an increase in keratin protein levels in the soluble fraction, indicating that shear stress promotes the disassembly of the IF network. The rate of keratin IF network disassembly and degradation is dependent upon the degree of shear stress and duration (1Ridge K. Linz L. Flitney F. Kuczmarski E. Chou Y. Omary M. Sznajder J. Goldman R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30400-30405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 13Sivaramakrishnan S. DeGiulio J.V. Lorand L. Goldman R.D. Ridge K.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 889-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar); increased levels of shear stress accelerate the rate of disassembly and degradation of keratin proteins (Fig. 1A). Further, it appears that soluble keratin protein is degraded at an accelerated rate as compared with insoluble, filamentous keratin protein (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, the TX-100 soluble fraction had a stronger keratin ubiquitin-conjugation signal, as compared with the TX-100 insoluble fraction (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that soluble keratin may be more efficiently degraded via the UPP, as compared with the insoluble, filamentous keratin protein. To eliminate the possibility that keratin proteins were not themselves ubiquitinated but were bound to an ubiquitinated protein, we lysed cells in buffer containing 1% SDS and boiled before immunoprecipitation (Fig. 5). After these strong denaturing conditions, ubiquitin-labeled protein was still found in keratin immunoprecipitates, suggesting that ubiquitin is covalently attached to keratin proteins. We also observed by immunofluorescent microscopy that the keratin IF network was co-localized with ubiquitin several hours following exposure to shear stress. Ubiquitin exhibited a filamentous staining pattern that co-localized with keratin IFs; this pattern of staining was observed in A549 cells 8–16 h after exposure to shear stress (Fig. 4, panels A–C). We also observed the formation of aggresomes or Mallory bodies in A549 cells exposed to shear stress; these are perinuclear structures that contain both keratin and ubiquitin (Fig. 4, panels D–F). In fact, a common pathological feature of many IF-related diseases is the accumulation of intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies or aggresomes (25Kopito R.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 524-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1593) Google Scholar) consisting of modified IF proteins (26Zatloukal K. French S.W. Stumptner C. Strnad P.

These perinuclear structures consist predominantly of K8 and variable amounts of K18 assembled in a nonfilamentous manner (32Hazan R. Denk H. Franke W.W. Lackinger E. Schiller D.L. Lab. Investig. 1986; 54: 543-553PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to keratin, non-keratin components such as ubiquitin have also been identified as constituents of MBs (28Lowe J. Blanchard A. Morrell K.

Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1774) Google Scholar) or inhibited, resulting in the subsequent accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins within aggresomes. In our studies, Mallory bodies/aggresomes were expressed in ∼30% of the cells exposed to shear stress. In this study, we show that UbcH5 family members and Ubc3 participate in the degradation of keratin IF proteins. Dominant negative Ubc3, UbcH5b, and -c, and to a lesser extent UbcH5a, was shown to prevent the shear stress-mediated degradation of keratin IF proteins in human A549 cells (Fig. 6). Members of the UbcH5 family are highly homologous. UbcH5b and -c are 97% identical at the amino acid level, and with a difference of only four amino acids, it is likely that UbcH5b and -c have similar biologic activities. Although UbcH5a is more diverse than UbcH5b and -c with only being 89 and 88% identical at the amino acid level, respectively (48Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8797-8801Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 49Jensen J.P. Bates P.W. Yang M. Vierstra R.D. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30408-30414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), these differences may account the differences in sensitivity in the degradation of keratin IF proteins. The various E2s associated with keratin IF protein degradation may reflect the different cellular functions associated with ubiquitin E2s. Although the precise biological role of many of the ubiquitin E2s are not well defined in mammalian cells, there is accumulating evidence that E2s have unique functions. For example, Ubc3 is required for the G1-S transition, Ubc2 is central to DNA repair, while Ubc 4/5 is required for viability in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (50Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2906) Google Scholar). These functions may depend upon the specificity for the individual E3s. The E3 associated with keratin IF protein degradation has not been identified. It has been shown that both the assembly and organization of IFs are regulated by post-translational modifications, especially phosphorylation. Phosphorylation is known to occur within the head and tail domains, which are responsible for most of the structural heterogeneity and presumed tissue specific functions of IF proteins. In the case of keratin 8, a number of in vivo phosphorylation sites have been mapped and these play essential roles in regulating filament assembly and disassembly in vivo (51Omary M.B. NO K. Tao G.Z. Toivola D.M. Liao J. Trends Biochemical Sci. 2006; 31: 383-394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that PKCδ phosphorylates K8pSer-73 and that this phosphorylation event is responsible for the disassembly of keratin IF proteins (1Ridge K. Linz L. Flitney F. Kuczmarski E. Chou Y. Omary M. Sznajder J. Goldman R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30400-30405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In this report we demonstrate that phosphorylation of K8 Ser-73 is required for the ubiquitination of keratin protein following shear stress in A549 cells. Mutation of this site, K8 S73A, prevented ubiquitin from being covalently attached to keratin protein. Taken together, these results suggest that shear stress activates a signal transduction cascade that leads to the activation of protein kinase Cδ, which phosphorylates keratin 8 at Ser-73(1). These events may signal the activation of ubiquitin by the ubiquitin activating enzyme, E1, followed by the transfer of ubiquitin to the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, E2. Specifically, the E2s involved in keratin degradation are from the UbcH5/Ubc3 families. The E2 shuttles the ubiquitin molecule to a keratin-specific ubiquitin ligase, E3, which has yet to be identified. The E3 delivers the ubiquitin to the phosphorylated keratin, which has been targeted for degradation. It is possible that additional sites on K18 may require post-translational modifications for this protein to be degraded. The polyubiquitinated keratin protein is then degraded by the 26 S proteasome. We thank Drs. Ed Kuczmarski and Alik Sitikov for thoughtful advice and careful editing of this work."
https://openalex.org/W2093355613,"Insulin induces GLUT4 translocation to the muscle cell surface. Using differential amino acid labeling and mass spectrometry, we observed insulin-dependent co-precipitation of actinin-4 (ACTN4) with GLUT4 (Foster, L. J., Rudich, A., Talior, I., Patel, N., Huang, X., Furtado, L. M., Bilan, P. J., Mann, M., and Klip, A. (2006) J. Proteome Res. 5, 64–75). ACTN4 links F-actin to membrane proteins, and actin dynamics are essential for GLUT4 translocation. We hypothesized that ACTN4 may contribute to insulin-regulated GLUT4 traffic. In L6 muscle cells insulin, but not platelet-derived growth factor, increased co-precipitation of ACTN4 with GLUT4. Small interfering RNA-mediated ACTN4 knockdown abolished the gain in surface-exposed GLUT4 elicited by insulin but not by platelet-derived growth factor, membrane depolarization, or mitochondrial uncoupling. In contrast, knockdown of α-actinin-1 (ACTN1) did not prevent GLUT4 translocation by insulin. GLUT4 colocalized with ACTN4 along the insulin-induced cortical actin mesh and ACTN4 knockdown prevented GLUT4-actin colocalization without impeding actin remodeling or Akt phosphorylation, maintaining GLUT4 in a tight perinuclear location. We propose that ACTN4 contributes to GLUT4 traffic, likely by tethering GLUT4 vesicles to the cortical actin cytoskeleton. Insulin induces GLUT4 translocation to the muscle cell surface. Using differential amino acid labeling and mass spectrometry, we observed insulin-dependent co-precipitation of actinin-4 (ACTN4) with GLUT4 (Foster, L. J., Rudich, A., Talior, I., Patel, N., Huang, X., Furtado, L. M., Bilan, P. J., Mann, M., and Klip, A. (2006) J. Proteome Res. 5, 64–75). ACTN4 links F-actin to membrane proteins, and actin dynamics are essential for GLUT4 translocation. We hypothesized that ACTN4 may contribute to insulin-regulated GLUT4 traffic. In L6 muscle cells insulin, but not platelet-derived growth factor, increased co-precipitation of ACTN4 with GLUT4. Small interfering RNA-mediated ACTN4 knockdown abolished the gain in surface-exposed GLUT4 elicited by insulin but not by platelet-derived growth factor, membrane depolarization, or mitochondrial uncoupling. In contrast, knockdown of α-actinin-1 (ACTN1) did not prevent GLUT4 translocation by insulin. GLUT4 colocalized with ACTN4 along the insulin-induced cortical actin mesh and ACTN4 knockdown prevented GLUT4-actin colocalization without impeding actin remodeling or Akt phosphorylation, maintaining GLUT4 in a tight perinuclear location. We propose that ACTN4 contributes to GLUT4 traffic, likely by tethering GLUT4 vesicles to the cortical actin cytoskeleton.

In response to insulin there is a rapid increase in the steady-state level of GLUT4 at the cell surface, at the expense of intracellular pools (6Bryant N.J. Govers R. James D.E. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Moreover, although insulin-dependent GLUT4 translocation requires dynamic remodeling of filamentous actin (20Tong P. Khayat Z.A. Huang C. Patel N. Ueyama A. Klip A. J. Clin.

Govers R. James D.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 1067-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 28Gonzalez E. McGraw T.E. Mol. Biol.

Cell Metab. 2005; 2: 179-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Hypothesizing that GLUT4 traffic may be regulated by interaction with partner proteins, it is of fundamental and clinical interest to identify such proteins. Accordingly, we recently applied the novel SILAC (stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture) approach (32Ong S.E. Mann M. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 2650-2660Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar) to search for proteins that associate with GLUT4 in an insulin-regulated manner (1Foster L.J. Rudich A. Talior I. Patel N. Huang X. Furtado L.M. Bilan P.J. Mann M. Klip A. J. Proteome Res. 2006; 5: 64-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The study took advantage of the stable expression in L6 muscle cells of GLUT4 encoding an myc tag that faces the extracellular or luminal spaces. Immunoprecipitation via the myc epitope avoided interference of the antibody with endogenous partners of GLUT4. Through this strategy we identified a discrete cohort of proteins that were more abundant in immunoprecipitates from insulin-stimulated than control cells (1Foster L.J. Rudich A. Talior I. Patel N. Huang X. Furtado L.M. Bilan P.J. Mann M. Klip A. J. Proteome Res. 2006; 5: 64-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). One of the most responsive proteins was α-actinin-4 (ACTN4). ACTN4 is an ≅100-kDa protein containing four spectrin-like repeats and a globular N-terminal actin binding domain that forms an anti-parallel homodimer and can cross-link actin filaments or link membrane proteins to F-actin (33Djinovic-Carugo K. Young P. Gautel M. Saraste M. Cell. 1999; 98: 537-546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar).Here we hypothesize that ACTN4 might contribute to GLUT4 translocation toward the cell surface, providing a functional link between the transporter and actin filaments. This postulate was tested using the L6 muscle cells stably expressing GLUT4myc, which exhibits GLUT4 cycling and regulation by insulin, PDGF, membrane depolarization, and mitochondrial uncouplers (18Wijesekara N. Tung A. Thong F. Klip A. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2006; 290: 1276-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 25Torok D. Patel N. Jebailey L. Thong F.S. Randhawa V.K. Klip A. Rudich A.

We applied siRNA-mediated ACTN4 knockdown coupled to GLUT4myc immunolocalization by confocal fluorescence microscopy, quantification of surface exposure of the myc epitope and glucose uptake measurements, and conclude that ACTN4 is required to gather GLUT4 beneath the cell membrane exclusively in response to insulin.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents, Constructs, and siRNAs—o-Phenylenediamine dihydrochloride, monoclonal anti-ACTN1 (mouse IgM, clone BM-75.2 (37Honda K.

Enhanced green fluorescent protein-tagged C-terminal K-Ras tail (K-Ras tail-GFP) cDNA, as in Yeung et al. (40Yeung T. Terebiznik M. Yu L. Silvius J. Abidi W.M. Philips M. Levine T. Kapus A. Grinstein S. Science. 2006; 313: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), was a kind gift of Dr. Sergio Grinstein (Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto). All cDNA constructs were prepared by Qiagen Hi-Speed Maxi-prep kits according to the manufacturer's protocol.Cell Culture and Transfections—L6 rat myoblasts stably expressing GLUT4 with an exofacial myc epitope (L6-GLUT4myc) and L6 wild-type myoblasts were differentiated into myotubes as described (34Kanai F. Nishioka Y. Hayashi H. Kamohara S. Todaka M. Ebina Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14523-14526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Ueyama A. Yaworsky K.L. Wang Q. Ebina Y. Klip A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: E572-E578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Post-seeding day-2 myoblasts or day-4 myotubes were non-transfected (NT) or transfected with 100 nm siACTN4, siACTN1, or siNR using calcium phosphate (CellPhect Transfection kit; GE Healthcare). siRNA-calcium phosphate precipitates were removed 12 h after addition, and cells were maintained for 72 h until experimentation. siACTN4 and siACTN1 were each effective against their targets (see “Results”). K-Ras tail-GFP or ACTN4-GFP cDNAs were, respectively, transfected by calcium phosphate as above or Lipofectamine 2000® (Invitrogen).Cell Lysates and Immunoblotting—Cells were lysed as described (41Niu W. Huang C. Nawaz Z. Levy M. Somwar R. Li D. Bilan P.J. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17953-17962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and equal protein samples were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad), and immunoblotted with anti-ACTN4 or anti-ACTN1 (1:2000), anti-β-actin (1:5000), anti-phospho-Ser473 Akt, phospho-Thr308 Akt, anti-phosphoextracellular signal-regulated kinase (1:1000), or anti-myc (1:1000) antibodies. Horseradish peroxidase-bound secondary antibodies were detected by Western Lightning™ chemiluminescence reagent plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).GLUT4myc Immunoprecipitation—L6-GLUT4myc myoblasts seeded in 10-cm dishes and grown to confluence or differentiated into myotubes were serum-deprived for 4 h before stimulation with 100 nm insulin for 20 min, 50 ng/ml PDGF for 7 min, or 25 μm LY249002 for 20 min at 37 °C. Lysates (1.5 mg) were immunoprecipitated with 40 μl of 9E10 Monoclonal Affinity Matrix as described (1Foster L.J. Rudich A. Talior I. Patel N. Huang X. Furtado L.M. Bilan P.J. Mann M. Klip A. J. Proteome Res. 2006; 5: 64-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).GST Pulldown Assay—Fragments corresponding to the GLUT4 N′-terminal tail (amino acids 1–24), large central loop (amino acids 222–287), and C′-terminal tail (476–509) were fused together and ligated into the EcoRI and XhoR sites of pGEX-2T vector (Amersham Biosciences) and called cytoGLUT4-GST. The sequence coding for human ACTN4 was cut from the ACTN4-GFP construct and introduced into the Nde1 and Nhe1 sites of vector pET-27b (+) (here called ACTN4-His). The fusion proteins and GST were expressed in DH5α cells after induction with 0.3 mm isopropylthiogalactopyranoside and purified on glutathione-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) or nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen), respectively. Purified GST was used as negative control. Myoblasts were lysed in PBS with 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors. Freshly prepared cytoGLUT4-GST and GST bound to beads were mixed with 1 mg of cell lysate or ACTN4-His, incubated overnight at 4 °C, harvested by centrifugation, and washed in PBS buffer containing Triton X-100. Bound proteins were eluted in sample buffer and visualized by immunoblotting.Glucose Uptake and Cell-surface GLUT4myc Detection—Cells grown in 24-well plates and serum-starved for 3–5 h were treated without or with 100 nm insulin for 20 min, and 2-deoxyglucose uptake was measured as described (5Rudich A. Konrad D. Torok D. Ben-Romano R. Huang C. Niu W. Garg R.R. Wijesekara N. Germinario R.J. Bilan P.J. Klip A. Diabetologia. 2003; 46: 649-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) using 10 μm [2-deoxy-3H]glucose. Cell-surface GLUT4myc was detected as described (35Ueyama A. Yaworsky K.L. Wang Q. Ebina Y. Klip A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: E572-E578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Wang Q. Khayat Z. Kishi K. Ebina Y. Klip A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Briefly, serum-deprived cells left untreated or treated for 7 min with 50 ng/ml PDGF or for 20 min with 100 nm insulin, 0.5 mm DNP, or 120 mm K+ at 37 °C as in Wijesekara et al. (18Wijesekara N. Tung A. Thong F. Klip A. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2006; 290: 1276-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and Torok et al. (25Torok D. Patel N. Jebailey L. Thong F.S. Randhawa V.K. Klip A. Rudich A. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5447-5455Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, blocked 10 min with 3% (v/v) goat serum, and reacted with polyclonal anti-myc antibody (1:200) for 1 h at 4 °C. Cells were fixed for 10 min with 3% paraformaldehyde, reacted with horseradish peroxidase-bound goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:2000) for 1 h at 4 °C, washed 6 times with PBS, and incubated with 1 ml o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride reagent and allowed to develop for 20–30 min in the linear range in the dark at room temperature. The reaction was stopped with 1 ml/well of 3 n HCl. Supernatants were collected and absorbance was measured at 492 nm. Background absorbance obtained in the absence of anti-myc antibody was subtracted from all values.Immunofluorescence Microscopy, Image Acquisition, and Analyses—After insulin treatment, cells were fixed and permeabilized in 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 3 min at 4 °C to preserve actin morphology. Labeling of actin filaments with rhodaminebound phalloidin and antigen-specific immunostaining was as noted (43Khayat Z.A. Tong P. Yaworsky K. Bloch R.J. Klip A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 279-290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), using monoclonal anti-myc 1:100 and polyclonal anti-ACTN4 1:200 in 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS, together with fluorophore-coupled secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. To prevent artifactual co-localization, fluorophores of maximal spectral separation were used. To reduce possible fluorophore spectra crossover, cells were imaged by multichannel scanning with a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). Acquisition parameters were adjusted to exclude saturation of the signal.For rounded-up L6-GLUT4myc myoblasts, cells detached from the substratum with Ca2+- and Mg2+-free PBS at 37 °C were left untreated or treated with 100 nm insulin for 20 min at 37 °C on re-attachment to glass coverslips as noted. Fixed cells were processed intact for myc epitope detection or permeabilized for staining of the myc epitope, ACTN4 or actin, as above. Images were obtained with a Zeiss Axiovert 100M laser scanning confocal microscope at room temperature using a 60× or 100× oil objective at the same gain setting unless indicated otherwise. The gain detector was set using cells labeled with only secondary antibody. Rounded-up myoblasts with peripheral GLUT4myc signal (>50 cells per condition) were scored “blindly,” and the number of positive cells expressed as a percentage of cells counted.125I-Labeled Transferrin Recycling—Transferrin recycling was examined as noted (44Yan Q. Sun W. Kujala P. Lotfi Y. Vida T.A. Bean A.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2470-2482Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Cells were loaded with 125I-labeled transferrin (1 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C and washed once each with cold medium, acidic solution (0.15 m NaCl, 0.1 m glycine, pH 3.0) and again with medium. Cells were incubated with growth medium for 2, 4, 8, or 12 min at 37 °C, and media were collected for each time point. Cells were scraped into 1 m NaOH, and protein in the media was precipitated with 20% trichloroacetic acid. Radioactivity content in the cell extract (with internalized transferrin) or media pellet (with externalized transferrin) was counted. For each time point collected in triplicate, recycled 125I-labeled transferrin was calculated as the ratio of externalized versus internalized 125I-labeled transferrin. Data were corrected for nonspecific cell-associated 125I-labeled transferrin, determined from parallel cell cultures incubated with 20 μg/ml unlabeled transferrin during loading.Statistical Analysis—Results are shown as -fold values relative to the indicated control conditions in each figure. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test; p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.RESULTSInsulin Specifically Enhances ACTN4 Interaction with GLUT4—Recently we reported an interaction between ACTN4 and GLUT4 in a yeast two-hybrid screen of a 3T3-L1 adipocyte cDNA library using a hybrid protein encoding only the cytosolic regions of GLUT4 (1Foster L.J. Rudich A. Talior I. Patel N. Huang X. Furtado L.M. Bilan P.J. Mann M. Klip A. J. Proteome Res. 2006; 5: 64-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). ACNT4 is also expressed in skeletal muscle tissue, confirmed by immunoblot analysis of oxidative (soleus) and glycolytic (extensor digitorum longus) mouse muscles (data not shown). To further understand the functional significance of the interaction between ACTN4 and GLUT4, we first explored the specificity of insulin action on this association. In L6-GLUT4myc myotubes, ACTN4 was notably detectable in GLUT4myc immunoprecipitates in response to insulin in comparison with the basal state (Fig. 1A, top), relative to total amounts of GLUT4myc immunoprecipitated in each condition. Neither GLUT4myc nor ACTN4 was immunoprecipitated by anti-myc antibody from L6 wild-type cell lysates devoid of GLUT4myc (Fig. 1A, bottom).Like insulin, acute stimulation with PDGF also promotes GLUT4myc externalization and glucose transport in L6 myoblasts (25Torok D. Patel N. Jebailey L. Thong F.S. Randhawa V.K. Klip A. Rudich A. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5447-5455Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, this response is insensitive to actin disruption by latrunculin B or to VAMP2 inactivation by tetanus toxin, hallmarks of insulin action (25Torok D. Patel N. Jebailey L. Thong F.S. Randhawa V.K. Klip A. Rudich A. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5447-5455Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 45Thong F.S. Bilan P.J. Klip A. Diabetes. 2007; 56: 414-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Therefore, we explored whether PDGF would affect the GLUT4-ACTN4 interaction. Interestingly, PDGF did not increase the binding of ACTN4 to GLUT4myc (Fig. 1B), highlighting the specificity of insulin on this association. These experiments were tested in myoblasts, as the PDGF receptor is only expressed at this stage of the myogenic process.Because PI3K is required for insulin-mediated recruitment of GLUT4 (46Thong F.S. Dugani C.B. Klip A. Physiology (Bethesda). 2005; 20: 271-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), the interaction of GLUT4myc with ACTN4 was examined in the presence of the PI3K inhibitor LY294002. L6GLUT4myc myoblasts were pretreated with LY294002 for 20 min before and during insulin stimulation. This treatment prevented the insulin-stimulated association of GLUT4myc with ACTN4 (Fig. 1C), offering additional support for the specificity of this interaction in response to insulin.To verify that ACTN4 and GLUT4myc directly interact, as predicted from the two-hybrid analysis, we conducted pull-down assays of ACTN4 via cytoGLUT4-GST using cell extracts and pure recombinant proteins. As shown in Fig. 1D, cytoGLUT4-GST effectively pulled down endogenous ACTN4 from cell lysates and purified, recombinant ACTN4-His. In contrast, GST alone did not pull down ACTN4 in either assay.ACTN4 Knockdown Reduces Insulin-stimulated Glucose Transport and Surface GLUT4 Gain—To assess the functional relevance of ACTN4 to GLUT4 traffic, we explored the effects of silencing ACTN4 expression using a specific small interfering RNA oligonucleotide (siACTN4). Significant knockdown (60 ± 2%) of ACTN4 protein was achieved in siACTN4 (Fig. 2A) relative to NT or non-related control siRNA (siNR)-treated cells. In contrast, expression of GLUT4myc or the ACTN1 isoform was unaltered. ACTN4 knockdown significantly inhibited insulin-stimulated 2-deoxyglucose uptake (1.6 ± 0.2-fold) compared with the response to the hormone in NT (2.65 ± 0.12-fold) or siNR (2.6 ± 0.04-fold) cells. In contrast, ACTN4 knockdown did not affect hexose uptake in the unstimulated state (Fig. 2B). Importantly, siACTN4 did not perturb insulin signaling at the level of Akt phosphorylation on Ser-473 (Fig. 2C) or Thr-308 (data not shown).FIGURE 2ACTN4 knockdown reduces insulin-stimulated glucose transport. A–C, L6-GLUT4myc myotubes were either NT or transfected with 100 nm siNR or siACTN4. B and C, serum-starved cells were treated without or with 100 nm insulin for 20 min. B, 2-deoxyglucose uptake was measured at room temperature for 5 min. Shown are the means ± S.E. relative to basal NT cells from four independent experiments; *, p ≤ 0.05. A and C, lysates resolved by SDS-PAGE were immunoblotted with anti-ACTN4 or anti-ACTN1 (both ∼100 kDa), anti-myc (50 kDa) or anti-β-actin (45 kDa), and anti-Akt (65 kDa) or anti-phospho (p)-Akt (serine 473, 65 kDa) antibodies.

These results suggest that the residual glucose uptake response observed in siACTN4-treated cells is likely ascribed to GLUT1. In contrast to insulin, ACTN4 knockdown had no inhibitory effect on the gain in surface GLUT4myc elicited by PDGF, K+-mediated depolarization, or DNP-mediated mitochondrial uncoupling (Figs. 3, A and B).FIGURE 3Insulin, but not PDGF, K+ depolarization or DNP-stimulated GLUT4 translocation is reduced by ACTN4 knockdown. L6-GLUT4myc myotubes were either NT or transfected with 100 nm siNR or siACTN4. Serum-depleted cells were treated without or with 100 nm insulin for 20 min and with 50 ng/ml PDGF for 7 min, and 120 mm K+ or 0.5 mm DNP for 20 min at 37 °C, and surface myc-tagged GLUT4 density was quantified using the antibody-coupled colorimetric assay.

Moreover, siRNA-mediated knockdown of ACTN1 (by 70%) was innocuous to basal or insulin-stimulated levels of surface GLUT4myc (Fig. 4, B and C) without affecting ACTN4 levels.

Mechanisms to ensure that metazoan origins initiate once per cell cycle include degradation of Cdt1 during S phase and inhibition of Cdt1 by the geminin protein. Geminin depletion or overexpression of Cdt1 or Cdc6 in human cells causes rereplication, a form of endogenous DNA damage. Rereplication induced by these manipulations is however uneven and incomplete, suggesting that one or more mechanisms restrain rereplication once it begins. We find that both Cdt1 and Cdc6 are degraded in geminin-depleted cells. We further show that Cdt1 degradation in cells that have rereplicated requires the PCNA binding site of Cdt1 and the Cul4DDB1 ubiquitin ligase, and Cdt1 can induce its own degradation when overproduced. Cdc6 degradation in geminin-depleted cells requires Huwe1, the ubiquitin ligase that regulates Cdc6 after DNA damage. Moreover, perturbations that specifically disrupt Cdt1 and Cdc6 degradation in response to DNA damage exacerbate rereplication when combined with geminin depletion, and this enhanced rereplication occurs in both human cells and in Drosophila melanogaster cells. We conclude that rereplication-associated DNA damage triggers Cdt1 and Cdc6 ubiquitination and destruction, and propose that this pathway represents an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that minimizes the extent of rereplication.

One of the critical events in the cell division cycle is complete and precise duplication of the genome. In eukaryotic cells, origins of DNA replication acquire replication competence through the assembly of a prereplication complex (preRC) 3The abbreviations used are: preRCprereplication complexORCorigin recognition complexMCMminichromosome maintenance complexm.o.i.multiplicity of infectionPIPPCNA-interacting proteinHAhemagglutininDAPI4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindoleWTwild type. 3The abbreviations used are: preRCprereplication complexORCorigin recognition complexMCMminichromosome maintenance complexm.o.i.multiplicity of infectionPIPPCNA-interacting proteinHAhemagglutininDAPI4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindoleWTwild type. in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. PreRCs are assembled by the sequential origin binding of the origin recognition complex (ORC), Cdc6, Cdt1, and the minichromosome maintenance complex (MCM). Origins harboring preRCs are licensed for replication but do not initiate DNA synthesis until S phase begins and the Cdc7 and Cdk2 kinases are activated (1Sclafani R.A. Holzen T.M. Annu. Rev.

The large genomes of metazoan cells necessitate the utilization of thousands of origins, but each origin that initiates DNA synthesis must do so only once. Failure to maintain this control has been linked to genome instability and oncogenesis (4Arentson E. Faloon P. Seo J. Moon E. Studts J.M. Fremont D.H. Choi K.

Among the most important of these mechanisms are degradation of Cdt1 during S phase and inhibition of Cdt1 by the geminin protein. Geminin depletion, overexpression of Cdt1, or overexpression of Cdc6 causes rereplication, which ultimately triggers a DNA damage response (6Fujita M.

Moreover, the effects of rereplication on the Cdc6 protein have not yet been explored. We hypothesized that DNA damage caused by rereplication is responsible for the observed Cdt1 degradation, and that a similar effect should result in degradation of Cdc6. In this study we provide evidence that rereplication-induced degradation of both Cdt1 and Cdc6 requires the same ubiquitin ligases that regulate Cdt1 and Cdc6 in response to exogenous DNA-damaging agents. Moreover, Cdt1 overexpression stimulates its own degradation by inducing rereplication-associated DNA damage. We further demonstrate that disrupting the degradation of either Cdt1 or Cdc6 combined with geminin depletion exacerbates rereplication. This study provides evidence for an evolutionarily conserved mechanism, which destroys essential replication licensing factors once rereplication begins as an important means to minimize the extent of rereplication.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGrowth and Manipulation of Cells—HCT116 cells were cultured in McCoy's 5A medium (Cellgro, Mediatech) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), and 2 mm glutamine (Invitrogen).

To explore the mechanisms that restrain rereplication in these cells, we first manipulated the expression of both geminin and Cdt1 in HCT116 colon carcinoma cells and analyzed the cells by flow cytometry to determine DNA content. Depletion of geminin by siRNA transfection for 48 h resulted in a population of cells with a heterogeneous DNA content greater than 4C, which we defined as cells that had undergone rereplication (Fig. 1A, left histograms). Rereplication can also be induced by overproduction of Cdt1 to levels that overwhelm the ability of geminin to inhibit Cdt1 activity (10Vaziri C. Saxena S. Jeon Y. Lee C. Murata K. Machida Y. Wagle N. Hwang D.S. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 997-1008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Infecting cells with a recombinant adenovirus that directs moderate overexpression of an N-terminally HA-tagged Cdt1 induced rereplication after 24 h, although not as extensively as geminin siRNA transfection (Fig. 1A, top right histogram). Combining Cdt1 expression with geminin depletion induced more extensive rereplication than either single treatment, as determined by the number of cells with DNA content greater than 4C (Fig. 1A, bottom right histogram). Thus, geminin depletion and Cdt1 expression cooperate to induce rereplication.Recent evidence suggests that the forks derived from refiring origins collapse to generate double-strand breaks that can trigger activation of the DNA damage checkpoint (24Archambault V. Ikui A.E. Drapkin B.J. Cross F.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6707-6721Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 25Davidson I.F. Li A. Blow J.J. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 433-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). As had been observed by others (12Melixetian M. Ballabeni A. Masiero L. Gasparini P. Zamponi R. Bartek J. Lukas J. Helin K. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 13Zhu W. Chen Y. Dutta A. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 2002; 13: 3662-3671Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), geminin-depleted cells acquired molecular markers associated with DNA damage, including phosphorylation of both p53 and Chk2 (Fig. 1B compare lanes 1 and 3). Cdt1 overproduction also resulted in p53 phosphorylation (Fig. 1B, lane 2). Seemingly paradoxically and similar to previous observations (14Mihaylov I.S. Kondo T. Jones L. Ryzhikov S. Tanaka J. Zheng J. Higa L.A. Minamino N. Cooley L. Zhang H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1868-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 18Ballabeni A. Melixetian M. Zamponi R. Masiero L. Marinoni F. Helin K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3122-3132Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), endogenous Cdt1 levels were quite low in geminin-depleted cells despite the fact that Cdt1 is required for replication (Fig. 1B top, compare lanes 1 and 3).Cdt1 is most abundant in G1 cells, and geminin depletion results in fewer G1 cells (Fig. 1A). To determine if the down-regulation of Cdt1 in geminin-depleted cells could be explained simply by this cell cycle effect, we treated cells with nocodazole after siRNA transfection to arrest them in G2/prometaphase. Geminin-depleted G2/M cells rereplicated as before (Fig. 1C), but also had dramatically less Cdt1 than control G2/M cells (Fig. 1D). A similar observation was made in G2-arrested cells by Ballabeni et al. (18Ballabeni A. Melixetian M. Zamponi R. Masiero L. Marinoni F. Helin K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3122-3132Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and the loss of Cdt1 was attributed to ubiquitin-mediated degradation. Geminin binding to Cdt1 may physically block interaction with a Cdt1 ubiquitin ligase, or geminin may regulate Cdt1 stability by some replication-independent mechanism. An alternative possibility we considered is that the DNA damage induced by rereplication results in Cdt1 degradation.Surprisingly, the ectopically expressed N-terminally tagged HA-Cdt1 protein was largely resistant to degradation in geminin-depleted cells, whereas the endogenous Cdt1 was readily degraded (Fig. 1B compare lanes 2 and 4). Persistence of HA-Cdt1 may have contributed to the increased rereplication we observed when HA-Cdt1 was expressed in geminin-depleted cells (Fig. 1A). The resistance of N-terminally tagged Cdt1 to degradation in geminin-depleted cells suggested that the Cdt1 N terminus is important for regulating Cdt1 stability in rereplicating cells. In S phase, Cdt1 ubiquitination and destruction is mediated by two ubiquitin ligase complexes, Cul1Skp2 and Cul4DDB1 (27Nishitani H. Sugimoto N. Roukos V. Nakanishi Y. Saijo M. Obuse C. Tsurimoto T. Nakayama K.I. Nakayama K. Fujita M. Lygerou Z. Nishimoto T. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1126-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Cul4DDB1 is also responsible for Cdt1 ubiquitination in response to DNA damage (28Hu J. McCall C.M. Ohta T. Xiong Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1003-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 29Higa L.A. Mihaylov I.S. Banks D.P. Zheng J. Zhang H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 1008-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Cul1Skp2-mediated ubiquitination requires phosphorylation of human Cdt1 on T29, whereas DNA damage-induced ubiquitination of Cdt1 requires Cdt1 binding to PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen), which also binds close to the Cdt1 N terminus (27Nishitani H. Sugimoto N. Roukos V. Nakanishi Y. Saijo M. Obuse C. Tsurimoto T. Nakayama K.I. Nakayama K. Fujita M. Lygerou Z. Nishimoto T. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1126-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 30Senga T. Sivaprasad U. Zhu W. Park J.H. Arias E.E. Walter J.C. Dutta A. J. Biol.

We hypothesized that N-terminally tagged Cdt1 was resistant to degradation in geminin-depleted cells because one or both of these two ubiquitin ligases could not access Cdt1. To determine which mode of Cdt1 degradation was blocked by the HA tag, we monitored the stability of HA-Cdt1 as cells progressed through the cycle or in response to DNA damage. Upon entry into S phase the HA-Cdt1 protein was degraded at the same cell cycle point as endogenous Cdt1 (Fig. 1E). The fact that HA-Cdt1 is sensitive to cell cycle-dependent degradation but not degradation in geminin-depleted cells (Fig. 1B) further demonstrates that the Cdt1 degradation in geminin-depleted cells is not due to a passive cell cycle effect. Unlike endogenous Cdt1, HA-Cdt1 was not degraded in response to ultraviolet (UV) irradiation (Fig. 1F); a similar observation had been made with N-terminally Myc-tagged Cdt1 in UV-treated cells (30Senga T. Sivaprasad U. Zhu W. Park J.H. Arias E.E. Walter J.C. Dutta A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6246-6252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the degradation of Cdt1 in geminin-depleted cells is accomplished by a mechanism similar to Cdt1 degradation in response to DNA damage.Drosophila Cdt1Dup Is Degraded in Geminin-depleted Cells through a Cul4-dependent Mechanism—To determine if loss of Cdt1 in response to rereplication is conserved in other species we examined the effects of geminin depletion in Drosophila-melanogaster cells. Transfection of cultured Drosophila S2 cells with dsRNA targeting geminin for 96 h resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of cells with greater than 4C DNA content. In this experiment, DNA content per cell was assessed by a novel microscopy-based method to measure DAPI-staining intensity using an IC100 Image Cytometer (Fig. 2A). Geminin depletion resulted in the degradation of the Cdt1 ortholog double-parked (Cdt1Dup) as first reported by Mihaylov et al. (Fig. 2B, lane 3) (14Mihaylov I.S. Kondo T. Jones L. Ryzhikov S. Tanaka J. Zheng J. Higa L.A. Minamino N. Cooley L. Zhang H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1868-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). To determine which ubiquitin ligase mediates Cdt1Dup degradation, we co-transfected dsRNA targeting either Cul1 or Cul4 with the geminin dsRNA. When S2 cells were depleted of Cul4 and geminin, Cdt1Dup was partially stabilized compared with geminin depletion alone (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 3 and 6). The inability of Cul4 depletion to completely rescue Cdt1Dup levels may have been due to the reported down-regulation of Cdt1Dup mRNA in geminin-depleted S2 cells (14Mihaylov I.S. Kondo T. Jones L. Ryzhikov S. Tanaka J. Zheng J. Higa L.A. Minamino N. Cooley L. Zhang H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1868-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Depletion of Cul1 had little effect on Cdt1Dup levels in geminin-depleted cells (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 3 and 5). Triple depletion of geminin, Cul1, and Cul4 resulted in Cdt1Dup levels close to the levels in geminin and Cul4-depleted cells (Fig. 2B, lane 7), indicating that Cul4 is more important than Cul1 for regulating Cdt1Dup under these conditions. Interestingly, the small amount of Cdt1Dup that accumulated in the Cul1-depleted cells had a slower mobility than the Cdt1Dup in Cul4-depleted cells, suggesting that Cdt1Dup may have been differentially modified, perhaps by phosphorylation (43Thomer M. May N.R. Aggarwal B.D. Kwok G. Calvi B.R. Development. 2004; 131: 4807-4818Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar).FIGURE 2Geminin depletion in Drosophila S2 cells induces Cul4-dependent Cdt1Dup degradation. A, S2 cells were treated with dsRNA targeting control sequence or geminin for 4 days. DNA content was determined by integrated fluorescence intensity of DAPI-stained nuclei. B, S2 cells were transfected with the indicated dsRNA for 96 h then evaluated for Cdt1Dup, Cul4, Cul1, and tubulin by immunoblotting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The Rereplication-associated Degradation of Human Cdt1 Requires the PCNA Binding Site and Cul4DDB1—To determine if Cul4 is similarly required for degradation of human Cdt1 in rereplicating cells, we co-transfected HCT116 cells with siRNA targeting both geminin and the Cul4 adaptor DDB1. As in Drosophila cells depleted of Cul4, depletion of DDB1 prevented the Cdt1 degradation induced by geminin depletion (Fig. 3A, compare lanes 1 and 2 with lanes 3 and 4). Because Cul4DDB1 is required for Cdt1 degradation both after DNA damage and after geminin depletion, and because rereplication induces DNA damage, we tested other aspects of DNA damage-induced Cdt1 degradation for similar involvement in Cdt1 degradation in geminin-depleted cells. DNA damage-induced degradation of Cdt1 requires an association between the Cdt1 PIP (PCNA-interacting protein) motif and PCNA. We therefore asked whether this association is also required for Cdt1 degradation in geminin-depleted cells. Conserved PIP motif residues at positions 3, 6, and 9 were altered to alanines (PIPm-Cdt1, Fig. 3B); similar mutations are sufficient to disrupt PCNA binding and inhibit Cdt1 degradation after UV damage (30Senga T.

A V5 epitope tag (or alternatively an RFP tag) was then inserted at the C terminus of both normal and PIPm-Cdt1. This mutation did not block the ability of Cdt1 to induce rereplication (Fig. 3C). A similar PIPm-Cdt1 (31Arias E.E. Walter J.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) and even truncation of the first 242 Cdt1 residues (32Ferenbach A. Li A.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) complemented Cdt1-depleted Xenopus laevis extracts for MCM loading and DNA replication, indicating that PIPm-Cdt1 retains both replication and rereplication-inducing functions.FIGURE 3Rereplication-induced human Cdt1 degradation requires DDB1 and the PIP motif of Cdt1. A, HCT116 cells were transfected with DDB1 siRNA for 72 h and geminin siRNA for 48 h as indicated. Proteins in whole cell lysates were detected by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. B, schematic diagram of full-length Cdt1 and derivatives used in this study. C, HCT116 cells were infected with adenovirus expressing PIPm Cdt1-V5 or control virus at an m.o.i of 150. 48 h after infection, cells were harvested and probed for ectopic Cdt1 with anti-V5 antibody or for rereplication by flow cytometry. D, HCT116 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding C-terminally RFP-tagged Cdt1, Cdt1-RFP PIPm or control vectors. 24 h after transfection, cells were irradiated as in 1F and collected 30-min post-irradiation. Endogenous and Cdt1-RFP were detected by immunoblotting with anti-Cdt1 antibody. E, HCT116 cells were infected with adenovirus expressing WT Cdt1-V5 or PIPm Cdt1-V5 at an m.o.i. of 40 4 h prior to transfection with siRNA targeting geminin or control sequence. Cells were collected 32 h after transfection and assayed by immunoblotting with anti-V5, geminin, and tubulin antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To verify that the PIPm mutation blocks Cdt1 degradation in UV-treated cells, we expressed normal Cdt1 and PIPm-Cdt1 in HCT116 cells then treated with UV. As expected, wild-type Cdt1 is readily degraded after UV treatment, but PIPm-Cdt1 is not (Fig. 3D, compare lanes 3 and 4 with lanes 5 and 6). To test if the PIP motif is required for Cdt1 degradation in geminin-depleted cells, WT Cdt1-V5 or PIPm-Cdt1-V5 were expressed from recombinant adenoviruses in HCT116 cells that had also been transfected with control or geminin siRNA. Similar to Cdt1 degradation in UV-treated cells, the PCNA binding site was required for Cdt1 degradation in cells that had been induced to rereplicate by geminin depletion (Fig. 3E, compare lanes 3 and 4 to lanes 5 and 6).The results described above are consistent with the model in which rereplication generates DNA damage which then stimulates the PCNA- and Cul4DDB1-dependent ubiquitination and degradation of Cdt1. An alternative model is that geminin protects Cdt1 from Cul4DDB1 binding through direct competition, and in the absence of geminin Cdt1 is more accessible to Cul4DDB1. To distinguish between degradation of Cdt1 as a result of rereplication per se and degradation as a consequence of competition between geminin and Cul4 for Cdt1 binding, we designed an experiment in which rereplication was induced by overproduction of the N-terminally tagged HA-Cdt1 protein instead of geminin siRNA transfection (as in Fig. 1), and Cdt1 degradation was monitored by expression of low levels of the C-terminally tagged Cdt1-V5. With increasing amounts of HA-Cdt1, WT Cdt1-V5 was degraded (Fig. 4A, lanes 2–4), whereas PIPm-Cdt1-V5 was stable (Fig. 4A, lanes 7–9). To distinguish whether the excess HA-Cdt1 induced Cdt1-V5 degradation by inducing rereplication or by sequestering geminin from Cdt1-V5, we overproduced a form of HA-Cdt1 truncated after amino acid 321 (ΔC-HA-Cdt1, Fig. 3B).

TGFβ is a ubiquitous and potent growth-inhibitory cytokine in various cell types as, for example, keratinocytes and other epithelial cells, and acts through binding to a transmembrane receptor, which in turn phosphorylates SMAD2 and SMAD3 proteins. These activated SMADs then translocate to the nucleus with binding partner SMAD4, and this complex regulates a wide range of target genes, among which are both pro- and antiproliferative genes (3Siegel P.M. Massague J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 807-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar, 4Feng X.H. Derynck R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 659-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (1528) Google Scholar). The cytostatic effect is mediated by the induction of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21CIP1 and p15INK4b and is dependent on retinoblastoma (pRb) function (1Massague J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1650) Google Scholar, 5Laiho M. DeCaprio J.A. Ludlow J.W. Livingston D.M. Massague J.

This way growth factor-dependent cyclin-dependent kinase activity is inhibited, and progression through the cell cycle is prevented. In addition, TGFβ induces genes implicated in invasion and cell motility, which includes secreted extracellular matrix-associated proteins as plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and multiple matrix metalloproteases (3Siegel P.M.

The pleiotropic actions of TGFβ have important consequences in cancer. Abortion of the cytostatic response may provide cancer cells with a selective advantage including invasive behavior (10Bierie B. Moses H.L. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2006; 17: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Noticeably, resistance to the growth inhibitory activity of TGFβ is often found in cancer, for example by mutations that inactivate the TGFβ receptors or SMAD signal transducers (3Siegel P.M. Massague J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 807-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar, 8Derynck R. Akhurst R.J. Balmain A. Nat.

In addition, selective mutation of genes required for cytostatic TGFβ responses may also occur in the presence of apparently normal TGFβ receptor and SMAD function. Identifying these factors is essential to better understand how during tumor progression cells evade the growth-limiting response to TGFβ. One of the target genes of SMAD activity that is potently induced by TGFβ in keratinocytes, fibroblasts, epithelial, and endothelial cells is PAI-1 (3Siegel P.M. Massague J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 807-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar, 12Wikner N.E. Elder J.T. Persichitte K.A. Mink P. Clark R.A. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1990; 95: 607-613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Similar to TGFβ, PAI-1 is involved in extracellular matrix homeostasis and angiogenesis and is associated with cancer progression (13Andreasen P.A. Egelund R. Petersen H.H. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 25-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar, 14Choong P.F. Nadesapillai A.P. Clin. Orthop. 2003; 415: S46-S58Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Recently we found that PAI-1 is a critical target of tumor-suppressor p53 in the induction of cellular senescence in fibroblasts (15Kortlever R.M. Higgins P.J. Bernards R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 877-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). We, therefore, asked whether PAI-1 might also be causally involved in the cytostatic activity of TGFβ. Our present results reveal an unexpected role for PAI-1 in mediating the anti-proliferative effects of TGFβ. Antibodies and Vectors—Antibodies against PAI-1 (C9), p21CIP1 (F5, C19), PKB/Akt1 (C20), PTEN (A2B1), and SMAD2 (H-2, S-20) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-phospho-PKB (Ser-473; #9271) and anti-phospho-SMAD2 (#3101L) were from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). β-Actin was from Sigma (Clone AC-74). Anti-BrdUrd antibody (M0744) was from Dako. Mouse and human cDNAs for PAI-1, urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), PI3K, and PKB/AKT have been described (15Kortlever R.M. Higgins P.J. Bernards R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 877-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Small interfering RNAs in HaCaTs or mouse fibroblasts (MEFs) were produced using the pRETRO-SUPER vector (16Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 243-247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). The 19-mer sequences for PAI-1, SMAD4, and p53 have been described (15Kortlever R.M. Higgins P.J. Bernards R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 877-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 17Deckers M. van Dinther M. Buijs J. Que I. Lowik C. van der Pluijm G. ten Dijke P. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 2202-2209Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). For generation of the human TGFβRII and PTEN knockdown constructs, the following 19-mer sequences were used: 5′-GATTCAAGAGTATTCTCAC-3′ and 5′-GTGAAGATGACAATCATGT-3′, respectively. Controls were retroviral nonfunctional short hairpin or red fluorescent protein (RFP) vectors. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Retroviral Infection—Human keratinocyte HaCaT cells, mouse embryo fibroblasts, and Phoenix cells were cultured, transfected, infected, or selected as described previously (15Kortlever R.M. Higgins P.J. Bernards R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 877-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Human TGFβ (100-B) was from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Colony Formation Assays—HaCaT cells were infected with shRNA or cDNA constructs and selected, and 20,000 cells were seeded onto 6-cm plates and stained or counted after 7 or 10 days of treatment with 200 pm TGFβ. TGFβ unresponsive and normal HaCaT cells were infected with control vector (RFP) or mouse PAI-1 cDNA and after 72 h plated under low density (20,000 cells per 6-cm plate) and 1 week later stained or counted. 10,000 or 20,000 young wild-type and post-senescent PAI-1 and p53 knockdown and knock-out and uPA-overexpressing MEFs were seeded onto 6-well plates and stained after 1 week treatment with no, 10, or 100 pm TGFβ. TGFβ was refreshed every other day. Growth Curves—HaCaT cells and MEFs were infected with retroviral shRNA constructs and selected, and 20,000 or 50,000 HaCaT cells or 150,000 MEFs were plated in a 6-cm dish (time = 0 days). Every 4 days cells were counted, and 20,000, 50,000, or 150,000 cells were replated. TGFβ was refreshed every other day. Total cell amounts were displayed as cumulative over time. Quantitative Real Time PCR—From untreated or TGFβ-treated HaCaT cells or MEFs, RNA was isolated with TRI-Zol ® (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer' instructions. Quantitative real-time PCR (QRT-PCR) was performed on an ABI Prism 7700 with Assays-on-Demand™ (Applied Biosystems) for mouse PAI-1 and TBP as a control housekeeping gene or for human PAI-1, p21CIP1, and p15INK4b with β-actin as a control housekeeping gene. Cell Cycle Analysis by Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorter—MEFs were cultured overnight in the absence or presence of 100 pm TGFβ and subsequently incubated with BrdUrd for 45 min. Cells were fixed, permeabilized, and labeled with anti-BrdUrd and propidium iodide. Cell Culture Images—Phase contrast images were obtained using a Zeiss Axiovert 25 microscope with A-Plan 10× or LD A-plan 20× objectives on a Canon Powershot G3 14× zoom camera. Western Blotting—Lysates were from scraped subconfluent plates and complemented with protease inhibitor (Complete, Roche Applied Science) and phosphatase inhibitor (P2850, Sigma) according to manufacturer's instructions. Lysis and analysis was performed as described (15Kortlever R.M. Higgins P.J. Bernards R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 877-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). In all experiments representative examples of at least three independent experiments are shown. Cytostatic TGFβ Activity in Human Keratinocytes Requires PAI-1—Human HaCaT cells are arrested in the G1 phase of the cell cycle in response to TGFβ while exhibiting strongly induced PAI-1 levels (3Siegel P.M. Massague J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 807-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar, 5Laiho M. DeCaprio J.A. Ludlow J.W. Livingston D.M. Massague J. Cell. 1990; 62: 175-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar, 12Wikner N.E. Elder J.T. Persichitte K.A. Mink P. Clark R.A. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1990; 95: 607-613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We asked whether the induction of PAI-1 might be causally involved in the TGFβ-induced proliferation arrest. TGFβ receptor type II (TGFβRII) and SMAD4 knockdown vectors were used as positive controls (3Siegel P.M. Massague J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 807-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar). We stably infected HaCaT cells with retroviral constructs expressing two independent PAI-1 shRNAs (to reduce the chance of scoring for an off-target effect), a nonfunctional shRNA (used as a negative control), or the TGFβRII or SMAD4 shRNAs. We also transduced HaCaT cells with a vector encoding a cDNA for uPA as this secreted protease and growth factor acts downstream of its antagonist PAI-1. Consequently, enhanced uPA expression may override the PAI-1 induction by TGFβ. Fig. 1a shows that colony formation of parental HaCaT cells exposed to 200 pm TGFβ was severely inhibited but that knockdown of PAI-1 by two independent shRNA vectors or expression of uPA resulted in escape from growth arrest which was at least as potent as that caused by knockdown of TGFβRII or SMAD4 (Fig. 1a, supplemental Fig. S1, a). A similar result was seen when growth curves were made of HaCaT cells having these knockdown vectors (Fig. 1b). There was no significant growth difference between the various cell lines in the absence of TGFβ (data not shown). To assess the knockdown efficiency in TGFβ-resistant cells, we determined the mRNA levels of PAI-1, TGFβRII, and SMAD4 in cells expressing the respective knockdown constructs by QRT-PCR. After stimulation with 200 pm TGFβ for 1 day, PAI-1 mRNA levels were highly induced in normal HaCaT cells, which was greatly suppressed in PAI-1kd cells. This became more exacerbated when cells were grown in TGFβ medium for 10 days (Fig. 1c). There was reduction of TGFβRII and SMAD4 in TGFβRIIkd and SMAD4kd cells, respectively, and progressive reduction over time when grown in the presence of TGFβ (Fig. 1c). Next we asked whether overexpression of a mouse cDNA for PAI-1, which is insensitive to knockdown by the human PAI-1 shRNAs (15Kortlever R.M. Higgins P.J. Bernards R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 877-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), could mimic TGFβ activity and induce a cell cycle arrest. We analyzed in a colony formation assay whether the growth of TGFβ-resistant cells expressing the various knockdown constructs was influenced by ectopic expression of murine PAI-1, as compared with infection with a RFP control. In all cases the cells were growth-arrested (Fig. 1d), and the inhibition of proliferation by PAI-1 expression was approximately comparable between the various cell lines (supplemental Fig. S1, b). We conclude that loss of PAI-1 expression results in bypass of the cytostatic activity of TGFβ and that ectopic PAI-1 expression can be sufficient for induction of a growth arrest in human keratinocytes. Cytostatic TGFβ Activity in Mouse Fibroblasts Requires PAI-1—MEFs grown under low density are also sensitive to the cytostatic effect of TGFβ, which is retinoblastoma (pRb)-dependent (6Herrera R.E. Makela T.P. Weinberg R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1335-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Therefore, we analyzed the consequences of both PAI-1 knockdown and knock-out in MEFs on the antiproliferative effect of TGFβ. Young rapidly growing primary MEFs were used as a TGFβ-sensitive control, whereas MEFs ablated for p53 (both knockdown and knock-out) served as positive controls for TGFβ growth arrest bypass (18Cordenonsi M. Dupont S. Maretto S. Insinga A. Imbriano C. Piccolo S. Cell. 2003; 113: 301-314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The wild-type MEFs or MEFs knockdown or knock-out for PAI-1 or over-expressing uPA exhibited normal p53 function (data not shown). When analyzing their proliferation in a colony formation assay in the presence of 10 or 100 pm TGFβ, we found that overexpression of uPA and knockdown or knock-out of PAI-1 induced a bypass of a growth arrest, which was comparable with the knockdown or knock-out of p53 (Fig. 2a). That PAI-1–/– MEFs are unresponsive to TGFβ strongly supports the notion that the TGFβ-bypass by PAI-1 knockdown is not an off target effect. Furthermore, when followed over time in a growth curve assay in the presence of 100 pm TGFβ, we found that overexpression of uPA or knockdown or knock-out of PAI-1 or p53 in MEFs also resulted in bypass of growth inhibition (Fig. 2b). SMAD4kd (also with normal p53 function) was added as a positive control (19Levy L. Hill C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 8108-8125Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2a, supplemental Fig. S2). We conclude that PAI-1 is also required for TGFβ-induced cytostasis in mouse embryo fibroblasts. To study whether PAI-1 affects the short-tem effects of TGFβ on cell cycle, we subjected both wild-type MEFs and PAI-1–/– MEFs to TGFβ overnight and analyzed the fraction of S-phase cells by measuring BrdUrd incorporation. Fig. 2c shows that wild-type MEFs had an immediate and strong decrease in S phase cells in response to TGFβ, whereas the PAI-1–/– MEFs were virtually non-responsive to TGFβ growth inhibition. The absence of a growth inhibitory response in the PAI-1–/– MEFs was not due to a lack of TGFβ signaling, as SMAD2 activation by phosphorylation was unaffected by PAI-1 loss. Treatment with TGFβ for 16 h (overnight) or 1 h resulted in a comparable induction of phospho-SMAD2 in either wild-type or PAI-1–/– MEFs (Fig. 2, d and e). We conclude that in MEFs, PAI-1 is critical for both short term and long term anti-proliferative responses to TGFβ. PAI-1 Knockdown Does Not Interfere with Canonical TGFβ Signaling—We next investigated to what extent reduction of PAI-1 levels in HaCaTs and MEFs would influence canonical TGFβ signaling, which is dependent on receptor-mediated SMAD2 activation by phosphorylation and specific cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor target gene activation (4Feng X.H. Derynck R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 659-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (1528) Google Scholar). After stimulation with 200 pm TGFβ for 10 days, HaCaT cells having knockdown of PAI-1 or SMAD4 or overexpression of uPA showed unaltered SMAD2 phosphorylation when compared with the control (Fig. 3a), whereas TGFβRIIkd cells had reduced SMAD2 phosphorylation (Fig. 3a). We subsequently determined whether target gene activation was influenced in TGFβ-resistant PAI-1kd cells. We analyzed the expression of the target genes PAI-1, p21CIP1, and p15INK4b in various TGFβ-resistant cell lines by QRT-PCR. We found that, compared with control cells, there was a reduction of the TGFβ target genes PAI-1, p21CIP1, and p15INK4b in TGFβRIIkd and SMAD4kd cells (Fig. 3b). In PAI-1kd cells PAI-1 levels were strongly reduced, whereas the induction of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21CIP1 and p15INK4b was unaltered compared with control TGFβ-treated cells (Fig. 3b). uPA overexpressing cells showed comparable PAI-1, p21CIP1, and p15INK4b levels to the control (Fig. 3b), consistent with the notion that uPA is downstream of PAI-1 and does not interfere with TGFβ target gene activation. The expression of protein levels of the TGFβ targets PAI-1 and p21CIP1 in the various knockdown cells mirrored the mRNA expression by the cells (supplemental Fig. S3). We conclude that loss of PAI-1 in HaCaT cells results in a bypass of the growth inhibitory effect of TGFβ in the presence of a functional SMAD signaling pathway and normal TGFβ target gene activation. We further analyzed SMAD2 activation in the various TGFβ-resistant MEF cell lines. Ablation of PAI-1 expression or uPA overexpression did not seem to interfere with SMAD2 phosphorylation in cells treated with TGFβ for 10 days when compared with TGFβ-arrested controls (Fig. 3c), again suggesting that PAI-1 knockdown leaves SMAD activation by TGFβ intact. Using QRT-PCR, we measured complete loss and strong reduction of PAI-1 expression in the PAI-1–/– and PAI-1kd MEFs, respectively (Fig. 3c). The high expression of PAI-1 in uPA-expressing MEFs is again consistent with the notion that uPA is downstream of PAI-1 in TGFβ signaling (Fig. 3d). We conclude that loss of PAI-1 in MEFs results in a bypass of the growth inhibitory effect of TGFβ in the presence of a functional SMAD signaling pathway and cytostatic target gene activation. Constitutive PI3K-PKB Signaling Induces Bypass of a TGFβ-induced Arrest—Next we sought to determine the downstream mechanism involved in bypass of the TGFβ arrest by PAI-1 knockdown. Recently we found that loss of PAI-1 causes persistent PI3K-PKB growth factor signaling in aging fibroblasts (15Kortlever R.M. Higgins P.J. Bernards R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 877-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Because PKB (AKT) signaling is involved in evasion of the cytostatic activity of TGFβ (20Viglietto G. Motti M.L. Bruni P. Melillo R.M. D'Alessio A. Califano D. Vinci F. Chiappetta G. Tsichlis P. Bellacosa A. Fusco A. Santoro M. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1136-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 21Shin I. Yakes F.M.

Lee J.H. Ciarallo S. Catzavelos C. Beniston R. Franssen E. Slingerland J.M. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1153-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar), we asked whether in this system loss of PAI-1 expression might lead to alteration of PKB activation. Indeed, when PAI-1kd HaCaT cells cultured in the presence of 200 pm TGFβ for 10 days were assayed for protein levels of active (phospho)-PKB we found that, compared with control-infected cells that arrest with strong reduction in phospho-PKB, both PAI-1kd and uPA-overexpressing cells retain activation of PKB as determined by phosphorylation of residue 473 (Fig. 4a). To address whether activated PI3K-PKB growth factor signaling might also be sufficient to induce a TGFβ-bypass, we stably infected HaCaT cells with retroviral constructs of constitutively active PI3K or PKB, a PTEN knockdown, or control RFP and tested in a colony formation assay for evasion of the cytostatic activity of TGFβ. PTEN is a potent inhibitor of PKB activation, and loss of this tumor suppressor has been found in many cancers (23Parsons R. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). We found both constitutively active PI3K and PKB activity as well as PTENkd to be sufficient for bypass of TGFβ arrest (Fig. 4b). Moreover, activation of PKB was retained when the cells were treated with TGFβ for 10 consecutive days (Fig. 4c). We suggest that loss of PAI-1 expression results in maintenance of PI3K-PKB signaling and that constitutive activation of PI3K-PKB growth factor signaling is sufficient for evasion of the cytostatic TGFβ response in HaCaT cells. PAI-1 is induced by TGFβ in a variety of cell types and is considered a classical target of TGFβ signaling. So far, however, it has mainly been recognized as being involved in extracellular matrix remodeling and tumor progression (13Andreasen P.A. Egelund R. Petersen H.H. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 25-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar, 14Choong P.F. Nadesapillai A.P. Clin. Orthop. 2003; 415: S46-S58Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). We show here that PAI-1 is directly required for the cytostatic activity of TGFβ in human keratinocytes and mouse fibroblasts. Loss of PAI-1 is as efficient as reduction of canonical TGFβ signaling or SMAD4 levels in bypassing a TGFβ arrest. Apparently, in addition to the effect PAI-1 has on cell motility and invasion, it is also critically involved in TGFβ-dependent proliferation. Our data imply that when the PAI-1:uPA balance shifts toward excess uPA, a cell no longer responds to the growth inhibitory effects of TGFβ. We propose that the PAI-1: uPA balance in a cell determines whether the response to TGFβ is antiproliferative or stimulates tumor progression. Interestingly, in breast cancer, the uPA:PAI-1 ratio is a powerful predictor of disease outcome (24Look M. van Putten W. Duffy M. Harbeck N. Christensen I.J. Thomssen C. Kates R. Spyratos F. Ferno M. Eppenberger-Castori S. Fred Sweep C.G. Ulm K. Peyrat J.P. Martin P.M. Magdelenat H. Brunner N. Duggan C. Lisboa B.W. Bendahl P.O. Quillien V. Daver A. Ricolleau G. Meijer-van Gelder M. Manders P.

Haemostasis. 2003; 90: 538-548PubMed Google Scholar). PAI-1 may, therefore, be instrumental for the effects of TGFβ on cancer progression. We also provide evidence that knockdown of PAI-1 or overexpression of its target uPA enhances PI3K-PKB growth factor signaling in the presence of TGFβ and that this itself is sufficient for bypass of a TGFβ arrest. Our data support in vivo studies showing that PKB activation makes breast cancer cells less sensitive to the growth-inhibitory effects of TGFβ. TGFβ induction of PAI-1 may, in addition to induction of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors p21CIP1 and p15INK4b, inhibit cell cycle progression by blocking growth factor-dependent CDK activation. In summary, we suggest that PAI-1 is a critical TGFβ-target required for induction of a cytostatic response in human keratinocytes and mouse embryo fibroblasts, possibly by attenuating PI3K-PKB growth factor signaling.

Bacterial cholesterol oxidase (CO, 2The abbreviations used are:COcholesterol oxidaseBCOB. sterolicum COEMTNenzyme-monitored turnover.

Vrielink A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 1635-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). From a mechanistic point of view, it catalyzes both the dehydrogenation of the C(3)-OH function of the cholestan system as well as the following isomerization of the intermediate cholest-5-en-3-one to yield cholest-4-en-3-one as the final product (Scheme 1) (2MacLachlan J.

Redox Signal. 2001; 3: 839-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Redox catalysis by CO can be separated into the two half-reactions, as shown in Scheme 2. The first half-reaction is the reduction of the flavin via hydride transfer from the alcohol (the reductive half-reaction), and the second half-reaction is the oxidation of the reduced flavin by molecular oxygen, the final acceptor (oxidative half-reaction) (4Pollegioni L.

CO has been discussed as a factor important for infection by the pathogenic bacterium Rhodococcus equi (7Machang'u R.S. Prescott J.F. Can. J. Vet.

Microbiol. 2006; 118: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar); because this enzymatic activity is unique to bacteria, it represents a potential target for new antibiotics. From a structural point of view, two different types of CO have been found in nature; COs type I, such as those from Streptomyces sp. SA-COO and R. equi (10Ladron N. Fernandez M. Agüero J. Gonzales Zörn B. Vasquez-Boland J.A. Navas J. J. Clin. Microbiol. 2003; 41: 3241-3245Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) containing non-covalently bound FAD, and type II COs (such as Brevibacterium sterolicum CO (BCO), used in this work), in which the cofactor is covalently linked to the protein through an 8-α-N1-histidyl bond to His-121 (corresponding to His-69 in the mature form of BCO) (11Vrielink A. Lloyd L.F. Blow D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 219: 533-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The covalent (type II) and non-covalent (type I) COs differ in many functional properties, such as absorbance spectra, redox potentials (Em difference ∼100 mV), and kinetic mechanisms (sequential versus ping-pong mechanism) (12Gadda G. Wels G. Pollegioni L. Zucchelli S. Ambrosius D. Pilone M.S. Ghisla S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 369-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 13Motteran L. Pilone M.S. Molla G. Ghisla S. Pollegioni L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18024-18030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structures of both CO types have been solved by Vrielink and coworkers (14Li J. Vrielink A. Brick P. Blow D.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11507-11515Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 15Coulombe R. Yue K.Q. Ghisla S. Vrielink A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30435-30441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar); they show completely different tertiary topologies. Type I CO is a member of the glucose-methanol-choline oxidoreductase family (14Li J. Vrielink A. Brick P. Blow D.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11507-11515Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), whereas the type II CO belongs to the vanillyl-alcohol oxidase subfamily (15Coulombe R. Yue K.Q. Ghisla S. Vrielink A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30435-30441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), a fold proposed to favor covalent flavinylation. Despite its basic importance, there are gaps in our knowledge of the mechanism of oxygen activation by flavoproteins and, in particular, by COs as well as its regulation and suppression. COs belonging to both fold classes contain narrow channels extending from the surface to the buried active sites cavity that has been proposed to serve in oxygen access (see Fig. 1 for BCO) (1Lario P.I. Sampson N. Vrielink A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 1635-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 15Coulombe R. Yue K.Q. Ghisla S. Vrielink A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30435-30441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In recent years molecular tunnels have emerged as common structural features among different classes of enzymes. In both types of COs the tunnel is flanked mainly by hydrophobic residues (at least in the most external region) and houses a single string of water molecules. This finding suggests that oxygen does not diffuse freely into the active site of COs but that access is modulated by specific, protein-mediated events. Interestingly, both tunnels appear to be gated by an Arg (in BCO, type II CO) or an Asn (in Streptomyces sp. SA-COO, type I CO) residue, albeit operating in opposite fashions. The tunnel is, thus, closed when the Arg-477 side chain of BCO is positioned at a hydrogen bonding distance of the flavin ring system (compare the alternative positions of Arg-477 side chain reported in Fig. 1). In type I CO the tunnel is open when Asn-485 lies closer to the flavin system (1Lario P.I. Sampson N. Vrielink A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 1635-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). These differences might be at the origin of the variance in oxygen reactivity of the two types of COs. In particular, the gating function of the Arg-477 might provide a rationale for the unusual saturation behavior reflected by the kinetics of the reaction of reduced BCO with oxygen (4Pollegioni L. Wels G. Pilone M.S. Ghisla S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 140-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We previously proposed that this behavior reflects a reversible conversion of two enzyme forms possessing different oxygen reactivities (i.e. E-FAD*red and E-FADred in Scheme 2); these two species might, thus, correspond to the “open tunnel” and “closed tunnel” conformations identified by the structural analysis (15Coulombe R. Yue K.Q. Ghisla S. Vrielink A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30435-30441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of BCO leads to the identification of several residues other than Arg-477 that could be important for oxygen access/reactivity: Ala-204, Ser-307, Gly-309, Glu-311, Ile-423, and Glu-475 (Fig. 1). The two latter residues in particular adopt two distinct conformations (as Arg-477), and their movements appear to be coordinated with each other and with that of Arg-477 (15Coulombe R. Yue K.Q. Ghisla S. Vrielink A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30435-30441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The scope of the present study is to verify the presence and role of the proposed oxygen tunnel and, in particular, the function of the amino acid side chains possibly forming the mentioned gate. To reach this goal BCO mutants at some of the positions mentioned above were generated and characterized. Comprehension of the mechanism of oxygen reactivity in CO could, thus, shed light on the mechanisms by which flavoprotein oxidases govern the access of and the reactivity with molecular oxygen, this being a fundamental topic in biochemistry that still awaits elucidation. It should be mentioned that similar studies on heme proteins have recently produced important insights (16Hofacker I. Schulten K. Proteins Struct. Funct.

Reagents and DNA Manipulation—Restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs. Enzymatic DNA modifications were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions and as described in Sambrook et al. (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA extraction and purification were performed using FlexiPrep™ and Sephaglas™ BandPrep kits from GE Healthcare. Thesit® (polyethylene glycol 400 dodecyl ether), cholesterol, and cholest-5-en-3-one were from Fluka. All chromatographic columns were from GE Healthcare. Cloning, Mutagenesis, Enzyme Expression, and Purification— A synthetic gene coding for the BCO mature form was obtained from Medigenomix GmbH (Martinsried, Germany). It is based on the amino acid sequence reported in the three-dimensional structure, PDB accession code 1I19 (15Coulombe R. Yue K.Q. Ghisla S. Vrielink A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30435-30441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The coding nucleotide sequence was optimized for expression in Escherichia coli. The synthetic gene was cloned into the expression plasmid pET24b(+) (Novagen) using NdeI/XhoI restriction sites. Mutagenesis reactions were performed using QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Recombinant BL21(DE3)pLysS E. coli cells were grown in 2×LB or TB media (Sigma) supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics (chloramphenicol 34 mg/liter and kanamycin 30 mg/liter, final concentration) at 37 °C up to late stationary phase (absorbance at 600 nm, ∼1.5–2). Induction was done with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm final concentration), and cells were collected after 14–26 h of growth at 25 °C. Wild-type and mutant BCOs were expressed in E. coli cells in fairly good amounts (about 5 mg of pure enzyme/g cell; 15 mg pure enzyme/liter culture). Recombinant BCOs (all containing a C-terminal His tag) were purified using Ni2+ affinity chromatography (HiTrap Chelating HP columns equilibrated with 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 1 m NaCl). Elution of bound enzyme was performed with a linear gradient of imidazole (0–0.5 m) in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl; recombinant BCOs eluted at about 0.075–0.1 m imidazole. Imidazole was removed by extensive dialysis against 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. Isolation of CO Preparations Devoid of Non-covalently Bound FAD—Recombinant enzyme preparations devoid of non-covalently bound FAD were obtained by exploiting the higher thermolability of the BCO containing non-covalent FAD compared with the covalent form. The substrate cholesterol was also present as the reduced form of BCO containing covalently linked FAD was found to be selectively stabilized. A 1-ml sample of BCO containing 0.5 mm cholesterol was incubated for 3 min at 45 °C. The resulting turbid preparation was centrifuged for 2 min at 12,000 rpm in an Eppendorf tube to yield a clear, yellow supernatant and a white pellet (the non-covalent form of BCO) that was discarded. The supernatant was ultrafiltered through a BIOMAX 5000 membrane (Millipore) to ∼10% that of the original volume. This was diluted with 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, and the filtration procedure was repeated. The filtrate contains unmodified FAD, whereas the fraction in the upper chamber consists of BCO containing covalently bound FAD. The ratio of the quantities of FAD present in free form (filtrate) versus that bound to BCO (retained fraction) reflects the ratio of non-covalently versus covalently FAD-bound BCO forms. The procedure gives BCO preparations with covalently bound FAD at a purity >95% and yields ranging from 20 to 90% that of the starting material, depending on the BCO mutant. Spectroscopic Experiments—All spectral experiments were carried out at 15 °C in 100 mm potassium phosphate at pH 7.5. Extinction coefficients of the enzyme forms were determined by complete denaturation of the enzyme in 6.4 m guanidinium-HCl, 20 mm potassium phosphate at pH 7.5 assuming that the extinction coefficient of fully denatured enzyme-bound FAD is the same as that of the free FAD (11,300 m-1 cm-1) (22Whitby L.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1954; 15: 148-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). For the study of the interaction with sulfite, the reagent (sodium salt) was prepared just before use as a 2 m stock solution in 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5. Aliquots were then added to enzyme (∼10 μm), and the changes in absorbance at 450 nm were recorded; this reflects formation of the N(5)-sulfite adduct (12Gadda G. Wels G. Pollegioni L. Zucchelli S. Ambrosius D. Pilone M.S. Ghisla S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 369-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The rate of complex dissociation (koff) was determined spectrophotometrically by following the decay of the complex in a sample that was freed of excess sulfite by gel filtration on a Sephadex G25 column (PD10 column) (12Gadda G.

Enzymatic Activity and Kinetic Measurements—Kinetic experiments were performed at 25 °C and pH 7.5 in 100 mm potassium phosphate in the presence of 1% Thesit and 1% propan-2-ol (dehydrogenation reaction) or 10% propan-2-ol (isomerization reaction) (v/v final concentrations). Steady-state kinetic measurements at constant O2 concentration (0.25 mm, air saturation at 25 °C) were performed by monitoring H2O2 production using the horseradish peroxidase assay (4 μg/ml, 0.3 mg/ml o-dianisidine, Δϵ440 = 13 mm-1 cm-1) as previously described (4Pollegioni L.

The isomerization reaction (Scheme 1) was followed spectrophotometrically at 240 nm (Δϵ240 = 15.5 mm-1 cm-1). Rapid kinetic measurements were performed as described previously (4Pollegioni L. Wels G.

The steady-state kinetics for the reactions at saturating O2 and cholesterol concentrations was assessed based on the enzyme-monitored turnover (EMTN) method of Gibson et al. (24Gibson Q.H. Swoboda B.E. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 3927-3934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in which the enzyme was mixed with an equal volume of substrate solution (either aerobic or anaerobic to yield a final O2 concentration = 0.125 mm) in the stopped-flow instrument. The trace at 446–453 nm (depending on the enzyme form) detects the conversion of oxidized into reduced enzyme forms. For EMTN experiments traces were analyzed according to Gibson et al.

Recombinant wild-type BCO as well as most other mutants was obtained as a mixture of enzyme forms containing covalently as well as non-covalently bound FAD (Table 1). The two forms of BCO were identified based on the differences in their absorption spectra (13Motteran L. Pilone M.S. Molla G. Ghisla S. Pollegioni L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18024-18030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and their ratio was estimated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” This value is about 1:1 in the case of wild-type and A204C and R477A/K BCO mutants, whereas with G309A/C and I423L/V mutants the covalent form is more prominent (60–80%, Table 1). For these BCO proteins the use of different expression conditions (variation of cultivation media, growth temperatures, and time of recovery after isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside addition) did not result in the expression of a unique (either covalently or non-covalently bound FAD) protein. The biochemical characterization of all BCO variants was carried out using preparations containing essentially only covalent FAD (>95%), obtained as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The absence of substantial quantities of the apoprotein form was assessed based on the A278 nm/A450 nm ratio that was ≤14.5.TABLE 1Properties of wild-type BCO and mutants upon isolation and purification The extent of covalently bound FAD present in purified BCO preparations was estimated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The extent of flavin reduction was estimated from the relative decrease of the absorbance at the maximum in the visible region that occurs upon anaerobic addition of cholesterol (2–5 molar excess or as specified in parentheses).

The spectra of recombinant and commercial wild-type BCOs are identical. This provides a basis for comparison with previous studies done with the latter (12Gadda G. Wels G. Pollegioni L. Zucchelli S.

In general, mutations induce a minor hypochromic effect on the main absorption band in the visible (Fig. 2). This is depicted for the Glu-311 mutants in Fig. 2A, where also a 7–10-nm shift of its maximum to longer wavelengths is evident. In the case of Arg-477 mutants, and particularly of R477A BCO, the spectral shape (Fig. 2B) is modified to reflect a more hydrophobic environment (26Muller F. Mayhew S.G. Massey V. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 4654-4662Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Minor alterations of the absorption spectrum were also observed for the other BCO mutants (Figs. 2, C and D, and Table 1); this is consistent with the assumption that the modifications at the active center induce only minor structural effects. Noteworthy, the near- and far-UV CD spectra of all BCO mutants (not shown) are similar to that of wild-type BCO, thus confirming the absence of main conformational changes. The reduced forms of BCOs were obtained by anaerobic reduction with cholesterol. Wild-type BCO and the A204C, G309C, E311D/Q, E475D/Q, and R477K BCO mutants are completely reduced within a few seconds by a 2–5 molar excess of cholesterol. G309A and I423L/I423V mutants were also promptly reduced but only after the addition of about a 20-fold molar excess of cholesterol. The obtained spectra are characteristic of reduced flavoproteins, with minor differences for individual mutants (not shown), again suggesting t"

PDE6 contains two regulatory GAF domains, of which one (GAF A) binds cGMP and regulates the activity of the PDE6 holoenzyme. To increase our understanding of this allosteric regulation mechanism, we present the 2.6Å crystal structure of the cGMP-bound GAF A domain of chicken cone PDE6. Nucleotide specificity appears to be provided in part by the orientation of Asn-116, which makes two hydrogen bonds to the guanine ring of cGMP but is not strictly conserved among PDE6 isoforms. The isolated PDE6C GAF A domain is monomeric and does not contain sufficient structural determinants to form a homodimer as found in full-length PDE6C. A highly conserved surface patch on GAF A indicates a potential binding site for the inhibitory subunit Pγ. NMR studies reveal that the apo-PDE6C GAF A domain is structured but adopts a significantly altered structural state indicating a large conformational change with rearrangement of secondary structure elements upon cGMP binding.

Light detection by rod and cone photoreceptors of vertebrate retina is a complex signal transduction process that utilizes cGMP as an intracellular messenger in the conversion of photon stimulation into an electrical response. Upon light stimulation, the phototransduction cascade begins with activation of light-sensitive rhodopsin, which activates the G-protein transducin, whose Gα subunit binds and sequesters an inhibitory subunit Pγ of the photoreceptor phosphodiesterase (PDE6). 4The abbreviations used are: PDE6photoreceptor phosphodiesterasePDE3′, 5′-cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesteraseHSQCheteronuclear single quantum correlationSeMetselenomethionine. This in turn leads to the activation of the catalytic subunit of PDE6 and hydrolysis of cGMP (1Cote R.H. Beavo J.A. Francis S.H.

By lowering the intracellular cGMP levels, activated PDE6 causes hyperpolarization of the photoreceptor cell via cGMP-gated ion channels. cGMP levels are quickly restored by synthesis through calcium-sensitive photoreceptor guanylyl cyclases to re-establish the dark-adapted state. As a rapid turnover of cGMP is mandatory for effective visual function, PDE6 is well adapted for this purpose. photoreceptor phosphodiesterase 3′, 5′-cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase heteronuclear single quantum correlation selenomethionine. Rod photoreceptors are at least a hundred times more sensitive to light than cone photoreceptors. Nevertheless, cone photoreceptors are able to respond more quickly and terminate the light signal more rapidly (3Pugh Jr., E.N. Cobbs W.H. Vision Res. 1986; 26: 1613-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Structural differences between rod and cone isoforms of PDE6 are thought to be critical determinants of the photoreceptor responses as they display subunit organizations that differ between rod and cone isoforms. Rod PDE6 contains two distinct catalytic subunits (α and β) and two inhibitory Pγ subunits to form a heterotetramer (Pαβγ2), whereas cone PDE6 contains two identical cone-specific catalytic subunits α′ and two cone-specific Pγ subunits to form Pα′2γ2 (4Artemyev N.O. Surendran R. Lee J.C. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25382-25388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Most previous biochemical studies have utilized the heteromeric Pαβγ2 holoenzyme from rod photoreceptors. Less is known about the cone photoreceptor isoform of PDE6. PDE6 is one of 11 vertebrate cyclic nucleotide PDE families. Of these, PDE2, -5, -6, -10, and -11 contain tandem GAF domains (GAF A and GAF B) that are located N-terminally to the more conserved catalytic domains. The acronym GAF is derived from the first identified GAF domain-containing protein families: mammalian cGMP-regulated PDEs, Anabaena adenylyl cyclases, and the Escherichia coli transcription factor FhlA (5Aravind L. Ponting C.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 458-459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). GAF domains are small molecule binding domains that are structurally related to Per-ARNT-Sim domains (6Martinez S.E. Beavo J.A. Hol W.G. Mol.

GAF domains are conserved over more than 3 billion years and function as signal transduction modules in light detection of plants (8Wagner J.R. Brunzelle J.S. Forest K.T. Vierstra R.D. Nature. 2005; 438: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar), sodium sensing (9Cann M. Mol.

At this point, the details of the regulatory mechanism(s) and the exact roles of the GAF A and GAF B domains of PDE6 remain elusive. GAF A from PDE6C has been shown to bind cGMP (11Gillespie P.G. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8133-8141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but whether cGMP binding activates the catalytic domain through an allosteric conformational change as reported for PDE2A and PDE5A (12Martins T.J.

Binding of cGMP to rod PDE6 has been shown to increase the binding affinity of Pγ to the holoenzyme (14Cote R.H. Bownds M.D. Arshavsky V.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cross-linking studies of rod Pγ to the catalytic PDE6 αβ-heterodimer revealed that Pγ binds in an extended manner, with the N-terminal, polycationic region binding in the vicinity of GAF A, and the C-terminal region in the vicinity of the catalytic domain (16Guo L.W.

Pγ binding blocks catalytic activity and also increases the affinity of GAF A for cGMP. As no recombinant PDE6 holoenzyme has been successfully expressed, we have utilized the recombinantly expressed GAF A domain of chicken PDE6C in an attempt to gain insights into the structural nature and function of the allosteric cGMP-binding site and of the oligomerization of the PDE6 holoenzyme. In this study, we report a 2.6 Å crystal structure of the GAF A domain from chicken cone PDE6. Although the overall fold is similar to other known GAF domains, a detailed comparison of the cGMP-binding pockets of PDE6C GAF A and PDE2A GAF B reveals significant differences, indicating that the PDE GAF domains have a variety of ways to bind the identical ligand, an observation that is consistent with their widespread occurrence as ligand-binding domains in signal transduction pathways (5Aravind L. Ponting C.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 458-459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 18Anantharaman V. Koonin E.V. Aravind L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1271-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The monomeric structure of GAF A stands in contrast to the dimeric crystal structure of PDE2A GAF AB, in which GAF A is part of the dimerization interface of a parallel dimer (19Martinez S.E. Wu A.Y. Glavas N.A. Tang X.B. Turley S. Hol W.G. Beavo J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13260-13265Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Furthermore, combined NMR and circular dichroism studies reveal that the ligand-free form of PDE6C GAF A adopts a thermodynamically less stable structural state that is significantly altered compared with the cGMP-bound state. Cloning, Expression, and Purification—cDNA for full-length chicken PDE6C was a generous gift from Dr. Susan Semple-Rowland (University of Florida). GAF A (residues 55–225 plus the C-terminal LE(H6) tag) was expressed in C41 E. coli cells (a derivative strain of BL21(DE3) (20Miroux B. Walker J.E. J. Mol.

Purification was performed at 4 °C. Four buffers were prepared: lysis (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, 20% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride); wash-1 (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 15 mm imidazole, 20% glycerol, 400 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2); wash-2 (same as wash-1, but 10 mm NaCl); and elution (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 250 mm imidazole, 20% glycerol, 10 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2). After centrifugation at 3,000 × g, cells were resuspended in lysis buffer and lysed in a microfluidizer at 10,000 p.s.i. After centrifugation, the lysate was applied to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid gravity column (15 ml). The column was washed with wash-1 and wash-2 buffers. Protein was eluted with elution buffer and then applied to 25 ml of epoxy-Sepharose cGMP affinity resin (column size of 25 mm) and washed with high salt buffer (0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and low salt buffer (same as high salt buffer but with 0.2 m NaCl). The protein was eluted with low salt buffer (plus 1 mm cGMP (Sigma)). Usual yields of purified protein were ∼5 mg from 9 liters of LB culture. The protein was determined to be >95% pure by SDS-PAGE. Crystallization, Structure Determination, and Refinement—The purified GAF A domain was concentrated in Centricon 30 units (Millipore) to 5 mg/ml and exchanged into 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm cGMP. Crystals were grown at room temperature in sitting drops with 0.5 ml of precipitant (1.5–1.8 m ammonium sulfate, 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 4.5–5.0) in the reservoir and equal volumes (2–10 μl) of protein and precipitant in the drop. Crystals grew to maximum dimensions of ∼600 × 300 × 250 μm within several weeks and were then frozen in liquid nitrogen after soaking for 2–3 min in cryo-buffer (20% v/v glycerol, 1.5 or 1.6 m ammonium sulfate, 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5 or 5.0, 1 mm cGMP, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm EDTA). A 2.5 Å SAD peak Se-Met data set was collected from a crystal in cryo-buffer (pH 5.0, 1.6 m ammonium sulfate) at 12,662.5 eV (0.97912 Å) (1 eV = 1.602 × 10–19 J) at the National Synchrotron Light Source beamline X4A. Nine of the 10 selenium atoms (five seleniums for each of two monomers in asymmetric unit) were determined with the program SOLVE (22Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

The space group was P3221, and 87.6% of the residues in the final model were in the most favored area of the Ramachandran plot (additional structural statistics are provided in supplemental Table S1).

Preparation of Isotopically Labeled PDE6 GAF A and NMR Experiments—Uniformly 15N-labeled PDE6C GAF A for NMR studies was grown in M9 minimal media with 15N-NH4Cl (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories). Cell lysis and nickel affinity column chromatography were carried out as described above. The nickel column eluate was concentrated and injected onto a Superdex 75 column. A single peak was eluted with 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 0.1 mm EDTA. Upon fractionation, dithiothreitol to a final concentration of 1 mm was added. NMR samples were concentrated to ∼150 μm, and 10% D2O was added. cGMP to a final concentration of 1 mm was added for the spectrum of the cGMP-bound form. 1H,15N HSQC spectra were collected at 20 °C on a Varian 800-MHz INOVA spectrometer equipped with 1H-13C,15N-cold probe. All spectra were processed and analyzed using NMRDraw (27Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11632) Google Scholar) and NMRView (28Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2686) Google Scholar). Determination of the Rotational Correlation Time—To determine the rotational correlation time of 0.7 mm PDE6C GAF A in the presence of cGMP, we measured 15N spin relaxation parameters (R1, R2) and the steady-state heteronuclear 1H,15N NOEs using standard pulse sequences (29Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (2018) Google Scholar) at 37 °C on a Bruker 500 MHz DMX spectrometer. 15N-T1 relaxation delays were 10, 50, 100, 200, 400, 600, 800, and 1000 ms (underlined delays were duplicated). 15N-T2 relaxation delays were 17.2, 34.4, 51.7, 69.0, 86.2, 103.5, and 120.7 ms (underlined delays were duplicated). Only well resolved resonances were used for the dynamics analysis (85 resonances) by NMRView (28Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2686) Google Scholar) and Modelfree 4.15 (30Mandel A.M. Akke M. Palmer III, A.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 144-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). Circular Dichroism Studies—Circular dichroism studies were performed on a 62A DS spectrometer (Aviv Biomedical). Spectra were collected with 10–20 μm PDE6C GAF A in 100 mm NaCl, 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol in the absence and presence of 0.5 mm cGMP (cuvette path length, 0.1 cm). To monitor the temperature-dependent denaturation through thermal scans, ellipticity at the α-helical signal of 222 nm as a function of temperature was measured in the range of 10–85 °C with steps every 3 °C and a 60-s equilibration time at each step. Overall GAF Domain Fold—The crystal structure of the chicken PDE6C GAF A domain, determined at a resolution of 2.6 Å, displays a typical GAF domain fold with a six-stranded antiparallel β-sheet arranged in the strand order 3-2-1-6-5-4 (Fig. 1A). The β-sheet provides the floor, and the two helices α3 and α4 comprise the roof of a deeply buried cGMP-binding pocket. The helical dipole of α3, which is between β3 and β4 in the primary structure, points toward the phosphate group of the bound cGMP molecule. α4, which is between β4 and β5 in sequence, sits atop the cGMP molecule. Helices α1 and α2 precede the first β-strand and, together with α5, form a three-helix bundle that packs against the β-sheet on the opposite side of the cGMP-binding pocket. Strands β2 and β3 are connected by an 18-residue loop that includes a short α-helix (α2/3). Excluding helix α1, both monomers in the asymmetric unit superimpose well with a root mean square deviation of 0.5 Å over 149 equivalent C-α atoms. The crystal structure of chicken PDE6C GAF A indicates that GAF A does not form a homodimer. The asymmetric unit of the crystal contains two monomers that do not dimerize with each other or with monomers related by lattice symmetry. Notably, helix α1 is in a different orientation in the two monomers (Fig. 1A) because of a distinct packing environment of each monomer and lack of a dimerization interface to restrain the helix. To confirm the monomeric state in solution, we determined the rotational correlation time τc of cGMP-bound 15N-PDE6C GAF A through 15N relaxation measurements by NMR. The calculated value for τc of 12.4 ns at 37 °C is in a range typical for proteins of similar size (∼20 kDa), therefore confirming that GAF A is monomeric in solution at millimolar concentrations. Apo and cGMP-bound PDE6C GAF A elute at the same elution volume and have identical elution peak shape in analytical size exclusion chromatograms (supplemental Fig. S1). Together, the data indicate that GAF A is intrinsically a monomer and that cGMP binding does not alter the oligomeric state of GAF A. cGMP-binding Site of PDE6C GAF A—Cyclic GMP is bound in the anti-conformation (Fig. 1B), similar to cGMP in PDE2A GAF B (19Martinez S.E. Wu A.Y. Glavas N.A. Tang X.B. Turley S. Hol W.G. Beavo J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13260-13265Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) and cAMP in the tandem GAF domains of the cyanobacterial adenylyl cyclase cyaB2 (31Martinez S.E. Bruder S. Schultz A. Zheng N. Schultz J.E. Beavo J.A. Linder J.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 3082-3087Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and PDE10A GAF B (32Handa N. Mizohata E. Kishishita S. Toyama M. Morita S. Uchikubo-Kamo T. Akasaka R. Omori K. Kotera J. Terada T. Shirouzu M. Yokoyama S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 19657-19664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Similar to the previously solved cyclic nucleotide-binding GAF domains, nearly the entire 493 Å2 of solvent-accessible surface area of the nucleotide is buried in PDE6C, indicating that the GAF domain is in a closed state that forms upon cGMP binding. Because of a lower overall B factor, we use chain A to describe the binding pocket. The electron density map shows that the 3′,5′-cyclic phosphate group is in the chair conformation (supplemental Fig. S2). The N-terminal end of helix α3 points toward the phosphate group, bringing the negatively charged phosphate group adjacent to the partial positive charge of the helix dipole. The guanine ring makes several contacts to the protein and is well defined through a series of protein-ligand interactions (Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. S3). Asn-116 provides two important cGMP-specific protein-ligand hydrogen bonds. The carbonyl oxygen of its side chain makes a 2.7-Å hydrogen bond to the protonated N-1 of the guanine ring, and its backbone amide makes a 2.9 Å hydrogen bond to the O-6 carbonyl oxygen of cGMP. Furthermore, Asn-116 is locked into position by a 3.0-Å salt bridge between the partial negative charge of its carbonyl oxygen and the guanidine group of Arg-95. Finally, Asn-116 may provide yet another specificity determinant through a water-mediated hydrogen bond to the N-2 amino group (via HOH-264). Another hydrogen bond to the N-2 amino group of the guanine ring is provided by the side chain of Thr-172, which is 3.4 Å away. This side chain also provides two water-mediated hydrogen bonds (via HOH-254) to the N-2 amino group and the N-3 ring nitrogen. Ser-97 provides an additional 2.7 Å hydrogen bond to N-7 of the guanine ring of cGMP. In addition to the described protein-ligand hydrogen bond network, hydrophobic interactions play an important role in the definition of the cGMP-binding pocket and nucleotide orientation. The guanine ring is sandwiched between the side chains from Phe-99, Leu-115, Leu-168, Tyr-174, and Leu-197. Conformational Change upon Binding of cGMP—We are able to purify and concentrate the recombinant PDE6C GAF A domain in the absence of cGMP to millimolar concentrations but have been unsuccessful in producing diffraction-quality crystals. Therefore, we utilized two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy to investigate the nature of the conformational change between the ligand-free and cGMP-bound forms. An overlay of 1H,15N HSQC spectra of 15N-labeled PDE6C GAF A in the absence and presence of cGMP (Fig. 2A) reveals that PDE6C GAF A is folded in both cases. However, the two states adopt significantly different conformations, as an overwhelming majority of the amide resonances is perturbed by more than a line width. The resonances in the spectrum of apo-PDE6C GAF A vary widely in their intensities, indicative of exchange among multiple states, with a subset of peaks broadened beyond detection. Circular dichroism spectra of both states of PDE6C GAF A are virtually indistinguishable and both have a strong signal for α-helical secondary structure, indicated by minima at 208 and 218 nm. The negligible difference in the spectra suggests that the two states do not differ significantly in their secondary structural element content. To assess protein stability, we measured the ellipticity at the α-helical signal of 222 nm as a function of temperature (Fig. 2B). The observed 20 °C increase in the melting temperature upon addition of cGMP indicates considerable thermodynamic stabilization of PDE6C GAF A through cGMP binding. This supports the hypothesis that both states differ in their global tertiary structure rather than through local unfolding of secondary structure elements. Nevertheless, the conformational change does not lead to an overall altered hydrodynamic behavior as analytical size exclusion chromatography reveals no observable difference in peak position or shape (supplemental Fig. S1). Conserved Interaction Surface—An alignment of PDE6 GAF A sequences from cone and rod photoreceptors reveals that stretches of the sequences between β1 and α3, which encompass β2, α2/3, and β3, are strongly conserved with a large number of strictly conserved residues (Fig. 3A). When plotted onto the crystal structure of PDE6C GAF A, several of these conserved residues form a contiguous solvent-accessible surface patch on the PDE6C GAF A structure (Fig. 3B). This surface patch contains several charged residues. Arg-102 and Arg-104 are surrounded by Glu-109, Asp-131, and Glu-133. Val-135 and Pro-137 extend the surface toward another negatively charged residue, Asp-139 (Fig. 3C, left panel). Ile-140, Gly-141, and His-163, which all have been previously proposed to be in the vicinity of the Pγ-binding site (33Muradov H. Boyd K.K. Artemyev N.O. Vision Res. 2004; 44: 2437-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 34Muradov K.G. Granovsky A.E. Schey K.L. Artemyev N.O. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3884-3890Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), are also within the conserved surface or in close proximity to it (highlighted in magenta in Fig. 3C). An elongated surface with numerous negatively charged and hydrophobic residues can be drawn from Asp-131 to His-163 and may be responsible for the interaction with the polycationic region of Pγ. A second smaller conserved surface patch is located on the opposite side of GAF A. It contains several positively charged amino acids (Fig. 3C, right panel) indicating that it is less likely to be the interaction surface for Pγ. Comparison of Overall GAF Domain Fold—The overall fold of the PDE6C GAF A domain is very similar to the topology of previously characterized cyclic nucleotide-binding GAF domains. The largest difference between the published GAF domain structures is the length and sequence of the β2-β3 loop, as was previously discussed (31Martinez S.E. Bruder S. Schultz A. Zheng N. Schultz J.E. Beavo J.A. Linder J.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 3082-3087Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This stretch contains a short helical turn in PDE6C, termed α2/3, which is positioned to stabilize Asn-116, a critical cGMP-contacting residue. In particular, the side chains of Ser-121 and Asn-126 make hydrogen bonds to the backbone carbonyl of Asn-116 and may help to lock its side and main chains into position to provide the nucleotide-selective hydrogen bonds. A solution structure of PDE5A GAF A revealed that the cGMP-selective GAF domain of PDE5A contains a similar helical turn (35Heikaus C.C. Stout J.R. Sekharan M.R. Eakin C.M. Rajagopal P. Brzovic P.S. Beavo J.A. Klevit R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 22749-22759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Comparison of cGMP-binding Pockets of PDE6C and PDE2A—Systematic alanine mutations of binding residues of PDE2A GAF B revealed that three guanine-binding side chains (Asp-439, Phe-438, and Thr-488) were required for the ∼30-fold higher affinity for cGMP over cAMP (36Wu A.Y. Tang X.B. Martinez S.E. Ikeda K. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37928-37938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The side chain of Asp-439 is hydrogen-bound to the guanine N-1, and its backbone amide is a hydrogen bond donor to the O-6 carbonyl of the guanine. Phe-438 is base-stacked with the guanine ring, whereas Thr-488 contacts the guanine N-2 via a water-mediated hydrogen bond. In PDE6C GAF A, these residues correspond to Asn-116, Leu-115, and Thr-172. Asn-116 of PDE6C, the equivalent residue to Asp-439 of PDE2A, provides two protein-ligand hydrogen bonds (Fig. 1B) and therefore serves as a negative determinant against cAMP binding as both hydrogen bonds cannot be satisfied by the adenine ring. Surprisingly, a sequence alignment of GAF A domain sequences from PDE6A, -B, and -C of different species reveals that Asn-116 is variable within the PDE6 gene family and can be an Asn, an Asp, or a Ser (Fig. 3A). As all three side chains have oxygen atoms capable of serving as hydrogen bond acceptors, it is likely that Ser, Asn, and Asp each make similar side chain contacts to N-1 of the guanine ring. All other characterized cGMP-binding GAF domains (PDE2A GAF B, PDE5A GAF A, and PDE11A GAF A) have an Asp at the analogous position. Leu-115 of PDE6C is equivalent to Phe-438 in PDE2A. Whereas Phe-438 likely provides aromatic π -π -base stacking as it is aligned in parallel with the guanine ring, Leu-115 of PDE6C provides hydrophobic interactions instead. The equivalent amino acid in rod PDE6 (isoforms A and B) is a Phe, whereas it is a Leu in most PDE6C sequences (Fig. 3A). Thr-172 of PDE6C makes a direct hydrogen bond to the guanine N-2, whereas Thr-488, the equivalent residue in PDE2A, is too far for a direct hydrogen bond (3.8 Å) and makes a water-mediated hydrogen bond instead. Other side chain contacts with the cGMP molecule are similar in PDE6C and PDE2A. Structural Determinants of Affinity and Specificity—GAF domains from different PDEs bind cGMP and cAMP with a wide variety of affinities and specificities. The tandem GAF domains of PDE2A and PDE5A have low nanomolar affinities for cGMP binding but vary in their selectivity against cAMP from 30-fold (PDE2A (36Wu A.Y. Tang X.B. Martinez S.E. Ikeda K.

https://openalex.org/W1569558374,"Interaction of the mRNA cap with the translational machinery is a critical and early step in the initiation of protein synthesis. To better understand this process, we determined kinetic constants for the interaction of m(7)GpppG with human eIF4E by stopped-flow fluorescence quenching in the presence of a 90-amino acid fragment of human eIF4G that contains the eIF4E-binding domain (eIF4G(557-646)). The values obtained, k(on) = 179 x 10(6) m(-1) s(-1) and k(off) = 79 s(-1), were the same as reported previously in the absence of an eIF4G-derived peptide. We also used surface plasmon resonance to determine kinetic constants for the binding of eIF4E to eIF4G(557-646), both in the presence and absence of m(7)GpppG. The results indicated that eIF4G(557-646) binds eIF4E and eIF4E.m(7)GpppG at the same rate, with k(on) = 3 x 10(6) m(-1) s(-1) and k(off) = 0.01 s(-1). Our data represent the first full kinetic description of the interaction of eIF4E with its two specific ligands. The results demonstrate that the formation of the m(7)GpppG.eIF4E.eIF4G(557-646) complex obeys a sequential, random kinetic mechanism and that there is no preferential pathway for its formation. Thus, even though eIF4G(557-646) binds eIF4E tightly, it does not increase the affinity of eIF4E for m(7)GpppG, as has been claimed in several previous publications. We did, in fact, observe increased binding to m(7)GTP-Sepharose in the presence of eIF4G(557-646), but only with recombinant eIF4E that was prepared from inclusion bodies."
https://openalex.org/W2075661459,"The influenza vaccine failed this winter. Steven Salzberg suggests that future success relies on sharing data more widely and making the virus strain selection process more transparent. The 'official' influenza vaccine failed this year. Each year the World Health Organization selects strains for the vaccine based on epidemiological data. Most of the time it works, but what can be done to prevent future failures? Steven Salzberg thinks the answer lies in better tracking of virus mutations. This means that some research groups need to change their ways. Instead of guarding their data, the priority should be the rapid dissemination of genome sequence data on all isolates — human and avian. More transparency is one of the recommendations made by Yamada et al. in a checklist on how we should prepare for the next influenza pandemic. Other suggestions include stockpiling standard (inter-pandemic) flu vaccine, a special pricing model for poor countries, and improved surveillance mechanisms.

Furthermore, to establish an effective culture system of mouse ES cells, we applied the co-immobilized surface of E-cad-Fc and LIF-Fc. Cell Culture—We used the following mouse ES cell lines: two feeder-dependent ES cell lines, Jxl1 cells (established from 129/SvJ x 129/SvImJ mice) and R1 cells (14Nagy A. Rossant J. Nagy R. Abramow-Newerly W. Roder J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8424-8428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1992) Google Scholar); and feeder-free EB3 cells (15Niwa H. Masui S. Chambers I. Smith A.G. Miyazaki J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1526-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Jxl1 and R1 cells were maintained on mouse embryonic fibroblasts in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Chemicon), supplemented with 1% nonessential amino acids (Chemicon), 0.1 mm β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma), 15% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS), and 1,000 units/ml LIF. For several experiments, Jxl1 and R1 cells were adapted to the feeder-free culture condition. Cells were seeded in the media containing 15% knock-out serum replacement (Invitrogen) and 5,000 units/ml LIF. EB3 cells were maintained on 0.1% gelatin-coated surfaces in knock-out/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen), supplemented with 1 mm l-glutamine, 1% nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen), 0.1 mm β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma), 20% (v/v) FBS, and 2,000 units/ml ESGRO (Chemicon). Cells were passaged every 2 or 3 days with 0.25% trypsin, 1.0 mm EDTA solution (Invitrogen). M1 (D+) cells (provided by Cell Resource Center for Biomedical Research, Tohoku University) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS.

In brief, the E-cadherin extracellular domain cDNA, which was generated from mouse E-cadherin full-length cDNA provided by the RIKEN BRC DNA Bank (code 1184), and mutated mouse IgG1-Fc domain cDNA (T252M/T254S), which have high affinity to protein A, were ligated with pRC/CMV (Invitrogen) fragment to generate the expression vector “pRC-ECFC.” Using Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's directions, CHO-K1 cells were transfected with pRC-ECFC. After selection of a highly expressing clone (4G7) with 400 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen), conditioned media were collected. To construct LIF-Fc, the cDNA that encodes mouse LIF was amplified with KOD plus DNA polymerase (TOYOBO) from the cDNA of mouse embryonic fibroblasts. The specific primer pair for mouse LIF was used for amplification: 5′-AAG CTT CAT AAT GAA GGT CTT GGC CG-3′ and 5′-GCG GCC GCT GAA GGC CTG GAC CAC CAC AC-3′; the underlining represents the HindIII and NotI recognition sites, respectively. To generate pRC-LIF-Fc vector, pGEM-T easy vector (Pro-mega) containing mouse LIF cDNA was digested by HindIII and NotI and subcloned into pRC/CMV vector containing mutated mouse Fc fragment cDNA (16Nagaoka M. Akaike T. Protein Eng. 2003; 16: 243-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). CHO-K1 cells were transfected with pRC-LIF-Fc vector, and a highly expressing clone was selected as mentioned above. The fusion proteins were loaded onto a rProtein A FF column (GE Healthcare). The column was washed with 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), and the bound proteins were eluted using 0.1 m sodium citrate (pH 2.7) followed by neutralization with a 1/5 volume of 1.0 m Tris-HCl (pH 9.0). Eluates were dialyzed for 3 days in PBS containing 0.9 mm CaCl2 and 0.9 mm MgCl2. To prepare the coated surface with E-cad-Fc and/or LIF-Fc, purified E-cad-Fc and LIF-Fc solution was directly added to nontreated polystyrene plates at the indicated concentration. After 2 h of incubation at 37 °C, plates were washed with PBS once, and then cells were seeded. Western Blot Analysis—The total cellular protein was extracted with lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P40, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, and proteinase inhibitors), and cell lysates were centrifuged at 17,860 × g for 15 min. Protein concentration of the supernatant was measured using a DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad), and samples were separated by electrophoresis on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels and electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P; Millipore). Blots were probed with anti-murine LIF antibody (Chemicon), anti-STAT3 antibody (BD Biosciences), anti-phospho-STAT3 (Tyr-705) antibody (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-p44/42 MAPK antibody (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-LIF receptor antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-gp130 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Thr-202/Tyr-204) antibody (Cell Signaling Technology), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, and developed by ECL reagent (GE Healthcare) or Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent horseradish peroxidase substrate (Millipore). Definition of LIF-Fc Activity—To determine the specific activity of purified LIF-Fc, we analyzed the ability to induce the differentiation of M1 cells (17Metcalf D. Hilton D.J. Nicola N.A. Leukemia (Basingstoke). 1988; 2: 216-221PubMed Google Scholar). M1 cells were suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with a final concentration of 20% FBS, 0.3% agar (Dojindo Molecular Technologies) and LIF samples, and then they were seeded into 24-well plates at the concentration of 75 cells/well. ESGRO (Chemicon) was used as a control to determine LIF activity. Cultures were incubated for 10 days in a fully humidified atmosphere at 5% CO2. Cultures were scored using a microscope at ×40 magnification, scoring as differentiated any colonies with a corona of dispersed cells or composed wholly of dispersed cells. A standard of 50 units was defined as the concentration that induces the differentiation of 50% of M1 colonies. Characterization of Immobilized Proteins—Following the manufacturer's instructions, purified LIF-Fc was labeled with HiLyte Fluor™ 555 labeling kit-NH2 (excitation, 555 nm; emission, 570 nm; Dojindo). Labeled LIF-Fc (555-LIF-Fc) solution was diluted 1:10 with native LIF-Fc solution when the concentration of total LIF-Fc was greater than 1.0 μg/ml, so that the fluorescence intensity is a linear function of labeled protein concentration. 555-LIF-Fc, native LIF-Fc, and E-cad-Fc were diluted with PBS to the designated concentration, and then 50 μl of mixtures were added to 96-well polystyrene plates. After 2 h of incubation at 37 °C, the fluorescence intensity of nonadsorbed fraction was measured with microplate reader (excitation, 535 nm; emission, 595 nm). The amount of immobilized LIF-Fc was estimated from a calibration curve prepared with 555-LIF-Fc and native LIF-Fc. Adhesion and Growth Assays—Cells were seeded at a density of 3.0 × 104 cells/well into 96-well plates precoated with the indicated substrate. After 4 h of culture, medium and nonadherent cells were removed, and cells were washed with the culture medium. Adherent cells were stained with Alamar Blue reagent (BIOSOURCE), and absorbance at 570 nm was measured using a microplate reader. For the cell growth assay, cells were seeded at a density of 500 cells/well into a 96-well plate coated with the indicated substrate. The cell number was evaluated at 5 days after seeding. ELISA—The amount of remaining LIF-Fc after the cultivation of ES cells was analyzed by ELISA method. ES cells were seeded onto the surface coated with E-cad-Fc and LIF-Fc and cultured for 3 days. To remove the adhered ES cells, we incubated them in a 2 mm EDTA/PBS solution for 30 min at 37 °C. After washing three times with PBS, plates were incubated for 16 h with 1.0% bovine serum albumin (BSA)/PBS solution to block unspecific interaction. The remaining LIF-Fc was detected after incubation with an anti-murine LIF antibody for 2 h, followed by peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h. We used 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) as a substrate for peroxidase, and we measured the absorbance at 450 nm. The amount of adsorbed LIF-Fc onto the gelatinized or E-cad-Fc-coated surface was also analyzed by ELISA. The media containing 1,000 units/ml LIF or LIF-Fc were added to the gelatinized or E-cad-Fc-coated surface. After 3 days of incubation at 37 °C, the amount of nonadsorbed LIF or LIF-Fc in the supernatant was analyzed by Quatikine Mouse LIF immunoassay kit (R & D Systems). The amount of adsorbed LIF or LIF-Fc was measured by the same method as mentioned above. ALP Staining and Immunofluorescence—Alkaline phosphatase activity was determined using a Sigma Diagnostics alkaline phosphatase (ALP) kit (Sigma). For immunofluorescence staining, cells were fixed with 8% formaldehyde solution (pH 7.0–7.5; Wako Pure Chemical) for 10 min and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 2 min at room temperature. Fixed cells were incubated with Image-iT FX signal enhancer (Invitrogen) for 30 min at room temperature. Oct-3/4 was stained with an anti-mouse Oct-3/4 polyclonal antibody (H-134; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h followed by an Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated secondary antibody (Invitrogen) for 1 h. Nuclei were counterstained with 0.5 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Samples were observed by fluorescence microscopy. The ratio of Oct-3/4-positive cells was calculated by ImageJ software. RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). The first strand cDNA was synthesized using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), and PCR was carried out with rTaq polymerase (TOYOBO) in the reaction buffer containing 1.5 mm MgCl2. Primers used are listed in Table 1. PCR products were analyzed by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis.TABLE 1PCR primers used in this studyGene (Unigene symbol)5′ primer (5′ to 3′)3′ primer (5′ to 3′)Product lengthAnnealing temperatureCycle no.bp°COct-3/4 (Mm.17031)GAAGTTGGAAAGGTGGAACCGCCTCATACCTTCTCCGTTGG5286020TCTTTCCACAGGCCCCCGGCTCTGCGGGCGGCATGGGGAGATCC2246020Zfp42/Rex-1 (Mm.285848)AAAGTGAGATAGCCCCGAGTCCCATCCCTTCAATAGCA9306020ACGAGTGGCGTTTCTTCTTGGGATATGACTCATTCCAGGGGGCACT2876020Nanog (Mm.6047)GAGGAAGCACGAATTCTGGAAGTTATGGGCGGAGCAGC7106020GCGGCTCACTCCTTCTGACTTGACCAGGAAACCCACACTCAT1636020Wnt3 (Mm.159091)TAGAGCTAGCTCCGGGCGATGATTGCCTTAACAAGACCACGAAA2976220Actcl (Mm.686)CCAGATCATTTTGAGACCTTCAAGAACATTATAGTTACACCATCGC1245930Nkx2.5 (Mm.41974)GAGCCTACGTGACCCTGACCCAGTGACCTGCGGGACGTGAGCTTCA2646030Gata4 (Mm.247669)CTGGAGGCGGATGGGACGGGACACTACCCGCAGGCATACATACAGGCTCACC2076224α-Fetoprotein (Mm.358570)TCGTATTCCACAGGAGGAGGCTTTTGTTCACCAG1735530Bmp2 (Mm.103205)GGGACCCGCGTCTTCTAGTGTTGCTGAGTGCCTCGGTACAGATCTAGCA2496030Polr2a (Mm.16533)CTGATGCGGTGCTGAGTGAGAAGGGCGGTTGACCCATGACGAGTG2376024Gapdh (Mm.333399)CTCATGACCCAGTCCATGCCTCTTGCTCGTGTCCTTGC5326020 Open table in a new tab Tetraploid Aggregation—Embryos were generated from ES cells by aggregating them with four-cell stage tetraploid CD-1 embryos generated by electrofusion as described previously (18Duncan S.A. Nagy A. Chan W. Development (Camb.). 1997; 124: 279-287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Nagy A. Gocza E. Diaz E.M. Prideaux V.R. Ivanyi E. Markkula M. Rossant J. Development (Camb.). 1990; 110: 815-821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ES cell:embryo aggregates were cultured overnight, and those that formed blastocysts were transferred to the uteri of pseudo-pregnant females surrogate mothers. Embryos were allowed to develop in utero before harvesting for analysis. The Animal Care Committee of the Medical College of Wisconsin approved all animal procedures used in this study. Construction, Purification, and Characterization of LIF-Fc—CHO-K1 cells were transfected with an expression vector for LIF-Fc (Fig. 1A), and G418-resistant clones were selected. A highly expressing clone was selected by ELISA (data not shown). LIF-Fc was purified from the conditioned media of the selected clone and analyzed by Western blotting. Under reduced conditions, the LIF-Fc was detected as an ∼75-kDa single band that was recognized by both anti-LIF antibody and anti-mouse IgG antibody (Fig. 1B). Under nonreduced conditions, LIF-Fc gave rise to an ∼150-kDa single band, indicating that LIF-Fc forms the homodimers (Fig. 1C). Analysis of LIF-Fc Activity—The activity of purified LIF-Fc was defined as an ability to induce differentiation of M1 cells (Fig. 2, A and B). LIF-Fc induced the differentiation of M1 cells in a dose-dependent manner, and the specific activity of LIF-Fc was estimated as described under “Experimental Procedures” (in this case 5,074 units/μg). The activity of LIF-Fc was also evaluated by the ability to activate the STAT3 and MAPK signaling pathways in mouse ES cells. As shown in Fig. 2C, LIF-Fc also activated these pathways, similar to the activation induced by recombinant LIF (ESGRO). ALP activity is a marker of the undifferentiated state of ES cells. The ability of LIF-Fc to maintain the undifferentiated state of mouse ES cells was analyzed by ALP activity. Mouse ES cells maintained ALP activity by LIF-Fc supplementation (Fig. 2D), indicating that LIF-Fc could retain the original activity of LIF, even though LIF is conjugated with the Fc domain of IgG and forms homodimers. Adsorption of LIF-Fc on Polystyrene Surface and Effect of an Immobilized LIF-Fc on ES Cells—First, the amount of LIF-Fc adsorption onto a polystyrene surface was estimated by measuring the fluorescence intensity of 555-LIF-Fc. Adsorption of LIF-Fc to the polystyrene surface increased in a dose-dependent manner, and the curve could be approximated to Langmuir's adsorption isotherm (Fig. 3, A and B). The amount of immobilized LIF-Fc onto polystyrene surface was estimated as about 67 ± 15% of initial amount. Next, we tested the effect of immobilized LIF-Fc on ES cell culture. EB3 cells adhered to the LIF-Fc-coated surface but not to the surface coated with mouse IgG (Fig. 3C), indicating that cell adhesion is mediated by immobilized LIF-Fc not by the Fc region. In addition, to clarify the effect of the Fc region on the stable adsorption of LIF-Fc protein, we directly coated native LIF to the polystyrene surface. ES cells did not adhere to the surface coated with native LIF; therefore, the Fc region is essential for the stable adsorption of LIF, and LIF-Fc could act as a substrate for adhesion of ES cells. On the LIF-Fc-coated surface, ES cells formed tightly aggregated colonies (Fig. 3F); similar morphology is observed on the conventional gelatin-coated surface. To ascertain whether ES cells maintain their undifferentiated phenotypes on immobilized LIF-Fc, we examined the activity of STAT3 and MAPK. STAT3 was activated on the LIF-Fc immobilized surface at the same level as on the gelatinized surface with LIF, and the activation of STAT3 was sustained to 24 h. The activation of MAPK on the LIF-Fc-coated surface was slightly higher than on a conventional gelatinized surface with LIF supplementation (Fig. 3D). When activated by soluble ligands, many cytokine receptors are usually incorporated into cells to control the strength and period of signals. The LIF receptor is also internalized and down-regulated (20Blanchard F. Duplomb L. Wang Y. Robledo O. Kinzie E. Pitard V. Godard A. Jacques Y. Baumann H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28793-287801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Within 3 h after stimulation, the protein level of the LIF receptor was decreased by the stimulation of soluble LIF, although there were no differences on the level of gp130 as described previously (Fig. 3E) (20Blanchard F. Duplomb L. Wang Y. Robledo O. Kinzie E. Pitard V. Godard A. Jacques Y. Baumann H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28793-287801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). On the other hand, immobilized LIF-Fc had no effect on the incorporation of the LIF receptor, indicating that immobilized LIF would not be incorporated into the cells. Furthermore, ES cells grown on the LIF-Fc-coated dishes formed aggregated colonies (Fig. 3F) and showed high ALP activity (Fig. 3G). These results indicate that ES cells could maintain their undifferentiated phenotypes on a LIF-Fc-coated surface. Maintenance of ES Cell Features on the Co-immobilized Surface of LIF-Fc and E-cad-Fc—We demonstrated that ES cells could maintain their undifferentiated phenotypes on a LIF-Fc-coated surface without additional LIF supplementation; however, they still form tight aggregated colonies. Furthermore, their adhesion to LIF-Fc was not strong; therefore, they could easily detach from the surface and form floating cell aggregates, like embryoid bodies (data not shown). Several reports suggested that aggregation would induce heterogeneous signals depending on the position of cells (21Cui L. Johkura K. Yue F. Ogiwara N. Okouchi Y. Asanuma K. Sasaki K. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2004; 52: 1447-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 22Davey R.E. Zandstra P.W. Stem Cells. 2006; 24: 2538-2548Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 23Singh A.M. Hamazaki T. Hankowski K.E. Terada N. Stem Cells. 2007; 25: 2534-2542Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). To clear these problems, we used the co-immobilized surface coated with LIF-Fc and the fusion protein of E-cadherin and Fc fragment (E-cad-Fc) that could maintain ES cells without colony formation (11Nagaoka M. Koshimizu U. Yuasa S. Hattori F. Chen H. Tanaka T. Okabe M. Fukuda K. Akaike T. PLoS ONE. 2006; 1: e15Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). First, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” the amount of LIF-Fc at the co-immobilizing condition was estimated. The amount of adsorbed LIF-Fc reached a plateau at the same concentration of E-cad-Fc (0.25 μg) and gradually increased at the higher concentration than the concentration of E-cad-Fc (Fig. 4, A and B). This indicated that LIF-Fc and E-cad-Fc competitively adsorb to a polystyrene surface. The optimal amount for coating was estimated from these data. Next, we checked the stability of the immobilized LIF-Fc during cell culture. After ES cells were cultured on LIF-Fc- and E-cad-Fc-coated surface for 3 days, the amount of remaining and detached LIF-Fc was analyzed by the ELISA. There were no significant decreases in the amount of immobilized LIF-Fc (Table 2), and LIF-Fc was not detected in the conditioned media of ES cells (data not shown), indicating that LIF-Fc is not incorporated by cells but stably immobilized on a polystyrene surface. Furthermore, there was no significant adsorption of LIF-Fc onto a gelatinized or E-cad-Fc-coated surface (Fig. 4C); therefore, we used a soluble LIF-Fc for the following experiments.TABLE 2The amount of remaining LIF-Fc after cultivation for 3 days with/without ES cellsAmount of LIF-Fc1.684.198.3812.616.81.68 ng/well% remaining LIF-Fc (without cells)137 ± 65121 ± 27104 ± 2093 ± 9.594 ± 7.7% remaining LIF-Fc (with cells)143 ± 56126 ± 25104 ± 24104 ± 17106 ± 10 Open table in a new tab The adhesion of ES cells onto the co-immobilized surface was not affected by the concentration of LIF-Fc (Fig. 4D), and the cells showed scattering morphology similar to those on the surface coated with E-cad-Fc (Fig. 4E). These results indicate that at the concentration indicated, ES cells stably adhere onto the co-immobilized surface by E-cadherin-mediated adhesion and that a homogeneous environment could be achieved by this system. Furthermore, depending on the concentration of immobilized LIF-Fc, the ES cells showed higher proliferation ability on a co-immobilized surface than on a gelatinized surface (Fig. 4F). The activation of LIF signaling was sustained on the co-immobilized surface even at the low amount of immobilized LIF-Fc (Fig. 4G, 5 units/well). These results also indicate that LIF-Fc is stably immobilized and possesses the ability to induce LIF signaling. We next examined the ability to maintain undifferentiated phenotypes on a co-immobilized surface. The expression of Oct-3/4 (24Niwa H. Miyazaki J. Smith A.G. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 372-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (2926) Google Scholar), Rex-1 (25Rogers M.B. Hosler B.A. Gudas L.J. Development (Camb.). 1991; 113: 815-824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Nanog (26Mitsui K. Tokuzawa Y. Itoh H. Segawa K. Murakami M. Takahashi K. Maruyama M. Maeda M. Yamanaka S. Cell. 2003; 113: 631-642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2604) Google Scholar, 27Chambers I. Colby D. Robertson M. Nichols J. Lee S. Tweedie S. Smith A. Cell. 2003; 113: 643-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2678) Google Scholar) genes was maintained in a dose-dependent manner of immobilized LIF-Fc without additional LIF supplementation, and the expression of the genes was retained for at least 15 days. The expression of these genes diminished upon LIF withdrawal (Fig. 5A). Immunostaining also showed that ES cells cultured on co-immobilized dishes with LIF-Fc and E-cad-Fc for 5 days expressed Oct-3/4 in the nucleus, whereas depletion of LIF led to a marked reduction in Oct-3/4 staining (Fig. 5B). These results indicate that a co-immobilized surface of E-cad-Fc and LIF-Fc did effectively maintain the undifferentiated phenotype of ES cells. Furthermore, we tried to apply our culture system to feeder-dependent ES cells. Jxl1 and R1 cells, which are cultured on feeder cells, were seeded on the gelatinized plate or on the co-immobilized surface of E-cad-Fc and LIF-Fc. After culturing for 5 days, the ratio of Oct-3/4-positive cells was calculated. Most of cells cultured on the co-immobilized surface retained the expression of Oct-3/4 (Fig. 5C). We also checked whether the multidifferentiating potency of ES cells is affected by culturing on a co-immobilized surface. To assess the potential of ES cells to differentiate into multiple cell lineages, embryoid bodies were generated from ES cells that had been cultured for 10 passages on the co-immobilized surface. These embryoid bodies were cultured for an additional 11 days without LIF to induce differentiation. The level of expression of lineage-specific marker genes was analyzed by RT-PCR. Similar to results using the conventional culture methods, embryoid bodies derived from co-immobilized surfaces developed into ectoderm (Wnt3), mesoderm (Actc1 and Nkx2.5), and endoderm (Gata4, α-Fetoprotein, and Bmp2) derivatives (Fig. 5D). Finally, we confirmed the pluripotent ability of ES cells cultured on co-immobilized surface with E-cad-Fc and LIF-Fc by tetraploid aggregation. ES cells were directly transferred to our system from culture on feeder cells. After 10 passages with one freeze/thaw cycle, ES cells were aggregated with four-cell stage CD-1 tetraploid embryos and transferred to pseudo-pregnant mice. ES cell-derived embryos were recovered at E9.5. These results demonstrate that without LIF supplementation, the coimmobilized surface with LIF-Fc and E-cad-Fc can maintain the undifferentiated state and pluripotency of ES cells, even though the quite different morphology was compared with the conventional culture systems. In this study, we applied two immobilizable model proteins, E-cad-Fc and LIF-Fc, to establish a new culture system of mouse ES cells, and we demonstrated that mouse ES cells can be effectively maintained on a co-immobilized surface with the model proteins. Furthermore, we found that LIF-Fc is not adsorbed onto the E-cad-Fc-coated surface (Fig. 4C) even though LIF-Fc has an Fc region. This result indicates that the surface would be occupied by the initial adsorption of E-cad-Fc, which would prevent the further adsorption of LIF-Fc. Therefore, the preparation of the mixed solution should be important for the co-immobilization of model proteins. When cultured on the surface coated only with LIF-Fc, mouse ES cells still form aggregated colonies, and the adhesion of cells is weak, even though the cells can maintain undifferentiated phenotypes (Fig. 3). When ES cells form colonies, the signaling from LIF is needed to reach the center of the colonies to maintain an undifferentiated state of ES cells. The soluble LIF might diffuse into the colonies; however, immobilized LIF cannot interact with the inside cells. To explain this issue, we suggest the following hypotheses. 1) LIF-Fc is detached from the surface, and 2) the factors secreted from ES cells by LIF stimulation contribute to maintain the undifferentiated state of ES cells. We analyzed the stability of immobilized LIF-Fc by ELISA and obtained the data that the amount of LIF-Fc did not change after cultivation of ES cells (Table 2). In addition, immobilized LIF-Fc prevented the incorporation of the LIF receptor (Fig. 3E). These results indicate that LIF-Fc was stably immobilized but not incorporated into cells. Furthermore, similar studies suggest that chemically immobilized LIF can be effective for maintenance of murine ES cells (28Makino H. Hasuda H. Ito Y. J. Biosci. Bioeng. 2004; 98: 374-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 29Cetinkaya G. Turkoglu H. Arat S. Odaman H. Onur M.A. Gumusderelioglu M. Tumer A. J. Biomed. Mater.

Meth. 2008; 5: 645-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), although the cells also formed aggregated colonies. Because covalent binding is more stable than hydrophobic interaction of LIF-Fc and cannot be digested by enzymatic activity of cells, the results also indicate the possibility of another pathway that transduces the LIF signals into the inside of the colonies. In addition, several studies suggest that colony formation induces the heterogeneous distribution of mouse ES cells (21Cui L. Johkura K. Yue F. Ogiwara N. Okouchi Y. Asanuma K. Sasaki K. J.

Yang J. Bosse M. Lajoie G. Bhatia M. Nature. 2007; 448: 1015-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Singh et al. (23Singh A.M. Hamazaki T. Hankowski K.E. Terada N. Stem Cells. 2007; 25: 2534-2542Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) reported that the heterogeneous expression of Nanog and SSEA-1 is induced when ES cells are maintained in the colony-forming condition, and that the cells expressing a low level of Nanog express primitive endodermal marker genes. Furthermore, Davey and Zandstra (22Davey R.E. Zandstra P.W. Stem Cells. 2006; 24: 2538-2548Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) suggested that autocrine non-LIF ligands of gp130 transduce the signaling for maintenance of an undifferentiated state of mouse ES cells, and they also suggested the heterogeneity of autocrine signals. Recently, a number of new culture methods for human ES cells have been developed that do not require feeder cells or serum to reduce the risk of pathogens (33Xu C. Inokuma M.S. Denham J. Golds K.

Stem Cells. 2005; 23: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). In these culture methods, the undifferentiated human ES cells still form aggregates, and the aggregated colonies are reported to induce heterogeneity of cells (31Stewart M.H. Bosse M. Chadwick K. Menendez P. Bendall S.C. Bhatia M. Nat. Meth. 2006; 3: 807-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 32Bendall S.C. Stewart M.H. Menendez P. George D. Vijayaragavan K. Werbowetski-Ogilvie T.

From these findings, we propose that the close contact between cells in these aggregates may lead to paracrine or autocrine interactions that could generate heterogeneity. Therefore, our system could improve the culture methods of mouse ES cells by maintaining them in homogeneous conditions. We also found that a reduced amount of LIF was required for maintenance of mouse ES cells on a LIF-immobilized surface. Although we did not compare the actual amount of LIF interacting with cells, our results indicate that the immobilization of LIF is more effective in maintaining ES cells than is possible using soluble forms. We previously reported that ES cells maintained as a single cell require less amounts of LIF (11Nagaoka M. Koshimizu U. Yuasa S. Hattori F. Chen H. Tanaka T. Okabe M. Fukuda K. Akaike T. PLoS ONE. 2006; 1: e15Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Therefore, a co-immobilized surface is an efficient system to maintain ES cell properties. In conclusion, we demonstrated that the culture surface coated with LIF-Fc can be useful to maintain the undifferentiated state of mouse ES cells, and that ES cells cultured without any additional LIF supplementation on the co-immobilized surface with E-cad-Fc and LIF-Fc could be maintained as single cells with complete ES cell features. Moreover, the new culture system can maintain ES cells in the homogeneous culture condition to eliminate the risk of unexpected differentiation, and this system is beneficial for single cell-based assay of signaling pathways and cell responses induced by immobilized growth factors.

https://openalex.org/W2095236477,"We recently found that the spontaneous integration of M13 procoat is blocked by diacylglycerol (DAG) (Nishiyama, K., Ikegami, A., Moser, M., Schiltz, E., Tokuda, H., and Muller, M. (2006) J. Biol. Chem. 281, 35667–35676). Here, we demonstrate that the spontaneous integration of Pf3 coat, another membrane protein that has been thought to be integrated spontaneously into liposomes, can be blocked by DAG at physiological concentrations. Moreover, the spontaneous integration of the membrane potential-independent version of Pf3 coat (3L-Pf3 coat), which is independent of YidC, was also blocked by DAG. To clarify the mechanism by which DAG blocks spontaneous integration, we examined lipid compounds similar to DAG and DAG derivatives. The blockage of spontaneous integration was specific to DAG, as fatty acids, monoacylglycerol, and phosphatidic acids were not effective for the blockage. When the acyl chains in DAG were shortened even to octanoyl residues, it still blocked spontaneous integration, whereas diheptanoylglycerol did not block it at all. Triacylglycerol was more effective than DAG. However, the lipid A-derivative-dependent integration of M13 procoat could not be reconstituted when triacylglycerol was included in the liposomes. On the other hand, when DAG was included in the liposomes, we found that the integration of 3L-Pf3 coat was strictly dependent on the lipid A-derived integration factor. We propose that the bulky structure of DAG rather than changes in membrane curvature is essential for the blockage of spontaneous integration. We also demonstrated that the blockage of spontaneous integration by DAG is also operative in native membrane vesicles. We recently found that the spontaneous integration of M13 procoat is blocked by diacylglycerol (DAG) (Nishiyama, K., Ikegami, A., Moser, M., Schiltz, E., Tokuda, H., and Muller, M. (2006) J. Biol.

We also demonstrated that the blockage of spontaneous integration by DAG is also operative in native membrane vesicles. Integral membrane proteins in Escherichia coli are integrated into the cytoplasmic membrane through defined steps. Many membrane proteins are cotranslationally targeted to membranes with the help of the signal recognition particle (SRP) 2The abbreviations used are:SRPsignal recognition particleDAGdiacylglycerolINVinverted and inner membrane vesicleDCCDN,N-dicyclohexylcarbodiimidePMFproton motive forceFAfatty acidMAGmonoacylglycerolTAGtriacylglycerolPAphosphatidic acid. 2The abbreviations used are:SRPsignal recognition particleDAGdiacylglycerolINVinverted and inner membrane vesicleDCCDN,N-dicyclohexylcarbodiimidePMFproton motive forceFAfatty acidMAGmonoacylglycerolTAGtriacylglycerolPAphosphatidic acid./SRP receptor system followed by membrane integration at the SecYEG site (for a review, see Ref. 1Luirink J. von Heijne G. Houben E. de Gier J.W. Annu Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 59: 329-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Several membrane proteins, such as M13 procoat, Pf3 coat, CyoA, and F0 c subunit, are integrated independently of both SRP and SecYEG, as these proteins are integrated into Sec- or SRP-deficient membranes (2Rohrer J.

YidC, a homologue of mitochondrial Oxa1p and Alb3p in chloroplasts, is thought to be involved in the integration of such SecYEG-independent proteins, as YidC depletion caused the accumulation of the precursor form of M13 procoat (9Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Moller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). On the other hand, M13 procoat can be efficiently integrated into liposomes composed of polar phospholipids even in the absence of a membrane potential (7Geller B.L. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13281-13285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and therefore, these proteins have long been thought to be integrated “spontaneously.” Although the YidC-dependent integration of Pf3 coat (10Serek J. Bauer-Manz G. Struhalla G. van den Berg L. Kiefer D. Dalbey R. Kuhn A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 294-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and F0 c subunit (11van der Laan M. Bechtluft P. Kol S.

Indeed, the integration of a potential-independent version of Pf3 coat, 3L-Pf3 coat, was reported to occur into liposomes free of YidC, suggesting that the spontaneous mechanism of membrane protein integrations was still operative (10Serek J. Bauer-Manz G. Struhalla G. van den Berg L. Kiefer D. Dalbey R. Kuhn A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 294-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In in vivo studies, it has been shown that integration of both M13 procoat and Pf3 coat is strongly dependent on YidC (9Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Moller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 13Chen M. Samuelson J.C. Jiang F. Muller M. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol.

On the other hand, the generation of a proton motive force is severely impaired by YidC depletion (3van der Laan M. Urbanus M.L. Ten Hagen-Jongman C.M. Nouwen N. Oudega B. Harms N. Driessen A.J. Luirink J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5801-5806Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), which should inhibit the integration of these potential-dependent proteins. Moreover, M13 procoat is resistant to alkaline extraction even after YidC depletion (14Samuelson J.C. Jiang F. Yi L. Chen M. de Gier J.W. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34847-34852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), indicating that even the potential-dependent protein is integrated into membranes in a YidC-independent manner.

We have been studying the mechanisms underlying the membrane integration of MtlA, which possesses 6–8 predicted transmembrane regions (15Sugiyama J.E. Mahmoodian S. Jacobson G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9603-9607Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 16Vervoort E.B. Bultema J.B. Schuurman-Wolters G.K. Geertsma E.R. Broos J. Poolman B. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 733-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). MtlA integration is absolutely dependent on both the SRP system and SecYEG (17Koch H.G. Muller M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 18Koch H.G. Hengelage T. Neumann-Haefelin C. MacFarlane J. Hoffschulte H.K. Schimz K.L. Mechler B. Muller M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2163-2173Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). On the contrary, we found that MtlA is spontaneously integrated into liposomes in the complete absence of SecYEG (19Nishiyama K. Ikegami A. Moser M. Schiltz E. Tokuda H. Muller M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35667-35676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), similarly to Sec-independent substrates. Therefore, such spontaneous integration of MtlA could only be an in vitro artifact. We further found that MtlA integration into liposomes could be reduced and blocked by including diacylglycerol (DAG) in liposomes at a physiological concentration (19Nishiyama K. Ikegami A. Moser M. Schiltz E. Tokuda H. Muller M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35667-35676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and this finding enabled us to reconstitute MtlA integration in a SecYEG-dependent manner. Moreover, using this reconstitution system, we found a lipid A-derived integration stimulating factor that is involved in the integration of both MtlA and M13 procoat (19Nishiyama K. Ikegami A. Moser M. Schiltz E. Tokuda H. Muller M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35667-35676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In this study we examined the effects of chemically synthesized lipids on the blockage of spontaneous integration, as we previously used DAG enzymatically prepared from an E. coli extract of polar phospholipids. We found that the spontaneous integration, including that of potential-independent 3L-Pf3 coat, was indeed blocked specifically by DAG at the concentration close to the in vivo conditions. Moreover, we found that in the presence of DAG, 3L-Pf3 coat integration was dependent on the lipid A-derived integration-stimulating factor.

YK01 (MC4100 ΔeptB::kan), YK02 (MC4100 ΔmdoB::kan), and YK03 (MC4100 ΔpgpB::kan) were constructed by P1 transduction. YK2301 (MC4100 ΔeptB::kan ΔmdoB ΔpgpB) was constructed by repeating the removal of the kan cassette using plasmid pCP20 (22Cherepanov P.P. Wackernagel W.

A pair of primers dgkfor (AA GAT CTT AGG AGG TTT AAA TTT ATG GCC AAT AAT ACC ACT) and dgkrev (G GTC GAC TTA TCC AAA ATG CGA CCA TA) was used to PCR amplify the dgkA gene with the MC4100 chromosome as a template. The restriction sites of BglII and SalI, attached to both ends, respectively, are shown in italics. Underlined indicate the initiation and termination codons, respectively. The dgkA gene fragment, thus, created was cloned into pUSI2 (24Shibui T. Uchida M. Teranishi Y. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1988; 52: 983-988Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar) which had been digested with BglII and SalI. Materials—INVs were prepared from E. coli MC4100 or JS7131 (ΔyidC) as described (25Alami M. Trescher D. Wu L.F. Muller M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20499-20503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To deplete YidC from JS7131 cells, they were grown in the presence of 0.2% arabinose and washed with fresh LB medium three times and then grown in the presence of 0.2% glucose until cell growth stopped. The depletion of YidC was confirmed by immunoblotting. The E. coli extract of polar phospholipids, 1,2-dibutyroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, 1,2-divaleroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, 1,2-dihexanoyol-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, 1,2-diheptanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, 1,2-dilauroyl-sn-glycerol, 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycerol, and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc.

Creatine phosphate, creatine kinase, and proteinase K were from Roche Diagnostics. 1,2-Dibutyroyl-sn-glycerol, 1,2-divaleroyl-sn-glycerol, 1,2-dihexanoyol-sn-glycerol, and 1,2-diheptanoyl-sn-glycerol were prepared by enzymatically digesting phosphatidylcholine with the corresponding acyl residues. Briefly, phosphatidylcholine was treated with phospholipase C (100 units/ml) in 50 mm triethanolamine (pH 7.5), 2 mm CaCl2 for 1 h at 37 °C followed by extraction with chloroform/methanol (2:1), as described (19Nishiyama K.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6299-6306Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), respectively. 3L-Pf3 coat possesses three additional Leu residues inserted into the middle of the membrane spanning region of Pf3 coat, its integration thereby being rendered independent of the membrane potential (8Kiefer D.

EMBO J. 2004; 23: 294-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Preparation of Liposomes—Liposomes containing DAG or other lipids were prepared as follows. Polar phospholipids and DAG or other lipids were mixed in chloroform and then evaporated under a stream of nitrogen gas and then under vacuum. To the dried lipid mixture, buffer A (50 mm triethanolamine acetate (pH 7.5), 1 mm dithiothreitol) was added to give a concentration of 10 mg of phospholipids/ml, and then liposomes were obtained by means of a bath sonicator. To prepare large liposomes, the dried lipid mixture suspended in buffer A as described above was frozen and thawed and then passed through the polycarbonate filter (400 nm pore size) 10 times by means of an extruder (Avanti Polar Lipids) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Reconstitution of the Integration-stimulating Factor into Proteoliposomes—Proteoliposomes containing the integration-stimulating factor were reconstituted as described (19Nishiyama K. Ikegami A. Moser M. Schiltz E. Tokuda H. Muller M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35667-35676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Briefly, the purified factor (25 μg) was mixed with polar phospholipids (0.2 mg) and 10 μg of either 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol or trioleoylglycerol in 100 μl of buffer A containing 1.5% octylglucoside. Proteoliposomes were reconstituted by dialyzing the mixture against buffer A. The proteoliposome suspension, thus obtained, was diluted with 1 ml of buffer A and then sedimented by centrifugation (170,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C). After suspending proteoliposomes in 50 μl of buffer A, they were frozen, thawed, and then sonicated (27Akimaru J. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Mizushima S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6545-6549Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). An aliquot (5 μl) was subjected to the integration assay. Integration Assay—In vitro synthesis of membrane proteins and integration reactions were essentially performed as described (19Nishiyama K. Ikegami A. Moser M. Schiltz E. Tokuda H. Muller M. J. Biol.

The in vitro protein synthesis mixture, composed of amino acids other than Met and Cys (40 μm each), 35S-labeled Met and Cys (2–5 MBq/ml), 250 μm ATP, 50 μm CTP, GTP, and UTP, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 8 mm creatine phosphate, 12 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 2.4 mm spermidine, 40 μg/ml creatine kinase, fractionated cytosolic translation factors (28Muller M.

The reaction mixtures (50 μl) were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and then divided in two parts. The first part (30 μl) was mixed with an equal volume of proteinase K (1 mg/ml) and digested for 20 min at 25 °C followed by trichloroacetic acid (5%) precipitation. The other part (15 μl) was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (5%) directly. All samples were analyzed on SDS gels (30Hussain M. Ichihara S. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3707-3712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) containing 6 m urea (19Nishiyama K. Ikegami A. Moser M. Schiltz E. Tokuda H. Muller M. J. Biol.

Determination of the DAG Content in the Cell—The overnight culture (10 μl) was inoculated in the LB medium (1 ml) containing 74 kBq/ml [14C] palmitate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) followed by cultivation at 37 °C for 3 h. Cells, recovered by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 5 min), were suspended in 50 μl of 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 1 mm EDTA. After the treatment with lysozyme (0.1 mg/ml), cells were lysed by sonication. Triton X-100 was then added to the lysate at 0.2% and incubated on ice for 10 min to solubilize membranes followed by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C). An aliquot of the supernatant (1 μl) was directly subjected to TLC analysis as described (31Rotering H. Raetz C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8068-8073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Integration of 3L-Pf3 Coat Is Independent of Both the Membrane Potential and YidC but Does Not Occur Spontaneously—To examine the effect of DAG on the blockage of spontaneous integration, we employed three types of membrane proteins that are known to be integrated into liposomes spontaneously. They are M13 H5 procoat (26Kuhn A. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15914-15918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which we used in the previous study (19Nishiyama K. Ikegami A. Moser M. Schiltz E. Tokuda H. Muller M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35667-35676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), Pf3 coat, and 3L-Pf3 coat, a potential-independent version of Pf3 coat (8Kiefer D. Kuhn A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6299-6306Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). M13 H5 procoat is integrated similarly to wild type M13 procoat, except that the signal sequence is not cleaved (32Soekarjo M. Eisenhawer M. Kuhn A. Vogel H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1232-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). As reported previously (8Kiefer D. Kuhn A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6299-6306Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 19Nishiyama K. Ikegami A. Moser M. Schiltz E. Tokuda H. Muller M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35667-35676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), all of these proteins were integrated into INVs prepared from the wild type strain (wild type INVs) efficiently (Fig. 1). In the case of M13 H5 procoat and Pf3 coat, their integration was reduced by half on the addition of DCCD to dissipate the proton motive force (PMF), confirming that the integration of these proteins is stimulated by the membrane potential, a component of PMF (Fig. 1, A and B). On the other hand, 3L-Pf3 coat integration was not reduced on the addition of DCCD (Fig. 1C), as reported (8Kiefer D. Kuhn A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6299-6306Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). When YidC-depleted INVs (ΔYidC INVs) were used, 3L-Pf3 coat integration was rather slightly increased compared with that into wild type INVs. Moreover, 3L-Pf3 coat integration into ΔYidC INVs was not affected irrespective of the presence or absence of PMF (Fig. 1C). In contrast, the integration of M13 H5 procoat and Pf3 coat into ΔYidC INVs was slightly impaired, consistent with previous reports (10Serek J. Bauer-Manz G. Struhalla G. van den Berg L. Kiefer D. Dalbey R. Kuhn A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 294-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 13Chen M. Samuelson J.C. Jiang F. Muller M. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 2006; 281: 35667-35676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thus, the integration of 3L-Pf3 coat was independent of both PMF and YidC, whereas M13 H5 procoat and Pf3 coat integration was reduced in the absence of YidC or PMF. Taken together, these results and the observation that the integration of 3L-Pf3 coat is both Sec- and SRP-independent (10Serek J. Bauer-Manz G. Struhalla G. van den Berg L. Kiefer D. Dalbey R.

We next examined the integration activities using liposomes (Fig. 1, right). When liposomes composed of polar phospholipids were used, all the membrane proteins used here were integrated more efficiently than into INVs treated with DCCD. 3L-Pf3 coat integration into liposomes was more significant than that of the other two proteins, because PMF was not imposed in liposomes. In marked contrast, when liposomes containing DAG were used, almost no integration activity for any of these proteins was observed (Fig. 1). Therefore, these proteins are not spontaneously integrated into liposomes if DAG is present, as seen for MtlA integration (19Nishiyama K. Ikegami A. Moser M. Schiltz E. Tokuda H. Muller M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35667-35676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). DAG Specifically Blocks Spontaneous Integration—We next examined whether the blockage of spontaneous integration is specific to DAG. In addition to DAG, fatty acids (FA), monoacylglycerol (MAG), or triacylglycerol (TAG) was incorporated into liposomes followed by determination of the integration activity (Fig. 2). Because the integration activity for Pf3 coat was essentially the same as that for M13 (H5) procoat (Fig. 1, A and B; data not shown), M13 H5 procoat was hereafter used as a representative potential-dependent substrate. The integration activities for both M13 H5 procoat and 3L-Pf3 coat with liposomes containing either FA or MAG were the same as those with liposomes composed of polar phospholipids only (Fig. 2). On the other hand, liposomes with TAG exhibited almost no integration activity toward either protein, as did ones with DAG (Fig. 2). Because both DAG and TAG were similarly effective for the blockage of spontaneous integration, liposomes with various amounts of DAG or TAG were prepared followed by determination of their integration activities (Fig. 3). With increasing the DAG or TAG amounts in liposomes, the integration activities for M13 H5 procoat (Fig. 3A) and 3L-Pf3 coat (Fig. 3C) decreased. Essentially, the integration of both membrane proteins was completely blocked when 3% or more DAG was included. In the case of TAG the blockage was significant even with 1% for both membrane proteins. When the integration activity was plotted as a function of the DAG or TAG amount (Fig. 3, B and D), it was found that blockage by TAG is slightly more effective than that by DAG. Although spontaneous integration is blocked by TAG efficiently, liposomes with TAG exhibit defective integrity of the bilayer structure (see Fig. 8). From these findings it was concluded that the blockage of spontaneous integration is specific to DAG.FIGURE 3Effect of the ratio of DAG or TAG in liposomes on blockage of spontaneous integration. A, M13 H5 procoat was in vitro synthesized in the presence of liposomes containing DAG or TAG at the indicated percentage. The integration efficiency was determined as described in the legend to Fig. 1. PK, proteinase K. B, the integration efficiency determined in A was plotted against the percentage of DAG (closed diamonds) or TAG(open diamonds). The integration efficiency of liposomes with less than 1% of DAG or TAG is also shown in the inset. C, 3L-Pf3 coat was in vitro synthesized in the presence of the indicated liposomes as in A. D, the efficiency of integration determined in C was plotted as in B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 83L-PF3 coat integration is dependent on the integration-stimulating factor but is deficient in TAG-containing liposomes. The integration-stimulating factor was reconstituted using liposomes containing either 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol (DAG) or trioleoylglycerol (TAG). M13 H5 procoat (A) and 3L-Pf3 coat (B) were in vitro synthesized in the presence of liposomes or proteoliposomes with the integration factor, as indicated. The integration efficiency was determined as shown in the legend to Fig. 1, as indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Mechanism Underlying the Blockage of Spontaneous Integration by DAG—To clarify what property of DAG is needed for the blockage of spontaneous integration, we examined whether various kinds of DAG or DAG derivatives have the ability to block spontaneous integration. In Fig. 4, the effect of the length of acyl chains in DAG was examined. The structures of DAG derivatives used here are shown in Fig. 4A. Liposomes containing DAG with diheptanoyl residues (C7) or shorter acyl chains exhibited the same integration activities as ones without DAG for both M13 H5 procoat (Fig. 4B) and 3L-Pf3 coat (Fig. 4C). In marked contrast, DAG with dioctanoyl residues (C8) or longer acyl chains completely blocked spontaneous integration (Fig. 4, B and C). When the integration activities were plotted as a function of the length of acyl chains (Fig. 4D), it became evident that the acyl chain of C8 is a critical length for blocking of spontaneous integration. It is known that all DAG expressed in vivo is of type 1, 2-DAG (33Raetz C.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1978; 42: 614-659Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, another form of DAG, 1, 3-DAG (Fig. 5A), was examined. We found that this form of DAG was as effective for the blockage of spontaneous integration as physiological DAG (Fig. 5, B and C), indicating that the second acyl chain attached to MAG can be at"
https://openalex.org/W2002542578,"One of the steps of a common pathway for biological energy conversion involves electron transfer between cytochrome c and cytochrome bc1. To clarify the mechanism of this reaction, we examined the structural association of those two proteins using the electron transfer-independent electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) techniques. Drawing on the differences in the continuous wave EPR spectra and saturation recoveries of spin-labeled bacterial and mitochondrial cytochromes c recorded in the absence and presence of bacterial cytochrome bc1, we have exposed a time scale of dynamic equilibrium between the bound and the free state of cytochrome c at various ionic strengths. Our data show a successive decrease of the bound cytochrome c fraction as the ionic strength increases, with a limit of ∼120 mm NaCl above which essentially no bound cytochrome c can be detected by EPR. This limit does not apply to all of the interactions of cytochrome c with cytochrome bc1 because the cytochrome bc1 enzymatic activity remained high over a much wider range of ionic strengths. We concluded that EPR monitors just the tightly bound state of the association and that an averaged lifetime of this state decreases from over 100 μs at low ionic strength to less than 400 ns at an ionic strength above 120 mm. This suggests that at physiological ionic strength, the tightly bound complex on average lasts less than the time needed for a single electron exchange between hemes c and c1, indicating that productive electron transfer requires several collisions of the two molecules. This is consistent with an early idea of diffusion-coupled reactions that link the soluble electron carriers with the membranous complexes, which, we believe, provides a robust means of regulating electron flow through these complexes. One of the steps of a common pathway for biological energy conversion involves electron transfer between cytochrome c and cytochrome bc1.

This is consistent with an early idea of diffusion-coupled reactions that link the soluble electron carriers with the membranous complexes, which, we believe, provides a robust means of regulating electron flow through these complexes. In biological energy conversion, the integrity of electron flow through the chains of redox cofactors is secured by the interactions between large membrane-embedded enzymatic complexes and small diffusible electron carriers (1Nicholls D.G. Ferguson S.J. Bioenergetics 3. Academic Press, London2002Google Scholar). These diffusible carriers shuttle the electrons between the complexes. In mitochondria, cytochrome c connects cytochrome bc1 (complex III) with cytochrome aa3 oxidase (complex IV) (2Moore G.R. Pettigrew G.W. Cytochromes C: Evolutionary, Structural and Physicochemical Aspects. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1990Crossref Google Scholar, 3Rich P.R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 1095-1105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); in chloroplasts, plastocyanin connects cytochrome b6f with photosystem I (4Haehnel W. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1984; 35: 659-693Crossref Google Scholar, 5Nelson N. Ben-Shem A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 1-12Crossref Scopus (417) Google Scholar); and in purple bacteria, cytochrome c2 connects cytochrome bc1 with the photosynthetic reaction center (6Meyer T.E. Cusanovich M.A. Photosynth. Res. 2003; 76: 111-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Often, one chain contains multiple electron carriers with overlapping functions and properties. For example, cytochrome c6 can replace plastocyanin (7Kerfeld C.A. Krogmann D.W. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 397-425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), high potential iron-sulfur protein can replace various types of bacterial cytochromes c (6Meyer T.E. Cusanovich M.A. Photosynth. Res. 2003; 76: 111-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 8Ciurli S. Musiani F. Photosynth. Res. 2005; 85: 115-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and membrane-attached cytochrome cy can fulfill the function of soluble cytochrome c2 (9Daldal F. Deshmukh M. Prince R.C. Photosynth. Res. 2003; 76: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Clearly, nature has adopted several solutions to efficiently integrate the enzymatic complexes into physiologically functional units. Despite this large diversity of electron carriers, a common pattern can be found in the architecture of the protein-protein interaction. Typically, the small electron carriers contain just one redox center asymmetrically embedded within the protein so that it faces closely one side of the molecule. This side acts as the docking site and comes into close contacts with the docking site of the membranous complex (i.e. that portion of its surface where the other redox center is partially exposed) (10Axelrod H.L. Okamura M.L. Photosynth. Res. 2005; 85: 101-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 11Lange C. Hunte C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2800-2805Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), as shown in Fig. 1 for the interaction between soluble cytochrome c and membranous cytochrome bc1. In this way, a distance of less than 14 Å, and thereby an electron transfer at physiologically competent rates, can be achieved between the two interacting redox centers (12Moser C.C. Keske J.M. Warncke K. Farid R.M. Dutton P.L. Nature. 1992; 355: 796-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (1626) Google Scholar, 13Page C.C. Moser C.C. Chen X. Dutton P.L. Nature. 1999; 402: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1505) Google Scholar). A diffusible electron carrier alternates between the complexes using the same side in every interaction. This raises an engineering question as to how the right orientation of the two interacting redox proteins is achieved. Multistep mechanisms are usually envisaged (10Axelrod H.L. Okamura M.L. Photosynth. Res. 2005; 85: 101-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 14Harel M. Cohen M. Schreiber G. J. Mol.

The first step is a random collision that depends solely on the translational diffusion of proteins. The randomly formed complex may develop to the encounter complex, or it may dissociate (16Selzer T. Schreiber G. Proteins. 2001; 45: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The encounter complex may further evolve into the final, tightly bound complex. All of these processes may be facilitated by the long-range electrostatic attractive forces between oppositely charged residues of the docking surfaces (14Harel M. Cohen M. Schreiber G. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 371: 180-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 16Selzer T. Schreiber G. Proteins. 2001; 45: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 17Meyer T.E. Zhao Z.G.

This is quite well established for many interactions involving cytochromes c (2Moore G.R. Pettigrew G.W. Cytochromes C: Evolutionary, Structural and Physicochemical Aspects.

Axelrod H. Okamura M.Y. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5807-5815Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) but is much less certain for some other interactions (for example, those with high potential iron-sulfur protein (20Osyczka A.

Matsuura K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24108-24112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar)). Short-range hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding may also contribute to binding, especially in the final steps of association when the distance between the proteins is the shortest (11Lange C. Hunte C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2800-2805Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). We thus can appreciate many of the structural and kinetic details about the interactions between specific redox proteins (see examples in Refs. 2Moore G.R. Pettigrew G.W.

Yet, the meaning of the dynamic equilibrium between the various steps of molecular association in the context of the mechanism of electron transfer is not as well understood. Addressing this question in our experimental approach, we have used electron paramagnetic resonance techniques (28Columbus L. Hubbell W.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 288-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 29Fajer P.G. Encyclopedia of Analytical Chemistry.

Plenum Press, New York1998: 251-281Google Scholar) to examine the dynamics of structural association of cytochrome c with cytochrome bc1. We have specifically modified bacterial and mitochondrial cytochromes c with spin label at differently located positions with respect to the docking site. We then used continuous wave (CW) 2The abbreviations used are:CWcontinuous waveSRsaturation recoverySLspin labelA101C-SLcytochrome c2 labeled with SL at position 101T68C-SLcytochrome c2 labeled with SL at position 68Rba.RhodobacterTEMPOL4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl. 2The abbreviations used are:CWcontinuous waveSRsaturation recoverySLspin labelA101C-SLcytochrome c2 labeled with SL at position 101T68C-SLcytochrome c2 labeled with SL at position 68Rba.RhodobacterTEMPOL4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl. EPR and saturation recovery (SR) ERP measurements to verify an orientation of cytochrome c in its interaction with cytochrome bc1. Finally, we used CW and SR EPR to expose a time scale of dynamic equilibrium between the bound and free states of cytochrome c at various ionic strengths. The proposed estimates on the averaged lifetime of the cytochrome c-cytochrome bc1 complex shed light on the mechanisms of electron transfer between these two proteins. They imply that the reactions are diffusion-coupled under physiological conditions.

Bacterial Strains and Plasmids—Rhodobacter (Rba.) capsulatus strain pMTS1/MT-RBC1 overproduces wild type cytochrome bc1 (31Atta-Asafo-Adjei E. Daldal F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 492-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), pC-M183K/MT-RBC1 overproduces cytochrome bc1 with mutation M183K in cytochrome c1 (32Darrouzet E. Mandaci S. Li J. Qin H. Knaff D.B. Daldal F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7908-7917Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and FJ2 lacks cytochromes c2 and cy (33Jenney F.E. Daldal F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1283-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Plasmid pHM2 is a derivative of pBSII containing a copy of cycA (34Myllykallio H. Jenney F.E. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C.A. Daldal F. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2623-2631Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and pHM14 is a derivative of pRK415 containing a wild type copy of cycA (35Myllykallio H. Zannoni D. Daldal F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4348-4353Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Preparation of Single Cysteine Mutants of Cytochrome c2—Rba. capsulatus strains with mutated cytochrome c2 were generated as described previously (33Jenney F.E. Daldal F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1283-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 34Myllykallio H. Jenney F.E. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C.A. Daldal F. J.

Biophys. 1992; 292: 419-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The mutations were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange system from Stratagene and the plasmid pHM2 as the template DNA. The following mutagenic primers were used to introduce single cysteine mutations (F and R denote forward and reverse primers, respectively): 5′-GGC TTC GCC TGG TGC GAG GAA GAC ATC G-3′ (T68C-F), 5′-GTC TTC CTC GCA CCA GGC GAA GCC CGA G-3′ (T68C-R); 5′-GGC GTT CAA ACT CTG CAA GGG CGG CGA AGA CG-3′ (A101C-F), 5′-CTT CGC CGC CCT TGC AGA GTT TGA ACG CCA TG-3′ (A101C-R). After sequencing, the appropriate DNA fragments bearing the desired mutation and no other mutations were exchanged with their wild type counterparts in the expression vector pHM14 using the restriction enzymes KpnI and HindIII. The mutated variants of pHM14 were then introduced into FJ2 strain (cycA and cycY deletion background) via triparental crosses. The presence of engineered mutations was confirmed by sequencing the plasmid DNA isolated from the mutated Rba. capsulatus strains. Isolation of Cytochrome c2 and Cytochrome bc1—Cytochrome c2 was isolated from Rba. capsulatus FJ2 strain complemented with wild type or mutated pHM14 as described (37Bartsh R.G. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 23: 344-363Crossref Scopus (198) Google Scholar), except that the chloroform extraction step was omitted. Cytochrome bc1 complex was isolated from Rba. capsulatus MT-RBC1 strain complemented with wild type or mutated pMTS1 as described (38Valkova-Valchanova M.B. Saribas A.S. Gibney B.R. Dutton P.L. Daldal F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16242-16251Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The purity of isolated proteins was checked with SDS-PAGE. A concentration of cytochrome c was determined spectrophotometrically using ascorbate-reduced minus ferricyanide-oxidized spectrum and an extinction coefficient ϵ550 of 18.5 mm-1 cm-1 (39Margoliash E. Frohwirt N. Biochem. J. 1959; 71: 570-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). A concentration of cytochrome bc1 was determined from the ascorbate-reduced minus ferricyanide-oxidized spectra (for the wild type) or from the dithionite-reduced minus ferricyanide-oxidized spectra (for the M183K mutant) using an extinction coefficient ϵ551-542 nm of 20 mm-1 cm-1 (38Valkova-Valchanova M.B. Saribas A.S. Gibney B.R. Dutton P.L. Daldal F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16242-16251Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Spin Labeling of Cytochromes c—Prior to spin labeling, cytochromes c2 A101C and T68C were bound to thiopropyl-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) and eluted with 50 mm dithiothreitol. This was followed by gel filtration on Sephadex G-25 (equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl) to remove dithiothreitol. Immediately after elution of cytochrome c2, methanethiosulfonate spin label, selective toward thiol groups (40Berliner L.J. Grunwald J. Hankovszky H.O. Hideg K. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 119: 450-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), was added from acetonitrile stock to obtain a 10-fold molar excess over cytochrome c2. The sample was incubated at room temperature for 1 h and then dialyzed against 5 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4, to remove an excess of unreacted spin label. Yeast iso-1 cytochrome c (Sigma) was labeled at its native Cys-102 with methanethiosulfonate spin label using the same reaction conditions and dialysis as in the case of cytochrome c2. A monoderivative of horse heart cytochrome c (Sigma) labeled at Lys-86 with succinimidyl-2,2, 5,5-tetramethyl-3-pyrroline-1-oxyl-carboxylate was obtained as described elsewhere (41Turyna B. Osyczka A. Kostrzewa A. Blicharski W. Enghild J.J. Froncisz W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1386: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The molar ratio of the attached spin label (SL) to protein was determined by comparison of the double integrated EPR spectra of spin-labeled cytochrome c with the EPR spectrum of the TEM-POL standard. The concentration of TEMPOL was determined spectrophotometrically using an extinction coefficient, ϵ428, of 13.4 m-1 cm-1 (42Kooser R.G. Kirchman E. Matkov T. Concepts Magn. Reson. A. 1992; 4: 145-152Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The concentration of cytochrome c2 was determined spectrophotometrically as described above, and the same procedure was used for two mitochondrial cytochromes. The samples with a molar ratio of 1:1 of SL per cytochrome c molecule were used in further experiments (substoichiometrically labeled samples were discarded). Continuous Wave Measurements (CW EPR) and Analysis— Spin-labeled cytochromes c were mixed with Rba. capsulatus cytochrome bc1 in 5 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and different ionic strengths were adjusted by adding varying amount of concentrated NaCl. Final concentrations of cytochrome c and cytochrome bc1 were 20 and 40 μm, respectively. This ratio was chosen to satisfy the reported 1:2 stoichiometry of the binding of cytochrome c to cytochrome bc1 (11Lange C. Hunte C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2800-2805Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). At this ratio, the absolute concentration of labeled cytochrome c2 yields a satisfactory level of signal-to-noise with the low amount of unbound cytochrome c2 that contributes to the EPR spectra. CW EPR spectra were recorded at room temperature on a Bruker Elexsys E580 spectrometer equipped with a super high-Q resonator. Samples were measured in flat quartz cells (0.4 × 4 mm, inner diameter; VitroCom Inc.) with total active volume of 30 μl. The parameters were: microwave frequency 9.87 GHz, microwave power 19.95 milliwatts, modulation amplitude/frequency 1 G/100 kHz, sweep width 150 G, time constant 20.48 ms, sweep time 20.97 s/scan, resolution 4096 points/scan (number of scans was at least 25). The fraction of cytochrome c bound to cytochrome bc1 at a given ionic strength was calculated using the multiple linear regression method as described previously (43Sarewicz M. Szytula S. Dutka M. Osyczka A. Froncisz W. Eur. Biophys. J. 2008; 37: 483-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Briefly, the measured spectrum was linearly decomposed into two parts corresponding to the spectra of free and bound cytochrome c defined as reference. The reference spectrum of free cytochrome c was a spectrum of spin-labeled cytochrome c measured in the absence of cytochrome bc1 in 5 mm Tris, pH 7.4. The reference spectrum of bound cytochrome c was a spectrum of spin-labeled cytochrome c measured in the presence of a 2-fold molar excess of cytochrome bc1 in 5 mm Tris, pH 7.4. The latter should be considered as the spectrum of predominantly rather than fully bound cytochrome c, because it contains a contribution from the residual unbound cytochrome c. This made the bound fraction of cytochrome c slightly overestimated. Nevertheless, the concentrations of calculated free and bound cytochrome c stayed within the same order of magnitude as the true value, as described in detail elsewhere (43Sarewicz M. Szytula S. Dutka M. Osyczka A. Froncisz W. Eur. Biophys. J. 2008; 37: 483-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Saturation Recovery Measurements (SR EPR) and Analysis— Samples of spin-labeled cytochrome c with cytochrome bc1 were prepared in a manner similar to CW EPR measurements, except that higher concentrations of proteins were used (34 and 63 μm for cytochrome c and cytochrome bc1, respectively). Protein solutions were placed in a thin, gas-permeable methylpentene capillary. An oxygen-free atmosphere was obtained by flushing pure nitrogen gas through the resonator for at least 20 min before measurement. The measurements were performed on a home-made pulse spectrometer (44Ilnicki J. Koziol J. Oles T. Kostrzewa A. Galinski W. Gurbiel R.J. Froncisz W. Mol. Phys. Rep. 1995; 5: 203-207Google Scholar) operating at X-band using 1-mm loop-gap resonator (45Froncisz W. Hyde J.S. J. Magn. Reson. 1982; 47: 515-521Google Scholar). The SR curves were recorded at the central EPR line (mI = 0) using the following parameters: pumping power 0.35 milliwatt, observing power 0.03 milliwatt, pulse length 450 ns, spectrometer dead time 350 ns. SR curves were digitized with 1024 points at a rate of 50 MHz. The number of accumulations varied from 10,000 to 50,000 to obtain a satisfactory signal-to-noise ratio. All samples were measured three times, and the acquired SR curves were fitted to the single and double exponential recovery model using a nonlinear Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm implemented in the Dataplot program (Statistical Engineering Division, National Institute of Standards and Technology) (46Heckert N.A. Filliben J.J. NIST Handbook 148: DATAPLOT Reference Manual. I. National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD2003Google Scholar) or PSI-Plot, a scientific spreadsheet and technical plotting program that implements the Levenberg-Marquardt and simplex, Powell methods and can perform a global analysis for a set of recovery curves. When the exchange rate between the bound and free cytochrome c at low ionic strength condition is slower than the spin lattice relaxation rate of the most slowly relaxing component, the biexponential recovery of SR curve is observed. One component of the recovery should be characterized by the time constant equal to the spin lattice relaxation time measured for cytochrome c2 A101C in buffer in the absence of cytochrome bc1. The second time constant should be equal to the spin lattice relaxation time of fully bound cytochrome c2 to cytochrome bc1. In our case, both exchange rates (association and dissociation) are comparable with the longitudinal relaxation rates of SL attached to cytochrome c2. Thus, the relaxation time constants τ1 and τ2 and the amplitudes a and b of both exponents are functions of the intrinsic relaxation and the exchange rates. Therefore, we performed a fit to the following equation,f(t)=a·exp(-t/τ1)+b·exp(-t/τ2)+c(Eq. 1) where f(t) is signal amplitude at time t and c is the constant representing the base line of the SR curve. The calculated values of a and b depend also on the initial value of the magnetization vector after the pump pulse. The exchange rates were estimated from time constants obtained using formulas from Hansen and Led (47Hansen D.F. Led J.J. J. Magn. Reson. 2003; 163: 215-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). It should be noted that amplitudes a and b are not directly proportional to the concentration of free and bound cytochrome c. Other details on the SR EPR methodology are found in the supplemental material. Cytochrome bc1 Enzymatic Activity Measurements—Steady-state enzymatic activity was assayed by measuring the decylubiquinol-dependent reduction of cytochrome c as described previously (31Atta-Asafo-Adjei E. Daldal F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 492-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Buffer and sample conditions were: 20 μm cytochrome c, 20 μm decylubiquinol, 5 nm cytochrome bc1, and 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, containing 0.01% dodecyl maltoside. Different ionic strengths were adjusted by the addition of NaCl from a concentrated stock solution. Cytochrome c2 (Em7 = 360 mV) is predominantly reduced under ambient atmosphere. Therefore, prior to the assays, cytochrome c2 was oxidized with an excess of ferricyanide and then passed through Sephadex G-25 to remove the oxidant. Such sample was used in the activity assays. (We determined that cytochrome c2 remains oxidized at about 70% shortly after the removal of ferricyanide, a state that is stable for several hours.) Mitochondrial cytochromes c were used in the activity assays without any additional treatment. Model of the Cytochrome c2-Cytochrome bc1 Complex—The putative model of cytochrome c2 bound to cytochrome bc1 was constructed by superposition of Rba. capsulatus cytochrome bc1 structure (Protein Data Bank ID code: 1ZRT) (48Berry E.A.

The structure of Rba. capsulatus cytochrome c2 (Protein Data Bank ID code: 1C2R) (49Benning M. Wesenberg G. Caffrey M.S. Bartsh R.G. Meyer T.E. Cusanovich M.A. Rayment I. Holden H.M. J. Mol.

The single cysteine substitutions of residues 68 and 101 and the stick model of the spin label was built into the structure of cytochrome c2 using the PyMOL molecular graphics system (50DeLano W.L.

Properties of Mutated Cytochromes c2—The single cysteine substitutions T68C and A101C yield photosynthetically competent Rba. capsulatus strains (FJ2 strains complemented with mutated pHM14) producing cytochrome c2, which has a wild type spectra and electrochemical properties of high potential cytochrome c (data not shown). Cytochromes c2 modified with spin label have properties similar to the wild type cytochrome c2 when used as substrates for cytochrome bc1 in the enzymatic activity assays (supplemental Table S1). CW EPR of Spin-labeled Cytochromes c in the Absence and Presence of Cytochrome bc1—In general terms, the overall shape of the EPR spectrum of SL reflects its mobility (28Columbus L. Hubbell W.L.

In practice this means that the observable changes in the EPR spectra can often be related to the changes in the mobility of SL, which may provide useful information about the structure and dynamics of a studied system.

We previously showed that Rad54 promotes branch migration of Holliday junctions. Here we find that human Rad51 (hRad51) significantly stimulates the branch migration activity of hRad54. The stimulation appears to be evolutionarily conserved, as yeast Rad51 also stimulates the branch migration activity of yeast Rad54. We further investigated the mechanism of this stimulation. Our results demonstrate that the stimulation of hRad54-promoted branch migration by hRad51 is driven by specific protein-protein interactions, and the active form of the hRad51 filament is more stimulatory than the inactive one.

Symington L.S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2004; 38: 233-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). In humans, deficiencies in HR dramatically increase the incidents of cancer, premature aging diseases, and genome instability (2Wyman C. Ristic D. Kanaar R. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2004; 3: 827-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 3West S.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 435-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, HR is initiated at the site of DNA double-stranded breaks (Fig. 1A). Then enzymes process the broken dsDNA ends into DNA duplexes with protruding 3′-ssDNA tails. Next, Rad51 protein forms a helical nucleoprotein filament on the ssDNA tails. The filament promotes the initial steps of HR, including the search for homologous dsDNA and DNA strand exchange, which lead to formation of D-loops, a key intermediate of HR. D-loops provide both the template and the primer for DNA polymerase to retrieve the information lost at the site of DNA breaks and create an overhang required for annealing of the broken DNA ends (4Radding C.M. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 358-360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 5Sung P. Krejci L. Van Komen S. Sehorn M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42729-42732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). After primer extension, D-loops are processed further through one of the two principal mechanisms (Fig. 1B). In the first mechanism, synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA), D-loops dissociate from the intact chromosome followed by re-joining of DNA ends. In the second mechanism, double strand break repair (DSBR), D-loops are processed through the capture of the second processed DNA end to produce double Holliday junctions, which are later resolved by structure-specific endonucleases (6Pâques F. Haber J.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 349-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Rad54 plays an important role in HR. The Rad54 protein is a member of the Swi2/Snf2 family of DNA-dependent ATPases that are known for their chromatin remodeling activity (7Thoma N.H. Czyzewski B.K.

Biol. 2007; 14: 397-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In addition, Rad54 has a number of activities that are involved in different stages of HR (12Heyer W.D. Li X. Rolfsmeier M. Zhang X.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4115-4125Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 13Tan T.L. Kanaar R. Wyman C. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2003; 2: 787-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Yeast and human Rad54 proteins form a ternary complex with their cognate Rad51 proteins (14Clever B. Interthal H.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4106-4110Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In this complex, Rad54 stabilizes the Rad51 nucleoprotein filament and stimulates DNA strand exchange activity (16Mazin A.V. Alexeev A.A. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol.

Reciprocally, Rad51 was shown to stimulate the dsDNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis and chromatin remodeling action of Rad54 (8Alexeev A. Mazin A. Kowalczykowski S.C. Nat. Struct.

Cell. 2000; 6: 563-572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Previously, we showed that human and yeast Rad54 binds specifically to Holliday junctions and promotes their branch migration (BM) (21Bugreev D.V. Mazina O.M. Mazin A.V. Nature. 2006; 442: 590-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). We further found that BM requires formation of a catalytically active multimeric hRad54 complexes containing 8–12 monomeric units of hRad54 protein (22Mazina O.M. Rossi M.J. Thomä N.H. Mazin A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 21068-21080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). But the question remains, what is the function of Rad54 BM activity in homologous recombination? We previously suggested hRad54 BM activity can promote dissociation of D-loops, a step required for further re-joining of the broken DNA ends along the SDSA mechanism of HR. Indeed, we found that hRad54 can promote dissociation of D-loops through its BM activity (21Bugreev D.V. Mazina O.M. Mazin A.V. Nature. 2006; 442: 590-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, our data also indicated that hRad54 protein is only able to promote dissociation of D-loops if the filament is in the inactive ADP bound form (23Bugreev D.V. Hanaoka F. Mazin A.V. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 746-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We previously showed that the hRad51-ssDNA filament conformation undergoes transition from an active ATP-bound form to an inactive ADP-bound form and that this transition can be modulated by Ca2+ (24Bugreev D.V. Mazin A.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9988-9993Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Here we investigated the interaction of hRad54 with model HR intermediates, in which the hRad51-ssDNA filament was maintained in the active ATP-bound form. Our results demonstrate that hRad54 can extend these native model D-loops. Moreover, our data demonstrate that the active hRad51-ssDNA filament stimulates DNA BM activity of hRad54. We also investigated the mechanism of the stimulation. Our results suggest that hRad51 stimulates BM by hRad54 through specific protein-protein interactions. Furthermore, Ca2+, which activates hRad51-ssDNA filament, also increases the stimulatory effect of hRad51 on hRad54. Overall, our current results support the hypothesis that the hRad51 conformation has a strong effect on the function of hRad54 BM activity by channeling HR intermediates toward either the DSBR or SDSA pathways, and thereby promoting formation of either crossover or non-crossover recombinants. Proteins and DNA—Human Rad54, Rad54 K189R, Rad51, and Rad51 K133R were purified as described previously (18Mazina O.M. Mazin A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52042-52051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 25Sigurdsson S. Trujillo K. Song B. Stratton S. Sung P. J. Biol.

Sung (Yale); Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rad54 and Rad51 were provided by S. Kowalczykowski (UC Davis). All oligonucleotides (IDT, Inc) used in this study (supplemental Table S1) were purified by electrophoresis in 6–10% polyacrylamide gels containing 50% urea. The concentrations of the purified oligonucleotides were determined spectrophotometrically using extinction coefficients provided by the manufacturer. To prepare PX-junctions, complementary ssDNA oligonucleotides were annealed as described (26Bugreev D.V. Mazina O.M. Mazin A.V. Nat. Protocols. 2006; (2010.1038/nprot.2006.2217)Google Scholar) and stored at -20 °C. Oligonucleotides were labeled using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase, as described previously (16Mazin A.V. Alexeev A.A. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14029-14036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). BM Assay—To produce PX-junctions for the 3-stranded BM reaction, the hRad51 protein (10 μm) was incubated with ssDNA (no. 201; 1.45 μm molecules) in standard BM buffer containing 35 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2.5 mm ATP, 1 mm DTT, 100 μg/ml BSA, an ATP-regenerating system (10 units/ml creatine phosphokinase and 15 mm creatine phosphate), 3 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm CaCl2 (unless indicated otherwise) for 15 min at 37 °C. Then 32P-labeled 5′-flap DNA (no. 71/196/197; 1.33 μm molecules) was added, and incubation was continued for 15 min at 30 °C to form the PX-junction (no. 71/196/197/201). The total reaction volume was 20 μl. To produce PX-junctions for the 4-stranded BM reaction, the hRad51 protein (10 μm) was incubated with tailed DNA (no. 170/171; 1.45 μm, molecules) in BM buffer for 15 min at 37 °C. Then 32P-labeled fork DNA (no. 71/169; 1.33 μm molecules) was added, and incubation was continued for 15 min at 30 °C forming the PX-junction (no. 71/169/170/171) in a total reaction volume of 20 μl. PX junctions were constructed in such a way (by incorporating a region of heterology; see Figs. 2A and 3A) that allowed BM only in one direction, which simulated the extension of joint molecules during HR.FIGURE 3Both human and yeast Rad51 stimulate the BM activity of Rad54 in a 3-strand BM reaction.

The final concentrations were 250 nm hRad51 protein, 100 nm of hRad54, 33 nm (molecules) of PX-junctions in standard BM buffer (unless otherwise indicated). The reactions were carried out for indicated periods of time at 30 °C in a total reaction volume of 60 μl. The same experimental conditions were used when human proteins were substituted with yRad51 and yRad54. In experiments from Fig. 5, the DNA substrates concentrations were decreased to 20 nm, and the reaction conditions were altered (temperature was decreased to 20 °C and CaCl2 concentration to 3 mm) to facilitate measurements of the reaction rates in the presence and absence of hRad51 protein. In experiments from Fig. 7, the reaction temperature was lowered to 25 °C to extenuate the difference between reaction rates in the presence of mutant hRad51 proteins. Aliquots (10 μl) were withdrawn, and DNA substrates were deproteinized by treatment with stop buffer (1.4% SDS, 960 μg/ml proteinase K, 7.5% glycerol, 0.015% bromphenol blue) for 5 min at 22 °C. DNA products were analyzed by electrophoresis in 8% polyacrylamide gels (29:1) in 1× TBE buffer (89 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3, and 1 mm EDTA) at 22 °C. The gels were dried on DE81 chromatography paper (Whatman) and quantified using a Storm 840 PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics).FIGURE 7Stimulation of hRad54 BM activity does not require the ATPase activity of hRad51 protein. hRad51 filaments were formed with either wild-type hRad51 (open circles), the hRad51K133R mutant (closed triangles), or the hRad51K133A mutant (open triangles) by incubation with tailed DNA (nos. 170/171; 36 nm, molecules). Complexes were then incubated with fork DNA to produce PX-junctions (nos. 71/169/170/171; 33 nm, molecules). The kinetics of a 4-strand BM was initiated by the addition of hRad54 (100 nm) at 25 °C.

Krupp R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 97-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The oxidation of NADH, coupled to ADP phosphorylation, resulted in a decrease in absorbance at 340 nm, which was continuously monitored by a Hewlett-Packard 8453 diode array spectrophotometer using UV-Visible ChemStation software. The rate of ATP hydrolysis was calculated from the rate of change in absorbance using the following formula: rate of A340 decrease (s-1) × 9880 = rate of ATP hydrolysis (μm/min). The reactions in standard buffer containing 35 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 3 mm MgCl2, 5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm DTT, 2.5 mm ATP, 3 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, pyruvate kinase (20 units/ml), lactate dehydrogenase (20 units/ml), and NADH (200 μg/ml), and the indicated concentrations of Rad54 protein and DNA were carried out at 30 °C. Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) ATPase Assay— 4-Strand PX-junction complexes in the presence or absence of hRad51 were prepared as described above for the BM assay in standard buffer containing CaCl2 at indicated concentrations and 20 nCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The hRad54 protein (60 nm) was incubated with the complexes formed by hRad51 (250 nm) with PX-junctions (33 nm, molecules) in BM buffer for 5 min at 30 °C. The products of ATP hydrolysis were analyzed by TLC on PEI-cellulose plates in a running buffer of 0.3 m KH2PO4, pH 7.0. The extent of ATP hydrolysis was determined using a Storm 840 PhosphorImager. D-loop Disruption Assay— hRad51 protein (5 μm) was incubated with 32P-labeled tailed DNA (no. 199/209; 150 nm molecules) in buffer containing 35 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm ATP, 2 mm DTT, 100 μg/ml BSA, and 1 mm CaCl2 for 15 min at 37 °C. D-loop formation was initiated by the addition of pUC19 supercoiled DNA (250 μm, nucleotides) for 15 min at 37 °C. D-loops were then diluted 5-fold in buffer containing 35 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2.5 mm ATP, 1 mm DTT, 100 μg/ml BSA, the ATP-regenerating system (10 units/ml creatine phosphokinase and 15 mm creatine phosphate), 3 mm MgCl2, indicated CaCl2 and incubated for 5 min at 37 °C. Disruption of D-loops (50 μm nucleotides, 9.3 nm molecules) containing hRad51 protein (1 μm) was initiated by additions of hRad54 protein (100 nm) for indicated periods of time at 37 °C. Aliquots (10 μl) were withdrawn, and DNA substrates were deproteinized by treatment with stop buffer (1.4% SDS, 960 μg/ml proteinase K, 7.5% glycerol, 0.015% bromphenol blue) for 5 min at 22 °C. The products were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel. The gels were dried on DE81 chromatography paper (Whatman) and quantified using a Storm 840 PhosphorImager. Rad51 Protein Efficiently Stimulates 3-Strand and 4-Strand BM Activity of Cognate Rad54 Protein—Previously, we showed that hRad54 can disrupt native D-loops containing hRad51 protein through its ATPase-dependent BM activity (23Bugreev D.V.

However, D-loop disruption could only occur when the filament was in an inactive ADP-bound state, e.g. in the absence of calcium ion. Here, we investigated the effect of the active hRad51 filament on the BM activity of hRad54. We constructed oligonucleotide DNA substrates that mimicked the product of ssDNA invasion in homologous duplex DNA at the initial step of HR. For this purpose, we prepared PX-junctions using the annealing activity of hRad51 protein. First, the hRad51 filament was formed with either tailed dsDNA or ssDNA and then forked or 5′-flap DNA were added, respectively. Rad51-promoted annealing created two types of PX-junctions (Figs. 2A and 3A) These PX-junctions allowed us to monitor 4-strand and 3-strand BM, respectively. Both PX-junctions were designed to be movable in only one direction and contained 1 and 4 mismatched base pairs for 4-strand and 3-strand BM, respectively, to prevent spontaneous BM. In parallel, we constructed the identical two PX-junctions by thermal annealing, in the absence of hRad51 (naked PX-junctions). We then measured the rate of BM promoted by hRad54 on naked PX-junctions and on the PX-junctions containing hRad51 at 30 °C. We found that under tested conditions, the rate of BM in the presence of hRad51 was ∼12-fold higher in the 4-strand BM reaction (Fig. 2, B and C) and 4-fold higher in the 3-strand reaction (Fig. 3C). Next, using the same 3-strand BM assay we tested whether stimulation of BM occurred for Rad51 and Rad54 from yeast S. cerevisiae. As in the case with the human proteins, yRad51 stimulated the BM activity of yRad54 causing an ∼12-fold increase in the 4-strand reaction (Fig. 2D) and 4-fold increase in the 3-strand reaction (Fig. 3, B and D). Thus, the Rad51 nucleoprotein filament substantially stimulates the BM activity of Rad54, and this stimulation appears to be evolutionarily conserved from yeast to human proteins. The stimulation showed no dependence on a particular branched DNA structure, e.g. X-junctions or PX-junctions (data not shown). Taken together, our previous (23Bugreev D.V. Hanaoka F. Mazin A.V. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 746-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and current data show that the active hRad51 filament not only inhibits disruption of D-loops by hRad54, it also stimulates the BM activity of hRad54 directing it toward extension of D-loops. Effect of hRad51 Concentration on the Stimulation of hRad54 BM Activity—Here, we wish to determine the hRad51 stoichiometry that is required for stimulation of the hRad54 BM activity. Human Rad51, at varied concentrations, was mixed with tailed dsDNA- or ssDNA-forming nucleoprotein filaments. These substrates were then annealed to complementary fork or 5′-flap DNA producing PX-junctions (Figs. 2A and 3A). These substrates were used to determine the rates of BM promoted by hRad54 in 4-strand and 3-strand reactions (Fig. 4). We found that at a constant concentration of hRad54 (100 nm), maximal stimulation of the rate of hRad54-promoted BM occurred at relatively low concentrations of hRad51 (250 nm) for both the 3-strand and 4-strand reaction. Given that a hRad51 monomer binds three nucleotides of ssDNA or three base pairs of dsDNA, maximal stimulation occurs under conditions where the hRad51 filament covers approximately one-quarter the length of the ssDNA or tailed DNA substrates. Human Rad51 has comparable affinity for ss- and dsDNA, therefore hRad51 should bind randomly along the DNA substrate. Under subsaturating concentrations of hRad51, the number and length of filaments on any given substrates may vary. Further increase in hRad51 concentration caused an inhibition of the rate (Fig. 4) and, especially, the extent (data not shown) of hRad54-promoted BM. Apparently, the higher hRad51 concentrations resulted in a population of substrates that hRad54 cannot branch migrate. Thus, the hRad51 efficiently stimulates hRad54 BM activity in 3-strand and 4-strand reactions at substoichiometric concentrations relative to the concentrations of DNA substrates. Effect of the hRad54 Concentration on BM in the Presence of hRad51—We previously showed that maximal BM activity requires 10 ± 2 monomers of hRad54 per molecule of DNA (22Mazina O.M. Rossi M.J. Thomä N.H. Mazin A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 21068-21080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The data suggested that during BM two hRad54 subcomplexes, 4–6 protein monomers each, bind to the two opposing DNA arms of the Holliday junction (or PX-junction) forming a catalytically active complex. Here, to better understand the mechanism of stimulation of hRad54 BM activity by hRad51 we wanted to examine whether the hRad51 that is bound to the PX-junction has an effect on the optimal hRad54 stoichiometry. The experiments were performed at 20 °C for more accurate measurements of the rate of BM, as we previously showed that the temperature has no significant affect on the hRad54 stoichiometry (22Mazina O.M. Rossi M.J. Thomä N.H. Mazin A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 21068-21080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In accordance with our previous results, in the absence of hRad51 we observed 10.5 ± 1.5 monomers of hRad54 per one PX-junction molecule were required to achieve the maximal initial rate of BM (Fig. 5, circles). However, in the presence of hRad51 a significantly lower hRad54 stoichiometry of 4.5 ± 1.5 monomers per PX-junction molecule was required for the maximal rate of BM (Fig. 5, squares). Thus, hRad51 reduces the amount of hRad54 that is required for the maximal rate of BM approximately by a factor of two. Human Rad51, but Not Yeast Rad51, Promotes Interspecies Stimulation of Rad54 BM Activity—To investigate the role of protein-protein interactions between Rad51 and Rad54 in stimulation of BM activity, we tested the ability of the yRad51 nucleoprotein filament to stimulate the BM activity of hRad54. Human Rad54 BM activity was not stimulated by the presence of yRad51 in the 3-stranded reaction (Fig. 6A). We then tested the ability of hRad51 to stimulate BM activity of yRad54. Surprisingly, we found that the initial rate of BM activity of yRad54 was stimulated ∼4-fold by hRad51 (Fig. 6B). Thus, the initial rate of BM for yRad54 was the same in the presence of yRad51 or hRad51 (compare Figs. 3C and 6B). However, the extent of the reaction was lower for hRad51, indicating the presence of a population of substrates containing hRad51 that yRad54 cannot branch-migrate. We wanted to determine whether the specificities of hRad51 and yRad51 in stimulation of BM activity correlate with their specificities in stimulation of the ATPase activities of Rad54. Consistent with a previous report by Kiianitsa et al. (28Kiianitsa K. Solinger J.A. Heyer W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46205-46215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), the results we obtained using a spectrophotometric ATPase assay showed that the hRad51 nucleoprotein filament formed on a PX-junction stimulates the ATPase activity of yRad54 (Fig. 6C). In contrast, we found that the yRad51 nucleoprotein filament does not stimulate the ATPase activity of hRad54. Thus, hRad51 and yRad51 showed the same specificities in stimulation of the BM and ATPase activities of hRad54 and yRad54 proteins: while hRad51 can stimulate the activities of both human and yeast Rad54, yRad51 only stimulates the activities of yRad54 and not hRad54 (compare Figs. 3C and 6A). Still, interactions between yRad54 and the hRad51 filament are apparently not specific enough to stimulate the DNA strand exchange activity of hRad51; yRad54 could not stimulate the D-loop formation activity of hRad51 under tested conditions. 3M. J. Rossi and A. V. Mazin, unpublished observations. Previously, this stimulation has only been observed for cognate Rad51 and Rad54 proteins (17Petukhova G. Stratton S. Sung P. Nature. 1998; 393: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 18Mazina O.M. Mazin A.V. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 42790-42794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). These data indicate that different types of Rad54-Rad51 complexes are required for DNA strand exchange and BM. Stimulation of hRad54 BM Activity Is Not Dependent on the ATPase Activity of hRad51—We used two hRad51 ATPase-deficient mutants to determine the role its ATPase activity plays in stimulating the BM activity of hRad54. In these proteins, the conserved Walker type A lysine was mutated to either arginine (K133R) or alanine (K133A). Although both of these mutants lack ATPase activity, the hRad51 K133R protein retains the ability to form an active nucleoprotein filament that promotes DNA strand exchange, but the hRad51 K133A protein forms a filament that is inactive in DNA strand exchange (30Chi P. Van Komen S. Sehorn M.G. Sigurdsson S. Sung P. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2006; 5: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). When included in our 4-strand BM assay, both hRad51 K133R and wild-type hRad51 stimulated the BM activity of hRad54 to a similar extent both at 25 °C (Fig. 7, open circles and closed triangles) and at 30 °C (data not shown). Previously, it was shown that wild-type and ATPase-deficient Rad51K191R mutant proteins equally stimulate the ATPase activity of Rad54 (29Sigurdsson S. Van Komen S. Petukhova G. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42790-42794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 31Li X. Zhang X.P. Solinger J.A. Kiianitsa K. Yu X. Egelman E.H. Heyer W.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 4124-4140Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Thus, stimulation of Rad54 BM activity by Rad51 parallels with stimulation of the ATPase activity. However, stimulation of the rate of hRad54 BM by hRad51 K133A was only half as efficient as wild-type hRad51 (Fig. 7, open triangles). Thus, the ATPase activity of hRad51 is not required to stimulate the BM activity of hRad54, but the conformation of the filament does play a role. We further found that in BM, the ATPase activity of hRad51 does not compensate for the lack of the ATPase activity of hRad54; no BM activity of the ATPase-deficient hRad54 K189R mutant was observed in the presence of hRad51. Similarly, when a non-hydrolyzable ATP analog, AMP-PNP, was used, BM did not occur in the presence 3M. J. Rossi and A. V. Mazin, unpublished observations. or absence of hRad51 (21Bugreev D.V. Mazina O.M. Mazin A.V. Nature. 2006; 442: 590-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Thus, ATP hydrolysis by hRad54, but not hRad51, is required for BM. Ca2+ Enhances the Stimulatory Effect of hRad51 on hRad54 BM Activity—We previously showed that calcium ion is required for stimulation of the DNA strand exchange activity of hRad51 by hRad54 (18Mazina O.M. Mazin A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52042-52051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Here, we asked whether Ca2+ also affects the ability of hRad51 to stimulate the BM activity of hRad54. We found that in the presence of Mg2+ alone, hRad51 produces a 4-fold stimulation of the rate of hRad54-dependent BM in the 4-strand reaction, compared with an 15-fold stimulation observed in the presence of both Ca2+ and Mg2+ (Fig. 8A). However, in the absence of hRad51, Ca2+ causes inhibition of the BM activity of hRad54 (Fig. 8A, squares), paralleling the inhibitory effect of Ca2+ on hRad54 ATPase activity (18Mazina O.M. Mazin A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52042-52051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) (Fig. 8C, circles). Ca2+ showed a concentration-dependent effect on the ability of the hRad51 filament to stimulate the BM activity of hRad54. In the presence of hRad51 and 3 mm Mg2+, the rate of the BM activity of hRad54 doubles when the Ca2+ concentration increased from 0 to 5 mm (Fig. 8B, squares). But over the same range in the absence of hRad51, the rate of BM activity of hRad54 dropped 4-fold (Fig. 8B, circles). The stimulation was specific for Ca2+, because there was no increase in the rate of BM in the presence of hRad51 when the concentration of Mg2+ was raised to 8 mm (data not shown). Because hRad54 BM activity showed dependence on ATP hydrolysis, we also examined the effect of Ca2+ on the ATPase activity of hRad54 using a TLC ATPase assay and our oligonucleotide-derived PX-junctions as a substrate. We found that in the absence of hRad51, an increase in Ca2+ concentration from 0 to 5 mm causes ∼1.5-fold inhibition in the extend of ATP hydrolysis, whereas in the presence of hRad51 we observed no significant change in ATP hydrolysis by hRad54 (Fig. 8C). These data show that the hRad51 filament causes greater stimulation of hRad54 activities or are made more resistant to inhibition when the filament is in the Ca2+-stabilized, active (ATP-bound) conformation. In parallel, we found that the increase in Ca2+ concentration causes a gradual increase in the ability of hRad51 to protect D-loops against disruption by hRad54 (Fig. 9). Thus, Ca2+ both increases the stimulatory effect of hRad51 on hRad54 BM activity and inhibits disruption of the D-loops by hRad54. Synergistic interaction of Rad51 and Rad54 proteins is critically important for efficient HR. During the early stages of DNA double strand break repair, the hRad51 filament forms a nucleoprotein filament on ssDNA that promotes a critical invasion step resulting in the D-loop formation (Fig. 1A). Rad54 greatly stimulates DNA pairing activity of Rad51. After D-loop extension by DNA polymerase, these HR intermediates are thought to proceed via two pathways, SDSA or DSBR (Fig. 1B). The SDSA involves dissociation of the D-loops and restoration of the broken DNA molecule by annealing of tailed dsDNA molecules (6Pâques F. Haber J.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 349-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The DSBR requires extension of the D-loops by BM, second end capture, formation of double D-loops that lead to double Holliday junctions, and finally resolution of double Holliday junctions by specific endonucleases. We previously showed that the BM activity of hRad54 can dissociate single and double D-loops and suggested that hRad54 may either contribute to the SDSA or channel recombination intermediates into a novel pathway, we denoted the double D-loop dissociation pathway (DDD) (23Bugreev D.V. Hanaoka F. Mazin A.V. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 746-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, hRad54 can cause dissociation of D-loops only if the Rad51 protein that is bound to the D-loops is in an inactive (ADP-bound) form. Here, we modeled the invasion event promoted by hRad51-ssDNA filament using synthetic DNA substrates and investigated the effect of an active (ATP bound) and an inactive hRad51 filament on the BM activity of hRad54 (Figs. 2A and 3A). Here, we found that the hRad51 filament stimulates the BM activity of hRad54. The stimulation was observed in both 4-stranded and 3-stranded BM reactions and showed no dependence on a particular branched DNA structure, e.g. X-junctions or PX-junctions. Stimulation of Rad54 BM by Rad51 appeared to be evolutionarily conserved, as yRad51 also stimulates BM activity of yRad54. These results indicate that the role of the active hRad51 filament is not limited to protection of joint molecules against dissociation by hRad54 or BLM (23Bugreev D.V. Hanaoka F. Mazin A.V. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 746-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). By stimulating the hRad54 BM activity the active hRad51-ssDNA filament directs it toward an extension of joint molecules. Thus, the conformation of the hRad51 may affect the choice of the HR pathways, e.g. promoting the DSBR instead of the SDSA. The observed increase in the BM activity could not be due to an additive effect of BM activities of hRad51 and hRad54. First, although BM activity of hRad51 has recently been reported (32Murayama Y. Kurokawa Y. Mayanagi K. Iwasaki H. Nature. 2008; 451: 1018-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), hRad51 does not show BM activity under our reaction conditions in the absence of hRad54 within the time frame of our experiments (21Bugreev D.V. Mazina O.M. Mazin A.V. Nature. 2006; 442: 590-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Second, hRad51 does not show any BM activity in the presence of an ATPase-deficient hRad54. Third, the stimulation of BM does not depend on the ATPase activity of hRad51, which would be expected if hRad51 contributes through its own BM activity. Whereas we found previously that only an active hRad51 filament protects joint molecules from dissociation by hRad54, our current results show that both active and inactive filament can stimulate BM activity of hRad54. Still, the stimulation was greater in the presence of an active hRad51 filament. The hRad51 K133R mutant protein, which forms an active nucleoprotein filament, was ∼2-fold more efficient in stimulation of the rate of hRad54 BM than hRad51 K133A mutant, which forms an inactive filament. Similarly, stimulation of hRad54 BM by wild-type hRad51 increased ∼2-fold when the reaction mixture was supplemented with Ca2+, which promotes formation of an active hRad51 filament (24Bugreev D.V. Mazin A.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9988-9993Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Thus, greater stimulation of BM activity by an active hRad51 filament versus an inactive filament may depend in part on the conformation of hRad51 protein that is presented to hRad54. The simulation of BM showed a peculiar dependence on species-specific Rad51-Rad54 interactions. Whereas yRad51 can stimulate BM activity of yRad54 and not hRad54, hRad51 stimulates BM activity of both hRad54 and yRad54. The same pattern was also seen in stimulation of the ATPase activity of Rad54 in the presence of subsaturating Rad51 complexes formed with either PX-junctions (this work) or with supercoiled φX174 DNA (28Kiianitsa K. Solinger J.A. Heyer W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46205-46215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The observed asymmetry in species-specific Rad54-Rad51 interactions is consistent with a greater evolutionarily conservation of Rad51 in comparison with Rad54. Thus, hRad51 may inherit contact sites for interactions with yRad54, while hRad54 may lose its sites of interaction with yRad51. This interpretation implies a complex composition of the Rad51-binding site in Rad54 protein, with some of the domains being more conserved than the other. Indeed, at least two yRad54 regions were identified that are responsible for interactions with yRad51 (33Raschle M. Van Komen S. Chi P. Ellenberger T. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51973-51980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In contrast to the BM activity, stimulation of DNA strand exchange activity of Rad51 by Rad54 imposes very strict requirements for the specificity of Rad51-Rad54 interactions, as human and yeast Rad54 protein can stimulate only its cognate Rad51 (18Mazina O.M. Mazin A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52042-52051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 19Mazin A.V. Bornarth C.J. Solinger J.A. Heyer W.D. Kowalczykowski S.C. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 583-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Thus, it appeared that Rad54 and Rad51 form different complexes during DNA strand exchange and BM. We found that BM on branched DNA substrates fully saturated with hRad51 was inefficient. Maximal stimulation of the rate of BM activity occurred under subsaturating concentrations of hRad51; ∼1 hRad51 monomer per 12 nucleotides of ssDNA or tailed DNA substrate. An increase in hRad51 concentration caused inhibition of the extent of BM and, at higher hRad51 concentrations, of the initial rate of BM. Taken together, these data suggest a model in which efficient stimulation of BM by hRad54 results from binding of hRad54 to the end of the invading hRad51 filament and promotion of BM toward the DNA region that is not covered with hRad51. It was recently reported that yRad54 shows preference for association with the terminal part of the filament formed on linear dsDNA (34Kiianitsa K. Solinger J.A. Heyer W.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 9767-9772Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This preference may be greatly enhanced at the DNA junction created by the filament invasion, to which Rad54 has ∼200-fold greater binding affinity comparing with linear dsDNA. Our results show that while stimulating the BM activity of hRad54, hRad51 also has a profound effect on the stoichiometry of hRad54 in BM. Previously, we found that the maximal initial BM rate for hRad54 was observed at a stoichiometry of 10.5 ± 1.5 hRad54 monomers per one PX-junction molecule. We suggested that in BM two multimeric (tetra- or hexameric) complexes of hRad54 bind symmetrically to the opposite dsDNA arms flanking the Holliday junction. Our data indicated that the formation of these multimeric BM complexes is initiated by binding of hRad54 dimer to the HJ (22Mazina O.M. Rossi M.J. Thomä N.H. Mazin A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 21068-21080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This parallels with recent observation by Muzzolini et al. (35Muzzolini L. Beuron F. Patwardhan A. Popuri V. Cui S. Niccolini B. Rappas M. Freemont P.S. Vindigni A. PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e20Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), which related different activities of RECQ1 helicase with different quaternary forms of the protein. Our current results show that in the presence of hRad51 the apparent stoichiometry of hRad54 was reduced by a factor of approximately two, yielding 4.5 ± 1.5 hRad54 monomers per PX-junction molecule. We propose the following interpretation of this result: when PX-junctions (or D-loops) are formed through invasion of the hRad51-ssDNA filament, hRad51 protein bound to one arm of DNA flanking the junction may support and stabilize initial binding of a hRad54 monomer via protein-protein interactions, providing the nucleation for assembly of, a single hRad54 multimeric (tetra- or hexameric) complex at the junction. Our current studies demonstrate that Rad51 protein stimulates the BM activity of Rad54. Thus, BM activity of Rad54 is added to the ATPase and chromatin remodeling activities of hRad54, which stimulation by hRad51 has been reported earlier. It was recently shown in S. cerevisiae that interaction between Rad51 and Rad54 can be regulated by a meiosis-specific mediator protein called Hed1 (36Busygina V. Sehorn M.G. Shi I.Y. Tsubouchi H. Roeder G.S. Sung P. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 786-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Hed1 appears to block the binding of yRad54 to yRad51; thereby shuttling HR intermediates through a Dmc1-dependent pathway that ensures the proper level of crossover products occur between homologous chromosomes during meiosis. We found that the conformation of the hRad51 filament also plays an important role in interactions of the filament with hRad54, which may lead to either dissociation or expansion of joint molecules and thereby contribute to the choice between the SDSA and DSBR pathways during HR, thereby providing the cell with another mechanism of regulation.

Tadataka Yamada, Alice Dautry and Mark Walport offer a roadmap for heading off a global avian influenza catastrophe. The 'official' influenza vaccine failed this year. Each year the World Health Organization selects strains for the vaccine based on epidemiological data. Most of the time it works, but what can be done to prevent future failures? Steven Salzberg thinks the answer lies in better tracking of virus mutations. This means that some research groups need to change their ways. Instead of guarding their data, the priority should be the rapid dissemination of genome sequence data on all isolates — human and avian. More transparency is one of the recommendations made by Yamada et al. in a checklist on how we should prepare for the next influenza pandemic. Other suggestions include stockpiling standard (inter-pandemic) flu vaccine, a special pricing model for poor countries, and improved surveillance mechanisms.

The majority of DNA processing including DNA replication, transcription, repair, and recombination requires resolution of topological problems linked to the separation of the two DNA strands. Topoisomerases and helicases are two classes of enzymes specialized for these processes. Helicases catalyze disruption of hydrogen bonds between the two strands (1Patel S.S. Donmez I. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18265-18268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Topoisomerases catalyze the interconversion of topological isomers of DNA and are required for the resolution of torsional stress and the unlinking of topologically intertwined molecules (2Wang J.C.

Elie C. Nadal M. Bouthier de la Tour C. Forterre P. Duguet M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4753-4757Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Reverse gyrase has the almost unique property of introducing positive supercoils into a covalently closed DNA at the expense of ATP (8Kikuchi A. Asai K. Nature. 1984; 309: 677-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 9Duguet M. Nucleic Acids Mol. Biol. 1995; 9: 84-114Crossref Google Scholar). This enzyme is only found in archaeal and bacterial hyperthermophiles (10Bouthier de la Tour C. Portemer C. Huber R. Forterre P. Duguet M. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 3921-3923Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Bouthier de la Tour C. Portemer C. Nadal M. Stetter K. Forterre P. Duguet M. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6803-6808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is the only known hyperthermophile-specific protein (12Forterre P. Trends Genet. 2002; 18: 236-237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), indicating an important role for life at high temperature. Indeed it was shown that a lack of reverse gyrase leads to a significant reduction in the growth rate at a high temperature (13Atomi H. Matsumi R. Imanaka T. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 4829-4833Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Several functions related to maintenance of genome integrity have been proposed for reverse gyrase, including a role in rewinding of DNA strands after passage of a transcription complex or during migration of recombination junctions (15Napoli A. Valenti A. Salerno V. Nadal M. Garnier F. Rossi M. Ciaramella M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33192-33198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 16Kampmann M. Stock D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 3537-3545Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Reverse gyrase is able to anneal single-stranded DNA circles, also suggesting an action as a DNA renaturase (14Hsieh T.S. Plank J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5640-5647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It was also proposed that reverse gyrase could act as a “resolvase” by removing abnormal DNA structures that impede replication and transcription processes (4Duguet M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1345-1350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lastly, it has been shown that reverse gyrase is recruited to DNA in vivo after UV irradiation (15Napoli A. Valenti A. Salerno V. Nadal M. Garnier F. Rossi M. Ciaramella M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33192-33198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and that it plays a role in preventing double-stranded DNA breakage at high temperatures (16Kampmann M. Stock D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 3537-3545Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Sequence and structural analyses of the topoisomerase domain (7Confalonieri F. Elie C. Nadal M. Bouthier de la Tour C. Forterre P. Duguet M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4753-4757Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 17Rodriguez A.C. Stock D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 418-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) as well as biochemical data (18Nakasu S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2705-2710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Jaxel C. Nadal M. Mirambeau G. Forterre P. Takahashi M. Duguet M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3135-3139Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) indicate that reverse gyrase belongs to the type IA topoisomerases family. Similarly to these enzymes, reverse gyrase relaxes negatively supercoiled DNA and transiently cleaves single-stranded DNA, forming a 5′-phosphotyrosine covalent intermediate (20Jaxel C. Nadal M. Mirambeau G. Forterre P. Takahashi M. Duguet M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3135-3139Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, whereas type IA topoisomerases do not require ATP to function (reviewed in Ref. 3Champoux J.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 369-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (2180) Google Scholar), the positive DNA supercoiling activity of reverse gyrase is ATP-dependent (8Kikuchi A. Asai K. Nature. 1984; 309: 677-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 18Nakasu S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2705-2710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Rodriguez A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29865-29873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The ATP-binding site is located in the helicase domain, and it was proposed that ATP hydrolysis provides the energy required to drive the DNA strand passage performed by the topoisomerase domain (21Rodriguez A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29865-29873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The helicase domain contains motifs I, Ia, II, III, V, VI, and Q found in helicases of the SF1 and SF2 superfamilies (7Confalonieri F. Elie C. Nadal M. Bouthier de la Tour C. Forterre P. Duguet M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4753-4757Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 22Serre M.C. Duguet M. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2003; 74: 37-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 23Tanner N.K. Cordin O. Banroques J. Doere M. Linder P. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 127-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Motifs I and II (so called Walker motifs A and B) are mainly devoted to ATP binding and hydrolysis, whereas motifs V and VI in different enzymes can either be involved in nucleic acid binding, NTP hydrolysis, or both (for reviews see Refs 24Tuteja N. Tuteja R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 1849-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar and 25Hall M.C. Matson S.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 867-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Motif III differs between SF1 and SF2 helicases, and its role is unclear. The Q motif was recently identified in DEAD box helicases. A close examination of reverse gyrase sequences allowed us to identify a highly conserved glutamine located upstream of motif I (see Fig. 1) that could correspond to this invariant residue. This motif may regulate ATP binding and hydrolysis (23Tanner N.K. Cordin O. Banroques J. Doere M. Linder P. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 127-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Among reverse gyrases, a highly conserved putative zinc finger motif (zinc motif) is located at the extreme N-terminal end of the helicase domain (22Serre M.C. Duguet M. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2003; 74: 37-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), but the function of this motif is presently unknown. Here, we have examined the role of helicase motifs I, II, V, VI, Q, and zinc motif through a mutagenesis study of recombinant reverse gyrase from Thermotoga maritima. As most archaeal reverse gyrases, the T. maritima enzyme is composed of a single polypeptide chain (1104 amino acids, 128 kDa) containing the helicase and zinc finger motifs present in reverse gyrases (26Bouthier de la Tour C. Portemer C. Kaltoum H. Duguet M. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 274-281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The enzymatic properties of mutant proteins were analyzed by testing their positive DNA supercoiling activity, DNA binding and cleavage, and ATPase activity. Our results clearly indicate that helicase motifs are intimately involved in the reverse gyrase activity, likely via their helicase ATP hydrolysis machinery. Mutations in motifs I, II, V, and VI abolished the reverse gyrase activity, whereas mutation in the Q motif significantly reduced it. The corresponding mutant proteins were strongly impaired in ATP hydrolysis, indicating the importance of these five motifs in ATP binding and hydrolysis. Mutagenesis of the zinc finger motif led to a mutant protein exhibiting a reduced positive supercoiling activity. We show for the first time that this motif is important for DNA binding. Cloning and Site-directed Mutagenesis—A DNA fragment encoding the T. maritima reverse gyrase was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using genomic DNA as a template, Pfu DNA polymerase (Expand High Fidelity kit; Roche Applied Science), a forward primer containing a NcoI restriction site (5′-GCGATGCCATGGCAGTGAATTCCAAATACCA-3′) and a reverse primer containing a XhoI restriction site (5′-GATCCGCTCGAGCCCCTCCTCCATGAGAGATTTT-3′). PCR products were digested by NcoI and XhoI and cloned at the corresponding sites into the pET24d expression vector (Novagen). The resulting plasmid (pET24d-TmTopR) was verified by DNA sequencing and used as a template for site-directed mutagenesis. Seven reverse gyrase mutants were generated (see Fig. 1). Mutants of the putative active site tyrosine (Y851F), motifs I, Q, and zinc were obtained by using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), following the manufacturer's instructions. Mutants of motifs II, V, and VI were obtained by using the overlap extension strategy (27Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6821) Google Scholar). All of the mutant constructs were sequenced to verify the presence of the desired mutations and the absence of additional mutations. The sequences of the oligonucleotides used in this study are available upon request. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—The pET24d-TmTopR plasmid and derivatives permit the production of recombinant proteins with a C-terminal His tag. Wild type and mutant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta (DE3) cells (Novagen) under the following conditions: LB medium was inoculated with a freshly transformed colony containing 35 μg/ml kanamycin and 35 μg/ml chloramphenicol and grown overnight at 37 °C. 30 ml of the preculture were added to 1.8 liters of the same medium and grown at 37 °C to A600 = 0.5. Induction was carried out by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to the culture (final concentration, 1 mm). The cells were grown overnight at 24 °C and harvested by centrifugation. Approximately 4.5 g of cells were usually obtained (A600 = 1.0–1.2). If necessary, the cell pellets were stored at –80 °C. The same purification procedure was followed for wild type and mutant enzymes. The cells were resuspended in 10 volumes (1 ml/g of cells) of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.8 m NaCl), lysed by sonication, and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The crude extract was then heated for 15 min at 75 °C and immediately centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was loaded onto a 1-ml nickel-Sepharose column (HisTrap HP; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer A containing 5 mm imidazole. The column was washed with this buffer, and elution was performed at 250 mm imidazole in buffer A. Approximately 0.5–1 mg of protein was loaded onto a gel filtration column (Superdex S200 HR10/300; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer A containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The wild type reverse gyrase and mutants all eluted as a single peak of 2 ml (retention volume, 11–12 ml). After the addition of glycerol (final concentration, 17%), the purified proteins were stored at –80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Shaffner and Weissmann (28Schaffner W. Weissmann C. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1951) Google Scholar). Reverse Gyrase Assays—Unless otherwise stated, the His-tagged proteins were incubated for 30 min at 80 °C in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 30 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 mm MgCl2, 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm ATP (or another nucleotide), and 0.25 μg of negatively supercoiled DNA (pTZ18; Pharmacia). The reactions were stopped by the addition of 0.5% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, and 0.04% bromphenol blue. The reaction products were analyzed by one- or two-dimensional 1.2% agarose gel electrophoresis as described previously (19Forterre P. Mirambeau G. Jaxel C. Nadal M. Duguet M. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2123-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). 3 μg/ml chloroquine was added in the gel and the TEP buffer (36 mm Tris, 30 mm NaH2PO4, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.8) for the second dimension electrophoresis. The first electrophoresis was run for 3 h at 3.6 V/cm, and the second was run for 16 h at 1.2 V/cm. After chloroquine elimination (3 h in H2O), the gel was stained with 1 μg/ml ethidium bromide and photographed under UV light. Depending on the mutation introduced, the assays were repeated two to three times independently. Oligonucleotide Radiolabeling—The 52-mer oligonucleotide 5′-TGATATTCATTACTTCTTATCC(T)30 containing a preferred cleavage recognition sequence for reverse gyrase (29Jaxel C. Duguet M. Nadal M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) was obtained from MWG Biotech. 1 pmol of this oligonucleotide was 5′ end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Biolabs) and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) in a final volume of 10 μlas recommended by the manufacturer. After 30 min of incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by heating at 80 °C for 15 min. Unincorporated nucleotides were removed by using the Qiaquick nucleotide removal kit (Qiagen). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift and Oligonucleotide Cleavage Assays—0.025 pmol of the 5′ end-labeled oligonucleotide was incubated with the recombinant proteins in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 30 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 mm MgCl2, and 40 mm NaCl for 30 min at indicated temperatures in a final volume of 20 μl. The reaction mixture was then divided into two and treated as follows: 2.5 μl of a 5× loading buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 20% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mg/ml xylene cyanol) was added to 10 μl of the reaction, and 5 μl were loaded onto a 6% native polyacrylamide gel in TEG buffer (50 mm Tris, 0.1 mm EDTA, 8 mm glycine). Electrophoresis was carried out at 8 °C at 150 volts for 2.5 h and analyzed by autoradiography using a Storm PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The amount of complexes formed (free DNA + bound = 100%) was quantified by using the ImageQuant software and then normalized with complexes formed by wild type taken as 100%. The second half of the reaction mixture was stopped by the addition of 1% SDS and 10 μl of loading buffer (97.5% formamide, 10 mm EDTA, 0.3% bromphenol blue, 0.3% xylene cyanol). The samples were denatured by heating at 95 °C for 3 min, and 8 μl were loaded onto an 18% denaturing polyacrylamide gel (19:1) containing 50% (w/v) urea in TBE buffer (90 mm Tris, 90 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA). The gel was run for 2 h at 48 V/cm and analyzed by autoradiography. Both assays were repeated twice independently. ATP Hydrolysis Assays—Unless otherwise stated, the reaction mixture (20 μl) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 30 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 mm MgCl2, 200 pmol ATP (10 μm) with 1.25 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) (Amersham Biosciences) and 200 ng of ϕX174 ssDNA (Biolabs). The reaction was initiated by addition of the protein at the indicated concentrations. After 30 min of incubation at different temperatures, the reaction was stopped by adding EDTA to a final concentration of 25 mm. 2 μl of a mixture of ATP/ADP/AMP at 50 mm were then added to the reaction mixture, and 2 μl were spotted onto a polyethyleneimine cellulose sheet (Polygram CEL300PEI/UV254; Macherey Nagel), which was developed with 1 m HCOOH and 0.5 m LiCl. The sheet was dried and exposed to a phosphorimaging screen. The amount of Pi released was quantified using the ImageQuant version 1.2 software. For each assay, the results correspond to the averages of three independent experiments. When testing the effect of double-stranded DNA on ATPase activity, single-stranded ϕX174 DNA was replaced by double-stranded ϕX174 DNA. The results presented are the means of three independent experiments. Mutagenesis Strategy and Production of T. maritima Reverse Gyrase Mutants—The Archaeoglobus fulgidus reverse gyrase structure revealed the presence of two RecA like subdomains (H1 and H2) in the helicase domain (17Rodriguez A.C. Stock D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 418-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Within the helicase families both subdomains display conserved motifs that were subjected to mutagenesis (Fig. 1A). Motif Q found in the DEAD box helicases family may also be present in reverse gyrases. We therefore mutagenized Gln83 to Leu, because this residue could be the motif Q invariant glutamine in T. maritima reverse gyrase. Motifs I and II, from H1, are involved in ATP binding/hydrolysis in the SF1 and SF2 helicase families. To investigate the role of these motifs in reverse gyrase, we mutated the invariant lysine of motif I, GKT, to isoleucine and the two first aspartates of motif II, DDVD, to alanines. Motifs V and VI are located in the subdomain H2. Because the function of these motifs is unclear and seems to depend on the nature of the protein, we introduced mutations in both to evaluate their role in the overall enzyme activity (Fig. 1A). Motif V, RGVD, was changed to ALVA, and motif VI, GRSSR, was changed to LASSA, Finally, to analyze the role of the zinc finger motif conserved in the N-terminal part of the helicase domain of reverse gyrases, the first two cysteines of the motif CX2CX14CX2C were mutated to alanines, and the putative active site tyrosine 851 (26Bouthier de la Tour C. Portemer C. Kaltoum H. Duguet M. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 274-281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was replaced by a phenylalanine (Y851F mutant) to obtain an inactive form of the reverse gyrase. The wild type and seven mutant proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified to near homogeneity (Fig. 1B). T. maritima Recombinant Reverse Gyrase Shares the Properties of Archaeal Reverse Gyrases—All of the reverse gyrase proteins used in this study are His-tagged at their C-terminal end, and we first examined the biochemical properties of the His-tagged wild type reverse gyrase from T. maritima. The results are presented on Fig. 2. We found that the supercoiling activity of the recombinant enzyme was dependent on temperature, as we reported for the natural reverse gyrase isolated from T. maritima cells (26Bouthier de la Tour C. Portemer C. Kaltoum H. Duguet M. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 274-281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reverse gyrase activity was monitored at 65 and 80 °C at different enzyme concentrations (Fig. 2A). At 65 °C a broad distribution of negatively and positively supercoiled DNA was produced, even at low enzyme concentration. At 80 °C, a more efficient positive supercoiling activity was observed. At this temperature, 0.01 pmol of enzyme was capable to transform 0.2 pmol of negatively supercoiled pTZ18 DNA into a ladder of positively supercoiled topoisomers (Fig. 2A). Comparison of reactions performed at 65 and 80 °C indicatde that temperature affects the overall activity of reverse gyrase (relaxation and positive supercoiling of DNA). The requirement for high temperature is common to all reverse gyrases. This is explained not only by the thermophilic nature of these enzymes but also by their preference for substrates that possess single-stranded regions, which are favored at high temperatures in negatively supercoiled DNA (21Rodriguez A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29865-29873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 30Slesarev A.I. Kozyavkin S.A. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 1990; 7: 935-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 31Shibata T. Nakasu S. Yasui K. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10419-10421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We also verified that positive supercoiling produced by the recombinant T. maritima reverse gyrase was ATP-dependent. Indeed, we observed that without co-factor in the assay, the enzyme is totally inactive, even in relaxation (Fig. 2B). Replacement of ATP by the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog ADPNP 3The abbreviations used are: ADPNP, adenylylimidodiphosphate; ss, single-stranded; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). led to a partial relaxation of negatively supercoiled pTZ18 DNA. No positive supercoiling was produced, attesting that the positive supercoiling activity of reverse gyrase is coupled to ATP hydrolysis (21Rodriguez A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29865-29873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 32Jungblut S.P. Klostermeier D. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 371: 197-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). All Mutations in Helicase Motifs Alter the Reverse Gyrase Activity—The different mutant proteins were tested for their ability to produce positively supercoiled DNA (Fig. 3). As expected, we found that the Y851F mutant is totally inactive (Fig. 3A). Further analysis revealed that it was unable to perform the DNA cleavage reaction (see Fig. 6B), indicating that Tyr851 is likely involved in formation of the transient phosphotyrosine covalent complex (26Bouthier de la Tour C. Portemer C. Kaltoum H. Duguet M. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 274-281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We used this mutant as a negative control. Motif I, II, V, and VI mutants were also totally inactive in DNA relaxation and positive supercoiling (Fig. 3A), even when 0.1 pmol of protein was used in the assay (data not shown). Motif zinc and Q mutants were still active but showed a reduced efficiency compared with the wild type enzyme (Fig. 3B). However, they remained able to relax DNA and to a lesser extent to produce positive supercoiling (Fig. 3C). The zinc and motif Q mutants displayed a distinct behavior toward ATP; whereas the DNA supercoiling activity of the zinc motif mutant was the same at the three ATP concentrations tested (Fig. 3C), the Q motif mutant was only able to relax DNA at 10 μm, positive supercoils being produced at higher ATP concentrations (100 μm and 1 mm). These results suggest that the motif Q mutant is affected in ATP binding, whereas the zinc motif mutant seems to be rather affected in DNA binding.FIGURE 6Binding and cleavage of single-stranded DNA by reverse gyrase mutants. The 52-mer oligonucleotide substrate is described in the legend to Fig. 5. A, electrophoresis mobility shift assay. The assays were conducted at 65 °C as described in the legend to Fig. 5. The amount of protein added in the reaction mixture was 0.025, 0.1, and 0.4 pmol for each protein set. The amount of complexes formed was quantified for each reaction (free DNA + bound DNA = 100%) and then normalized with complexes formed by wild type taken as 100%. B, analysis of the corresponding cleavage products. Half of the reaction mixtures corresponding to 0.4 pmol of protein in the assays of Fig. 6A was loaded on an 18% urea-polyacrylamide gel. M, 8–32 nucleotide ladder 5′ end-labeled. C, control without enzyme. WT, wild type; Zn, zinc finger motif.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We further investigated the nucleotide specificity of the motif zinc and Q mutants and compared it with the wild type enzyme properties (Fig. 4). The wild type enzyme was able to promote positive DNA supercoiling in the presence of any of the four nucleotides with a strong preference for ATP. This behavior was also reported for the A. fulgidus reverse gyrase (21Rodriguez A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29865-29873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The zinc motif mutant presented the same nucleotide preference, although the overall activity was decreased. Interestingly, the Q motif mutant presented different activity profiles than the wild type enzyme. Whereas the same activity was observed in the presence of TTP, this mutant was inactive in the presence of GTP. Furthermore, the Q motif mutant had lost the strong preference for ATP, and the same positive supercoiling activity was obtained with ATP or CTP, at a level observed for the wild type enzyme in the presence of CTP. This change of preference was also observed when 10 μm of either nucleotide was used in the assay. These results suggest that mutation in the Q motif alters the reverse gyrase nucleotide specificity. Analysis of DNA Binding and Cleavage Properties of Wild Type T. maritima Reverse Gyrase—We analyzed the DNA binding and cleavage properties of the wild type enzyme to access the first two steps of the topoisomerization reaction. Previous results indicated that reverse gyrase preferably binds ssDNA (30Slesarev A.I. Kozyavkin S.A. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 1990; 7: 935-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 31Shibata T. Nakasu S. Yasui K. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10419-10421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore used a 52-mer single-stranded oligonucleotide as substrate (Fig. 5A). This is composed of a T30-mer linked to a 22-mer fragment corresponding to the viral SSV1 DNA sequence that contains a preferred cleavage site for the Sulfolobus shibatae reverse gyrase (CATT↓ACTT) (29Jaxel C. Duguet M. Nadal M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The ability of the wild type reverse gyrase to bind and cleave this oligonucleotide was tested at 37, 65, and 80 °C (Fig. 5, B and C). The assay was performed at different reverse gyrase/DNA ratios (1Patel S.S. Donmez I. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18265-18268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 4Duguet M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1345-1350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, or 16Kampmann M. Stock D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 3537-3545Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and products were analyzed on a native polyacrylamide gel. As shown in Fig. 5B, the binding of reverse gyrase to the oligonucleotide is similar at 37 and 65 °C. As the amount of reverse gyrase increased, protein-DNA complexes that migrate with different electrophoretic mobilities were produced. At 80 °C, complex formation was reduced, indicating that reverse gyrase does not require high temperature for DNA binding, contrary to what we observed for the supercoiling activity (Fig. 2). To analyze the cleavage step, half of the reaction products from the mobility shift experimen"

Cysteine sulfhydryls within CCTalpha are needed for full catalytic activity. Here we show that prostaglandin 15-deoxy-Delta12,14-PGJ2 (15d-PGJ2) inactivates CCTalpha by inducing generation of reactive oxidant species and the appearance of a cross-linked CCTalpha dimer in cells. N-Acetyl-l-cysteine reduced oxidative stress, prevented CCTalpha cross-linking, and restored CCT function in 15d-PGJ2-treated cells. 15d-PGJ2 modified critical cysteine residues within CCTalpha as determined by mutagenesis studies and by incorporation of biotin-15d-PGJ2 into CCTalpha. These effects of 15d-PGJ2 were associated with CCTalpha accumulation within the nucleus. The data indicate that bioactive prostanoids significantly impair membrane phospholipid production by promoting cysteine cross-bridging within CCTalpha."
