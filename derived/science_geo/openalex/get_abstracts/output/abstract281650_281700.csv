https://openalex.org/W2041947822,"Surveys of recent (1973 to 1986) intentional releases of native birds and mammals to the wild in Australia, Canada, Hawaii, New Zealand, and the United States were conducted to document current activities, identify factors associated with success, and suggest guidelines for enhancing future work. Nearly 700 translocations were conducted each year. Native game species constituted 90 percent of translocations and were more successful (86 percent) than were translocations of threatened, endangered, or sensitive species (46 percent). Knowledge of habitat quality, location of release area within the species range, number of animals released, program length, and reproductive traits allowed correct classification of 81 percent of observed translocations as successful or not."

An intercomparison of 14 atmospheric general circulation models, for which sea surface temperature perturbations were used as a surrogate climate change, showed that there was a roughly threefold variation in global climate sensitivity. Most of this variation is attributable to differences in the models' depictions of cloud-climate feedback, a result that emphasizes the need for improvements in the treatment of clouds in these models if they are ultimately to be used as climatic predictors."

High growth rate in one species is correlated with reduction in number of palatable host species. This suggests a mechanism by which ecologically restricted species become progressively biochemically specialized."
https://openalex.org/W2043068792,"Dispersions of colloidal particles exhibit thermodynamic properties similar to those of molecular systems, including a hard sphere disorder-to-order transition. In experiments with organophilic silica in cyclohexane, gravity settling was used to concentrate the particles. With small particles the slow sedimentation permits rearrangement into the iridescent ordered phase, but larger particles form amorphous sediments instead. Scanning electron microscopy of the crystalline sediment indicates hexagonally closepacked layers. X-ray attenuation measurements reveal a discontinuity coincident with the observed boundary between iridescent and opaque regions. Sediments accumulating faster than the maximum rate of crystallization produce a glass, in accord with the classical theory for crystal growth."
https://openalex.org/W2031291586,"It is conjectured that Triton was captured from a heliocentric orbit as the result of a collision with what was then one of Neptune's regular satellites. The immediate post-capture orbit was highly eccentric with a semimajor axis a approximately 10(3)R(N) and a periapse distance rp that oscillated periodically above a minimum value of about 5R(N). Dissipation due to tides raised by Neptune in Triton caused Triton's orbit to evolve to its present state in less, similar10(9) years. For much of this time Triton was almost entirely molten. While its orbit was evolving, Triton cannibalized most of the regular satellites of Neptune and also perturbed Nereid, thus accounting for that satellite's highly eccentric and inclined orbit. The only regular satellites of Neptune that survived were those that formed well within 5R(N) and they move on inclined orbits as the result of chaotic perturbations forced by Triton. Neptune's arcs are confined around the corotation resonances of one of these inner satellites. The widths and lengths of the arcs imply that the satellite's radius is at least 30/(sin i)(2/3) kilometers for i less, similar 1, where i is the angle of inclination."

This inhibition effect exhibits crystallographic dependence and can result in superheating of the crystal by heat conduction across the ice-solution interface. The antifreeze molecules inhibit melting in a manner more or less symmetrical to their well-known effect of inhibiting freezing. The melting effect is best expressed at concave ice interfaces, whereas the freezing effect is best expressed at convex ones. Both are restricted to orientations near (1010) with the particular antifreeze that was used."
https://openalex.org/W2027545535,"Fatal crashes of private, business, and corporate-executive airplanes have increased after publicized murder-suicides. The more publicity given to a murder-suicide, the more crashes occurred. The increase in plane crashes occurred primarily in states where the murder-suicides were publicized. These findings suggest that murder-suicide stories trigger subsequent murder-suicides, some of which are disguised as airplane accidents."
https://openalex.org/W2019349293,Well-documented variations in the (15)N/(14)N ratio in lunar surface samples apparently result from a secular increase in that ratio in the solar wind during the past few billion years. The cause of this change seems to lie in the solar convective zone but is inexplicable within our present understanding of solar processes. This problem therefore ranks with the solar neutrino deficiency as a major challenge to our solar paradigm.
