https://openalex.org/W2094787900,"The atypical excitation by opiates and opioid peptides of hippocampal pyramidal cells can be antagonized by iontophoresis of naloxone, the gamma-aminobutyric acid antagonists bicuculline, or magnesium ion. The recurrent inhibition of these cells evoked by transcallosal stimulation of the contralateral hippocampus is blocked by enkephalin but only shortened by acetylcholine. The results suggest that the opioids excite pyramidal neurons indirectly by inhibition of neighboring inhibitory interneurons (probably containing gamma-aminobutyric acid). This mechanism may be pertinent to the electrographic signs of addictive drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2119575179,"Abstract The nature of the protein coat on clathrin-coated vesicles and the interactions responsible for the structure and reformation of clathrin baskets have been investigated. Coated vesicles were isolated from bovine brain using a rapid, one-day modification of the method of Pearse (1975). The vesicles are composed predominantly of clathrin (175,000) with smaller amounts of 110,000 and 55,000 molecular weight polypeptides. Clathrin was released in a solubilized form from these vesicles by treatment with 0.5 M Tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl ammonium chloride (Tris-Cl) or other protonated amines at neutral pH. It was not released on treatment with thiols, thiol reagents, Triton X-100 or sodium chloride, leading us to suggest that specific amino-carboxylate salt linkages are necessary for maintenance of the basket structure. When viewed by electron microscopy, the solubilized proteins in Tris-Cl are present in the form of filamentous aggregates and no basket structures are observed. Gel filtration of the extract in Tris-Cl resolves a clathrin-containing fraction (I) from one consisting predominantly of the 110,000 molecular weight polypeptide (II). We were able to reconstitute basket structures from the unfractionated Tris-Cl extract by dialyzing it against the vesicle isolation buffer, a solution of moderate ionic strength (Γ/2 = 0.11). Neither of the resolved fractions (I or II) alone yielded baskets on dialysis, but reconstitution was successful when both I and II were combined and dialyzed. The activity in II, which appears to be a basket-assembly factor, was heat-labile and could not be replaced by bovine serum albumin or brain calcium-dependent modulator protein. If a solution of low ionic strength (Γ/2 = 0.01) containing calcium was used as the dialysate, the clathrin fraction (I) alone was capable of reforming baskets. Thus the clathrin coat is a labile structure that can be solubilized by nondenaturing treatments, and baskets can be reformed from the extracted material."
https://openalex.org/W2042491847,"Abstract When the chromatin of Drosophila is examined by digestion with DNAase I or micrococcal nuclease, no general structural organization above the level of the nucleosome is revealed by the cleavage pattern. In contrast, the DNAase I cleavage pattern of specific regions of the Drosophila chromosome shows discrete bands with sizes ranging from a few kilobase pairs (kb) to more than 20 kb. Visualization of such higher order bands was achieved by the use of the Southern blotting technique. The DNAase I-cleaved fragments were transferred onto a nitrocellulose sheet after size fractionation by gel electrophoresis. Hybridization was then carried out with radioactively labeled cloned fragments of DNA from D. melanogaster. For the five different chromosomal regions examined, each gives a unique pattern of higher order bands on the autoradiogram; the patterns are different for different regions. Restriction enzyme cleavage of the fragments generated indicates that the preferential DNAase I cleavage sites in chromatin are position-specific. The chromosomal regions bounded by preferential DNAase I cleavage sites are referred to as supranucleosomal or higher order domains for purposes of discussion and analysis. The micrococcal nuclease cleavage pattern of chromatin at specific loci was also examined. In the one case studied in detail, this nuclease also cleaves at position-specific sites."
https://openalex.org/W2065423329,"We have analyzed the plasminogen activator (PA) content of normal rodent mammary glands at different stages of the mammary life cycle and after exposing the animals to various hormones; we have also assessed the PA response of mammary explants to a variety of hormonal environments. Similar studies were performed on a limited number of primary mammary tumors. Plasminogen activator production was clearly correlated with mammary involution. A large but transient increase in enzyme content followed the initiation of involution in all glands, and the enzyme was produced by mammary cells, not by macrophages or granulocytes. Oxytocin, prolactin and hydrocortisone, which slowed or blocked involution, produced parallel effects on gland regression and PA synthesis. PA synthesis by explants in organ culture was induced by hormonal environments that fostered involution and repressed by those that promoted lactation. Mammary tumors produced much more PA than normal tissue both in vivo and in vitro, and distinct differences were found in the response of enzyme synthesis to hormones. The results reinforce the association of PA with tissue remodeling; show that the enzyme can be used as an indicator of cellular response to a wide range of hormones in both normal and malignant tissue; and suggest that observations of this type in organ culture may be of some value in predicting physiological responses in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2063322107,"Department of Biological Sciences State University of New York at Albany Albany, New York 12222 lnterferons are glycoproteins secreted by virus-in- fected cells which promote the establishment of an antiviral state in uninfected cells (Finter, 1973). Treat- ment of animal cells in culture with interferon reduces their ability to support replication of RNA and DNA viruses by mechanisms that are not yet understood. Early investigations of the mechanism of interferon action were carried out with virus-infected cells (re- viewed by Friedman, 1977). These studies showed an inhibition of accumulation and/or translation of viral templates, but failed to reveal the causes of this inhi- bition. Recent work has focused on the enzymatic differences between extracts of interferon-treated and control cells reported by several investigators. The precise relationship between these enzymatic activi- ties and the establishment of the antiviral state has not yet been clarified, but it seems probable that some explanation for the molecular basis of the antiviral state will be forthcoming shortly. Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is the most potent inducer of interferon synthesis (reviewed by Colby and Morgan, 1971). Both synthetic and viral dsRNAs induce synthesis and secretion of interferon in animal cells (see Torrence and De Clercq, 1977). These facts led to the hypothesis that double-stranded replicating viral RNA (the “replicative intermediate” formed by RNA viruses) triggers interferon synthesis by an un- known mechanism. Replicative intermediate obtained from mengovirus-infected cells is indeed an effective inducer of interferon synthesis (Falcoff and Falcoff, 1970). The enormous potency of dsRNA in its inter- action with the cell has been elegantly shown by Marcus and Sekellick (1977). A single defective inter- fering particle of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) con- taining dsRNA can induce synthesis of interferon. The defective interfering particle is thought to inject into a cell a single molecule of dsRNA, which is sufficient to induce interferon synthesis. Moreover, dsRNA is a potent inhibitor of protein synthesis in extracts of interferon-treated cells (Kerr, Brown and Ball, 1974). Investigations of this enhanced sensitivity to inhibition by dsRNA led to the discovery of two interferon-in- duced dsRNA-dependent enzymatic activities (Figure 1 )-an oligonucleotide polymerase, which synthe- sizes a series of oligonucleotides containing unusual 2’5’phosphodiester bonds from ATP (Kerr and Brown, 1978) and a protein kinase, which phosphorylates the small subunit of initiation factor elF-2 (Farrell et al., 1977). The product of the oligonucleotide polym- erase, pppA(2’p5’A). (designated here 2’5’oligo(A) or 2,5A), is the activator of an endoribonuclease (Cle- mens and Williams, 1978; Eppstein and Samuel, 1978; Baglioni, Minks and Maroney, 1978b; Ratner et al., 1978; Zilberstein et al., 1978). The enzymatic activity which synthesizes the oligonucleotides is des- ignated 2,5A polymerase. This review focuses on recent work on the protein kinase and 2,5A polymerase/endoribonuclease sys- tem and describes studies examining the stability of 2,5A in cell extracts. These studies may help us to understand how the endoribonuclease functions in virus-infected interferon-treated cells. Other studies on the inhibition of viral mRNA methylation (Sen et al., 1975, 1977) are also briefly described. Although mechanism of this inhibition has not yet been char- acterized at the molecular level, it is discussed here because it is an interferon-dependent activity in ceil extracts which does not require addition of dsRNA. Inhibition of viral mRNA methylation may also provide an explanation for impairment of its translation."
https://openalex.org/W2032536951,"We have compared the chromatin structure in the active and inactive states at loci encoding the major heat shock protein in Drosophila. DNAase I and micrococcal nuclease were used as probes of higher order organization and nucleosomal integrity. Such integrity is gauged here by the characteristic pattern of discrete DNA fragments produced at specific chromosomal loci by nucleolytic cleavage. The specific fragment patterns are visualized by gel electrophoresis, Southern blotting onto nitrocellulose sheets, hybridization with 32P-labeled cloned DNA containing the heat shock genes and autoradiography. Using this criterion, a disruption in nucleosomal and possibly in higher order organization are observed as indicated by a relative loss or smearing of the characteristic discrete DNA fragment patterns from the heat shock loci in the active state. The fragment patterns are restored when cells are allowed to recover from heat shock and these loci return to the inactive state."
https://openalex.org/W1988361400,"Cultured diploid human skin fibroblasts were fractionated by a procedure that maximizes recovery of particles containing acid hydrolases. The cells were detached by controlled trypsinization, disrupted by N2 cavitation at low pressure and fractionated at 18,000 x g on a self-generating gradient of colloidal silica. This procedure separated two species of particles that could be consisered lysosomal. The denser one (peak density 1.11) was apparently free of other contaminants, but the more buoyant one (peak density 1.085) sedimented with or close to the peaks of other organelles, including mitochondria, Golgi, endoplasmic reticulum and plasma membranes. The two populations of particles contained acid hydrolases (phosphatase, six glycosidases and four cathepsins) in roughly equal proportions, displayed latency, had similar turnover of 35S-mucopolysaccharide in normal as well as in iduronidase-deficient cells, and were recipients of alpha-L-iduronidase, previously shown to be acquired by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Acid phosphatase staining of the intact fibroblasts showed residual bodies scattered throughout the cytoplasm and, near the nucleus, a prominent network of tubules and associated dilatations and knob-like enlargements. In both thin and thick sections, these appeared continuous, as if forming a three-dimensional network similar to the network described by Novikoff (1976) as GERL. Ultrastructural studies of the isolated fractions showed the denser lysosomal peak to be composed of small round or oblong acid phosphatase-positive bodies. The more buoyant peak contained the nonlysosomal organelles predicted from the biochemical markers, small acid phosphatase-positive bodies and large multivesiculated structures in which acid phosphatase was localized in a matrix surrounding apparently empty vesicles. These large structures may represent fragments of GERL. We suggest that the dense and buoyant lysosomal organelles originate primarily from residual bodies and the GERL network, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1987623343,"Colchicine and nocadazole both depolymerize microtubules in cultured fibroblasts and lead to a rapid inhibition of tubulin synthesis. The level of translatable tubulin mRNA is greatly reduced in drug-treated cells as demonstrated by translation in a reticulocyte-derived in vitro protein synthesizing system. A model of tubulin synthesis regulation is proposed in which the elevated level of unpolymerized tubulin in drug-treated cells inhibits the formation of new tubulin mRNA and the preexisting message decays rapidly. In agreement with this model, tubulin message is found to be short-lived and has an approximately 2 hr half-life in cells treated with actinomycin D. Another prediction of the proposed model is that destabilization of microtubules without a concomitant increase in free tubulin will not inhibit tubulin synthesis. Vinblastine also disrupts microtubules but leads to the aggregation of tubulin into large paracrystals with an apparent decrease in the concentration of free tubulin. This drug does not inhibit tubulin production but rather leads to a measurable enhancement of tubulin synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2048385749,"An analbuminemic colony was established from Sprague-Dawley rats. Analbuminemia was inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. The rates of growth and reproduction of the mutant rats were no different from those of normal rats. Biochemically, the mutant was characterized by an extraordinarily low serum albumin content and a hyperlipidemia. Total serum protein in the mutant rat was similar to that of control Sprague-Dawley rats, with increased globulin. Serum cholesterol was inversely correlated with a decrease in albumin; the correlation coefficient for ablumin was -.92. These mutant rats may serve as a model of human familial analbuminemia and may also be useful in elucidating the functional roles of albumin."
https://openalex.org/W2016971995,"One-day-old rat pups learned to probe upward into a terry-cloth-covered paddle when they were rewarded with small infusions of milk into their mouths. In the presence of two paddles, discriminable on the basis of odor and position in the test container, the pups learned to probe into the paddle that provided them with milk. These experiments demonstrate (i) that milk may serve as a reinforcer to deprived rat pups and (ii) that pups as young as 1 day are capable of appetitive learning."
https://openalex.org/W2041883615,"A detailed restriction map was constructed for a cloned Xenopus laevis rDNA fragment containing the nontranscribed spacer (NTS) and external transcribed spacer (ETS) together with a portion of both the 18S and 28S rRNA genes. The NTS was found to contain at least three distinct repetitious areas. Region 1 has a repeating unit of approximately 100 bp. The primary structure of this unit has been determined by DNA sequencing. Region 2 is very similar in organization to region 3, and both have an alternating bp arrangement as revealed by restriction with Alu I and DNA sequencing. It can be shown that the 81 and 60 bp canons are virtually identical to one another excepting a deletion/insertion of a 21 bp segment. Region 3 differs from region 2 in having sites for Sma I within its 81 bp units. Between these repeated DNA sequences there are two identical, nonrepetitive DNA sequences, each of which is centered around a Bam HI site. Most of the ETS has been sequenced. It was found to be nonrepetitive and extremely rich in Cs. Close to the 5′ end of the 18S coding sequence there is a DNA stretch very rich in purines. About 2.25 kb upstream from the Eco RI restriction site bisecting the 18S structural gene there is a unique sequence which may be homologous to the 5′ end of the 40S precursor RNA. Present evidence suggests that the boundaries between NTS and ETS occur farther downstream than was suggested by electron microscopic data. Sequencing has revealed that the spacer DNA of X. laevis contains different kinds of simple DNA sequences, but no evidence has been found that spacer DNA once arose by saltation of a 15 bp segment. The most surprising finding was that the spacer sequences around the Bam restriction sites (the Bam islands) show high homology with a sequence near the NTS/ETS interface. From the restriction and sequencing analyses it can be deduced that in recent evolutionary times the DNA sequences near the 5′ end of the ribosomal transcription unit were reduplicated twice and displaced into spacer by saltation of an intervening short DNA sequence (the bp canons). Possible implications of these evolutionary events for spacer functions are considered. The sequencing has also provided a molecular basis for a whole range of conclusions arrived at previously by indirect approaches, and these are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1991112068,"Vitellogenin, the yolk protein precursor, is produced in X. laevis liver from a 6.3 kilobase (kb) mRNA. Sequences of this mRNA have been transcribed into cDNA and cloned in E. coli. Some properties of 21 of these cloned DNAs, ranging in size from 1 to 3.7 kb, have been reported by Wahli et al. (1978b). This paper reports restriction endonuclease mapping, cross hybridization, heteroduplex mapping in the electron microscope and heteroduplex melting experiments with these DNAs. We conclude that the cloned DNAs fall into two main groups of sequences which differ from each other in approximately 20% of their nucleotides. Each main group contains two subgroups which differ from each other by about 5% sequence divergence. By hybridizing cloned DNAs with restricted genomic DNA, we showed that sequences corresponding to all four sequence groups are present in a single animal. Furthermore, we have obtained tentative evidence for the presence of large intervening sequences in genomic vitellogenin DNA. Analysis of R loop molecules demonstrated that all four sequences are present in the vitellogenin mRNA population purified from individual animals. While some alternate explanations are not entirely excluded, we suggest that vitellogenin is encoded by a small family of related genes in Xenopus."
https://openalex.org/W2156120212,"Fiber mRNA of adenovirus 2 has been used as a template for RNA-dependent DNA polymerase. The resulting cDNA/RNA hybrids have been inserted at the Pst I site of the plasmid vector pBR322 after A:T tailing. One recombinant plasmid, pJAW 43, has been characterized in detail and shown to contain sequences from the main body of fiber mRNA, the three leaders common to most late adenoviral mRNAs and a fourth leader found in some species of fiber mRNA. The complete DNA sequence of the leader region has been determined and does not contain the initiation codon AUG, although this codon does occur immediately downstream from the junction between the fourth leader and the main body of the fiber mRNA. The first leader (map coordinate 16.6) is 41 nucleotides long, the second (from 19.6) is 71 nucleotides, the third (from 26.6) is 88 nucleotides and the fourth (from 78.5) is 181 nucleotides. The location of junctions between viral leaders and intervening sequences has been determined by reference, where possible, to sequences of the adenovirus 2 genome. Although the presence of short repeated sequences at the boundaries of intervening sequences and leaders makes it impossible to locate the splice point unambiguously, all of the leader-intervening sequence junctions can be arranged to stress a common feature--the presence of the dinucleotides GT and AG at the 5' and 3' ends, respectively, of the intervening sequences. This prototype sequence, which has also been recognized at or near the splice points in other eucaryotic systems, is possibly part of a larger unit which serves as a recognition site for specific excision-ligation events that ultimately lead to the production of mature mRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W1995812802,"Study of Asians has previously indicated that deletion of alpha-globin structural genes is the predominant lesion in alpha-thalassemias and that Hb H disease occurs when three of four normal alpha loci per cell are deleted. To test the generality of this model, Hb H disease DNAs of both Asian and non-Asian origin were analyzed by restriction endonuclease mapping using the technique of Southern (1975). Whereas in normal DNA, alpha sequences are present in a single Eco Rl fragment of cellular DNA approximately 22.5 kb long, fragments of 22.5, 20 and 2.6 kb were found in various Hb H disease DNAs. The 20 kb Eco Rl fragment alone, in which a single alpha-globin structural locus resides, was found in Asian Hb H disease DNA. This finding is consistent with the deletion model of alpha-thalassemia. In contrast, seven of eight non-Asian Hb H disease DNAs displayed a more complex molecular composition. The fragment patterns observed were 22.5 kb alone, 22.5 plus 2.6 kb, 20 plus 2.6 kb and 20 kb alone. Non-Asian Hb H disease DNAs contained one, two or three alpha loci per cell in contrast to the one locus predicted by the simple deletion model of alpha-thalassemia. The data are best explained by the existence of defective alpha loci in certain individuals with alpha-thalassemia, particularly outside the Asian population. Restriction mapping of the 20 kb Eco Rl fragment found in Asian and some non-Asian Hb H disease DNAs demonstrated a striking similarity in the placement of restriction sites about the single alpha gene compared with sites about the two genes in the 22.5 kb Eco Rl fragment seen in normal DNA. These data are consistent with origin of the 20 kb fragment from the 22.5 kb normal Eco Rl fragment by either unequal crossing-over or a deletion event. The molecular heterogeneity and frequent occurrence of defective alpha loci in non-Asian Hb H disease DNAs described here may explain, in part, the clinical heterogeneity of alpha-thalassemias and the absence of the homozygous deletion state (hydrops fetalis) in non-Asians. Further study of cellular DNA fragments containing the defective alpha loci identified in this work may indicate the types of specific mutations responsible for abnormal globin gene expression and complement similar studies on abnormal beta genes in beta-thalassemias."
https://openalex.org/W2014236276,"In this study, the growth of rat follicular (RF-1) cells was severely depressed when the cells were subcultured by trypsinization directly into serum-free medium supplemented with insulin, transferrin and hydrocortisone, which are required for growth of these cells in vitro. Within 24 hr after plating, 50–65% of the cells became binucleated, indicating lack of cytokinesis. However, the addition of human plasma fibronectin (8 μg/ml) to the serum-free medium eliminated cell binucleation and enhanced cell growth considerably. Fibronectin had the same effect when RF-1 cells were plated into tissue culture dishes on which fibronectin had been adsorbed, and cells were inoculated into fibronectin-free medium. Cell binucleation and poor growth in serum-free medium occurred when the cells were subcultured by trypsinization, EGTA treatment or detachment of mitotic cells. Under some conditions, cells could be “rescued” if fibronectin was added soon after inoculation, indicating that fibronectin was needed mainly during a limited time when the subcultured cells were attaching to the tissue culture substratum. Our findings describe an adhesive activity for fibronectin which circumvents the serum preincubation usually needed after RF-1 cells are subcultured for growth in serum-free medium. They also indicate the importance of fibronectin-mediated adhesion for cytokinesis processes of these cells."
https://openalex.org/W2082100448,"An intervening sequence of approximately 400 bp has been discovered in the 25S ribosomal RNA gene (rDNA) from macronuclei of Tetrahymena pigmentosa strain 6UM. Another strain, 8ALP, lacks the intervening sequence in its macronuclear rDNA. The presence of the intervening sequence was first suggested by a comparison of the restriction endonuclease maps of the rDNA from each strain. A region which differed in size between the two strains was shown to lie within the region coding for 25S ribosomal RNA by hybridization of the restriction fragments to labeled 25S rRNA. Direct visual evidence for the existence of the intervening sequence in 6UM and its absence from 8ALP was obtained by electron microscopy of R loop hybrids formed between the rDNA and 25S rRNA. The size and position of the intervening sequence within the gene were further defined by detailed restriction analyses of cloned fragments of the rDNA from each strain. The rDNA within the macronucleus of each of these strains is homogeneous, and thus the intervening sequence in the rDNA of strain 6UM must not interfere with transcription of the gene. Furthermore, the presence or absence of the intervening sequence has no obvious functional importance, since both strains can survive and grow equally well."

In contrast, the catecholamine fluorescence in the periadventitial layer of the arcuate arteries is derived from norepinephrine. The dopamine-containing structures may represent the prejunctional counterpart to the pharmacologically identified dopamine receptors in the renal vasculature. As such, this system may be involved in the normal regulation of renal blood flow and renin release."
https://openalex.org/W1998118848,"The location of type IV (basement membrane) collagen in early post-implantation mouse embryos was examined by immunoperoxidase reactions using a specific immunoglobulin raised against mouse lens capsule collagen. Reaction was positive in the earliest embryos studied—on the fifth day of gestation (the day of detection of the copulation plug is the first day). It was found only in the primitive endoderm adjacent to the blastocoelic cavity. Subsequently in development, strong staining reactions were found in the parietal endoderm, Reichert's membrane and an acellular layer which separates the visceral endoderm of the egg cylinder from the ectoderm. In tenth to eighteenth day visceral yolk sacs, the mesodermal portion was stained, which is consistent with the presence of basement membranes around blood vessels. The endodermal portion of the visceral yolk sac did not react, while small amounts were found in the amnion. By incubation of various embryonic tissues with tritiated amino acids, purification of the biosynthesized secreted collagens and their partial characterization, the differential expression of several collagen genes was detected. Identification of collagen types was made by: reaction with specific antibodies to type I and IV collagens; electrophoretic mobility; sensitivity to reduction and to collagenase; analysis of the proportions of 3-hydroxyproline, 4-hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine; and CNBr peptides. In agreement with the data of Minor et al., 1976a Minor R.R. Clark C.C. Strause E.L. Koszalka T.R. Brent R.L. Kefalides N.A.

The endoderm of the visceral yolk sac was shown to be synthesizing primarily type I collagen, while the mesoderm layer of this membrane synthesized both type I and IV collagens. Little or no type IV collagen synthesis was detected in the endoderm of the visceral yolk sac. If it is correct that the visceral endoderm of the early embryo makes a major contribution to the formation of the endoderm portion of the visceral yolk sac, then it is clear that a switch in collagen gene expression must occur as it does so."
https://openalex.org/W1991135925,"The technique of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was used to identify a major testicular cell protein, p63/6.9, which is specified by a gene (p63) within the mouse T/t complex on chromosome 17. A wild-type gene causes the expression of one form of this protein, p63/6.9b. All lethal and semilethal t haplotypes derived from wild mice cause the expression of an apparently identical alternate allelic form of the p63/6.9 protein. This protein, p63/6.9a, represents the first t haplotype-specific molecule to be biochemically identified. A dominant haplotype (THp) acts as a null allele of the p63 gene; this unique behavior provides additional evidence for the interpretation of THp as a deletion within the T/t region of chromosome 17. Limited proteolysis of viable testicular cells causes selective cleavage of the p63/6.9 proteins, relative to other detergent-soluble testicular cell proteins known to be internal. This result strongly suggests that p63/6.9 proteins are located on the cell surface. Qualitative and quantitative estimates indicate that p63/6.9 is one of the most prominent proteins on the testicular cell surface. p63/6.9 is expressed in all other mouse cell types analyzed but at greatly reduced levels. Partial t haplotypes obtained from infrequent recombination events were used to map the p63 gene close to the dominant mutation T and separate from the lethal factors of t haplotypes. A 100% correlation was observed between the expression of p63/6.9a and the genetic presence of the tail interaction factor of t haplotypes. The significance of this correlation in terms of the evolution of t haplotypes among wild mice is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1964592653,"Using the genomic clones of the fibroin gene with its flanking sequences, a detailed restriction map was prepared with particular attention given to the region neighboring the 5' end of the gene. About 60% of the fibroin mRNA has a complete cap (m7GpppAmUmCXG), and the remaining 40% has an unmethylated cap (GpppAPyXXG). The latter can be radioactively labeled by the use of vaccinia capping enzymes. Using the labeled mRNA, we mapped the 5' end of the gene by hybridization to restriction enzyme digests. DNA sequencing of this region revealed a sequence ATCAGCATCAG that corresponds to ApyXXG in tandem. The 5' end of mRNA with a complete cap was also located in these 11 nucleotides. Since the second ATCAG region was protected from S1 digestion following hybridization with total fibroin mRNA, we have tentatively assigned it as the sole 5' end of the transcription unit. About 700 bp were sequenced in the region from -800 + 1700 bp. The region of about 210 bp preceding the 5' end of the gene which may accommodate a promoter sequence is very AT-rich and contains clusters of A and T residues. This region contains statistically significant dyad symmetries, direct repeats and inverted repeats. At -30 to -24, the sequence TATAAAA was observed, and this is similar to a Pribnow-type sequence (TATAGATG). The sequence that codes for the gly-ala repetitious peptide characteristic of fibroin begins somewhere between 1340 and 1600 bp from the 5' end. An intervening sequence of about 1.1 kb that interrupts the gene about 70 bp from the 5' end was detected by R loop formation. Structures of the fibroin gene cloned from fibroin producing and nonproducing cells look the same, especially around the 5' end and the intervening region."
https://openalex.org/W2050237848,"The methodology of density labeling of proteins by biosynthetic incorporation of 2H, 13C, 15N-amino acids into newly synthesized polypeptide chains allows the direct measurement of the turnover rate of the acetylcholine receptor in cultured chick skeletal muscle. In this study, receptors synthesized in medium containing 2H, 13C, 15N-amino acids were resolved from 1H, 12C, 14N-receptors by velocity sedimentation in sucrose-deuterium oxide gradients, and their proportions were determined by computer analysis of the gradient profiles. The kinetics of turnover of acetylcholine receptors are identical for developing chick muscle fibers grown in medium containing 2H, 13C, 15N-amino acids or 1H, 12C, 14N-amino acids, and the high degree of substitution of normal aminoacyl residues by 2H, 13C, 15N-residues does not affect the turnover rate of the denser receptor. Comparison of the turnover rates in continuous and pulse-labeling experiments gave independent confirmation of these results. The application of a potent, essentially irreversible blocking agent, α-bungarotoxin, increases the median lifetime of receptors from 17 hr for the native unbound receptor to 22 hr for the α-bungarotoxin-receptor complex. As predicted, the total number of α-bungarotoxin binding sites increased in the continued presence of α-bungarotoxin due to extension of receptor lifetime. To determine whether other cholinergic agents affect the turnover rate of the receptor, measurements were performed on cultures grown in the presence of 10−4 M d-tubocurare of 10−4 M carbachol, a reversible antagonist and a reversible agonist, respectively, of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. The receptor degradation rates of the drug-treated cells were identical to control values. The total number of α-bungarotoxin binding sites was reduced by 30% in the presence of carbachol, indicating that this agent affects the rate of synthesis of the acetylcholine receptor. Data formerly interpreted as suggesting a cycling of receptor-containing plasma membrane out of and back into the sarcolemma are now understood to reflect the alteration in receptor lifetime upon complexing with α-bungarotoxin. The intracellular “hidden” receptor sites were found to remain inside the myotubes and thus do not signify an intracellular pool of recycling plasma membrane."

https://openalex.org/W2009523035,"Both linear (form III) and closed circular (form I) viral DNAs obtained from mouse cells infected with Moloney murine leukemia virus were cleaved by Sal I, Sma I, Bam HI and Pst I restriction endonucleases. DNA fragments generated by these cleavages were ordered with respect to the 5' and 3' ends of the RNA genome by several techniques, including comparisons of the DNA fragments from cleavages of the linear and closed circular forms, double digestions using different combinations of enzymes and the use of an RNA probe specific for the 3' end. DNA from Hirt extractions of infected cells yielded a discrete species of linear viral DNA whose size was determined by agarose gel electrophoresis to be 5.7 x 10(6) daltons. In the course of characterizing the closed circular DNA, we observed two form I DNA molecules. The larger molecule was the same size as the linear DNA. The second molecule migrated faster on agarose gels and was the predominant species of the two closed circular DNAs. Using the restriction endonuclease maps which we derived, we demonstrate that this novel form I DNA is a smaller homogeneous species of viral DNA, missing about 600 nucleotides found in the linear and larger closed circular DNA molecules. We have localized the site of this missing DNA piece to be at either one or both ends of the linear viral DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2051503669,"By examining microtubule regrowth using immunofluorescence with antibody to tubulin, we have studied the structure and intracellular localization of microtubule initiation sites in undifferentiated and differentiated mouse neuroblastoma cells. The undifferentiated cells are round and lack cell processes. They contain an average of 12 initiation sites per cell. Each of these sites, which are located near the cell nucleus, initiates the growth of several microtubules in a radial formation. In contrast to the undifferentiated cells, neuroblastoma cells stimulated to differentiate by serum deprivation are asymmetrical, containing one or two very long neurites. These cells have a single, large microtubule initiation center which can be visualized not only by immunofluorescence but by phase-contrast and differential interference microscopy as well. The initiation site measures 3-4 mu in diameter and is located in the cell body along a line defined by the neurite. During cell differentiation, the large initiation, the large initiation center seems to be formed by the aggregation of many smaller sites. This process procedes neurite extension by about 24 hr. The growth of microtubules from this center appears to be highly oriented, since most microtubules initially grow into the neurite processes rather than into the cell interior. Thus major changes in the structure and location of microtubule initiation sites occur during the differentiation of neuroblastoma cells. Similar changes are likely to be involved in alterations in the morphology of other cell types."
https://openalex.org/W2036453935,"The nonhistone chromosomal protein HMG1 associated rapidly with the nuclei of HeLa cells and bovine fibroblasts following its introduction into the cytoplasm by red cell-mediated microinjection. A number of non-nuclear proteins, on the other hand, failed to concentrate in HeLa or bovine fibroblast nuclei. Autoradiography of thin sections showed that 1251-labeled HMG1 localized within nuclei, and further established that it remained associated with metaphase chromosomes at mitosis. When uninjected HeLa cells were fused with 125l-HMG1-injected HeLa cells, the labeled molecules equilibrated between nuclei within 12 hr. Similar results were obtained with bovine fibroblasts, indicating that a dynamic equilibrium exists between HMG1 and chromatin within living cells. Electrophoresis of 125l-HMG1 retrieved from HeLa cells or bovine fibroblasts up to 48 hr after injection showed that more than 80% of the molecules were intact. Autoradiographic analysis of cells fixed over a period of several days after injection produced apparent half-lives for 125l-HMG1 of 80 hr in HeLa cells and 100 hr in bovine fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W2150382846,"The pattern of microtubule regrowth in mammalian fibroblast and epithelial cells has been examined by immunofluorescence of cytoskeletal preparations with antibody to tubulin. After reversal of treatment with colcemid, vinblastine or low temperature, microtubules appear to grow simultaneously from several distinct initiation sites located within 5 microns of the nucleus of mouse and human fibroblasts. Each site initiates the growth of 10-30 microtubules. More than 70% of the mouse fibroblasts have between 5 and 10 initiation sites with an average of 8. The human fibroblasts have an average of 5 sites per cell. The average number and numerical distribution of sites per fibroblast cell are not affected by time of exposure to colcemid or the concentration of colcemid applied to the cells. Multiple microtubule initiation sites are also observed during the process of microtubule depolymerization. In addition to growth from these complex initiation sites, microtubules appear to grow singly from the perinuclear region of human fibroblasts. The regrowth of individual microtubules from the perinuclear growth is especially prominent in epithelial cell lines from rat kangaroo and pig. These epithelial lines have only a single complex initiation site per cell. Two classes of complex initiation sites can be distinguished in microtubule regrowth experiments in human and mouse fibroblasts after exposure to griseofulvin. Microtubules first grow extensively from a single distinct site, which has approximately 20 microtubules growing from it and may be the centriole or centriolar pair. Subsequently, microtubules regrow from other perinuclear complex initiation sites. It thus appears that at least three distinct classes of initiation sites can be observed in mammalian cells: primary sites, which regrow microtubules first after griseofulvin treatment; secondary sites, which are distinct perinuclear sites and recover from griseofulvin treatment more slowly than the primary sites; and tertiary sites or sites of growth of single microtubules, also located near the cell nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W2164413892,"Soluble 125I-labeled type I collagen binds to cultured fibroblasts but not to cultured epithelia. The binding of the ligand to fibroblasts is reversible, saturable and highly specific for sequences contained within the helical portions of the alpha1 and alpha2 chains. The amount of ligand bound is dependent upon cell number and ligand concentration. Binding is decreased but measurable at 4 degrees C. The steady state binding is greater at 26 degrees than at 37 degrees C due to a more rapid dissociation of the ligand-acceptor complex at 37 degrees C. The half-life of the complex is 46 min at 37 degrees C and approximately 2.5 hr at 26 degrees C. Scatchard plots of binding data indicate a single class of high affinity binding sites (KD = 1.2 X 10(-11) M) with each fibroblast binding approximately 500,000 molecules at saturation. Pretreatment of fibroblasts with bacterial collagenase, chondroitinase ABC or testicular hyaluronidase does not affect the binding reaction, whereas pretreatment of the cells with phospholipase C increases the amount of ligand bound. Ligand binding is decreased but not abolished after fibroblasts are treated with trypsin concentrations which remove surface fibronectin. Fibroblast monolayers treated with antiserum against fibronectin bind the radiolabeled ligand normally. In contrast to collagen, addition of excess fibronectin does not accelerate the dissociation of bound ligand from fibroblasts. Possible functions for surface-bound collagen are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2019178444,"The complete nucleotide sequence of the 5′ non-coding region of the adenovirus 2 hexon messenger RNA has been established by sequence analysis of reverse transcripts. Such transcripts were generated by extension of specific single-stranded DNA primers with reverse transcriptase after hybridization to purified hexon mRNA. The total length of the 5′ noncoding region was determined to be 240 nucleotides, of which the spliced tripartite leader sequence contributes 202 nucleotides including the terminal m7G. The sizes of the different segments of the tripartite leader were estimated by comparing the established mRNA sequence with the genomic sequences for the first and third leader segments, and were found to be 42 nucleotides for the first segment, 71 nucleotides for the second and 89 nucleotides for the third. The estimates are ambiguous, however, due to the presence of tandemly repeated sequences at both ends of the intervening sequence between the third leader segment and the body of the hexon mRNA. The sequence of the leader allows the formation of hydrogen-bonded interactions with the 3′ end of 18S ribosomal RNA near the capped 5′ end and also close to the initiator AUG."

https://openalex.org/W2006309842,"Deciliated starved Tetrahymena recover motility with kinetics similar to those of growing cells and, like growing cells, require RNA and protein synthesis for regeneration. Comparisons of polysome profiles and electrophoretic analyses of newly synthesized proteins indicate, however, that the basal level of protein synthesis in starved cells is markedly lower than that in growing cells. This difference allows demonstration of changes in protein synthesis following deciliation of starved cells which cannot be detected (if they occur at all) in growing cells. Deciliation of starved cells induces a specific and orderly program of protein synthesis. The synthesis of an 80,000 dalton protein (deciliation-induced protein, DIP) begins shortly after deciliation, comprises 15% of the protein synthesized from 20–60 min, and declines around 60 min after deciliation, shortly after most cells have begun to regenerate cilia. The synthesis of a 55,000 dalton protein is also induced during regeneration and has been identified as tubulin using a well characterized antibody made to ciliary tubulin. Tubulin synthesis is undetectable during the first hour after deciliation even though 60–80% of the cells regain mobility and regenerate short but clearly visible cilia. Tubulin synthesis begins 60 min after deciliation and continues for 2 hr. At its peak, tubulin comprises 7–8% of the protein synthesized. The results of actinomycin D addition at different times after decillation suggest that RNA required for DIP synthesis is synthesized early (0–30 min), while RNA required for tubulin is synthesized later and over a longer period (30–90 min). Thus deciliation of starved cells, an event occurring at the cell periphery, initiates a well defined and reproducible series of events culminating in cilia formation. This system should be useful in elucidating the molecular mechanisms regulating gene expression and organelle biogenesis in Tetrahymena."

DNA/DNA heteroduplex and restriction enzyme analyses of alterations in the genome of bacteriophage lambda suggest that both types of DNA alterations almost always originate at the internal termini of the 1400 bp terminal inverted repetitions of Tn10. Tn10-promoted deletions remove a single contiguous DNA segment beginning at one such terminus; Tn10-promoted inversions are more complex, and involve both an inversion and a specific deletion of Tn10 DNA."

https://openalex.org/W2057895567,"A system has been developed for the detailed analysis of the transition from proliferative myoblast to differentiated muscle cell. Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) prevents the terminal differentiation of L8 myoblasts in vitro, and its effect is reversible. DMSO (2%) inhibits the fusion of myoblasts to form multinucleate myotubes, the normal increases in activity of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and acetylcholinesterase, and the synthesis of α-actin and acetylcholine receptor protein. Upon removal of DMSO from the medium, a lag precedes the onset of differentiation. The potential to inhibit muscle differentiation reversibly is not specific to DMSO, but is shared by a number of compounds, including dimethylformamide, hexamethylbisacetamide and butyric acid, all potent inducers of gene expression in Friend erythroleukemia cells. L8 cells routinely cease DNA synthesis and initiate fusion and muscle protein synthesis once they are confluent. In the presence of DMSO, however, nearly all cells continue DNA synthesis, even several days after reaching confluence. Protein synthetic patterns of DMSO-inhibited cells are almost indistinguishable from those of untreated myoblasts and distinct from differentiated myotubes. It appears that cells exposed to DMSO are locked indefinitely in a proliferative myoblast stage of development and are unable to enter the G0 phase of the cell cycle necessary for initiation of differentiation. DMSO coordinately inhibits all the differentiative parameters measured. In contrast, cytochalasin B uncouples normally linked differentiative events so that fusion is inhibited while muscle-specific protein synthesis proceeds. DMSO has similar effects on both cytochalasin B-treated and fusing control cultures, suggesting that its primary effect is exerted not at the level of fusion but earlier in the differentiative timetable. Once fusion and the synthesis of muscle-specific proteins are well under way, the addition of DMSO is ineffective and differentiation continues in its presence. The potential to manipulate muscle gene expression in vitro makes this system particularly useful for the detailed analysis of the processes involved in the transition to the differentiated state and for determining the linkage of developmental events."
https://openalex.org/W2106359341,"Abstract The pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex was purified from B. stearothermophilus. The enzyme was found to be of high molecular weight (s 20,w 0 = 75S) and to contain four different types of polypeptide chain, with subunit molecular weights estimated as 57,000, 54,000, 42,000 and 36,000, respectively. The subunit of molecular weight 57,000 was shown to derive from the lipoate acetyltransferase component (EC 2.3.1.12), whereas the subunit of molecular weight 54,000 was identified as lipoamide dehydrogenase (EC 1.6.4.3). The other two polypeptide chains are likely to be the subunits of pyruvate decarboxylase (EC 1.2.4.1). The purified lipoate acetyltransferase component was also of high molecular weight (s 20,w 0 = 35S), and both it and the intact enzyme complex were readily visualized in negatively-stained preparations in the electron microscope. The lipoate acetyltransferase component, in particular, clearly showed the 5 fold, 3 fold and 2 fold rotation axes of a regular pentagonal dodecahedron with a diameter of 23 nm. The symmetry of the enzyme complex is apparently icosahedral. In all these properties the enzyme from B. stearothermophilus (Gram-positive) strikingly resembles the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex from the mitochondria of eucaryotic cells, and stands in marked contrast to the enzyme from E. coli (Gram-negative). A growing body of evidence indicates that the quaternary structures of enzymes from Gram-positive bacteria and the mitochondria of eucaryotes share distinctive common features that set them apart from the corresponding enzymes from Gram-negative bacteria. Adopting the serial endosymbiosis theory for the evolution of the mitochondrion, it follows that the forerunner of mitochondria may have been a Gram-positive rather than a Gram-negative bacterium."
https://openalex.org/W1995883595,"M4 is a recombinant plasmid containing Dictyostelium nuclear DNA. The restriction map has been determined (K. Kindle and R. Firtel, manuscript submitted) and the four major fragments have been subcloned in pBR322. M4 is >90% single-copy; however, it does contain a short (300 bp) sequence repeated ∼100 times in the Dictyostelium genome. The short repeat sequence is interspersed between single-copy regions. 1–1.5% of total vegetative poly(A)+ mRNA hybridizes to the repeat, but only 10 % of the hybridization is resistant to low levels of RNAase. The mRNA is heterogeneous in size and 90 % of the mass is complementary to Dictyostelium single-copy DNA. We have also shown that one of the single-copy regions adjacent to the repeat is complementary to a low abundance class mRNA (0.01% of total mRNA). Sandwich hybridization experiments show that unlabeled RNA that hybridizes to this single-copy region will also hybridize 32p repeat. Exonuclease studies indicate that the repeat and single-copy regions are part of a single transcription unit which encodes a 1.2 kb mRNA. The 5′ end of this mRNA is complementary to the short repeat sequence and the remainder of the mRNA is transcribed from single-copy DNA. Furthermore, RNA excess hybridization to 32P-labeled separated strands of the repeat suggests that the repeat sequence is transcribed asymmetrically into poly(A)+ RNA. We have proposed a model in which this repeat sequence is adjacent to ∼100 different single-copy genes and is transcribed to produce different mRNA molecules carrying the common repeat sequence at the 5′ end."
https://openalex.org/W2038662837,"We describe an unusual DNA alteration, “nearly precise excision,” which has been identified among tetracycline-sensitive deletion derivatives of lambda phages carrying the translocatable tetracycline-resistance element Tn10. DNA sequence analysis of two such derivatives demonstrates that each retains exactly 50 bp of Tn10 material. The original junctions between lambda and Tn10 sequences remain intact; however, an internal deletion has occurred within Tn10 which eliminates all but the last few base pairs at each end of the element. This deletion occurs within a short A + Trich inverted repeat which is present near each end of Tn10. Nearly precise excisions occur at frequencies comparable to Tn10-promoted deletions, inversions and translocations, and, like these other events, are independent of phage and bacterial functions for homologous recombination (recA, recB, red). It is not yet clear, however, whether nearly precise excisions are specifically promoted by Tn10 or whether they arise during the course of normal DNA replication processes as a consequence of unusual symmetries present in the DNA sequence at the ends of Tn10."
https://openalex.org/W2002315870,"A competitive inhibitor of colchicine binding to tubulin has been found in rat brain. Most of the inhibitor is associated with microsomes but some inhibitor, with an apparent molecular weight of approximately 250,000, is found in the cytosol. Both the microsomal and cytosol inhibitors are heat- and trypsin-sensitive, indicating that a protein moiety is required for activity. The microsomes bind tubulin directly; the microsomal and cytosol fractions both inhibit microtubule assembly in vitro. The inhibitor may function in the living cell to bind and sequester non-polymerized tubulin. Regulation of tubulin attachment to microsomes could then control the concentration of cytosolic tubulin available for microtubule assembly."

https://openalex.org/W2034427281,"Abstract Anchorage dependence can be defined as an increase in proliferation which is seen when cells are allowed to attach to a solid surface. We have measured this increase by time-lapse cinematography and other methods, and have compared it with measurements of the change in surface area which also occurs. Anchorage dependence can be varied over very wide limits in cells of the NIL-8 hamster fibroblast line by varying the concentration of serum in the medium. Thus in a concentration of 5% serum, the transition probability (a measure of growth rate) of attached cells is 8 times greater than in suspension. When the serum concentration is raised to 66%, attached and suspended cells grow at the same rate. We have found that this change in growth is accompanied by a corresponding change in the exposed surface area of the cells. Thus in 5% serum, the area of attached is 3 times greater than suspended cells, while in 66% serum, the areas of attached and suspended cells are equal. There is also a significant relationship between the area and the total amount of growth achieved, since both suspended colonies and attached confluent monolayers appear to stop growing at the same surface: volume ratio. Several aspects of this relationship between anchorage dependence and area are also seen when other different types of cell are cultured in the suspended and attached state, all at the same serum concentration. These experiments show that change in exposed surface area can provide a complete explanation for the anchorage dependence of NIL-8 cells and suggest the possibility that this might also be true of animal cells in general."
https://openalex.org/W2087633012,"By using two separate electrodes with tips inside a single feline motoneuron, current-voltage characteristics were studied during extracellular iontophoresis of noradrenaline. The usually observed hyperpolarization was accompanied by an increase in membrane resistance and became larger with polarizing and smaller with depolarizing currents. During large depolarizing current injections, the noradrenaline-induced potential reversed its direction, usually at a membrane potential of about -20 millivolts. These data are compatible with the concept that noradrenaline hyperpolarizes nerve cells by decreasing resting membrane conductances to sodium and potassium ions. The observation could also be explained by a nonspecific decrease in ion permeability that is associated with a hyperpolarization due to sodium pump activation."

Although the results provide general support for the hypothesis, there were several important dissociations. (i) Low doses of LSD produced only small decreases in raphe unit activity but significant behavoiral changes; (ii) LSD-induced behavioral changes outlasted the depression of raphe unit activity; and (iii) raphe neurons were at least as responsive to LSD during tolerance as they were in the nontolerant condition."
https://openalex.org/W2032648102,"Pluripotent embryonal carcinoma cells can be triggered to differentiate in vitro by allowing them to form multicellular aggregates. Nullipotent embryonal carcinoma cells form aggregates, but further development is blocked. Pluripotent and nullipotent embryonal carcinoma cell lines were co-cultured to form mixed aggregates in order to determine whether a developmental signal produced by the pluripotent cell could induce the nullipotent cells to differentiate. Unlike pure pluripotent cell aggregates, aggregates from cultures initiated with a 1:1 mixture of pluripotent (PSA-1) and nullipotent (F9) cells formed endoderm but failed to differentiate further. The nullipotent cells did not produce a detectable soluble inhibitor of differentiation. A hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase-deficient subclone of the nullipotent cell line was used so that the fate of both nullipotent and pluripotent cells could be followed in autoradiographs of histological sections of aggregates labeled with 3H-hypoxanthine. Seven day old aggregates of pure pluripotent cell cultures contained endoderm, ectoderm and embryonal carcinoma cells. On the other hand, in 7 day old mixed cell aggregates, almost all the pluripotent cells became endoderm located on the outer surface of the aggregate. The nullipotent cells in the mixed aggregates assumed an internal position and remained embryonal carcinoma cells. Following the efficiency of plating of pluripotential cells in pure and mixed aggregates as a function of time showed that viable pluripotent embryonal carcinoma cells were lost at a 10 fold greater rate in mixed cell aggregates than in pure pluripotent cell aggregates. We conclude that nullipotent embryonal carcinoma cells in mixed aggregates with pluripotent cells exert a limitation on the ability of these pluripotent cells to differentiate."
https://openalex.org/W2035886871,"The nature of genetic control of cellular malignancy was investigated by examining the tumorigenicity of a series of interspecific mouse-human cell hybrids in the athymic nude mouse. Two highly malignant but genetically distinct mouse cell lines, A9 and PG19, were hybridized with three normal human diploid fibroblast strains, and 19 independently arising hybrid clones were isolated. Each of these clones was capable of forming progressive lethal tumors in the nude mouse, and thus resembled the malignant parental mouse cells rather than the nonmalignant parental human cells. We failed to obtain any evidence for complete suppression of tumorigenicity in these cell hybrids. The absence of suppression was observed regardless of the extent and composition of the human chromosome complements retained in the hybrid clones; the results of detailed cytological and isoenzyme analyses would make it highly improbable that the observed lack of suppression was due to cellular selection in vivo for a more tumorigenic subpopulation in the injected hybrid cells. These data demonstrate that at least for the parental cell combinations used in this study, no human chromosome, when present singly in the mouse-human cell hybrids, can suppress the tumorigenic phenotype of the mouse cells. Our results are consistent with the view that the suppression of cellular malignancy previously demonstrated in intraspecific (mouse × mouse) somatic cell hybrids does not occur in interspecific (mouse-human) cell hybrids, or alternatively, genetic determinants located on two or more human chromosomes are required simultaneously to suppress the malignancy of the mouse cells in cell hybrids derived from malignant mouse cell and nonmalignant human cells."

https://openalex.org/W2019408640,"This paper describes a model for the structure of DNA contained in three morphologically similar bacteriophages — T7, P22 and φCd-1 — based on the transient electric dichroism of intact phage. The reduced dichroism of each of the phages at perfect orientation is within the range +0.12 to +0.19. Assuming that the phage orientation axis is that which passes from the apex through the tail, the measured dichroism suggests that DNA is wrapped in closely packed, co-axial solenoids with the axis of the solenoids tipped 43.5° ± 2.5° from the orientation axis of the phage. All three phages show a large permanent dipole moment, with respective values of 5600, 200,000 and 500,000 Debye for T7, φCd-1 and P22. The radius of the equivalent sphere for the three phages calculated from the rotational relaxation time for the rise of dichroism is in agreement with birefringence and electron microscope observations. The circular dichroism spectra of all three bacteriophages indicate that the local DNA helicity is similar in each case."
https://openalex.org/W2029403346,"Deletion mutants have been derived from a plasmid-cloned repeating unit of Xenopus laevis oocyte 5S DNA by introducing the transposable chloramphenicol-resistance element Tn9 into the AT-rich spacer sequence near the 5' terminus of the X. laevis 5S rRNA gene in a recombinant plasmid and then selecting plasmids which had lost the transposable element. Plasmids lacking the entire transposable element and various portions of the AT-rich spacer sequence flanking the original site of Tn9 integration have been obtained, and their ability to support transcription of the remaining X. laevis 5S rRNA gene has been tested in X. laevis oocyte nuclei. The deletion mutants analyzed in the present study retain the 49 nucleotide nonrepetitive sequence immediately adjacent to the 5' terminus of the gene, but lack as much as 80% of the repetitive AT-rich spacer sequence (Fedoroff and Brown, 1978). Such deletion mutants are fully active templates for 5S rRNA synthesis. This implies that the AT-rich spacer, which comprises half or more of each repeating unit in X. laevis oocyte 5S DNA, is relatively unimportant for correct initiation of transcription, and that if there are extragenic sequences with promoter function, they are likely to reside in the short nonrepetitive region immediately adjacent to the gene."
