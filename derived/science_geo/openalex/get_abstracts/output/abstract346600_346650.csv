https://openalex.org/W2021795499,"Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a unicellular green alga whose lineage diverged from land plants over 1 billion years ago. It is a model system for studying chloroplast-based photosynthesis, as well as the structure, assembly, and function of eukaryotic flagella (cilia), which were inherited from the common ancestor of plants and animals, but lost in land plants. We sequenced the ∼120-megabase nuclear genome of Chlamydomonas and performed comparative phylogenomic analyses, identifying genes encoding uncharacterized proteins that are likely associated with the function and biogenesis of chloroplasts or eukaryotic flagella. Analyses of the Chlamydomonas genome advance our understanding of the ancestral eukaryotic cell, reveal previously unknown genes associated with photosynthetic and flagellar functions, and establish links between ciliopathy and the composition and function of flagella."
https://openalex.org/W4238448376,"Human cancer is caused by the accumulation of mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. To catalog the genetic changes that occur during tumorigenesis, we isolated DNA from 11 breast and 11 colorectal tumors and determined the sequences of the genes in the Reference Sequence database in these samples. Based on analysis of exons representing 20,857 transcripts from 18,191 genes, we conclude that the genomic landscapes of breast and colorectal cancers are composed of a handful of commonly mutated gene ""mountains"" and a much larger number of gene ""hills"" that are mutated at low frequency. We describe statistical and bioinformatic tools that may help identify mutations with a role in tumorigenesis. These results have implications for understanding the nature and heterogeneity of human cancers and for using personal genomics for tumor diagnosis and therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1985934170,"Within a polymer film, free-volume elements such as pores and channels typically have a wide range of sizes and topologies. This broad range of free-volume element sizes compromises a polymer's ability to perform molecular separations. We demonstrated free-volume structures in dense vitreous polymers that enable outstanding molecular and ionic transport and separation performance that surpasses the limits of conventional polymers. The unusual microstructure in these materials can be systematically tailored by thermally driven segment rearrangement. Free-volume topologies can be tailored by controlling the degree of rearrangement, flexibility of the original chain, and judicious inclusion of small templating molecules. This rational tailoring of free-volume element architecture provides a route for preparing high-performance polymers for molecular-scale separations."
https://openalex.org/W1997276296,"Under stress, many crystalline materials exhibit irreversible plastic deformation caused by the motion of lattice dislocations. In plastically deformed microcrystals, internal dislocation avalanches lead to jumps in the stress-strain curves (strain bursts), whereas in macroscopic samples plasticity appears as a smooth process. By combining three-dimensional simulations of the dynamics of interacting dislocations with statistical analysis of the corresponding deformation behavior, we determined the distribution of strain changes during dislocation avalanches and established its dependence on microcrystal size. Our results suggest that for sample dimensions on the micrometer and submicrometer scale, large strain fluctuations may make it difficult to control the resulting shape in a plastic-forming process."
https://openalex.org/W1976742787,"Orbital reconstructions and covalent bonding must be considered as important factors in the rational design of oxide heterostructures with engineered physical properties. We have investigated the interface between high-temperature superconducting (Y,Ca)Ba 2 Cu 3 O 7 and metallic La 0.67 Ca 0.33 MnO 3 by resonant x-ray spectroscopy. A charge of about –0.2 electron is transferred from Mn to Cu ions across the interface and induces a major reconstruction of the orbital occupation and orbital symmetry in the interfacial CuO 2 layers. In particular, the Cu d 3 z 2 – r 2 orbital, which is fully occupied and electronically inactive in the bulk, is partially occupied at the interface. Supported by exact-diagonalization calculations, these data indicate the formation of a strong chemical bond between Cu and Mn atoms across the interface. Orbital reconstructions and associated covalent bonding are thus important factors in determining the physical properties of oxide heterostructures."
https://openalex.org/W2124054733,"There is now considerable experimental evidence that aberrant activation of Rho family small GTPases promotes the uncontrolled proliferation, invasion, and metastatic properties of human cancer cells. Therefore, there is considerable interest in the development of small molecule inhibitors of Rho GTPase function. However, to date, most efforts have focused on inhibitors that indirectly block Rho GTPase function, by targeting either enzymes involved in post-translational processing or downstream protein kinase effectors. We recently determined that the EHT 1864 small molecule can inhibit Rac function in vivo. In this study, we evaluated the biological and biochemical specificities and biochemical mechanism of action of EHT 1864. We determined that EHT 1864 specifically inhibited Rac1-dependent platelet-derived growth factor-induced lamellipodia formation. Furthermore, our biochemical analyses with recombinant Rac proteins found that EHT 1864 possesses high affinity binding to Rac1, as well as the related Rac1b, Rac2, and Rac3 isoforms, and this association promoted the loss of bound nucleotide, inhibiting both guanine nucleotide association and Tiam1 Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor-stimulated exchange factor activity in vitro. EHT 1864 therefore places Rac in an inert and inactive state, preventing its engagement with downstream effectors. Finally, we evaluated the ability of EHT 1864 to block Rac-dependent growth transformation, and we determined that EHT 1864 potently blocked transformation caused by constitutively activated Rac1, as well as Rac-dependent transformation caused by Tiam1 or Ras. Taken together, our results suggest that EHT 1864 selectively inhibits Rac downstream signaling and transformation by a novel mechanism involving guanine nucleotide displacement.

Rho family proteins (20 human members) comprise a major branch of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases (1Wennerberg K. Der C.J. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1301-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 2Ridley A.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 522-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). Like Ras, Rho GTPases function as GDP/GTP-regulated binary on-off switches. In resting, quiescent cells, Rho GTPases exist predominately in their inactive, GDP-bound state. Upon growth factor stimulation, Rho-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RhoGEFs) 4The abbreviations used are: RhoGEF, Rho-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor; RBD, Rho GTPase binding domain; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; siRNA, small interference RNA; mant, N-methylanthraniloyl; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; HA, hemagglutinin; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; DH/PH, tandem Dbl and pleckstrin homology; GDI, guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor; WT, wild type; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; PAK, p21-activated serine/threonine kinase; GMPPNP, 5′-guanylyl imidodiphosphate. are activated, and they stimulate the intrinsic guanine nucleotide exchange activity to promote formation of the active GTP-bound protein. Rho-GTP binds preferentially to downstream effector proteins. Rho-specific GTPase-activating proteins then stimulate the intrinsic GTP hydrolysis activity of Rho GTPases, returning the protein to its inactive state and terminating effector interaction. RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 are the best studied and understood members of the Rho GTPase family (1Wennerberg K. Der C.J. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1301-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 2Ridley A.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 522-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). Rho GTPases are regulators of a diverse variety of cellular processes that include regulation of cell proliferation, actin cytoskeleton reorganization, and gene expression (3Jaffe A.B. Hall A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 247-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (2377) Google Scholar). Like Ras and other members of the Ras superfamily (4Malumbres M. Barbacid M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 459-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar, 5Bar-Sagi D. Hall A. Cell. 2000; 103: 227-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar), the aberrant activity of Rho GTPases has been implicated in cancer and other human diseases (6Boettner B.

Rac is essential for transformation caused by Ras and other oncogenes (11Qiu R.G. Chen J. Kirn D. McCormick F. Symons M.

Nature. 1995; 375: 338-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). The Rac1b splice variant of Rac1 is constitutively active and transforming and found overexpressed in breast and colon cancers (17Schnelzer A. Prechtel D. Knaus U. Dehne K. Gerhard M. Graeff H.

Mutation and overexpression of Rac3 was seen in human brain tumors, and RNA interference demonstrated a role for Rac1 and Rac3 in human glioblastoma invasion (20Hwang S.L. Chang J.H. Cheng T.S.

Finally, the Vav RacGEF is found hyperactivated in pancreatic cancers, and suppression of Vav1 expression impairs pancreatic tumor cell growth (22Denicola G. Tuveson D.A. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2005; 4: 509-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Due to their central nature in many transforming events, Rho GTPases are therefore attractive and validated targets for anticancer therapies. One approach has involved small molecule inhibitors of the prenyltransferases (23Sebti S.M. Hamilton A.D. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6584-6593Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 24Basso A.D. Kirschmeier P. Bishop W.R. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 15-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Farnesyltransferase and geranylgeranyltransferase I catalyze the covalent modification of Rho GTPases by isoprenoid lipids, which then promote the membrane association required for Rho GTPase interaction with effectors and biological activity. However, because these prenyltransferases are involved in the modification of a multitude of other proteins important in cell proliferation and survival (25Reid T.S. Terry K.L. Casey P.J. Beese L.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 343: 417-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), inhibitors of prenyltransferases are likely to possess significant off-target activities and may lack sufficient specificity to selectively block Rho GTPase function. Another approach has involved inhibitors of the protein kinase effectors of Rho GTPases, for example, the Y-27632 small molecule inhibitor of the Rho-associated serine/threonine protein kinase (ROCK), a key effector of RhoA. However, because Rho GTPases utilize a multitude of other downstream effectors, ROCK inhibitors will impair only a subset of RhoA functions (26Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1682) Google Scholar). Inhibitors that directly interact with Rho GTPases would be preferable and exhibit greater specificity. However, to date, there has been limited success in the identification of inhibitors that specifically interact with small GTPases. One example is the NSC23766 small molecule, which was identified as a cell-permeable compound that can bind directly to Rac1 and prevent its activation by Rac-specific RhoGEFs (27Gao Y. Dickerson J.B. Guo F. Zheng J. Zheng Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7618-7623Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). However, this inhibitor did not block Rac activation by some GEFs (Vav1), and Rac activation by other mechanisms will also be insensitive to NSC23766. Recently, we identified EHT 1864 as a small molecule that inhibited Rac-dependent amyloid precursor protein processing by γ-secretase and decreased Aβ production in vitro and in vivo (28Desire L. Bourdin J. Loiseau N. Peillon H. Picard V. De Oliveira C. Bachelot F. Leblond B. Taverne T. Beausoleil E. Lacombe S. Drouin D. Schweighoffer F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37516-37525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Our preliminary characterization found that EHT 1864 inhibited a variety of downstream signaling activities activated by ectopic expression of constitutively-activated Rac1(G12V) and decreased Rac1 association with the isolated Rho GTPase binding domain (RBD) of the p21-activated serine/threonine kinase effector PAK1 in vivo. However, the Rho GTPase specificity and mechanism of action of EHT 1864 was not determined. We report here on the further investigation of EHT 1864. We show that EHT 1864 selectively blocks platelet growth factor-stimulated activation of Rac1-dependent lamellipodia formation and not ligand activation of RhoA- or Cdc42-mediated actin reorganization. Our biochemical analyses determined that EHT 1864 also interacts with other Rac isoforms, associates with Rac1 tightly, and causes the release of bound nucleotide, thus preventing effector interaction, both in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we determined that EHT 1864 potently inhibited other Rac-dependent transformation processes, Tiam1- and Ras-mediated growth transformation. Our work suggests that EHT 1864 may form the basis for a novel class of specific GTPase inhibitors that function by impairing downstream effector engagement and activation. Rho-GTP Formation Pulldown Analyses—For analysis of the effect of EHT 1864 on the formation of the GTP-bound form of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 in vivo, pulldown analyses were done as we have described previously (28Desire L. Bourdin J. Loiseau N. Peillon H. Picard V. De Oliveira C. Bachelot F. Leblond B. Taverne T. Beausoleil E. Lacombe S. Drouin D. Schweighoffer F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37516-37525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Briefly, U87-MG cells were grown to 80% confluence. The cells were then treated with EHT 1864 or with vehicle, lysed in a buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100, and clarified, and the protein concentrations were normalized. The GTP-bound Rho GTPase levels in the lysates were measured using a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein containing the isolated RBD derived from the Rac and Cdc42 effector, the PAK1 serine/threonine kinase (GST-PAK-RBD, Cytoskeleton Inc., Denver, CO) for Rac1-GTP or Cdc42-GTP detection, or the RhoA effector, Rhotekin (GST-Rhotekin-RBD, provided by A. Hall, University College, London, UK). Antibodies specific for Rac1, Cdc42, and RhoA (Tebu, Le Perray en Yvelines, France) were then used for immunoblot analyses for GTP-bound Rho GTPase and for total cell lysate protein levels. Actin Reorganization Analyses—NIH 3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum (designated complete growth medium). For analysis of the effect of EHT 1864 treatment on extracellular signal-induced changes in actin organization, we treated NIH 3T3 cells with platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), or bradykinin (Sigma-Aldrich), to activate endogenous Rac1, RhoA, or Cdc42, respectively. NIH 3T3 cells were plated on glass coverslips at a density of 2 × 104 cells per well in 12-well plates. 24 h after cell seeding, cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.5% calf serum for 16 h in the presence or absence of 5 μm EHT 1864 or EHT 8560 for the last 4 h. Cells were stimulated for 15 min with 5 ng/ml PDGF, 40 ng/ml LPA, or 100 ng/ml bradykinin, then fixed for confocal immunofluorescence analysis. Cells on coverslips treated as described above were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) before being fixed for 15 min at room temperature with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. Glass coverslips were rinsed three times in PBS and incubated with Alexa Fluor 568 conjugated-phalloidin (Invitrogen) for 30 min. After two final washes in PBS and one in water, coverslips were mounted on slides using Fluor-Save Reagent (Calbiochem). The mounting medium was allowed to dry overnight away from light, before analysis. To verify that PDGF-induced lamellipodia formation was dependent on Rac1 function, we transiently transfected the cultures twice at a 24-h interval, with a final concentration of 50 nm short interfering RNA (siRNA) against Rac1 or with an irrelevant siRNA (siCONTROL Non-Targeting siRNA from Dharmacon), using the calcium phosphate method. 12 h following the second transfection, cells were serum-starved and then PDGF-stimulated as described above. The Rac1 siRNA sequence has been previously described (29Deroanne C. Vouret-Craviari V. Wang B. Pouyssegur J. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1367-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Western blot analyses with mouse anti-Rac1 monoclonal antibody (clone 23A8, Upstate) were done to determine the degree of Rac1 silencing and with mouse anti-β-actin monoclonal antibody (clone AC-15, Sigma-Aldrich) to verify equivalent loading of total protein. Recombinant Protein Expression and Purification—The pGEX-Rac1, pGEX-Rac1(15A), pGEX-Rac1b, pPRO-EXHTb-Rac2, pGEX-Rac3, pGEX-Cdc42, pGEX-Cdc42(15A), and pPRO-EXHTb-Tiam1 DH/PH bacterial expression plasmids have all been described previously (19Singh A.

Briefly, BL21(DE3) cells expressing Rac1, Rac1b, Rac2, and Cdc42, respectively, were incubated at 37 °C, before induction with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h at 37 °C (Rac3 required overnight induction at room temperature). GST proteins were either purified using a batch method (30-min incubation of bacterial cell lysate with 150 μl of glutathione-Sepharose, followed by three washes in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, supplemented with 10 μm GDP only for GST-Rac1(15A) and GST-Cdc42(15A) purification), or by fast-protein liquid chromatography using a 1-ml GSTrap FF column (Amersham Biosciences), and subsequent concentration using centrifugal concentrators (Vivascience). His6-Rac2, Rac1-Δinsert-His6 (37Thapar R. Karnoub A.E. Campbell S.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3875-3883Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and His6-Tiam1 DH/PH were purified by fast-protein liquid chromatography using a 5-ml HiTrap Ni column (Amersham Biosciences), before dialysis into 20 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and subsequent concentration of protein. Recombinant Protein Nucleotide Loading—To load GST-Sepharose-bound small GTPases, the bead-bound GTPases were incubated in exchange buffer (20 mm Tris·HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 500 μm fluorescent N-methylanthraniloyl (mant) derivatives of guanine nucleotides (mant-GDP and mant-GMPPNP, Roche Applied Science), 20 mm (NH4)2SO4), for 1 min at 37 °C, before three washes in cold equilibration buffer (20 mm Tris·HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2). Nucleotide-loaded protein was then eluted from the beads using elution buffer (20 mm Tris·HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm glutathione) for 10 min on ice. To load His6-tagged proteins, the relevant protein was incubated in exchange buffer for 1 min at 37 °C, before being separated from excess nucleotide in a Zeba Desalting Spin Column (Pierce Biotechnology), prepared as per manufacturer's protocol. Fluorescent Intensity Measurements—Off-rate measurements were performed in a SPEX Fluorolog-3 Research fluorometer, in a 1-ml quartz cuvette (with constant stirring), with a total of 300 μl of 20 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 2 μm small GTPase·mant-GDP at 25 °C. Exchange was initiated by addition of inhibitor to a final concentration of 50 μm or EDTA to a final concentration of 10 mm. Changes in fluorescence was monitored at λex = 290 nm and λem = 440 nm, and data were recorded by the supplied software. On-rate measurements were performed in a Gemini Spectromax 96-well plate reader, in a 96-well plate (BD Falcon microtest plate) with a total of 100 μl of 20 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 μm mant-GDP, 2 μm small GTPase at 25 °C, and 50 μm of inhibitor. Exchange was initiated by addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 8 mm. Changes in fluorescence were monitored 4 min after inhibitor addition, at λex = 290 nm and λem = 440 nm. Data were recorded by the supplied SOFTMax Pro software. Measurements of excitation and emission spectra were performed in the SPEX Fluorolog-3 Research fluorometer, in 300 μl of 20 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 μm inhibitor at 25 °C, in the presence or absence of 10 μm Rac. Fluorescent Anisotropy Measurements—Fluorescent anisotropy measurements were performed in the SPEX Fluorolog-3 Research fluorometer, set up in the polarized T format, in a 1-ml quartz cuvette (with constant stirring), with a total of 300 μl of 20 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2 or PAK-RBD:GTPase association analyses, GST-PAK-RBD was titrated into 2 μm small GTPase·mant-GMPPNP in the presence or absence of 50 μm inhibitor (λex = 360 nm, λem = 440 nm). For inhibitor:GTPase binding analyses, aliquots of small GTPase solution (containing 1 μm inhibitor) were titrated into a solution of 1 μm inhibitor in the cuvette. Changes in fluorescence anisotropy were monitored at λex = 360 nm, λem = 440 nm, 30 s after each addition. All data analysis and curve fitting were performed using Microsoft Excel and QuantumSoft's ProFit for Mac OS X. Affinity Precipitation of the RacGEF Tiam1—50% confluent 10-cm dish of 293T cells were transfected by using Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen) with 10 μg of pcDNA 3.1 expression plasmid alone (vector) or encoding Myc epitope-tagged Tiam1(C1199), an N-terminal truncated and constitutively activated mutant of human Tiam1 (a gift from G.

The lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and 400 μg of total protein extracts was used per condition. Five micrograms of either bacterially expressed GST, GST-Rac1(15A), or GST-Cdc42(15A), immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose™ 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) and pre-treated with different doses of EHT 1864 for 30 min at 4 °C, was added to each condition. EHT 1864 was still present during the incubation with the lysates. The samples were rotated at 4 °C for 1 h, and then the beads were washed once with lysis buffer and twice with cold wash buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl). Affinity-precipitated proteins were eluted in protein sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with a monoclonal anti-Myc antibody 1/1000 (clone 9E10, Sigma-Aldrich). In Vitro Binding of RhoGDIs to Rac1—A 50% confluent 10-cm dish of 293T cells was transfected by using Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen) with 5 μg of pcDNA 3.1 expression plasmid alone (vector) or encoding RhoGDI1 (GDIα/RhoGDI) or RhoGDI2 (GDIβ/Ly/D4GDI) proteins (Guthrie cDNA Resource Center). 48 h after transfection, the cells were lysed with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100, and a protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Invitrogen). The lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and 350 μg of total protein extracts was used per condition. 10 μg of either bacterially expressed GST or GST-Rac1(WT), immobilized on glutathi-one-Sepharose™ 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences), was then used per condition. GST-Rac1 was first loaded with nucleotide for 10 min at 37 °C in a loading buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 2 mm GTPγS or GDP (150 μl of loading buffer per 10 μg of recombinant protein). The loading reaction was stopped by addition of MgCl2 to 15 mm on ice. GDP- or GTPγS-loaded GST-Rac1 was treated first with different doses of EHT 1864 for 30 min at 4 °C and then added to the lysates, and the samples were rotated at 4 °C for 1 h in the presence or absence of EHT 1864. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer, and the affinity-precipitated proteins were eluted in protein sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with a rabbit polyclonal anti-RhoGDI1 antibody 1/5000 (A-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or a goat polyclonal anti-RhoGDI2 antibody 1/5000 (C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), respectively. Transformation Analyses—For primary focus formation assays, NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were plated at a density of 105 cells/well of a 6-well plate. One day after seeding, cells were transiently transfected with 50 ng of the pCGN-hygro expression plasmid alone (vector) or encoding H-Ras(61L). Cells were allowed to reach confluency and were maintained on complete growth medium supplemented with 5 μm EHT 1864 or vehicle until focus formation occurred. The appearance of H-Ras(61L)-induced foci of transformed cells was quantitated after 14 days. For establishment of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts stably transfected and expressing H-Ras(61L), Rac1 WT, Rac1(61L), or Tiam1(C1199), cells were plated at a density of 6 × 105 cells per 10-cm dish 1 day before transfection. 4 μg of the pCGN-hygro empty vector (used as a control) or encoding HA-tagged H-Ras(61L), Rac1 WT or Rac1(61L) (39Westwick J.K.

The same procedure was used with the pcDNA3.1-neo empty vector (control) or encoding Myc-tagged constitutively activated Tiam1(C1199). Two days after transfection, the transfected cells were replated in growth medium supplemented with either 200 μg/ml hygromycin B (Roche Applied Science) or 400 μg/ml G418 (Amersham Biosciences), respectively. After 10 days of selection, several hundred drug resistance colonies were then pooled together to establish mass populations of stably transfected cells. NIH 3T3 cells stably expressing Rac1 WT, Rac1(61L), or Tiam1(C1199) proteins were used for secondary focus formation assays. Cells stably transfected with the empty pCGN-hygro or pcDNA3.1-neo plasmids were used as controls. For each stable cell line, 5 × 105 fibroblasts were plated into each well of 6-well plates. Each condition was performed in duplicate. The cultures were fed every other day with fresh complete growth medium alone or supplemented with 5 μm of the compound EHT 1864. Activated Rac1- or Tiam1-induced transformed foci were visible after 3–4 weeks and were subsequently quantified under an inverted phase-contrast microscope at 4× magnification. Cells were then fixed in 10% acetic acid, 10% methanol and stained with 0.4% crystal violet dye. To determine the effects of EHT 1864 treatment on the rate of cell proliferation, NIH 3T3 cells stably expressing oncogenic Ras were plated in 96-well plates at an initial density of 2 × 103 cells/well. The cells were cultured for up to 4 days in complete growth medium, either alone, or supplemented with 5 μm EHT 1864. Cell growth was then assessed using the conversion of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT, Sigma-Aldrich) to a formazan product (40Hansen M.B. Nielsen S.E. Berg K. J. Immunol. Methods. 1989; 119: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (3353) Google Scholar). Briefly, the MTT reagent (from a 5 mg/ml solution diluted in PBS) was added to the wells at a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml, and the cells were further incubated for 4 h at 37°C. The medium was then removed, and the reaction was terminated by adding 100 μl/well Me2SO. The absorbance was read at 570 nm using a microplate reader. EHT 1864 Specifically Inhibits PDGF-induced Lamellipodia Formation—Our previous pulldown analyses showed that EHT 1864 reduced the association of endogenous Rac1 but not RhoA with the isolated GTP-dependent RBDs of PAK1 or Rhotekin, respectively (28Desire L.

We developed a hybrid scheme combining force and fluorescence that allowed us to examine the effect of subpiconewton forces on the nanometer scale motion of the Holliday junction (HJ) at 100-hertz bandwidth. The HJ is an exquisitely sensitive force sensor whose force response is amplified with an increase in its arm lengths, demonstrating a lever-arm effect at the nanometer-length scale. Mechanical interrogation of the HJ in three different directions helped elucidate the structures of the transient species populated during its conformational changes. This method of mapping two-dimensional reaction landscapes at low forces is readily applicable to other nucleic acid systems and their interactions with proteins and enzymes."

These findings identify PGC-1α as a critical regulator of skeletal muscle fuel stores. Glucose and fatty acids are the chief fuel sources for skeletal muscle. During prolonged bouts of low intensity exercise, muscle energy needs are met through utilization of both substrates with mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation serving a “glucose sparing” function (1Hawley J.A.

Whereas the role of PGC-1α in the control of muscle fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial respiratory capacity is well established, its contribution to the regulation of skeletal muscle glucose metabolism has not been well defined. Several recent lines of evidence suggest that PGC-1α exerts control on muscle glucose metabolism. First, PGC-1α serves as a key regulator of hepatic gluconeogenesis, an important source of substrate for muscle (32Puigserver P. Rhee J. Donovan J. Walkey C.J. Yoon J.C. Oriente F. Kitamura Y.

Cheatham R.B. Puigserver P. Adelmant G. Lehman J.J. Kelly D.P. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3820-3825Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Third, PGC-1α activates expression of the gene encoding pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4), a negative regulator of glucose oxidation (22Wende A.R. Huss J.M. Schaeffer P.J. Giguère V. Kelly D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10684-10694Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). In the current study, we sought to clarify the role of PGC-1α in the regulation of muscle fuel metabolism in vivo. To this end, we developed an inducible, muscle-specific PGC-1α transgenic system to be used in comparison with normal and PGC-1α-deficient mice (31Leone T.C. Lehman J.J. Finck B.N. Schaeffer P.J. Wende A.R. Boudina S. Courtois M. Wozniak D.F. Sambandam N. Bernal-Mizrachi C. Chen Z. Holloszy J.O. Medeiros D.M. Schmidt R.E. Saffitz J.E. Abel E.D. Semenkovich C.F. Kelly D.P. PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: 672-687Crossref Scopus (772) Google Scholar). We found that muscle-specific activation of PGC-1α increases muscle glucose uptake and glycogen levels at baseline and prevented depletion of glycogen stores following exercise. This glycogen “sparing” effect involved several mechanisms including increased capacity for fatty acid oxidation, induction of glucose transporter (GLUT1 and GLUT4) expression leading to augmentation of muscle glucose import, inhibition of glycolysis, and suppression of pathways involved in glycogen degradation. Animal Studies—All animal experiments and euthanasia protocols were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines for humane treatment of animals and were reviewed and approved by the Animal Studies Committee of Washington University.

Breeding pairs and offspring were maintained on chow containing doxycycline (200 mg/kg; Research Diet Inc., Brunswick, NJ). To activate the TRE-PGC-1α transgene, doxy-chow was removed and replaced with standard chow (Lab Diet 5052; Purina Mills Inc., St. Louis, MO). Unless otherwise stated, transgene induction was initiated at ∼5-6 weeks of age and experiments were performed 3-4 weeks later. For all studies, age- and sex-matched littermates were used. The generation and initial characterization of PGC-1α-deficient (PGC-1α-/-) mice has been described (31Leone T.C. Lehman J.J. Finck B.N. Schaeffer P.J. Wende A.R. Boudina S. Courtois M. Wozniak D.F.

Approximately 2-3-month-old PGC-1α-/- mice were used for all studies with age- and sex-matched wild-type controls unless specified otherwise. Low Intensity Exercise—To assess endurance exercise capacity and glycogen depletion, male and female mice were run to exhaustion on an Exer4-OxyMax motorized treadmill (Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH). Briefly, mice were acclimated to the treadmill for 2 days prior to the experimental protocol by running for 9 min at 10 m/min followed by 1 min at 20 m/min. On the day of the experiment, mice were run for 1 h at 10 m/min followed by an increase in speed of 2 m/min each additional 15 min until failure. Mice were defined as exhausted if they remained on the shock grid for five continuous seconds. High Intensity Exercise—Mice were acclimated to the treadmill as above. On the day of the experiment, mice were run alternating 1 min of running with 2 min of rest. The running intervals started at 10 m/min and increased 5 m/min each interval until a speed of 50 m/min was reached. Thereafter, speed was further increased 5 m/min every 6th interval until failure. Exhaustion was defined as above. For either exercise protocol, tail blood was taken prior to exercise and immediately following failure for glucose (HemoCue AB,Ángelholm, Sweden) and lactate (Lactate Pro Arkray, Kyoto, Japan) measurements, as per the manufacturers' instructions. To prevent blood loss, wounds were cauterized following sample collection. For glycogen replenishment studies, mice were gavaged with a glucose solution (0.56 m, 1 mg of glucose/g of mouse) immediately following completion of the exercise protocol and euthanized by CO2 inhalation at varying time points after cessation of exercise. The vastus muscles were harvested and immediately clamp-frozen in liquid nitrogen for later glycogen content, RNA, and protein analyses. Histology and Microscopy—Gastrocnemius was analyzed histologically. For light microscopy, frozen tissue was used for succinate dehydrogenase staining. Formalin-fixed samples were embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin/eosin (H & E) or periodic acid Schiff. For electron microscopy, tissue was fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde and 1% paraformaldehyde, post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide, embedded in plastic epoxy resin (poly bed 812). Sections on copper grids were then stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate for visualization. RNA and Protein Expression Analyses—Total cellular RNA was isolated from gastrocnemius using the RNAzol method (Tel-Test, Friendswood, TX). Northern blot hybridizations with random-primed 32P-labeled cDNA probes were performed using QuikHyb (Stratagene). Real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was performed as previously described (37Huss J.M. Pinéda Torra I. Staels B. Giguère V. Kelly D.P. Mol. Cell.

Mouse-specific primers used for RNA analysis may be found in supplemental materials Table S1. Protein extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE (Criterion, Bio-Rad) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Whatman). Western blotting was performed using antibodies against GLUT4 (Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA, and a gift from Michael Mueckler) (38Ren J.M. Marshall B.A. Gulve E.A. Gao J. Johnson D.W. Holloszy J.O.

Detection was performed by measuring horseradish peroxidase activity by chemiluminescent signal using ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Protein bands were analyzed by densitometry using ImageJ software (rsb.info.nih.gov/ij). Isolated Mitochondrial Respiration—Mitochondria were isolated from whole hindlimb using a trypsin digestion procedure as previously described (44Saks V.A. Kuznetsov A.V. Kupriyanov V.V. Miceli M.V. Jacobus W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7757-7764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, tissue was minced, washed, and suspended in isolation medium (300 mm sucrose, 10 mm NaHepes, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4). Following digestion, samples were gently homogenized with a glass Teflon homogenizer. Following centrifugation and two washes, isolated mitochondria were incubated with palmitate-containing media and respiration was determined as previously described (31Leone T.C. Lehman J.J. Finck B.N. Schaeffer P.J. Wende A.R. Boudina S. Courtois M. Wozniak D.F. Sambandam N. Bernal-Mizrachi C. Chen Z. Holloszy J.O. Medeiros D.M. Schmidt R.E. Saffitz J.E. Abel E.D. Semenkovich C.F. Kelly D.P. PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: 672-687Crossref Scopus (772) Google Scholar). Oxygen consumption was measured at 25 °C using an optical probe (Oxygen FOXY Probe; Ocean Optics, Dunedin, FL). Following basal state measurements, maximal (ADP-stimulated) state 3 respiration was determined by adding ADP to a 1 mm final concentration. Thereafter, rates of uncoupled respiration was determined indirectly following addition of oligomycin (1 μg/ml). The solubility of oxygen at 25 °C was taken as 246.87 mmol of O2 ml-1. Respiration rates are expressed as nanomole of O2 min-1 mg protein-1 as determined by the Pierce Micro BCA protein assay. Citrate Synthase Activity Assay—Citrate synthase activity was determined in tibialis anterior muscle as described (45Chi M.M. Hintz C.S. Coyle E.F. Martin W.H. II I Ivy J.L. Nemeth P.M. Holloszy J.O. Lowry O.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1983; 244: C276-C287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Measurement of Glucose Transport Activity—Animals were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of sodium phenobarbital (5 mg/100 g body weight). Epitrochlearis muscle (and EDL, data not shown) was isolated following an overnight fast. Muscles were immediately washed with Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate (KHB) and incubated for 20 min in 1.0 ml of KHB buffer containing 1 μm 2-deoxy-d-[1,2-3H]glucose and 0.1% bovine serum albumin and the rate of accumulation of 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) in intracellular water was determined as described (46Hansen P.A. Gulve E.A. Holloszy J.O. J. Appl. Physiol. 1994; 76: 979-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Values were corrected to tissue weight. Glucose 6-Phosphate Assay—The concentration of Glu-6-P was determined as described (47Lowry O.H. Passonneau J.V. A Flexible System of Enzymatic Analysis. Academic Press, New York1972Google Scholar) by assaying gastrocnemius tissue extract with Glu-6-P dehydrogenase (G8289, Sigma) and 0.2 mm NADP in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4) and 3 mm MgCl2. Resulting changes in absorption at 340 nm were compared with a standard of 0-33 nmol of Glu-6-P and corrected to protein concentration. Isolated Muscle Glycolysis Studies—Glycolysis was assayed in epitrochlearis muscle isolated from mice following an overnight fast using a modified protocol from isolated working hearts (48Sambandam N. Morabito D. Wagg C. Finck B.N. Kelly D.P. Lopaschuk G.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290: H87-H95Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Briefly, isolated muscle was immediately placed in KHB buffer with 8 mm glucose and 32 mm mannitol for 1 h at 37 °C for recovery. Muscle was then transferred to fresh KHB as above, supplemented with 125 μm oleate for substrate selection and preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Finally, muscle was transferred to fresh KHB as above, spiked with 1 μCi/ml [5-3H]glucose (15 Ci/mmol), and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The release of 3H2O from glucose into incubation buffer was measured by evaporative 3H2O transfer from the incubation buffer to water in a sealed scintillation vial. Tritium was measured by scintillation counting and disintegrations/min were normalized to control values corrected for tissue weight. Glycogen Measurements—Muscle extract from either vastus or gastrocnemius (data not shown) was analyzed as previously described (49Passonneau J.V. Lauderdale V.R. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 60: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Briefly, snap frozen tissue was powdered under liquid nitrogen and homogenized in a 0.3 m perchloric acid solution. This extract was assayed with and without amyloglucosidase digestion (A7420, Sigma) in 50 mm Na acetate (pH 5.5) and 0.02% bovine serum albumin. Resulting changes in absorption at 340 nm were compared with a standard of 0 to 80 μmol of glucose. Results are presented as glucose released from glycogen corrected to tissue weight. Statistical Analysis—Statistical comparisons were made using unpaired t test or analysis of variance coupled to Tukey's post hoc test when appropriate. All data are presented as mean ± S.E., with a statistically significant difference defined as a value of p < 0.05. Short-term, Muscle-specific Expression of PGC-1α Activates Mitochondrial Biogenesis and Oxidative Gene Regulatory Programs—Double transgenic mice (PGC-1α-TRE(+) mice) were generated by breeding MCK-tTA (“tet-off” transactivator) and TRE-PGC-1α (transresponder) lines so that the short-term effects of muscle-specific overexpression of PGC-1α could be investigated. Single transgenic transresponder (PGC-1α-TRE(-)) littermates receiving doxycycline were used as controls. PGC-1α-TRE(+) mice were maintained on doxycycline-containing chow until 5-6 weeks of age, after which doxycycline was removed. The transgene was not expressed in the presence of doxycycline (Fig. 1A). Transgene expression was detectable in muscle after a 2-week doxy “wash-out” period and continued to increase until 3-4 weeks after doxycycline removal (Fig. 1A). Examination of various tissues revealed that transgene expression was specific to skeletal muscle (Fig. 1B and data not shown). As described previously for constitutive skeletal muscle PGC-1α transgenic mice (28Lin J. Wu H. Tarr P.T. Zhang C.Y. Wu Z. Boss O. Michael L.F. Puigserver P. Isotanni E. Olson E.N. Lowell B.B. Bassel-Duby R. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2002; 418: 797-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2033) Google Scholar), forced expression of PGC-1α increased red coloration of the muscle within 3 weeks of the induction of transgene expression (Fig. 1C). Histological examination revealed enhanced succinate dehydrogenase staining in gastrocnemius, consistent with an increase in proportion of oxidative fibers in this muscle (Fig. 2A). To further examine the cellular and structural changes accompanying PGC-1α overexpression in skeletal muscle, electron microscopic analysis was performed. Forced expression of PGC-1α resulted in a dramatic increase in the cellular volume density of mitochondria (Fig. 2A). Importantly, muscle from PGC-1α-TRE(+) animals exhibited lipid droplets associated with mitochondria and granular staining resembling glycogen β-particles suggesting an increase in cellular fuel stores (Fig. 2A). Respiratory function studies were performed on mitochondria isolated from whole hindlimb of PGC-1α-TRE(+) and PGC-1α-TRE(-) mice. Using palmitoylcarnitine as substrate, state 3 (ADP-stimulated) respiration rates were significantly higher in mitochondria isolated from the PGC-1α-TRE(+) mice (Fig. 2B). In the presence of oligomycin, respiration was largely abolished in both PGC-1α-TRE(+) and PGC-1α-TRE(-) mitochondria, suggesting that the majority of the PGC-1α-stimulated respiration was coupled to ATP production. In contrast to the results obtained with palmitoylcarnitine, respiration rates with pyruvate were not different between the groups (data not shown). The activity of the citric acid cycle enzyme, citrate synthase (Fig. 2B), and the expression of nuclear and mitochondrial genes encoding enzymes involved in mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation, electron transport, and oxidative phosphorylation were coordinately increased in the muscle of the PGC-1α-TRE(+) mice (Fig. 2C). Expression of the cellular fatty acid transporter, CD36, was also induced in the muscle of PGC-1α-TRE(+) mice (Fig. 2C). Taken together, these results demonstrate that PGC-1α augments the capacity for muscle mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. PGC-1α Drives Increased Muscle Glucose Uptake and Storage—We next sought to evaluate the effects of PGC-1α overexpression on muscle glucose metabolism. Rates of 2-DG uptake were determined ex vivo in epitrochlearis muscles isolated from PGC-1α-TRE(+) and PGC-1α-TRE(-) mice. Mean 2-DG uptake rates in PGC-1α-TRE(+) muscle were significantly greater compared with control muscles (Fig. 3A). Consistent with the glucose uptake data, expression of GLUT4, GLUT1, and hexokinase was induced in muscle of the PGC-1α-TRE(+) mice (Fig. 3B). To determine the fate of the glucose transported into PGC-1α-TRE(+) muscle, glycolysis rates were measured in isolated skeletal muscle by following the release of 3H2O from [5-3H]glucose. Surprisingly, PGC-1α overexpression led to a marked reduction (over 50%) in glycolytic flux (Fig. 3A). The decreased glycolytic rate was associated with a modest but significant reduction in the expression of the gene encoding phosphofructokinase, which catalyzes a tightly regulated, rate-limiting step in the glycolytic pathway (Fig. 3B). Recently we demonstrated that PGC-1α exerts repression on glucose oxidation by increas"

https://openalex.org/W2036992089,"The arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis represents the most widely distributed mutualistic root symbiosis. We report that root extracts of mycorrhizal plants contain a lipophilic signal capable of inducing the phosphate transporter genes StPT3 and StPT4 of potato ( Solanum tuberosum L.), genes that are specifically induced in roots colonized by AM fungi. The same signal caused rapid extracellular alkalinization in suspension-cultured tomato ( Solanum lycopersicum L.) cells and induction of the mycorrhiza-specific phosphate transporter gene LePT4 in these cells. The active principle was characterized as the lysolipid lyso-phosphatidylcholine (LPC) via a combination of gene expression studies, alkalinization assays in cell cultures, and chromatographic and mass spectrometric analyses. Our results highlight the importance of lysophospholipids as signals in plants and in particular in the AM symbiosis."
https://openalex.org/W1984736575,"Theory suggests it should be difficult for asexual organisms to adapt to a changing environment because genetic diversity can only arise from mutations accumulating within direct antecedents and not through sexual exchange. In an asexual microinvertebrate, the bdelloid rotifer, we have observed a mechanism by which such organisms could acquire the diversity needed for adaptation. Gene copies most likely representing former alleles have diverged in function so that the proteins they encode play complementary roles in survival of dry conditions. One protein prevents desiccation-sensitive enzymes from aggregating during drying, whereas its counterpart does not have this activity, but is able to associate with phospholipid bilayers and is potentially involved in maintenance of membrane integrity. The functional divergence of former alleles observed here suggests that adoption of asexual reproduction could itself be an evolutionary mechanism for the generation of diversity."
https://openalex.org/W1976009930,"Natural adhesives in the feet of different arthropods and vertebrates show strong adhesion as well as excellent reusability. Whereas the hierarchical structures on the surface are known to have a substantial effect on adhesion, the role of subsurface structures such as the network of microchannels has not been studied. Inspired by these bioadhesives, we generated elastomeric layers with embedded air- or oil-filled microchannels. These adhesives showed remarkable enhancement of adhesion ( approximately 30 times), which results from the crack-arresting properties of the microchannels, together with the surface stresses caused by the capillary force. The importance of the thickness of the adhesive layer, channel diameter, interchannel spacing, and vertical position within the adhesive has been examined for developing an optimal design of this microfluidic adhesive."
https://openalex.org/W1984401268,"In recent years there has been growing interest in the post-translational regulation of P-type ATPases by protein kinase-mediated phosphorylation. Pma1 H+-ATPase, which is responsible for H+-dependent nutrient uptake in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), is one such example, displaying a rapid 5–10-fold increase in activity when carbon-starved cells are exposed to glucose. Activation has been linked to Ser/Thr phosphorylation in the C-terminal tail of the ATPase, but the specific phosphorylation sites have not previously been mapped. The present study has used nanoflow high pressure liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray electron transfer dissociation tandem mass spectrometry to identify Ser-911 and Thr-912 as two major phosphorylation sites that are clearly related to glucose activation. In carbon-starved cells with low Pma1 activity, peptide 896–918, which was derived from the C terminus upon Lys-C proteolysis, was found to be singly phosphorylated at Thr-912, whereas in glucose-metabolizing cells with high ATPase activity, the same peptide was doubly phosphorylated at Ser-911 and Thr-912. Reciprocal 14N/15N metabolic labeling of cells was used to measure the relative phosphorylation levels at the two sites. The addition of glucose to carbon-starved cells led to a 3-fold reduction in the singly phosphorylated form and an 11-fold increase in the doubly phosphorylated form. These results point to a mechanism in which the stepwise phosphorylation of two tandemly positioned residues near the C terminus mediates glucose-dependent activation of the H+-ATPase.

These results point to a mechanism in which the stepwise phosphorylation of two tandemly positioned residues near the C terminus mediates glucose-dependent activation of the H+-ATPase. Pma1 H+-ATPase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae belongs to the widely distributed family of P2-type cation pumps, which include the sarcoplasmic reticulum and plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPases and the Na+,K+-ATPase of animal cells and the plasma membrane H+-ATPase of higher plants (1Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15607-15613Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Like other members of the P2 family, the 100-kDa yeast ATPase is folded into 3 cytoplasmic domains (N, P, and A) that form the catalytic portion of the molecule, anchored in the lipid bilayer by 10 transmembrane helices that comprise the ion transport pathway (2Kuhlbrandt W. Zeelen J. Dietrich J. Science. 2002; 297: 1692-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Pma1 ATPase acts physiologically to pump protons out of the cell, creating the electrochemical gradient that drives solute uptake by an array of H+-coupled cotransporters. Its activity is strongly regulated, reflecting both its essential role in cell growth and the fact that, as the most abundant protein in the plasma membrane, it consumes at least 20% of cellular ATP (3Morsomme P. Slayman C.W. Goffeau A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1469: 133-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The first evidence for Pma1 regulation was reported in 1983 by Serrano (4Serrano R. FEBS Lett. 1983; 156: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), who found that the addition of glucose to carbon-starved yeast cells led within minutes to a 5–10-fold increase in ATPase activity accompanied by a severalfold lowering of the Km for MgATP and an alkaline shift in pH optimum. Given the rapidity of the activation, it seemed likely to occur at the post-translational level. Direct support for this idea came in 1991, when Chang and Slayman (5Chang A. Slayman C.W. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) immunoprecipitated Pma1 ATPase from 32P-labeled yeast cells and analyzed it by two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping. Against a background of “constitutive” phosphorylation, which occurred in a stepwise fashion as newly synthesized ATPase moved from the endoplasmic reticulum through the Golgi and secretory vesicles to the cell surface, additional phosphorylation took place when glucose was added to carbon-starved cells. Complete digestion of the 32P-labeled ATPase revealed both phosphoserine and phosphothreonine but no detectable phosphotyrosine (5Chang A. Slayman C.W. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). These results strongly supported the idea that glucose activation of the ATPase was related to kinase-mediated phosphorylation at one or more Ser/Thr residues, although the location of the phosphorylation sites had yet to be determined. In parallel, studies in several laboratories sought to identify the domain(s) of the 100-kDa Pma1 ATPase that participates in glucose-dependent regulation (for review, see Ref. 6Portillo F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1469: 31-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Attention soon focused on the 45-amino acid C-terminal tail, which is known to protrude from the plasma membrane into the cytoplasm (7Mandala S.M. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16276-16281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Removal of the last 18 amino acids by mutagenesis led to constitutive activation of the ATPase even in the absence of glucose (8Mason A.B. Kardos T.B. Monk B.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1372: 261-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 9Portillo F. de Larrinoa I.F. Serrano R. FEBS Lett. 1989; 247: 381-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, immunoblotting with anti-C-terminal antibody revealed that the C terminus was relatively inaccessible during carbon starvation but could be rapidly digested by trypsin upon the addition of glucose (10Lecchi S. Allen K.E. Pardo J.P. Mason A.B. Slayman C.W. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 16624-16632Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Of added significance was the fact that amino acid substitutions within the tail, especially at Thr-912, reduced glucose activation in a manner that could be suppressed by second-site mutations elsewhere in the 100-kDa protein (11Portillo F. Eraso P. Serrano R. FEBS Lett. 1991; 287: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 12Eraso P. Portillo F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10393-10399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Replacing Thr-912 with Ala (to prevent phosphorylation) arrested the ATPase in a trypsin-resistant state characteristic of carbon-starved wild-type cells, whereas replacing it with Asp (to mimic phosphorylation) locked the ATPase in a trypsin-sensitive state typical of glucose-activated wild-type cells (10Lecchi S. Allen K.E. Pardo J.P. Mason A.B. Slayman C.W. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 16624-16632Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results pointed to a key regulatory role of the C-terminal tail, which appears to act in an autoinhibitory fashion during glucose starvation, binding tightly to regions of the N and/or P domains to inhibit ATPase activity. Upon the addition of glucose, the C-terminal tail is released from autoinhibition, most likely through phosphorylation, and allows the ATPase to assume an open, activated conformation. In the work described below, we have used an ensemble of state-of-the-art mass spectrometric methods to map phosphorylation sites throughout the 100-kDa Pma1 ATPase, with the aim of directly identifying the site(s) responsible for glucose activation. The results point conclusively to Ser-911 and Thr-912 in the C-terminal tail, acting in concert as phosphorylation sites that mediate the glucose effect. Yeast Strains—Strain NY13 of S. cerevisiae (MATa ura3-52) was used in this study. For metabolic labeling (see below) the wild-type URA3 allele was integrated downstream from the PMA1 locus to confer growth in the absence of added uracil. Preparation of Plasma Membranes from Carbon-starved and Glucose-metabolizing Cells—Cells were grown to mid-exponential phase at 30 °C in minimal medium containing 4% glucose, harvested, washed twice with water, and incubated with shaking for 1 h in water without glucose. Glucose (4%) was then added back to an aliquot of the culture for 30 min (glucose-metabolizing cells (GM)), 2The abbreviations used are: GM, glucose-metabolizing cells; CS, carbon-starved cells; MALDI TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; PLB, phospholamban; SERCA, sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase; MS, mass spectroscopy; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; QTOF, quadrupole-time of flight; ETD, electron transfer dissociation. whereas another aliquot was kept in glucose-free medium (carbon-starved cells (CS)). Plasma membranes were prepared from both aliquots as described by Perlin et al. (13Perlin D.S. Harris S.L. Seto-Young D. Haber J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21857-21864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the addition of phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm NaF and 2 mm ammonium molybdate) to each buffer at every step of the preparation. Plasma membranes were resuspended in 1 mm EGTA/Tris and 20% glycerol (pH 7.5) containing phosphatase inhibitors (see above) and protease inhibitor mixture (pepstatin, aprotin, leupeptin, and chymostatin, each at 10 μg/ml). All procedures were carried out at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (14Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphatase Treatment—Where indicated, aliquots of 50 μg of plasma membranes were treated with 50 units of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (New England Biolabs) at 37 °C for 14 h in the presence of protease inhibitors. Sample Preparation for MS Analysis—Plasma membranes (100 μg) from CS and GM cells were individually subjected to SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue, and the 100-kDa Pma1 band was excised, cut into 1-mm3 pieces, and placed in a siliconized tube. The gel pieces were destained with brief washes in 100 mm NH4HCO3, 50% methanol, then dehydrated for 5 min in 25 mm NH4HCO3, 50% acetonitrile and for 30 s in 100% acetonitrile and dried in a vacuum centrifuge for 5 min. Samples were rehydrated in a solution containing 25 mm dithiothreitol in 25 mm NH4HCO3 and reduced for 20 min at 56 °C. Protein alkylation was performed by adding freshly prepared iodoacetamide in 25 mm NH4HCO3 and incubating for 20 min at room temperature in the dark. Gel pieces were dehydrated and dried again as described above. To perform in-gel digestion, the gel pieces were rehydrated in 25 mm NH4HCO3, 3% acetonitrile containing 20 ng/μlof trypsin (Promega sequencing grade modified), Lys-C (Roche Applied Science sequencing grade), chymotrypsin (Worthington), Glu-C, or Asp-N (Sigma) and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Digested peptides were extracted by vortexing for 15 min in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. A second extraction was performed using 70% acetonitrile, 25% H2O, 5% trifluoroacetic acid. Extracted peptides from survey samples were dried in a vacuum centrifuge and reconstituted in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (15Jimenez, C. R., Huang, L., Qiu, Y., and Burlingame, A. L. (1998) in Current Protocols in Protein Science (Coligan, J. E., Dunn, B. M., Ploegh, H. L., Speicher, D. W., and Wingfield, P. T., eds) pp. 4.1–4.5, John Wiley & Sons, New YorkGoogle Scholar). The samples were then solid phase-extracted using C18-Zip-Tips (Millipore). Metabolic Labeling with a Stable Isotope—Non-labeled cells (for the 14N samples) were grown in minimal medium prepared with regular yeast nitrogen base lacking amino acids. For the 15N-labeled samples, cells were grown in minimal medium prepared with yeast nitrogen base lacking amino acids and ammonium sulfate to which [15N]ammonium sulfate (99 atom %; Isotec) had been added. The rest of the experiment was carried out as described under “Results.” MALDI TOF/TOF Mass Spectrometry—A Sciex 4800 MALDI TOF/TOF (Applied Biosystems) was used to analyze the in-gel digests. An MS scan was conducted from 700 to 4000 m/z, and the 10 most abundant peaks with signal to noise ratios >10 were selected for tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) experiments. Data were analyzed using Explorer 4000 software (Version 3.6) and searched with Mascot 2.1 (Matrix Science) against a list of yeast protein sequences downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) (16Perkins D.N. Pappin D.J. Creasy D.M. Cottrell J.S. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 3551-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (6814) Google Scholar). Searches allowed up to two missed cleavages for a given enzyme and MS and MS/MS tolerances of ±0.4 Da. Variable modifications included carbamimidomethylation of cysteine, deamidation of asparagine and glutamine, oxidation of methionine, phosphorylation of serine, threonine, and tyrosine, and N-terminal acetylation of the protein. Three-dimensional Ion-trap Mass Spectrometry—In-gel-digested samples were analyzed with an Agilent 1100 series LC/MSD ion trap mass spectrometer. Samples were loaded with an autosampler (Agilent) onto a C18 reverse-phase trap cartridge (Agilent). After loading, the trap cartridge was switched in-line with an analytical 75-μm × 150-mm column packed with 3.5-μm Zorbax C18 reversed-phase particles (Agilent) and a gradient conducted with an Agilent 1100 series capillary HPLC system. Peptides were eluted with a gradient of buffer A (0.1% v/v formic acid) and buffer B (95% v/v acetonitrile and 0.1% v/v formic acid) by 5–60% buffer B in 90 min. The instrument was operated in a data-dependent fashion with an MS survey scan (300–2200 m/z) followed by MS/MS or MS/MS/MS analysis (300–2200 m/z) of as many as the five most intense peaks with dynamic exclusion for 120 s of fragmented m/z values. All ion trap MS2 and MS3 data were converted to Mascot generic files with DataAnalysis 2.2 (Agilent) using default settings. Mascot generic format (MGF) files were then searched using Mascot with the same parameters as described above except that MS and MS/MS tolerances were set to ±0.8 Da. QTOF Mass Spectrometry—Trypsin, Lys-C, chymotrypsin, and Glu-C digests were analyzed using a QTOF2 mass spectrometer (Micromass) coupled to an HP 1100 HPLC (Agilent). Separations were conducted using home-pulled fused silica columns (100 μm × 10 cm) packed with Eclipse C18 particles (Agilent) and eluted at ∼500 nl/min with a gradient of buffer A (0.1% formic acid v/v) and buffer B (95% v/v acetonitrile, 0.1% v/v formic acid). After loading samples in 5% buffer B, the gradient was 5–12% buffer B in 10 min, 12–50% buffer B in 105 min, 50–60% buffer B in 5 min, and 60–100% buffer B in 5 min. The instrument was operated in a data-dependent fashion with an MS scan (400–2200 m/z) with as many as 2 m/z values selected for MS/MS experiments (50–2200 m/z). After being selected for tandem MS, individual m/z peaks within 2 Da were dynamically excluded for 120 s. QTOF MS/MS data were converted to peak list files using ProteinLynx Global Server 2.15 (Waters). The MS and MS/MS scans were smoothed twice with a Savitzky-Golay smooth. MS scans were background-subtracted using the standard method with a first-order polynomial, whereas MS/MS data were background-subtracted with the adaptive method and a fifth-order polynomial, and the data were saved as peak lists. Peak list files were then searched with Mascot using the same parameters as described above except that MS and MS/MS tolerances were set to ±0.3 Da. Isotopic Measurements—Metabolizing cells were grown in standard (14N) medium and starving cells in 15N-enriched medium (two experiments), and a third experiment was performed but with the labels reversed. Combined samples were analyzed by QTOF mass spectrometry (see above), and data were processed as previously described (17Nelson C.J. Huttlin E.L. Hegeman A.D. Harms A.C. Sussman M.R. Proteomics. 2007; 7: 1279-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were searched using Mascot 2.0 with amino acid masses corresponding to natural abundance (14N) and then searched again with amino acid masses corresponding to 15N-labeling. Both sets of searches were conducted with the same modifications as those used for isotopically unlabeled samples except that deamidation was not allowed in the 15N searches because this modification would be indistinguishable due to the isotopic label. The results from heavy and light searches were combined, and extracted ion chromatograms were generated 0.25 m/z wide for the monoisotopic m/z value and the 100% 15N incorporation of identified peptides. In addition, extracted ion chromatograms were generated for m/z values corresponding to the double-, triple-, quadruple, and quintuple-charged forms of the 896STRSVEDFMAAMQRVSTQHET918 peptide with zero, one, and two phosphate moieties. Linear regression was used to calculate a 15N/14N ratio using extracted ion chromatogram values for the monoisotopic peak and the peak corresponding to the peptide with 100% 15N incorporation using Mathematica 5.1 (Wolfram Research). Ratios with an R-value greater than 0.85 were used to determine GM:CS measurements. For a given phosphorylation state of the peptide, the measurements from all charge states were averaged. Because the monoisotopic peak and the 100% 15N incorporation peak represent different fractions of their respective isotopic envelopes, a correction was calculated and applied to the measured ratio. Localization of Phosphorylation Sites by Electron Transfer Dissociation (ETD)-MS/MS—An ETD-enabled ThermoFisher linear ion trap-orbitrap hybrid mass spectrometer was employed to determine the exact sites of phosphorylation on peptides P1 and P2 from CS and GM samples (18McAlister G.C. Phanstiel D. Good D.M. Berggren W.T. Coon J.J. Anal. Chem. 2007; 79: 3525-3534Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Peptide separations were performed on a reversed-phase, self-prepared capillary column. The separation column consisted of a precolumn that was butt-connected to an analytical column using a 0.012-inch inner diameter Teflon sleeve (Zeus Industrial Products, Orangeburg, SC). The analytical column was 360 μm × 50 μm (outer diameter × inner diameter) fused silica (Polymicro Technologies, Phoenix, AR) and was prepared by pulling a bottle neck and integrated ESI tip using a laser puller (Sutter Instrument Co., Novarto, CA, model P-2000) as described elsewhere (19Martin S.E. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Marto J.A. Anal. Chem. 2000; 72: 4266-4274Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Approximately 1–2 mm of 5–20-μm C18 particles (YMC, Milford, MA) followed by 7 cm of 5-μm C18 particles (Alltech Associates Inc., Deerfield, IL) were packed into the analytical column. The precolumn was made of 360-μm × 75-μm (outer diameter × inner diameter) fused silica and incorporated a LiChrosorb frit (EMD Chemicals Inc., Gibbstown, NJ) of ∼2 mm in length. The precolumn was then packed with 5 cm of 5-μm C18 particles. Approximately 2 pmol of Lys-C-digested Pma1 were loaded onto the column, and on-line peptide separations were performed with an Agilent 1100 Series binary HPLC system coupled to the ETD-enabled orbitrap. The sample was eluted from the column at a flow rate of 60 nl/min into the mass spectrometer using a linear gradient of buffer A (0.1 m acetic acid) and buffer B (70% v/v acetonitrile in 0.1 m acetic acid) at 0–100% B in 60 min. The mass spectrometer was operated in a targeted ion fashion. First, a full scan (300–2000 m/z) mass spectrum was acquired using the orbitrap at a nominal resolving power of 30,000. The following precursor cations were isolated and subjected to a 100-ms ETD reaction: 668.1, 676.6, 688.1, 696.6, 708.1, 716.6 m/z. These ions corresponded to the unphosphorylated, singly phosphorylated, and doubly phosphorylated forms of the 896–918 peptide that were 14N- and 15N-labeled in the [M + 4H]4+ charged state. Relevant scans were manually sequenced. Recovery of Peptide Fragments for Analysis—As described in the Introduction, the central goal of this study was to identify sites of protein phosphorylation that are mechanistically related to the activation of Pma1 ATPase by glucose. The first step was to prepare plasma membranes from CS and GM cells, purify the ATPase, subject it to in-gel proteolytic digestion, and perform mass spectrometric analyses. To maximize coverage of the protein, five different proteases were used: trypsin, Lys-C, chymotrypsin, Glu-C, and Asp-N. Fig. 1 is a topological map of the ATPase showing that peptides corresponding to 78% of the cytoplasmic part of the protein were identified (see the supplemental Appendix for a complete table of results). Most of the undetected peptides were located in the 10 transmembrane segments of the ATPase, where the predicted proteolytic fragments are generally too large and/or too hydrophobic to be observed by MS analysis. Two regions of the N-terminal extension (Asp-31—Gly-70 and Asp-83—Lys-98) and the short loop between transmembrane segments 6 and 7 were also missing from the list of recovered peptides. Differential Phosphorylation in the C-terminal Tail Correlates with Glucose Activation of Pma1—As illustrated in Fig. 2, peptide 896–918 (P0; m/z 890.5, 2671.5 Da), obtained after digestion with Lys-C, was identified by LC-MS/MS using the three-dimensional ion trap mass spectrometer in both CS and GM samples. This peptide corresponds to the C-terminal tail of the ATPase: 896STRSVEDFMAAMQRVSTQHEKET918. Both CS and GM samples also contained peptide 896–916 (2437.15 Da), in which Lys-C cleavage had occurred at Lys-916. The signal for 896–916 was much less intense than that for 896–918, presumably reflecting the fact that cleavage at Lys-916 was strongly inhibited by the flanking Glu residues (20Thiede B. Lamer S. Mattow J. Siejak F. Dimmler C. Rudel T. Jungblut P.R. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2000; 14: 496-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Furthermore, peptide 896–916 is found in Pma2, a poorly expressed isoform of yeast plasma membrane H+-ATPase (21Schlesser A. Ulaszewski S. Ghislain M. Goffeau A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19480-19487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas peptide 896–918 is unique to Pma1. For both reasons, most of the analysis focused on 896–918. In addition to P0, both the carbon-starved and glucose-metabolizing samples contained a peptide whose mass was ∼80 Da heavier than the unmodified 896–918, as expected for a singly phosphorylated form (P1; m/z 917.2). The glucose-metabolizing sample also contained a peptide whose mass was consistent with a doubly phosphorylated form of 896–918 (P2; m/z 943.8). Neither sample gave any detectable evidence for higher multiples of phosphorylation of peptide 896–918. When peptides P1 and P2 were analyzed by MS/MS on the three-dimensional ion trap, the spectrum for P1 displayed a single dominant peak corresponding to a neutral loss of 98 Da from the parent peptide, whereas the spectrum for P2 showed two abundant peaks, corresponding to the loss of one and two phosphate moieties (Fig. 3). This is the expected signature for phosphopeptides. Unlike most peptides that undergo random protonation along the backbone in the gas phase to generate a series of sequence-informative fragments by collisional activation, phosphopeptides are preferentially cleaved at the phosphate group, leaving the peptide backbone intact (22Coon J.J. Ueberheide B. Syka J.E. Dryhurst D.D. Ausio J. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 9463-9468Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Taken together the results are consistent with the idea that the C-terminal tail of Pma1 ATPase is singly phosphorylated in carbon-starved cells and undergoes a second phosphorylation during glucose activation. However, the lack of peptide backbone fragmentation upon collisional activation made it impossible to locate the sites of phosphorylation in the P1 and P2 peptides by this approach. Locating the Phosphorylation Sites—We, therefore, turned to a new peptide fragmentation method known as ETD (18McAlister G.C. Phanstiel D. Good D.M. Berggren W.T. Coon J.J. Anal. Chem. 2007; 79: 3525-3534Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 22Coon J.J. Ueberheide B. Syka J.E. Dryhurst D.D. Ausio J. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

ETD is performed in an ion-trap mass spectrometer by reacting isolated peptide cation precursors with small-molecule radical anions. The reaction results in the transfer of an electron to the peptide cation, which then dissociates randomly to generate a series of peptide backbone cleavages while preserving labile posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation. The present study employed a new instrument equipped with a secondary orbitrap mass analyzer, allowing the intact peptide mass to be recorded with high m/z resolution and accuracy. Peptide P1 was sequenced from an 14N-labeled CS sample and an 15N-labeled GM sample that had been mixed together before the isolation of plasma membranes (see next section). Inspection of the ETD-MS/MS spectra revealed that 14N-labeled peptide P1 from CS cells was phosphorylated at Thr-912 (Fig. 4A). Identical results were seen for the 15N-labeled P1 from GM cells (Fig. 4B). By contrast, peptide P2, which was found only in samples from GM cells, was phosphorylated at both Ser-911 and Thr-912 (Fig. 5A–C). In parallel, the shorter peptide 896–916 from GM samples was also found to be phosphorylated at both Ser-911 and Thr-912 (Fig. 5D). Thus, Thr-912 appears to be a constitutive site of phosphorylation in Pma1 ATPase, whereas Ser-911 becomes phosphorylated during glucose activation.FIGURE 5ETD-MS/MS spectra of peptide P2 from the C-terminal tail of Pma1 ATPase, demonstrating phosphorylation on both Ser-911 and Thr-912. GM cells were grown for this experiment in 15N-enriched medium and doubly phosphorylated forms of peptide 896–918 (panels A–C) and peptide 896–916 (panel D) were studied. A, within the isolation window of the target peptide precursor cation, a co-eluting peptide cation could be seen with the same nominal m/z value but a different charge state (peptide 2, m/z value 716.349). The isotopic cluster m/z peaks corresponding to the doubly phosphorylated form of Pma1 peptide 896–918 are marked with open circles, whereas those corresponding to the co-eluting peptide are marked with closed circles. B, upon ETD fragmentation, c- and z-type product ions were generated from both peptide precursor cations. From these fragments, the target peptide and sites of phosphorylation (Ser-911 and Thr-912) could readily be determined. Fragment ions arising from the co-eluting peptide cation were also observed and have been denoted with an asterisk. C, calculation of the theoretical mass and isotopic distribution for the identified phosphopeptide revealed an identical match to the observed full MS spectrum and differed by only 5 ppm. Note that the y axis was magnified 50-fold in regions marked by brackets. D, ETD-MS/MS spectra of the doubly phosphorylated form of peptide 896–916. Analysis of consecutive backbone fragment ions from either the C terminus (z-type) or N terminus (c-type) made it possible to identify the phosphorylation site on this peptide as Ser-911 and Thr-912.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To make certain that Thr-912 was the only phosphorylation site in peptide P1, the c- and z-type ions were carefully examined along the peptide backbone. The c-type ion series did not exhibit the +80 addition until c7; likewise, the z-type ion series exhibited a +80 addition at z17. To rule out the possibility of a second isoform, singly phosphorylated at Ser-911, we searched for the presence of unmodified c7 and z17, but no m/z peaks corresponding to those values were detected. In addition to Ser-911 and Thr-912, the C-terminal tail of Pma1 AT"

A 350-kilometer-high volcanic plume was seen to emanate from the Tvashtar volcano (62Â°N, 122Â°W), and its motion was observed. The plume's morphology and dynamics support nonballistic models of large Io plumes and also suggest that most visible plume particles condensed within the plume rather than being ejected from the source. In images taken in Jupiter eclipse, nonthermal visible-wavelength emission was seen from individual volcanoes near Io's sub-Jupiter and anti-Jupiter points. Near-infrared emission from the brightest volcanoes indicates minimum magma temperatures in the 1150- to 1335-kelvin range, consistent with basaltic composition."
https://openalex.org/W2015462677,"Regulation of cell type-specific gene transcription is central to cellular differentiation and development. During spermatogenesis, a number of testis-specific genes are expressed in a precise spatiotemporal order. How these genes remain silent in the somatic tissues is not well understood. Our previous studies using the round spermatid-specific mouse SP-10 gene, which codes for an acrosomal protein, revealed that its proximal promoter acts as an insulator and prevents expression in the somatic tissues. Here we report that the insulator tethers the SP-10 gene to the nuclear matrix in somatic tissues, sequestering the core promoter in the process, thus preventing transcription. In round spermatids where the SP-10 gene is expressed, this tethering is released. TAR DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43), previously shown to interact with the SP-10 insulator, was found to be in the 2 m NaCl-insoluble nuclear matrix fraction. TDP-43 prevented enhancer-promoter interactions when artificially recruited between the two by Gal4 strategy. Knockdown of TDP-43 using small interfering RNA released the enhancer-blocking effect of the SP-10 insulator in a stable cell culture model. Mutation of TDP-43 binding sites abolished this effect. Finally, a 50-bp subfragment of the SP-10 insulator, which includes TDP-43 binding sites, functioned as a minimal insulator in transgenic mice and silenced an otherwise ectopically expressed transgene in somatic tissues. The SP-10 insulator lacks CpG dinucleotides or CTCF binding sites.

Thus, the present study characterized a novel vertebrate insulator in a physiological context and showed for the first time how a testis-specific gene is silenced in the somatic tissues by an insulator. Regulation of transcription of a tissue-specific gene is central to cellular differentiation and development. Mechanisms must be in place not only to activate the gene in the correct cell type but also to keep the gene silenced in all other tissues. We study this problem using the mouse testis-specific SP-10 gene as a model. The SP-10 gene codes for an acrosomal protein conserved in mammals and is exclusively expressed in round spermatids (1Reddi P.P. Flickinger C.J. Herr J.C. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 61: 1256-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In this report, we address the mechanism of transcriptional silencing of the SP-10 gene in the somatic tissues. Our previous work in transgenic mice showed that the SP-10 proximal promoter performs dual functions; it activates testis-specific transcription and also acts as an insulator preventing the possibility of transcription in the somatic tissues (2Reddi P.P. Shore A.N. Shapiro J.A. Anderson A. Stoler M.H. Acharya K.K. Dev. Biol. 2003; 262: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Insulators are DNA sequences located at gene boundaries (3Kellum R. Schedl P. Cell. 1991; 64: 941-950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Their action prevents ectopic expression of genes they flank. Insulators are operationally defined as enhancer blockers and barrier elements. Enhancer-blocking insulators prevent a foreign enhancer from inappropriately encroaching into the promoter of the neighboring gene. The barrier insulators prevent the spread of heterochromatin and thus prevent untimely shut down of gene expression. Insulators may possess only one or both of the above properties (4West A.G.

The imprinting control region located between the Igf2 and H19 genes and the Tsix imprinting/choice center on the mammalian X chromosome are two other well characterized vertebrate insulators with enhancer-blocking properties. The imprinting control region governs the parent of origin-specific expression of Igf2 and H19, depending on whether or not it is bound by the 11-zinc finger protein, CTCF (9Bell A.C. Felsenfeld G.

Nature. 2000; 405: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (1202) Google Scholar). Similarly, the Tsix imprinting/choice center acts as an enhancer blocker when bound by CTCF and prevents Xist gene expression, thus marking the active X chromosome (11Chao W. Huynh K.D. Spencer R.J. Davidow L.S. Lee J.T. Science. 2002; 295: 345-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Both the imprinting control region and the Tsix imprinting/choice center insulators contain CpG dinucleotides, the methylation status of which dictates occupancy by CTCF. A number of other vertebrate insulators also contain CpG dinucleotides and binding sites for CTCF. These include the insulators at the ribosomal RNA genes of Xenopus (12Robinett C.C. O'Connor A.

We reported that the SP-10 insulator binds to TDP-43 (TAR DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa) and that mutation of TDP-43 binding sites compromised enhancer-blocking function (17Acharya K.K. Govind C.K.

Therefore, we anticipate that the study of the SP-10 insulator will uncover novel mechanisms of insulator function. Here, we have addressed the mechanism of SP-10 insulator function in the endogenous context; investigated the requirement of TDP-43 for SP-10 insulator function; and, finally, determined whether a 50-bp subfragment can function as a minimal insulator capable of silencing a transgene in the somatic tissues.

COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. Flp-In CV-1 stable cell lines were purchased from Invitrogen.

Following lithium diiodosalicylate-mediated extraction, the nuclei were digested with 100 μg/ml RNase-free DNase I (Roche Applied Science) for 3 h at room temperature. Matrices were collected by centrifugation for 5 min at 1500 × g; washed twice with extraction buffer; and resuspended in Tris-EDTA (TE), 0.1% SDS, and 1 mg/ml proteinase K. Extracts were incubated at 55 °C overnight. The DNA associated with these preparations was precipitated after phenol/chloroform extraction (matrix-bound DNA). Total genomic DNA was also extracted in parallel. PCR was performed using matrix bound as well as genomic DNA as template. The SP-10 –1.9/+1.6 kb genomic region was analyzed using primer sets, each yielding an ∼270-bp amplicon at 100-bp intervals as shown in Fig. 1A. A typical PCR contained 10 pmol of each primer, 1 μl of 10 mm dNTP mix, 0.5 μlof Taq, and 5 ng of template in a 50-μl volume. The cycling conditions were 94 °C for 3 min, followed by 27 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s/55 °C for 30 s/72 °C for 30 s with a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. The amplification was in a linear range under these conditions. Fold enrichment values were obtained by taking ratios of band intensities of amplicons generated from matrix DNA/genomic DNA. Band intensities were quantitated using ImageQuant software.

Cell Biol. 1977; 74: 68-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar). Typically, testes from 10–12-week-old Swiss Webster mice were subjected to StaPut to obtain ∼20–40 × 106 round spermatids. Alternatively, testicular germ cells from 25-day-old male mice were used as a source of round spermatids (85–90% pure). To obtain day 25 germ cells, testes from 10 mice were decapsulated and subjected to enzymatic treatment (collagenase, hyaluronidase, trypsin, and DNase) to release the cells. These were collected and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Round spermatids obtained from either source were used to prepare nuclear matrix. High Salt Matrix Preparation—High salt matrices from cultured cells were essentially prepared as described (19Yusufzai T.M. Felsenfeld G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 8620-8624Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In short, cells were incubated in RSB buffer for 10 min on ice, homogenized 10 times with a Dounce homogenizer by using a loose pestle, and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Pelleted nuclei were washed twice in RSB and 0.25 m sucrose, resuspended in RSB and 2 m sucrose, and centrifuged at 34,000 × g for 10 min. Pelleted nuclei were washed once in RSB and 0.25 m sucrose; resuspended in RSB, 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm Cacl2 and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; and digested for 3 h with 100 μg/ml RNase free DNase I (Roche Applied Science) at room temperature on a nutator mixer. After digestion, the nuclei were pelleted at 1500 × g for 5 min, and supernant was removed. These nuclei were then extracted with extraction buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA) containing an increasing amount of NaCl ranging from 0.1 to 2.0 m. For each concentration of salt, the digested nuclei were washed three times with 3 pellet volumes of extraction buffer, followed by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 5 min. The three washes were combined at each step and mixed with loading buffer. An equal volume of each was used for Western blotting. The final 2 m salt-insoluble nuclear matrix was solubilized directly in loading buffer in an equivalent volume. Western Blotting and Antibodies—Polyclonal antibodies to TDP-43 were raised in guinea pigs as mentioned (17Acharya K.K. Govind C.K. Shore A.N. Stoler M. Reddi P.P. Dev. Biol. 2006; 295: 781-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Anti-Gal4DBD (catalog number sc510) and anti-lamin A/C (catalog number sc6215) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibody to histone H3 (catalog number sc10809) was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. All blots were developed using an Immobilon Western kit from Millipore. DNA Constructs—Full-length murine TDP-43 (NM_145556) was amplified from mouse testis Marathon-ready cDNA (Clontech) and cloned in pCR II-TOPO vector. This clone was used as a template to generate NH2-terminal deletion (ΔRRM1; amino acids 169–414) or COOH-terminal deletion (ΔGly; amino acids 1–274) mutants using PCR. Gal4 Assay Constructs—To make DNA binding domain (DBD) fusion proteins, full-length or mutant forms of TDP-43 were cloned in pFA-CMV vector (Stratagene) as BamH I-XbaI fragments in frame with the Gal4 BD. Expression of the fusion proteins in GC-2 cells was confirmed by Western blotting. The control SP-10 open reading frame was cloned similarly. A construct expressing the p53-BD fusion was a gift from Dr. Rong Li (Dept. of Biochemistry, University of Virginia). The reporter plasmid was constructed as follows. The 5× Gal element was PCR-amplified from pFR-Luc plasmid (Stratagene) and was ligated into BglII site of pGL3 –91/+28Luc (as described in Ref. 2Reddi P.P. Shore A.N. Shapiro J.A. Anderson A. Stoler M.H. Acharya K.K. Dev. Biol. 2003; 262: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Thus, the 5× Gal site separates CMV enhancer and mouse SP-10 core promoter, allowing recruitment of the Gal4DBD fusion proteins between the enhancer and the core promoter. Luciferase Reporter Gene Constructs—Luciferase reporter constructs were built using the pGL3basic vector (Promega). Refer to Fig. 5A for a schematic illustration of all constructs. The coordinates for mouse SP-10 promoter sequence are as per Fig. 7 in Ref. 2Reddi P.P. Shore A.N. Shapiro J.A. Anderson A. Stoler M.H. Acharya K.K. Dev. Biol. 2003; 262: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar (GenBank™ accession number AF 133710). The SP-10 core promoter (–91/+28) was PCR-amplified with BglII (5′ end) and HindIII (3′ end) sites using the –408SP10-gfp plasmid (1Reddi P.P. Flickinger C.J. Herr J.C. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 61: 1256-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) as template and cloned into BglII + HindIII-cut CMV-pGL3 (2Reddi P.P. Shore A.N. Shapiro J.A. Anderson A. Stoler M.H. Acharya K.K. Dev. Biol. 2003; 262: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), creating construct 1 (Fig. 5A). The 319-bp insulator (–408/–92 portion of the SP-10 promoter) from plasmid –408SP10-gfp was PCR-amplified with BglII restriction enzyme sites on both sides and cloned into the BglII site of construct 1, creating construct 5. The 50-bp SP-10 insulator (–186/–135 of the SP-10 promoter) was PCR-amplified with BglII restriction enzyme sites from –408SP10-gfp and cloned into the BglII site of construct 1. Clones bearing the 50-bp insulator in both forward and reverse direction were generated (constructs 2 and 4 in Fig. 5A). Additionally, a clone containing three head to tail copies of the 50-bp insulator (i.e. all in forward orientation) was selected, giving rise to construct 3 of Fig. 5A. The 50-bp insulator bearing KpnI sites on both ends was cloned into KpnI-cleaved construct 1, which placed the insulator upstream of the CMV enhancer in the correct as well as reverse orientations, giving rise to constructs 6 and 7, respectively. To generate reporter constructs with the thymidine kinase (TK) core promoter, a 92-base pair fragment corresponding to the –61/+31 (wherein +1 corresponds to the transcriptional start site) region of the HSV TK gene promoter was PCR-amplified from pRL-TK (Promega, WI) with BglII and HindIII sites and cloned into CMV-pGL3 (2Reddi P.P. Shore A.N. Shapiro J.A. Anderson A. Stoler M.H. Acharya K.K. Dev. Biol. 2003; 262: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This base construct (construct 8; Fig. 5A) was then used to clone in the 50-bp SP-10 insulator in both orientations as described above, creating constructs 9 and 10. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Transient Transfection Assays—Transient transfections were performed in COS-7 or GC-2 cells using Mirus TransIT™-LT1 (Mirus Corp.) transfection reagent. 1.5 × 105 Cells were plated in 6-well plates, and typically, the total amount of DNA transfected per well was 1 μg. Cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection. The plasmid pRL-TK (Promega) was cotransfected at a 1:10 ratio with the reporter to normalize for transfection efficiency. Luciferase activities were measured by the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) according to the instructions provided with the kit. Normalized luciferase values were plotted in histograms. For Gal4DBD-based assays, 2.0 × 105 cells were seeded and transfected with 1 μg each of reporter and effector construct. The luciferase assay was done 48 h post-transfection. Generation of Stable CV-1 Cell Lines—CV-1 stable cell lines were generated using the Flp-In system (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's instructions. In short, four cassettes ((i) CMV-SP10 core-luciferase, (ii) CMV-(–408/–92) insulator-SP10 core-luciferase, (iii) CMV-mutant –408/–92 insulator-SP10 core-luciferase (the two GTGTGT motifs at –172 and –160 mutated), and (iv) CMV-stuffer-SP10 core-luciferase) were initially cloned in pGL3basic vector (Promega). These cassettes were then cut out and subcloned into pCDNA5FRT vector (Invitrogen). Flp-In CV-1 cells (Invitrogen) were used to cotransfect these expression vectors with pOG44, and hygromycin-resistant clones were selected as per the manufacturer's instructions. For all clones, flippase recombinase target (FRT)-mediated site-specific integration was confirmed by Southern hybridization (data not shown). RNA Interference—TDP-43-specific or control siRNA reagents were purchased from Dharmacon (sequences available upon request). siRNA was introduced into CV-1 cells by reverse transfection using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection for luciferase assay. Generation of Transgenic Mice—Transgenic mouse lines were generated using constructs 1–4 (Fig. 5A). Each transgene was purified as a BamHI fragment. Pronuclear injections were performed by the University of Virginia's Gene Targeting and Transgenic Facility, using standard procedures (21Hogan B. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 226-244Google Scholar). Tail DNA was isolated from founder mice using the Qiagen DNeasy™ tissue kit (Qiagen), and transgenic founders were identified by PCR using primers designed to amplify the entire open reading frame of the luciferase cDNA. Primers LucF (5′-GGTAAAGCCACCATGGAAGACGCCA) and LucR (5′-TTACACGGCGATCTTTCCGCCCTTC) were used as forward and reverse primers, respectively. Amplification of a 1665-bp product identified putative positive founders. The transgenic lines were subsequently confirmed by Southern hybridization using the Luciferase cDNA (Fig. 5B) and the CMV enhancer as probes. Copy Number Estimation for Transgenic Mice—Southern blot hybridization was used to determine the copy number of the transgene in all of the mouse lines that were used for the analysis of luciferase expression. Ten micrograms of tail DNA was digested to completion with BglII, electrophoresed through a 1% agarose gel, and transferred to Duralon-UV™ membrane (Stratagene). Full-length luciferase coding sequence (bp 54–1746 from vector pGL3basic; Promega, WI) was radiolabeled using [α-32P]dCTP and the Prime-a-Gene™ labeling system (Promega). DNA hybridization was performed using ExpressHyb (Clontech) per the manufacturer's recommended protocol. The probed blot was exposed to an Amersham Biosciences storage phosphor screen and scanned in on an Amersham Biosciences Storm 860. For copy number analysis, the blot image was imported into Amersham Biosciences ImageQuant version 5.0. Within ImageQuant, a box was placed over each band on the blot, and volume quantification was performed on all bands after the subtraction of background. The Southern blot image (Fig. 5B) was carefully analyzed to identify bands corresponding to single copy integration versus multiple copy integration of the transgene. Because of the location of a BglII site at the 5′ end of the core promoter in all constructs used for making transgenic mice, single copy integration would result in a hybridization signal above 2 kb. Because of the presence of a second BglII site at the 3′ end of the CMV enhancer, head to head ligated multiple copy transgene integration would result in a strong hybridization signal at 2.4 kb for constructs 1–4. Head to tail ligated multiple copy integration would result in a hybridization signal at 4 kb for all of the constructs. The transgenic mouse line (line 540), which generated a single hybridization signal that is at neither 2.4 nor 4 kb (Fig. 5B, lane 5), represented single copy integration, and the volume of that band was taken as a standard single integration volume to determine the copy number of the rest of the lines. The volume of each hybridization band from each line was divided by that single-integration volume to determine the number of copies each band represented on the blot. The total value for each of the bands was then added up to give the total copy number of that particular mouse line. Copy number was independently estimated and confirmed using the CMV enhancer region (XhoI-released fragment from CMV-TOPO) (2Reddi P.P. Shore A.N. Shapiro J.A. Anderson A. Stoler M.H. Acharya K.K. Dev. Biol. 2003; 262: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) as probe on the same blot as described above (data not shown). Luciferase Assays on Tissues from Transgenic Mice—Tissues were harvested from 8–12-week-old transgenic male mice as well as nontransgenic littermates and immediately placed in Promega passive lysis buffer, manually homogenized, and left to sit at room temperature for 15 min. The homogenized tissues were then frozen until analysis. Upon thawing, lysed tissue samples were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 2 min to remove debris; the supernatant was transferred to a new microcentrifuge tube. Soluble protein was quantified using the Bio-Rad protein quantification reagent (catalog number 500-0006) using the manufacturer's recommended protocol. The luciferase analysis was performed on a Turner Designs TD20/20 luminometer with Promega luciferase assay reagent. Luciferase assays were standardized by protein amount; 50 μg of protein was used for each tissue analyzed. The highest luciferase activity obtained from any tissue of nontransgenic littermates was 0.15. Therefore, we considered 0.15 as the background cut-off and subtracted this from the luciferase activities of transgenic mice. The SP-10 Insulator Is Associated with the Nuclear Matrix—We previously demonstrated using transgenic mice as an assay system that the proximal promoter of the spermatid-specific mouse SP-10 gene functions as an enhancer-blocking insulator in the somatic tissues. In round spermatids, where the SP-10 gene is expressed, the insulator function is relieved. Here we investigated the mechanism of the SP-10 insulator function in its native context. Previous studies reported a close association between insulator elements and components of nuclear matrix (22Gerasimova T.I. Byrd K. Corces V.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1025-1035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 23Gilbert N. Gilchrist S. Bickmore W.A. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2005; 242: 283-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 24Gaszner M. Felsenfeld G. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2006; 9: 703-713Crossref Scopus (489) Google Scholar). To determine whether the SP-10 insulator operates by tethering to the nuclear matrix, we employed an in vivo matrix attachment assay. In this assay, a combination of mild detergent and lithium diiodosalicylate is used to detach proteins from nuclei without disturbing the native attachment sites (18Mirkovitch J. Mirault M.E. Laemmli U.K. Cell. 1984; 39: 223-232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar, 19Yusufzai T.M. Felsenfeld G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 8620-8624Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Nuclei obtained from mouse liver cells (SP-10 gene silent) or round spermatids (SP-10 gene expressed) were washed with mild detergent, extracted with lithium diiodosalicylate, and then digested with DNase I. After digestion, the nuclear matrices were prepared as described, and the associated DNA was purified. To determine whether the SP-10 gene insulator is attached to the matrix, we PCR-amplified a series of 270-bp segments at 100-bp intervals spanning the –2.0 to +1.6 kb region of the mouse SP-10 gene and plotted the -fold enrichment (Fig. 1A). In liver cells where the SP-10 gene is not expressed, the region corresponding to –266/+28 was found enriched up to 20-fold in the nuclear matrix fraction as compared with the adjacent sequences on either side (Fig. 1B). PCR amplification using primers corresponding to the larger –408/+28 region also showed similar enrichment as the –266/+28 region (data not presented). This specific enrichment, however, was completely lost in the case of round spermatids where the SP-10 gene is expressed (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that the proximal promoter region of the SP-10 gene is sequestered within the nuclear matrix in cells that do not express SP-10 and that it is released within the differentiating spermatogenic cells, thus allowing SP-10 gene transcription. We confirmed this differential tethering by varying the source of the cell type. Similar to liver cells, enrichment of the SP-10 proximal promoter was observed within the nuclear matrix in GC2 tissue culture cells as well (data not shown). We used day 25 postnatal mouse testicular germ cells as an alternate source of SP-10-expressing cells. At postnatal day 25, a majority of the cells in mouse testis will be round spermatids because of the synchronous nature of the first wave of seminiferous epithelium. Similar to the round spermatids isolated from adult mice, the day 25 spermatids also showed no enrichment of SP-10 promoter region in the nuclear matrix (data not shown). To our knowledge, this is the first direct comparison of attachment properties of an insulator in two different scenarios of gene expression. TDP-43, the SP-10 Insulator-binding Protein, Is Co-localized in the Matrix—We previously reported identification of TDP-43 (TAR DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa) using a portion of the SP-10 insulator to screen a cDNA expression library (17Acharya K.K. Govind C.K. Shore A.N. Stoler M. Reddi P.P. Dev. Biol. 2006; 295: 781-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). TDP-43 was originally cloned using the HIV TAR region and shown to be a transcriptional repressor (25Ou S.H. Wu F. Harrich D. Garcia-Martinez L.F. Gaynor R.B. J. V"
https://openalex.org/W1996299717,"Cholesterol affects diverse biological processes, in many cases by modulating the function of integral membrane proteins. We observed that alterations of cochlear cholesterol modulate hearing in mice. Mammalian hearing is powered by outer hair cell (OHC) electromotility, a membrane-based motor mechanism that resides in the OHC lateral wall. We show that membrane cholesterol decreases during maturation of OHCs. To study the effects of cholesterol on hearing at the molecular level, we altered cholesterol levels in the OHC wall, which contains the membrane protein prestin. We show a dynamic and reversible relationship between membrane cholesterol levels and voltage dependence of prestin-associated charge movement in both OHCs and prestin-transfected HEK 293 cells. Cholesterol levels also modulate the distribution of prestin within plasma membrane microdomains and affect prestin self-association in HEK 293 cells. These findings indicate that alterations in membrane cholesterol affect prestin function and functionally tune the outer hair cell."
https://openalex.org/W2043532306,"We report for the first time the stabilization of an immunoglobulin fold domain by an engineered disulfide bond. In the llama single-domain antibody, which has human chorionic gonadotropin as its specific antigen, Ala49 and Ile70 are buried in the structure. A mutant with an artificial disulfide bond at this position showed a 10 °C higher midpoint temperature of thermal unfolding than that without the extra disulfide bond. The modified domains exhibited an antigen binding affinity comparable with that of the wild-type domain. Ala49 and Ile70 are conserved in camel and llama single-domain antibody frameworks. Therefore, domains against different antigens are expected to be stabilized by the engineered disulfide bond examined here. In addition to the effect of the loop constraints in the unfolded state, thermodynamic analysis indicated that internal interaction and hydration also control the stability of domains with disulfide bonds. The change in physical properties resulting from mutation often causes unpredictable and destabilizing effects on these interactions. The introduction of a hydrophobic cystine into the hydrophobic region maintains the hydrophobicity of the protein and is expected to minimize the unfavorable mutational effects.

The introduction of a hydrophobic cystine into the hydrophobic region maintains the hydrophobicity of the protein and is expected to minimize the unfavorable mutational effects. One of the major objectives of antibody engineering is to stabilize the three-dimensional structure of the antibody. Disulfide bonds often significantly stabilize the structure of native proteins. Thus, the introduction of artificial disulfide bonds is recognized as a useful protein engineering technique to increase conformational stability. Although this technique has been applied to many proteins, there are no reports of engineered disulfide bonds in an immunoglobulin fold framework.Cystine is hydrophobic, and thus, most of naturally occurring disulfide bonds are buried in the protein (1Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 151: 261-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar, 2Nagano N. Ota M. Nishikawa K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 69-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 3Rose G.D.

Therefore, the introduction of an engineered disulfide bond into the hydrophobic core better maintains the biophysical properties of the target protein. There are several examples of artificial disulfide bonds that can replace a pair of buried hydrophobic residues, the accessible surface areas of which were <20% (5Dani V.S. Ramakrishnan C.

The introduction of a disulfide bond into the buried hydrophobic core of human carbonic anhydrase (A23C/L203C) markedly stabilizes this enzyme; the midpoint temperature of thermal unfolding (Tm) of the mutant is 10 °C higher than that of the wild-type protein (6Mårtensson L.-G.

On the other hand, subtilisin BPN′ mutants (V26C/A232C and A29C/M119C) exhibit similar or slightly lower stability to irreversible thermal inactivation (8Mitchinson C. Wells J.A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4807-4815Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Tolerance against heat denaturation is not directly correlated with conformational stability. Only the mutational effect on human carbonic anhydrase II (6Mårtensson L.-G. Karlsson M. Carlsson U. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15867-15875Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) was examined in a reversible system. Little information is available about the thermodynamic effects of artificial disulfide bonds in the buried hydrophobic region.In a previous study (12Hagihara Y. Matsuda T. Yumoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24752-24758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), we screened the amino acid pairs substituting for the disulfide bonds of four different immunoglobulin fold domains by a method based on the cellular quality control system (13Hagihara Y. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6619-6624Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 14Hagihara Y. Shiraki K. Nakamura T. Uegaki K. Takagi M. Imanaka T. Yumoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 51043-51048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The intradomain disulfide bonds in the immunoglobulin fold domains are buried and are important for stability (15Goto Y. Hamaguchi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1979; 86: 1433-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 16Ohhashi Y. Hagihara Y. Kozhukh G. Hoshino M. Hasegawa K. Yamaguchi I. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 131: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). At least two pairs combining Ala, Val, or both, i.e. Ala/Ala, Ala/Val, Val/Ala, and Val/Val, were selected in all four domains in the screening, and they were stably folded at 30 °C. These mutants found in three domains exhibited similar or higher stability compared with the corresponding reduced wild-type domains. The pairs using Ala and Ile, Gly and Leu, Gly and Phe, and Gly and Val were also selected in more than two of the four domains. Among those, the stability of one of the Ala/Ile mutants was higher than that of the corresponding reduced domains. This indicates that specific pairs of hydrophobic amino acids can replace the buried disulfide bond with a minimum loss of stability. Conversely, for construction of an artificial disulfide bond, the proximal pair of buried hydrophobic amino acids as reported by a previous study (12Hagihara Y. Matsuda T. Yumoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24752-24758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) may be a good candidate for replacement with cystine.Here, we report the effects of an engineered disulfide bond in the hydrophobic core of the variable domain of the camelid heavy chain antibody (VHH), 2The abbreviations used are:VHHvariable domain of the camelid heavy chain antibodyhCGhuman chorionic gonadotropinDSCdifferential scanning calorimetrySPRsurface plasmon resonanceMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight. 2The abbreviations used are:VHHvariable domain of the camelid heavy chain antibodyhCGhuman chorionic gonadotropinDSCdifferential scanning calorimetrySPRsurface plasmon resonanceMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight. also known as the single-domain antibody. In the three-dimensional structure of llama VHH raised against the α-subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) (17Spinelli S. Frenken L. Bourgeois D. de Ron L. Bos W. Verrips T. Anguille C.

We replaced these two amino acids with Cys in the wild-type and mutant domains, substituting the native disulfide bond with the Trp/Ala amino acid pair. Then, the stability and antigen binding ability of the mutants created were studied by CD, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), pulldown assay, and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectrometry.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPreparation of VHH Mutants—Construction of the expression vector containing wild-type VHH and the mutant lacking a disulfide bond was described previously (12Hagihara Y.

The VHH mutants containing one or no disulfide bond were cloned into pAED4 (18Doering D.S. Matsudaira P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12677-12685Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and mutant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) pLysS (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), where they accumulated in inclusion bodies. These inclusion bodies were dissolved with 6 m guanidine hydrochloride or 8 m urea, followed by overnight air oxidation at 4 °C. Proteins in the denaturant were refolded by 1:50 dilution with 10 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.3 or 4.7). A Resource S cation-exchange column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 10 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.3 or 4.7) was used to purify crude VHHs.The VHH gene with two disulfide bonds was cloned into pPIC11, which is a derivative of pPIC9 (Invitrogen) with the replication origin of the pUC vector. The constructed vector was digested with AatI (StuI) and transformed into Pichia pastoris GS115. The most efficient transformant was selected on the basis of expression efficiency in small-scale test tube culture. High cell density fermentation of the selected strain was carried out in a 2-liter fermentor (Mitsuwa Scientific Corp., Osaka, Japan) as described previously (19Hagihara Y. Enjyoji K. Omasa T. Katakura Y. Suga K. Igarashi M. Matsuura E. Kato H. Yoshimura T. Goto Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 121: 128-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The culture was continued for 1 day after the induction of protein expression by the addition of methanol. The secreted protein was purified by SP-Sepharose FF (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 10 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.7). The collected fraction was further purified by Superdex 75 (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 10 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.3) and 50 mm NaCl. The purified protein was diluted to a concentration of 0.4 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). To complete the oxidative formation of the disulfide bond, the diluted sample was incubated at 65 °C and purified again by gel permeation chromatography under the same conditions as described above. Correct formation of the disulfide bonds was confirmed by tryptic digestion, followed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry with a Voyager DE STR-D1 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).The formation of disulfide bonds was examined by the method of Ellman (20Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1958; 74: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar) in 4 m guanidine hydrochloride, 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), and 1 mm 5,5′-dithiobis(nitrobenzoic acid) at a protein concentration of ∼20 μm, in which the fully reduced samples were expected to exhibit A412 nm = 0.5–1.0 with a UV-2500PC spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Corp., Kyoto, Japan). Free thiols of VHHs with one disulfide bond were undetectable under the experimental conditions used. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was then used to confirm that the molecular weights of the purified proteins were identical to the expected values calculated from their amino acid sequences (with an error of ±0.025%). The concentration of protein in the stock solution was determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm (21Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2993) Google Scholar).Thermodynamic Analysis of VHH Unfolding—Thermal unfolding was monitored as the change in ellipticity at 235 nm at a protein concentration of 4 μm using a J-720 spectropolarimeter (Jasco, Tokyo, Japan) and a 10-mm cell. The buffers used for the experiments contained 20 mm sodium acetate (pH 4–5), glycine HCl (pH 2–4), or potassium phosphate (pH 7.1). In unfolding experiments using CD, >70% of the CD signals at 235 nm were retained at 10 °C after heat denaturation, except the unfolding of 0-SSVHH at pH 7.1, for which ∼40% of ellipticity at 235 nm was observed. We thus did not use the data of 0-SSVHH at neutral pH to calculate the thermodynamic parameters. DSC measurements of VHHs were made using a VP-DSC MicroCalorimeter (MicroCal, Northampton, MA) in buffer containing 20 mm sodium acetate (pH 4) or glycine HCl (pH 2–4). For both CD and DSC measurements, the heating rate was 1 °C/min. We examined the reversibility of the DSC measurements in each VHH in at least two different pH environments. More than 80% of the heat absorption was observed in the second run after the first heat denaturation. The CD and DSC results were analyzed on the basis of the two-state transition mechanism using IGOR Pro 4 (WaveMetrics, Inc., Lake Oswego, OR).In the analysis of the unfolding transitions detected by CD, the free energy change of unfolding at a given pH at temperature T was as shown in Equation 1, ΔGUpH(T)=(TmpH-T)TmpH-1(ΔHU,45-ΔCp,U(318.15-TmpH))-(TmpH-T)ΔCp,U+TΔCp,Uln(TmpHT-1)(Eq. 1) where TmpH and ΔHU,45 represent the Tm at a given pH and the enthalpy change from the native state to the unfolded state (ΔHU) at 45 °C, respectively. In this analysis, we assumed that the difference in heat capacity between the folded and unfolded states (ΔCp,U) was constant. Because ΔHU,45 and ΔCp,U are independent of pH, multiple CD unfolding curves at different pH values could be analyzed by global fitting using the same ΔHU,45 and ΔCp,U values.For DSC analysis, ΔCp,U was estimated to be the difference between the base-line values for the unfolded (BLU) and native (BLN) states. BLU and BLN are represented by BLU = BLU1T + BLU2 and BLN = BLN1T + BLN2, respectively. Thus, the ΔCp,U at temperature T is given by Equation 2. ΔCp,U(T)=(BLU1-BLN1)T+(BLU2-BLN2)(Eq. 2) Therefore, the ΔHU and entropy changes of unfolding (ΔSU) at temperature T are described by Equations 3 and 4, respectively. ΔHU(T)=ΔHU(Tm)-(0.5(BLU1-BLN1)(Tm2-T2)+(BLU2-BLN2)(Tm-T))(Eq. 3) ΔSU(T)=ΔHU(Tm)Tm-1-((BLU1-BLN1)(Tm-T)+(BLU2-BLN2)ln(TmT-1))(Eq. 4) The molar heat capacity (Cp(T)) is calculated by Equation 5, Cp(T)=ΔHU(T)2fU(1-fU)R-1T-2+(1-fU)(BLN1T-BLN2)+fU(BLU1T-BLU2)(Eq. 5) where fU is the fraction of molecules in the unfolded state calculated from the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation and Equations 3 and 4.Binding Assay of VHH with Antigen hCG—VHH mutants were immobilized on cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose (GE Healthcare) according to the standard protocol supplied by the manufacturer. Aliquots of Sepharose beads (20 μl), on which ∼10 μg of VHHs had been immobilized, were incubated with 10 μg of hCG (Sigma) in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 0.15 m NaCl at room temperature for 90 min. After the beads were washed three times with the same buffer, the samples were boiled for 15 min at 95 °C in standard SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol and then applied to 10–20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The kinetics of binding of VHHs to antigen was examined by SPR spectroscopy. Antigen hCG (0.05 mg/ml) was coupled to a CM5 sensor chip (GE Healthcare) in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 6) by amine coupling according to the manufacturer's instructions. Analysis was performed on a Biacore 2000 instrument (GE Healthcare) in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.005% surfactant P20 at 20 °C. Five serial dilutions (250 to 15 nm) of VHHs were injected into the cuvette, followed by regeneration with 20 mm HCl. As a control, binding of β2-microglubulin (500 to 125 nm) to hCG was also examined.RESULTSIntroduction of an Artificial Disulfide Bond into VHH—We found that llama VHH has a potential candidate for the introduction of the artificial disulfide bond in its hydrophobic amino acid pair: Ala49 and Ile70 (Fig. 1, A and B). Amino acid pairs matching the following criteria were searched for in the three-dimensional structure of VHH (Protein Data Bank code 1HCV) (17Spinelli S. Frenken L. Bourgeois D. de Ron L. Bos W. Verrips T. Anguille C. Cambillau C. Tegoni M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 752-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), for which the antigen is hCG. First, we selected pairs containing combinations of Ala, Val, Ala and Val, and Ala and Ile, which were reported previously to be stable at 30 °C in more than two different immunoglobulin fold domains (12Hagihara Y. Matsuda T. Yumoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24752-24758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We excluded pairs with Gly because it is hard to predict the orientation of the side chain of Cys substituted for Gly. Second, the solvent-exposed surface area of each amino acid needed to be <10 Å2, which corresponds to 5% of the total surface of Ala, because most naturally occurring disulfide bonds are buried (1Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 151: 261-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar, 2Nagano N. Ota M. Nishikawa K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 69-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 3Rose G.D. Geselowitz A.R. Lesser G.J. Lee R.H. Zehfus M.H. Science. 1985; 229: 834-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). The solvent-exposed surface area was calculated by MOLMOL (22Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6468) Google Scholar) considering a solvent radius of 1.4 Å. Usually, the distance between two β-carbons of cystine is ∼3.5–4.5 Å (5Dani V.S. Ramakrishnan C. Varadarajan R. Protein Eng. 2003; 16: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Thus, a third criterion was that the distance between the β-carbons of the pair of amino acids needed to be <4.5 Å.The Ala49/Ile70 pair matched all of the above-mentioned criteria. The accessible surface areas of Ala49 and Ile70 are 3.4 and 7.5 Å2, respectively. These correspond to 1.6% (Ala49) and 2.7% (Ile70) of the total accessible surface areas of these amino acids alone. The distance between the β-carbons of Ala49 and Ile70 is 4.1 Å. We prepared two mutants in which we replaced these two amino acids with Cys (Fig. 1C). One was with a wild-type disulfide bond between Cys22 and Cys96, named 2-SSVHH. The other, 1-SSVHH, was constructed on the non-disulfide-bonded framework, where the wild-type disulfide bond was substituted with the Trp/Ala pair. In addition to these mutants with engineered disulfide bonds, we used wild-type VHH and a non-disulfide-bonded mutant (0-SSVHH) for comparison. Although the Trp/Ala pair was selected only once in a previous study, 0-SSVHH, in which the native disulfide bond was replaced with this pair, showed the highest thermal stability of the mutants that were found in the screening (12Hagihara Y. Matsuda T. Yumoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24752-24758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Thus, we selected a mutant with Trp/Ala as the non-disulfide-bonded framework. It should be noted that the VHH mutants with Ala/Ala and Ala/Val exhibited the second and fourth highest Tm values of the selected mutants, respectively (12Hagihara Y. Matsuda T. Yumoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24752-24758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).The oxidative formation of the disulfide bond in the 1-SSVHH and wild-type domains can be completed by air oxidation in denaturant. However, in 2-SSVHH, the reproducibility of the renaturation of two disulfide bonds was low when we used E. coli as a host organism to express 2-SSVHH (data not shown). Thus, we selected the methylotrophic yeast P. pastoris to produce 2-SSVHH. After the expressed 2-SSVHH mutant was heated to complete the formation of disulfide bonds, the amount of free thiol was <5% of the amount of total thiol. Because the remaining free thiol may influence the thermodynamic parameters for the stability of 2-SSVHH, we simply analyzed 2-SSVHH in terms of Tm and antigen binding affinity, which are not sensitive to minor contamination with free thiols. For comparison among 1-SSVHH, 0-SSVHH, and wild-type domains, we precisely analyzed the thermodynamic effects of the engineered disulfide bond on the stability of VHH.Stability of VHH Mutants with an Artificial Disulfide Bond—The engineered disulfide bond significantly stabilized the VHHs. We measured the thermal unfolding curves of the mutant and wild-type VHHs at pH 7.1 following the change in ellipticity at 235 nm (Fig. 2). The Tm values of the 2-SSVHH, 1-SSVHH, 0-SSVHH, and wild-type domains were 74, 56, 46, and 64 °C, respectively. The most stable mutant, 2-SSVHH, was unfolded at a 10 °C higher Tm compared with the wild-type domain. The difference in Tm between 1-SSVHH and 0-SSVHH was 10 °C and was identical to that between 2-SSVHH and wild-type VHH.FIGURE 2Thermal unfolding curves of VHHs. Wild-type VHH (black), 0-SSVHH (red), 1-SSVHH (blue), and 2-SSVHH (green) were measured by the change in ellipticity at 235 nm using a 10-mm cell. Experiments were carried out at pH 7.1 (20 mm sodium phosphate) using a 10-mm cell. The protein concentration was 4 μm for all proteins. The Tm values of the 2-SSVHH, 1-SSVHH, 0-SSVHH, and wild-type domains were 74, 56, 46, and 64 °C, respectively. deg, degrees.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The thermal unfolding curves of 1-SSVHH, 0-SSVHH, and the wild-type domains at different pH values were measured by CD and DSC to further characterize the effects of the artificial disulfide bond (Fig. 3). The data from CD were analyzed by global fitting. We analyzed individually the heat absorption curves derived from the DSC measurements. Because we could measure the unfolding curves with Tm values of ∼45 °C in all three VHHs, we decided to compare the thermodynamic parameters at 45 °C.FIGURE 3Thermal denaturation of VHHs at different pH values. Shown are the unfolding curves of 1-SSVHH measured by CD at pH 3.9, 3.5, 3.2, 2.9, and 2.6 (A) and by DSC at pH 4.1, 3.6, 3.3, and 3.0 (B). Continuous red lines indicate the curves drawn by the parameters obtained by global (A) and individual (B) fitting methods. deg, degrees.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The ΔHU of 0-SSVHH was significantly higher than that of the 1-SSVHH and wild-type domains (Fig. 4 and Table 1). Thus, the introduction of a disulfide bond, both native and artificial, is enthalpically unfavorable for the stability of VHH. The linear extrapolation of the individual results of the DSC analysis to 45 °C showed that the ΔHU value of 0-SSVHH was 30 and 50 kJ/mol higher than those of the 1-SSVHH and wild-type domains, respectively. The analysis of the CD measurements showed the difference in ΔHU at 45 °C between 0-SSVHH and 1-SSVHH to be ∼50 kJ/mol and that between 0-SSVHH and wild-type VHH to be ∼80 kJ/mol.FIGURE 4Enthalpy of unfolding (ΔHU) of wild-type VHH (black), 0-SSVHH (red), and 1-SSVHH (blue). ΔHU values from individual analysis of DSC curves are indicated by open circles (wild-type VHH), open squares (0-SSVHH), and closed circles (1-SSVHH). Solid and dashed lines were obtained by linear fitting of individual ΔHU values from DSC and by global fitting of CD data, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TABLE 1Thermodynamic parameters of VHHsVHH/methodΔHU at 45 °CaΔHU and ΔCp,U were calculated by global fitting of CD data and linear fitting of ΔHU values obtained from individual DSC data, respectivelyΔCp,UaΔHU and ΔCp,U were calculated by global fitting of CD data and linear fitting of ΔHU values obtained from individual DSC data, respectivelyAverage difference in ΔSU at 45 °CbThe ΔSU values of wild-type and 1-SSVHH were subtracted from the ΔSU values of 0-SSVHH at the same pH values, and these values were averagedkJ/molkJ/molJ/mol0-SSVHH CD360 ± 75.4 ± 0.7 DSC342 ± 54.8 ± 0.4Wild-type VHH CD275 ± 65.3 ± 0.5-328 DSC295 ± 54.8 ± 0.3-2031-SSVHH CD309 ± 35.3 ± 0.7-205 DSC312 ± 55.2 ± 0.4-133a ΔHU and ΔCp,U were calculated by global fitting of CD data and linear fitting of ΔHU values obtained from individual DSC data, respectivelyb The ΔSU values of wild-type and 1-SSVHH were subtracted from the ΔSU values of 0-SSVHH at the same pH values, and these values were averaged Open table in a new tab ΔCp,U was estimated using both CD and DSC data (Table 1). With both techniques, estimated ΔCp,U values were identical within experimental errors, which indicates that the effect of disulfide introduction on ΔCp,U was negligible. ΔCp,U is considered to be related to the difference in the amount of hydration in the folded and unfolded states. Our data suggest that the introduction of a disulfide bond does not alter the extent of hydration upon unfolding. However, the error in estimated ΔCp,U was relatively high (∼10%), and uncertainty exists about the hydration effect based on this parameter.Both native and engineered disulfide bonds decreased ΔSU compared with 0-SSVHH (Table 1). We estimated the average difference in ΔSU at 45 °C between the 0-SSVHH and the domains with one disulfide bond at the same pH values. The ΔSU values of 0-SSVHH were 205 (CD) and 133 (DSC) J/mol larger than those of 1-SSVHH and 328 (CD) and 203 (DSC) J/mol larger than those of the wild-type domain. The effect of disulfide formation on ΔSU (ΔSU,loop) can be calculated using Equation 6, ΔSU,loop=-R(3/2lnN+A)(Eq. 6) where N is the number of residues in the loop-forming disulfide bond. Constant A differs in the literature. Poland and Scheraga (23Poland D.G. Scheraga H.A. Biopolymers. 1965; 3: 379-399Crossref Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and Pace et al. (24Pace C.N. Grimsley G.R. Thomson J.A. Barnett B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11820-11825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) assumed that constant A is 3.47 and 1.06, respectively. The calculated ΔSU,loop values using both values were -67 and -47 J/mol for 1-SSVHH and -83 and -63 J/mol for wild-type VHH. The differences in experimental ΔSU values of 1-SSVHH and wild-type VHH compared with 0-SSVHH deviated significantly from ΔSU,loop.Antigen Binding of VHH Mutants—All prepared VHH mutants bound to the antigen, the α-subunit of hCG. First, we carried out pulldown antigen experiments using immobilized 0-SSVHH, 1-SSVHH, 2-SSVHH, and wild-type domains (Fig. 5). Sepharose-immobilized VHHs were prepared and incubated with hCG at room temperature. After the residual proteins were washed, bound antigen was eluted by SDS. Then, each eluent was subjected to SDS-PAGE. The amounts of hCG bound to the immobilized mutants were similar compared with wild-type VHH. hCG did not interact with Sepharose alone (Fig. 5, lane 3).FIGURE 5Binding of antigen hCG to immobilized VHHs. Wild-type VHH (lane 4), 0-SSVHH (lane 5), 1-SSVHH (lane 7), and 2-SSVHH (lane 8) were immobilized on cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose, and hCG was incubated with VHH-Sepharose at room temperature for 90 min. After washing and elution, bound hCG was applied to 10–20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The antigen binding ability of non-disulfide-bonded VHH, in which the native disulfide bond was replaced with Ala/Ala (A/A*), is also shown for reference (lane 6).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image"
https://openalex.org/W2041406796,"Curcuminoids, major components of the spice turmeric, are used as a traditional Asian medicine and a food additive. Curcumin, a representative curcuminoid, has received a great deal of attention because of its anti-inflammatory, anticarcinogenic, and antitumor activities. Here we report a novel type III polyketide synthase named curcuminoid synthase from Oryza sativa, which synthesizes bisdemethoxycurcumin via a unique mechanism from two 4-coumaroyl-CoAs and one malonyl-CoA. The reaction begins with the thioesterification of the thiol moiety of Cys-174 by a starter molecule, 4-coumaroyl-CoA. Decarboxylative condensation of the first extender substrate, malonyl-CoA, onto the thioester of 4-coumarate results in the formation of a diketide-CoA intermediate. Subsequent hydrolysis of the intermediate yields a β-keto acid, which in turn acts as the second extender substrate. The β-keto acid is then joined to the Cys-174-bound 4-coumarate by decarboxylative condensation to form bisdemethoxycurcumin. This reaction violates the traditional head-to-tail model of polyketide assembly; the growing diketide intermediate is hydrolyzed to a β-keto acid that subsequently serves as the second extender to form curcuminoids. Curcuminoid synthase appears to be capable of the synthesis of not only diarylheptanoids but also gingerol analogues, because it synthesized cinnamoyl(hexanoyl)methane, a putative intermediate of gingerol, from cinnamoyl-CoA and 3-oxo-octanoic acid.

Bisdemethoxycurcumin (1e), dicinnamoylmethane (2e), and curcumin (3e) (Fig. 1A) are curcuminoids found exclusively in the rhizomes of Curcuma longa L. Curcumin (3e) is the principal component of the turmeric rhizome, which is widely used as a food additive and in traditional Asian medicine (1Maheshwari R.K. Singh A.K. Gaddipati J. Srimal R.C. Life Sci. 2006; 78: 2081-2087Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). In addition to its aromatic, stimulant, and coloring properties in the diet, recent studies suggest that curcumin (3e) possesses anti-inflammatory, anticarcinogenic, and antitumor activities when taken orally or topically (1Maheshwari R.K. Singh A.K. Gaddipati J. Srimal R.C. Life Sci. 2006; 78: 2081-2087Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar, 2Sharma R.A. Gescher A.J. Steward W.P. Eur. J.

Cancer Lett. 2005; 223: 181-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Because of these properties, curcuminoid biosynthesis is a subject of great interest. Labeling studies with C. longa showed that curcumin (3e) consists of two phenylpropanoid units connected by an acetate-derived central carbon unit (4Roughley P.J. Whiting D.A. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I. 1973; 1973: 2379-2388Crossref Scopus (230) Google Scholar). It is hypothesized that the curcuminoid scaffold is synthesized via a three-step reaction from phenylpropanoids (4Roughley P.J. Whiting D.A. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I. 1973; 1973: 2379-2388Crossref Scopus (230) Google Scholar). These reactions include (i) condensation of malonyl-CoA with feruloyl-CoA (3a) to produce a diketide-CoA, (ii) hydrolysis of the resulting diketide-CoA to its corresponding β-keto acid, and (iii) decarboxylative condensation of the β-keto acid to a second molecule of feruloyl-CoA (3a) (Fig. 1A). The formation of the β-keto acid is analogous to the reaction catalyzed in Rheum palmatum by benzalacetone synthase (BAS) 2The abbreviations used are: BASbenzalacetone synthasePKSpolyketide synthaseCUScurcuminoid synthaseLCliquid chromatographyHPLChigh-performance liquid chromatographyMSmass spectrometryMS/MStandem mass spectrometryAPCIMSatmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometryNACN-acetylcysteamine (5Abe I. Takahashi Y. Morita H. Noguchi H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3354-3359Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), a type III polyketide synthase (PKS) that catalyzes the synthesis of benzalacetone from 4-coumaroyl-CoA (1a) and malonyl-CoA (Fig. 1B). However, the reaction involving BAS includes decarboxylation of a β-keto acid and the formation of an α-methylketone (5Abe I. Takahashi Y. Morita H. Noguchi H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3354-3359Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), which is not a curcuminoid intermediate. According to the well established head-to-tail model of polyketide assembly by type III PKSs, curcuminoid synthesis may begin with the condensation of an acetate unit to yield a phenylpropanoid unit, as is the case with chalcone synthase (Fig. 1C); however, the incorporation of additional phenylpropanoid units appears to violate this head-to-tail rule. The intriguing structure of curcuminoids raises the question of whether a single type III PKS catalyzes all of the steps in curcuminoid synthesis or only some of them, such as β-keto acid synthesis. Although it has been 10 years since Schröder (6Schröder J. Trends Plant Sci. 1997; 2: 373-378Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) predicted that a type III PKS might be involved in curcuminoid synthesis, no enzymes for the synthesis of the curcuminoid backbone have been identified. Although Ramirez-Ahumada et al. (7Ramirez-Ahumada M.d.C. Timmermann B.N. Gang D.R. Phytochemistry. 2006; 67: 2017-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) achieved curcuminoid synthesis in vitro using crude extracts of turmeric, they did not characterize the enzyme(s) responsible. WtPKS1, a type III PKS from Wachendorfia thyrsiflora known to produce curcuminoid-related compounds called phenylphenalenones, is capable of synthesizing benzalacetones from phenylpropanoid-CoAs and malonyl-CoA (8Brand S. Hölscher D. Schierhorn A. Svatos A. Schröder J. Schneider B. Planta. 2006; 224: 413-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), suggesting that WtPKS1 may be involved in the synthesis of the β-keto acid during curcuminoid formation. However, WtPKS1 does not catalyze curcuminoid formation from a precursor of the β-keto acid and phenylpropanoid-CoA, which excludes the possibility that WtPKS1 alone is capable of synthesizing curcuminoids (8Brand S.

This enzyme can also produce dicinnamoylmethane (2e) and curcumin (3e) from cinnamoyl-CoA (2a) and feruloyl-CoA (3a), respectively; we therefore named it curcuminoid synthase (CUS) (Fig. 1A). Curcuminoids were also synthesized from cinnamoyl-CoA (2a) and 3-oxo-5-phenyl-pent-4-enoic acid (2d) (Fig. 1A), suggesting the involvement of diketide-CoA hydrolysis in the CUS reaction. Therefore, CUS is the first example of a type III PKS that violates the traditional model of head-to-tail polyketide assembly (i.e. a switchover of the role of a diketide intermediate from a growing chain to an extender unit). Escherichia coli JM109, pUC19, restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, and Taq DNA polymerase were purchased from Takara Biochemicals (Shiga, Japan). pET16b (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany) was used for the expression of His-tagged proteins in E. coli BL21 (DE3). Bisdemethoxycurcumin (1e) was obtained from Chromadex (Santa Ana, CA), and trans-cinnamic acid, hexanoic acid, 4-hydroxycinnamic acid, and trans-4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamic acid were purchased from Wako (Tokyo, Japan). N-Acetylcysteamine was supplied by Aldrich, and dodecanoyl-CoA (5a), curcumin (3e), hexanoyl-CoA (4a), malonyl-CoA, methylmalonyl-CoA, octadecanoyl-CoA (6a), and succinyl-CoA were purchased from Sigma. 4-Coumaroyl-CoA (1a), cinnamoyl-CoA (2a), and feruloyl-CoA (3a) were synthesized by the procedure of Blecher (10Blecher M. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 72: 404-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and cinnamoyl-diketide-N-acetylcysteamine (NAC) (2f) and 3-oxo-octanoyl-NAC (4f) were synthesized according to a published report (11Gilbert I.H.

(12Matsumura S. Asai N. Yoneda S. Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 1985; 3: 310-316Google Scholar) and Lokot et al. (13Lokot I.P. Pashkovsky F.S. Lakhvich F.A. Tetrahedron. 1999; 55: 4783-4792Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar), respectively, with modifications. A triketide pyrone (1c) derived from 4-coumaroyl-CoA (1a) was prepared as described previously (14Katsuyama Y. Funa N. Miyahisa I. Horinouchi S. Chem. Biol. 2007; 14: 613-621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). os07g17010 (NCBI accession number AK109558) cDNA was purchased from the Rice Genome Resource Center (Tsukuba, Japan). Using the cDNA as a template, a 1.1-kb DNA fragment containing the os07g17010-coding region was amplified by PCR with the primers 5′-CCGAATTCCATATGGCACCGACGACGACCAT-3′ (an EcoRI site is shown in boldface, an NdeI site is underlined, and the start codon is shown in italics) and 5′-CGCGGATCCTTAATTCACATGAGAGGTGG-3′ (a BamHI site is shown in boldface and the stop codon of os07g17010 is shown in italics). The amplified fragment was cloned between the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pUC19, resulting in pUC19-CUS. The NdeI-BamHI fragment of os07g17010 was excised from pUC19-CUS and cloned between the NdeI and BamHI sites of pET16b, resulting in pET16b-CUS. To produce His-tagged CUS, E. coli BL21 (DE3) harboring pET16b-CUS was grown at 26 °C overnight in Luria broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. The cells were then harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 10% glycerol. After sonication, cellular debris was removed by centrifugation, and the cleared lysate was applied to a column with a His-bind metal chelation resin (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The purified His-tagged protein was dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 10% glycerol. The standard reaction mixture contained 5 μm [2-14C]malonyl-CoA, 5 μm starter substrate, 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), and 6 μg of CUS in a total volume of 100 μl. The reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h before being quenched with 20 μl of 6 m HCl. The products were extracted with ethyl acetate, and the organic layer was evaporated to dryness. The residual material was then dissolved in 20 μl of methanol for thin layer chromatography analysis. Silica gel 60 WF254 thin layer chromatography plates (Merck) were developed in benzene/acetone/acetic acid (85:15:1, v/v/v), and the 14C-labeled compounds were detected using a Fuji BAS-MS imaging plate (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). The standard reaction mixture contained 5 μm extender substrate (malonyl-CoA, methylmalonyl-CoA, or succinyl-CoA), 5 μm starter substrate (4-coumaroyl-CoA (1a), cinnamoyl-CoA (2a), feruloyl-CoA (3a), hexanoyl-CoA (4a), dodecanoyl-CoA (5a), or octadecanoyl-CoA (6a)), 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), and 3.5 μg of CUS in a total volume of 100 μl. The reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h before being quenched with 20 μl of 6 m HCl. The products were extracted with ethyl acetate, and the organic layer was evaporated to dryness. The residual material was then dissolved in 20 μl of methanol for liquid chromatography-atmospheric pressure chemical ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-APCIMS/MS) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. LC-APCIMS/MS analysis was carried out using an Esquire High-Capacity Trap Plus system (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany), and HPLC analysis was carried out using a LaChrom ELITE system (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). The HPLC was equipped with a Pegasil-B C4 reversed-phase HPLC column (4.6 × 250 mm) (Senshu Scientific, Tokyo, Japan) and eluted with a linear acetonitrile gradient (10–100% over 45 min) in water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. UV spectra were detected on a Hitachi L-2450 diode array detector. The reaction mixture contained 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0–9.0), 5 μm 4-coumaroyl-CoA, 5 μm malonyl-CoA, and 16.5 μg of CUS in a total volume of 500 μl. After the reaction mixture had been preincubated at 37 °C for 2 min, the reactions were initiated by adding the substrates (4-coumaroyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA) and continued for 20 min. The reactions were stopped with 100 μl of 6 m HCl, and the material in the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate. The residual material in the organic layer was then dissolved in 20 μl of methanol for HPLC analysis using a Hitachi LaChrom ELITE System. The HPLC was equipped with a Senshu Docosil-B reversed-phase HPLC column (4.6 × 250 mm) and eluted with a linear acetonitrile gradient (10–100% over 25 min) in water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. UV spectra were detected on a Hitachi L-2450 diode array detector. Commercially available bisdemethoxycurcumin (1e) and NMR spectroscopically pure triketide pyrone derived from 4-coumaroyl-CoA (1c) were used to prepare calibration curves. The reaction mixture contained 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), 5 μm 4-coumaroyl-CoA, 5 μm malonyl-CoA, and 16.5 μg of CUS in a total volume of 500 μl. After the reaction mixture had been preincubated at 37 °C for 2 min, the reactions were initiated by adding the substrates (4-coumaroyl-CoA (1a) and malonyl-CoA) and continued for 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, or 60 min. The reactions were stopped with 100 μl of 6 m HCl, and the material in the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate. The residual material in the organic layer was then dissolved in 20 μl of methanol for HPLC analysis using a Hitachi LaChrom ELITE system. The HPLC was carried out as described above. The standard reaction mixture contained 100 μm β-keto acid (2d or 4d) or diketide-NAC (2f or 4f), 100 μm cinnamoyl-CoA (2a) or 100 μm cinnamic acid, 100 μm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), and 3.5 μg of CUS in a total volume of 100 μl. The reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h before being quenched with 20 μl of 6 m HCl. The products were identified by LC-APCIMS/MS and HPLC analysis as described above. The C174S mutant of CUS was constructed using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with the primers 5′-CCACCTCAACGGCTCCTTCGCCGGCTGCG-3′ and 5′-CGCAGCCGGCGAAGGAGCCGTTGAGGTGG-3′ (the Ser codon to be generated is underlined).

Characterization of CUS—To employ a type III PKS as a member of an artificial biosynthesis pathway for fermentative production of plant polyketides by E. coli (14Katsuyama Y. Funa N. Miyahisa I. Horinouchi S. Chem. Biol. 2007; 14: 613-621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), we have screened genomes of various organisms for type III PKSs that catalyze formation of novel skeletons. We conducted a BLAST search using the O. sativa genome and found more than 30 proteins that were annotated as type III PKSs (data not shown). For preliminary characterization of the annotated proteins, we expressed them in E. coli, purified them, and incubated them with various CoA compounds including malonyl-CoA and 4-coumaroyl-CoA (1a) to determine products by spectrometric analysis. Of these putative type III PKSs, we found that the protein encoded by os07g17010 catalyzed curcuminoid formation from 4-coumaroyl-CoA (1a) and malonyl-CoA (see below). CUS shared 49% amino acid identity with chalcone synthase from Medicago sativa (15Ferrer J.-L. Jez J.M. Bowman M.E. Dixon R.A. Noel J.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 775-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar), 51% identity with BAS from R. palmatum (5Abe I. Takahashi Y. Morita H. Noguchi H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3354-3359Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and 46% identity with WtPKS1 from W. thyrsiflora (8Brand S. Hölscher D. Schierhorn A. Svatos A. Schröder J. Schneider B. Planta. 2006; 224: 413-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. 1). In addition, CUS had a conserved catalytic triad, composed of Cys-174, His-316, and Asn-349 (CUS numbering), which is crucial for the decarboxylative condensation activity of all type III PKSs (supplemental Fig. 1) (16Austin M.B. Noel J.P. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2003; 20: 79-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). The CUS cDNA was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3), and CUS was purified as a single protein band with a molecular mass of 43 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (data not shown). We tested the ability of CUS to synthesize bisdemethoxycurcumin (1e) from 4-coumaroyl-CoA (1a) and malonyl-CoA because they are the typical substrates for plant type III PKSs. The reaction was performed with each 5 μm substrate at pH 7.5, which is similar to the cytosolic pH of O. sativa (17Kuchitsu K. Yazaki Y. Sakano K. Shibuya N. Plant Cell Physiol. 1997; 38: 1012-1018Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Incubation of 4-coumaroyl-CoA (1a) with [2-14C]malonyl-CoA yielded two radiolabeled products, as determined by thin layer chromatography (Fig. 2, lane 1). The major product was identified as bisdemethoxycurcumin (1e) by comparing its retention time, MS and MS/MS spectra, and UV maximum with those of an authentic sample via LC-APCIMS analysis (supplemental Fig. 2). Similarly, the minor product was identified as a triketide pyrone (1c) (supplemental Fig. 2) formed from one 4-coumaroyl-CoA and two malonyl-CoAs. However, neither 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-oxo-pent-4-enoic acid (1d), a possible intermediate, nor 4-hydroxybenzalacetone, a possible by-product, was detected. These findings indicate that CUS is distinct from BAS, which produces 4-hydroxybenzalacetone via decarboxylation of 1d (5Abe I. Takahashi Y. Morita H. Noguchi H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3354-3359Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Analysis of Cinnamoyl- and Feruloyl-CoA-primed Reactions—We examined whether CUS accepts other phenylpropanoids, such as cinnamoyl-CoA (2a) and feruloyl-CoA (3a), as starter substrates. The reactions, which were performed under conditions as described above, showed that cinnamoyl-CoA (2a) reacted to form a triketide pyrone (2c) with a small amount of dicinnamoylmethane (2e) (Fig. 2, lane 2, and supplemental Fig. 2), whereas feruloyl-CoA (3a) yielded no products (Fig. 2, lane 3). The expected products, the triketide pyrone (3c) and curcumin (3e), were detectable only by LC-MS analysis when the reaction volume was scaled up by 5-fold (supplemental Fig. 2). A competition experiment between 4-coumaroyl-CoA and cinnamoyl-CoA yielded both 1e and 2c (Fig. 2, lane 7). Judging from almost the same radioactivity incorporated into 1e and 2c, we supposed that CUS preferred 4-coumaroyl-CoA 2-fold to cinnamoyl-CoA; 2c incorporates two [2-14C]malonyl-CoA molecules and 1e incorporates one molecule. Interestingly, in addition to these products, a very small amount of an asymmetric curcuminoid, cinnamoyl-4-coumaroylmethane, derived from 4-coumaroyl-CoA and cinnamoyl-CoA, was detected by LC-MS analysis (supplemental Fig. 3). A similar competition experiment between 4-coumaroyl-CoA and feruloyl-CoA yielded 1e, indicating that feruloyl-CoA is a poor substrate for CUS (Fig. 2, lane 8). A negligible amount of an asymmetric curcuminoid, 4-coumaroylferuroylmethane, was also detected by LC-MS analysis (supplemental Fig. 3). These results suggested that CUS prefers 4-coumaroyl-CoA (1a) among the typical CoA esters derived from the phenylpropanoid pathway. Enzymatic Properties of CUS—We determined the temperature and pH dependence of CUS for bisdemethoxycurcumin (1e) synthesis. CUS showed a temperature optimum at 45 °C (Fig. 3A). The velocity of 1e formation was maximal around pH 7.0, whereas that for 1c was maximal around pH 6.5 (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, the ratio of 1c/1e differed depending on the pH; an acidic pH increased the rate of pyrone production, whereas an alkaline pH decreased it. The pH dependence of CUS resembles that of BAS; BAS preferentially produces a triketide pyrone under acidic conditions and benzalacetone under alkaline conditions (18Abe I. Sano Y. Takahashi Y. Noguchi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25218-25226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The production ratio of 1c/1e by CUS was also affected by the concentrations of the substrates. When 50 μm 4-coumaroyl-CoA (1a) and 5 μm malonyl-CoA were incubated with CUS, only 1e was detected by HPLC analysis (data not shown). Conversely, 5 μm 4-coumaroyl-CoA (1a) and 50 μm malonyl-CoA yielded only 1c (data not shown). We next examined the courses of production of bisdemethoxycurcumin (1e) and the triketide pyrone (1c) (Fig. 3C). During the CUS reaction starting with 4-coumaroyl-CoA (1a) and malonyl-CoA (at 5 μm each), the velocity of bisdemethoxycurcumin (1e) synthesis changed and did not become constant; CUS produced bisdemethoxycurcumin (1e) slowly during the early stage of the reaction, for about 10 to 20 min after the reaction initiation, and the production rate became gradually higher thereafter until 40 min. Instead, the velocity of triketide pyrone (1c) synthesis became constant at the early stage of the reaction and the production of triketide pyrone (1c) was saturated at 20 min after the reaction initiation. Therefore, the 1c/1e ratio changed depending on the period of the reaction; initially, the triketide pyrone (1c) was the major product and after 30 min of incubation bisdemethoxycurcumin (1e) became the major product. The change in the production rate of bisdemethoxycurcumin (1e) during the reaction hampered us in determining the kinetic parameters of CUS. This finding suggested that diketide-CoA (1b) accumulation is important for bisdemethoxycurcumin (1e) synthesis, as discussed later. We also found that the C174S mutant of CUS possessed no PKS activity (data not shown), suggesting that Cys-174 functions as a catalytic center to anchor acyl intermediates, as is the case for other type III PKSs (16Austin M.B. Noel J.P. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2003; 20: 79-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Mechanism of the CUS Reaction—According to previous tracer studies (4Roughley P.J. Whiting D.A. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I. 1973; 1973: 2379-2388Crossref Scopus (230) Google Scholar), CUS would catalyze the condensation of malonyl-CoA with 4-coumaroyl-CoA (1a) to produce a diketide-CoA (1b)(step i in Fig. 1A), hydrolysis of 1b to 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-oxo-pent-4-enoic acid (1d) (Fig. 1A, step ii), and the decarboxylative condensation of 1d with a second molecule of 4-coumaroyl-CoA (1a) (Fig. 1A, step iii). Consequently, CUS should use two starter substrates; the first condenses with malonyl-CoA to form 1d, whereas the second one condenses with 1d. Similarly, CUS should use two extender substrates; the first, malonyl-CoA, is used to produce 1d, whereas the second is 1d itself (Fig. 1A). To confirm this hypothesis and to obtain additional insight into the CUS reaction, we prepared two intermediates: cinnamoyl diketide-NAC (N-acetylcysteamine, an analogue for CoA) (2f) and 3-oxo-5-phenyl-pent-4-enoic acid (2d) (Fig. 4). We chose cinnamate-derived intermediates because they could be prepared more easily than those derived from 4-coumarate. As expected, CUS produced dicinnamoylmethane (2e) from cinnamoyl-CoA (2a) and cinnamoyl diketide-NAC (2f) (Fig. 4A and supplemental Fig. 4). In addition, CUS efficiently produced dicinnamoylmethane (2e) from 2d and cinnamoyl-CoA (2a) (Fig. 4B and supplemental Fig. 4). In addition, the reaction containing 2d produced more dicinnamoylmethane (2e) than that containing 2f. These results demonstrate that diketide intermediates are accepted as the second extender substrates, which suggests the involvement of enzymatic hydrolysis of a diketide intermediate in the CUS reaction. In contrast, incubation of cinnamic acid with 2d or 2f yielded no products (Fig. 4, C and D). This result excludes the unlikely possibility that cinnamic acid serves as an extender substrate for the diketide intermediate. In addition, thioester formation by the second starter substrate with Cys-174 was found to be essential for elongation of the second extender substrate because use of the C174S mutant in these reactions yielded no products (Fig. 4, A and B). Substrate Specificity of CUS—As described above, 4-coumaroyl-CoA (1a), cinnamoyl-CoA (2a), and feruloyl-CoA (3a) serve as the first and second starter substrates in curcuminoid production. We next determined whether CUS accepts CoA esters of n-fatty acids as a starter substrate. Incubation of hexanoyl-CoA (4a) and malonyl-CoA yielded only a triketide pyrone (4c) (Fig. 2, lane 4, and supplemental Fig. 2). Dodecanoyl-CoA (5a) also yielded a triketide pyrone (5c) (Fig. 2, lane 5, and supplemental Fig. 2). No curcuminoid-like products derived from hexanoyl-CoA (4a) or dodecanoyl-CoA (5a) were detected even when an excess amount of these starter substrates was added. Therefore, neither hexanoyl-CoA (4a) nor dodecanoyl-CoA (5a) acts as second starter substrate, although they were incorporated as the first starter substrate to produce a diketide-CoA. Incubation of octadecanoyl-CoA (6a) with malonyl-CoA yielded no products (Fig. 2, lane 6). In addition, competition experiments with 4-coumaroyl-CoA (1a) suggested that CUS preferred 4-coumaroyl-CoA (1a) over hexanoyl-CoA (4a) and dodecanoyl-CoA (5a) as its first and second starter substrates (Fig. 2, lanes 9 and 10). Incubation of 4-coumaroyl-CoA (1a) with methylmalonyl-CoA or succinyl-CoA, instead of malonyl-CoA, in the presence of CUS yielded no products (data not shown). Production of Cinnamoyl(hexanoyl)methane by CUS—Cinnamoyl(hexanoyl)methane (4e) (Fig. 5), an analogue of gingerol found in ginger (Zingiber officinale) (19Denniff P. Macleod I. Whiting D.A. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I. 1980; 1980: 2637-2644Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar), is composed of hexanoyl- and cinnamoyl-CoA-derived moieties and a single acetate. The structural similarity between 4e and the asymmetric curcuminoids described above prompted us to examine the ability of CUS to synthesize 4e. We first incubated hexanoyl-CoA (4a) and malonyl-CoA along with cinnamoyl-CoA (2a), but the reaction produced dicinnamoylmethane (2e) along with a triketide pyrone derived from cinnamoyl-CoA (2c) (data not shown). As described above, incubation of hexanoyl-CoA (4a) with malonyl-CoA yielded no symmetric curcuminoid-like compounds, although it yielded a triketide pyrone (4c) (Fig. 2, lane 4). These observations suggested that CUS relatively preferred cinnamoyl-CoA (2a) to hexanoyl-CoA (4a) as the first and second starter substrates. Cinnamoyl(hexanoyl)methane (4e) synthesis was achieved by incubation of cinnamoyl-CoA (2a) with either 3-oxo-octanoyl-NAC (4f) or 3-oxo-octanoic acid (4d) (Fig. 5 and supplemental Fig. 4), suggesting a relaxed specificity for the second extender substrate. Having a β-keto acid moiety in the second extender substrate may be sufficient to be recognized as a substrate by CUS. In contrast, hexanoyl-CoA (4a), when incubated with 4d or 2d, did not yield any products (data not shown), suggesting a strict preference for the second starter substrate. Thus, other enzyme system(s) may be involved in preparing 3-oxo-octanoic acid (4d) or its acyl carrier protein/CoA esters in gingerol-producing Z. officinale. The field of plant natural products has dramatically changed in recent years because of the advent of genomic sequencing. Instead of classical homology-based reverse transcription-PCR strategies using RNA pools, a BLAST search of a single data base allows one to identify a target gene. This strategy, sometimes called genome mining (20Ricke D.O. Wang S. Cai R. Cohen D. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2006; 10: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), can uncover cryptic or untranslated genes that are missed by classical RNA-based methodologies. Using genome mining instead of a classical reverse genetic approach, we identified a novel type III PKS that catalyzes the synthesis of curcuminoids, polyphenols specific to Zingiberaceae. The in vivo function of CUS in rice is still unclear. However, we believe that the curcuminoids are biosynthesized in Zingiberaceae in a manner similar to the unique mechanism shown by CUS. Turmeric gradually accumulates curcuminoids throughout the growing season (8Brand S. Hölscher D. Schierhorn A. Svatos A. Schröder J. Schneider B. Planta. 2006; 224: 413-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), probably because of low activity and low-level expression of the curcuminoid biosynthetic enzyme. These features may have prevented researchers from identifying the enzyme(s) in the past. On the basis of our in vitro results, we propose the following mechanism for the CUS reaction. To begin, the thiol residue of Cys-174 is joined with a starter molecule, 4-coumaroyl-CoA (1a), by thioesterification. Subsequent decarboxylative condensation of the first extender substrate, malonyl-CoA, with 4-coumarate results in the formation of a diketide-CoA (1b). The thioesterase activity of CUS then hydrolyzes the thioester bond of 1b to yield 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-oxo-pent-4-enoic acid (1d), which in turn acts as the second extender substrate. Finally, the resulting intermediate 1d serves as the second extender substrate and is condensed with the second starter substrate (i.e. 4-coumaroyl-CoA bound to Cys-174) to produce bisdemethoxycurcumin (1e) (Fig. 1A). When another molecule of malonyl-CoA is added to the diketide intermediate in place of curcuminoid synthesis, CUS produces a triketide pyrone (1c) as a by-product. Type III PKSs catalyze the sequential condensation of extender substrates onto a starter substrate in a head-to-tail fashion. CUS follows this head-to-tail rule to produce a diketide-CoA, which in turn is hydrolyzed to a β-keto acid as described above. However, CUS catalyzes the decarboxylative Claisen condensation of the resultant β-keto acid with the second starter substrate. Intramolecular condensation of a CoA-free intermediate is not uncommon in type III PKS reactions. For example, stilbene synthase cyclizes a tetraketide intermediate via an intramolecular aldol reaction (21Austin M.B. Bowman M.E. Ferrer J.-L. Schröder J. Noel J.P. Chem. Biol. 2004; 11: 1179-1194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). A unique feature of CUS is that the decarboxylative Claisen condensation of the β-keto acid occurs intermolecularly. It is interesting that CUS accepts two structurally distinct extender substrates, a β-keto acid and malonyl-CoA. Interestingly, 1d is a common intermediate in both the CUS and BAS reactions. BAS synthesizes 4-hydroxybenzalacetone via decarboxylation of 1d from 4-coumaroyl-CoA (1a) and malonyl-CoA (Fig. 1B) (5Abe I. Takahashi Y. Morita H. Noguchi H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3354-3359Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The difference between CUS and BAS is that the former decarboxylatively condenses a β-keto acid with a second starter substrate to yield a curcuminoid, whereas the latter simply decarboxylizes it to yield benzalacetone. On the basis of this proposed reaction mechanism, the CUS reaction should include a thioesterase activity to produce β-keto acids. Nevertheless, we could not detect β-keto acids (i.e. benzalacetone analogues) even when CUS was incubated with the diketide-NAC (2f) (data not shown). These observations raise a question as to how the cryptic thioesterase activity of CUS is controlled. It may be that the thioesterase activity of CUS toward its diketide intermediate emerges only in the presence of the second starter substrate. Furthermore, the hydrolysis of the diketide intermediate to yield the β-keto acid (1d) and condensation to yield bisdemethoxycurcumin (1e) may occur in concert without releasing the β-keto acid. Although the expected intermediates (i.e. the diketide intermediate and 1d) were not detected experimentally, we assumed that the diketide-CoA (1b) is once released from a CUS molecule and bound by another molecule of CUS, in which Cys-174 anchors a 4-coumarate moiety. Then, hydrolysis of the diketide-CoA and decarboxylative condensation of the β-keto acid produced results in the formation of bisdemethoxycurcumin (1e). This hypothesis could explain the course of production of bisdemethoxycurcumin (1e) and the triketide pyrone (1c), shown in Fig. 3B. According to this hypothesis, the velocity of bisdemethoxycurcumin (1e) production depends on the concentration of the diketide-CoA (1b). The early stage of the reaction is for accumulation of the diketide-CoA (1b). As the diketide-CoA accumulates in the solution, the velocity of bisdemethoxycurcumin (1e) synthesis becomes larger. On the other hand, the velocity of triketide pyrone synthesis was constant during the early stage of the reaction, which suggests that the triketide pyrone synthesis does not involve diketide-CoA release. Recently, Austin et al. (21Austin M.B. Bowman M.E. Ferrer J.-L. Schröder J. Noel J.P. Chem. Biol. 2004; 11: 1179-1194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) reported a novel mechanism leading to the hydrolysis of a thioester, which in turn results in an aldol-type folded ring, on the basis of the crystal structure of stilbene synthase, a type III PKS responsible for stilbene synthesis. The thioesterase activity of stilbene synthase is also cryptic, and the hydrolyzed tetraketide intermediate is cyclized into stilbene without releasing the derailment product from the enzyme (21Austin M.B. Bowman M.E. Ferrer J.-L. Schröder J. Noel J.P. Chem. Biol. 2004; 11: 1179-1194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Curcuminoids and phenylphenalenones are characteristic compounds in Hemodorales (22Hölscher D. Schneider B. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1995; 1995: 525-526Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 23Hölscher D. Schneider B. Nat. Prod. Lett. 1995; 7: 177-182Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and Zingiberales (24Hirai N. Ishida H. Koshimizu K. Phytochemistry. 1994; 37: 383-385Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The Zingiberales, which include turmeric, ginger, and banana, are closely related to Hemodorales (25Kress W.J. Prince L.M. Hahn W.J. Zimmer E.A. Syst. Biol. 2001; 50: 926-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). CUS is derived from rice O. sativa, which is phylogenetically distinct from Hemodorales and Zingiberales. To date, curcuminoids and phenylphenalenones have not been reported in O. sativa. CUS synthesizes curcuminoids in vitro under near-physiological conditions from 4-coumaroyl-CoA (1a) and malonyl-CoA, both of which are common in plants and the typical substrates for plant type III PKSs. Speculatively, the rice CUS produces curcuminoids but in undetectable amounts. Additional studies are apparently necessary to determine the exact in vivo function of CUS. It is notable that os07g17010 was identified from a panicle cDNA library constructed two weeks after flowering. An interesting question is whether CUS is found in Hemodorales and Zingiberales. Homology-based cloning using the CUS sequence against the genome or a cDNA library of curcuminoid producers will answer this question. Download .pdf (.92 MB) Help with pdf files"

The New Horizons spacecraft traversed the magnetotail to distances exceeding 2500 jovian radii ( R J ) and revealed a remarkable diversity of plasma populations and structures throughout its length. Ions evolve from a hot plasma disk distribution at ∼100 R J to slower, persistent flows down the tail that become increasingly variable in flux and mean energy. The plasma is highly structured—exhibiting sharp breaks, smooth variations, and apparent plasmoids—and contains ions from both Io and Jupiter's ionosphere with intense bursts of H + and H + 3 . Quasi-periodic changes were seen in flux at ∼450 and ∼1500 R J with a 10-hour period. Other variations in flow speed at ∼600 to 1000 R J with a 3- to 4-day period may be attributable to plasmoids moving down the tail."

It is localized exclusively in the nucleus and deconjugates many SUMO substrates (9Gong L. Millas S. Maul G.G. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol.

SENP1 shares the greatest homology with SENP2 (9Gong L. Millas S. Maul G.G. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol.

In contrast, SENP1 differs significantly from SENP3 and SENP5, which constitute an independent subfamily based on their nucleolar localization and preference for de-SUMOylation of SUMO2 and SUMO3 conjugates (14Gong L.

Wang D. Wang Z. Yeh E.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6021-6028Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Under physiological conditions, the AR dictates the development and normal growth of the prostate gland. The androgen 5α-dihydrotestosterone binds AR to prompt translocation of this active receptor from the cytosol to the nucleus. The androgen-activated ARs bind specific DNA sequences or androgen response element (ARE) located on the promoter region of a gene. The AR then prompts the recruitment of various co-regulatory proteins to directly modulate the transcription of these genes. Changes in the transcriptional activation of the AR promote prostate cancer (PCa) cell proliferation and survival (15Scherr D. Swindle P.W. Scardino P.T. Urology. 2003; 61: 14-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 16Richter E. Srivastava S. Dobi A.

Anticancer Ther. 2005; 5: 63-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We observed that AR activity is modulated by SENP1 in PCa cells; overexpressing SENP1 increases AR-transcriptional activity via de-SUMOylation of the co-regulatory protein, HDAC1 (10Cheng J. Wang D. Wang Z. Yeh E.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6021-6028Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Reduction of endogenous SENP1 in these cells, using interfering RNA directed specifically against SENP1, significantly decreases expression of the AR-regulated-prostate-specific antigen gene (10Cheng J. Wang D. Wang Z. Yeh E.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6021-6028Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Similarly, SENP1 moderates the expression of the cell cycle regulator, cyclin D1; diminishing SENP1 in PCa cells decreases cyclin D1 levels (18Cheng J. Bawa T. Lee P. Gong L. Yeh E.T. Neoplasia. 2006; 8: 667-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Previous studies indicate that enhanced expression of cyclin D1 is readily observed in advanced PCa (19Drobnjak M. Osman I. Scher H.I. Fazzari M. Cordon-Cardo C. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 1891-1895PubMed Google Scholar, 20Comstock C.E. Revelo M.P. Buncher C.R. Knudsen K.E. Br. J. Cancer. 2007; 96: 970-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and contributes to PCa progression (21Chen Y. Martinez L.A. LaCava M. Coghlan L. Conti C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1913-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 22He Y. Franco O.E. Jiang M. Williams K. Love H.D. Coleman I.M. Nelson P.S. Hayward S.W. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 8188-8197Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Therefore, the expression of SENP1 in PCa cells modulates major factors in PCa progression. We recently reported that SENP1 expression appears enhanced in prostate carcinoma and precursor prostatic intra-epithelial neoplasia lesions relative to adjacent normal prostate tissue via in situ hybridization (18Cheng J. Bawa T. Lee P. Gong L. Yeh E.T. Neoplasia. 2006; 8: 667-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The present study demonstrates that elevation in SENP1 mRNA levels in PCa cells is selective and requires the activation of the AR. Upon activation, AR binds a specific ARE on the SENP1 promoter and enhances SENP1 transcription. Hence, this study is the first to delineate a mechanism for the regulation of expression of a SUMO protease. Cell Culture Maintenance and Treatment—LNCaP and PC-3 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin, whereas RWPE1 and RWPE2 cells were maintained in keratinocyte serum-free medium supplemented with 5 ng/ml human recombinant epidermal growth factor and 0.05 mg/ml bovine pituitary extract. For hormone treatment, the maintenance medium was replaced with phenol red-free RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% charcoal-stripped bovine serum. RNA Interference and Cell Proliferation—SENP1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) and nonspecific siRNA (NS-siRNA) were purchased from Dharmacon (Chicago, IL), and LNCaP cells were transfected with either of the two siRNAs using the DharmaFECT transfection reagent (Dharmacon). The LNCaP cells were allowed to grow for 48 h after initial transfection. Then, the cells were replated, and after 4 h, a subset of cells was treated with 10 nm R1881. Five days later, the LNCaP cells were harvested to determine cell growth and SENP1 levels. To assess changes in cell number, LNCaP cells were stained with trypan blue and counted using a hemocytometer. QRT-PCR and real-time PCR were conducted to evaluate endogenous SENP1 mRNA levels following the indicated siRNA treatment. RNA Isolation, Real-time PCR, and QRT-PCR—Cells were prepared for RNA isolation using the RNA-Bee reagent (Tel-Test Inc., Friendswood, TX) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The TaqMan Master Mix reagents (Applied Biosystems, Branchburg, NJ) were utilized for the real-time PCR. Primers for either SENP1 (400 nm; forward, 5′-TTG GCC AGA GTG CAA ATG G-3′; and reverse, 5′-TCG GCT GTT TCT TGA TTT TTG TAA-3′) or the 18 S rRNA (40 nm; forward, 5′-TAA CGA ACG AGA CTC TGG CAT-3′; and reverse, 5′-CGG ACA TCT AAG GGC ATC ACA G-3′) were utilized. SENP1 RNA levels or relative quantity values (RQ values) were calculated using the TaqMan ABI PRISM 7900 sequence detector system (Applied Biosystems). Alternatively, QRT-PCR was conducted with the One Step RT-PCR kit from Qiagen (Valencia, CA) to illustrate changes in SENP1 levels with respect to the housekeeping gene actin or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The following primers (40 nm) were used for amplification of SENP1, actin, or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA: SENP1, 5′-ATA GGA TCC ATG CAG GCA GTG AAA CGT TGG A-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCG CGT CGA CTC ACA AGA GTT TTC GGT GGA G-3′ (reverse); actin, 5′-TCT TGG GTA TGG AAT CCT GTG GCA-3′ (forward) and 5′-ACT CCT GCT TGC TGA TCC ACA TCT-3′ (reverse); and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5′-GGT CTC CTC TGA CTT CAA CAG CG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGT ACT TTA TTG ATG GTA CAT GAC-3′ (reverse). Identification of the SENP1 Promoter Region—The human SENP1 gene, located on chromosome 12, contains a large 5′-untranslated region with the translation start site on exon 2. A series of computational analyses were conducted to identify a candidate SENP1 promoter region. First, to establish the transcriptional start site, the expressed sequence tag data base was searched to find a sequence that extends farther upstream than the first nucleotide of the SENP1 gene (GenBank™ accession number NM_014554); none were found. Therefore, the first base pair of the untranslated region was taken as the putative transcriptional start site. Then, SENP1 was blasted against the completed human genome available on the National Center for Biotechnology Information data base to acquire the sequence upstream of this putative transcriptional start site. Next, the National Institutes of Health-developed Proscan Version 1.7 Bioinformatics Program was used to detect a core promoter region within a 3-kb upstream sequence; the program recognizes transcriptional elements required for binding of RNA polymerase II (23Prestridge D.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 923-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). A 250-bp region located 25 bp upstream of the putative transcriptional start site was identified as the core promoter with a score of 64.23. This program and the TRANSFAC data base confirmed the absence of a TATA box and the presence of multiple Sp1-binding sites within this core promoter region. It is well established that Sp1 binds to GC-rich regions to recruit RNA polymerase II and thereby induce gene transcription (24Li L. He S. Sun J.M. Davie J.R. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 82: 460-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The putative SENP1 promoter included a GC-rich region or CpG island as verified by the European Bioinformatics Institute-supported CpGPlot/CpGReport tool. When aligned with an analogous 3-kb 5′ region of the mouse SENP1/SuPr-2 gene (GenBank™ accession number NM_144851) using bl2seq, the putative human SENP1 promoter contained two highly conserved regions. Yamaguchi et al. (25Yamaguchi T. Sharma P. Athanasiou M. Kumar A. Yamada S. Kuehn M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 5171-5182Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) identified the first region, which was located within intron 1 and shared 80% homology between the two species. The mouse ortholog included an enhancer domain within this region; disruption of this area with proviral integration reduced the expression of the SENP1/SuPr-2 gene. The second homologous domain was located in the 5′ region in both species and included 474 nucleotides that share 75% identity. Identification of Potential AREs—Potential AREs were identified on the 4.1-kb sequence based on 1) alignment with the accepted palindromic ARE sequence 5′-AGAACA nnn TGTTCT-3′ and 2) conservation of the 2 G and 2 C nucleotides within the ARE that are essential for AR binding (26Luisi B.F.

Chem. 2001; 276: 2943-2952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Based on these two criteria, six potential AREs were recognized; three AREs were located proximal to the CpG island, whereas the other three AREs were at least 1 kb away. One potential ARE was identified in intron 1 within close proximity to the enhancer region identified by Yamaguchi et al. (25Yamaguchi T. Sharma P. Athanasiou M. Kumar A. Yamada S. Kuehn M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 5171-5182Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Because the ARE can be located in enhancer regions downstream of the promoter, this downstream ARE was also assessed for regulation of SENP1 promoter activity. According to the location of these putative AREs, we designed additional fragments that excluded one or more of these AREs. Promoter-Luciferase Construct—The potential SENP1 promoter described above was amplified from the genomic DNA of LNCaP cells using specific primers (supplemental Table S1). The primers for the initial SENP1 promoter plasmid (SP1P) and the five deletion constructs (supplemental Table S1) included a cleavage recognition site for either NheI on the forward primers or XhoI on the reverse primers to facilitate subcloning into the multiple cloning regions of the pGL3-basic vector. The plasmids, which fused the respective promoter regions with a firefly luciferase reporter gene, were co-transfected with the control Renilla luciferase plasmid. Following appropriate treatment, LNCaP and/or PC-3 cells were lysed using the cell lysis buffer provided with the Dual-Luciferase Reporter 1000 assay system (Promega), and relative luciferase activity was assessed with a luminometer; the relative luciferase activity is used to represent the ratio of the firefly luciferase count to the Renilla luciferase count. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—PC-3 cells were treated as indicated, and following treatment, the protein-DNA complexes were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min. The cells were lysed, and subsequently the cell lysate was sonicated to shear the DNA. Then, 600 μg of DNA from each treatment group was collected. To reduce nonspecific background, the cell lysate was first incubated with agarose beads and salmon sperm DNA. The supernatant was collected, and 20 μl of it was saved to analyze as the initial input for the reaction. The remaining lysate was incubated overnight with 2 μgofthe anti-AR antibody. The protocol provided with the ChIP kit (Upstate Biotechnology) was followed for immunoprecipitation, elution, and reverse cross-linking of the protein-DNA complex. The eluted DNA was purified with the PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Both the eluted and input products were then subjected to PCR analysis using the indicated primers (supplemental Table S1). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Specific oligonucleotides labeled with biotin on the 5′ end (supplemental Table S2) were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies. A non-radioactive LightShift chemiluminescent EMSA kit (Pierce) was used to detect interaction between the respective oligonucleotides and the 107-amino acid DNA-binding domain of the AR (AR-DBD); it was previously illustrated that the AR-DBD can successful bind AREs in the absence of AR (29Liu G.Z. Wang H. Wang Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14956-14960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, each oligonucleotide (20 fmol) was incubated with the AR-DBD (50 ng) and 50 ng/μl of the nonspecific competitor DNA, poly(dI·dC), for 20 min in binding buffer (Pierce), 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm KCl, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. The reaction was terminated with the addition of the loading buffer, and subsequently each sample was loaded onto a pre-run polyacrylamide gel. The samples were then transferred to a nylon membrane, and the biotin-labeled oligonucleotides were detected via chemiluminescence. When present, the relative density of the slower migrating band (representative of AR-DBD-bound oligonucleotide) was evaluated using the FluorChem-8900 (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA). Data Analysis—Nonlinear regression analysis was conducted with GraphPad Prism Version 4.0 (GraphPad Software). Either Student's t test or ANOVA (concurrently with Tukey's post hoc test) was employed to calculate p values and evaluate differences between groups. Induction of SENP1 by Androgen in Prostate Cancer Cells Modulates Cell Proliferation—In situ hybridization studies illustrated more intense staining for SENP1 mRNA in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and PCa cells as compared with normal adjacent prostate epithelia (18Cheng J. Bawa T. Lee P. Gong L. Yeh E.T. Neoplasia. 2006; 8: 667-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The consequence of SENP1 overexpression in PCa cells remained undefined. Overexpression of SENP1 in PCa cells enhanced AR-dependent transcription (10Cheng J. Wang D. Wang Z. Yeh E.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6021-6028Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 18Cheng J. Bawa T. Lee P. Gong L. Yeh E.T. Neoplasia. 2006; 8: 667-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Activated AR induces the transcription of numerous genes that are required to modulate cell proliferation (30Stacey D.W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 158-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 31Wang C. Li Z. Fu M. Bouras T. Pestell R.G. Cancer Treat. Res. 2004; 119: 217-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 32Fu M. Wang C. Li Z. Sakamaki T. Pestell R.G. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 5439-5447Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar, 33Stanbrough M. Leav I. Kwan P.W. Bubley G.J. Balk S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10823-10828Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 34Burnstein K.L. J. Cell. Biochem. 2005; 95: 657-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar); therefore, we postulated that androgen-activated AR could enhance SENP1 levels to regulate PCa cell growth. LNCaP cells were transfected with SENP1-targeting or non-targeting siRNA, and after 2 days they were treated with 10 nm R1881 for an additional 5 days. Transfection of the SENP1-siRNA successfully ablated endogenous SENP1 mRNA (Fig. 1A, second lane) as compared with the NS-siRNA (first lane). This ablation was confirmed by realtime PCR (data not shown). The androgen treatment significantly elevated SENP1 mRNA (Fig. 1A, third and fourth lanes); however, SENP1 message was greater in cells transfected with NS-siRNA (third lane) than SENP1-siRNA (fourth lane). Consequently, the lower SENP1 mRNA following SENP1-siRNA treatment prompted a significant decrease in the ability of R1881 to enhance LNCaP cell proliferation (Fig. 1B) as compared with treatment with the NS-siRNA (*, p < 0.05). In the absence of R1881, 7-day SENP-siRNA treatment has little effect on cell growth (data not shown). Therefore, androgen-induced SENP1 mRNA contributed to AR-mediated PCa cell proliferation. Elevation of SENP1 Levels in PCa Cells Requires Activation of AR—The expression of SENP1 mRNA was analyzed by both real-time PCR and QRT-PCR in the normal prostate epithelial cell line RWPE1, the transformed cell line RWPE2, and the PCa cell line LNCaP. RWPE2 cells, which are derived from RWPE1 cells, expressed a 2-fold greater level of SENP1 mRNA than their parental counterparts (Fig. 2A), suggesting that transformation of normal prostate epithelial cells induced SENP1 expression. Similarly, LNCaP cells also revealed higher SENP1 levels than RWPE1 cells (Fig. 2A). These results supported our observation in human prostate tissue that SENP1 levels are altered within PCa cells compared with normal prostate cells. We recently reported that 24-h exposure of human AR-positive LNCaP cells to the synthetic androgen R1881 (20 nm) was sufficient to enhance SENP1 expression by 5-fold (18Cheng J. Bawa T. Lee P. Gong L. Yeh E.T. Neoplasia. 2006; 8: 667-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Previous studies have established that the normal prostate epithelial cell line RWPE1 expresses functional AR (35Bello D. Webber M.M. Kleinman H.K. Wartinger D.D. Rhim J.S. Carcinogenesis. 1997; 18: 1215-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). However, treatment of RWPE1 cells with R1881 (20 nm) for 24 h did not alter SENP1 mRNA levels as compared with untreated control cells (n = 3, p = 0.48; Student's t test). Therefore, activated AR induces SENP1 mRNA levels specifically in prostate carcinoma cells. To determine whether the induction was selective for SENP1 in PCa cells, we evaluated the expression of a closely related SENP family member, SENP2, using specifically designed primers and probes (Fig. 2B). LNCaP cells exposed to the same concentration of R1881 exhibited a significantly greater level of SENP1 than SENP2 mRNA. Further real-time PCR analysis indicated that SENP1 levels paralleled the R1881 concentration in LNCaP cells; increasing R1881 concentration elevated SENP1 levels (Fig. 2C). This concentration-dependent induction of SENP1 mRNA was absent in the AR-deficient PCa cells, PC-3 (Fig. 2C). Concomitant administration of the AR antagonist bicalutamide (BIC, 5 μm) (Fig. 2D) with R1881 (20 nm) ablated the induction of SENP1 in LNCaP cells. The unaltered SENP1 levels in AR-negative PC-3 cells (Fig. 2C) and in the presence of the AR antagonist (Fig. 2D) indicated that activation of the AR is required for androgen regulation of SENP1 expression. Activation of AR Regulates the SENP1 Promoter Activity—Activation of the AR prompts transcription of numerous genes; hence we investigated whether the active AR modulates SENP1 gene transcription to augment SENP1 mRNA expression in PCa cells. Specific primers (supplemental Table S1) were used to clone the 4.1-kb SP1P fragment from the genomic DNA of the LNCaP cells. The fragment was subsequently fused to a firefly luciferase reporter gene in the promoter-less vector, pGL3-basic. In LNCaP cells, transfection of the SP1P plasmid (250 ng) produced a 11-fold greater luciferase response than transfection of an equivalent amount of the empty pGL3-basic vector, suggesting that the 4.1-kb clone included a functional promoter (mean relative luciferase activity values: pGL3-basic vector, 0.007, n = 4; SP1P plasmid, 0.082, n = 4; Student's t test, p < 0.05). Although functional in both cell lines, the SP1P plasmid exhibited five times less promoter activity in PC-3 than in LNCaP cells (Fig. 3A). To evaluate the contribution of the AR to SENP1 promoter activity, both cell lines were transfected with SP1P, and a subset of the population was co-transfected with AR cDNA (500 ng). Titrating concentrations of R1881 for 24 h produced a concentration-dependent induction of luciferase activity in both the presence and absence of exogenous AR in LNCaP cells (Fig. 3B); however, in the presence of AR, R1881 was more effective at prompting the response. In contrast, the addition of AR was required for promoter activity in AR-deficient PC-3 cells, and with the inclusion of AR, a more efficacious and potent R1881-induced luciferase response was observed (Fig. 3C). Hence, an activated AR mediated SENP1 promoter activity in PCa cells. Various deletion fragments were constructed to determine the minimal region required for AR regulation of SENP1 promoter activity (Fig. 3D). The native activity of each deletion construct was compared with the empty pGL3-basic vector (Fig. 3D). All deletion constructs, which included a large portion of the 5′ region, maintained promoter activity, whereas Del-4 did not (Fig. 3D). The smallest deletion construct with intact endogenous activity was Del-3; hence the core promoter required for activity was within a 1.4-kb region on Del-3. Interestingly, the Del-3 construct produced a 31-fold greater luciferase response as compared with the empty pGL3-basic vector and exhibited significantly greater native activity than all other constructs (ANOVA, p < 0.05). It is probable that a repressor region existed upstream of the Del-3 region, and therefore, ablation of this repressor region augmented core promoter activity. To assess the ability of androgen to induce promoter activity in the deletion constructs, we incubated LNCaP cells with titrating concentrations of R1881 after transfection of each deletion construct and AR cDNA. R1881 was 10-fold more potent at inducing Del-3 luciferase activity compared with Del-1 or -2 (comparison of log EC50 values,"

In particular, little is known about the involvement of regulatory proteins in these processes. Here we report that OS-9, a ubiquitously expressed endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated protein, interacts with the cytosolic N-terminal tail of TRPV4. Using a combination of co-expression and knockdown approaches we have found that OS-9 impedes the release of TRPV4 from the ER and reduces its amount at the plasma membrane. Consistent with these in vitro findings, OS-9 protected zebrafish embryos against the detrimental effects of TRPV4 expression in vivo. A detailed analysis of the underlying mechanisms revealed that OS-9 preferably binds TRPV4 monomers and other ER-localized, immature variants of TRPV4 and attenuates their polyubiquitination. Thus, OS-9 regulates the secretory transport of TRPV4 and appears to protect TRPV4 subunits from the precocious ubiquitination and ER-associated degradation. Our data suggest that OS-9 functions as an auxiliary protein for TRPV4 maturation.

Birnbaumer L. Flockerzi V. Cell. 2002; 108: 595-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Based on sequence similarity, this family can be further divided into several subfamilies, including TRPC (canonical), TRPV (vanilloid), TRPM (melastatin), and TRPP (polycystin) subfamilies (2Clapham D.E. Nature. 2003; 426: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (2138) Google Scholar). All TRP channels are predicted to share the same topology: six transmembrane (TM) segments, a pore-loop situated between TM5 and TM6, and intracellular N- and C-terminal tails. Depending on the subfamily, the cytosolic tails contain common conserved motifs such as ankyrin, PDZ, and coiled-coil domains (2Clapham D.E. Nature. 2003; 426: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (2138) Google Scholar). Similarly to voltage-gated K+ channels, functional TRP channels are formed by homo- or heteromeric assembly of four subunits (3Schaefer M. Pflugers Arch. 2005; 451: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Despite noticeable sequence similarity, TRP channels differ considerably in their selectivity and activation mechanisms even within subfamilies (1Montell C. Birnbaumer L. Flockerzi V.

Similarly to other membrane proteins, they are co-translationally translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), in the first stage of their secretory transport. Proteins transiting the ER undergo diverse modifications, such as glycosylation and disulfide bond formation. Importantly, the ER is also the place of protein folding and assembly of subunits into multimeric complexes (16Ellgaard L. Helenius A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (1672) Google Scholar). These processes are aided by numerous ER chaperones. Properly folded cargo proteins leave this compartment in COPII-coated vesicles. In contrast, non-native proteins are recognized by quality-control proteins and retained in the ER (16Ellgaard L. Helenius A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (1672) Google Scholar). Eventually, terminally misfolded cargo is degraded by the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. In this process, the cargo is retrotranslocated from the ER, polyubiquitinated, and degraded in the proteasome (17Meusser B. Hirsch C. Jarosch E. Sommer T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 766-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). Proteins with lesions in the luminal domains are recognized and processed by the ERAD-L (luminal) machinery, whereas membrane proteins with defective cytosolic domains become substrates of the ERAD-C (cytosolic) pathway (18Vashist S. Ng D.T. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). At present, the mechanisms governing selection of ERAD-L substrates are understood to some extent, but the recognition of cytosolic lesions remains rather obscure. One possible mechanism could involve retention of faulty proteins by exposure of short amino acid motifs, such as di-arginine motifs, that are normally hidden in the mature structure (19Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). In general, the quality control in the ER is a very precise process that, for certain proteins, is responsible for the degradation of the majority of synthesized polypeptides due to folding and assembly defects (16Ellgaard L. Helenius A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (1672) Google Scholar, 20Kopito R.R. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S167-S173Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that the cytosolic tails of TRP channels, and in particular the ankyrin repeats and coiled-coil domains, are important for subunit interactions and the assembly of mature tetramers (21Arniges M.

For example, TRPV4 splice variants lacking parts of ankyrin repeats are retained in the ER as a result of their inability to oligomerize (21Arniges M. Fernandez-Fernandez J.M. Albrecht N. Schaefer M. Valverde M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1580-1586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). However, much less is known about the auxiliary proteins regulating TRP channel maturation and their transit through the ER. Here we report a novel interaction between TRPV4 and human OS-9, a ubiquitous protein originally identified as being amplified in certain osteosarcomas (28Su Y.A. Hutter C.M. Trent J.M. Meltzer P.S. Mol. Carcinog. 1996; 15: 270-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Interestingly, its closest relative in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, termed Yos9p, localizes to the ER lumen and plays an important role in the selection of substrates for the ERAD-L pathway (29Cormier J.H. Pearse B.R. Hebert D.N. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 717-719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 30Friedmann E. Salzberg Y. Weinberger A. Shaltiel S. Gerst J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35274-35281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In contrast, mammalian OS-9 localizes to the cytoplasmic side of the ER (31Litovchick L. Friedmann E. Shaltiel S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34413-34423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In this work, we have found that human OS-9 binds the juxtamembrane region in the N-terminal tail of TRPV4, preferentially associating with TRPV4 monomers rather than tetramers. OS-9 prevents the polyubiquitination of TRPV4 at the ER and retards its transport through this compartment. Our data point to a role of OS-9 in the regulation of TRPV4 biogenesis by holding and protecting its monomers from a premature polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—The screen was performed using the Matchmaker 3 system (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The yeast strain AH109 expressing the N-terminal tail of mouse TRPV4 fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (BD) was transformed with the human adult kidney cDNA library (Clontech) constructed in the pACT2 vector. Approximately 5 × 106 transformants were screened on plates lacking histidine, adenine, and supplemented with 8 mm 3-aminotriazole. The cDNA clones isolated from growing colonies were subsequently reintroduced into the same yeast strain, and the strength of interactions was tested on plates containing as much as 25 mm 3-aminotriazole. The colony-lift filter assay was used to determine the β-galactosidase activity, and to confirm the interactions in an independent way. The clones were also tested for specificity by transforming them into an AH109 strain expressing GAL4 DNA-BD alone or DNA-BD/p53 fusion. Plasmids—All plasmids containing mouse TRPV4 sequences were generated from the pcDNA3-TRPV4 plasmid provided by U. Wissenbach (7Wissenbach U. Bodding M. Freichel M. Flockerzi V. FEBS Lett. 2000; 485: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The following plasmids used in this work were described previously: FLAG-N-TRPV4 (also named F9-N-TRPV4), TRPV4-FLAG, TRPV4-V5/His, TRPC4-V5/His, TRPV1-V5/His, TRPP2-V5/His, and TRPV4-V5 loop (32Wegierski T.

TRPV4-V5/His Δ226-437, Δ40-235, and Δ40-112 are derivatives of TRPV4-V5/His and lack the indicated regions. Human α-subunit of ENaC was C-terminally tagged with V5/His in the pcDNA6 vector (Invitrogen). FLAG-tagged N-terminal fragments of TRPV4 (D1-D5) are derivatives of FLAG-N-TRPV4. The fusion of GAL4 DNA-BD with TRPV4 (aa 61-467) was created in the pGBKT7 vector (Clontech). Fragments C1 (aa 307-667, Δ456-470) and C3 (aa 430-667) of human OS-9, isolated in the two-hybrid screen, were recloned into pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) with N-terminal FLAG tag. Isoform 1 of mouse OS-9 with a C-terminal V5 tag was constructed in the pcDNA3 vector. For generation of cell lines stably expressing TRPV4, a retroviral plasmid was prepared in which TRPV4-V5 loop sequence was cloned into the pLXSN vector (Clontech). For knockdown experiments, the OS-9 targeting sequence AACATCATCCAGGAGACAGAG or the control sequence ACGCATGCATGCTTGCTTT was cloned into the pLVTH vector (Addgene plasmid 12262) (33Wiznerowicz M. Trono D. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 8957-8961Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). These two plasmids were used to create additional knockdown constructs, in which the original GFP coding sequence was exchanged for TRPV4-V5/His Δ40-235. Plasmids coding for isoform 1 and 2 of mouse OS-9 were kindly provided by L. Litovchick (31Litovchick L. Friedmann E. Shaltiel S. J. Biol.

Cell Cultures, Transfections, and Viral Gene Transfers—Human embryonic kidney (HEK 293T) and HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The human sarcoma cells SJSA-1 were cultured in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transient transfections were carried out using the calcium phosphate method or FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science). Stable polyclonal cell lines were created by transduction of SJSA-1 cells with retroviruses or lentiviruses, produced in HEK 293T cells, in the presence of 8 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells stably expressing TRPV4-V5 loop protein were selected with 0.25 mg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen). Reagents—MG132 (Calbiochem) was used at 5 μg/ml.

Chem. 2002; 277: 34413-34423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The following commercially available antibodies were used: α-FLAG M2 and α-actin (Sigma-Aldrich), α-V5 (Serotec), α-GFP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), α-ubiquitin P4D1 (Covance), rabbit α-OS-9 (Protein Tech Group), α-transferrin receptor (Zymed Laboratories), α-Golgin-97 (Molecular Probes, Madison, WI), α-calnexin (Stressgen), and α-HA 12CA5 (Roche Applied Science). Secondary horseradish peroxidase-coupled antibodies against guinea pig, rabbit, and mouse IgG were from Dako and GE Healthcare. Cy3-, Cy5-, and Alexa488-conjugated antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch and Molecular Probes. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated α-mouse antibody was from Sigma-Aldrich. Co-immunoprecipitation Assay—Thirty-six hours after transfection, HEK 293T cells were lysed in the immunoprecipitation buffer (1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with an appropriate antibody, and subsequently with 30 μl of Protein G-Sepharose beads for ∼3 h. The beads were washed extensively with the immunoprecipitation buffer, and the retained proteins were analyzed by Western blotting. Cross-linking—Cells were lysed in the buffer containing 90 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm Na4P2O7, 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and the lysates were cleared by centrifugation. The proteins were cross-linked with amine-reactive BS3 (Pierce) at a final concentration of 75-200 μm for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction was quenched with 40 mm Tris (pH 7.5) for 15 min. Ubiquitination Assay—Transfected HEK 293T or SJSA-1 cells were washed with PBS and lysed in buffer A (8 m urea, 100 mm NaH2PO4, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0; all steps were performed at room temperature). The supernatant obtained after centrifugation of the lysates at 75,000 × g was incubated with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) for 1 h. The beads were washed twice with buffer A and twice with buffer B (same as A, except for 0.5% Triton X-100 and pH 6.3). Bound proteins were eluted with buffer C (same as A, except for 0.1% Triton X-100 and pH 4.5). Immunofluorescence—Cells were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, permeabilized with 0.05% Triton X-100, and blocked in PBS containing 1% horse serum. Immunostainings were performed sequentially with appropriate primary antibodies and fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies. All images were obtained with an LSM 510 confocal microscope (Zeiss, Germany). Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—The assay was performed essentially as described in a previous study (32Wegierski T. Hill K. Schaefer M. Walz G. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5659-5669Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The cells split in parallel were lysed with a lysis solution (Tropix, Bedford, MA) to measure the β-galactosidase activity with o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside as the substrate. This reaction was performed to control the transfection efficiency and normalize the alkaline phosphatase activity. Biotinylation Assay—Transfected HEK 293T cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS (pH 8.0) and collected by centrifugation at 1500 rpm for 5 min. Surface proteins were biotinylated with 1 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce) in PBS (pH 8.0) at room temperature for 30 min, according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Subsequently, the cells were lysed at 4 °C for 1 h in PBS (pH 8.0) containing 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Cell lysates were incubated with 30 μl of streptavidin beads (Pierce) at 4 °C overnight. The beads were washed twice with 1 m KCl, twice with 0.1 m Na2CO3, and once with PBS. Biotinylated proteins were eluted with SDS-PAGE loading buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-V5 and anti-transferrin receptor antibodies. Zebrafish Experiments—Wild-type zebrafish ABTL strain was maintained as described before (35Westerfield M. The Zebrafish Book: A Guide for the Laboratory Use of Zebrafish (Danio rerio). 4th Ed. University of Oregon Press, Eugene, OR1995: 1.1-1.35Google Scholar). Embryos were kept in Danieau solution and staged according to hours post-fertilization. The capped RNAs, synthesized using the mMessage mMachine T7 kit (Ambion, Austin, TX), were microinjected into one-cell stage embryos in 100 mm KCl, 0.1% Phenol Red, and 10 mm HEPES at doses of 600 (TRPV4), 1000 (TRPC4), or 200 (OS-9) pg. Data were analyzed with the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test. OS-9 Is a Novel TRPV4-binding Protein—To identify new proteins interacting with the intracellular N-terminal tail of TRPV4 (N-TRPV4), we performed a yeast two-hybrid assay. Screening of a human adult kidney cDNA library resulted in the isolation of 16 clones that specifically provided adenine and histidine prototrophy to the yeast when co-expressed with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain fused to aa 61-467 of mouse TRPV4. Three of these clones contained overlapping fragments originating from the same cDNA sequence. The protein encoded by this cDNA was originally identified as amplified in osteosarcomas and termed OS-9 (28Su Y.A. Hutter C.M. Trent J.M. Meltzer P.S. Mol. Carcinog. 1996; 15: 270-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Three splicing isoforms of human OS-9 were initially described (36Kimura Y. Nakazawa M. Yamada M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 876-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The longest isoform, 1, contains 667 aa, isoform 2 lacks aa 535-589, whereas isoform 3 lacks aa 456-470 and 535-589. All three clones isolated by us code for the C-terminal domain of OS-9, starting at different residues. Clone OS-9-C1 extended from aa 307, OS-9-C2 from aa 395, and OS-9-C3 from aa 430. The sequence analysis revealed that OS-9-C2 and OS-9-C3 represent isoform 1 of human OS-9, whereas clone OS-9-C1, lacking aa 456-470 but not aa 535-589, conforms to the recently discovered fourth isoform (GenBank™ accession number NP_001017958). To confirm that the interaction between OS-9 and TRPV4 also occurs in mammalian cells, OS-9-C1 and OS-9-C3 fragments were N-terminally fused to the FLAG tag, expressed in HEK 293T cells, and purified using anti-FLAG antibodies. The full-length TRPV4 co-immunoprecipitated with both proteins, but not with FLAG-tagged GFP (Fig. 1A). In a reverse approach, we found that the isoforms 1 and 2 of mouse OS-9 co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-tagged full-length TRPV4 (TRPV4-FLAG) as well as with FLAG-tagged N-terminal tail of TRPV4 (FLAG-N-TRPV4 (Fig. 1B)). We subsequently decided to map the region of TRPV4 responsible for the interaction with OS-9. For this purpose, we generated additional FLAG-tagged N-terminal fragments of TRPV4 and found that a fragment covering all three ankyrin domains and the juxtamembrane region (fragment D5, aa 237-468) interacted most strongly with OS-9. Fragments containing aa 1-370 (D2) and aa 1-436 (D3) did not show any interaction (Fig. 1C). However, the co-immunoprecipitation of OS-9 was regained when the D2 fragment was extended by aa 438-468 (D4). This experiment indicates that the juxtamembrane region (aa 438-468) in TRPV4 is required, although not necessarily sufficient, for the interaction with OS-9. OS-9 was previously isolated in three two-hybrid screens using unrelated proteins as baits (31Litovchick L. Friedmann E. Shaltiel S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34413-34423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 37Baek J.H. Mahon P.C. Oh J. Kelly B. Krishnamachary B. Pearson M. Chan D.A. Giaccia A.J. Semenza G.L.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we have found that all these proteins share a short stretch of limited sequence similarity in their predicted OS-9 interacting regions (Fig. 1D). For TRPV4, this region of similarity extends from aa 441 to 466 and may be part of the OS-9 binding interface. OS-9 Interacts with Other TRP Family Members—To determine whether OS-9 interacts with other channel proteins, we performed a co-immunoprecipitation assay in HEK 293T cells, using several V5/His-tagged TRP proteins (TRPV1, TRPV4, TRPC4, and TRPP2), as well as the identically tagged α-subunit of the epithelial sodium channel (αENaC). This experiment showed that OS-9 co-immunoprecipitated only with TRPV4 and TRPV1, but not with other tested TRP channels or αENaC (Fig. 2). Importantly, TRPV1 and TRPV4 show high sequence conservation (62% identity) within the proposed OS-9 binding region (Fig. 1D). Thus, OS-9 may specifically bind the TRP channels of the vanilloid subfamily. OS-9 Interacts with TRPV4 at the ER—The splice variants of TRPV4 that contain deletions within the ankyrin repeats are retained in the ER (21Arniges M. Fernandez-Fernandez J.M. Albrecht N. Schaefer M. Valverde M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1580-1586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In agreement with this report, we observed that a TRPV4 mutant missing all three repeats (Δ226-437) localized to the ER (Fig. 3A). The same localization was found for another TRPV4 mutant, in which a more proximal region was deleted (Δ40-235, Fig. 3A). In contrast, a TRPV4 variant with a shorter truncation (Δ40-112) did not accumulate in the ER but instead was detected at the cell periphery (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, both ER-retained mutants immunoprecipitated OS-9 more efficiently than the full-length TRPV4 did, suggesting that the interaction between the two proteins takes place at the ER (Fig. 3A). This hypothesis was supported by a previously reported finding that OS-9 associates with the cytoplasmic side of the ER (31Litovchick L. Friedmann E. Shaltiel S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34413-34423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thus, we decided to investigate whether OS-9 plays a role in the secretory transport of TRPV4 and affects its cellular distribution. Transiently expressed OS-9 extensively co-localized with the ER marker BAP31 in HeLa cells (Fig. 3B). Similar results were obtained for endogenous OS-9 in SJSA-1 cells (Fig. 3C), an osteosarcoma cell line that expresses high levels of OS-9 (36Kimura Y. Nakazawa M. Yamada M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 876-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). 4In Ref. 36Kimura Y. Nakazawa M. Yamada M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 876-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, the SJSA-1 cell line is called OsA-CL. Using a retroviral gene transfer, we prepared a polyclonal SJSA-1 cell line stably expressing full-length TRPV4 protein with a V5 tag engineered into its first extracellular loop (TRPV4-V5 loop) (32Wegierski T. Hill K. Schaefer M. Walz G. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5659-5669Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In these cells, a substantial portion of TRPV4 accumulated in the ER, as demonstrated by its co-localization with OS-9 and BAP31 (Fig. 3D). Depletion of OS-9 Facilitates Release of TRPV4 from the ER—Next we investigated whether depletion of endogenous OS-9 by RNA interference affects the subcellular localization of TRPV4-V5 loop protein in SJSA-1 cells. We identified one shRNA clone that efficiently reduced OS-9 protein levels in a transient expression system (data not shown) and generated a lentivirus that directed the expression of this shRNA in combination with GFP. Transduction of SJSA-1 cells with this lentivirus resulted in a substantial reduction of OS-9 protein, as assessed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 4A), and attenuated the OS-9 immunoreactivity in GFP-positive (i.e. transduced) cells (Fig. 4B, upper panels). Transduction with the lentivirus expressing control shRNA had no effect on OS-9 levels (Fig. 4, A and B). We next analyzed the immunolocalization of TRPV4 in GFP-positive SJSA-1 cells (Fig. 4C). We found that TRPV4 did not substantially co-localize with the ER resident protein calnexin in cells expressing the OS-9 shRNA, bu"
https://openalex.org/W1995511900,"Bacterial release factors RF1 and RF2 are methylated on the Gln residue of a universally conserved tripeptide motif GGQ, which interacts with the peptidyl transferase center of the large ribosomal subunit, triggering hydrolysis of the ester bond in peptidyl-tRNA and releasing the newly synthesized polypeptide from the ribosome. In vitro experiments have shown that the activity of RF2 is stimulated by Gln methylation. The viability of Escherichia coli K12 strains depends on the integrity of the release factor methyltransferase PrmC, because K12 strains are partially deficient in RF2 activity due to the presence of a Thr residue at position 246 instead of Ala. Here, we study in vivo RF1 and RF2 activity at termination codons in competition with programmed frameshifting and the effect of the Ala-246 → Thr mutation. PrmC inactivation reduces the specific termination activity of RF1 and RF2(Ala-246) by ∼3- to 4-fold. The mutation Ala-246 → Thr in RF2 reduces the termination activity in cells ∼5-fold. After correction for the decrease in level of RF2 due to the autocontrol of RF2 synthesis, the mutation Ala-246 → Thr reduced RF2 termination activity by ∼10-fold at UGA codons and UAA codons. PrmC inactivation had no effect on cell growth in rich media but reduced growth considerably on poor carbon sources. This suggests that the expression of some genes needed for optimal growth under such conditions can become growth limiting as a result of inefficient translation termination.

This suggests that the expression of some genes needed for optimal growth under such conditions can become growth limiting as a result of inefficient translation termination. Termination codons in mRNA are recognized on the ribosome by proteins called class 1 release factors (RFs) 2The abbreviations used are: RF, release factor; MTase, methyltransferase. 2The abbreviations used are: RF, release factor; MTase, methyltransferase. (1Kisselev L.L. Buckingham R.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 561-566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 2Kisselev L. Ehrenberg M. Frolova L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). RFs bind to the ribosome when a stop codon is presented in the A-site and trigger hydrolysis by the peptidyl transferase center of the ester bond between the polypeptide and tRNA of peptidyl-tRNA bound to the P-site. Two class 1 RFs are used in eubacterial cells to recognize the three stop codons UAG, UAA, and UGA with overlapping specificity: RF1, encoded by prfA, recognizes UAG and UAA, and RF2, encoded by prfB, recognizes UAA and UGA. In contrast, a single RF is sufficient for termination at all three stop codons in eukaryotic or archebacterial cells. The region of RFs that interacts with the peptidyl transferase center has been identified and contains a universally conserved tripeptide motif, GGQ (3Petry S. Brodersen D.E. Murphy F.V.t.

The presence of this interaction has recently been confirmed by x-ray crystallography of RFs bound to Thermus thermophilus 70 S ribosomes (3Petry S. Brodersen D.E. Murphy F.V.t. Dunham C.M. Selmer M. Tarry M.J. Kelley A.C. Ramakrishnan V. Cell. 2005; 123: 1255-1266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The GGQ motif is the only part of RFs that is conserved between factors of eubacterial, eukaryotic, and archebacterial origin. Although archebacterial and eukaryotic RFs are homologous, they have apparently evolved independently of the eubacterial RFs. The GGQ tripeptide has been shown to be post-translationally modified by methylation on the side-chain amide group of the Gln residue. This was first shown in bacteria (5Dinçbas-Renqvist V. Engström Å. Mora L. Heurgué-Hamard V. Buckingham R.H. Ehrenberg M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6900-6907Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), where RFs are modified by the methyltransferase (MTase) PrmC (6Heurgué-Hamard V. Champ S. Engstöm Å. Ehrenberg M. Buckingham R.H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 769-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 7Nakahigashi K. Kubo N. Narita S. Shimaoka T. Goto S. Oshima T. Mori H. Maeda M. Wada C. Inokuchi H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1473-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), but it has since been demonstrated that methylation occurs also in eukaryotic cells (8Heurgué-Hamard V. Champ S.

Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2562-2571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), despite the different evolutionary origin of the eubacterial and eukaryotic RFs. Whether archebacterial RFs are methylated is unknown, but homologues of the RF MTase exist in these organisms (6Heurgué-Hamard V. Champ S. Engstöm Å. Ehrenberg M. Buckingham R.H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 769-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Although the overlapping specificity of stop codon recognition has not been called into question, genetic experiments in Escherichia coli have indicated that certain UAA codons are read almost exclusively by RF1, despite the fact that the intracellular concentration of RF2 is several times higher than that of RF1 (10Adamski F.M. McCaughan K.K. Jørgensen F. Kurland C.G. Tate W.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thus, mutations affecting RF1 could suppress UAA nonsense codons, indicating that the presence of RF2 did not compensate for reduced RF1 activity (11Kawakami K. Nakamura Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8432-8436Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 12Ryden S.M. Isaksson L.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 193: 38-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This was in contrast to the situation in Salmonella typhimurium, where RF2 read UAA codons efficiently and RF1 mutants did not show UAA suppressor activity (13Elliott T. Wang X. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4144-4154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Uno et al. (14Uno M. Ito K. Nakamura Y. Biochimie (Paris). 1996; 78: 935-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) showed that the difference between E. coli and S. typhimurium can be attributed to 1 of the 16 differences in sequence between RF2 in the two organisms: the presence of Thr at position 246 in place of Ala. Residue 246 and the GGQ motif are only four residues apart in the primary sequence. Subsequent experiments, and the accumulation of genomic sequence data for eubacteria, showed that the presence of Thr-246 in RF2 is a peculiarity of E. coli K12 strains. Other laboratory strains, such as E. coli B and C6 (MRE600), have Ala-246, as do all other E. coli isolates for which genomic data are available (5Dinçbas-Renqvist V. Engström Å. Mora L. Heurgué-Hamard V. Buckingham R.H. Ehrenberg M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6900-6907Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that A246T is a mutation acquired during the extensive laboratory mutagenesis to which early K12 strains were subjected (15Bachmann, B. J. (1987) in Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology (Neidhardt, F. C., Ingraham, J. L., Brooks Low, K., Magasanik, B., Schaechter, M., and Umbarger, H. E., eds.) pp. 1190–1219, American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. CGoogle Scholar). All other bacteria have Ala or Ser in both RF1 and RF2 in the position corresponding to 246 in E. coli RF2. We will therefore consider RF2 Ala-246 as the wild-type form in E. coli, to which K12 strains are an exception. One consequence of the presence in E. coli K12 strains of Thr-246 in RF2 is that lack of RF2 methylation almost completely inhibits cell growth. Revertants of K12 prmC mutant strains to normal growth in rich media show mutations T246A or T246S in RF2 (5Dinçbas-Renqvist V. Engström Å. Mora L. Heurgué-Hamard V. Buckingham R.H. Ehrenberg M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6900-6907Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 6Heurgué-Hamard V. Champ S. Engstöm Å. Ehrenberg M. Buckingham R.H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 769-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 7Nakahigashi K. Kubo N. Narita S. Shimaoka T. Goto S. Oshima T. Mori H. Maeda M. Wada C. Inokuchi H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1473-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This suggests that the A246T mutation and lack of RF2 methylation both result in defects in RF2 activity, either one of which can be present without marked deleterious effect under certain growth conditions, notably in rich media, but which when present together decrease RF2 activity to a level no longer compatible with normal cell growth. Most experiments in vivo have been performed in K12 strains with partially defective RF2 due to the presence of T246. Almost all in vitro experiments have been performed with RF2 Ala-246 in the non-methylated form due to the preparation of release factors from overproducing strains. Previously, the effects of methylation of RF1 and RF2, and of the A246T mutation in RF2, were studied in vitro in a purified system synthesizing very short peptides (5Dinçbas-Renqvist V. Engström Å. Mora L. Heurgué-Hamard V. Buckingham R.H. Ehrenberg M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6900-6907Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In these experiments, it was found that lack of methylation and the change A246T both strongly reduced termination efficiency at UAA codons, but as the effects fell sharply with increasing peptide length, it was unclear what effects should be expected in the case of stop codons terminating normal proteins. Inefficient stop codons, almost always UGA, have been implicated in several types of recoding events on the ribosome, involving frameshifting, stop codon readthrough (16Arkov A.L. Mankin A. Murgola E.J. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2744-2748Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), polypeptide chain tagging by transfer messenger RNA (17Collier J. Binet E. Bouloc P. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and feedback on peptide chain initiation as a result of ribosome queuing (18Jin H. Bjornsson A. Isaksson L.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4357-4367Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Studies of this type have generally been conducted in E. coli K12 strains, and the conclusions are potentially affected by the presence of a partially defective RF2. We therefore decided to examine the activity of release factors in vivo, both with respect to the presence in K12 strains of Thr-246 in RF2 rather than Ala-246 and to RF1 and RF2(Ala-246) methylation. Data are presented from in vivo experiments with release factors present at normal levels on termination efficiency at all three stop codons in different contexts. We also show that deficiency in RF methylation, but not the change A246T in RF2, leads to growth deficiencies under some conditions that explain the ubiquity of bacterial RF MTases. Strains—E. coli strains used in this study (Table 1) were derived from the K12 strain Xac or the B strain BL21. VH1039 was constructed from SC8 (6Heurgué-Hamard V. Champ S. Engstöm Å. Ehrenberg M. Buckingham R.H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 769-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) by transduction with a P1 lysate on strain CAG18579, introducing trp::Tn10kan and creating the prmC+, tetS strain VH1033. The trp,hemA region was then restored to wild type by transduction to trp+ with a P1 lysate on a wild-type K12 strain. To inactivate prmC in strain LMG119D, the point mutation in codon 119 was first introduced into prmC cloned in pLV(hemK) (19Graille M. Heurgue-Hamard V. Champ S. Mora L. Scrima N.

The prmC region was excised as an NdeI-BamHI fragment, recloned between the same sites in plasmid pET11a (Novagen), re-excised as a HindIII-XbaI fragment, and cloned between the same sites in pMAK705 (20Hamilton C.M. Aldea M. Washburn B.K. Babitzke P. Kushner S.R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4617-4622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This plasmid was used to exchange the chromosomal prmC gene in strain VH1039 and the plasmid carried gene by recombination and excision (20Hamilton C.M. Aldea M. Washburn B.K. Babitzke P.

Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4617-4622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the desired mode of resolution being monitored by the acquisition of the KpnI site in the resolved plasmid, yielding strain LMG119D. To construct BLM607, a tetR transposon from the prfA temperature-sensitive strain US477 was transduced to the hemA strain CGSC4806, screening for retention of temperature sensitivity, and hence hemA41. A P1 lysate on the resulting strain was then used to transduce hemA41 to BL21, yielding strain BLM607. The prmC gene was then inactivated by transducing BLM607 with a P1 lysate on strain LMG119D, selecting for growth on Luria-Bertani (LB) medium without 5-aminolevulinic acid, yielding BLM608. To construct BLM612, the kanR transposon in strain VH1125 was transduced to strain Xac carrying a plasmid expressing prfB(Thr-246), which inhibits growth, screening for continued slow growth, indicating maintenance of chromosomal prfB(Thr-246). The latter allele was transduced to BLM608, again screening for small colonies, and prmC was then rendered wild type by transduction with a P1 lysate on a wild-type K12 strain, yielding BLM612.TABLE 1E. coli strains used in this workDesignationShort name/backgroundGenotypeReferenceVH1039A+/K12Xac, prfB(Ala246)This workLMG119DA-/K12Xac, prfB(Ala246), prmC(Asp119)This workXacT+/K12D(lac-pro), argE, ara, gyrA, rpoB, thi(45Coulondre C.

Heurgué-Hamard, unpublished Open table in a new tab Growth Media—LB was used as rich medium, supplemented by antibiotics as required at the following concentrations: ampicillin (200 μg/ml), tetracycline (12.5 μg/ml), kanamycin (50 μg/ml), chloramphenicol (15 μg/ml) (21Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1972Google Scholar). Minimal medium was as described by Vogel and Bonner (22Vogel H.J. Bonner D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 218: 97-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with 0.2% glucose, 0.4% succinate, or 0.4% acetate as carbon source (23Neidhardt F.C. Bloch P.L. Pederson S. Reeh S. J. Bacteriol. 1977; 129: 378-387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Solid media were similar but contained 12 g/liter agar (Difco). In experiments on bacterial growth, to minimize lag effects due to adaptation to solid media, strains were streaked from liquid media containing similar nutrients to the plates and were in growth phase before streaking. Measurement of Termination Efficiency in Vivo—MalE-LacZα fusion proteins, separated by a window containing the RF2 frameshift site and variants, were expressed from ampicillin-resistant pBR-derived plasmids as described by Poole et al. (24Poole E.S. Brown C.M. Tate W.P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Transformants of A+, A–, and T+ strains (Table 1) were grown to an A600 of 0.5 and induced with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 1 mm for a further period of 2 h. Cell proteins were solubilized in SDS-gel loading buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis as described by Poole et al. (24Poole E.S. Brown C.M. Tate W.P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Transfer to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond C Super, GE Healthcare) and Western blotting with anti-MalE antibodies (Anti-MBP-antiserum, New England Biolabs) diluted ×5000 were performed as described by Sambrook et al. (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar), using 125I-labeled protein A (GE Healthcare). Radioactivity was measured using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Western Blotting for RF Measurement—Cultures were grown in LB medium and induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside as described for in vivo termination efficiency experiments. Western blot experiments were performed using rabbit anti-RF1, anti-RF2, and anti-EF-Tu antibodies commercially prepared from pure factors. For measurement of RF1, preparations were normally used undiluted; for RF2 they were diluted ×20, and aliquots of 10–20 μl were applied to polyacrylamide gels. Pure non-His-tagged RFs as standards in Western blots were prepared as described by Mora et al. (26Mora L. Heurgué-Hamard V. Champ S. Ehrenberg M. Kisselev L. Buckingham R.H. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 267-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Aliquots of 1 ml of culture were centrifuged, and the cells were lysed for 10 min at 100 °C in 200 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol). Proteins were separated by electrophoresis on 10% polyacrylamide gels as described by Laemmli (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Transfer to nitrocellulose membranes, Western blotting with antibodies (diluted ×5000), and quantification were performed as described above. RF Methylation Increases Termination Efficiency in Vivo at All Three Stop Codons—Previous studies of the effect of RF methylation on termination efficiency have been restricted to the release of di- to tetrapeptides in an in vitro translation system primed with synthetic mRNAs (5Dinçbas-Renqvist V. Engström Å. Mora L. Heurgué-Hamard V. Buckingham R.H. Ehrenberg M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6900-6907Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, termination by RF2 at UAA codons was significantly stimulated when the factor was methylated. However, no effect of methylation on the activity of RF1 was observed. To study the effects on termination efficiency in vivo at each stop codon of termination factor methylation and of the mutation at position 246 in RF2, we adopted the in vivo termination assay developed by Poole et al. (24Poole E.S. Brown C.M. Tate W.P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), in their pioneering work on the effect of downstream context on stop signal efficiency. This system is based on competition between translational termination and ribosomal frameshifting at the frameshift site present in E. coli RF2. At this site, an in-frame UGA stop codon is bypassed by a +1 ribosomal frameshift, stimulated by the presence of a Shine-Dalgarno sequence six nucleotides upstream of the stop codon. In the assay system, the RF2 frameshift window is fused to the malE gene, expressed from a plasmid. Termination, stop codon readthrough (not observed in our experiments) and +1 frame-shifting lead to proteins of 43.9, 46.2, and 52.0 kDa, respectively, that are separated by SDS-gel electrophoresis and detected by Western blotting, binding of anti-MalE antibody, and interaction with 125I-labeled protein A (Fig. 1A). The UGA codon may be replaced by UAG or UAA stop codons. The efficiency of stop codons is highly influenced by the surrounding nucleotide sequence (24Poole E.S. Brown C.M. Tate W.P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 28Stormo G.D. Schneider T.D. Gold L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 6661-6679Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), the greatest effects being due to the nature of the nucleotide immediately downstream of the stop codon. The three stop codons may be followed by any of the 4 nucleotides, giving 12 “tetranucleotide stop signals.” The efficiency of frameshifting is supposed not to be affected by the nature of the tetranucleotide stop signal (29Curran J.F. Yarus M. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The ratio of the frameshift product to the termination product is thus a direct measure of the termination efficiency. This system has been used to compare the efficiency of termination in vivo at the 12-tetranucleotide stop signals, catalyzed by methylated or unmethylated RFs, or the methylated Thr-246 form of RF2 found in K12 strains. Previous studies of prmC inactivation have used strains in which the gene was inactivated by the insertion of a tetracycline-resistant cassette (6Heurgué-Hamard V. Champ S. Engstöm Å. Ehrenberg M. Buckingham R.H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 769-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), which is likely to increase expression of the downstream genes due to the presence of the active tetA promoter. For this reason we have constructed an inactive point mutant of prmC for the experiments we report here in which the most conserved Gly (residue 119) of the major S-adenosylmethionine binding motif (GTGTG) is replaced by an Asp. Examples of the data obtained at stop signals of widely varying efficiency in each of the three strains, T+ (prmC+, RF2(T246)), A–(prmC–, RF2(A246)), and A+ (prmC+, RF2(A246)) are shown in Fig. 1B. MalE-containing products arising from termination and frameshifting were measured as described above, using phosphor storage methods. The rate of termination relative to frameshifting, calculated from such data and obtained at each of the twelve tetranucleotide stop signals UAAN, UGAN, and UAGN is shown in Fig. 2. The absence of methylation is seen to decrease termination efficiency at all twelve tetranucleotide stop signals, implying that there are significant effects on both RF1- and RF2-dependent termination. A reduction in termination efficiency of approximately similar proportions is seen at each downstream context for all of the three stop codons; thus, comparing the results in strains A+ and A–, the effect of lack of methylation is not significantly greater in some downstream contexts with respect to others. As a corollary, the effects of context in strains A+ and A– are similar to those originally reported by Poole et al. (24Poole E.S. Brown C.M. Tate W.P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) in a K12 strain. Thus, termination efficiency is favored by downstream context in the order U > G > A > Cat UAA and UGA codons, and G > U > A > C at UAG codons. Comparing the results in strain T+ to those of Poole et al. (24Poole E.S. Brown C.M. Tate W.P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) in another K12 strain, the observations are qualitatively similar, but the overall levels of termination with respect to frameshifting are lower by a factor of ∼3. In our experiments, the frequency of frameshifting at UGAC, the naturally occurring stop signal at the frameshift site in prfB is ∼60%, comparable to in vivo estimations in the prfB gene itself (30Craigen W.J. Caskey C.T. Nature. 1986; 322: 273-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Comparing the efficiency of termination at UGA codons in strains T+ and A+, it can be seen that the reduction in termination efficiency with Thr in place of Ala is considerably greater than the effect of lack of methylation. Unexpectedly, the nature of residue 246 in RF2 was seen to reduce termination efficiency at UAG codons, recognized exclusively by RF1, by ∼30%. This will be discussed further below, in terms of changes in the intracellular concentration of the factors. Intracellular Concentrations of RFs in Mutant Strains—The data described above reflect termination efficiency of RF1 and RF2 in vivo and are not necessarily a direct measure of kcat/Km, because they do not take into account possible changes in RF concentration in the cell resulting from the mutations in prmC and prfB. The +1 frameshift required for RF2 synthesis constitutes an autoregulatory mechanism, so that increased RF2 activity will lead to a decrease in the intracellular concentration of the factor (31Craigen W.J. Cook R.G. Tate W.P. Caskey C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3616-3620Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Lack of methylation and the mutation A246T in RF2 are therefore expected to increase intracellular RF2 concentrations, which implies that the changes in termination efficiency that we observe in vivo will underestimate the changes in kcat/Km. More unexpectedly, the data in Fig. 2 suggest that RF2 activity may affect expression of prfA. The concentrations of RF1 and RF2 were therefore measured directly by Western blotting in extracts from cells grown under the same conditions as those used for measurements of termination efficiency. To transform the data on relative concentrations of RFs in the different strains into absolute data, variable quantities of purified RFs were added in some experiments to aliquots of cell extract before electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gel and Western blotting (Fig. 3 and Table 2). To facilitate comparison of different strains, a major protein component in the cell, elongation factor EF-Tu, was chosen as an internal standard, and quantities of RFs were measured in relation to the concentration of EF-Tu.TABLE 2Intracellular concentrations of RF1 and RF2 during exponential growth in rich media in K12 strains T+, A+, and A-StrainRF1RF2T+3,60026,000A+5,20013,500A-4,70015,500 Open table in a new tab The results show that RF2 levels in strains T+, A–, and A+ vary in the way expected from the autocontrol mechanism: RF2 is present in strain A+ (A246, prmC+) at ∼60% the concentration compared with strain T+; the level in strain A– is intermediate, as found for the release activity at UGA codons. In the case of RF1, a level ∼30% less was found in strain T+ compared with strain A+; an intermediate level was found in strain A–. This finding is consistent with the expectation that the specific activity of RF1 for peptide release is similar in strains T+ and A+. The reason for the change in RF1 level is not clear, but control experiments in which RF levels were measured in strains T+, A–, and A+ that were not transformed by plasmids expressing MalE, or that were transformed by control plasmids lacking the MalE insertion, did not show these differences in the level of RF1 (results not shown), suggesting that they are an indirect effect of MalE overproduction. Previous studies (13Elliott T. Wang X. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4144-4154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Weiss R.B. Murphy J.P. Gallant J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 158: 362-364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) show that E. coli cells are far from being saturated with respect to release factors; the rate of termination should therefore be approximately proportional to RF concentration. Whereas the data in Fig. 2 reflect termination activity in cells, a more accurate measure of RF specific activity may therefore be obtained by normalizing these values with respect to the concentration of the RF (Fig. 4). Because the results in Fig. 2 showed that downstream context did not selectively affect the effect of lack of methylation"
https://openalex.org/W2083291077,"We previously showed that ENaC is present in lipid rafts in A6 cells, a Xenopus kidney cell line. We now demonstrate that ENaC can be detected in lipid rafts in mouse cortical collecting duct (MPKCCD14) cells by detergent insolubility, buoyancy on density gradients using two distinct approaches, and colocalization with caveolin 1. Less than 30% of ENaC subunits were found in raft fractions. The channel subunits also colocalized on sucrose gradients with known vesicle targeting and fusion proteins syntaxin 1A, Vamp 2, and SNAP23. Hormonal stimulation of ENaC activity by either forskolin or aldosterone, short or long term, did not alter the lipid raft distribution of ENaC. Methyl-β-cyclodextrin added apically to MPKCCD14 cells resulted in a slow decline in amiloride-sensitive sodium transport with short circuit current reductions of 38.1 ± 9.6% after 60 min. The slow decline in ENaC activity in response to apical cyclodextrin was identical to the rate of decline seen when protein synthesis was inhibited by cycloheximide. Apical biotinylation of MPKCCD14 cells confirmed the loss of ENaC at the cell surface following cyclodextrin treatment. Acute stimulation of the recycling pool of ENaC was unaffected by apical cyclodextrin application. Expression of dominant negative caveolin isoforms (CAV1-eGFP and CAV3-DGV) which disrupt caveolae, reduced basal ENaC currents by 72.3 and 78.2%, respectively; but, as with cyclodextrin, the acute response to forskolin was unaffected. We conclude that ENaC is present in and regulated by lipid rafts. The data are consistent with a model in which rafts mediate the constitutive apical delivery of ENaC.

We conclude that ENaC is present in and regulated by lipid rafts. The data are consistent with a model in which rafts mediate the constitutive apical delivery of ENaC. Rafts are discrete transitory lipid domains that exist within the plane of cell membranes and that segregate lipids and proteins into regions that differ in their physical properties. They possess high concentrations of cholesterol and saturated sphingolipids in the outer leaflet of the bilayer, which contributes to a thicker, more closely packed liquid-ordered (lo) phase thought to offer a thermodynamically favorable environment for certain membrane-associated and membrane-embedded proteins. In particular, GPI-anchored proteins and multiple acylated proteins such as the Src-like tyrosine kinases appear to have a high affinity for the more ordered lipid environment found in raft domains, principally as a function of their lipid modifications. However, there is now a growing literature to show that integral membrane proteins such as transporters and ion channels can also be found in rafts. These include aquaporin water channels (1Ishikawa Y. Yuan Z. Inoue N. Skowronski M.T. Nakae Y. Shono M. Cho G. Yasui M. Agre P. Nielsen S. Am. J. Physiol.

Raft localization may have varying functional consequences: rafts are thought to operate as apical targeting platforms in the biosynthetic pathway, as organizers of receptor/signaling complexes on the cell surface or as sites of non-clathrin mediated endocytosis (11Fullekrug J. Simons K. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2004; 1014: 164-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In some cases rafts and/or cholesterol have been found to have functional effects on channel kinetics independent of trafficking, suggesting a role for protein-lipid interactions in modulating channel activities (12Pottosin II Valencia-Cruz G.

An B. Johnson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33541-33544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies in A6 cells have suggested that ENaC single channel kinetics are not directly affected by cholesterol depletion, although acute responses to hormonal stimuli are modestly reduced (14Balut C. Steels P. Radu M. Ameloot M. Driessche W.V. Jans D. Am. J. Physiol.

It is a heteromeric channel comprised of three homologous subunits (α, β, and γ) and is localized to the apical membrane of Na+ reabsorbing epithelial cells. Only a minority of ENaC subunits that are synthesized within a natively expressing cell appear to reach the apical membrane (15Valentijn J.A. Fyfe G.K. Canessa C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30344-30351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The mechanism of apical targeting is unknown. ENaC residence at the apical membrane is primarily regulated by ubiquitination, which is itself subject to hormonal regulation (16Snyder P.M. Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 5079-5085Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The channel is internalized by clathrin-mediated endocytosis (17Wang H. Traub L.M. Weixel K.M. Hawryluk M.J. Shah N. Edinger R.S. Perry C.J. Kester L. Butterworth M.B. Peters K.W. Kleyman T.R. Frizzell R.A. Johnson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14129-14135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and appears to be recycled at rates which are subject to hormonal regulation (18Butterworth M.B. Edinger R.S. Johnson J.P. Frizzell R.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 125: 81-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). ENaC activity is also regulated by proteolysis, some of which is related to post-translational processing within the protein secretory pathway and some of which appears to occur after apical membrane localization (18Butterworth M.B. Edinger R.S. Johnson J.P. Frizzell R.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 125: 81-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The role of the lipid environment in processing, delivery, or regulation of channel function remains unclear. To examine the role of lipid rafts in ENaC regulation we used a mammalian kidney cell line (MPKCCD14 cells, henceforth referred to as mCCD cells) and asked specifically whether endogenously expressed ENaC is present in lipid rafts and whether raft association is important for regulating its activity. We present data to show that ENaC is present in detergent-resistant and buoyant membranes in mCCD cells as well as in a membrane fraction prepared using techniques designed specifically to enrich for caveolin, a protein associated with lipid rafts. The role that raft localization may play in regulating ENaC expression is explored in the context of its colocalization with vesicular trafficking proteins. Our findings suggest that ENaC may utilize cholesterol-enriched membrane domains to traffic to the plasma membrane. Cell Culture and Reagents—mCCD cells were allowed to polarize after subculturing onto permeable filter supports (0.4-μm pore size, 0.33 cm2 surface area; Transwell, Corning Costar). Cells were grown on filters for at least 7 days in defined medium as described (18Butterworth M.B. Edinger R.S. Johnson J.P. Frizzell R.A. J. Gen.

Aldosterone was added at 1 μm for varying periods as described and in those experiments was grown in steroid-free media for 48 h prior to acute addition of aldosterone. Antibodies to α-, β-, and γ-ENaC subunits were rabbit polyclonal antibodies as previously described (18Butterworth M.B. Edinger R.S. Johnson J.P. Frizzell R.A. J. Gen.

Johnson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33541-33544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Rafts were also prepared in the absence of detergents on discontinuous sucrose gradients using the method of Song et al. (20Song K.S. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar) as described in detail (13Hill W.G. An B. Johnson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33541-33544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell lysates were scraped from filter supports into 2 ml of 500 mm sodium carbonate, pH 11, after washing three times with ice-cold PBS. Cells were lysed by passing through small bore needles and a postnuclear supernatant was isolated by low speed centrifugation. Samples were mixed with 90% sucrose in 25 mm MES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 6.5, and placed in a centrifuge tube. The sample was then overlaid with 4 ml of 35% and 4 ml of 5% sucrose before centrifugation at 190,000 × g for 18 h at 4 °C. Fractions (1 ml) were recovered, and the protein was extracted with chloroform/methanol (13Hill W.G. An B. Johnson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33541-33544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Total proteins from each fraction were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with specific antibodies as described (13Hill W.G. An B. Johnson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33541-33544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Isolation of Caveolin-enriched Membranes—Membranes were prepared according to the method of Smart et al. (21Smart E.J. Ying Y.S. Mineo C. Anderson R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10104-10108Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). In brief, a postnuclear supernatant (PNS) fraction was prepared from homogenized cells, loaded onto a 30% Percoll gradient (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ), centrifuged at 84,000 × g for 35 min; crude plasma membranes recovered and sonicated; made to 23% (v/v) Optiprep (Accurate Chemical and Scientific Corp., Westbury, NY), overlaid with a linear 20–10% Optiprep gradient and subjected to centrifugation at 52 000 × g for 95 min. The top five fractions were recovered, made to ∼20% Optiprep, overlaid with 5% Optiprep and centrifuged again at 52,000 × g for 95 min. Caveolin is enriched in fractions 2–3 of this final gradient. Na+ Current Measurements—Equivalent short circuit currents (Isc) were measured before and after the addition of 10 μm amiloride using an electrode voltage ohmmeter (EVOM) from World Precision Instruments. Current was calculated using the potential difference across the filter divided by the resistance normalized to surface area to obtain current readings in μA/cm2. The reported value is amiloride-sensitive current. Cells cultured on filter supports were mounted in modified Costar Ussing chambers, and the cultures were continuously short circuited with an automatic voltage clamp (Department of Bioengineering, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA). Transepithelial resistance was measured by periodically applying a 2.5-mV bipolar pulse and calculated using Ohm's law. The bathing Ringers solution was composed of 120 mm NaCl, 25 mm NaHCO3, 3.3 mm KH2PO4, 0.8 mm K2HPO4, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 1.2 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm glucose. Chambers were constantly gassed with a mixture of 95% O2/5% CO2 at 37 °C, which maintained the pH at 7.4. Amiloride (10 μm) was added to the apical cell surface at the end of each experiment. Biotinylation of Apical Membrane—CCD cells were washed with ice-cold PBS plus Mg2+ and Ca2+ with agitation on ice for 3 × 5 min to remove media. The apical membrane was biotinylated using 0.5 mg/ml S-S-biotin (Pierce) in borate buffer (85 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 15 mm Na2B4O7, pH 9) for 20 min. The basolateral surface was incubated in medium containing FBS to prevent biotinylation. The biotinylation was quenched by adding FBS-containing medium on the apical surface. Monolayers were then washed three times with ice-cold PBS with agitation on ice, and the cells were harvested. Cells were lysed in cell lysis buffer (0.4% DCA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm EGTA, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4) at room temperature for 10 min. Protein concentration of the post nuclear supernatant was determined, and 300 μg of protein was combined with streptavidin beads (Pierce) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Samples from the streptavidin beads were collected in 2× sample buffer containing 10% β-mercaptoethanol and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The protein was heated to 95 °C for 3 min and separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blot analysis with β-ENaC monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) and visualized using chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Transfection of Dominant Negative Caveolin Mutants into mCCD Cells—mCCD cells were seeded on 12-mm transwells (0.4-μm pore; Costar, Cambridge, MA) for 3–5 days prior to infection with recombinant adenovirus at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 250 for Cav1-eGFP. Adenoviral vectors were prepared by Cre-lox recombination (22Hardy S. Kitamura M. Harris-Stansil T. Dai Y. Phipps M.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1842-1849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in the University of Pittsburgh Viral Core under the direction of Dr. Paul Robbins. The cells were rinsed with calcium-free PBS containing 1 mm MgCl2 (PBS-Mg2+). Subsequently, individual transwells were incubated for 1 h at 37°C on 50-μl drops of PBS-Mg2+-containing virus, with an additional 150 μl of PBS-Mg2+/virus placed on the apical surface of the transwell. Samples were then returned to normal growth medium for 48 h before analysis. Cav3-DGV was subcloned into pcDNA3.1Hygro+ vector (Invitrogen) and transfected into mCCD cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as described (23Butterworth M.B. Frizzell R.A. Johnson J.P. Peters K.W. Edinger R.S. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2005; 289: F969-F977Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To determine whether ENaC subunits were present in Triton-insoluble membranes in mammalian epithelial cells, polarized mCCD cells were scraped from filters, lysed and then solubilized in cold Triton X-100 (1% v/v, 4 °C) for 30 min before pelleting by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min. Immunoblotting of both soluble (supernatant) and insoluble fractions for ENaC subunits demonstrated that a proportion of total cellular ENaC was detergent-insoluble, as had previously been shown for ENaC in A6 cells (13Hill W.G. An B. Johnson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33541-33544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). We next examined the distribution of ENaC in membranes separated on density gradients to determine whether sodium channel subunits could be found in membranes of high buoyancy prepared without detergent. This had been shown in A6 cells where our results suggested that aldosterone might alter the distribution of ENaC subunits between buoyant and higher density membranes (13Hill W.G. An B. Johnson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33541-33544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Cells were either stimulated with aldosterone (1 μm for 18 h, indicated by +) or left untreated (–) and were then lysed and membranes separated by density on sucrose gradients. Fractions from the gradients were chloroform/methanol-precipitated and then immunoblotted with antibodies to ENaC subunits, clathrin heavy chain protein (a non-raft marker) and caveolin-1, a marker of lipid rafts (Fig. 2). Low-density membranes which correspond to lipid rafts are found near the top of the gradient in fractions 4, 5, and 6 while non-raft markers are found at higher sucrose densities in fractions 8–12. The majority of caveolin-1 is found in fraction 5 while clathrin is entirely excluded from lipid raft fractions. Each of the ENaC subunits were found in raft fractions demonstrating that a proportion of ENaC resides within membranes with the buoyancy characteristics of lipid rafts or caveolae. Immunoblots with γ-ENaC antibody demonstrated both full-length (FL) and processed or cleaved (CL) subunits similar to what we (17Wang H. Traub L.M. Weixel K.M. Hawryluk M.J. Shah N. Edinger R.S. Perry C.J. Kester L. Butterworth M.B. Peters K.W. Kleyman T.R. Frizzell R.A. Johnson J.P. J. Biol.

Full-length and cleaved γ-ENaC subunits are found in both raft and non-raft fractions and their relative distribution is similar, suggesting that cleaved or processed forms of ENaC are not enriched in rafts. Quantitation of the distribution for unstimulated cells is shown in Fig. 3A and reveals no difference between cleaved and uncleaved. The antibody employed to detect α-ENaC in these studies did not detect a cleaved or processed form of this subunit.FIGURE 3Localization of full-length and 70-kDa γ-ENaC on sucrose density gradients and quantitation of ENaC subunits in rafts. A, full-length and 70-kDa forms of γ-ENaC were analyzed by densitometry. Data is expressed as % of total densitometry for each fraction of the gradient. B, membranes from mCCD cells grown on permeable supports were separated on sucrose density gradients as shown in Fig. 2. Samples were quantitated by densitometry for each subunit and the percent located in raft fractions (fractions 4–6) for each subunit is given. Data on γ-ENaC are for the 97-kDa subunit alone. n = 4–6 Western blots for each subunit.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The percentage of α-, β-, and γ-ENaC found in raft fractions are quantitated in Fig. 3B. This analysis revealed that a minority of the total cellular amount of each subunit appears in raft fractions, but there is some difference in the relative distribution. The quantitation demonstrates that 33.2% of cellular α-ENaC appears in raft fractions compared with 14.6% of β- and 17.5% of γ-ENaC, respectively. The difference between α- and β-ENaC distribution in raft fractions was statistically significant (p < 0.05, n = 4–7), while the difference between α- and γ-ENaC subunit distribution did not reach significance. Aldosterone-treated cells had higher total levels of ENaC (Fig. 2), but in contrast to our findings in A6 cells (13Hill W.G. An B. Johnson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33541-33544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), the distribution between membrane domains did not appear to be altered by hormone treatment. Quantitation by densitometry of the effect of chronic aldosterone stimulation (1 μm, 16 h) confirmed that hormone treatment did not appear to shift ENaC into a chemically different membrane domain and this is true for γ-ENaC subunits whether comparing the distribution of full-length, cleaved, or total γ subunits (Fig. 4). The error bars in Fig. 4 are sufficiently large however, that it is possible there were subtle hormone-mediated shifts in ENaC localization, which were not revealed by this analysis. A close comparison of the data for β-ENaC in Figs. 3B and 4 suggests there might be a difference between the two experiments, however, analyzing these data sets by Student's t test revealed no statistically significant difference. These results indicate that in CCD cells at least, hormonal exposure to aldosterone does not alter the relative distribution of ENaC subunits between raft and non-raft membranes. To further substantiate the presence of ENaC in rafts we used a second membrane isolation protocol specifically designed to isolate membranes enriched in caveolae (21Smart E.J. Ying Y.S. Mineo C. Anderson R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10104-10108Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). This technique employs a combination of Percoll and Optiprep gradients to isolate a membrane fraction which is 9.5 ± 1.8-fold enriched for caveolin-1 compared with total plasma membrane (26Yang N. Huang Y. Jiang J. Frank S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20898-20905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Percoll gradients were used to prepare crude membranes from a postnuclear supernatant, then light membranes were isolated from the top of a 10–20% Optiprep gradient (first 5 of 12 fractions) and finally those membranes were concentrated on a second discontinuous Optiprep gradient. Membranes in fractions 1–6 from the top of the final gradient were concentrated by pelleting at 100,000 × g for 30 min and then immunoblotted for ENaC and caveolin. Fig. 5 illustrates the presence of all three ENaC subunits in caveolin-1 positive fractions thereby confirming under different separation conditions that ENaC is present in membrane rafts. We also used this preparation to further examine the question of whether aldosterone treatment at earlier time courses might alter distribution of ENaC subunits within membrane domains as our data in A6 cells had suggested (13Hill W.G. An B. Johnson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33541-33544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Treatment of mCCD cells with 1 μm aldosterone for 4 h results in stimulation of ENaC activity without the increase in cellular ENaC subunit abundance noted with longer term treatment (19Edinger R.S. Yospin J. Perry C. Kleyman T.R. Johnson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9110-9117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The early aldosterone response is, at least partially, a trafficking phenomenon related to induction of SGK1 and the phosphorylation of Nedd 4–2 resulting in enhanced ENaC expression at the apical membrane prior to synthesis of new subunits (27Pearce D. Cell Physiol. Biochem. 2003; 13: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Samples were separated on sequential Optiprep gradients as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the most buoyant fractions are located in the first five lanes of the final discontinuous gradient, which is enriched in caveolin. Fig. 6A shows the distribution of α-, β-, and γ-ENaC in fractions 6–10 of the first Optiprep gradient. These fractions represent the heavy or denser membranes which remain after lighter membranes are removed for concentration on a subsequent gradient. It can be seen that aldosterone treatment has no effect on ENaC in these membranes. Fractions 1–5 from these same gradients are run once more on a discontinuous Optiprep gradient to concentrate caveolin and it can be seen in Fig. 6B that there is little difference in the amount of each subunit localizing to the caveolin-enriched membranes (2Hill W.G. Almasri E. Ruiz W.G. Apodaca G. Zeidel M.L. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2005; 289: C33-C41Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar and 3Zheng X. Bollinger Bollag W. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2003; 121: 1487-1495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Quantitation by densitometry revealed no statistically significant differences in ENaC distribution (Student's t test, n = 3). Therefore we observe no discernible alteration in the membrane domain distribution of ENaC with aldosterone either early or late in its course of action using two different gradient systems. In addition to regulation of ENaC by aldosterone, we have shown that stimulation of mCCD cells with forskolin results in an acute up-regulation of apical membrane ENaC expression and activity through an exocytic mechanism (18Butterworth M.B. Edinger R.S. Johnson J.P. Frizzell R.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 125: 81-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Because recent studies have suggested that cholesterol depletion with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (m-CD) may affect acute stimulation of ENaC in A6 cells (14Balut C. Steels P. Radu M. Ameloot M. Driessche W.V. Jans D. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2006; 290: C87-C94Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 28West A. Blazer-Yost B. Cell Physiol. Biochem. 2005; 16: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of forskolin stimulation on the distribution of ENaC subunits in raft and non-raft membranes from mCCD cells. Cells grown on filter supports were exposed to 10 μm forskolin from the basolateral side for 30 min, resulting in an increase in amiloride-sensitive Isc of 100%. Cells were harvested, lysed and membranes separated on sucrose gradients as described. As shown in Fig. 7, acute stimulation of ENaC activity by forskolin had no effect on the distribution of α-ENaC subunits between raft and non-raft fractions of the gradient. These results suggest that up-regulation of ENaC resulting from enhanced expression and trafficking of subunits to the apical membrane from intracellular compartments is not associated with major alterations in the membrane domains occupied by ENaC. A number of transporters appear to use lipid rafts and lipid raft localized t-SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors) and v-SNARE proteins as a means to direct their trafficking to the correct cellular compartment (29Ros-Baro A. Lopez-Iglesias C. Peiro S. Bellido D. Palacin M. Zorzano A. Camps M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12050-12055Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 3"

https://openalex.org/W2001190894,"Regulation of cell growth and apoptosis is one of the pleiotropic functions of annexin A1 (ANXA1). Although previous reports on the overexpression of ANXA1 in many human cancers and on growth suppression and/or induction of apoptosis by ANXA1 may indicate the tumor-suppressive nature of ANXA1, molecular mechanisms of the function of ANXA1 remain largely unknown. Here we provide evidence that ANXA1 mechanistically links the epidermal growth factor-triggered growth signal pathway with cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2), an initiator enzyme of the arachidonic acid cascade, through interaction with S100A11 in normal human keratinocytes (NHK). Ca2+-dependent binding of S100A11 to ANXA1 facilitated the binding of the latter to cPLA2, resulting in inhibition of cPLA2 activity, which is essential for the growth of NHK. On exposure of NHK to epidermal growth factor, ANXA1 was cleaved solely at Trp12, and this cleavage was executed by cathepsin D. In squamous cancer cells, this pathway was shown to be constitutively activated. The newly found mechanistic intersection may be a promising target for establishing new measures against human cancer and other cell growth disorders.

ANXA1 plays pleiotropic roles in various biological contexts, including membrane organization, membrane traffic, and regulation of intracellular Ca2+. Physiologically, it is involved in inflammation and at least partly mediates the function of glucocorticoid (1Gerke V. Moss S.E. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 331-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (1610) Google Scholar, 2Lim L.H. Pervaiz S. FASEB J. 2007; 21: 968-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 3Parente L. Solito E. Inflamm. Res. 2004; 53: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). ANXA1 is also relevant to regulation of cell growth and apoptosis. Reduced expression of ANXA1 has been observed in many different human malignancies, including esophageal cancer (4Hu N. Flaig M.J. Su H. Shou J.Z. Roth M.J. Li W.J. Wang C. Goldstein A.M. Li G.

BMC Cancer. 2004; 4: 8Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In addition, overexpression of ANXA1 in malignant tumor cells resulted in growth suppression and/or apoptosis (8Hsiang C.H. Tunoda T. Whang Y.E. Tyson D.R. Ornstein D.K. Prostate. 2006; 66: 1413-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Thus, ANXA1 may be regarded as a tumor suppressor gene (8Hsiang C.H. Tunoda T. Whang Y.E. Tyson D.R. Ornstein D.K. Prostate. 2006; 66: 1413-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Molecular mechanisms of the tumor-suppressive function of ANXA1, however, remain largely unknown.The fact that ANXA1 inhibits the activity of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2; 3) could be a clue for a better understanding of the function of ANXA1 in cell growth regulation, because cPLA2 is an initiator enzyme of the arachidonic acid cascade and thus plays a critical role in the regulation of growth of many different types of cells (9Flower R.J. Blackwell G.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1976; 25: 285-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 10Nakanishi M. Rosenberg D.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1761: 1335-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Inhibition of cPLA2 activity is thought to be because of direct binding of ANXA1 to cPLA2 (11Kim K.M. Kim D.K. Park Y.M. Kim C.K. Na D.S. FEBS Lett. 1994; 343: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 12Croxtall J.D. Choudhury Q. Tokumoto H. Flower R.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 465-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) rather than to sequestering of substrate phospholipids by the binding of ANXA1 to them (13Davidson F.F. Dennis E.A. Powell M. Glenney Jr., J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1698-1705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Haigler H.T. Schlaepfer D.D. Burgess W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6921-6930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is also known that ANXA1 is phosphorylated by the ligand-activated EGF receptor at Tyr21 (14Haigler H.T. Schlaepfer D.D. Burgess W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6921-6930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Pepinsky R.B. Sinclair L.K. Nature. 1986; 321: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) and that phosphorylated ANXA1 becomes labile to tryptic cleavage at an N-terminal site(s) in vitro (14Haigler H.T. Schlaepfer D.D. Burgess W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6921-6930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the functional significance of the phosphorylation and intracellular cleavage of ANXA1 for cell growth induced by EGF and the possible mechanistic link to the interaction between ANXA1 and cPLA2 are not well understood.On the other hand, ANXA1 is known to bind another Ca2+-binding protein, S100A11, via the N terminus of ANXA1 and the C terminus of S100A11 (16Mailliard W.S. Haigler H.T. Schlaepfer D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 719-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 17Seemann J. Weber K. Gerke V. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Although a model for membrane rearrangement by the ANXA1-S100A11 complex has been proposed (1Gerke V. Moss S.E. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 331-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (1610) Google Scholar), the biological relevance and action mechanism of the complex formation remain to be clarified. We recently demonstrated that S100A11 is involved in TGFβ-triggered signaling (18Sakaguchi M. Miyazaki M. Sonegawa H. Kashiwagi M. Ohba M. Kuroki T. Namba M. Huh N.H. J.

On exposure of normal human keratinocytes (NHK) to TGFβ, S100A11 was phosphorylated by protein kinase Cα and transferred to the nucleus, resulting in induction of p21WAF1. The growth inhibition was almost completely mitigated when this pathway was functionally blocked. The S100A11-mediated pathway was deteriorated in squamous carcinoma cell lines that are resistant to TGFβ (20Sonegawa H. Nukui T. Li D.W. Takaishi M. Sakaguchi M. Huh N.H. J. Mol. Med. 2007; 85: 753-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). These results indicate that, in addition to the well characterized Smad-mediated pathway, the S100A11-mediated pathway is involved in and essential for the growth inhibition of NHK by TGFβ. The newly found pathway, however, does not involve the interaction of S100A11 with ANXA1.In this study, we addressed the questions of whether and how the three observations described above, i.e. EGF-triggered phosphorylation and cleavage of ANXA1, inhibition of cPLA2 by ANXA1, and binding of ANXA1 to S100A11, are mechanistically linked.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells—NHK (KURABO, Osaka, Japan) were cultured in EpiLife medium (Cascade Biologics, Portland, OR) with the growth supplement HKGS (Cascade Biologics). A human vulvar epidermoid carcinoma cell line, A431, and human cutaneous squamous carcinoma cell lines, BSCC-93 and DJM-1, were purchased from ATCC. A431 was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 4 mm/liter glutamate and 4.5 g/liter glucose. BSCC-93 and DJM-1 were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Both media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. NHK of passage 2–4 were used throughout the experiments. For monitoring DNA synthesis, tritiated thymidine (1 μCi/ml; American Radiolabeled Chemicals, St. Louis, MO) was added to the cultures 1 h before harvest.Materials—An EGF receptor inhibitor (AG1478), arachidonyltrifluoromethyl ketone, and an synthetic cPLA2α inhibitor were purchased from Calbiochem. Recombinant human EGF and TGFβ were purchased from PeproTech EC (London, UK) and Sigma, respectively.Plasmid Constructs and Preparation of Recombinant Proteins—pGEX vectors (GE Healthcare) were used to produce glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins of full-length human S100A11 and ANXA1 in Escherichia coli. cDNAs of phosphorylation-mimic mutants of S100A11 were obtained by replacing either Thr10 (P-N) or Ser94 (P-C) or both sites (P-NC) with Asp by conventional site-directed mutagenesis. The fused proteins were purified using a Sephadex 4B column (GE Healthcare) under conventional conditions. When necessary, GST was released by cleaving with PreScission protease (GE Healthcare) and removed from the final preparations using a Sephadex 4B column.Adenovirus Constructs—Adenovirus constructs were prepared using Adeno-X Expression System 2 (Clontech) under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer. S100A11 and its variants were made as a fusion protein of nuclear export signal-GFP-S100A11 to avoid the growth-interfering function of S100A11 in nuclei (19Sakaguchi M. Sonegawa H. Nukui T. Sakaguchi Y. Miyazaki M. Namba M. Huh N.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13921-13926Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). An S100A11 variant lacking Ca2+-binding capacity (ΔCa; 21Sakaguchi M. Miyazaki M. Takaishi M. Sakaguchi Y. Makino E. Kataoka N. Yamada H. Namba M. Huh N.H. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 825-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) was produced by mutating Asp at the 28, 68, 72, and 76 sites and Glu at the 38 and 79 sites to Ser. ANXA1 and its variants were made as a fusion protein of Ds-Red-ANXA1-GFP. An ANXA1 variant lacking the phosphorylation site of Tyr21 (ΔP) and an N-terminal truncated form (ΔN) were made by replacing with Phe and by deleting N-terminal 39 amino acids, respectively, using conventional site-directed mutagenesis.Immunological Analyses—Western blot analysis and immunoprecipitation were performed under conventional conditions. To get optimal pictures, we usually repeated Western blotting three times for each set of samples. The following antibodies were used: rabbit anti-human S100A11 antibody (raised in our laboratory 21); rabbit anti-human annexin A1 antibody (raised in our laboratory; confirmed to specifically recognize native and denatured human ANXA1); mouse anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (clone PY20; Chemicon, Temecula, CA); mouse anti-human cPLA2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); mouse anti-EGF receptor antibody (Lab Vision, Fremont, CA); goat anti-human cathepsin B antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); goat anti-human cathepsin D antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); goat anti-cathepsin L antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); and mouse anti-human tubulin antibody (Sigma). The second antibody used was horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Cell Signaling Technology). Protein bands were visualized by a chemiluminescence system (ECL Plus, GE Healthcare).RNA Interference and Protein Transduction—Validated small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) for human cathepsins B (ID 105579), D (ID 105581 and ID 4180), and L (ID 105042) and control siRNA (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) were purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX). Transfection of siRNA was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cathepsin D (Sigma) was labeled with Cy3 using a FluoroLink-Ab Cy3 labeling kit (GE Healthcare) and transduced into cells using a Chariot kit (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA).Electromobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—EMSA was performed as described previously (21Sakaguchi M. Miyazaki M. Takaishi M. Sakaguchi Y. Makino E. Kataoka N. Yamada H. Namba M. Huh N.H. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 825-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 32P-labeled Myc/Max consensus DNA probe (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was mixed with 2 μg of crude nuclear extracts in a reaction mixture (20 μl) containing 60 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 μgof poly(dI-dC), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, and 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9. DNA-protein complexes were then separated by electrophoresis in a 5% polyacrylamide gel under nondenaturing conditions.Affinity Column Chromatography with ANXA1 N-terminal Peptide—Human ANXA1 N-terminal peptide (AMVSEFLK-QAWFIENEEQ) was covalently conjugated to Tresyl beads (TOYOPEAL AF-Tresyl-650 M; Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan). Cell extracts prepared with either neutral (0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) or acidic buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm citric acid, pH 4.5) were used, and eluates with the same buffers were analyzed by electrophoresis.Mass Spectrometry—Protein bands visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining were treated with a trypsin profile IGD kit (Sigma) and analyzed using an Agilent 1100 LC/MSD Trap XCT Ultra series system with an ionizing system of HPLC-Chip-MS (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Data base searching and identification of proteins were carried out by a software Spectrum Mill MS Proteomics Workbench (version Rev A. 03. 02.060b/Agilent Technologies) and accessing to the NCBInr public data bases.Acquisition and Processing of Images—For fluorescence-labeled cells, images were acquired by a laser-scanning microscope (type, Axioplan 2; objective lens, Plan-Apochromat63 × 1.4 oil DC and Plan-Neofluar40x/0.75; Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) and processed using Adobe Photoshop 6.0.RESULTSInteraction of S100A11, ANXA1, and cPLA2 and Its Effect on the Growth of NHK—First, we confirmed binding between S100A11 and ANXA1. Recombinant S100A11 was pulled down by GST-ANXA1 in vitro (Fig. 1A). The binding appears Ca2+-dependent because the addition of EGTA or the use of an S100A11 variant lacking Ca2+-binding capacity (ΔCa) largely reduced the amount of S100A11 precipitated with GST-ANXA1.Phosphorylation-mimic variants of S100A11 at two potential sites, i.e. Thr10 and Ser94 (18Sakaguchi M. Miyazaki M. Sonegawa H. Kashiwagi M. Ohba M. Kuroki T. Namba M. Huh N.H. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 979-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), showed a binding mode similar to that of the wild-type protein. Endogenous S100A11 and cPLA2 were pulled down by GST-ANXA1 added to the cell extracts (supplemental Fig. S1). Recombinant S100A11 added to the incubation mixture dose-dependently increased the amount of cPLA2 bound to and hence recovered by GST-ANXA1, indicating that the formation of ANXA1-S100A11 complex facilitates the binding of ANXA1 to cPLA2. Under similar conditions, GST-S100A11 pulled down endogenous ANXA1 and cPLA2 (data not shown). Immunoprecipitation of endogenous ANXA1 in resting NHK co-precipitated S100A11 and cPLA2 (Fig. 1B and 2A, left-hand columns). Overexpression of wild-type S100A11 using an adenovirus vector slightly increased the co-precipitable cPLA2 (Fig. 1B). ΔCa S100A11 abrogated even the binding of endogenous S100A11 to ANXA1 and cPLA2, thus functioning as a dominant negative agent (supplemental Fig. S2). Phosphorylation-mimic S100A11 variants behaved in a manner similar to that of the wild type in cells.FIGURE 2Cleavage of ANXA1 by EGF stimulation abrogates its binding capacity to S100A11 and cPLA2. A, cleavage of ANXA1 and loss of binding capacity of ANXA1 to S100A11 and cPLA2 by EGF. NHK were cultivated with 10 ng/ml EGF and analyzed by Western blotting with or without prior immunoprecipitation with an antibody against ANXA1. P-Y, an antibody against phosphotyrosine. Only a shifted band region is shown for EMSA using a Myc probe as an indicator for cell growth. B, ANXA1 was purified using an affinity column with anti-ANXA1 antibody from extracts of NHK cultivated with 10 ng/ml EGF in HKGS-free EpiLife medium and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) after electrophoresis. Open arrowhead, intact ANXA1; closed arro-w head, cleaved ANXA1. C, NHK were infected with an adenovirus vector carrying DR-ANXA1-GFP. Thirty six hours later, 10 ng/ml EGF was added, and cells were observed after further incubation for 6 h. Two independent experiments gave rise to similar results. D, effect of overexpression of S100A11 and ANXA1 on EGF-induced ANXA1 cleavage. NHK were treated in a similar manner to that described in C. Each cell extract was analyzed by Western blotting with or without prior immunoprecipitation. Only a region of shifted bands is shown for EMSA using a Myc probe.

Intracellular cPLA2 activity was monitored by determining radioactivity released from cells labeled with [3H]arachidonic acid in advance. Treatment of NHK with EGF resulted in marked activation of cPLA2 (Fig. 1C, upper panel). Overexpression of wild-type S100A11 and ANXA1 significantly suppressed the activation. NHK expressing the ΔCa S100A11 variant showed a higher level of cPLA2 activity than that of the control cells, indicating a dominant negative effect of ΔCa S100A11 on endogenous S100A11 with respect not only to binding to ANXA1 (Fig. 1B) but also to inhibition of cPLA2 activity. A truncated form of ANXA1 lacking the N-terminal 39 amino acids (ΔN) lost the capacity to inhibit cPLA2 as expected from the lack of binding to S100A11 (Fig. 1C, upper panel). In contrast, overexpression of a phosphorylation site mutant of ANXA1 (ΔP: Tyr21 to Phe21) inhibited cPLA2 activity even to a higher extent than that in the case of the wild type.Growth of NHK was shown to largely depend on the arachidonic acid cascade. Addition of cPLA2 inhibitors, arachidonyltrifluoromethyl ketone and an synthetic cPLA2α inhibitor (Calbiochem), abrogated DNA synthesis induced by EGF, and this abrogation was canceled by adding arachidonic acid to the medium (supplemental Fig. S3). cPLA2 is an enzyme triggering the arachidonic cascade (9Flower R.J. Blackwell G.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1976; 25: 285-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar), and arachidonic acid was reported to play a critical role in growth of mouse epidermal keratinocytes (22Lo H.H. Teichmann P. Furstenberger G. Gimenez-Conti I. Fischer S.M. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4624-4631PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of cPLA2 alone stimulated DNA synthesis, which was blocked by the cPLA2 inhibitor (supplemental Fig. S4). DNA synthesis of NHK overexpressed with the various variants of S100A11 and ANXA1 was strongly correlated with the activity of cPLA2 except for the cells with ΔCa S100A11 (Fig. 1C, lower panel), and this was probably due to saturation of cPLA2 activity. These results indicate that Ca2+-dependent formation of the ANXA1-S100A11 complex greatly facilitates the binding of ANXA1 to cPLA2 and that ANXA1 efficiently inhibits cPLA2 activity only when complexed with S100A11.Cleavage of ANXA1 on Exposure of NHK to EGF and Resulting Abrogation of Its Binding to S100A11 and cPLA2—When NHK were exposed to EGF, a fast migrating ANXA1 appeared depending on time (Fig. 2A). No change was observed in amounts and electromobility of S100A11 and cPLA2. In resting NHK, ANXA1 was not phosphorylated, and immunoprecipitation of ANXA1 pulled down S100A11 as well as cPLA2. On exposure of NHK to EGF, phosphotyrosine was detected in both forms of ANXA1. As expected from the fact that ANXA1 binds to S100A11 at its N-terminal region (16Mailliard W.S. Haigler H.T. Schlaepfer D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 719-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), the truncation of ANXA1 was associated with a decrease in the amounts of S100A11 and cPLA2 pulled down by anti-ANXA1 antibody. The two forms of ANXA1 in EGF-treated NHK were immunoprecipitated and separated by electrophoresis (Fig. 2B). Conventional automated amino acid sequencing failed to reveal the protein recovered from the upper band probably because of the N-terminal capping. The protein was identified to be ANXA1 by tandem mass spectrometry. The N-terminal sequence of the lower band was determined to be FIENE, indicating that ANXA1 was cleaved solely at the C-terminal side of Trp12 in NHK on exposure to EGF in vivo. Cleavage of ANXA1 induced by EGF was also confirmed visually by expressing a fusion protein of Ds-Red, ANXA1, and GFP (Fig. 2C). Intracellular localization of the fusion protein, i.e. preferential accumulation on the cell membrane with diffuse distribution in the cytoplasm, was similar to that of endogenous ANXA1 (not shown) in accordance with a report by Radke et al. (23Radke S. Austermann J. Russo-Marie F. Gerke V. Rescher U. FEBS Lett. 2004; 578: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). On exposure of NHK to EGF, the signal from Ds-Red with the N-terminal portion segregated from the signal from GFP fused to the bulk of ANXA1.To further investigate the interaction between S100A11 and ANXA1 in relation to binding to cPLA2, we prepared a series of adenovirus constructs carrying various variants of S100A11 and ANXA1 (see “Experimental Procedures”). NHK were infected with both S100A11 and ANXA1 adenoviruses and analyzed by Western blotting with or without prior immunoprecipitation (Figs. 1B and 2D). In NHK not treated with EGF, overexpression of wild-type S100A11 or/and ANXA1 enhanced their binding to cPLA2, and overexpression of ΔCa S100A11 functioned as a dominant negative agent for endogenous S100A11. On exposure to EGF, exogenous ANXA1 was also cleaved. This cleavage was suppressed by concomitant expression of wild-type S100A11, probably because the complex formation conferred ANXA1 resistance to proteolysis induced by EGF. Phosphorylation-mimic S100A11 variants showed characteristics similar to those of wild-type S100A11 (Fig. 1C). ΔP ANXA1 was never cleaved, indicating that phosphorylation of ANXA1 at Tyr21 is a prerequisite for subsequent cleavage. These results indicate that on exposure of NHK to EGF, ANXA1 is phosphorylated at Tyr21 and eventually cleaved at Trp12 and that cleaved ANXA1 loses its binding capacity to S100A11 and hence to cPLA2, resulting in abrogation of the inhibition of cPLA2 activity. It should be noted that this mechanism is in accordance with the results of cell growth monitored by [3H]thymidine incorporation (Fig. 1C) or by electromobility shift assay (EMSA) using a c-Myc probe (Fig. 2D, bottom).Identification of a Protease for ANXA1 Cleavage as Cathepsin D—To identify a protease(s) responsible for the EGF-induced cleavage of ANXA1, we screened proteins binding to the N-terminal peptide covering the cleavage site of ANXA1. A band with a molecular mass of ∼30 kDa showing a differential binding between the control and N-terminal peptide columns was identified (Fig. 3A). Tandem mass spectrometry resulted in robust identification of the protein as human cathepsin D. When cathepsin D was depleted using siRNA, cleavage of ANXA1 induced by EGF was completely inhibited (Fig. 3B). Inhibition of the cleavage of ANXA1 resulted in recovery of the binding capacity of ANXA1 to S100A11 and cPLA2 as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot analysis. The function to cleave ANXA1 appears to be specific to cathepsin D, because down-regulation of cathepsin B or L showed no effect (Fig. 3C). Inhibition of ANXA1 cleavage resulted in growth inhibition as monitored by EMSA using a c-Myc probe (Fig. 3C, bottom). Blocking of EGF-induced truncation of ANXA1 by depletion of cathepsin D using siRNA was canceled by transducing exogenous cathepsin D protein (Fig. 3D). siRNAs targeted to two different sites of cathepsin D showed the same effect.FIGURE 3Identification of protease responsible for EGF-induced cleavage of ANXA1 as cathepsin D.

Addition of either agent overrides growth of NHK supported by EGF as confirmed in an experiment for which results are shown in Fig. 4A. When NHK were cultured in a medium with 1.5 mm Ca2+, EGF-induced phosphorylation and subsequent cleavage of ANXA1 were completely blocked (Fig. 4B). High Ca2+ induced phosphorylation of S100A11, which was not affected by EGF (supplemental Fig. S5). Phosphorylation of S100A11 at Thr10 is a triggering event for growth suppression of NHK (21Sakaguchi M. Miyazaki M. Takaishi M. Sakaguchi Y. Makino E. Kataoka N. Yamada H. Namba M. Huh N.H. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 825-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Increased amounts of S100A11 and cPLA2 were recovered by immunoprecipitation using an anti-ANXA1 antibody, indicating that high Ca2+ facilitates more efficient formation of S100A11-ANXA1 complex (Fig. 4C) and hence inhibits liberation and reactivation of cPLA2 by EGF. Intracellular Ca2+ concentration increased in NHK exposed to high Ca2+ but not in those exposed to TGFβ (data not shown). In TGFβ-treated NHK, the phosphorylation, cleavage, and binding mode of ANXA1 were similar to those in the control cells (Fig. 4, B and C). However, the amount of cPLA2 protein decreased depending on time, and a reduced level of cPLA2 mRNA was specifically observed in NHK treated with TGFβ (supplemental Fig. S6).FIGURE 4Effect of co-treatment with EGF and either Ca2+ or TGFβ. A, abrogation of EGF-induced growth stimulation of NHK by Ca2+ or TGFβ. NHK were treated under conditions similar to those described in the legend for Fig. 1C. Ca2+ (1.5 mm) and TGFβ (1 ng/ml) were added simultaneously with EGF (10 ng/ml). Two independent experiments were performed, giving rise to similar results. Standard deviations were obtained from triplicate determinations.

Optical observations from the New Horizons spacecraft have identified lightning at high latitudes above Jupiter up to 80 degrees N and 74 degrees S. Lightning rates and optical powers were similar at each pole, and the mean optical flux is comparable to that at nonpolar latitudes, which is consistent with the notion that internal heat is the main driver of convection. Both near-infrared and ground-based 5-micrometer thermal imagery reveal that cloud cover has thinned substantially since the 2000 Cassini flyby, particularly in the turbulent wake of the Great Red Spot and in the southern half of the equatorial region, demonstrating that vertical dynamical processes are time-varying on seasonal scales at mid- and low latitudes on Jupiter."
https://openalex.org/W1965497395,"When the solar wind hits Jupiter's magnetic field, it creates a long magnetotail trailing behind the planet that channels material out of the Jupiter system. The New Horizons spacecraft traversed the length of the jovian magnetotail to >2500 jovian radii (RJ; 1 RJ identical with 71,400 kilometers), observing a high-temperature, multispecies population of energetic particles. Velocity dispersions, anisotropies, and compositional variation seen in the deep-tail (greater, similar 500 RJ) with a approximately 3-day periodicity are similar to variations seen closer to Jupiter in Galileo data. The signatures suggest plasma streaming away from the planet and injection sites in the near-tail region (approximately 200 to 400 RJ) that could be related to magnetic reconnection events. The tail structure remains coherent at least until it reaches the magnetosheath at 1655 RJ."

Retrieved extinction profiles are consistent with condensed methane in clouds at an altitude near 30 kilometers and concomitant methane drizzle below. The moisture encompasses the equatorial region over Titan's brightest continent, Xanadu. Diurnal temperature gradients that cause variations in methane relative humidity, winds, and topography may each be a contributing factor to the condensation mechanism.

https://openalex.org/W1965487860,"Slc11a1 (formerly Nramp1) is a proton/divalent cation transporter that regulates cation homeostasis in macrophages. Slc11a2 mediates divalent cation uptake via the gut and delivery into cells. The mode of action of the two transporters remains controversial. Heterologous expression in frog oocytes shows Slc11a2 is a symporter, whereas Slc11a1 is an antiporter fluxing divalent cations against the proton gradient. This explains why Slc11a2, but not Slc11a1, can complement EGTA sensitivity in smf1Delta/smf2Delta/smf3Delta yeast. However, some studies of transport in mammalian cells suggest Slc11a1 is a symporter. We now demonstrate that Slc11a1, but not Slc11a2, complements a divalent cation stress phenotype in bsd2Delta/rer1Delta yeast. This is the first description of a yeast complementation assay for Slc11a1 function. Given the prior demonstration in frog oocytes that Slc11a1 acts as an antiporter, the most plausible interpretation of the data is that Slc11a1 is rescuing bsd2Delta/rer1Delta yeast by exporting divalent cations. Chimaeras define the N terminus, and a segment of the protein core preceding transmembrane domain 9 through transmembrane domain 12, as important in rescuing the divalent cation stress phenotype. EGTA sensitivity and divalent cation stress phenotypes in yeast expressing Slc11a orthologues show that symport activity is ancestral. Molecular changes that mediate rescue of the divalent cation stress phenotype post-date frogs and co-evolved with Slc11a1 orthologues that regulate divalent cation homeostasis in macrophages and resistance to infection in chickens and mammals."

F0F1-ATPase/synthase (F0F1) catalyzes ATP synthesis via coupling of the proton flow driven by the electrochemical gradient of protons or sodium. F0F1 consists of two rotary molecular motors: a water-soluble, ATP-driven F1 motor and a membrane-embedded, H+- or Na+-driven F0 motor. These molecular motors are connected together to couple ATP synthesis/hydrolysis and ion flow (1Boyer P.D. Annu. Rev.

The conformation that results in the inhibition of ATPase exists in an extended state, in which the C-terminal helical domain of the ϵ subunit unfolds to run parallel to the γ subunit. The conformation in which ATPase is active is known as the folded state and is characterized by C-terminal α helices folded into a hairpin configuration. The conformational change of the ϵ subunit is controlled by the concentration of both ATP and ADP as well as the membrane potential (16Kato-Yamada Y. Yoshida M. Hisabori T. J. Biol.

The isolated ϵ subunit of F1 from the thermophilic Bacillus strain PS3 (TF1) 2The abbreviations used are: TF1F1-ATPase from thermophilic Bacillus PS3BF1F1-ATPase from B. subtilis;EF1, F1-ATPase from E. coliIC3-PE-maleimideN-ethyl-N′-{5-[N″-(2-maleimidoethyl)pyperazinocarbonyl]pentyl} indocarbocyanineWTwild typeTES2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acidAMP-PNP5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate was recently found to bind ATP (20Kato-Yamada Y. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36013-36016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Binding was so specific that GTP and ADP failed to form a complex with the ϵ subunit, as assayed by gel filtration. These results led to the suggestion that the ϵ subunit is both a regulator and sensor of cellular ATP concentration. ATP binding was also observed with the ϵ subunits of F1-ATPases from Bacillus subtilis (21Kato-Yamada Y. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 6875-6878Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and Escherichia coli (22Yagi H. Kajiwara N. Tanaka H. Tsukihara T. Kato-Yamada Y. Yoshida M. Akutsu H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 11233-11238Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). X-ray crystallographic analysis revealed that ATP is bound to the ϵ subunit in the folded state (22Yagi H. Kajiwara N.

As the ATP binding site consists of residues from the N-terminal domain and the first and second α helices of the C-terminal domain, ATP may bind to the ϵ subunit alone in the folded state. An NMR study revealed that in the absence of ATP, the ϵ subunit adopts a different conformation. ATP may stabilize the folded conformation of the ϵ subunit (22Yagi H. Kajiwara N. Tanaka H.

ATP binding was also observed with the ϵ subunit in the γϵ subcomplex, indicating that ATP binding to the ϵ subunit can occur in ATP synthase, in which it may play a regulatory role (23Iizuka S. Kato S. Yoshida M. Kato-Yamada Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 349: 1368-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar).

Several mutants with impaired ATP binding were further reconstituted with α3β3γ, and the ATPase activities of these α3β3γϵ complexes were measured. The results clearly show that ATP binding to the ϵ subunit affects the regulation of ATPase activity. Materials—Wild-type and αK175A/T176A mutant (noncatalytic site-deficient mutant, ΔNC) 3As noted in Ref. 26Ono S. Hara K.Y. Hirao J. Matsui T. Noji H. Yoshida M. Muneyuki E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1607: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, αK175A/T176A mutations are enough to suppress the nucleotide binding to the noncatalytic site. α3β3γ complexes of TF1 were prepared as described previously (24Matsui T.

An expression plasmid for a mutant α3β3γ complex was prepared containing KT/AA substitutions in Walker A motifs (27Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4257) Google Scholar) in both the α and β subunits (αK175A/T176A and βK164A/T165A, noncatalytic and catalytic site-deficient mutants, ΔNC/ΔC); a DNA fragment containing the βK164A/T165A mutations was prepared using the overlap extension PCR method (28Higuchi R.

A 900-bp fragment containing mutations was treated with restriction enzymes AgeI and MunI, and the resulting 624-bp fragment was purified and directly transferred to the respective sites of an expression plasmid for the ΔNC (αK175A/T176A) mutant α3β3γ complex. The mutant α3β3γ complex was purified in the same way as the wild-type complex. The wild-type and S48C/N125C mutant (ϵNCX, a mutant ϵ subunit of TF1 in which N- and C-terminal domains can be cross-linked) ϵ subunits were prepared as previously described (16Kato-Yamada Y. Yoshida M. Hisabori T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35746-35750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 30Hisabori T. Kato Y. Motohashi K. Kroth-Pancic P. Strotmann H. Amano T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1158-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The expression plasmids for the mutant ϵ subunits were prepared by the overlap extension PCR method or mega-primer PCR method (31Landt O. Grunert H.P. Hahn U. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 96: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar) applied to the pET21/TF1-ϵ (wild-type) plasmid (20Kato-Yamada Y. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36013-36016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The Q107C mutation for fluorescent labeling was introduced by the mega-primer PCR method applied to the expression plasmid for the mutants deficient in ATP binding. Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Except for the E83A and E83A/Q107C mutants, the ϵ subunits were prepared as described previously (16Kato-Yamada Y. Yoshida M. Hisabori T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35746-35750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 30Hisabori T. Kato Y. Motohashi K. Kroth-Pancic P. Strotmann H. Amano T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1158-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It was noticed that the use of a large sized butyl-TOYOPEARL column resulted in a reduced amount of bound ATP in the ϵ subunit preparation, reaching <0.05 mol/mol (23Iizuka S. Kato S. Yoshida M. Kato-Yamada Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 349: 1368-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The E83A mutant ϵ subunit was prepared as follows. Cells were suspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8) and 1 mm EDTA (buffer A) and disrupted by French press. Cell lysate was ultracentrifuged at 220,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was applied to a DEAE-TOYOPEARL column equilibrated with the same buffer. As the mutant ϵ subunit was adsorbed on the column, a 0–100 mm linear gradient of NaCl was applied, and the fractions containing ϵ subunit were pooled. Solid ammonium sulfate was added to the sample to 20% saturation, and the sample was applied to a phenyl-TOYOPEARL column equilibrated with buffer A containing a 25% saturated concentration of ammonium sulfate. Proteins were eluted with a 25 to 0% saturation linear gradient of ammonium sulfate. For purification of the E83A/Q107C mutant, 1 mm dithiothreitol was included in all buffers. The α3β3γϵ complex was prepared by mixing the purified α3β3γ complex and ϵ subunit to a molar ratio of 1:10 (10Kato Y. Matsui T. Tanaka N. Muneyuki E. Hisabori T. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24906-24912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Excess ϵ subunit was not removed for the ATPase measurements. For the experiments in Fig. 6, excess ϵ subunit was removed from the α3β3γϵ complex by three successive ultrafiltrations (100-kDa cutoff) with an Amicon centrifugal filter device as described previously (16Kato-Yamada Y. Yoshida M. Hisabori T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35746-35750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Formation of the α3β3γϵ complex was confirmed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis without a denaturing reagent. ATP Binding Assay—ATP binding assay by gel-filtration chromatography on a Sephadex G25F column (GE Healthcare) was performed as reported previously in a buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8) and 100 mm KCl at room temperature (25 °C) (20Kato-Yamada Y. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36013-36016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). ATP binding assay by fluorescence was performed as described above (19Iino R. Murakami T. Iizuka S. Kato-Yamada Y. Suzuki T. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40130-40134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) except that N-ethyl-N′-{5-[N″-(2-maleimidoethyl)piperazinocarbonyl]pentyl}indocarbocyanine (IC3-PE-maleimide; Dojin) was used instead of Cy3-maleimide. Labeling was performed in 50 mm TES-NaOH (pH 7) and 100 mm NaCl with a protein-to-dye ratio of 1:2–7. Excess dye was removed with a Bio-Gel P6 centrifuge column (Bio-Rad). The assay mixture contained 50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 100 mm KCl, and 10 mm MgCl2. Fluorescently labeled ϵ subunit (100 nm) was incubated in the assay mixture, and the changes in fluorescence were measured upon addition of ATP. The measurements were performed at 25 °C with an FP-6500 fluorescent spectrometer (JASCO). Excitation and emission wavelengths were 522 and 559 nm, respectively. Slit widths for excitation and emission were 3 nm. Fluorescent change was corrected for corresponding measurement without ATP and plotted against ATP concentration. ATPase Assay—ATPase activity was measured spectrophotometrically with an NADH-coupled ATP-regenerating system at 25 °C (32Stiggal D.L. Galante Y.M. Hatefi Y. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 55: 308-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The assay mixture consisted of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 100 mm KCl, 2.5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm NADH, 50 μg/ml pyruvate kinase, 50 μg/ml lactate dehydrogenase, and the indicated concentration of ATP-Mg. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 10 nm TF1 α3β3γϵ complex to the assay mixture, and changes in absorbance at 340 nm were measured in a V-550 or V-530 spectrophotometer (JASCO). Velocity measurements were taken at 540–1140 s after the start of the reactions. One unit of ATPase activity was defined as that producing 1 μmol of ADP/min. Detection of Conformation of the ϵ Subunit—The detection of a conformational change in the ϵ subunit corresponding to the formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond was performed in essentially the same way as described previously (16Kato-Yamada Y. Yoshida M. Hisabori T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35746-35750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Reduced ΔNC/ΔC-α3β3γϵNCX and ΔNC-α3β3γϵNCX complexes were incubated with or without 2 mm ATP-Mg. After 10 min, 0, 10, 20, or 50 μm CuCl2 was added, and the sample was incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The cross-linking reaction was quenched by addition of 10 mm EDTA. IC3-PE-maleimide (500 μm) and 0.1% SDS were then added to the mixture and incubated for 10 min at room temperature to label cysteine residues that had not formed a disulfide bond. The reaction was quenched by the addition of 12 mm N-ethylmaleimide. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE without reducing reagent (15% polyacrylamide). The fluorescent image was taken by a Typhoon 9210 image analyzer (GE Healthcare) with a green laser (532 nm) and an appropriate filter set. The gel was then stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, and the image was recorded with a GT-9800F flatbed scanner (Epson). As judged by the gel-filtration analysis, no difference in ATP binding was observed between the mutant ϵNCX subunit and the wild-type (data not shown). Re-inactivation Assay—Re-inactivation of the α3β3γϵ complex by lowering the ATP concentration was measured as follows. The α3β3γϵ complex was incubated with 4 mm ATP-Mg in a buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 100 mm KCl, and 2 mm MgCl2 at 25 °C for more than 10 min. Bovine serum albumin (0.1 mg/ml) was included in the control measurement, which was carried out with the α3β3γ complex. Five μl of the mixture was then added to 1 ml of ATPase assay mixture without ATP in a quartz cuvette to give a final concentration of ATP at 20 μm. Other Methods—Protein concentrations of the ϵ subunits were determined by the method of Bradford (33Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216428) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard and corrected by multiplying by a factor of 0.54 according to the results of amino acid quantification (20Kato-Yamada Y. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36013-36016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Concentrations of α3β3γ or α3β3γϵ complexes were determined by measuring UV absorption spectra using A280 = 0.45 at 1 mg/ml (25Matsui T. Muneyuki E. Honda M. Allison W.S. Dou C. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8215-8221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Chemicals were of the highest grades available. Altered ATP Binding to the Mutant ϵ Subunits—To obtain ϵ subunit mutants that showed altered ATP binding, alanine-based substitutions were carried out (highlighted in Fig. 1A) for the following reasons: 1) These are the basic or acidic residues present in the C-terminal domain that are different in TF1 and B. subtilis F1-ATPase (BF1). Although ATP binding to the ϵ subunit of BF1 was observed, the affinity for ATP was greatly reduced (21Kato-Yamada Y. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 6875-6878Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). One possibility is that these residues may be responsible for the difference (R84A, K94A, E98A, and R102A, shown in blue in Fig. 1B). 2) These are the residues that formed hydrogen bonds with ATP in the crystal structure of the TF1 ϵ subunit-ATP complex (E83A, D89A, R92A, R99A, R115A, R122A, and R126A, marked with asterisks in Fig. 1A and shown in red in Fig. 1B), although two of these (Arg122 and Arg126) were thought to play an inhibitory role in a previous study (34Hara K.Y. Kato-Yamada Y. Kikuchi Y. Hisabori T. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23969-23973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Arg115 appeared to interact with ATP bound to another monomer ϵ subunit in the crystal structure (22Yagi H. Kajiwara N. Tanaka H. Tsukihara T. Kato-Yamada Y. Yoshida M. Akutsu H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 11233-11238Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and, possibly, to be involved in ATP binding. ATP binding to these mutants was assayed by gel-filtration chromatography. The results are shown in Fig. 2. Two mutants (R102A and R115A) showed essentially the same profile as the wild type. Four (E83A, R92A, R122A, and R126A) showed no ATP binding, and the other five (R84A, D89A, K94A, E98A, and R99A) showed a moderate degree of binding. For further analyses, four mutants (E83A, R92A, R122A, and R126A) were chosen that showed virtually no ATP binding in the gel-filtration assay. Interestingly, all these residues are conserved between TF1 and BF1. Arg92, which was included in the previously proposed consensus ATP binding motif, I(L)DXXRA, was found to be important for ATP binding (22Yagi H. Kajiwara N. Tanaka H. Tsukihara T. Kato-Yamada Y. Yoshida M. Akutsu H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 11233-11238Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). As determined previously, Glu83 was also found to be important for ATP binding (22Yagi H. Kajiwara N. Tanaka H. Tsukihara T. Kato-Yamada Y. Yoshida M. Akutsu H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 11233-11238Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The mutants selected by the differences between TF1 and BF1 had a relatively minor effect on ATP binding. The difference in ATP binding between TF1 and BF1 may be because of the differences in other residues. As for E. coli F1-ATPase (EF1) ϵ, only Arg92 is conserved, although EF1 ϵ possesses a lysine residue in place of Arg122. These differences may be the cause of the very weak affinity for ATP of the EF1 ϵ subunit (22Yagi H. Kajiwara N. Tanaka H. Tsukihara T. Kato-Yamada Y. Yoshida M. Akutsu H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 11233-11238Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The cysteine residue introduced at Gln107, located in the loop region between the two C-terminal α helices, was labeled with fluorescent maleimide. This was used to provide a more accurate measurement of the ATP binding affinity of the mutants that showed no ATP binding in the gel-filtration analysis. Although the extent of fluorescence varied with mutants, possibly because of the differences in the interactions between dye and protein, saturating ATP concentration dependence of the fluorescence was observed (Fig. 3). The Kd for ATP at 25 °C of these mutants varied from 100 μm to >1 mm. Although the crystal structure suggests that the Glu83 and Arg92 residues are important for ATP binding, the mutation at Arg126 was shown to have a more significant effect.FIGURE 2Gel-filtration analysis of ATP binding to the mutant ϵ subunits of TF1. ATP binding to the mutant ϵ subunits (25 μm) was analyzed on a Sephadex G25F column. Elution was monitored at 260 nm. Mutations are described on the left of each trace. Upper and lower traces represent measurements with and without 25 μm ATP, respectively. Positions of the peaks containing ϵ subunit are marked with dotted lines.

Changes in the fluorescence of IC3-labeled mutant ϵ subunits upon addition of ATP were measured. ATP was added to the IC3-labeled ϵ subunit sequentially. Changes in fluorescence are corrected for corresponding measurements without ATP, normalized to initial fluorescence, and plotted against ATP concentration. Excitation and emission wavelengths were 522 and 559 nm, respectively. Open square, open circle, closed circle, open diamond, and closed diamond represent wild type, E83A, R92A, R122A, and R126A, respectively. Lines represent fits with data by a simple binding scheme. Calculated Kd values and maximum fluorescence of the mutants for ATP are as follows: 4.3 μm, 79% (wild type); 520 μm, 50% (E83A); 160 μm, 63% (R92A); 280 μm, 46% (R122A); and >1000 μm, 61% (R126A), respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Suppressed ATPase Activity with Mutant ϵ Subunits—There was no significant difference in ATPase activities of α3β3γϵ complexes containing mutant ϵ subunit at high ATP concentration (2 mm) (Fig. 4A). However, reduction in ATP concentration resulted in more prominent differences in mutant ATPase activities. For example, at 200 μm ATP (Fig. 4B), α3β3γϵ complexes containing R126A showed markedly lower ATPase activity than the wild-type complex. At 20 μm ATP (Fig. 4C), the differences were more significant, and the α3β3γϵ complex containing E83A or R92A also showed a reduction in ATPase activity compared with the wild-type complex. The ATP concentration dependence of the ATPase activity is summarized in Fig. 5. The ATP concentration that resulted in half-maximum activity may not directly relate to the Kd for ATP of the ϵ subunit because activity was measured at a defined time point and not at final equilibrium. However, with the exception of R122A, increased inhibition was observed with less ATP binding mutant ϵ subunit (Fig. 5B). The strengths of ATP binding were in the following order: WT > R92A > R122A > E83A > R126A, whereas the activities were in the following order: R122A > WT > R92A > E83A > R126A. The exceptional behavior of R122A may be because of the direct involvement of Arg122 in the inhibitory effect of the ϵ subunit itself (34Hara K.Y. Kato-Yamada Y. Kikuchi Y. Hisabori T. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23969-23973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).FIGURE 5ATP concentration dependence of the ATPase activity.

Symbols are the same as in A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) ATP Binding to the ϵ Subunit Is Not a Primary Event in Activation—In a previous study, nucleotide binding to the β subunit was found to be responsible for the conformational change in the ϵ subunit because the conformational change was also observed in the noncatalytic site-deficient mutant (ΔNC); in addition, it was noted that AMP-PNP could also induce conformational change in the ϵ subunit (16Kato-Yamada Y. Yoshida M. Hisabori T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35746-35750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, the finding that the ϵ subunit can bind ATP raises the possibility that ATP binding may be a trigger for the conformational change in the ϵ subunit. To test this hypothesis, a mutant α3β3γ complex was prepared that contained KT/AA substitutions in Walker A motifs (27Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4257) Google Scholar) in both the α and β subunits (ΔNC/ΔC). The KT/AA mutations are known to result in the loss of ATP binding in several Walker-type ATPases (25Matsui T. Muneyuki E. Honda M. Allison W.S. Dou C. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8215-8221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 35Watanabe Y.-H. Motohashi K. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5804-5809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The ΔNC/ΔC-α3β3γ complex showed no steady-state ATPase activity (that is, less than 1/100 of ΔNC, i.e. <1/10000 of the wild type) despite the presence of 0.3% lauryldimethylamine oxide. This suggests that virtually no ATP was bound to the catalytic sites (data not shown). In Fig. 6, a decrease in the fluorescent band indicated that the ϵ subunit was adopting a folded state, thus easily forming a cross-link between S48C and N125C. With the ΔNC mutant, ATP-dependent enhancement of the cross-link formation in the ϵNCX subunit was observed (Fig. 6) (16Kato-Yamada Y. Yoshida M. Hisabori T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35746-35750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In contrast, no enhancement of cross-link formation was observed with the ΔNC/ΔC mutant (Fig. 6). The results implied that ATP does not bind primarily to the ϵ subunit, but rather to the (possibly second or third) catalytic site(s). This may be the trigger for activation from inhibition by the ϵ subunit. When the ϵ subunit is in the extended state, the ATP binding site is divided, and ATP cannot access the residues therein as they are hidden within the α3β3 cavity. ATP binding to the β subunit may induce conformational changes in the β subunit, resulting in expulsion of the ϵ subunit from the α3β3 cylinder. Once the C-terminal helices are expelled from the α3β3 cylinder, ATP can access the binding site on the ϵ subunit. Re-inactivation by Decreasing ATP Concentration—At high concentrations of ATP (e.g. 2 mm) (Fig. 4A), the ATPase activities of the α3β3γϵ complexes containing the wild-type or mutant ϵ subunit were found to be similar. However, the ATPase activities differed significantly at low concentrations of ATP (e.g. 20 μm) (Fig. 4C). Following from this, the ATP concentration was changed from high to low to determine the impact of ATP dissociation from the ϵ subunit in the α3β3γϵ complex. The α3β3γϵ complex was incubated with 4 mm ATP-Mg for more than 10 min at room temperature. As reported previously, this treatment activated the α3β3γϵ complex (10Kato Y. Matsui T. Tanaka N. Muneyuki E. Hisabori T. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24906-24912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Five μl of the sample was then injected into 1 ml of ATP-free ATPase assay mixture to give a final ATP concentration of 20 μm. In contrast to the ATPase measurement taken without preincubation with ATP (Fig. 4C), the WT α3β3γϵ complex showed similar ATPase activity to the α3β3γ complex (Fig. 7). Slow inactivation was observed with E83A, R92A, and R126A, for which the Kd for ATP was higher than 20 μm. The reason ATPase activity remained high in the WT α3β3γϵ complex may have been because the wild-type ϵ subunit maintained high affinity for ATP, and thus ATP remained bound even at a concentration of 20 μm. ATP Binding to the ϵ Subunit Shifts the Equilibrium between Inactive and Active States—The ATP binding form of the ϵ subunit was revealed as the folded state (22Yagi H. Kajiwara N. Tanaka H. Tsukihara T. Kato-Yamada Y. Yoshida M. Akutsu H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 11233-11238Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The binding site consists of both the N- and C-terminal domains. Moreover, there may be no room for ATP to bind to the ϵ subunit in the extended form, as the C-terminal helices of the ϵ subunit are surrounded by the α, β, and γ subunits. The results also imply that fluctuation of the ϵ subunit between folded and extended forms rarely occurs in the absence of ATP binding to the β subunits. The likely role of ATP binding to the ϵ subunit is to stabilize the ϵ subunit of activated complex in the folded state. A simplified model is shown in Fig. 8. The ATPase-inactive TF1 complex is activated by binding of ATP to the β subunit(s). Upon activation, the ϵ subunit changes its conformation from the extended to the folded state. However, in the absence of bound ATP, the folded state is unstable (22Yagi H. Kajiwara N. Tanaka H. Tsukihara T. Kato-Yamada Y. Yoshida M. Akutsu H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 11233-11238Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and the C-terminal domain of the ϵ subunit has the tendency to return to its extended form. ATP binding to the ϵ subunit stabilizes the folded state, shifts the equilibrium between the inactive and active states of TF1, and results in a higher proportion of active complex. This may be important when, for example, cells contain sufficient ATP, but the membrane potential is low because of an alkaline environment. Under such conditions, F0F1 may work as a proton pump to build up membrane potential at the expense of ATP. In the absence of ATP binding to the ϵ subunit, however, F0F1 may readily adopt the ATPase-inactive conformation even if the cell contains sufficient ATP. It should be noted that affinity for ATP of the ϵ subunit under physiological temperature is relatively low (Kd = 0.6 mm at 65 °C), and the cellular ATP concentration may fluctuate in this range (19Iino R. Murakami T. Iizuka S. Kato-Yamada Y. Suzuki T. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40130-40134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In the case of BF1, because the Kd for ATP is in the order of mm (21Kato-Yamada Y. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 6875-6878Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the regulatory mechanism may be the same as that of TF1. As for EF1, the Kd value of ϵ was reported to be 22 mm at 25 °C (22Yagi H. Kajiwara N. Tanaka H. Tsukihara T. Kato-Yamada Y. Yoshida M. Akutsu H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 11233-11238Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and this low affinity for ATP may be the cause of the strong inhibitory effect of EF1 ϵ compared with that of TF1 ϵ. In summary, the current study shows that the ϵ subunit works not only as a regulator but also as an ATP sensor to regulate enzyme activity according to cellular energy status. Studies on the role of ATP binding to the ϵ subunit in the ATP synthesis reaction are currently under way. We thank Drs. Hiromasa Yagi, Hideaki Tanaka, Tomitake Tsukihara, and Hideo Akutsu and Nobumoto Kajiwara for providing structural information on the ATP binding site of the TF1 ϵ subunit."

NH Alice ultraviolet spectroscopy and concurrent Hubble Space Telescope ultraviolet imaging in eclipse investigate the relative contribution of volcanoes to Io's atmosphere and its interaction with Jupiter's magnetosphere. Auroral brightness and morphology variations after eclipse ingress and egress reveal changes in the relative contribution of sublimation and volcanic sources to the atmosphere. Brightnesses viewed at different geometries are best explained by a dramatic difference between the dayside and nightside atmospheric density. Far-ultraviolet aurora morphology reveals the influence of plumes on Io's electrodynamic interaction with Jupiter's magnetosphere. Comparisons to detailed simulations of Io's aurora indicate that volcanoes supply 1 to 3% of the dayside atmosphere.

In yeast, subunit a is the only V0 component encoded by more than one gene, namely the two homologs, vph1 and stv1. The two yeast versions or four animal versions of subunit a principally exhibit cell-specific and intracellular compartment-specific distribution; in many cases, they have been shown to target the complex to separate compartments (e.g. Vph1 to the vacuole and Stv1 to endosomal compartments (6Manolson M.

Biol. 2002; 205: 1209-1219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). Of the four orthologous genes in animals, subunit a1 has consistently been shown to be highly enriched in, if not restricted to, neurons. In Drosophila, neuronal expression of subunit a1 in homozygous mutant animals fully rescues the lethality associated with the loss of a1, demonstrating its sole requirement in the nervous system (8Hiesinger P.R.

Recently, subunit a has been implicated in membrane fusion or secretion independent of intracompartmental acidification. These roles include fusion of yeast vacuoles (9Bayer M.J. Reese C. Buhler S.

Moreover, in the endocytic degradative pathway, subunit a2 has recently been shown to exert another function independent of proton pumping; subunit a2 interacts with the guanine nucleotide-exchange factor ARNO in a pH-dependent manner, suggesting its function as a pH sensor for controlling the recruitment of the GTPase activated by ARNO, Arf6, which in turn directly interacts with the V0 sector (13Hurtado-Lorenzo A. Skinner M. Annan J.E. Futai M. Sun-Wada G.-H. Bourgoin S. Casanova J. Wildeman A. Bechoua S. Ausiello D.A. Brown D. Marshansky V. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 124-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Finally, a recent analysis of another tissue-specific V0 sector component, subunit d2, revealed a defect of osteoclast fusion independent of acidification (14Lee S.-H. Rho J. Jeong D. Sul J.-Y. Kim T. Kim N. Kang J.-S. Miyamoto T. Suda T. Lee S.-K. Pignolo R.J. Koczon-Jaremko B. Lorenzo J. Choi Y. Nat. Med. 2007; 12: 1403-1409Crossref Scopus (448) Google Scholar). How the putative multiple functions of the V0 sector, and subunit a in particular, are regulated is largely unknown. Here, we report the identification and characterization of a CaM-binding site in subunit a1 (or V100) of Drosophila. CaM interacts with V100 in a Ca2+-dependent, high affinity manner. Ablation of this binding site results in a loss of CaM recruitment to synapses. Expression of V100 with a mutated CaM-binding site at low levels leads to incomplete rescue of the neuronal function, and high levels of expression lead to cell death. Our data uncover a critical regulatory function of CaM that controls genetically separable V100 and possibly V-ATPase functions. Cloning, Mutagenesis, and Purification of Proteins—The DNA sequence of the 407-residue N-terminal region (V100-N) of the fly neuronal a1 was amplified by PCR, cloned into pET44 plasmid, and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). The protein was purified initially using TALON beads (Clontech). After removing the His6-Nus tag by proteolysis, the V100-N was further purified onto a gel filtration column. Recombinant CaM was purified following a published procedure (15Putkey J. Slaughter G. Means A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4704-4712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations of V100-N were introduced using QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and verified by DNA sequencing. Pulldown and Sizing Exclusion Chromatography Assays—His-Nus-tagged native and mutant V100-N protein (0.2 mg) anchored on TALON beads (Clontech) was used as bait. The beads were incubated with CaM (0.22 mg) in the cold room for 3 h and washed extensively with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.2% CHAPS, 5 mm CaCl2 and then subjected to SDS-PAGE for visualization. For the analytical gel filtration chromatography, the untagged wild type or mutant V100-N and CaM were mixed to a volume of 0.25 ml before loading onto a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (GE Healthcare). Fluorescence Measurements—The peptide of the CaM-binding domain (CBD) of the fly V100 (314NLKNWFVKVRKIKAIYHTLNLFNLD338) was synthesized commercially (Bio-Synthesis, Inc., Lewisville, TX). Both CaM and CBD peptide were prepared in 5 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. The concentration of Drosophila CaM and CBD peptide were determined by the 280-nm absorption using extinction coefficients of 1280 and 6970 m-1 cm-1, respectively. For the titration, 1- or 2-μl aliquots of 15 or 45 μm Ca2+·CaM stock solution was added to 0.2 μm peptide in 3-ml volume at room temperature. The change in fluorescence was recorded on the SLM8000C fluorometer by tryptophan excitation at 295 nm and the emission spectrum from 300 to 400 nm. The titration experiments were repeated three times. The titration curve, using the normalized change in fluorescence at 340 nm, was fitted into a quadratic function (below) with SigmaPlot (SPSS) for a 1:1 stoichiometry of binding.

Mutagenesis and Generation of V100-CaM-binding Deficient Transgenic Flies—V100 was subjected to site-directed mutagenesis using full-length cDNA in a pOT2 vector ((Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project) clone LD21248) and the following primers: 5′-CCAAGAATCTTAAGAACGCGGCCGTCAAGGTGCGC-3′ and its reverse complement. Introduction of the double mutation W318A and F319A was verified by sequencing. The resulting v100-WF cDNA was cloned into pUAST using EcoR1 and Xho1 restriction cutting sites as reported previously (8Hiesinger P.R. Fayyazuddin A. Mehta S.Q. Rosenmund T. Schulze K.L. Zhai R.G.

V100 Contains a Specific Site for Tight Binding of Ca2+·CaM—A critical regulatory role of CaM in V0-dependent membrane fusion has been shown only in yeast vacuolar fusion (18Peters C. Mayer A.

Nature. 2001; 409: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), resembling earlier reconstitution experiments of V0 proteolipids from neurons and acetylcholine release (20Israel M.

Neurochem. 2001; 79: 485-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). A search for the presence of a CBD in the primary sequences of all V0 sector protein components (subunits a, c, and d) of the Drosophila neuron V-ATPase hinted at the large N-terminal cytosolic region (V100-N) of subunit a1, suggesting that subunit a1 might be a direct target of CaM regulation. Therefore, purified recombinant V100-N was tested for its ability to bind CaM. Three different mixtures were subjected to analytical gel filtration (Fig. 1): A, the 46-kDa V100-N alone; B, a mixture of V100-N and the 16-kDa CaM with EDTA in the liquid mobile phase; and C, a mixture of V100-N and CaM in the identical ratio as in B onto the column equilibrated and eluted with a buffer containing Ca2+ (no EDTA). In the presence of EDTA (Fig. 1B), the peak fraction 1 is ascribed to V100-N because it matches exactly that of V100-N alone (Fig. 1A). The slower eluting peak fraction 2 represents CaM. Replacement of the EDTA by Ca2+ (Fig. 1C) caused the appearance of a faster eluting peak (peak 3), along with the disappearance of peak 1 shown in Fig. 1B. This finding indicates that peak 3 is associated with the formation of a tight complex between V100-N and Ca2+·CaM. To provide additional evidence, SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining were performed to determine the protein compositions of the various fractions (shown in Fig. 1, E and F). Peak 3, shown in Fig. 1C, is indeed composed of V100-N and Ca2+·CaM, which correspond to Fig. 1F, the two bands of lane 2. Peak 4 is unbound excess Ca2+·CaM (Fig. 1F, lane 3). For the gel filtration of V100-N and Ca2+·CaM in the presence of EDTA (Fig. 1B), the protein compositions (panel E) show that peak 1 is V100-N (lane 3), and peak 2 is a mixture of mostly Ca2+·CaM and some V100-N (lane 4) due to the inability to resolve overlapping peaks 1and 2. Because of the formation of the V100-N-Ca2+·CaM complex (Fig. 1F, peak 3), the V100-N associated with peak 1 could no longer be detected (Fig.1B, cf. lanes 3 and 4). We conclude from the gel filtration results that the N-terminal cytosolic region of V100 forms a tight complex with CaM in a calcium-dependent manner and therefore must contain a specific CBD. CBDs of target proteins are generally small, contiguous amino acid sequences of about 14-26 amino acids in length, containing a number of important hydrophobic and basic residues and having the propensity to form an amphiphilic α helix (22Van Eldik L.J. Watterson M. Calmodulin and Signal Transduction. Academic Press, New York1998Google Scholar, 23O'Neil K.T. DeGrado W.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 59-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). A key feature of most of these domains is the presence of two large hydrophobic residues that are located at position 1 close to the amino end and position 10 or 14 near the C-terminal end (24Rhoads A. Friedberg F. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). Each pair (1-10 or 1-14) of hydrophobic residues serves as anchors to dock the helical peptide in the hydrophobic pockets of the two globular lobes of Ca2+·CaM, often in a manner in which the N- and C-terminal hydrophobic residues bind to the pockets in the C- and N-terminal lobes, respectively, of Ca2+·CaM (25Meador W.E.

The middle portion of the long central helix linking the two lobes is capable of uncoiling into loops of varying sizes for optimal positioning of the pair of hydrophobic residues to the lobes (25Meador W.E.

Truong K. Sherman M. Yuan T. Ikura M. J. Struct. Funct. Genomics. 2000; 1: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar), only two segments, located in the V100-N region, were identified to be potential CBDs: Segment 1, 245FIIFFQGDQLKTRVKKICEGFRATLYP271, and Segment 2, 314NLKNWFVKVRKIKAIYHTLNLFNLD338. Bold and underlined aromatic/large aliphatic residues represent either 1-10 or 1-14 pairs of hydrophobic residues. Segment 1 has the 1-14 (Phe-248 and Ile-259) type pair of anchor hydrophobic residues, but secondary structure prediction suggests that only a portion of the segment (252-265) may assume an α helical configuration. Segment 2, which is predicted to be entirely α helical, contains an unusual combination of both 1-10 (Phe-319-Ile-328) and 1-14 (Phe-319-Ile-332) hydrophobic motifs. To identify which of the two segments is the CBD, single or double mutations of the potentially important hydrophobic residues in either segment, especially those confined to the N termini, were introduced in V100-N. The effects of the mutations on binding of Ca2+·CaM were first evaluated by pulldown assays, with the mutated His6-tagged V100-N bound to nickel beads serving as the bait (supplemental Table S1). The single mutation F248A or F249A and double mutations F248A and I261A in Segment 1 had no effect on Ca2+·CaM binding. However, mutations of either Trp-318 or Phe-319 in Segment 2 abrogated Ca2+·CaM binding. The effects of the double mutations in Segment 2 (F319A+I328 and F319+L332) could not be tested because the mutations resulted in insoluble V100-N proteins. Based on these preliminary results, we further examined the effects of the mutations using analytical gel filtration as described above, and the results are consistent with the pulldown assays (supplemental Table S1 and Fig. S1). For example (Fig. 1D), the gel filtration profile of the mixture of V100-N with the F319A mutation in Segment 2 and Ca2+·CaM is virtually identical to that shown in Fig. 1B, which portrays no complex formation between wild type V100-N and CaM in the presence of EDTA. Taken together, our binding studies and mutagenesis experiments indicate the existence of a CBD in V100, which is confined to Segment 2. To simplify the study of the CaM interactions, synthetic peptides comprising the CBDs are normally used instead of the large intact target enzymes or proteins. This system is in most cases an excellent mimic for the interaction of CaM with the whole target proteins. For example, the Kd values, many in the nm range, of the complexes of Ca2+·CaM with intact targets and with their corresponding CBD peptides are very similar (22Van Eldik L.J. Watterson M. Calmodulin and Signal Transduction. Academic Press, New York1998Google Scholar, 29Cohen P. Klee B.C. Calmodulin (Molecular Aspects of Cellular Regulation). Elsevier, Amsterdam1988Google Scholar). To provide further evidence that Segment 2 is a bona fide CBD, we determined the binding affinity of a synthetic peptide of the segment (residues 314-338) using intrinsic fluorescence measurements. Because CaM is devoid of a tryptophan residue, we surmised that the tryptophan fluorescence of Trp-318 of the peptide (emission maximum at 340 nm) could be exploited to follow the peptide binding to Ca2+·CaM. The addition of Ca2+·CaM to the peptide did cause an ∼50% increase in fluorescence intensity and an ∼10-nm blue shift (Fig. 2A), consistent with a hydrophobic interaction between the tryptophan and CaM. Importantly, these spectral changes do not occur in the presence of EDTA. Titration experiments showed that the intensity at the maximum emission wavelength reached a plateau when about 1 molar eq. of Ca2+·CaM was added to the peptide solution (Fig. 2B). Fitting of the titration curve yielded a Kd of 21.5 ± 3.6 nm, a value indicative of a CBD with very tight affinity for Ca2+·CaM. In summary, our biochemical data demonstrate that Segment 2 is a Ca2+-dependent, high affinity CBD in V100. Comparison of the orthologous regions in other subunit a1 genes reveals a high conservation of the CBD (Fig. 3A). In contrast, all a2-a4 variants across species have a less conserved putative CBD (Fig. 3B). Whether these weaker a2-a4 CBD-homologous regions are capable of binding CaM remains to be tested for each individual case. The strong a1-specific conservation of the CBD tested here suggests that Ca2+·CaM regulation is employed for specific subunit a1 function, most likely having critical regulatory function in the nervous system. CaM Is a Critical Regulator of V100 in Drosophila Neurons—In Drosophila, the V0 subunit a1 V100 is required for synaptic vesicle exocytosis independent of vesicle acidification (8Hiesinger P.R. Fayyazuddin A. Mehta S.Q. Rosenmund T. Schulze K.L. Zhai R.G. Verstreken P. Cao Y. Zhou Y. Kunz J. Bellen H.J. Cell. 2005; 121: 607-620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). We therefore wondered whether CaM regulation is required for V100 function in vivo. To test this possibility, we mutated two key residues of the CaM-binding site, Trp-318 and Phe-319, to alanine and generated transgenic flies for tissue-specific expression of v100WF. Neuronal expression (using the neuron-specific elav-Gal4 driver and UAS wild type v100 (30Brand A. Perrimon N. Development (Camb.). 1993; 118: 401-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) in homozygous mutants is sufficient to rescue viability to adulthood in flies (8Hiesinger P.R. Fayyazuddin A. Mehta S.Q. Rosenmund T. Schulze K.L. Zhai R.G. Verstreken P. Cao Y. Zhou Y. Kunz J. Bellen H.J. Cell. 2005; 121: 607-620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In contrast, expression of v100WF is not sufficient to rescue mutant animals to adulthood. However, in contrast to the mutants, embryos with neuronal v100WF expression hatch as L1 larvae and exhibit contraction waves and movement. The larvae are progressively sluggish and die within 2-3 days. Interestingly, we found a dosage-dependent effect of v100WF expression; high levels of neuronal v100WF in mutant and importantly also wild type backgrounds lead to increased lethality, suggesting a dominant negative effect. To investigate whether this effect is cell-autonomous, we performed analogous rescue experiments in photoreceptors, which are not required for the viability of the organism. Surprisingly, photoreceptor-specific expression of v100WF causes cell lethality in a dosage-dependent manner (Fig. 4, D-F). In contrast, neither overexpression of wild type v100 nor the complete loss of v100 in photoreceptors causes obvious developmental defects (Fig.4, B and C). Hence, v100WF does not act as a classical dominant negative but exerts a neomorphic toxic function. These results suggest that interference with CaM binding releases V100 from a critical CaM-dependent regulation. CaM-binding Deficient V100 Correctly Localizes to Synapses but Fails to Recruit CaM—If expressions of V100 and V100WF have different activities because of altered CaM binding, this difference could be reflected in mislocalized V100, CaM, or both. We therefore investigated CaM and V100 localization when V100 or V100WF are expressed in v100 mutant photoreceptors, a replacement that fully rescues when wild type V100 is expressed. Both V100 and V100WF exhibit very similar expression profiles with strong enrichment of the protein in synaptic terminals (Fig. 5, A and B, red; arrows). Hence, the V100WF is correctly made and intracellularly sorted. Importantly, these data further indicate that CaM binding is not required for the correct localization of V100. CaM is predominantly and ubiquitously found in the cell bodies (Fig. 5, A and B, cb). However, as shown in Fig. 5, C and D, a weaker, punctate CaM labeling is also apparent in high resolution confocal scans of photoreceptor synapses. Importantly, this CaM labeling (green) is strongly enriched only in v100 mutant synaptic terminals rescued with wild type V100 expression (Fig. 5, C and E) but not V100WF expression (Fig. 5, D and F). These data indicate that V100 can recruit CaM to the synapse but that this recruitment is abolished when V100 lacks its CaM-binding site. In contrast, we found no obvious mislocalization of CaM in the cell bodies or axons of developing photoreceptors (supplemental Fig. S2), suggesting that recruitment of CaM occurs specifically at synapses. Taken together, our in vivo data indicate that CaM critically regulates V100 in neurons and that CaM binding is not required for the correct localization of V100 but for the recruitment of CaM to synapses. We have identified a high affinity CBD that is specific to the neuronal variant of the V-ATPase V0 subunit a1 (V100) in Drosophila. Disruption of this CBD impairs recruitment of CaM to synapses as well as the V100 function required for viability. High levels of CBD-defective V100 reveal cellular toxicity, a phenomenon that is not associated with loss or gain of wild type v100. Our data therefore indicate that V100 is critically regulated by CaM in neuronal system. There are important differences between yeast homotypic vacuolar fusion and tightly regulated exocytosis at synapses, especially with respect to speed (31Wickner W. Haas A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 247-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 32Murthy V.N. De Camilli P. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 26: 701-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, intriguingly, it has been shown previously that Ca2+·CaM regulates yeast vacuolar fusion by binding tightly to the 16-kDa proteolipid V0 subunit c, Vma3, which forms a hexameric channel (19Peters C. Bayer M.J. Buhler S. Andersen J.S. Mann M. Mayer A. Nature. 2001; 409: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). A problem with this model is that the primary sequence of subunit c does not contain a CaM-binding segment that is even remotely similar to that found in several V0 subunit a proteins or in many other enzymes and structural proteins that bind tightly and are regulated by Ca2+·CaM (29Cohen P. Klee B.C. Calmodulin (Molecular Aspects of Cellular Regulation). Elsevier, Amsterdam1988Google Scholar). Moreover, the subunit c has been predicted to fold into four transmembrane helices connected by loops, which are presumably exposed but too short to allow the formation of helical segments for any CaM binding. Indeed, the crystal structure of a ring containing 10 proteolipid subunits of a bacterial V-type Na+-ATPase (Protein Data Bank code 2BL2) does show that the two loops of a subunit connecting two pairs of helices and lying on the cytoplasmic side are composed of no more than four residues (33Murata T. Yamato I. Kakinuma Y. Leslie A.G.W. Walker J.E. Science. 2005; 308: 654-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the yeast subunit a homolog Vph1, which has been shown to be involved in vacuolar fusion downstream of trans-SNARE docking (9Bayer M.J. Reese C. Buhler S. Peters C. Mayer A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 18Peters C. Mayer A. Nature. 1998; 396: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 19Peters C. Bayer M.J. Buhler S. Andersen J.S. Mann M. Mayer A. Nature. 2001; 409: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), has a CBD, largely on account of the presence of the 1-10 (Phe-310-Ile-319) or 1-14 (Phe-310-Ile-323) pairing of hydrophobic residues (Fig. 3B). Thus, if Ca2+·CaM is involved in yeast vacuolar fusion, its target may indeed be Vph1. Like the Drosophila subunit a1 studied here, the worm ortholog, Unc32, exhibits both a highly conserved CBD (Fig. 3B) and predominantly neuronal expression (34Pujol N. Bonnerot C. Ewbank J.J. Kohara Y. Thierry-Mieg D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11913-11921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The apical secretion of exosomes that is mediated by Vha5, another worm subunit a homolog (10Liegeois S. Benedetto A. Garnier J.-M. Schwab Y. Labouesse M. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 949-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), may also be regulated by Ca2+·CaM. In contrast, the absence of the hydrophobic residue at position 1, as well as the preceding tryptophan, in the putative CBD of the human a2 suggests little or no involvement of Ca2+·CaM. Mouse a3 similarly lacks the large hydrophobic residue at position 1 but has the preceding tryptophan. The fact that the neuronal type CBD is not a universal feature of “subunit a” proteins suggests that only a subset of V-ATPases (or V0 sectors) is regulated by Ca2+·CaM. It further suggests that the general function of V-ATPase as a proton pump may not require Ca2+·CaM. CaM regulation of V100 may represent regulation of only subunit a, the V-ATPase V0 sector, or the complete V-ATPase. Does CaM binding separate a function in membrane fusion from a function in proton pumping? Evidences from yeast and Drosophila support this idea. First, Vph1, but not Stv1 (which lacks CBD), is required for yeast vacuolar fusion independent of intracompartmental acidification (9Bayer M.J. Reese C. Buhler S. Peters C. Mayer A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Second, the Drosophila subunit a1 V100 (which has the highly conserved a1-type CBD) is required for synaptic vesicle exocytosis independent of vesicle acidification (8Hiesinger P.R. Fayyazuddin A. Mehta S.Q. Rosenmund T. Schulze K.L. Zhai R.G. Verstreken P. Cao Y. Zhou Y. Kunz J. Bellen H.J. Cell. 2005; 121: 607-620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In the case of the C. elegans subunit a2, Vha-5, it is unclear at this point whether it is regulated by Ca2+·CaM. However, Vha-5 is required for two genetically separable functions, one most consistent with secretion and the other most consistent with acidification (10Liegeois S. Benedetto A. Garnier J.-M. Schwab Y. Labouesse M. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 949-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 11Liegeois S. Benedetto A. Michaux G. Belliard G. Labouesse M. Genetics. 2007; 175: 709-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Similarly, subunit a3 in mouse has also been implicated in a secretory defect independent of acidification (12Sun-Wada G.-H. Toyomura T. Murata Y. Yamamoto A. Futai M. Wada Y. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 4531-4540Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Taken together with a recent mouse knock-out of the V0 subunit d2, which resulted in a cell fusion defect of osteoclasts independent of acidification (14Lee S.-H. Rho J. Jeong D. Sul J.-Y. Kim T. Kim N. Kang J.-S. Miyamoto T. Suda T. Lee S.-K. Pignolo R.J. Koczon-Jaremko B. Lorenzo J. Choi Y. Nat. Med. 2007; 12: 1403-1409Crossref Scopus (448) Google Scholar), evidence is mounting for a secretory function of the V-ATPase V0 sector. However, whether only one function of V0 is selectively regulated by CaM binding, and if so which, or whether CaM exerts different functions depending on the context a particular V-ATPase is employed in, remains to be determined. Importantly, neither loss nor gain of v100 in Drosophila neurons causes cell lethality. In contrast, V100WF is toxic for the cell in a dosage-dependent manner. Taken together with the failure of V100WF to recruit CaM to synapses, the neomorphic toxicity may be caused either by the mislocalization of CaM or by the mutant V100 protein itself. As complete loss of v100 (and thus assumedly a corresponding loss of V100-dependent CaM recruitment to the synapse) does not cause cellular toxicity, we conclude that at least this phenotype cannot be caused by a V100-independent function of CaM. The V100WF protein itself may be partially misfolded; however, the mutant and wild type proteins exhibit identical localization and no obvious aggregation when expressed in photoreceptors (cf. Fig. 5 and supplemental Fig. S2). These data indicate that the mutant protein is stable and intracellularly sorted like the wild type protein. We can envision two scenarios as to how v100WF expression might lead to cell lethality; both are based on the idea that interference with CaM binding releases V100 from normally tight Ca2+·CaM-dependent regulation. In the first model, overexpression of v100WF leads to more promiscuous engagement in V-ATPase V0 complexes that are normally serviced by subunit a2-a4 and required for cell viability. Removal of V-ATPase activity by loss of at least one V1 subunit (vha55) indeed causes cell lethality in photoreceptors 5P. Robin Hiesinger, unpublished data. . In the second model, release of V100 from Ca2+·CaM regulation allows V100 to function similarly to overexpression of the t-SNARE syntaxin (35Schulze K.L. Broadie K. Perin M.S. Bellen H.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 311-320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). In photoreceptors, both V100WF as well as syntaxin exert dosage-dependent toxicity when overexpressed (8Hiesinger P.R. Fayyazuddin A. Mehta S.Q. Rosenmund T. Schulze K.L. Zhai R.G. Verstreken P. Cao Y. Zhou Y. Kunz J. Bellen H.J. Cell. 2005; 121: 607-620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In view of this, the neomorphic toxicity of v100WF would be caused by an “overactive” protein due to lack of CaM-constrained regulation (35Schulze K.L. Broadie K. Perin M.S. Bellen H.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 311-320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). We cannot distinguish between these possibilities currently, as the molecular mechanisms of both syntaxin and V100WF overexpression require further investigation. In conclusion, our studies have shown that CaM not only binds tightly to the V0 sector subunit a1 in a calcium-dependent manner, but also critically regulates V100 in neurons. The initial work presented here paves the way for further in vitro and in vivo investigations to deepen our understanding of the biological roles of the interaction between CaM and V0.

https://openalex.org/W1997423604,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by defects in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) that functions as a chloride channel in epithelial cells. The most common cause of CF is the abnormal trafficking of CFTR mutants. Therefore, understanding the cellular machineries that transit CFTR from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane (PM) is important. The coat protein complex I (COPI) has been implicated in the anterograde and retrograde transport of proteins and lipids between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi. Here, we investigated the role of COPI in CFTR trafficking. Blocking COPI recruitment to membranes by expressing an inactive form of the GBF1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor for ADP-ribosylation factor inhibits CFTR trafficking to the PM. Similarly, inhibiting COPI dissociation from membranes by expressing a constitutively active ADP-ribosylation factor 1 mutant arrests CFTR within disrupted Golgi elements. To definitively explore the relationship between COPI and CFTR in epithelial cells, we depleted β-COP from the human colonic epithelial cell HT-29Cl.19A using small interfering RNA. β-COP depletion did not affect CFTR synthesis but impaired its trafficking to the PM. The arrest occurred pre-Golgi as shown by reduced level of glycosylation. Importantly, decreased trafficking of CFTR had a functional consequence as cells depleted of β-COP showed decreased cAMP-activated chloride currents. To explore the mechanism of COPI action in CFTR traffic we tested whether CFTR was COPI cargo. We discovered that the α-, β-, and γ-subunits of COPI co-immunoprecipitated with CFTR.

The most prevalent mutation causing cystic fibrosis, ΔF508, is due to misfolding of the CFTR protein. Misfolded CFTR displays an abnormal trafficking, and consequently the CFTR protein is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is absent from the plasma membrane (PM) of epithelial cells. Therefore, understanding the trafficking pathway of CFTR from the ER to the PM is important. Recent studies suggested that CFTR processing is independent of components involved in conventional trafficking (2Bannykh S.I. Bannykh G.I. Fish K.N. Moyer B.D. Riordan J.R. Balch W.E. Traffic. 2000; 1: 852-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). It was reported that in some cells like baby hamster kidney cells, CFTR follows a non-conventional trafficking pathway where CFTR is transported from the ER to late Golgi/endosomal compartments before recycling back to Golgi compartments for oligosaccharide processing (3Yoo J.S.

Earlier studies show that the COPII machinery is required for CFTR to be exported out of the ER (4Fu L. Sztul E. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 5Wang X.

A di-acidic exit code is present in the CFTR molecule that interacts with the Sec23-Sec24 cargo selection complex present in COPII vesicles (5Wang X. Matteson J. An Y. Moyer B. Yoo J.S. Bannykh S.

In addition to COPII, the coat protein complex I (COPI) is implicated in secretory traffic. COPI mediates retrograde transport that selectively recycles membrane and soluble proteins as well as lipids from the cis-Golgi complex to the ER (6Nickel W. Brugger B. Wieland F.T. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 9: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Additionally, COPI coat proteins have multiple functions in intra-Golgi trafficking and in maintaining the normal structure of the mammalian interphase Golgi complex (7Elazar Z. Orci L. Ostermann J. Amherdt M. Tanigawa G. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). COPI vesicles are also involved in the anterograde transport of proteins (8Nickel W. Malsam J. Gorgas K. Ravazzola M. Jenne N. Helms J.B. Wieland F.T. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3081-3090PubMed Google Scholar). The observation that COPI vesicles participate in several distinct transport directions has long been difficult to rationalize. The recent discovery of different populations of COPI-coated vesicles strongly suggests that COPI vesicles have different functions (9Orci L. Ravazzola M. Volchuk A. Engel T. Gmachl M. Amherdt M.

COPI is recruited to membrane by a small GTPase of the Ras superfamily, the ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF1). ARF1 cycles between an inactive GDP-bound state and an active GTP-bound state (15Liu W. Duden R. Phair R.D. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 1053-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Two families of proteins regulate the activation status of ARFs. ARFs are activated by a GDP/GTP exchange catalyzed by guanine nucleotide exchange factors. ARFs are deactivated by GTP hydrolysis facilitated by GTPase-activating proteins. Vesicle formation requires ARF in the active GTP-bound form and is therefore dependent on the activity of guanine nucleotide exchange factors. Vesicle disassembly is dependent on the hydrolysis of GTP on ARF and requires active GTPase-activating proteins. Yoo et al. (3Yoo J.S. Moyer B.D. Bannykh S. Yoo H.M. Riordan J.R. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11401-11409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) found that in non-epithelial cells, CFTR trafficking could be COPI-dependent (i.e. HeLa and human embryonic kidney 293 cells) or COPI-independent (i.e. baby hamster kidney and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells). In animals, CFTR is mostly expressed in epithelial cells, and the intracellular trafficking of CFTR might differ between epithelial and non-epithelial cells. In this regard, endogenous CFTR is processed very efficiently in epithelial cells, whereas its processing is inefficient in transfected cells (16Varga K. Jurkuvenaite A. Wakefield J. Hong J.S. Guimbellot J.S. Venglarik C.J. Niraj A. Mazur M. Sorscher E.J. Collawn J.F. Bebok Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22578-22584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This study addresses the role of COPI complex in the trafficking of CFTR. We mostly focus on the human colonic epithelial cells, HT-29Cl.19A, that endogenously express CFTR. We now report that transfection of dominant negative guanine nucleotide exchange factor and ARF mutants that interfere with the conventional trafficking of proteins between the ER and the Golgi prevented CFTR from reaching the PM. In addition, down-regulation of COPI subunit β-COP expression in HT29Cl.19A cells by siRNA (1Denning G.M. Ostedgaard L.S. Cheng S.H. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. J. Clin. Investig. 1992; 89: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) impaired CFTR trafficking to the PM and (2Bannykh S.I. Bannykh G.I. Fish K.N. Moyer B.D. Riordan J.R. Balch W.E. Traffic. 2000; 1: 852-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) reduced cAMP-activated chloride currents. Finally, we show that COPI subunits co-immunoprecipitate with CFTR, suggesting that these molecules are in a complex. Taken together, these observations implicate COPI vesicles in CFTR trafficking in epithelial cells. Tissue Culture and Transient Transfection—The human adenocarcinoma cell line HT-29Cl.19A, HeLa, and the Cos-7 cells were grown at 37 °C under a 5% CO2 atmosphere in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) bovine growth serum and containing penicillin/streptomycin. The colonic epithelial cells were transfected with 10 nm siRNA to β-COP (Ambion) or control siRNA that have limited sequence similarity to known genes (Ambion) with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instruction. Cos-7 cells were co-transfected with WT-CFTR cDNA (8 μg/10-cm dish) and siRNA to β-COP (Ambion) or control siRNA (Ambion) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instruction. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—The cells were lysed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-1% Triton X-100 containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). The lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation using C-CFTR monoclonal antibody (mAb 24-1; R&D Systems) or β-COP monoclonal antibody (clone maD; Sigma) cross-linked on A/G-agarose beads in the presence of 1% bovine serum albumin. After extensive washings, the bound proteins were analyzed by Western blot after transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). After blocking with 5% dry milk, the primary antibody was added at the required dilution (1/2,000 for C-CFTR, R&D Systems; 1/2,000 for β-COP, Sigma; 1/2,000 for α-COP, Affinity BioReagents; 1/500 for γ-COP, Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1/2,000 for SNAP-23 produced for us by Genemed Synthesis; and 1/2,000 for Na+/K+-ATPase, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies). The secondary antibodies horseradish peroxidase-conjugated (Pierce) were used at 1/10,000. The signal was detected using West Pico (Pierce). Immunofluorescence—HeLa cells were co-transfected with untagged wild-type CFTR and either Myc-tagged inactive GBF1/E794K mutant, hemagglutinin-tagged wild-type ARF1, or hemagglutinin-tagged constitutively active Arf1/Q71L mutant. After 24 h, cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min, washed with PBS three times for 2 min, and blocked in 0.4% fish skin gelatin for 5 min. Cells were then incubated with anti-NBD1 polyclonal antibodies (to detect CFTR, provided by Dr. Bebok, University of Alabama at Birmingham) and either monoclonal anti-hemagglutinin antibodies (to detect WT-ARF1 and ARF1/Q71L) purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology or monoclonal anti-Myc antibodies (to detect WT-GBF and GBF1/E794K) purchased from Invitrogen or monoclonal anti-GM130 purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories. Transepithelial Short Circuit Currents—HT-29Cl.19A cells were cultured on permeable membranes (Transwell; Costar). Three days after transfection the filters were mounted in Ussing chambers. Short circuit current (Isc) measurements were done as previously described (37Cobb R.B. King C.M. Fortenberry J. Greer H. Kovacs T. Sorscher E.J. Clancy J.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: L12-L25Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. Briefly, Ringer's buffer (115 mm NaCl, 25 mm NaHCO3, 2.4 KH2PO4, 1.24 K2HPO4, 1.2 CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, and 10 mmd-glucose, pH 7.4) was added in the basal compartment of the Ussing chamber, and low chloride (1.2 mm NaCl and 115 mm sodium gluconate replacing 115 mm NaCl) was added to the apical chamber. Bath solutions were vigorously stirred and gassed with 5% CO2. Solutions and chambers were maintained at 37 °C. Forskolin (20 μm) was added to both sides of the monolayer to evaluate cAMP-stimulated currents. Glibenclamide (200 μm) was added to the apical side at the end of the experiment to block CFTR channels. Cell Surface Biotinylation—The Cos-7 cells were rinsed with PBS to eliminate the proteins present in the medium. Because the biotinylation reagent cross-links primarily through lysine residues, residual serum will inhibit cell surface biotinylation. Cell surface proteins were labeled with EZ-Link NHS-SS Biotin (Pierce) for 30 min at 4 °C. Following biotinylation, cells were rinsed with PBS-bovine serum albumin for 10 min at 4 °C to quench any residual NHS-SS biotin. At the end of the experiments, the cells were lysed with PBS-1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Biotinylated proteins were incubated with streptavidin beads and subjected to Western blot. Biotinylated CFTR was detected using a CFTR monoclonal antibody (mAb 24–1; R&D Systems). Metabolic Pulse-Chase Labeling of CFTR—After washing in PBS, HT-29Cl.19A cells expressing CFTR were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without methionine and cysteine for 60 min at 37 °C. Subsequently, the cells were metabolically labeled in the same medium with 0.2 mCi/ml [35S]cysteine and [35S]methionine for 60 min at 37 °C. Then the cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% bovine growth serum and 10 mm methionine and cysteine. Labeled proteins were chased for the indicated times (0, 30 min, 1 and 2 h). At the end of the experiment, the cells were lysed and subjected to immunoprecipitation as described under “Immunoprecipitation.” The radioactivity associated with CFTR was quantified using phosphorimaging (Bio-Rad). Expression of Dominant Negative Mutant Proteins That Alter COPI Dynamics Inhibits CFTR Traffic—We and others showed that the COPII machinery is required for CFTR trafficking (4Fu L. Sztul E. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 5Wang X. Matteson J. An Y. Moyer B. Yoo J.S. Bannykh S. Wilson I.A. Riordan J.R. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The COPII machinery is closely linked to COPI machinery, raising the possibility that COPI also participates in CFTR trafficking. COPI function is experimentally modulated in intact cells by regulating the levels of active ARF. Low levels of active ARF dissociate COPI from membranes. Low levels of active ARF can be achieved through expressing an inactive mutant of the ARF guanine nucleotide exchange factor GBF1 (GBF1/E794K) (17Garcia-Mata R. Szul T. Alvarez C. Sztul E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2250-2261Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In such cells, COPI dissociates from the membranes. High levels of active ARF stabilize COPI on membranes. Abnormally high levels of activated ARF are established by expressing the GTP-restricted mutant of ARF (ARF1/Q71L). In such cells, COPI is stabilized on the membrane. We examined the trafficking of CFTR in HeLa cells by co-transfecting wild-type CFTR and either GBF1/E794K or ARF1/Q71L. We showed that expression of GBF1/E794K dissociates COPI from membranes and collapses the Golgi and relocates Golgi proteins to the ER or to punctate peripheral structures that contain GBF1/E794K. As shown in Fig. 1D, GBF1/E794K localizes to punctate elements dispersed throughout the cell. Importantly, CFTR co-localizes with GBF1/E794K in these puncta and is not detected on the PM. This effect is specific since expression of wild-type GBF1 does not affect CFTR trafficking (data not shown). In the absence of GBF1 mutant, CFTR is detected at the PM with some CFTR co-localizing with the Golgi marker GM130 (Fig. 1, A and B). This suggests that CFTR trafficking requires COPI association with membranes. Expression of ARF1/Q71L stabilizes COPI coat on membranes and exaggerates Golgi structure and the accumulation of PM-destined proteins within the enlarged Golgi. ARF1/Q71L is also stabilized on the enlarged Golgi. As shown in Fig. 1C, expression of ARF1/Q71L causes the accumulation of CFTR in globular structures containing ARF1/Q71L. This effect is specific since expression of wild-type ARF has no effect on CFTR detected on the PM (Fig. 1A). Together, our data suggest that COPI function is essential for CFTR trafficking at pre-Golgi and Golgi stages of the secretory pathway. Down-regulation of β-COP Protein Expression in HT-29Cl.19ACells—To establish the role of COPI complex on CFTR biogenesis in physiologically relevant epithelial cells, the expression of β-COP protein was down-regulated using silencing RNA (siRNA) in the colonic epithelial cells HT-29Cl.19A. The human colonic epithelial cells HT-29Cl.19A, which express endogenous wild-type CFTR, represent a good model to study transport in epithelial cells (18Lesuffleur T. Kornowski A. Augeron C. Dussaulx E. Barbat A. Laboisse C. Zweibaum A. Int. J. Cancer. 1991; 49: 731-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Three siRNAs (10 nm) targeting different exons of β-COP mRNA and control siRNA that has limited sequence similarity to known genes were transfected into HT-29Cl.19A cells. Seventy-two hours later, the expression of the β-COP protein was decreased by 70–90% compared with control siRNA (Fig. 2A). The silencing is specific because no decrease in the expression of the membrane-associated protein SNAP-23 was observed after introduction of the anti-β-COP siRNA. A time course of β-COP silencing revealed that the strongest inhibition in β-COP protein synthesis occurred between 48 and 72 h (Fig. 2B). The expression of β-COP protein increased after 96 h, demonstrating the transient effect of the siRNAs. The subsequent experiments were performed 72 h after transfection using siRNA targeting exons 3 and 4 of β-COP. Down-regulation of β-COP Protein Expression Alters CFTR Trafficking—Our studies in HeLa cells expressing GBF1 and ARF mutants suggested that CFTR trafficking required COPI function. However, other studies suggest that CFTR follows a non-conventional pathway, possibly bypassing COPI-mediated traffic (3Yoo J.S. Moyer B.D. Bannykh S. Yoo H.M. Riordan J.R. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11401-11409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). It was therefore important to carefully address the question of whether or not COPI was involved in CFTR trafficking in epithelial cells. For this purpose, we investigated the effect of the down-regulation of β-COP expression on CFTR trafficking in HT-29Cl.19A cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, depleting β-COP for 72 h resulted in a 51.8 ± 13.6% decrease in mature (Band C) CFTR and a 3-fold increase in immature (Band B) CFTR. The fact that ∼50% of mature CFTR could still be detected is probably due to the long half-life (∼48 h) of CFTR at the plasma membrane (19Lukacs G.L. Chang X.B. Bear C. Kartner N. Mohamed A. Riordan J.R. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21592-21598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Heda G.D. Tanwani M. Marino C.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C166-C174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, under the same conditions of β-COP depletion, the steady-state expression of the PM protein Na+/K+-ATPase was not affected (Fig. 3C). Cargo-specific functions for the COPI coat have been described previously in yeast (21Cosson P. Letourneur F. Science. 1994; 263: 1629-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 22Letourneur F. Gaynor E.C. Hennecke S. Demolliere C. Duden R. Emr S.D. Riezman H. Cosson P. Cell. 1994; 79: 1199-1207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar, 23Eugster A. Frigerio G. Dale M. Duden R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1011-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Importantly, it shows that β-COP depletion does not produce general cell death. To explore the relationship between COPI and CFTR traffic, we performed metabolic pulse-chase experiments in control and β-COP-depleted cells. In cells transfected with control siRNA, band B CFTR (immature CFTR) decreased over time and correlated with the appearance of band C representing terminal glycosylation of CFTR (mature CFTR) (Fig. 3D and data not shown). In contrast, in β-COP-depleted cells, the immature B band persisted without the mature C band. No degradation of CFTR was observed as immature (band B) CFTR was stable over a 2-h period (Fig. 3D). These results suggest that CFTR traffics to the Golgi to produce mature C band is COPI-dependent. Down-regulation of β-COP Protein Expression Inhibits CFTR Currents in HT-29Cl.19A Cells—The functional site for CFTR is the PM. So, to monitor the physiologically relevant delivery of CFTR to the PM, we measured the cAMP-activated short circuit currents using Ussing chambers. In these experiments, HT-29Cl.19A cells were grown on filters to form a monolayer. CFTR chloride currents were activated by addition of forskolin. As observed in Fig. 4A, an increase in short circuit currents in response to forskolin was observed in control cells. At the end of the experiment, CFTR short circuit currents were inhibited by addition of the CFTR inhibitor glybenclamide. In contrast, depletion of β-COP from HT-29Cl.19A cells resulted in 60% decrease of short circuit currents (Fig. 4B). The down-regulation of β-COP protein expression did not affect the resistance, suggesting that the integrity of the monolayer was not altered (data not shown). A decrease in the resistance would have suggested that the monolayer was leaky and would have resulted in an increase in short circuit currents since we applied a chloride gradient. At the end of the experiments the cells were lysed and the levels of CFTR, β-COP, and SNAP-23 were assessed by Western blot. Fig. 4C shows that transfection of anti-β-COP siRNA decreased protein expression of β-COP in differentiated HT-29Cl.19A cells grown on filters by ∼80% and was comparable with the one observed when the cells were grown on plastic. In those conditions, we observed a decrease in mature CFTR (Band C) and an increase in immature (Band B) CFTR, as previously observed when the cells were grown on plates (see Fig. 3D). The amount of SNAP-23 was unchanged in β-COP-depleted cells. To confirm that β-COP depletion prevented delivery of CFTR to the PM, trafficking of CFTR to the PM was examined by biotinylation of cell surface proteins. It was difficult to detect CFTR present at the cell surface of HT-29Cl.19A cells due to the low expression of CFTR in those cells. Therefore, the experiments were done in Cos-7 cells that are easily transfected, allowing high expression of CFTR. In this experiment, cell surface proteins were labeled using biotin, and biotinylated CFTR was revealed by Western blot after pulling down biotinylated proteins by streptavidin beads. In control cells, ample CFTR was recovered on the streptavidin beads (Fig. 4D). In contrast, CFTR trafficking to the cell surface was inhibited in β-COP-depleted cells (Fig. 4D). No CFTR was detected by Western blot in the absence of biotin, showing that non-biotinylated CFTR did not bind the streptavidin beads. These results suggested that COPI is essential for CFTR trafficking to the cell surface. COPI Subunits Co-immunoprecipitate with CFTR—To investigate the mechanistic parameters of COPI function in CFTR trafficking, we tested the possibility that CFTR is COPI cargo. We therefore examined whether CFTR and COPI were recovered in a complex. Using a CFTR antibody that recognized the C-terminal tail of CFTR to immunoprecipitate lysates of HT-29Cl.19A cells, we recovered the α-, β-, and γ-COP subunits of the COPI coat (Fig. 5A). None of the COPI subunits was detected when immunoprecipitated with nonspecific IgG. Pretreatment of the HT-29Cl.19A cells with brefeldin A, which prevents COPI assembly by interfering with the activation of ARF1, diminished the interaction between CFTR and β-COP (Fig. 5B). Reciprocal immunoprecipitation with an antibody to β-COP subunit was performed but no CFTR signal could be detected, probably due to the low levels of immature CFTR present in the cells. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that COPI is involved in CFTR traffic at the ER-Golgi interface. Here we demonstrate for the first time that CFTR trafficking requires the COPI coat. We took advantage of the finding that COPI coat is recruited to membranes by the small GTPase ARF1 that cycles between an inactive GDP-bound and an active GTP-bound state (24Dascher C. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1437-1448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The guanine nucleotide exchange factor GBF1 activates ARF1 by catalyzing the exchange of GDP to GTP (25Gillingham A. Munro S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2006; 23: 579-611Crossref Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 26Niu T.K. Pfeifer A.C. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Jackson C.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1213-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). We used dominant negative mutants GBF1/E794K and ARF1/Q71L that impair COPI vesicle function (24Dascher C. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1437-1448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Szul T. Garcia-Mata R. Brandon E. Shestopal S. Alvarez C. Sztul E. Traffic. 2005; 6: 374-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The mutant GBF1/E794K can bind ARF-GDP but does not catalyze GDP displacement and thus does not promote the recruitment of the coatomer, whereas ARF1/Q71L is a GTP-restricted mutant that leads to the rapid accumulation of COPI-coated vesicles (28Pepperkok R. Whitney J.A. Gomez M. Kreis T.E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 135-144PubMed Google Scholar). We found that expression of the dominant negative GBF1/E794K mutant that causes the dissociation of COPI from membrane prevented CFTR trafficking to the PM. Similarly, expression of the constitutively activated ARF1/Q71L mutant that stabilizes COPI on membranes also prevented CFTR from reaching the PM. Expression of these mutants prevented CFTR from reaching the PM of HeLa cells. COPI vesicles are involved in the anterograde transport as well as the retrograde transport of proteins and could play a role in sorting proteins. Proteins can move from the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment to the Golgi complex either in COPI-coated vesicles or through direct tubular connections. Protein cargo of COPI-coated vesicles includes (i) luminal ER-resident proteins that have at their C terminus the motif KDEL (single letter amino acid code, HDEL in yeast) that specifies interaction with the KDEL receptor (29Aoe T. Lee A.J. van Donselaar E. Peters P.J. Hsu V.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1624-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and (ii) proteins that have a K(X)KXX motif (where X represents any amino acid) at their C terminus exposed to the cytosol (22Letourneur F. Gaynor E.C. Hennecke S. Demolliere C. Duden R. Emr S.D. Riezman H. Cosson P. Cell. 1994; 79: 1199-1207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). Upon binding, these proteins are returned to the ER. In addition to roles in anterograde and retrograde traffic, COPI vesicles sequester misassembled proteins to prevent their delivery to the plasma membrane. In this regard, COPI vesicles are involved in regulating the trafficking of misfolded presinilin-1 and major histocompatibility complex class 1 (30Rechards M. Xia W. Oorschot V.M. Selkoe D.J. Klumperman J. Traffic. 2003; 4: 553-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 31Paulsson K.M. Kleijmeer M.J. Griffith J. Jevon M. Chen S. Anderson P.O. Sjogren H.O. Li S. Wang P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18266-18271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The potassium channel KCNK3 harbors a di-basic motif that is recognized by the COPI subunit β-COP (32O'Kelly I. Butler M.H. Zilberberg N. Goldstein S.A. Cell. 2002; 111: 577-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Similarly, upon misfolding of the G protein-coupled V2 vasopressin receptor, the β-COP subunit of COPI interacts with the RXR motif present in the cytosolic loop 3 of the receptor, resulting in the retention of the protein in the ER (33Hermosilla R. Oueslati M. Donalies U. Schonenberger E. Krause E. Oksche A. Rosenthal W. Schulein R. Traffic. 2004; 5: 993-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Thus, the association of these proteins with COPI vesicles prevents the delivery of misfolded proteins to the PM. The most common mutation causing CF, ΔF508-CFTR, encodes a protein that does not traffic to the PM. However, ΔF508-CFTR has been reported to be present in the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment in the human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells, CFPAC, suggesting that the mutant protein exits the ER and traffics to the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment but does not move beyond that compartment (34Gilbert A. Jadot M. Leontieva E. Wattiaux-De Coninck S. Wattiaux R. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 242: 144-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We found that β-COP co-immunoprecipitate with both WT- and ΔF508-CFTR in transfected human embryonic kidney 293T cells. 3Rennolds, J. and E. Cormet-Boyaka, unpublished data. However, the transient or stable nature of their association remains to be determined. Interestingly, CFTR harbors four RXR motifs and deletion of these motifs allows the rescue of the processing of the ΔF508-CFTR mutant (35Chang X.B. Cui L. Hou Y.X. Jensen T.J. Aleksandrov A.A. Mengos A. Riordan J.R. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 137-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). We can therefore speculate that ΔF508-CFTR is a COPI cargo for retrograde transport to the ER whereas WT-CFTR is a cargo for anterograde transport toward the PM. The recent findings that two types of COPI vesicles are present in cells provides a rationale for their participation in bidirectional transport (10Malsam J. Satoh A. Pelletier L. Warren G. Science. 2005; 307: 1095-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 11Moelleken J. Malsam J. Betts M.J. Movafeghi A. Reckmann I. Meissner I. Hellwig A. Russell R.B. Sollner T. Brugger B. Wieland F.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 4425-4430Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The involvement of COPI in CFTR traffic was supported by our findings that CFTR was not processed in cells depleted of β-COP. Under those conditions, we observed that CFTR trafficking was altered. Steady-state amount of CFTR exhibited a decrease in band C, representing mature CFTR that trafficked to the Golgi to acquire complex glycosylation, and an increase in band B, representing immature CFTR that is arrested in traffic before the Golgi. These results were confirmed using metabolic pulse-chase experiments and revealed that immature CFTR was not converted to mature CFTR after a 2-h period in HT-29Cl.19A cells depleted of β-COP. The effect seems to be specific to CFTR since down-regulation of β-COP had no effect on the trafficking of the membrane protein Na+/K+-ATPase. However, we cannot eliminate the possibility that the trafficking of other membrane proteins is also affected under similar conditions. These results suggest that CFTR trafficking to the Golgi is dependent on COPI vesicle function. Equally important, down-regulation of β-COP expression decreased cAMP-activated chloride currents. Our results agree with a recent study finding that CFTR channel function was abrogated in non-polarized CHO cells when COPI vesicles were inactivated (36Yu Y. Platoshyn O. Safrina O. Tsigelny I. Yuan J.X. Keller S.H. Biol. Cell. 2007; 99: 433-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The authors also suggested that CHO cells incubated at a temperature that abrogated COPI function did not affect CFTR present at the cell surface. Yoo et al. (3Yoo J.S. Moyer B.D. Bannykh S. Yoo H.M. Riordan J.R. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11401-11409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) found that CFTR trafficking could be COPI-dependent in HeLa and human embryonic kidney 293 cells or COPI-independent in baby hamster kidney and CHO cells, suggesting that the trafficking of CFTR can vary depending on the cell line. CFTR is a chloride channel present at the apical membrane of epithelial cells, and absence of CFTR from the PM causes CF. Therefore, understanding the intracellular trafficking of CFTR in epithelial cells is essential, and in this study we focused on human epithelial cell line HT-29Cl.19A. Here we show that CFTR maturation was abrogated in epithelial cells that were depleted in β-COP. A possible relationship between CFTR and COPI-mediated traffic was suggested by the Balch laboratory (2Bannykh S.I. Bannykh G.I. Fish K.N. Moyer B.D. Riordan J.R. Balch W.E. Traffic. 2000; 1: 852-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) documenting that 25% of total CFTR in CHO cells is associated with COPI structures. Here we show for the first time that α-, β-, and γ-COP subunits were co-immunoprecipitated with CFTR, using a monoclonal antibody that recognizes the C-terminal tail of CFTR. Reciprocally, CFTR was recovered with β-COP in HT-29Cl.19A. These results suggest that CFTR interacted with COPI coatomer as a cargo for sorting into COPI vesicles. In summary, our data show that the COPI complex plays a critical role in the trafficking of CFTR. Further studies are required to identify the protein interacting with CFTR that binds to COPI complex or to determine whether CFTR interacts directly with COPI complex."

We now show that monomeric endotoxin can be transferred in reverse from MD-2 to CD14 but not to lipopolysaccharide-binding protein. Reverse transfer requires a ∼1000-fold molar excess of CD14 to endotoxin-MD-2. Transfer of endotoxin from MD-2 to extracellular soluble CD14 reduces activation of cells expressing TLR4 without MD-2. However, transfer of endotoxin from MD-2 to membrane CD14 (mCD14) makes cells expressing MD-2·TLR4 sensitive to activation by the endotoxin-MD-2 complex. An endotoxin-mutant (F126A) MD-2 complex that does not activate cells expressing TLR4 alone potently activates cells expressing mCD14, MD-2, and TLR4 by transferring endotoxin to mCD14, which then transfers endotoxin to endogenous wild-type MD-2·TLR4. These findings describe a novel pathway of endotoxin transfer that provides an additional layer of regulation of cell activation by endotoxin.

Endotoxins are unique, highly abundant surface glycolipids of Gram-negative bacteria. They have the capacity to potently induce proinflammatory responses of many multicellular hosts.

CD14, and, later, the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and MD-2, it has become clear that each of these proteins plays a key role in the ability of many mammalian hosts to mount highly sensitive responses to endotoxin (1Beutler B.

MD-2 is required for TLR4-dependent cell activation of mammalian cells by endotoxin, whereas LBP and CD14 are needed for maximal sensitivity. This sensitivity is needed to permit host cells to respond to pg/ml concentrations of endotoxin and thereby trigger defensive host responses to small numbers of Gram-negative bacteria soon after bacterial invasion, before the host is overwhelmed by bacterial growth.We have made use of metabolically radiolabeled purified endotoxin to better define how LBP, CD14 and MD-2 together make possible potent TLR4-dependent cell activation by endotoxin (6Giardina P.C.

On the basis of these and many other studies, we and others have proposed that potent TLR4-dependent cell activation by endotoxin depends on sequential protein-endotoxin and protein-protein interactions between endotoxin, LBP, CD14, MD-2, and TLR4 (1Beutler B.

The transfer of endotoxin from CD14 to MD-2, coupled with binding of MD-2 to TLR4, is apparently required for TLR4 activation by endotoxin (2Gioannini T.L. Teghanemt A. Zhang D. Levis E.N. Weiss J.P.

Chem. 2002; 277: 47818-47825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In contrast, cells expressing TLR4 without MD-2 (e.g. airway epithelial cells) can be potently activated by E·MD-2 complex but not by E·CD14 (17Jia H.P. Kline J.N. Penisten A.

The inability of the monomeric E·MD-2 complex to potently activate cells expressing MD-2·TLR4 is consistent with the inability of endotoxin in E·MD-2 to be readily transferred to MD-2 (bound to TLR4) or the soluble E·MD-2 complex to readily exchange with MD-2 that is bound to TLR4 (9Prohinar P.

Thus, under circumstances (e.g. infection and inflammation) in which increases in MD-2 expression (17Jia H.P. Kline J.N. Penisten A. Apicella M.A. Gioannini T.L. Weiss J. McCray Juniorperiod P.B. Am.

Using endotoxin (lipooligosaccharide; LOS) from an acetate auxotroph of Neisseria meningitidis, which we have previously described (6Giardina P.C. Gioannini T. Buscher B.A. Zaleski A. Zheng D.S. Stoll L. Teghanemt A. Apicella M.A. Weiss J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5883-5891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we show direct transfer of endotoxin from MD-2 to CD14 that, depending on the properties of the host cell and surrounding extracellular fluid, can either attenuate or promote cell activation by endotoxin. These findings thus describe a novel pathway of endotoxin transfer that provides an additional layer of regulation of cell activation by endotoxin.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—LBP and sCD14 were provided by Xoma Corp. (Berkeley, CA) and Amgen Corp. (Thousand Oaks, CA), respectively. Both parental human embryonic kidney HEK293 cells and stable transformants of these cells expressing TLR4 (HEK293/TLR4) were a gift from Dr. Jesse Chow (Eisai Institute, Andover, MA); HEK293/mCD14/MD-2/TLR4 stable cell lines were purchased from InvivoGen, (San Diego, CA). Human serum albumin (HSA) was obtained as an endotoxin-free, 25% stock solution (Baxter Health Care, Glendale, CA). Chromatography matrices (Sephacryl HR S200 and S300, nickel FF-Sepha-rose) were purchased from GE Healthcare. Murine monoclonal anti-CD14 antibodies, MEM18 and MY-4, were purchased from Accurate Chemicals & Scientific Corp. (Westbury, NY), and 18E12 was and a gift from Johnson & Johnson Corp. (New Brunswick, NJ).Recombinant Proteins—Insect-derived soluble MD-2 containing a hexapolyhistidine tag on the C-terminal end was prepared as previously described (11Gioannini T.L. Teghanemt A.

Preparative amounts of the mutant MD-2F126A were generated from infections of High Five insect cells with baculovirus containing the gene for human MD-2F126A inserted into pBAC11. MD-2 cDNA was isolated, linearized, and inserted, using NcoI and XhoI-sensitive restriction sites, into the baculovirus transfection vector pBAC11 (Novagen) that provides a 6-residue polyhistidine (His6) tag at the carboxyl-terminal end of MD-2 and 5′-flanking signal sequence (gp64) to promote secretion of the expressed protein. DNA encoding MD-2F126A was sequenced in both directions to confirm fidelity of the product.The fragment of human TLR4 corresponding to the predicted ectodomain, amino acid residues 24–634, (TLR4ECD) was generated by transient transfection of HEK293T cells. HEK293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Expression vectors containing DNA of interest for production of FLAG-TLR4ECD, amino acids 24–634 (pFLAG-CMV-TLR4), and MD-2-FLAG-His (pEF-BOS) have been previously described and characterized (21Re F. Strominger J.L. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 5272-5276Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with the plasmids (pEF-BOS, pFLAG-CMV) encoding MD-2 or TLR4ECD fused in frame to the coding region of the signal sequences within the plasmid. Conditioned medium was harvested after a 48-h culture. The medium containing the expressed proteins was concentrated 10× using a Millipore Centricon-10 concentrator (Amicon). Control conditioned medium was obtained from HEK293T cells transiently transfected with an empty vector. Cells (∼80% confluence in 6-well plates or T75 flask for preparative amounts of material) were transfected with 4 μg (6-well plate) or 20 μg (T75 flask) of DNA using PolyFect reagent (Qiagen). After 12–16 h, plates were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, and 2 ml of serum-free medium (293 SFM; Invitrogen) plus 0.4% HSA was added. Media containing expressed proteins were collected 24–48 h later and stored at 4 °C until used. The reactivity of conditioned medium containing secreted TLR4ECD/MD-2 maintained reactivity with [3H]LOS·sCD14 for at least 6 months at 4 °C.Preparation of Metabolically Labeled Endotoxins—Lipooligosaccharide ([14C]LOS (600 cpm/ng) or [3H]LOS (5000 cpm/ng)) was isolated after growth and metabolic labeling of an acetate auxotroph of N. meningitides serogroup B as previously described (6Giardina P.C.

An msbB derivative of N. meningitidis serogroup B, NMBA11K3cap–, was obtained from Dr. Michael Apicella (University of Iowa). The strain was grown in minimal medium supplemented with radioactive [3H]acetate or [14C]acetate, and LOS (500 or 80 cpm/ng, respectively) was isolated as previously described (22Post D.M.

[14C]LOS or [3H]LOS aggregates (apparent Mr ∼ 20 million) and [14C]LOS·CD14 or [3H]LOS·CD14 (Mr ∼ 60,000) were prepared and purified by size exclusion chromatography as previously described (6Giardina P.C.

Monomeric [3H]LOS·CD14 complexes (Mr ∼ 60,000) were prepared by treatment of [3H]LOS aggregates for 30 min at 37 °C with substoichiometric LBP (molar ratio 200:1, LOS/LBP) and a 1–1.5-fold molar excess of sCD14 to LOS followed by gel exclusion chromatography (Sephacryl S200; 1.6 × 30 cm) in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, plus 0.03% HSA to isolate monomeric [3H]LOS·sCD14 complex. [3H]LOS·MD-2-His6 (Mr ∼ 25,000) was generated by treatment of [3H]LOS·sCD14 (30 min at 37 °C) with High Five insect cell medium containing either wild-type or F126A MD-2-His6 followed by isolation of [3H]LOS·MD-2 by S200 chromatography (1.6 × 70 cm). To minimize contamination of LOS·MD-2 with any small remaining amount of LOS·sCD14, the peak and downslope fractions of LOS·MD-2 were repurified by Sephacryl S200 using a long column (1.6 × 70 cm) to further increase resolution of LOS·MD-2 from LOS·sCD14.Samples were applied in ≤1-ml fractions and collected (flow rate, 0.3–0.5 ml/min) at room temperature using AKTA or AKTA Purifier FPLC (GE Healthcare). Aliquots of the collected fractions were analyzed by liquid scintillation spectroscopy using a Beckman LS liquid scintillation counter to detect radioactive LOS; recoveries of LOS were ≥70%. All solutions used were pyrogen-free and sterile-filtered. Radiochemical purity of [3H]LOS aggregates was confirmed by Sephacryl S500 chromatography, and that of [3H]LOS·sCD14 and of [3H]LOS·MD-2 was confirmed by Sephacryl S200 chromatography (6Giardina P.C.

After chromatography, selected fractions to be used in bioassays were pooled and sterile-filtered (0.22-μm pore size) with >90% recovery. Fractions were stored under sterile conditions at 4 °C until needed. Sephacryl S200 columns were calibrated with Bio-Rad gel filtration standards that included thyroglobulin, globulin, ovalbumin, myoglobin, vitamin B12, and human serum albumin.Cell Activation Assays—Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were cultured on collagen-coated plasticware (Costar, Cambridge, MA) at 37 °C, 5% CO2, and 95% relative humidity in endothelial basal medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 12 μg/ml bovine brain extract, 10 ng/ml human endothelial growth factor, 1 μg/ml hydrocortisone, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin. HEK293-derived cell lines have been extensively characterized and were cultured, as has been described (18Yang H. Young D.W. Gusovsky F. Chow J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20861-20866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) or according to recommendations of Invivogen Inc. Cells were subcultured and grown to confluence (∼3–5 days) in 96-well plates. Before use in bioassays, confluent monolayers were washed twice with warm phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, to ensure that incubation mixtures were serum-free. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained from heparinized venous blood from healthy donors, with informed consent. Purified PBMC contained ∼80% lymphocytes, 20% monocytes, and <2% polymorphonuclear leukocytes, as previously described (6Giardina P.C. Gioannini T. Buscher B.A. Zaleski A. Zheng D.S. Stoll L.

Washed cells (1 × 105) were incubated for 4–20 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and 95% humidity in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 0.1% HSA (200 μl) with the indicated supplements in 96-well plates. Activation of cells was assessed by measuring accumulation of extracellular IL-8 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Clontech).RESULTSTransfer of Endotoxin from MD-2 to CD14—To test the hypothesis that endotoxin could be transferred from a monomeric E·MD-2 complex to CD14, we first examined the effect of increasing concentrations of sCD14 on the ability of purified LOS·MD-2 to activate HEK293/TLR4 cells. In contrast to E·MD-2, monomeric E·sCD14 does not activate these cells (2Gioannini T.L. Teghanemt A. Zhang D. Levis E.N. Weiss J.P. J. Endotoxin Res. 2005; 11: 117-123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Gioannini T.L. Teghanemt A. Zhang D. Coussens N.P. Dockstader W. Ramaswamy S. Weiss J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4186-4191Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Thus, transfer of endotoxin from E·MD-2 to sCD14 should be accompanied by reduced cell activation.As shown in Fig. 1A, sCD14 produced a dose-dependent inhibition of cell activation by LOS·MD-2 in HEK/TLR4 cells. Nearly complete inhibition by added sCD14 required a 1000–3000-fold molar excess of sCD14 to E·MD-2. There was virtually quantitative conversion of [3H]LOS·MD-2 (Mr ∼ 25,000) to [3H]LOS·sCD14 (Mr ∼ 60,000) under these conditions, as demonstrated by gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 1B) and immuno-co-capture of the generated product with an anti-CD14 antibody (18E12) (16Gioannini T.L. Zhang D. Teghanemt A. Weiss J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47818-47825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) that reacts with CD14 outside of its endotoxin binding site (data not shown). In contrast to the effects of sCD14, LBP had no effect on cell activation by LOS·MD-2 (Fig. 1A) and, even at 3000-fold molar excess, showed no interaction with purified [3H]LOS·MD-2 (Fig. 1B).CD14-dependent Activation by E·MD-2 of Cells Expressing mCD14, MD-2, and TLR4—Although transfer of endotoxin from E·MD-2 to sCD14 inhibited TLR4-dependent activation of cells expressing TLR4 without MD-2 or mCD14, it seemed possible that the same intermolecular transfer of endotoxin could promote activation of cells that expressed mCD14 as well as MD-2 and TLR4. To test this hypothesis, we compared the ability of LOS aggregates plus substoichiometric concentrations of LBP, monomeric LOS·sCD14, and LOS·MD-2 complexes to activate HEK293/mCD14/MD-2/TLR4 cells. Remarkably, LOS·MD-2 was nearly as potent as LOS·sCD14 and at least as potent as LOS aggregates plus LBP in inducing activation of these cells (Fig. 2A). Because mCD14 is very highly expressed in these stable cell transformants, we repeated the same experiments with primary cells (i.e. PBMCs containing human monocytes) expressing mCD14/MD-2/TLR4. Fig. 2B shows that LOS·MD-2 also induced dose-dependent secretion of IL-8 from PBMC (monocytes), although the potency of LOS·MD-2 toward these cells was 3–10-fold less than that of LOS·sCD14. Activation of monocytes by LOS·MD-2 as well as by LOS aggregates plus LBP and by LOS·sCD14 at 10 pm LOS was nearly completely inhibited by an antibody to CD14 (MY-4) that blocks the endotoxin-binding site of CD14 (Fig. 2C). This is consistent with a role for endotoxin transfer from MD-2 to CD14 in activation of monocytes by monomeric LOS·MD-2. Similar observations were made with cultured endothelial cells that express MD-2 and TLR4 and low levels of mCD14 (data not shown) (6Giardina P.C. Gioannini T. Buscher B.A. Zaleski A. Zheng D.S.

Cell activation by LOS·MD-2 was further reduced by pretreatment of the endothelial cells with anti-CD14 antibody (data not shown), strongly suggesting that transfer of LOS from LOS·MD-2 to mCD14 was necessary in these cells as well for maximal activation by LOS·MD-2.FIGURE 2CD14-dependent activation by LOS·MD-2 of cells containing mCD14/MD-2/TLR4. Activation of HEK/CD14/MD-2·TLR4 cells (A), PBMC (B and C), and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC)(D) was measured as LOS-induced extracellular accumulation of IL-8 in cell supernatants after a 20-h incubation by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. (See “Experimental Procedures.”) C, 10 pm LOS was added after cells were preincubated at 4 °C for 30 min in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 0.1% HSA with or without 10 μg/ml anti-CD14 monoclonal antibody MY-4.

LOSagg, LOS aggregates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Contrasting Properties of LOS·MD-2 Complexes Containing either Mutant LOS or Mutant MD-2—We have recently characterized mutant LOS·MD-2 complexes containing either pentaacylated LOS or MD-2F126A that have markedly reduced TLR4 agonist properties when tested with cells expressing only TLR4 (e.g. HEK293/TLR4 cells) (Fig. 3A) (23Teghanemt A.

Biol. Chem. October 30, 2007; 10.1074/jbc.M705994200Google Scholar). These mutant complexes inhibit TLR4 activation by wild-type (WT) LOS·MD-2, indicating that the mutant LOS·MD-2 complexes bind TLR4 but do not efficiently trigger TLR4 activation. If activation of cells expressing mCD14/MD-2/TLR4 by LOS· MD-2 is mediated by transfer of LOS from added LOS·MD-2 to mCD14 and then to membrane MD-2·TLR4, rather than by direct interaction of added LOS·MD-2 with TLR4, a complex containing an underacylated endotoxin species such as LOSmsbB·MD-2WT should still show reduced agonist properties relative to LOSWT·MD-2WT. In contrast, LOSWT·MD-2F126A should activate monocytes as potently as LOSWT·MD-2WT, since LOSWT will be transferred to endogenous MD-2WT. Data presented in Fig. 3B are consistent with this scenario. Dose-dependent activation of PBMCs by LOSWT·MD-2WT and LOSWT·MD-2F126A was nearly identical, whereas that by LOSmsbB·MD-2WT was reduced. These findings strongly suggest that monomeric LOS·MD-2 can potently activate cells expressing mCD14, MD-2, and TLR4 by transferring LOS to mCD14. This conclusion was further supported by a demonstration that activation of PBMC by all three LOS·MD-2 complexes (LOSWT·MD-2WT, LOSWT·MD-2F126A, and LOSmsbB·MD-2WT) was nearly completely inhibited by neutralizing anti-CD14 antibody.FIGURE 3Comparison of the ability of wild-type and variant LOS·MD-2 complexes to induce cell activation. Activation of HEK/TLR4 cells (A) or PBMC (B) by increasing concentrations of LOSWT·MD-2WT (•), LOSmsbB·MD-2WT (♦), or LOSWT·MD-2F126A (○) was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” C, PBMC were preincubated at 4 °C for 30 min in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 0.1% HSA with or without 10 μg/ml"
https://openalex.org/W2055495468,"The enzyme γ-secretase has long been considered a potential pharmaceutical target for Alzheimer disease. Presenilin (the catalytic subunit of γ-secretase) and signal peptide peptidase (SPP) are related transmembrane aspartyl proteases that cleave transmembrane substrates. SPP and γ-secretase are pharmacologically similar in that they are targeted by many of the same small molecules, including transition state analogs, non-transition state inhibitors, and amyloid β-peptide modulators. One difference between presenilin and SPP is that the proteolytic activity of presenilin functions only within a multisubunit complex, whereas SPP requires no additional protein cofactors for activity. In this study, γ-secretase inhibitor radioligands were used to evaluate SPP and γ-secretase inhibitor binding pharmacology. We found that the SPP enzyme exhibited distinct binding sites for transition state analogs, non-transition state inhibitors, and the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug sulindac sulfide, analogous to those reported previously for γ-secretase. In the course of this study, cultured cells were found to contain an abundance of SPP binding activity, most likely contributed by several of the SPP family proteins. The number of SPP binding sites was in excess of γ-secretase binding sites, making it essential to use selective radioligands for evaluation of γ-secretase binding under these conditions.

In addition to the transition state analog inhibitors, there are also non-transition state γ-secretase inhibitors that target presenilin (15Seiffert D. Bradley J.D. Rominger C.M. Rominger D.H.

These compounds are proposed to mediate inhibition through a distinct allosteric site on the basis of inhibitor cross-competition kinetics and radioligand displacement studies (17Tian G.

Differences in binding pharmacology between the transition state analogs and non-transition state inhibitors were also inferred from photolabeling studies (16Morohashi Y. Kan T. Tominari Y. Fuwa H.

As well as the apparent differences in binding pharmacology, the two classes of inhibitors have different effects on the γ-secretase enzyme, such that only the non-transition state inhibitors cause accumulation of enzyme-bound processing intermediates, which are longer forms of Aβ (20Funamoto S.

Thus, the small molecule γ-secretase inhibitors fall into two groups that have different effects on Aβ generation as well as distinct binding characteristics. An additional class of compounds, the “Aβ modulators,” shift the position of the γ-secretase cleavage sites, resulting in Aβ with different C termini. For example, the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) sulindac sulfide increases the production of Aβ-(1–38) while lowering Aβ-(1–42) (25Weggen S. Eriksen J.L. Das P. Sagi S.A. Wang R.

Aβ modulators appear to target yet another distinct binding site on γ-secretase (18Clarke E.E. Churcher I. Ellis S. Wrigley J.D.J. Lewis H.D. Harrison T. Shearman M.S. Beher D. J. Biol.

In contrast to presenilin, which requires additional subunits for enzyme activity, the active SPP enzyme does not require additional subunits for activity (32Nyborg A.C. Kornilova A.Y. Jansen K.

This implies that the additional subunits of γ-secretase, which are essential for enzyme maturation, contribute only to non-catalytic functions, such as the recognition and binding of substrates by nicastrin (35Shah S.

Thus, a variety of small molecules target both presenilin and SPP, but it has not been determined to what extent the inhibitor binding pharmacology is similar for the two enzymes. To address this question, we utilized an active site-directed γ-secretase radioligand (17Tian G. Ghanekar S.V. Aharony D. Shenvi A.B. Jacobs R.T. Liu X. Greenberg B.D. J. Biol.

In the course of this study, we found that SPP family protein binding is abundant in cell homogenates, presenting a challenge to the evaluation of γ-secretase and SPP binding under these conditions. Using this approach, we show that γ-secretase inhibitors exhibit equivalent small molecule binding pharmacology for SPP, implying conserved structure and mechanism in the SPP/presenilin protein family.

Cell Culture—THP-1 cells were grown in roller bottles in RPMI 1640 medium containing l-glutamine (Invitrogen) and 10 μm β-mercaptoethanol to a density of 1 × 106/ml. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and cell pellets were quick-frozen in dry ice/ethanol and stored at –80 °C prior to use. For overexpression of human SPP, HEK293 cells were seeded into T-175 flasks at a density of 13 × 106 cells/flask (Falcon). At 24 h post-seeding, cells were transiently transfected using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 12 μg of SPP cDNA expression construct was diluted in Opti-MEM I (Invitrogen) and then combined with 60 μl of Plus reagent/flask and 90 μl of Lipofectamine reagent/flask. The medium was aspirated from the flasks and replaced with 15 ml of Opti-MEM I. DNA complexes were added to the cells and incubated for 6 h, and then cells were fed growth medium. Cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection by rinsing with 10 ml of Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (Invitrogen catalog no. 14190), followed by scraping into 10 ml of Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were collected by centrifugation, and pellets were frozen and stored at –80 °C. cDNA Expression Construct for SPP—An HM13 Gateway entry clone was purchased from the Invitrogen UltimateORF collection (catalog no. IOH6087). The sequence of this clone was then verified before transfer into the Gateway expression vector pcDNA3.1/Myc-His by site-specific recombination using LR Clonase I (Invitrogen). The vector pcDNA3.1/Myc-His allows for the in-frame addition of a Myc and His6 tag at the C terminus of a protein, but in this case, a stop codon was added to prevent translation of the tag. The resulting clone was completely sequenced to confirm identity to the SPP sequence (GenBank™ accession number BC008959.2). Radioligand Binding Assays—Cell pellets were homogenized in 10 ml of 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.0) with 0.1% mammalian protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma catalog no. P8340) using a Dounce homogenizer at 4 °C. The homogenate was centrifuged at 48,000 × g for 20 min. The pellet was resuspended in buffer to yield a protein concentration of 5 mg/ml. To prepare P2 membranes, cell homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min; the supernatant was centrifuged at 48,000 × g for 30 min; and the pellet was then resuspended in buffer at 5 mg/ml. Protein determinations were carried out using the Bio-Rad protein assay (catalog no. 500-006). [3H]IN973 binding was performed in 50 mm HEPES and 0.1% CHAPSO (pH 7.0) at a concentration of 240 μg/ml total homogenate protein. [3H]L-685,458 binding was carried out in 50 mm MES, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5% CHAPSO (pH 6.5) at protein concentrations of 40 μg/ml for THP-1 cells and 5 μg/ml for human SPP-expressing HEK293 cells. The use of P2 membranes or cell homogenate and different buffer systems were found not to affect the binding parameters (Bmax and Kd) of the two radioligands. The P2 membrane and 0.5% CHAPSO combination was used because it decreased assay variability with the [3H]L-685,458 radioligand. Binding assays were performed in polypropylene 96-deep well plates (Beckman Instruments) in a final volume of 0.25 ml containing 5% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide. Assays were initiated by the addition of 25 μl of assay buffer containing radioligand to 12.5 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide containing various concentrations of unlabeled compounds, followed by 212 μl of cell homogenate. Unless noted otherwise, nonspecific binding was defined in the presence of 1000 nm BMS-433796 for [3H]IN973 or 600 nm unlabeled L-685,458 for [3H]L-685,458. After incubation at 25 °C for 1.5 h, the separation of bound from free radioligand was accomplished by filtration over GF/B glass fiber filters (Brandel, Gaithersburg, MD) presoaked in 0.5% polyethyleneimine and 0.3% Triton X-100 solution (for [3H]L-685,458) or cold wash buffer (for [3H]IN973) using a cell harvester (Brandel). Filters were washed four times with 1.0 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.0) and then assessed for radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting using a Wallac Micro-Beta TriLux (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). IC50 values of competing compounds were calculated using the XLfit program in Microsoft Excel. Equilibrium saturation data were analyzed using the KELL software package (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK). The resulting IC50, Kd, and Bmax values are expressed as the means ± S.E. SPP Enzyme Assay—SPP enzyme activity was measured using the synthetic substrate Prl-PP and Western blotting based on the procedure described by Sato et al. (34Sato T. Nyborg A.C. Iwata N. Diehl T.S. Saido T.C. Golde T.E. Wolfe M.S. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 8649-8656Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Briefly, n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside-solubilized cell extracts were incubated in the assay at a final total extract protein concentration of 0.08 mg/ml with 2 μm Prl-PP peptide substrate for 30 min at 37 °C. Under these conditions, the extent of conversion of substrate to product was confirmed to be time-dependent and dependent on the amount of cell extract used. Cleaved peptide product was separated from Prl-PP substrate by gel electrophoresis in the presence of 8 m urea, followed by chemiluminescence imaging of the Western blot. The structures of the radioligands [3H]L-685,458 (17Tian G. Ghanekar S.V. Aharony D. Shenvi A.B. Jacobs R.T. Liu X. Greenberg B.D. J. Biol.

To evaluate binding of the radioligands to SPP, the SPP protein was overexpressed in HEK293 cells by transient transfection using a cDNA expression vector. Radioligands were added at a concentration of 1.5 nm, and nonspecific binding was determined by the addition of 1 μm unlabeled compound. Homogenates made from SPP-transfected cells showed a 12-fold increase in binding activity for the radioligand [3H]L-685,458 relative to parental vector controls (Fig. 1B), indicating that binding of radioligand to SPP accounted for >90% of the specific signal observed for [3H]L-685,458. In contrast, binding of the selective γ-secretase inhibitor [3H]IN973 was not increased by overexpression of SPP, indicating that this compound did not bind significantly to SPP. To determine the binding parameters, [3H]L-685,458 and [3H]IN973 were added to SPP-overexpressing cell homogenates at a range of concentrations (Fig. 1, C and D). Binding was concentration-dependent and saturable. For [3H]L-685,458, the binding isotherm revealed a single binding site with Kd = 5.1 ± 0.7 nm and Bmax = 96 ± 3.5 pmol/mg of total protein. For [3H]IN973, the binding isotherm exhibited Kd = 0.91 ± 0.02 nm and Bmax = 339 ± 17 fmol/mg of total protein (Fig. 1D), indicating that SPP binding sites were ∼280-fold more abundant than γ-secretase binding sites in this homogenate. To determine whether the SPP-transfected cells expressed increased amounts of active SPP enzyme, enzyme activity was assayed using the synthetic peptide substrate Prl-PP (34Sato T. Nyborg A.C. Iwata N. Diehl T.S. Saido T.C. Golde T.E. Wolfe M.S. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 8649-8656Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). SPP activity was detected only in SPP-transfected cells, whereas the parental vector control cells revealed no detectable activity (Fig. 1E). The threshold for detection of product in this assay was 10% relative to the amount detected in SPP-transfected cells. This indicated an at least 10-fold increase in activity in SPP-transfected cells, consistent with the observed increase in radioligand binding. The SPP inhibitor (Z-LL)2-ketone blocked the activity, albeit at high concentrations (Fig. 1E, lane 7). Additional experiments indicated IC50 values of ∼2 and 10 μm for the inhibitors (Z-LL)2-ketone and L-685,458, respectively, whereas no inhibition was observed in the presence of 10 μm DAPT, BMS-299897, BMS-433796, or IN973 (data not shown). These potencies are lower than those reported previously (31Weihofen A. Lemberg M.K. Friedmann E. Rueeger H. Schmitz A. Paganetti P. Rovelli G. Martoglio B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16528-16533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 34Sato T. Nyborg A.C. Iwata N. Diehl T.S. Saido T.C. Golde T.E. Wolfe M.S. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 8649-8656Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Although we do not understand the exact cause, it seems likely that differences in the assay conditions would provide the explanation. To evaluate the potencies of other compounds in SPP binding, [3H]L-685,458 radioligand was added to SPP-overexpressing cell homogenate at a fixed concentration of 2.5 nm, and inhibition of binding was quantified in the presence of unlabeled compounds. In principle, this approach can be used to calculate dissociation constants; however, to avoid assumptions about the multiple different potential mechanisms represented by this group of compounds, the results of this experiment are presented as IC50 curves (Fig. 2). Potent inhibition of radioligand binding was observed in the presence of the SPP inhibitor (Z-LL)2-ketone and the unlabeled ligand L-685,458. In contrast, low potency inhibition of radioligand binding was observed for the non-transition state analog γ-secretase inhibitor IN973. The radioligand displacement assay results for a range of γ-secretase inhibitors using either the SPP/[3H]L-685,458 or γ-secretase/[3H]IN973 displacement binding assay are summarized in Table 1. Additional non-transition state analogs, including BMS-299897, BMS-433796, and DAPT, showed relatively weak inhibition of SPP radioligand binding, the most potent being BMS-433796 with IC50 = 510 ± 196 nm, indicating a high degree of binding selectivity between SPP and γ-secretase. This is consistent with the relatively weak inhibition of the SPP enzyme reported for this class of inhibitors (32Nyborg A.C. Kornilova A.Y. Jansen K. Ladd T.B. Wolfe M.S. Golde T.E. J. Biol.

At high concentrations, the NSAID sulindac sulfide also inhibited radioligand binding in both SPP/[3H]L-685,458 and γ-secretase/[3H]IN973 binding assays.TABLE 1Summary of IC50 values for inhibition of radioligand bindingCompoundSPP binding [3H]L-685,458 IC50aInhibition of [3H]L-685,458 binding in SPP-overexpressing HEK293 cell homogenate.THP-1 binding [3H]L-685,458 IC50bInhibition of [3H]L-685,458 binding in non-transfected THP-1 cell homogenate.Presenilin binding [3H]IN973 IC50cInhibition of [3H]IN973 binding in non-transfected THP-1 cell homogenate.nmnmnm(Z-LL)2-ketone5.3 ± 1.18.7 ± 3.02060 ± 560L-685,45810 ± 1.14.3 ± 1.072 ± 23IN973560 ± 2001060 ± 2706.4 ± 0.5BMS-29989728,700 ± 950025,600 ± 210012 ± 4.1BMS-433796510 ± 196510 ± 1301.2 ± 0.26DAPT34,200 ± 5000>100,0006.3 ± 1.8Sulindac sulfide45,200 ± 930057,100 ± 12,100332,000 ± 12,000a Inhibition of [3H]L-685,458 binding in SPP-overexpressing HEK293 cell homogenate.b Inhibition of [3H]L-685,458 binding in non-transfected THP-1 cell homogenate.c Inhi"

The endogenous opioid system seems to play a key role in the activities of EtOH, since the opioid antagonist naltrexone (ReVia) attenuates craving. We have investigated the transcriptional regulation of opioid system genes in response to EtOH exposure for up to 96 h in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. We observed a significant decrease in the expression of opioid peptide precursors (proopiomelanocortin, proenkephalin, and prodynorphin) and of the kappa opioid receptor after 48 and 72 h of EtOH exposure (10 and 40 mM). These alterations were not present when the EtOH metabolism was blocked by 4-methylpyrazole. To evaluate whether the effects evoked by EtOH were possibly due to the first product of EtOH metabolism, cells were exposed to 0.4 mM acetaldehyde. We observed the same pattern of changes for prodynorphin, proenkephalin, and the kappa opioid receptor as after 72 h exposure to EtOH. These results contribute to our understanding of EtOH action at a cellular level and provide evidence of the role of acetaldehyde in mediating some of the EtOH-induced effects."

The flux and average energy of precipitating electrons generally decrease with increasing local time across the nightside, consistent with a possible source region along the dusk flank of Jupiter's magnetosphere. Visible emissions associated with the interaction of Jupiter and its satellite Io extend to a surprisingly high altitude, indicating localized low-energy electron precipitation. These results indicate that the interaction between Jupiter's upper atmosphere and near-space environment is variable and poorly understood; extensive observations of the day side are no guide to what goes on at night."

BphD catalyzes an unusual carbon-carbon bond hydrolysis of 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-6-phenylhexa-2,4-dienoic acid (HOPDA), in which the substrate is subject to histidine-mediated enol-keto tautomerization prior to hydrolysis. Chlorinated HOPDAs such as 3-Cl HOPDA inhibit BphD. Here we report that BphD preferentially hydrolyzed a series of 3-substituted HOPDAs in the order H > F > Cl > Me, suggesting that catalysis is affected by steric, not electronic, determinants. Transient state kinetic studies performed using wild-type BphD and the hydrolysis-defective S112A variant indicated that large 3-substituents inhibited His-265-catalyzed tautomerization by 5 orders of magnitude. Structural analyses of S112A·3-Cl HOPDA and S112A·3,10-diF HOPDA complexes revealed a non-productive binding mode in which the plane defined by the carbon atoms of the dienoate moiety of HOPDA is nearly orthogonal to that of the proposed keto tautomer observed in the S112A·HOPDA complex. Moreover, in the 3-Cl HOPDA complex, the 2-hydroxo group is moved by 3.6 Å from its position near the catalytic His-265 to hydrogen bond with Arg-190 and access of His-265 is blocked by the 3-Cl substituent. Nonproductive binding may be stabilized by interactions involving the 3-substituent with non-polar side chains. Solvent molecules have poor access to C6 in the S112A·3-Cl HOPDA structure, more consistent with hydrolysis occurring via an acyl-enzyme than a gem-diol intermediate.

Although banned in the United States since 1977, environmentally persistent PCBs have been linked to cancer (2Knerr S. Schrenk D. Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 2006; 36: 663-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), childhood neurodevelopmental deficits arising from prenatal exposure (3Jacobson J.L. Jacobson S.W. N. Engl. J.

Toxicol. 2004; 19: 5-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Indeed, concerns about high concentrations of PCBs and other contaminants in some freshwater fish have prompted a recent comprehensive risk-benefit analysis of fish consumption (5Mozaffarian D. Rimm E.B. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 2006; 296: 1885-1899Crossref PubMed Scopus (1524) Google Scholar).The observation that bacteria partially degrade PCBs has motivated research into microbial bioremediation as an alternative to traditional remediation approaches, which typically require the costly and invasive removal of contaminated soil. Bacteria use the biphenyl (Bph) pathway to aerobically degrade many PCBs in a strain-dependent manner. The upper Bph pathway consists of four enzymes that transform biphenyl into benzoic acid and 2-hydroxypenta-2,4-dienoic acid (6Pieper D.H. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2005; 67: 170-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, certain congeners are not efficiently degraded by this pathway, leading to the accumulation of these congeners or their chlorinated metabolites and even inhibition of Bph enzymes. For example, 2′,6′-diCl 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl (2′,6′-diCl-DHB) inhibits the third pathway enzyme, DHB dioxygenase (DHBD) in the potent PCB-degrading strain Burkholderia xenovorans LB400 (7Dai S.D.

Specifically, homologues of the Bph enzymes are involved in cholesterol catabolism (15Van der Geize R. Yam K. Heuser T. Wilbrink M.H. Hara H. Anderton M.C. Sim E. Dijkhuizen L. Davies J.E. Mohn W.W. Eltis L.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 1947-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar) and are critical for the survival of the pathogen in the human macrophage (16Rengarajan J. Bloom B.R. Rubin E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 8327-8332Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). The lack of human homologues of the cholesterol-degrading enzymes suggests that they are promising drug targets. Understanding the mechanism of BphD inhibition will facilitate the engineering of the enzyme to improve its activity toward chlorinated substrates and should inform the development of inhibitors of HsaD, the cholesterol-degrading homologue in M. tuberculosis.BphD catalyzes the hydrolytic C-C bond cleavage of HOPDA (Fig. 1) and has features typical of the α/β-hydrolase superfamily (17Holmquist M.

Indeed, His-265-dependent formation of an intermediate with a red-shifted absorbance spectrum (E·Sred) is formed at a similar rate in both WT and S112A BphDs (19Horsman G.P. Bhowmik S. Seah S.Y.K.

Specifically, 5-chlorination reduced the maximal rate of BphD by 3-fold, and chlorination at the 3 or 4 positions reduced the maximal rate by ∼103 and ∼104-fold, respectively. Although 4-Cl HOPDA is the least efficiently transformed monochlorinated HOPDA, 3-Cl HOPDAs represent a more significant roadblock to PCB degradation in two respects. First, 3-Cl HOPDA (t½ ∼ 500 h) is more stable than 4-Cl HOPDA, which undergoes a non-enzymatic transformation to 4-OH HOPDA (t½ = 2.8 h) followed by degradation to products that include acetophenone (t½ ∼ 180 h) (8Seah S.Y.K.

Second, 3-Cl HOPDA is a very poor substrate of BphDLB400, effectively inhibiting the hydrolysis of HOPDA (Kic = 0.57 μm) more potently than either 4-Cl HOPDA (Kic = 3.6 μm) or 4-OH HOPDA (Kic = 0.95 μm). It has been unclear whether the 3-Cl substituent impairs tautomerization or hydrolysis and whether the defect is due to an electronic or steric effect.Herein we investigated the basis for inhibition of BphD by 3-Cl HOPDA. First, the ability of BphD to hydrolyze a series of 3-substituted HOPDAs was studied using steady-state kinetics to compare steric versus electronic effects. Second, single turnover stopped-flow kinetic analysis was used to probe the effects of 3-substitution on E·Sred formation in both WT and hydrolytically impaired Ser112Ala variants. Finally, crystal structures of the S112A·3-Cl HOPDA and S112A·3,10-diF-HOPDA complexes were analyzed to reveal the structural correlates of the kinetic behavior.MATERIALS AND METHODSChemicals—HOPDA, 3-Cl HOPDA, 3-Me HOPDA, and 3,10-diF HOPDA were enzymatically generated from DHB, 4-Cl DHB, 4-Me DHB, and 4,4′-diF DHB, respectively, using DHBD as previously described (8Seah S.Y.K.

The preparation of DHB and chlorinated DHBs has been described elsewhere (29Nerdinger S. Kendall C. Marchhart R. Riebel P. Johnson M.R. Yin C.F. Eltis L.D. Snieckus V. Chem. Commun. 1999; : 2259-2260Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). All other chemicals were of analytical grade.Preparation of 4,4′-diF DHB—A plate of W medium (30Seto M. Kimbara K. Shimura M. Hatta T. Fukuda M. Yano K. Appl. Environ. Microb. 1995; 61: 3353-3358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was streaked with frozen stock of Pandoraea pnomenusa (formerly Comamonas testosteroni) B-356 and incubated with biphenyl crystals in the lid at 30 °C until colonies were visible (∼5 days). Several colonies were added to 3 ml of W medium containing 1 mg biphenyl and incubated at 30 °C and 250 rpm until cloudy (∼4 days). Alternatively, this step could be shortened to ∼2 days if a 50-μl aliquot of frozen stock was used to inoculate the 3 ml of culture. One liter of W medium containing 0.5 g of biphenyl in a 2-liter flask was inoculated with 1 ml of starter culture, and the mixture was incubated as above. When the optical density at 600 nm reached 1, the culture was carefully decanted to remove biphenyl crystals and then centrifuged for 10 min at 7000 × g. The pellet was washed two times with potassium phosphate buffer (I = 0.1 m, pH 7.5) to remove residual biphenyl and resuspended in 500 ml of buffer supplemented with 100 mg of 4,4′-diF-biphenyl and 7 mg of 3-chlorocatechol. The latter was included to inactivate DHBD (31Vaillancourt F.H. Labbe G. Drouin N.M. Fortin P.D. Eltis L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2019-2027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and thereby prevent enzymatic transformation of the produced 4,4′-diF-DHB. The culture was incubated as above, and 50-μl aliquots were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography at 30-min intervals using a Prodigy ODS Prep column, 2.1 × 250 mm (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA), operating at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. The mobile phase initially consisted of a 30:70 ratio of solvent A (0.5% aqueous H3PO4) to solvent B (methanol) for the first 5 min of the run, then a gradient was used to achieve 100% B at 10 min. The retention time of 3-chlorocatechol was 2.6 min, 4,4′-diF-DHB eluted at 5.4 min, and 4,4′-diF-biphenyl eluted at 13 min. When the maximum concentration of 4,4′-diF-DHB in the culture was reached as judged by high-performance liquid chromatography (after ∼3 h), the culture was filtered to remove undissolved starting material, and then extracted three times with ∼200 ml of ethyl acetate. The pooled fractions were dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and rotary evaporated to dryness. The crude extract was dissolved in an appropriate volume of mobile phase (20:80 A:B ratio) and purified by preparative high-performance liquid chromatography using a Prodigy ODS Prep column, 21.2 × 250 mm (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) operating at a flow rate of 8.5 ml/min. The 4,4′-diF-DHB (retention time ∼ 8 min) was collected, extracted into ethyl acetate, dried, and evaporated as above. The purity was estimated to be >95% by high-performance liquid chromatography. The 4,4′-diF-DHB was dissolved in 10% ethanol, 80% H2O, and 10% D2O to collect NMR spectra at 25 °C using a 600-MHz spectrometer at the Department of Chemistry, University of Rochester. The 1H NMR reference compound was 100 μm 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane 5-sulfonate and was used as an indirect reference for 19F NMR (found by 19F{1H} NMR: -3.6 (s, 1F), -23.9 (s, 1F)) and 1H NMR (6.75-6.82 (m, 2H), 7.21 (t, 2H, J = 6 Hz), 7.52 (t, 2H, J = 6 Hz)).Steady-state Kinetic Measurements—Initial rates of BphD-catalyzed hydrolysis at varying substrate concentrations were obtained by monitoring the substrate absorbance maximum versus time in potassium phosphate buffer (I = 0.1 m, pH 7.5) using a Varian Cary 5000 spectrophotometer equipped with a thermostatted cuvette holder (Varian Canada, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) maintained at 25.0 ± 0.5 °C, controlled by Cary WinUV software version 2.00. Reactions were carried out in a 1-ml volume and were initiated by the addition of 5 μl of an appropriately diluted enzyme solution. The 3-Me HOPDA was generated in situ by adding 80 μg of polyhistidine-tagged DHBD to the cuvette containing 4-Me DHB. After obtaining the rate of background decay (0.5-1 min), BphD was added and the activity of the enzyme was determined by correcting for the background. The Michaelis-Menten equation was fit to the data using LEONORA (32Cornish-Bowden A. Analysis of Enzyme Kinetic Data. Oxford University Press, New York1995Google Scholar). The molar absorptivity of 3,10-diF HOPDA (ϵ438 = 37.9 ± 2.1 mm-1 cm-1) was calculated from its absorption spectrum after quantification by measuring the amount of dioxygen consumed in the ring-opening reaction of 4,4′-diF DHB catalyzed by DHBD. Dioxygen consumption was measured using a Clark-type polarographic oxygen electrode (Yellow Springs Instruments model 5301, Yellow Springs, OH) as previously described for other HOPDAs (33Seah S.Y.K.

The molar absorptivity of 3-Me HOPDA (ϵ430 = 18.7 ± 0.4 mm-1 cm-1) was determined by recording the absorption spectrum of a known quantity of 4-Me DHB immediately after cleavage by DHBD.Stopped-flow Spectrophotometry—Single turnover reactions (BphD = 8 μm; substrate = 4 μm) in the phosphate buffer described above were monitored using an SX.18MV stopped-flow reaction analyzer (Applied Photophysics Ltd., Leatherhead, UK) equipped with a photodiode array detector. The drive syringe chamber and optical cell were maintained at 25 °C by a recirculating water system. Multiple wavelength data from the time courses of single shots were acquired using the Xscan software (Applied Photophysics Ltd.), then saved as CSV files in the RISC Pro-K software and exported to Excel where replicate measurements from at least four shots were averaged. Selected single wavelength datasets were then imported into the SX18MV software (Applied Photophysics Ltd.) where multiple exponential equations were fit to the data to obtain reciprocal relaxation times and amplitudes. Good fits were characterized by random variation in the residuals.Crystallization and Preparation of Complexes—Crystals of the substrate-free S112A variant of BphD were grown at 20 °C in 1.9 m sodium malonate, pH 7.0, by sitting drop vapor diffusion, as previously reported (19Horsman G.P. Bhowmik S. Seah S.Y.K. Kumar P. Bolin J.T. Eltis L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 19894-19904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Complexes were prepared by incubating crystals for 30 min in 60 μl of reservoir solution supplemented with ∼10 mm 3-Cl-HOPDA or ∼65 mm 3,10-difluoro-HOPDA. Crystals were prepared for flash freezing by serial transfer into solutions containing higher concentrations of sodium malonate (3.4 m and 3.7 m, pH 7.0) augmented with ∼5 mm of 3-Cl HOPDA or trace amounts of 3,10-difluoro-HOPDA. The incubation time was 3-6 s per step. Crystals were frozen by immersion in liquid N2.Diffraction Experiments and Structure Analysis—All diffraction data were acquired by the use of the SERCAT facilities at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. The x-ray wavelength was 1.0 Å, and crystals were maintained at ∼100 K during data collection. Diffraction images were recorded by a MarMosaic 300 charge-coupled device detector (Mar USA, Inc., Evanston, IL). For each crystal, ∼100 frames were collected with a 1° rotation per frame; exposure times were 1-10 s per degree. All images were processed using DENZO, and intensities were merged and scaled using SCALEPACK; both programs were from the HKL2000 program suite (34Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38361) Google Scholar).The initial model for both complexes included only the protein atoms from the crystal structure of the S112A·malonate complex (PDB code 2PU6) (19Horsman G.P.

The bond lengths and bond angles of the ligands were restrained to values expected for the enol isomer. Torsion angles in the non-aromatic portion of the substrates were unrestrained. The stereochemical properties of the models and the hydrogen bonding were analyzed by using the programs PROCHECK (39Laskowski R. MacArthur M. Moss D. Thornton J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) and REDUCE (40Word J.M. Lovell S.C. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1735-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar).RESULTSSteady-state Kinetics—To assess the basis of inhibition of BphD by 3-Cl HOPDA, the enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of 3,10-diF HOPDA and 3-Me HOPDA was studied using steady-state kinetics. The 10-fluoro substituent is not expected to greatly affect catalysis because HOPDAs with small, electron-withdrawing substituents (e.g. -Cl and -CF3) at this position are hydrolyzed by BphD with kcat values within 25% of that for HOPDA (8Seah S.Y.K.

Chem. Commun. 2002; : 2304-2305Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Significantly, reduction of the volume of the electronegative 3-substituent by 40% upon chlorine-to-fluorine substitution resulted in a 150-fold increase in kcat (Table 1), indicating that larger 3-substituents interfere with catalysis. This conclusion was supported by the observation that the substrate with the largest 3-substituent, 3-Me HOPDA, had the lowest apparent kcat (Table 1). Although a Km value was reported for 3-Cl HOPDA (8Seah S.Y.K. Labbé G. Nerdinger S. Johnson M.R. Snieckus V. Eltis L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15701-15708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), Km could not be determined for 3-Me HOPDA due to a combination of lower activity, lower molar absorptivity, and higher background decay rates, which together prevented reliable initial rate measurements at low substrate concentrations. Finally, we also determined the stability of HOPDAs in the enzyme reaction buffer (Table 1), but we discerned no obvious correlation between either the electronegativity of the substituents and the nonenzymatic decomposition, or between the nonenzymatic and enzymatic reactions. In conclusion, kcat was strongly anticorrelated with the volume of the substituent at C3 and uncorrelated with electronegativity over the series of HOPDAs studied, suggesting that turnover is largely dictated by steric, not electronic, factors.TABLE 1Steady-state parameters of BphD hydrolysis of 3-substituted HOPDAs Errors are less than 15%.3-X HOPDAHalf-lifeElectronegativityaFrom Ref. 43VolumebFrom Ref. 44C-X bond lengthcFrom Ref. 45kcatKmkcat/KmXhÅ3Ås-1μmμm-1 s-1H58dFrom Ref. 82.27.21.086.50.232F114.113.31.341.44.80.29Cl500dFrom Ref. 82.822.51.730.00890.540.016Me302.3eFrom Ref. 4628.41.510.0036fEstimated from initial rate measurements at high substrate concentrations ([S] » Km)NDgND, not determinedNDa From Ref. 43Allred A.L.

In a previous single turnover ([E] > [S]) stopped-flow experiment using WT BphD and HOPDA, we observed rapid (∼500 s-1) formation of E·Sred (λmax = 492 nm) from the free HOPDA enolate (λmax = 434 nm) (Fig. 2E) (20Horsman G.P.

In contrast, E·Sred did not accumulate when 3-Cl HOPDA was used as a substrate (Fig. 2A). Under single turnover conditions ([BphD] = 8 μm, [3-Cl HOPDA] = 4 μm), an initial decrease (1/τ1 = 15 s-1) occurred at the absorbance maximum of the 3-Cl HOPDA enolate (432 nm) (Table 2).

Bakker E.P. Guy H.R. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 775-788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 3Nakamura T. Yuda R. Unemoto T. Bakker E.P. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3491-3494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Some of the members of the superfamily, including KtrAB, are thought to be either Na+/K+ or H+/K+ symporters (1Durell S.R. Hao Y. Nakamura T. Bakker E.P. Guy H.R. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 775-788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 3Nakamura T. Yuda R. Unemoto T. Bakker E.P. J.

Sequence homology and hydrophobicity profiles have led to the proposal that all membrane proteins in this superfamily adopt the architecture of the ion pore of potassium channels (1Durell S.R. Hao Y. Nakamura T. Bakker E.P. Guy H.R. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 775-788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 2Tholema N. Bakker E.P. Suzuki A. Nakamura T. FEBS Lett. 1999; 450: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). One KtrB polypeptide is thought to contain four repeats of the TM-Ploop-TM structural motif observed in potassium channels, such as KcsA (7Doyle D.A. Morais Cabral J. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5770) Google Scholar, 8Zhou Y. Morais-Cabral J.H. Kaufman A. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2001; 414: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (1739) Google Scholar). The repeats, labeled A to D in Fig. 1A, do not have the same sequence, except for a few conserved positions (Fig. 1B), and are connected by relatively large cytoplasmic loops (15–36 residues), which show no similarity to one another. The experimentally determined transmembrane topology of HKT1 from Arabidopsis thaliana revealed 8 TMs that agree well with a KcsA-like architecture (9Kato Y. Sakaguchi M. Mori Y. Saito K. Nakamura T. Bakker E.P. Sato Y. Goshima S. Uozumi N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6488-6493Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Moreover, members of the superfamily tend to have one or more conserved glycine residues in the regions equivalent to the potassium channel selectivity filter sequence GYG (glycine-tyrosine-glycine) (1Durell S.R. Hao Y. Nakamura T. Bakker E.P. Guy H.R. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 775-788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 2Tholema N. Bakker E.P. Suzuki A. Nakamura T. FEBS Lett. 1999; 450: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). Mutation of these conserved glycines in either the KtrB or HKT proteins has been shown to cause changes in the transport properties as expected if these residues form part of the transport pathway (2Tholema N. Bakker E.P. Suzuki A. Nakamura T. FEBS Lett. 1999; 450: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 10Maser P. Hosoo Y. Goshima S. Horie T. Eckelman B. Yamada K. Yoshida K. Bakker E.P.

Although the evidence described above is compelling, to our knowledge there have been no published biochemical or biophysical studies that directly probe the three-dimensional properties of these proteins, a gap that has limited our understanding of this superfamily. Recently we provided evidence that the KtrB membrane protein from Bacillus subtilis is a dimer in the membrane and in detergent, that the KtrA regulatory protein is an octamer able to adopt different shapes, and that the transporter complex consists of a KtrB dimer bound to a KtrA octamer (4Albright R.A. Ibar J.L. Kim C.U. Gruner S.M. Morais-Cabral J.H. Cell. 2006; 126: 1147-1159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In that work, light scattering studies were used to determine the dimeric state of detergent-solubilized KtrB and one amino group cross-linker DSP (dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate)) was utilized to confirm that KtrB was a dimer in the membrane. Here we report substantially expanded cross-linking studies on KtrB with the aim of determining whether the structure is consistent, as has been hypothesized, with the architecture observed in potassium channels. We use several different cross-linkers to confirm the dimer state in B. subtilis and test whether the homo-dimeric organization appears to be a general property of membrane proteins in the KtrAB transporter family. In addition, bifunctional cross-linkers of various lengths are used in conjunction with a series of single-site cysteine mutants to evaluate the relative distances across the dimer interface. We conclude that the observed cross-linking patterns for the extracellular protein regions fit well with a model of two side-by-side KcsA potassium channel molecules; however, data from the cytoplasmic regions reveal structural differences between KtrB and potassium channels. KtrB Cloning—KtrB genes from B. subtilis (GI:2635594), Bacillus halodurans (GI:15613161), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (GI:66876889) and KtrA from B. subtilis (GI:2635593) were defined by homology to Vibrio alginolyticus KtrB and KtrA (3Nakamura T. Yuda R. Unemoto T. Bakker E.P. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3491-3494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The genes were synthesized from genomic DNA using PCR and cloned into the pET24d expression vector (kanamycin resistance), which adds a C-terminal His tag. KtrB from B. subtilis was also cloned into pET24d with a stop codon before the His tag sequence. C-terminally truncated KtrBs (ending at 435 and 430, and 10 and 15 residue truncations, respectively) were cloned into pET15b (ampicillin resistance) with an N-terminal His tag. Tagging either terminus does not alter the oligomeric state of the molecule. A dicistronic vector pKCeAB containing KtrB and KtrA from B. subtilis was constructed based on the pccKAN vector (ampicillin resistance) (12Russ W.P. Engelman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 863-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) for constitutive low level protein expression. QuikChange (Stratagene) was used to introduce single cysteine mutations in the B. subtilis KtrB gene (construct without a tag). Expression and Purification—Membrane proteins were expressed in the Escherichia coli strain C41(DE3) (13Miroux B. Walker J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar) at 37 °C after a 1.5-h induction with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cell pellets from 1 liter of growth were resuspended in 12.5 ml of buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 30 mm KCl, protease inhibitors); after cell lysis protein was extracted with 40 mm dodecyl maltoside, followed by a 45-min spin at 34,500 × g. The supernatant was loaded onto 1 ml of Talon resin cobalt-agarose beads (Clontech) pre-washed with 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 30 mm KCl, 1 mm dodecyl maltoside; loaded beads were washed with same buffer plus 20 mm imidazole. Protein was eluted with the same buffer plus 150 mm imidazole, and the tag was removed by overnight incubation with thrombin while dialyzing against the buffer below. The protein was concentrated and loaded into a Superdex 200 size-exclusion chromatography column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 30 mm KCl, 1 mm dodecyl maltoside, 1 mm dithiothreitol. Radioactivity Uptake Assay—1.1 mg of E. coli polar lipids (Avanti) solubilized in chloroform were dried under a nitrogen stream, resuspended in pentane, and dried again. The lipids were then resuspended in 110 μl of high potassium buffer (450 mm KCl, 10 mm Hepes, 4 mm N-methylglucamine, pH 7.4) by bath sonication. The detergent CHAPS was added to a final concentration of 34 mm, and the bath was sonicated and left to stand for 2 h for complete solubilization. Protein (5–10 μg) solubilized in dodecyl maltoside was added, and the mixture was incubated for 5 min at room temperature. To form liposomes the mixture was passed through a spin column with 1.5 ml of G-50 beads swollen in high potassium buffer. Liposomes were subsequently passed through a spin column with 1.5-ml G-50 beads swollen with a low potassium buffer (450 mm sorbitol, 10 mm Hepes, 4 mm N-methylglucamine, pH 7.4). The assay was initiated by mixing 80 μl of liposome preparation to 100 μl of radioactive tracer (50 μm KCl in low potassium buffer plus 86Rb+ (at ∼2000 counts per microliter)). Time points were taken by loading 70 μl of reaction mixture into a 1.5-ml Dowex cation exchange column, pre-washed with 2 ml of a solution containing 6% sucrose and 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and equilibrated with 2 ml of 6% sucrose solution; finally, the Dowex matrix was washed with 1.5 ml of 6% sucrose solution. The eluate was collected in a scintillation vial and mixed with 15 ml of scintillation fluid. At the end of each experiment, valinomycin (a potassium and rubidium ionophore) was added to the remainder of liposome preparations, and the mixture was incubated for a couple of minutes; 70 μl were then loaded into the Dowex matrix as described above. Normalization of rubidium uptake was done by dividing protein-mediated uptake by total uptake from valinomycin treatment. Polyclonal Antibodies—Polyclonal antibodies against B. subtilis KtrB were obtained by injecting rabbits with purified protein. Serum was collected and pre-purified by incubation with an acetone E. coli powder for 30 min at 4 °C; this procedure removes some of the contaminant antibodies that target E. coli proteins. Antibodies were affinity-purified in the presence of detergent on a KtrB-coupled AminoLink Plus agarose gel (Pierce), prepared according to manufacturer instructions. Membrane Preparations and Cross-linking Experiments—A cell pellet from 100 ml of E. coli culture expressing KtrB was resuspended in buffer and lysed by two passages through an Emulsiflex-C5 cell-cracker (Avestin). Membranes were prepared after a low speed 10-min spin at 10,000 rpm (rotor SS34), 4 °C followed by a high speed spin at 50,000 rpm (rotor Ti-70) for 1.5 h at 4 °C. Pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of buffer, and total protein concentration was determined by a colorimetric assay (Bio-Rad). For non-directed cross-linking experiments the proteins were expressed with a C-terminal His tag. The buffer used for membrane preparation was phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.5. The suspension was diluted to 0.5 mg/ml total protein concentration, cross-linkers (stock at 25 mm in Me2SO) were added to membrane aliquots, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The amino group-reactive cross-linkers used were: disuccinimidyl glutarate (DSG), DSP, 3,3′-dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidyl propionate) (DTSSP), and ethyleneglycol bis(succinimidylsuccinate) (EGS) (Pierce). Reactions were stopped by addition of Tris buffer solution (pH 7.5) to a final concentration of 100 mm and incubated for 15 min. Samples were run in a SDS-PAGE, blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and probed with an anti-His tag monoclonal antibody (Qiagen). For directed cross-linking experiments KtrB cysteine mutants were expressed without a His tag. The buffer used in these experiments was 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA. Membrane preparations were resuspended at 2 mg/ml total protein concentration. Methanethiosulfonate (MTS) bifunctional cross-linkers: 1,3-propanediyl bismethanethiosulfonate (M3M), 1,5-pentanediyl bismethanethiosulfonate (M5M), and 3,6,9,12,15-pentaoxaheptadecane-1,17-diyl bismethanethiosulfonate (M17M), from Toronto Research Chemicals Inc., were dissolved in Me2SO at 5 mm and added to the membranes at 50 μm concentration. After 1-h incubation, at room temperature or on ice, reactions were stopped by addition of N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) to 10 mm. Stop reagent efficiency was tested by adding 10 mm NEM and M17M cross-linker at roughly the same time to the samples for 1 h. Samples were run via SDS-PAGE, blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and probed with anti-KtrB polyclonal antibody. Before probing the KtrB membrane blot, polyclonal antibodies were further purified by 1-h incubation with a preparation of E. coli membranes not containing KtrB protein blotted on a membrane. Molecular weight standards used in Western blots were MagicMark XP (Invitrogen). Complementation Assay—Wild-type KtrA and KtrB C-terminal mutants (or wild type) were generated in the pKCeAB dicistronic vector. E. coli TK2420 strain (a gift from W. Epstein, University of Chicago) was transformed with the dicistronic vector and plated onto LBK agar plates (10 g/liter Tryptone, 5 g/liter Yeast extract, 10 g/liter KCl) containing 100 mg/liter ampicillin. Media and growth strategies used were patterned after those reported by Tholema et al. (10Maser P. Hosoo Y. Goshima S. Horie T. Eckelman B. Yamada K. Yoshida K. Bakker E.P. Shinmyo A. Oiki S. Schroeder J.I. Uozumi N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6428-6433Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). For wild-type KtrAB, mutants and the negative control (an empty pKCe vector), two colonies were picked and grown overnight at 37 °C in 10 ml of minimal media containing 30 mm K+ (see below). Small inoculums (1:300) were then used to initiate growths in media at eight different K+ concentrations: 0.1, 0.3, 1, 2, 6, 10, 30, and 115 mm. After growing overnight, the optical density at 595 nm was measured. The minimal media used consisted of a 69 mm sodium/potassium phosphate buffer, pH ∼7, plus 8 mm (NH4)2S04, 400 μm MgSO4, 6 μm FeSO4, 1 mm sodium citrate, 1 mg/liter thiamine HCl, 2 g/liter glucose, 10 mg/liter CaCl2, 6 μm ferric chloride. A fixed ratio of hydrogen phosphate to dihydrogen phosphate was used, keeping the pH and overall phosphate concentration constant even as the K+:Na+ ratios were varied. Phosphate component concentrations (K2HPO4, KH2PO4, Na2HPO4, NaH2PO4, respectively) used for the various target K+ concentrations were: 0.1 mm K+ (40 μm, 20 μm, 46 mm, and 23 mm); 0.3 mm K+ (120 μm, 60 μm, 45.9 mm, and 22.9 mm); 1 mm K+ (400 μm, 200 μm, 45.6 mm, and 22.8 mm); 2 mm K+ (800 μm, 400 μm, 45.2 mm, and 22.6 mm); 6 mm K+ (2.4 mm, 1.2 mm, 43.6 mm, and 21.8 mm); 10 mm K+ (4 mm, 2 mm, 42 mm, and 21 mm); 30 mm K+ (12 mm, 6 mm, 34 mm, and 17 mm); and 115 mm K+ (46 mm K2HPO4 and 23 mm KH2PO4). Solutions were filtered (0.2 μm), and ampicillin from a 1000× stock was added just prior to use to give a final concentration of 80 mg/liter. Light Scattering Studies—Samples of KtrB mutants (at 1.5 mg/ml) in which the C-terminal tail was truncated were loaded onto a Superdex 200 size-exclusion column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris (pH 8.5), 120 mm NaCl, 30 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm dodecyl maltoside. Light scattering, UV absorbance, and refractive index measurements were performed on the eluted peaks. The protein molecular weight was determined in thin slices across the elution peak by combinations of these measurements as described in the literature (14Arakawa T. Langley K.E. Kameyama K. Takagi T. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 15Folta-Stogniew E. Williams K.M. J. Biomol. Techniques. 1999; 10: 51-63PubMed Google Scholar, 16Folta-Stogniew E.

Dimerization Is a General Property of KtrB Membrane Proteins—The predicted solvent-exposed loops of the B. subtilis KtrB membrane protein have a total of 17 lysine residues (14 cytoplasmic and 3 extracellular), all of which are potential reacting sites for amino-group cross-linkers. Amino group cross-linkers have been successfully applied in the determination of the oligomeric state of membrane proteins such as the trimeric glutamate transporters and copper uptake transporters (17Yernool D. Boudker O. Folta-Stogniew E. Gouaux E. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12981-12988Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 19Aller S.G. Eng E.T. De Feo C.J. Unger V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53435-53441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In these cases where proteins exist in higher oligomeric states, increasing concentrations of the cross-linking reagent resulted in the unambiguous emergence of a strong final-state (trimer) band well before the monomer band disappeared. If any weak transient dimer band was observed, it was only in the presence of a substantial trimer band and faded before the monomer band disappeared. We have previously shown (4Albright R.A. Ibar J.L. Kim C.U. Gruner S.M. Morais-Cabral J.H. Cell. 2006; 126: 1147-1159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) that addition of the bifunctional amino-group cross-linker DSP (spacer arm, 12 Å) to E. coli membranes containing the B. subtilis KtrB membrane protein results in the appearance of a band on a Western blot that corresponds to a KtrB dimer. We now demonstrate that other bifunctional amino-group cross-linkers with different spanning lengths and chemical properties: disuccinimidyl glutarate (spacer arm, 7.7 Å), 3,3′-dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidyl propionate) (spacer arm, 12 Å), and ethyleneglycol bis(succinimidylsuccinate) (spacer arm, 16 Å), have the same effect. Western blots (Fig. 2A) show that increasing concentrations of these compounds result in a reduction in the intensity of a band migrating between 30 and 40 kDa, consistent with a KtrB monomer (expected molecular mass, 49 kDa), and a corresponding increase of a band that migrates between 60 and 80 kDa, equivalent to a dimer. Importantly, even though there are numerous reactive sites on each KtrB molecule, no other discrete bands are detected that may correspond to higher order oligomers. A further increase cross-linker concentration only results in a rise of nonspecific links with a variety of other proteins in the membrane. The KtrB protein was overexpressed in E. coli, extracted with dodecyl maltoside and purified by affinity chromatography followed by size-exclusion chromatography, where it migrates as a single peak (Fig. 2B). We have recently shown by light scattering coupled to refractive index and UV absorbance measurements that the protein in this peak forms a homo-dimer (4Albright R.A. Ibar J.L. Kim C.U. Gruner S.M. Morais-Cabral J.H. Cell. 2006; 126: 1147-1159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), corroborating the cross-linking results. Our previous observation that solubilized KtrB is able to specifically bind KtrA (4Albright R.A. Ibar J.L. Kim C.U. Gruner S.M. Morais-Cabral J.H. Cell. 2006; 126: 1147-1159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) demonstrates that the presence of detergent does not cause a loss of the protein native properties. To determine whether the purified protein retains its functional properties, we reconstituted purified KtrB into liposomes and performed a radioactivity uptake assay. The assay is equivalent to the one used in the characterization of the KcsA potassium channel; briefly, proteoliposomes loaded with 450 mm potassium are exchanged into a solution with a low potassium concentration (50 μm). If the protein is a potassium transporter, it will mediate the flow of K+ ions, but not their counterions, down the concentration gradient, thereby establishing a difference potential across the membrane. When 86Rb+, a good substitute for K+, is added to the external solution, it is driven into the proteoliposomes by the electrical gradient. Fig. 2C shows that uptake of rubidium is protein concentration-dependent. A time course (Fig. 2D) shows that uptake by KtrB is slow and that even after 20-min saturation has not been reached. These data were fitted with a double exponential with time constants of ∼2 min (amplitude, 0.034) and ∼120 min (amplitude, 0.45). We believe that the apparent initial burst of activity (corresponding to the short time constant exponential) is a systematic feature of the assay and that the activity of KtrB is expressed in the slow rising phase of the data. In equivalent experiments with the KcsA potassium channel, performed by Heginbotham and colleagues (20Heginbotham L. Kolmakova-Partensky L. Miller C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), saturation is attained within ∼3 min, and uptake is fitted with single exponential with a time constant of ∼30 s. Our experiments show that KtrB can behave like a channel; by this we mean that, albeit not very efficiently (slow uptake), K+ and Rb+ flow through the protein driven solely by their electrochemical gradients. This agrees well with the report by Bakker and colleagues (11Tholema N. Vor der Bruggen M. Maser P. Nakamura T. Schroeder J.I. Kobayashi H. Uozumi N. Bakker E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41146-41154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), which showed in vivo that the KtrB protein alone (without KtrA) can transport potassium ions independently of sodium. Importantly these functional results demonstrate that detergent solubilization of KtrB preserves the protein's basic functional properties. To verify that other KtrB proteins are also organized as dimers, we repeated the cross-linking experiments with KtrB proteins from B. halodurans and S. pneumoniae. These membrane proteins were expressed in E. coli, and membrane preparations were exposed to the bifunctional amino group cross-linker DSP. After the reaction, just like with B. subtilis KtrB, a strong band consistent with a dimer appeared in Western blots (Fig. 2E), suggesting that the dimeric organization is a general feature of all KtrB proteins. Probing KtrB with Cysteine-reactive Cross-linkers—The discovery of the dimeric nature of KtrB opened up the possibility of using biochemical approaches to gain structural insights about the protein. We used cysteine-reactive bifunctional compounds and a series of single cysteine mutants to identify protein regions close to the dimer interface and to investigate the structure of KtrB. As a constraint, we have assumed that the subunits of the homo-dimeric membrane protein are related by a 2-fold axis of symmetry perpendicular to the plane of the bilayer. Introduction of a single cysteine mutation in a cysteineless KtrB will result in the dyad axis being positioned midway between this cysteine and its counterpart in the other molecule. Bifunctional MTS reagents of different lengths can be used to estimate the relative separation between the single cysteine mutations in each of the two subunits (Ref. 21Sorgen P.L. Hu Y. Guan L. Kaback H.R. Girvin M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14037-14040Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, and references within). Under oxidizing conditions the reaction between the MTS compounds and a cysteine is irreversible, and, given enough time, the macromolecule samples many conformations and cross-linking occurs even at positions that seem too far apart. Therefore, distance restraints are usually defined from the rate of formation of the cross-linked protein, or efficiency of cross-link. For practical reasons we have chosen not to measure the rates of dimer cross-linking but to expose each cysteine mutant to a long (M17M, Cα to Cα maximum span of ∼31 Å) and a short (M3M, Cα to Cα maximum span of ∼13 Å) bifunctional reagent for a fixed amount of time. Reaction with the short compound will occur only at a restricted set of mutant sites (Fig. 3A), identifying positions close to the dyad axis (interface). Conversely, the long reagent will react with most or all mutant positions. Local protein structure will also affect the reaction, so it is important to look for trends across several positions. We obtained a cysteine-less KtrB by mutating the only natural cysteine (Cys-407) to alanine; in this background we prepared 13 single cysteine mutants in the cytoplasmic and extracellular loops (Fig. 3B) guided by sequence analysis algorithms and the experimentally determined topology of the related protein HKT1 from A. thaliana (9Kato Y. Sakaguchi M. Mori Y. Saito K. Nakamura T. Bakker E.P. Sato Y. Goshima S. Uozumi N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6488-6493Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The selected positions are occupied by non-conserved amino acids with polar side chains and are therefore probably non-essential and exposed to the aqueous solution. A mutation that completely wipes out function may have only minimal structural effects and therefore still provide useful information for our purposes. For this reason, we did not test the functional impact of the mutations, but assessed only whether the mutant proteins are still dimeric. Membrane preparations of each mutant were exposed for 1 h to the reagents M3M and M17M, with a Cα to Cα span of ∼13 Å and ∼31 Å (22Guan L. Murphy F.D. Kaback H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

https://openalex.org/W2021903493,"Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) operates at a control point in mammalian gluconeogenesis, being inhibited synergistically by fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (Fru-2,6-P2) and AMP. AMP and Fru-2,6-P2 bind to allosteric and active sites, respectively, but the mechanism responsible for AMP/Fru-2,6-P2 synergy is unclear. Demonstrated here for the first time is a global conformational change in porcine FBPase induced by Fru-2,6-P2 in the absence of AMP. The Fru-2,6-P2 complex exhibits a subunit pair rotation of 13° from the R-state (compared with the 15° rotation of the T-state AMP complex) with active site loops in the disengaged conformation. A three-state thermodynamic model in which Fru-2,6-P2 drives a conformational change to a T-like intermediate state can account for AMP/Fru-2,6-P2 synergism in mammalian FBPases. AMP and Fru-2,6-P2 are not synergistic inhibitors of the Type I FBPase from Escherichia coli, and consistent with that model, the complex of E. coli FBPase with Fru-2,6-P2 remains in the R-state with dynamic loops in the engaged conformation. Evidently in porcine FBPase, the actions of AMP at the allosteric site and Fru-2,6-P2 at the active site displace engaged dynamic loops by distinct mechanisms, resulting in similar quaternary end-states. Conceivably, Type I FBPases from all eukaryotes may undergo similar global conformational changes in response to Fru-2,6-P2 ligation. Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) operates at a control point in mammalian gluconeogenesis, being inhibited synergistically by fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (Fru-2,6-P2) and AMP. AMP and Fru-2,6-P2 bind to allosteric and active sites, respectively, but the mechanism responsible for AMP/Fru-2,6-P2 synergy is unclear. Demonstrated here for the first time is a global conformational change in porcine FBPase induced by Fru-2,6-P2 in the absence of AMP. The Fru-2,6-P2 complex exhibits a subunit pair rotation of 13° from the R-state (compared with the 15° rotation of the T-state AMP complex) with active site loops in the disengaged conformation.

FBPase and fructose-6-phosphate-1-kinase (PFK) define a futile cycle that consumes ATP. In order to avoid unnecessary loss of ATP, enzymes associated with futile cycles are often subject to coordinate regulation. Mammalian FBPases have two primary physiological inhibitors, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (Fru-2,6-P2), the levels of which are under hormonal control, and AMP, which remains at a relatively constant concentration under aerobic conditions (3Taketa K.

The mammalian and bacterial Type I enzymes are reportedly homotetramers (subunits labeled C1-C4 by convention) and exist in distinct quaternary states R and T.

In the porcine liver enzyme, the AMP-induced transition to the T-state displaces a dynamic loop (residues 52-72) from the active site, disrupting at least one of three binding sites for essential metal cofactors (23Choe J.-Y.

The conformational change in the dynamic loop is consistent with competitive inhibition of catalysis by AMP with respect to Mg2+ (28Liu F. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7401-7406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Four molecules of Fru-2,6-P2 bind per tetramer (29Kitajima S. Uyeda K. J. Biol.

Fru-2,6-P2 is a linear competitive inhibitor with respect to Fru-1,6-P2, lowers the concentration of AMP necessary for 50% inhibition of mammalian FBPases (AMP/Fru-2,6-P2 synergism), and induces sigmoidicity in the binding of Fru-1,6-P2 (7Van Schaftingen E.

Chem. 1965; 240: 651-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding studies are consistent with kinetics; the presence of Fru-2,6-P2 enhances AMP binding (30McGrane M.M. El-Maghrabi M.R. Pilkis S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10445-10454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the binding of one equivalent of Fru-2,6-P2 elicits change in UV difference spectra similar to that induced by AMP (30McGrane M.M. El-Maghrabi M.R. Pilkis S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10445-10454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The conformational changes in FBPase that underlie these observations are unclear. Specifically, how FBPase responds to Fru-2,6-P2 alone is not known. The Fru-2,6-P2·AMP complex is isomorphous to the AMP complex (T-state) (26Xue Y. Huang S. Liang J.-Y. Zhang Y. Lipscomb W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12482-12486Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and FBPase crystal structures with Fru-2,6-P2, in the absence of AMP, are in the R-state. These R-state structures, however, either lack density for the 2-phosphoryl group (a likely consequence of degradation of Fru-2,6-P2 to fructose 6-phosphate (8Ke H. Thorpe C.M. Seaton B.A. Lipscomb W.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 212: 513-539Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar)) or are the result of soaking R-state crystals with the inhibitor (9Liang J.-Y. Huang S. Zhang Y. Ke H. Lipscomb W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2404-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The crystallization of FBPase with Fru-2,6-P2 from solution and clear evidence of an intact ligand would go a long way to understanding the conformational changes induced by Fru-2,6-P2. Reported here for the first time are co-crystallizations of porcine FBPase with Fru-2,6-P2. Ligation of the active site by Fru-2,6-P2 in the presence of Mg2+ or Zn2+ causes a quaternary transition to the IT-state, similar to that induced by AMP. Hence, we propose that AMP/Fru-2,6-P2 synergism arises from a distinct quaternary state of FBPase, formed in the presence of Fru-2,6-P2. FBPase from Escherichia coli provides a test of hypothesis. In the presence of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) or citrate, the E. coli enzyme is in an active R-state very similar to that of the porcine enzyme (32Hines J.H. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11696-11704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Moreover, AMP (in conjunction with Glc-6-P) causes a global conformational change to a T-like state (33Hines J.K. Kruesel C.E. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Biol.

Edelstein I. Rittenhouse J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 119: 1103-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Demonstrated here is the binding of Fru-2,6-P2 to the active site by a structure determination and by the competitive inhibition of E. coli FBPase with respect to Fru-1,6-P2. Unlike the porcine enzyme, however, Fru-2,6-P2 causes no global conformational change in E. coli FBPase, consistent with the absence of AMP/Fru-2,6-P2 synergism. Materials—Fru-1,6-P2, Fru-2,6-P2, NADP+, DEAE-Sepharose, and Cibacron Blue-Sepharose came from Sigma. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and phosphoglucose isomerase were from Roche Applied Science. All other chemicals were of reagent grade or equivalent. Preparation of Porcine and E. coli FBPases—Porcine FBPase was isolated as previously described (38Choe J.-Y. Nelson S.W. Arienti K.L. Axe F.U.

Pooled FBPase, eluted from Cibacron Blue-Sepharose chromatography, was adjusted to pH 7.5-8.3 before loading onto a DEAE-Sepharose column (equilibrated with 5 mm MgCl2 and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5). A Sephadex G-50 column (equilibrated with 20 mm KH2PO4/K2HPO4, pH 7.0) replaced the dialysis step after DEAE chromatography. Protein (10 mg/ml in 20 mm KH2PO4/K2HPO4, pH 7.0) was filtered through a 0.22-μm filter and flash frozen in 200-μl aliquots using a dry ice/ethanol bath and stored at -80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (39Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Selenomethionine-substituted E. coli FBPase was isolated as previously described (20Hines J.H. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Biol.

Crystallization of Fru-2,6-P2 Complexes—Crystals were grown from hanging drops in vapor diffusion VDX plates (Hampton Research). Sucrose and polyethylene glycol solutions were supplemented with 0.05% (w/v) NaN3 to limit microbial growth. All other solutions were sterile-filtered prior to use. Crystals of E. coli FBPase with citrate and Fru-2,6-P2 grew from droplets containing 2 μl of a protein solution (15 mg/ml enzyme, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm Fru-1,6-P2, 5 mm Fru-2,6-P2, 5 mm MgCl2) and 2 μl of a precipitant solution (50 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.3, 25% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 1500, and 20% (w/v) sucrose). Crystals of the Mg2+·Fru-2,6-P2 complex of porcine FBPase grew from droplets containing 2 μl of a protein solution (10 mg/ml enzyme, 0.2 mm EDTA, 5 mm Fru-2,6-P2, 5 mm MgCl2) and 2 μl of a precipitant solution (8.5% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350, 5% (v/v) t-butanol, 27% (v/v) glycerol, and 10 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5). Crystals of the Zn2+·Fru-2,6-P2 complex of porcine FBPase grew from droplets containing 2 μl of a protein solution (10 mg/ml enzyme, 5 mm Fru-2,6-P2, 2 mm ZnCl2) and 2 μl of a precipitant solution (10% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350, 5% (v/v) t-butanol, 27% (v/v) glycerol, and 100 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.0). In all cases, the droplets were equilibrated over 500 μl of precipitant solution. Equal dimensional crystals (0.2-0.3 mm) grew within 3 days at 22 °C. Crystals were frozen directly in a cold stream of nitrogen without additional cyroprotectants. Data Collection—Crystals were screened, and data were collected for the bacterial enzyme at Iowa State University on a Rigaku R-AXIS IV++ rotating anode/image plate system using CuKα radiation from an Osmic confocal optics system at a temperature of 110 K. Data were collected from the mammalian enzyme crystals at 100 K on Beamline 4.2.2 of the Advanced Light Source, Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. The program d*trek (40Pflugrath J.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Structure Determination and Refinement—The subunit from the canonical R-state of porcine FBPase (Protein Data Bank accession identifier 1CNQ), less ligands and water molecules, was transformed by CCP4 programs PDBSET (43Evans P.

The C1-C2 dimer of the refined Mg2+·Fru-2,6-P2 complex (less ligands and water molecules) was used in turn as the initial model for the Zn2+·Fru-2,6-P2 complex. The subunit of R-state E. coli FBPase (Protein Data Bank identifier 2OWZ), less ligands and water molecules, enabled a molecular replacement solution of the E. coli Mg2+·citrate·Fru-2,6-P2 complex. Structural models underwent energy minimization followed by individual thermal parameter refinement using CNS (46Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W.

Force constants and parameters of stereochemistry were from Engh and Huber (47Engh R.A. Huber R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 392-400Crossref Scopus (2545) Google Scholar). Restraints for thermal parameter refinement were as follows: 1.5 Å2 for bonded main-chain atoms, 2.0 Å2 for angle main-chain atoms and angle side-chain atoms, and 2.5 Å2 for angle side-chain atoms. Noncrystallographic restraints were not used in the refinement. Manual adjustments in the conformation of specific residues employed the program XTALVIEW (48McRee D.E. J. Mol. Graph. 1992; 10: 44-46Crossref Google Scholar). Ligands (Mg2+, Zn2+, Fru-2,6-P2, HPO2-4, and citrate) and water molecules were fit to omit electron density until no improvement in Rfree was observed. Water molecules with thermal parameters above 55 Å2 or more than 3.2 Å from the nearest hydrogen bonding partner were removed from the final model. Protein geometry was analyzed using the program PROCHECK (49Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Superposition of Structures—CCP4 programs PDBSET (43Evans P. PDBSET. Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, UK1992Google Scholar) and LSQKAB (44Kabsch W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect A. 1976; 32: 922-923Crossref Scopus (2358) Google Scholar) and models of dimers and tetramers of FBPase were used in pairwise superpositions. Displacements between corresponding Cα positions in superimposed structures were measured using XTALVIEW (48McRee D.E. J. Mol. Graph. 1992; 10: 44-46Crossref Google Scholar). Superpositions employed porcine FBPase structures with Protein Data Bank identifiers 1CNQ, 1EYK, 1Q9D, and 1YYZ, as canonical R-, T-, IR- and IT-states, respectively. Citrate-bound E. coli FBPase (Protein Data Bank identifier 2OWZ) represents the R-state of the E. coli enzyme. The angle of rotation between subunit pairs in various quaternary states of FBPases is sensitive to the subset of residues used in superpositions. Established residue subsets were the basis of comparison of porcine structures with each other (27Iancu C.V. Mukund S. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19737-19745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and with E. coli structures (20Hines J.H. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18386-18393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Determination of the subunit pair rotation first superimposes subunits C3-C4 of a tetramer onto the porcine R-state. The angle through which subunit pair C1-C2 must then rotate in order to be superimposed onto the subunits C1-C2 of the R-state determines the subunit pair rotation. Kinetic Experiments—Activity assays employ the coupling enzymes phosphoglucose isomerase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and monitor the formation of NADPH by either absorbance at 340 nm or fluorescence emission at 470 nm (27Iancu C.V.

Assays (total volume, 2 ml) were conducted at 22 °C in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, with 100 μm EDTA and 150 μm NADP+. 150 mm KCl was present in porcine FBPase assays only. Saturating levels of Fru-1,6-P2 (40 or 20 μm) and MgCl2 (10 or 5 mm) for E. coli and porcine enzymes, respectively, were used to measure specific activity. E. coli FBPase (but not porcine FBPase) is sensitive to the method of assay, so two assays were employed (32Hines J.H. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11696-11704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Assays were either initiated by the addition of 1.4 μg of enzyme (enzyme-initiated assays) or by incubating the enzyme in assay mixtures for 1-2 h at 22 °C without MgCl2 and then initiating the reaction by the addition of metal (metal-initiated assays). Porcine FBPase assays were initiated by the addition of metal. Enzyme Purity—Preparations of native and selenomethionine-substituted E. coli FBPase, used for kinetic and structural investigations, respectively, have specific activities of 35-40 units/mg and appear as single bands on SDS-PAGE. Analysis of the N-terminal residue reveals a single type (methionine or selenomethionine), indicating no N-terminal proteolysis. Purified porcine FBPase used here has a specific activity of 30 units/mg, migrates as a single band on SDS-PAGE, and has a pH 7.5/9.6 activity ratio of 3.3, characteristic of a nonproteolyzed mammalian FBPase. Kinetics of AMP and Fru-2,6-P2 Inhibition—Enzymes isolated here have kinetic properties as previously reported for porcine (50Nelson S.W. Iancu C.V. Choe J.-Y. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J.

Enzyme- or metal-initiated assays of E. coli FBPase result in different I0.5 values and Hill coefficients for AMP (32Hines J.H. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Biol.

Regardless, Fru-2,6-P2 has no effect on AMP inhibition of E. coli FBPase using either assay method (Fig. 1). Lines in A-C of Fig. 1 are from fits of the Hill equation, V=Vmax/[(I/I0.5)n+1](Eq. 1) where V and Vmax represent the observed and maximum velocities, I is the concentration of AMP, I0.5 is the concentration of AMP that gives 50% inhibition, and n is the Hill coefficient. Values of n are 1.0 ± 0.2 and 1.7 ± 0.2 for data of A and B, respectively, as is consistent for enzyme- and metal-initiated assays (32Hines J.H. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11696-11704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In Fig. 1C, the Hill coefficient for AMP inhibition of porcine FBPase declines from 1.9 ± 0.2 to 1.3 ± 0.1 as the concentration of Fru-2,6-P2 increases. Moreover, Fru-2,6-P2 clearly enhances the inhibition of porcine FBPase by AMP. I0.5 values decline as a function of increasing concentration of Fru-2,6-P2 (Fig. 1D). The decrease in I0.5 of AMP follows Equation 2, which is of the same form as the Hill equation with n set to unity. I0.5=I0.5min+(I0.5max−I0.5min)/([Fru−2,6−P2]/α0.5+1)(Eq. 2) In the above, I0.5 is the concentration of AMP causing 50% inhibition, I0.5 min is the limiting I0.5 value for AMP inhibition in the presence of an infinite concentration of Fru-2,6-P2, I0.5max is the observed value for 50% inhibition by AMP in the absence of Fru-2,6-P2, and α0.5 is the concentration of Fru-2,6-P2 that produces 50% of the synergistic effect. The parameter α0.5 represents an apparent dissociation constant for Fru-2,6-P2. Its value from the data of D is 0.36 ± 0.04 μm, within range of observed dissociation constants (0.1-2 μm) reported for Fru-2,6-P2 from kinetics and binding experiments (6Pilkis S.J. El-Maghrabi R.M.

Enhancement of AMP inhibition by Fru-2,6-P2 is simply I0.5max/I0.5 min, ∼4.5-fold based on the data of Fig. 1. I0.5 for Fru-2,6-P2 inhibition also decreases as a function of AMP concentration (7Van Schaftingen E. Hers H.-G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Fru-2,6-P2-bound Structures of Porcine FBPase (Protein Data Bank Codes 2QVU and 2QVV)—Crystals of porcine FBPase belong to the space group P21212 with a = 59.2, b = 165.6, c = 79.6 Å (Fru-2,6-P2·Mg2+ complex) and a = 59.0, b = 165.7, c = 79.2 Å (Fru-2,6-P2·Zn2+ complex) (Table 1). The two mammalian structures are isomorphous and contain a C1-C2 subunit pair in the asymmetric unit. A second subunit pair (C3-C4, related by crystallographic symmetry) completes the biological tetramer. Models of porcine FBPase, as usual lacking electron density for residues at the N terminus, begin with Asn9 and go to the C-terminal residue at position 337. Only residues 63-70 are not in strong electron density.

We suggested that Ca2+ regulation by caldesmon and Ca2+-calmodulin is achieved by controlling the state of thin filament through a cooperative-allosteric mechanism homologous to troponin-tropomyosin in striated muscles. In the present work, we have tested this hypothesis. We monitored directly the thin filament transition between the ON and OFF state using the excimer fluorescence of pyrene iodoacetamide (PIA)-labeled smooth muscle αα-tropomyosin homodimers. In steady state fluorescence measurements, myosin subfragment 1 (S1) cooperatively switches the thin filaments to the ON state, and this is exhibited as an increase in the excimer fluorescence. In contrast, caldesmon decreases the excimer fluorescence, indicating a switch of the thin filament to the OFF state. Addition of Ca2+-calmodulin increases the excimer fluorescence, indicating a switch of the thin filament to the ON state. The excimer fluorescence was also used to monitor the kinetics of the ON-OFF transition in a stopped-flow apparatus. When ATP induces S1 dissociation from actin-PIA-tropomyosin, the transition to the OFF state is delayed until all S1 molecules are dissociated actin. In contrast, caldesmon switches the thin filament to the OFF state in a cooperative way, and no lag is displayed in the time course of the caldesmon-induced fluorescence decrease. We have also studied caldesmon and Ca2+-calmodulin-caldesmon binding to actin-tropomyosin in the ON and OFF states.

The contractile system of smooth muscles is based on actomyosin interaction like all muscles; however, it is adapted for the maintenance of sustained isometric force and slow contraction. Vertebrate smooth muscle is a dual regulated muscle: activation of myosin by phosphorylation of light chains by myosin light chain kinase and its dephosphorylation by a phosphatase is the prime regulator of smooth muscle contractility. However it is well established that the activity of the thin filaments toward myosin is independently regulated by Ca2+ because native thin filaments isolated from smooth muscles confer a Ca2+-dependent regulation on unregulated myosin from skeletal or smooth muscle (1Marston S.B.

Caldesmon inhibition is cooperative with up to 14 actin monomers being inhibited by the binding of one caldesmon molecule to actin-tropomyosin; moreover, Ca2+ and CaBP (or calmodulin) interacting with caldesmon activate thin filaments to up to 150% of the activity of actin-tropomyosin rather than simply neutralizing the inhibitory effect of caldesmon (5Smith C.W.

We have consistently argued that the only model of regulation that can account for all the regulatory characteristics is a cooperative allosteric mechanism analogous to troponin-tropomyosin in striated muscle thin filaments (10Notarianni G.

Alternative models have been proposed that include a role for mutually exclusive competitive binding of caldesmon or myosin heads to actin-tropomyosin in determining thin filament interaction with myosin. The original model of Sobue et al. (16Sobue K. Morimoto K. Inui M. Kanda K. Kakiuchi S. Biomed. Res. 1982; 3: 188-196Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar) proposed a purely competitive “flip-flop” mechanism, which was ruled out by measurements showing that caldesmon and S1·ADP·Pi could bind simultaneously to actin-tropomyosin (12Marston S.B. Redwood C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16796-16800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, several studies appeared to show a relationship between caldesmon inhibition and S1·ADP·Pi displacement (17Hemric M.E. Chalovich J.M. J. Biol.

Displacement models cannot account for the activating property of Ca2+-CaBP and Ca2+-calmodulin and are ruled out by the consistent observation that both caldesmon and calmodulin or CaBP remain bound to actin-tropomyosin under activating conditions (9Pritchard K. Marston S.B. Biochem. J. 1989; 257: 839-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 10Notarianni G. Gusev N.B. Lafitte D. Hill T.J. Cooper H.S. Derrick P.J. Marston S.B. J. Musc. Res.

Nevertheless, it remains possible that smooth muscle thin filament regulation involves mixed cooperative and competitive regulation or even an entirely novel process (24Chen Y. Chalovich J.M. Biophys. J. 1992; 63: 1063-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The critical test for any regulatory scheme is that it produces experimentally testable predictions that can rule out other models. The concerted allosteric-cooperative transition model proposes two states of actin-tropomyosin termed ON and OFF. Myosin weak binding complex (M·ADP·Pi) affinity is the same for both states but strong binding complexes can only be formed with thin filaments in the ON state. Crossbridge cycling and force production is thus only possible when filaments are in the ON state, therefore the activity of the thin filament depends on the proportion of actin-tropomyosin in the ON state. Caldesmon is proposed to act as an allosteric inhibitor by binding preferentially to the OFF state while Ca2+-CaBP-caldesmon activates thin filaments by binding preferentially to the ON state. This mechanism is fundamentally the same as the mechanism for troponin regulation of actin-tropomyosin filaments in striated muscles (25Hill T.L. Eisenberg E. Greene L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3186-3190Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 26McKillop D.F.A. Geeves M.A. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 711-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 27Geeves M.A. Halsall D.J. Biophys. J. 1987; 52: 215-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated caldesmon inhibition with no change in the binding of myosin subfragment 1 (S1) weak binding complexes (S1·ADP·Pi) and the cooperative binding of strong-binding complexes (S1·ADP and S1·AMP·PNP) to caldesmon-inhibited actin-tropomyosin (12Marston S.B. Redwood C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16796-16800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Marston S.B. Fraser I.D.C. Huber P.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32104-32109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These findings are compatible with the proposed mechanism. More recently we have investigated thoroughly the effect of caldesmon on the elementary steps of the actomyosin ATPase (28Alahyan M. Webb M.R. Marston S.B. El-Mezgueldi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19433-19448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We found that caldesmon had very little effect on the rate of S1 binding to actin-tropomyosin, acto-S1 dissociation by ATP and the rate of ADP release. The rate of phosphate release was drastically reduced. We suggested that caldesmon inhibition of phosphate release is caused by the thin filament being switched to an inactive (OFF) state. In this report we have tested the hypothesis that smooth muscle thin filaments change state in both inhibitory and activating conditions. To do this we have used the excimer fluorescence of pyrene iodoacetamide-labeled smooth muscle tropomyosin as a probe of the thin filament ON-OFF transition and studied caldesmon and Ca2+-calmodulin-caldesmon binding to actin-tropomyosin and have related this to the control of thin filament activity as measured by actin activation of myosin S1 Mg2+-ATPase. The results support our hypothesis both for caldesmon inhibition of actin-tropomyosin and for Ca2+-calmodulin-caldesmon activation of actin-tropomyosin and also permit us to determine values of the size of the cooperative unit and the rates of transition and equilibrium constants between the ON and OFF states.

S1 was treated with N-ethyl maleimide as described by Swartz and Moss (33Swartz D.R. Moss R.L. J. Biol.

Because of the inability of native smooth muscle αβ-tropomyosin heterodimers to display excimer fluorescence, smooth muscle αα-tropomyosin homodimers were purified using chromatofocusing on a mono-P 5/20 column in an FPLC chromatography system as described (34Horiuchi K.Y.

Skeletal muscle αβ-tropomyosin heterodimers and smooth muscle αα-tropomyosin homodimers were labeled at cysteine with N-(1-pyrenyl)iodoacetamide (Molecular Probes) (referred to in the text as PIA) as described by Lehrer et al. (36Ischii Y. Lehrer S.S. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4922-4925Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The purified proteins were dialyzed against 5 mm PIPES, 120 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm NaN3, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.1 (ATPase buffer) and stored at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by the Lowry method. Pyrene iodoacetamide concentration was measured by absorbance at 344 nm (ϵ344 = 45.5 μm PIA/1 OD). Labeling ratio PIA/tropomyosin was 1.7–2.1 for smooth muscle tropomyosin homodimers (corresponding to 95% labeling of the 2 cysteines present in each homodimer) and 2.4–2.8 for skeletal muscle tropomyosin (86% labeling of the 3 cysteines present in each skeletal muscle heterodimer).

Steady State Fluorescence Titrations—Steady state fluorescence measurements were obtained with a Fluoromax-2 photon counting fluorimeter in the ratio mode. Titrations were carried out with excitation at 343 nm and emission at 350 nm to monitor light scattering and 485 nm to monitor the excimer fluorescence of PIA-tropomyosin (37Mirza M. Robinson P.

Before titrations, all proteins were clarified by centrifugation in a refrigerated bench top centrifuge for 10 min at 25,000 × g. All buffers used were filtered before use. The temperature was maintained at 25 °C by a circulating water bath. Stopped-flow Experiments—All transient kinetic measurements were performed on a Hi-Tech Scientific SF-61 double mixing stopped-flow system using a 100 watt Xe/Hg lamp and a monochromator for excitation wavelength selection as previously described (28Alahyan M. Webb M.R. Marston S.B. El-Mezgueldi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19433-19448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Pyrene iodoacetamide fluorescence was excited at 364 nm and emission of excimer fluorescence was monitored through a 455 nm cut-off filter. Light scattering was observed at 90o to the incident beam using a UG-5 filter (light over 400 nm was cut off). The measurements were carried out in ATPase buffer at 20 °C unless otherwise stated (28Alahyan M. Webb M.R. Marston S.B. El-Mezgueldi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19433-19448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The temperature of the stopped-flow machine was maintained within 0.1 °C during the course of the experiment. All buffers were filtered and all proteins were clarified by centrifugation in a refrigerated bench top centrifuge for 10 min at 25,000 × g just before use. Usually four to nine transients were collected and averaged. The data were then fitted to one or two exponentials by a non-linear least square curve fit using the software provided by Hi-Tech. The stated concentrations of reactants are those after mixing in the stopped-flow observation cell. Inhibition of Actin-Tropomyosin by Caldesmon and Activation by Caldesmon-Ca2+-Calmodulin—Fig. 1 illustrates the regulatory properties of reconstituted smooth muscle thin filaments. Addition of caldesmon to actin-smooth muscle tropomyosin resulted in inhibition to 6.6 ± 3.6% of the actin-tropomyosin-activated ATPase activity at low stoichiometry (Fig. 1A). 80% inhibition of ATPase was obtained with 0.074 ± 0.16 caldesmon added per actin (six preparations) in agreement with previous measurements (5Smith C.W. Pritchard K. Marston S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 116-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Marston S.B. Redwood C.S. J. Biol.

Chicken gizzard and sheep aorta caldesmon were indistinguishable in this assay, and the inhibition was independent of temperature (20–37 °C) and KCl concentration. In suitable conditions (120 mm KCl, 37 °C), 10–20 μm Ca2+-calmodulin (Ca2+-CaM)-activated actin-tropomyosin, which had been inhibited by caldesmon. ATPase activity with saturating quantities of Ca2+-calmodulin was activated to 115 ± 2% of the uninhibited actin-tropomyosin ATPase (six preparations) (Fig. 1B). This level of activation is similar to that previously observed for Ca2+-calmodulin (9Pritchard K. Marston S.B. Biochem. J. 1989; 257: 839-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 39Marston S. Lehman W. Moody C. Smith C. Adv. Prot. Phosphatases. 1985; 2: 171-189Google Scholar). Under comparable conditions NEM-S1, which switches thin filaments to the ON state, activated actin-tropomyosin to 200% of actin-tropomyosin ATPase at a ratio of 0.15 NEM-S1:1 actin-tropomyosin (Fig. 1C). Detection of the ON/OFF Equilibrium by PIA-Tropomyosin Excimer Fluorescence Changes—We monitored the equilibrium between the ON and OFF states of actin-tropomyosin by the excimer fluorescence technique of Ischii and Lehrer (36Ischii Y. Lehrer S.S. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4922-4925Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Smooth muscle αα-tropomyosin dimers were covalently labeled with pyrene iodoacetamide at 1.9 ± 0.08 mol/mol (number of experiments = 10). Fig. 2A shows fluorescence emission spectra of reconstituted actin-tropomyosin. Monomer fluorescence peaks are at 385 and 410 nm and excimer fluorescence is at 480 nm. When S1 is added to actin to turn the filaments ON, the excimer fluorescence is increased, and when S1 is displaced from actin by adding Mg2+-ATP, the excimer fluorescence returns to the original level. The average increase in excimer fluorescence induced by S1 using smooth muscle PIA-αα-tropomyosin was 55.6 ± 1.5% (number of experiments = 10). Titration of actin-tropomyosin with increasing concentrations of S1 shows that the switch between states is cooperative: pyrene excimer fluorescence increased to a plateau at much lower S1 concentrations than S1 binding monitored by light scatter (Fig. 2B). The fraction of the thin filaments in the ON state, fon determined from the excimer fluorescence, was plotted against Fb, the fraction of S1 bound to the thin filament calculated from the light scattering signal. Fitting the data to the equation fon = 1 – (1 – Fb)n generates the cooperative unit size, n (Fig. 2C) as described by Geeves and Lehrer (68Geeves M.A. Lehrer S.S. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 273-282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). A mean value for n of 10 ± 1 was obtained from three separate experiments. Cooperativity of the OFF/ON transition of actin-tropomyosin can also be determined from the transient kinetics of S1 binding to actin-tropomyosin (Fig. 3). When S1 is in excess over actin, the excimer fluorescence transient is faster than the light scattering supporting the assumption that the 2 signals monitor 2 different processes. Increasing S1 concentration lead to a hyperbolic increase of the 2 observed rate constants (kobs fluorescence and kobs light scattering) indicating that each of the 2 signals is monitoring a 2-step reaction. The first step correspond to S1 binding to the thin filaments, while the second step correspond to different processes. In the case of light scattering (monitoring S1 binding), the second step corresponds to an isomerization to a strongly bound acto-S1 complex. In the absence of any added nucleotide, this usually plateaus around 250 s–1 (28Alahyan M. Webb M.R. Marston S.B. El-Mezgueldi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19433-19448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In the case of the excimer fluorescence (monitoring the thin filament switching between the OFF and ON states), the second step correspond to the transition from the OFF to the ON state. The hyperbolic fit gave a maximum rate of 833 s–1 for the OFF to ON transition albeit, it is anticipated that this value contains a large error because the experimental data cover less than half of the entire curve. Nevertheless we can put a lower limit of 350 s–1 for the maximum rate of the OFF to ON transition (The highest experimentally determined value, Fig. 3B). The slopes in the initial part of the 2 curves depend on the rate of S1 binding. It was previously modeled that the ratio of the 2 slopes (kobs fluorescence/kobs light scattering) corresponds to the size of the cooperative unit n (68Geeves M.A. Lehrer S.S. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 273-282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Using this kinetic technique n was found to be 10, which is the same as determined from the steady state titrations. Caldesmon and Ca2+-Calmodulin Switch Actin-Tropomyosin between the OFF and ON States—We used the change in pyrene excimer fluorescence to determine whether caldesmon would switch actin-tropomyosin to the OFF state. Caldesmon reduced pyrene excimer fluorescence by 19% and the quantity needed to fully switch the thin filament OFF, corresponded to the quantity needed to inhibit actin-tropomyosin activation of Mg2+-ATPase activity (Fig. 4A). The excimer fluorescence reached 80 ± 5% of the minimum level with 1:7 caldesmon added per actin. We confirmed that caldesmon switches actin-tropomyosin completely to the OFF state by comparison with skeletal muscle troponin in the absence of Ca2+: this induced the same decrease of excimer fluorescence of smooth muscle tropomyosin and subsequent addition of caldesmon had no effect on the excimer fluorescence (data not shown). We determined the effect of Ca2+-calmodulin upon actin-PIA-tropomyosin excimer fluorescence at 10 μm caldesmon where the inhibition of ATPase and decrease of excimer fluorescence was at a maximum (Fig. 4B). Calmodulin in the presence of activating Ca2+ concentrations switched the filaments toward the ON state. The maximum fluorescence was 30% greater than that of actin-tropomyosin (KT = 0.9 compared with 0.6 for actin-tropomyosin) and the concentration of Ca2+-calmodulin needed to give maximal increase in excimer fluorescence was in the same range as reversal of inhibition (Fig. 1). Addition of S1 to saturating actin-tropomyosin-caldesmon increased the fluorescence back up to the level of the fully ON filament (Fig. 5A). The transition was cooperative with an estimated cooperative unit size in the range 3–5. The further addition of caldesmon to actin-tropomyosin-S1 gave a decrease in fluorescence, which was only partial in the concentration range studied, where caldesmon affinity for actin is less than the S1 affinity (Fig. 5B). Because we have measured the fluorescence of the fully OFF state (the fluorescence plateau in the presence of caldesmon) and the fully ON state (the fluorescence plateau in the presence of S1) we can calculate the equilibrium constant KT for actin-tropomyosin. For smooth muscle αα-tropomyosin under our conditions KT was 0.60 ± 0.05 (number of experiments = 3). KT could be increased by increasing temperature or KCl concentrations. Kinetics of the ON-OFF Transition—We induced the transition from the ON to the OFF state using either ATP to dissociate pre-mixed actin-tropomyosin-S1 complex or caldesmon added to actin-tropomyosin. Fig. 6A shows light scattering and excimer fluorescence changes following acto-S1 dissociation by 40 μm ATP. The decrease in light scattering monitoring S1 dissociation from actin-tropomyosin is fast (130 s–1) and without delay. In contrast the excimer fluorescence transient representing the ON to OFF transition showed a lag (displayed as an upward curvature) before an exponential decrease (rate 67 s–1). The transition to the OFF state is delayed until all S1 molecules are dissociated from any single cooperative unit. If caldesmon is rapidly mixed with actin-tropomyosin, the excimer fluorescence decreased exponentially (Fig. 6B). The transient was best fit by a sum of 2 exponentials. The faster component represented about 75% of the total signal. Because the fluorescence change is very rapid (>400 s–1) and because of the relatively poor signal to noise ratio, there is a large error in the fitted rate constants; however, this rate is comparable with the value of >350 s–1 calculated for the transition from the OFF to the ON state (see section above for Fig. 3B). In contrast to the ATP induced acto-S1 dissociation, no lag is displayed in the time course of the caldesmon induced fluorescence decrease (Fig. 6B). These results suggest that each caldesmon binding to one actin switches the whole cooperative unit to the OFF state. Caldesmon Binding to the ON and OFF States of Actin-Tropomyosin—If actin-tropomyosin is fixed in either the ON or OFF state then predictions follow from the cooperative allosteric model that can uniquely distinguish it from other models. If actin-tropomyosin is in the ON state then caldesmon binding should be strongly inhibited and would become cooperative, conversely fixing actin-tropomyosin in the OFF state"

Lunar laser ranging indicates that tides on Earth are currently increasing the Moon's eccentricity. However, ocean tides were likely much weaker during the first billion years, allowing lunar tides to damp any primordial lunar eccentricity very early on. During the tidally driven expansion of its orbit, the Moon must have been affected by two substantial resonances related to Jupiter and Venus, passage through which may have generated today's lunar eccentricity."

The effects DLP mutations show in the loss of heterozygosity assay and on phenotypes resulting from Dmp53 overexpression indicate a genetic interaction between DLP and Dmp53. In contrast to Dmp53 mutants, however, loss of DLP does not result in radiosensitivity indicating that it does not play an essential role in the activation of Dmp53-dependent response after ionizing radiation, and DLP is also not required for the irradiation-induced activation of reaper. In contrast, DLP is involved in the transcriptional regulation of Ark, because Ark mRNA level is decreased in DLP mutants and increased upon ectopic overexpression of DLP. Interestingly, DLP mutants have reduced longevity and reduced female fertility. Altogether, our data suggest complex functions for DLP, which include an anti-apoptotic effect exerted through repression of some Dmp53 functions, and activation of some proapoptotic genes.

Mammalian p53 is a transcription factor that plays a fundamental role in cellular response to genotoxic stress (1Coates P.J. Lorimore S.A. Wright E.G. J. Pathol. 2005; 205: 221-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Activated p53 induces cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, or apoptosis by both transcription-dependent and independent ways (2Schuler M. Green D.R. Trends Genet. 2005; 21: 182-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The observation that p53 is the most commonly mutated gene in human cancer (3Hainaut P. Hernandez T. Robinson A. Rodriguez-Tome P. Flores T. Hollstein M. Harris C.C. Montesano R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar) underlines the importance of these activities in preserving genome integrity and eliminating transformed cells that pose a risk at the organism level. Although a great body of knowledge has accumulated about p53, its regulation and activity is still not understood in full detail. Furthermore, the existence of two paralogs of p53 (p63 and p73) in mammalian cells with partly overlapping functions, makes the dissection of the cellular role of p53 difficult, and underlines the importance of simple models for studying p53 function. p53 and its only Drosophila homolog Dmp53 share limited conservation at the sequence level, yet the two proteins are surprisingly similar in domain structure and their residues critical for DNA binding are well preserved (4Ollmann M.

In response to genotoxic stimuli, activated Dmp53 induces DNA repair or programmed cell death by activating the expression of its target genes, such as the pro-apoptotic reaper (rpr), Hid and sickle, and the DNA repair genes Ku70 and Ku80 (9Brodsky M.H.

Although little is known about the regulation of Dmp53, the information accumulated so far suggests that Dmp53 is regulated in a partially conserved, ancestral way. MDM2 does not have a Drosophila homolog, and the amino acid residues critical for its binding are not preserved in Dmp53 (4Ollmann M. Young L.M. Di Como C.J. Karim F. Belvin M. Robertson S.

In contrast, similar to its human counterpart, Dmp53 is phosphorylated, and this modification is necessary for the induction of Dmp53-dependent apoptosis (9Brodsky M.H. Weinert B.T. Tsang G.

The death domain-associated factor 6, Daxx, is one of the cofactors modulating p53 functions. Daxx was initially identified as a cytoplasmic Fas receptor-binding protein that potentiates apoptosis (14Chang H.Y. Nishitoh H. Yang X. Ichijo H. Baltimore D.

More recent studies found that Daxx resides primarily in the nucleus, and participates in transcriptional regulation (16Emelyanov A.V. Kovac C.R. Sepulveda M.A. Birshtein B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11156-11164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 17Li H. Leo C. Zhu J. Wu X. O'Neil J. Park E.J. Chen J.D. Mol.

Loss of Daxx results in extensive apoptosis and early embryonic death in mice (19Michaelson J.S. Bader D. Kuo F. Kozak C. Leder P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1918-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), suggesting that it may also bear anti-apoptotic functions. This view is supported by the finding that the expression of p53, similarly to that of several other proapoptotic proteins, is down-regulated by Daxx in myelocytes (20Boehrer S. Nowak D. Schaaf S. Bergmann M. Brieger A. Hoelzer D. Mitrou P.S. Weidmann E. Chow K.U. Hematol. J. 2004; 5: 513-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Several groups demonstrated the binding of Daxx to p53 but the consequences of this interaction are not clearly elucidated. Tumorigenic mutant forms of p53 were found to bind Daxx and inhibit the activation of the Daxx-dependent ASK1/JNK pathway (21Ohiro Y. Usheva A. Kobayashi S. Duffy S.L. Nantz R. Gius D. Horikoshi N. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 322-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Other studies showed that Daxx also binds wild-type p53 and modulates its transcriptional activator function in vitro (22Gostissa M. Morelli M. Mantovani F. Guida E. Piazza S. Collavin L.

Several recent reports indicate that Daxx bears both pro- and anti-cell death activities, and its involvement in malignancies is convincingly demonstrated (18Salomoni P. Khelifi A.F. Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 97-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Here we show both the physical interaction between Dmp53 and the Drosophila homolog of Daxx, DLP, 3The abbreviations used are:DLPDaxx-like proteinANOVAanalysis of varianceGSTglutathione S-transferaseArkApaf-1-related-killerLOHloss-of-heterozygosity. and the genetic interaction of the corresponding genes. Analyzing the effect of DLP mutations we found that, although DLP is required for the transcription of some proapoptotic genes, such as Ark for example, DLP is not required for Dmp53-dependent stress response upon high dose ionizing radiation. Surprisingly, DLP mutants have reduced longevity similarly to Dmp53 mutant flies (7Lee J.H. Lee E. Park J. Kim E. Kim J. Chung J.

The amplicons were cut with EcoRI and BamHI and inserted into pBTM116. To generate pBTM116-Dmp53ΔNΔC the plasmid pBTM116-Dmp53ΔN was cut with StyI and BamHI, filled in with Klenow and ligated. Human p53 was cloned into pBTM116 using EcoRI and BamHI, then the transactivation domain was deleted by digestion with EcoRI and NcoI, fill-in and religation. The sequences of the oligonucleotide primers were as follows: Dmp53F1: GGGAATTCTTGCAGGGATTAAACTCCG, Dmp53F3: GCGAATTCAGCAAGAAGCGCAAGTCC, Dmp53F4: GAATTCGGCATGATTAAGGAGGCGGC, Dmp53R1: CGGGATCCTCATGGCAGCTCGTAGGC, Dmp53R2: GGATCCAATCATGCCCTCGATGCTCT. To generate P[UASDLP1.7 kb] plasmid 1.7-kbp fragment of DLP was PCR-amplified using the DLPF2 (ACTGAGTACGCGGCACTTCT) and DLPR (ATGATCCGAACGTATTCAGGA) primers. The fragment was cloned into pUAST vector using the EcoRI and ApaI restriction sites. Yeast Two-hybrid Experiments—The yeast two-hybrid screen was performed using MATCHMAKER lexA Two-Hybrid System (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.), following the supplier's recommendations. Positive clones were validated by β-galactosidase colony-lift filter assay (25Breeden L. Nasmyth K. Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1985; 50: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was isolated from colonies proved to be positive in both assays (i.e. complementation of auxotrophy and β-galactosidase assay), sequenced, and cDNAs identified by BLAST homology searches (26Altschul S.F.

Binding of DLP to different domains of Dmp53 was tested by co-transformation of L40 yeast cells with the plasmid DLP-pACT2, identified in the screen, and pBTM116 plasmids carrying cDNA fragments spanning different regions of the Dmp53 open reading frame. To test the potential interactions, transformants were screened for growth in medium lacking histidine and assayed for β-galactosidase activity, as described above. GST Pull-down Experiments—The C-terminal region of DLP cDNA identified in Y2H screen was inserted into pET28c and transcribed-translated in the presence of [3H]leucine using the TnT T7-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) following the manufacturer's instructions. Dmp53C was cloned into pGEX-4T-1 vector using EcoRI and SalI sites. Expressed GST-Dmp53C was bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In vitro translated DLP protein and GST-Dmp53C-bound beads were mixed in PD buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA pH8.0, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1% Nonidet P40) and kept at 4 °C for 2 h. Beads were washed four times with PD buffer containing 0.1% Nonidet P40, and once with PD buffer lacking Nonidet P40. Interactions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography (using Amplify Fluorographic Reagent from Amersham Biosciences). Quantitative RT-PCR—Developmental expression of DLP was determined by measuring DLP transcript levels in synchronized w1118 animals of different developmental stages. Dmp53-dependent transcriptional activation after DNA damage was determined by measuring rpr and Ark mRNA levels of wandering third-instar w1118, Dmp535A-1–4, DLPU26, DLPU32, and DLPU42 larvae without irradiation or 2 h after 4 krad x-ray irradiation (1 krad/min). To measure DLP and Ark transcript levels in flies overexpressing DLP P[hs-GAL4]/EP (2)2108, P[hs-GAL4]/EP (2)2193, P[hs-GAL4]/EP (2)2180, P[hs-GAL4]/P[UASDLP1.7kb], and P[hs-GAL4]/+ (control) adult females were heat-shocked for 60 min at 37 °C. 60 min after heat-shock RNA was isolated and used in Q-PCR. Total RNA was isolated with Qiagen RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. First-strand cDNA was synthesized from 2 μg of total RNA with random hexamer primers using TaqMan Reverse Transcription Reagent (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). PCR reactions were carried out in duplicates in an ABI Prism 7500 real-time PCR system. cDNAs corresponding 18S rRNA and rpr were amplified using TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix while SYBR-Green PCR Master Mix (27Price D.M. Jin Z. Rabinovitch S. Campbell S.D. Genetics. 2002; 161: 721-731PubMed Google Scholar) was used for the amplification of DLP and Ark cDNA. The sequence of primers and TaqMan probes were as follows: 18S forward: GCCAGCTAGCAATTGGGTGTA, 18S reverse: CCGGAGCCCAAAAAGCTT, 18S probe: TATGGCTCTCTCAGTCGCTTCCGGG, rpr forward: CCAGTTGTGTAATTCCGAACGA, rpr reverse: TCGCCTGATCGGGTATGTAGA, rpr probe: AAGAAAGATAAACCAATGGCAGTGGCA, Ark forward: TGTCGCCAATCAAGACTGAG, Ark reverse: CATCCAAGGCTACCCAAGTC, DLP forward: TCGCCTACGATGCCTTTAAC, DLP reverse: AGATCTTGCTCGAGGGCATA. mRNA expression levels were evaluated by comparing to appropriate control samples after normalization with 18S RNA levels. In Situ Hybridization—Whole mount in situ hybridization was performed using digoxigenin-labeled, hydrolyzed antisense RNA probes following the manufacturer's recommendations (Roche Applied Science). Probes were prepared from the full-length DLP cDNA clone SD20887 (28Stapleton M. Carlson J. Brokstein P. Yu C. Champe M. George R. Guarin H. Kronmiller B. Pacleb J. Park S. Wan K. Rubin G.M.

Hybridization and pre- and post-hybridization washes were done at 55 °C, RNA hybrids were detected with anti-digoxigenin-AP antibody followed by NBT/BCIP staining. Drosophila Stocks and Crosses—Fly stocks were maintained at 25 °C on standard cornmeal-yeast-agar Drosophila medium. The Dmp535A-1–4 line (29Rong Y.S. Titen S.W. Xie H.B. Golic M.M. Bastiani M.

The RNAi strains 29374 and 29377 were obtained from Vienna Drosophila RNAi Center. P[act-GAL4] strain (BL-3954) and other stocks were obtained from the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center. The P[ey-GAL4] strain was kindly provided by J. Mihaly (BRC, Szeged, Hungary). To generate new DLP alleles the RS elements in the viable insertion lines UM-8182-3 and CB-6241-3 were remobilized using the TM3, ryRK Sb1 Ser1 P(Δ2-3)99B transposase source. Excision lines were identified based on the loss of the miniwhite marker gene and stocks were established using the y+CyO balancer chromosome. From each homozygous line genomic DNA was prepared, and PCR reactions were performed with primer pairs amplifying sequences upstream and downstream of the insertion site. (Sequences of primers are available upon request.) Deletion lines were selected on the basis of loss of the PCR products. The sizes of deletions were determined by further PCR reactions and in some selected cases molecular break-points were determined by sequencing. In addition to the deletions, precise excision lines (PE) in which precise jumpout of the P element restored the structure of DLP, were also identified by PCR analysis. Lethal mutations were transferred over a Cy-GFP balancer chromosome, the presence of deletions inspected in GFP-negative embryos as described above and allelism tested by complementation analysis. To measure the reduction of viability after ionizing radiation wandering third-instar w1118, p535A-1–4, DLPU26, DLPU32, and DLPU42 larvae were exposed to 2 krad (1 krad/min) x-ray irradiation and transferred into fresh vials, 20 larvae/vial. The number of pupae and eclosed adults were recorded and viability expressed in the percent of the number of irradiated larvae. At least six independent experiments were performed for each genotype. For the longevity assay freshly eclosed males in groups of 20 were put into vials, and the number of survivors was counted daily. For the fertility assay five 48-h-old females with 2 males were put into a vial, and the number of eggs laid in a 24-h period was recorded for 7 days in five independent experiments of each genotype. To observe the effect of DLP mutation on the phenotype resulting from Dmp53 overexpression we performed the following crosses: DLPU26;P[UASp53]/T (2Schuler M. Green D.R.

The DLPU26/DLPU26; P[UASp53]/ P[act-GAL4], and DLPU26/PE; P[UASp53]/P[act-GAL4] animals were selected based on the Tb+ phenotype. Three independent experiments were performed and the number of animals reaching specific developmental stages was recorded. Similar experiments were carried out using the eye-specific eyeless-GAL4 driver. For this the crosses were: DLPU26; P[ey-GAL4] females × DLPU26; P[UASp53]/TSTL males and DLPU26; P[ey-GAL4] females × PE; P[UASp53]/TSTL males as a control. The DLPU26/DLPU26; P[UASp53]/P[ey-GAL4], and DLPU26/PE; P[UASp53]/P[ey-GAL4] animals were selected based on the Tb+ phenotype. The largest diameters of the eyes of adult flies (20 in each groups in three parallels) were determined after photography. In loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) assay DLPU26/DLPU26; mwh Dmp535A-1–4/++, and PE/DLPU26; mwh Dmp535A-1–4/++ (control) late-third-instar (wandering) larvae were x-ray-irradiated with 250 rad (150 kV; 0.5-mm Al filter; 1,000 rad/min). Wings were dissected after eclosion, mounted in 1:1 methyl salicylate/Canada balsam (Sigma) and the number of mwh clones determined. Both genetic combinations were tested in four independent experiments, each involving 8–20 wings. Daxx-like Protein Interacts with Dmp53—In an attempt to identify Dmp53-interacting proteins we employed the yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) method to screen Drosophila embryonic cDNA library using a lexA-Dmp53 fusion lacking the N-terminal transcriptional activation domain of Dmp53 (Dmp53ΔN) as bait. (Fig. 1A) Sequence analysis identified one of the positive clones as a partial cDNA of the Daxx-like protein gene (CG9537). The 810-bp long clone encodes the last 135 amino acids (1524–1659) of DLP indicating that the C-terminal part of the protein mediates the interaction with Dmp53. GST pull-down experiment validated the specific interaction of Dmp53 and the DLP C-terminal region encoded by the cDNA recovered in the Y2H screen (Fig. 1C). To determine which region of Dmp53 is necessary for DLP interaction, we fused various segments of Dmp53 to lexA and tested for interaction with the identified DLP clone in Y2H experiments. These experiments revealed that the DNA binding domain of Dmp53 (Dmp53ΔNΔC) did not, but the C-terminal part of Dmp53 (Dmp53C) showed strong interaction with DLP (Fig. 1, A and B). When we asked whether either of the two functionally distinguishable C-terminal regions alone are able to bind DLP we found that neither the oligomerization domain (Dmp53C1), nor the basic regulatory domain (Dmp53C2) alone showed interaction (Fig. 1, A and B). Consequently, the entire C-terminal region of Dmp53, containing both the oligomerization and the basic regulatory domain, is necessary and sufficient to mediate DLP binding. These results indicate that, similarly to the interaction of p53 and Daxx (22Gostissa M. Morelli M. Mantovani F. Guida E. Piazza S. Collavin L. Brancolini C. Schneider C. Del Sal G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48013-48023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), the C-terminal region of Dmp53 is responsible for DLP binding. The similar regions of p53 and Dmp53 involved in Daxx and DLP interaction, respectively, prompted us to test whether DLP can bind human p53. Surprisingly, in Y2H assay we detected strong interaction between the C-terminal region of DLP and human p53 (Fig. 1D). Thus, although the human and fly p53 orthologs have low sequence similarity, the protein features necessary for Daxx/DLP binding are evolutionarily conserved. Daxx-like Proteins Are Conserved in the Drosophila Genus—The DLP gene has a coding capacity for a putative protein of 1659 amino acids, which shows partial similarity to its 740-residue-long human ortholog, Daxx. Comparison of the two proteins revealed that they share 27% sequence identity and 46% similarity in the Daxx-homology region (residues 1125–1472 of DLP), a region conserved in all known Daxx homologs (Fig. 2A). The Dmp53 interacting region of DLP shows 51% similarity to the part of Daxx reported to mediate p53 binding in vitro (22Gostissa M. Morelli M. Mantovani F. Guida E. Piazza S. Collavin L. Brancolini C. Schneider C. Del Sal G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48013-48023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Beside the regions mentioned above, DLP bears N-terminal glutamine-, proline-, and alanine-rich regions, which seem to be specific for the Drosophila Daxx homolog. Identifiable DLP-like proteins in members of the Drosophila genus are highly homologous in their Daxx homology regions and share significant sequence similarities outside this domain (Fig. 2A). Generation of DLP Mutants—DLP is located on the second chromosome at the cytological position 26D8. The transposons in the P{RS3} element lines UM-8182-3 and CB-6241-3 (30Ryder E. Blows F. Ashburner M. Bautista-Llacer R. Coulson D. Drummond J. Webster J. Gubb D. Gunton N. Johnson G. O'Kane C.J. Huen D. Sharma P. Asztalos Z. Baisch H. Schulze J. Kube M. Kittlaus K. Reuter G. Maroy P.

Genetics. 2004; 167: 797-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) reside in the first intron of the gene, +568 bp and +638 bp downstream of the transcriptional start site, respectively. To investigate DLP functions in vivo, we generated mutant alleles of the gene by remobilization of the P element present in these lines. Excision lines obtained following transposon remobilization were identified by loss of the miniwhite eye color marker and characterized molecularly by PCR analysis performed on homozygous embryos. Genetic crosses and molecular analysis of jumpout mutants revealed that in all lethal alleles the deletions extended out of the DLP region into adjacent genes and carriers of either of the 14 deletions mapped by PCR analysis within the DLP were viable. Thus, we concluded that DLP mutations are most probably viable and selected three alleles for further analysis (Fig. 2B). In DLPU26 a 1.7-kbp deletion removes the downstream part of the first intron and 1296 bp of coding sequence from the second exon. DLPU32 carries a 0.3-kbp deletion that removes the first exon-intron junction and 28 nucleotides from the first exon. In DLPU42 a 0.4-kbp deletion removes the translational start site. We believe that the deletions in these DLP alleles interfere with the splicing and/or translation of the DLP message. Using primers located in the vicinity of original P element insertion site DLP specific mRNA in mutant animals cannot be detected. We believe that these represent null alleles of the gene, however, in the lack of DLP specific antibody, we cannot rule out the possibility that they are hypomorph alleles, in which a truncated form of the protein is produced. In addition to the deletions, by PCR analysis we also identified lines in which precise excision of the P element restored the structure of DLP. In further genetic experiments one of these (PE) was used as an isogenic control of DLP mutants. DLP Is Developmentally Regulated but Is Not Required for Normal Development—To determine whether loss of DLP has any effect on Drosophila development we crossed homozygous DLPU26, DLPU32, and DLPU42 females to heterozygous males and determined the ratio of homozygous and heterozygous offsprings. No significant differences were found in any allele (data not shown), proving that DLP is not essential for execution of the developmental program. Lines expressing DLP siRNA obtained from the VDRC (Vienna Drosophila RNAi Center) collection are also viable and develop normally (data not shown). Therefore, we decided to determine whether DLP is expressed during develop"

Some organophosphate (OP) compounds, such as the nerve agents sarin and soman, inhibit AChE irreversibly by rapid phosphonylation of the serine residue in the enzyme active site. The high reactivity of cholinesterases (ChEs) toward OP agents led to propose these biomolecules as exogenous scavengers for sequestration of toxic OP agents before they reach their physiological target (Refs. 1Raveh L. Grunwald J. Marcus D. Papier Y. Cohen E. Ashani Y. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 45: 37-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 2Raveh L. Grauer E. Grunwald J. Cohen E. Ashani Y. Toxicol. Appl.

Chem. Biol. Interact. 2005; 157-158: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar and references therein). Because ChEs react on a molar basis with the OP agents, the amounts of ChE required for sequestration of these compounds are high. This requirement encouraged the development of production systems for the generation of recombinant ChEs at large scale (4Kronman C. Velan B. Gozes Y. Leitner M. Flashner Y. Lazar A. Marcus D.

Previous studies allowed us to determine that by optimizing sialic acid occupancy, enzyme tetramerization, and glycan loading, bovine and human recombinant AChEs can be converted into circulatory long-lived enzyme forms exhibiting mean residence time values that are similar to those of native serum-derived cholinesterases (8Kronman C.

In addition, we identified a species-dependent amino acid-specific elimination process that operates in determining the circulatory fate of AChEs, overriding the positive contribution of post-translation-related processes (i.e. enzyme assembly and glycan loading) to circulatory retention (11Cohen O. Kronman C. Velan B. Shafferman A. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 117-128Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In parallel, we demonstrated that controlled conjugation of polyethylene glycol (PEG) to lysine residues of rHuAChE or rHuBChE can generate bioactive enzymes exhibiting improved pharmacokinetic profiles (12Cohen O. Kronman C. Chitlaru T. Ordentlich A. Velan B. Shafferman A. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 795-802Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Cohen, O., Kronman, C., Chitlaru, T., Velan, B., and Shafferman, A. (July 29, 2004) U. S. Patent 0,147,002Google Scholar). Circulatory retention rates of PEGylated AChE in mice (mean residence time = 2100 min) were found to surpass those of native serum-derived enzymes such as the fetal bovine serum AChE (12Cohen O. Kronman C. Chitlaru T. Ordentlich A. Velan B. Shafferman A. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 795-802Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the rhesus animal model, PEGylated AChE demonstrated an unprecedented circulatory retention time value (MRT =∼7 days) (11Cohen O. Kronman C. Velan B. Shafferman A. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 117-128Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that AChE PEGylation bestows the enzyme with pharmacological properties suitable for its application as a prophylactic bioagent against OP intoxication. Indeed, PEGylated recombinant AChE was shown to confer high level protection to mice exposed to various OP agents. Most importantly, unlike nonmodified recombinant AChE, the PEGylated version of recombinant AChE provided excellent protection even when administered 24 h before exposure of mice to nerve agents such as O-ethyl-S-(2-isopropylaminoethyl)methylphosphonothiolate (VX) (14Cohen O. Kronman C. Raveh L. Mazor O. Ordentlich A. Shafferman A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 70: 1121-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Although exhaustive PEGylation of all lysines of the wild type rAChE may result in the generation of uniform PEGylated enzyme, such a chemically modified enzyme product was shown to be devoid of enzymatic activity (12Cohen O. Kronman C. Chitlaru T. Ordentlich A. Velan B. Shafferman A. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 795-802Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, under a defined set of conditions, four or five PEG molecules on average may be appended to monomeric rHuAChE with minimal effect on the catalytic properties of the enzyme (12Cohen O. Kronman C. Chitlaru T. Ordentlich A. Velan B. Shafferman A. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 795-802Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Cohen O. Kronman C. Raveh L. Mazor O. Ordentlich A. Shafferman A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 70: 1121-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Such preparations comprise heterogeneous enzyme products differing in amounts of PEG-attached moieties/AChE molecule. We could further determine that circulatory retention of PEG-AChEs depends on the average number and size of the PEG subunits attached to the enzyme (12Cohen O. Kronman C. Chitlaru T. Ordentlich A. Velan B. Shafferman A. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 795-802Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, because of the heterogeneous nature of the differently PEGylated enzyme preparations, we could not determine in a precise manner the contribution of PEG loading levels and PEG locations to circulatory retention of AChE. Here we report on the generation of an array of uniformly PEGylated recombinant human AChE molecules where each of the homogenous AChE preparations differed one from another in number and location of appended PEG chains at the enzyme surface. This allowed us to reveal some important aspects of site-specific PEGylation with respect to the masking of surface-related epitopes involved in different biological interactions between AChE and host-related factors.

The various lysine-to-alanine mutations were generated using a commercial site-directed mutagenesis kit (QuikChange; Stratagene). Multiple lysine rHuAChE mutants were generated by exchanging relevant fragments between the various single-lysine mutants and verified by DNA sequencing. Visual examination of the molecular structures of rHuAChE and the various hypolysine-mutated AChEs was achieved using the molecular modeling package SYBYL 6.7 running on a SGI Octane work station.

The generation of mutant AChEs displaying highly sialylated N-glycans (∼90% sialylation) was achieved by transfecting the recombinant sialyltransferase expressor HEK-293ST-2D6 cell line (8Kronman C. Chitlaru T. Elhanay E. Velan B. Shafferman A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29488-29502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) with the vectors coding for various hypolysine AChEs, followed by G418 selection to form stable producer cells. Enzyme Preparation and Structural Analysis of Glycans—Purification of the secreted AChEs from stably transfected HEK-293 cells and HEK-293ST-2D6 was carried out as described (17Kronman C. Velan B. Marcus D. Ordentlich A. Reuveny S. Shafferman A. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 959-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Desialylation of purified AChEs was performed as described previously (18Chitlaru T. Kronman C. Zeevi M. Kam M. Harel A. Ordentlich A. Velan B. Shafferman A. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 647-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Release, recovery, purification, labeling, and analysis by MALDI-TOF of N-glycans were all described before (8Kronman C. Chitlaru T. Elhanay E. Velan B. Shafferman A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29488-29502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Enzyme Activity, Specific Activity, and Thermostability Assays—AChE activities of purified AChE preparations were measured according to Ellman et al. (19Ellman G.L. Courtney K.D. Andres V. Featherstone R.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1961; 7: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (21682) Google Scholar) as described previously (8Kronman C. Chitlaru T. Elhanay E. Velan B. Shafferman A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29488-29502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The various hypolysine AChE protein products were quantified by ELISA, and the specific activity of each mutant product was calculated by dividing the enzymatic activity to protein quantity. The various hypolysine mutants were examined for thermal stability by incubating the enzymes at 37 °C for various periods of time followed by measurement of residual enzymatic activity. The thermal decay curve of each of the mutant AChE forms was profiled, and half-life time values were determined. Conjugation of Polyethylene Glycol to AChE—Attachment of PEG chains to primary amines in the various rHuAChEs was performed using succinimidyl propionate-activated methoxy PEG (Shearwater Polymers, Inc.) at a ratio of 50:1 [PEG]0/ [AChE primary amines]0 as described previously (12Cohen O. Kronman C. Chitlaru T. Ordentlich A. Velan B. Shafferman A. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 795-802Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Clearance Experiments and Analysis of Pharmacokinetic Profiles in Mice—Male outbred ICR mice (Charles River Laboratories) were maintained at 20–22 °C and relative humidity of 50 ± 10% on a 12-h light-dark cycle, fed with commercial rodent chow (Koffolk, Inc., Tel-Aviv, Israel), and provided with tap water ad libitum. The treatment of animals was in accordance with regulations outlined in the United States Department of Agriculture Animal Welfare Act and the conditions specified in The Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institute of Health. All of the pharmacokinetic studies were approved by the local ethical committee on animal experiments. Clearance experiments (three to six mice/enzyme sample) were carried out essentially as described previously (17Kronman C. Velan B. Marcus D. Ordentlich A. Reuveny S. Shafferman A. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 959-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The mice were injected intravenously with the various rHuAChE preparations (100 units/mouse in 0.2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline). Residual AChE activity in blood samples was measured, and all of the values were corrected for background hydrolytic activity in the blood (using samples withdrawn 1 h before performing the experiment). AChE activity values in samples removed 1 min after injection were assigned a value of 100% and used for calculation of residual activity. The background cholinesterase levels in blood of preadministered mice were less than 2 units/ml. The clearance patterns of the various enzyme preparations were usually biphasic and fitted to a bi-exponential elimination pharmacokinetic model (Ct = Ae–kαt + Be–kβt) as described previously (8Kronman C. Chitlaru T. Elhanay E. Velan B. Shafferman A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29488-29502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 9Chitlaru T. Kronman C. Velan B. Shafferman A. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 613-625Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pharmacokinetic parameter MRT (which reflects the average length of time the administered molecules are retained in the organism) was independently obtained by analyzing the clearance data according to a noncompartmental pharmacokinetic model using the WinNonlin computer program (20Laub P.B. Gallo J.M. J. Pharm. Sci. 1996; 85: 393-395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Immunogenicity Tests—For immunogenicity studies, mice (10 mice/group) were administered at monthly intervals with 10 μg/mouse of either non-PEGylated or PEGylated HuAChE or hypolysine rHuAChEs. Anti-AChE antibody titers in blood samples removed at various periods of time were determined by direct ELISA (21Shafferman A. Kronman C. Flashner Y. Leitner M. Grosfeld H. Ordentlich A. Gozes Y. Cohen A. Ariel N. Barak D. Harel M. Silman I. Sussman J.L. Velan B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17640-17648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Effect of Replacements of Lysine Residues by Alanine on the Structural and Functional Integrity of Human AChE—As a first step toward the generation of human AChE with reduced PEGylation target sites, we determined which of the lysine residues may be replaced without compromising enzymatic performance or structural integrity of the AChE molecule. To this end, we replaced each of the seven lysine residues of the ΔC-rHuAChE with alanine residues and examined whether the replacements affected the catalytic performance of the mutated enzyme. All of the seven single lysine mutants of ΔC-rHuAChE displayed similar specific activities (as determined by hydrolytic activity and ELISA), differing from that of the wild type enzyme by no more than a factor of 3 (Fig. 1). This finding demonstrated that any of the individual lysine residues may be substituted without significantly altering the enzyme structure or function, and therefore each of these residues can be considered as a candidate for removal when generating multilysine-mutated AChEs. Generation of Enzymatically Active and Fully PEGylated Human AChE Derivatives Carrying Multiple Lys-Ala Replacements—In the past we demonstrated (12Cohen O. Kronman C. Chitlaru T. Ordentlich A. Velan B. Shafferman A. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 795-802Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that appendage of more than four or five PEG chains/human AChE enzyme subunit is accompanied by a reduction in enzymatic activity, and therefore, at least three of the seven AChE lysine residues should be eliminated to allow no more than four free lysine residues for PEG appendage. Accordingly we generated a series of different hypolysine-mutated AChEs containing three to seven Lys-Ala mutations, corresponding to AChEs having only zero, one, two, three, or four lysine residues (i.e. between one and five PEG target sites including the N-terminal primary amine). HEK-293 cell clones stably expressing high levels of the corresponding hypolysine AChEs were generated, and production levels of all the various AChE derivatives were found to be within the range of 5–20 units/106 cells/24 h. The various hypolysine AChEs were quantified by capture ELISA, using polyclonal anti-human AChE antibodies of mouse and rabbit source (21Shafferman A. Kronman C. Flashner Y. Leitner M. Grosfeld H. Ordentlich A. Gozes Y. Cohen A. Ariel N. Barak D. Harel M. Silman I. Sussman J.L. Velan B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17640-17648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In all cases, catalytic activity-to-protein mass ratios (specific activity) were similar, differing from that of the wild type ΔC-rHuAChE by no more than a factor of 3 (Fig. 1). These results indicate that the elimination of multiple lysine residues did not cause any gross alteration in the enzyme architecture. Thermal stability of the various multiple lysine-mutated AChEs was monitored by incubating the enzymes at 37 °C and determining residual AChE activity at different time points. In all cases, thermal stability of the mutated AChE forms was in the same range (half-life values: 110–218 h) and similar to that determined for the wild type enzyme (T½ = 230 h) (Fig. 1). All of the clones expressing the various mutated hypolysine AChE were propagated to a large scale and purified. The resulting preparations of the seven different purified hypolysine ΔC-rHuAChEs (Figs. 1 and 2) were subjected to PEGylation under conditions that favor PEG saturation, so that each of the hypolysine AChE forms will display a single uniform product following PEGylation. Indeed, the various AChE forms carrying one to five PEG chains/enzyme subunit ran on SDS gels as discrete well defined single bands with apparent molecular weights in accordance with that expected from complete PEGylation of all the available PEG-target sites (Fig. 2). Most importantly, full PEGylation of all the hypolysine AChEs did not affect their catalytic activities, which were indistinguishable from those determined prior to PEGylation (Fig. 1). As mentioned above, in the case of wild type AChE containing seven lysine residues (eight potential PEG attachment sites), a considerable loss of enzymatic activity was observed under conditions that favored full PEGylation and appendage to more than five target sites. These findings demonstrate that reduction of lysine PEG target sites can provide a solution for the difficulty in generating homogenous and uniformly PEGylated catalytically active AChE derivatives. Pharmacokinetic Profiling of Hypolysine Mutant AChEs Differing in the Number of PEG-appended Chains—To determine the effect of PEG number on the circulatory residence of AChE, the elimination profiles in mice was determined for representative hypolysine PEG-AChEs (Fig. 3A). In general, enzyme forms exhibiting an increase in appended PEG chains were retained in the circulation for longer periods of time. The appendage of a single PEG chain to the alysine AChE (where PEG can be appended to the terminal primary amine of the enzyme only) significantly increased the MRT of the molecule from 42 to 365 min (Fig. 3A, compare bars a and b). Appendage of additional PEG chains was accompanied by a gradual increase in circulatory residence, so that fully PEGylated monolysine, dilysine, and trilysine AChEs (Fig. 3A, bars c, d, and e containing two, three, and four PEGs/enzyme subunit, respectively,) displayed MRT values of 520, 770, and 1860 min, respectively. Appendage of a fifth PEG moiety to AChE (by PEGylation of the tetralysine-AChE) did not contribute significantly to the circulatory residence of the PEGylated enzyme (Fig. 3A, bar f; MRT = 1810 min). The MRT values of the enzyme forms carrying four and five PEG chains was within the range of 1800–1900 min, comparable with that of the wild type enzyme randomly PEGylated under conditions that favor the appendage of four to five PEG moieties (MRT = ∼2000 ± 200 min). The Effect of Low Number PEG-attached Moieties on the Pharmacokinetic Performance of AChE Exhibiting Various Levels of Glycan Sialylation—Extensive studies exhibited that terminal glycan sialylation of AChE plays an important role in determining the circulatory fate of the enzyme, so that suboptimally sialylated AChE is eliminated rapidly from the circulation via the hepatic asialoglycoprotein removal pathway (8Kronman C.

Nevertheless, the desialylated, the partially sialylated, and the fully sialylated PEG-AChEs, all containing an average of four to five PEG chains, exhibit similar MRT values of ∼1900 min (13Cohen, O., Kronman, C., Chitlaru, T., Velan, B., and Shafferman, A. (July 29, 2004) U. S. Patent 0,147,002Google Scholar, 22Kronman C. Cohen O. Raveh L. Mazor O. Ordentlich A. Shafferman A. Toxicol. 2007; 233: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), indicating that sufficiently high levels of PEGylation render the enzyme inaccessible to asialoglycoprotein receptors. In the present study, we demonstrate that mutant hypolysine AChEs carrying one, two, or three PEG chains are retained in circulation for lesser periods of time than enzyme forms carrying four to five PEGs/enzyme subunit (see above). Because all of these enzyme forms were produced in HEK-293 cells, which allow only partial sialylation of the enzyme product (9Chitlaru T. Kronman C. Velan B. Shafferman A. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 613-625Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Chitlaru T. Kronman C. Zeevi M. Kam M. Harel A. Ordentlich A. Velan B. Shafferman A. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 647-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), we examined whether the limited circulatory retention exhibited by the low number PEG-AChEs can be attributed to removal via the asialoglycoprotein receptor system. To this end, we examined the pharmacokinetic behavior of various PEGylated hypolysine AChEs, which differ in their sialic acid contents. The mutants tested include Lys53/Lys470/Lys496/Lys538 AChE (five available PEG sites) and Lys470 AChE (two available PEG sites). Partially sialylated forms of these two mutant AChEs were produced in nonmodified HEK-293 cells, which support limited sialylation of the enzyme product (9Chitlaru T. Kronman C. Velan B. Shafferman A. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 613-625Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Chitlaru T. Kronman C. Zeevi M. Kam M. Harel A. Ordentlich A. Velan B. Shafferman A. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 647-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A). Enzyme versions totally devoid of sialic acid were produced by subjecting these two mutant AChEs, collected from HEK-293 cells, to sialidase treatment, whereas the fully sialylated enzymes were obtained by transfecting the two selected Lys-Ala AChE-expressing vectors into the genetically modified 2D6ST cell line, which is a derivative of HEK-293 engineered to express high levels of α-2,6-sialyltransferase (9Chitlaru T.

J. 1998; 336: 647-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The extent of sialylation of each of these various AChE products was verified and quantified by MALDI-TOF analysis of their N-glycans (see “Experimental Procedures”). As expected (8Kronman C.

Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 613-625Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the levels of sialic termini were 0, 60, and over 90% in the desialylated, partially sialylated, and fully sialylated AChEs, respectively (Fig. 4A). Each of the three differently sialylated versions of the two purified hypolysine mutants were fully PEGylated and then subjected to pharmacokinetic analysis. In the case of Lys53/Lys470/Lys496/Lys538 AChE, the desialylated, the partially sialylated and the fully sialylated AChE forms exhibited MRT values of 3, 42, and 100 min, respectively (Fig. 4B, inset), in agreement with previous findings for wild type ΔC-rHuAChE. Yet following the appendage of five PEG chains, all of the differently sialylated forms were retained in the circulation in a similar manner, exhibiting essentially identical MRT values of ∼1900 min (Fig. 4B). In the case of Lys470 AChE, which contains only two PEGylation target sites, the appendage of PEG chains also resulted in extension of circulatory residence; however, in this case the MRT values of the differently sialylated Lys470 AChEs clearly depended on"

Moreover, p56Lck-deficient cells or cells expressing an inactive form of p56Lck displayed defective formation of the DISC post CD95 stimulation. In vivo reconstitution of thymocytes from p56lck-deficient mice, which are resistant to apoptosis, with p56Lck restored Fas-mediated cell death.

Activation-induced cell death plays a crucial role in regulating peripheral homeostasis and self-tolerance by eliminating auto-reactive and activated T cells. Members of the “death receptor” subgroup of the tumor necrosis receptor family, characterized by their intracellular “death domain” motifs, have been identified as important mediators of apoptosis (2Scaffidi C. Kirchhoff S. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 277-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Like all death receptors, ligation of CD95 (Fas/APO-1) by its ligand (FasL) or agonistic antibodies triggers death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) formation (3Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S. Behrmann I. Germer M. Pawlita M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5579-5588Crossref PubMed Scopus (1792) Google Scholar), which typically induces caspase activation (4Siegel R.M. Chan F.K. Chun H.J. Lenardo M.J. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 469-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). DISC formation occurs through the rapid recruitment of a set of proteins including Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD), procaspase-8, procaspase-10, and the caspase 8/10 regulator c-FLIP to the cytoplasmic domain of CD95 (5Chinnaiyan A.M.

These studies clearly suggest that Fas-induced apoptosis can be controlled at the level of the cytoplasmic membrane. Although specific interactions between Fas, FADD, and procaspase-8/10 via their death domains and death effector domains are well documented, little is known about the mechanism(s) that regulates the recruitment of these proteins to CD95 after anti-Fas treatment. Cross-linking of CD95 has been shown to trigger several signal transduction pathways that tightly regulate apoptosis (23Arch R.H. Thompson C.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 113-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).

Immunol. 1999; 163: 4737-4746PubMed Google Scholar). The role of protein-tyrosine kinases in regulating Fas-mediated apoptosis is poorly understood. Tyrosine kinase activation has been reported to provide an early and obligatory signal for Fas-mediated apoptosis, and Fas activity is abrogated by tyrosine kinase inhibitors (31Eischen C.M. Dick C.J. Leibson P.J. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 1947-1954PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the lack of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based motifs, CD95 is tyrosine-phosphorylated both in vitro and in vivo after Fas cross-linking (32Daigle I. Yousefi S. Colonna M. Green D.R. Simon H.U. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Furthermore, expression of Fas-associated protein (FAP-1), a tyrosine phosphatase directly associated to the cytoplasmic tail of Fas, was able to protect cells against Fas cross-linking (33Sato T. Irie S. Kitada S. Reed J.C. Science. 1995; 268: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Thus far, only one protein-tyrosine kinase, p59fyn, has been identified as being involved in Fas-mediated apoptosis through its direct interaction with CD95 (34Atkinson E.A. Ostergaard H. Kane K. Pinkoski M.J. Caputo A. Olszowy M.W. Bleackley R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5968-5971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms involved in p59fyn regulation of Fas-mediated apoptosis remain unknown. The non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinase, p56Lck, is essential to T cell signaling (35Straus D.B. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 70: 585-593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). The structure of p56Lck is typical of Src family kinases and is composed of a unique domain at the NH2 terminus (Src homology 4 domain) followed by an SH3, an SH2, and a tyrosine kinase or SH1 domain. Upon initial TCR cross-linking, p56Lck is recruited to the immunological synapse by CD4 (36Holdorf A.D. Lee K.H. Burack W.R. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 259-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Once recruited, p56Lck phosphorylates immunoreceptor tyrosine-based motifs within the TCR complex and activates downstream tyrosine kinases and adaptor proteins to initiate TCR signaling (35Straus D.B. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 70: 585-593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). The importance of p56Lck in TCR signaling was clearly demonstrated in p56Lck-deficient mice that exhibited severe defects in thymocyte maturation and significant depletion of peripheral T lymphocytes (37Molina T.J. Kishihara K. Siderovski D.P. van Ewijk W. Narendran A. Timms E. Wakeham A. Paige C.J. Hartmann K.U. Veillette A. Nature. 1992; 357: 161-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar, 38Penninger J. Kishihara K. Molina T. Wallace V.A. Timms E. Hedrick S.M. Mak T.W. Science. 1993; 260: 358-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The role of p56Lck activation in death receptor-induced cell death has been a matter of debate since conflicting and ambiguous results have been published that most probably can be attributed to the heterogeneity of experimental systems used (39Schlottmann K.E. Gulbins E. Lau S.M. Coggeshall K.M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 60: 546-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 40Gonzalez-Garcia A. Borlado L. Leonardo E. Merida I. Martinez A. Carrera A.C. J.

Here we provide both direct and genetic evidences that p56Lck plays a primary role in Fas-mediated apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Our data demonstrate that p56Lck activity and localization within plasma membrane are required for proper DISC formation after CD95 triggering. Plasmid—Human wild type p56Lck was cloned from freshly purified and activated T-lymphocytes by reverse transcription-PCR. Kinase-active p56Lck (Tyr-505 to Phe-505, (AKp56Lck)), acyl-negative (Cys-3 and Cys-5 to Ala-3 and Ala-5) WT p56Lck (WT acyl-negp56Lck), or acyl-negative active p56Lck (AK acyl-negp56Lck) mutants were generated by PCR mutagenesis. Kinase-defective p56Lck (Lys-273 to Ala-273, (DKp56Lck)) was generated by a two-step overlap PCR (44Dillon P.J. Rosen C.A. Biotechniques. 1990; 9: 298-300PubMed Google Scholar). The authenticity of constructs was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. cDNAs were subsequently cloned in the SRα-Neo vector (45Sharif-Askari E. Alam A. Rheaume E. Beresford P.J. Scotto C. Sharma K. Lee D. DeWolf W.E. Nuttall M.E. Lieberman J. Sekaly R.P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3101-3113Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Reagents, Cell Lines, and Apoptosis Induction—Jurkat and JCam-1.6 cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and cultured in complete medium (RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Cell lines were not used for more than 5 passages. To generate stable transfectant clones expressing different p56Lck mutants, JCam-1.6 cells were transfected by electroporation (240 V, 290 microfarads) with 10 μg of plasmid DNA, selected in 1 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen), and cloned by limiting dilution. Cell death was induced with monoclonal anti-human Fas (CH-11, Immunotech, 200 ng/ml), recombinant human Fas ligand (Oncogene, 10 ng/ml), monoclonal anti-mouse Fas (Jo2, BD Pharmingen, 20 μg/ml), or recombinant human tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL; R&D Systems, 2.5 ng/ml) for 6 h. Etoposide (50 mm/ml) was used for 12 h, and cisplatin (5 mg/ml) and doxorubicin (0.6 mg/ml) were used for 24 h. Cell death and loss of mitochondrial membrane potentials were assessed using annexin V (Bio Source)/propidium iodide (PI, Sigma) and JC-1 (Sigma), respectively. Cell surface CD95 expression on human cell lines and murine thymocytes were analyzed on a BD Bioscience LSR II flow cytometry (10,000 events/sample) using fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-human (R&D Systems) or anti-murine Fas (BD Pharmingen) antibodies. Mouse thymocytes subpopulations were identified using phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)-Cy5-conjugated anti-CD4 and PE-conjugated anti-CD8a antibodies (BD Pharmingen). Subcellular Fractionation—To determine the release of mitochondrial proteins, a digitonin-based subcellular fractionation technique was used as previously described (46Adrain C. Creagh E.M. Martin S.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6627-6636Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Mice—Six- to eight-week-old C57BL/6- and p56Lck-deficient mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Male and female mice were maintained in our animal facility, and all experiments were performed in compliance with the University of Montreal guidelines. p56Lck-/- and C57BL/6 were crossed to obtain first generation p56Lck-/+ mice. All mice were used between the ages of 6 and weeks. Thymocytes from each type of mice were isolated and homogenized in complete medium, and red blood cells were removed using Ack lysis buffer (0.15 m NH4Cl, 10 mm KHCO3, 0.1 mm Na2EDTA). Dead cells and debris were eliminated using a dead cell removal kit (Miltenyi Biotec). Thymocytes were incubated at 1 × 106 cells/ml in 24-well plates precoated with murine anti-Fas (20 μg/ml) for the indicated time points. Cell death was assessed as described above. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Whole cell lysates (10 μg total protein) were resolved on 10-14% SDS-PAGE after each set of treatment, and immunoblotting was performed as previously described (45Sharif-Askari E. Alam A. Rheaume E. Beresford P.J. Scotto C. Sharma K. Lee D. DeWolf W.E. Nuttall M.E. Lieberman J. Sekaly R.P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3101-3113Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Antibodies against DNA fragmentation factor-45 (DFF45), p56Lck, Smac/DIABLO, c-FLIP, and caspase-3 were generated in our laboratory as previously described (45Sharif-Askari E. Alam A. Rheaume E. Beresford P.J. Scotto C. Sharma K. Lee D. DeWolf W.E. Nuttall M.E. Lieberman J. Sekaly R.P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3101-3113Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The antibodies against caspase-8, FADD, and cytochrome c were purchased from BD Biosciences. Antibodies against Fas (B-10; Santa Cruz), β-actin (Biomol), and Bid (New England Biolabs) were used as recommended by the manufacturer. The immunoprecipitation of surface CD95 was performed on 2.0 × 107 cells after incubation with anti-Fas (1 μg/ml) at 37 °C. Cells were then lysed in 600 μl of immunoprecipitation lysis buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, supplemented with Complete® protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) in phosphate-buffered saline) for 30 min on ice. Anti-Fas was added to untreated samples after lysis to normalize for total protein. CD95 was immunoprecipitated from the post-nuclear supernatant overnight with 40 μl of protein A-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) coupled to rabbit anti-mouse IgM (Jackson ImmunoResearch) at 4 °C on a rotator. The samples were washed 5 times and resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-caspase-8 (Oncogene), anti-c-FLIP (Alexis), and anti-FADD (BD Pharmingen). P56Lck-/- Cells Are Impaired in Fas-mediated Apoptosis—Tyrosine kinases have been implicated in the early events of the apoptosis cascade (31Eischen C.M. Dick C.J. Leibson P.J. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 1947-1954PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the role of p56Lck in Fas-mediated cell death, we measured cell death after agonistic anti-Fas antibody treatment in the Jurkat cell line or in a Jurkat subclone, JCam-1.6, that lacks p56Lck (Fig. 1A). Despite a similar level of Fas receptor expression on both cell lines (data not shown), JCam-1.6 cells were significantly resistant (>70%) to cell death upon Fas receptor triggering when compared with Jurkat cells as determined by annexin V/PI staining (Fig. 1A, n > 5). A 10-fold increase in anti-Fas antibody concentration was not even sufficient to restore sensitivity to Fas-mediated apoptosis in JCam-1.6 cells (Fig. 1A). Although JCam-1.6 cells were resistant to Fas-mediated apoptosis, death still occurred in these cells at levels that did not exceed 25-30% that of those observed with Jurkat cells under similar conditions (Fig. 1A). We next performed experiments aimed at defining if p56Lck is also involved in other apoptosis-inducing stimuli. For this propose, sensitivity to natural Fas ligand, TRAIL, etoposide, doxorubicin, and cisplatin at the indicated concentrations was assessed (n = 2). Results illustrated in Fig. 1B reveal a significant decrease in the relative number of annexin V+ cells in JCam-1.6 cells treated either with Fas ligand or TRAIL. However, at the concentration used other death-inducing stimuli were not affected in their capacity to induce apoptosis despite the absence of p56Lck (Fig. 1C), suggesting the unique requirement of p56Lck in Fas and TRAIL-mediated apoptotic pathways. P56Lck Activity Is Required in Fas-mediated Apoptosis—To demonstrate that the decreased apoptotic responses of JCam1.6 cells were caused by the specific defect in p56Lck expression, we performed “add back” experiments obtaining stable transfectants. To this end the role of p56Lck and its activity in the apoptotic pathway was investigated by reconstituting p56Lck-deficient JCam-1.6 cells with wild type (WTp56Lck), dead kinase (lysine 273 to alanine 273 (DKp56Lck)), or constitutively active kinase (tyrosine 505 to phenylalanine 505 (AKp56Lck)) p56Lck molecules (Fig. 2A). Transfected JCam-1.6 cells expressing each mutant had similar levels of CD95 on their surface (data not shown). The expected function of these exogenous p56Lck molecules were confirmed by changes in total tyrosine kinase activity in each of transfectant after CD3 cross-linking (data not shown). Jurkat, JCam-1.6, JCam-1.6/WTp56Lck, JCam-1.6/DKp56Lck, and JCam-1.6/AKp56Lck cells were treated with agonistic anti-CD95 antibody (CH-11, 200 ng/ml) for different time points (Fig. 2A). Results revealed that reconstitution of JCam-1.6 cells with WTp56Lck or AKp56Lck was sufficient to restore sensitivity to CD95-induced apoptosis to levels similar to or higher to those observed with parental Jurkat cells, respectively (Fig. 2A). In contrast, reconstitution with DKp56Lck protein did not alter the resistance of JCam-1.6 cells to CD95 cross-linking. Similar results were gathered from five different clones of each mutant (data not shown). Consistent with the levels of cell death measured by annexin V, faster and more efficient processing of the DFF45 was observed in JCam-1.6/AKp56Lck as compared with cells lacking p56Lck or expressing its DK-p56Lck variant (Fig. 2B), suggesting that the effect of p56Lck is not only on phosphatidylserine externalization but on the whole pathway of Fas-mediated cell death. Absence of p56Lck Leads to Substantial Defect in Mitochondrial Pathway—We next performed experiments aimed at defining the apoptotic pathways associated with p56Lck-dependent Fas signaling. For this purpose, caspase-8 and caspase-3 activation were monitored in Jurkat and JCam-1.6 cells. Results showed that, whereas Jurkat cells exhibited significant activation of both caspase-8 and -3, resulting in the cleavage of DFF45 (Fig. 3A, right panel), there was a substantial reduction in caspase activation and DFF45 processing in JCam-1.6 cells (Fig. 3A, left panel). The lack of caspase activation and subsequent substrate processing in the absence of p56Lck hinted at a defect in the mitochondrial amplification loop (type II) (47Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (2633) Google Scholar). In agreement with this hypothesis, treatment of Jurkat cells with anti-Fas resulted in a major loss in ΔΨm, whereas in treated JCam-1.6 cells, the ΔΨm loss was significantly decreased (4-fold) (Fig. 3B). Bid, a mediator of mitochondrial damage induced by caspase-8, relays on an apoptotic signal from the cell surface to mitochondria in Fas-mediated apoptosis. Hence, the lack of processing of this proapoptotic molecule in the absence of p56Lck (Fig. 3C) strongly indicated that the inability of Fas to induce cleavage and activation of apoptotic effector molecules in p56Lck-deficient cells stems from abnormal proximal events upstream of the mitochondrial stage. Consequently, a major disruption in the translocation of the cytochrome c from the mitochondria to the cytosol (48Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3798) Google Scholar, 49Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3085) Google Scholar), occurred in p56Lck-deficient but not in Jurkat cells (Fig. 3D). Removal of p56Lck from the Plasma Membrane Abrogates Fas-mediated Apoptosis—The role of p56Lck localization within plasma membrane on Fas-induced cell death was investigated using different approaches. A point mutation in the SH2 domain has been shown previously to preferentially localize outside lipid raft compartment fractionated over sucrose gradient (50Hawash I.Y. Kesavan K.P. Magee A.I. Geahlen R.L. Harrison M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5683-5691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Taking advantage of this information, we first used the SH2 domain-deleted and inactive form of p56Lck (51Veillette A. Caron L. Fournel M. Pawson T. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 971-980PubMed Google Scholar) to study the effect of p56Lck localization on CD95-induced apoptosis. To this end, JCam-1.6 cells were transfected with a plasmid construct expressing AKp56Lck kinase deficient in the SH2 domain (JCam-1.6/AKp56Lck ΔSH2, Fig. 4A), and single clones (n = 3) were treated with anti-Fas antibody. As shown in Fig. 4A, expression of AKp56Lck ΔSH2 in JCam-1.6 cells did not restore Fas-mediated apoptosis in these cells, suggesting the importance of p56Lck localization within plasma membrane and its activity in this process. The specific involvement of p56Lck within plasma membrane was further examined by utilizing acylation-deficient mutant tyrosine kinase unable to translocate from the cytosol to plasma membrane (52Kabouridis P.S. Magee A.I. Ley S.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4983-4998Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Three clones of JCam-1.6 cells transfected with acyl-negative (acyl-neg), wild type p56Lck (JCam-1.6/WT acyl-negp56Lck)m or acyl-negative constitutively active p56Lck (JCam-1.6/AK acyl-negp56Lck) mutants were selected (data not shown). The disruption of p56Lck localization had no effect on the cell surface expression of CD95 (Fig. 4B). Results revealed that treatment of three different clones of JCam-1.6/WT acyl-negp56Lck or JCam-1.6/AK acyl-negp56Lck with anti-Fas antibody for 6 h showed substantial resistance to Fas-mediated apoptosis to a level similar to that observed in JCam-1.6 cells (Fig. 4B, n = 3). Together these results provide strong evidence for the mandatory compartmentalization of p56Lck to plasma membrane to initiate Fas-mediated apoptosis. Impaired DISC Assembly in the Absence of Active p56Lck—CD95 cross-linking with anti-Fas antibody rapidly leads to formation of the DISC. We next examined the assembly of DISC post CD95 triggering aiming to differentiate the stoichiometric difference in the level of DISC components in the presence or absence of p56Lck activity. To address this issue, we treated JCam-1.6, JCam-1.6/AKp56Lck, JCam-1.6/AK acyl-negp56Lck, and JCam-1.6/AK ΔSH2p56Lck cells with anti-Fas antibody followed by immunoprecipitation of surface CD95 receptor. Concurring with our previous experiments, expression of constitutively active p56Lck in JCam-1.6/AKp56Lck cells led to substantial levels of cell death, whereas apoptosis was strongly reduced in JCam-1.6, JCam-1.6/AK acyl-negp56Lck, and JCam-1.6/AK ΔSH2p56Lck cell lines (Fig. 5A). Results obtained from CD95 immunoprecipitations (Fig. 5B) indicated that p56Lck activity within plasma membrane affects the stoichiometry of recruitment of DISC components associated with CD95; expression of active p56Lck induced a rapid and substantial DISC assembly, whereas the absence of proper raft localization and activity of the p56Lck in JCam-1.6/AK acyl-negp56Lck or in the JCam-1.6/AK ΔSH2p56Lck cells resulted in a significant decrease in the recruitment of caspase-8, FADD, and FLIP-L as compared with JCam-1.6 cells. Altogether, these data confirmed that DISC assembly during Fas-mediated apoptosis is strongly dependent on the presence of p56Lck, its activity, and on its capacity to translocate to plasma membrane. P56Lck Restores Sensitivity to Fas-mediated Apoptosis in Thymocytes from p56Lck-deficient Mice—Our next objective was to demonstrate the requirement of p56Lck in the induction of Fas-mediated apoptosis in primary T cells. We examined the sensitivity to Fas-mediated cell death in thymocytes isolated from p56Lck-deficient (p56Lck-/-) mice (37Molina T.J. Kishihara K. Siderovski D.P. van Ewijk W. Narendran A. Timms E. Wakeham A. Paige C.J. Hartmann K.U. Veillette A.
