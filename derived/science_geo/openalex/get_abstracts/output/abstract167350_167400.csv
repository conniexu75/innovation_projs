It corresponds to the orphan receptor called GPR86. GPR86 proved to be a G(i)-coupled receptor displaying a high affinity for ADP, similar to the P2Y(12) receptor and can therefore be tentatively called P2Y(13). In 1321N1 cells, the P2Y(13) receptor coupled to the phosphoinositide pathway only when coexpressed with Galpha(16). Inositol trisphosphate formation was stimulated equipotently by nanomolar concentrations of ADP and 2MeSADP, whereas 2MeSATP and ATP were inactive. In CHO-K1 cells expressing the P2Y(13) receptor, ADP and 2MeSADP had a biphasic effect on the forskolin-stimulated accumulation of cAMP: inhibition at nanomolar concentrations and potentiation at micromolar levels. In the same cells, ADP and 2MeSADP also stimulated the phosphorylation of Erk1 and Erk2, in a pertussis toxin-sensitive way. The tissue distribution of P2Y(13) was investigated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, and the predominant signals were obtained in spleen and brain. Although these can be discriminated by tissue distribution and some pharmacological features, the P2Y(12) and P2Y(13) receptors form a subgroup of related P2Y subtypes that is structurally different from the other P2Y subtypes but share coupling to G(i) and a high affinity for ADP."

To study replication of dengue virus (DEN), a flavivirus family member, an in vitro RdRP assay was established using cytoplasmic extracts of DEN-infected mosquito cells and viral subgenomic RNA templates containing 5′- and 3′-terminal regions (TRs). Evidence supported that an interaction between the TRs containing conserved stem-loop, cyclization motifs, and pseudoknot structural elements is required for RNA synthesis. Two RNA products, a template size and a hairpin, twice that of the template, were formed. To isolate the function of the viral RdRP (NS5) from that of other host or viral factors present in the cytoplasmic extracts, the NS5 protein was expressed and purified from Escherichia coli. In this study, we show that the purified NS5 alone is sufficient for the synthesis of the two products and that the template-length RNA is the product of de novo initiation. Furthermore, the incubation temperature during initiation, but not elongation phase of RNA synthesis modulates the relative amounts of the hairpin and de novo RNA products. A model is proposed that a specific conformation of the viral polymerase and/or structure at the 3′ end of the template RNA is required for de novoinitiation.

The virus is spread by the mosquito, Aedes agypti, which puts ∼40% of the world at risk for dengue infection (1Gubler D.J. Clark G.G. Emerg. Infect.

Clark G.G. Emerg. Infect. Dis. 1995; 1: 55-57Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The dengue virus type 2 (DEN2)1 is the most prevalent of the four dengue serotypes. The virus contains a positive strand, 5′-capped RNA, 10,723 nucleotides in length (for New Guinea-C strain; Ref. 4Irie K. Mohan P.M. Sasaguri Y. Putnak R. Padmanabhan R.

Hahn C.S. Galler R. Rice C.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1990; 44: 649-688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This precursor is processed in the endoplasmic reticulum by a combination of the signal peptidase and the viral serine protease to generate three structural proteins of the virion, C, prM, and E (6Markoff L.

NS3, the second largest protein encoded by the virus, contains a serine catalytic triad within the N-terminal 180 amino acids, and it requires NS2B for protease activity (9Bazan J.F. Fletterick R.J.

The crystal structures of the protease domain alone and in complex with an inhibitor have been reported (19Murthy H.M. Clum S. Padmanabhan R. J. Biol.

Biol. 2000; 301: 759-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). However, the function of other nonstructural proteins in viral replication is poorly understood. NS3 also contains conserved motifs found in several NTPase/RNA helicases (21Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Donchenko A.P. Blinov V.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4713-4730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Koonin E.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 495-497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Kadare G. Haenni A.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2583-2590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). According to the current model, replication is initiated by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) by synthesis of minus (−) strand to form a double-stranded RNA intermediate, which then serves as a template for genomic positive strand (24Chu P.W. Westaway E.G. Virology. 1985; 140: 68-79Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Chu P.W. Westaway E.G. Virology. 1987; 157: 330-337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Grun J.B. Brinton M.A. J.

The viral NTPase and RNA helicase activities were reported for a recombinant NS3 lacking the protease domain, expressed and purified from Escherichia coli (28Li H. Clum S. You S. Ebner K.E. Padmanabhan R. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3108-3116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These activities may be important for replication of positive (+) strand from the double-stranded intermediate by an energy-dependent unwinding step. In addition to protease and RNA helicase activities, flavivirus NS3 protein possesses an RNA 5′-triphosphatase activity that can hydrolyze the γ-phosphate of RNA (29Wengler G. Wengler G. Virology. 1993; 197: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). 2G. Bartelma, B. Winter, and R. Padmanabhan, unpublished results. This activity is the first of the three enzymatic activities required for 5′-capping, the other two being guanylyltransferase and 5′-RNA methyltransferase (30Bisaillon M. Lemay G. Virology. 1997; 236: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar,31Wang S.P. Deng L. Ho C.K. Shuman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9573-9578Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). NS5, the largest of the DEN2 viral proteins, contains the conserved motifs found in several RNA-dependent RNA polymerases encoded by positive strand RNA viruses (32Poch O. Sauvaget I. Delarue M. Tordo N. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3867-3874Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33O'Reilly E.K. Kao C.C. Virology. 1998; 252: 287-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Additionally, NS5 contains conserved motifs found in RNA 5′-methyltransferases (34Koonin E.V. J. Gen. Virol. 1993; 74: 733-740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Rozanov M.N. Koonin E.V. Gorbalenya A.E. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 2129-2134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but has not been directly demonstrated for any flavivirus NS5. In DEN2-infected cells, NS3 and NS5 exist as a stable complex, suggesting that viral replication and 5′-capping are closely linked (36Kapoor M. Zhang L. Ramachandra M. Kusukawa J. Ebner K.E. Padmanabhan R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19100-19106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The NTPase activity of dengue virus type 1 NS3 was stimulated by NS5 (37Cui T. Sugrue R.J. Xu Q. Lee A.K. Chan Y.C. Fu J. Virology. 1998; 246: 409-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and this observation is consistent with the role of these proteins as a complex in viral replication. The in vitro replication systems developed to study positive strand RNA replication have revealed that viral replicases mostly are membrane-bound complexes containing the viral RdRP as well as other cellular and viral proteins. These in vitro RdRP assays utilize exogenous RNA templates and either crude or purified components of viral replicases that catalyze specific synthesis of RNA (38Blumenthal T. Carmichael G.G. Annu.

Viral replicases recognize specific elements contained within the 5′- and 3′-terminal regions of the viral genomes for initiation of viral replication (46Esteban R. Fujimura T. Wickner R.B.

In flavivirus genomes, two conserved sequences within the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) as well as stem-loop structures within the 3′- and 5′-UTRs of flavivirus genomes are thought to be important for viral RNA replication (50Zeng L. Falgout B. Markoff L. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 7510-7522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 59Rice C.M. Lenches E.M. Eddy S.R. Shin S.J. Sheets R.L. Strauss J.H.

Hahn Y.S. Rice C.M. Lee E. Dalgarno L. Strauss E.G. Strauss J.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 33-41Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Within the 3′-conserved sequence of the dengue virus genome, 94 nucleotides (nt) from the 3′-terminus, there is a 9-nt motif that is complementary to a conserved motif within the 5′ terminal region (5′-TR), located 133 nucleotides from the 5′-terminus. These motifs are separated by 10.5 kilobases in the full-length viral RNA. It was proposed that these motifs could bring the two ends of the genome together through base pairing interactions and play a role in viral replication. Hence, these motifs are referred to as “cyclization” (CYC) motifs (63Hahn C.S. Hahn Y.S. Rice C.M. Lee E. Dalgarno L. Strauss E.G. Strauss J.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 33-41Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, we described an in vitro RdRP assay system derived from whole cell lysates isolated from DEN2-infected mosquito (C6/36) or monkey (LLC-MK-2) cells. These active viral replicase complexes can utilize exogenous RNA templates that contained the 5′-TR and 3′-UTR of DEN2 RNA with the internal coding sequences deleted (hereafter referred as “subgenomic RNA”) and synthesize (−) strand RNA (64You S. Padmanabhan R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33714-33722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). There were two products formed in the in vitroRdRP assay; the first was a labeled template with the same size as the input RNA (770 nt), and the second was twice that of the template (∼1540 nt). Using this system, we showed that there is an interaction between the two terminal regions of the viral RNA which is required for RNA synthesis (64You S. Padmanabhan R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33714-33722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Subsequently, a physical interaction between the two RNAs was also demonstrated using the psoralen/UV cross-linking method, and the two CYC motifs played an essential role for both physical interaction and for RNA synthesis. These results suggested that there is cross-talk between the two terminal regions through the conserved sequence elements in the viral RNA that is required for (−) strand RNA synthesis (65You S. Falgout B. Markoff L. Padmanabhan R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15581-15591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Mutational analysis revealed that RNA synthesis at the 3′-UTR of the subgenomic RNA template requires the 5′-UTR and the highly conserved 5′-CYC motif, which is complementary to the 3′-CYC motif within the 3′-UTR. Also required is the 3′ stem-loop structure that includes a predicted pseudoknot structure. Furthermore, it was shown that the complementarity between the two CYC motifs rather than the actual sequences was important for RNA synthesis (64You S. Padmanabhan R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33714-33722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 65You S. Falgout B. Markoff L. Padmanabhan R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15581-15591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). A recent study using a Kunjin viral RNA replicon cell line also revealed that the complementarity rather than actual sequence of CYC motifs are required for replication of Kunjin viral replicon RNA in vivo (66Khromykh A.A. Meka H. Guyatt K.J. Westaway E.G. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 6719-6728Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Previous studies on flavivirus replication intermediates using Kunjin virus, dengue virus, and West Nile virus revealed that, in flavivirus-infected cells, three RNA species were detected: a genomic RNA of 40–44 S, a double-stranded RNase-resistant replicative form of 20–22 S, and a partially RNase-sensitive replicative intermediate of 20–28 S RNA species (24Chu P.W. Westaway E.G. Virology. 1985; 140: 68-79Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Grun J.B. Brinton M.A. J. Virol. 1986; 60: 1113-1124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 67Cleaves G.R. Ryan T.E. Schlesinger R.W. Virology. 1981; 111: 73-83Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The analysis of virus-specific RNAs isolated from Kunjin virus-infected cells in completely denaturing formaldehyde-agarose gels (similar to the one used for analysis ofin vitro RdRP products in our studies) did not reveal the presence of any species larger than genome size RNA (24Chu P.W. Westaway E.G. Virology. 1985; 140: 68-79Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that the copy-back mechanism of RNA synthesis resulting in dimer species is not detectable in infected cells under the experimental conditions and might be unique to the in vitrosystems using either infected cell lysates or purified polymerase (in this study). Moreover, for replication of positive strand RNA viral genomes in general, de novo initiation is considered to be the key mechanism. The 3′-terminal elongation event resulting in dimer species, on the other hand, would result in loss of genome sequences. Because template size and hairpin RNA products were both formed in ourin vitro RdRP assays, several questions remained to be addressed: How are these two species related? Are those products of specific structures of the template and/or different enzyme conformations? Is the template size product produced by de novo initiation of RNA synthesis or is it the byproduct of the hairpin RNA by nucleolytic attack at the single-stranded loop region? To address these questions, in this study, we expressed full-length NS5 with an N-terminal histidine tag in E. coli. We purified the protein to >90% in a soluble form. The purified protein is active in the synthesis of (−) strand RNA from positive strand subgenomic RNA templates but not from an RNA containing only the 3′-UTR or from nonspecific RNA templates to any significant extent. For optimal RNA synthesis, 5′-TR and 3′-UTR are both required as well as the wild type or complementary mutant CYC motifs. These results prove that the NS5 protein alone exhibits specificity for the DEN2 viral subgenomic RNA and is able to initiate (−) strand RNA synthesis de novowithout the requirement of other viral or host cofactors. At the same time, the purified RdRP also synthesizes a hairpin RNA product by 3′ end elongation. Interestingly, the ratio between de novo and hairpin products formed was directly dependent on the incubation temperature of the RdRP reaction during the initiation phase, but not during the elongation phase of viral RNA synthesis. Temperature is known to influence the structure of nucleic acid or protein. Based on the recently reported structural differences between polioviral and hepatitis C virus (HCV) RdRPs (68Hong Z. Cameron C.E. Walker M.P. Castro C. Yao N. Lau J.Y. Zhong W. Virology. 2001; 285: 6-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), we propose a model in which DEN2 RdRP enzyme assumes two conformations that are in equilibrium. According to this model, a temperature-dependent shift of the equilibrium could determine how the enzyme recognizes the conformation of the template RNA that ultimately results in RNA synthesis by de novo initiation or by 3′ end elongation. A BamHI restriction site was engineered into our previously described pLZ-5 plasmid (69Zhang L. Padmanabhan R. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 129: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), which contains the coding sequence for NS5. PCR was carried out using the primers 5′-CGCGGATCCTCGGAACTGGCAACATAGGAGAGA-3′ and 5′-CGACACAGCGTGATGGTCCG-3′ (nt 7570–7591 and nt 7716–7735, respectively, in the DEN2 genome (Ref. 4Irie K. Mohan P.M. Sasaguri Y. Putnak R. Padmanabhan R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 75: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar)) and pLZ-5 as the template, producing a 175-base pair fragment. The PCR fragment contained the DEN2-encoded NruI site at the 3′ end and an engineered in-frame BamHI site at the 5′ end. The PCR product was then blunt end-ligated into pLZ-5, which had been previously digested withNruI. This intermediate plasmid was subjected toBamHI digestion, and the fragment was cloned into pQE-32 at the BamHI site to give rise to pMHA-77-3 plasmid. The plasmid contains full-length DEN2 NS5 with an N-terminal 6-histidine tag under control of the lac promoter. E. coli (XL1-Blue) cells (1-liter culture), transformed with pMHA-77-3 plasmid were grown in LB media containing 100 µg/ml ampicillin and 0.5% glucose (w/v) at 37 °C untilA 600 nm reached 0.55. Bacteria were then centrifuged at 5,000 × g in a Beckman HS-4 rotor at 4 °C for 20 min. The pellet was resuspended in LB media containing 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and ampicillin, and incubated for 10 h at 18 °C. Bacteria were pelleted and lysed by French press in 80 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 1× Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture without EDTA purchased fromRoche Molecular Biochemicals (Mannheim, Germany). Lysate was then incubated with 1.5 ml of Talon resin (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) at 4 °C for 1 h. The resin was batch-washed five times, with 12 ml of buffer A containing 50 mmNaH2PO4, pH 7.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol. After transfer of Talon resin to a disposable Bio-Rad column, nonspecific proteins were removed by washing with 40 ml of the buffer A containing 15 mm imidazole (pH 7.1), followed with 25 ml of 20 mm imidazole in the same buffer. Proteins were eluted from the Talon resin with buffer A containing 0.5 mimidazole. NS5-containing fractions were pooled, concentrated by Centricon-30 (Millipore, Bedford, MA) to ∼500 µl, and applied to a G-75 Sephadex (Sigma) column. Proteins were eluted from the column in 0.5-ml fractions at 5 ml/h. NS5 was eluted between fractions 21 and 30. Fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, and 40% glycerol. Purified NS5 protein was aliquoted and stored at −20 °C. Contruction of the plasmid encoding DEN2 subgenomic RNA has been described (64You S. Padmanabhan R. J. Biol.

RNA templates were prepared by T7-RNA polymerase (Promega)-catalyzed in vitro transcription of linearized plasmids (pTM1 cut withBamHI or KpnI), or PCR products produced from the plasmid templates as described previously (64You S. Padmanabhan R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33714-33722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). RNA was quantified by spectrophotometry and the integrity was verified by denaturing urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by staining with acridine orange. The standard reaction mixture (50 µl) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, template RNA (1 µg), 500 µm each of ATP, GTP, and UTP, 10 µmunlabeled CTP, and 10 µCi of [α-32P]CTP along with 200 ng of purified NS5 except when indicated. The reaction was carried out by incubation at 30 °C for 1 h and terminated by acid phenol/chloroform extraction, followed by ethanol precipitation after the addition of yeast tRNA (5 µg) as a carrier. The RNA pellet was collected by centrifugation, and the pellet was dried. RNA was resuspended in 50 µl of nuclease-free H2O and passed through a Bio-Rad P-30 column to remove unincorporated nucleotides. Flow-through fraction was precipitated with ethanol. RNA was analyzed by formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography (64You S. Padmanabhan R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33714-33722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The labeled bands were excised from dried gels and quantified by liquid scintillation counting and also analyzed by densitometry utilizing the NIH program Scion. RdRP reactions at different temperatures were carried out using a gradient thermocycler (Tgradient, Biometra, Göttingen, Germany). The reactions were terminated and analyzed as described above. The 3′-hydroxyl of RNA transcripts was blocked by sodium periodate as described previously (64You S. Padmanabhan R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33714-33722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Reactions were phenol-extracted and ethanol-precipitated as described above. To isolate the initiation and elongation phases of RNA synthesis by NS5, we altered previously described protocols for use with our system (70Sun J.H. Adkins S. Faurote G. Kao C.C.

Subgenomic RNA770 nt was incubated at 30 °C for 10 min with 500 µm each of three nucleotides (ATP, GTP, and CTP), 10 µCi of [α-32P]CTP, and 200 ng of purified NS5 to allow partial synthesis of RNA (based on the template sequence to be six nucleotides). Heparin (50 ng) was then added (2 µl of 25 ng/µl) and incubated for 5 min before the addition of UTP (500 µm). Reactions were then allowed to complete elongation synthesis for 60 min. To study the influence of varying the temperature of incubation on initiation phase of RNA synthesis, reactions were incubated at different temperatures with the enzyme and three nucleotides, but were moved to a constant temperature (30.8 °C) after the addition of heparin and the fourth nucleotide. To study the effect of variations on the elongation phase of RNA synthesis, reactions as described above were all kept at 30.8 °C until after the addition of heparin; UTP was then added, and incubations were continued at differing temperatures for 60 min. To determine the polarity of the RdRP products, strand-specific oligodeoxynucleotide primers of negative and positive polarity were synthesized and used for reverse transcriptase-catalyzed cDNA synthesis, followed by PCR (RT-PCR) amplification of cDNAs. Because there was an excess of positive stranded subgenomic RNA template used for the RdRP reaction and this interfered with annealing of the DNA primers, the RdRP reaction mixtures were subjected to RNase A digestion to remove all single-stranded RNA. The portion of the positive strand RNA template annealed to the newly synthesized negative strand would be resistant to RNase A digestion. Samples of RNA product after RNase A digestion were mixed with 20 µmol of either positive (5′-AGCTGTACGATGGCGTAG-3′) or negative strand (5′- CTACGCCATCGTACAGCT-3′) primer and were denatured in a 11-µl solution at 95 °C for 2 min, followed by a slow cooling to 65 °C. Reactions were then incubated on ice for 2 min. The reverse transcriptase reactions were carried out using a kit (Superscript II, Life Technologies, Inc.) according to manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the reaction mixtures (8 µl) contained 2.5 mmdNTPs, 1× First Strand Buffer, 50 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 units of RNasin inhibitor (Pro- mega). Reactions were incubated for 2 min at 42 °C, before addition of 2 units (1 µl) of Superscript II reverse transcriptase. Reactions were incubated for 50 min at 42 °C and stopped by incubation at 70 °C for 15 min. Dilutions of this mixture were then used for standard PCR with DNA primers. For negative strand visualization, 5′-AGAACCTGTTGATTCAACAGCACC-3′ and 5′-AGCTGTACGATGGCGTAG-3′ were utilized. For positive strand visualization, 5′-ACCGCGTGTCGACTGTACAACAGCTGA-3′ and 5′-CTACGCCATCGTACAGCT-3′ were used. The PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining and photographed using a Kodak digital camera. Initial attempts to express full-length NS5 were unsuccessful because of toxicity of NS5 toE. coli; the bacteria were able to grow only to anA 600 of about 0.35. We made use of previous observations that growth in glucose maintains a low level of cAMP and cAMP activator protein (also known as cAMP receptor protein), allowing the repression of lac promoter, resulting in a tight regulation of T7 RNA polymerase and NS5 expression. Prior to induction of the lac promoter with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, glucose was removed. The expression of full-length NS5 protein was significantly improved under these conditions; however, the protein was primarily located in the insoluble pellet fraction (data not shown). To max"

Here we examine the contribution of adipose tissue to the systemic elevation of acute phase reactants associated with chronic hyperglycemia. We demonstrate that adipose tissue expresses a number of acute phase reactants at high levels, including serum amyloid A3 (SAA3), αl-acid glycoprotein, the lipocalin 24p3 as well as plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). Additionally, we show SAA3 is expressed at low levels under normal conditions but in the diabetic state is dramatically up-regulated in adipose tissue while down-regulated in liver. Furthermore, pro-inflammatory stimuli and high glucose can lead to the induction of SAA3 in adipose tissue <i>in vivo</i> as well as in the 3T3-L1 adipocyte cell line. Adipose tissue may therefore play a major role in the pathogenic sequelae of Type II diabetes, in particular the cardiovascular problems associated with prolonged hyperglycemia."
https://openalex.org/W2148910944,"Guanine nucleotide exchange factors of the Dbl family relay signals from membrane receptors to Rho family GTPases. We now demonstrate that a longer transcript of the Lbc gene encodes a chimeric molecule, which we have called AKAP-Lbc, that functions as an A-kinase-anchoring protein (AKAP) and a Rho-selective guanine nucleotide exchange factor. Expression of AKAP-Lbc in fibroblasts favors the formation of stress fibers in a Rho-dependent manner. Application of lysophosphatidic acid or selective expression of Gα12 enhances cellular AKAP-Lbc activation. Furthermore, biochemical studies indicate that AKAP-Lbc functions as an adaptor protein to selectively couple Gα12 to Rho. Thus, AKAP-Lbc anchors PKA and nucleates the assembly of a Rho-mediated signaling pathway."

IRS-2 is an important IRS protein, as it mediates peripheral insulin action and β-cell survival. In this study, we show that insulin, IGF-1, or osmotic stress promoted ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated degradation of IRS-2 in 3T3-L1 cells, Fao hepatoma, cells and mouse embryo fibroblasts; however, insulin/IGF-1 did not promote degradation of IRS-1 in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes or mouse embryo fibroblasts. MG132 or lactacystin, specific inhibitors of 26S proteasome, blocked insulin/IGF-1-induced degradation of IRS-2 and enhanced the detection of ubiquitinated IRS-2.

Chronic insulin or IGF-1 treatment of IRS-1-deficient mouse embryo fibroblasts inhibited IRS-2-mediated activation of Akt and ERK1/2, which was reversed by lactacystin pretreatment. By contrast, IRS-1 activation of Akt and ERK1/2 was not inhibited by chronic insulin/IGF-1 stimulation in IRS-2-deficient mouse embryo fibroblasts.

IRS proteins mediate signal specificity and diversity in various cellular backgrounds (1Yenush L. White M.F. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Upon ligand binding, the activated insulin/IGF-1 receptors engage IRS proteins and promote the phosphorylation of multiple tyrosine residues, which activate various downstream signaling pathways, including the phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase and MAP kinase cascades (1Yenush L.

Deletion of IRS-1 in mice impairs somatic growth and causes peripheral insulin resistance, but diabetes rarely develops owing to lifelong compensatory hyperinsulinemia (5Tamemoto H. Kadowaki T.

By contrast, IRS-2 is essential for normal nutrient homeostasis because it mediates both peripheral insulin action and the effect of IGF-1 on β-cell growth; mice lacking IRS-2 fail to maintain sufficient compensatory insulin secretion and develop diabetes as young adults (7Withers D.J. Gutierrez J.S. Towery H. Burks D.J. Ren J.M. Previs S. Zhang Y. Bernal D. Pons S. Shulman G.I. Bonner-Weir S. White M.F. Nature. 1998; 391: 900-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar). Moreover, female mice lacking IRS-2 are hyperplasic and infertile, owing to a failure of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis (8Burks D.J. de Mora J.F. Schubert M. Withers D.J. Myers M.G.

However, there is no convincing evidence showing that the decrease of endogenous IRS-1 via the ubiquitin/proteasome system contributes to an inhibition of insulin signaling. Proteasome-mediated degradation regulates many biological processes including gene transcription and cell cycle progression (18Tyers M. Willems A.R.

However, it is unclear whether insulin promotes ubiquitination of endogenous IRS proteins or whether the ubiquitin/proteasome system inhibits IRS protein signaling. In this work, we show that insulin and IGF-1 stimulate ubiquitination and degradation of IRS-2 in multiple cell types via a PI 3-kinase/Akt/mTOR-dependent pathway, which correlates closely with the inhibition of insulin signaling. This negative feedback mechanism might limit the magnitude and duration of IRS-2-mediated signals, and contribute to insulin resistance associated with hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia. Human insulin and IGF-1 were a gift from Eli Li. Protein A-agarose was purchased from Repligen; 3-isobutylmethylxanthine, dexamethasone, aprotinin, and leupeptin were purchased from Sigma. Enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Lactacystin, MG132, rapamycin, PD98059, LY294002, wortmannin, and Nonidet P-40 were purchased from Calbiochem. Polyclonal anti-active ERK1/2 (αpERK) was purchased from Promega. Polyclonal anti-phospho-Akt (on Ser-473) (αpAkt) was purchased from New England Biolabs Inc. (Beverly, MA); monoclonal anti-ubiquitin was purchased from Santa Cruz Inc; polyclonal anti-IRS-1 antibodies were raised against the full-length rat IRS-1 (JD#159, used at a dilution of 1:15,000 for immunoblotting). Polyclonal anti-IRS-2 antibodies were raised in the laboratory against amino acids 976–1094 (JD#110) or 618–747 (JD#101) of rat IRS-2. Polyclonal anti-p85 antibodies were raised against the N-terminal SH2 domain of p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase. Fao cells were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were grown at 37 °C in 10% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 25 mm glucose, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, and 10% calf serum (HyClone Laboratories, Inc). For adipocyte differentiation, confluent preadipocytes were cultured for 3 days in differentiation medium (DMEM supplemented with 25 mm glucose, 1 µm insulin, 0.5 mm3-isobutylmethylxanthine, 1 µm dexamethasone, and 10% FBS), and 3 days in DMEM supplemented with 1 µm insulin and 10% FBS. The cells were then grown for an additional 4–9 days in DMEM containing 25 mm glucose and 10% FBS without any other additives (>90% cells are adipocytes). The generation of IRS-1 and IRS-2 knockout mice has been described previously (5Tamemoto H. Kadowaki T. Tobe K. Yagi T. Sakura H. Hayakawa T. Terauchi Y. Ueki K. Kaburagi Y. Satoh S. Sekihara H.

After removal of the head and all internal organs, embryo carcasses were washed with PBS, minced with scissors, and incubated with 0.25% trypsin on ice overnight. The embryos were incubated for an additional 20 min at 37 °C to activate trypsin. Growth medium (DMEM supplemented with 25 mm glucose, 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin) was added to stop trypsin action, and the embryos were disrupted by vigorous pipetting. The resulting single cell suspension was centrifuged for 6 min at 1000 rpm. The cell pellet was resuspended in growth medium and cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The MEF cells reached confluence in 2 days and were replated every 72 h at a density of 5 × 103 cells/cm2 until the establishment of permanent cell lines. Confluent cells were deprived of serum overnight in DMEM (for 3T3-L1 and MEF cells) or RPMI 1640 (for Fao cells) containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and treated with different ligands at 37 °C. The cells were rinsed three times with ice-cold PBSV (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na3VO4), solubilized in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 100 mm NaF, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 µg/ml aprotinin, 10 µg/ml leupeptin), and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (cell lysates) was boiled for 5 min in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 2% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.004% bromphenol blue) and separated by SDS-PAGE. In some experiments, the supernatant was incubated with the indicated antibody on ice for 2 h. The immune complexes were collected on protein A-agarose during a 1-h incubation at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with washing buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA) and boiled for 5 min in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The solubilized proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins on the gel were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and detected by immunoblotting with the indicated antibody using ECL. Some membranes were subsequently incubated at 55 °C for 30 min in stripping buffer (100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7) to prepare them for a second round of immunoblotting. To make clear cell lysates, cells were scraped in PBS, centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 1 min at 4 °C, and boiled for 5 min in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. To determine whether insulin and IGF-1 decrease IRS-2 protein levels, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were treated for 6 h with either insulin (100 nm) or IGF-1 (100 ng/ml). Cell lysates prepared in 1% Nonidet P-40 were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with polyclonal antibodies against IRS-2 (αIRS2). IRS-2 was detected in control cell lysates, but not in insulin- or IGF-1-treated cells (Fig. 1A,top panel). To verify that this protein was IRS-2, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were treated without or with insulin, and proteins in the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted with αIRS2. Insulin significantly reduced the level of IRS-2 (Fig.1 B). By contrast, insulin and IGF-1 only slightly reduced the level of IRS-1, and did not change the level of the p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase (Fig. 1 A). To exclude the possibility that IRS-2 was redistributed into an inaccessible compartment, insulin-stimulated cells were lysed in buffer containing 2% SDS, and clear lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with αIRS2. Consistent with the initial results, insulin reduced the level of IRS-2 but not p85 (Fig. 1 C). Similar results were obtained with polyclonal antibodies raised against other regions of IRS-2, excluding the possibility that phosphorylation of IRS-2 inhibited its immunoblotting by αIRS2 (Fig.1 D). The degradation of IRS-2 was tested by other growth factors and in various cell backgrounds. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were treated with epidermal growth factor (EGF) (100 ng/ml), platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF) (50 ng/ml), or insulin. As expected, insulin stimulated reduction of IRS-2, but neither EGF nor PDGF altered the level of IRS-2; the level of p85 was not changed in response to insulin, EGF, or PDGF (Fig. 1 E). Both insulin and PDGF strongly stimulated phosphorylation and activation of Akt, whereas EGF stimulated Akt to a less extent (Fig. 1 E). Insulin-induced degradation of IRS-1 or IRS-2 was compared in several cell types, including 3T3-L1 adipocytes, Fao hepatoma cells, or MEF cells from wild-type, IRS1−/−, or IRS2−/−knockout mice. The cells were treated with insulin (100 nm) for 6 h, and proteins in cell lysates were immunoblotted with αIRS1, αIRS2, or αp85. IRS-2 levels decreased in all three of the cell types, whereas IRS-1 was not reduced in wild-type and IRS2−/− MEF cells; p85 did not change (Fig.2). Osmotic stress caused by hyperglycemia might exacerbate peripheral insulin resistance and β-cell dysfunction by impairing insulin/IGF-1 signaling (26DeFronzo R.A. Diabetes Rev. 1997; 5: 177-269Google Scholar). To examine whether osmotic stress induced reduction of IRS-2, Fao cells were treated for 60 min with various concentrations of d-sorbitol. Osmotic stress dramatically reduced the level of IRS-2 but not p85 in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 3). It also reduced IRS-1 protein levels, but to a lesser extent (Fig. 3). Together, these results suggest that hyperinsulinemia and/or hyperglycemia might promote degradation of IRS-2 that exacerbates insulin/IGF-1 resistance. IRS-2 protein levels decreased after 1 h of insulin treatment and reached the lowest level within 3 h (data not shown). This rapid reduction of IRS-2 was most likely caused by proteolytic degradation rather than by inhibition of transcription and/or translation. To confirm that protein degradation was involved, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were pretreated without or with lactacystin or MG132, specific inhibitors of 26S proteasome (22Wojcik C. Drug Discov. Today. 1999; 4: 188-189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Without drug pretreatment, insulin reduced the levels of IRS-2, as described previously (Fig. 4A,lane 2 versus lane 1). However, both lactacystin and MG132 inhibited insulin-induced reduction of IRS-2 protein levels (Fig. 4 A,upper panel); lactacystin and MG132 also inhibited IGF-1-induced reduction of IRS-2 (data not shown). Similarly, insulin-induced reduction of IRS-2 was inhibited by lactacystin in Fao cells (Fig. 4 B) and MEF (data not shown). Lactacystin and MG132 did not alter the level of p85 (Fig. 4, A andB, lower panel). Insulin ordinarily stimulates a shift in mobility of IRS-2, owing largely to phosphorylation (Fig. 4 A). Lactacystin and MG132 did not significantly affect the insulin-induced mobility shift of IRS-2, suggesting that these inhibitors did not directly inhibit phosphorylation of IRS-2 (Fig. 4, A and B). Consistent with this idea, lactacystin and MG132 did not alter tyrosyl phosphorylation of IRS-1 and IRS-2 induced during 5 min of insulin stimulation (data not shown). Taken together, the data suggest that 26 S proteasome mediates the degradation of IRS-2 during insulin/IGF-1 stimulation. Ubiquitination targets proteins for degradation by 26 S proteasome (27Goldberg A.L. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Sci. Am. 2001; 284: 68-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). To determine whether insulin promoted the ubiquitination of IRS-2, Fao cells were treated for 1 h with 100 nminsulin. IRS-2 was immunoprecipitated, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-ubiquitin antibody; however, ubiquitination of IRS-2 was not detected by this experimental protocol. However, when cells were pretreated with lactacystin or MG132, insulin-stimulated ubiquitination of IRS-2 was clearly detected by immunoblotting with anti-ubiquitin, and the migration of ubiquitinated IRS-2 was significantly retarded (Fig. 4 C). Thus, under ordinary conditions, ubiquitinated IRS-2 might not accumulate to levels sufficient to be detected by immunoblotting, owing to rapid proteasome-mediated degradation. IRS proteins mediate the activation of the PI 3-kinase and the MAP kinase cascades during insulin/IGF-1 stimulation (1Yenush L. White M.F. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 2Myers Jr., M.G. White M.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 615-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). To determine whether these signaling pathways mediate degradation of IRS-2, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes or FAO cells were pretreated with wortmannin or LY294002 (inhibitors of type 1b PI 3-kinase), or PD98059 (an inhibitor of MEK1/2). As expected, both wortmannin and LY294002 blocked insulin-stimulated activation of the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathways without altering the activation of the MEK/MAP kinase cascade, whereas PD98059 inhibited insulin-stimulated activation of ERK1/2 without effect on the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathways (data not shown). Moreover, wortmannin and LY294002, but not PD98059, inhibited insulin-induced degradation of IRS-2 (Fig.5, A and B). Similarly, wortmannin and LY294002 but not PD98059 inhibited IGF-1-stimulated degradation of IRS-2 in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (data not shown). These drugs did not change the level of p85 during these experiments (Fig. 5 A). Consistent with these data, LY294002 inhibited insulin-induced ubiquitination of IRS-2 in the presence of lactacystin (Fig. 5 C). mTOR is a serine/threonine kinase downstream of the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway that contributes to the activation of p70S6 kinase (28Dennis P.B. Fumagalli S. Thomas G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 29Scott P.H. Brunn G.J. Kohn A.D. Roth R.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3504-3513PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether mTOR mediates the degradation of IRS-2, Fao cells were treated prior to insulin stimulation with rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR. Rapamycin inhibited insulin-stimulated degradation of IRS-2, as demonstrated by immunoblotting cell extracts with αIRS2 (Fig. 5 B, lane 5). Similarly, rapamycin also blocked IGF-1-stimulated degradation of IRS-2 in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (data not shown). As expected, rapamycin inhibited the activation of p70S6 kinase, as revealed by the inhibition of insulin-induced shift in mobility of p70S6 kinase that represents phosphorylation and activation of p70S6 kinase (Fig. 5 B, lane 5). Rapamycin and insulin did not alter the level of p70S6 kinase (Fig.5 B, lower panel). IRS-1 and IRS-2 mediate common and unique signals during insulin/IGF-1 action. Differential degradation of these IRS proteins may have important influence on metabolic regulation. However, this hypothesis is difficult to test in ordinary cell backgrounds that express both IRS-1 and IRS-2. To overcome these technical difficulties, MEF cells derived from IRS-1 and IRS-2 knockout mice were used. The expression of IRS-1 or IRS-2 was undetectable in IRS1−/− and IRS2−/− MEF cells, respectively (data not shown). Deletion of either IRS-1 or IRS-2 did not alter the level of insulin/IGF-1 receptors (data not shown). Both insulin and IGF-1 promoted activation of Akt as well as ERK1/2 in IRS1−/− or IRS2−/− MEF, as demonstrated by immunoblotting cell extracts with antibodies against phospho-Akt or phospho-ERK, respectively (Fig. 6,lanes 1–3). These results suggest that IRS-1 and IRS-2 are redundant in mediating insulin-stimulated activation of the PI 3-kinase/Akt and the MEK → ERK pathways in this cell background. However, insulin stimulated degradation of IRS-2 in IRS1−/− MEF, but insulin did not promote IRS-1 degradation in IRS2−/− MEF cells (Fig.2 C). To determine whether degradation of IRS-2 inhibits signaling by insulin and IGF-1, IRS1−/− MEF cells were pretreated for 4 h with 100 nm insulin or 100 ng/ml IGF-1. Cells were then washed, incubated in serum-free medium for additional 2 h, and stimulated for 5 min with 100 nm insulin or 100 ng/ml IGF-1. Activation of the PI 3-kinase → Akt and the MEK → ERK1/2 pathways was measured by immunoblotting cell extracts with antibodies against phospho-Akt or phospho-ERK1/2, respectively. Insulin or IGF-1 pretreatment did not alter the levels of Akt or ERK1/2 in these cells (Fig. 6, A and B). However, insulin pretreatment significantly reduced the activation of both Akt and ERK1/2 in response to a subsequent insulin or IGF-1 stimulation (Fig. 6, A andB). Similarly, IGF-1 pretreatment inhibited the activation of Akt and ERK1/2 induced by a subsequent insulin/IGF-1 stimulation to a greater extent (Fig. 6, A and B,lanes 7–9). IGF-1 pretreatment almost completely inhibited activation of Akt induced by subsequent insulin stimulation (Fig. 6 A, lane 8). The difference in the magnitude of inhibition between insulin and IGF-1 might reflect a higher abundance of IGF-1 receptors in MEF cells (data not shown). In the parallel experiments with IRS2−/− MEF cells, neither insulin nor IGF-1 pretreatment inhibited the activation of Akt and ERK1/2 induced by a subsequent acute stimulation with insulin or IGF-1 (Fig. 6, C and D). This resistance to the inhibition by insulin/IGF-1 pretreatment is consistent with the resistance of IRS-1 to degradation in IRS2−/− MEF cells. Moreover, these results revealed that insulin or IGF-1 pretreatment did not inhibit ligand-stimulated activation of the receptors for insulin or IGF-1, nor did it impair the PI 3-kinase/Akt and MEK/ERK1/2 pathways. Therefore, the inhibition of Akt and ERK1/2 by insulin or IGF-1 pretreatment in IRS1−/− MEF cells is most likely caused by insulin/IGF1-induced degradation of IRS-2. To confirm the hypothesis that proteasome-mediated degradation of IRS-2 contributes to down-regulation of signaling by insulin and IGF-1, IRS1−/− MEF cells were incubated for 30 min with or without the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin prior to IGF-1 pretreatment. IGF-1 pretreatment inhibited activation of Akt and ERK1/2 in response to a subsequent IGF-1 stimulation as expected. However, lactacystin completely reversed the inhibition of Akt and ERK1/2 by IGF-1 pretreatment (Fig. 7). The causes of prevalent forms of type 2 diabetes are poorly understood. Initially, patients develop mild insulin resistance and glucose intolerance. Hyperglycemia then prompts β-cells to secret compensatory insulin to overcome insulin resistance, resulting in hyperinsulinemia. Although moderate hyperinsulinemia might be well tolerated in the short term, chronic hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia exacerbate insulin resistance; if uncontrolled, this process continues until β-cells fail to compensate, resulting in diabetes (3Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar, 4Shulman G.I. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2201) Google Scholar, 26DeFronzo R.A. Diabetes Rev. 1997; 5: 177-269Google Scholar). IRS-2 is critical in both insulin action and β-cell function, as demonstrated by the finding that deletion of IRS-2 in mice causes severe insulin resistance and β-cell failure (7Withers D.J. Gutierrez J.S. Towery H. Burks D.J. Ren J.M. Previs S. Zhang Y. Bernal D. Pons S. Shulman G.I. Bonner-Weir S. White M.F. Nature. 1998; 391: 900-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar). In ob/ob mice, IRS-2 protein is undetectable in liver, which correlates with hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia, hallmarks of insulin resistance (33Kerouz N.J. Horsch D. Pons S. Kahn C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 3164-3172Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 34Shimomura I. Matsuda M. Hammer R.E. Bashmakov Y. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 77-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Exogenous leptin treatment not only reverses insulin resistance, but also increases concomitantly IRS-2 protein to a normal level (34Shimomura I. Matsuda M. Hammer R.E. Bashmakov Y. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 77-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Thus, the decrease of hepatic IRS-2 might be a major determinant for overall insulin resistance (35Michael M.D. Kulkarni R.N. Postic C. Previs S.F. Shulman G.I. Magnuson M.A. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 87-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). In this study, we showed that insulin substantially reduces IRS-2 protein levels in multiple cell lines, which is blocked by specific inhibitors of the 26 S proteasome. These results suggest that proteasome-mediated degradation of IRS-2, rather than inhibition of transcription and/or translation of IRS-2, determines IRS-2 protein levels and activation of IRS-2-mediated signaling pathways. Consistent with this idea, insulin stimulates ubiquitination of IRS-2. During our experiments, the ubiquitinated IRS-2 is detected only in the presence of proteasome inhibitors, suggesting that ubiquitinated IRS-2 is degraded rapidly by the 26 S proteasome. Consistent with these findings, deletion of insulin receptor in liver increases specifically hepatic IRS-2 by more than 5-fold (35Michael M.D. Kulkarni R.N. Postic C. Previs S.F. Shulman G.I. Magnuson M.A. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 87-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar), suggesting that the ablation of the insulin signals might block IRS-2 degradation in a whole animal. Reduction of IRS-2 by ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated proteolysis in mouse embryo fibroblasts lacking IRS-1 dramatically inhibits the activation of Akt and ERK1/2 in response to insulin/IGF-1. Strikingly, proteasome inhibitors completely reverse this inhibition. Interestingly, inhibition of the PI 3-kinase → Akt → mTOR pathway, but not the MEK → ERK1/2 pathway, prevents insulin-induced degradation of IRS-2. These observations suggest that the initial activation of the PI 3-kinase → Akt → mTOR pathway by insulin induces ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of IRS-2 by 26 S proteasome, resulting in inhibition of signaling pathways downstream of IRS-2 during subsequent insulin stimulation. This negative feedback mechanism is likely to modulate insulin action in the whole body by limiting the magnitude and duration of insulin action. Both insulin and osmotic stress stimulate proteasome-mediated degradation of IRS-2, and insulin and osmotic stress exhibit synergistic effect on destruction of IRS-2 (data not shown). Interestingly, the activity of the ubiquitin/proteasome system is elevated in diabetes, suggesting that IRS-2 degradation might be exacerbated (36Merforth S. Osmers A. Dahlmann B. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1999; 26: 83-87Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Mitch W.E. Bailey J.L Wang X. Jurkovitz C. Newby D. Price S.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1132-C1138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, proteasome-mediated degradation of IRS-2 might be involved in the development of insulin resistance and diabetes. Serine/threonine phosphorylation plays an important role in ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated destruction of signaling proteins. For instance, tumor necrosis factor α stimulates phosphorylation of IκBα at Ser-32 and Ser-36 by IKK complex, which enable β-TrCP, a F-box-containing subunit of the SCF complex, to recognize and bind to phosphorylated IκBα together with E2, resulting in the ubiquitination of IκBα. The ubiquitinated IκBα is subsequently degraded by the 26 S proteasome (19Palombella V.J. Rando O.J. Goldberg A.L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 78: 773-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1922) Google Scholar, 23Winston J.T. Strack P. Beer-Romero P. Chu C.Y. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W.

We propose a similar mechanism for IRS-2 degradation. Insulin or IGF-1 activates the PI 3-kinase → Akt → mTOR pathway. Kinase(s) within this pathway phosphorylate IRS-2, most likely on serines/threonine residues. This phosphorylated motif(s) in IRS-2 might serve as a signal tag for a specific E2·E3 complex with F-box-containing subunits. Consistent with this hypothesis, we and others observed that insulin, IGF-1, and osmotic stress promote serine/threonine phosphorylation of both IRS-1 and IRS-2 (14Rui L. Aguirre V. Kim J.K.

Serine/threonine phosphorylation of IRS-1 was reported recently to promote its degradation in some cell types (41Pederson T.M. Kramer D.L. Rondinone C.M. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 24-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), and we confirmed insulin-stimulated degradation of IRS-1 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and Fao cells. However, insulin stimulates degradation of IRS-2 in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and MEF, but fails to promote IRS-1 degradation. Thus, degradation of IRS-1 and -2 may be mediated by different mechanisms. In addition, these observations raise an intriguing possibility that, in certain insulin/IGF-1 target cells, insulin/IGF-1-promoted degradation of IRS-2 might enhance IRS-1-mediated signaling by reducing the competition by IRS-2 of common signaling molecules including receptors for insulin/IGF-1 and downstream effector molecules; therefore, proteasome-mediated degradation of IRS-2 might positively propagate insulin/IGF-1 signals in some physiological contexts. In summary, insulin and IGF-1 stimulate substantial degradation of IRS-2 mediated by the ubiquitin/proteasome system in multiple cell types, leading to an inhibition of insulin/IGF-1 signaling. The PI 3-kinase → Akt → mTOR pathway is required for insulin/IGF-1-induced degradation of IRS-2. We propose that the ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated degradation of IRS-2 is a component of negative feedback inhibition modulating the action of insulin and IGF-1. Inhibitors of 26 S proteasome significantly improve insulin sensitivity, suggesting that these types of agents might have clinical value in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes.

The mechanism by which PI therapy leads to lipid abnormalities remains unclear, thus limiting the options for effective treatment of HIV-infected individuals. The urgency of designing agents that are less likely to induce lipid disturbances has prompted numerous studies aimed at understanding the relationship between PI therapy and abnormalities in lipid metabolism and preadipocyte differentiation. However, cell culture studies have yielded conflicting results with the PI either suppressing (10Zhang B. MacNaul K. Szalkowski D. Li Z. Berger J. Moller D.E. J. Clin. Endocrinol.

These studies also focused primarily on PI effects on transcription factors that are responsible for regulating lipid metabolism pathways and adipocyte differentiation genes, such as the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (14Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3101) Google Scholar), the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (15MacDonald O.A. Lane M.D. Ann. Rev.

Accordingly, the lipodystrophic and hyperlipidemic effects of PI in vivo have not been defined. Additionally, the contribution of different dietary nutrients on PI-induced lipid abnormalities has not been addressed. In this study, we examined the effect of ritonavir, a prototype PI that elicits potent lipid abnormalities in patients (18Periard D. Telenti A. Sudre P. Cheseaux J.J. Halfon P. Reymond M.J.

The results showed that ritonavir-induced lipodystrophy and hyperlipidemia are caused by PI-induced accumulation of activated SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 in the nucleus, thereby increasing the expression of genes responsible for lipid biosynthesis in adipocytes and in the liver. Six- to 8-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, Maine) and were housed according to our institutional guidelines. The animals were fed either a standard mouse chow containing 4% (w/w) fat and 0.04% (w/w) cholesterol (Harlan Teklad Laboratories, Madison, Wisconsin) or a Western type high fat diet containing 21% (w/w) anhydrous milk fat and 0.15% (w/w) cholesterol (T88137 from Harlan Teklad). Half of the mice from each dietary group were gavaged every morning with 50 μl ritonavir (2 mg/day), while the other half of the animals received equal volume of a 22% ethanol solution as vehicle control. On the day of experiments, animals were gavaged with the test reagent and then fasted for 4 h before use. Blood samples were collected from mice under anesthesia after a 4-h fast. Plasma was obtained by centrifugation and then analyzed for cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations with kits purchased from Wako Chemicals (Richmond, Virginia). Lipoprotein distribution in plasma was analyzed by fast performance liquid chromatography with 2 tandem Superose 6 HR columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Two hundred μl of pooled plasma from four mice in each group were applied to the columns and 0.5 ml fractions were collected for cholesterol analysis. Lipoprotein elution profile was determined by comparison with standard VLDL, LDL, and HDL. Mice were injected with 15 mCi of 3H2O and were exsanguinated after 1 h. The liver and brown and white adipose tissues were collected. The digitonin-precipitable sterols were isolated from saponified samples (21Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Hammer R.E.

Liver and white adipose tissue were removed from control and ritonavir-treated animals. Tissues were immediately rinsed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then used for preparation of membrane and nuclear extracts using the procedure as described by Sheng et al. (23Sheng Z.

Hybridoma cells producing these antibodies, which were originally prepared in the Brown and Goldstein Laboratory, were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, Virginia). Hepatic membrane proteins were also immunoblotted with LDL receptor antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) to determine LDL receptor expression. The immunoreactive products were detected by incubation with either horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG (for the SREBPs) or anti-goat IgG (for LDL receptor) and then developed with ECL reagent obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Total RNA was prepared as described previously (26Kissel J.A. Fontaine R.N. Turck C. Brockman H.L. Hui D.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1006: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Ten μg of liver or adipose tissue RNA were electrophoresed in 1% formaldehyde-denatured agarose gels, transferred to nitrocellulose paper, and hybridized with 32P-labeled cDNA probes for mouse SREBP-1, SREBP-2, fatty acid synthase, and HMG-CoA reductase. These cDNA probes were obtained by polymerase chain reaction from first strand cDNA using mouse liver total RNA, using primers and conditions exactly as described by Shimano et al. (27Shimano H. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1575-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). A rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA probe (28Tso J.Y. Sun X.H. Kao T.H. Reece K.S. Wu R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 2485-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1759) Google Scholar) was used as control for normalization of sample loading. Hybridization was performed with conditions as described previously (29Huang Y. Hui D.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1214: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Blots were exposed to x-ray films at −70 °C. The autoradiograph was scanned and then quantitated by computer image analysis (Scion, Frederick, MD). Hybridization signal for each experimental cDNA probe was normalized against that obtained with the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA probe. Samples from chow-fed, vehicle-treated mice were taken as the baseline value in each case. Livers removed from mice were rinsed with cold phosphate buffered saline and immediately photographed. In other samples, sections of the liver were immediately embedded in freezing compound (HistoprepTM, Fisher Scientific), wrapped in foil, and submerged into liquid nitrogen for sectioning with a cryostat. The resulting tissue sections were stained with Oil Red O stain. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. For parametric data, means were compared by 1-way ANOVA followed by the Turkey test. For nonparametric data, the Mann-Whitney rank sum test was used. Male C57BL/6 mice fed either a basal low fat/low cholesterol diet or a Western type diet containing 21% milk fat and 0.15% cholesterol were treated with 2 mg of ritonavir or an equal volume of an ethanolic solution without ritonavir for 10 days. At the end of the experimental period, blood samples were collected from fasting mice for plasma lipid analyses. We found that ritonavir treatment induced a 37% increase in both plasma triglyceride and cholesterol levels under basal dietary conditions (Table I). Whereas animals fed a Western type diet exhibited elevated plasma triglyceride and cholesterol levels; 67% higher plasma triglyceride and 78% higher cholesterol levels were observed in the ritonavir-treated mice compared with the vehicle-treated mice (Table I). Analysis of plasma lipoproteins from control and ritonavir-treated mice by fast performance liquid chromatography revealed that ritonavir treatment resulted in increase in all three major lipoprotein classes, including VLDL, IDL/LDL, and HDL under both control and Western type high fat dietary conditions (Fig. 1). The increase in VLDL was most pronounced when the animals were treated with ritonavir in combination with feeding a high fat diet (Fig.1B). These results documented that the mouse is a good model to explore the mechanism for the lipid abnormalities associated with PI therapy.Table IPhenotypic comparison of vehicle- and ritonavir-treated mice fed basal or Western type high fat dietParametersBasal low fat dietWestern type high fat dietVehicle-treatedRitonavir-treatedVehicle-treatedRitonavir-treatedPlasma triglycerides (mg/dL)62.07 ± 4.6085.36 ± 10.311-aStatistically significant difference from the vehicle-treated control group fed similar diet atp < 0.05.57.64 ± 3.2096.51 ± 16.31-aStatistically significant difference from the vehicle-treated control group fed similar diet atp < 0.05.Plasma cholesterol (mg/dL)73.65 ± 7.27100.63 ± 18.041-aStatistically significant difference from the vehicle-treated control group fed similar diet atp < 0.05.114.68 ± 7.70204.63 ± 26.721-aStatistically significant difference from the vehicle-treated control group fed similar diet atp < 0.05.Body weight (g)21.10 ± 0.720.2 ± 0.323.1 ± 0.926.1 ± 0.41-aStatistically significant difference from the vehicle-treated control group fed similar diet atp < 0.05.Liver weight (g)0.85 ± 0.091.26 ± 0.051-aStatistically significant difference from the vehicle-treated control group fed similar diet atp < 0.05.0.92 ± 0.061.51 ± 0.031-aStatistically significant difference from the vehicle-treated control group fed similar diet atp < 0.05.Liver cholesterol (g/tissue)2.95 ± 0.023.17 ± 0.229.77 ± 1.3020.54 ± 2.781-aStatistically significant difference from the vehicle-treated control group fed similar diet atp < 0.05.Liver weight/body weight (%)4.01 ± 0.366.23 ± 0.211-aStatistically significant difference from the vehicle-treated control group fed similar diet atp < 0.05.3.99 ± 0.195.79 ± 0.161-aStatistically significant difference from the vehicle-treated control group fed similar diet atp < 0.05.Each value represents the mean ± S.E.M. from at least 4 mice per group.1-a Statistically significant difference from the vehicle-treated control group fed similar diet atp < 0.05.

The etiology of hyperlipidemia after PI therapy was explored by comparing rates of de novo lipid synthesis in control and ritonavir-treated mice fed either the low fat basal chow diet or a Western type high fat diet for 10 days. Under low fat dietary conditions, sterol synthesis rates in the liver were induced 2-fold after ritonavir treatment (Fig. 2,left panel). The feeding of a high fat/high cholesterol diet decreased sterol biosynthetic rates in the liver, which is consistent with previous reports (30Gould R.G. Taylor C.B. Hagerman J.S. Warner I. Campbell D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1953; 201: 519-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, ritonavir treatment did elevate sterol synthesis rates in the liver under these conditions by ∼2-fold (Fig. 2, right panel). In contrast, fatty acid biosynthetic rates in the liver, which were not suppressed by high fat feeding, were induced after ritonavir treatment under both dietary conditions (Fig.3A). Although fatty acid synthesis rates under basal dietary conditions increased by only ∼60% with ritonavir treatment (Fig. 3A), the difference was highly significant (p = 0.04). Interestingly, ritonavir treatment induced a 2.6-fold increase in fatty acid synthesis rates in mice fed the high fat diet (Fig. 3A).Figure 3Fatty acid synthesis rates in liver (A), white adipose tissue (B), and brown adipose tissue (C) of control and ritonavir-treated mice fed either chow or a Western type diet.Data are presented as nmol of 3H2O converted to fatty acids/h/g of tissue. Data represent the mean ± S.E. of six mice per group. Asterisks denote significant differences (p < 0.05) in fatty acid synthesis rates between treated and control mice fed the same diet.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fatty acid synthesis rates in white adipose tissue were also induced by ritonavir treatment, albeit not to the same extent as those observed in the liver. When the animals were fed the basal low fat chow diet, fatty acid synthesis rates were only marginally increased (∼30%) in white adipose tissue (Fig. 3B). Under high fat dietary conditions, ritonavir induced a ∼70% increase in fatty acid synthesis rates in this tissue (Fig. 3B). Importantly, fatty acid synthesis rates were increased by 2.1-fold over basal levels when the animals received both the Western type diet and the protease inhibitor. The most dramatic difference in fatty acid biosynthetic rates was observed in brown adipose tissue. When the animals were fed the basal low fat diet or the Western type high fat diet, ritonavir treatment increased fatty acid synthesis rates in this tissue by 2.8- and 2.0-fold, respectively (Fig. 3C). Previous studies have clearly documented that fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis are regulated by SREBP-1c and SREBP-2 in vivo (21Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Hammer R.E. Goldstein J.L. Shimano H. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2331-2339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Shimano H. Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 846-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). Thus, we compared SREBP-1 mRNA levels in liver and in white and brown adipose tissues of control and ritonavir-treated mice fed either the basal or the Western diet. However, no influence of PI on the mRNA levels of this SREBP was observed (Fig.4). Because both SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 are synthesized as precursor forms that can be activated by proteases (32Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11041-11048Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar), immunoblot analysis was performed to determine the level of precursor and activated forms of SREBPs in the membrane and nucleus of liver and adipose tissue after ritonavir treatment. Results clearly showed that while ritonavir had no influence on the level of the precursor form of SREBP in membranes (Fig. 5a), increased levels of both activated SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 were observed in hepatic nuclear extracts under both low fat and high fat dietary conditions (Fig. 5, b–d). Ritonavir also increased the level of activated SREBP-1 in the nucleus of white adipose tissue when the animals were fed the low fat diet (Fig. 5b). However, SREBP-1 levels in the nucleus of adipose tissue were too low after high fat feeding for the assessment of a ritonavir effect (Fig.5c). Activated SREBP-2 in adipose tissue was undetectable regardless of the feeding conditions of the animals, which is consistent with the low level of cholesterol biosynthesis in this tissue.Figure 5Immunoblot analysis of SREBP levels in liver and adipose tissues of vehicle-treated and ritonavir-treated mice. Panel a shows the level of precursor SREBP-1 in hepatic membranes of vehicle-treated (−) or ritonavir-treated (+) mice fed a chow diet (left panel) or a Western type diet (right panel) for 10 days. Panel b shows results of activated SREBP-1 levels in the nucleus of chow-fed mice. Panel cshows results of SREBP-1 levels in the nucleus of mice fed Western type diet. Panel d shows results of SREBP-2 levels in the nucleus of liver from mice fed either a chow (left panel) or Western type (right panel) diet.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The accumulation of activated SREBPs in the nucleus suggests that genes responsive to these transcription factors may be constitutively induced after ritonavir treatment. To test this hypothesis, we used RNA isolated from the liver and adipose tissue of control and ritonavir-treated mice for Northern blot hybridization analysis with32P-labeled cDNA probes for fatty acid synthase, HMG-CoA synthase, and HMG-CoA reductase. A 32P-labeled probe directed against glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as the control to normalize the amount of total RNA in each sample. Results showed a consistent increase in the mRNA levels for these lipid metabolism genes from 1.2- to 2.5-fold after ritonavir treatment (data not shown). The mRNA level of LDL receptor in the liver was too low for detection by Northern blot analysis under any of the treatment conditions. However, Western blot analysis of liver membranes with LDL receptor antibodies revealed ritonavir-induction of LDL expression in the liver under both basal and high fat dietary conditions (Fig. 6). Thus, the SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 accumulated in the nucleus of ritonavir-treated mice are functionally active, resulting in increased expression of genes involved in fatty acid and cholesterol metabolism. Previous studies in transgenic mice documented that over-accumulation of either activated SREBP-1a, SREBP-1c, or SREBP-2 leads to liver enlargement and fatty liver (21Horton J.D. Shimomura I.

Although liver dysfunction associated with PI therapy has only been reported in patients treated with ritonavir together with saquinavir (36Fatkenheuer G. Hoetelmans R.M. Hunn N. Schwenk A. Franzen C. Reiser M. Jutte A. Rockstroh J. Diehl V. Salzberger B. AIDS. 1999; 13: 1485-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), or in patients treated with PI in combination with nucleoside analogue (37Carr A. Miller J. Law M. Cooper D.A. AIDS. 2000; 14: F25-F32Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar), we have used ritonavir-treated mice to determine whether this PI alone also induces changes in liver characteristics. We found that livers from ritonavir-treated mice were significantly enlarged in comparison to livers from vehicle-treated control mice (Fig.7). Although the livers from mice fed the Western type diet without ritonavir treatment were also somewhat larger and more pale than normal mouse liver (compare panels 1 and3 in Fig. 7), liver enlargement and discoloration were much more pronounced in livers of mice fed the Western type diet and receiving ritonavir treatment (Fig.7, panel 4). Histologic analysis of the liver verified that the discoloration was due to ritonavir-induced lipid accumulation. Lipid deposition, as detected by Oil Red O staining, was minimal in control mice fed a low fat chow diet (Fig. 8, panel 1). Liver from ritonavir-treated mice displayed significant lipid deposition even in the absence of high fat diet (Fig. 8, panel 2). As expected, high fat feeding alone resulted in the appearance of Oil Red O-stained lipid droplets in the liver (Fig. 8, panel 3). However, massive lipid deposition was observed only in livers of ritonavir-treated mice that were fed a Western type diet (Fig. 8,panel 4). Increased hepatic lipid accumulation upon ritonavir treatment of Western type diet-fed mice was also observed by direct measurement of hepatic cholesterol levels in these animals (Table I). Thus, these results document a synergistic effect between a high fat diet and PI therapy in fat deposition in the liver. More importantly, the data suggest that hepatomegaly and hepatic steatosis are also abnormalities associated with PI therapy, especially in association with a Western type high fat/high cholesterol diet. Additional monitoring of liver functions in patients undergoing PI therapy is warranted.Figure 8Ritonavir induces lipid deposition in liver.

When cells are in need of sterol, the precursor SREBPs are hydrolyzed by a 2-step mechanism involving the membrane-bound serine protease S1P (17Wang X. Sato R. Brown M.S. Hua X. Goldstein J.L.

Chem. 1997; 272: 12778-12785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The N-terminal fragment of SREBP liberated from S1P- and S2P-mediated hydrolysis is translocated to the nucleus where it binds to sterol regulatory elements and activates gene transcription (32Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11041-11048Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar, 42Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L.

Lipidol. 1999; 10: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The nuclear SREBP can be rapidly degraded by an ALLN-sensitive proteasome-mediated mechanism, thus affording exquisite regulation of gene transcriptional activities (17Wang X. Sato R. Brown M.S. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). Transgenic mice over-expressing the constitutively active nuclear forms of the SREBPs revealed that supra-physiological overexpression of SREBP-1 or SREBP-2 are capable of activating genes involved in the cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthesis cascades (16Kim J.B. Spiegelman B.M. Genes and Dev. 1996; 10: 1096-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar, 21Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Hammer R.E. Goldstein J.L. Shimano H. J. Clin.

Invest. 1997; 100: 2115-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). These studies also showed that SREBP-1 is primarily responsible for the induction of fatty acid biosynthesis (31Shimano H. Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 846-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar), whereas SREBP-2 is more involved with cholesterol biosynthesis (21Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Hammer R.E. Goldstein J.L. Shimano H. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2331-2339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Of particular importance to the current study is the observation that activated SREBP-1 transgenic mice displayed the classical features of generalized lipodystrophy, including disordered differentiation of adipose tissue with decreased white fat depots and brown fat resembling immature white fat, marked insulin resistance, and hyperlipidemia (34Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Richardson J.A. Ikemoto S. Bashmakov Y. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Genes and Dev. 1998; 12: 3182-3194Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar), similar to those observed in patients undergoing PI therapy. In the current study, we found that PI therapy induces the accumulation of activated SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 in the nucleus of liver and adipose tissues. As a consequence, fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis are increased in these tissues. Although hepatic LDL receptor expression was also found to be increased in ritonavir-treated mice due to the accumulation of activated SREBP-2 in the liver, the marginal increase in LDL receptor appeared to be unable to overcome the increase in lipid biosynthesis, thus resulting in the hyperlipidemia phenotype. It is possible that lipoprotein remodeling in circulation may also have been impaired after ritonavir treatment, resulting in the insufficient clearance of lipoproteins even in the presence of elevated hepatic LDL receptor. The latter possibility needs to be tested by direct experimentation. Previously, lipodystrophy observed in inhibitor-treated patients was also shown to exhibit insulin resistance (3Carr A. Samaras K. Burton S. Law M. Freund J. Chisholm D.J. Cooper D.A. AIDS. 1998; 12: F51-F58Crossref PubMed Scopus (2188) Google Scholar). Lipodystrophy observed in these patients may arise due to the accumulation of activated SREBP-1 in adipose (34Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Richardson J.A. Ikemoto S. Bashmakov Y. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Genes and Dev. 1998; 12: 3182-3194Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Although insulin resistance and diabetes were not observed in the current study (data not shown), due to the short duration of the current PI treatment period, insulin resistance and diabetes are common characteristics of animals with prolonged accumulation of activated SREBP-1c in brown and white adipose tissues (34Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Richardson J.A. Ikemoto S. Bashmakov Y. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Genes and Dev. 1998; 12: 3182-3194Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 44Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Ikemoto S. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Nature. 1999; 401: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). Thus, it is anticipated that prolonged treatment with ritonavir will also lead to insulin resistance and diabetes. In fact, hepatic steatosis and hepatomegaly were already apparent in mice treated with ritonavir for only 10 days. Fatty liver leading to hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis is a common side effect associated with insulin resistance and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (45Van Steenbergen W. Lanckmans S. Int. J. Obes. Relat. Metab. Disord. 1995; 19: S27-S36PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these data strongly indicate that the major adverse effects of PI therapy, including lipodystrophy, hyperlipidemia, and insulin resistance, are the consequence of activated SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 accumulation in the nucleus of liver and adipose tissues. The mechanism by which PI therapy leads to activated SREBP accumulation in the nucleus is not due to activation of SREBP gene expressionper se. A second possibility is that PI therapy may facilitate the processing of precursor SREBPs to their activated forms. However, this possibility is unlikely because high fat/high cholesterol diet, which inhibits precursor SREBP processing (23Sheng Z. Otani H. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 935-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 32Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11041-11048Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar, 46Korn B.S. Shimomura I. Bashmakov Y. Hammer R.E. Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 2050-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), actually exacerbated the ritonavir effect on SREBP accumulation in the nucleus. Results showing no difference in precursor SREBP levels in membrane fractions of control and ritonavir-treated mice are also inconsistent with this possibility. Therefore, the most likely mechanism for PI-induced activated SREBP accumulation is PI suppression of activated SREBP degradation in the nucleus. As discussed above, this process is mediated by an ALLN-sensitive proteasome-mediated mechanism. PI has already been shown to suppress ALLN-sensitive proteasome activities in antigen presenting T cells (47Andre P. Groettrup M. Klenerman P. de Giuli R. Booth B.L. Cerundolo V. Bonneville M. Jotereau F. Zinkernagel R.M. Lotteau V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13120-13124Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Thus, PI inhibition of proteasome activities may be a generalized phenomenon leading to most of the adverse effects associated with this class of therapeutic agents. The hypothesis that lipid disturbances associated with PI therapy are due to suppression of activated SREBP degradation suggests that inhibition of SREBP biosynthesis or their activities may be a viable option to alleviate the adverse side effects. A recent study demonstrated that SREBP mRNA level can be reduced by polyunsaturated fatty acids (48Xu J. Teran-Garcia M. Park J.H.Y. Nakamura M.T. Clarke S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9800-9807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Inhibition of SREBP activities is also achievable by interfering with their ability to interact with co-regulatory proteins. For example, nuclear factor Y (NF-Y) interacts with SREBP and enhances its binding to promoter sites on lipid metabolism genes (49Dooley K.A. Millinder S. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1349-1356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 50Jackson S.M. Ericsson J. Mantovani R. Edwards P.A. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 767-776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The activity of SREBPs also requires their interaction with the co-activator CREBP binding protein CBP (51Oliner J.D. Andresen J.M. Hansen S.K. Zhou S. Tijan R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2903-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 52Ericsson J. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17865-17870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Thus, designing therapeutic agents that can inhibit SREBP interaction with NF-Y and CBP, or the histone acetyltransferase activities of CBP and its associated factor P/CAF, may be a fruitful alternative strategy to suppress cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthesis. The combination of these agents and PI, along with additional dietary manipulations, should provide an effective regimen to treat HIV infection without the adverse effects associated with the current PI therapy. In summary, this study showed that ritonavir induces lipid abnormalities via stabilization of activated SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 in the nucleus of liver and adipose tissues. Whether other protease inhibitors have similar effects remains to be determined.

https://openalex.org/W2018587522,"Treatment of macrophages with pyridinyl imidazole inhibitors of p38 protein kinases can inhibit lipopolysaccharide-stimulated tumor necrosis factor α secretion. However, bone marrow-derived macrophages from tristetraprolin (TTP)-deficient mice were less sensitive than normal macrophages to this effect of p38 inhibitors, despite evidence for normal p38 activation in response to lipopolysaccharide. TTP is known to cause decreased stability of tumor necrosis factor α and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor mRNAs after binding to an AU-rich element in their 3′-untranslated regions. A recombinant TTP fusion protein could be phosphorylated by a recombinant p38 kinase in cell-free assays and was phosphorylated to the same extent by immunoprecipitated p38 derived from normal and TTP-deficient cells stimulated with lipopolysaccharide; in both cases, the enzyme activity was inhibited by the p38 inhibitors. TTP phosphorylation also was increased in intact macrophages after lipopolysaccharide stimulation, an effect that was blocked by the p38 inhibitors. Finally, TTP in mammalian cell extracts bound less well to an AU-rich element RNA probe than did the same amount of TTP following dephosphorylation. These results suggest that TTP may be a component of the signaling cascade, initiated by inflammatory stimuli and mediated in part by activation of p38, that ultimately leads to enhanced secretion of tumor necrosis factor α.

Post-transcriptional regulation of TNFα synthesis occurs in part by modulation of its mRNA stability. This in turn is dependent upon a so-called class II AU-rich element (ARE) found in the 3′-untranslated region of TNFα transcripts (1Xu N. Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4611-4621Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). This ARE has been implicated in the regulation of both TNFα mRNA stability and its translation (2Dean J.L. Wait R. Mahtani K.R. Sully G. Clark A.R. Saklatvala J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 721-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar,3Piecyk M. Wax S. Beck A.R. Kedersha N. Gupta M. Maritim B. Chen S. Gueydan C. Kruys V.

Targeted deletion of the TNFα mRNA ARE in mice (ΔARE mice) results in the overproduction of TNFα and the development of a systemic inflammatory syndrome (4Kontoyiannis D. Pasparakis M. Pizarro T.T. Cominelli F. Kollias G. Immunity. 1999; 10: 387-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar). A role for the protein serine/threonine kinase p38 has been suggested in ARE-mediated TNFα mRNA processing by numerous studies (5Brook M. Sully G. Clark A.R. Saklatvala J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 483: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 6Wang S.W. Pawlowski J. Wathen S.T. Kinney S.D. Lichenstein H.S. Manthey C.L. Inflamm.

Ther. 1996; 279: 1453-1461PubMed Google Scholar), and it was found recently that macrophages from the ΔARE mice were relatively insensitive to the p38 inhibitor, SB203580 (4Kontoyiannis D. Pasparakis M. Pizarro T.T. Cominelli F. Kollias G. Immunity. 1999; 10: 387-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar). Conflicting studies suggest that these p38 inhibitors can regulate TNFα synthesis at either the mRNA stability or protein translation level (8Prichett W. Hand A. Sheilds J. Dunnington D. J. Inflamm. 1995; 45: 97-105PubMed Google Scholar, 9Young P. McDonnell P. Dunnington D. Hand A. Laydon J. Lee J. Agents Actions. 1993; 39: C67-C69Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 10Lee J.C.

Adams J.L. Young P.R. Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (3147) Google Scholar). Mice lacking the p38 substrate MAPKAPK-2 have been reported to have defective TNFα synthesis following an LPS challenge (11Kotlyarov A. Neininger A. Schubert C. Eckert R. Birchmeier C. Volk H.D. Gaestel M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 94-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). In this case, the regulation appears not to be due to a decrease in either TNFα mRNA levels or stability but rather to inhibition of translation, suggesting that the effects of the p38 pathway on mRNA stability and translation may be independent and uncoupled. These and other studies have indicated a role for the p38 signaling pathway in the post-transcriptional regulation of TNFα synthesis through a mechanism involving the ARE. p38 belongs to the growing family of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK). Stress signals, such as LPS, heat shock, and ultraviolet light can initiate a signaling cascade resulting in the activation, by dual tyrosine/threonine phosphorylation, of p38. The activation of p38 results in the phosphorylation of intracellular substrates, among them MAPKAPK-2 and the activating transcription factor 2 (12Obata T. Brown G.E. Yaffe M.B. Crit. Care Med. 2000; 28: N67-N77Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 13Waskiewicz A.J. Cooper J.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 798-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). There are five known isoforms of p38 (α, β, β2, γ, and δ) in mammals, which differ in expression patterns, activators, inhibitors, and substrate specificity (14Herlaar E. Brown Z. Mol. Med. Today. 1999; 5: 439-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that the RNA-binding protein tristetraprolin (TTP) promotes TNFα mRNA instability in mouse macrophages through direct interactions with its ARE (15Carballo E. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TTP deficiency in mice results in a severe inflammatory syndrome, characterized by severe polyarticular arthritis, myeloid hyperplasia, autoimmunity, and cachexia (16Taylor G.A. Carballo E. Lee D.M. Lai W.S. Thompson M.J. Patel D.D. Schenkman D.I. Gilkeson G.S. Broxmeyer H.E. Haynes B.F. Blackshear P.J. Immunity. 1996; 4: 445-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). This syndrome is largely the result of increased stability of the mRNAs for TNFα and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and increased secretion of these cytokines (15Carballo E. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Carballo E. Gilkeson G.S. Blackshear P.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 986-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 18Carballo E. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Blood. 2000; 95: 1891-1899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We showed earlier that TTP can be phosphorylated on at least one serine by p42 MAPK (19Taylor G.A. Thompson M.J. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13341-13347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and that there are several other consensus phosphorylation sites for mitogen- or stress-activated proline-directed protein kinases in TTP. These observations, together with the characteristics of the inflammatory syndrome exhibited by the TTP-deficient (TTPKO) mice and the fact that TTP expression is induced by several of the same stimuli that activate p38, suggested the possibility that TTP could be part of the signaling cascade through which p38 kinase regulates the stability of certain cytokine mRNAs. In this paper, we show that bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMϕ) from TTP-deficient mice are less sensitive than normal macrophages to the p38 kinase inhibitors SB203580 and SB220025, which normally inhibit LPS-stimulated TNFα secretion from these cells. We also show that TTP can be phosphorylated by p38 in a cell-free system and that LPS-stimulated phosphorylation of TTP in macrophages can be inhibited by p38 inhibitors. The absence of TTP did not affect the ability of LPS to activate p38, and p38 derived from TTP-deficient cells was normally sensitive to the p38 inhibitors in a cell-free assay. Finally, we demonstrated that phosphorylated TTP expressed in 293 cells bound less avidly to an ARE RNA probe than did dephosphorylated TTP. These data indicate that TTP may play an important role in mediating the downstream effects of p38 activation and thus may represent a novel therapeutic target for anti-inflammatory drug development. Mice deficient in TTP, their genotyping, and maintenance of the colony have been described elsewhere (16Taylor G.A. Carballo E. Lee D.M. Lai W.S. Thompson M.J. Patel D.D. Schenkman D.I. Gilkeson G.S.

Bone marrow-derived macrophages were prepared as described (17Carballo E. Gilkeson G.S. Blackshear P.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 986-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and used after 2 weeks in culture. To measure TNFα secretion, BMMϕ were plated in 96-well plates at a density of 1.2 × 106 cells/ml together with increasing concentrations of the p38 inhibitors SB203580 (7Badger A.M. Bradbeer J.N. Votta B. Lee J.C. Adams J.L. Griswold D.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 279: 1453-1461PubMed Google Scholar) and SB220025 (20Jackson J.R. Bolognese B. Hillegass L. Kassis S. Adams J. Griswold D.E. Winkler J.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 284: 687-692PubMed Google Scholar) and the TNFα-converting enzyme (TACE) inhibitor Marimastat (21Barlaam B. Bird T.G. Lambert-Van Der Brempt C. Campbell D. Foster S.J. Maciewicz R. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 4890-4908Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) (all three compounds were synthesized at AstraZeneca). After a 30-min incubation, LPS (Sigma) was added at 0.1 or 1 μg/ml. Cells were incubated with LPS for 24 h, and supernatants were harvested for the measurement of TNFα accumulation by conventional ELISA techniques (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), as specified by the manufacturer. Duplicate samples were analyzed per data point; each data point represents the average of results from three animals per genotype. For Western blotting, confluent cultures of BMMϕ were stimulated with LPS (1 μg/ml) for the indicated times and processed as described (22Paine E. Palmantier R. Akiyama S.K. Olden K. Roberts J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11284-11290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). l00 μg of protein was separated by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), transferred to nitrocellulose, and sequentially probed with antibodies against phosphorylated p38 (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA) or against total p38 (A-12) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Detection was performed with the SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce). For kinase assays, GST-p38 was purchased from Calbiochem and used in a cell-free kinase assay using 5 μg of the maltose-binding protein-human TTP (MBP-hTTP) or maltose-binding protein-mouse TTP (MBP-mTTP) fusion proteins as substrates. These recombinant proteins were produced in Escherichia coli as amino-terminal fusions of TTP with maltose-binding protein and affinity-purified on amylose resin (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) as described previously (23Maina C.V. Riggs P.D. Grandea A.G. Slatko B.E. Moran L.S. Tagliamonte J.A. McReynolds L.A. Guan C.D. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 365-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). We also expressed and purified the MBP protein as a control. The details of fusion protein expression and purification will be described elsewhere. The conditions for p38 phosphorylation of the purified fusion proteins were as recommended by the manufacturer. Where indicated, SB203580 or SB220025 was used to inhibit p38 kinase activity at 5 μm. Phosphorylated proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography. For kinase assays in which endogenous p38 was used, BMMϕ were stimulated with LPS (1 μg/ml) for 15 min, and the cells were harvested as described (22Paine E. Palmantier R. Akiyama S.K. Olden K. Roberts J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11284-11290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), with the following modifications: sodium deoxycholate and SDS were omitted from the wash buffer, and the kinase reaction was performed at 37 °C for 30 min. MBP-mTTP (2.5 μg) was used as the substrate. Phosphorylated proteins were resolved by 11% SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography. To evaluate TTP phosphorylation in intact cells, confluent 60-mm dishes of BMMϕ were washed with phosphate-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium and incubated for 4 h in the presence of 200 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphoric acid (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The p38 inhibitors SB203580 and SB220025 (5 μm) were then added for 30 min followed by 1 μg/ml LPS for another 30 min. Cells were harvested and lysed as described above, and equal amounts of trichloroacetic acid-precipitable counts were immunoprecipitated using a specific antiserum against TTP (19Taylor G.A. Thompson M.J. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13341-13347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated proteins were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography and quantification using a PhosphorImager Typhoon 8600 and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). For the 293 cell transfection experiments, we used the TTP expression plasmid CMV.hTTP.tag (24Lai W.S. Carballo E. Strum J.R. Kennington E.A. Phillips R.S. Blackshear P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4311-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar) and plasmid CMV.(his)6N.hTTP. By using the original human TTP cDNA as a template, the latter plasmid was generated by adding oligonucleotides encoding the six histidines using the polymerase chain reaction primer-overlapping mutagenesis technique (25Lai W.S. Thompson M.J. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 506-517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) after the first amino acid of hTTP. Correct sequence of the fusion cDNA was confirmed by dRhodamine Terminator Cycle Sequencing (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). HEK 293 cells (referred to as 293 cells) were maintained, and transient transfection of 1.2 × 106 cells per 100-mm plate with plasmid constructs in calcium-phosphate precipitates was performed, as described (26Lai W.S. Carballo E. Thorn J.M. Kennington E.A. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17827-17837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Either 5 μg of vector BS+ DNA or 0.5 μg of TTP expression plasmid DNA plus 4.5 μg of vector BS+ DNA was used in each plate. Cytosolic extracts were prepared 24 h after the removal of the transfection mixture as described (26Lai W.S. Carballo E. Thorn J.M. Kennington E.A. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17827-17837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). To evaluate the effect of TTP dephosphorylation on its binding to RNA, we first performed experiments involving transfected 293 cells and labeling with [32P]orthophosphate. Twenty four h after the removal of the transfection mixture, the culture medium was replaced with 1% (v/v) fetal calf serum in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium without phosphate for 2 h at 37 °C. [32P]Orthophosphate (0.2 mCi per ml) was added, and the cells were incubated for an additional 2 h. To prepare cell extracts, the medium was removed, and the cell monolayers were washed three times in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were then lysed in 0.6 ml per 60-mm culture dish of the lysis buffer described previously (24Lai W.S. Carballo E. Strum J.R. Kennington E.A. Phillips R.S. Blackshear P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4311-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). The extracts were then placed in plastic microcentrifuge tubes and sonicated in an ice water bath in a Heat Systems Ultrasonics, Inc., w-380 Sonicator, setting 8, three times for 10 s each time. The samples were then rotated for 15 min at 4 °C, centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatants removed and frozen at −70 °C until used. Cell extracts prepared from 32P-labeled 293 cells transfected with CMV.(his)6N.hTTP (20 μg of protein) were diluted 1:10 in dephosphorylation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) and 0.1 mm EDTA) and were incubated at 30 °C for 1 h with or without 570 units/ml calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (CIAP, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The CIAP activity was stopped by adding 1 μl of 0.1 m Na2HPO4 (pH 6.5). The reaction mixtures were then rapidly frozen and stored at −20 °C for further analysis. Equal volumes of sample were then loaded onto 12% (w/v) gels and subjected to SDS-PAGE, after which the gels were dried and used for autoradiography. Cell extracts were prepared in a similar fashion from unlabeled 293 cells transfected with CMV.hTTP.tag or CMV.(his)6N.hTTP. The extracts contained 40 μg of cellular protein in 0.2 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 0.1 mm EDTA, and 285 units/ml CIAP. Each extract, from six independent but similar transfections, was divided into two tubes and kept on ice. To one tube, 1 m Na2HPO4 (pH 6.5) was added to a final concentration of 100 mm to inactivate the CIAP. Both tubes were then incubated at 30 °C for 2 h, after which the same volume of 1 m Na2HPO4 was added to the other tube. This method was used so that the two tubes from each experiment would contain identical concentrations of all reactants at the conclusion of the experiment. The only difference was that the phosphatase inhibitor was added before the 30 °C incubation in one tube and after the 30 °C incubation in the other tube. At the conclusion of the incubation, the extracts were rapidly frozen and stored at −20 °C for further analysis. For Western blotting of these extracts, samples containing 5 μg of protein in 0.025 ml of the reaction buffer described above containing CIAP and Na2HPO4 were mixed with 1/5 volume of 5× SDS sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and then loaded onto 12% SDS-PAGE gels. Western blotting was performed by standard techniques. Membranes were incubated in Tris-buffered saline, 0.3% Tween 20 (TBS/T) with a polyclonal antiserum directed at a recombinant human TTP fusion protein with maltose-binding protein. 2H. Cao and P.J. Blackshear, unpublished data. For RNA gel mobility shift assays, the RNA probe was derived from plasmid pGM-CSF-ARE (base pairs 3399–3453 of GenBankTMaccession number X03020), containing the AU-rich element in the mouse GM-CSF 3′-untranslated region, 5′-AUUUAUUUAUAUAUUUAUAUUUUUUAAAUAUUUAUUUAUUUAUUUAUUUAUUUUU-3′. This was constructed by inserting double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotides into the EcoRV-XbaI cloning sites of pSK−. Correct sequence of the plasmid insert was confirmed by dRhodamine Terminator Cycle Sequencing (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). To label the RNA transcript with [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol), plasmid pGM-CSF-ARE linearized with XbaI was used as a template, and the Promega Riboprobe in vitro Transcription Systems protocol was employed. The resulting radioactive products were separated from the free nucleotides through G-50 columns. For the gel shift assays, cytosolic extracts prepared from 293 cells transfected with TTP expression constructs were incubated with CIAP, and the phosphatase inhibitor was added either before or after the 30 °C incubation as described above. Various amounts of protein (0.4–1.2 μg) in 2–6 μl of the reaction mixture described above containing CIAP and Na2HPO4 were added to 25 μl of the lysis buffer described above, without protease inhibitors, containing 2 × 105 cpm of RNA probe, and used in mobility shift assays as described (24Lai W.S.

Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17827-17837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). We first evaluated the effect of two p38 inhibitors, SB203580 and SB220025, on the secretion of TNFα by BMMϕ derived from either WT or TTPKO mice. Both p38 inhibitors decreased LPS-stimulated TNFα synthesis in WT BMMϕ, albeit at higher concentrations than required to inhibit TNFα synthesis by LPS-stimulated human monocyte/macrophages. Differences in sensitivity to various p38 inhibitors among animal species have been reported previously (27van den Blink B. Juffermans N.P. ten Hove T. Schultz M.J. van Deventer S.J. van der Poll T. Peppelenbosch M.P. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 582-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 28Wadsworth S.A. Cavender D.E. Beers S.A. Lalan P. Schafer P.H. Malloy E.A. Wu W. Fahmy B. Olini G.C. Davis J.E. Pellegrino-Gensey J.L. Wachter M.P. Siekierka J.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 291: 680-687PubMed Google Scholar). 3D. Campbell, unpublished data. As shown in Fig. 1 A, SB203580 effectively inhibited the LPS-stimulated secretion of TNFα by BMMϕ derived from WT mice (solid circles). The IC50 for this compound was ∼5 μm, similar to the value obtained in previous studies with mouse splenocytes3 and thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages (4Kontoyiannis D. Pasparakis M. Pizarro T.T. Cominelli F. Kollias G. Immunity. 1999; 10: 387-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar). However, when the same compound was used in parallel experiments in BMMϕ derived from animals deficient in TTP (open circles), there was no inhibition of TNFα production at any concentration of SB203580 used (Fig. 1 A). When SB220025 was used, the compound inhibited the production of TNFα by the WT BMMϕ with an IC50 of ∼2 μm(Fig. 1 B), similar to the concentrations required previously.3 However, in the TTPKO BMMϕ, the effective inhibitory concentration was shifted markedly to the right, with an IC50 of ∼30 μm (Fig. 1 B). Similar results were observed when the cells were stimulated with a lower concentration of LPS, 0.1 μg/ml, and then exposed to the p38 inhibitors (data not shown). The specificity of this resistance of TTPKO-derived BMMϕ to p38 inhibitors was tested by using a completely unrelated inhibitor of TNFα secretion, the TACE inhibitor Marimastat (21Barlaam B. Bird T.G. Lambert-Van Der Brempt C. Campbell D. Foster S.J. Maciewicz R. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 4890-4908Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 1 C, both WT and TTPKO BMMϕ responded similarly to Marimastat, with the IC50 for inhibition of TNFα secretion being 0.6 μm in the WT and 2 μmin the TTPKO cells, respectively. To determine whether LPS could activate p38 to the same extent in the WT and TTPKO BMMϕ, the cells were stimulated with LPS (1 μg/ml), followed by immunoblotting for phosphorylated (activated) and total p38. This resulted in the rapid (within 5 min) phosphorylation of p38, which peaked at 15–30 min, and was still apparent after 60 min (Fig. 2). The pattern of phosphorylation was very similar in WT and TTPKO cells (Fig. 2), suggesting that activation of p38 occurred normally, even in the absence of TTP. To determine whether recombinant TTP could serve as a substrate for p38, we performed cell-free kinase assays using commercially available p38, in the form of a GST-p38 fusion protein, and recombinant mouse and human TTP (as fusion proteins with maltose-binding protein or MBP) as substrates. As shown in Fig. 3, p38 was able to phosphorylate both MBP-mTTP (lane 2) and MBP-hTTP (lane 6) (Mr ∼75,000 for both fusion proteins) in this cell-free system. Both SB203580 (5 μm, lanes 3and 7) and SB220025 (5 μm, lanes 4 and 8) inhibited this phosphorylation. No phosphorylation was observed when the substrate was the same amount (5 μg) of recombinant MBP alone (lane 10) (predicted Mr 41,000). No phosphorylation of either fusion protein or MBP was observed when the p38 kinase was omitted from the reaction (lanes 5,9, and 11), ruling out the possibility of contaminating kinases in the MBP-TTP preparations. The GST-p38 kinase fusion protein itself appeared to be phosphorylated in these reactions and could be seen as a radioactive band of Mr68,000 (Fig. 3, lanes 1, 2, 6, and 10). This phosphorylation was also abolished by the p38 inhibitors. To determine whether activation of the p38 kinase pathway could lead to TTP phosphorylation in intact cells, we labeled BMMϕ derived from both WT and TTPKO mice with [32P]orthophosphate, and we stimulated them with LPS (1 μg/ml for 30 min) in the presence or absence of the p38 inhibitors (5 μm). Under these conditions (30 min stimulation with LPS), TTP protein levels were not altered. 4W. S. Lai and P. J. Blackshear, unpublished data. As shown in Fig. 4, a specific antiserum against TTP immunoprecipitated a protein of approximately Mr43,000, whose phosphorylation was increased approximately 3-fold after LPS stimulation (compare lane 2 with lane 1). Preincubation with either SB203580 (lane 3) or SB220025 (lane 4) decreased the level of TTP phosphorylation by ∼50%. The immunoprecipitated, 32P-labeled protein was completely absent in the TTPKO cells (lanes 5–8), confirming its identity as TTP. BMMϕ derived from both WT and TTPKO mice were stimulated with LPS (1 μg/ml) for 15 min, and p38 was immunoprecipitated with a specific antibody for total p38. This immunoprecipitate was then used in a cell-free protein kinase assay, using recombinant MBP-mTTP as the substrate, in the presence or absence of 5 μm SB220025. As shown in Fig. 5, p38 immunoprecipitated from either LPS-stimulated WT or TTPKO cells could phosphorylate MBP-mTTP to approximately the same extent (lanes 2 and 5), and this phosphorylation could be inhibited by SB220025 (lanes 3 and 6). No phosphorylated proteins were observed in the absence of immunoprecipitated p38 (lane 9) or in the absence of MBP-mTTP (lanes 7 and 8), ruling out the possibility that significant concentrations of nonspecific kinases or substrates were present in the reactions. These results suggested that p38 kinase could be activated by LPS in both the TTPKO and the WT macrophages and that in both cases the kinase was sensitive to the action of p38 inhibitors in the cell-free kinase assay. We next evaluated the effect of “global” TTP dephosphorylation on its binding to a GM-CSF ARE probe. We first developed experimental conditions that would result in extensive dephosphorylation of TTP expressed in transfected 293 cells labeled with 32P. That these conditions would be adequate for dephosphorylating the phosphorylated protein are demonstrated in Fig. 6 A. In this experiment,32P-labeled TTP was the most prominent phosphoprotein in a crude cell extract; almost all of the 32P-labeling could be removed by the incubation at 30 oC with CIAP, and the decrease in 32P label was also accompanied by a shift to a lower apparent molecular weight in the SDS gel (Fig. 6 A). We next performed similar dephosphorylations on non-radioactive 293 cell extracts containing similar amounts of expressed TTP from six independent but similar transfections. Because the CIAP protein migrated close to the Mr of highly phosphorylated TTP in these SDS gels and for other reasons, we took great pains to ensure that the extracts containing phosphorylated and dephosphorylated TTP contained otherwise identical concentrations of reactants after the incubation with CIAP. To do this, we added the phosphatase inhibitor Na2HPO4 (final concentration in the extract, 0.1 mm) to both halves of otherwise identical reaction mixtures containing the cellular extract and CIAP; in one case, the inhibitor was added before the 2-h incubation with CIAP and in the other case after the incubation. In this way, the two halves of the extract contained identical concentrations of all reactants, the only difference being"

Gastric epithelial cells and macrophages are considered the main sources of pro-inflammatory cytokines. We investigated NF-κB activation by Helicobacter pylori in MKN45 gastric epithelial cells and THP-1 monocytic cells. Although, cag pathogenicity island (PAI)-positiveH. pylori (wild type) activated NF-κB in both cells, isogenic mutant of cagE (ΔcagE) activated it only in THP-1 cells. Supernatant from the wild type culture could activate NF-κB in THP-1 cells but not in MKN45 cells. High density cDNA array analysis revealed that mRNA expression of NF-κB-regulated genes such as interleukin (IL)-8, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), and IL-1β was significantly up-regulated by the wild type in both cells, whereas it was up-regulated by ΔcagE only in THP-1 cells. Experiments using CD14-neutralizing antibody and IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) assay showed that both wild type and ΔcagE H. pylori activated NF-κB through CD14 and IRAK in THP-1 cells but not in MKN45 cells. Macrophages from C3H/HeJ mice carrying point mutation in the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) gene showed decreased NF-κB activation and TNFα secretion compared with C3H/HeN mouse macrophage when treated with H. pylori. In conclusion, H. pylori-induced NF-κB activation in epithelial cells is dependent on cag PAI and contact but does not involve CD14 and IRAK, whereas in macrophage/monocytic cells it is independent of cag PAI or contact but involves CD14 and TLR4.

Although these organisms do not appear to invade the gastric epithelium, the infection induces chronic inflammation in the lamina propria. Although the pathogenesis of gastroduodenal diseases caused by this bacterium is not well understood, some immunologic mechanisms are considered to be involved in gastric inflammation.

In most resting cells, NF-κB is bound to the inhibitory IκB proteins (IκBα and IκBβ) and is present in the cytoplasm (14Verma I.M. Stevenson J.K. Schwarz E.M. Van Antwerp D. Miyamoto S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2723-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar). However, NF-κB enters the nucleus in response to certain stimuli, including pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα),1 interleukin-1 (IL-1), and bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (15Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 80: 529-532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar). The activation of NF-κB requires phosphorylation of IκBs, which results in their ubiquitin-dependent degradation. The released NF-κB dimers enter the nucleus and activate the genes (15Thanos D.

Two upstream kinase, IκB kinase α (IKKα) and β (IKKβ), phosphorylate IκBα in response to the pro-inflammatory cytokines. NF-κB-inducing kinase, NIK, is a member of the MEKK (mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase kinase) family and has been shown to activate both IKKα and IKKβ through interaction with the adapter proteins associated with the receptors for TNFα and IL-1 (16DiDonato J.A.

The potential pathogenic bacteria are able to deposit their toxic and pro-inflammatory constituents such as LPS derived from the outer membrane of pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria. Recently, several Toll-like receptors (TLR) have been identified in blood macrophages and monocytes based on homology to the Drosophila protein (22Meng X. Khanuja B.S. Ip Y.T.

Positional cloning of theLpsd locus, which is responsible for LPS hyposensitivity in C3H/HeJ mice, mapped it to thetlr4 gene, which encodes a TLR4 protein with a single point mutation (P712H) (26Poltorak A.

TLR4 has a leucine-rich ectodomain and a cytoplasmic domain with sequence homology to several mammalian proteins such as IL-1 receptor and IL-18 receptor. It associates with CD14 on the cell surface and induces NF-κB activation thorough IL-1 receptor signaling molecules, namely MyD88, IRAK, and TRAF6 (27Zhang F.X. Kirschning C.J. Mancinelli R. Xu X.P.

We have recently shown that H. pylori activates NF-κB through a signaling pathway involving IKKs, NIK, TRAF2, and TRAF6 in gastric cancer cells. However, the products of H. pylori, which lead to the recruitment of the adapter proteins TRAF2/TRAF6, remain to be identified (8Maeda S. Yoshida H. Ogura K. Mitsuno Y. Hirata Y. Yamaji Y. Akanuma M.

The proteins encoded by genes located in cag PAI are suggested to function as secretion machinery (type IV)-exporting molecules possibly involved in H. pylori-host cell interaction. Recently, it has been reported that CagA protein, present in PAI, can be tyrosine-phosphorylated in the gastric epithelial cells (33Odenbreit S. Puls J. Sedlmaier B. Gerland E. Fischer W. Haas R.

Isogenic mutant studies have demonstrated that some of proteins encoded by cag PAI genes are essential for NF-κB activation in the gastric epithelial cells (35Glocker E. Lange C. Covacci A. Bereswill S. Kist M. Pahl H. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 2346-2348Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we have demonstrated thatcag PAI is responsible for various gastric lesions in the gerbil model (36Ogura K. Maeda S. Nakao M. Watanabe T. Tada M. Kyutoku T. Yoshida H. Shiratori Y. Omata M. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1601-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that cag PAI may play an important role in the pathogenesis of gastric diseases related to H. pylori infection. The proinflammatory cytokines are considered to be secreted from both gastric epithelial cells and infiltrating cells such as macrophages and lymphocytes (37Crabtree J.E. Aliment. Pharmacol. Ther. 1996; 10 Suppl. 1: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 38Yamaoka Y. Kita M. Kodama T. Sawai N. Imanishi J.

It is not known whether the mechanism of NF-κB activation elucidated by us in gastric epithelial cells also functions in other cell types. In this study, we analyzed the molecular mechanism of H. pylori-mediated NF-κB activation in both a gastric epithelial cell line, MKN45, and in a monocytic cell line, THP-1. Our results indicate that the mechanism of NF-κB activation is different in the two cells and that H. pylori-mediated NF-κB activation in monocytic/macrophage cells involves TLR4 but is independent ofcag PAI. The H. pylori isolates used in this study are as follows. TN2, a strain positive for CagA and VacA (vacuolating cytotoxin), was generously given by Dr. Nakao (Takeda Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan). Southern blot analysis confirmed the presence of at least 13 cag PAI genes. Infection with this strain induced gastric cancer in Mongolian gerbils (39Watanabe T. Tada M. Nagai H. Sasaki S. Nakao M. Gastroenterology. 1998; 115: 642-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). Isogenic cagE-negative mutants (TN2-ΔcagE), PAI totally deleted mutants (TN2-ΔPAI), vacA-negative mutants (TN2ΔvacA), and HP0638-negative mutants (TN2Δ0638) were prepared by the insertion of a kanamycin- or chloramphenicol-resistant gene into a locus of the TN2 genome as described previously (40Ogura K.

H. pylori strains were cultured on Columbia agar with 5% (v/v) horse blood and Dent antibiotic supplement (Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK) at 37 °C for 3 days under microaerobic conditions (Campy-Pak Systems, Becton Dickinson, BBL, Cockeysville, MD). The isolates were kept at −80 °C in Brucella broth with 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS) containing 16% (v/v) glycerol. In co-culture experiments, H. pylori was co-cultured with cells inBrucella broth containing 7.5% FBS for 24 h, centrifuged, resuspended in cell culture medium containing 10% FBS, and immediately thereafter applied to assays. The range of the bacteria:cancer cell ratio was 50:1 to 75:1 in all of the experiments. Bacterial supernatant was prepared by the culture of H. pylori (107/ml) at 37 °C in cell culture medium with 10% FBS under microaerobic conditions for 24 h. The culture media were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min, and the cell-free supernatants were sterilized by passage through a 0.2-μm-pore size filter (Millipore, Tokyo). Anti-CD14 monoclonal antibody (MEM-18) was purchased from Monosan (Uden, Netherlands), rabbit anti-IRAK polyclonal antibody from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY), polyclonal anti-IκBα, p50, and p65 antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and myelin basic protein and lipopolysaccharide (Escherichia coli serotype 0111:B4) from Sigma. Human gastric cancer cell lines MKN45 and TMK-1 were maintained in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS,l-glutamine, 100 units of penicillin-G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. MKN45 was obtained from the Riken Gene Bank (Tsukuba, Japan). TMK-1 was provided by Dr. E. Tahara (Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan). MKN45 and TMK-1 were established from poorly differentiated gastric adenocarcinoma. Human monocytic cell line THP-1 and mouse macrophage cell line J774A.1 were maintained in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS, l-glutamine, 100 units of penicillin-G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. THP-1 was obtained from Health Science Research Resources Bank (Osaka, Japan). J774A.1 was obtained from the Riken Gene Bank (Tsukuba, Japan). THP-1 was established from a monocytic leukemia. Six-week-old C3H/HeN and C3H/HeJ male mice were obtained from Japan SLC (Hamamatsu, Japan) as specific pathogen-free animals. The mice were sacrificed, and their peritoneal resident macrophages were collected by washing the peritoneal cavity with 5 ml of ice-cold saline. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, the macrophages (1 × 106cells) were seeded onto plastic Petri dishes in Ham's F-12 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS. After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, nonadherent cells were removed by repeated washing. The culture medium was replaced with fresh medium either with or without H. pylori or LPS, and the cells were then incubated at 37 °C for the indicated period. Nuclear extracts were prepared by using a nonionic detergent method as described previously (41Goto T. Kato N. Ono-Nitta S.K. Yoshida H. Otsuka M. Shiratori Y. Omata M. J. Biol.

NF-κB was assayed with a [32P]dATP-labeled oligo probe containing the NF-κB recognition site purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). The DNA binding reactions were performed at room temperature for 30 min in a 10-μl mixture consisting of 4% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 50 mm NaCl, and 0.5 μg of poly(dI-dC). Supershift analysis was performed using antibodies against p65 and p50. DNA-protein complexes were loaded onto a chilled 4% nondenaturing acrylamide gel. Gel electrophoresis was executed in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA at 4 °C. The gel was dried, and autoradiography was performed using a Fujix bio-imaging analyzer FLA3000 (Fuji Photo Film, Tokyo, Japan). Total cellular RNA was extracted using the acid guanidine thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method according to the manufacturer's instruction (Isogen, Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan). Poly(A) mRNA was purified from total RNA using an Oligotex kit (Takara, Tokyo, Japan). Analysis of mRNA expression was performed by radioactively labeled cDNA on high density arrays of membrane-bound cDNA probes. We used the Atlas Cytokine/Receptor cDNA expression array from CLONTECH Laboratories (Palo Alto, CA). The preparation of radioactively labeled cDNA and the subsequent hybridization to cDNA arrays were conducted as recommended by the manufacturer's instructions. Total cellular RNA was extracted using acid guanidine thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method according to the manufacturer's instruction (Isogen, Nippon Gene). Reverse transcription (RT) was used to generate cDNA using the SuperScript II preamplification system (Invitrogen). The mRNA expression of MIP-1α, MIP-1β, TNFα, IL-1β, inhibin A, CD14, TLR2, or TLR4 was determined by RT-PCR using the primers described below. The PCR primers (sense (S) and antisense (AS)) used in this study are as follows: MIP-1α, (S) 5′-CCTTGCTGTCCTCCTCTGCA-3′, (AS) 5′-CACTCAGCTCTAGGTCGCTG-3′; MIP-1β, (S) 5′-TGTCTCTCCTCATGCTAGTA-3′, (AS) 5′-GTACTCCTGGACCCAGGAT-3′; TNFα, (S) 5′-CGGGACGTGGAGCTGGCCGAGGAG-3′, (AS) 5′-CACCAGCTGGTTATCTCTCAGCTC-3′; IL-1β, (S) 5′-AAACAGATGAAGTGCTCCTTCCAGG-3′, (AS) 5′-TGGAGAACACCACTTGTTGCTCCA-3′; inhibin A, (S) 5′-GATGGCAAGGTCAACATCTGCTGTAAG-3′, (AS) 5′-AGGTTGGCAAAGGGGCTATGG-3′; CD14, (S) 5′-GGTGCCGCTGTGTAGGAAAGA-3′, (AS) 5′-GGTCCTCGAGCGTCAGTTCCT-3′; TLR2, (S) 5′-GCCAAAGTCTTGATTGATTGG-3′, (AS) 5′-TTGAAGTTCTCCAGCTCCTG-3′; TLR4, (S) 5′-TGGATACGTTTCCTTATAAG-3′, (AS) 5′-GAAATGGAGGCACCCCTTC-3′. The primers for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were obtained from Maxim Biotech, Inc. (San Francisco). The temperature and time schedule were as follows: incubation for 5 min at 96 °C followed by 35 cycles at 96 °C for 20 s, at 58–62 °C for 1 min, and at 72 °C for 1 min. PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 1.2% agarose/ethidium bromide gels. Human chemokine mRNAs were detected with the multiprobe RNase protection assay system from PharMingen (San Diego, CA). In brief, a mixture of [32P]UTP-labeled antisense riboprobes was generated from chemokine template DNAs including lymphotactin, RANTES, IP-10 (γ interferon-inducible protein 10), MIP-1β, MIP-1α, MCP-1 (macrophage chemoattractant protein-1), IL-8, and I-309. The template DNAs for the human housekeeping genes encoding glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and a human ribosomal protein, L-32, were also included to confirm equal loading of total RNA. Ten μg of total RNA was hybridized with antisense RNA probes overnight at 56 °C, and digested with RNases A and T1. The RNA duplexes were run on 5% polyacrylamide gels and scanned autoradiographically using a FLA3000 image analyzer (Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd., Tokyo). Cells, either unstimulated or stimulated with H. pylori for various periods of time or with LPS, were suspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) buffer containing 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm DTT, 25 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. An equal amount of protein extracts were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred electrophoretically to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, UK). The membrane was probed with antibodies for IκBα or IRAK. An ECL detection assay (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. For the analysis of endogenous IRAK kinase activity, 3 × 106 cells were incubated with H. pylori or LPS for various periods and lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) buffer containing 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm DTT, 25 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-IRAK and 20 μg of protein A-Sepharose. The immunoprecipitates were washed five times in lysis buffer and washed additionally with kinase buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 50 μm DTT, and 10 mmATP. After suspension in 20 μl of kinase buffer, the immunoprecipitates were incubated using 5 μCi of [32P]ATP with 2 μg of myelin basic protein as an exogenous substrate for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated by adding SDS sample buffer. The samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by signal detection using the FLA3000 system (Fuji Photo Film, Tokyo). The IL-8 and TNFα contents in the culture supernatants were measured by ELISA as specified by the manufacturer (BIOSOURCE International). MKN45 cells were routinely maintained in RMPI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS. Confluent monolayers of MKN45 in 24-well plates were co-cultured with H. pylori or treated with LPS for various periods of time. The supernatants were then aspirated and stored at −70 °C until assayed for IL-8 by ELISA. The concentration of IL-8 was determined using a standard curve obtained with recombinant IL-8. The murine macrophages were prepared as described above. Macrophages in 24-well plates were co-cultured with H. pylori or treated with LPS for 16 h. The supernatants were then aspirated and stored at −70 °C until assayed for TNFα by ELISA. Data were expressed as the mean ± S.D. Statistical analysis was performed using Student ttest, two-sided. Differences were considered statistically significant with p < 0.05. We first investigated NF-κB activation by H. pylori in MKN45 gastric epithelial cells and THP-1 monocytic cells. The wild type H. pylori activated NF-κB in both cell lines, but cagE knockout mutant (ΔcagE) activated NF-κB only in THP-1 cells. Furthermore, LPS activated NF-κB only in THP-1 cells and not in MKN45 cells (Fig.1 A). These observations indicate that cag PAI is not essential for NF-κB activation in monocytic cells. We further examined a gastric cancer cell line, TMK-1, and a murine macrophage cell line, J774A.1. As in MKN45 and THP-1 cells, NF-κB activation was seen in co-culture with the wild type but not with ΔcagE in TMK-1 cells, whereas it was seen in co-culture with both wild and ΔcagEin J774A.1 cells (Fig. 1 B). These results suggest that the mechanism of NF-κB activation induced by H. pylori is different between gastric epithelial cells and monocytic cells. We previously reported that H. pylori-mediated NF-κB activation in MKN45 cells required direct interaction between H. pylori and cells. However, the supernatant of H. pyloriactivated NF-κB in THP-1 cells but not in MKN45 cells (Fig.1 C). This result indicates that direct interaction is not essential for NF-κB activation in THP-1 cells. Furthermore, NF-κB activation in THP-1 cells by culture supernatant is not strain-specific (Fig. 1 D). NF-κB is an important transcriptional factor in the production of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. To characterize the mRNA expression profile of cytokines in MKN45 and THP-1 cells co-cultured with H. pylori, we used a cDNA microarray (Atlas Human Cytokine/Receptor Array, CLONTECH). We could reproductively detect mRNA expression for 22% (58 of 268) of the genes in the control samples and for 25% (66 of 268) in the wild type (TN2) H. pylori-infected samples at 3 h after infection in MKN45 cells. In THP-1 cells, mRNA expression was detected for 40% (107 of 268) of the genes in the control samples and for 44% (118 of 268) in the wild type (TN2) H. pylori-infected samples at 3 h after infection. Despite the increased dynamic range in these assays, the majority of genes showed relatively little change in mRNA expression after wild type H. pylori infection, with expression ratios between 0.5 and 2. Genes that were up-regulated more than 2.0-fold by H. pylori are shown in TableI. Most of them are NF-κB-regulated genes such as IL-8, IL-1β, and TNFα. Next, we co-cultured TN2-ΔcagE with MKN45 or THP-1 cells. The profiles of mRNA expression were completely different. No gene was found with an expression ratio above 2.5 in MKN45 cells. On the other hand, a gene expression profile similar to that obtained with the wild type H. pylori was observed in THP-1 cells (Table I). These results indicate that the alteration of gene expression induced by H. pylori is dependent on cag status in MKN45 cells but independent in THP-1 cells, as was the case for NF-κB activation.Table IDifferential gene expression induced by H. pyloriNameAccession no.MKN45 TN2MKN45 ΔcagETHP-1 TN2THP-1 ΔcagEGenes upregulated in both MKN45 and THP-1 Macrophage inflammatory protein 1 β precursor (MIP1-β)J0413021.81.82.44.8 Interleukin-8 precursor (IL-8)Y0078717.61.912.715.2 Macrophage inflammatory protein 1 α precursor (MIP1-α)M2345216.41.45.710.1 Neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor-related 3X7476411.80.910.65 Inhibin β A subunit precursorJ036349.41.47.65.6 Interleukin-17 precursor (IL-17)U3265972.121.918.2 Ephrin A3 precursor (EFNA3)U141875.91.26.56.8 Interleukin-1 β precursor (IL-1-β)K027705.81.44.35.8 Monocyte chemotactic protein 1 precursor (MCP1)M245455.21.92.63.5 Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 precursor (IGFBP3)M31159514.32.9 Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor precursor (G-CSF)X034384.80.96.25.5 Interleukin-6 precursor (IL-6)X046023.40.92.65.8 G-protein-coupled receptor HM74D109233.11.25.15.2 Tumor necrosis factor precursor (TNF-α)X013942.91.89.410.9 Tumor necrosis factor-inducible protein (TSG-6)M311652.8133.6Genes upregulated only in MKN45 NeuromodulinM256674.21.5 Bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4)D307514.20.9 Epithelial discoidin domain receptor 1 precursor (EDDR1)X749793.60.9Genes upregulated only in THP-1 Macrophage inflammatory protein 2 α (MIP2-α)X537992012 Lymphotoxin-α precursor (LT-α)D126147.62.8 Follistatin-related protein precursorU068635.22.5 Stem cell tyrosine kinase 1 (STK1)U026874.21.9 Neurotrophin-3 precursor (NT-3)X536553.32.3 CD40L receptor precursorX605923.22.2 Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) receptor β subunit precursorU058752.84.6 Interleukin-4 receptor α subunit precursor (IL-4R-α)X524252.72.1 Vascular endothelial growth factor precursor (VEGF)M329772.62.9 Interleukin-7 receptor α subunit precursor (IL-7R-α)M296962.32 Open table in a new tab To confirm the findings obtained by cDNA arrays, we assessed the levels of several mRNAs by RT-PCR.

https://openalex.org/W2077927459,"DNA topoisomerase II (TOP2) cleavable complexes represent an unusual type of DNA damage characterized by reversible TOP2-DNA cross-links and DNA double strand breaks. Many antitumor drugs and physiological stresses are known to induce TOP2 cleavable complexes leading to apoptotic cell death and genomic instability. However, the molecular mechanism(s) for repair of TOP2 cleavable complexes remains unclear. In the current studies, we show that TOP2 cleavable complexes induced by the prototypic TOP2 poison VM-26 are proteolytically degraded by the ubiquitin/26 S proteasome pathway. Surprisingly the TOP2β isozyme is preferentially degraded over TOP2α isozyme. In addition, transcription inhibitors such as 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole riboside and camptothecin can substantially block VM-26-induced TOP2β degradation. These results are consistent with a model in which the repair of TOP2β cleavable complexes may involve transcription-dependent proteolysis of TOP2β to reveal the protein-concealed double strand breaks.

However, due to their delicate act on DNA, they are also highly vulnerable to xenobiotics and physiological stresses to produce topoisomerase-mediated DNA damage, mostly in the form of topoisomerase cleavable complexes (2Liu L.F.

So far, five human DNA topoisomerases, topoisomerase I (TOP1),1 TOP2α, TOP2β, TOP3α, and TOP3β, have been identified and characterized, and the first three have been demonstrated to be important molecular targets for antitumor drugs (1Wang J.C.

Both hTOP2 isozymes have been demonstrated to be the cellular targets for many clinically useful anticancer drugs such as VP-16 (etoposide) and doxorubicin (11Liu L.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 351-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (1920) Google Scholar, 12D'Arpa P. Liu L.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 989: 163-177PubMed Google Scholar, 13Errington F. Willmore E. Tilby M.J.

In the presence of these TOP2-directed drugs (TOP2 poisons), TOP2 isozymes are trapped as their covalent reaction intermediates, the reversible TOP2 cleavable complexes in which each TOP2 subunit is covalently linked to the 5′-phosphoryl ends of the four-base staggered double strand breaks (14Sander M. Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8421-8428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Zechiedrich E.L. Christiansen K. Andersen A.H. Westergaard O. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6229-6236Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). While the double strand breaks within the TOP2 cleavable complexes are normally concealed by TOP2, many of the cellular effects of TOP2 cleavable complexes are clearly indicative of DNA damage. For example, TOP2 cleavable complexes induced by TOP2 poisons are known to induce DNA damage responses (e.g. G2 arrest, elevation of sister-chromatid exchanges, NFκB activation, and p53 stabilization) (16Smith P.J.

DNA repair mutant cells (e.g. ataxia telangiectasia, progeroid Werner's syndrome, and Rad52) are also known to be hypersensitive to TOP2 poisons (20Elli R. Chessa L. Antonelli A. Petrinelli P.

However, how TOP2-concealed DNA strand breaks are converted to DNA damage signals is still unknown. Inhibitor studies have suggested that both DNA replication and RNA transcription may be important for processing TOP2 cleavable complexes into DNA damage signals (23D'Arpa P. Adv. Pharmacol. 1994; 29B: 127-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 24D'Arpa P. Beardmore C. Liu L.F. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6919-6924PubMed Google Scholar, 25Bodley A.L. Huang H.C., Yu, C. Liu L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6190-6200Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Repair of topoisomerase cleavable complexes is conceptually challenging because of the bulkiness of the protein and the concealed nature of the breaks. However, recent studies on TOP1 cleavable complexes have suggested that both SUMO and ubiquitin pathways may be involved in repair of TOP1 cleavable complexes (26Mao Y. Sun M. Desai S.D. Liu L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4046-4051Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 27Desai S.D. Liu L.F. Vazquez-Abad D. D'Arpa P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24159-24164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). While the role of SUMO-1 conjugation to TOP1 cleavable complexes is still unclear, the role of ubiquitin conjugation to TOP1 cleavable complexes appears to trigger degradation of TOP1 via the 26 S proteasome pathway (27Desai S.D. Liu L.F. Vazquez-Abad D. D'Arpa P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24159-24164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Proteolytic degradation of TOP1 cleavable complexes removes the protein bulk and presumably reveals the hidden strand breaks so that the normal DNA repair process can occur (27Desai S.D. Liu L.F. Vazquez-Abad D. D'Arpa P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24159-24164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 28Desai S.D. Li T.-K. Rodriguez-Bauman A. Rubin E.H. Liu L.F. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5926-5932PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly transcription inhibitors have been shown to block TOP1 degradation suggesting the involvement of RNA transcription in this particular repair process. 2S. D. Desai, D. Rodriguez-Rodriguez, and L. F. Liu, unpublished results. In the current study, we show that TOP2 cleavable complexes can also trigger ubiquitin conjugation to TOP2 resulting in 26 S proteasome-mediated degradation of TOP2. Surprisingly TOP2β is preferentially degraded over TOP2α. In addition, transcription inhibitors can substantially block TOP2β degradation. These results are consistent with a model in which repair of TOP2β cleavable complexes may involve transcription-dependent proteolysis of TOP2β to reveal protein-concealed double strand breaks. ICRF-193 was purchased from ICN Biomedicals. VM-26 was kindly provided by Bristol Myers Squibb Co. Aphidicolin, cycloheximide, and 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole riboside (DRB) were purchased from Sigma. Z-DEVD-FMK was purchased from Calbiochem. Staphylococcal S7 nuclease was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Antiserum against hTOP1 was obtained from scleroderma patients. Rabbit antiserum against hTOP2α was raised against the C-terminal one-third of hTOP2α (29Hwang J.L. Shyy S.H. Chen A.Y. Juan C.C. Whang-Peng J. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 958-962PubMed Google Scholar). The anti-human TOP2β antibodies was raised by immunization with an immunogen containing GST and seven linear repeats of the peptide fragment of human TOP2β from amino acid residues 1554 to 1565 (TOP2β-(1554–1565)). The construction of the DNA fragment encoding for seven repeats of TOP2β-(1554–1565) and the synthesis of the immunogen GST-TOP2β-(1554–1565) followed the published procedure (30Hsu C.T. Ting C.Y. Ting C.J. Chen T.Y. Lin C.P. Whang-Peng J. Hwang J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3701-3705PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the template-repeat polymerase chain reaction method was applied to the construct DNA fragment encoding multiple copies of TOP2β-(1554–1565). We designed two oligonucleotides, oligo A and oligo B. Oligo A, 5′-AAT GAA GGC GAT TAT AAC CCT GGC AGG AAA ACA TCC, encodes the target antigen (TOP2β-(1554–1565)), and oligo B, 5′-GTT ATA ATC GCC TTC ATT GGA TGT TTT CCT GCC AGG, is partly complementary to oligo A. To incorporate restriction sites for subcloning at both ends of the template-repeat polymerase chain reaction products (BamHI at the 5′-end and EcoRI at the 3′-end) as well as a stop codon at the 3′-end of the coding region, a second round of polymerase chain reaction (adapter polymerase chain reaction) with two adapter primers, primer A (5′-G ATC GGA TCC CCG GGA AAT GAA GGC GAT TAT AAC) and primer B (5′-A GCT TCT AGA ATT CTA GGA TGT TTT CCT GCC AGG) was performed. The DNA fragment encoding the seven repeats of TOP2β-(1554–1565) was subcloned into plasmid pGST-KG at the 3′-end of GST DNA. The resulting plasmid, pGST-TOP2β-(1554–1565), was introduced into XL-10 Gold, and the expressed fusion protein (GST-TOP2β-(1554–1565)) was purified by glutathione-Sepharose 4B affinity chromatography. The mouse mammary carcinoma cell line ts85 (temperature-sensitive for the ubiquitin-activating enzyme, E1) (31Finley D. Ciechanover A. Varshavsky A. Cell. 1984; 37: 43-55Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) was cultured in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 30 °C in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium containing penicillin-streptomycin and 10% fetal bovine serum. FM3A, the parental cell line of ts85, was cultured under identical conditions at 37 °C. Cells were shifted to the restrictive temperature by transferring the culture dishes to a 42 °C incubator for 15 min and then maintaining at 39 °C. HeLa, human breast cancer cell ZR75-1, human lung fibroblast WI-38 and its transformed subline 2RA, and leukemic CEM and U937 cells were cultured under similar conditions at 37 °C. Cells in subconfluency were treated with 100 µm VM-26. At different times, cells were lysed by an alkali solution as described previously (27Desai S.D. Liu L.F. Vazquez-Abad D. D'Arpa P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24159-24164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 µl of alkali lysis buffer (200 mm NaOH, 2 mm EDTA) was added to each 35-mm dish, and cells were scraped by a rubber policeman. The lysate was neutralized by the addition of 8 µl of neutralizing buffer (1m HCl, 600 mm Tris, pH 8.0), and the pH was adjusted to 7–8. The neutralized lysates were mixed with 6.6 µl of a 10× S7 nuclease reaction buffer (50 mm MgCl2, 50 mm CaCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 50 µg/ml leupeptin, 50 µg/ml aprotinin, 50 µg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and 60 units of staphylococcal S7 nuclease. The digestion was performed at room temperature for 15 min. After nuclease digestion, 30 µl of a 3× SDS loading buffer (150 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 45% sucrose, 6 mm EDTA, 9% SDS, 0.03% bromphenol blue) was added to the reaction. The samples were then analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted with anti-hTOP2α and anti-hTOP2β antibodies, respectively. VM-26 represents a prototypic TOP2 poison that traps both TOP2α and TOP2β into cleavable complexes (33Long B.H. Semin. Oncol. 1992; 19: 3-19PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated that VM-26 induces rapid SUMO-1 conjugation to hTOP2 (32Mao Y. Desai S.D. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26066-26073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In the current study, we show that prolonged treatment with VM-26 in HeLa cells resulted in a decrease of the hTOP2β level (Fig. 1A). In the presence of VM-26, the hTOP2β level was reduced more than 50% in 2 h. A further decrease in the hTOP2β level was observed with increasing time of VM-26 treatment (at least up to 6 h) (Fig. 1A). The decrease in the level of hTOP2β was due to the presence of VM-26 since 1% Me2SO (solvent control) had no effect on the level of hTOP2β during the 6-h incubation (data not shown). Surprisingly the level of hTOP2α showed very little change over the entire 6-h period (Fig. 1A). One possible explanation for the preferential decrease of the hTOP2β level could be that hTOP2β was more efficiently trapped into cleavable complexes than hTOP2α by VM-26. To examine this possibility, a band depletion assay (27Desai S.D. Liu L.F. Vazquez-Abad D. D'Arpa P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24159-24164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) was performed to monitor TOP2 cleavable complexes in HeLa cells treated with VM-26 for 1–15 min (the short time treatment was used to avoid the complication of proteolytic degradation of TOP2 over prolonged treatment). As shown in Fig. 1B, both hTOP2α and hTOP2β are trapped by VM-26 into covalent protein·DNA complexes with equal efficiency as evidenced by their disappearance in an SDS gel (band depletion) in the absence of nuclease (S7) treatment. Treatment of the lysates with staphylococcal nuclease S7 resulted in the reappearance of the TOP2 bands due to the release of the TOP2·DNA covalent complexes from DNA into free TOP2. These results suggest that VM-26 induces the formation of both TOP2α and TOP2β cleavable complexes with equal efficiency. However, only TOP2β cleavable complexes are proteolytically degraded over time. To confirm that the VM-26-induced decrease of the TOP2β level is not a unique phenomenon in HeLa cells, we have examined many other cells lines including the human lung fibroblast cell WI-38 and its transformed subline 2RA, leukemic cell lines such as U937 and CEM, and breast cancer cell lines ZR75-1 (see Fig. 2). VM-26 was shown to induce a decrease of the TOP2β level in all these cells. However, the TOP2α levels appeared not to be significantly affected in all these cells.Figure 2VM-26-induced decrease in the TOP2β level in different cell lines.A, U937 and CEM leukemic cells were treated with VM-26 for increasing times. Cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The antibody used in this experiment was anti-hTOP2αβ that recognizes both hTOP2α and hTOP2β. B, human lung fibroblast WI-38 and its SV40-transformed subline 2RA cells were treated with VM-26. Cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-hTOP2α and anti-hTOP2β antibodies, respectively. C, ZR75-1 breast cancer cells were treated with VM-26. Cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-hTOP2α and anti-hTOP2β antibodies, respectively. The VM26 concentration used in these experiments was 100 µm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The decrease of the hTOP2β level induced by VM-26 could be due to an increase in the rate of degradation, a decrease in the rate of synthesis, or a combination of both. To test these possibilities, the degradation assay was performed in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. As shown in Fig. 3(compare lanes 5 and 6) in the presence of VM-26, hTOP2β was more than 80% degraded in 2.5 h. Co-treatment with cycloheximide had no effect on the VM-26-induced decrease of the hTOP2β level (Fig. 3, compare lanes 5 and 6with lanes 7 and 8), suggesting that VM-26-induced down-regulation is not due to a decreased rate of TOP2 protein synthesis. As a control experiment, we showed that neither the hTOP2α nor the hTOP2β level was significantly affected by cycloheximide treatment alone, suggesting that neither isozyme was rapidly turning over in the absence of VM-26. Consequently the VM-26-induced decrease in the level of TOP2β is primarily due to an increased rate of degradation of TOP2β, and this process will henceforth be referred to as TOP2β down-regulation. VM-26 is a potent inducer of apoptotic cell death (34Nakajima T. Morita K. Ohi N. Arai T. Nozaki N. Kikuchi A. Osaka F. Yamao F. Oda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24842-24849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Therefore, VM-26-induced degradation of TOP2β could be due to the activation of caspases. To examine this possibility, we performed the degradation assay in the presence of the caspase inhibitor Z-DEVD-FMK (35Santoro M.F. Annand R.R. Robertson M.M. Peng Y.W. Brady M.J. Mankovich J.A. Hackett M.C. Ghayur T. Walter G. Wong W.W. Giegel D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13119-13128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.4A, treatment of Z-DEVD-FMK had no effect on VM-26-induced hTOP2β down-regulation. On the other hand, treatment of cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 nearly completely blocked the degradation of hTOP2β (Fig. 4B,lanes 5–8). This result suggests that the 26 S proteasome rather than an apoptotic caspase may be involved in the degradation of hTOP2β. To further confirm the involvement of the ubiqutin/26 S proteasome pathway, we tested the degradation of TOP2β induced by VM-26 in a pair of mouse cell lines. The ts85 cells contain a temperature-sensitive E1 enzyme for ubiquitin conjugation. At the nonpermissive temperature, E1 enzyme is inactivated, and ubiquitin conjugation to substrates is inhibited (31Finley D. Ciechanover A. Varshavsky A. Cell. 1984; 37: 43-55Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). We performed the degradation assays in both ts85 cells and their parental cells (FM3A). The degradation of TOP2β was substantially blocked when cells were shifted to the nonpermissive temperature (Fig.5A, compare lanes 1–3 with lanes 4–6). By contrast, at both temperatures, VM-26 induced equally efficient degradation of TOP2β in FM3A cells (Fig. 5B).Figure 5The ubiquitin-activating enzymeE1is involved in VM-26-induced down-regulation of TOP2β.A, the mouse cell line ts85 with temperature-sensitive mutant E1 was treated with 100 µm VM-26 for different times at both the permissive (30 °C) and nonpermissive (39 °C) temperatures. Cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-hTOP2α and anti-hTOP2β antibodies, respectively. B, the parental FM3A cells were treated with VM-26, and cell lysates were immunoblotted with anti-hTOP2β antibodies as described in A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The sensitivity to the 26 S proteasome inhibitor and the formation of ubiquitin-TOP2 conjugates provide support of the notion that VM-26-induced TOP2β down-regulation is mediated by a ubiquitin/26 S proteasome pathway. Previous studies have suggested that both DNA replication and RNA transcription may be involved in the processing of TOP2 cleavable complexes into DNA damage signals (23D'Arpa P. Adv. Pharmacol. 1994; 29B: 127-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). To test whether DNA replication and/or RNA transcription is involved in TOP2β down-regulation, we have examined the effect of various inhibitors on VM-26-induced TOP2β down-regulation. As shown in Fig.6A, inhibition of DNA replication by aphidicolin did not affect VM-26-induced hTOP2β down-regulation. However, inhibition of transcription by DRB substantially affected hTOP2β down-regulation (Fig. 6B, compare lanes 1–3 and lanes 4–6). To confirm this result, we also tested another potent transcription inhibitor camptothecin (CPT) (36Kumar A. Wu R.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 80: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.7A, treatment of the breast cancer ZR75-1 cells with either DRB or CPT efficiently blocked VM-26-induced down-regulation of hTOP2β. To rule out the possibility that the effect is due to a reduced level of the cleavable complexes in the presence of DRB or CPT, the band depletion assay was performed. As shown in Fig. 7B, treatment of ZR75-1 cells with either DRB or CPT had no effect on the amounts of VM-26-induced TOP2β cleavable complexes. Since CPT can induce TOP1-mediated DNA damage, the blockage of hTOP2β degradation by CPT could also be an indirect result of a DNA damage response rather than a direct result of transcription inhibition. To rule out this possibility, we have tested the effect of another DNA damage agent, cisplatin, on TOP2β down-regulation. As shown in Fig. 7C, treatment of ZR75-1 cells with cisplatin had no effect on VM-26-induced down-regulation of hTOP2β.Figure 7The transcription inhibitor CPT abolishes VM-26-induced down-regulation of hTOP2β.A, both DRB and CPT block VM-26-induced hTOP2β down-regulation. The breast cancer ZR75-1 cells were treated with 100 µm VM-26 in the presence of 100 µm DRB (lanes 4–6), 20 µm CPT (lanes 7–9), or 1% Me2SO (solvent control for DRB and CPT) (lanes 1–3) for 0, 2.5, and 5 h. Cells were lysed by the alkaline lysis procedure as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and cell lysates were treated with staphylococcal nuclease S7 to free hTOP2β from covalent hTOP2β·DNA complexes.B, DRB and CPT do not affect VM-26-induced formation of hTOP2β cleavable complexes. Cells were treated with VM-26 in the presence of DRB and CPT exactly the same as described in Aexcept that the treatment step with staphylococcal nuclease S7 was omitted. In the absence of the nuclease, hTOP2β cannot be released from the hTOP2β·DNA covalent complexes. Consequently by comparingA and B, the amounts of hTOP2β covalent complexes can be estimated. C, ZR75-1 cells were treated with 100 µm VM-26 in the presence (lanes 5–8) or absence (lanes 1–4) of 40 µm cisplatin (CDDP) for increasing times from 0 to 6 h. Cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-hTOP2β and anti-hTOP1 antibodies, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) VM-26 is a potent inducer of TOP2 cleavable complex formation on chromosomal DNA. Different from other DNA damages, these TOP2 cleavable complexes are highly reversible. In addition, the DNA strand breaks are protein-linked and protein-concealed (14Sander M. Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8421-8428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Zechiedrich E.L. Christiansen K. Andersen A.H. Westergaard O. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6229-6236Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the DNA-damaging effect of TOP2 cleavable complexes is dependent upon the cellular processing of TOP2 cleavable complexes into DNA damage (12D'Arpa P. Liu L.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 989: 163-177PubMed Google Scholar). DNA replication, RNA transcription, helicase activity, and proteolysis have been speculated to be potentially capable of converting TOP2 cleavable complexes into DNA damage (23D'Arpa P. Adv. Pharmacol. 1994; 29B: 127-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 24D'Arpa P. Beardmore C. Liu L.F. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6919-6924PubMed Google Scholar, 25Bodley A.L. Huang H.C., Yu, C. Liu L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6190-6200Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, the demonstration that any of these cellular processes is actually involved in processing TOP2 cleavable complexes into DNA damagein vivo is still lacking. Our current results suggest that both proteolysis and RNA transcription may be involved in the processing of hTOP2β cleavable complexes into DNA damage. In addition, proteolysis via the ubiquitin/26 S proteasome pathway and transcription appear to be coupled. VM-26-induced down-regulation of TOP2β appears to be quite similar to CPT-induced down-regulation of TOP1. Both processes are dependent on the formation of topoisomerase cleavable complexes and involve ubiquitin/26 S proteasome (27Desai S.D. Liu L.F. Vazquez-Abad D. D'Arpa P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24159-24164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). In addition, both processes appear to be transcription-dependent.2 CPT-induced down-regulation has been suggested to be triggered by collision between TOP1 cleavable complexes and RNA polymerase elongation complexes. Down-regulation of TOP1 presumably reveals the TOP1-concealed single strand breaks so that repair can occur.2 By analogy, we propose that TOP2β cleavable complexes can also collide with RNA polymerase elongation complexes resulting in transcription arrest (see Fig. 8). Proteolysis of TOP2β cleavable complexes by ubiquitin/26 S proteasome results in exposure of the protein-concealed double strand breaks (Fig. 8). The exposed double strand breaks can then be repaired by either homologous recombination or nonhomologous end joining (37van Gent D.C. Hoeijmakers J.H. Kanaar R. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 196-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar, 38Hiom K. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R446-R448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Alternatively unrepaired double strand breaks can trigger apoptotic cell death (39Charcosset J.Y. Soues S. Laval F. Bull. Cancer. 1993; 80: 923-954PubMed Google Scholar). It has been reported that proteasome inhibitors can block VP-16-induced apoptosis (40Tabata M. Tabata R. Grabowski D.R. Bukowski R.M. Ganapathi M.K. Ganapathi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8029-8036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 41Watanabe K. Kubota M. Hamahata K. Liu Y. Usami I. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 823-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The inhibition of VM-26-induced apoptosis by proteasome inhibitors is not due to inhibition of NFκB activation (40Tabata M. Tabata R. Grabowski D.R. Bukowski R.M. Ganapathi M.K. Ganapathi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8029-8036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 41Watanabe K. Kubota M. Hamahata K. Liu Y. Usami I. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 823-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Our current model could explain why the 26 S proteasome inhibitor MG132 inhibits VM-26-induced apoptosis since the inhibitor blocks TOP2 down-regulation and hence the formation of the apoptosis-inducing double strand breaks. However, VM-26-induced apoptosis is likely to be mediated by multiple mechanisms, and degradation of TOP2β cleavable complexes may represent only one of these mechanisms. The preferential degradation of TOP2β over TOP2α in VM-26-treated cells is intriguing. Apparently preferential degradation is not due to more efficient trapping of TOP2β cleavable complexes by VM-26. It appears that TOP2β cleavable complexes must be more efficiently recognized by the ubiqutin/26 S proteasome pathway than are TOP2α cleavable complexes. The preferential recognition by the ubiquitin/26 S proteasome pathway may reflect the functional difference between the two isozymes. These two isoforms are encoded by distinct genes but share about 72% identity in their primary sequences (42Tan K.B. Dorman T.E. Falls K.M. Chung T.D. Mirabelli C.K. Crooke S.T. Mao J. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 231-234PubMed Google Scholar, 43Jenkins J.R. Ayton P. Jones T. Davies S.L. Simmons D.L. Harris A.L. Sheer D. Hickson I.D.

Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8154-8160Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical studies have shown that TOP2α is only present in proliferating tissues including tumors, while TOP2β is present in all tissues including terminally differentiated tissues (45Bauman M.E. Holden J.A. Brown K.A. Harker W.G. Perkins S.L. Mod. Pathol. 1997; 10: 168-175PubMed Google Scholar, 46Tsutsui K. Tsutsui K. Hosoya O. Sano K. Tokunaga A. J. Comp. Neurol. 2001; 431: 228-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The two isoforms are regulated very differently in cells. The TOP2α level peaks in G2/M phase, while the TOP2β level is not significantly changed throughout the cell cycle (47Woessner R.D. Mattern M.R. Mirabelli C.K. Johnson R.K. Drake F.H. Cell Growth Differ. 1991; 2: 209-214PubMed Google Scholar). TOP2α plays important roles in chromosome condensation, segregation, and sister chromatin separation (48Sumner A.T. Chromosome Res. 1996; 4: 5-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 49Grue P. Grasser A. Sehested M. Jensen P.B. Uhse A. Straub T. Ness W. Boege F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33660-33666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The cellular function of TOP2β is much less clear. However, recent studies have hinted at the possibility that TOP2β, like TOP1, is involved in RNA transcription. TOP2β has been shown to be essential during mouse neuronal development (50Yang X. Li W. Prescott E.D. Burden S.J. Wang J.C. Science. 2000; 287: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Studies in rat cerebellum have suggested the involvement of TOP2β in neuronal differentiation by regulating the transcription of neuronal genes (51Tsutsui K. Tsutsui K. Sano K. Kikuchi A. Tokunaga A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5769-5778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). TOP2β has also been located in the transcribed regions of human rDNA repeats (52Govoni M. Neri S. Labella T. Sylvester J.E. Novello F. Pession A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 282-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). One possible explanation for the preferential degradation of TOP2β over TOP2α is that TOP2β is preferentially located within the transcribed region, while TOP2α may be located in other regions. TOP2β cleavable complexes located within the transcribed region may block RNA polymerase elongation complexes leading to transcription arrest (see the model in Fig. 8). The ubiquitin/26 S proteasome pathway may be associated with or recruited to arrested RNA polymerase complexes to effect proteolytic degradation of TOP2β cleavable complexes. TOP2 cleavable complexes have been associated with both antitumor as well as carcinogenic activities of TOP2 poisons. The use of TOP2-directed anticancer drugs such as etoposide (VP-16) and doxorubicin is associated with the high incidence of secondary leukemia, therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (53Felix C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 233-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 54Ratain M.J. Rowley J.D. Ann. Oncol. 1992; 3: 107-111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia associated with the use of TOP2-directed drugs is characterized by translocation of the mixed lineage leukemia gene to its over 30 partner genes (55Rowley J.D. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 495-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). All translocations of the mixed lineage leukemia gene occur within an 8.3-kilobase region termed the breakpoint cluster region (56Broeker P.L. Super H.G. Thirman M.J. Pomykala H. Yonebayashi Y. Tanabe S. Zeleznik-Le N. Rowley J.D. Blood. 1996; 87: 1912-1922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,57Hunger S.P. Tkachuk D.C. Amylon M.D. Link M.P. Carroll A.J. Welborn J.L. Willman C.L. Cleary M.L. Blood. 1993; 81: 3197-3203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated that TOP2 can specifically form TOP2 cleavable complexes within the mixed lineage leukemia breakpoint cluster region, suggesting a direct role of TOP2 in mixed lineage leukemia gene translocations (58Strick R. Strissel P.L. Borgers S. Smith S.L. Rowley J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4790-4795Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Our current demonstration that TOP2β cleavable complexes can be efficiently degraded into translocation-competent double strand breaks within the transcribed regions may suggest the involvement of TOP2β cleavable complexes in chromosomal translocations. It remains to be determined whether TOP2β and TOP2α cleavable complexes may play different roles in their antitumor and carcinogenic activities."

Schiemann W.P. Lodish H.F. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 342: 1350-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (2195) Google Scholar). TGF-β regulates this diverse array of cellular processes through binding three high-affinity cell surface receptors, the TGF-β type I, type II, and type III receptors. The type I and II receptors contain serine/threonine protein kinases in their intracellular domain. TGF-β initiates cellular signaling by either binding to type III receptors, which then presents TGF-β to type II receptors, or binding to type II receptors directly. Once activated by TGF-β, the type II receptor recruits, binds, and transphosphorylates the type I receptor, thereby stimulating its protein kinase activity. The activated type I receptor phosphorylates Smad2 or Smad3 that then bind to Smad4. The resulting Smad complex then translocates into the nucleus where it interacts in a cell-specific manner with numerous transcription factors to regulate the transcription of TGF-β-responsive genes. How this simplistic pathway regulates the diverse array of biology attributed to TGF-β remains to be elucidated. Numerous proteins that interact with the type I or type II receptors and the Smad proteins to modulate TGF-β signaling have been described (2Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3999) Google Scholar). Another method by which diversity may be generated is through the formation of distinct receptor complexes that could then utilize distinct TGF-β pathways. Indeed, Smad-independent signaling and signaling through mitogen-activated protein kinase and other cellular signaling pathways have been reported recently (3Hocevar B.A. Brown T.L. Howe P.H.

Inspection of the TGF-β receptors revealed that the type III receptor contained a Class I PDZ binding motif in the cytoplasmic domain. Indeed, GIPC bound to the type III receptor in vivo and in vitro. In Mv1Lu cells, binding of the type III receptor to GIPC resulted in enhanced expression of the type III receptor at the cell surface. In L6 myoblasts, which normally do not express the type III receptor, GIPC decreased the expression of transiently expressed type III receptor but increased the expression of stably expressed type III receptor. Increased expression of the type III receptor was due to stabilization at the cell surface and was sufficient to enhance cellular responsiveness to TGF-β both in terms of inhibition of proliferation and induction of PAI-based promoter-driven gene expression. The type III receptor lacking the Class I PDZ binding motif did not bind GIPC and was not regulated by the expression of GIPC. Taken together, these results, establish for the first time the existence of a type III receptor-binding protein, that the type III receptor expression is regulated at the protein level, and that this altered expression is sufficient to modulate TGF-β signaling. These results have implications for the role of the type III receptor in TGF-β signaling and the role of GIPC as well as other PDZ domain proteins in regulating cell surface receptors as discussed. Generation of a retroviral cDNA library from NIH3T3 cells was described previously. (16Onishi M. Kinoshita S. Morikawa Y. Shibuya A. Phillips J. Lanier L.L. Gorman D.M. Nolan G.P. Miyajima A.

The supernatant was then utilized to infect 5 million L20 cells (Mv1Lu cells expressing the murine ecotropic receptor). Infected cells were then expanded and seeded at a concentration of 2 × 105 cells/100-mm tissue culture dish. TGF-β1 was added to the culture at 50 pm. The cells were incubated in the presence of TGF-β1 for 3 weeks with medium changes once a week. Cell clones that grew in the presence of TGF-β1 were isolated using cloning rings and expanded for further analysis. Retroviral insertions that conferred resistance to the antiproliferative effects of TGF-β were recovered using a pair of polymerase chain reaction primers spanning the multiple cloning site as described previously.

Appropriate strains of yeast (a strain for bait, α strain for library) were transformed with pGBD-IIIcyto (containing the cytoplasmic domain of the type III receptor) or pGBD-IIIcyto-DEL (containing the cytoplasmic domain of the type III receptor lacking the Class I PDZ binding motif) and pGAD-GIPC (encoding full-length GIPC) respectively. These yeast were then mated overnight in YPAD medium (yeast extract, peptone, adenine, and dextrose) at 30 °C, plated on Trp−Leu− plates, and incubated at 30 °C for 3–5 days to allow diploid cells to form visible colonies. Colonies were then replica-plated on His− or His−Ade− plates to assay for interaction. Cells were lysed with 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer and precleared with glutathione-agarose beads. GST fusion protein of the cytoplasmic domain of the type III receptor (GST-III) or the type III receptor lacking the Class I PDZ binding motif (GST-III-DEL) complexed with glutathione-agarose beads were incubated with FLAG epitope-tagged GIPC, harvested by centrifugation, and washed three times with lysis buffer. Binding proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis with αFLAG antibody. Radioligand binding and cross-linking of [125I]TGF-β1 to Mv1Lu, L6, L6-III, or L6-III-DEL cell lines was performed by incubating subconfluent cells with KRH buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 130 mmNaCl, 5 mm MgSO4, 1 mmCaCl2 and 5 mm KCl) containing 0.5% BSA and then with 100 pm [125I]TGF-β1 for 3 h at 4 °C. [125I]TGF-β1 was cross-linked with 0.5 mg/ml disuccinimidyl suberate for 15 min and quenched with 20 mm glycine. Cells were then washed with KRH buffer and lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer, and the type III receptor was immunoprecipitated with αHA antibody. Immunoprecipitated complexes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging. Protein extracts were obtained from cell lines by lysing equal numbers of cells directly in boiling 2× sample buffer. Samples were resolved on 7.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose at 4 °C. Western blots analysis was performed using the M2-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with ECL detection (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells were plated in 24-well plates at 2 × 104 cells/ml, transfected with GIPC, and then treated with 0–200 pmTGF-β1 or TGF-β2. After 48 h of incubation, cells were treated with 10 µCi of [3H]thymidine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 4 h. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and 5% trichloroacetic acid before harvesting cells with 0.1n NaOH. The amount of [3H]thymidine incorporated was analyzed by liquid scintillation counting. Growth inhibition was calculated as the ratio of radioactivity with TGF-β treatment/radioactivity in the absence of TGF-β treatment. 3 × 104 cells/well were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and plated in a 24-well plate. Cells were transfected with a pE2.1 vector that contains the luciferase gene under the regulation of a promoter based on the TGF-β-inducible promoter, PAI-1 (two tandem repeats of nucleotides −586 to −551 of the PAI-1 promoter), the pSVβ vector encoding β-galactosidase to control for transfection efficiency, and varying amounts of pEXL-GIPC expressing full-length GIPC. After 24 h, the cells were washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium before incubation with TGF-β (100 pm) for an additional 24-h period. After the last incubation, the cells were lysed in luciferase lysis buffer (Promega). The luciferase activity was read after the addition of luciferin (Promega) using an automated luminometer. The luciferase activity was expressed as the -fold induction over no TGF-β treatment after adjusting for β-galactosidase expression. While performing retroviral expression cloning screens to identify members of the downstream signaling pathway for TGF-β, we isolated a clone encoding almost the entire coding region of the PDZ domain-containing protein, GIPC (GAIP interacting protein,C terminus) (Fig.1A). GIPC, also known as TaxIP2, Glut1CIP, SEMCAP-1, Neuropilin1-IP, and synectin, was previously cloned out of yeast two-hybrid screens using RGS-GAIP (9De Vries L. Lou X. Zhao G. Zheng B. Farquhar M.G.

In addition to the centrally located PDZ domain, GIPC contains an ACP (acyl carrier protein) domain at the carboxyl terminus, and several consensus protein kinase C and casein kinase II phosphorylation sites (Fig. 1 A). GIPC has been shown previously to interact specifically with a Class I PDZ binding motif comprising the last three amino acids at the carboxyl terminus of these proteins via its PDZ domain (Fig. 1 B). Although GIPC has been suggested to alter the subcellular localization of these interacting proteins or mediate binding to other proteins, the functional roles of GIPC have not been elucidated. As the portion of GIPC we cloned contained a PDZ domain, we sought to identify whether GIPC could interact via its PDZ domain with a member of the TGF-β family. Upon inspection of the receptors for TGF-β, we identified a Class I PDZ binding motif at the carboxyl terminus of the type III receptor, which was similar to the Class I PDZ motif found in the other interacting proteins for GIPC (Fig. 1 B). This feature was unique to the type III receptor, as neither the type II receptor nor the type I receptor contained a similar motif. To investigate the potential for GIPC and the cytoplasmic domain of the type III receptor to interact, we utilized the yeast two-hybrid mating system of James and colleagues (18James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The entire cytoplasmic domain of the type III receptor was cloned into the pGBD vector (pGBD-IIIcyto) in frame with the Gal4 AD, and full-length GIPC was cloned into the pGAD vector (pGAD-GIPC) in frame with the Gal4 DNA binding domain. Yeast transformed with these vectors were then mated, and the yeast grown in Ade−His− conditions selecting for interacting proteins. Neither the pGBD-IIIcyto or pGAD-GIPC vector allowed growth under these conditions; however, yeast mated and selected to carry both pGBD-IIIcyto and pGAD-GIPC vectors grew, demonstrating that these proteins interact in the yeast two-hybrid system (Fig. 1 B, data not shown). To investigate whether the last three amino acids of the type III receptor were essential for this interaction, a bait was made in which the last three amino acids of the type III receptor were deleted (pGBD-IIIcyto-DEL). Indeed, yeast mated and selected to carry both pGBD-IIIcyto-DEL and pGAD-GIPC vectors did not grow (Fig. 1 B, data not shown), indicating that these proteins did not interact in the yeast two-hybrid system and that the Class I PDZ binding motif of the type III receptor was essential for this interaction, consistent with the results with other GIPC-interacting proteins (Fig. 1 B). To investigate the interaction of the type III receptor and GIPCin vivo via co-immunoprecipitation and co-localization studies, we utilized HA-tagged type III receptors and FLAG epitope-tagged GIPC. Although we could express and detect expression of either the type III receptor or GIPC individually, we could not detect expression of the type III receptor in the presence of GIPC (data not shown). To circumvent this difficulty, we expressed FLAG epitope-tagged GIPC in COS-7 cells and utilized a GST fusion protein of either the cytoplasmic domain of type III receptor (GST-IIIcyto) or the cytoplasmic domain with the Class I PDZ binding motif deleted (the last three amino acids in the cytoplasmic domain, GST-IIIcyto-DEL) to attempt to pull down GIPC. GST-IIIcyto, but not GST alone or GST-IIIcyto-DEL, was able to pull down GIPC in this assay, verifying that GIPC and the type III receptor interact and that this interaction depends on the Class I PDZ binding motif of the type III receptor (Fig.1 C). To verify that this interaction was a direct interaction between GIPC and the cytoplasmic domain of the type III receptor, we expressed 35S-labeled GIPC by in vitro transcription/translation and assayed for its interaction with GST-IIIcyto. Indeed, GST-IIIcyto but not GST alone was able to bind and pull down 35S-labeled GIPC, verifying a direct interaction between GIPC and the type III receptor (data not shown). Taken together, these results determine that the type III receptor and GIPC interact and that this interaction depends on the Class I PDZ binding motif of the type III receptor. Our inability to detect the type III receptor in the presence of GIPC expression suggested that GIPC effects type III receptor expression. To determine whether GIPC was effecting expression of the type III receptor, we examined the cell surface expression of HA-tagged type III receptor in the presence and absence of GIPC expression in the L6 myoblast cell line by binding and cross-linking with125I-TGF-β. The L6 myoblast cell line was utilized as it normally does not express the type III receptor, allowing us to express and analyze effects of the wild-type type III receptor and the mutant type III receptor lacking the Class I PDZ binding motif. Initially we transiently transfected HA-tagged type III receptor in L6 myoblasts with and without co-transfection with GIPC and immunoprecipitated the type III receptor with the αHA antibody as this mimicked the conditions we had utilized in our co-immunoprecipitation and co-localization studies. When GIPC was expressed, there was a significant decrease in the amount of the type III receptor that was expressed at the cell surface, consistent with our inability to detect the type III receptor with GIPC expression in previous experiments (Fig.2C). This was a dose-dependent effect, as increasing the level of expression of GIPC (Fig. 2 B) relative to the expression of the type III receptor was able to progressively decrease the expression of the type III receptor (Fig. 2 C). To confirm that the effect of GIPC was dependent on the interaction of the type III receptor with GIPC, we analyzed the effect of GIPC on expression of the type III receptor, which does not bind GIPC because of deletion of the Class I PDZ binding motif (type III receptor-DEL). Type III receptor-DEL was transiently expressed in the presence of GIPC. The type III receptor-DEL was expressed at the cell surface, and bound TGF-β. However, the expression of the type III receptor-DEL was not effected by the expression of GIPC even when increasing the amount of GIPC expressed (Fig. 2, B and C). These studies determined that expression of GIPC decreases the expression of transiently expressed type III receptor at the cell surface and that this effect is dependent on the binding of GIPC to the type III receptor. Similar results were found in transiently transfected COS-7 cells expressing only the type III receptor and GIPC, determining that significant levels of the type II receptor or the type I receptor were not necessary for the role of GIPC in regulating the type III receptor expression (data not shown). To establish the mechanism by which GIPC abrogates expression of the type III receptor at the cell surface, we examined the effect of GIPC on total cellular expression of the type III receptor in L6 by immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis with αHA antibody. We were able to detect expression of the HA-tagged type III receptor, both as the 180–300-kDa proteoglycan and predominately as the unmodified core, which migrated at 130 kDa (Fig.2 D, data not shown). When HA-tagged type III receptor was expressed in the presence of increasing levels of GIPC, the expression of the type III receptor was markedly decreased (Fig. 2 D). When HA-tagged type III receptor-DEL was analyzed in a similar fashion, GIPC had no effect (Fig. 2 D). These studies determine that GIPC effects total cellular expression of transiently expressed type III receptor, not just cellular surface expression, and thus may be acting during biosynthesis, processing, and trafficking of the type III receptor to the cell surface. Although the effect of GIPC on the type III receptor was specific to the type III receptor able to bind GIPC (as the type III receptor-DEL was not effected) and these results explained our inability to detect the type III receptor in the presence of GIPC in our transient expression assays, we sought to determine whether GIPC regulated endogenous type III receptor expression in a physiological manner. To make this evaluation, we analyzed the expression of the TGF-β receptors in the original Mv1Lu clones (which constitutively express the type III receptor and have been retrovirally infected and selected to stably express GIPC). Although the GIPC-expressing Mv1Lu clones expressed identical levels of the type I and type II receptors compared with the parental Mv1Lu cell line, surprisingly, these cells expressed significantly higher levels of the type III receptor (Fig.3A). Two potential reasons for the discrepant effects of GIPC on type III receptor expression between the Mv1Lu cell line and the L6 myoblast and COS-7 cell lines are: 1) the type III receptor is constitutively expressed in the Mv1Lu cell line and transiently expressed at higher levels in the L6 and COS-7 cell lines (Fig. 2 A, data not shown); and 2) the GIPC is expressed after the type III receptor has been expressed, processed, and transported to the cell surface in the Mv1Lu cell line but before or while those same processes are occurring in the L6 and COS-7 cell lines. To determine whether stable expression of the type III receptor influenced the effect of GIPC, the HA-tagged type III receptor was stably expressed in L6 myoblasts (L6-III). The L6-III cells were then transfected with GIPC and the type III receptor immunoprecipitated by the αHA antibody. As shown in Fig.3 D, GIPC expression in the L6-III cells induced a significant increase in the amount of the type III receptor that was expressed at the cell surface in a dose-dependent manner, consistent with the effect of GIPC on the type III receptor in the Mv1Lu cells. The effect of GIPC was dependent on the interaction of the type III receptor with GIPC, as expression of stably expressed type III receptor-DEL (L6-III-DEL), which does not bind GIPC, was not effected by the expression of GIPC even when increasing the amount of GIPC expressed (Fig. 3 D). We then examined the effect of GIPC on total cellular expression of the stably expressed type III receptor in L6 cells. Again, we were able to detect expression of the HA-tagged type III receptor or HA-tagged type III receptor-DEL, both as the 180–300 kDa proteoglycan and predominately as the unmodified core, which migrated at 130 kDa (Fig. 3 E). When HA-tagged type III receptor was stably expressed in the presence of increasing levels of GIPC, the total cellular expression of the type III receptor was unchanged (Fig. 3 E). When HA-tagged type III receptor-DEL was analyzed in a similar fashion, as expected, GIPC had no effect (Fig. 3 E). To confirm whether the effect of GIPC on the TGF-β pathway was specific to the type III receptor, we analyzed the effect of GIPC expression on the expression of the type I and type II TGF-β receptors in the stable L6 myoblast cell lines as well. As expected, in L6-III and L6-III-DEL cell lines, GIPC had no effect on the expression of the type I and type II TGF-β receptors (Fig. 3, B and C). These results demonstrate that altered expression of the type III receptor by GIPC does not alter the expression of the type II or type I receptor indirectly. To ensure that immunoprecipitation of these stably expressed receptors was not altering the results, we performed similar studies on the L6-III and L6-III-DEL cell lines and directly analyzed total cell lysates. As shown in Fig. 3 C, GIPC had similar dose-dependent effects on the stably expressed type III receptor but not on III-DEL, the type II receptor, or the type I receptor. Finally, to determine the levels of type III receptor expressed in these stable cell lines as well as in our transiently expressed systems, we analyzed receptor expression in equal numbers of L6-III and L6-III-DEL cells, L6 cells transfected with L6-III or L6-III-DEL, and Mv1Lu cells as a control. As shown in Fig.2 A, although transient expression does result in slightly higher expression for both the type III receptor (L6+IIIversus L6-III) and III-DEL (L6+III-DEL versusL6-III-DEL), in all the cases the levels of the expression are within the same range as endogenously expressed type III receptor (Mv1Lu), confirming that the results are obtained with physiologically relevant levels of type III receptor expression. These studies establish that GIPC specifically regulates cell surface expression of the stably expressed type III receptor without altering total cellular expression, suggesting that GIPC regulates the stability of the type III receptor at the cell surface. The ubiquitin/proteosome pathway has been implicated in the targeted degradation of a number of members of the TGF-β family (19Lo R.S. Massague J. Nat.

As GIPC increases cellular surface expression of endogenous or stably expressed type III receptor and interacts directly with the type III receptor at the protein level, we wondered whether GIPC was mediating the access of the type III receptor to the ubiquitin/proteosome pathway. To investigate this possibility, we assayed the effect of GIPC in the presence of the potent reversible inhibitor of the 26-S proteosome, MG-132. In the presence of MG-132, GIPC was still able to enhance expression of stably expressed type III receptor at the cell surface. Indeed, exposure to MG-132 synergized with GIPC to dramatically increase the expression of stably expressed type III receptor at the cell surface (Fig.4A). To further investigate this effect, we assayed the ability of MG-132, and lactacystin, a highly specific irreversible inhibitor of the 20-S proteosome, to alter t"

However, signaling events upstream and downstream of AMPK are unknown. Here we report that 1) p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 3 (MKK3) were activated by AICAR in Clone 9 cells, which express only the GLUT1 transporters, and 2) activation of p38 was required for AICAR-stimulated glucose transport since treatment of the cells with p38 inhibitor SB203580 or overexpression of dominant negative p38 mutant inhibited glucose transport. Moreover, we found that overexpression of the constitutively active form of AMPK mutant also resulted in a significant activation of p38, and inhibition of p38 activity by SB203580 did not affect AICAR-stimulated activation of AMPK. These findings demonstrate that AICAR-stimulated activation of p38 is indeed mediated by AMPK, and the p38 MAPK cascade is downstream of AMPK in the signaling pathway of AICAR-stimulated glucose transport in Clone 9 cells.

The kinases are activated by a relative increase in cellular AMP level, i.e. increase in the AMP to ATP ratio (1Hardie D.G. Carling D. Eur. J.

AMPK activity can also be stimulated by 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside (AICAR), an adenosine analog. After entering into cells, AICAR is phosphorylated at its 5′ position, and the reaction product (identified as ZMP) mimics the stimulatory action of AMP on AMPK (6Corton J.M. Gillespie J.G. Hawley S.A. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 558-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar). Activation of AMPK either by physiological stimulation such as contraction of skeletal muscles or by pharmacological activator AICAR leads to a significant increase of glucose transport mediated by translocation of the GLUT4 transporter molecule from intracellular membranes to the plasma membrane (7Hayashi T.

We have recently found that activation of AMPK by AICAR is also associated with the enhancement of GLUT1-mediated glucose transport in Clone 9 cells (10Abbud W. Habinowski S. Zhang J.-Z. Kendrew J.

However, signaling events upstream and downstream of AMPK in the regulation of glucose transport are unknown. Available evidence distinguishes the AMPK signaling pathway in glucose transport from the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) cascade, a pathway involved in insulin-stimulated glucose transport, on the basis of the wortmannin-insensitive nature of the stimulation of glucose transport by AMPK (7Hayashi T. Hirshman M.F. Kurth E.J. Winder W.W. Goodyear L.J. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1369-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). The p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are activated in response to a variety of extracellular stimuli and have been found to be involved in the inflammatory process, cell growth, cell differentiation, cell cycle, and cell death (11Han J.

Available evidence from muscles and cultured cells indicates that p38 MAPK might also be involved in the regulation of glucose transport. Muscle contraction, which has been demonstrated to increase GLUT4-mediated glucose transport, activates p38 MAPK (15Ryder J.W. Fahlman R. Wallberg-Henriksson H. Alessi D.R. Krook A. Zierath J.R. J.

Overexpression of constitutively active forms of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 3 (MKK3) and MKK6, the upstream regulatory kinases of the p38 MAPK pathway, stimulate translocation of GLUT1 and GLUT4 transporters in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (16Yamamoto Y.

Increased glucose transport by ischemic preconditioning is also mediated by p38 MAPK (17Tong H. Chen W. London R.E. Murphy E. Steenbergen C. J. Biol.

Moreover, it has been reported that a pathway involving p38 MAPK leads to an activation of the recruited glucose transporters in the plasma membrane in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and L6 myotubes (18Sweeney G.

A number of conditions like contraction, hypoxia, inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation, and hyperosmolarity, which evoke metabolic stress, are known to increase both glucose transport and AMPK activity in isolated skeletal muscles (19Hayashi T. Hirshman M.F. Fujii N. Habinowski S.A. Witters L.A. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 527-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar).

Therefore, it is a logical question whether AMPK and p38 MAPK share the same or similar signaling pathway in the stimulation of glucose transport. In the present study, we investigated the possible involvement of p38 MAPK in the stimulation of glucose transport by AMPK in Clone 9 cells. Clone 9 is a rat liver-derived nontransformed cell line that expresses only the GLUT1 glucose transporters (21Shetty M. Loeb J.N. Vikstrom K. Ismail-Beigi F. J. Biol.

Cytochalasin B-inhibitable 3-O-methyl-[3H]glucose uptake was carried out as described previously (23Zhang J.-Z. Hayashi H. Ebina Y. Prohaska R. Ismail-Beigi F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 356: 86-92Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, triplicate culture plates were incubated for 60 s in glucose uptake medium consisting of 750 µl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 7.5 µCi of 3-O-methyl-[3H]glucose with a final concentration of 50 µm cytochalasin B (CB) in Me2SO. An equal amount of Me2SO was added to the control set. Uptake of glucose was terminated by removal of the uptake medium followed by five rapid washes each with 5 ml of ice-cold 100 mm MgCl2 containing 0.1 mm phloretin. Cells were collected in 1 ml of distilled H2O, and the radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. CB-inhibitable 3-O-methyl glucose uptake was calculated by the difference between uptake in the absence and presence of CB. Clone 9 cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmEDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm orthovanadate, 20 mm NaF, 0.1 mmeach of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride,Nα-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, and 1% Nonidet P-40), sonicated, and centrifuged (23Zhang J.-Z. Hayashi H. Ebina Y. Prohaska R. Ismail-Beigi F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 356: 86-92Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The resulting supernatant was fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (4–20% gradient gel) and transferred onto nitrocellulose paper. Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk and incubated with primary antibodies. The secondary antibody was peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG or goat anti-mouse IgG. Immunocomplexes were detected using chemiluminescence. Recombinant adenovirus containing a dominant negative form of p38α mutant was constructed as described previously (24Huang S. Jiang Y. Li Z. Nishida E. Mathias P. Lin S. Ulevitch R.J. Nemerow G.R. Han J. Immunity. 1997; 6: 739-749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Clone 9 cells were infected with viruses containing mutant p38 cDNA or empty vector for 24 h in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The titers of viral stocks were ∼5 × 1010 plaque-forming units/ml. p38α cDNA containing a FLAG epitope tag at its N-terminal region in pcDNA3 was prepared as described previously (25Han J. Lee J.-D. Jiang Y. Li Z. Feng L. Ulevitch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2886-2891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). cDNA fragments of the rat AMPKα1 subunit encoding its first 312 amino acids were generated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using the total RNA of Clone 9 cells as template. Sequences of upstream and downstream primers were 5′-ATGGCCGAGAAGCAGAAGCACG and 5′-GTACAGGCAGCTGAGGACCT, respectively (26Crute B.E. Seefeld K. Gamble J. Kemp B.E. Witters L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35347-35354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The resulting polymerase chain reaction product was cloned into the EcoRI site of pCR2.1-TOPO and subcloned into theEcoRI site of pcDNA3.1-Myc/His(+). Point mutation of the phosphorylation site (Thr-172 to Asp-172) within the AMPKα1 subunit was generated by in vitro mutagenesis using mutation primers 5′-GGTGAATTTTTAAGAGATAGCTGTGGCTCGCCC and 5′-GGGCGAGCCACAGCTATCTCTTAAAAATTCACC (27Stein S.C. Woods A. Jones N.A. Davison M.D. Carling D. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). The resulting AMPK cDNA was verified by DNA sequencing. Clone 9 cells were co-transfected with either FLAG-p38 plus AMPK mutant or FLAG-p38 plus empty vector pcDNA3.1-Myc/His(+). To evaluate the transfection efficiency, pcDNA3.1/His/lacZ was co-transfected with the above constructs, and the expression of β-galactosidase detected with the β-Gal Staining Kit. After 48 h, cells were collected in the above lysis buffer and used for the immunoprecipitation, AMPK activity assay, and Western blotting experiments. Cytochalasin B-inhibitable 3-O-methyl-[3H]glucose uptake was carried out as described above. Lysates of the transfected cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation and Western blotting as described previously (23Zhang J.-Z. Hayashi H. Ebina Y. Prohaska R. Ismail-Beigi F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 356: 86-92Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Anti-FLAG-M2 affinity gels were used for the immunoprecipitation of FLAG-p38α peptides, and anti-Myc antibodies were used for the immunoprecipitation of AMPK-Myc peptides. Phosphorylated active FLAG-p38α was detected by Western blotting using anti-phospho-p38 antibodies. The total amount of p38 MAPK was determined by Western blotting using anti-p38 antibodies. Expression of the AMPK mutant was determined by Western blotting using anti-Myc antibodies. The AMPK activity assay was carried out according to methods described previously (28Carling D. Clarke P.R. Zammit V.A. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 29Witters L.A. Kemp B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2864-2867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, Clone 9 cells were collected in the lysis buffer, sonicated, and centrifuged to remove cell debris. Proteins in the supernatant were precipitated with a saturated ammonium sulfate solution. Assays were performed at 30 °C in 20-µl reaction mixtures containing 2 µg of total protein in reaction buffer (40 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 80 mm NaCl, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 200 µm AMP and ATP, and 2 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP) with or without 200 µm SAMS peptide. After the reaction, 15 µl of reaction mixture was spotted onto the phosphocellulose filter paper, and the filter paper washed extensively with phosphoric acid. The radioactivity on the filter paper was measured by scintillation counting, and AMPK activity was expressed as picomoles of32P incorporation into the peptide/minute/microgram of protein. Results are expressed as means ± S.E. Student's unpaired two-tailed t test was used, andp < 0.05 was considered significant (30Snedecor G.W. Cochran W.G. Statistical Methods. Iowa University Press, Ames, IA1976Google Scholar). To study whether p38 MAPK was involved in AICAR-stimulated glucose transport, Clone 9 cells were treated with 1 mm AICAR for 1 h. Activation of p38 MAPK was determined by Western blotting using anti-phospho-p38 MAPK antibodies. These antibodies react specifically with the active dual-phosphorylated form of p38 MAPK. As shown in Fig.1, the treatment resulted in a remarkable activation of p38 MAPK in a dose-dependent manner. Pretreatment of the cells for 10 min with 10 µm SB203580, a specific inhibitor of both α and β isoforms of p38 MAPK, completely abolished activation of p38 MAPK by AICAR. A similar effect was also noticed after pretreatment of the cells with 10 µm 5-iodotubercidin for 10 min (Fig. 1). 5-Iodotubercidin, an inhibitor of adenosine kinase, blocks the formation of ZMP (5′-phosphorylated form of AICAR) from AICAR. ZMP mimics AMP and causes an activation of AMPK in vivo (6Corton J.M. Gillespie J.G. Hawley S.A. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 558-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar, 10Abbud W. Habinowski S. Zhang J.-Z. Kendrew J. Elkairi F.S. Kemp B.E. Witters L.A. Ismail-Beigi F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 380: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). MKK3 is one of the upstream kinases of p38 MAPK (31Enslen H. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1741-1748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). AICAR significantly activated MKK3, and 5-iodotubercidin completely blocked the activation (Fig. 1). However, SB203580 had no significant effect on the MKK3 activity, which is in good agreement with the fact that p38 MAPK is the target molecule of SB203580 (Fig. 1). These findings demonstrate that treatment of Clone 9 cells with AICAR stimulates the p38 MAPK cascade. We have already reported that the activation of AMPK by AICAR is associated with the enhancement of GLUT1-mediated glucose transport in Clone 9 cells (10Abbud W. Habinowski S. Zhang J.-Z. Kendrew J. Elkairi F.S. Kemp B.E. Witters L.A. Ismail-Beigi F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 380: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). To find out whether activation of p38 MAPK by AICAR was related to the observed increase of glucose transport, Clone 9 cells were treated in a manner similar to that in Fig. 1, and CB-inhibitable [3H]3-OMG uptake was measured. As shown in Fig. 2, treatment of the cells with 1 mm AICAR for 1 h led to a 5.4-fold increase in glucose transport. Pretreatment of the cells with 10 µm SB203580 for 10 min completely abolished AICAR-stimulated glucose transport, whereas treatment with 2 µm SB203580 also significantly inhibited glucose transport with a lesser effect than that noticed with 10 µm SB203580. As expected, pretreatment of the cells with 10 µm 5-iodotubercidin for 10 min completely blocked AICAR-stimulated glucose transport as well. However, neither SB203580 nor 5-iodotubercidin alone had a significant effect on glucose transport (Fig. 2). These results indicate that activation of p38 MAPK is required for AICAR-stimulated glucose transport. Data shown in Figs. 1 and 2demonstrated that AICAR-stimulated glucose transport was mediated by the p38 MAPK cascade. To further strengthen the inferences drawn from previous results, Clone 9 cells were infected with adenoviruses carrying the dominant negative p38 MAPK mutant for 24 h. Cells were then treated with 1 mm AICAR for 1 h prior to carrying out glucose uptake measurements. Expression levels of mutant p38 MAPK protein were determined by Western blotting using anti-p38 MAPK antibodies reacting with both inactive and active forms of p38 MAPK. As shown in Fig. 3, overexpression of p38 MAPK mutant caused a significant inhibition (68%) in AICAR-stimulated glucose transport compared with that in control cells infected with the virus containing empty vector. These results strengthen the notion that the p38 MAPK cascade mediates AICAR-stimulated glucose transport in Clone 9 cells. To distinguish the inhibitory effects of SB203580 on the activation of p38 MAPK and AMPK, Clone 9 cells were treated with AICAR alone or in combination with either SB203580 or 5-iodotubercidin. AMPK activities in the cell lysates were assayed using SAMS peptide as substrate. Fig. 4shows that treatment of the cells with 1 mm AICAR for 1 h significantly induced AMPK activity (3.2-fold). 5-Iodotubercidin completely blocked AICAR-stimulated activation of AMPK, whereas SB203580 had no significant effect. These findings suggest that SB203580, a specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK, abolished AICAR-stimulated glucose transport because of its inhibitory action on p38 MAPK but not on AMPK. Although AICAR has been widely used as a pharmacological activator of AMPK, AICAR alone should not be used to identify AMPK target because it has many cellular effects (5Kemp B.E. Mitchelhill K.I. Stapleton D. Michell B.J. Chen Z.-P. Witters L.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 22-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 6Corton J.M. Gillespie J.G. Hawley S.A. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 558-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar). AMPK is a heterotrimer of three subunits, α, β, and γ. The α subunit forms the catalytic domain of the enzyme, and maximum activity of the full-length α subunit requires co-expression of the β and γ subunits (32Dyck J.R.B. Gao G. Widmer J. Stapleton D. Fernandez C.S. Kemp B.E. Witters L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17798-17803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). However, the truncated AMPKα1 subunit with only the first 312 residues retains significant kinase activity without dependence on the β and γ subunits (26Crute B.E. Seefeld K. Gamble J. Kemp B.E. Witters L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35347-35354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been found that point mutation leading to replacement of threonine 172 with aspartic acid within this truncated peptide abolishes its negative regulation (inactivation) by protein phosphatases (27Stein S.C. Woods A. Jones N.A. Davison M.D. Carling D. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 33Hawley S.A. Davison M. Woods A. Davies S.P. Beri R.K. Carling D. Hardie D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27879-27887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). Therefore, to examine whether AICAR-induced activation of p38 MAPK is indeed mediated by AMPK, a constitutively active form of AMPK mutant was generated as described in detail under “Experimental Procedures.” In a preliminary experiment, transfection of Clone 9 cells with a constitutively active form of AMPK mutant only caused a moderate activation of endogenous p38 MAPK (∼2-fold), probably due to poor transfection efficiency in Clone 9 cells. Hence, to further examine the effect of the overexpression of AMPK on p38 MAPK activity, Clone 9 cells were co-transfected either with FLAG-p38α plus the constitutively active form of AMPK mutant or FLAG-p38α plus empty vector pcDNA3.1Myc/His as control. The FLAG-p38 peptide contains a FLAG epitope at its N-terminal region, and the mutant peptide of AMPK contains a Myc epitope at its C-terminal region. 48 h later, FLAG-p38α peptides were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG-M2 affinity gel, and the activation of p38α was determined by Western blotting with anti-phospho-p38 antibodies. As shown in Fig.5, overexpression of the constitutively active form of AMPK mutant resulted in a marked activation of p38α MAPK compared with that in cells transfected with the empty vector. Glucose transport measurement and the AMPK activity assay were carried out as described in Figs. 2 and 4. A 62 ± 10% increase in AMPK activity and a 78 ± 10% increase in CB-inhibitable glucose transport were observed in cells co-transfected with p38α plus AMPK mutant compared with that in cells transfected with p38α plus empty vector. These results strongly suggest that the effect of AICAR on activation of p38 MAPK is indeed mediated by AMPK in Clone 9 cells. Facilitative, sodium-independent glucose transport is mediated by a glycoprotein family of glucose transporters, GLUT1 to GLUT5 (34Ismail-Beigi F. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 135: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 35Mueckler M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 713-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). Among them, GLUT4 is responsible for the insulin-stimulated glucose transport in muscle and fat cells. Insulin increases glucose transport in these cells by translocation of GLUT4 molecules to the plasma membrane from their intracellular pools, and the PI3K cascade has been demonstrated to be involved in this action (36Shepherd P.R. Kahn B.B. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 341: 248-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar, 37Czech M.P. Corvera S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 2593-2596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). In contrast, GLUT1, which is mainly responsible for the basal level of glucose transport, is present in almost all tissues and cultured cells. The signaling pathway for the GLUT1-mediated glucose transport is poorly understood (34Ismail-Beigi F. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 135: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Clone 9, a rat liver-derived nontransformed cell line, expresses only the GLUT1 isoform of glucose transporters and has been extensively used to study GLUT1-mediated glucose transport in this laboratory and others (21Shetty M. Loeb J.N. Vikstrom K. Ismail-Beigi F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17225-17232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Shetty M. Ismail-Beigi N. Loeb J.N. Ismail-Beigi F. Am. J.

Physiol. 2001; 280: C1277-C1283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously reported that stimulation of AMPK by AICAR is associated with the enhancement of GLUT1-mediated glucose transport in Clone 9 cells (10Abbud W. Habinowski S. Zhang J.-Z. Kendrew J. Elkairi F.S. Kemp B.E. Witters L.A. Ismail-Beigi F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 380: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In the present study, we identified that AICAR-stimulated glucose transport was mediated by AMPK. Moreover, we identified that p38 MAPK was a component, downstream of AMPK, in the signaling pathway of AICAR-stimulated glucose transport in Clone 9 cells. A schematic representation of the plausible pathway is presented in Fig.6. AICAR-stimulated activation of glucose transport was also observed in undifferentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes and C2C12 myoblasts, which express only the GLUT1 isoform of transporters in their predifferentiation states (10Abbud W. Habinowski S. Zhang J.-Z. Kendrew J. Elkairi F.S. Kemp B.E. Witters L.A. Ismail-Beigi F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 380: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Whether the AICAR-stimulated glucose transport in these cells and others is also mediated by the p38 MAPK cascade needs to be examined. It has been demonstrated that the activation of AMPK by AICAR or contraction is associated with an increased glucose transport in skeletal and heart muscles (7Hayashi T. Hirshman M.F. Kurth E.J. Winder W.W. Goodyear L.J. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1369-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar, 8Russell III, R.R. Bergeron R. Shulman G.I. Young L.H. Am. J.

Recently, Mu et al. (43Mu J. Brozinick J.T. Valladares O. Bucan M. Birnbaum M.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1085-1094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar) reported that expression of the dominant negative mutant of AMPK in mouse muscle completely abolished AICAR-stimulated glucose transport. This finding showed that AICAR-stimulated glucose transport, at least in skeletal muscle, was indeed mediated by AMPK (43Mu J. Brozinick J.T. Valladares O. Bucan M. Birnbaum M.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1085-1094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). However, signaling events upstream and downstream of AMPK in the up-regulation of glucose transport is unknown. The available evidence distinguishes the AMPK pathway from the PI3K cascade on the basis of the wortmannin-insensitive nature of AICAR-stimulated glucose transport and a partially additive effect of insulin and AICAR on the stimulation of glucose transport (7Hayashi T. Hirshman M.F. Kurth E.J. Winder W.W. Goodyear L.J. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1369-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). It has been hypothesized that there are at least two independent signaling pathways involved in glucose transport in muscle: the PI3K cascade is responsible for the insulin-stimulated glucose transport, whereas AMPK mediates contraction-induced glucose transport. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, a well known model for the study of insulin-stimulated glucose transport, AICAR has been found to inhibit insulin-stimulated glucose transport (44Salt I.P. Connell M.C. Gould G.W. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1649-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). By the overexpression of the dominant negative form of AMPK mutant in transgenic mice Mu et al. (43Mu J. Brozinick J.T. Valladares O. Bucan M. Birnbaum M.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1085-1094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar) found that AMPK was only partially responsible for the contraction-stimulated glucose transport in skeletal muscle, indicating that AMPK-independent pathways also contributed to the response (43Mu J. Brozinick J.T. Valladares O. Bucan M. Birnbaum M.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1085-1094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). Derave et al. (45Derave W. Ai H. Ihlemann J. Witters L.A. Kristiansen S. Richter E.A. Ploug T. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1281-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) reported a contradictory effect of AMPK on glucose transport in different kinds of muscles. They found a significant positive correlation between AMPK activity and glucose transport in contracting fast-twitch muscle but not a significant correlation between them in slow-twitch muscle (45Derave W. Ai H. Ihlemann J. Witters L.A. Kristiansen S. Richter E.A. Ploug T. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1281-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). These results suggest that there are multiple signaling pathways in cells in response to the stimulation. Interaction between AMPK and another signaling pathway(s) in the regulation of glucose transport needs further investigation. The p38 MAPK signaling cascade activated by diverse stimuli is involved in a variety of biological processes (14Ono K. Han J. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar). An increasing body of evidence indicates that the p38 MAPK pathway may also be involved in the regulation of glucose transport. In muscles, contraction known to increase GLUT4-mediated glucose transport activates p38 MAPK (15Ryder J.W. Fahlman R. Wallberg-Henriksson H. Alessi D.R. Krook A. Zierath J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1457-1462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 46Somwar R. Perreault M. Kapur S. Taha C. Sweeney G. Ramlal T. Kim D.Y. Keen J. Cote C.H. Klip A. Marette A. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1794-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Enhanced glucose transport by ischemic preconditioning in heart is also mediated by p38 MAPK in a PI3K-independent manner (17Tong H. Chen W. London R.E. Murphy E. Steenbergen C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11981-11986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Contradictory results have been reported in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Kayaliet al. (47Kayali A.G. Austin D.A. Webster N.J.G. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1783-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) found that although insulin markedly increased glucose transport in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, there was no significant increase in p38 MAPK activity. Fijishimo et al.(48Fujishiro M. Gotoh Y. Katagiri H. Sakoda H. Ogihara T. Anai M. Onishi Y. Ono H. Funaki M. Inukai K. Fukushima Y. Kikuchi M. Oka Y. Asano T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19800-19806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) also found that suppression of p38 MAPK activation by overexpression of a dominant negative p38 MAPK or MKK6 mutant did not affect insulin-induced glucose transport in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. However, Sweeney et al. (18Sweeney G. Somwar R. Ramlal T. Volchuk A. Ueyama A. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10071-10078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) reported that inhibition of p38 MAPK activity prevented insulin-stimulated glucose transport but did not affect translocation of glucose transporters in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes and L6 myotubes. Borros et al. (39Barros L.F. Young M. Saklatvala J. Baldwin S.A. J. Physiol. 1997; 504: 517-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) also reported that treatment of differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes and Clone 9 cells with anisomycin, a potent activator of p38 MAPK, resulted in a significant increase in glucose transport as well as a marked activation of p38 MAPK. It was unclear whether different differentiation states of 3T3-L1 adipocytes contributed to the above contradictory effects. However, it has been known that 3T3-L1 preadipocytes express only the GLUT1 isoform, whereas differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes express both the GLUT1 and GLUT4 isoforms. It is also known that p38 MAPK activity is modulated during differentiation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and drops dramatically during the later stages of differentiation (47Kayali A.G. Austin D.A. Webster N.J.G. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1783-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 49Engelman J.A. Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. J. Biol.

In the present study, we have demonstrated that in Clone 9 cells, which express only the GLUT1 isoform of glucose transporters, p38 MAPK mediates AICAR-stimulated glucose transport. Unlike the GLUT4 transporter, most of the GLUT1 molecules are present in the plasma membrane under basal conditions, and their activation by a variety of stimuli increases glucose transport (40Shi Y.

We have previously demonstrated that the enhancement of GLUT1-mediated glucose transport by AICAR in Clone 9 cells occurs without any significant increase in the number of transporter molecules in the plasma membrane, reflecting an activation of GLUT1 transporters already present in the plasma membrane (10Abbud W. Habinowski S. Zhang J.-Z. Kendrew J. Elkairi F.S. Kemp B.E. Witters L.A. Ismail-Beigi F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 380: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Interestingly available evidence shows that an activation of GLUT4, following its translocation to the plasma membrane, appears to be a necessary step for the stimulatory action of insulin on glucose transport without the involvement of the PI3K cascade. It has been reported that GLUT4 translocation is dissociated with insulin-stimulated glucose transport in transgenic mice overexpressing GLUT1 in skeletal muscle, suggesting that the intrinsic activity of GLUT4 is subject to regulation (50Hansen P.A. Wang W. Marshall B.A. Holloszy J.O. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18173-18179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In addition, it was found that inhibition of p38 MAPK activity did not affect insulin-induced translocation of GLUT4 transporters in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and L6 myotubes; rather it largely reduced the activation of relocated glucose transporters in the plasma membrane (18Sweeney G.

It has been proposed that insulin-stimulated glucose transport is likely to be regulated by at least two independent signaling pathways,i.e. 1) the PI3K pathway facilitates the translocation of glucose transporters to the plasma membrane, and 2) a wortmannin-insensitive pathway activates translocated glucose transporters (18Sweeney G.

Although GLUT1 and GLUT4 are predominantly present in different tissues or different differentiation states, our data and that of others support the notion that these transporters may share the same or similar signaling pathway in activation, and the p38 MAPK cascade appears to be involved in this action.

In this study, we show for the first time that the purified C-terminal domain of yeast Sco1 binds one Cu(I)/monomer. X-ray absorption spectroscopy suggests that the Cu(I) is ligated via three ligands, and we show that two cysteines, present in a conserved motif C XXXC, and a conserved histidine are involved in Cu(I) ligation. The mutation of any one of the conserved residues in Sco1 expressed in yeast abrogates the function of Sco1 resulting in a non-functional cytochrome c oxidase complex.

During aerobic growth, COX catalyzes the transfer of electrons from cytochrome c to oxygen. Electron flow through COX is coupled to proton transfer across the inner mitochondrial membrane. This results in the creation of an electrochemical proton gradient, providing energy for ATP synthesis. COX is a multisubunit complex consisting of 2–4 subunits in bacteria, 12 in yeast, and 13 in mammals (1Poyton R.O. Goehring B. Droste M. Sevarino K.A. Allen L.A. Zhao X.-J.

In eukaryotes, the three largest subunits are encoded by mitochondrial genes (COX1, COX2, and COX3) and form the catalytic core. The remaining subunits are encoded by nuclear genes and must be imported into the mitochondrion. Several of these subunits are small and consist of a single helix situated on the periphery of the enzyme.In addition to the genes encoding the COX subunits, a large number of other nuclear genes are required for the proper assembly and function of this enzyme (4Tzagoloff A. Dieckmann C.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 211-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The products of these genes include factors involved in the processing and translation of the subunit mRNAs, chaperones that assist in the assembly process, and proteins involved in synthesis or delivery of cofactors. COX contains several cofactors, including 2 copper (Cu) sites (CuA and CuB), 2 heme groups (hemes a and a3), 1 magnesium, and 1 zinc ion. Electrons from reduced cytochrome c first enter the bimetallic CuA site located within the C-terminal globular hydrophilic domain of subunit 2 in the intermembrane space. The electron from the reduced CuAcenter is transferred to heme a and subsequently to the binuclear heme a3-CuB site in Cox1. The CuB site is buried 13 Å below the inner membrane surface (5Nittis T. McCall K. Winge D.R. Winkelmann G. Microbial Transport Systems. Wiley-VCH Verlag, Viernheim, Germany2001: 419-445Crossref Google Scholar). Because both Cox1 and Cox2 are synthesized inside the mitochondria, the three Cu atoms have to be imported from the cytoplasm. So far three proteins (Cox17, Sco1, and Cox11) have been implicated in Cu atom delivery and insertion into COX.Saccharomyces cerevisiae lacking Cox17 have all the phenotypes associated with COX-deficient pet mutants. The cells cannot respire, have no COX enzymatic activity, and lack hemes a and a3 (6Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14504-14509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). These deficiencies are corrected by adding excess Cu(II) to the growth media. Because Sod1, a copper-requiring enzyme in the cytoplasm, is functional, the role of Cox17 is specific to cytochrome c oxidase, and/or mitochondria. Cox17 is a small protein (8 kDa) found in both the cytosol and mitochondrial intermembrane space (7Beers J. Glerum D.M. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol.

Specifically, Sco1 seems to be involved in Cu ion delivery to Cox2 but not Cox1. Mattatall et al.(37Mattatall N.R. Jazairi J. Hill B.C. J. Biol.

Interestingly, Cox2 contains a metal-binding motif (C XE XC) similar to that in Sco1, and this motif provides 3 of the 6 ligands for binuclear CuA site formation. Cu ion insertion into Cox1 may require another protein, the product of COX11. Cox11 appears to be necessary for the formation of the CuB center in the Rhodobacter sphaeroides Cox1 subunit (18Hiser L. Valentin M.D. Hamer A.G. Hosler J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 619-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar).In this study we provide further evidence that Sco1 is involved in the insertion of Cu ions into COX. We purified a soluble truncated form of Sco1 and show that it binds one Cu(I) atom/monomer. X-ray absorption spectroscopy suggests that the Cu(I) ion is coordinated via three ligands.

Cu coordination correlates with in vivo Sco1 function.DISCUSSIONSco1 is believed to participate in the metallation of the CuA site in Cox2 (6Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14504-14509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Sco1 is proposed to accept Cu(I) from Cox17, a candidate metallochaperone that shuttles between the cytoplasm and the mitochondrion, and subsequently insert the Cu ion into Cox2. To fulfill this role, Sco1 must be capable of binding copper. In this study, we show for the first time that purified Sco1 binds one Cu(I) atom/monomer. A truncated soluble form of Sco1 was purified either as an untagged molecule or with one of two different tags fused to its N terminus. All three protein preparations bind Cu(I). The Cu(I) ion appears to be tightly associated and could not be stripped by extensive dialysis of CuSco1 samples in buffer containing DTT. X-ray absorption spectroscopy clearly suggests that the Cu(I) atom is coordinated via three ligands.X-ray absorption spectroscopy, combined with previous functional studies (13Rentzsch A. Krummeck-Weiss G. Hofer A. Bartuschka A. Ostermann K. Rödel G. Curr. Genet. 1999; 35: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), led to the prediction that the conserved cysteines in the C XXXC motif (C148A,C152A) were probably Cu(I) ligand candidates in Sco1. Purified His-tagged Sco1 C148A,C152A bound significantly less Cu(I) than the wild-type protein (Cu:protein ratio of 0.14 versus 1.12), suggesting that these two residues are involved in Cu(I) ligation. The lack of any appreciable change in the far UV circular dichroism ellipticity suggests that the double mutation did not induce major structural changes. Cys-148 and Cys-152 are functionally important residues (review Ref. 13Rentzsch A. Krummeck-Weiss G. Hofer A. Bartuschka A. Ostermann K. Rödel G. Curr. Genet. 1999; 35: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar and Fig. 4 A). This suggests that Cu(I) binding is essential for in vivo Sco1 function.The H239A mutant protein bound reduced levels of Cu (Cu:protein ratio of 0.14), also consistent with His-239 being the third ligand. All Sco1 proteins contain a histidine residue corresponding to yeast His-239. Curve-fitting analysis of the EXAFS of CuSco1 did not conclusively discriminate between a 3-Cu–S and 2-Cu–S, 1 Cu–N coordination. The Cu/K near-edge absorption was slightly shifted to higher energies than that expected for purely thiolate coordination, which is consistent with the presence of one-nitrogen ligand. The combination of the EXAFS data and the reduced Cu content of the H239A mutant Sco1 suggest that the single Cu(I) ion in Sco1 is coordinated by Cys-148, Cys-152, and His-239. Ample precedence exists for trigonal planar Cu(I) coordination with two thiolates and a nitrogen in small inorganic complexes (44Garcia-Vazquez J.A. Romero J. Castro R. Sousa A. Rose D.J. Zubieta J. Inorg. Chim. Acta. 1997; 260: 221-223Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar,45Raamaprabhu S. Lucken E.A.C. Bernardinelli G. Z. Naturforsch. 1994; 49: 193-198Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar).Size-exclusion chromatography on detergent-solubilized mitochondria revealed that Sco1 eluted in fractions higher in molecular weight than that expected for a monomeric protein. Even with cholate with its low aggregation number, the apparent size of Sco1 is consistent with a larger complex. Sco1 may be oligomeric or in association with other mitochondrial proteins. Although detergents may entrap proteins within micelles that normally do not interact, the narrow size distribution of the Sco1-containing fractions is inconsistent with nonspecific entrapment. Non-functional Sco1 (mutants Sco1 C148A,C152A and Sco1 H239A) migrate through the column in a similar manner to wild-type Sco1. Thus, copper binding and assembly into the complex are likely to be independent of each other.We show clearly that Sco1 is not associated with Cox2 in the cytochrome c oxidase complex. Also, Sco1 does not appear in stable association with Cox11, as a deletion of Cox11 did not alter the elution size of Sco1. Likewise, Sco1 is not stably associated with Cox17. Western blotting of the detergent-solubilized elution fractions with anti-Cox17 did not reveal co-chromatography of Cox17 and Sco1.The gel filtration data with detergent-solubilized mitochondria are consistent with full-length Sco1 being oligomeric. When expressing Sco1 from a high copy yeast plasmid, we observed that a fraction of the protein remained in the cytoplasm. Size-exclusion chromatography of cytoplasmic fractions in the presence of Triton revealed that Sco1 was assembled into a complex. Because the purified Sco1 truncate is monomeric, oligomerization most probably involves the N-terminal portion of the protein. We favor a model where full-length Sco1 is an oligomeric protein under normal conditions, although the possibility exists that the in vivo Sco1 complex may contain other proteins.The significance of Sco1 oligomerization in vivo is unclear. Cox17, the candidate Cu(I) donor to Sco1, exists as an oligomer within the mitochondrial intermembrane space (8Heaton D.N. George G.N. Garrison G. Winge D.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 40: 743-751Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Since oligomerization of Cox17 is important for its function (8Heaton D.N. George G.N. Garrison G. Winge D.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 40: 743-751Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar), the possibility exists that Cu(I) ions are donated from the Cox17 tetramer to the Sco1 oligomer. The Cu(I) ions in the Cox17 oligomer are clustered, so the possibility remains that the in vivo Sco1 oligomer may also have Cu(I) sites clustered or in close proximity. The candidate receptor of Sco1-bound Cu(I) is believed to be the binuclear CuA site of Cox2. Two Cu ions may be donated by a Sco1 dimer to form the binuclear CuA center. Sco1 oligomerization may also be significant as its receptor, cytochrome c oxidase, is believed to exist in vivo as a dimer complex with each monomeric unit containing 12–13 subunits (38Musatov A. Ortega-Lopez J. Robinson N.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12996-13004Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 39Schagger H. Pfeiffer K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar). If metallation of the CuA center occurs after assembly of the dimeric COX complex, Sco1 oligomerization may permit metallation of the two CuA centers in the dimer. Further studies are in progress to test these models.

Chem. 1996; 271: 14504-14509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Sco1 is proposed to accept Cu(I) from Cox17, a candidate metallochaperone that shuttles between the cytoplasm and the mitochondrion, and subsequently insert the Cu ion into Cox2. To fulfill this role, Sco1 must be capable of binding copper. In this study, we show for the first time that purified Sco1 binds one Cu(I) atom/monomer. A truncated soluble form of Sco1 was purified either as an untagged molecule or with one of two different tags fused to its N terminus. All three protein preparations bind Cu(I). The Cu(I) ion appears to be tightly associated and could not be stripped by extensive dialysis of CuSco1 samples in buffer containing DTT. X-ray absorption spectroscopy clearly suggests that the Cu(I) atom is coordinated via three ligands.X-ray absorption spectroscopy, combined with previous functional studies (13Rentzsch A. Krummeck-Weiss G. Hofer A. Bartuschka A. Ostermann K. Rödel G. Curr. Genet. 1999; 35: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), led to the prediction that the conserved cysteines in the C XXXC motif (C148A,C152A) were probably Cu(I) ligand candidates in Sco1. Purified His-tagged Sco1 C148A,C152A bound significantly less Cu(I) than the wild-type protein (Cu:protein ratio of 0.14 versus 1.12), suggesting that these two residues are involved in Cu(I) ligation. The lack of any appreciable change in the far UV circular dichroism ellipticity suggests that the double mutation did not induce major structural changes. Cys-148 and Cys-152 are functionally important residues (review Ref. 13Rentzsch A. Krummeck-Weiss G. Hofer A. Bartuschka A. Ostermann K. Rödel G. Curr. Genet. 1999; 35: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar and Fig. 4 A). This suggests that Cu(I) binding is essential for in vivo Sco1 function.The H239A mutant protein bound reduced levels of Cu (Cu:protein ratio of 0.14), also consistent with His-239 being the third ligand. All Sco1 proteins contain a histidine residue corresponding to yeast His-239. Curve-fitting analysis of the EXAFS of CuSco1 did not conclusively discriminate between a 3-Cu–S and 2-Cu–S, 1 Cu–N coordination. The Cu/K near-edge absorption was slightly shifted to higher energies than that expected for purely thiolate coordination, which is consistent with the presence of one-nitrogen ligand. The combination of the EXAFS data and the reduced Cu content of the H239A mutant Sco1 suggest that the single Cu(I) ion in Sco1 is coordinated by Cys-148, Cys-152, and His-239. Ample precedence exists for trigonal planar Cu(I) coordination with two thiolates and a nitrogen in small inorganic complexes (44Garcia-Vazquez J.A. Romero J. Castro R. Sousa A. Rose D.J. Zubieta J. Inorg. Chim. Acta. 1997; 260: 221-223Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar,45Raamaprabhu S. Lucken E.A.C. Bernardinelli G. Z. Naturforsch. 1994; 49: 193-198Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar).Size-exclusion chromatography on detergent-solubilized mitochondria revealed that Sco1 eluted in fractions higher in molecular weight than that expected for a monomeric protein. Even with cholate with its low aggregation number, the apparent size of Sco1 is consistent with a larger complex. Sco1 may be oligomeric or in association with other mitochondrial proteins. Although detergents may entrap proteins within micelles that normally do not interact, the narrow size distribution of the Sco1-containing fractions is inconsistent with nonspecific entrapment. Non-functional Sco1 (mutants Sco1 C148A,C152A and Sco1 H239A) migrate through the column in a similar manner to wild-type Sco1. Thus, copper binding and assembly into the complex are likely to be independent of each other.We show clearly that Sco1 is not associated with Cox2 in the cytochrome c oxidase complex. Also, Sco1 does not appear in stable association with Cox11, as a deletion of Cox11 did not alter the elution size of Sco1. Likewise, Sco1 is not stably associated with Cox17. Western blotting of the detergent-solubilized elution fractions with anti-Cox17 did not reveal co-chromatography of Cox17 and Sco1.The gel filtration data with detergent-solubilized mitochondria are consistent with full-length Sco1 being oligomeric. When expressing Sco1 from a high copy yeast plasmid, we observed that a fraction of the protein remained in the cytoplasm. Size-exclusion chromatography of cytoplasmic fractions in the presence of Triton revealed that Sco1 was assembled into a complex. Because the purified Sco1 truncate is monomeric, oligomerization most probably involves the N-terminal portion of the protein. We favor a model where full-length Sco1 is an oligomeric protein under normal conditions, although the possibility exists that the in vivo Sco1 complex may contain other proteins.The significance of Sco1 oligomerization in vivo is unclear. Cox17, the candidate Cu(I) donor to Sco1, exists as an oligomer within the mitochondrial intermembrane space (8Heaton D.N. George G.N. Garrison G. Winge D.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 40: 743-751Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Since oligomerization of Cox17 is important for its function (8Heaton D.N. George G.N. Garrison G. Winge D.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 40: 743-751Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar), the possibility exists that Cu(I) ions are donated from the Cox17 tetramer to the Sco1 oligomer. The Cu(I) ions in the Cox17 oligomer are clustered, so the possibility remains that the in vivo Sco1 oligomer may also have Cu(I) sites clustered or in close proximity. The candidate receptor of Sco1-bound Cu(I) is believed to be the binuclear CuA site of Cox2. Two Cu ions may be donated by a Sco1 dimer to form the binuclear CuA center. Sco1 oligomerization may also be significant as its receptor, cytochrome c oxidase, is believed to exist in vivo as a dimer complex with each monomeric unit containing 12–13 subunits (38Musatov A. Ortega-Lopez J. Robinson N.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12996-13004Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 39Schagger H. Pfeiffer K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar). If metallation of the CuA center occurs after assembly of the dimeric COX complex, Sco1 oligomerization may permit metallation of the two CuA centers in the dimer. Further studies are in progress to test these models. Sco1 is believed to participate in the metallation of the CuA site in Cox2 (6Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol.

Bcl-2, typically an inhibitor of apoptosis, has also been demonstrated to have pro-apoptotic activity (Cheng, E. H., Kirsch, D. G., Clem, R. J., et al. (1997) Science 278, 1966–1968). The pro-apoptotic activity has been attributed to the cleavage of Bcl-2 by caspase-3, which converts Bcl-2 to a pro-apoptotic molecule. Bcl-2 is a membrane protein that is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, the outer mitochondrial membrane, and the nuclear envelope. Here, we demonstrate that transient expression of Bcl-2 at levels comparable to those found in stably transfected cells induces apoptosis in human embryonic kidney 293 cells and in the human breast cell line MDA-MB-468 cells. Furthermore, we have targeted Bcl-2 specifically to either the ER or the outer mitochondrial membrane to test whether induction of apoptosis by Bcl-2 is dependent upon its localization within either of these membranes. Our findings indicate that Bcl-2 specifically targeted to the mitochondria induces cell death, whereas Bcl-2 that is targeted to the ER does not. The expression of Bcl-2 does result in its cleavage to a 20-kDa protein; however, mutation of the caspase-3 cleavage site (D34A) does not inhibit its ability to induce cell death. Additionally, we find that transiently expressed ER-targeted Bcl-2 inhibits cell death induced by Bax overexpression. In conclusion, the ability of Bcl-2 to promote apoptosis is associated with its localization at the mitochondria. Furthermore, the ability of ER-targeted Bcl-2 to protect against Bax-induced apoptosis suggests that the ER localization of Bcl-2 may play an important role in its protective function.

Originally isolated from the t(14;18) chromosomal breakpoint in human B cell lymphomas, bcl-2 has since been established to be a proto-oncogene that prolongs cell survival by inhibiting apoptosis (1Cleary M.L. Sklar J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7439-7443Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar, 2Bakhshi A. Jensen J.P. Goldman P. Wright J.J. McBride O.W. Epstein A.L. Korsmeyer S.J.

The protection from apoptosis conferred by Bcl-2 upon withdrawal of cytokine was found to be a consequence of its dysregulated overexpression in B cell lymphomas. The promotion of cell survival by Bcl-2 has been recapitulated in many cell line model systems in which Bcl-2 overexpression has been enforced by stable transfection. Although Bcl-2 has been found to inhibit cell death induced by a wide variety of apoptotic signals in many cell types, the mechanism of its protective action still remains unclear. Bcl-2 family members are characterized by containing at least one of four Bcl-2 homology domains (BH1-BH4). Some of these proteins, such as Bax and Bak, function to promote apoptosis, whereas others like Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL inhibit apoptosis (5Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5865) Google Scholar, 6Farrow S.N. White J.H. Martinou I. Raven T. Pun K.T. Grinham C.J. Martinou J.C. Brown R.

Cell. 1993; 74: 597-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2929) Google Scholar). The subcellular localization of these proteins provides important clues as to how these proteins function. Certain pro-apoptotic proteins, such as Bax, and anti-apoptotic proteins, such as Bcl-2, bear a C-terminal transmembrane-targeting domain that allows them to be inserted into the cytosolic face of intracellular membranes (8Nguyen M. Millar D.G. Yong V.W. Korsmeyer S.J. Shore G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25265-25268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Nechushtan A. Smith C.L. Hsu Y.T. Youle R.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2330-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Bcl-2 is found in several intracellular membranes including the endoplasmic reticulum (ER),1 the outer mitochondrial membrane, and the nuclear envelope (10Akao Y. Otsuki Y. Kataoka S. Ito Y. Tsujimoto Y. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2468-2471PubMed Google Scholar, 11Krajewski S. Tanaka S. Takayama S. Schibler M. Fenton W. Reed J. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4701-4714PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, Bax is not located in the ER or perinuclear membrane but remains in the cytoplasm until an apoptotic signal is generated and induces its translocation to mitochondria (12Wolter K. Hsu Y. Smith C. Nechushtan A. Xi X. Youle R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1281-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1577) Google Scholar, 13Gross A. Jockel J. Wei M. Korsmeyer S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3878-3885Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). The oligomerization of Bax in the mitochondrial membrane has been shown to induce cytochrome c release and the subsequent steps in the execution phase of apoptosis (13Gross A. Jockel J. Wei M. Korsmeyer S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3878-3885Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar, 14Antonsson B. Montessuit S. Lauper S. Eskes R. Martinou J.C. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). The pro-apoptotic activity of other proteins, such as Bid and Bak, have been associated with their regulated targeting to the mitochondrial membrane (15Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3790) Google Scholar, 16Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3080) Google Scholar). Thus, mitochondria appear to be a target for mediators of apoptosis and occupy a central role in the apoptotic pathway (17Green D. Reed J. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The structures of both pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic proteins, Bax and Bcl-XL, respectively, have been determined and found to be strikingly similar (18Muchmore S. Sattler M. Liang H. Meadows R. Harlan J. Yoon H. Nettsheim D. Chang B. Thompson C. Nature. 1996; 381: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar, 19Suzuki M. Youle R.J. Tjandra N. Cell. 2000; 103: 645-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). Although pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic proteins share structural similarities and are both found in mitochondrial membranes, it is not understood how they can function in opposing ways to regulate apoptosis. Recent evidence has indicated, however, that Bcl-2 under certain conditions can function as a pro-apoptotic molecule. Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL can be cleaved by caspase-3 and thus be converted to a pro-apoptotic protein similar to Bax (20Cheng E.H. Kirsch D.G. Clem R.J. Ravi R. Kastan M.B. Bedi A. Ueno K. Hardwick J.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1966-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar, 21Clem R.J. Cheng E.H. Karp C.L. Kirsch D.G. Ueno K. Takahashi A. Kastan M.B. Griffin D.E. Earnshaw W.C. Veliuona M.A. Hardwick J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 554-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Conversely, Bax has also been shown to inhibit neuronal cell death when infected with Sinbis virus (22Lewis J. Oyler G.A. Ueno K. Fannjiang Y.R. Chau B.N. Vornov J. Korsmeyer S.J. Zou S. Hardwick J.M. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 832-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that members of the Bcl-2 family have reversible roles in the regulation of apoptosis and have the potential to function in a pro-apoptotic or anti-apoptotic capacity. Here, we demonstrate that acute Bcl-2 expression by transient transfection induces cell death in the human breast carcinoma cell line MDA-MB-468 and human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells. By specifically targeting Bcl-2 either to the ER or the mitochondrial membrane, we find that this induction of apoptosis by Bcl-2 is associated with its localization at the mitochondrial membrane. Transient overexpression of either wild-type or mitochondrially targeted Bcl-2 is sufficient to induce cell death and is not inhibited by the mutation of the caspase-3 cleavage site (D34A). Furthermore, ER-targeted Bcl-2 was found to inhibit cell death induced by Bax overexpression, whereas wild-type and mitochondrially targeted Bcl-2 did not. Thus, ER-targeted Bcl-2 does confer protection against apoptosis by Bax overexpression, suggesting that the ER localization of Bcl-2 may play a significant role in its inhibition of cell death pathways mediated by Bax. HEK 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium buffered with 25 mm HEPES that was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mml-glutamine. African green monkey kidney cells (COS-7) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and human breast epithelial cells MDA-MB-468 were cultured in improved minimum Eagle's medium; both were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin sulfate. Cell lines were maintained at 37 °C with 7% CO2. MDA-MB-468 cells stably expressing Bcl-2 were generated by transfecting pSFFV-Bcl-2 expression vector (provided by Roger Miesfeld, University of Arizona) with FuGENE6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Transfected cells were subjected to selection in 0.8 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). All GFP expression vectors described in this work were constructed with the pEmd-C1 expression vector. This expression vector uses the Emerald GFP variant in which GFP was enhanced for higher quantum efficiency (Packard Instrument Co., Meriden, CT). The ER-targeted GFP-Bcl-2 expression vector (pGFP-Bcl-2Cb5) was constructed by the following cloning strategy. The coding region of Bcl-2 was PCR-amplified from the plasmid pB4, which contains the full-length human bcl-2 cDNA (ATCC, Manasass, VA). All PCR reactions were performed using Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The forward primer used in the PCR amplification contains a BglII restriction site, which ligates in frame with GFP. The resulting PCR fragment was digested with BglII and BbsI, which deletes the C-terminal 658–720 base pairs (corresponding to amino acids 210–239) and generates a BglII overhang at the 5′ end. The nucleotides 297–401 of human cytochrome b5 that encode amino acids 100–134 (ITTIDSSSSWWTNWVIPAISAVAVALMYRLYMAED) were PCR-amplified from an expressed sequence tag obtained from ATCC containing a partial cDNA of human cytochrome b5. This ER-targeting signal sequence (underlined) is identical to that of rat cytochrome b5, with the exception of the hydrophobic membrane anchor domain that has been demonstrated previously not to have a role in determining membrane specificity (23Mitoma J. Ito A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4197-4203Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides used to amplify the ER-targeting signal generated a BbsI restriction site at the 5′ end and an EcoRI site at the 3′ end. These PCR fragments were then ligated in frame in the expression vector pEmd-C1, which was digested with BglII and EcoRI. The FLAG epitope-tagged ER-targeted Bcl-2 was constructed similarly using the expression vector pCMV-Tag2B (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), with the exception that Bcl-2 BgII PCR fragment was ligated into a BamHI site in pCMV-Tag2B. The wild-type GFP-Bcl-2 expression vector was created by PCR amplification of the human Bcl-2-coding region from pB4 with oligonucleotides that generated a BglII at the 5′ end and an EcoRI site at the 3′ end. The PCR fragment was ligated in frame with GFP in the BglII/EcoRI-digested pEmd-C1 and BamHI/EcoRI-digested pCMV-Tag2B expression vectors. To generate the mitochondrially targeted GFP-Bcl-2 expression vector (pGFP-Bcl-2MAOB), Bcl-2 was PCR-amplified, and restriction was digested as described for pEmd-Bcl-2Cb5. Nucleotides 1473–1562 that encode amino acids 492–520 (LLRLIGLTTIFSATALGFLAHKRGLLVRV) of monoamine oxidase B was PCR-amplified from an expressed sequence tag obtained from Genome Systems, Inc., which contains a partial cDNA of human monoamine oxidase B. Oligonucleotides used to amplify this fragment generated BbsI and EcoRI restriction sites that were ligated in frame with Bcl-2 into pEmd-C1 and pCMV-Tag2B. Bcl-2, cytochrome b5, and monoamine oxidase B-targeting sequences were also fused in frame with GFP alone. The C-terminal domain of Bcl-2 used in this expression vector included amino acids 217–239. These constructs were made by PCR amplifying the targeting sequences using oligonucleotides containing a BglII restriction site, which enables in-frame ligation with GFP. To generate the GFP-Bax, the full coding region of Bax was amplified by PCR from pSFFV-Bax, a plasmid containing Bax cDNA, with oligonucleotides, which created a 5′ BglII site and a 3′EcoRI site. The BglII site of the Bax PCR fragment enabled an in-frame ligation with GFP into the pEmd-C1 expression vector digested with BglII and EcoRI. The GFP-Bcl-XL expression vector was generated by PCR amplification of Bcl-XL from pBS-Bcl-XL, which contains the Bcl-XL cDNA, to generate a PCR fragment with 5′ BglII and 3′ EcoRI restriction sites. This fragment was subsequently subcloned into pEmd-C1 as described above. All expression vectors were confirmed by sequence analysis. The D34A mutation was generated in each GFP and FLAG Bcl-2 expression vector using the QuickChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The mutagenic oligonucleotide 5′-CGAGTGGGATGCGGGAG CTGTGGGCGCCGCG-3′ containing a single A–C base change was used to replace aspartate 34 to alanine. The mutation on each plasmid was verified by sequence analysis. For live cell fluorescence imaging of COS-7 cells transiently transfected with GFP-Bcl-2 expression vectors, cells were plated on 35-mm coverslip dishes (MatTek Corp., Ashland, MA) and were used for transient transfection experiments the following day. Cells were transfected with 2 μg of plasmid DNA using FuGENE6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). 16–24 h after transfection, cells were incubated with 100 nm MitoTracker Red (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) for 15 min at 37 °C. Cells were then washed twice with media. For immunofluorescence microscopy of MDA-MB-468 cells stably expressing Bcl-2, cells were grown on 35-mm coverslip dishes and fixed in 95% methanol. Cells were then blocked with 5% goat serum and 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 30 min. Bcl-2 was detected by incubating the cells with a dilution of 1:500 anti-human Bcl-2 monoclonal antibody (6C8) (Pharmingen) for 1 h. Cells were washed three times and then incubated with 1:500 dilution of anti-hamster IgG (Pharmingen) for 1 h. Cells were washed three times with PBS and then incubated for 30 min with 1:500 dilution of anti-mouse Alexa488 (Molecular Probes, Inc.). HEK 293 cells were plated on 35-mm coverslip dishes, and 2 days later, they were transiently transfected with GFP-Bcl-2 constructs. 24 h after transfection, cells were incubated with 0.5 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were subsequently washed with media and observed under a fluorescence microscope. Fluorescence images were taken on a Zeiss Axiovert S100 epifluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). GFP, Bcl-2 immunofluorescence, and accompanying MitoTracker Red images were obtained using a 63Xoil/1.4N.A. objective. Hoechst 33342 DNA-staining images were obtained using a 40Xoil/1.3N.A. objective. All filter sets were obtained from Omega Optical (Brattleboro, VT). GFP fluorescence was detected with an XF23 filter cube (excitation = 485 nm, emission = 535 nm). MitoTracker Red fluorescence was detected with XF67 dichroic/emission filter and 575DF25 excitation filter (excitation = 575 nm, emission = 630 nm). Hoechst 33342 fluorescence was detected with the XF67 dichroic/emission filter and 340 excitation filter (excitation = 340 nm, emission = 470 nm). Bcl-2 immunofluorescence images in MDA-MB-468 cells were taken on a COHU 4910 monochrome CCD camera. All other images were taken on a Hamamatsu ORCA C4742–95-cooled CCD camera operating with Simple PCI software (Compix, Inc., Cranberry Township, PA). Image processing was performed using Adobe Photoshop 5.5. HEK 293 cells were plated onto 60-mm culture dishes and were used for transient transfection the following day. Cells were transfected as described previously for fluorescence microscopy. 24 h after transfection, cells were harvested for analysis by flow cytometry. Typically, transfection efficiencies ranged from 30–50%. Cells were washed twice with PBS and subsequently fixed and permeabilized in 95% methanol. Cells were washed twice with PBS after fixation and resuspended in PBS, 20 μg/ml RnaseA, and 1 mm EDTA for 15 min at 37 °C. Cells were then stained with 50 μg/ml propidium iodide (PI) and 0.05% Nonidet P-40. Cells transfected with GFP-Bcl-2 or FLAG-Bcl-2 expression vectors were analyzed for GFP or AlexaFluor488 and PI fluorescence on a Coulter XL flow cytometer with a 15-milliwatt air-cooled argon laser (excitation = 488 nm). GFP fluorescence was measured using a 525-nm band pass filter, and PI fluorescence was measured using a 620-nm band pass filter. For comparison of Bcl-2 expression levels in transient and stably transfected MDA-MB-468 cells, cell were grown in 100-mm Petri dishes. The parental cells were transiently transfected with 5.6 μg of pGFP-Bcl-2 using FuGENE6 transfection reagent. After 24 h, both transiently transfected and stably transfected cells were harvested and fixed in 95% methanol. Cells were blocked with 5% goat serum and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. Cells were bound with 1:500 dilution of anti-human Bcl-2 antibody (6C8) followed by 1:500 dilution of mouse anti-hamster IgG. After washing three times with PBS, cells were bound with 1:500 dilution of anti-mouse Alexa488 and then stained with 5 μg/ml propidium iodide. In the Bax/Bcl-2 co-transfection experiments, HEK 293 cells were co-transfected with 0.5 μg of pGFP-Bax and 1.5 μg of pFLAG-Bcl-2 expression vectors. After 24 h, cells were fixed and permeabilized in 95% methanol. Cells that were positive for GFP fluorescence were gated for DNA content analysis. Data analysis of results obtained by fluorescence-activated cell sorter was performed using WinMDI 2.7 software program (written by Joseph Trotter, Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). Histograms of untransfected and transfected cells were plotted by gating cells that were positive or negative for GFP and/or AlexaFluor488 fluorescence, respectively. HEK 293 cells were transfected as described previously with either GFP-Bcl-2 or FLAG-Bcl-2 expression vectors and harvested after 24 h. For GFP-Bax/FLAG-Bcl-2 co-transfection experiments, cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of pGFP-Bax and 1.5 μg of pFL-Bcl-2 plasmid DNA. Cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer, and 50 μg of protein of each lysate was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (14% acrylamide). The protein was then electrophoretically blotted to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) and incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of anti-human Bcl-2 monoclonal antibody (6C8) followed by 1:2000 dilution of an anti-hamster horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Pharmingen). Bax was detected by an anti-Bax polyclonal antibody (N-20) (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) diluted 1:1000 followed by an anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Detection of Bcl-2 or Bax on the membrane was performed using ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To study the localization of Bcl-2 in cells that stably overexpress Bcl-2, we transfected a human breast epithelial cell line MDA-MB-468 with a Bcl-2 expression vector and selected for stable expression by growing the cells in G418. These cells do not endogenously express detectable levels of Bcl-2 and previously have been shown to be protected against apoptosis when Bcl-2 is stably transfected (24Wolf C.M. Eastman A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 821-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The subcellular localization of Bcl-2 in these cells was determined by immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1). To visualize mitochondria, cells were loaded with MitoTracker Red, a fluorescent dye that binds specifically to mitochondrial membranes. The pattern of Bcl-2 was found to co-localize with mitochondria as well as with a more extensive reticular network resembling the ER (Fig. 1,A–C). The localization of ER membranes was determined by immunofluorescent detection of ER resident proteins using an anti-KDEL antibody (Fig. 1, D–F). Bcl-2 immunolocalization studies were also performed on control cells transfected with empty vector; however, there was no detectable immunofluorescence signal above background, indicating that there is little, if any, endogenous Bcl-2 in the parental cell line. The pattern of Bcl-2 localization that we observe in the stably transfected MDA-MB-468 cells is thus consistent with previous reports that Bcl-2 is localized to both mitochondrial and ER membranes (10Akao Y. Otsuki Y. Kataoka S. Ito Y. Tsujimoto Y. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2468-2471PubMed Google Scholar, 11Krajewski S. Tanaka S. Takayama S. Schibler M. Fenton W. Reed J. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4701-4714PubMed Google Scholar). It was observed that transfection of Bcl-2 in MDA-MB-468 cells initially resulted in a large number of dead cells relative to those that were transfected with a control vector. This was quantified by transfecting these cells with a GFP-Bcl-2 fusion protein and analyzing GFP fluorescent cells by flow cytometry (Fig.2). After 24 h, cells were harvested, fixed, and stained with PI, a fluorescent dye that binds to DNA. A hallmark of apoptotic cell death is the enzymatic cleavage of chromosomal DNA by endonucleases activated by the caspase cascade. This degradation of chromosomal DNA results in a decrease in total DNA content to a level that is lower than the DNA content of a cell in G1 phase (25Sherwood S.W. Schimke R.T. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 46: 77-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Consequently, the DNA content of apoptotic cells appears in a DNA content profile as a peak below the DNA content of cells in G1 phase. By gating GFP-positive and GFP-negative cells, we determined that 22.9% of cells expressing GFP-Bcl-2 were apoptotic compared with 7.7% apoptotic cells in the population that did not express GFP-Bcl-2 (Fig. 2 A). Because MDA-MB-468 cells demonstrate low transfection efficiency, we chose to test whether this effect is observed in other cell types. Thus, we repeated this transient transfection assay in HEK 293 cells and compared the effect of expression of several Bcl-2 family members including Bax, a known pro-apoptotic protein, and another anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-XL. Bax, Bcl-2, and Bcl-XL were expressed as GFP fusion proteins, and their pattern of expression was observed by fluorescence microscopy in MCF-7 cells, which are well suited for imaging (Fig. 2 B). GFP-Bax was found to be diffusely localized throughout the cytoplasm, and in some cells, it exhibited a punctate pattern, which probably reflects its translocation to the mitochondrial membrane as described previously (12Wolter K. Hsu Y. Smith C. Nechushtan A. Xi X. Youle R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1281-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1577) Google Scholar). GFP-Bcl-2 was found to be localized both in mitochondria, which surround the nucleus, as well as the ER, which resembles an extensive network throughout the cell. Unlike Bcl-2, GFP-Bcl-XL was found to be diffused throughout the cell but was also found in the mitochondrial membranes that surround the nucleus. These expression vectors were subsequently transiently transfected in HEK 293 cells. After 24 h, the cells were harvested and analyzed by flow cytometry. The results indicate that the expression of Bax and Bcl-2 induces apoptosis, whereas Bcl-XL expression did not induce apoptosis significantly above levels observed for GFP transfection alone (Fig. 2 C). These results are also consistent with previous findings in which infection of glioblastoma cells with an adenoviral Bcl-2 expression vector induced apoptosis, whereas infection with a Bcl-XL expression vector did not (26Shinoura N. Yoshida Y. Nishimura M. Muramatsu Y. Asai A. Kirino T. Hamada H. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4119-4128PubMed Google Scholar). It should also be noted that we obtained similar results in transient transfections of MCF-7 cells, although cell death was found to occur more slowly possibly because of the deficiency of caspase-3 in MCF-7 cells. To test whether Bcl-2 can block apoptosis in MDA-MB-468 cells, cells stably overexpressing Bcl-2 and cells containing a control vector were treated with 1 μm staurosporine or 100 nm thapsigargin (Fig. 3). After 48 h, control cells treated with either staurosporine or thapsigargin were found to exhibit typical morphological features of apoptosis, such as lifting from the surface, condensed chromatin, and fragmentation into apoptotic bodies. However, apoptosis was significantly inhibited in Bcl-2 expressing cells treated with either staurosporine or thapsigargin. Thus, as expected, Bcl-2 expressed stably results in the protection of MDA-MB-468 cells from programmed cell death. The discrepancy between the cytotoxic effect of transient Bcl-2 expression and its protective effect in stably expressing cells may be attributed to a difference in expression levels. This view was also shared by others who have previously reported the toxic effect of transient Bcl-2 expression (26Shinoura N. Yoshida Y. Nishimura M. Muramatsu Y. Asai A. Kirino T. Hamada H. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4119-4128PubMed Google Scholar, 27Uhlmann E.J. Subramanian T. Vater C.A. Lutz R. Chinnadurai G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17926-17932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined whether the toxicity of transient transfection of Bcl-2 required expression at much higher levels than that observed in stably transfected cells. To compare Bcl-2 expression levels between transiently and stably transfected MDA-MB-468 cells, Bcl-2 protein was detected on a single cell basis by using an anti-human Bcl-2 monoclonal antibody followed by a secondary antibody-Alexa488 conjugate and measuring fluorescence intensity by flow cytometry (Fig.4 A). It has been previously demonstrated that antibody detection of Bcl-2 protein levels by flow cytometry correlates well with results obtained by Western blot (28Dragowska W.H. Lopes de Menezes D.E. Sartor J. Mayer L.D. Cytometry. 2000; 40: 346-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Analysis of Bcl-2 expression level by this method revealed that 80% of transiently transfected cells expressed Bcl-2 within the same range of Bcl-2 levels detected in stably overexpressing cells (Fig.4 B). Expression levels attained in transiently transfected cells appear to vary over a wider range compared with stably transfected cells, however, only 20% of transiently transfected cells attain Bcl-2 expression levels higher than what is observed in stably transfected cells. When transient Bcl-2-expressing cells that express the same levels as stably expressing cells were analyzed for cell death (Fig. 4 C), we found that ∼20% of these cells were apoptotic, indicating that most of the apoptotic cells expressed the same levels of Bcl-2 as stably expressing cells. The cell death-inducing effect of many pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins has been found to be a result of their association with the mitochondrial membrane. Bax, a cytosolic protein, translocates to the mitochondrial membrane when the cell receives an apoptotic signal (12Wolter K. Hsu Y. Smith C. Nechushtan A. Xi X. Youle"
https://openalex.org/W2031450730,"α-Tocopherol (α-TOH) is associated with plasma lipoproteins and accumulates in cell membranes throughout the body, suggesting that lipoproteins play a role in transporting α-TOH between tissues. Here we show that secretion of α-TOH from cultured cells is mediated in part by ABCA1, an ATP-binding cassette protein that transports cellular cholesterol and phospholipids to lipid-poor high density lipoprotein (HDL) apolipoproteins such as apoA-I. Treatment of human fibroblasts and murine RAW264 macrophages with cholesterol and/or 8-bromo-cyclic AMP, which induces ABCA1 expression, enhanced apoA-I-mediated α-TOH efflux. ApoA-I lacked the ability to remove α-TOH from Tangier disease fibroblasts that have a nonfunctional ABCA1. BHK cells that lack an active ABCA1 pathway markedly increased secretion of α-TOH to apoA-I when forced to express ABCA1. ABCA1 also mediated a fraction of the α-TOH efflux promoted by lipid-containing HDL particles, indicating that HDL promotes α-TOH efflux by both ABCA1-dependent and -independent processes. Exposing apoA-I to ABCA1-expressing cells did not enhance its ability to remove α-TOH from cells lacking ABCA1, consistent with this transporter participating directly in the translocation of α-TOH to apolipoproteins. These studies provide evidence that ABCA1 mediates secretion of cellular α-TOH into the HDL metabolic pathway, a process that may facilitate vitamin transport between tissues and influence lipid oxidation. α-Tocopherol (α-TOH) is associated with plasma lipoproteins and accumulates in cell membranes throughout the body, suggesting that lipoproteins play a role in transporting α-TOH between tissues.

Because of its hydrophobicity, α-TOH is co-transported with lipids in plasma lipoproteins and accumulates in cell membranes throughout the body (1Kayden H.J. Traber M.G. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 343-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In human plasma approximately half of the α-TOH is located in high density lipoproteins (HDL), with the other half being present in low density lipoproteins (LDL) and very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) (1Kayden H.J. Traber M.G. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 343-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phospholipid transfer protein facilitates the transfer of α-TOH between serum lipoproteins and from artificial liposomes to HDL (2Kostner G.M. Oettl K. Jauhiainen M. Ehnholm C. Esterbauer H. Dieplinger H. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 659-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Although it distributes among all major lipoprotein subclasses, some cells take up α-TOH preferentially from HDL (3Guthmann F. Harrach-Ruprecht B. Looman A.C. Stevens P.A. Robenek H. Rustow B. Eur.

This uptake appears to be mediated by a HDL receptor called scavenger receptor B1 (SR-B1) (4Goti D. Reicher H. Malle E. Kostner G.M. Panzenboeck U. Sattler W. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), which also selectively transports HDL cholesteryl esters into cells (7Krieger M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 523-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). These findings implicate HDL as a major transporter of α-TOH between tissues.Processes involved in the secretion of α-TOH from cells are still poorly understood. α-TOH transfer protein (α-TTP), a cytosolic liver protein identified as a product of the causative gene for familial isolated vitamin E deficiency (8Ouahchi K. Arita M. Kayden H. Hentati F. Ben Hamida M. Sokol R. Arai H. Inoue K. Mandel J.L. Koenig M. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar), plays an important role in liver membrane transport and secretion of α-TOH (9Catignani G.L. Bieri J.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 497: 349-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Arita et al. (10Arita M. Nomura K. Arai H. Inoue K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12437-12441Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) showed that a hepatoma cell line expressing α-TTP secreted α-TOH more efficiently than cells lacking α-TTP. They also showed that brefeldin A, which inhibits VLDL secretion by disrupting the Golgi apparatus, had no effect on α-TOH secretion. Based on these results, the authors suggested that hepatic α-TTP stimulates the secretion of cellular α-TOH into the extracellular medium via a novel non-Golgi-mediated pathway that may be linked to cellular cholesterol metabolism and/or transport (10Arita M. Nomura K. Arai H. Inoue K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12437-12441Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To date, however, this suggested pathway has not been identified. Moreover, mechanisms by which extrahepatic cells secrete α-TOH are unknown.Previous studies suggested that HDL and/or its major apolipoprotein, apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), plays a role in promoting secretion of α-TOH from cells. Panzenbock et al. (11Panzenbock U. Kritharides L. Raftery M. Rye K.A. Stocker R. J. Biol.

Lipid-poor apoA-I removes cellular cholesterol and phospholipids by an active transport pathway controlled by an ATP-binding cassette transporter called ABCA1 (12Oram J.F. Vaughan A.M. Curr. Opin.

These studies are consistent with ABCA1 being involved in mobilizing α-TOH from cells into the HDL pathway.Here we used cell lines expressing different levels of ABCA1 to test the possibility that this transporter mediates α-TOH secretion from cells. Results show that efflux of α-TOH from cells to HDL apolipoproteins is a function of ABCA1 expression, further implicating the HDL pathway in the transport of α-TOH between tissues.RESULTSPrevious studies showed that lipid-free apoA-I removes α-TOH from cultured cells (11Panzenbock U.

To test if this involves ABCA1, we compared the ability of apoA-I to remove radiolabeled α-TOH and cholesterol from fibroblasts expressing different amounts of ABCA1. Treatment of immortalized human fibroblasts with cholesterol plus 8-Br-cAMP markedly induces ABCA1 expression and apoA-I-mediated lipid efflux (16Lawn R.M. Wade D.P. Garvin M.R. Wang X. Schwartz K.

In contrast, fibroblasts from patients with Tangier disease have a nonfunctional ABCA1 whether or not they are treated with cholesterol/8-Br-cAMP (16Lawn R.M. Wade D.P. Garvin M.R. Wang X.

When [14C]α-TOH- or [3H]cholesterol-labeled normal and Tangier disease fibroblasts were incubated for 6 h with BSA alone, a higher fraction of α-TOH than cholesterol appeared in the medium (Fig.1), indicating that α-TOH diffuses from cells at a faster rate than cholesterol does. Addition of apoA-I to BSA-containing medium caused only a small or negligible increase in both α-TOH and cholesterol efflux from untreated (control) normal fibroblasts (Fig. 1, A and C) and from both control and cholesterol/8-Br-cAMP-treated Tangier disease cells (Fig.1, B and D). In contrast, when ABCA1 was induced in normal cells by cholesterol/8-Br-cAMP, apoA-I-mediated efflux of both α-TOH and cholesterol increased 5-fold. Dose-response curves revealed that this induced efflux of α-TOH occurred by a high affinity (K d∼10−8m) saturable process (Fig. 2), as is the case for ABCA1-mediated efflux of cholesterol and phospholipids (25Francis G.A. Knopp R.H. Oram J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 78-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Thus, secretion of α-TOH from fibroblasts to apoA-I depends on an induced and functional ABCA1.Figure 2Dose-dependent apoA-I-mediated efflux of α-TOH from normal (NL) and Tangier disease (TD) fibroblasts.

Lipid-free apolipoproteins remove cholesterol from cells by the ABCA1 pathway, whereas phospholipid-containing particles remove cholesterol by ABCA1-independent mechanisms (25Francis G.A. Knopp R.H.

As in Fig. 1, addition of apoA-I to the medium increased α-TOH efflux from normal but not from Tangier disease fibroblasts (Fig.3). The addition of HDL particles, which contain both phospholipids and apolipoproteins, increased α-TOH efflux from both normal and Tangier disease cells, but efflux was increased to a greater extent from normal cells. Trypsinized HDL, which lacks active apolipoproteins (21Mendez A.J. Oram J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1346: 285-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), also stimulated α-TOH efflux from cells, but there were no differences between normal and Tangier disease cells. These results indicate that phospholipids in HDL particles also promote α-TOH efflux, but this occurs by an ABCA1-independent mechanism.Figure 3Effects of different acceptors on α-TOH efflux from normal and Tangier disease fibroblasts. Cells were radiolabeled with [14C]α-TOH and treated with cholesterol and 8-Br-cAMP as described the legend for Fig. 1. [14C]α-TOH efflux was then measured during 6-h incubations with medium containing 1 mg/ml BSA or BSA plus either 5 µg/ml apoA-I, 50 µg/ml HDL protein, or 50 µg/ml trypsinized HDL (TrHDL) protein.

We tested for whether cAMP also stimulates apoA-I-mediated efflux of α-TOH from macrophages. As with control fibroblasts, a higher fraction of α-TOH than cholesterol diffused from untreated RAW264 macrophages in the presence of BSA alone, and the addition of apoA-I had little or no effect on efflux of either compound (Fig. 4). Treatment of these cells with 8-Br-cAMP caused a significant increase in α-TOH and cholesterol efflux only in the presence of apoA-I, indicating that this cAMP analog selectively induced apoA-I-mediated efflux of both compounds. These results show that apoA-I removes α-TOH from macrophages by the cAMP-inducible ABCA1 pathway.Figure 4Comparison of α-TOH and cholesterol (UC) efflux from control and cAMP-treated RAW264 macrophages. Cells were labeled with either [14C]α-TOH or [3H]cholesterol and incubated for 20 h without (Control) or with 8-Br-cAMP (cAMP) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Efflux was then measured during 2-h incubations with medium containing either 1 mg/ml BSA alone or BSA plus 5 µg/ml apoA-I.

ApoA-I-mediated efflux was calculated as described for Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We overexpressed ABCA1 in cells to determine whether this would enhance α-TOH secretion. For these studies, we transfected BHK cells with an inducible ABCA1 gene, radiolabeled cells with [14C]α-TOH, induced ABCA1 expression, and measured apoA-I-mediated α-TOH efflux. Control BHK cells contain virtually no detectable ABCA1, whereas induced cells express very high levels of this protein (Fig. 5A, inset). Based on immunoblots, this expression level is 5–10-fold higher than maximum levels in human fibroblasts or murine macrophages. ApoA-I promoted significant cholesterol and phospholipid efflux only from the induced cells (not shown). Inducing ABCA1 expression caused only a small increase in α-TOH efflux in the presence of BSA alone. ApoA-I removed very little α-TOH from control cells but markedly stimulated α-TOH efflux from ABCA1 transfectants (Fig. 5 A), indicating that apoA-I-mediated α-TOH secretion requires expression of ABCA1.Figure 5Effect of forced expression of ABCA1 on α-TOH efflux from BHK cells. A, mock (Control) and ABCA1-transfected BHK cells were radiolabeled with [14C]α-TOH, and ABCA1 was induced by mifepristone as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Efflux of α-TOH was then measured during 2-h incubations with 1 mg/ml BSA alone or with BSA plus 5 µg/ml apoA-I. The inset shows an immunoblot of ABCA1 in control and ABCA1-transfected cells. B, control and ABCA1-expressing BHK cells were incubated for 4 h with medium containing BSA alone or BSA plus apoA-I, the medium was transferred to [14C]α-TOH-labeled control cells, and [14C]α-TOH efflux was then measured during 2-h incubations. The results are the mean ± S.D. of triplicate incubations expressed as percent of total [14C]α-TOH appearing in the medium. ApoA-I-mediated efflux was calculated as described in the legend for Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Two possible mechanisms could account for the role of ABCA1 in transporting cellular α-TOH to lipid-free apoA-I. First, ABCA1 could transfer phospholipids to apoA-I, generating acceptors for α-TOH that diffuses from cells by ABCA1-independent processes. Second, ABCA1 could transfer α-TOH directly along with other lipids to apolipoproteins. To distinguish between these mechanisms, we incubated unlabeled control and ABCA1-transfected BHK cells for 4 h with apoA-I, transferred the media to [14C]α-TOH-labeled control cells (low ABCA1), and measured [14C]α-TOH efflux during the second incubations. Results showed that apoA-I had little ability to promote α-TOH efflux from control cells whether pre-incubated with cells expressing very low or high levels of ABCA1 (Fig. 5 B). Therefore, under these incubation conditions, apoA-I did not acquire enough phospholipid mass by the ABCA1 pathway to become an acceptor for α-TOH that diffuses from cells. This makes it likely that ABCA1 participates directly in the transport of α-TOH from cells to apolipoproteins.We also examined the possibility that ABCA1 may be involved in transporting α-TOH into cells. The results showed that there was no difference in the cellular uptake of [14C]α-TOH between normal and Tangier disease fibroblasts (data not shown). Moreover, none of the treatment protocols used in this study, which were inserted between the labeling and efflux incubations, had a significant effect on the cellular content of [14C]α-TOH. It appears therefore that ABCA1 mediates the unidirectional transport of α-TOH from cells to suitable extracellular acceptors.DISCUSSIONPrevious studies showed that lipid-free apoA-I promotes secretion of α-TOH from cells (11Panzenbock U. Kritharides L. Raftery M. Rye K.A. Stocker R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19536-19544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Here we show that this occurs by the ABCA1 lipid secretory pathway. Three lines of evidence support this conclusion. First, treatment of human fibroblasts and murine RAW264 macrophages with cholesterol and/or 8-Br-cAMP, which induces ABCA1 expression and apoA-I-mediated lipid removal (16Lawn R.M. Wade D.P. Garvin M.R. Wang X. Schwartz K. Porter J.G. Seilhamer J.J. Vaughan A.M. Oram J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: R25-R31Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, 23Oram J.F. Mendez A.J. Lymp J. Kavanagh T.J. Halbert C.L. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1769-1781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), also enhanced apoA-I mediated α-TOH efflux. Second, apoA-I lacked the ability to remove α-TOH from Tangier disease fibroblasts that have a nonfunctional ABCA1. Third, BHK cells that lack an active ABCA1 pathway in the basal state markedly increased secretion of α-TOH to apoA-I when forced to express ABCA1.The current study shows that mature HDL particles are also capable of promoting α-TOH efflux from cells. Comparisons of normal and Tangier disease cells exposed to native and trypsin-treated HDL revealed that this efflux occurs by both ABCA1-dependent and -independent processes. The rate of diffusion of α-TOH from cells exceeds that observed for cholesterol, which may reflect the comparatively greater hydrophilicity of the vitamin. These findings indicate that lipoproteins can remove α-TOH from cells by both passive and active processes.The diffusible properties of α-TOH raised the possibility that the effects of ABCA1 on α-TOH secretion were indirect. By lipidating apoA-I, ABCA1 may have generated acceptors for α-TOH that passively desorbs from the plasma membrane. Our pulse-chase studies, however, showed that exposing apoA-I to cells expressing high levels of ABCA1 did not increase its ability to remove α-TOH from cells lacking ABCA1. These findings indicate that, during the brief incubations used in these studies, ABCA1 did not lipidate apoA-I enough to generate acceptors for α-TOH that diffuses from cells. Thus, ABCA1 appears to be involved directly in transporting α-TOH. It is possible that ABCA1 co-transports α-TOH, cholesterol, and phospholipids to the cell surface where the lipid complex is solubilized and removed by apolipoproteins (12Oram J.F. Vaughan A.M. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2000; 11: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar).ABCA1 plays a gatekeeper role in transporting tissue cholesterol into the HDL metabolic pathway (12Oram J.F. Vaughan A.M. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2000; 11: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The current study suggests that this protein also functions to transport α-TOH taken up by tissues back into plasma via apoA-I and HDL. Although α-TOH distributes among all major lipoprotein subclasses, HDL is the preferred vehicle for transport of α-TOH to at least some tissues (3Guthmann F. Harrach-Ruprecht B. Looman A.C. Stevens P.A. Robenek H. Rustow B. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 74: 197-207PubMed Google Scholar, 4Goti D. Reicher H. Malle E. Kostner G.M. Panzenboeck U. Sattler W. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 5Nakamura T. Reicher H. Sattler W. Lipids. 1998; 33: 1001-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 6Kolleck I. Schlame M. Fechner H. Looman A.C. Wissel H. Rustow B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 882-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This tissue uptake appears to utilize the SR-B1 receptor system (4Goti D. Reicher H. Malle E. Kostner G.M. Panzenboeck U. Sattler W. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), which also selectively transports cholesteryl esters from HDL into cells (7Krieger M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 523-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Interestingly, expression of SR-B1 is suppressed when liver cells accumulate α-TOH, consistent with feedback repression of α-TOH delivery into cells by this pathway (29Witt W. Kolleck I. Fechner H. Sinha P. Rustow B. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 2009-2016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We found that supplementing macrophages and fibroblasts with α-TOH had no effect on ABCA1 expression (data not shown), implying that α-TOH does not regulate its secretion by this transporter. Taken together, these studies suggest that SR-B1 and ABCA1 operate in concert to transport α-TOH between tissues by the HDL pathway.ABCA1 is highly expressed in the liver, where it may play a role in secreting dietary α-TOH delivered to the liver from the intestine via apoB-containing lipoproteins. Hepatocytes contain α-TTP, which retains α-TOH, transports the vitamin between membranes, and promotes its secretion (9Catignani G.L. Bieri J.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 497: 349-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 10Arita M. Nomura K. Arai H. Inoue K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12437-12441Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Because much of the α-TOH secreted from hepatocytes in vivo is associated with nascent VLDL, it was assumed that α-TTP facilitates incorporation of α-TOH into VLDL during its assembly and secretion. Arita et al. (10Arita M. Nomura K. Arai H. Inoue K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12437-12441Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), however, showed that α-TTP stimulates secretion of α-TOH from cultured hepatocytes by a pathway distinct from lipoprotein assembly but linked to cholesterol metabolism and/or transport. Our results suggest that this pathway involves ABCA1 and suitable extracellular acceptors of α-TOH. The secreted α-TOH may then distribute among lipoproteins by a process facilitated by phospholipid transfer protein (2Kostner G.M. Oettl K. Jauhiainen M. Ehnholm C. Esterbauer H. Dieplinger H. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 659-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar).The ABCA1 pathway may also help generate α-TOH in tissues to alleviate oxidative stress. Macrophages ingest large amounts of cell-derived cholesterol and other lipids within tissues with high rates of cell turnover and at sites of inflammation. In the artery wall, macrophages take up oxidized lipoproteins, leading to atherogenic foam cell formation. Cholesterol accumulation in macrophages induces ABCA1 expression (30Langmann T. Klucken J. Reil M. Liebisch G. Luciani M.F. Chimini G. Kaminski W.E. Schmitz G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), which would be predicted to increase secretion of α-TOH along with cholesterol and phospholipids. In support of this idea is a study by Asmis and Jelk (31Asmis R. Jelk J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 2078-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) showing that cholesterol loading of cultured macrophages depletes them of α-TOH. Whether this renders cells more susceptible to subsequent oxidation is not clear at present. Although some intracellular α-TOH may be localized to sites for release into the extracellular environment, other pools of α-TOH may protect cells against oxidation. The α-TOH transported from cells by ABCA1 may help protect co-secreted and other extracellular lipids from oxidation. Increased secretion of cellular α-TOH by lipid-laden macrophages could also help explain why lipoproteins in diseased artery walls contain relatively normal amounts of vitamin E despite the fact that their lipids are oxidized (32Niu X. Zammit V. Upston J.M. Dean R.T. Stocker R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 1708-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).The current study shows that lipophilic compounds other than cholesterol and phospholipids utilize the ABCA1 pathway for secretion from cells. The robust induction of ABCA1 by sterols implies that these molecules are primary targets for secretion by this transporter. Our results suggest that secretion of at least some cellular pools of α-TOH is tightly linked to sterol metabolism and transport. It remains to be determined whether this also applies to other fat-soluble vitamins and lipophilic compounds. α-Tocopherol (α-TOH)1 is the most chemically and biologically active form of vitamin E, an essential fat-soluble nutrient with antioxidant properties. Because of its hydrophobicity, α-TOH is co-transported with lipids in plasma lipoproteins and accumulates in cell membranes throughout the body (1Kayden H.J. Traber M.G. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 343-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In human plasma approximately half of the α-TOH is located in high density lipoproteins (HDL), with the other half being present in low densit"

Hosoda H. Date Y. Nakazato M. Matsuo H. Kangawa K. Nature. 1999; 402: 656-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (7159) Google Scholar). This novel molecule, a 28-amino acid peptide named ghrelin (from “ghre,” the Proto-Indo-European root of “grow”), possesses a unique serine residue at the third N-terminal position (Ser3) that is n-octanoylated (8Kojima M.

Acylation of Ser3 is essential for ghrelin bioactivity. cDNA analysis revealed that the rat ghrelin sequence follows the 23-residue signal sequence within the 117-residue prepro-ghrelin. Ghrelin stimulates GH secretion both in vivo and in vitro. Accumulating evidence in mammals suggests that, in addition to regulating GH release, ghrelin also influences feeding behavior (10Wren A.M.

Limited studies in these organisms, however, suggest the involvement of GHS homologues in GH regulation. In the chicken, a growth hormone-releasing peptide (GHRP)-6 induces GH secretion in vivo (15Bowers C.Y. Momany F.A. Reynolds G.A. Hong A. Endocrinology. 1984; 114: 1537-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). A nonpeptidyl GHS, L-692,429, also stimulated GH secretion in the chicken in vivo and in vitro(16Geris K.L.

These findings suggest that GHS-Rs and their natural ligands are necessary for the function to regulate GH secretion in non-mammalian vertebrates.In this study, we have identified ghrelin and the precursor cDNA in an amphibian, the bullfrog. The structure of bullfrog ghrelin contains an n-octanoylated threonine at amino acid position 3, differing from the serine present in the mammalian forms. Bullfrog ghrelin stimulates GH and prolactin (PRL) secretion in bullfrog but is unable to mediate this effect in the rat.DISCUSSIONWe isolated an amphibian ghrelin using a stable cell line expressing rat GHS-R (CHO-GHSR62) binding ghrelin. Bullfrog ghrelin was a potent ligand for the rat GHS-R, clearly demonstrating the GH-releasing activity of ghrelin in this system and in bullfrog adenohypophyseal cells.The Ser3 hydroxyl group of the mammalian ghrelins is acylated by n-octanoic acid. Des-n-octanoyl form of ghrelin, designated as des-acyl ghrelin, has no effect on [Ca2+]i in CHO-GHSR62 cells (8Kojima M. Hosoda H. Date Y. Nakazato M. Matsuo H. Kangawa K. Nature. 1999; 402: 656-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (7159) Google Scholar). This acylation, therefore, is essential for the biological activity of ghrelin (8Kojima M. Hosoda H. Date Y. Nakazato M. Matsuo H. Kangawa K. Nature. 1999; 402: 656-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (7159) Google Scholar, 9Hosoda H. Kojima M. Matsuo H. Kangawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21995-22000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The present study revealed that bullfrog ghrelin changes the acylated amino acid from Ser to Thr, the first report of an amino acid residue other than Ser of the ghrelin molecule that isn-octanoylated. This amino acid alteration at position 3 occurs by a point mutation of codon from AGC to ACC. Both Ser and Thr contain a hydroxyl group, creating the acylation site. These results suggest that the n-octanoyl modification of the position 3 amino acid hydroxyl group is the general structure of ghrelin across multiple species. As bullfrog ghrelin increases [Ca2+]i in CHO-GHSR62 cells and stimulates GH secretion from the dispersed bullfrog adenohypophyseal cells, this acylation may mediate the biological activity of ghrelin.We also identified a bullfrog ghrelin acylated by n-decanoic acid, the first report of acylation of ghrelin by a modifier other thann-octanoic acid. We have also observed n-decanoic acid acylation of a ghrelin present in human stomach, comprising 23% of the isolated ghrelin. 2H. Hosoda, personal communication. Approximately 35 pmol of decanoyl-modified ghrelin was isolated from bullfrog stomach, 33% of the isolated bullfrog ghrelin (105 pmol). A decanoyl-modified ghrelin has not been identified in the rat.2 These differences may be species-specific. The mechanisms governing peptide acylation in the posttranslational processing of ghrelin, however, are still unknown.Two lengths of bullfrog ghrelin were isolated in this study, one of 28 residues and the other of 27 residues. The later has a residue deleted from the C terminus of the 28-residue ghrelin. Analysis of the bullfrog ghrelin cDNA revealed that a typical dibasic processing sequence, Arg-Arg, follows the C terminus of the 28-residue ghrelin. The yield of 28-residue ghrelin (20 pmol) was less than that of the 27-residue ghrelin (86 pmol) in this purification. The mechanism governing the greater abundance of the 27-residue bullfrog ghrelin is unclear; it is likely, however, that an unusual endoproteolytic processing mechanism controls the maturation of bullfrog ghrelin.The sequence of bullfrog ghrelin differs substantially from the mammalian counterparts (30% identity).

Bullfrog ghrelin elicited increases in [Ca2+]i in CHO-GHSR62 cells expressing rat GHS-R with a reduced potency from rat ghrelin. The Gly-Ser-Ser (n-octanoyl)-Phe-Leu segment at the N terminus constitutes the “active core” required for agonist potency at GHS-R (29Bednarek M.A. Feighner S.D. Pong S.S. McKee K.K. Hreniuk D.L.

Hosoda H. Date Y. Nakazato M. Matsuo H. Kangawa K. Nature. 1999; 402: 656-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (7159) Google Scholar). Des-acyl ghrelin does not bind to GHS-R (28Muccioli G. Papotti M. Locatelli V. Ghigo E. Deghenghi R. J. Endocrinol. Invest. 2001; 24: RC7-RC9Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In addition to the N-terminal amino acid sequence, the acylated amino acid at position 3 is involved in receptor binding and subsequent signal transduction.Bullfrog ghrelin demonstrates a potent GH-releasing activity in bullfrog adenohypophyseal cells, with only a weak GH-releasing activity in in vivo experiment of rat. This result indicates the species specificity of the ligand binding to the receptor, suggesting that the structure of GHS-R ligand recognition is different between the bullfrog and rat. Although the bullfrog GHS-R has not been defined, key amino acid residues essential for ligand binding and activation have been defined in transmembrane regions 3 and 4 in human GHS-R (30Feighner S.D. Howard A.D. Prendergast K. Palyha O.C. Hreniuk D.L. Nargund R. Underwood D. Tata J.R. Dean D.C. Tan C.P. McKee K.K. Woods J.W. Patchett A.A. Smith R.G. Van der Ploeg L.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The N-terminal sequence of ghrelin is believed to contain the key amino acids for binding to the receptor. Amino acids at positions 2 and 3 in bullfrog ghrelin, however, are altered to Leu2-Thr3, instead of Ser2-Ser3 present in the mammalian ghrelins. Amino acids at positions 2 and 3 of the bullfrog ghrelin are likely to be important in the recognition of the ligand by bullfrog GHS-R.Bullfrog ghrelin potently stimulated GH secretion in bullfrog adenohypophyseal cells. Hypothalamic GHRH primarily stimulates GH secretion in mammals (1Bertherat J. Bluet-Pajot M.T. Epelbaum J. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1995; 132: 12-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Although a bullfrog GHRH has not been identified, GH-releasing activity by human GHRH has been observed in the bullfrog in vitro (31Jeandel L. Okuno A. Kobayashi T. Kikuyama S. Tostivint H. Lihrmann I. Chartrel N. Conlon J.M. Fournier A. Tonon M.C. Vaudry H. J. Neuroendocrinol. 1998; 10: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A GHRH-like peptide in the frog (Rana ridibunda) stimulates GH secretion from the bullfrog pituitary cell (32Alexandre D. Vaudry H. Jegou S. Anouar Y. J. Comp. Neurol. 2000; 421: 234-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 33Hu Z. Lelievre V. Tam J. Cheng J.W. Fuenzalida G. Zhou X. Waschek J.A.

Endocrinol. 2000; 25: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the regulatory mechanism governing GH secretion by GHRH exists in the frog. In addition, thyrotropin-releasing hormone (27Aida T. Yamamoto K. Kikuyama S. Gen. Comp. Endocrinol. 1999; 115: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), proopiomelanocortin-derived peptides (27Aida T. Yamamoto K. Kikuyama S. Gen. Comp. Endocrinol. 1999; 115: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (34Montero M. Yon L. Kikuyama S. Dufour S. Vaudry H. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 25: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and endothelin (35Suzuki H. Yamamoto T. Kikuyama S. Oguchi A. Uemura H. Kawashima S. Kikuyama S. Advances in Comparative Endocrinology. Monduzzi Editore, Bologna, Italy1997: 1033-1037Google Scholar) are involved in GH release in the frog. These facts indicate that the stimulation of GH secretion in frog is governed by a complicated hypothalamic hormonal regulation.Ghrelin is also synthesized in the brain of rat (8Kojima M. Hosoda H. Date Y. Nakazato M. Matsuo H. Kangawa K. Nature. 1999; 402: 656-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (7159) Google Scholar). The few ghrelin-producing cells are located in a specific hypothalamic region, the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (8Kojima M. Hosoda H. Date Y. Nakazato M. Matsuo H. Kangawa K. Nature. 1999; 402: 656-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (7159) Google Scholar), participating in the regulation of GH secretion from the pituitary (36Date Y. Murakami N. Kojima M. Kuroiwa T. Matsukura S. Kangawa K. Nakazato M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 477-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). The presence of hypothalamic ghrelin in the bullfrog has not been confirmed. The gene expression of ghrelin in the bullfrog brain was not detectable by either Northern blot or RT-PCR analyses. In bullfrog, the expression of the ghrelin gene or the number of ghrelin-producing cells may be too low for detection, even by RT-PCR. As hypothalamic ghrelin may still play a role in the stimulation of GH secretion (36Date Y. Murakami N. Kojima M. Kuroiwa T. Matsukura S. Kangawa K. Nakazato M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 477-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), it will be important to identify the expression of ghrelin in the bullfrog brain.Bullfrog ghrelin is predominantly synthesized in the stomach, as seen in the rat. In both the bullfrog and the rat, ghrelin produced and secreted from the stomach is likely to act on the pituitary gland through the systemic circulation. This novel regulatory mechanism controlling GH secretion by a mechanism independent from hypothalamic hormonal control is present in mammals and in amphibians.Bullfrog ghrelin also stimulated PRL secretion in bullfrog adenohypophyseal cells. The effect is more potent than that observed for GH secretion. In the rat, PRL secretion is not stimulated by rat ghrelin either in vivo or in vitro (8Kojima M. Hosoda H. Date Y. Nakazato M. Matsuo H. Kangawa K. Nature. 1999; 402: 656-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (7159) Google Scholar). In the bullfrog, GH and PRL are produced and secreted by different cells (22Kobayashi T. Kikuyama S. Gen. Comp. Endocrinol. 1991; 82: 14-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), suggesting that the coordinate GHS-R may be expressed on both GH- and PRL-producing cells.In addition to the stomach, bullfrog ghrelin is synthesized in the heart, lung, pancreas, gall bladder, small intestine, and testes at low levels. In mammals, the GHS-R is also expressed peripherally at low levels in various tissues, such as the heart, lung, pancreas, intestine, adrenal, ovary, testes, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue (4Blake A.D. Smith R.G. J. Endocrinol. 1991; 129: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 37Bodart V. Bouchard J.F. McNicoll N. Escher E. Carriere P. Ghigo E. Sejlitz T. Sirois M.G. Lamontagne D. Ong H.

Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 48: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). In accordance with the receptor distribution, a cardiovascular function of GHRP has been observed (39Muccioli G. Broglio F. Valetto M.R. Ghe C. Catapano F. Graziani A. Papotti M. Bisi G. Deghenghi R. Ghigo E. Ann. Endocrinol. (Paris). 2000; 61: 27-31PubMed Google Scholar). The distribution of GHS-R in the bullfrog has not yet been examined, but ghrelin may also act on peripheral tissues as an endocrine, paracrine, and/or autocrine factor through the GHS-R.The discovery of amphibian ghrelin demonstrates the relevance of ghrelin in non-mammalian systems. In previous functional studies of the GHS-R in non-mammalian species, artificial ligands such as GHRPs and nonpeptidyl GHSs have been utilized. A GHS-R homologue identified in the pufferfish shares 58% identity to human GHS-R and is activated by GHRP-6 and nonpeptidyl GHSs (17Palyha O.C. Feighner S.D. Tan C.P. McKee K.K Hreniuk D.L Gao Y.D. Schleim K.D. Yang L. Morriello G.J. Nargund R. Patchett A.A. Howard A.D. Smith R.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 160-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), suggesting that GHS binding to the GHS-R is not species-specific. These GHS species, however, bind relatively weakly to pufferfish, compared with human GHS-R, possibly due to structural differences between the two receptors. GHS is a more potent agonist of human and/or rat GHS-R. GHSs can stimulate GH secretion in chicken (15Bowers C.Y. Momany F.A. Reynolds G.A. Hong A. Endocrinology. 1984; 114: 1537-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar, 16Geris K.L. Hickey G.J. Berghman L.R. Visser T.J. Kühn E.R. Darras V.M. Gen. Comp. Endocrinol. 1998; 111: 186-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and teleost fish such as tilapia (18Shepherd B.S. Eckert S.M. Parhar I.S. Vijayan M.M. Wakabayashi I. Hirano T. Grau E.G. Chen T.T. J. Endocrinol. 2000; 167: R7-R10Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), suggesting that GHSs bind to functional GHS-Rs in non-mammals. The present study demonstrates that GHRP-6 can stimulate GH release from the bullfrog pituitary. However, its potency is weak compared with frog ghrelin even though they both bind to the coordinate GHS-R. This may be due to different affinities of the natural and artificial ligands, an issue that should be resolved upon identification of the cognate bullfrog GHS-R. GHRP-6 stimulated PRL secretion from the bullfrog pituitary with a comparable potency to frog ghrelin. Little is known about the PRL-releasing activity of GHS in non-mammalian species. In tilapia, GHS tends to increase the plasma PRL level on a different time scale than GH levels are affected (18Shepherd B.S. Eckert S.M. Parhar I.S. Vijayan M.M. Wakabayashi I. Hirano T. Grau E.G. Chen T.T. J. Endocrinol. 2000; 167: R7-R10Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Ghrelin does not stimulate PRL secretion in rats either in vitro or in vitro(8Kojima M. Hosoda H. Date Y. Nakazato M. Matsuo H. Kangawa K. Nature. 1999; 402: 656-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (7159) Google Scholar). These results suggest that ghrelin and GHS function as PRL secretagogues in non-mammals. This effect may be species-specific, seen especially in lower vertebrates. The evolutionary distribution of the GHS-R on cells producing GH (somatotrophs), PRL (lactotrophs) or both GH and PRL (mammosomatotrophs) may have influenced the GH- and PRL-releasing activities of ghrelin. It would be worthwhile, then, to examine the PRL-releasing activity of ghrelin in fish or chicken.Our research suggests that an endogenous ligand for the GHS receptor, ghrelin, is widely present in vertebrates. The ligand has similar physiological functions across species, governing the release of GH. Growth hormone (GH)1secretion from the pituitary gland is regulated by hypothalamic hormones; growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) stimulates GH secretion, whereas somatostatin is inhibitory (1Bertherat J. Bluet-Pajot M.T. Epelbaum J. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1995; 132: 12-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Derivatives of Met-enkephalin stimulate GH release (2Bowers C.Y. Chang J. Momany F.A. Folkers K. MacIntyre G. Szelke H. Molecular Endocrinology. Elsevier, North Holland, Amsterdam1977: 287-292Google Scholar), the first demonstration that small synthetic peptides and nonpeptide molecules, dubbed growth hormone secretagogues (GHSs), can mediate GH release through a receptor distinct from that of GHRH (3Cheng K.

Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), suggesting that one or more unknown ligands for this receptor are endogenously present. We recently discovered an endogenous ligand for GHS-R from the rat stomach, using an intracellular calcium influx assay in stable cell lines expressing rat GHS-R (8Kojima M. Hosoda H. Date Y. Nakazato M. Matsuo H. Kangawa K. Nature. 1999; 402: 656-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (7159) Google Scholar). This novel molecule, a 28-amino acid peptide named ghrelin (from “ghre,” the Proto-Indo-European root of “grow”), possesses a unique serine residue at the third N-terminal position (Ser3) that is n-octanoylated (8Kojima M. Hosoda H. Date Y. Nakazato M. Matsuo H. Kangawa K. Nature. 1999; 402: 656-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (7159) Google Scholar, 9Hosoda H. Kojima M. Matsuo H. Kangawa K. J. Biol.

Acylation of Ser3 is essential for ghrelin bioactivity. cDNA analysis revealed that the rat ghrelin sequence follows the 23-residue signal sequence within the 117-residue prepro-ghrelin. Ghrelin stimulates GH secretion both in vivo and in vitro. Accumulating evidence in mammals suggests that, in addition to regulating GH release, ghrelin also influences feeding behavior (10Wren A.M.

Limited studies in these organisms, however, suggest the involvement of GHS homologues in GH regulation. In the chicken, a growth hormone-releasing peptide (GHRP)-6 induces GH secretion in vivo (15Bowers C.Y. Momany F.A. Reynolds G.A. Hong A. Endocrinology. 1984; 114: 1537-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). A nonpeptidyl GHS, L-692,429, also stimulated GH secretion in the chicken in vivo and in vitro(16Geris K.L.

Whereas LXRβ is expressed in most tissues, LXRα is abundantly expressed in a more restricted set of tissues including the liver, kidney, spleen, intestine, and in macrophages (1Apfel R. Benbrook D.

Over the past several years, the LXRs have been shown to regulate a number of genes involved in cholesterol absorption, transport, and excretion. For example, in the rodent liver, LXRα stimulates the transcription of cholesterol 7α hydroxylase (CYP7A1) (11Peet D.J. Turley S.D. Ma W. Janowski B.A. Lobaccaro J.M. Hammer R.E. Mangelsdorf D.J. Cell. 1998; 93: 693-704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar), the rate-limiting enzyme in the classical pathway for the conversion of cholesterol to bile acids (12Russell D.W. Setchell K.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4737-4749Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar,13Chiang J.Y.L. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: D176-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). When fed a cholesterol-rich diet, mice lacking functional LXRα failed to up-regulate Cyp7a1 and accumulated copious amounts of cholesterol in their livers (11Peet D.J. Turley S.D. Ma W. Janowski B.A. Lobaccaro J.M. Hammer R.E. Mangelsdorf D.J. Cell. 1998; 93: 693-704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar). Thus, LXRα is critical for the elimination of excess cholesterol from the mouse liver. More recently, the LXRs have been shown to have a central role in the regulation of reverse cholesterol transport, a process whereby excess cholesterol is transferred in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles from peripheral tissues to the liver for elimination from the body (14Tall A.R. Wang N. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 1205-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The biology of the LXRs and their cholesterol transporter target genes is of particular disease relevance in macrophages since the accumulation of lipids in these cells is a critical step in their transformation into foam cells in fatty streak lesions in atherosclerotic vasculature subendothelium (15Schachter M. Int. J. Cardiol. 1997; 62: S3-7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Ross R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 791-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). One of the principal vehicles for lipid accumulation is oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL), which contains a number of oxysterol LXR ligands (17Schroepfer Jr., G.J. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 361-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). In macrophages, the LXRs regulate the expression of the adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette (ABC) proteins A1 and G1 (18Costet P. Luo Y. Wang N. Tall A.R. J. Biol.

LXR-dependent regulation of cholesterol efflux may prove to be an important antiatherogenic process amenable to pharmacological intervention with LXR agonists. In studies performed in macrophages and macrophage cell lines, we have discovered that one of the genes regulated by the LXRs is LXRα. Notably, this positive feedback loop is specific to human macrophages. We hypothesize that this regulatory pathway increases the magnitude of the biological response to rising cellular levels of cholesterol and other components of oxLDL and, thus, represents an important component of macrophage lipid physiology. THP-1 cells were maintained in suspension for passage and growth in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA), 100 units/ml penicillin/100 μg/ml streptomycin (Irvine Scientific), 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen), and 55 μmβ-mercaptoethanol (Sigma). Passaging was performed every 3–4 days at a 1:4 dilution. For experiments, 1 × 106cells/well were plated in 6-well plates in media supplemented with 100 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate (Sigma) to induce differentiation. Cells were maintained in this media for 5 days prior to treatment with LXR agonists. RAW 264.7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) containing 10% FBS (Irvine Scientific), 2 mml-glutamine (Invitrogen) and 100 units/ml penicillin/100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Passaging was performed by scraping every 3–4 days at 1:3 dilutions. Cells were plated at 5 × 105 cells/well into 6-well plates or 5 × 106 cells into T75 flasks and dosing was begun when the cells had grown to ∼50% confluency. FHs74 cells were grown in Hybri-Care medium (ATCC, Manassas, VA) supplemented with 10% FBS and 30 ng/ml epidermal growth factor PBS (Sigma). Cells were passaged by trypsinization every 3–4 days at a 1:3 dilution. Cells were plated at 3 × 105 cells/well into 6-well plates or 3 × 106 cells into T75 flasks. Treatments began when cells were ∼50% confluent. Primary human adipocytes (Zen-Bio, Research Triangle Park, NC) were supplied in 6-well plates in a proprietary culture media. After cells arrived, the media was changed and the cells allowed to recover overnight, whereupon drug treatments commenced. Cells were ∼60–80% confluent at this time. Primary human hepatocytes pre-plated in 6-well plates were obtained from either Stephen Strom (University of Pittsburgh) or Clonetics (Walkersville, MD). Hepatocyte media consists of Williams’ E (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine and ITS-G (insulin-transferrin-selenium-G, Invitrogen). Primary human macrophages were isolated and cultured as follows. Human blood was freshly drawn into heparin-treated tubes and diluted 1:3 with phosphate-buffered saline containing 2 mm EDTA. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were collected by ficoll density separation by overlaying 25 ml of diluted blood on 25 ml of LymphoPrep reagent (Nycomed Pharma AS, Asker, Norway). After centrifugation according to the LymphoPrep protocol, the leukocyte layer was collected. Monocytes were isolated from PBMC by an indirect magnetic cell isolation technique. In this system, non-monocyte PBMC cell subsets are labeled with subset-specific antibody-coated magnetic beads (Monocyte Isolation Kit, Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA) and then separated from unlabeled monocytes with a magnet (VarioMACS separator, Miltenyi Biotec). Unretained cells were found to be >95% monocytes by flow cytometry. Postseparation, monocytes were washed and maintained overnight at 1 × 106 cells/well in 6-well plates in DMEM containing 10% FBS, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin/100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.1 ng/ml GM-CSF (BD PharMingen, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Cultured cells and cell lines were generally dosed with compounds dissolved in the same culture media in which they were grown. Treatments included the LXRα/β agonists GW3965 (32Oliver Jr., W.R.

Generally, the culture media was replaced with media containing vehicle (Me2SO or ethanol) or 1–10 μm drugs at 0 h. FHs74 cells were harvested for RNA isolation 48 h after the initial dosing; human macrophages and hepatocytes were treated a second time at 24 h and harvested 4 h later; THP-1 and RAW 264.7 cells were dosed a second time at 24 h and then harvested 24 h later; adipocytes were treated a second time at 48 h and harvested 4 h later. The transcriptional initiation site of the human LXRα gene was determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5′-RACE) using a 5′/3′ RACE kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and THP-1 total RNA prepared as described below. The primers used were based on the 5′-end of the published human LXRα cDNA (2Willy P.J. Umesono K. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Heyman R.A. Mangelsdorf D.J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1033-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). The sequences are as follows: SP1, 5′-GGCCCCCAGCCACAAGGACAT-3′; SP2, 5′-CTCTTCCTGGAGCCCT-3′; SP3, 5′-CATTACCAAGGCACTG-3′. SP1–3 are nested primers with SP1 positioned the furthest downstream. Male C57-Bl/6 mice maintained on a regular chow diet were dosed twice daily by oral gavage with 0.5% methyl cellulose or 10 mg/kg GW3965 suspended in 0.5% methyl cellulose. After 2 days dosing, peritoneal macrophages, liver, and intestine were collected. Peritoneal macrophages were harvested by flushing the abdominal cavity with 10 ml ice-cold DMEM containing 10% FBS (Irvine Scientific). The media was withdrawn and spun at 3000 × g for 10 min in a tabletop centrifuge. Cell pellets were lysed in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and RNA extracted according to the manufacturer's instructions. Intestine samples were removed and flushed with ice-cold saline. Liver and intestine samples were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and held at −80 °C prior to RNA isolation. Total RNA samples were diluted to 100 μg/ml and treated with 40 units/ml RNA-free DNase-I (Ambion, Austin, TX) for 30 min at 37 °C followed by inactivation at 75 °C for 5 min. Samples were quantitated by spectrophotometry or with the RiboGreen assay (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and diluted to a concentration of 10 ng/μl. Samples were assayed in duplicate 25-μl reactions using 25 ng of RNA/reaction with PerkinElmer chemistry on an ABI Prism 7700 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Gene-specific primers were used at 7.5 or 22.5 pmol/reaction and optimized for each gene examined, and the gene-specific fluorescently tagged probe was used at 5 pmol/reaction. In this system, the probe is degraded by Taqpolymerase during the amplification phase, releasing the fluorescent tag from its quenched state; amplification data is expressed as the number of PCR cycles required to elevate the fluorescence signal beyond a threshold intensity level. Fold induction values were calculated by subtracting the mean threshold cycle number for each treatment group from the mean threshold cycle number for the vehicle group and raising 2 to the power of this difference. Northern blot analysis was performed exactly as described elsewhere (33Goodwin B. Jones S.A. Price R.R. Watson M.A. McKee D.D. Moore L.B. Galardi C. Wilson J.G. Lewis M.C. Roth M.E. Maloney P.R.

Briefly, 10 μg of total RNA was electrophoresed in a denaturing agarose gel and transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond N+, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Human LXRα and LXRβ cDNA corresponding to the ligand-binding domain was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random priming using a commercially available system (Megaprime, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Blots were sequentially probed with radiolabeled LXRα, LXRβ, and β-actin (CLONTECH Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA) using standard techniques. DNA-receptor protein interactions were examined by electrophoretic mobility shift assays as described elsewhere (33Goodwin B. Jones S.A. Price R.R. Watson M.A. McKee D.D. Moore L.B. Galardi C.

Competitor oligonucleotides were added at 5-, 15-, or 75-fold molar excess (mutant oligonucleotide added only at 75-fold molar excess). The binding reactions were resolved on a pre-electrophoresed 0.4 × TBE, 4% polyacrylamide gel at room temperature. Human LXRα, LXRβ, and RXRα proteins were synthesized from pSG5-hLXRα, LXRβ, and RXRα using the TNT T7-coupled reticulocyte system (Promega, Madison, WI). The oligonucleotides used in the experiments described here were as follows (sense strand only, with overhang and mutated nucleotides in lowercase and underlined, respectively: Rat CYP7A1; 5′-gatcCTTTGGTCACTCAAGTTCAAGT-3′, LXRE1; 5′-agctTGAATGACCAGCAGTAACCTCAGC-3′, mutLXRE1; 5′-agctTGAATG TTCAGCAGTA TTCTCAGC-3′. A 3.5-kb ApaI fragment of the human LXRα 5′-flanking domain was cloned directly upstream of a luciferase reporter gene in a modified pGL3-Basic vector (Promega) containing an ApaI site in the polylinker. This construct, named pGL3-hLXRα-3027/463, contains bases −3027 to +463 of the human LXRα gene and was obtained by ApaI digest of bacterial artificial chromosome clone RP1117G12 (GenBankTMAC018410). This construct was modified to generate deletion and point mutants as follows. pGL3-hLXRα-2677/463 was generated by digestion of the parent construct with SacI and lacks a fragment extending from the SacI site in the polylinker upstream of the insert to position −2677 within the insert; this construct lacks LXRE1. In pGL3-hLXRα-3027/463mut, four bases within LXRE1 from the parent construct were mutated using the Transformer site-directed mutagenesis system (CLONTECH Laboratories) and the following mutation primer (mutated nucleotides underlined): 5′-CAGGGGGTGAATGTTCAGCAGTATTCTCAGCAGCTTGC-3′. The pGL3-hLXRα-3027/463-Pst deletion mutant lacks LXRE2 and LXRE3 and was generated by digestion of the parent construct with PstI to exclude a fragment from bases −2895 to −217; pGL3-hLXRα-3027/463-Pst-mut was generated by PstI digestion of the pGL3-hLXRα-3027/463mut mutant. HepG2 cells were cultured and transfected exactly as described elsewhere (33Goodwin B. Jones S.A. Price R.R. Watson M.A. McKee D.D. Moore L.B. Galardi C. Wilson J.G. Lewis M.C. Roth M.E. Maloney P.R.

All luciferase values were normalized to secreted placental alkaline phosphatase and are expressed as fold activation over the activity of the no receptor/vehicle condition for each construct. As part of a comprehensive search for LXR target genes in macrophages, we discovered that LXRα itself was up-regulated in differentiated THP-1 cells treated with the potent, synthetic LXR agonists GW3965 (32Oliver Jr., W.R.

Gene expression was also analyzed in drug-treated murine macrophage-like RAW 264.7 cells and primary peritoneal macrophages obtained from mice treated with GW3965. Whereas expression of the known LXR target genes ABCA1 and ABCG1 was substantially up-regulated by LXR agonists, little or no change was observed in LXRα expression levels (Table I). Similar results were obtained in additional tissues from drug-treated mice including liver and intestine (data not shown). In contrast, all three LXR target genes were up-regulated in primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (Table I), confirming the original results obtained with THP-1 cells. Overall, these results suggest the effect is specific to macrophages of human origin. LXRβ was not regulated by LXR agonists in any of the cells, cell lines, or tissues examined (data not shown). The genomic structure and promoter regions of the mouse LXRα and LXRβ genes have recently been examined in detail (34Alberti S. Steffensen K.R. Gustafsson J.A. Gene. 2000; 243: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). To begin dissecting the human LXRα 5′-flanking region, DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank high throughput genomic sequence data bases were queried with nucleotides corresponding to mouse Lxrα exon 1 (34Alberti S.

The recruitment and activation of PI 3-kinase by this co-receptor is presumed to occur via its interaction with phosphorylated Tyr-Xaa-Xaa-Met (Y XXM) motifs occurring in the ErbB3 C terminus. In this study, mutant ErbB3 receptor proteins expressed in COS7 cells were used to investigate PI 3-kinase-dependent signaling pathways activated by the ErbB2/ErbB3 co-receptor. We observed that a mutant ErbB3 protein with each of its six Y XXM motifs containing a Tyr → Phe substitution was unable to bind either the p85 regulatory or p110 catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase. However, restoration of a single Y XXM motif was sufficient to mediate association with the PI 3-kinase holoenzyme, although at a lower level than wild-type ErbB3. When ErbB3 Y XXM motifs were restored in pairs, evidence for cooperativity between two, those incorporating Tyr-1273 and Tyr-1286, was observed. Interestingly, we have shown that an apparent association of PI 3-kinase activity with ErbB2/Neu was due to the residual presence of ErbB3 in ErbB2 immunoprecipitates. The necessity of ErbB3 association with PI 3-kinase for downstream signaling to the effector kinase Akt was also investigated. Here, the heregulin-dependent translocation of Akt to the plasma membrane and its subsequent activation was observed in intact NIH-3T3 fibroblasts. Recruitment of PI 3-kinase to ErbB3 was required for both activities, and it appeared that ErbB2 activation alone was not sufficient to activate PI 3-kinase signaling in these cells.

Interestingly, this family of receptors can generate a wide variety of cellular signals by mixing and matching to form various co-receptor signaling complexes (1Alroy I. Yarden Y.

Of the various heterodimers and homodimers formed, the ErbB2/ErbB3 dimer constitutes a high affinity co-receptor for heregulin (5Sliwkowski M.X. Schaefer G. Akita R.W. Lofgren J.A. Fitzpatrick V.D.

One general mechanism of recruitment and activation of PI 3-kinase involves the binding of the tandem Src homology 2 (SH2) domains of its p85 regulatory subunit to phosphorylated Y XXM motifs found in signaling proteins (15McGlade C.J. Ellis C. Reedijk M. Anderson D. Mbamalu G. Reith A.D. Panayotou G. End P. Bernstein A. Kazlauskas A. Waterfield M.D. Pawson T. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1995; 270: 3662-3666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). ErbB3 is particularly well adapted to mediate PI 3-kinase signaling, because it contains in its C-terminal phosphorylation domain six such consensus p85 binding motifs (17Hellyer N.J. Kim H.-H. Greaves C.H. Sierke S.L. Koland J.G. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 165: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Two previous studies have investigated the role of these Y XXM motifs in ErbB3 signaling. One study showed that phosphopeptides containing the various ErbB3 Y XXM motifs could inhibit p85 association with ErbB3 (9Prigent S.A. Gullick W.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Additionally, we have shown via the yeast two-hybrid system that these phosphorylated motifs can directly associate with the SH2 domains of p85 (18Hellyer N.J. Cheng K. Koland J.G. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 757-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether ErbB3 Y XXM motifs are solely responsible for the activation of PI 3-kinase by the ErbB2/ErbB3 co-receptor complex (18Hellyer N.J. Cheng K. Koland J.G. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 757-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). ErbB2/Neu has also been observed to associate with PI 3-kinase (8Carraway III, K.L. Soltoff S.P. Diamonti A.J. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7111-7116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 11Ram T.G. Ethier S.P. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 551-561PubMed Google Scholar,19Sepp-Lorenzino L.

Chem. 1992; 267: 12266-12274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, ErbB2 monoclonal antibodies inhibit heregulin-dependent activation of PI 3-kinase and its downstream target, Akt, in certain breast cancer cell lines (21Liu W. Li J. Roth R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 897-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). It is hypothesized that a Y XXM motif occurring in the ErbB2 protein-tyrosine kinase domain could mediate a direct interaction with PI 3-kinase (11Ram T.G. Ethier S.P. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 551-561PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the mechanism by which ErbB2 and ErbB3 activate PI 3-kinase is likely to be complex. Additionally, growth factor-mediated activation of PI 3-kinase has been observed to involve multiple events: p85 association with phosphorylated tyrosine residues, membrane localization, and Ras association with the p110 catalytic subunit (16Rordorf-Nikolic T.

Biol. 1996; 16: 5905-5914Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The actions of other signaling proteins, such as RasGAP and phospholipase Cγ, may negatively affect PI 3-kinase activity as in the case of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-dependent signaling (24Klinghoffer R.A. Duckworth B. Valius M. Cantley L. Kazlauskas A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5905-5914Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), Drosophila insulin receptor, PDGF receptor, and hepatocyte growth factor receptor are additional examples of signaling proteins that, like ErbB3, contain multiple Y XXM motifs. IRS-1 has been shown to become phosphorylated by the insulin receptor and subsequently associate with and activate PI 3-kinase (25Sun X.J. Rothenberg P. Kahn C.R. Backer J.M. Araki E. Wilden P.A.

Several in vitro studies have examined the association of p85 with IRS-1-derived phosphotyrosyl peptides containing Y XXM motifs. The high affinity association of p85 with IRS-1 Y XXM phosphopeptides was observed to depend on the specific Y XXM sequence order, because random shuffling of the tyrosine and methionine residues did not allow for phosphopeptide association (27Shoelson S.E. Chatterjee S. Chaudhuri M. White M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2027-2031Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 28Piccione E. Case R.D. Domchek S.M. Hu P. Chaudhuri M. Backer J.M. Schlessinger J. Shoelson S.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3197-3202Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Additionally, the phosphorylated IRS-1 Y XXM motifs regulated a conformational change in the SH2 domains of p85 that was associated with increased PI 3-kinase activity (29Shoelson S.E. Sivaraja M. Williams K.P. Hu P. Schlessinger J. Weiss M.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 795-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in vitrophosphopeptide studies suggested cooperation between the multiple IRS-1 Y XXM motifs. Bisphosphorylated Y XXM peptides had a significantly increased affinity for tandem p85 SH2 domains as compared with monophosphorylated peptides (30Ottinger E.A. Botfield M.C. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 729-735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Also, IRS-1 bisphosphorylated peptides elicited a 2-fold higher activation of PI 3-kinase activity relative to monophosphorylated peptides (16Rordorf-Nikolic T. Van Horn D.J. Chen D. White M.F. Backer J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3662-3666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The Drosophila insulin receptor protein contains three Y XXM motifs, whereas the human IR contains only one (31Ruan Y. Chen C. Cao Y. Garofalo R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4236-4243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Therefore, the signaling capabilities of these receptors have been previously compared. However, from these comparative studies, it has not become clear as to how the additional Y XXM motifs in Drosophila insulin receptor contribute to signaling by this receptor (32Yamaguchi T. Fernandez R. Roth R.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4962-4968Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 33Yenush L. Fernandez R. Myers Jr., M.G. Grammer T.C. Sun X.J. Blenis J. Pierce J.H. Schlessinger J. White M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2509-2517Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The SH2 domains of p85 have been shown to be required for the association of PI 3-kinase with PDGF receptor (15McGlade C.J. Ellis C. Reedijk M. Anderson D. Mbamalu G. Reith A.D. Panayotou G. End P. Bernstein A. Kazlauskas A. Waterfield M.D. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 991-997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two tyrosines occurring in the PDGF receptor, Tyr-740 and Tyr-751, are in the context of Y XXM motifs. To investigate the ability of these sites to associate with PI 3-kinase, a mutant PDGF receptor with phenylalanine substitutions at Tyr-740 and Tyr-751 was generated. It was observed that the PDGF receptor Y740F-Y751F mutant was unable to associate with PI 3-kinase (34Kazlauskas A. Kashishian A. Cooper J.A. Valius M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2534-2544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, when the tyrosine residues were individually restored as single add-back mutants, the PDGF receptor Tyr-740 and Tyr-751 mutants were able to bind PI 3-kinase activity only 3% or 23%, respectively, of that bound by the wild-type receptor. These results suggested that both the Tyr-740 and Tyr-751 sites were required for PI 3-kinase to maximally associate with the PDGF receptor. Dual phosphorylation sites also appear to be critical for hepatocyte growth factor receptor interaction with PI 3-kinase (35Ponzetto C. Bardelli A. Maina F. Longati P. Panayotou G. Dhand R.

The PI 3-kinase-dependent generation of PtdIns 3,4-bisphosphate and PtdIns 3,4,5-trisphosphate has been shown in several systems to result in the translocation of the Ser/Thr kinase Akt to the plasma membrane, where it is activated via its phosphorylation by PtdIns phosphate-dependent protein kinases (PDKs) (36Hemmings B.A. Science. 1997; 275: 628-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 37Downward J.

Phosphorylation on Thr-308 and Ser-473 is critical for the activation of the protein Ser/Thr kinase activity of Akt. Interestingly, PDK1 and PDK2 also bind PtdIns 3,4,5-trisphosphate and are postulated to translocate to the plasma membrane (37Downward J. Science. 1998; 279: 673-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Because of its high degree of regulation by d-3-phosphorylated PtdIns species, the activation of Akt provides an excellent indication of the production of PI 3-kinase products in the cell. Indeed, by fusion of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) module to PHAkt, the translocation of PHAkt to the plasma membrane can be observed in live cells by fluorescence microscopy (50Kontos C.D.

Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 929-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Given this background, we posed several questions about the mechanism of heregulin-dependent PI 3-kinase activation via ErbB2 and ErbB3 Y XXM motifs. First, is a single Y XXM motif necessary and sufficient to mediate PI 3-kinase association with the ErbB2/ErbB3 co-receptor? Second, which of these various Y XXM motifs can interact with PI 3-kinase? Third, can two or more of the six ErbB3 Y XXM motifs cooperate in PI 3-kinase binding and activation as in the case of the PDGF receptor? We also sought to determine whether a proline-rich sequence in the C terminus of ErbB3 that potentially binds the SH3 domain of p85 (18Hellyer N.J. Cheng K. Koland J.G. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 757-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) participates in PI 3-kinase activation. To address these questions about the PI 3-kinase activation mechanism, ErbB2 and ErbB3 receptors with specific amino acid substitutions were generated by site-directed mutagenesis and transiently expressed in COS7 cells. NIH-3T3 cells lines stably expressing wild-type and mutant receptors were also employed in investigations of downstream signaling by PI 3-kinase. Here, we examined the heregulin-dependent activation of the PI 3-kinase target, Akt, and the production of PI 3-kinase products in intact cells. The following were purchased from the indicated suppliers: Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM), protein G-agarose, trypsin, fetal bovine serum, LipofectAMINE, and gentamicin were from Life Technologies, Inc.; ErbB2 antibody and Ab-1 were from Calbiochem; horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse Ig were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; Shc antibody was from Transduction Labs; phospho-Akt (473), p85 (06–195), and p110 antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.; [γ-32P]ATP was from NEN Life Sciences; heregulin-β1 and ErbB3 antibody 2F12 were from NeoMarkers; immobilized Akt antibody, GSK3α fusion protein, and phospho-GSK3α antibody were from New England Biolabs; and phosphotyrosine and Akt antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. The rat ErbB3 expression plasmid, pcDNA3-B3, has been described previously (17Hellyer N.J. Kim H.-H. Greaves C.H. Sierke S.L. Koland J.G. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 165: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The rat ErbB2/Neu expression plasmid, pcDNA3-B2, was constructed by cloning the rat ErbB2 cDNA, a generous gift of Dr. Robert Weinberg (Whitehead Institute, Cambridge, MA), into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). Mutant receptor cDNAs were generated by Ex-Site polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis (Stratagene). A codon corresponding to Tyr-952 in the ErbB2 cDNA sequence was mutated to phenylalanine to generate the ErbB2–952F cDNA by using pcDNA3-B2 as a template. Seven codons corresponding to the loss of amino acids 1205–1211 (PPRPPRP) were deleted from pcDNA3-B3 to generate the ErbB3ΔPro cDNA. The ErbB3-6F cDNA was constructed with pcDNA3-B3 as a template by six sequential rounds of polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis by which each codon corresponding to Tyr-1051, Tyr-1194, Tyr-1219, Tyr-1257, Tyr-1273, and Tyr-1286 was substituted with a phenylalanine codon. ErbB3-1051Y, ErbB3-1194Y, ErbB3-1219Y, ErbB3-1257Y, ErbB3-1273Y, or ErbB3-1286Y add-back mutant cDNAs were generated with the ErbB3-6F cDNA as a template. Each of the sequences altered by Ex-Site mutagenesis were subcloned into the parent expression vector and sequenced to verify that the desired mutation was incorporated without the introduction of additional sequence alterations. COS7 cells were purchased from and maintained as recommended by the American Type Culture Collection. COS7 cells were transiently transfected using specific combinations of expression plasmids as indicated by electroporation at 210 volts in serum-free DMEM with a Cell-Porator (Life Technologies, Inc.). Electroporated cells were subsequently plated on 100-mm dishes in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.01% gentamicin. Twenty-four hours after plating, the cells were washed in DMEM and serum-starved in DMEM supplemented with 0.1% fetal bovine serum for an additional 24 h before heregulin stimulation. COS7 cells were washed with DMEM and subsequently stimulated with 1 nm heregulin in DMEM for 20 min at 37 °C. The cells were washed with PBS and immediately lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mmTris/HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mmsodium fluoride, 2 mm EDTA, 3 mm EGTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4). The cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C before immunoprecipitation or Western blotting. The lysates were incubated with ErbB2 or ErbB3 antibody as indicated for 1 h at 4 °C. Each antibody-lysate mixture was added to 200 μl of protein G-agarose (1:6 suspension) and rocked for 1 h. The protein G-agarose slurry was washed three times in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer. 0.5 ml of the agarose slurry was used for Western blotting, and the remaining 0.5 ml was used for PI 3-kinase analysis. For PI 3-kinase assays (52White M.F. Backer J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 65-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), the immunoprecipitate was additionally washed two times with buffer 2 (100 mm Tris/HCl, 5 mm LiCl, 100 μm sodium vanadate, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pryrophosphate, and 2 mm dichloroacetic acid, pH 7.4), washed two times with buffer 3 (10 mm Tris/HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 100 μm sodium vanadate, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pryrophosphate, and 2 mm dichloroacetic acid, pH 7.4), and resuspended in 65 μl of 10 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4) containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 4 mm MgCl2, 2.3 mg/ml phosphotidylserine, and 1.5 mg/ml phosphotidylinositol. The reaction was initiated by adding 10 μl of 100 μm ATP containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol), 10 mmMgCl2, 200 μm adenine, and 45 mmHEPES/Na (pH 7.8). The reaction was stopped by adding 20 μl of 8n hydrochloric acid. Lipids were extracted with 150 μl of methanol/chloroform (1:1), and 50 μl of the extract was resolved on potassium oxalate-coated silica thin layer chromatography plates with chloroform/methanol/water/ammonium hydroxide (60:47:11:2) as the solvent. The phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate products were detected by autoradiography, scraped from plates, and quantified by liquid scintillation counting or detected and quantified with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Cell lysate samples and immunoprecipitates were resuspended in gel sample buffer, resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to Immobilon membranes (Millipore). Membranes were blocked for 1 h in 5% (w/v) dry milk, PBS, and 0.1% Tween 20. Primary antibodies as indicated were incubated with membranes for 1 h, and the membranes were washed in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20. Subsequently, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were added for 1 h, and the membranes were washed in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20. Super Signal (Pierce) enhanced chemiluminescence reagent was used to detect membrane-bound protein by luminography. NIH-3T3 cells expressing ErbB3 receptors were stimulated with 5 nm heregulin in DMEM for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were washed with PBS and immediately lysed in Triton X-100 lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 20 mmTris/HCl, 150 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmEGTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm β-glycerolphosphate, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4). The cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × gfor 5 min at 4 °C before immunoprecipitation. The lysates were incubated with immobilized Akt antibody for 1 h. The immunoprecipitates were washed and incubated in kinase buffer containing a GSK-3α fusion protein, 25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm magnesium chloride, and 200 μm ATP. The mixture was resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to Immobilon. GSK-3 phosphorylation was detected using phospho-GSK3 antibody via Western blotting and enhanced chemiluminescence. An RNA expression vector encoding a GFP-Akt-PH domain fusion protein (GFP-PHAkt) has previously been described by Kontos et al. (50Kontos C.D. Stauffer T.P. Yang W.-P. York J.D. Huang L. Blanar M.A. Meyer T. Peter K.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4131-4140Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding GFP-PHAkt was subcloned from this vector into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3. NIH-3T3 cells lines expressing ErbB3 receptors were plated in chamber slides (Lab-Tek) and transfected with pcDNA3-GFP-PHAkt via the LipofectAMINE transfection method. Twenty-four hours after transfection, GFP-PHAktdistribution in cells was visualized at 100× magnification by confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscopy (Zeiss 510). The cells were then stimulated with 5 nm heregulin for 10 min, and the original cell field was again visualized. ErbB3 Y XXM motifs have previously been shown by phosphopeptide competition assays (9Prigent S.A. Gullick W.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) and yeast two-hybrid system analysis (18Hellyer N.J. Cheng K. Koland J.G. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 757-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) to be critical for ErbB3 association with p85. In this study, the association of p85 and PI 3-kinase activity with ErbB3 Y XXM motifs in the context of intact cultured cells was examined by site-directed mutagenesis. Six consensus binding motifs for p85 occurring in the C terminus of ErbB3 were mutated from Tyr-Xaa-Xaa-Met (Y XXM) to Phe-Xaa-Xaa-Met (F XXM) by mutagenesis of the corresponding cDNA sequence to generate the ErbB3-6F expression plasmid. Previously, we had detected an in vitro interaction between ErbB3 and the SH3 domain of p85, which we suspected to be dependent on a proline-rich consensus binding motif (PPRPPRP) occurring in the ErbB3 C terminus (18Hellyer N.J. Cheng K. Koland J.G. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 757-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Therefore, we also deleted the ErbB3 cDNA sequence encoding the amino acid sequence PPRPPRP to generate an ErbB3ΔPro expression plasmid. We transiently expressed ErbB3-WT, ErbB3-6F, and ErbB3ΔPro together with ErbB2 in COS7 cells and examined the ability of these receptors to associate with PI 3-kinase upon stimulation by heregulin. Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that ErbB3-WT showed heregulin-dependent association with p85 (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, ErbB3-6F associated negligibly with p85 as compared with the wild-type receptor (Fig. 1 B), although expression of both receptors was comparable (Fig. 1 A). Examination of the relative phosphorylation levels of the receptors showed a heregulin-dependent enhancement in phosphorylation of both ErbB3-WT and ErbB3-6F (Fig. 1 B). Thus, it appeared that the wild-type and mutant receptors were functionally expressed at the cell surface and that some of the six remaining tyrosine residues occurring in the C terminus of ErbB3-6F were subject to phosphorylation.

In response to extracellular stimuli, MAPK becomes activated and translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. At least two pathways for the nuclear import of MAPK are shown to exist; passive diffusion of a monomer and Ran-dependent active transport of a dimer, the detailed molecular mechanism of which is unknown. In this study, we have reconstituted nuclear import of MAPK in vitro by using digitonin-permeabilized cells with GFP-fused MAPK protein (GFP-MAPK), which is too large to pass through the nuclear pore by passive diffusion. GFP-MAPK was able to accumulate in the nucleus irrespective of its phosphorylation state. This import of GFP-MAPK occurred even in the absence of any soluble cytosolic factors or ATP but was inhibited by wheat germ agglutinin or an excess amount of importin-β or at low temperatures. Moreover, MAPK directly bound to an FG repeat region of nucleoporin CAN/Nup214 in vitro.

We have previously shown that the cytoplasmic localization of MAPKK is achieved by its nuclear export signal at the N terminus (17Fukuda M. Gotoh I. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20024-20028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Moreover, the cytoplasmic localization of MAPK is achieved by its specific binding to MAPKK, and nuclear translocation of MAPK accompanies the dissociation of the MAPKK·MAPK complex (18Fukuda M. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1901-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of MAPK by MAPKK is necessary and sufficient for the dissociation of MAPK from MAPKK (19Adachi M. Fukuda M. Nishida E.

Atkinson M. Goldsmith E. Cobb M.H. Cell. 1998; 93: 605-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that phosphorylation of MAPK promotes its dimerization and nuclear translocation. There are at least two pathways for the nuclear import of MAPK, passive diffusion of a monomer and active transport of a dimer (19Adachi M. Fukuda M. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5347-5358Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). RanQ69L, a dominant negative mutant of low molecular weight GTPase Ran, inhibits the active transport of MAPK, suggesting the involvement of an importin-β family protein(s) in the active transport of MAPK (19Adachi M. Fukuda M. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5347-5358Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar).In this study, we have analyzed nuclear translocation of MAPK in an in vitro assay system using digitonin-permeabilized cells (21Adam S.A. Sterne-Marr R. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). Digitonin-permeabilized cells have proven to be a powerful system for analysis of nuclear translocation of proteins (21–32, for review, see Refs. 33Nigg E.A. Nature. 1997; 386: 779-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar, 34Mattaj I.W. Englmeier L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 265-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar, 35Gorlich D.

In this system, soluble cytosolic components can be easily manipulated, and nuclear translocation can be reconstituted in vitro using exogenous substrates. We incubated permeabilized cells with recombinant MAPK protein that is fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) and analyzed its nuclear translocation. Our results have revealed a novel pathway for nuclear translocation of MAPK, in which MAPK passes through the nuclear pore by directly interacting with the nuclear pore complex independent of cytosolic factors such as importin-β family protein and Ran.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we succeeded in reconstituting the nuclear transport of MAPK using GFP-MAPK and the digitonin-permeabilized cell system. Our experiments identified a novel pathway for nuclear translocation of MAPK, i.e. MAPK can be imported into the nucleus through direct interaction with the NPC (Fig. 4 C). This novel pathway for nuclear import of MAPK is distinct from passive diffusion of a MAPK monomer or active transport of a dimer. GFP-MAPK (∼70 kDa) is too large to pass through the nuclear pore by passive diffusion, and our data indicate that GFP-MAPK is imported into the nucleus by an NPC-mediated but cytosol- or ATP-independent mechanism. Moreover, MAPK is able to interact with an FG repeat-containing fragment of nucleoporin CAN/Nup214, suggesting that MAPK binds to the NPC, although it is not known whether CAN/Nup214 is an in vivo docking site for MAPK. Thus, MAPK seems to dock directly to the nuclear pore complex and pass through the nuclear pore by interacting with nucleoporins. This conclusion is in good agreement with the observation that the overexpression of GFP-MAPK results in its nuclear accumulation (Fig. 1 C and Ref. 55Rubinfeld H.R. Hanoch T. Seger R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30349-30352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar).It has been demonstrated that not only MAPK but also several other proteins are able to translocate to the nucleus independently of cytosolic factors. Those proteins include importin-β, HIV-1 Vpr, β-catenin, and RCC1 (42Kose S. Imamoto N. Tachibana T. Shimamoto T. Yoneda Y. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 841-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 48Fagotto F. Gluck U. Gumbiner B.M. Curr.

Weis K. Greene W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 875-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). It will be of interest as to whether these proteins use the same mechanism to pass through the nuclear pore. The fact that the import of GFP-MAPK was inhibited by importin-β suggests that MAPK binds to the same nucleoporins as does importin-β, or the access of MAPK to the NPC is sterically blocked by importin-β. The identification of MAPK-binding proteins in the NPC is among the key questions to be elucidated. In any case, this mechanism may be identical or similar to the so-called facilitated diffusion mechanism that requires specific, low affinity interactions with nucleoporins (37Talcott B. Moore M.S. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 312-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 50Nemergut M.E. Macara I.G. J.

The result that GFP-MAPK can be exported from the nucleus is consistent with the model of facilitated diffusion. This sort of nuclear translocation occurs under conditions of minimal energy and is believed to be propelled by Brownian motion, which is dependent on temperature.Although facilitated diffusion cannot occur against a concentration gradient, GFP-MAPK is able to become concentrated in the nucleus in our experiments. It is probable that GFP-MAPK is anchored in the nucleus. Concerning the nuclear anchor for MAPK, it could be worth mentioning the previous work of Lenormand et al. (54Lenormand P. Brondello J.M. Brunet A. Pouyssegur J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 625-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). They have reported that the nuclear translocation of MAPK requires neosynthesis of short-lived proteins, serving as nuclear anchors for MAPK. The identification of nuclear anchor proteins would be of great help to elucidate the mechanism of nuclear accumulation of MAPK.

In this system, soluble cytosolic components can be easily manipulated, and nuclear translocation can be reconstituted in vitro using exogenous substrates. We incubated permeabilized cells with recombinant MAPK protein that is fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) and analyzed its nuclear translocation. Our results have revealed a novel pathway for nuclear translocation of MAPK, in which MAPK passes through the nuclear pore by directly interacting with the nuclear pore complex independent of cytosolic factors such as importin-β family protein and Ran. DISCUSSIONIn this study, we succeeded in reconstituting the nuclear transport of MAPK using GFP-MAPK and the digitonin-permeabilized cell system. Our experiments identified a novel pathway for nuclear translocation of MAPK, i.e. MAPK can be imported into the nucleus through direct interaction with the NPC (Fig. 4 C). This novel pathway for nuclear import of MAPK is distinct from passive diffusion of a MAPK monomer or active transport of a dimer. GFP-MAPK (∼70 kDa) is too large to pass through the nuclear pore by passive diffusion, and our data indicate that GFP-MAPK is imported into the nucleus by an NPC-mediated but cytosol- or ATP-independent mechanism. Moreover, MAPK is able to interact with an FG repeat-containing fragment of nucleoporin CAN/Nup214, suggesting that MAPK binds to the NPC, although it is not known whether CAN/Nup214 is an in vivo docking site for MAPK. Thus, MAPK seems to dock directly to the nuclear pore complex and pass through the nuclear pore by interacting with nucleoporins. This conclusion is in good agreement with the observation that the overexpression of GFP-MAPK results in its nuclear accumulation (Fig. 1 C and Ref. 55Rubinfeld H.R. Hanoch T. Seger R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30349-30352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar).It has been demonstrated that not only MAPK but also several other proteins are able to translocate to the nucleus independently of cytosolic factors. Those proteins include importin-β, HIV-1 Vpr, β-catenin, and RCC1 (42Kose S. Imamoto N. Tachibana T. Shimamoto T. Yoneda Y. J.

It will be of interest as to whether these proteins use the same mechanism to pass through the nuclear pore. The fact that the import of GFP-MAPK was inhibited by importin-β suggests that MAPK binds to the same nucleoporins as does importin-β, or the access of MAPK to the NPC is sterically blocked by importin-β. The identification of MAPK-binding proteins in the NPC is among the key questions to be elucidated. In any case, this mechanism may be identical or similar to the so-called facilitated diffusion mechanism that requires specific, low affinity interactions with nucleoporins (37Talcott B. Moore M.S.

The result that GFP-MAPK can be exported from the nucleus is consistent with the model of facilitated diffusion. This sort of nuclear translocation occurs under conditions of minimal energy and is believed to be propelled by Brownian motion, which is dependent on temperature.Although facilitated diffusion cannot occur against a concentration gradient, GFP-MAPK is able to become concentrated in the nucleus in our experiments. It is probable that GFP-MAPK is anchored in the nucleus. Concerning the nuclear anchor for MAPK, it could be worth mentioning the previous work of Lenormand et al. (54Lenormand P. Brondello J.M. Brunet A. Pouyssegur J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 625-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). They have reported that the nuclear translocation of MAPK requires neosynthesis of short-lived proteins, serving as nuclear anchors for MAPK.

YvrK and the related hypothetical proteins YoaN and YxaG from B. subtilis have been successfully overexpressed in Escherichia coli. Recombinant YvrK and YoaN were found to be soluble enzymes with oxalate decarboxylase activity only when expressed in the presence of manganese salts. No enzyme activity has yet been detected for YxaG, which was expressed as a soluble protein without the requirement for manganese salts. YvrK and YoaN were found to catalyze minor side reactions: oxalate oxidation to produce H2O2; and oxalate-dependent, H2O2-independent dye oxidations. The oxalate decarboxylase activity of purified YvrK was O2-dependent. YvrK was found to contain between 0.86 and 1.14 atoms of manganese/subunit. EPR spectroscopy showed that the metal ion was predominantly but not exclusively in the Mn(II) oxidation state. The hyperfine coupling constant (A = 9.5 millitesla) of the main g = 2 signal was consistent with oxygen and nitrogen ligands with hexacoordinate geometry. The structure of YvrK was modeled on the basis of homology with oxalate oxidase, canavalin, and phaseolin, and its hexameric oligomerization was predicted by analogy with proglycinin and homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase. Although YvrK possesses two potential active sites, only one could be fully occupied by manganese. The possibility that the C-terminal domain active site has no manganese bound and is buried in an intersubunit interface within the hexameric enzyme is discussed. A mechanism for oxalate decarboxylation is proposed, in which both Mn(II) and O2are cofactors that act together as a two-electron sink during catalysis.

Evans C.S. Can. J. Microbiol. 1996; 42: 881-895Crossref Scopus (505) Google Scholar). The enzyme has been detected in a number of fungi (1Dutton M.V. Evans C.S. Can. J. Microbiol. 1996; 42: 881-895Crossref Scopus (505) Google Scholar), including Agaricus bisporus (2Kathiara M. Wood D.A. Evans C.S. Mycol. Res. 2000; 104: 345-350Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar), as well as in guinea pig liver (3Murthy M.S.R. Talwar H.S. Nath R. Thind S.K. IRCS Med. Sci. Biochem. 1981; 9: 683-684Google Scholar). The secretion of oxalate by fungi appears to have several functions including pathogenesis, competition, controlling the availability of environmental nutrients, the detoxification of copper compounds, and lignocellulose degradation (1Dutton M.V. Evans C.S. Can. J. Microbiol. 1996; 42: 881-895Crossref Scopus (505) Google Scholar). The fungal oxalate decarboxylases are induced by oxalate and are thought to control excess oxalate concentrations. Oxalate decarboxylases have been used in the clinical assay of oxalate and could be used to decrease toxic oxalate levels in foods and in the environment (4Dunwell J.M. Khuri S. Gane P.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 153-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Recently, the enzyme has been shown to confer fungal disease resistance when expressed in plants (5Kesarwani M. Azam M. Natarajan K. Mehta A. Datta A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7230-7238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), presumably through the degradation of the oxalate produced by pathogenic fungi to suppress the plant oxidative burst (6Cessna S.G. Sears V.E. Dickman M.B. Low P.S. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 2191-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). We recently identified the first bacterial example of an oxalate decarboxylase from Bacillus subtilis (7Tanner A. Bornemann S. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5271-5273Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This bacterial enzyme, previously known as the hypothetical protein YvrK, is induced by acid pH and not by oxalate. Although its physiological function is not yet clear, it may be involved in the elevation of cytoplasmic pH, because the reaction involves the net consumption of a proton. Oxalate decarboxylases belong to a large superfamily of proteins called cupins (8Dunwell J.M. Biotechnol. Genet. Eng. Rev. 1998; 15: 1-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 9Dunwell J.M. Gane P.J. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 46: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). They share conserved motifs, most recently defined as GX5HXHX3,4EX6G and GX5PXGX2HX3N (10Khuri S. Bakker F.T. Dunwell J.M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2001; 18: 593-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), and are predicted to share a conserved β-barrel fold (cupa is the Latin for small barrel). The three known sequences of verified oxalate decarboxylases are from Flammulina velutipes (formerly Collybia velutipes), Aspergillus phoenices, and B. subtilis (Fig. 1). The only other known closely related homologues are from Streptococcus mutans and Synechocystis sp., together with another hypothetical protein in B. subtilis, YoaN (4Dunwell J.M. Khuri S. Gane P.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 153-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The oxalate decarboxylases belong to the bicupin subset of the cupin superfamily. The conserved motifs appear twice in their primary sequence, presumably arising from a gene duplication event during their evolution (9Dunwell J.M. Gane P.J. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 46: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of the bicupin seed storage proteins, canavalin, phaseolin, and proglycinin, clearly show domain duplication within each subunit (11Ko T.P. Ng J.D. McPherson A. Plant Physiol. 1993; 101: 729-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 12Lawrence M.C. Izard T. Beuchat M. Blagrove R.J. Colman P.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 748-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 13Adachi M. Takenaka Y. Gidamis A.B. Mikami B. Utsumi S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 291-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). An additional hypothetical bicupin protein in B. subtilis, YxaG, does not cluster with the oxalate decarboxylases in phylogenetic analyses (4Dunwell J.M. Khuri S. Gane P.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 153-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Either Schiff bases, formed between substrates and either lysine residues or pyridoxal phosphate, or thiamine diphosphate is normally utilized as the electron sink in the decarboxylation of 2-oxo acids. For example, oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase requires thiamine diphosphate for activity (14Baetz A.L. Allison M.J. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 2605-2608Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the thioester of oxalate is susceptible to nucleophilic attack by the thiazolium ylide of this cofactor, the dicarboxylate form of oxalate is not. Oxalate decarboxylases would therefore be expected to use a different cofactor(s). Unlike many other decarboxylases, they do not possess broad substrate specificity and are extremely specific for oxalate (1Dutton M.V. Evans C.S. Can. J. Microbiol. 1996; 42: 881-895Crossref Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Most importantly and intriguingly, the fungal enzymes require O2 for activity despite the reaction involving no net redox change (1Dutton M.V. Evans C.S. Can. J. Microbiol. 1996; 42: 881-895Crossref Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 7Tanner A. Bornemann S. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5271-5273Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). No details about the cofactor requirement of oxalate decarboxylases have previously been reported. The O2 dependence of oxalate decarboxylases indicates the involvement of a flavin, pterin, or metal ion in catalysis. The lack of any obvious chromophore suggests that neither flavin nor pterin is protein-bound (7Tanner A. Bornemann S. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5271-5273Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Many members of the cupin superfamily are known to require divalent metal ions for activity. One of the best characterized is oxalate oxidase from cereal crops (also known as germin), which converts oxalic acid and O2 to CO2 and H2O2. It is now known to bind mononuclear manganese predominantly in the Mn(II) oxidation state, utilizing the Glu and three His residues of the conserved cupin motifs together with two waters in a distorted octahedral coordination environment (Fig. 2) (15Requena L. Bornemann S. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 185-190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Woo E.J. Dunwell J.M. Goodenough P.W. Marvier A.C. Pickersgill R.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1036-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). After manganese was identified in oxalate oxidase, two germin-like cupins with manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase activity were reported (17Carter C. Thornburg R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36726-36733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 18Yamahara T. Shiono T. Suzuki T. Tanaka K. Takio S. Sato K. Yamazaki S. Satoh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33274-33278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). These enzymes share no sequence homology with the well known mitochondrial Mn-superoxide dismutases that are isolated in the Mn(III) oxidation state. Although one group has reported that germin possesses superoxide dismutase as well as oxalate oxidase activity (16Woo E.J. Dunwell J.M. Goodenough P.W. Marvier A.C. Pickersgill R.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1036-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), this finding remains to be confirmed by others. Other germin-like proteins have recently been identified as having nucleotide-sugar pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase activities (19Rodriguez-Lopez M. Baroja-Fernandez E. Zandueta-Criado A. Moreno-Bruna B. Munoz F.J. Akazawa T. Pozueta-Romero J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 44-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Although these enzymes could conceivably require a metal ion cofactor for activity, no analysis of this has yet been published. The other cupins that are known to require metal ions for activity include the Fe(II)-dependent cysteine (20Yamaguchi K. Hosokawa Y. Kohashi N. Kori Y. Sakakibara S. Ueda I. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1978; 83: 479-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), 3-hydroxyanthranilate 3,4- (21Ogasawara N. Gander J.E. Henderson L.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 8332-8336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), gentisate 1,2- (23Harpel M.R. Lipscomb J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22187-22196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenases (24Titus G.P. Mueller H.A. Burgner J. de Cordoba S.R. Penalva M.A. Timm D.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 542-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), and the Zn2+-dependent phosphomannose isomerase (25Papoutsopoulou S.V. Kyriakidis D.A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 177: 183-191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cupin motifs of both the N- and C-terminal domains of YvrK, YoaN, and YxaG contain the Glu and three His residues known to ligate a Mn(II) ion in oxalate oxidase (Fig. 2). This duplication of the cupin motifs indicates the potential for two active sites per subunit. Importantly, the motifs of all of the Fe(II)-dependent dioxygenases differ from the consensus such that only three of the four residues highlighted above are conserved. Overall, it would therefore seem likely that manganese may function as a cofactor in the oxalate decarboxylase reaction. The aim of this work was to overexpress B. subtilis YvrK, YoaN, and YxaG, to determine whether YoaN and YxaG were also oxalate decarboxylases, to identify the cofactor(s) required for activity, and to establish whether one or both of the potential active sites of each subunit are functional. All chemicals and biochemicals were of the highest grade available and, unless stated otherwise, were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Sodium dithionite was purchased from BDH Laboratory Supplies (Poole, Dorset, UK). Metal analysis was provided by Southern Science Laboratories (Lewes, Sussex, UK) using inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy of acid-digested samples. The metal content is quoted after the subtraction of control values obtained with buffer alone. UV-visible spectra and time courses were obtained using Hewlett-Packard HP8452A and Shimadzu MPS-2000 spectrophotometers, respectively, with path lengths of 1 cm. Protein was determined using the Bio-Rad dye-binding protein assay unless indicated otherwise. Purified YvrK concentration was determined using ε278 = 58,800 m−1cm−1/subunit (26Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5034) Google Scholar). Values obtained using this method (relative value = 1.0) were only slightly lower than those obtained with the Bio-Rad protein assay (1.2) and the Pierce Micro bicinchoninic acid protein assay (1.1) using a protein molecular weight of 43,566 predicted from the primary sequence. The PhastSystem (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with 8–25% PhastGels was used for nondenaturing and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with Coomassie staining. Jack bean urease (545 and 272 kDa) and bovine serum albumin (132 and 66 kDa) were used to calibrate nondenaturing gels. B. subtilis 168, Escherichia coli DH5α, and E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells were grown on Luria-Bertani medium (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Carbenicillin (125 μg ml−1), kanamycin (50 μg ml−1), or chloramphenicol (100 μg ml−1) was added as required. The open reading frames and associated ribosome binding sites of B. subtilis 168 yvrK(GenBank™ accession no. 2832786), yoaN (GenBank™ accession no. 2618993), and yxaG (GenBank™ accession no. 2280496) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using genomic DNA (28Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1. John Wiley & Sons, New York1994Google Scholar) with the following oligonucleotides (shown 5′-3′): yvrK, 5′-GCAGCAGTTTACGTTTTATCGG and 3′-GCTTGCTTCCGTCTATCAAGG; yoaN,5′-CCTAGGCACAGCAATCTAAGATTCTGCATAG and 3′-GGATTTAATAAAACACAGGCCAAAATTCA; yxaG,5′-TAGACTGGTCTAAATTGGAGGAAGC and 3′-TGAAGCGCGGTAACATCGATTTAGG. The polymerase chain reaction products containing yvrKand yoaN were digested with PstI and HindIII, either directly or after cloning into the Invitrogen pCR®-Blunt II-TOPO® plasmid, and inserted into the corresponding sites of the expression plasmid pT7.5 (29Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2452) Google Scholar) to give the plasmids pAT1 and pLB4, respectively. The yxaG-containing polymerase chain reaction product was digested with ClaI and inserted into pT7.5 that was digested with ClaI and SmaI to give pLB2. The resulting plasmids were used to transform CaCl2-competent (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar)E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells. DNA sequencing confirmed that the sequences of yvrK and yoaN were identical to those in the data base. However, the sequence of yxaGdiffered from that in the data base such that the codon for Thr160, ACA, was found to be GCA, which codes for Ala. This residue is highly variable among cupins and bicupins and, by analogy with canavalin and phaseolin, is in the interdomain link. The cells transformed with pAT1 were grown at 37 °C in shake flasks at 200 rpm. When the cultures reached A600 of 0.3, they were heat-shocked at 42 °C for 2 min before the addition of 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and 5 mmMnCl2 to the culture medium. The cells were harvested after 4 h of shaking by centrifugation (6,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C), frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Cells transformed with pLB4 and pLB2 were treated in the same way except that expression was induced with 0.4 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and cells were harvested after 12 h of shaking at 20 °C. Furthermore, the heat shock and the addition of MnCl2 were not necessary for the expression of soluble YxaG. Recombinant YvrK was purified using a method based on that used for the wild-type protein (7Tanner A. Bornemann S. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5271-5273Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) but with modifications. All buffers used during the purification contained 10% glycerol and 10 μm MnCl2 unless indicated otherwise. Thawed cells were broken with two passes through a French pressure cell in the presence of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and DNase I. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation (28,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C). The crude extract was applied to a DEAE-Sepharose FastFlow column (80-ml bed volume; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that was previously equilibrated with 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0. The decarboxylase was eluted with a 0–1m NaCl gradient in pH 8.0 Tris buffer at 400 mmsalt. The enzyme was dialyzed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, and applied to an FPLC Mono Q HR10/10 column that was previously equilibrated with pH 7.0 Tris buffer. It was eluted with a 0–1m NaCl gradient in pH 7.0 Tris buffer at 250 mmsalt. The enzyme was precipitated with 95% ammonium sulfate and redissolved in the minimum volume of pH 7.0 Tris buffer containing 100 mm NaCl and 10 mm dithiothreitol but no MnCl2. It was applied to a Sephadex 200 HR26/60 column and eluted with the same buffer without dithiothreitol. The column was calibrated using Sigma Gel Filtration Molecular Weight Markers with thyroglobulin used to determine the void volume. The purified enzyme was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Thawed samples could be concentrated using ammonium sulfate precipitation as described above. One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme required to convert 1 μmol of substrate to product in 1 min. Oxalate decarboxylase activity was assayed using the method of Magro et al. (30Magro P. Marciano P. Di Lenna P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1988; 49: 49-52Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar) at 26 °C. A mixture containing the enzyme and oxalate was incubated at pH 5.0 for 2 min before being neutralized with phosphate buffer, pH 9.5, to increase the pH to ≥7.5 to stop the decarboxylase reaction (7Tanner A. Bornemann S. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5271-5273Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Formate was determined spectrophotometrically at pH 7.5 using formate dehydrogenase with NAD. Formate production by oxalate decarboxylase was linear with time over a period of at least 20 min. The pH buffering capacity of oxalate when used at high concentrations (20–150 mm) required the use of up to 4 times the quantity of phosphate buffer to successfully neutralize the assay mixtures. Formate concentration was quantified by using the rearranged Michaelis-Menten equation after the determination of Km and Vmax for each batch of formate dehydrogenase in the conditions used in the assay. The values of Km and Vmax were determined by fitting the data with the Michaelis-Menten equation. Where indicated, solutions were made anaerobic using eight vacuum-N2 gas flush cycles and transferred to a Belle Technology glove box (Portesham, Dorset, UK) maintained at <1 ppm of O2. Residual dissolved O2 was removed with the addition of either 1 mm dithionite or a combination of 4–8 mm glucose, 12 units of glucose oxidase and 1,150 units of catalase at least 30 min before assay. Typically, 0.5 units of oxalate decarboxylase were added to the anaerobic assays. Oxalate oxidase activity was determined using a modified decarboxylase assay procedure. Instead of measuring formate with formate dehydrogenase and NAD, H2O2 was determined using the horseradish peroxidase-mediated single-electron oxidation of 5 mm2,2′-azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS1; ε = 12,500m−1 cm−1 at 740 nm for the ABTS radical product). The direct oxidation of ABTS by oxalate decarboxylase at pH 5.0 was monitored spectrophotometrically at 740 nm. Assay mixtures contained 200 mm citrate buffer, pH 5.0, 5 mm ABTS, 15 mm potassium oxalate, and enzyme, which was added last in a total volume of 1 ml. The presence of ABTS led to a decrease in the solubility of oxalate, prohibiting its use at higher concentrations. Superoxide dismutase (31Hara M.P. Fridovich I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 183: 511-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and phosphodiesterase (19Rodriguez-Lopez M. Baroja-Fernandez E. Zandueta-Criado A. Moreno-Bruna B. Munoz F.J. Akazawa T. Pozueta-Romero J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 44-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) activities were determined qualitatively in nondenaturing polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels using specific activity stains. X-band (∼9.7 GHz) EPR spectra were recorded on a modified Bruker ER 200 D-SRC EPR spectrometer (Bruker Spectrospin), fitted with an ESR-900 liquid helium flow cryostat (Oxford Instruments), and run with Bruker software on a Bruker ESP 1600 computer. Conditions were adjusted to ensure nonsaturation of signals. Spectra were obtained with a microwave frequency of 9.671 GHz and power of 0.2 milliwatts with a receiver gain of 5 × 104 at 20 K. Quoted EPR parameters were confirmed by simulating experimental data using Bruker WinEPR SimFonia, version 1.25, and taking into account second order shifts. The structure of each domain of oxalate decarboxylase was modeled on the basis of homology with oxalate oxidase (Protein Data Bank (PDB) entry code 1fi2) (16Woo E.J. Dunwell J.M. Goodenough P.W. Marvier A.C. Pickersgill R.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1036-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar)) using the method described previously (15Requena L. Bornemann S. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 185-190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fold of the entire subunit and its trimerization were modeled on the basis of homology with the 7-s seed storage proteins canavalin (PDB code 1cau (11Ko T.P. Ng J.D. McPherson A. Plant Physiol. 1993; 101: 729-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar)) and phaseolin (PDB code2phl (12Lawrence M.C. Izard T. Beuchat M. Blagrove R.J. Colman P.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 748-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar)). The dimerization of the trimer to give the hexamer was predicted by comparison with hexameric homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase (PDB code 1ey2 (24Titus G.P. Mueller H.A. Burgner J. de Cordoba S.R. Penalva M.A. Timm D.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 542-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar)) and the way in which proglycinin is thought to form hexamers (13Adachi M. Takenaka Y. Gidamis A.B. Mikami B. Utsumi S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 291-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Because only 100-μg quantities of the oxalate decarboxylase YvrK can be purified from B. subtilisitself (7Tanner A. Bornemann S. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5271-5273Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), it was cloned and overexpressed in E. coli. Although the recombinant protein was expressed at high levels under a variety of growth conditions, both the heat treatment of cells (42 °C, 2 min), just prior to the induction of expression and the addition of a Mn2+ salt to the growth medium on induction were necessary for the production of soluble and active enzyme. The addition of other metal ion salts (Fe2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, Co2+, Mg2+, and Zn2+) did not give significant levels of active enzyme. This is the first example of an oxalate decarboxylase being successfully overexpressed in a microbial host. The specific requirement of Mn2+ for the correct folding and activity of YvrK strongly suggested that it may be a manganese-containing enzyme. Similarly, the overexpression of recombinant YoaN gave high levels of soluble protein only when the cells were heat shocked and a Mn2+ salt was added to the growth medium as described above. The addition of other metal ions gave less soluble protein (Mn2+ ≫ Fe2+, Mg2+ > Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+ > Zn2+). By contrast, recombinant YxaG was expressed in a soluble form without the need for heat shock or the addition of a metal ion. Recombinant YvrK was purified using three column chromatography steps providing typically 15.8 mg of protein from 20 g of wet cell paste (Table I). The protein was at least 95% pure according to gel electrophoresis and had the expected subunit molecular mass of 44 kDa. Overall, the enzyme was purified 21-fold to give a specific activity (65 units mg−1) that was consistently higher than that of the wild-type enzyme (26 units mg−1 (7Tanner A. Bornemann S. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5271-5273Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar)), indicating the quality of the recombinant preparation. Gel filtration and nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that the enzyme had a molecular mass of 254 and 222 kDa, respectively. This finding was similar to that reported for the wild-type enzyme (7Tanner A. Bornemann S. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5271-5273Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and strongly suggests that the active oligomer was composed of six subunits. The recombinant enzyme was occasionally prone to oxidation during the latter stages of the purification resulting in its dimerization, presumably because of the formation of interoligomer disulfides between cysteine residues, of which each subunit bears one. The addition of dithiothreitol prevented dimerization from occurring.Table IPurification of recombinant YvrKStepVolumeProteinActivitySpecific activity-Fold purificationYieldmlmgunitsunits mg−1%Crude extract32117137003.21100DEAE-Sepharose4836233609.32.991Mono Q201092230206.560Ammonium sulfate6571320237.336Sephadex 2001515.810306520.728 Open table in a new tab The oxalate dependence of the oxalate decarboxylase activity of YvrK followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics (Fig. 3). The Km(15 mm) was higher than that reported for the Aspergillus niger (2–4 mm (32Emiliani E. Bekes P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1964; 105: 488-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar)),Myrothecium verrucaria (1.7 mm (33Lillehoj E.B. Smith F.G. Arch. Biochem.

Chem. 1991; 266: 23548-23553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) enzymes. The Vmax (75 μmol min−1mg−1) corresponded to a kcat of 54 s−1 and was lower than that reported for the F. velutipes enzyme (166 μmol min−1 mg−1(34Mehta A. Datta A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23548-23553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). The addition of MnCl2 (1.5–60 mm) to assay mixtures did not result in an increase in activity, and dialysis of the enzyme for 17 h at 6 °C with buffers that were devoid of manganese salts did not lead to a detectable decrease in activity. The wild-type bacterial enzyme is known to be less active when it has undergone vacuum-N2 gas flush cycles and is then assayed in an atmosphere maintained at <1 ppm of O2 (7Tanner A. Bornemann S. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5271-5273Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). These experiments have been repeated with recombinant YvrK together with further measures to remove dissolved O2. The addition of 1 mm dithionite to assay mixtures resulted in a complete loss of oxalate decarboxylase activity. Although this result was consistent with the O2 dependence of the reaction, dithionite is a powerful single-electron reductant that could have affected the enzyme in other ways. Enzyme that had been treated with dithionite and exposed to atmospheric O2 before assay regained only 18% of its activity, suggesting some irreversible effect of dithionite (or an effect of its oxidation product sulfite) on activity. To remove dissolved O2 without the complications posed by dithionite, the experiments were repeated in the presence of glucose oxidase and excess glucose. Catalase was also added in order to remove the H2O2 produced by glucose oxidase. YvrK retained only 20 and 16% of its activity using 4 and 8 mmglucose, respectively. This result confirmed the d"

Moreover, together with cholesterol, sphingolipids in plasma membrane constitute detergent-resistant microdomains termed lipids rafts, which are involved in membrane trafficking and cell signaling (4Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (7948) Google Scholar, 5Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17221-17224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2035) Google Scholar). De novo biosynthesis of sphingolipids in mammalian cells proceeds as follows (6Merrill Jr., A.H. Jones D.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1044: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). The first step is the condensation ofl-serine and palmitoyl-CoA, a reaction catalyzed by serine palmitoyl transferase, to generate 3-ketodihydrosphingosine, which is reduced to dihydrosphingosine. Dihydrosphingosine undergoes N-acylation followed by desaturation to generate ceramide (Cer).1 These reactions to produce Cer occur at the cytosolic surface of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (7Mandon E.C. Ehses I. Rother J. van Echten G. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11144-11148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Hirschberg K. Rodger J. Futerman A.H. Biochem.

Then, Cer is delivered to the luminal side of the Golgi apparatus and converted to sphingomyelin (SM) by SM synthase catalyzing the transfer of phosphocholine from phosphatidylcholine to Cer (10Futerman A.H. Stieger B. Hubbard A.L. Pagano R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8650-8657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Jeckel D. Karrenbauer A. Birk R. Schmidt R.R. Wieland F. FEBS Lett. 1990; 261: 155-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Cer is also converted to glucosylceramide (GlcCer) by GlcCer synthase catalyzing the transfer of glucose from UDP-glucose to Cer. Although the catalytic site of GlcCer synthase appears to be oriented to the cytoplasm (12Futerman A.H. Pagano R.E. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 13Jeckel D. Karrenbauer A. Burger K.N.J. van Meer G. Wieland F. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), it is controversial whether GlcCer synthase is localized to the Golgi apparatus or more broadly distributed to microsomes. After translocation to the luminal side of the Golgi apparatus, GlcCer is further converted to more complex glycosphingolipids (14Lannert H. Gorgas K. Meissner I. Wieland F.T. Jeckel D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2939-2946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We have previously showed that there are two pathways for transport of de novo synthesized Cer from the ER to the site of SM synthesis in various types of cultured cells, including Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, HeLa cells, and human skin fibroblasts (15Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Hanada K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 673-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The main pathway of the two is ATP-dependent, and the minor pathway is ATP-independent (or less dependent). In contrast to the synthesis of SM, the access of Cer to the site of GlcCer synthesis is largely independent of ATP. Analysis by in vitro assay of Cer transport in semi-intact CHO cells further revealed that the ATP-dependent transport of Cer, from the ER to the site of SM synthesis, requires cytosol but that cytosol is not required for transport of Cer to the site of GlcCer synthesis (16Funakoshi T. Yasuda S. Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Hanada K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29938-29945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In addition, that a CHO cell mutant defective in the ATP-dependent pathway of Cer transport exhibits no defect in transport of proteins from the ER to the Golgi apparatus has suggested that the mechanism of Cer transport differs from that of ER-to-Golgi trafficking of proteins (15Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Hanada K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 673-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Inhibitors of de novo sphingolipid biosynthesis are useful tools to investigate the metabolism and functions of sphingolipids in cultured cells and in living animals. Various natural and chemically synthesized compounds have been found to be highly selective, even if not strictly specific, inhibitors of sphingolipid synthesis. For example, sphingofungins and ISP-1 (myriocin) appear to be specific and potent inhibitors of serine palmitoyl transferase (17Zweerink M.M. Edison A.M. Wells G.B. Pinto W. Lester R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25032-25038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Miyake Y. Kozutsumi Y. Nakamura S. Fujita T. Kawasaki T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 396-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Fumonisins seem to inhibit (dihydro)sphingosine-N-acyltransferase specifically (19Merrill Jr., A.H. Liotta D.C. Riley R.T. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 218-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar).d-threo-1-Phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol and some of its derivatives selectively inhibit GlcCer synthase (20Inokuchi J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 14662-14669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). However, no specific inhibitor for SM synthesis in mammalian cells has been found so far. In addition, no drug that inhibits intracellular trafficking of sphingolipids has been discovered, except for broad-spectrum inhibitors such as brefeldin A and energy poisons. In the present study, we showed that N-(3-hydroxy-1-hydroxymethyl-3-phenylpropyl)dodecanamide (HPA-12), a novel analog of Cer, inhibits ATP-dependent transport of Cer from the ER to the site of SM synthesis without inhibition of protein trafficking, thereby inhibiting conversion of Cer to SM, but not to GlcCer, in cells. Moreover, a stereoisomer having the 1 R,3 R configuration was found to be the most active among the four stereoisomers of HPA-12. l-[U-14C]Serine (155 mCi/mmol) and [methyl-14C]choline (55.0 mCi/mmol) were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.6-[N-(7-Nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino]caproyl-d-erythro-sphingosine (C6-NBD-Cer) and N-(4,4-difluoro-5,7-dimethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene-3-pentanoyl)-d-erythro-sphingosine (C5-DMB-Cer) were from Molecular Probes, Inc.d-erythro-[3-3H]Sphingosine (20 Ci/mmol), [palmitoyl-1-14C]N-palmitoyl-d-sphingosine ([14C]C16-Cer) (55 mCi/mmol) and [choline-methyl-14C]sphingomyelin (50 mCi/mmol) were from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc.d-erythro-Sphingosine was from Matraya, Inc.

The CHO cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Cell Collection (ATCC CCL 61). Cells were routinely maintained in Ham's F12 medium supplemented with 10% newborn bovine serum (NBS), penicillin G (100 units/ml), and streptomycin sulfate (100 μg/ml) at 33 °C in a 5% CO2incubator (22Hanada K. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22137-22142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nutridoma medium (Ham's F12 containing 1% Nutridoma-SP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 25 μg/ml gentamicin) was used as serum-free medium. When the medium was supplemented with Me2SO or drugs dissolved in Me2SO, the concentration of Me2SO in medium was adjusted to 0.01% (v/v). CHO cells were seeded at a density of 1.0 × 106 in 5 ml of F12 medium containing 10% NBS per 60-mm dish and cultured at 33 °C overnight. The cell monolayers were incubated in 1.5 ml of Nutridoma medium supplemented, if necessary, with various drugs at 4 °C for 15 min, and after addition of [14C]serine (0.75 μCi) or [14C]choline (1.0 μCi), incubated at 33 °C for various periods of time. After being washed twice with 2 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), the cells were lysed with 1000 μl of 0.1% cold SDS, and 800 and 20 μl of the lysate was used for lipid extraction and determination of protein concentration, respectively. For analysis of lipids labeled with [14C]serine, lipids were separated on TLC plates with a solvent of methyl acetate/n-propanol/chloroform/methanol/0.25% KCl (25:25:25:10:9, v/v). For analysis of lipids labeled with [14C]choline, lipids were separated by one-dimensional TLC with a solvent of chloroform/methanol/acetate/H2O (25:15:4:2, v/v), or two-dimensional TLC; chloroform/methanol/H2O (65:25:4, v/v) for the first dimension and 1-butanol/acetate/H2O (60:20:20, v/v) for the second dimension. Radioactive lipids separated on the plates were detected with a BAS 2000 image analyzer (Fuji Film, Inc., Tokyo). After the collection of gels from plates by scraping, the radioactivity of each lipid was determined by liquid scintillation counting and normalized to the protein concentration of cells. For metabolic labeling with [14C]serine in BFA-treated cells, cells were preincubated with 1 μg/ml BFA in Nutridoma medium at 33 °C for 30 min, and, then, treated with or without 1 μmHPA-12 in the presence of 1 μg/ml BFA at 4 °C for 15 min prior to addition of [14C]serine. CHO cell monolayers were grown in 60-mm dishes as described above. The cell monolayers were labeled with 1 μm C5-DMB-Cer complexed with 1 μm BSA in 1.5 ml of Nutridoma medium at 4 °C for 30 min. After being washed three times with F12 medium, the cells were incubated in 1.5 ml of Nutridoma medium with or without 2.5 μm HPA-12 at 4 °C for 15 min and then incubated at 33 °C for 15 min. After being washed with PBS, the cells were lysed with 0.1% SDS as described above. Lipids extracted from the cell lysate were separated by high performance TLC with a solvent of chloroform/methanol/H2O (65:25:4, v/v). After the collection of gels from the plates, C5-DMB-SM was scraped from the plates and extracted in chloroform/methanol/H2O (1:2:0.8). DMB fluorescence was measured with a spectrofluorometer (excitation at 480 nm; emission at 515 nm). The assay of the conversion of [3H]Cer to [3H]SM in cells was performed by a method described previously (16Funakoshi T. Yasuda S. Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Hanada K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29938-29945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. In brief, the cell monolayers were prelabeled with 1.5 ml of Nutridoma medium containing 1 μmd-erythro-[3H]sphingosine (0.5 μCi) complexed with 2 μm BSA at 15 °C for 30 min for pulse reaction. After being washed three times with 2 ml of cold F12 medium, the cells were incubated in 1.5 ml of Nutridoma medium with or without 1 μm HPA-12 at 4 °C for 15 min and then incubated at 33 °C for various periods of time in the presence of 100 μm fumonisin B1 for chase. Lipids extracted from cells were separated on TLC plates with a solvent of chloroform/methanol/H2O (65:25:4, v/v), and the radioactivity of each lipid was determined as described above. CHO cells were seeded at a density of 3.0 × 106 per 150-mm dish in 20 ml of F12 medium containing 10% NBS and cultured at 33 °C overnight. After being washed twice with 10 ml of serum-free F12 medium, the cells were incubated in 20 ml of Nutridoma medium with or without 2.5 μm HPA-12 at 33 °C for 48 h. Each medium was replaced every 24 h. The cells were washed twice with 10 ml of PBS, harvested by scraping, and precipitated by centrifugation. Lipids were extracted from the harvested cells and resuspended in PBS (23Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41848) Google Scholar). For phospholipids, extracted lipids were separated on TLC plates with a solvent of chlorohorm/methanol/acetate/H2O (25:15:4:2, v/v), and the phosphorous content of the phospholipids was measured by the method of Rouser et al. (24Rouser G. Siakotos A.N. Fleischer S. Lipids. 1966; 1: 85-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1312) Google Scholar). GlcCer and N-acetylneuraminyl lactosylceramide (GM3) contents were determined by densitometric analysis of lipids stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue as described previously (25Hanada K. Nishijima M. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 312: 304-317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The amounts of Cer were determined by using an sn-1,2-diacylglycerol assay reagent system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membrane fractions prepared from CHO cells and bovine brain were used as the enzyme sources. CHO cells cultured in spinner bottles were homogenized in buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.25 msucrose) with a stainless ball homogenizer as described previously (16Funakoshi T. Yasuda S. Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Hanada K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29938-29945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). After the removal of nuclei and unbroken cells by centrifugation (900 × g for 10 min), the post nuclear supernatant of the cell homogenate was centrifuged (105 × gfor 60 min). The precipitate as the membrane fraction was suspended in buffer A (∼7 mg of protein/ml), and stored at −80 °C until use. Bovine brain membranes were prepared as described previously (26Hanada K. Mitamura T. Fukasawa M. Magistrado P.A. Horii T. Nishijima M. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 671-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Enzyme assays of SM synthase activity were carried out by the modifications of a previously described method (27Hanada K. Horii M. Akamatsu Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1086: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In brief, CHO cell membranes (400 μg of protein) were incubated in 800 μl of 10 mm Hepes-NaOH buffer (pH 7.5) containing 2 mmEDTA, and 1 μm of C6-NBD-Cer or C5-DMB-Cer complexed with BSA at 33 °C for 10 min. Because exogenous [14C]C16-Cer is a poor substrate for SM synthase due to its water insolubility, 0.1% Triton X-100 was added to the reaction buffer and the reaction period was prolonged to 1 h when [14C]C16-Cer was used as the substrate. The radioactivity of [14C]SM that formed was determined after TLC of extracted lipids. Assays of acid and neutral sphingomyelinase (SMase) activities were performed as described previously (26Hanada K. Mitamura T. Fukasawa M. Magistrado P.A. Horii T. Nishijima M. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 671-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Briefly, for the assay of acid SMase activity, CHO cell membranes (5 μg of protein) were incubated in 50 μl of 0.1m sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.8) containing 10 μm [3H]SM, 0.2% β-octylglucoside, and 0.1% Triton X-100 at 37 °C for 30 min. For the assay of neutral SMase activity, bovine brain membranes (5 μg of protein) were incubated in 50 μl of 50 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.5) containing 10 μm [3H]SM, 0.2% β-octylglucoside, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 mmMgCl2 and 1 mm phosphatidylserine at 37 °C for 30 min. Then, the amount of radioactive [14C]phosphocholine liberated was determined. Serine palmitoyl transferase activity was determined as described previously (28Hanada K. Hara T. Nishijima M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8409-8415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Sphingosine N-acyltransferase activity was determined by a modification of a previously described method (29Wang E. Merrill Jr., A.H. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 311: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In brief, CHO cell membranes (50 μg of protein) were incubated in 400 μl of 25 mm Hepes-NaOH buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1 μmd-erythro-[3H]sphingosine, 50 μm palmitoyl-CoA, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol at 33 °C for 30 min. After extraction, lipids were separated on high performance TLC plates with a solvent of chloroform/methanol/acetate (94:5:5, v/v), and the amount of radioactive [3H]Cer separated on the plates was analyzed with a BAS1800 image analyzer (Fuji Film, Inc., Tokyo). CHO cells grown on glass coverslips (22-mm diameter) in 35-mm dishes were incubated in 1 ml of F12 medium containing 1 μm of C5-DMB-Cer or C6-NBD-Cer complexed with 1 μm BSA at 4 °C for 30 min, washed with 1 ml of F12 medium three times and incubated in 1 ml of Nutridoma medium in the presence or absence of 2.5 μm HPA-12 at 4 °C for 15 min. Then, prelabeled cells were incubated at 33 °C for 15 min, washed with PBS and fixed with 0.125% glutaraldehyde solution in PBS for 5 min at 4 °C. For zero-time control, cells were fixed after the HPA-12 treatment without a shift in temperature. The specimens were observed and photographed under a fluorescence microscope (Axiovert S100TV, Carl Zeiss, Tokyo) soon after fixation. CHO transfectants expressing PLAP or PLAP-HA (30Hanada K. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. Pagano R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6254-6260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) were seeded at a density of 3.0 × 105 cells per 35-mm dish in 1.5 ml of F12 medium containing 10% NBS and cultured at 33 °C overnight. The cells were incubated in 1 ml of medium A (methionine, cysteine, and glutamine-free RPMI 1640 medium (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) supplemented with 1% Nutridoma-SP, 2 mml-glutamine, and 25 μg/ml gentamicin) for 1 h at 33 °C and then in 200 μl of medium A containing 50 μCi of EXPRESS 35S-protein labeling mix (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 15 min at 33 °C. The labeled cells were incubated in 1 ml of Nutridoma medium containing 10 mm methionine, 10 mm cysteine, and 10 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.4) in the absence or presence of 2.5 μm(1 R,3 R)-HPA-12 and then chase-incubated at 33 °C for various periods of time. According to a method described previously (15Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Hanada K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 673-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), proteins of cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-PLAP antibody (Biomeda Corp.) and protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), digested with endoglycosidase H (Endo H), and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Cells were seeded at 2 × 104 per well of 48-well plates in 500 μl of F12 medium supplemented with 10% NBS and cultured at 33 °C overnight. The cell monolayers were incubated in 500 μl of Nutridoma medium containing various concentrations of HPAs at 33 °C for 24 h. Then, the viability of cells was determined by using 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazoyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide as described previously (31Hanada K. Hara T. Fukasawa M. Yamaji A. Umeda M. Nishijima M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33787-33794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined with the Pierce BCA assay reagent kit, using BSA as the standard. A series of N-(3-hydroxy-1-hydroxymethyl-3-phenylpropyl)alkanamides (HPAs), novel analogs of Cer, were chemically synthesized (Fig.1 A). To examine the effects of these drugs on the de novo biosynthesis of sphingolipids in mammalian cells, CHO cells were incubated with [14C]serine in the presence or absence of 2.5 μm of each drug for 2 h at 33 °C. HPAs inhibited the de novo synthesis of sphingolipids, depending on the length of the N-acyl chains of the drugs. HPA-12, the dodecanoyl derivative, inhibited [14C]SM formation to ∼10% of the drug-free control level (Fig. 1 B). Other HPAs, in which the carbon atom numbers of the acyl chain is 3, 8, and 16, had far less of an inhibitory effect than HPA-12 (Fig.1 B). At 2.5 μm, these drugs did not affect the viability of cells (data not shown, see also below). HPA-12 significantly inhibits the formation of [14C]SM even at 0.1 μm, and the inhibitory effect reaches a plateau around 1 μm (Fig.2 A). HPA-12 at more than 10 μm was highly toxic to CHO cells (data not shown), not allowing us to carry out metabolic labeling experiments at more than 10 μm of this drug. The time course of metabolic labeling up to 5 h showed that 1 μm HPA-12 inhibited formation of [14C]SM to <30% of the drug-free control level throughout the incubation period (Fig. 2 B). HPA-12 did not affect the formation of [14C]phosphatidylserine (PS) or [14C]phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), both of which are metabolically labeled with [14C]serine via a pathway distinct from sphingolipid synthesis (Figs. 1 B and 2 B), indicating that the inhibition of sphingolipid synthesis by HPA-12 was not due to a nonspecific dysfunction of lipid metabolism. HPA-12 moderately inhibited the formation of [14C]Cer and [14C]GlcCer, although its inhibitory effect on GlcCer and Cer synthesis was weaker than that on SM synthesis (Figs. 1 Band 2 B). To examine effects of HPA-12 on the turnover of de novosynthesized SM, we pulse-labeled CHO cells with [14C]serine for 2 h at 33 °C, and chased for 24 h at 33 °C in the presence of 10 mmnon-radioactive serine with or without 1 μm HPA-12. The level of cell-associated [14C]SM was not affected by HPA-12 throughout the chase (Fig.3 A). In addition, HPA-12 did not affect the activities of acid or neutral sphingomyelinases in vitro at 20 μm (Fig. 3, B and C). These results eliminated the possibility that HPA-12 accelerated degradation of SM. When conversion of Cer to SM is inhibited, de novo synthesis of sphingoid bases seems to be suppressed, as suggested previously (15Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Hanada K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 673-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Thus, the moderate inhibition of the formation of [14C]serine-derived Cer and GlcCer by HPA-12 might be due to a secondary effect of this drug on inhibition of Cer-to-SM conversion. To examine effects of HPA-12 on the step of Cer-to-SM conversion specifically, we employed another protocol for metabolic labeling. When CHO cells are incubated with [3H]sphingosine at 15 °C, [3H]sphingosine is efficiently N-acylated to generate [3H]Cer without further conversion of [3H]Cer to [3H]SM in intact cells (16Funakoshi T. Yasuda S. Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Hanada K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29938-29945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). After pulse labeling with [3H]sphingosine at 15 °C for 30 min, cells were treated with 1 μm HPA-12 at 4 °C for 15 min and further incubated at 33 °C for up to 1 h for chase in the presence of fumonisin B1, an inhibitor of sphingosine N-acyltransferase. Under these pulse and chase conditions, 1 μm HPA-12 inhibited the formation of [3H]SM by ∼50%, whereas it did not inhibit but rather slightly increased the formation of [3H]GlcCer (Fig.4). The level of [3H]Cer gradually decreased concomitant with the formation of [3H]SM and [3H]GlcCer during chase, and the rate of decrease was slower in HPA-12-treated cells than in drug-free control cells, although the initial levels of [3H]Cer at the start of the chase were almost identical between the two (Fig. 4). These results indicated that HPA-12 inhibits conversion of Cer to SM, but not to GlcCer, in intact cells. SM is synthesized by the transfer of phosphocholine from phosphatidylcholine (PC) to Cer, a reaction catalyzed by SM synthase (19Merrill Jr., A.H. Liotta D.C. Riley R.T. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 218-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Metabolic labeling experiments with [14C]choline showed that treatment of cells with 1 μm HPA-12 did not inhibit formation of [14C]PC but that the level of [14C]SM in drug-treated cells was about half of the control level (Fig. 5). Therefore, inhibition of Cer-to-SM conversion by HPA-12 was not due to inhibition of PC synthesis. HPA-12 itself was unlikely to be converted to choline-containing metabolites, because HPA-12-dependent generation of radioactive lipids was not detected in TLC patterns of [14C]choline-labeled lipids of one-dimensional (Fig. 5) or two-dimensional (data not shown) analysis. We determined chemical amounts of various lipids in cells cultured in a sphingolipid-free medium in the presence or absence of 2.5 μm HPA-12 at 33 °C for 2 days (Table I). HPA-12 did not affect levels of total phospholipids: The contents of total phospholipids in untreated and drug-treated cells were 288 ± 3 and 315 ± 2 nmol/mg of protein, respectively. However, the content of SM in HPA-12-treated cells was lower by ∼30% than the drug-free control level, and the reduction in SM in HPA-12-treated cells seemed to be compensated by an increase in the amount of PC (Table I). HPA-12 did not influence contents of other major glycerophospholipid types. In contrast, HPA-12 treatment increased the content of GlcCer and GM3 to ∼150% and ∼120%, respectively, of the untreated control level (Table I). There was no significant difference in the content of Cer between the two groups (Table I). These results were another line of evidence that the primary target of HPA-12 is the step of conversion of Cer to SM.Table IEffects of HPA-12 on phospholipid composition and sphingolipid contents in CHO cellsHPA-12Phospholipid composition1-aPC, phosphatidylcholine; PI/PS, phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylserine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine.GM3GlcCerCerSMPCPI/PSPE% of total phospholipids recoverednmol/mg proteinNone12.0 ± 0.143.3 ± 0.113.2 ±"
https://openalex.org/W1968851198,"The insulin and the endothelin type A (ETA) receptor both can couple into the heterotrimeric G protein αq/11 (Gαq/11), leading to Gαq/11 tyrosine phosphorylation, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation, and subsequent stimulation of glucose transport. In this study, we assessed the potential role of Src kinase in ET-1 signaling to glucose transport in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Src kinase inhibitor PP2 blocked ET-1-induced Src kinase activity, Gαq/11 tyrosine phosphorylation, and glucose transport stimulation. To determine which Src family kinase member was involved, we microinjected anti-c-Src, -c-Fyn, or -c-Yes antibody into these cells and found that only anti-c-Yes antibody blocked GLUT4 translocation (70% decreased). Overexpression or microinjection of a dominant negative mutant (K298M) of Src kinase also inhibited ET-1-induced Gαq/11 tyrosine phosphorylation and GLUT4 translocation. In co-immunoprecipitation experiments, we found that β-arrestin 1 associated with the ETA receptor in an agonist-dependent manner and that β-arrestin 1 recruited Src kinase to a molecular complex that included the ETA receptor. Microinjection of β-arrestin 1 antibody inhibited ET-1- but not insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation. In conclusion, 1) the Src kinase Yes can induce tyrosine phosphorylation of Gαq/11in response to ET-1 stimulation, and 2) β-arrestin 1 and Src kinase form a molecular complex with the ETA receptor to mediate ET-1 signaling to Gαq/11 with subsequent glucose transport stimulation.

The insulin receptor is a tyrosine kinase, and after ligand binding the receptor phosphorylates a number of substrates including the IRS1 family of proteins. Based on a variety of in vitro biochemical studies (4Quon M.J. Butte A.J. Zarnowski M.J. Sesti G. Cushman S.W. Taylor S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27920-27924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as well as results drawn from IRS-1 knockout animals (5Tamemoto H. Kadowaki T. Tobe K. Yagi T. Sakura H. Hayakawa T.

Nature. 1994; 372: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar), IRS-1 has been proposed as one mechanism coupling the insulin receptor to GLUT4 translocation. Others have shown an alternate pathway that is IRS- and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-independent involving CAP, Cbl, and TC10, which are also required for insulin stimulation of glucose transport (7Chiang S.H. Baumann C.A. Kanzaki M. Thurmond D.C. Watson R.T. Neudauer C.L. Macara I.G. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2001; 410: 944-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Recently we have demonstrated that insulin receptors can also couple to the heterotrimeric G protein Gαq/11 as a necessary step in this stimulatory process in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Activated insulin receptors tyrosine phosphorylate Gαq/11 leading to stimulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and downstream signaling to glucose transport. Recently Kanzaki et al. (8Kanzaki M. Watson R.T. Artemyev N.O. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7167-7175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) have also demonstrated the necessity for Gαq/11 in insulin-stimulated glucose transport, although these workers did not find a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase dependence of this G protein action. Endothelin-1 (ET-1) can also stimulate glucose transport in insulin target tissues (9Wu-Wong J.R. Berg C.E. Wang J. Chiou W.J. Fissel B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8103-8110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and the signaling pathway utilized by this GPCR also involves tyrosine phosphorylation of Gαq/11 with subsequent stimulation of glucose transport (10Imamura T. Ishibashi K. Dalle S. Ugi S. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33691-33695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Thus, both the insulin receptor and ETA receptor can utilize a common signaling pathway for transport stimulation involving Gαq/11 tyrosine phosphorylation. The insulin receptor is a tyrosine kinase (11Roth R.A. Cassell D.J. Science. 1983; 219: 299-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 12Van Obberghen E. Rossi B. Kowalski A. Gazzano H.

Chem. 1983; 258: 14450-14455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and therefore the mechanism of insulin-stimulated Gαq/11 tyrosine phosphorylation is straightforward. However, the ETA receptor does not possess intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity (14van Biesen T. Luttrell L.M. Hawes B.E. Lefkowitz R.J. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 698-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), and therefore the mechanisms responsible for ET-1-stimulated phosphorylation of this G protein are less obvious. In the current studies, we show that after ET-1 treatment, the ETA receptor forms a molecular complex with Gαq/11, β-arrestin 1, and the Src family kinase Yes to stimulate GLUT4 translocation. Mouse monoclonal anti-GLUT4 antibody (1F8) was from Biogenesis Inc. (Brentwood, NH), and rabbit polyclonal anti-GLUT4 antibody (F349) was kindly provided by Dr. Michael Mueckler (Washington University, St. Louis, MO).

Wild type, constitutively active (Y529F), and dominant negative (K298R/Y528F) mutants of Src kinase expression vectors were from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and fetal bovine serum were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. All radioisotopes were from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA). All other reagents were purchased from Sigma. 3T3-L1 cells were cultured and differentiated as described previously (15Haruta T. Morris A.J. Rose D.W. Nelson J.G. Mueckler M. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol.

Microinjection of various reagents was carried out using a semiautomatic Eppendorf microinjection system. All reagents for microinjection were dissolved in microinjection buffer containing 5 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 100 mm KCl. 5 mg/ml antibody or control sheep IgG was injected into the cell cytoplasm, and the microinjected volume represented ∼10% of the cytoplasmic volume. For inhibitor treatments, starved 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated with 200 nm PP2, 1 μm ETA receptor inhibitor (BQ610), or 0.1% Me2SO vehicle for 1 h or the indicated time period at 37 °C. For GLUT4 translocation, cells were stimulated with ligands for 20 min. Differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were trypsinized and transiently transfected by electroporation (0.15–0.3 kV and 960 microfarads) with 100 μg of endotoxin-free plasmid DNA/cuvette. Following electroporation, the cells were replated on collagen-coated tissue culture dishes and allowed to recover for 24–36 h before use. For adenovirus infection, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were transduced at a multiplicity of infection of 10 plaque-forming units/cell for 16 h with the recombinant adenovirus encoding constitutively active (Q209L) mutant Gαq as described previously (16Imamura T. Vollenweider P. Egawa K. Clodi M. Ishibashi K. Nakashima N. Ugi S. Adams J.W. Brown J.H. Olefsky J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6765-6774Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Immunostaining of GLUT4 was performed essentially as described previously (17Vollenweider P. Martin S.S. Haruta T. Morris A.J. Nelson J.G. Cormont M. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Rose D.W. Olefsky J.M. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4941-4949Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at room temperature. Following washing, the cells were permeabilized and blocked with 0.1% Triton X-100 and 2% fetal calf serum in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min. The cells were then incubated with anti-GLUT4 antibody in phosphate-buffered saline with 2% fetal calf serum overnight at 4 °C. After washing, GLUT4 and injected IgG were detected by incubation with tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibody and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-sheep antibody, respectively, followed by observation under an immunofluorescence microscope. In all counting experiments, the observer was blinded to the experimental condition of each coverslip. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were starved for 12 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The cells were stimulated with 17 nminsulin or 10 nm ET-1 for the indicated time period at 37 °C and lysed in a solubilizing buffer containing 20 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 140 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 units of aprotinin/ml, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 mm NaF, pH 7.5 for 30 min at 4 °C. The cell lysates were centrifuged to remove insoluble materials. For Western blot analysis, whole cell lysates (30–80 μg of protein/lane) were denatured by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer containing 100 mm dithiothreitol and resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gels were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Bedford, MA) using a Transblot apparatus (Bio-Rad). For immunoblotting, membranes were blocked and probed with specified antibodies. Blots were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody followed by chemiluminescence detection according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Pierce). Images were scanned and quantitated by the NIH Image program. After 60 h of adenovirus infection or after 36 h of electroporation, serum-starved 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated in the absence or presence of 200 nm PP2 for 1 h prior to ligand stimulation with or without ET-1 (10 nm) or insulin (17 nm) for 10 min. Cells were then lysed and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-pan-Src antibody (Src-2, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h at 4 °C. Src kinase activity of the immunoprecipitants was analyzed using the Src kinase assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.). Briefly, immunoprecipitants were incubated with a synthetic peptide (KVEKIGEGTYGVVYK), corresponding to amino acids 6–20 of p34 Cdc2, and [γ32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) for 10 min at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped with 40% trichloroacetic acid precipitation, and reaction products were spotted on Whatman p81 paper. After washing five times with 0.75% phosphoric acid, 32P incorporation into the substrate peptide was measured by a scintillation counter. Using a positive control (active Src kinase, Upstate Biotechnology Inc.), we confirmed that all data were within the linear response range for this determination. The insulin receptor is a tyrosine kinase (11Roth R.A. Cassell D.J. Science. 1983; 219: 299-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 18Kasuga M. Zick Y. Blithe D.L. Crettaz M. Kahn C.R. Nature. 1982; 298: 667-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), and therefore a clear-cut mechanism for insulin-induced Gαq/11 tyrosine phosphorylation can be visualized. However, the ETA receptor does not possess intrinsic kinase activity, and the mechanism of ET-1-mediated Gαq/11 phosphorylation is not obvious. After ligand binding, the GPCR β2-adrenergic receptor forms a molecular complex that includes β-arrestin 1 and activated Src kinase to facilitate tyrosine kinase-mediated signaling events (19Luttrell L.M. van Biesen T. Hawes B.E. Koch W.J. Krueger K.M. Touhara K. Lefkowitz R.J. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprot. Res. 1997; 31: 263-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Since the ET-1 receptor is also a GPCR, these findings raise the possibility that analogous β-arrestin·Src kinase complexes might play a role in ET-1-stimulated glucose transport. To test this hypothesis, we measured ET-1-stimulated 2-DOG uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes pretreated with the Src family kinase inhibitor PP2. Insulin-induced 2-DOG uptake or GLUT4 translocation were not affected by PP2 at concentrations below 400 nm (data not shown), therefore we used 200 nm PP2 pretreatment in these studies. As shown in Fig.1 A, pretreatment with 200 nm PP2 decreased ET-1-induced 2-DOG uptake by 61%. This was comparable to the inhibitory effect achieved by pretreating cells with the ETA receptor antagonist BQ610 (20Ishibashi K.I. Imamura T. Sharma P.M. Ugi S. Olefsky J.M. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4623-4628Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 21Ishibashi K. Imamura T. Sharma P.M. Huang J. Ugi S. Olefsky J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 1193-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In contrast, neither PP2 nor BQ610 affected insulin-induced 2-DOG uptake. We have previously shown that overexpression of constitutively active Gq(Q209L) protein mimics the actions of ET-1 and insulin on glucose transport and can stimulate GLUT4 translocation and glucose transport by itself (16Imamura T. Vollenweider P. Egawa K. Clodi M. Ishibashi K. Nakashima N. Ugi S. Adams J.W. Brown J.H. Olefsky J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6765-6774Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 A shows that the stimulatory effect of Q209L expression is not inhibited by PP2, indicating that the site of action of Src kinase is upstream of Gαq/11. Similar results were observed for ET-1-induced GLUT4 translocation. PP2 treatment decreased ET-1-induced GLUT4 translocation to near basal levels as did the ETA receptor antagonist BQ610. On the other hand, insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation was unaffected by these reagents (Fig. 1 B). We have previously shown that ET-1 stimulation leads to Gαq/11 tyrosine phosphorylation (10Imamura T. Ishibashi K. Dalle S. Ugi S. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33691-33695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and this is consistent with other reports showing that a tyrosine residue in the C terminus of Gαq/11 becomes phosphorylated after GPCR activation (22Umemori H. Inoue T. Kume S. Sekiyama N. Nagao M. Itoh H. Nakanishi S. Mikoshiba K. Yamamoto T. Science. 1997; 276: 1878-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). To determine whether activation of a Src kinase by the ETA receptor might mediate ET-1-stimulated Gαq/11tyrosine phosphorylation, we examined the effects of the Src kinase inhibitor PP2 on ET-1-induced phosphorylation of Gαq/11. Fig. 2 A shows that insulin and ET-1 stimulate Gαq/11 tyrosine phosphorylation 6.9 ± 0.9- and 5.2 ± 0.6-fold, respectively, and that pretreatment with PP2 decreases the effect of ET-1 (73% decrease) but not of insulin. These results are quite consistent with the notion that the ET-1 receptor forms a complex with a Src kinase, leading to Gαq/11 phosphorylation. To further explore the importance of Src kinase in ET-1-mediated Gαq/11 phosphorylation, we used electroporation to overexpress wild type, constitutively active, or dominant negative Src kinase mutant in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. For these experiments, constitutively active Src was a full-length Src construct with Tyr to Phe substitution at position 529 (Y529F) (23Barone M.V. Courtneidge S. Nature. 1995; 378: 509-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). 2Amino acid numbering of Src kinase is according to the human c-Src sequence (25Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Ahn S. Khan K.D. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11312-11319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Dominant negative Src contained inactivating point mutations at positions 298 and 528 (K298R/Y528F) (24Mukhopadhyay D. Tsiokas L. Zhou X.M. Foster D. Brugge J.S. Sukhatme V.P. Nature. 1995; 375: 577-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). The results in Fig. 2 B showed that expression of the dominant negative Src kinase decreased ET-1-induced Gαq/11 phosphorylation by 85%, whereas constitutively active Src kinase expression stimulated the phosphorylation of Gαq/11 to the same degree as ET-1 stimulation. We also determined whether ET-1 could stimulate Src kinase activity by measuring the ability of Src immunoprecipitates prepared from whole cell lysates to phosphorylate a Src kinase substrate. As seen in Fig.2 C, insulin did not enhance Src kinase activity, whereas ET-1 stimulation led to a dose-dependent increase of 1.5- and 1.8-fold at 1 and 10 nm ET-1, respectively. This increase in Src kinase activity was blocked by pretreatment of cells with PP2, which decreased Src kinase activity below basal values. Interestingly overexpression of constitutively active Q209L did not lead to an enhancement of Src kinase activity (Fig. 2 C). This latter result reinforces the concept that Src kinase is located upstream of Gαq/11 and that there is no activating input from this G protein to Src kinase. In the β-adrenergic receptor system, β-arrestin 1 binds to the receptor and serves as a docking protein to recruit Src kinase to the receptor complex (25Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Ahn S. Khan K.D. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11312-11319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 26Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S. Daaka Y. Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Della Rocca G.J. Lin F. Kawakatsu H. Owada K. Luttrell D.K. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1999; 283: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar). Other reports have also observed the formation of a molecular complex between β-arrestin 1 and Src kinase in different cell systems (27Barlic J. Andrews J.D. Kelvin A.A. Bosinger S.E. DeVries M.E. Xu L.L. Dobransky T. Feldman R.D. Ferguson S.S.G. Kelvin D.J. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 28DeFea K.A. Vaughn Z.D. O'Bryan E.M. Nishijima D. Dery O. Bunnett N.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11086-11091Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). To determine whether β-arrestin 1 could play a similar role with the ETA receptor/Src kinase/glucose transport signaling cascade, we conducted co-immunoprecipitation experiments. As demonstrated in Fig.3 A, incubation with ET-1 (10 nm) stimulated β-arrestin 1 association with the ETA receptor by 4.5 ± 0.5-fold (at 3 min). To assess the functional role of β-arrestin 1 in this signaling system, we microinjected anti-β-arrestin 1 antibody into 3T3-L1 adipocytes followed by ET-1 treatment and measurement of GLUT4 translocation by immunofluorescence microscopy. As seen in Fig. 3 B, β-arrestin 1 antibody inhibited the effects of 1 and 10 nm ET-1 by 90 and 73%, respectively, but did not inhibit insulin stimulation. These results suggest that β-arrestin 1 may be necessary to recruit Src kinase into a molecular complex with the ETA receptor to effect tyrosine kinase signaling to Gαq/11 and glucose transport stimulation. β-Arrestin 1 binds to Src kinase, at least in part, through interactions of β-arrestin 1 with the Src kinase catalytic domain (25Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Ahn S. Khan K.D. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11312-11319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). To further evaluate the role of β-arrestin 1·Src kinase complexes in ET-1 signaling to glucose transport, we utilized a Src construct, SH1KD, containing only the catalytic domain (positions 250–536) with a point mutation in the ATP binding site (K298M), which disables kinase activity but does not impair association with β-arrestin 1 (25Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Ahn S. Khan K.D. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11312-11319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). This SH1KD Src construct does not contain the Src SH2 or SH3 domains and is a selective inhibitor of β-arrestin-mediated Src function. Thus, the SH1KD mutant should behave as a dominant negative inhibitor of β-arrestin 1/Src-mediated ET-1 signaling. The SH1KD plasmid was injected into the nuclei of 3T3-L1 adipocytes along with a green fluorescent protein expression vector to allow identification of the injected cells. As seen in Fig.4 A, expression of the SH1KD mutant effectively blocks ET-1-stimulated GLUT4 translocation, further indicating that formation of a β-arrestin 1·Src kinase complex, with stimulation of Src kinase activity, is necessary for this action of ET-1. There are a large number of c-Src family members, including c-Src, c-Fyn, and c-Yes, which are widely expressed (29Kefalas P. Brown T.R.P. Brickell P.M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 27: 551-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 30Meyerson G. Pahlman S. FEBS Lett. 1993; 332: 27-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 31Williams J.C. Wierenga R.K. Saraste M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 179-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). To determine which Src kinase family member is involved in ET-1 signaling to glucose transport, we microinjected several different Src family-specific antibodies with subsequent measurements of ET-1-induced GLUT4 translocation. To characterize these antibodies, we showed that each was able to inhibit (≈100%) the kinase activity of the respective Src kinase member in each antibody immunoprecipitate (data not shown). As seen in Fig. 4 B, microinjection of c-Src or c-Fyn antibody had no effect on GLUT4 translocation. However, c-Yes antibody injection had a potent effect to inhibit ET-1 signaling, whereas insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation was not impaired. To further assess the role of c-Yes in ET-1 signaling, we determined whether this Src kinase family member was associated with β-arrestin 1 and the ETA receptor. As seen in Fig. 4 C (left panels), ET-1 stimulated c-Yes association with the ETA receptor by 5.2 ± 0.7-fold, suggesting that c-Yes was recruited into a complex with the ETA receptor following ligand stimulation. We also found association of β-arrestin 1 with c-Yes, and this was unaffected by ET-1 stimulation (Fig. 4 C, right panels). It is interesting to note that both insulin and ET-1 stimulate Gαq/11 tyrosine phosphorylation and that this appears necessary for downstream signaling to glucose transport. For insulin action, tyrosine phosphorylation is known to mediate many important signaling events, but this is not the case for classical GPCR-induced Gα functions. On the other hand, precedence for such a mechanism does exist. For example, Umemori et al. (22Umemori H. Inoue T. Kume S. Sekiyama N. Nagao M. Itoh H. Nakanishi S. Mikoshiba K. Yamamoto T. Science. 1997; 276: 1878-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) reported that stimulation of a Gαq/11-coupled heptahelical receptor (a metabotropic glutamate receptor) resulted in Gαq/11tyrosine phosphorylation and that this phosphorylation event was necessary for activation of the Gαq/11 protein. Further, it is known that in addition to classical GPCR actions mediated through heterotrimeric G proteins, certain GPCRs convey mitogenic signals through the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway that are initiated by GPCR-mediated Src kinase activation (14van Biesen T. Luttrell L.M. Hawes B.E. Lefkowitz R.J. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 698-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 32Della Rocca G.J. van Biesen T. Daaka Y. Luttrell D.K. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19125-19132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Thus, since tyrosine phosphorylation is increasingly recognized as a GPCR-initiated event, it seems likely that phosphorylation of Gαq/11 is a mechanism that allows this G protein to direct signals from cell surface receptors to the GLUT4 translocation system. We have previously shown that insulin and ET-1 stimulate glucose transport through a Gαq/11-mediated process (10Imamura T. Ishibashi K. Dalle S. Ugi S. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33691-33695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and the current studies have further defined the molecular pathway of these ET-1 signaling events. We have shown that after agonist stimulation, the ETA receptor forms a molecular complex with β-arrestin 1 and the Src kinase c-Yes. This results in activation of Src kinase with phosphorylation of Gαq/11 and subsequent stimulation of GLUT4 translocation and glucose transport. In this respect, Gαq/11 represents a convergence point for the insulin and ET-1 signaling pathways, which lead to glucose transport stimulation. The mechanisms whereby these two receptors affect tyrosine phosphorylation of Gαq/11 differ, but the events downstream of this G protein that lead to glucose transport stimulation appear to be the same. The present results delineate a novel role of β-arrestin as a molecular link between GPCRs and Src family kinases to the regulation of glucose transport."

We have shown that decorin is causally involved in the formation of capillary-like structures and a decrease in apoptosis in endothelial cells cultured in a collagen lattice. Here we investigate signal transduction pathways mediating the effects of decorin. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that p21 and p27, two inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases, were up-regulated by decorin induction. Decorin also increased protein levels of p21 and caused its translocation into the nucleus. p21 synthesis started 6 h after decorin addition and reached a plateau after 18 h, while cyclin A, which was also induced, peaked at 12 h and declined below basal levels within 24 h. These effects were mediated by the Akt/protein kinase B pathway. Akt phosphorylation at Thr-308 increased 4-fold and at Ser-473 1.4-fold within 10 min after decorin addition. Overexpression of dominant negative Akt inhibited the decorin-mediated induction of p21 and cyclin A, but had no effect on p27. These results show that decorin is a signaling molecule in sprouting endothelial cells where it acts via different pathways, one of them involving Akt/protein kinase B.

Jain R.P. Nature. 2000; 407: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (7399) Google Scholar). The necessary changes in gene expression are finely tuned both by soluble factors and by molecules of the extracellular matrix (4Sweeney S.M. Guy C.A. Fields G.B. San Antonio J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7275-7280Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). While the interaction of soluble factors with cells is mediated by their specific receptor tyrosine kinases and serine/threonine kinases, matrix molecules may signal via integrins of the β1 subfamily and via αvβ3 or αvβ5 integrins. Growth factor receptors and integrins can activate similar intracellular signal transduction pathways. Among the most well studied pathways are the mitogen-activated kinase (MAPK)1 and the phosphoinositide 3-kinase, Akt/protein kinase B pathways (5Short S.M. Talbott G.A. Juliano R.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1969-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 6Fujio Y. Walsh K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16349-16354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). While the MAPK pathway mainly leads to cell proliferation, the Akt pathway has been shown to be important for cell differentiation. However, both pathways support cell survival. The functional state of endothelial cells (quiescent or angiogenic) correlates with the expression of specific small leucine-rich repeat proteoglycans. Resting endothelial cells in vivo as well as confluent endothelial cells in vitro (7Järveläinen H.T. Kinsella M.G. Wight T.N. Sandell L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23274-23281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) express biglycan, which becomes up-regulated when endothelial cell migration is stimulated (8Kinsella M, G. Tsoi C.K. Järveläinen H.T. Wight T.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 318-325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Similar observations were made in EA.hy 926, a cell line derived from human umbilical vein endothelial cells (9Nelimarkka L. Kainulainen V. Schönherr E. Moisander S. Jortikka M. Lammi M. Elenius K. Jalkanen M. Järveläinen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12730-12737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In contrast, sprouting endothelial cells express transiently the related proteoglycan decorin (10Järveläinen H, T Iruela-Arispe M.L. Kinsella M.G. Sandell L.J. Sage E.H. Wight T.N. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 203: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Decorin is the most well known member of the family of small proteoglycans characterized by core proteins with leucine-rich repeats. It is expressed by many different cell types and has been implicated in the control of collagen fibril formation and the regulation of tumor growth factor-β activity (see Refs. 11Iozzo R.V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 609-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar and 12Hocking A.M. Shinomura T. McQuillan D.J. Matrix Biol. 1998; 17: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar for reviews). More recently it has been shown that decorin can also directly influence cell behavior. In A431 squamous carcinoma cells, decorin binds to the EGF receptor and increases its phosphorylation, thereby leading to an activation of the MAPK pathway, mobilization of calcium, and up-regulation of p21, an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases (13Santra M.

In a breast carcinoma cell line, decorin caused a functional inactivation of ErbB2 via binding and activation of the ErbB4 receptor (17Santra M. Eichstetter I. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35153-35161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Recent investigations demonstrated the expression of decorin in human capillary endothelial during inflammation when angiogenesis occurs (18Schönherr E. O'Connell B.C. Schittny J. Robenek H. Fastermann D. Fisher L.W. Plenz G. Vischer P. Young M.F. Kresse H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 44-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar,19Nelimarkka L. Salminen H. Kuopio T. Nikkari S.

Furthermore, EA.hy 926 cells, a human umbilical vein-derived endothelial cell line, start to synthesize decorin when maintained in co-culture with a small number of fibroblasts in a floating collagen lattice, i.e. in an in vitro model of angiogenesis. Concomitantly, the cells align in cord-like structures on top of the collagen gel or form endothelial cell-lined cavities inside this matrix (18Schönherr E. O'Connell B.C. Schittny J. Robenek H. Fastermann D. Fisher L.W. Plenz G. Vischer P. Young M.F. Kresse H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 44-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). These morphological changes are accompanied by an induction and activation of specific matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-9, MMP-14; Ref. 20Schönherr E. Schaefer L. O'Connell B.C. Kresse H. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 187: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It could also be shown that endothelial cells synthesizing decorin escape apoptosis (18Schönherr E. O'Connell B.C. Schittny J. Robenek H. Fastermann D. Fisher L.W. Plenz G. Vischer P. Young M.F. Kresse H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 44-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). All these changes were not only observed in co-cultures, but also in cultures of endothelial cells that had been induced to synthesize decorin by infection with a replication-deficient adenovirus containing the human decorin cDNA. Thus, the expression of decorin is sufficient to induce differentiation of endothelial cells and to protect them from apoptosis. In this study we investigated how decorin influences different signaling pathways, which may lead to the survival and differentiation of endothelial cells. In EA.hy 926 cells decorin expression leads to a transient up-regulation of cyclin A and a prolonged up-regulation of p21 via an activation of the Akt pathway, which had not yet been linked with decorin. Another inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases, p27, is also induced by decorin, but by a not yet defined pathway. The following primary and secondary antibodies were used: rabbit anti-human decorin (21Hausser H. Ober B. Quentin-Hoffmann E. Schmidt G. Kresse H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11559-11564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), mouse anti-WAF1 (p21, Oncogene, Boston, MA), rabbit anti-phospho-MAPK (Erk1/2), rabbit anti-phospho-Akt-(Thr-308), rabbit anti-phospho-Akt-(Ser-473), rabbit anti-Akt (Cell Signaling Technologies, Beverly, MA), rabbit anti-cyclin A, anti-cyclin E, anti-cyclin D1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Heidelberg, Germany), mouse anti-β-tubulin (Sigma), goat anti-rabbit-IgG (Bio-Rad), and horse anti-mouse IgG (Alexis, Grüneberg, Germany), the latter two antibodies being coupled to horseradish peroxidase. As a specific inhibitor of EGF receptor phosphorylation Tyrphostin AG1478 (Alexis) was employed. EGF was purchased from TEBU (Frankfurt, Germany). Cells of the permanent human endothelial cell line EA.hy 926 (22Edgell C.J. McDonald C.C. Graham J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3734-3737Crossref PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar) were grown in MCDB 131 (Life Technologies, Eggenstein, Germany) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies), hypoxanthin/aminopterin/thymidine supplement (Life Technologies) and antibiotics. Rat fibroblasts were cultured as described (20Schönherr E. Schaefer L. O'Connell B.C. Kresse H. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 187: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). HUVECs were kept in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum as previously described (23Levkau B. Scatena M. Giachelli C.M. Ross R. Raines E.W. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Cultures of cells within floating collagen lattices were prepared as quoted previously (24Greve H. Blumberg P. Schmidt G. Schlumberger W. Rauterberg J. Kresse H. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Type I collagen from calf skin (1.5 mg; Sigma) and 500,000 EA.hy 926 cells with or without 50,000 rat fibroblasts were suspended in a final volume of 2.0 ml of Waymouth MAB 87/3 medium/1% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum per 3-cm hydrophobic plastic dish (Greiner, Solingen, Germany). Serum-free medium (1 ml) was added after 5 h at 37 °C. For culturing EA.hy 926 cells on a substratum of fibrillar collagen, 3-cm hydrophilic plastic dishes were coated with the collagen mixture described above and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min until a gel had formed. Then, 500,000 EA.hy 926 cells were plated on this substrate in 1 ml of Waymouth MAB 87/3 medium containing 1% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. After 5 h, 1 ml of medium without serum was added. For the investigation of contact-inhibited endothelial cells (HUVECs, EA.hy 926) 500,000 cells were cultured on 3-cm hydrophilic plastic dishes for 48 h in their respective growth medium and preincubated/stimulated with the indicated additives in 1 ml of medium for the respective times. EA.hy 926 (125,000 cells) were plated in 1.3 cm2 collagen-coated plastic dishes as described above. After 48 h, cells were stimulated with 100 µg/ml decorin for 24 h. Then 5 µCi/ml [methyl-3H]thymidine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were added for 2 h. For the determination of thymidine incorporation, cells were washed twice and then three times precipitated on ice with ice-cold 12.5% trichloroacetic acid for 1 h. The precipitates were solubilized with 10% SDS at room temperature and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. The radioactivity was normalized to the number of cell in unlabeled wells. If not otherwise stated, viral infections were performed as follows. EA.hy 926 cells, which had been plated the day before (1.5 × 106 cells/25 cm2 flask), were treated with 2 × 108 pfu of AdvDCN (18Schönherr E. O'Connell B.C. Schittny J. Robenek H. Fastermann D. Fisher L.W. Plenz G. Vischer P. Young M.F. Kresse H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 44-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) or with one of the control virus constructs, in 1 ml/25-cm2 flask of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. After 90 min of incubation, 4 ml of growth medium per 25-cm2 flask was added, and the incubation continued for an additional period of 23 h. In all experiments where cells were exposed to more than one type of adenovirus, 4 × 108 pfu were chosen as a final dosage, and the control virus (AdvCo, Adl312) was used for supplementation. The generation of adenoviruses harboring cDNAs for dominant negative (dnAdAkt) and dominant positive forms (myrAdAkt) of Akt, respectively, has been described before (6Fujio Y. Walsh K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16349-16354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from cells, embedded in or cultured on top of collagen lattices. The collagen gels were centrifuged to remove residual culture medium, and cells were lysed with the QIAshredder (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Total RNA was obtained by the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) as recommended by the manufacturer except that the purification column was eluted with 70 µl of H2O for better recovery. The relative quantification of gene expression by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR) was validated as described (25Winer J. Jung C.K.S. Shakel I. Williams P.M. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 270: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. cDNA synthesis was performed with Omniscript reverse transcriptase (Qiagen) and random primer (pd(N)6, Roche Diagnostics) and oligo(dT)16 (MWG Biotech). cDNA (50 ng) was incubated with SYBR Green PCR buffer, nucleotides, AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (PE Biosystems, Weiterstadt, Germany) and the primers for the different human genes listed in Table I(each 0.2 µm, final concentration). For semiquantitative analysis, 40 cycles (denaturation: 94 °C, 1 min; annealing and elongation: 60 °C, 1 min) were performed in a Perkin Elmer GeneAmp PCR System 9600 equipped with a GeneAmp 5700 Sequence Detection System for quantification of PCR products. Melting curves and agarose gel electrophoresis were used to verify the quality of PCR products. In independent RT-PCR quantifications of total RNA extracts, the results of triplicate analyses varied by maximally 20%. The data obtained were referred to standard curves obtained with plasmids containing authentic cDNAs of the genes under investigation. Finally, the values were normalized to the results of GAPDH-RT-PCR. Statistical analysis was performed with PrismTM, version 3 (GraphPad software, San Diego, CA).Table ISequences of primers used in semiquantitative RT-PCRsGene ProductPrimer sequenceProduct sizeDecorin5′-AGCTGAAGGAATTGCCAGAA-3′132 bp5′-TGGTGCCCAGTTCTATGACA-3′p215′-CTGCCCAAGCTCTACCTTCC-3′123 bp5′-CAGGTCCACATGGTCTTCCT-3′p275′-CCGGCTAACTCTGAGGACAC-3′120 bp5′-AGAAGAATCGTCGGTTGCAG-3′Akt5′-AGGTGCTGGAGGACAATGAC-3′132 bp5′-GAAGCGGATCTCTTCCATGA-3′GAPDH5′-GTCAGTGGTGGACCTGACCT-3′123 bp5′-ACCTGGTGCTCAGTGTAGCC-3′ Open table in a new tab For the detection of phosphorylated proteins, cells from a 3-cm dish were harvested in 100 µl of cold lysis buffer A (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 2 mm sodium vanadate) and sonicated. For the separation of nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions, the cells were scraped into cold phosphate-buffered saline and collected by centrifugation. The pellet was suspended in 100 µl of lysis buffer B (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 µg/ml aprotinin, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, 0.1% Nonidet P40) and solubilized by up and down pipetting for 5 min on ice. The nuclei were separated from the cytoplasm by centrifugation at 420 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. The pelleted nuclei were resuspended in 100 µl of lysis buffer B. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out under reducing conditions. Equal aliquots (150 µg of protein/lane for phosphoprotein detection, equal volumes of cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions) were applied onto 16.8% polyacrylamide gels. After transfer to nitrocellulose filters, nonspecific binding was blocked by overnight incubation with 3% casein, 1% normal goat serum, 0.02% Tween 20 in TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) at 4 °C. Incubations with primary antibodies and secondary antibodies were performed for 1 h at 37 °C in 1% bovine serum albumin in TBS. Three washing steps of 10 min with TBS were used after the first antibody incubation and six washing steps after the second incubation. Blots were treated with ECL reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions and exposed for various times to Kodak X-OMAT AR films (Kodak, Rochester). Bands were quantified with the ImageQuant 5.0 software program (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Metabolic labeling of proteoglycans with [35S]sulfate and immunoprecipitations with decorin-specific antibodies were carried out as previously described (21Hausser H. Ober B. Quentin-Hoffmann E. Schmidt G. Kresse H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11559-11564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously shown that EA.hy 926 endothelial cells, cultured in collagen lattices together with fibroblasts at a ratio of 10:1, start to synthesize decorin, form capillary-like structures, and escape apoptosis (18Schönherr E. O'Connell B.C. Schittny J. Robenek H. Fastermann D. Fisher L.W. Plenz G. Vischer P. Young M.F. Kresse H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 44-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). As decorin appears to mediate a more differentiated phenotype in tumor cells by induction of p21 (13Santra M. Skorski T. Calabretta B. Lattime E.C. Iozzo R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7016-7020Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 14Santra M. Mann D.M. Mercer E.W. Skorski T. Calabretta B. Iozzo R.V. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), we investigated the expression of p21 and of p27, a related inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases, under co-culture conditions when decorin was accumulating (Table II). Quantification of the respective proteins showed that p21 was increased 5.7-fold and p27 about 2-fold. This was due to the induction of the respective proteins in endothelial cells. Control cultures with the same number of fibroblasts, as used in co-culture experiments, did not contain sufficient protein for analysis. These results suggest that fibroblasts induce the differentiation and survival of endothelial cells by induction of inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases.Table IIEA.hy 926 cells in co-culture with rat fibroblasts induce the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitorsProteinEA.hy 926EA.hy 926 + rat fibroblastsOptical Units ± S.D.p212-aWestern blots from two different experiments and two independent determinations each were quantified.2.64 ± 0.6515.15 ± 2.28p272-aWestern blots from two different experiments and two independent determinations each were quantified.8.16 ± 0.1516.67 ± 0.612-a Western blots from two different experiments and two independent determinations each were quantified. Open table in a new tab As we previously observed that decorin induction in endothelial cells alone was sufficient to mimic the effects of fibroblasts (18Schönherr E. O'Connell B.C. Schittny J. Robenek H. Fastermann D. Fisher L.W. Plenz G. Vischer P. Young M.F. Kresse H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 44-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), EA.hy 926 cells were infected with an adenovirus harboring the cDNA of decorin (AdvDCN) and then embedded in a collagen lattice. Fig.1A shows that decorin synthesis in endothelial cells reached a maximum on the second day of culture in the collagen lattice. At the same time the mRNA and the protein (inset) of both inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases were increased (Fig.1B). Maximal induction of p21 (19-fold) and of p27 mRNA (14-fold) lasted for about 3 h (results not shown). However, a 3–4-fold increase in the expression of p21 was still observed after 6 days. In contrast, the expression of p27 declined rapidly to basal levels within 24 h (Fig. 1B). In tumor cells the induction of p21 is mediated by decorin-dependent phosphorylation of the EGF receptor (15Moscatello D.K. Santra M. Mann D.M. McQillan D.J. Wong A.J. Iozzo R.V. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). However, when EA.hy 926 cells were infected with AdvDCN as before and treated with Tyrphostin AG1478, a specific inhibitor of EGF receptor phosphorylation, the induction of p21 remained unchanged (Fig.2). On the basis of the observation that co-culture with fibroblasts is not required to provoke angiogenesis-related phenomena in EA.hy 926 cells, as long as the cells express decorin themselves, the experimental system was changed to facilitate the analysis of intracellular proteins. For this purpose, EA.hy 926 cells were plated on a fibrillar collagen substratum rather than maintained within a collagen lattice. Virus-mediated decorin expression yielded the same induction of p21 and p27 on the mRNA level as experiments with collagen lattices (results not shown). In addition, this culture system made it possible to study directly the influence of exogenously added decorin on protein expression. Western blots of nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions showed that both p21 (Fig. 3A) and p27 (results not shown) were induced dose dependently and translocated into the nucleus. Induction of p21 was first seen after 6 h and reached a plateau 18–24 h after decorin addition (Fig. 3B). p27 was also induced and had a peak at 18 h. Not only cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, but also different cyclins were tested for induction by decorin. Only cyclin A, not E or D1 was increased after virus-mediated decorin induction (results not shown). Similarly, only cyclin A was increased 12 h after decorin addition but declined below basal levels after 24 h (Fig. 3B). When [3H]thymidine incorporation 24 h after decorin addition was determined and compared with control cells, decorin decreased the incorporation from 1090 ± 40 cpm/106cells (n = 6) to only 676 ± 57 cpm/106cells (n = 6), respectively. These results suggest that decorin may be involved in the coordination of signals, which ultimately lead to the inhibition of G1 to S phase transition in the cell cycle and possibly to differentiation (26Zhang P. Curr. Opinion Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 655-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In a further set of experiments we investigated whether EA.hy 926 cells and their parental HUVECs react similarly to decorin. As HUVECs cannot be kept under serum-free conditions for longer periods, comparative experiments were performed with contact-inhibited cells in the presence of serum, a situation where endothelial cells normally do not synthesize decorin. Phosphorylation of the MAPKs Erk1/2 (p42/44) after addition of EGF or decorin (15Moscatello D.K. Santra M. Mann D.M. McQillan D.J. Wong A.J. Iozzo R.V. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) was used as indicator of cell activation, and the inhibition by tyrphostin AG1478 served as an indicator of EGF receptor involvement (Fig.4). These experiments showed that contact-inhibited HUVECs as well as EA.hy 926 can be stimulated by EGF and by decorin. However, decorin stimulation is independent of EGF receptor phosphorylation in both cell types (Fig. 4A). When cells are cultured on a collagen lattice, which inevitably is accompanied by a partial activation through the interaction of integrins with collagen (27Moro L. Venturino M. Bozzo C. Silengo L. Altruda F. Beguinot L. Tarone G. Defilippi P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6622-6632Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar) but resembles much more the conditions during angiogenesis, Erk1/2 is already phosphorylated in EA.hy 926 cells, and EGF causes a further increase in phosphorylation while decorin has no such effect and may even lead to a decreased Erk1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 4B). These results show that in endothelial cells, the EGF receptor is not required for the effects of decorin. Other kinases like p38 MAPK and the stress-activated protein kinase Jun N-terminal kinase were also not phosphorylated after decorin addition (results not shown). Therefore, other signaling pathways upstream of p21, p27, and cyclin A modulation were investigated. In squamous carcinoma cells it was shown that decorin as well as EGF can induce a calcium influx (16Patel S. Santra M. McQillan D.J. Iozzo R.V. Thomas A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3121-3124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). To investigate whether an analogous situation can be found in EA.hy 926 cells, the cells were kept on collagen-coated coverslips for 24 h prior to decorin addition (100 µg/ml). In three independent experiments no calcium signal was observed within 30 min after decorin addition, while the cells responded normally to histamine (results not shown). Thus, changes in calcium fluxes are not involved in early decorin-mediated signaling pathways. As in endothelial cells grown on a collagen substratum the MAPK pathway is not involved in decorin signal transduction, other signaling pathways, which can also affect cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, were considered. One such pathway involves the activation of protein kinase Akt (28Lawlor M.A. Rotwein P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 23: 8983-8995Crossref Scopus (164) Google Scholar). To test whether Akt is involved in decorin signaling, EA.hy 926 were plated on collagen and stimulated with decorin (100 µg/ml) for 10 min. Western blots showed a 4-fold increase in phosphorylation of Thr-308 and a 1.4-fold increase in phosphorylation of Ser-473 of Akt protein when the bands were normalized to total enzyme applied (Fig.5). Phosphorylation declined within the following 20 min in spite of the continuous presence of decorin. In addition, when EA.hy 926 cells were infected with AdvDCN and cultured on collagen, Akt mRNA expression was increased 69-fold when decorin expression peaked, indicating that decorin does not only activate Akt by increasing its phosphorylation, but also causes a dramatic elevation of its transcriptional level. To test whether Akt mediates the effect of decorin, we co-transfected endothelial cells with an adenovirus carrying an Akt mutated in the activating phosphorylation sites (T308A, S473A). This dominant negative Akt mutant strongly inhibited the decorin-induced increase in p21 mRNA levels (94%). Interestingly, the expression of p27 was not affected at all (Fig. 6). On the protein level, a 2.9-fold increase in p21 after infection with AdvDCN contrasted with an 89% reduction of this effect when dominant negative Akt was simultaneously expressed (results not shown). Expression of dominant positive Akt resulted in a 9.9-fold increase in p21 protein (results not shown). In further experiments it was tested whether the decorin-mediated increase in cyclin A is also Akt dependent. As a control for the specificity of the decorin/Akt effect also Western blots for the cyclins E and D1 were performed, which showed that decorin can only induce cyclin A and that this induction is also mediated by Akt (Fig. 7).Figure 7Effect of decorin on cyclin expression.Endothelial cells were treated as described in Fig. 6. Cell lysates were isolated after 2 days and separated by SDS-PAGE. Cyclin A, E, and D1 were detected with specific antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) This study extends the signaling function of decorin to endothelial cells while previous studies have focused on carcinoma cells (17Santra M. Eichstetter I. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35153-35161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 29De Luca A. Santra M. Baldi A. Giordano A. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18961-18965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). More importantly, it is also shown that the action of decorin is exerted via different pathways in endothelial and epithelial cells. All of these studies demonstrated an up-regulation of p21 as a consequence of the presence of decorin. However, whereas in tumor cells the binding of decorin to the EGF receptor is the initiating event (15Moscatello D.K. Santra M. Mann D.M. McQillan D.J. Wong A.J. Iozzo R.V. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar,29De Luca A. Santra M. Baldi A. Giordano A. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18961-18965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), in EA.hy 926 cells and HUVECs the EGF receptor appeared not to be involved because of the following findings. Tyrphostin AG1478, a specific inhibitor of this receptor, did not lead to a down-regulation of decorin-mediated p21 expression, and it did not decrease decorin-mediated Erk1/2 phosphorylation in contact-inhibited HUVECs or EA.hy 926 cells. Furthermore, in partially activated EA.hy 926 cells cultured on collagen, Erk1/2 phosphorylation was not affected or even decreased by exogenously added decorin. These data do not rule out, however, that decorin binds to ErbB4, another member of the EGF receptor family, which is expressed in EA.hy 926 cells (results not shown) but cannot be inhibited by tyrphostin AG1478. Another receptor candidate is the proposed endocytosis receptor for small proteoglycans which is present on endothelial cell (30Götte M. Kresse H. Hausser H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 66: 226-233PubMed Google Scholar), but whose signaling function has not yet been elucidated. Further candidates for participants in the decorin-induced signal cascade are integrins, as integrin-mediated activation of focal adhesion kinase can lead to Erk1/2 activation either via EGF receptor phosphorylation or via association of integrins with caveolin. This pathway can also lead to the activation of Akt signal transduction, especially when the number of EGF receptors is low (27Moro L. Venturino M. Bozzo C. Silengo L. Altruda F. Beguinot L. Tarone G. Defilippi P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6622-6632Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). In tumor cells overexpressing the EGF receptor, the MAPK pathway and calcium influx have been shown to be involved in decorin signaling (15Moscatello D.K. Santra M. Mann D.M. McQillan D.J. Wong A.J. Iozzo R.V. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar,16Patel S. Santra M. McQillan D.J. Iozzo R.V. Thomas A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3121-3124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, these pathways are not used in endothelial cells cultured on fibrillar collagen, i.e. under conditions resembling the situation during angiogenesis when decorin is expressed by endothelial cells in vivo. Instead, Akt and other not yet identified pathways become activated. In endothelial cells, decorin addition caused a transient phosphorylation of Akt within only 10 min, indicating that this is an early signal in this pathway. A likely candidate for upstream activation of Akt is the phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate-dependent kinase-1. This kinase prefers Thr-308 to Ser-473 of Akt for phosphorylation (31Downward J. Curr. Opinion Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar), which is consistent with the stronger phosphorylation of Akt on Thr-308 than Ser-473 that we found in our system. However, the existence of other upstream signals, which link Akt to a decorin receptor remain still to be elucidated. Interestingly, long term exposure to decorin, as in cells infected with an adenovirus containing decorin, led to an up-regulation of Akt mRNA, which in turn could amplify Akt-dependent signaling pathways. Knowledge about the transcriptional control of the different kinases of the Akt family is presently very limited except that the enzymes are overexpressed in certain tumor cells (31Downward J. Curr. Opinion Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar). It has been shown that Akt can directly inhibit apoptosis by activation of downstream signals as the phosphorylation of endothelial NO synthase (32Michell B.J. Griffiths J.E. Mitchelhill K.I. Rodriguez-Crespo I. Tiganis T. Bozinovski S. de Montellano P.R. Kemp B.E. Pearson R.B. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 845-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar), the inhibition of caspase 9 (33Hermann C. Assmus B. Urbich C. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 402-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), and the phosphorylation of Bad, a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family of apoptosis regulators (34Datta S.R Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3714) Google Scholar). Also p21 has been shown before to become induced by Akt and to promote cell survival, e.g. in myoblasts (28Lawlor M.A. Rotwein P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 23: 8983-8995Crossref Scopus (164) Google Scholar). p21 is also involved in cell differentiation. For example, growth arrest and differentiation of myocytes to myotubes depends on the expression of p21 (35Fujio Y. Guo K. Mano T. Mitsuuchi Y. Testa J.R. Walsh K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5073-5082Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Analogously, proliferating endothelial cells have to withdraw from the cell cycle upon capillary tube formation. This can be seen in EA.hy 926 cells when 24 h after decorin addition the activator of cyclin-dependent kinase 2, cyclin A, becomes down-regulated and the inhibitor p21 becomes up-regulated, and concomitantly thymidine incorporation is decreased. The transient increase in cyclin A, observed 12 h after decorin addition, does not contradict the initiation of differentiation, as it has been shown in U937 cells that cyclin A can shortly become up-regulated during differentiation (36Rots Y.N. Iavarone A. Bromleigh V. Freedman L.P. Blood. 1999; 93: 2721-2729Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the increase of p21 and the concomitant down-regulation of cyclin A in endothelial cells could explain the effects of decorin expression on angiogenesis. Another inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases that is induced by decorin is p27. The function of this inhibitor has been mainly attributed to the induction of senescence in different types of cells (37Collado M. Medema R.H. Garcia-Cao I. Dubuisson M.L. Barradas M. Glassford J. Rivas C. Burgering B.M. Serrano M. Lam E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21960-21968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). However, during myogenesis p27 can compensate the lack of p21 (35Fujio Y. Guo K. Mano T. Mitsuuchi Y. Testa J.R. Walsh K. Mol. Cell.

How p27 is induced in endothelial cells is not fully understood. An increased p27 content was found in contact-inhibited differentiated endothelial cells (39Chen D. Walsh K. Wang J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In our system, decorin led to an only transient induction of p27, and this induction was not regulated by the activation of Akt. However, p27 may serve as an additional signal to inhibit apoptosis of endothelial cells. In summary, our data show that decorin has not only a variety of different functions within the extracellular matrix (e.g.regulation of collagen fibrillogenesis, TGF-β binding), but can also directly affect specific signal transduction pathways, thereby either primarily influencing growth control or differentiation and apoptosis. Further studies are needed to investigate the complete potential of this really multifunctional proteoglycan. We thank Drs. S. Schneider and A. Niemeyer (Institute of Physiology, University of Münster) for their help in studying calcium fluxes in endothelial cells. The excellent technical assistance of M. Bahl is gratefully acknowledged."

Although PEX5 is not involved in the import of PTS2-targeted proteins in yeast, it is essential for PTS2 protein import in mammalian cells. Human cells generate two isoforms of PEX5 through alternative splicing, PEX5S and PEX5L, and PEX5L contains an additional insert 37 amino acids long. Only one isoform, PEX5L, is involved in PTS2 protein import, and PEX5L physically interacts with PEX7, the import receptor for PTS2-containing proteins. In this report we map the regions of human PEX5L involved in PTS2 protein import, PEX7 interaction, and targeting to peroxisomes. These studies revealed that amino acids 1–230 of PEX5L are required for PTS2 protein import, amino acids 191–222 are sufficient for PEX7 interaction, and amino acids 1–214 are sufficient for targeting to peroxisomes. We also identified a 21-amino acid-long peptide motif of PEX5L, amino acids 209–229, that overlaps the regions sufficient for full PTS2 rescue activity and PEX7 interaction and is shared by Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pex18p and Pex21p, two yeast peroxins that act only in PTS2 protein import in yeast. A mutation in PEX5 that changes a conserved serine of this motif abrogates PTS2 protein import in mammalian cells and reduces the interaction of PEX5L and PEX7 in vitro. This peptide motif also lies within regions of Pex18p and Pex21p that interact with yeast PEX7. Based on these and other results, we propose that mammalian PEX5L may have acquired some of the functions that yeast Pex18p and/or Pex21p perform in PTS2 protein import. This hypothesis may explain the essential role of PEX5L in PTS2 protein import in mammalian cells and its lack of importance for PTS2 protein import in yeast.

Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 761-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Studies in human cells, Chinese hamster ovary cells, and transgenic mice have also established that mammalian PEX5 is expressed in at least two forms, PEX5L and PEX5S, which are generated by alternative splicing of a single PEX5 gene (27Dodt G.

PEX5L also differs from PEX5S in that it can rescue PTS2 protein import in PEX5-deficient cells at a high frequency (64Braverman N. Dodt G. Gould S.J. Valle D. Hum. Mol.

J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21703-21714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). These and other results have led to the hypothesis that PEX5L plays an essential role in PTS2 protein import and that this role involves binding to PEX7 and facilitating PEX7 transport to peroxisomes (66Otera H.

However, many issues remain to be addressed regarding the role of PEX5L in PTS2 protein import. In this report, we have identified sequences of PEX5L that are necessary for PTS2 protein import, interaction with PEX7, and transport to peroxisomes. We also identified a short peptide motif shared by PEX5L and the Saccharomyces cerevisiaeperoxins Pex18p and Pex21p, which participate only in PTS2 protein import. These and other results raise the possibility that PEX5L may represent a functional and structural homolog of the yeast peroxins Pex18p and Pex21p. The human skin fibroblast cell lines were kindly provided by A. B. Moser and H. W. Moser (Kennedy Krieger Institute, Baltimore, MD). All cell lines were transformed with the large T-antigen of SV40 virus as described previously (27Dodt G. Braverman N. Wong C. Moser A. Moser H.W. Watkins P. Valle D. Gould S.J. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100,000 units/liter penicillin, and 100 mg/liter streptomycin at 9% CO2. Wild-type cells have normal PTS1 and PTS2 protein import. PBD005 cells are homozygous for a mutation in PEX5, R390ter, and do not import detectable levels of PTS1 or PTS2 proteins (55Gould S.J.

PBD054 cells are homozygous for a mutation in PEX12, S320F, have detectable PTS1 and PTS2 protein import, and import PEX5 into peroxisomes (55Gould S.J. Reymond G. Valle D. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. McGraw Hill Inc., New York2001: 3181-3218Google Scholar). PBD061 cells lack peroxisome membranes, and are homozygous for a mutation in PEX16, R176ter (55Gould S.J. Reymond G. Valle D. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D.

Transfections of fibroblasts were performed by electroporation using the protocol outlined by Chang et al. (67Chang C.C. Lee W.H. Moser H. Valle D. Gould S.J. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 385-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) or using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies) according to the manufacture’s suggestions. Two days after transfection the cells were processed for indirect immunofluorescence microscopy as described in Slawecki et al. (68Slawecki M.L. Dodt G. Steinberg S. Moser A.B. Moser H. Gould S.J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1817-1829Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Standard permeabilization was for 5 min with 1% Triton X-100, which permeabilizes both plasma and peroxisome membranes. Differential permeabilization was for 5 min with 25 μg/ml digitonin, which permeabilizes the plasma membrane but does not permeabilize the peroxisome membrane. The micrographs were made using a Zeiss Axiophot microscope and Kodak Ektachrome Elite 400 or TMAX 400 film. Polyclonal sheep anti-human catalase antibodies were obtained from The Binding Site. Polyclonal rabbit anti-GFP antibodies were purchased fromCLONTECH. The monoclonal anti-myc (9E10) antibodies (69Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar) were prepared by ammonium sulfate precipitation (25–50%, w/v) and diafiltration from serum-free cell culture supernatants. Cy3- and Cy2-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from Dianova. Other fluorescent antibodies were purchased from Jackson Immunochemicals. Antibodies against chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) were obtained from 5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc. (Boulder, CO). Anti-PEX5 antibodies were generated in rabbits against a recombinant His6-tagged version of PEX5L. The plasmid encoding full-length PEX5L, an N-terminal hexahistidinyl (His6) tag and a tobacco etch virus protease cleavage side in a derivative of pET9d (Novagen) has been described before (70Schliebs W.

This plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3), and recombinant PEX5L protein was purified under native conditions according to Schliebs et al. (70Schliebs W. Saidowsky J. Agianian B.

EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3255-3262Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar) expression vectors have been described. The remaining PEX5 expression plasmids used in the PTS1 and PTS2 protein import and targeting studies (see Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, and7) are derivatives of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). These constructs were named based on the region of PEX5 encoded by a particular plasmid. The PEX5 coding region in each of these constructs was cloned into the HindIII and BamHI sites in pcDNA3 in-frame with an 11-amino acid c-myc epitope tag (for the sequence of the tag, see below) located between the BamHI and XbaI sites. For example, PEX5L/1–335myc encodes amino acids 1–335 of the long isoform of PEX5 whereas PEX5S/1–298myc encodes amino acids 1–298 of the short isoform of PEX5 both in front of the myc tag. The same system of nomenclature applies to PEX5L/1–300myc and PEX5S/1–263myc, PEX5L/1–264myc and PEX5S/1–227myc, PEX5L/48–639myc and PEX5S/48–602myc, PEX5L/1–241myc, PEX5L/1–230myc, PEX5L/1–222myc, PEX5L/1–214myc, PEX5L/1–157myc, and PEX5L/1–90myc.Figure 2The N-terminal but not the C-terminal region of PEX5L is required for PTS2 import. PBD005 cells were co-transfected with the constructs expressing the various PEX5 proteins shown in e and with the plasmid expressing PTS2-CAT. After 2 days the cells were processed for double-indirect immunofluorescence microscopy with anti-CAT antibodies (a, c) and anti-PMP70 antibodies (b, d). PEX5S/1–227myc (a, b) did not rescue PTS2 import (a) whereas the long isoform of that protein, PEX5L/1–264myc (c, d), does restore PTS2 import (c).White boxes represent the six TPR domains involved in PTS1 binding.

Foxa1 has been shown to be required for glucagon secretion in the pancreas, whereas Foxa2 is critical for the regulation of insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cells. Here we address the role of Foxa3 in the maintenance of glucose homeostasis. Mice homozygous for a null mutation in Foxa3appear normal under fed conditions. However, when fasted,Foxa3 −/− mice have a significantly lower blood glucose compared with control mice. The fasting hypoglycemia inFoxa3 −/− mice could not be attributed to defects in pancreatic hormone secretion, ketone production, or hepatic glycogen breakdown. Surprisingly, mRNA levels for several gluconeogenic enzymes were up-regulated appropriately in fastedFoxa3 −/− mice, despite the fact that the corresponding genes had been shown to be activated by FOXA proteins in vitro. However, the mRNA for the plasma membrane glucose transporter GLUT2 was decreased by 64% in the fasted and 93% in the fed state, suggesting that efflux of newly synthesized glucose is limiting in Foxa3 −/− hepatocytes. Thus, Foxa3 is the dominating transcriptional regulator of GLUT2 expression in hepatocytes in vivo. In addition, we investigated the hepatic transcription factor network inFoxa3 −/− mice and found that the normal activation of HNF-4α, HNF-1α, and PGC-1 induced by fasting is attenuated in mice lacking Foxa3.

For example, the promoters of three key gluconeogenic enzymes, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), and 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (F2,6BPase), contain FOXA binding sites (15Wang J.C.

In addition, the glucocorticoid response of PEPCK is dependent on the binding of FOXA proteins to one of the accessory elements in its promoter region (15Wang J.C. Stromstedt P.E. O'Brien R.M.

Here we report that Foxa3 is required for the maintenance of glucose homeostasis during a prolonged fast and for the metabolic regulation of the hepatic transcription factor network. We also show that Foxa3 is the dominant regulator of GLUT expression in the liver, suggesting that reduced efflux of glucose from hepatocytes contributes to the relative hypoglycemia observed in fastedFoxa3 −/− mice.

Regarding the mechanism by which BCL-2 prevents cell death, one theory suggests that it acts by protecting cells from oxidative stress. In the lens system, oxidative stress-induced apoptosis is implicated in cataractogenesis. To explore the possibility of anti-apoptotic gene therapy development for cataract prevention and also to further test the anti-oxidative stress theory of BCL-2 action, we have introduced the human bcl-2 gene into an immortalized rabbit lens epithelial cell line, N/N1003A. The stable expression clones of both vector- and bcl-2-transfected cells have been established. Treatment of the two cell lines with H2O2 revealed thatbcl-2-transfected cells were less capable of detoxifying H2O2 than the control cells. Moreover,bcl-2-transfected cells are more susceptible to H2O2-induced apoptosis. To explore whybcl-2-transfected cells have reduced resistance to H2O2-induced apoptosis, we examined the expression patterns of several relevant genes and found that expression of the αB-crystallin gene was distinctly down-regulated inbcl-2-transfected cells compared with that in vector-transfected cells. This down-regulation was specific because a substantial inhibition of BCL-2 expression through antisensebcl-2 RNA significantly restored the level of αB-crystallin and, moreover, enhanced the ability of thebcl-2-transfected cells against H2O2-induced apoptosis. Introduction of a mouse αB-crystallin gene into bcl-2-transfected cells also counteracted the BCL-2 effects. Down-regulation of αB-crystallin gene was largely derived from changed lens epithelial cell-derived growth factor activity. Besides, αB-crystallin prevents apoptosis through interaction with procaspase-3 and partially processed procaspase-3 to prevent caspase-3 activation.

Since then, BCL-2 has been shown to prevent cell death induced by a large number of factors such as calcium ionophore, serum and growth factor depletion, and γ-irradiation (reviewed in Refs. 8Korsmeyer S.J.

Valentine J.S. Ord T. Bredesen D.E. Science. 1993; 262: 1274-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar). BCL-2 could either reduce cellular generation of reactive oxygen compounds or block the activity of these compounds after they are formed (11Hockenbery D.M. Oltvai Z.N. Yin X.M. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 241-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3281) Google Scholar, 12Kane D.J. Sarafian T.A. Anton R. Hahn H. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. Ord T. Bredesen D.E.

Supportive evidence for this theory comes from the finding that in certain cell lines, bcl-2-transfected cells show greater resistance to various pro-oxidant treatment than mock-transfected cells (13Sarafian T.A.

Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 1021-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar).However, in other cell lines, expression of BCL-2 does not protect the transfected cells against oxidative stress and oxidative stress-induced apoptosis (19Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 5407-5411PubMed Google Scholar, 20Lee Y-J. Shacter E. Blood. 1997; 89: 4480-4492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Why BCL-2 does not protect against oxidative stress-induced apoptosis in these cells remains largely unknown. Furthermore, it is also reported that oxygen depletion has no effect on the induction of apoptosis and that BCL-2 protects against apoptosis without inhibiting the production or activity of reactive oxygen compounds (21Shimizu S. Eguchi Y. Kosaka H. Kamiike W. Matsuda H. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1995; 374: 811-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar, 22Jacobson M.D. Raff M.C. Nature. 1995; 374: 814-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). Thus, depending on the types of cells and also the intracellular metabolic status, BCL-2 may provide protection through different mechanisms.To study the mechanism by which BCL-2 prevents stress-induced apoptosis in the lens system, we have introduced the human bcl-2 gene into rabbit lens epithelial cells, N/N1003A (23Reddan J.R. Cheplinsky A.B. Dziedzic D.C. Piatigorsky J. Goldenberg E.M. Differentiation. 1986; 33: 168-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). By using the established stable expression lines, pSFFV-N/N1003A (vector-transfected) and pSFFV-BCL-2-N/N1003A (bcl-2-transfected), we found that thebcl-2-transfected cells had an attenuated ability to metabolize H2O2 and to resist H2O2-induced apoptosis compared with the vector-transfected cells. To understand this attenuation, we have examined expression of several relevant genes in these two types of cells. Whereas expression of the anti-oxidative stress genes was hardly changed, expression of the endogenous αB-crystallin gene was significantly down-regulated. This down-regulation is specific as demonstrated with antisense inhibition of BCL-2 expression. When BCL-2 expression is substantially inhibited through antisensebcl-2 RNA, the endogenous αB-crystallin in these double-transfected cells is significantly restored. Restoration of αB-crystallin expression enhanced the ability of the cells to resist H2O2-induced apoptosis. Moreover, an exogenous mouse αB-crystallin gene introduced into bcl-2-transfected cells also counteracted the BCL-2 effects. To understand how BCL-2 may down-regulate expression of αB-crystallin gene, we have examined the DNA binding activity of LEDGF,1 a positive regulator of αB-crystallin (24Singh D.P. Fatma N. Kimura A. Chylack Jr., L.T. Shinohara T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 943-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 25Singh D.P. Ohguro N. Chylack Jr., L.T. Shinohara T. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1999; 40: 1444-1451PubMed Google Scholar), in vector- andbcl-2-transfected cells. Our results revealed that the DNA binding activity of LEDGF was also substantially down-regulated in BCL-2 expression cells. Moreover, overexpression of LEDGF in BCL-2 expression cells substantially up-regulated the level of αB-crystallin. To understand the mechanism why αB-crystallin prevents apoptosis, we have conducted immunoprecipitation-linked Western blot analysis. Our results revealed that αB-crystallin prevents induced apoptosis through interaction with both procaspase-3 and partially processed procaspase-3. Taken together, our results demonstrate that BCL-2 can down-regulate expression of the αB-crystallin gene in rabbit lens epithelial cells through modulating transactivity of LEDGF and possibly other transcription factors. Through down-regulated expression of αB-crystallin, which prevents apoptosis by preventing caspase-3 activation, BCL-2 attenuates the ability of N/N1003A cells to resist oxidative stress-induced apoptosis. Thus, our results reveal a unique mechanism explaining why BCL-2 is unable to prevent oxidative stress-induced apoptosis in these cells.DISCUSSIONIn the present communication, we have demonstrated the following. 1) BCL-2, when expressed in rabbit lens epithelial cells, can protect the transfected cells from apoptosis induced by a general protein kinase inhibitor, staurosporine, and also by a topoisomerase I inhibitor, camptothecin, suggesting that the expressed BCL-2 is functional in the lens epithelial cells. 2) BCL-2 expression cells are less capable of metabolizing H2O2 and of resisting H2O2-induced apoptosis. Thus, in lens cells, BCL-2 prevents apoptosis in certain non-anti-oxidative stress pathway. 3) BCL-2 can specifically down-regulate expression of the αB-crystallin gene. 4) The down-regulation of αB-crystallin gene is largely derived from changed activity of LEDGF. 5) The down-regulation of αB-crystallin gene leads to attenuation of the BCL-2-transfected cells against H2O2-induced apoptosis. 6) αB-crystallin prevents apoptosis by interacting with procaspase-3 and partially processed procaspase-3 to repress caspase-3 activation.The Protective Role of BCL-2The protective role of BCL-2 has been documented extensively (8Korsmeyer S.J. Blood. 1992; 80: 879-886Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Reed J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (2386) Google Scholar, 10Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3238) Google Scholar) in many different cell and tissue types. Regarding the protection mechanism, one of the theories suggests that BCL-2 prevents cells from apoptosis by protecting them from oxidative stress. The supportive evidence is 2-fold. First, a number of laboratories have reported (11Hockenbery D.M. Oltvai Z.N. Yin X.M. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 241-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3281) Google Scholar, 12Kane D.J. Sarafian T.A. Anton R. Hahn H. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. Ord T. Bredesen D.E.

Cohen G.M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 58-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) that bcl-2-transfected cells show a greater resistance to various pro-oxidant treatments than the mock-transfected cells. Second, antioxidants protect some cells from apoptosis induced by non-oxidative reagents (16Slater A.F. Nobel C.S.I. Maellaro E. Bustamante J. Kimland M. Orrenius S. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 771-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 17Greenlund L.J.S. Dechwerth T.L. Johnson Jr., E.M.

Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 1021-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar).In the lens, oxidative stress and oxidative stress-induced apoptosis are implicated in cataractogenesis (31Li D.W-C. Kuszak J.R. Dunn K. Wang R-R. Ma W.-C. Wang G.-M. Spector A. Leib M. Cotliar A.M. Weiss M. Espy J. Howard G. Farns R.L. Auran J. Donn A. Hofeldt A. Mackay C. Merriam J. Mittl R. Smith T.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 169-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 50Giblin F.J. McCready J.P. Schrimscher L. Reddy V.N. Exp.

Spector A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1996; 20: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Prevention of stress-induced apoptosis may lead to potential gene therapy strategy against cataractogenesis. Thus, we have studied the mechanism of BCL-2 action for two reasons. First, if BCL-2 could prevent oxidative stress-induced apoptosis in the lens, it would be a candidate for gene therapy in preventing cataractogenesis. Second, exploration of the BCL-2 action in lens cells may contribute to clarification of whether BCL-2 prevents apoptosis through anti-oxidative stress pathway. For these purposes, we have introduced the human bcl-2 gene into rabbit lens epithelial cells and established the stable line expressing hBcl-2. A mock control cell line transfected with the same vector was also established. When the two cell lines were subjected to treatment of H2O2 at pathological concentrations in the eye as previously suggested (53Spector A. Garner W.H. Exp. Eye Res. 1981; 33: 673-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), we found that thebcl-2-transfected cells are less capable of detoxifying H2O2 than the control cells. Moreover, we found that bcl-2-transfected cells were more susceptible to H2O2-induced apoptosis when they were treated with a concentration previously shown to induce apoptosis of lens epithelial cells (31Li D.W-C. Kuszak J.R. Dunn K. Wang R-R. Ma W.-C. Wang G.-M. Spector A. Leib M. Cotliar A.M. Weiss M. Espy J. Howard G. Farns R.L. Auran J. Donn A. Hofeldt A. Mackay C. Merriam J. Mittl R. Smith T.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 169-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Our results are consistent with cell lines such as EW-36 (19Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 5407-5411PubMed Google Scholar, 20Lee Y-J. Shacter E. Blood. 1997; 89: 4480-4492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but different from the results in other cell lines such as mouse neural cell line (11Hockenbery D.M. Oltvai Z.N. Yin X.M. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 241-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3281) Google Scholar) or Pro-B-cell line (12Kane D.J. Sarafian T.A. Anton R. Hahn H. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. Ord T. Bredesen D.E. Science. 1993; 262: 1274-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar). Such differences among different cell lines may reflect the intracellular property of these cell lines or the functional status of the expressed BCL-2 protein. To confirm that human BCL-2 is functional in rabbit lens epithelial cells, we subjected the bcl-2- and vector-transfected cells to staurosporine and camptothecin treatment, both previously shown to induce typical apoptosis (41Ishizaki Y. Jacobson M.D. Raff M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 42Andersson M. Sjostrand J. Petersen A. Honarvar A.K. Karlsson J.O. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 2623-2632PubMed Google Scholar, 43Walton M.I. Whysong D. O'Connor P.M. Hockenbery D. Korsmeyer S.J. Kohn K.W. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1853-1861PubMed Google Scholar, 44Sanchez-Alcazar J.A. Ault J.G. Khodjakov A. Schneider E. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 1090-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). As expected, the bcl-2-transfected cells were more resistant to staurosporine- and camptothecin-induced apoptosis than the vector-transfected cells. Thus, our results suggest that BCL-2 prevents apoptosis in a non-anti-oxidative stress pathway in lens cells.Next we explored why BCL-2 expression cells were less capable of degrading H2O2 and more susceptible to H2O2-induced apoptosis. One of the possibilities tested is whether overexpression of BCL-2 in rabbit lens epithelial cells could down-regulate expression of the anti-oxidative genes as indirectly shown in the BCL-2 knockout mice (54Hochman A. Liang H. Offen D. Melamed E. Sternin H. Cell. Mol. Biol. 2000; 46: 41-52PubMed Google Scholar). Hochmanet al. (54Hochman A. Liang H. Offen D. Melamed E. Sternin H. Cell. Mol. Biol. 2000; 46: 41-52PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that in the liver of the knockout mice, the activities for both catalase and glutathione are substantially increased over that in wild type mice as postnatal development proceeds, suggesting that BCL-2 may down-regulate expression of these enzymes in the wild type animal. Northern blot was conducted to analyze the expression of the genes encoding catalase and glutathione peroxidase, both of which are the major enzymes responsible for detoxifying H2O2 (55Spector A. Yang Y. Ho Y.-S. Magnenat J.-L. Wang R.-R. Ma W. Li D.W-C. Exp. Eye Res. 1996; 62: 521-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Our results revealed hardly any difference in the mRNA levels for the two enzymes between bcl-2-transfected and vector-transfected cells, thus excluding the possibility of differential expression of the anti-oxidative genes.In the lens, another set of important proteins involved in cellular protection is the lens crystallin, especially the α-crystallin. In the rabbit lens epithelial cells, previous studies (49Krausz E. Augusteyn R.C. Quinlan R.A. Reddan J.R. Russell P. Sax C.M. Graw J. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1996; 37: 2120-2128PubMed Google Scholar) have revealed that β- and γ-crystallins are not expressed in this cell line. Regarding α-crystallins, only αB-crystallin is expressed. Therefore, we analyzed the expression of the αB-crystallin gene. Both Northern blot and Western blot analyses revealed a distinct down-regulation of expression of αB-crystallin gene in BCL-2-expression cells.Because αB-crystallin is a molecular chaperone (45Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10449-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1735) Google Scholar, 46Rao P.V. Huang Q.L. Horwitz J. Zigler J.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1245: 439-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and also an anti-apoptotic protein (47Mehlen P. Schulze-Osthoff K. Arrigo A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16510-16514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar, 48Li D.W.-C. Xiang H. Mao Y.-W. Wang J. Fass U. Zhang X.-Y. Xu C. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 266: 279-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), it is possible that the down-regulation of αB-crystallin accounts for the attenuated ability of the BCL-2 expression cells in preventing H2O2-induced apoptosis. To confirm this possibility, we used an antisense bcl-2 RNA to block BCL-2 expression. When BCL-2 expression was blocked, expression of αB-crystallin was increased (Fig. 7 A). More importantly, the increase of αB-crystallin expression leads to the recovery of the ability of the double-transfected cells in their resistance against H2O2 and H2O2-induced apoptosis (Fig. 7, B–D). The observation that αB-crystallin enhances the ability of the lens epithelial cells to protect against H2O2-induced apoptosis has been further confirmed by overexpression of an exogenous αB-crystallin gene in BCL-2 expression cells (Fig. 8).Together, our results demonstrate that by down-regulating expression of αB-crystallin gene, human BCL-2 attenuates the ability of rabbit lens epithelial cells to resist H2O2-induced apoptosis.Bcl-2 Regulates Gene ExpressionIn addition to its well established function in controlling cell survival, BCL-2 also has other important functions. One of these functions is to regulate expression of other genes. Initially, it is found that BCL-2 can increase the half-life of p21Bax (56Miyashita T. Kitada S. Krajewski S. Horne W.A. Delia D. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26049-26052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), suggesting that BCL-2 modulates gene expression at the post-translational level. More recently, Fenget al. (57Feng L. Balakir R. Precht P. Horton Jr., W.E. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 74: 576-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that BCL-2 up-regulates expression of a differentiation-specific gene encoding the proteoglycan aggrecan in rat chondrocyte cell line, IRC cells. This up-regulation occurs at the mRNA and protein levels. In contrast to its positive regulation on the aggrecan gene, we found that BCL-2 substantially down-regulates expression of the αB-crystallin gene in rabbit N/N1003A cells, although it has no effect on expression of either the anti-oxidative stress genes (coding for catalase and glutathione peroxidase) or the housekeeping genes (encoding β-actin and GAPDH). Such down-regulation occurs at both mRNA and protein levels and is BCL-2-dependent because the antisense bcl-2 RNA not only blocks BCL-2 expression but also abolishes αB-crystallin down-regulation. BCL-2 also down-regulates expression from an exogenous mouse αB-crystallin gene promoter (Fig. 9). Thus, depending upon the cell type or the specific target gene, BCL-2 can exert either positive or negative regulation of expression of other genes. A recent study from Vairo et al. (58Vairo G. Soos T.J. Upton T.M. Zalvide J. DeCaprio J.A. Ewen M.E. Koff A. Adams J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4745-4753Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) further supports this point. In the mouse fibroblasts, Vairo et al. (58Vairo G. Soos T.J. Upton T.M. Zalvide J. DeCaprio J.A. Ewen M.E. Koff A. Adams J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4745-4753Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) demonstrate that BCL-2 up-regulates accumulation of p27 and p130 proteins but down-regulates the level of p107 protein from G0 to S transition during the cell cycle of the fibroblasts. This differential regulation allows BCL-2 to retard fibroblast cells entering into the cell cycle (58Vairo G. Soos T.J. Upton T.M. Zalvide J. DeCaprio J.A. Ewen M.E. Koff A. Adams J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4745-4753Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar).How could BCL-2 regulate gene expression? It is well established that BCL-2 can modulate transactivities of different transcription factors. For example, NF-κB, an important transcription factor mediating multiple signaling pathways (59Li N. Karin M. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1137-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar), is positively regulated by BCL-2 (60de Moissac D. Mustapha S. Greenberg A.H. Kirshenbaum L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23946-23951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 61Ricca A. Biroccio A. Del Bufalo D. Mackay A.R. Santoni A. Cippitelli M. Int. J.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). By changing the affinity of IκBα to NF-κB, BCL-2 can up-regulate the transactivity of NF-κB and expression of NF-κB-responsive genes such as that encoding the matrix metalloproteinase-9 (61Ricca A. Biroccio A. Del Bufalo D. Mackay A.R. Santoni A. Cippitelli M. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 86: 188-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The tumor suppressor, p53, is another target negatively regulated by BCL-2. Zhan et al. (62Zhan Q. Kontny U. Iglesias M. Alamo Jr., I. Yu K. Hollander M.C. Woodworth C.D. Fornace Jr., A.J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) found that in the human Burkitt's lymphoma WMN cell line, BCL-2 specifically suppresses the p53-mediated transactivation of p21 CIP1/WAF1 andGADD45 after treatment with methylmethane sulfonate or UV irradiation. In human kidney 293 cells and MCF7 cells, Froesch et al. (63Froesch B.A. Aime-Sempe C. Leber B. Andrews D. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6469-6475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) also observed that overexpression of BCL-2 down-regulates p53 transactivity without affecting nuclear accumulation of p53 protein. In BCL-2 expression rabbit lens epithelial cells, we have examined the DNA binding activity of LEDGF. This lens epithelial cell-derived growth factor is a transcription factor that positively regulates expression of αB-crystallin gene (24Singh D.P. Fatma N. Kimura A. Chylack Jr., L.T. Shinohara T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 943-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 25Singh D.P. Ohguro N. Chylack Jr., L.T. Shinohara T. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1999; 40: 1444-1451PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, in BCL-2 expression cells where αB-crystallin is distinctly down-regulated, the DNA binding activity of LEDGF is substantially decreased (Fig. 10 A). This decreased LEDGF activity contributes substantially to the down-regulation of αB-crystallin gene because expression of the exogenous LEDGF in BCL-2 expression cells significantly up-regulates the expression level of αB-crystallin (Fig. 10 B). Of course, BCL-2-modulated changes in other transcription factors may also contribute to down-regulation of αB-crystallin.Mechanism by Which αB-crystallin Prevents ApoptosisSince the first demonstration that αB-crystallin is able to prevent apoptosis induced by staurosporine (47Mehlen P. Schulze-Osthoff K. Arrigo A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16510-16514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar), several laboratories have demonstrated that this molecular chaperone can provide cellular protection from a variety of stress conditions. For example, αB-crystallin has been shown to prevent apoptosis induced by UVA irradiation (64Andley U.P. Song Z. Wawrousek E.F. Fleming T.P. Bassnett S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36823-36831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In the transgenic mice overexpressing αB-crystallin, the expressed protein confers simultaneous protection against cardiomyocyte apoptosis during myocardial ischemia and reperfusion (65Ray P.S.

Nebert D.W. Pharmacogenetics. 1997; 7: 255-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar). UGT1A1, which mediates bilirubin glucuronidation (3Bosma P.J. Seppen J. Goldhoorn B. Bakker C. Oude Elferink R.P.J. Roy Chowdhury J. Roy Chowdhury N. Jansen P.L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17960-17964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), belongs to a subfamily that is expressed from the UGT1A locus at human chromosome 2q37 (4Van Es H.H.G. Bout A. Liu J. Anderson I. Duncan A.M.V. Bosma P.J. Oude Elferink R.P.J. Jansen P.L.M. Roy Chowdhury J. Schurr E. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1993; 63: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The four exons (exons 2–5) located at the 3′-end of this locus are used in mRNAs for several UGT1A isoforms and encode the identical carboxyl-terminal halves of these enzymes (5Ritter J.K. Chen F. Sheen Y.Y. Tran H.M. Kimura S. Yeatman M.T. Owens I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3257-3261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Upstream of these exons is a series of at least 12 unique exons, only one of which is used in the mRNA for a given isoform (5Ritter J.K. Chen F. Sheen Y.Y. Tran H.M. Kimura S. Yeatman M.T. Owens I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3257-3261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The unique region exon encodes the amino-terminal domain of these enzymes, which imparts their aglycone substrate specificity (6Mackenzie P.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3432-3435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). UGTs are concentrated in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (7Roy Chowdhury J. Novikoff P.M. Roy Chowdhury N. Novikoff A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 2990-2994Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Except for a 21–26-amino acid carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic tail, the enzymes are located within the ER lumen, predicting the need for transport of the sugar donor substrate, UDP-glucuronic acid, from the cytosol to the catalytic site within the ER lumen. UGT1A1 is encoded by exons 1A1 and 2–5. UGT1A1-mediated glucuronidation is essential for efficient biliary excretion of bilirubin. Genetic lesions within the coding region of UGT1A1 can abolish or markedly reduce UGT activity toward bilirubin, resulting in Crigler-Najjar syndrome type 1 or 2, respectively (8Kadakol A. Ghosh S.S. Sappal B.S. Sharma G. Roy Chowdhury J. Roy Chowdhury N. Hum. Mutat. 2000; 16: 297-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), both of which are characterized by unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia (9Crigler J.F. Najjar V.A. Pediatrics. 1952; 10: 169-180PubMed Google Scholar). The inheritance of Crigler-Najjar syndrome types 1 and 2 generally follows an autosomal recessive pattern (9Crigler J.F. Najjar V.A. Pediatrics. 1952; 10: 169-180PubMed Google Scholar) because, in most heterozygous carriers, the wild-type enzyme expressed from the structurally normal allele is sufficient to keep plasma bilirubin concentrations within normal limits. However, the heterozygous carriers of certain human UGT1A1 (hUGT1A1) mutations exhibit mild to moderate hyperbilirubinemia, suggesting an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance (10Koiwai O. Aono S. Adachi Y. Kamisako T. Yasui Y. Nishizawa M. Sato H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 645-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). It has been postulated that, in these cases, mutant hUGT1A1 may act as a dominant-negative protein. An essential component of this hypothesis is intermolecular association of hUGT1A1 molecules. Several previous observations have suggested the intermolecular association of some other UGT isoforms. Gel permeation chromatography of solubilized rat liver microsomal UGT isoforms with activity toward chenodeoxycholic acid (11Matern H. Matern S. Gerok W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7422-7427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or phenols (12Gschaidmeier H. Bock K.W. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 48: 1545-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) suggested that they exist in a larger than monomeric size. Radiation inactivation analysis of rat liver microsomes also suggested that UGT1A1 may exist as dimers and tetramers (13Peters W.H.M. Jansen P.L.M. Henk N. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11701-11706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, these studies did not differentiate between the homodimerization of UGT isoforms and interaction between one UGT isoform and other isoforms or non-UGT proteins. In fact, interaction between rat liver testosterone-UGT and androsterone-UGT isoforms has been reported (14Matsui M. Nagai F. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 105: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that heterodimerization of rat liver UGT2B1 with a UGT1A isoform may activate UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-stimulated UDP-glucuronic acid transport into the ER lumen (15Ikushiro S. Emi Y. Iyanagi T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7154-7161Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The functional relevance of UGT dimerization was suggested by partial reconstitution of steroid-UGT activity upon coexpression of two catalytically inactive mutant forms of rat liver UGT2B1 (16Meech R. Mackenzie P.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26913-26917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). However, there is no direct evidence for homodimerization of human UGT1A1. Therefore, we have used a combination of gel permeation high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), nearest-neighbor cross-linking analysis, and two-hybrid studies in yeast and mammalian systems to test the hypothesis that hUGT1A1 interacts with itself. We have also partially characterized the domain of hUGT1A1 that is required for such interaction. To express hUGT1A1 in a cell that does not express any other UGT isoform, we stably transduced skin fibroblasts from jaundiced Gunn rats, which lack the UGT1A subfamily of UGT isoforms, using a Moloney murine leukemia virus-based gene transfer system as previously described (17Seppen J. Tada K. Hellwig S. Bakker C.T.M. Prasad V.R. Roy Chowdhury N. Roy Chowdhury J. Bosma P.J. Oude Elferink R.P.J. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The Gunn rat fibroblasts lack any other detectable UGT activity. These cells (termed GURF-hUGT1A1) express hUGT1A1 at a level comparable to that of normal human liver microsomes. To examine whether hUGT1A1 forms intermolecular disulfide linkage, GURF-hUGT1A1 cells were disrupted by sonication, and microsomes were prepared as described (17Seppen J. Tada K. Hellwig S. Bakker C.T.M. Prasad V.R. Roy Chowdhury N. Roy Chowdhury J. Bosma P.J. Oude Elferink R.P.J. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The microsomal proteins (25 μg/lane) were resolved by SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with or without pretreatment with 100 mm dithiothreitol and with or without heating the sample with SDS. Immunotransblot analysis was performed using a monoclonal antibody (WP1) against the human UGT1A group of proteins (18Seppen J. Jansen P.L.M. Oude Elferink R.P.J. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Microsomes derived from GURF-hUGT1A1 cells were suspended in 50 mmHEPES (pH 7.8) containing 2% n-octyl glucoside. After gentle stirring on ice for 1 h, the preparation was subjected to centrifugation (100,000 × g for 60 min). The soluble proteins in the supernatant were diluted with 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.8) to reduce the concentration of n-octyl glucoside to 0.2% (critical micellar concentration of n-octyl glucoside is 0.6%). The solubilized proteins (0.5 ml) were applied to a gel permeation HPLC column (I-250, two columns in tandem; Waters Associates, Milford, MA), and the proteins were eluted isocratically at 1 ml/min with 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.8) containing 0.1%n-octyl glucoside. The fractions (0.5 ml) were analyzed by immunoblotting using the WP1 monoclonal antibody. The immunoreactive bands were quantified by laser densitometry. To determine whether hUGT1A1 interacts with itself within the ER membrane, we performed “nearest-neighbor” analysis using two different cross-linkers. For generating intermolecular disulfide bonds, 10% homogenates of GURF-hUGT1A1 cells were prepared in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 0.25 m sucrose using a glass homogenizer by 30 up-and-down strokes of a motorized Teflon pestle. Microsomes were prepared as described (17Seppen J. Tada K. Hellwig S. Bakker C.T.M. Prasad V.R. Roy Chowdhury N. Roy Chowdhury J. Bosma P.J. Oude Elferink R.P.J. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and suspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 0.25 mm sucrose and 5 mmMgCl2. The microsomal suspension (containing 100 μg of protein) was treated with 1,6-bismaleimidohexane (BMH; Pierce) in dimethyl sulfoxide at a final concentration of 1 or 2 mm. The cross-linking reaction was carried out at 25 °C for 60 min. The reaction was quenched with 20 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. To determine whether the chemical cross-linking involves the cytoplasmic tail or the part of the protein within the microsomal lumen, a membrane-impermeable inhibitor, 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (referred to as stilbenedisulfonate maleimide below; Molecular Probes, Inc.), was used. For this experiment, the microsomal preparation was preincubated with 2 mm stilbenedisulfonate maleimide for 60 min at 25 °C before the cross-linking with BMH as described above. The protein samples were then subjected to SDS-4–10% gradient polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by immunoblot analysis with WP1 (15Ikushiro S. Emi Y. Iyanagi T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7154-7161Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To evaluate the extent to which the microsomes were sealed, the degree of latency of UGT1A1 activity in the microsomal preparation was determined. For this purpose, the enzyme activity toward bilirubin was determined in the presence or absence of 0.17%n-octyl glucoside. As BMH is a relatively ineffective cross-linker at alkaline pH, to determine the effect of hydrogen ion concentration on intermolecular binding of hUGT1A1, we used dimethyl 3,3′-dithiobispropionimidate (DTBP, Pierce), which cross-links amino groups and is effective at a wide pH range. To generate intermolecular bonds, GURF-hUGT1A1 microsomes were suspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl containing 0.25 mm sucrose and 5 mm MgCl2 at pH 7.4 or 9.0. The microsomal suspension (containing 100 μg of protein) was treated with DTBP at a final concentration of 2, 5, or 10 mm. The cross-linking reaction was carried out at 22 °C (optimum temperature) for 60 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 0.5 m glycine (pH 7.0). SDS-4–10% gradient polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis was performed as described (19Briggs M.M. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was done to introduce point mutations into hUGT1A1 cDNA. This was performed based on the method of Deng and Nickoloff (20Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar) with some minor modifications of the protocols (TransformedTMmutagenesis kit, CLONTECH). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on plasmid pSVK3, which contains the entire hUGT1A1 coding region (21Kadakol A. Sappal B.S. Ghosh S.S. Lowenheim M. Chowdhury A. Chowdhury S. Santra A. Arias I.M. Roy Chowdhury J. Roy Chowdhury N. J. Med. Genet. 2001; 38: 244-248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mutagenized clones were primarily selected by XbaI digestion. The entire 2.2-kilobase pair mutagenized hUGT1A1 cDNA was excised by digestion with NotI and XhoI and subcloned into the pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+) expression vector (Invitrogen). Introduction of the desired mutation was confirmed by nucleotide sequence determination by the dideoxy chain termination method (22Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To delete a segment of hUGT1A1 (amino acids 152–180) that spans a membrane-embedded helix, we generated an expression plasmid with in-frame deletion of nucleotides 454–540. A 453-base pair (bp) segment of the UGT1A1 cDNA including the translation initiation codon (ATG) was amplified from plasmid pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+)-hBUGT (21Kadakol A. Sappal B.S. Ghosh S.S. Lowenheim M.

The amplicon was end-repaired with Klenow and digested with BamHI. Another 300-bp fragment (nucleotides 541–841) was amplified using the following amplimers: sense, 5′-TTTGAGGCTACCCAGTGCCCCAA-3′; and antisense, 5′-GCAGTTGATTCCACCAAC-3′. The 300-bp amplicon was digested with EcoRI. The 166-bp 5′-fragment of the amplicon was blunt-ended and ligated to the 3′-end of the 453-bp amplicon to generate a 619-bp fragment. The parental plasmid, pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+), was digested with EcoRI to excise a 707-bp segment from the 5′-end of the UGT1A1 coding region. The 619-bp fragment generated by ligation of the two polymerase chain reaction amplicons was ligated to the EcoRI site of pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+). The resulting UGT1A1 cDNA with the deletion of nucleotides 454–540 was cloned in-frame at the BamHI and XhoI sites of the mammalian two-hybrid vectors. COS-7 cells, grown in 100-mm dishes to 50–60% confluency, were transfected with pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+) containing normal or mutagenized hUGT1A1 sequences and a ZeocinTM resistance gene using DEAE-dextran (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described (21Kadakol A.

Total protein in the cell lysates was quantitated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; see below), and an equal amount of protein from different transfected cell lysates was subjected to immunotransblot analysis using WP1 (3Bosma P.J. Seppen J. Goldhoorn B. Bakker C. Oude Elferink R.P.J. Roy Chowdhury J. Roy Chowdhury N. Jansen P.L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17960-17964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Kadakol A.

The immunoreactive bands were visualized using a chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Expressed hUGT1A1 in each cell lysate was quantitated by sandwich ELISA as described (21Kadakol A. Sappal B.S. Ghosh S.S. Lowenheim M. Chowdhury A. Chowdhury S. Santra A. Arias I.M. Roy Chowdhury J. Roy Chowdhury N. J. Med. Genet. 2001; 38: 244-248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, ELISA plates were coated overnight with the WP1 antibody (1:4000 dilution), blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% bovine serum albumin and 5% fetal calf serum, and then overlaid with lysates of the transfected cells. A rabbit antibody against a synthetic peptide corresponding to a unique region of hUGT1A1 (polyclonal antibody 136) was applied at a 1:500 dilution. The detection system consisted of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. Absorbance at 405 nm was determined using an ELISA plate reader. Based on ELISA quantitation, equal amounts of hUGT1A1 from the various cell lysates were assayed for UGT activity toward bilirubin in the presence of 80 μmbilirubin, 4.4 mm UDP-glucuronic acid, and dioleoylphosphatidylcholine as described (3Bosma P.J. Seppen J. Goldhoorn B. Bakker C. Oude Elferink R.P.J. Roy Chowdhury J. Roy Chowdhury N. Jansen P.L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17960-17964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, after incubation at 37 °C for 4 h, the reaction was stopped by adding 0.4 m glycine HCl (pH 1.8), and the pigments were extracted in chloroform/ethanol (1:1, v/v) (3Bosma P.J. Seppen J. Goldhoorn B. Bakker C. Oude Elferink R.P.J. Roy Chowdhury J. Roy Chowdhury N. Jansen P.L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17960-17964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The solvents were evaporated under a stream of nitrogen. The pigments were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide, mixed with an equal volume of methanol, and analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC using a Waters μBondapak C18 column as described (25Roy Chowdhury J. Roy Chowdhury N. Wu G. Shouval R. Arias I.M. Hepatology. 1981; 1: 622-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Formation of bilirubin glucuronides was calculated from the electronically integrated areas under the bilirubin glucuronide peaks. In the yeast two-hybrid system, two physically functional domains are necessary, a DNA-binding domain and a transactivation domain. A 2.2-kilobase pair fragment spanning the entire coding region of hUGT1A1 was amplified from plasmid pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+)-hBUGT (21Kadakol A. Sappal B.S. Ghosh S.S. Lowenheim M. Chowdhury A. Chowdhury S. Santra A. Arias I.M. Roy Chowdhury J. Roy Chowdhury N. J. Med. Genet. 2001; 38: 244-248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using sense and antisense amplimers containing BamHI and XhoI linkers, respectively. The amplicon was digested with BamHI and XhoI and cloned in-frame into the BamHI and SalI sites of the “bait” vector pSH2.1 so that hUGT1A1 is expressed as a fusion protein with the bacterial Lex DNA-binding domain. The nucleotide sequence of the insert was determined to confirm the fidelity of the amplification. The hUGT1A1 cDNA was also cloned in-frame into the BamHI and SalI sites of the “prey” vector Gal4-GADNOT so that hUGT1A1 is expressed as a fusion protein with the Gal4 transactivator protein (activation domain). The constructs (20 μg each) were cotransfected into yeast strain CTY. In this yeast strain, the LexA operator is engineered into the 5′-flanking region of the Escherichia coli β-galactosidase reporter gene (lacZ). The transformed cells were plated on selective dropout agar plates without histidine and leucine. After growing the yeast cells for 3–4 days at 30 °C, the colonies were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes and stained for E. coli β-galactosidase activity with the 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside substrate (X-gal; Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Interaction of the proteins expressed by the bait and prey constructs brings the Gal4 activation domain into proximity with LexA (DNA-binding domain), resulting in the transcription of LacZ and the appearance of blue colonies. HIV-1 integrase protein (IN) cloned into both the bait and prey vectors was used as a positive control. As a negative control, we used a bait construct expressing hUGT1A1 in combination with a prey construct without any fusion sequence or a bait construct without any fusion sequence in combination with a prey construct expressing hUGT1A1 (26Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (4793) Google Scholar). In the mammalian two-hybrid assay system, the reporter plasmid pFR-Luc contains a synthetic promoter with five tandem repeats of the yeast Gal4 binding sites that control expression of the luciferase gene. This reporter gene expression occurs as a result of reconstitution of a functional transcription factor by the association of two hybrid proteins. A 2.2-kilobase pair DNA segment containing the full-length hUGT1A1 cDNA was cloned in-frame into the BamHI and XbaI sites of the bait vector pCMV-BD so that hUGT1A1 is expressed as a fusion protein with the DNA-binding domain of yeast Gal4. The test sequence (wild-type or mutagenized hUGT1A1 or human UGT1A6) was cloned in-frame into the BamHI and XhoI sites of the pCMV-AD vector, where it is expressed as a fusion protein with the transcriptional activation domain of mouse NF-κB. The various coding sequences cloned into the prey vector are listed in Table I. These two constructs were cotransfected into COS-7 cells, cultured at 50% confluence, along with plasmid pFR-Luc. Positive interaction of the proteins expressed from the bait and prey vectors brings the NF-κB activation domain into proximity with the Gal4 DNA-binding domain, thereby activating the expression of luciferase. As a positive control, the coding regions of simian virus 40 large T antigen and p53 were cloned into the bait and prey vectors, respectively (27Bertin J. Guo Y. Wang L. Srinivasula S.M. Jacobson M.D. Poyet J.L. Merriam S. Du M.Q. Dyer M.J.S. Robison K.E. DiStefano P.S. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol.

To determine whether the mutagenized forms of hUGT1A1 express stable proteins, the bait and prey plasmid constructs were transfected into COS-7 cells by the DEAE-dextran method (21Kadakol A. Sappal B.S. Ghosh S.S. Lowenheim M. Chowdhury A. Chowdhury S. Santra A. Arias I.M. Roy Chowdhury J. Roy Chowdhury N. J. Med.

Open table in a new tab Positive (+), absent (−), or markedly reduced (±) intermolecular associations are shown. To examine whether some mutant forms of hUGT1A1 can inhibit the function of wild-type hUGT1A1, we performed cotransfection experiments. A series of plasmids expressing wild-type hUGT1A1 and several mutant forms of hUGT1A1 were prepared. The plasmids were transfected into COS-7 cells singly (10 μg/75-cm2 plate) or in pairs (5 μg each/75-cm2 plate) using DEAE-dextran as the transfection vehicle (21Kadakol A. Sappal B.S. Ghosh S.S. Lowenheim M. Chowdhury A. Chowdhury S. Santra A. Arias I.M. Roy Chowdhury J. Roy Chowdhury N. J. Med. Genet. 2001; 38: 244-248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm the expression of transfected plasmids, immunotransblot experiments were performed using WP1. The expressed total hUGT1A1 proteins were quantified by sandwich ELISA as described above. UGT activity toward bilirubin was determined by a sensitive HPLC method as described above (25Roy Chowdhury J. Roy Chowdhury N. Wu G. Shouval R. Arias I.M. Hepatology. 1981; 1: 622-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). One mutagenized form of hUGT1A1 (C127Y) exhibited marked inhibition of the activity of the wild-type enzyme upon coexpression in COS-7 cells (see “Results”). To determine whether the wild-type and mutagenized forms were coexpressed, we extracted the total RNA from the lysate of the transfected COS-7 cells. A 646-bp segment (nucleotides 320–1066) was amplified by reverse transcription-primed polymerase chain reaction using the following amplimers: sense, 5′-GCGTGTGATCAAAACATACAA-3′; and antisense, 5′-GCCACTTAACAAGTATCGTGTTG-3′. The sequence of the amplimer was determined by the dideoxy chain termination method using the cycle sequencing procedure as described (22Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 74: 5463-5467Crossref Scopus (52229) Google Scholar, 23Gantla S. Attavar P. Sengupta K. Roy Chowdhury N. Epicentre Forum. 1995; 2: 3Google Scholar, 24Gantla S. Bakker C.T.M. Deocharan B.

COS-7 cells were transfected with wild-type or C127Y mutant hUGT1A1, and the expressed proteins were quantified by ELISA as described above. Homogenates of the cells (10%) in 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 0.25 m sucrose were prepared in a glass homogenizer by 30 up-and-down strokes of a motorized Teflon pestle. UGT1A1 activity was determined in the homogenates of the transfected cells by two different methods. First, to determine whether the C127Y mutant contained in unperturbed microsomes can inhibit the activity of the wild-type enzyme present in separate microsomal vesicles, the enzyme activity in the cell homogenates was determined in the absence of any detergent to avoid membrane perturbation. For this assay, the enzyme was activated by the addition of 0.2 mmUDP-N-acetylglucosamine to the incubation mixture. UGT1A1 activity toward bilirubin was determined in homogenates of COS-7 cells transfected with the wild-type or mutant form and also in a mixture of the two homogenates. Second, to determine whether dissolution of the microsomal membranes would permit the interaction of the two forms, resulting in the inhibition of enzyme activity, we incubated the cell homogenates with 1% n-octyl glucoside on ice for 15 min before determining the UGT1A1 activity toward bilirubin at a final detergent concentration of 0.17%.

Reed J.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 239-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (2270) Google Scholar). The mammalian IAPs consist of the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP, MIHA, ILP), cellular IAP1 (cIAP1, HIAP2, MIHC), cIAP2 (HIAP1, MIHB), NAIP, and survivin (2Roy N. Mahadevan M.S. McLean M.

The inhibitor of T cell apoptosis (ITA) is an avian IAP homologue (7Digby M.R. Kimpton W.G. York J.J. Connick T.E. Lowenthal J.W. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 981-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Members of this family must contain at least one NH2-terminal cysteine-rich baculovirus IAP repeat (BIR) domain, which is required for pro-survival activity, and may also possess a carboxyl-terminal RING zinc finger. cIAP1 and cIAP2 were originally identified as part of the TNFR2-TRAF signaling complex, with the BIR domains being responsible for the interaction with TRAFs 1 and 2 (3Rothe M. Pan M.G. Henzel W.J. Ayres T.M. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 83: 1243-1252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). XIAP on the other hand was shown to act as a mediator of bone morphogenic protein signaling linking the receptors to the signaling modulators TAB1 (TAK1-binding protein) and TAK1. The RING domain of XIAP binds to the receptor, while the BIR domains are important for recruiting TAB1 (8Yamaguchi K. Nagai S. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Nishita M. Tamai K. Irie K. Ueno N. Nishida E. Shibuya H. Matsumoto K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). XIAP was also shown to interact with nuclear proteins such as XAF1 (9Liston P. Fong W.G. Kelly N.L.

Another group of proteins important in the regulation of apoptosis is the Bcl-2 family (13Reed J.C. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3225-3236Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). Bcl-2 itself has been shown to play a crucial role in the prevention of apoptosis at the mitochondrial surface impeding the function of the pro-death family members or by obstructing the release of apoptogenic molecules (13Reed J.C. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3225-3236Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). NRAGE is a very recently cloned neurotrophinreceptor-interacting MAGE homologue, uncovered in a two-hybrid search for proteins interacting with the intracellular domain of the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR). This protein was shown to be involved in the apoptotic response after nerve growth factor (NGF) binding in neuronal cells (14Salehi A.H. Roux P.P. Kubu C.J. Zeindler C. Bhakar A. Tannis L.L. Verdi J.M. Barker P.A. Neuron. 2000; 27: 279-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). NGF can mediate a variety of cellular responses, such as survival, differentiation, growth, and apoptosis in neurons, by binding to two types of cell surface receptors, the Trk receptor tyrosine kinases and the p75NTR (15Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (1647) Google Scholar). Interestingly, NRAGE shows a high homology in its carboxyl-terminal with the melanoma associated antigen (MAGE) family, which codes for antigens that present on many human tumors, although their intracellular function is mostly unknown. One exception is necdin, a postmitotic neuron-specific growth suppressor that can interact with both intracellular proteins such as E2F1 and p53 and viral transforming proteins such as adenovirus E1A (16Taniura H. Taniguchi N. Hara M. Yoshikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 720-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In this study we identified the pro-apoptotic protein NRAGE as a novel IAP-interacting protein in the yeast two-hybrid system. Furthermore, we show that NRAGE coprecipitates with ITA and XIAP, via the RING zinc finger domain of the IAPs. NRAGE can augment cell death upon growth factor withdrawal in the IL-3-dependent promyeloid leukemic 32D cell line, even in the presence of Bcl-2. Molecular cloning of ITA was described previously (7Digby M.R. Kimpton W.G. York J.J. Connick T.E. Lowenthal J.W. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 981-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The full-length cDNA was inserted into theApaI and EcoRI sites of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). A 5′ PCR product was amplified using the primers 5′-tccagcaacagttgtcgactatgaacataatg-3′ and 3′-tgggtctcgaggaaaactg-5′, with pCDNA3-ITA as a template and Pfu polymerase (Stratagene). The PCR product was digested with SalI andSmaI, ligated with pCDNA3-ITASmaI/EcoRI, and inserted first into the two-hybrid vector pPC86 at SalI/EcoRI then into pPC97 at SalI/AaT2(17). pCDNA3HA-ITA construction was described previously (18Wiese S.

The expression vectors for truncated ITA isoforms were generated by PCR using HF DNA polymerase (CLONTECH) on the pCDNA3HA-ITA template. For ITAΔBIR, the KpnI site containing forward primer 5′-gcgcggtacccctgcttcgtgtgaaaggaggag-3′ together with the reverse primer 5′-tagctgaaagtaaactcccaagg-3′ were used, the PCR product digested at the KpnI and MroI sites, and cloned into a MroI- and KpnI-digested pcDNA3HA-ITA.

The largest two-hybrid insert was labeled with [32P]dCTP using therediprimeTM random labeling system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to manufacturer's instructions and used to screen a bacterially expressed S194 murine plasmacytoma cDNA library as described previously (20Pfisterer P. Zwilling S. Hess J. Wirth T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29870-29880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The full-length NRAGE cDNA was amplified with Pfu polymerase from a resultant 2.8-kilobase pair putative full-length clone with the forward primer 5′-gcgaattctgccaccatggactacaagaaggacgatgagatgatgacaaactggaaaccatccag-3′, incorporating an EcoRI site and a flag tag, and the reverse primer 5′-gcgcctcgagttactcaacccagaagaagccaatg-3′, and inserted into pCFG5-IEGZ (provided by D. Lindemann) at the Klenow-treatedEcoRI site. This allowed expression of both the gene of interest from the retroviral long terminal repeat and the green fluorescent protein and Zeocin resistance genes from an internal ribosomal entry site. The yeast two-hybrid screen was performed using a PC12 cDNA library cloned into pPC86HA3 (17Kalmes A. Hagemann C. Weber C.K. Wixler L. Schuster T. Rapp U.R. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2986-2990PubMed Google Scholar). The yeast strain Y190 was manipulated according to the MATCHMAKER Library User Manual (CLONTECH). A sequential transformation protocol was used with pPC97-ITA as bait. Positive clones were identified by growth on SD/-TRP/-LEU/-HIS/ + 25 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (Sigma) plates and activity of the lacZ reporter gene in filter assays. Direct two-hybrid tests were performed according to standard protocols. The human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293 and PhoenixTM packaging cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 units of penicillin and streptomycin/ml, and 2 mml-glutamine, at 37 °C in humidified air with 6% CO2. The 32D cells were obtained from Dr. J. S. Greenberger and grown in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 units of penicillin and streptomycin/ml, 2 mml-glutamine, and 15% of WEHI-conditioned medium at 37 °C, 5% CO2, and 90% humidity. 32D cells expressing a human Bcl-2 protein were obtained from J.

Cells were transfected by a modified calcium phosphate coprecipitation method (22Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4816) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were starved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.3% (v/v) FCS for 48 h after transfection. Transfected HEK293 cells and 32D cells were lysed at 4 °C in Nonidet P-40 buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 145 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2% IGEPAL, and a protease/phosphatase inhibitor mix containing 1 mm Pefabloc, 1 mmsodium orthovanadate, 5 mm benzamidine, 5 µg/ml aprotinin, 5 µg/ml leupeptin). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and 500 µg of protein supernatants were precleared with 10 µl of protein-A/G-agarose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The lysates were then incubated with the appropriate antiserum coupled to 30 µl of protein-A/G-agarose overnight at 4 °C. The immune complexes were washed twice in Nonidet P-40 buffer containing 500 mm NaCl. After resuspension in Laemmli buffer and SDS-PAGE, proteins were detected by immunoblot. Anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Eastman Kodak Co.) was a generous gift from S. Feller (Institut für Medizinische Strahlenkunde und Zellforschung). Goat polyclonal anti-FLAG raised against the OctA probe and rabbit polyclonal ERK2 antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz. HA-tagged proteins were detected with a monoclonal anti-HA antibody (12CA5). Anti-XIAP rabbit polyclonal antibody was purchased from R & D systems anti-mouse or anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-linked F(ab′)2 fragments (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and anti-goat IgG horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz) was also employed.

Retroviral expressed proteins were confirmed after selection with Zeocin by Western blotting. For the analysis of cell survival, cells were washed three times in tissue culture medium containing 10% FCS but without WEHI cell supernatant. 0.5 × 106cells in a total volume of 1 ml were dispensed into a single well of a flat bottom 24-well tissue culture plate. Cell viability was routinely assessed by staining the cells in trypan blue (Sigma). For protein analysis, the cell number and volume were scaled up by ×20. In the search for IAP-interacting proteins, a yeast two-hybrid screen was performed with the full-length ITA cDNA as bait, using a PC12 cDNA library. The ITA-GAL4DB fusion protein expressed in yeast cells did not autonomously activate thelacZ reporter genes and was not toxic (data not shown). 32 His-positive clones were obtained from this screen, of which 8 were β-galactosidase positive, and after elimination of false positives, 3 clones remained. Sequence analysis of these clones revealed that they represented three overlapping clones from the same cDNA (Fig. 1A, upper panel). Although they bore no homology to any previously described gene, an electronically assembled gene THC179960 from The Institute of Genomic Research did show a high degree of identity; THC179960 was later identified as NRAGE (14Salehi A.H. Roux P.P. Kubu C.J. Zeindler C. Bhakar A. Tannis L.L. Verdi J.M. Barker P.A. Neuron. 2000; 27: 279-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). To determine whether NRAGE could interact with other IAP family members, direct yeast two-hybrid tests were carried out between the strongest interacting clone (ΔNRAGEp60) and c-IAP1, c-IAP2, XIAP, and NAIP. XIAP interacted with ΔNRAGEp60 with an equal intensity of β-galactosidase activity compared with ITA (Fig.1 A, lower panel). XIAP also bound to ΔNRAGEp70 and ΔNRAGEp80. However, c-IAP1, c-IAP2, and NAIP did not interact with any of the clones in direct yeast-two-hybrid tests. To independently confirm the ITA-NRAGE two-hybrid interaction we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments in a higher eukaryotic cell system. The full coding sequence of NRAGE was cloned into a mammalian expression vector as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and HEK293 cells were cotransfected with HA-tagged ITA and FLAG-tagged NRAGE. NRAGE was immunoprecipitated and subsequently immunoblotted using a goat anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 1 B). As shown in Fig.1 B, upper panel, NRAGE was detectable after immunoprecipitation with the 12CA5 antibody using lysates from HA-ITA-expressing lysates (Fig. 1 B, lane 2), but not from control cells (Fig. 1 B, lane 5). Furthermore, NRAGE coimmunoprecipitated with an ITA deletion construct containing only the RING domain (Fig. 1 B, lane 4), but not with the deletion construct containing only the BIR domains of ITA (Fig. 1 B, lane 3). These interactions were able to withstand high stringency washes with 500 mm NaCl. In Fig. 1 B, lower panel, the presence of the immunoprecipitated ITA proteins used in the coprecipitation experiments (lanes 2–5) was confirmed by stripping and reprobing the same membrane with the 12CA5 monoclonal antibody. In summary, these experiments demonstrate that ITA interacts with NRAGE with high affinity and that this interaction occurs specifically via its carboxyl-terminal RING zinc finger domain. The same strategy was applied to confirm the XIAP-NRAGE binding. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with vectors expressing FLAG-NRAGE and GST-XIAP or FLAG-NRAGE and GST only. In Fig. 1 C, upper left panel, NRAGE is coimmunoprecipitated with GST-XIAP (lane 2), whereas no coprecipitated protein was detected in the control sample (lane 3). NRAGE was immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted as a positive control (lane 1). The blot was stripped and reprobed using the rabbit polyclonal XIAP antibody, shown in the lower left panel. In Fig. 1 C, righthand panels, the reverse experiment was performed. GST-XIAP was coimmunoprecipitated with NRAGE (lane 2 upper right panel). Once again, this interaction was stable enough to withstand high salt washing conditions (500 mm NaCl). Immnunoprecipitated and immunoblotted GST-XIAP was used as the positive control (lane 1), while GST containing lysate was used as a negative control in this experiment (lane 3). The blots were stripped and reprobed using the FLAG antibody to detect tagged NRAGE, shown in the lower right panel. These experiments confirm NRAGE as a novel XIAP-interacting protein, with a strong binding affinity. IL-3-dependent 32D cells have been well studied with regard to the process of apoptosis induced by growth factor withdrawal (24Greenberger J.S. Sakakeeny M.A. Humphries R.K. Eaves C.J. Eckner R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2931-2935Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 25Cleveland J.L. Troppmair J. Packham G. Askew D.S. Lloyd P. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Nunez G. Ihle J.N. Rapp U.R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2217-2226PubMed Google Scholar). For this reason we established NRAGE and vector stably transduced cell lines, to examine the contribution of NRAGE to this process. NRAGE expression was determined by Western blotting (data not shown). The proliferation rate of these cells was not affected by the stable integration of the retroviral vector or NRAGE protein expression (data not shown). Cell survival after IL-3 withdrawal was measured by trypan blue exclusion. As shown in Fig.2A, the vector-transduced cells behave identically to the parental cells. In contrast, expression of NRAGE had a dramatic effect on the kinetics of cell death in 32D cells. The survival curves for NRAGE and the vector/parental lines diverge very early on (12 h), and this trend continues throughout the experiment. At the 24-h time point about three times as many dead cells were observed with the NRAGE-expressing cell pool. This indicates that NRAGE greatly accelerates the cell death process upon growth factor withdrawal in this IL-3-dependent promyeloid leukemic cell line. Over a 24-h period we analyzed the interaction of NRAGE with endogenous XIAP in 32D cells. Fig.3A, upper panel, shows the binding of NRAGE with XIAP is undetectable in proliferating 32D cells; however, 8–12 h after IL-3 withdrawal we observed an induction of binding, trailing off thereafter, and becoming undetectable at 16 h, as seen in Fig. 3 A, upper panel. To investigate the consequence of NRAGE-XIAP interaction in 32D cells after IL-3 withdrawal, we examined endogenous XIAP protein levels. Fig.3 B, upper panel, shows that XIAP cleavage occurs very early in NRAGE-transduced cells and leads to rapid loss of XIAP protein. In contrast, Fig. 3 C shows XIAP cleavage is barely detectable in vector-transduced cells at 24-h IL-3 withdrawal, and the loss of XIAP protein occurs at a greatly reduced rate compared with NRAGE expressing cells. Forced Bcl-2 expression in 32D cells has been shown to be very effective in rescuing the cells from the induction of apoptosis by a variety of stimuli, including withdrawal (21Wang H.G. Rapp U.R. Reed J.C. Cell. 1996; 87: 629-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). We therefore wanted to test whether it could also block the death-inducing activity of NRAGE. 32D cells stably expressing Bcl-2 were infected with either the retroviral control vector or the retrovirus containing FLAG-NRAGE and selected as described above. 24 h after IL-3 withdrawal, the 32D cells expressing Bcl-2 gained a 100% increase in survival compared with the wild type cells, and no significant difference was seen in the 32DBcl-2 vector-transduced cells. However the 32DBcl-2 cells expressing NRAGE showed a dramatic reduction in survival, completely abolishing any protection given by Bcl-2 (Fig. 2 B). This would suggest that NRAGE is a pro-apoptotic protein despite Bcl-2 expression, after growth factor withdrawal. Besides Bcl-2 proteins, the IAP family members constitute the largest group of pro-survival proteins. Members of this heterogeneous family are mainly defined by the presence of a BIR domain, a novel zinc binding fold, and the ability to suppress apoptosis (26Clem R.J. Miller L.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5212-5222Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). BIR domains mediate caspase binding and inhibition and are both necessary and sufficient for the anti-apoptotic function of IAP proteins (27Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar). While the anti-apoptotic function of Bcl-2 is well understood (13Reed J.C. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3225-3236Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar), very little is known about the mechanisms that control IAP function. In an attempt do define possible regulators we carried out a yeast two-hybrid screen with the avian IAP and ITA and can demonstrate that the newly discovered NRAGE binds to the IAP proteins ITA and XIAP. For ITA, the interaction with NRAGE occurs independent of the BIR motif but requires the presence of the RING domain, which is present in c-IAP1, c-IAP2, and XIAP but is lacking in NAIP. Consistent with this we also fail to detect interaction of NAIP with NRAGE. Moreover, our results demonstrate that expression of NRAGE in the IL-3-dependent promyeloid cell line 32D accelerates cell death following growth factor withdrawal even in the presence of Bcl-2. XIAP was previously shown to undergo caspase-mediated cleavage during apoptosis (32Johnson D.E. Gastman B.R. Wieckowski E. Wang G-Q. Amoscato A. Delach S.M. Rabinowich H. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1818-1823PubMed Google Scholar). Coexpression of NRAGE led to accelerated XIAP cleavage and further degradation of XIAP during apoptosis in 32D cells, while in the control cells this process occurred at a much reduced rate. The role of the RING domain of IAPs in the process of apoptosis suppression remains controversial. While the RING domain of c-IAP2 has been shown to be important in TNF-mediated NF-κB survival signaling (28Chu Z.L. McKinsey T.A. Liu L. Gentry J.J. Malim M.H. Ballard D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10057-10062Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar), it was not necessary for caspase inhibition (29Roy N. Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6914-6925Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a recent report demonstrated that the RING domains of cIAP1 and XIAP possess ubiquitin ligase activity upon apoptosis induction, resulting in degradation of these proteins (30Yang Y. Fang S. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. Ashwell J.D. Science. 2000; 288: 874-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that proteins binding to this region might regulate this process. NRAGE has been shown initially to induce apoptosis signaling by blocking the physical association of p75NTR with TrkA (15Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (1647) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to one of the observations of Salehi et al. (14Salehi A.H. Roux P.P. Kubu C.J. Zeindler C. Bhakar A. Tannis L.L. Verdi J.M. Barker P.A. Neuron. 2000; 27: 279-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), we saw no effect on proliferation by stable expression of NRAGE, 2B. Jordan, unpublished data. which could be due to the surviving cell population expressing a level of NRAGE low enough not to induce cell cycle arrest, but still able to interfere with apoptosis. Similarly, IAP proteins cIAP1 and cIAP2 have first been identified as part of the related TNF-receptor signaling complex (3Rothe M. Pan M.G. Henzel W.J. Ayres T.M. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 83: 1243-1252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). The ability of NRAGE to interfere with the intrinsic cell death pathway that is triggered by IL-3 withdrawal points to a novel function of NRAGE in apoptosis signaling. It is commonly assumed that Bcl-2 proteins interfere with the process of caspase activation at the mitochondrial level (13Reed J.C. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3225-3236Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar), while the IAPs have been shown to act at the receptor level (3Rothe M. Pan M.G. Henzel W.J. Ayres T.M. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 83: 1243-1252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar) and post-mitochondrially in the assembly of the apoptosome (31Bratton S.B. Walker G. Srinivasula S.M. Sun X.M. Butterworth M. Alnemri E.S. Cohen G.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 998-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). We performed in vitro caspase cleavage assays utilizing recombinant NRAGE and XIAP proteins, but were unable to see an influence of NRAGE on XIAP anticaspase activity (data not shown). We currently have little understanding of exactly which step NRAGE influences XIAP cleavage, and it thus remains to be established whether NRAGE may function on the level of promoting caspase recruitment rather than altering enzyme activity. Interestingly, we observed a very high level of expression ofnrage in mouse brain tissue. 3B. Jordan, unpublished data. It has been previously described that in embryonic chick primary neurons, ITA expression is required for NGF-mediated survival (18Wiese S. Digby M.R. Gunnersen J.M. Gotz R. Pei G. Holtmann B. Lowenthal J. Sendtner M. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 978-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). It remains to be seen whether IAP-NRAGE determines the signaling outcome from the NGF receptor. In summary, our data suggest that IAP activity may be controlled by heterodimerization with proteins such as NRAGE. Future work will dissect the mechanisms that govern the interplay of these molecules in survival control.

https://openalex.org/W2145647298,"Siglecs are immunoglobulin superfamily member lectins that selectively recognize different types and linkages of sialic acids, which are major components of cell surface and secreted glycoconjugates. We report here a human Siglec-like molecule (Siglec-L1) that lacks a conserved arginine residue known to be essential for optimal sialic acid recognition by previously known Siglecs. Loss of the arginine from an ancestral molecule was caused by a single nucleotide substitution that occurred after the common ancestor of humans with the great apes but before the origin of modern humans. The chimpanzee Siglec-L1 ortholog remains fully functional and preferentially recognizes N-glycolylneuraminic acid, which is a common sialic acid in great apes and other mammals. Reintroducing the ancestral arginine into the human molecule regenerates the same properties. Thus, the single base pair mutation that replaced the arginine on human Siglec-L1 is likely to be evolutionarily related to the previously reported loss of N-glycolylneuraminic acid expression in the human lineage. Siglec-L1 and its chimpanzee Siglec ortholog also have a different expression pattern from previously reported Siglecs because they are found on the lumenal edge of epithelial cell surfaces. Notably, the human genome contains several Siglec-like pseudogenes that have independent mutations that would have replaced the arginine residue required for optimal sialic acid recognition. Thus, additional changes in the biology of sialic acids may have taken place during human evolution."

In animal models, 4HPR can inhibit carcinogenesis in breast, bladder, lung, ovary, and prostate. Various clinical trials involving chemoprevention of cancers of the breast, prostate, cervix, skin, and lung have also been conducted (1Formelli F. Barua A.B. Olson J.A.

J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1999; 91: 1099-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The mechanism through which 4HPR induces apoptosis is not sufficiently understood. 4HPR can function as a prooxidant in many tumor cell lines (4Oridate N. Suzuki S. Higuchi M. Mitchell M.F. Hong W.K.

These observations led to the assumption that ROS generation is the primary mechanism of action as far as apoptosis induction is concerned (5Delia D. Aiello A. Meroni L. Nicolini M. Reed J.C. Pierotti M.A. Carcinogenesis. 1997; 18: 943-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 6Hail Jr., N. Lotan R. Cancer Epidemiol.

In support of this conclusion, recent reports have illustrated the involvement of ROS and MPT in the process of 4HPR-induced apoptosis, as well as demonstrating a mitochondrial role in 4HPR-induced ROS production (6Hail Jr., N. Lotan R. Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev. 2000; 9: 1293-1301PubMed Google Scholar, 9Suzuki S. Higuchi M. Proske R.J. Oridate N. Hong W.K. Lotan R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6380-6387Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Several studies have elegantly established the involvement of the mitochondria and mitochondrial-derived factors in the process of apoptosis (10Pastorino J.G. Chen S.-T. Tafani M. Snyder J.W.

Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6257-6266PubMed Google Scholar). The mitochondria are attractive targets for cancer chemotherapy. There is growing evidence, both in isolated mitochondria and in intact cells, illustrating many cancer chemotherapeutic agents modulate or interfere with mitochondrial functions to promote MPT (14Costantini P. Jocotot E. Decaudin D. Kroemer G. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 1042-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Mitochondria constitute 15–50% of the total cytoplasmic volume in most cells and participate in more metabolic functions than any other organelles, especially in cellular energy production (15Modica-Napolitano J.S. Steele G.D. Chen L.B. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 3369-3373PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the mitochondria consume ∼90% of cellular oxygen and are a significant source of ROS, which if unchecked, are deleterious to mitochondrial and other cellular functions (16Chance B. Sies H. Boveris A. Physiol. Rev. 1979; 59: 527-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (4851) Google Scholar, 17Turrens J.F. Biosci. Rep. 1997; 17: 3-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). We have reported previously that the prooxidant property of 4HPR is linked to MPT, which is required for apoptosis in human cutaneous SCC cells (6Hail Jr., N. Lotan R. Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev. 2000; 9: 1293-1301PubMed Google Scholar). The present study was conducted to determine whether the prooxidant and apoptotic effects of 4HPR could be inhibited by modulating mitochondrial function in these cells. This approach was taken to determine whether the mitochondria were the primary targets associated with the acute cytotoxicity of 4HPR in SCC cells. The results presented here support the involvement of mitochondrial respiration in 4HPR-induced hydroperoxide production and apoptosis. In particular, the data indicate the prooxidant quality of 4HPR can be explained via an enzymatic process occurring at a quinone-binding site in Complex I and/or center o of Complex III. The COLO 16 cell line was derived from a metastatic lesion in a female patient who succumbed to metastatic SCC (18Moore G.E. Merrick S.B. Woods L.K. Arabasz N.M. Cancer Res. 1975; 35: 2684-2688PubMed Google Scholar). The SRB-12 cell line was derived from cells taken from an epidermal lesion on a patient undergoing skin cancer treatment at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. SCC cells were routinely cultured in keratinocyte growth medium, consisting of keratinocyte basal medium supplemented with 100 ng/ml human recombinant epidermal growth factor and 0.4% bovine pituitary extract (BioWhittaker/Clonetics, San Diego, CA) unless otherwise specified. Cell cultures were incubated at 37 °C in humidified air containing 5% CO2. Treatment with 4HPR and other agents was performed on subconfluent cultures. 4HPR was obtained from Dr. Ronald Lubet (Division of Cancer Prevention and Control, NCI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). AA, CoQ0, CoQ1, capsaicin, carboxin, CCCP, DB, Me2SO, H2O2 (30% solution), HQNO, KCN, myxothiazol, rotenone, stigmatellin, TTFA, and Vit-C were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. CsA, DPI, and OA were purchased from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Dihydroethidium, DCFDA, and DiOC6 (3Reed J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1999; 91: 1099-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) were purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Respiration-deficient SCC cells (ρ0 clones) were isolated according to a previously described method (19King M.P. Attardi G. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 304-313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with limited modifications. Briefly, COLO 16 and SRB-12 cells were cultured for 8 weeks in enriched medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4.5 mg/ml glucose (Sigma); 110 mg/ml pyruvate (Sigma); 50 mg/ml uridine (Sigma); 100 ng/ml ethidium bromide (Sigma); and 2% dialyzed (3,500 molecular weight cutoff) fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc. Grand Island, NY). Clones were isolated by limiting dilution culture in enriched medium. The effects of chronic exposure to ethidium bromide on mitochondrial DNA and respiration in isolated clones were assessed by three methods. First, when cultured in enriched medium without uridine the clones exhibited greatly diminished cell survival (not shown). ρ0 cells have been reported to become pyrimidine auxotrophs, suggesting respiration is defective in these cells (19King M.P. Attardi G. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 304-313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, a PCR procedure was used to detect mitochondrial DNA sequences in DNA samples from parental cells and their respective clones. The PCR reaction was conducted as specified for 40 cycles in a thermal cycler using a primer set (L1, 5′-AACATACCCATGGCCAACCT-3′ and H1, 5′-GGCAGGAGTAATCAGAGGTG-3′) designated for the detection of total mitochondrial DNA (20Wei Y.-H. Kao S.-H. Lee H.-C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 786: 24-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Using this method, PCR products derived from mitochondrial DNA were detected in parental cells, but were absent in their ρ0 clones (not shown). Finally, oxygen consumption rates in the isolated clones were ∼15% of those observed in parental cells (see Fig. 3 A), illustrating that the ρ0clones were functionally deficient in respiration. Treatment of ρ0 clones was conducted 24 h after culture in enriched medium without ethidium bromide. Oxygen consumption was measured polarographically using a Clark-type oxygen electrode and YSI Model 5300 Biological Oxygen Monitor (Yellow Spring Instrument Co., Yellow Springs, OH). Approximately 6 × 106 cells suspended in 3 ml of their respective culture medium were added to a 3-ml respiration chamber in a circulating water bath at 37 °C. Oxygen consumption was measured over a 10-min period after equilibration of the electrode in the respiration chamber. Respiration rates for cells were normalized (nmol of O2/min/106 cells) assuming an O2concentration of 220 μm in air-saturated media at 37 °C (21Estabrook R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 41-47Crossref Scopus (1897) Google Scholar). In certain determinations, 4HPR was added directly to cell suspensions (final concentration 10 μm) in the respiration chamber for a 10-min exposure. Control cells received an equal volume of the vehicle Me2SO. For longer exposures, 4HPR and/or other agents were added directly to the media of cells cultured in 10-cm plastic tissue culture plates. The cells were harvested by trypsinization, pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended at a density of ∼2 × 106 cells/ml in fresh media at 37 °C, and 3 ml of the cell suspension was placed in the respiration chamber. Oxygen consumption rates were obtained during the final 10 min of exposure. Cell viability was routinely checked via Trypan blue exclusion after oxygen consumption determinations. Hydroperoxide production was determined using DCFDA. Cells in 10-cm plastic tissue culture plates were treated for 30 min with 20 μm DCFDA and 4HPR or Me2SO. The cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed in 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline at 37 °C, pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline at 37 °C and analyzed immediately by flow cytometry. Evaluations of ΔΨm dissipation, superoxide production, and DEVDase activity were adapted from previously published methods (13Marchetti P. Zamzami N. Joseph B. Schraen-Maschke S. Méreau-Richard C. Costantini P. Métivier D. Susin S.A. Kroemer G. Fromstecher P. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6257-6266PubMed Google Scholar) with limited modifications. For concurrent determination of ΔΨm dissipation and superoxide production, cells in 10-cm plastic tissue culture plates were treated with agents alone or in combination for various periods. Twenty minutes before the cells were harvested, DiOC6 (3Reed J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1999; 91: 1099-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and dihydroethidium were added directly to the culture medium to a final concentration of 30 nm and 5 μm respectively. The cells were harvested as described above, resuspended in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline at 37 °C, and analyzed immediately by flow cytometry. DEVDase-like caspase activity was determined with PhiPhiLux-G1D2 (Oncoimmunin Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) a cell permeant fluorogenic substrate (DEVD-rhodamine), which is cleaved in a DEVD-dependent manner (13Marchetti P. Zamzami N. Joseph B. Schraen-Maschke S. Méreau-Richard C. Costantini P. Métivier D. Susin S.A. Kroemer G. Fromstecher P. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6257-6266PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were treated in 10-cm plastic tissue culture plates as described above. Following treatment, the cells were harvested by trypsinization, incubated in 10 μm PhiPhiLux-G1D2, and washed according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The resulting cell suspension was analyzed immediately by flow cytometry. Intranucleosomal DNA fragmentation was evaluated using an apoptosis detection kit (Phoenix Flow Systems, Inc., San Diego, CA) that is based on the TUNEL technique. The reaction labels the 3′-hydroxyl termini of DNA fragmented during apoptosis with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated dUTP (22Li X. Traganos F. Melamed M.R. Darzynkiewicz Z. Cytometry. 1995; 20: 172-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Cells were also stained with propidium iodide as a relative indicator of DNA content. After treatment, the cells were detached with trypsin. The cells were then combined with their respective culture medium that was removed prior to trypsinization. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation, fixed, and stained using the protocol provided in the apoptosis detection kit with limited modifications (6Hail Jr., N. Lotan R. Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev. 2000; 9: 1293-1301PubMed Google Scholar). All flow cytometric procedures were performed on a Coulter XL flow cytometer, and data analysis was accomplished using System II XL software (Coulter Corp., Miami, FL). Approximately 10,000 events (cells) were evaluated for each sample. In all cytofluorometric determinations, cell samples were initially gated to exclude cell debris and clumps. Rates of cellular hydroperoxide generation were determined using DCFDA as described previously (6Hail Jr., N. Lotan R. Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev. 2000; 9: 1293-1301PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were seeded in their respective culture medium in 6-well tissue culture plates and allowed to attach and proliferate for 24 h. The wells were washed twice with 2 ml of buffer A (Krebs-Ringer buffer containing 10 mm d-glucose, 120 mm NaCl, 4.5 mm KCl, 0.15 mm CaCl2, 0.7 mmNa2HPO4, 1.5 mmNaH2PO4, and 0.5 mmMgCl2 (pH 7.4 at 37 °C)). The wells were then covered with 2 ml of buffer A containing 20 μm DCFDA with Me2SO as a control, or with the indicated concentrations of other reagents and/or 4HPR. The plates were rocked for 2 min to ensure adequate mixing. Fluorescence was measured at time 0 (immediately following mixing) and subsequently at 30-min intervals over a 120-min period using a CytoFluor 4000 spectrofluorimeter (Perseptive Biosystems, Inc. Framingham, MA). The spectrofluorimeter preformed 13 fluorescence measurements per well and provided an average value. Hydroperoxide generation rates were derived from the slopes of lines obtained between 30 and 120 min from triplicate wells. Cultures were incubated at 37 °C between the 30-min intervals for fluorescence determination. Cell viability was routinely checked via Trypan blue exclusion at the conclusion of fluorescence determinations. Previous studies have used the oxidation of 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin to monitor 4HPR-induced hydroperoxide production (4Oridate N. Suzuki S. Higuchi M. Mitchell M.F. Hong W.K. Lotan R. J. Natl.

Oridate N. Hong W.K. Lotan R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6380-6387Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), as well as the retention of cationic probes to monitor changes in ΔΨm promoted by 4HPR treatment (6Hail Jr., N. Lotan R. Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev. 2000; 9: 1293-1301PubMed Google Scholar,9Suzuki S. Higuchi M. Proske R.J. Oridate N. Hong W.K. Lotan R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6380-6387Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Thus, to gain a perspective on the importance of hydroperoxide production in 4HPR-induced cell death, a kinetic analysis of the salient features associated with this process was conducted using COLO 16 cells. The experiment depicted in Fig.1 A shows that a 30-min exposure to 4HPR was sufficient to promote a shift in the mean DCF fluorescence intensity that was approximately 5-fold higher than Me2SO-treated control cells. This experiment was repeated substituting DCFDA, which specifically reacts with hydroperoxides, with dihydroethidium (5 μm), which is oxidized to ethidium via superoxide (23Buxser S.E. Sawada G. Raub T.J. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 300: 256-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, cells treated with 4HPR under these conditions for 30, 60, or 120 min exhibited ethidium fluorescence intensities similar to Me2SO-treated cells (not shown), indicating hydroperoxides are the primary ROS generated after 4HPR treatment. Whether 4HPR-induced hydroperoxide production is also contingent on superoxide dismutase activity remains to be determined. Several hallmark events occur in the mitochondria and cytoplasm of apoptotic cells that precede DNA fragmentation. Three such events are dissipation of ΔΨm, enhanced superoxide production, and caspase activation that are associated with MPT (24Kroemer G. Zamzami N. Susin S.A. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 44-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1384) Google Scholar, 25Kroemer G. Petit P. Zamzami N. Vayssière J.-L. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1277-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). Given ROS production can be both a cause and consequence of MPT (26Zoratti M. Szabò I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 139-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2199) Google Scholar, 27Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), mitochondrial parameters associated with MPT were examined in 4HPR-treated cells. The dissipation of ΔΨm represented by decreased retention of the cationic probe DiOC6 (3Reed J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1999; 91: 1099-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and enhanced superoxide production represented by the oxidation of dihydroethidium can be used concurrently to monitor MPT in intact cells (13Marchetti P. Zamzami N. Joseph B. Schraen-Maschke S. Méreau-Richard C. Costantini P. Métivier D. Susin S.A. Kroemer G. Fromstecher P. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6257-6266PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 B, control cells were gated assuming they exhibited high DiOC6 (3Reed J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1999; 91: 1099-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) fluorescence and low ethidium fluorescence. A 2-h exposure to 4HPR did not markedly influence the fluorescence intensities of either probe (not shown). However, after 4 h, ∼64% of the cell population had shifted to low DiOC6 (3Reed J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1999; 91: 1099-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) fluorescence. 8 h after treatment ∼95% of the cell population had shifted to low DiOC6 (3Reed J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1999; 91: 1099-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) fluorescence, and ∼36% of this population also exhibited high ethidium fluorescence indicating both a substantial dissipation of ΔΨm and enhanced superoxide production resulting from the disintegration of mitochondrial electron transport (13Marchetti P. Zamzami N. Joseph B. Schraen-Maschke S. Méreau-Richard C. Costantini P. Métivier D. Susin S.A. Kroemer G. Fromstecher P. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6257-6266PubMed Google Scholar). After 12 h, ∼59% of the cells displayed low DiOC6 (3Reed J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1999; 91: 1099-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) fluorescence and high ethidium fluorescence with the remaining cells low for both DiOC6 (3Reed J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1999; 91: 1099-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and ethidium fluorescence. These results imply 4HPR-induced hydroperoxide production precedes MPT in COLO 16 cells. The process of MPT did indeed enhance superoxide production apparently as a peripheral event because this phenomenon was not observed until most of the cell population displayed reduced ΔΨm. MPT induction results in the release of cytochromec and other soluble mitochondrial factors capable of inducing caspase activity (13Marchetti P. Zamzami N. Joseph B. Schraen-Maschke S. Méreau-Richard C. Costantini P. Métivier D. Susin S.A. Kroemer G. Fromstecher P. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6257-6266PubMed Google Scholar, 27Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 4HPR promoted DEVDase-like caspase activity in COLO 16 cells. As with enhanced superoxide production, this was not profoundly evident until 8 h after treatment (Fig.1 C). Interestingly, this activity decreased slightly after 12 h. These results suggest 4HPR-induced hydroperoxide production triggered MPT, and MPT was involved with caspase activity. Examination of DNA fragmentation promoted by 4HPR treatment revealed at least 10 h of exposure were required before >50% of the treatment population exhibited positive TUNEL staining (Fig.1 D). Me2SO-treated cells exhibited the same degree of TUNEL staining as 4HPR-treated cells after 6 h (∼9%) and remained basically unchanged at subsequent time-points. Between 8 and 10 h after 4HPR treatment, DNA fragmentation appeared to be most prominent with only a slight increase detectable after the following 2 h. Previous examination of COLO16 cells revealed a gradual increase in the number of TUNEL-positive cells from ∼60% to 90% of the treatment population 12–48 h after 4HPR treatment (6Hail Jr., N. Lotan R. Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev. 2000; 9: 1293-1301PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it can be concluded the culmination (DNA fragmentation) of 4HPR-induced cell death is a protracted process in COLO 16 cells evidently set in motion by hydroperoxide production and MPT. Hydroperoxide production appears to be the first detectable event associated with 4HPR-induced apoptosis. Hydrogen peroxide and other ROS can interfere with electron transport and disrupt mitochondrial function (17Turrens J.F. Biosci. Rep. 1997; 17: 3-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar, 28Zhang Y. Marcillat O. Giulivi C. Ernster L. Davies K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16330-16336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If hydroperoxide production is involved with the acute cytotoxic effects of 4HPR, we would expect to observe a decline in cellular oxygen consumption since mitochondria consume ∼90% of cellular oxygen (17Turrens J.F. Biosci. Rep. 1997; 17: 3-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, COLO 16 cells were treated with 4HPR first by adding the drug directly to cells suspended in the respiration chamber. However, a 10-min exposure neither enhanced (denoting an uncoupling effect) nor inhibited respiration relative to Me2SO-treated controls (not shown). As shown in Fig. 2 A, a 30-min exposure to 4HPR promoted a slight decrease in respiration, but this was negligible compared with an equivalent exposure to the Complex IV inhibitor cyanide (17Turrens J.F. Biosci. Rep. 1997; 17: 3-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). In addition, the effect of cyanide would indicate cellular oxygen consumption was predominantly of mitochondrial origin in COLO 16 cells. Sustained exposures to 4HPR decreased oxygen consumption by ∼40% after 2 h and ∼60% after 4 h (Fig.2 A). These results illustrate 4HPR can modulate mitochondrial function in intact cells. The antioxidant Vit-C can inhibit the prooxidant and apoptotic effects of 4HPR in COLO 16 cells (6Hail Jr., N. Lotan R. Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev. 2000; 9: 1293-1301PubMed Google Scholar). This prompted examination of this agent to determine whether it could also inhibit the decrease in respiration promoted by 4HPR. Exposure to Vit-C, while having no considerable impact on oxygen consumption at any of the time points examined, was able to block the effects of 4HPR. In addition, the activity of 4HPR appears to be distinctly different from cyanide because the decrease in respiration promoted by cyanide was not markedly influenced when combined with Vit-C (Fig. 2 A). These results suggest the prooxidant property of 4HPR is associated with the decrease in mitochondrial oxygen consumption. We have reported previously that CsA can reduce 4HPR-induced hydroperoxide production in SCC cells. This led to the conclusion some of the ROS production was associated with MPT (6Hail Jr., N. Lotan R. Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev. 2000; 9: 1293-1301PubMed Google Scholar). If this were the case, CsA, like Vit-C, should also inhibit the decrease in oxygen consumption promoted by 4HPR. However, a 2-h exposure to CsA alone also inhibited respiration in COLO 16 cells and only slightly suppressed the effect of 4HPR (Fig. 2 A). The decrease in respiration promoted by CsA can potentially be explained as follows. CsA binds to cyclophilin D to stabilize the closed matrix conformation of the adenine nucleotide translocator (26Zoratti M. Szabò I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 139-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2199) Google Scholar, 27Gr"

We previously established novel cytotoxic T-cells that are devoid of mLT expression,i.e. mLT− cytotoxic T-cells (5Miyake M. Horiuchi A. Kimura K. Abe Y. Kimura S. Hitsumoto Y. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 2147-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 6Horiuchi A. Abe Y. Miyake M. Kimura K. Hitsumoto Y. Takeuchi N. Kimura S. Clin. Exp.

Kimura S. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1994; 96: 152-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In the present study, we conducted cDNA subtraction between these two types of cells and obtained many interesting cDNA fragments using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based method developed by Lisitsyn et al. (7Lisitsyn N. Lisitsyn N. Wigler M. Science. 1993; 259: 946-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (1168) Google Scholar). Among them, a consensus cDNA fragment containing a serine/threonine kinase motif was identified, and a full-length cDNA was cloned. We deposited this kinase data in 1998 (GenBankTM accession number AB017505). In 2001, Ramsay reported a postulated human protein, dJ28H20.2 (CAC00561) that was identical to this kinase and had a chromosomal location of 20q13.1, based on the genomic data of a BAC clone of 28H20 (GenBankTM accession number: CAC00561, published only in the data base). Because we had not published our data at that time, their report was released first. In the present study, we report on our continued experiments into the important characteristics of this kinase. A cytotoxic T-cell cDNA subtraction fragment library was prepared using a PCR-based method (7Lisitsyn N. Lisitsyn N. Wigler M. Science. 1993; 259: 946-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (1168) Google Scholar, 8Abe Y. Matsumoto S. Kito K. Ueda N. J. Biol.

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were separated from a healthy donor with heparinization by discontinuous density gradient centrifugation using Ficoll-Conray (1.077). PBMC were cultivated with RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 400 IU/ml IL-2 and 0.4 μg/ml PHA at 37 °C, 5% CO2. On the fourth day of culture, cells were passaged with a medium containing IL-2 at a cell concentration of 0.5 × 106/ml and were then passaged again every 2 days (3Abe Y. Horiuchi A. Osuka Y. Kimura S. Granger G.A. Gatanaga T. Lymphokine Cytokine Res. 1992; 11: 115-121PubMed Google Scholar). The phenotypic expression of CD3 antigen on the IL-2-activated cytotoxic T-cells was >95%. After 7 days of culture, the cells were used for experiments as mLT+ cytotoxic T-cells because of their expression of membrane mLT on the cell surface (3Abe Y. Horiuchi A. Osuka Y. Kimura S. Granger G.A. Gatanaga T. Lymphokine Cytokine Res. 1992; 11: 115-121PubMed Google Scholar). To establish the deactivated form of cytotoxic T-cells, i.e.mLT− cytotoxic T-cells, cytotoxic T-cells were washed twice with PBS and cultured in medium without IL-2 for 18 to 24 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. The hyperactivated mLT2+cytotoxic T-cells were made by incubating the activated cytotoxic T-cells with 100 ng/ml phorbol myristate acetate (PMA; Sigma) for 3 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. The differences in the activities and phenotypic expressions between the activated and deactivated cytotoxic T-cells were previously reported (6Horiuchi A. Abe Y. Miyake M. Kimura K. Hitsumoto Y. Takeuchi N. Kimura S. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1994; 96: 152-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The mRNA was separated from both the activated and deactivated cytotoxic T-cells, and double-stranded cDNA was prepared using kits (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After the digestion of double-stranded cDNA by Sau3AI (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) at 37 °C for 3 h, cDNA fragments from both activated (sense) and deactivated (subtractor) cytotoxic T-cells were ligated with the R-primer set (R-Bgl 24: 5′-AGCACTCTCCAGCCTCTCACGGCA-3′; R-BglI2: 5′-GATCTGCGGTGA-3′) at both ends using T4 DNA ligase (Toyobo, Tokyo, Japan) after primer annealing. They were then amplified by PCR using AmpliTaq (Applied Biosystems, Urayasu, Japan) and R-Bgl 24 primer. The PCR products were digested by Sau3AI, and the sense fragments were then ligated with the J-primer set (J-Bgl 24: 5′-ACCGACGTCGACTATCCATGAACA-3′; J-BglI2: 5′-GATCTGTTCATG-3′) using T4 DNA ligase after primer annealing. The sense fragments ligated with the J-primer sets were mixed with an excess amount of subtractor fragments, and the mixture was heated up to 94 °C for 90 s after annealing at 67 °C for 20 h. The mixture was amplified by PCR using J-Bgl 24 primer (the first PCR subtraction), and the product was then treated again with Sau3AI. After the removal of digested small fragments, sense fragments were ligated with the N-primer set (N Bgl 24: 5′-AGGCAACTGTGCTATCCGAGGGAA-3′; N-BglI2: 5′-GATCTTCCCTCG-3′) using T4 ligase at both ends, and a PCR-based subtraction was carried out using N-Bgl 24 primer and an excess amount of subtractor fragments. The final PCR products were cloned using a pGEM-T cloning system (Promega, Madison, WI), and transformation was carried out using chemically competent JM109 Escherichia coli cells. Random sequencing of the library has been carried out, and the data were analyzed by a BLAST search on the BCM search launcher page (dot.imgen.bcm.tmc.edu:9331/seq-search/nucleic_acid-search.html) or on the Genome Net search launcher page (www.blast.genome.ad.jp/) on the Internet. Consensus cDNA fragments encoding a serine/threonine kinase were identified. Cloning of the human p53-related protein kinase (PRPK) was carried out using the Rapid Screen cDNA library panel of the human spleen (Origene Technologies Inc., Rockville, MD). A master plate of the human spleen origin was screened by PCR using a specific primer set (N2F2: 5′-GCCCCAGTTGTCTTTTTTGTGG-3′; N2B2: 5′- GAGCTACTCCACCTCCTCCAAAA-3′) that was designed from the above-mentioned cDNA fragment. Positive wells were selected, and the subplates responsible for each positive well were screened by PCR using the same primers. The colonies in the positive wells in subplates were screened by PCR again, and the positive clones were selected and then recloned. The plasmid vector employed in this library system is pCMV6-XL3. Four clones were obtained (N2–1 to N2–4). Sequencing analysis was carried out using a 310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems), a BigDye terminator system (Applied Biosystems) and specific sequencing primers. Cloning of the mouse PRPK was also carried out using the Rapid Screen cDNA library panel of mouse fetal tissue. Using the human PRPK data, a BLAST search was carried out, and some homologous fragments of mouse cDNA in the expressed sequence tag (EST) data base were found. Using these data, specific primers for mouse PRPK were designed: mN2F1: 5′-TGGAAGAAATCGAAGACTCGGTG-3′ and mN2B1: 5′-GAGACAAAGCTCAGCCCAAAGTC-3′. Screening of the master plate was carried out using this primer set, and three clones were finally obtained: mN2–1 to mN2–3. However, because these three clones did not have a methionine site at the 5′-terminal site responsible for human PRPK, cap site analysis of mRNA was carried out as follows. Transcriptional initiating point analysis based on the capping structure of mRNA was carried out using a Cap Site cDNA mouse spleen kit (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan) (8Abe Y. Matsumoto S. Kito K.

Two reverse primers of mouse PRPK in the cloned 5′-cDNA region were designed (mN2Cap1: 5′-TCACCGAGTCTTCGATTTC-3′; mN2Cap2: 5′-AAGAAGACGACTGGGGCAGCTATC-3′). The first PCR was carried out using mN2Cap1 and CR1 kit primers with a kit template and LA Taq polymerase (Takara, Tokyo, Japan). The second PCR was then carried out using mN2Cap2 and CR2 kit primers using the first PCR product as a template. The second PCR product was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, purified using a NucleoSpin Extract kit (Sawady, Tokyo, Japan) and cloned using a pGEM-T cloning system. The clones obtained by this method were subjected to sequencing analysis using a 310 Genetic Analyzer. A PCR-based cloning for the recombinant PRPK protein was carried out using pGEX-2TK and specific primers. PCR was carried out using specific primers (RecPRPKF-BamHI: 5′-TGGATCCATGGCGGCGGCCAGAGCTACTA-3′ and RecPRPKB-EcoRI: 5′-CGGAATTCTTCTACCCAACCATGGACCTCTTT-3′), LA-Taq polymerase (Takara), and a purified N2–2 plasmid of PRPK as a template. Both the PCR product and vector were digested by BamHI (Life Technologies, Inc., Manassas, VA) and EcoRI (Life Technologies, Inc.), and ligated using T4 ligase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Transformation was carried out using DH10B E. coli cells and an electroporator (Electro Cell Manipulator 600; BTX, Tokyo, Japan). Several colonies were picked up, and sequencing analyses were carried out using a 310 Genetic Analyzer. One clone (pGEX-PRPK) was selected, and a transformation of chemically competent BL21(DE3) cells was carried out. The GST·PRPK fusion protein was induced by addition of 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and culturing for 2.5 h after preculturing. BL21 cells were centrifuged and lysed by a sharing of genomic DNA using a 20-gauge needle as well as a sonication in the NETN buffer with lysozyme (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 100 μg/ml lysozyme). The supernatant of the cell lysate was mixed with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 3 h at room temperature and then washed thoroughly with PBS. The purified fusion protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis. An antibody specific to human PRPK was obtained in rabbits using gel-bound, recombinant GST-PRPK. After the final boost, blood was collected from the ear vein. The IgG fraction of the antisera was purified using protein G-Sepharose CL4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The anti-GST component of the antibody was adsorbed by recombinant GST protein bound to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The PRPK expression vector for a transient mammalian cell transfection was made using pcDNA3RGS-His-Tag vector and a PCR product. PCR was carried out using specific primers (RecPRPKF-BamHI and RecPRPKB-EcoRI) with LA Taq. The ligated product was used for the transformation of DH10B E. coli cells with an electroporation method. Several colonies were picked up and their sequences were analyzed with a 310 Genetic Analyzer. One clone was selected (pcDNA3RGS-PRPK). The plasmid was purified by a Maxi prep kit (Quiagen, Tokyo, Japan). A kinase-negative PRPK expression vector (pcDNA3RGS-PRPK-D183N) was made using a QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's procedure. PCR was carried out using specific primers (PRPK-KN-F: 5′AACAGCTGAACATTGTGCTCATAAACTTTGGGCTGAGTTTCATTTCA-3′ and PRPK-KN-B: 5′-TGAAATGAAACTCAGCCCAAAGTTTATGAGCACAATGTTCAGCTGTT-3′) and pcDNA3RGS-PRPK vector as a template. Chemically competent XL-Blue E. coli cells (Stratagene) were transformed by the PCR product after digestion with DpnI. Several colonies were picked up, and sequence analyses were carried out using a 310 Genetic Analyzer. Transfection of 293T and COS-7 cells was carried out using TransFast reagent (Promega, Madison, WI). Cells were grown in a φ = 60-mm culture dish overnight. After the culture medium was aspirated, a mixed solution of 5.0 μg of plasmid and 20 μl of transfection reagent in 1.4 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was added to the cells, followed by incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Three milliliters of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum was then added. After culturing for 48 h, the cells were harvested for analyses. PRPK-stable transfectants were established using pcDNA3RGS-PRPK and COS-7 cells. After digestion of pcDNA3RGS-PRPK vector with BglII, transfection to COS-7 cells was carried out using TransFast reagent. After culturing for 48 h, 500 μg/ml G418 (Sigma) was added and cultured for a week. The G418-selected cells were cloned by a limiting dilution method using COS-7 cells as feeder. Northern blotting was carried out using 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNAs isolated from different human normal tissues that had been fractionated by denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis and transferred onto the charged nylon membranes (OriGene Technologies). The blots were hybridized to a PRPK probe, which was labeled using a Megaprime kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and [α-32P]CTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The PRPK probe was made by PCR using RecN2F1-EcoRI and RecN2B1-BamHI primers and the PRPK plasmid as a template. Hybridization to the actin probe (OriGene Technologies) was performed as a control. To analyze the mRNA expression of the cell lines, RT-PCR analysis was carried out using a specific primer set of N2F2: 5′-GCCCCAGTTGTCTTTTTTGTGG-3′ and N2B2: 5′-TTTTGGAGGAGGTGGAGTAGCTC-3′. The total RNA was prepared from cells, and their cDNAs were synthesized using a kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) employing 1 μg of each RNA as a template. For the reference of total RNA contents, a PCR using specific primers for actin was carried out. PCR of 32 cycles was performed, and the products were subjected to agarose gel electrophoretic analysis. In vitro protein kinase activity was estimated using a recombinant GST·PRPK fusion protein and [γ-32P]ATP (0.11 teraBq/mmol, 3.0 Ci/mmol;Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Recombinant GST·PRPK or GST bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B gel was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with COS-7 cell lysate (5 × 106 cells/ml, 2 mg/ml) in 1× kinase buffer (25 mm HEPES, 25 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 25 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm Na3VO4) with the addition of 1% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After washing four times with 1× kinase buffer, GST·PRPK or GST gel with or without the addition of dephosphorylated casein (100 μg/ml, Sigma) in 1× kinase buffer was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. The enzymatic reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis. After electrophoresis, proteins in the gel were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad Laboratories) using a semidry blotter (BioCraft, Tokyo, Japan) for 60 min at 1 mA/cm2 and then exposed to x-ray film (BioMax film; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cell lines used in this study were HT-29 (American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) HTB 38) and WiDr (ATCC CCL 28) human colon epithelial malignant tumor cells; Daudi (ATCC CCL 213) and RPMI 1788 (ATCC CCL 156) human B-cell lymphomas; HUT 78 (ATCC TIB 161) human T-cell lymphoma, AsPC-1 (ATCC CRL 1682), MIA PaCa-2 (ATCC CRL 1420) and PANC-1 (ATCC CRL 1469) human pancreatic epithelial malignant tumor cells; MDA-MB-231 (ATCC HTB 26) breast epithelial malignant tumor cells; LNCaP (ATCC CRL 1740) human prostatic epithelial malignant tumor cells; 293T (9Aiello L. Guilfoyle R. Huebner K. Weinmann R. Virology. 1979; 94: 460-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) SV-40 T-antigen expressing cells derived from 293 (ATCC CRL 1573) adenovirus type 5 transformed human embryonic kidney cells; and COS-7 (ATCC CRL 1651) monkey SV-40 transformed fibroblast cells. Western blot analysis was carried out using a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) or nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) and an ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to the membrane using a semidry blotter for 60 min at 1 mA/cm2. The membrane was immersed in a blocking solution of 5% skim milk, PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 (Milk-PBST) for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was then incubated with anti-recombinant PRPK rabbit IgG, anti-p53 mouse monoclonal antibody (Clone DO-7; DAKO Japan, Kyoto, Japan) or anti-p53 phospho-Ser-15-specific rabbit antibody (Cell Signaling Tec., Beverly, MA) diluted in PBS, 5% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% Tween 20 (BSA-PBST) for 60 min at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C, and rinsed three times with washing buffer consisting of 0.1% Tween 20 and 0.15 m NaCl. The membrane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase conjugated with anti-rabbit or mouse IgG antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) in BSA-PBST for 60 min at room temperature and washed four times with washing buffer. The membrane was developed using the ECL solution and exposed to x-ray film (Hyper film; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). An in vitro phosphorylation assay based on immunoblotting was carried out using gel-bound GST·PRPK and recombinant GST·p53 peptide-(1–80). For the establishment of recombinant GST·p53 peptide, a PCR reaction was carried out using specific primers (Recp53F-BamHI: CGCGGATCCATGGAGGAGCCGCAGTCA and Recp53SB- EcoRI: CCGGAATTCTAAGGAGCTGCTGGTGCAGG) and pcDNA3-p53 vector that had been made earlier in our laboratory as a template. The PCR product was digested by BamHI and EcoRI and ligated with pGEX-2TK vector. DH10B E. coli cells were transformed by electroporation, and several colonies were picked up and subjected to sequence analysis. BL21 E. coli cells were transformed, and recombinant ma- terial was prepared as described above. Recombinant GST·p53 peptide was eluted by 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8 with 20 mmglutathione (Sigma) and was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. After incubation with COS-7 lysate in 1× kinase buffer as described for the in vitro kinase assay, recombinant GST·PRPK or GST gel was incubated with recombinant p53 peptide at 30 °C for 30 min in a 1× kinase buffer supplemented with 300 μm ATP. Sample buffer was added and heated up to 100 °C for 5 min. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and electroblotted to a nitrocellulose or polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Immunodetection was carried out using anti-p53 phospho-Ser-15-specific rabbit antibody and an ECL detection system. COS-7 cells transiently transfected with pcDNA3RGS-PRPK were cultured on a Chamber Slide System (Nalgene Nunc International, Tokyo, Japan) for 20 h. Cells on the slide were washed with PBS and fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde solution for 20 min at room temperature. The solution was then changed to 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS and incubated for 10 min. Cells were washed with PBS three times and incubated with 1% fetal bovine serum, 0.1% NaN3 in PBS for 1 h. They were then reacted with anti-RGS-His mouse monoclonal antibody (Qiagen) or anti-human p53 mouse monoclonal antibody (Clone D-7) followed by incubation with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Hematoxylin-eosin staining of COS-7 cells was also carried out. Cells were then observed using an OPTIPHOTO-2 microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) with a Sensis CCD camera system (Perceptive Scientific Instruments, League City, TX). PCR-based cloning of the BAC clone was carried out using the CITB Human BAC Clone system (Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL) and specific primers of N2F2 and N2B2. One clone (233L17) was finally obtained and confirmed by sequencing analysis. The purified vector was labeled with digoxigenin dUTP by nick translation. The labeled probe was mixed with sheared human DNA and hybridized to metaphase chromosomes derived from PHA-stimulated PBMC in a solution containing 5% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, and 2× SSC. Specific hybridization signals were detected by incubating the hybridized slides in FITC-labeled anti-digoxigenin antibody followed by counterstaining with 4,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole-2 HCl (DAPI) for one-color experiments. Probe detection for two-color experiments was accomplished by incubating the slides in FITC-labeled anti-digoxigenin antibody as well as in avidin Texas red followed by counterstaining with DAPI. Radiation hybrid analysis was carried out using GeneBridge4 system (UK MRC HGMP Resource Center, Cambridge, UK). The primers used in the PCR were N2F2 and N2B2. Data were analyzed using the Sanger Center home page at www.sanger.ac.uk/RHserver/RHserver.shtml. An intracellular transcriptional activity assay of p53, Myc, Rb, and E2F was carried out using a Mercury Pathway Profiling System (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions to examine the activity of cell signaling pathways. COS-7 cells were transfected with pcDNA3RGS-PRPK or mock vector on the first day. Vectors containing cis-acting enhancer elements were then transfected on the second day. On the third day of culture, the cells were harvested using a lysis buffer in a luciferase reporter assay kit (CLONTECH), and their luminescent activities were analyzed by exposing the reaction mixture to BioMax film. The intensities of the spots were calculated using PhotoShop software (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA). Disruption of the YGR262c gene in yeast was carried out as reported previously (10Nikawa J. Kawabata M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 860-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The DNA cassette for YGR262c disruption was prepared by three-step PCR using specific primers of P1: 5′-CATTATGACGCAAGAATTC-3′, P2: 5′-TGTATGGATCACACGCTATC-3′, P3: 5′-GGTAGTGATGAGTTGTTGAG-3′ and P4: 5′-TCCGCTGTCGTATTCATCAC-3′. To confirm the disruption, the URA3 gene was used as a marker. The cassette was used to replace the target YGR262c gene in the genomic DNA. For the galactose-dependent on-off switching of YGR262c expression, the promoter region of YGR262c was replaced by a GAL10 promoter in the same manner as described above. Finally, a pADNSΔE vector with the open reading frame of YGR262c or human PRPK was prepared, and the GAL10 promoter-replaced yeast cells were transformed by these vectors. Data were analyzed in this study using MacVector and DNAsis software on a SuperMac S900 computer (UMAX, Tokyo, Japan), and also at the Internet home page of Genome Net (www.genome.ad.jp/). Alignment analysis was carried out using the ExPaSy home page (www.expasy.ch/tools/scnpsit1.html) and the BCM search launcher page (dot.imgen.bcm.tmc.edu:9331/multi-align/multi-align.html). Human and mouse PRPK were cloned from a human spleen and a mouse fetal tissue library, respectively (Fig. 1). Human PRPK mRNA encodes 253 amino acids, while mouse PRPK mRNA encodes 244. These two proteins show 83% identity and 89% homology. The main difference between them occurs in 9 amino acids at the N-terminal domain. Amino acid sequence alignment of human PRPK and the yeast serine/threonine kinase, YGR262c was carried out (Fig. 2 A). Human PRPK and yeast YGR262c show 32% identity and 64% homology. As shown in Fig. 2 A, both proteins either lack or have mutations for some typical features of protein kinases. The G XG XXG pattern in the first motif was changed to K XG XXA in human PRPK and S XG XXA in YGR262c. The second motif, AMK, was changed to FPK and PPK in PRPK and YGR262c, respectively. The RDL XXXN pattern was changed to GDL XXXN in both proteins, and the APE pattern in the VIII motif was changed to VLE in both. Both proteins lack the XI motif. Thus, some characteristics of a protein kinase are partially lost in a very similar manner.Figure 2Comparisons of PRPK and YGR262c. A, the amino acid sequence alignment of PRPK and yeast serine/threonine kinase, YGR262c. The kinase subdomains are indicated on the bottom, and the typical common amino acid residues are shown on the top. Identical and homologous amino acid residues are indicated by boxes and shaded areas, respectively. B, schematic representations of YGR262c and human and mouse PRPK. The amino acid residue numbers are indicated on the top. PK, protein kinase domain; NLS-BP, bipartite nuclear localization signal.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The motifs of YGR262c and human and mouse PRPK were analyzed (Fig.2 B). YGR262c possesses only one motif of a protein kinase (PK), while both human and mouse PRPK also possess the bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS-BP). This suggests that PRPK is a nuclear protein. Phylogenetic analysis of PRPK, YGR262c, and their hypothetical relative proteins in various species showed that human and mouse PRPKs are the most closely related among them (Fig. 3 A). The alignment of these proteins in their central regions are depicted (Fig.3 B). The Northern blot analysis was carried out using normal human tissues (Fig.4). Testicular tissue markedly expressed PRPK mRNA. The size of mRNA was compatible with the cloned PRPK data of 1 kilobase pair. While PRPK was expressed faintly in heart, kidney, and spleen tissues, it did not appear to be expressed in any other normal human tissues. RT-PCR analysis was carried out using the cDNA of human cancer cell lines and mLT-positive and mLT-negative cytotoxic T-cells (Fig.5). In cancer cell lines, pancreatic cancer cells such as AsPC-1, PANC-1, and MIA PaCa-2 cells highly expressed PRPK mRNA. MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells and LNCaP human prostatic cancer cells also expressed PRPK weakly. HT-29 and WiDr human colon cancer cell lines or lymphotoxin-α-producing B-cell lines of Daudi and RPMI 1788 did not appear to express PRPK mRNA. Thus, some human adherent cancer cell lines of epithelial origin but not B-cell lymphoid tumor cell lines expressed PRPK. The activated form of mLT-positive cytotoxic T-cells highly expressed PRPK mRNA, while the deactivated form of mLT-negative cytotoxic T-cells did not. The hyperactivated form of mLT double positive cytotoxic T-cells,i.e. PMA-stimulated cytotoxic T-cells, also expressed it. Because IL-2-activated cytotoxic T-cell preparation does not consist of 100% CD3-positive cells, but contains less than 5% of NK-originated cells, panning was carried out using anti-CD3 mouse monoclonal antibody, followed by RT-PCR analysis. RT-PCR revealed that the panned cells also highly expressed PRPK mRNA (data not shown). The anti-PRPK antibody was employed in the Western blot analysis (Fig.6). A band was seen at 31 kDa in the untransfected 293T cells. By transfection of the pcDNA3RGS-PRPK vector to 293T cells, a band of RGS-His6-tagged PRPK was revealed having almost the same size as the natural PRPK. Anti-RGS-His antibody showed a responsible band of the same size in the transiently transfec"
https://openalex.org/W2055417411,"KIAA0305 is an uncharacterized member of the FYVE domain protein family. It is closely related to SARA, with about 50% identity in the carboxyl-terminal 800-amino acid region. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy using polyclonal antibodies raised against KIAA0305 revealed that it is enriched in early endosomes. The Myc-tagged version is also faithfully targeted to the early endosome. We have tentatively called KIAA0305 endofin (forendosome-associated FYVE-domain protein). The association of endofin with endosomes is mediated by its FYVE domain because deletion mutants lacking the central FYVE finger motif are distributed in the cytoplasm. In addition, a single point mutation in the FYVE finger motif at cysteine residue 753 (C753S) is sufficient to abolish its endosomal association. Its endosomal localization is also sensitive to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor, wortmannin. Using in vitro liposome binding assays, we demonstrate that Myc-tagged endofin associates preferentially with phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate, whereas the C753S point mutant was unable to do so. We also show that endofin co-localizes with SARA but that they are not associated in a common complex because they failed to co-immunoprecipitate in co-expressing cells. Endofin also does not associate with Smad2 nor behave like SARA in affecting transforming growth factor-β signaling. At high levels of expression, both endofin and SARA can cause an endosome aggregation/fusion effect. In COS7 cells, which can support high levels of exogenous protein expression, both proteins can also cause other structural anomalies in the endocytic pathway, as represented by enlarged vesicular structures. These endosomal aggregates/fusions accumulated endocytosed epidermal growth factor. Taken together, this report provides evidence to suggest that endofin and the highly related SARA are endosomal proteins with potential roles in regulating membrane traffic.

This is a multistep process that culminates in the transport of cargo to its intended destination via membrane-bound intermediates such as vesicles. Specificity of the system is implicitly critical, and protein-lipid interactions may contribute to the regulation of critical steps in the pathway. The role of protein-lipid interactions in regulating endocytic events has recently gained much support. An intensely researched area is the role of phosphoinositides or phosphorylated species of phosphatidylinositol (PI)1 in membrane trafficking (for reviews see Refs. 1Corvera S. D'Arrigo A. Stenmark H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 460-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar and 2Odorizzi G. Babst M. Emr S.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 229-235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). One of the most interesting phosphoinositides is phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P). PI3P is a product of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) activity. One of the direct protein targets of PI3P has recently been identified to be the early endosomal autoantigen 1 (EEA1). This protein binds to PI3P via a conserved motif called the FYVE domain. This domain is so named based on the four proteins first identified to contain it:Fab1p, YOTB, Vac1p, andEEA1 (3Stenmark H. Aasland R. Toh B.-H. D'Arrigo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24048-24054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). The FYVE domain is a highly conserved zinc-binding domain characterized by the presence of eight conserved cysteine residues, the third of which is flanked by characteristic basic amino acids: C X2C X9–39RRHHCR XC X4C X2–6C X4–48C X2C (where X represents nonconserved amino acid residues). A comparison of the structures of various FYVE domain-containing proteins suggests that the FYVE domain is a modular domain that can function independent of its location in the protein.The involvement of the FYVE domain in membrane trafficking is evidenced by the characterization of several mammalian FYVE domain-containing proteins such as EEA1, Hrs-2, Rabip4, and Rabenosyn-5 (for a review see Ref. 4Gillooly D.J. Simonsen A. Stenmark H. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The prototype EEA1 has been shown to interact with Rab5 and to mediate fusion and docking of early endosomes (5Simonsen A. Lippé R. Christoforidis S. Gaullier J.-M. Brech A. Callaghan J. Toh B.-H.

Mammalian Hrs-2 is highly expressed in neuronal cells and is implicated in regulating exocytotic vesicular transport at the synapse by binding SNAP-25 (8Bean A.J. Seifert R. Chen Y.A. Sacks R. Scheller R.H. Nature. 1997; 385: 826-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Rabip4 is reported to control early endosomal traffic between recycling and sorting endosomes (9Cormont M. Mari M. Galmiche A. Hofman P. Le Marchand-Brustel Y.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 98: 1637-1642Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar), whereas Rabenosyn-5 is involved in the regulation of early endosome fusion (10Nielsen E. Christoforidis S. Uttenweiler-Joseph S. Miaczynska M. Dewitte F. Wilm M. Hoflack B. Zerial M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 601-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). In addition, several yeast FYVE domain proteins such as Vac1p, Vps27p, and Fab1p have been shown to play vital roles in membrane trafficking events ranging from the regulation of endosome docking or fusion, endosome maturation, and vacuolar membrane efflux or degradation (for reviews see Refs. 2Odorizzi G.

Hrs-1 was initially identified as a protein that is activated in response to hepatocyte growth factor and binds to signaling molecules such as STAM and Smads (12Komada M. Kitamura N. Mol. Cell.

SARA (forSmad anchor for receptoractivation) was first identified as a mediator of the TGF-β signal transduction pathway via its ability to associate with Smads 2 and 3 (15Tsukazaki T. Chiang T.A.

This view is supported by the observation that the majority of the characterized mammalian FYVE domain proteins including Ankhzn (16Ito K. Ishii N. Miyashita A. Tominaga K. Kuriyama H. Maruyama H.

Cell. 1998; 95: 779-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar) are localized in early endosomes or vesicular structures in the cell. Of these proteins, the FYVE domain of Rabenosyn-5 is clearly demonstrated to be sufficient to target the protein to endosomal membranes (10Nielsen E. Christoforidis S. Uttenweiler-Joseph S. Miaczynska M. Dewitte F. Wilm M. Hoflack B. Zerial M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 601-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutation or deletion of the FYVE domain in EEA1 or SARA has been shown to cause mislocalization of the protein as well as abrogate its ability to regulate endocytosis or signal transduction, respectively (5Simonsen A. Lippé R. Christoforidis S. Gaullier J.-M. Brech A. Callaghan J. Toh B.-H. Murphy C. Zerial M. Stenmark H. Nature. 1998; 394: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar, 15Tsukazaki T. Chiang T.A. Davison A.F. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 779-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). In addition, a recent report utilizing a double FYVE domain derived from Hrs-1 fused to an enhanced green fluorescent protein reporter revealed the specific recruitment of this fusion protein to early endosomes. Together, these data support the notion that the FYVE domain functions by recognizing target membranes presumably enriched in PI3P (18Gillooly D.J. Morrow I.C. Lindsay M. Gould R. Bryant N.J. Gaullier J.-M. Parton R.G. Stenmark H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4577-4588Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). However, in apparent contradiction to this view, there are instances where the FYVE domain does not appear to be involved in targeting proteins to the early endosomes. One example is Frabin (FGD1-related F-actin-binding protein), which is not located in endosomes but co-localizes with F-actin instead (19Obaishi H. Nakanishi H. Mandai K. Satoh K. Satoh A. Takahashi K. Miyahara M. Nishioka H. Takaishi K. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18697-18700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Fgd1, in turn, has been localized in the cytoplasm, the subcortical actin cytoskeleton, and the Golgi apparatus, and its intracellular distribution does not appear to depend on the FYVE domain (20Estrada L. Caron E. Gorski J.L. Hum. Mol. Gen. 2001; 10: 485-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Also, PIKfyve is reported to co-localize primarily with Golgi-to-late-endosome markers (21Shisheva A. Rusin B. Ikonomov O.C. DeMarco C. Sbrissa D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11859-11869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In the case of Hrs-1, its endosomal localization is not mediated by the FYVE domain but by a 100-amino acid sequence in the carboxyl-terminal region of the molecule (22Hayakawa A. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29636-29642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the intracellular distributions of FYVE domain proteins can be highly variable and highlight the importance of determining the localization of new FYVE domain proteins and the underlying mechanism as an important step in understanding their biological roles in the cell.A Blast search of the database yielded the identification of 31 different mammalian proteins that contain the FYVE domain (23Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schåffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59153) Google Scholar). Currently, only a limited number of these proteins have been well characterized. KIAA0305 is an uncharacterized protein from Homo sapiens originally identified by the Kazusa DNA Research Institute (Chiba, Japan). A putative FYVE domain containing the characteristic conserved residues is present in the central region of KIAA0305, whereas its carboxyl-terminal region is closely related to that of SARA, another FYVE domain protein. SARA is localized to vesicular structures in the cell, and it is thought to regulate Smad2 function by recruiting the latter molecule to the correct subcellular compartment where it can propagate signaling events generated by the activated TGF-β receptor (15Tsukazaki T. Chiang T.A. Davison A.F. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 779-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). In this study, we describe the localization of KIAA0305, which we have named endofin, to early endosomes and the role of the FYVE domain in determining this property. We also show the localization relationship between endofin and SARA and their differential effects on endosomal structures. We propose that these two proteins may play a role in endosomal function.DISCUSSIONMembers of the FYVE domain family of proteins have been implicated in protein trafficking and signal transduction. In this study, we have characterized endofin (KIAA0305), a molecule that contains a FYVE domain and homologous to SARA. Our data suggest that endofin may be involved in membrane trafficking in the endosomal pathway.First of all, we have shown that endofin is a protein associated with the early endosome. EEA1 and Rabenosyn-5 are also localized in the early endosome and do so by virtue of the action of the FYVE domain. In contrast to Rabenosyn-5 where the FYVE domain is sufficient to correctly localize the protein, the FYVE domain of EEA1 by itself is insufficient and requires an additional adjacent 30-amino acid region (3Stenmark H. Aasland R. Toh B.-H. D'Arrigo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24048-24054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 34Lawe D.C. Patki V. Heller-Harrison R. Lambright D. Corvera S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3699-3705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In addition, there is the exceptional case of Hrs-1 where endosomal localization appears to be independent of the FYVE domain (22Hayakawa A. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29636-29642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 35Komada M. Masaki R. Yamamoto A. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20538-20544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). We have shown here that for endofin, the intact FYVE domain is necessary and sufficient to recruit the protein to vesicular endosomal structures in the cell.The purified FYVE domain of EEA1 has previously been shown to bind directly to liposomes containing specifically PI3P but not PI, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate, PI3,4P2, phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, or phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (28Gaullier J.-M. Simonsen A. D'Arrigo A. Bremnes B. Stenmark H. Nature. 1998; 394: 432-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 29Patki V. Lawe D.C. Corvera S. Nature. 1998; 394: 433-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Because PI3P is a product of PI 3-kinases, EEA1 binding to PI3P and its localization to endosomes are abrogated when PI 3-kinase activity is inhibited (24Patki V. Virbasius J. Lane W.S. Toh B.-H. Shpetner H.S. Corvera S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7326-7330Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). We have determined that the endosomal localization of endofin is also dependent upon PI 3-kinase activity. Furthermore, we show that endofin is able to associate preferentially with PI3P via the FYVE domain. Mutation of a single conserved cysteine residue within the endofin FYVE domain resulted in its inability to associate with PI3P or localize in vesicles. These experiments suggest that the function of the FYVE domain in endofin is to locate it to endosomes via its ability to associate with PI3P.SARA was earlier identified as a FYVE domain protein important in TGF-β signal transduction (15Tsukazaki T. Chiang T.A. Davison A.F. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 779-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). It has a domain structure and carboxyl-terminal sequences that are similar to endofin. A similar domain architecture has also been reported for a Caenorhabditis elegans protein kinase A anchoring protein (AKAPCE), identified by sequence-based bioinformatics methods (36Herrgård S. Jambeck P. Taylor S.S. Subramaniam S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 486: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). This molecule, however, does not contain a potential SBD, and it is unclear whether it has a functional FYVE domain because the second conserved cysteine residue is missing in the sequence. Nonetheless, based on the sequence similarities, these two molecules may form a subfamily of SARA-like proteins. We report here that endofin and SARA co-localize well in endosomal structures in the cell. This observation suggests that endofin and SARA may both function in the early endosome. We then addressed the question as to whether they cooperate with each other in a functional complex. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments using cells co-expressing both proteins revealed that endofin and SARA are not associated with each other, suggesting that the two proteins are likely to be found in separate complexes in the same endosomal compartment. Furthermore, endofin is unable to interact with Smad2 or to participate in TGF-β signaling in a manner similar to SARA, implying strongly that endofin and SARA are not functionally redundant molecules. Additional work is required to address the issue regarding the ability of endofin to associate with other Smad members and its potential role in other signaling pathways.Overexpression of several FYVE domain proteins has been reported to lead to changes in endosomal structure. Hrs-1, when overexpressed in HeLa cells, resulted in early endosomes that appear larger than normal or aggregated (35Komada M. Masaki R. Yamamoto A. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20538-20544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 37Urbé S. Mills I.G. Stenmark H. Kitamura N. Clague M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7685-7692Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Rabip4 overexpression in CHO cells has also been reported to lead to an increase in the size of early endosomes (9Cormont M. Mari M. Galmiche A. Hofman P. Le Marchand-Brustel Y.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 98: 1637-1642Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We describe a similar observation when endofin was overexpressed at high levels in both A431 and COS7 cells. The aggregated/fused or enlarged vesicular structures represent the early/recycling endocytic compartment because they contain both EEA1 and transferrin receptor, markers for the early and recycling endosomes, respectively. This is an interesting observation because early/recycling endosome expansion is associated with increased endosome fusion activity, such as that contributed by the active GTP-bound form of Rab5 (38Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Steele-Mortimer O. Lütcke A. Gruenberg J. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar) or by overexpression of wild-type Rab5 (34Lawe D.C. Patki V. Heller-Harrison R. Lambright D. Corvera S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3699-3705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Indeed, both Hrs-1 and Rabip4 have been implicated in early endosome function (9Cormont M. Mari M. Galmiche A. Hofman P. Le Marchand-Brustel Y.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 98: 1637-1642Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 39Komada M. Soriano P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1475-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). This suggests that endofin may also be involved in endosome fusion during endocytosis.The morphological changes in endosomes associated with endofin or SARA overexpression are distinctly profound in COS7 cells, which allow higher levels of expression of exogenous proteins. Although both endofin and SARA appear to cause mainly endosomal aggregation/fusion effects, there are differences in the frequency and nature of the endosome expansion effect. Endofin overexpression appears to cause a higher frequency of endosomal aggregation/fusion than SARA, whereas SARA overexpression seems to result in an endosomal enlargement effect that is more dramatic and in higher frequency than those observed for endofin. Simultaneous overexpression of both proteins did not significantly change the frequency of aggregate/fusion or vesicular enlargement events in comparison with overexpression of either protein alone. This suggests that the two proteins do not cooperate synergistically or additively with each other to cause aggregated/fused or enlarged endosomes. Our observations therefore raise the possibility that endofin and SARA are involved in endosome fusion activity but that they do so in separate and unique ways. These differential effects may be conferred by the amino-terminal regions of the two molecules because these are divergent from each other.The alterations in endosome morphology caused by overexpression of endofin may be attributed to the endofin FYVE domain because expression of this region alone is sufficient to cause the endosomal aggregation/fusion effects. This property of the endofin FYVE domain is likely to be unique and not common to other FYVE domains. For a start, as mentioned before, the FYVE domain of EEA1 by itself was insufficient to localize to endosome. Secondly, the FYVE domain of Hrs-1 is cytosolic when expressed alone (22Hayakawa A. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29636-29642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We also report that these aggregated endocytic structures represent dysfunctional endosomes because endocytosed EGF was retained and prevented from transport to lysosomes for proteolytic degradation. The amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions of endofin lacking the FYVE domain did not inhibit EGF degradation in the same experiment (data not shown). These findings, coupled with the observed differential effects resulting from overexpression of either endofin or SARA, suggest that although the endofin FYVE domain alone is sufficient to participate in endosome function, the actual role of endofin in the early endosomes may be moderated by other regions of the molecule. Further work is therefore required to discover the structural and molecular components involved in causing the differential endosomal effects contributed by either endofin or SARA.In summary, we report here that endofin is a ubiquitous protein present in the early endosomes and that its endosomal association is mediated by its FYVE domain. Although significant differences were observed with regards to the alteration of endosomal morphology resulting from overexpression of either endofin or SARA, the similar structure, endosomal localization, and observed alterations on endosomal compartment upon overexpression suggest that both molecules may be involved in endosome function. Future work involves addressing the specific role and molecular targets of endofin in the endocytic pathway. The movement of proteins between different membrane compartments of a cell requires the process of intracellular membrane trafficking. This is a multistep process that culminates in the transport of cargo to its intended destination via membrane-bound intermediates such as vesicles. Specificity of the system is implicitly critical, and protein-lipid interactions may contribute to the regulation of critical steps in the pathway. The role of protein-lipid interactions in regulating endocytic events has recently gained much support. An intensely researched area is the role of phosphoinositides or phosphorylated species of phosphatidylinositol (PI)1 in membrane trafficking (for reviews see Refs. 1Corvera S. D'Arrigo A. Stenmark H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 460-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar and 2Odorizzi G. Babst M. Emr S.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 229-235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). One of the most interesting phosphoinositides is phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P). PI3P is a product of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) activity. One of the direct protein targets of PI3P has recently been identified to be the early endosomal autoantigen 1 (EEA1). This protein binds to PI3P via a conserved motif called the FYVE domain. This domain is so named based on the four proteins first identified to contain it:Fab1p, YOTB, Vac1p, andEEA1 (3Stenmark H. Aasland R. Toh B.-H. D'Arrigo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24048-24054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). The FYVE domain is a highly conserved zinc-binding domain characterized by the presence of eight conserved cysteine residues, the third of which is flanked by characteristic basic amino acids: C X2C X9–39RRHHCR XC X4C X2–6C X4–48C X2C (where X represents nonconserved amino acid residues). A comparison of the structures of various FYVE domain-containing proteins suggests that the FYVE domain is a modular domain that can function independent of its location in the protein. The involvement of the FYVE domain in membrane trafficking is evidenced by the characterization of several mammalian FYVE domain-containing proteins such as EEA1, Hrs-2, Rabip4, and Rabenosyn-5 (for a review see Ref. 4Gillooly D.J. Simonsen A. Stenmark H. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The prototype EEA1 has been shown to interact with Rab5 and to mediate fusion and docking of early endosomes (5Simonsen A. Lippé R. Christoforidis S. Gaullier J.-M. Brech A. Callaghan J. Toh B.-H.

Nature. 1999; 397: 621-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). Mammalian Hrs-2 is highly expressed in neuronal cells and is implicated in regulating exocytotic vesicular transport at the synapse by binding SNAP-25 (8Bean A.J. Seifert R. Chen Y.A. Sacks R. Scheller R.H. Nature. 1997; 385: 826-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Rabip4 is reported to control early endosomal traffic between recycling and sorting endosomes (9Cormont M.

A. 2000; 98: 1637-1642Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar), whereas Rabenosyn-5 is involved in the regulation of early endosome fusion (10Nielsen E. Christoforidis S. Uttenweiler-Joseph S.

Class II contains extracellular fungal peroxidases such asCoprinus cinereus peroxidase (a peroxidase essentially identical to Arthromyces ramosus peroxidase) and lignin-degrading peroxidases. Class III contains secretory plant peroxidases, typified by the classical horseradish peroxidase isoenzyme C (HRPC).1The peroxidases of classes II and III share a number of structural elements considered to be of importance for maintaining protein stability and activity.

Mazumdar S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). These observations demonstrate the essential role played by the structural calcium ions in HRPC in maintaining a heme pocket architecture conducive to high activity. The present work extends previous spectroscopic studies of Ca2+-depleted HRPC to obtain further insight into the consequences on the heme environment of removing calcium from the enzyme. On the basis of the present results, the relative importance of the proximal and distal calcium ions in determining the heme pocket structural properties is discussed.DISCUSSIONThe two calcium ions and four disulfide bridges present in class II and III peroxidases are structural elements that have attracted much interest. The determination of their precise roles in maintaining the heme pocket structure, with consequent important implications for enzyme activity, offers significant scope for resolving questions of peroxidase structure-function properties and identifying potential biotechnological applications. The essential nature of these features is, in fact, clearly revealed by Ca2+ depletion of HRPC. Both the present and previous (10Haschke R.H. Friedhoff J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 80: 1039-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 11Shiro Y. Kurono M. Morishima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9382-9390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) work on Ca2+-depleted HRPC demonstrate that removal of calcium leads to profound changes in enzyme activity and electronic structure of the heme iron. In all cases the specific activity is reduced to ∼50% that of native after calcium removal despite that, in the present study, only one Ca2+ ion is lost upon Ca2+ depletion, whereas both Ca2+ ions were reported to be lost in the previous work. Nevertheless, it is clear that Ca2+ ions are necessary for optimum catalysis but are not essential for low levels of activity. Similar behavior was found for another class III peroxidase upon loss of both Ca2+ions, peanut peroxidase (42Rodriguez Maranon M.J. Stillman M.J. van Huystee R.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), whereas the class II peroxidases MNP and LIP were rendered inactive following loss of either one or two Ca2+ ions after a less drastic thermal or alkaline pH treatment, respectively (6Nie G.J. Aust S.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5113-5119Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 7George S.J. Kvaratskhelia M. Dilworth M.J. Thorneley R.N.F. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 8Sutherland G.R.J. Zapanta L.S. Tien M. Aust S.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3654-3662Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Such contrasting behavior between proteins of the two peroxidase classes, in which the Ca2+ions appear indispensable for activity in class II peroxidases, may be due to the different locations of the disulfide bridges in the two classes. In the specific cases of HRPC and LIP, it has been noted that the cysteine present in distal helix B of HRPC can form a disulfide bridge and limit flexibility of the helix. Formation of such a disulfide bridge is not possible in LIP, which thus favors binding of the distal His residue in LIP to the heme iron after calcium release forming an inactive LS species (7George S.J. Kvaratskhelia M. Dilworth M.J. Thorneley R.N.F. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the close proximity of this disulfide bridge (Cys44–Cys49) to the distal calcium site may have a stabilizing influence on the local structure, absent in LIP, hindering loss of the distal Ca2+ion in HRPC. The foregoing considerations find support in a recent study of MNP (43Reading N.S. Aust S.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8161-8168Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The insertion of an additional disulfide bond close to the distal Ca2+ ion-binding site resulted in an apparent increase in the stability of the heme environment and active state of the protein. The particular significance of the Ca2+ ions and disulfide bridges to protein stability has been underlined by a comparative study of HRPC and the class I peroxidase cytochromec peroxidase in the presence of denaturants (44Tsaprailis G. Chan D.W.S. English A.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2004-2016Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The considerably lower kinetic stability found for cytochrome cperoxidase was attributed to the absence of these two stabilizing structural elements.The details of the local structure in the proximity of the distal and proximal Ca2+ ion-binding sites are now available from the x-ray structure determination of native HRPC (Fig. 1) (4Gajhede M. Schuller D.J. Henriksen A. Smith A.T. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 1032-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Both Ca2+ ion sites are seven-coordinate with ligands composed of side chain oxygens and carbonyl groups and one water molecule in the case of the distal site. The distal and proximal Ca2+ ions are structurally coupled to the active site (His42 and His170, respectively) through an intermediate residue adjacent in sequence (Asp43 and Thr171, respectively). Each of these intermediate residues provides two bonds to the corresponding Ca2+ ion; therefore, the loss of either Ca2+ ion has considerable potential to perturb the active site structural and catalytic properties. Nevertheless, there have been some indications from previous work that one of the two Ca2+ ions may play a more essential role in maintaining the heme pocket structural characteristics necessary for high catalytic activities (11Shiro Y. Kurono M. Morishima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9382-9390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Ogawa S. Shiro Y. Morishima I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 90: 674-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The observation of NMR spectral changes upon titration of Ca2+ ions to Ca2+-depleted HRPC, where both Ca2+ ions were reported lost, indicated that one Ca2+ ion was determinant for the protein structure (11Shiro Y. Kurono M. Morishima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9382-9390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,45Ogawa S. Shiro Y. Morishima I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 90: 674-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). A similar Ca2+ ion titration NMR study of the Ca2+-depleted (with loss of both Ca2+ ions) class III peanut peroxidase, was inconclusive concerning the relative contribution of each Ca2+ ion site to the structural properties and activity of the enzyme (46Barber K.R. Rodriguez Maranon M.J. Shaw G.S. van Huystee R.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 825-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Reconstitution of Ca2+-depleted HRPC with 45Ca demonstrates that in the present study only one Ca2+ ion is lost upon Ca2+ depletion. However, as will become particularly evident from the following discussion, the structural properties of both the distal and proximal sides of the heme are modified by Ca2+ depletion of HRPC. To shed further light on the question of which Ca2+ ion is lost from HRPC upon Ca2+ depletion, the evidence that favors either the distal or proximal Ca2+ ion is now discussed on the basis of the body of currently available data for HRPC.The present study clearly reveals that, contrary to the native protein, a bis-histidyl LS heme is formed in reduced Ca2+-depleted HRPC. This indicates, as suggested by a previous study (11Shiro Y. Kurono M. Morishima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9382-9390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), that loss of calcium has induced a conformational change in the heme pocket. This leads to alterations of the distal side heme structure enabling the imidazole group of the distal histidine to bind to the sixth coordination position of the reduced heme iron. It is noteworthy that such effects are not noted in the ferric Ca2+-depleted form. In fact, the behavior of the ferric enzyme at alkaline pH appears to follow closely that of native HRPC, indicating that hydroxyl binding to the heme iron is favored over coordination of the distal His and, hence, that the ferric distal pocket is not extensively perturbed by Ca2+ depletion. The formation of a bis-histidyl LS heme following Ca2+ depletion has been noted for LIP (with loss of either only the distal Ca2+ ion or both Ca2+ions) (6Nie G.J. Aust S.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5113-5119Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 7George S.J. Kvaratskhelia M. Dilworth M.J. Thorneley R.N.F. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and MNP (upon loss of the distal Ca2+ ion) (8Sutherland G.R.J. Zapanta L.S. Tien M. Aust S.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3654-3662Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar,9Sutherland G.R.J. Aust S.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8567-8573Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar); however, in these cases the LS species was observed in both the ferric and ferrous states. The presence of a bis-histidyl LS heme in Fe(II) Ca2+-depleted HRPC apparently favors the case of loss of the distal Ca2+ ion, as proposed for MNP (8Sutherland G.R.J. Zapanta L.S. Tien M. Aust S.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3654-3662Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Conversely, the similarities of the Fe(III) Ca2+-depleted properties at alkaline pH to those of the native protein suggest a relatively minor disturbance of the distal cavity occurs upon Ca2+ depletion. If one recalls that LS heme is formed in MNP (47Kishi K. Hildebrand D.P. Kusters-van Someren M. Gettemy J. Mauk A.G. Gold M.H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4268-4277Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and Fe(II) HRPC (27Howes B.D. Veitch N.C. Smith A.T. White C.G. Smulevich G. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) following mutation of the proximal Phe residue, which is stacked approximately parallel to the proximal histidine ligand, it is evident that proximal effects can be transmitted to the distal cavity inducing some flexibility in the position of the distal histidine. It is therefore suggested that the contrasting observations noted for the ferric and ferrous states can be reconciled if the proximal Ca2+ ion is lost from HRPC upon Ca2+ depletion. The example of the proximal Phe221 → Met HRPC mutant is particularly appropriate as it mimics in many ways the behavior of the Ca2+-depleted enzyme. In common with Ca2+-depleted HRPC, the ferric mutant protein at neutral pH is characterized by a dominant QS heme state (see below) and the ferrous state by the presence of a significant proportion of LS heme. Nevertheless, the spectral characteristics of the ferrous CO and ferric BHA adducts closely resemble those of the native. Analogous behavior is observed for Ca2+-depleted HRPC in the presence of CO and BHA, suggesting that modification of the distal cavity by Ca2+depletion is not particularly extensive and/or can be easily reversed. Furthermore, it provides evidence that strongly favors loss of the proximal Ca2+ ion as the origin of these distal effects.A particularly relevant study in the context of the present discussion is that of the Glu64 HRPC mutants (48Tanaka M. Ishimori K. Morishima I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2629-2638Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The Glu64 residue is linked to the distal Ca2+ ion through a hydrogen bond with a water molecule. Changes in the position of the distal His and Arg residues in the mutants, leading to a substantial depression of the catalytic activity, was attributed to dissociation of the distal Ca2+ ion. Interestingly, despite loss of the distal Ca2+ ion, the geometry of the heme in the Glu64 mutants was found to be very similar to the native protein, and there was only minor perturbation around the proximal His. Hence, the structural properties of the Glu64 mutants have little in common with those displayed upon Ca2+ depletion, where completely contrasting behavior is observed, the distal cavity suffering only minor changes whereas the proximal cavity is considerably perturbed (see below). Consequently, this supports loss of the proximal Ca2+ ion in Ca2+-depleted HRPC. Moreover, it suggests that the distal Ca2+ ion is of limited importance and that the proximal Ca2+ ion is responsible for retaining the heme geometry and coordination structure of the proximal ligand.The marked downshift (27 cm−1) of the Fe-Im stretching frequency observed in reduced Ca2+-depleted HRPC compared with the native indicates a significant weakening of the bond between the iron atom and the proximal histidine residue. This reflects a marked change in the strength of the hydrogen bond between the conserved proximal His and Asp residues characteristic of peroxidases, which imparts a pronounced imidazolate character to the proximal His and results in higher ν(Fe-Im) frequencies than found for other heme proteins (39Kitagawa T. Spiro T.G. Biological Applications of Raman Spectroscopy. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1988: 97-131Google Scholar). Furthermore, it demonstrates that substantial structural changes of the heme environment in the vicinity of the proximal histidine are induced by Ca2+ depletion. In fact, the Fe-Im stretching frequency occurs at 220 cm−1 in myoglobin, where the proximal His is hydrogen-bonded with a neutral peptide carbonyl group (49Kitagawa T. Nagai K. Tsubaki M. FEBS Lett. 1979; 104: 376-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), and at 196 cm−1 in the Fe2+ protoporphyrin IX histidine complex, where the proximal His is not involved in hydrogen bonding interactions (50Othman S. Le Lirzin A. Desbois A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9781-9791Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In this context, it should be recalled that the residue adjacent to the proximal His (Thr171) provides two coordination bonds to the proximal Ca2+ ion (Fig. 1) (4Gajhede M. Schuller D.J. Henriksen A. Smith A.T. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 1032-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar); hence one might reasonably expect that loss of this Ca2+ ion would cause a change in the disposition of the histidine leading to a weakening of the His–Asp hydrogen bond and, therefore, of the heme iron-His170 interaction.Native Fe(III) HRPC is characterized at room temperature by a QS state having a very low level of intermediate-spin admixed with the high-spin state (19Smulevich G. Paoli M. Burke J.F. Sanders S.A. Thorneley R.N.F. Smith A.T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7398-7407Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 20deRopp J.S. Mandal P. Brauer S.L. La Mar G.N. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 4732-4739Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 21Veitch N.C. Smith A.T. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 2001; 51: 107-162Crossref Google Scholar). In ferric Ca2+-depleted HRPC at pH 7.8, however, the pentacoordinate QS state becomes more fully expressed compared with the native protein, having a greater relative proportion of IS compared with HS in the quantum mechanical admixture, as demonstrated by the higher frequencies of the core size marker bands of the Ca2+-depleted form. It constitutes, together with a 5-c HS form, one of the two major heme states of Ca2+-depleted HRPC; 6-c HS and 6-c LS states are also present at very low levels. The appearance of the QS state is particularly interesting. This heme species is uncommon in biological systems. Known examples include the neutral pH form of cytochrome c′ (51Fujii S. Yoshimura T. Kamada H. Yamaguchi K. Suzuki S. Shidara S. Takakuwa S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1251: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 52Othman S. Richard P. Vermeglio A. Desbois A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9224-9234Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and class III peroxidases (18Smulevich G. Biospectroscopy. 1998; 4: 3-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Feis A. Howes B.D. Indiani C. Smulevich G. J. Raman Spectrosc. 1998; 29: 933-938Crossref Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the biological significance and structural properties of the heme that give rise to the QS state remain obscure (24Howes B.D. Schiødt C.B. Welinder K.G. Marzocchi M.P. Ma J.-G. Zhang J. Shelnutt J.A. Smulevich G. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 478-492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Hence, the presence of this unusual heme state cannot be exploited as a means to uncover subtle modifications to the heme environment associated with Ca2+ depletion. In this regard, however, a recent report (27Howes B.D. Veitch N.C. Smith A.T. White C.G. Smulevich G. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) has revealed that mutation of the proximal Phe221 residue of HRPC also produces a QS heme state, whereas the many distal mutants of HRPC that have been characterized lack such a state (18Smulevich G. Biospectroscopy. 1998; 4: 3-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the appearance of a QS heme state in Ca2+-depleted HRPC in concomitance with a significant weakening of the Fe-Im bond suggests that disturbance of the proximal, rather than distal, heme domain may be more important in the generation of this heme state. It is noted that, in contrast to the Ca2+-depleted protein, in the case of the Phe221 mutant a strengthening of the Fe-Im bond was observed. This was attributed to the loss of the π-π interaction between the approximately parallel stacked aromatic rings of the His170 and Phe221 residues, reduction in the steric constraints imposed on the proximal His residue and, consequently, a modification of the His disposition.In summary, evaluation of the experimental data available for HRPC, both from this study and previous work, firmly favors the proximal Ca2+ ion as that which is lost upon Ca2+depletion and which likely plays the more critical role in regulating the heme pocket structural and catalytic properties. Peroxidases of the plant peroxidase superfamily are heme-containing enzymes that oxidize a variety of aromatic molecules in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. They include peroxidases of plant, fungal, and prokaryotic origins that can be divided into three classes based on sequence alignment (1Welinder K.G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1992; 2: 388-393Crossref Scopus (766) Google Scholar). Additional support for such a classification was gained as the crystal structures of representative enzymes of each class became available. Class I contains bacterial peroxidases and peroxidases from plant mitochondria and chloroplasts, for example most ascorbate peroxidases and cytochrome cperoxidase. Class II contains extracellular fungal peroxidases such asCoprinus cinereus peroxidase (a peroxidase essentially identical to Arthromyces ramosus peroxidase) and lignin-degrading peroxidases. Class III contains secretory plant peroxidases, typified by the classical horseradish peroxidase isoenzyme C (HRPC).1 The peroxidases of classes II and III share a number of structural elements considered to be of importance for maintaining protein stability and activity. These include calcium-binding sites proximal and distal to the heme and four disulfide bridges (1Welinder K.G. Curr. Opin. Struct.

These features are absent in class I peroxidases. Class III peroxidases also have a loop insertion in the sequence, composed of the D′, F′, and F“ helices, not found in the other classes. The relationship between calcium binding and enzyme inactivation has been treated primarily by studies on lignin peroxidase (LIP) (6Nie G.J. Aust S.D.

To develop a better understanding of axonal guidance at the molecular level, we used the SH2 domain of Dock to purify a protein complex from fly S2 cells. Five proteins were obtained in pure form from this protein complex. The largest protein in the complex was identified as Dscam (Down syndrome celladhesion molecule), which was subsequently shown to play a key role in directing neurons of the fly embryo to correct positions within the nervous system (Schmucker, D., Clemens, J. C., Shu, H., Worby, C. A., Xiao, J., Muda, M., Dixon, J. E., and Zipursky, S. L. (2000) Cell 101, 671–684). The smallest protein in this complex (p63) has now been identified. We have named p63 DSH3PX1 because it appears to be the Drosophila orthologue of the human protein known as SH3PX1. DSH3PX1 is comprised of an NH2-terminal SH3 domain, an internal PHOX homology (PX) domain, and a carboxyl-terminal coiled-coil region. Because of its PX domain, DSH3PX1 is considered to be a member of a growing family of proteins known collectively as sorting nexins, some of which have been shown to be involved in vesicular trafficking. We demonstrate that DSH3PX1 immunoprecipitates with Dock and Dscam from S2 cell extracts. The domains responsible for the in vitro interaction between DSH3PX1 and Dock were also identified. We further show that DSH3PX1 interacts with the Drosophila orthologue of Wasp, a protein component of actin polymerization machinery, and that DSH3PX1 co-immunoprecipitates with AP-50, the clathrin-coat adapter protein. This evidence places DSH3PX1 in a complex linking cell surface receptors like Dscam to proteins involved in cytoskeletal rearrangements and/or receptor trafficking.

Src homology 3 Src homology 2 PHOX homology radioimmune precipitation assay RNA Interference Axon guidance is a form of cell movement in which the cell body remains stationary while a specialized structure at the tip of the axon, known as the growth cone, receives signals from the environment and translates these signals into directed neurite outgrowth (reviewed in Ref. 1Tessier-Lavigne M. Goodman C.S. Science. 1996; 274: 1123-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (2661) Google Scholar). Growth cone movement is accomplished via adhesion molecules that modulate attachment to the extracellular matrix and neighboring cells (2Kamiguchi H. Lemmon V. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 598-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 3Kamiguchi H. Lemmon V. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3676-3686Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, growth cones express guidance receptors responsive to extracellular ligands that convey attractive or repulsive signals, thereby specifying the direction of growth (4Chisholm A. Tessier-Lavigne M. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1999; 9: 603-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Although a number of guidance receptors have been reported, the mechanisms by which these receptors coordinate changes in the actin cytoskeleton of the growth cone are not well understood. Several years ago, a genetic screen designed to find genes important in axonal guidance identified a Drosophila protein known as Dock that was essential for the guidance of photoreceptor axons in third instar larva (5Garrity P.A. Rao Y. Salecker I. McGlade J. Pawson T. Zipursky S.L. Cell. 1996; 85: 639-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Dock contains three tandem SH31 domains and a single SH2 domain and is the fly orthologue of the mammalian protein, Nck. Using an epitope-tagged SH2 domain of Dock, we recently isolated a novel receptor-like molecule known as Dscam, the Drosophilaorthologue of the human Down’s syndrome cell adhesion molecule (DSCAM), which is essential for guidance of embryonic axons within Bolwig’s nerve and elsewhere in the developing nervous system of the fly (6Schmucker D.

Dscam was one of five proteins found in the complex isolated using the Dock epitope-tagged SH2 domain. We have now identified and characterized the smallest protein in this complex, p63. We have named p63, DSH3PX1, because it appears to be the Drosophilaorthologue of the human protein known as SH3PX1. DSH3PX1 contains an SH3 domain, a PHOX homology (PX) domain, and a coiled-coil domain. The PX and coiled-coil domains are found in a number of proteins involved in vesicular trafficking including members of the sorting nexin family (7Parks W. Frank D. Huff C. Renfrew Haft C. Martin J.

Biol. 1998; 18: 7278-7287Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). One of the earliest identified sorting nexins, SNX1, was isolated based on its ability to bind to the cytoplasmic domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor and to enhance degradation of ligand-activated receptors (8Kurten R.C. Cadena D.L. Gill G.N. Science. 1996; 272: 1008-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The PX domain is a conserved stretch of ∼130 amino acids of unknown function, first identified in the p40phox and p47phox subunits of the NADPH oxidase complex (10Ponting C.P. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2353-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). PX domain-containing proteins belong to a large family of hydrophilic molecules, most of which are found partially associated with cellular membranes. Recently, the NMR solution structure for the PX domain of p47phox was determined (11Hiroaki H. Ago T. Ito T. Sumimoto H. Kohda D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 526-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In addition, the p47phox PX domain and others, including the PX domain of sorting nexin SNX3, were also shown to mediate binding to phosphoinositides, thereby targeting these proteins to cellular membranes (12Xu Y. Hortsman H. Seet L. Wong S. Hong W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 658-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 13Wishart M. Taylor G. Dixon J. Cell. 2001; 105: 817-820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Using a two-hybrid screen employing DSH3PX1, we demonstrate that this putative sorting nexin interacts directly with the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (Wasp). Members of the Wasp family are multidomain proteins that serve as scaffolds, bringing together components of signal transduction pathways with cellular machinery that promote actin polymerization and microfilament reorganization (14Zigmond S.H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: F117-F120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Higgs H.N. Blanchoin L. Pollard T.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15212-15222Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 16Higgs H.N. Pollard T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32531-32534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Execution of this program then leads to formation of protrusive, actin-based membrane structures at the cell surface. When activated by Cdc42 and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, the Wasp homologue, N-Wasp, induces long actin microspike formation (17Miki H. Miura K. Takenawa T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5326-5335Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Recently Nck and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate have been shown to synergistically activate actin polymerization through N-Wasp in an in vitro actin pyrene assay (18Rohatgi R. Nollau P. Ho H. Kirschner M. Mayer B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26448-26452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). N-Wasp has also been shown to be essential in nerve growth factor-stimulated neurite extension in PC12 cells, presumably through Arp2/3 complex-induced actin polymerization (19Banzai Y. Miki H. Yamaguchi H. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11987-11992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Wasp’s ability to promote the polymerization of actin has also been implicated in endocytosis (20Munn A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1535: 236-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Ligand-activated epidermal growth factor receptor was found associated with N-Wasp (21She H.Y. Rockow S. Tang J. Nishimura R. Skolnik E.Y. Chen M. Margolis B. Li W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1709-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and lymphocytes from Wasp knockout mice exhibited both a reduction in actin polymerization and defects in T cell receptor endocytosis (22Snapper S.B. Rosen F.S. Mizoguchi E. Cohen P. Khan W. Liu C.H. Hagemann T.L. Kwan S.P. Ferrini R. Davidson L. Bhan A.K. Alt F.W. Immunity. 1998; 9: 81-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Endocytosis of cell surface receptors often involves clathrin-coated pits, which are composed of a clathrin lattice and the AP2 protein complex (23Brodin L. Low P. Shupliakov O. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 312-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 24Hirst J. Robinson M.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 173-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we demonstrated that DSH3PX1 co-immunoprecipitated with AP-50, one of the clathrin coat adaptor proteins also known as μ2 (25Zhang Y.Q. Broadie K. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 233: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Collectively, our results suggest that DSH3PX1 links Dscam signaling to Wasp, a protein capable of modulating the actin cytoskeleton, and that this activity may serve to regulate the intracellular trafficking of Dscam. Schneider 2 (S2) cells were grown in Schneider Drosophila medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin in 75-cm2 cell culture flasks (Corning) at room temperature. S2 cells were transfected with the Drosophila expression vector, pAC5.1/V5-His (Invitrogen), containing the coding sequences for Wasp and AP-50, using Fugene (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with the following protocol. 6 × 106 cells were plated onto a 100-mm dish and allowed to attach for at least 3 h. 32 μl of Fugene was added to 800 μl of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium and mixed gently by inversion followed by a 5-min incubation period, after which 16 μg of DNA was added, followed by an additional 20-min incubation. This mixture was gently layered over the cells, which were incubated an additional 48–72 h. Stable transformants were selected using the aforementioned S2 growth medium containing 200 μg/ml Hygromycin B (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). RNAi experiments were conducted as described previously (26Clemens J.C. Worby C.A. Simonson-Leff N. Muda M. Maehama T. Hemmings B.A. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6499-6503Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). A detailed protocol has also been recently published (27Worby C.A. Simonson-Leff N. Dixon J. Science's STKE. 2001; (http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;2001/95/pl1)PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, S2 cells were diluted to 1 × 106 cells/ml in serum-free DES medium (Invitrogen) with 2 mm glutamine. Typically, 1 ml of the cell suspension is added to one well of a six-well culture dish (Corning). 15 μg of double-stranded RNA corresponding to the protein of interest were then added to each well. 2 ml of Schneider Drosophila medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum were added after 30 min. Cells were harvested 4 days after treatment. The procedure was scaled to suit the needs of particular experiments. Primers used to create the PCR template for double-stranded RNA production incorporate the T7 promoter 5′ to the gene-specific sequences. Primer sequences used to make PCR templates are as follows: DSH3PX1, GenBankTM accession number AF223381, sense primer 1124–1139, antisense primer 1749–1765; Dock, accession number U57816, sense primer 1544–1564, antisense primer 2200–2181; Wasp, FlyBase ID FBgn0024273 predicted cDNA, sense primer 204–221, antisense primer 823–808. Polyclonal antisera were raised in rabbits against recombinant fusion proteins for Dock, DSH3PX1, and Dscam (Cocalico, Reamstown, PA). The Tyr(P) antibody (4G10) and V5 epitope antibody were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., and Invitrogen, respectively. Affinity columns for purification of antisera were produced by coupling the appropriate recombinant fusion protein to an Affi-Gel support (Bio-Rad) according to the protocol supplied by the manufacturer. Eluted fractions containing antibody were combined and concentrated in 1× phosphate-buffered saline using a Centricon Plus 20 centrifugal filtration device (Millipore Corp.). For immunoprecipitations, cell extracts were made from ∼1 × 107 Schneider 2 cells. Cells were collected by centrifugation and lysed by repeated passage through a 25-gauge needle in 1 ml of RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.2 mm sodium vanadate, 10 mm NaF, 0.4 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol) containing protease inhibitors. Extracts were cleared by ultracentrifugation at 107,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C. 3 μl of affinity-purified antibody were added to 450 μl of extract supernatant and incubated at 4 °C on a rocker platform. After 1 h, 50 μl of Protein A-agarose (Life Technologies, Inc.) were added to bind immune complexes. Following an additional 1 h of incubation on the rocker platform at 4 °C, samples were washed four times with RIPA buffer, resuspended in 50 μl of Laemmli loading buffer, and stored frozen at −20 °C. For Western analysis, 10-μl samples were electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore) at 100–105 V for 1 h in transfer buffer (12 mm Tris base, 96 mm glycine, 20% methanol) cooled to −20 °C. Affinity-purified antibodies were used at the following dilutions: anti-DSH3PX1 (1:5000), anti-Dock (1:1000), anti-Dscam (1:1000), anti-Tyr(P) (1:5000), and anti-V5 (1:1000). All antibodies were diluted in blotting solution consisting of Tris-buffered saline with 5% dried milk and 0.1% Tween or consisting of 4% ovalbumin and 0.2% Tween for 4G10 Westerns. Either goat anti-rabbit IgG or goat anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody (1:3000) from Bio-Rad was used where appropriate. HRPL reagents (National Diagnostics) were used to detect immunoreactive proteins by chemiluminescence. Blots were exposed to Biomax MR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). S2 cell extract was prepared by lysing 8 × 107 cells in 4 ml of RIPA buffer as described above. GST-tagged proteins for each of Dock’s 3 SH3 domains and its SH2 domain were expressed in bacteria and purified on glutathione agarose (28Worby C.A. Clemens J. Dixon J. Spector D.L. Goldman R.D. Leinwald L.A. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 1-10Google Scholar). 1 ml of S2 extract was mixed with 10 μg of protein attached to beads, incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with rocking, washed three times with RIPA (1 ml each), and resuspended in 50 μl of Laemmli loading buffer. 5 μl were analyzed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and Western blotted using antibodies directed against DSH3PX1. Full-length DSH3PX1 was fused in-frame into pLexAde and transfected into the L40 yeast strain. These cells were then transfected with a pACT Drosophila third instar larva cDNA library (Stephen J. Elledge, Baylor College of Medicine (29Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.L. Yeh S.H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar)), and positive colonies were isolated as described (30Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Briefly, 11 million transformants were assayed for a positive two-hybrid interaction on histidine-deficient plates, followed by confirmation with a β-galactosidase filter assay. The bait plasmid was selectively removed, aided by ADE selection (30Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), and pACT fusions were isolated and sequenced. The β-galactosidase assay was scored as follows: blue color apparent by 15 min (+++), blue color apparent by 30 min (++), blue color apparent by 45 min (+), and either no blue color apparent or blue color apparent after 1 h (−). To identify tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins that are capable of interacting with Dock, a hexahistidine-tagged Dock-SH2 domain was stably expressed in S2 cells (S2HisSH2). The overexpression of Dock-SH2 domain in these cells leads to the accumulation of specific tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. This is presumably because the SH2 domain protects these phosphorylated proteins from endogenous tyrosine phosphatases. Proteins complexed to the epitope-tagged SH2 domain of Dock were purified by nickel-agarose affinity chromatography and visualized by Western analysis using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (4G10) (Fig. 1 A,left panel). The eluate from the nickel column was further purified by 4G10 affinity chromatography (6Schmucker D. Clemens J.C. Shu H. Worby C.A. Xiao J. Muda M. Dixon J.E. Zipursky S.L. Cell. 2000; 101: 671-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). Elution of the proteins from this column, subsequent separation by SDS-PAGE, and visualization by Coomassie staining resulted in the recovery of five protein bands (Fig. 1 A, right panel). The band designated p63 was excised from the gel and digested with trypsin, and the peptides were separated by high pressure liquid chromatography. Sequence analysis of the tryptic peptides provided five unambiguous amino acid sequences (underlined in Fig.1 B) that were used to search the Berkeley Drosophila Genome data base for corresponding expressed sequence tags. One expressed sequence tag, LD17205, was sequenced in its entirety, and it encoded the full-length protein sequence shown in Fig. 1 B. All of the predicted peptides obtained for p63 were encoded in expressed sequence tag LD17205. p63 contained two well conserved domains, an NH2-terminal SH3 domain (gray shading) and an internal PX domain (black shading). In addition, the last 20 amino acids are predicted to form a coiled-coil structure (clear box, Fig. 1 C) (31Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3441) Google Scholar). p63 contains two proline-rich (pxxp) motifs which could serve as binding sites for SH3 domains. The first is present at amino acid 86 and the second is contained within the PX domain at amino acid 274 (Fig.1 B, gray boxes) (10Ponting C.P. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2353-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The presence of a PX domain places p63 in the growing family of hydrophilic membrane-associated sorting nexins believed to be involved in vesicular trafficking and targeting (8Kurten R.C. Cadena D.L. Gill G.N. Science. 1996; 272: 1008-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 9Haft C.R. de la Luz Sierra M. Barr V.A. Haft D.H. Taylor S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7278-7287Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 32Barr V.A. Phillips S.A. Taylor S.I. Haft C.R. Traffic. 2000; 1: 904-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The presence of the SH3 domain is uncommon for sorting nexins, but it is found in human sorting nexin 9 (SNX9), also known as SH3PX1 (33Howard L. Nelson K.K. Maciewicz R.A. Blobel C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31693-31699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment of p63 with human and Caenorhabditis elegans orthologues shows a high degree of identity, especially in the SH3 and PX domains (Fig.2). Furthermore, the proline-rich sequence found in the PX domain is conserved among these species, while the P XXP motif present at amino acid 86 is not conserved in the human orthologue (Fig. 2). Based on the similar domain arrangement and high degree of identity, we named Drosophila p63 DSH3PX1.Figure 2Amino acid sequence alignments for DSH3PX1 orthologues. Alignments of the amino acid sequences for Drosophila, human, and C. elegans SH3PX1.Dark shading represents sequence identity, and light shading represents sequence similarity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since DSH3PX1 had been purified using the SH2 domain of Dock, we thought it was important to demonstrate that the two molecules associate with one another in vivo. Fig.3 A shows that DSH3PX1 co-immunoprecipitates with Dock from S2 cell extracts. However, only a fraction of the endogenous DSH3PX1 is tyrosine-phosphorylated, and it is this form of the protein that is preferentially co-immunoprecipitated by Dock-specific antibodies, as is evident from Fig. 3 B. The most obvious conclusion to draw from these results is that Dock's SH2 domain mediates the association with DSH3PX1-pY. However, since DSH3PX1 also contains two P XXP motifs, it is conceivable that the Dock SH3 domains could also participate in the observed protein-protein interaction. To better define the binding of DSH3PX1 and Dock, GST fusions of the three SH3 domains and the SH2 domain of Dock were isolated from bacteria and used in an in vitro pull-down assay. Protein extracts were prepared from S2 cells, and pull-down assays using the GST fusion proteins are shown in Fig. 3 C. In S2 cell extracts, the SH3.3 domain is able to interact weakly with DSH3PX1 either alone or in the context of SH3 domains 1–3. However, the principal interaction between DSH3PX1 and Dock appears to be through Dock's SH2 domain. Since DSH3PX1 resembles a sorting nexin, we sought to determine if it is capable of interacting with Dscam and, if so, whether the interaction is dependent upon the presence of Dock. Other sorting nexins have been shown to be associated with specific subsets of cell surface receptors (9Haft C.R. de la Luz Sierra M. Barr V.A. Haft D.H. Taylor S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7278-7287Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In untreated S2 cell extract (UT), DSH3PX1 immunoprecipitates with Dscam antiserum (Fig.4 A). Using RNAi to abrogate the expression of DSH3PX1 (DSH3PX1i) verifies that the protein with an apparent molecular mass of 63 is indeed DSH3PX1 (26Clemens J.C. Worby C.A. Simonson-Leff N. Muda M. Maehama T. Hemmings B.A. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6499-6503Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). Using double-stranded RNA to eliminate Dock expression (Docki) had no effect on the association between DSH3PX1 and Dscam (Fig.4 A). These results suggest that Dock is not a bridging molecule required for Dscam's association with DSH3PX1. Cell surface receptors are also commonly endocytosed in clathrin-coated vesicles and targeted for either degradation or recycling to the plasma membrane (23Brodin L. Low P. Shupliakov O. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 312-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 34Slepnev V.I. De Camilli P. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 1: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). The clathrin adaptor protein, AP-50, is a member of the AP-2 complex that recognizes proteins destined for internalization in clathrin-coated vesicles (35Zhang Y. Allison J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9273-9278Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). We therefore sought to determine if DSH3PX1 is in a complex with AP-50. Stably introducing a V5 epitope-tagged AP-50 construct into S2 cells, followed by immunoprecipitation with V5 antiserum, verifies the association of DSH3PX1 with AP-50 (Fig. 4 B). To date, we have been unable to demonstrate that Dscam will co-immunoprecipitate with antibodies directed against AP-50. This suggests that DSH3PX1 could play an important role in bridging cell surface receptors with proteins in clathrin-coated vesicles. We are interested in the mechanisms by which Dscam could transduce signals leading to cytoskeletal rearrangements necessary for axonal extension along a distinct trajectory. Since Dscam exists in a complex with DSH3PX1, we reasoned that studying the protein-protein interactions of DSH3PX1 would lend insight into the downstream effectors of Dscam's signal transduction. To identify proteins that interact with DSH3PX1, we conducted a yeast two-hybrid screen of a third instar Drosophila library using full-length DSH3PX1 as the bait. 12 of the 34 interacting clones represented DSH3PX1 itself. This interaction was not dependent upon its SH3 or PX domains, suggesting that DSH3PX1 contains a dimerization domain in its COOH terminus. Analysis of DSH3PX1 sequence using the Coils program indicates a high probability of the COOH-terminal 20 amino acids forming a coiled-coil structure that could promote dimerization or the formation of higher order multimers (31Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3441) Google Scholar). Other two-hybrid positives included Wasp, a known regulator of the actin cytoskeleton that is also involved in the process of endocytosis (36Qualmann B. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1047-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Our two-hybrid library plasmid for Wasp contained sequences coding for the COOH-terminal two-thirds of the protein, which includes the GBD/CRIB, proline-rich, verpolin homology, and cofilin homology domains. To obtain the full-length sequence for DrosophilaWasp, two additional expressed sequence tags, LP11964 and GH10436, were sequenced in their entirety. During the preparation of this manuscript, a sequence identical to ours for Drosophila Wasp was reported (37Ben-Yaacov S. Le Borgne R. Abramson I. Schweisguth F. Schejter E.D. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The protein is 527 amino acids in length and contains the same domain organization as its mammalian counterpart (Fig. 6), namely an amino-terminal pleckstrin homology domain that binds phospholipids, an IQ domain that mediates calcium binding, a CRIB domain that binds Rac and Cdc42, a proline-rich region, two verpolin homology domains, and a cofilin homology domain (14Zigmond S.H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: F117-F120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The proline-rich sequences of mammalian Wasp have been shown to bind a number of different SH3 domain-containing proteins including Nck (38Rivero-Lezcano O.M. Marcilla A. Sameshima J.H. Robbins K.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5725-5731Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Our two-hybrid results indicate that DSH3PX1 interacts with Wasp via its SH3 domain (Table I). To verify our two-hybrid result, we demonstrated that in S2 cells stably expressing Wasp engineered to contain a COOH-terminal V5-tag, DSH3PX1 co-immunoprecipitates with Wasp (Fig. 5,left panel). As expected, this co-immunoprecipitation is abolished in extracts prepared from cells exposed to double-stranded RNA for DSH3PX1 (DSH3PX1i). In cells that lack Dock (Docki), DSH3PX1 co-immunoprecipitates with Wasp as effectively as in untreated cells. Dock also immunoprecipitates the same amount of DSH3PX1 in the presence (UT) or absence of Wasp (Waspi) in these cell extracts (Fig. 5, right panel). Therefore, there is no competition for DSH3PX1 between these two binding partners, suggesting that Dock is interacting with DSH3PX1 via a phosphorylated tyrosine residue, while Wasp is interacting with DSH3PX1 via its SH3 domain. Anti-Tyr(P) Western analysis of Wasp immunoprecipitates indicates that DSH3PX1 is not tyrosine-phosphorylated when associated with Wasp (data not shown).Table IDSH3PX1 protein interaction"
https://openalex.org/W2021940291,"Tumor suppressor p53 has been shown to transactivate epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression through binding to a putative p53 responsive element in the EGFR promoter between nucleotides −265 and −239 (EGFRp53RE). Isotypes of p63 gene products, recently identified as p53 relatives, have a similar function to transactivate several p53 target gene promoters. However, our results indicate that TAp63γ has a very low ability to bind to the EGFRp53RE and surprisingly represses both basal EGFR promoter activity and endogenous EGFR expression. Transient transfection assays show that the EGFR promoter region between −348 and −293, containing two Sp1 sites, is crucial for the repression of the EGFR expression by TAp63γ. Mutations in these Sp1 sites in the reporter constructs result in loss of the TAp63γ repression effect. We further show that TAp63γ directly interacts with Sp1 by immunoprecipitation analysis and that TAp63γ impairs Sp1 binding to the target DNA site in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. These results suggest that TAp63γ is involved in the regulation of the EGFR gene expression through interactions with basal transcription factors.

Also, a variety of agents have been shown to increase EGFR gene expression (8Hou X. Johnson A.C. Rosner M.R. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 801-809PubMed Google Scholar, 9Hudson L.G. Thompson K.L.

Thus, transcriptional control plays a major role in regulation of EGFR gene expression. The promoter of the EGFR gene lacks a TATA box and CAAT box but contains multiple GC boxes and multiple transcription initiation sites. A number of regions in the promoter have been identified that bind nuclear factors (13Johnson A.C. Ishii S. Jinno Y. Pastan I. Merlino G.T. J. Biol.

Sp1, interferon-regulated factor-1, EGFR transcription factor, activator protein-1, and activator protein-2 have been shown to increase EGFR gene transcription (20Kageyama R. Merlino G.T. Pastan I.

Two groups have shown that p53 can transactivate EGFR via binding to an upstream site of the EGFR promoter between −265 and −239 base pairs (25Ludes-Meyers J.H. Subler M.A. Shivakumar C.V. Munoz R.M.

Nature. 1991; 351: 453-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (3658) Google Scholar). p53 appears to induce cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in response to cellular stresses such as DNA damage, mitotic spindle misassembly, and hypoxia. The actions are mediated through transcriptional regulation of p53 target genes (29El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W.

Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6740) Google Scholar). Most functions of p53 involve its activity as a transcription factor. p53 binds to its consensus binding sequence (two copies of the 10-base pair motif 5′-PuPuPuC(A/T)(T/A)GPyPyPy-3′ separated by 0–13 base pairs) and transactivates expression of target genes (31El-Deiry W.S. Kern S. Pietenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar). Several biologically significant genes were found to contain this consensus sequence and to be subjected to p53 regulation. Among those commonly studied are p21Waf1/Cip1 (29El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T.

The p53 mutations found in many human cancers are clustered in the DNA-binding domain of the p53 molecule (37Greenblatt M.S. Bennett W.P. Hollstein M. Harris C.C. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4855-4878PubMed Google Scholar). This leads to an inactivation of p53 function through abolition of p53-specific DNA binding and transactivation. By this means, p53 acts as a tumor suppressor; its loss of function appears to confer selective advantages to cells through deregulated growth and resistance to cell death (38Graeber T.G. Osmanian C.

One of these novel genes, termed p73, is mapped to chromosome 1p36.33 and encodes a protein with homology to p53 (40Kaghad M. Bonnet H. Yang A. Creancier L. Biscan J.C. Valent A. Minty A. Chalon P.

Jablonska S.J. Invest. Dermatol. 1999; 113: 146-151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Although the amino acid sequences and the molecular weights were reported to be different, they have proven to be isotypes derived from a single gene (43Yang A. Kaghad M. Wang Y. Gillett E. Fleming M.D. Dotsch V. Andrews N.C. Caput D. McKeon F. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 305-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1846) Google Scholar). Thus far, there have been six reported isotypes of p63. Three of the variants are called TA (transactivation) type and encode proteins with transactivation, DNA binding, and oligomerization domains similar to p53. The three remaining variants, which lack the acidic N-terminal domain, are called dN (δN terminus) type. Both types, TAp63 and dNp63, have different C termini that are described as α, β, and γ (43Yang A. Kaghad M. Wang Y. Gillett E. Fleming M.D. Dotsch V. Andrews N.C. Caput D. McKeon F. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 305-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1846) Google Scholar). Thus, the TA types are designated TAp63α, TAp63β, and TAp63γ and the dN types are designated dNp63α, dNp63β, and dNp63γ. TAp63γ has the shortest C terminus and the potential to induce apoptosis and growth suppression in a manner similar to p53. The mechanism is possibly through the p53 regulatory element and includes cellular responses similar to those induced by p53 (42Osada M. Ohba M. Kawahara C. Ishioka C. Kanamaru R. Katoh I. Ikawa Y. Nimura Y. Nakagawara A. Obinata M. Ikawa S. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 839-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 43Yang A. Kaghad M. Wang Y. Gillett E. Fleming M.D. Dotsch V. Andrews N.C. Caput D. McKeon F. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 305-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1846) Google Scholar). TAp63γ transactivates several previously identified p53 target gene promoters such as p21Waf1/Cip1, BAX, and MDM2 (42Osada M. Ohba M. Kawahara C. Ishioka C. Kanamaru R. Katoh I. Ikawa Y. Nimura Y.

Ishioka C. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2781-2786PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, TAp63 is considered to be a tumor suppressor gene and it may serve as an alternative tumor suppressor gene whose expression is induced by the loss of p53 function (42Osada M. Ohba M. Kawahara C. Ishioka C. Kanamaru R. Katoh I. Ikawa Y. Nimura Y. Nakagawara A. Obinata M. Ikawa S. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 839-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). On the other hand, variants that are truncated with the acidic N terminus (dN type) or encode the longest C terminus (α type) are thought to possess oncogenic properties (43Yang A. Kaghad M. Wang Y. Gillett E. Fleming M.D. Dotsch V. Andrews N.C. Caput D. McKeon F. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 305-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1846) Google Scholar). These variants also act in a dominant-negative manner toward both p53 and transactivating versions of p63 through the reporter construct containing multiple copies of p53-binding sequence termed PG13 (43Yang A. Kaghad M. Wang Y. Gillett E. Fleming M.D. Dotsch V. Andrews N.C. Caput D. McKeon F. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 305-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1846) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined potential TAp63-dependent transactivation of the EGFR promoter using transfection assays and also TAp63 binding to the EGFR promoter fragments by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Our results indicate a novel mechanism for regulation of EGFR gene expression through interaction of TAp63 with Sp1. The human non-small cell lung carcinoma cell line H1299, which is p53 deficient, was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. The human osteosarcoma cell line Saos-2, which is also p53 deficient, was maintained in McCoy’s 5A medium (Life Technologies) with 15% fetal bovine serum. Luciferase reporter constructs containing the EGFR promoter, pER1-luc, pER9-luc, pER9A-luc, pER9C-luc, and pER10-luc, were prepared by ligation of the HindIII promoter fragments from EGFR-CAT constructs into pGL3-Basic (Promega, Madison, WI) (21Rubinstein Y.R. Proctor K.N. Bergel M. Murphy B. Johnson A.C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 268-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The 3′ end of each of the following EGFR-luciferase constructs is at −16 relative to the EGFR translational start site, while the 5′ ends map to the following positions: pER1-luc (−1109), pER9-luc (−388), pER9A-luc (−348), pER9C-luc (−292), and pER10-luc (−150) (Fig. 5 A). PG13-luc, which contains 13 copies of the p53-binding site, was kindly provided by Dr. B. Vogelstein (29El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7936) Google Scholar). TK-luc was generated by subcloning of the EcoRI/HindIII thymidine kinase (TK) promoter fragments from pRL-TK construct (Promega) into pGL3-basic. TK-TATA-luc was prepared by removal of the EcoRI/BglII fragments from TK-luc and then blunted and ligated. SV40-luc, pGL3-promoter, was purchased from Promega. pNF-κB-luc and pCRE-luc were purchased fromCLONTECH (San Francisco, CA). The pERp53RE-luc was constructed by subcloning of four p53-binding site sequences from the EGFR promoter into the TK-TATA-luc construct using the XbaI site (Fig. 3). This site is located upstream of the TK promoter TATA region. The pER348–293-luc, pER348–293mt1-luc, pER348–293mt2-luc, or pER348–293mt1,2-luc has the EGFR promoter region between 348 and 293 with or without the Sp1 site mutation as an insert instead of p53 consensus sequences (Fig. 6). The pER1p53mt-luc, pER1Sp1mt1,2-luc, and pER1p53mtSp1mt1,2-luc constructs contain the same mutations as the pER348–293mt constructs but are in the full EGFR promoter context. The pCMV-p53 expression vector was purchased fromCLONTECH and the p53 cDNA was subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) with the EcoRI site to obtain pcDNA3-p53. TAp63γ cDNA was cloned from murine testis using PCR methods and subcloned into pcDNA3 vector.Figure 3Effect of TAp63γ expression on pERp53RE-luc reporter gene activity. In the upper panel, the sequence of the EGFR p53 response element and a schematic of pERp53RE-luc are shown. In the lower panel, H1299 cells were transfected with pERp53RE-luc (0.1 μg) and 1.0 μg of the p53, TAp63γ, or pcDNA3. Luciferase assays were performed after 24 h.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 6Mutation of Sp1 site abrogates transcriptional activity of pER348–293-luc.

For each transfection, 0.2–1.0 μg of empty vector and/or expression vector plus 0.1 μg of promoter-luciferase DNA were mixed in 3.0 ml of Opti-MEM (Life Technologies) and a precipitate was formed using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. The cells were washed with Opti-MEM and complexes were applied to the cells for 5 h. An equal volume of RPMI 1640 or McCoy’s 5A medium containing 20% (30% for McCoy’s 5A medium) fetal bovine serum was added, and cells were incubated for an additional 19 h. Cells were harvested and extracts were prepared with luciferase cell lysis buffer (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). Luciferase activity was assayed in extracts in triplicate using the luciferase assay kit (Pharmingen). H1299 cells were seeded at 2.5 × 106 cells/150-mm dish and incubated overnight at 37 °C and then transfected with 15 μg of either pcDNA3 empty vector or constructs expressing TAp63γ tagged at its N terminus with influenza hemagglutinin (HA) peptide by the LipofectAMINE method as described above. After 24 h, the media was changed to selective media containing 700 μg/ml Geneticin (Life Technologies) to reduce the number of untransfected cells. Cells were harvested 4 days post-transfection and lysed on ice for 30 min in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl at pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 400 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm sodium fluoride, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol), containing complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN). The lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min and the soluble fraction was collected. Protein concentrations were measured with a Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of protein extract (40 μg) were loaded onto a 4–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and subjected to electrophoresis at 200 V for 50 min. The proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and probed with anti-EGFR antibodies (1005) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-HA antibody (F-7) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-actin antibody (C4) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The blot was probed with each antibody after stripping the membrane of the previous probe. EGFR was detected by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody coupled with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The intensity of each EGFR band was normalized based on the intensity of the actin band. H1299 cells were seeded at 2.5 × 106 cells/150-mm dish and incubated overnight at 37 °C and then transfected with 15 μg of either pcDNA3 empty vector or constructs expressing TAp63γ by the LipofectAMINE method as described above. After 24 h, the media was changed to selective media containing 700 μg/ml Geneticin (Life Technologies) to reduce the number of untransfected cells. Cells were harvested 4 days post-transfection, and total cellular RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies) and quantified by A260/A280 measurement using an Ultraspec 3000 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Total RNA samples (20 μg) were subjected to Northern blot analysis. After electrophoresis in MOPS electrophoresis buffer, the RNA was transferred to a nylon membrane in 10 × SSC buffer by capillary action. The RNA was fixed to the nylon membrane by ultraviolet light exposure with a UV Stratalinker (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The membrane was hybridized with random-primed 32P-labeled probes in ExpressHyb hybridization solution (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer’s recommendation. After hybridization at 68 °C, the membrane was washed twice in 2 × SSC containing 0.05% SDS at room temperature and then washed twice at 50 °C using 0.1 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS. The filters were autoradiographed with Kodak X-AR film for 24–72 h at −80 °C. The signal obtained from the Northern blots was normalized to the signal for β-actin. The p53 and TAp63 cDNAs were subcloned into pcDNA3 and tagged at their N termini with HA peptide. To generate C-terminal truncated proteins, polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify the regions encoding HA and amino acids 1–363 for p53. This region was also subcloned into pcDNA3 and checked for fidelity of DNA sequence. Protein was synthesized in vitro in the presence of unlabeled amino acids with the coupled transcription/translation system (TNT) from Promega. Translated products were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-HA antibody (F-7) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For immunoprecipitation,35S-labeled p53 and TAp63γ were synthesized in the presence of 40 μCi of 35S-labeled methionine and other unlabeled amino acids with TNT system. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed as described previously (26Sheikh M.S. Carrier F. Johnson A.C. Ogdon S.E. Fornace A.J. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1095-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, a double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the p53 consensus DNA-binding site (PG) was prepared by annealing two complementary oligonucleotides, 5′-AGCTTAGACATGCCTAGACATGCCTA-3′ and 5′-TAGGCATGTCTAGGCATGTCTAAGCT-3′, in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA. Equimolar amounts of the complementary oligonucleotides were mixed in a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube and placed in a heat block at 95 °C. The heat block was allowed to cool to room temperature, and the sample was desalted on a G-25 microspin column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The double-stranded oligonucleotide was end-labeled with 32P using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. For electrophoretic mobility shift analysis, the end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide 5000 cpm was incubated with 2 μl of p53 and TAp63γ at room temperature (22 °C) for 30 min in the presence of a binding buffer (10% glycerol, 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 25 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.4% Nonidet P-40, and 1 μg of salmon sperm DNA). When competition assays were performed, an unlabeled p53 consensus sequence oligonucleotide from p21Waf1/Cip1 or the EGFR promoter was incubated with protein and buffer for 5 min prior to the addition of the labeled oligonucleotide. Each binding site oligonucleotide was purchased as two single-stranded DNAs from Genosys Biotechnologies (Woodlands, TX) and annealed as described above. Samples (20 μl) were loaded onto a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel and subjected to electrophoresis at 150 V for 1 h using 0.33 × TBE (1 × TBE: 89 mm Tris-HCl, 8 mm boric acid, and 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.3) as running buffer. For Sp1 binding, the Sp1 consensus oligonucleotide (Promega) was labeled with 32P as described above. The end-labeled Sp1 consensus oligonucleotide and 5 μg of HeLa nuclear extract (Promega) were incubated w"

A novel molecule, POEM (preosteoblast epidermal growth factor-like repeat protein with meprin, A5 protein, and receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase μ domain), was isolated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using a set of degenerate primers designed after other known epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like motifs. From its structure, POEM was suggested to be a novel adhesion molecule with five EGF-like domains, an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) cell binding motif, and a meprin, A5 protein, and receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase μ (MAM) domain. By in situhybridization using embryonic day 16.5 (E16.5) mouse embryos, strong expression of POEM mRNA was observed in developing kidney renal tubules, parathyroid and thyroid glands, developing bone, tooth germ, and endocrine organs of the brain. The inner ear, skeletal muscle, smooth muscle (except for the vascular system), and skin were also positive for POEM expression. Bacterial recombinant POEM protein containing the RGD sequence and MAM domain showed strong cell adhesion, spreading, and survival-promoting activities. By mutating the RGD sequence to RGE, the cell spreading and survival activities were significantly decreased, but the MAM domain was shown to contribute only to cell adhesion and not to cell spreading and survival-promoting activities. The distribution of POEM in several tissues was close to that of α8β1integrin. Therefore, we conducted cell adhesion assays using KA8 cells, a K562 leukemia clone stably expressing α8integrin. Parental K562 cells, which expressed α5β1 integrin, bound to fibronectin but not to POEM. On the other hand, KA8 cells showed strong binding and spreading on both fibronectin and POEM. These results suggest that POEM is a novel ligand for α8β1integrin and that POEM may be involved in the development and function of various tissues, such as kidney, bone, muscles, and endocrine organs.

Notch and Delta are cell surface molecules that act as a receptor and ligand, respectively, and interact via their EGF-like domains to determine cell fates (4Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Rand M.D. Lake R.J.

Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2000; 11: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) are generated by cleavage of transmembrane precursors and act through the EGF receptor. Recently, small matrix proteins with several EGF-like repeat structures have been reported. For example, Pref-1 is produced as a membrane protein and controls adipocytic cell differentiation (7Smas C.M. Sul H.S. Cell. 1993; 73: 725-734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Del-1 is an adhesion molecule with an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence and induces angiogenesis (8Penta K. Varner J.A.

The ECM presents much information to the cells by working as a multifunctional ligand for cell adhesion receptors (10Adams J.C. Watt F.M. Giger R.J. Urquhart E.R. Gillespie S.K. Levengood D.V.

Integrins are a large family of heterodimeric cell surface proteins that serve as receptors for various ECM proteins (12Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Engel J.

Integrins are involved in tissue repair, development, and immune responses. Integrins also serve important functions in bone development and remodeling. Recently, it was reported that β1 integrin was significantly involved in osteoblastic function (15Zimmerman D. Jin F. Leboy P. Hardy S. Damsky C. Dev. Biol. 2000; 220: 2-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Expression of dominant negative β1 subunit in osteoblasts significantly reduced the bone-forming activity of osteoblasts. Matrix proteins produced by osteoblastic cells are the major target molecules not only for osteoblasts themselves but also for osteoclastic cells. Therefore, identification of a novel adhesion molecule produced by osteoblastic cells provides a new insight into the biology and development of bone tissue. In this study, we screened a cDNA library derived from preosteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells and isolated a cDNA clone coding for a novel adhesion protein, POEM. A cell population enriched in osteoblasts was prepared from the calvaria of a 4-week-old C57BL/6 mouse as described previously (16Tezuka K. Takeshita S. Hakeda Y. Kumegawa M. Kikuno R. Hashimoto-Gotoh T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 173: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). MC3T3-E1, a mouse calvaria-derived osteoblast-like cell line, was maintained in α-modified essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). KA8 cells, which express the chicken integrin α8 subunit (17Muller U. Bossy B. Venstrom K. Reichardt L.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 433-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and control K562 cells were kindly provided by Dr. Louis F. Reichardt (University of California, San Francisco, CA). KA8 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 400 μg/ml G418 (Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp., San Diego, CA), and K562 cells were cultured in the same medium but without the G418. Each medium was supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and antibiotic antimycotic solution (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. A pair of degenerate primers used for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification was designed based on the conserved amino acid sequences found in EGF-repeat structures (18Kuriyama S. Miyatani S. Kinoshita T. Mech. Dev. 2000; 93: 233-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Complementary DNA was synthesized from the mRNA of MC3T3-E1 cells and amplified by use of a reverse transcription-PCR kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The PCR program consisted of 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1.5 min, 48 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 2 min. The amplified PCR products were subcloned into pBluescript plasmid (Stratagene) and subjected to sequencing by the dideoxy-chain termination method with an automatic DNA sequencer (Model 373; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). A cDNA library was constructed from the mRNA of MC3T3-E1 cells cultured for 6 days by using a UniZAP cDNA library construction kit (Stratagene). A 270-base pair cDNA fragment of a gene that was not represented in the GenBankTM data base was obtained and used to screen a MC3T3-E1 (cultured for 6 days) cDNA phage library constructed in UniZAP (Stratagene). The single positive plaque was subjected to in vivo excision of the pBluescript SK(−) phagemid as described by the manufacturer. A homology search was performed with BLAST and FASTA against public sequence data bases, and a motif search was performed on-line with PROSITE. The nucleotide sequence data reported in this study will appear in the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBankTM nucleotide sequence data base with the accession number AB059656. Total RNA was prepared from brain, kidney, liver, spleen, testis, and thymus of 4-week-old mice. In addition, 14.5, 16.5, and 18.5 days post coitus whole embryos and newborn mice were also used for RNA preparation. The total RNA was prepared by the acid guanidinium thiocyanate-CsCl method (19Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Chanda V.B. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995: 4.2.1-4.2.9Google Scholar) or with ISOGEN (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan). Polyadenylated RNA samples were extracted from cells by using a Quick Prep Micro mRNA Purification Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The RNA samples were electrophoresed in 1.2% agarose gel and then transferred to nylon membranes (Hybond-N+; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The blots were hybridized with radiolabeled probes and washed twice in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature followed by 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 55 °C. The equivalent loading of the RNA samples was confirmed by probing with a human β-actin probe. Both sense and antisense probes were labeled by transcription from full-length mouse POEM cDNA with a digoxigenin RNA labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The labeled probes were alkaline-hydrolyzed and then purified. Kidney, liver, and spleen were collected from 22-day-old mice, and spleen was collected from adult mice. These specimens and 16.5-day-old embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, embedded in Tissue-Tec OCT (Miles, Inc., Elkhart, IN), frozen in a liquid nitrogen, and cryosectioned at 8-μm thickness. Three serial sections were made (two for hybridization with sense or antisense probe and one for staining with hematoxylin and eosin). In situ hybridization with digoxigenin-labeled sense and antisense RNA probes was performed as described previously with a slight modification. In brief, sections were permeabilized with proteinase K (3 μg/ml) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 30 min at 37 °C and hybridized with probes (0.3 μg/ml) overnight at 45 °C. The sections were then blocked with 1% blocking buffer, incubated with a 1:750 dilution of anti-digoxigenin antibody for 1.5 h at room temperature, and developed for 6 h at room temperature in coloring solution (nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate) containing levamisol (10 μg/ml). A cDNA fragment (nucleotide positions 144–1931 as shown in Fig. 1) encoding amino acid residues from 1–561 of POEM was amplified by PCR amplification using primers 5′-CCCAAGCTTTGTGCGTCCCAGCAGCCGCGG-3′ (forward direction) and 5′-GAAGATCTGCAGCGACCTCTTTT-3′ (reverse direction). Another cDNA fragment corresponding to nucleotide positions 144–1511 (amino acids 1–421; POEMΔMAM) of POEM was also amplified using the same forward primer and reverse primer 5′-GAAGATCTGCTGTGTATGAGAATACCTG-3′. PCR products were digested with HindIII and BglII and used to replace the osteopontin signal sequence and mouse CTLA4 cDNA of expression vector pcDNA3-OSM-mCTLA4-Ig (kindly provided by Dr. R. Abe; Science University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan) to generate expression vectors for fusion proteins of POEM and human immunoglobulin G (IgG) constant region. A single amino acid substitution (RGD→RGE) was introduced into POEM cDNA by PCR using a primer containing a single nucleotide mutation. The sequence of the primer was 5′-CGCGGATCCTCAGAAACCCAGAGGAGAAGTG-3′. As a negative control, pcDNA3 mock vector was used. COS-7 and MC3T3-E1 cells were transfected with the expression vectors by using TransIT-LT1 (Mirus, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Two days later, conditioned medium of these cells was concentrated with Protein G Fast Flow (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In the COS-7 cells, the cells were harvested with 1 mm EDTA in PBS, and cell samples were suspended at a concentration of 2 × 105 cells/20 μl Laemmli reducing SDS loading buffer. ECM samples were stripped from the cell culture dish with a small volume of Laemmli buffer after the cells were removed. The MC3T3-E1 samples containing the cells and ECM proteins were harvested with Laemmli reducing SDS loading buffer. These samples were separated by 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were blotted onto Immobilon-P (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and blocked with 3% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline for 2 h. Proteins were directly detected with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human IgG antibody (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Birmingham, AL). The membrane was exposed to x-ray film with chemiluminescence enhancement (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). COS-7 cells (5 × 105 cells) were transfected with POEM-Fc vector or other POEM mutant-Fc vectors by using TransIT-LT1. Two days later, the cells were washed with PBS and harvested with 0.2% EDTA in PBS. The cells (1 × 106cells) were washed with FACS buffer (PBS containing 2% fetal calf serum and 0.02% NaN3) and incubated with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-human IgG antibody at a dilution of 1:100 for 30 min on ice. After cells were washed twice with FACS buffer, they were analyzed with a flow cytometer (FACSort; Becton Dickinson). The BamHI-HindIII fragment of POEM cDNA (nucleotide positions 1376–2887) encoding the C terminus portion of POEM protein (amino acids 377–561; POEMc) was cloned into the pMAL-c2 bacterial expression vector (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) to generate an expression vector for maltose-binding protein (MBP)-POEMc fusion protein pMAL-c2-POEMc. MBP- MBP-POEMc(RGE) (POEMc with a single amino acid substitution at amino acid position 384 converting the RGD sequence to RGE) was constructed by replacing the BamHI-KpnI fragment of pMAL-c2-POEMc vector with the BamHI-KpnI fragment of POEM (RGE)-Fc vector. Recombinant MBP-POEMc, MBP-POEMc(RGE), and MBP proteins were produced by Escherichia coli strain XL1-Blue transformed with pMAL-c2-POEMc, pMAL-c2-POEMc(RGE), or pMAL-c2, respectively. The recombinant proteins were purified by amylose resin column chromatography and analyzed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The protein concentration was determined with a Coomassie Plus Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Non-tissue culture 96-well plates were coated with 1–5 μg of recombinant MBP-POEMc, MBP-POEMc(RGE), or MBP proteins diluted with PBS and incubated for 24 h at 4 °C. Bovine fibronectin (Sigma) was used as a positive control, and MBP and bovine serum albumin were used as negative controls. Coated wells were washed with PBS and blocked for 1 h at 37 °C with a solution of 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in PBS. Subconfluent MC3T3-E1 cells were harvested by trypsin-EDTA, suspended in serum-free medium (3 × 104 cells/100 μl), and placed in the wells. After incubation for 90 min at 37 °C, the wells were washed several times with serum-free medium until almost all of the cells had been washed out of the negative control wells. Attached cells were fixed and stained with 0.1 ng/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in methanol, and the cell number was counted as the number of fluorescent nuclei seen under a fluorescence microscope. Experiments were performed in duplicate. For the cell adhesion assay using K562 and KA8 cells, glass-bottomed dishes (Mastunami, Osaka, Japan) were coated with recombinant proteins, bovine fibronectin, or MBP at a concentration of 5 μg/ml at 4 °C overnight and then blocked as described above. These cells were then plated at a concentration of 3 × 104 cells/well, incubated for 20 min at 37 °C, and observed under a phase-contrast microscope. A 505-base pair fragment of mouse integrin α8 sequence corresponding to 2507–3011 of GenBankTM accession number AF041409 was amplified using the following primers: 5′-GCTGCCTCCCCAGAGGATACC-3′ (forward direction) and 5′-GTCAGTTGTTCCCTGTCTGTCAT-3′ (reverse direction). The reverse transcription-PCR amplification was conducted as described above using cDNA of MC3T3-E1 cells as a template. The PCR program consisted of 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 3 min. The amplified PCR products were electrophoresed on a 2% agarose gel and visualized with ethidium bromide staining. MC3T3-E1 is a cell line with preosteoblastic phenotypes. We generated a pair of degenerate PCR primers based on the EGF-like repeat structures found in various ECM and receptor proteins (18Kuriyama S. Miyatani S. Kinoshita T. Mech. Dev. 2000; 93: 233-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Using a single-strand cDNA of MC3T3-E1 (cultured for 3 days) as a template, we obtained a clone, OB-9, whose sequence was not found in the GenBankTM data base. By screening a MC3T3-E1 cDNA library with OB-9 partial cDNA as a probe, we isolated four independent and overlapping clones. By restriction enzyme mapping and DNA sequencing, we isolated a full-length 3.6-kilobase cDNA with an open reading frame of 561 amino acid residues (Fig. 1 A). The translation initiation site, Met, was assigned at nucleotide positions 249–251 according to the Kozak consensus sequence (21Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2802) Google Scholar). The deduced amino acid sequence of this protein had an N-terminal hydrophobic domain, which was presumed to be a signal sequence (22Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4923) Google Scholar), but no other hydrophobic regions that could serve as transmembrane domains were found, suggesting that OB-9 is a secreted protein. Additionally, five EGF-like repeat domains, a proline-rich domain, one putative Asn glycosylation site, an RGD cell adhesion sequence motif, and a MAM domain were found. Therefore, we named this potential protein POEM (preosteoblast EGF-like repeat protein with MAM domain). The alignment of the five EGF-like repeats and MAM domain of POEM showed significant similarity with other known proteins, as shown in Fig. 1, B and C. The EGF-like repeats were located at the N terminus in tandem following the signal sequence. The MAM domain was about 160 amino acids long and had four conserved cysteines and hydrophobic and aromatic amino acids matching the consensus sequence of MAM domains found in other proteins. The overall POEM sequence showed significant similarity to mouse MAEG (GenBankTM accession number AJ245672) or its human counterpart, EGFL6 (GenBankTM accession number AF186084), which contains a predicted signal sequence, an array of five EGF-like repeats, an RGD motif, and a MAM domain (Fig. 2). However, homology was about 39% at the amino acid sequence level, and MAEG/EGFL6 did not contain the proline-rich domain found in POEM. Recently, we found a putative human counterpart of POEM (hCG20771, hCP38387) in the Celera data base (23Venter J.C. Adams M.D. Myers E.W. Li P.W. Mural R.J. Sutton G.G. Smith H.O. Yandell M.

Yan C. et al.Science. 2001; 291: 1304-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (10497) Google Scholar) that shows ∼80% homology at the amino acid level with the corresponding region of mouse POEM. From these facts, we concluded that POEM and MAEG/EGFL6 are distinct molecules belonging to same family. In long-term cultures, MC3T3-E1 cells spontaneously differentiate into cells with mature osteoblastic phenotype. To gain further insight into POEM function, we used Northern blotting to examine the expression of POEM mRNA in MC3T3-E1 cells, mouse tissues, and mouse whole embryo. Approximately 4-kilobase POEM mRNA was highly expressed at the proliferation stage of MC3T3-E1 cells (Fig. 3 A). Subsequently, the expression decreased as the differentiation proceeded. Expression of POEM was also detected in primary calvarial osteoblastic cells and kidneys of 4-week-old mice by Northern blotting (data not shown). In mouse development, expression of POEM mRNA could be detected as early as day 11.5 of gestation (data not shown) and subsequently increased (Fig. 3 B), suggesting that POEM is involved in embryonic development as well as in the postnatal function of bone and kidney. To investigate the expression of POEM in developing tissues, we performed in situ hybridization using frozen sections of 16.5-day-old embryos. In the kidneys, abundant expression of POEM mRNA was observed in most of the epithelium of the ureter branches, the epithelium of collecting tubules, and the podocytes surrounding glomeruli (Fig. 4, A and B). Weak or less intense expression was also observed in both the comma-shaped bodies and the S-shaped bodies toward the peripheral region of the kidney. Hybridization of tissue sections with the sense probe of POEM showed no positive reaction (Fig. 4 A). In 22-day-old mice, POEM expression was also observed in many tubules of the kidney (data not shown). In the parathyroid gland, remarkable expression of POEM mRNA was observed in the developing parenchymal cells of cell cords (Fig. 4,C−E). However, in the capsule, no expression was detected (Fig. 4, C and D). Thyroid tissue of 16.5-day-old embryos showed disordered cords of cells without obvious organization into follicles or the presence of colloid. However, some follicular structures were becoming clearly defined at the same time (Fig. 4 E). The relatively high level of POEM mRNA was restricted to the developing follicular epithelial cells and potential parafollicular cells of the thyroid gland (Fig. 4,C and D). A significant level of POEM mRNA was also detected in the tooth germs (Fig. 4, F−H). POEM mRNA expression was detected in the outer enamel epithelium. Higher expression was frequently observed in the outer part on the frontal side of the outer enamel epithelium and its stalk region. The entire region of the dental papilla was negative. POEM expression was also observed in some of the inner enamel epithelium and in the stellate reticulum. In the intramembranous ossification sites, such as the ramus of the mandible (Fig. 4, I−K), the membranous primordium of the frontal bone, and calvaria, osteoblasts were identified adjacent to the mineralized tissues as cuboidal cells. Weak expression of POEM mRNA was detected in these mature osteoblasts lining the bone matrix, however, more intensive expression was observed in the condensed mesenchymal cells, surrounding developing bones in both the ramus of the mandible (Fig. 4, I and J) and the calvaria (data not shown). In the case of the intracartilaginous ossification site in vertebral bones, weak expression of POEM mRNA was detected both in cuboidal osteoblasts on the trabecular bone surface and in cells surrounding the bony collar showing the early stage of osteogenesis (Fig. 5,A−C). POEM mRNA was also detected in the cells covering the outer side of the Eustachian tube and tubo-tympanic recess (Fig. 5, D−F). In the cochlea, two types of cells were recognized: support cells and sensory epithelium (hair cells; Fig. 5 I). POEM mRNA was localized apically in some of the developing hair cells next to the cluster of mature hair cells as seen in a sagittal in the plane (Fig. 5, G and H). POEM was widely expressed in the skeletal muscles (Fig. 5,J−O). Generally, the expression was relatively high around the nucleus in the skeletal muscles and near the tendon. POEM expression was not detected in the tendon. In the lingua (Fig. 5,M−O), POEM was detected not only in the lingual muscle but also in the mucosal epithelium (Fig. 5, M and N). In the lingual muscle, POEM expression was also high around the nucleus, especially in the region just under the lingual aponeurosis and near the lingual septum, where the muscle made contact. In the mucosal epithelium, a relatively low level of POEM was expressed and restricted to the upper surface of the lingua. POEM expression could not be observed in the lingual aponeurosis or lingual aorta. POEM expression was detected in the smooth muscle as well as in the skeletal muscle. In the digestive tract, POEM was expressed in the muscle layer of both the esophagus (data not shown) and stomach (Fig. 5, P−R). In the esophagus, expression was observed in both the inner and outer muscle layers. On the other hand, abundant expression was localized restrictedly in the inner muscle layer of the stomach (Fig. 5, P and Q). Through the remaining part, i.e. from the duodenum to the rectum, expression was barely detected, even in the muscle layer. The smooth muscle layer under the skin (Fig. 6,J−L) and the trachea (Fig. 6, P−R) were also positive for POEM mRNA. Vascular smooth muscle of arteries and veins showed no expression of POEM mRNA. The expression was not detected in the endothelial cells of blood vessels either. In the brain, expression of POEM was detected in the pineal body (Fig. 6, A−C), choroid plexus, hypophysis (Fig. 6,D−F), diencephalon (Fig. 6, G−I), midbrain, pons, and medulla oblongata. Obvious POEM expression was localized in the cells of the pineal body (Fig. 6, A and B) and dorsal region of the choroid plexus within the pineal recess of the third ventricle. In addition to this, relatively weak expression was observed in the other regions of the choroid plexus. In the hypophysis (Fig. 6, D−F), POEM-positive nerve fibers were localized in the entire region of the neurohypophysis. POEM expression was also observed in the cells in the adenohypophysis and in a part of the pars intermedia, and the expression level was relatively high in the cells n"

Two models, with 13–17 transmembrane segments, have been proposed for SURx topologies. Recently, we demonstrated that the amino-terminal region of SUR1 contains 5 transmembrane segments, supporting the 17-transmembrane model. To investigate the topology of the complete full-length SUR1, two strategies were employed. Topology was probed by accessibility of introduced cysteines to a membrane-impermeable biotinylating reagent, biotin maleimide. Amino acid positions 6/26, 99, 159, 337, 567, 1051, and 1274 were accessible, therefore extracellular, whereas many endogenous and some introduced cysteines were inaccessible, thus likely cytoplasmic or intramembrane. These sites correspond to extracellular loops 1–3, 5–6, and 8 and the NH2 terminus, and intracellular loops 3–8 and COOH terminus in the 17-transmembrane model. Immunofluorescence was used to determine accessibility of epitope-tagged SUR1 in intact and permeabilized cells. Epitopes at positions 337 and 1050 (putative external loops 3 and 6) were labeled in intact cells, therefore external, whereas positions 485 and 1119 (putative internal loops 5 and 7) only were accessible after permeabilization and therefore internal. These results are compatible with the 17-transmembrane model with two pairs of transmembrane segments as possible reentrant loops.

SURx, members of the ATP binding cassette (ABC) family of proteins, associate with inward rectifier Kir6.x in a heterooctameric 4:4 stoichiometry to form ATP-sensitive (KATP) channels (for review, see Refs. 1Aguilar-Bryan L.

SURx subunits physically associate with pore forming subunits (Kir6.x) and regulate the flow of potassium ions through the channel. Together, SURx and Kir6.x coordinate ATP and ADP binding with channel opening and closing. Different isoforms of SURx and Kir6.x contribute to distinct nucleotide binding affinities and orchestrate tissue specific electrical responses to metabolism. The role of the channel is perhaps best understood in pancreatic β cells, where SUR1 and Kir6.2 form the KATP channel that is the key mediator of insulin secretion. Increases in blood glucose cause closure of pancreatic KATPchannels, triggered by an increase in the cellular ATP to ADP ratio. This results in membrane depolarization, Ca2+ influx, and insulin release (1Aguilar-Bryan L. Clement J.P., IV Gonzalez G. Kunjilwar K. Babenko A. Bryan J. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 227-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 2Ashcroft S.J. J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 176: 187-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 3Fujita A. Kurachi Y. Pharmacol. Ther. 2000; 85: 39-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In vascular smooth muscle, the KATPchannel (SUR2B/Kir6.x) is important in the regulation of blood pressure, and in cardiac muscle cells, the channel (SUR2A/Kir6.2) is involved in the response to ischemia. Sulfonylurea drugs and potassium channel openers bind to SURx directly and have been used extensively to regulate KATP channel activity. Accordingly, SURx subunits are drug targets for the treatment of type II diabetes, persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy, as well as hypertension (1Aguilar-Bryan L. Clement J.P., IV Gonzalez G. Kunjilwar K. Babenko A. Bryan J. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 227-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 2Ashcroft S.J. J. Membr.

Elucidating the structure of the SURx family is vital to understanding their functions and is a valuable tool to further drug design.SURs are multi-spanning integral membrane proteins with predicted molecular masses of ∼170 kDa. SUR1 and SUR2A/B are highly homologous with similar hydrophobicity profiles and amino acid sequences (69% identical, 76% similar). Hydrophobicity analysis reveals three hydrophobic domains (TM0, TM1, and TM2), with hydrophilic nucleotide binding folds (NBF1 and NBF2) following TM1 and TM2 (4Tusnády G.E. Bakos E. Váradi A. Sarkadi B. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The polypeptide within each hydrophobic domain has been hypothesized to cross the plasma membrane between four and six times. Although the transmembrane topology of the TM0 domain has been explored (5Raab-Graham K.F. Cirilo L.J. Boettcher A.A. Radeke C.M. Vandenberg C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29122-29129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), the TM1 and TM2 domains remain undefined. The topology of the SURs has been debated, and considerably different models have been proposed, ranging from 13 transmembrane segments (in a 4+5+4 arrangement in TM0, TM1, and TM2) to 17 transmembrane segments (in a 5+6+6 arrangement) (1Aguilar-Bryan L. Clement J.P., IV Gonzalez G. Kunjilwar K. Babenko A. Bryan J. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 227-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 4Tusnády G.E. Bakos E. Váradi A. Sarkadi B.

Herrera-Sosa H. Nguy K. Bryan J. Nelson D.A. Science. 1995; 268: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar).Sequence homology of the SURs to other ABC family members is limited to the two nucleotide binding folds (NBF1 and NBF2). However, hydrophobicity analysis suggests that ABC proteins may have topological similarities and form topologically distinct subfamilies. Comparing the structure of the SURs to other ABC family members is intriguing since the ABC family contains proteins that differ greatly in their function: channels, transporters, and channel regulators, with the SUR members being rare examples of channel regulators. The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a chloride channel involved in cystic fibrosis, and P-glycoprotein (P-gp), a transporter responsible for anticancer drug resistance have been proposed to typify the ABC proteins, with TM1 and TM2 domains each followed by a nucleotide binding fold, NBF1 and NBF2 (4Tusnády G.E. Bakos E. Váradi A. Sarkadi B. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Topological characterizations of CFTR and P-gp are compatible with a structural model that contains 12 transmembrane segments in a 6+6 arrangement of TM1 and TM2 (7Chang X.-B. Hou Y.-X. Jensen T.J. Riordan J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18572-18575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Kast C. Canfield V. Levenson R. Gros P.

Chem. 1996; 271: 9240-9248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In contrast, the SURs, as well as multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP), are members of a small subgroup of ABC proteins that are distinguished by the presence of three TM domains. Little is known of the structure of this subgroup, but partial characterization of MRP topology has been interpreted in the context of a 17-transmembrane segment model (11Kast C. Gros P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26479-26487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 12Kast C. Gros P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2305-2313Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Attention to the similarities and differences in ABC protein structures may reveal information on the relatedness of proteins and the identification of functional domains.There have been few structural studies of SURx. Glycosylation studies of SUR1 have indicated two N-linked glycosylation sites at Asn-10 (near the NH2 terminus in the TM0 domain) and Asn-1050 (in the TM2 domain), demonstrating these sites to be extracellular (5Raab-Graham K.F. Cirilo L.J. Boettcher A.A. Radeke C.M. Vandenberg C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29122-29129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 6Aguilar-Bryan L. Nichols C.G.

Additionally, we have shown previously, using anin vitro protease protection assay with SUR1-prolactin fusion proteins, that the TM0 domain consists of five transmembrane regions (5Raab-Graham K.F. Cirilo L.J. Boettcher A.A. Radeke C.M. Vandenberg C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29122-29129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These data are consistent with the 17-transmembrane (5+6+6) model.Experiments here describe a comprehensive dual strategy using a biotinylation assay in conjunction with immunofluorescence to elucidate the topology of full-length SUR1 expressed on the plasma membrane of cultured cells. An impermeant biotinylation reagent was used in a surface labeling assay to identify the external loops of SUR1. A SUR1 construct was created that lacks external cysteines, and then individual cysteine residues were introduced and assayed for accessibility to reagent. Additionally, epitope tags were inserted into postulated internal or external regions of SUR1 and were assayed for immunofluorescence of permeabilized and nonpermeabilized cells to evaluate the internal or external location of the epitope tags. Together, these data indicate that SUR1 spans the membrane 17 times with two of these pairs of transmembrane segments as reentrant loops.DISCUSSIONHydrophobicity analysis has led to many possible topology profiles for SUR1 (4Tusnády G.E. Bakos E. Váradi A. Sarkadi B. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 5Raab-Graham K.F. Cirilo L.J. Boettcher A.A. Radeke C.M. Vandenberg C.A. J. Biol.

Herrera-Sosa H. Nguy K. Bryan J. Nelson D.A. Science. 1995; 268: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar). SUR1 topology has been predicted with the use of sophisticated algorithms that consider amino acid hydrophobicity, charge, polarity, and distributions. However, each prediction program yielded a different model of SUR1 topology, and the location and number of transmembrane segments varied considerably from 13 to 18 (4–6). Although hydropathy profiles are important and can offer insights, in the case of SUR1, experimental data are necessary to define the topology. Our previous study of SUR1 topology provided evidence to favor a 17-transmembrane-spanning model. That investigation targeted the amino-terminal region of the protein and showed that the amino-terminal TM0 domain contained five transmembrane segments (5Raab-Graham K.F. Cirilo L.J. Boettcher A.A. Radeke C.M. Vandenberg C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29122-29129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The data presented here provide an extensive investigation of SUR1 topology. Using a surface labeling biotinylation assay in conjunction with epitope insertion, we mapped the topology of SUR1 in the context of the intact protein. We provide direct evidence to support the 17-membrane-spanning model and suggest that two pairs of these transmembrane segments may form reentrant loops (Fig.7).Seventeen-transmembrane Segment Model of SUR1 TopologySurface biotinylation has been used successfully to probe the topology of many transmembrane proteins (9Loo T.W.

Although the number of endogenous cysteines made the assay impractical for directly examining internal regions, cysteine accessibility provided stringent boundaries for defining the position of external loops. Endogenous or introduced cysteines inserted into NEC (lacking cysteines 6, 26, 170, 1051, and 1057) were labeled with the cysteine modifying biotinylating reagent, biotin maleimide, and evaluated for external labeling. Our previous topology study of SUR1, limited to the TM0 domain, provided a good starting point for investigation (5Raab-Graham K.F. Cirilo L.J. Boettcher A.A. Radeke C.M. Vandenberg C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29122-29129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Identification of endogenous external cysteines revealed positions Cys-6, Cys-26, and Cys-1051 to be external (Fig. 3). These data are in agreement with glycosylation and protease protection studies (5Raab-Graham K.F. Cirilo L.J. Boettcher A.A. Radeke C.M. Vandenberg C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29122-29129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 6Aguilar-Bryan L. Nichols C.G. Wechsler S.W. Clement J.P., IV Boyd III, A.E. González G. Herrera-Sosa H. Nguy K. Bryan J. Nelson D.A. Science. 1995; 268: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar). Examination of cysteines introduced into the NEC background further showed that positions Thr-99 and Asp-159 are external, in concurrence with results from protease protection assays (5Raab-Graham K.F. Cirilo L.J. Boettcher A.A. Radeke C.M. Vandenberg C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29122-29129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In addition, cysteine scanning revealed that sites Lys-337, Lys-567, and Arg-1274 also are external (Fig. 4). These positions, corresponding to the NH2 terminus and external loops 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 8, support a 17-transmembrane topology (Fig. 7).Direct analysis of the location of internal regions of SUR1 using the biotinylation assay is limited due to the large number of internal cysteine residues. Interpretation, however, can be made from the absence of cysteine labeling. Twenty-six of 30 endogenous cysteines did not label, suggesting their location to be intramembrane or cytoplasmic (Fig. 3). Additionally, introduction of Cys-1186 in putative internal loop 8, did not label, indicating this region to be internal (Fig. 4). The absence of biotinylation of cysteine residues in all of the hydrophilic internal loops 3–9 provides strong, although indirect, evidence of their cytoplasmic localization.Insertion of epitope tags into integral membrane proteins has been used frequently to determine topology (8Kast C. Canfield V. Levenson R. Gros P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4402-4411Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 10Kast C. Canfield V. Levenson R. Gros P. J. Biol.

Flag tags were inserted into SUR1AAA at several positions. Flags inserted at external loops 3 (position 337) and 6 (position 1050) were confirmed to be external with antibody labeling of nonpermeabilized cells (Fig. 5). These data complement the biotinylation data by supporting the topology derived from the SUR1 cysteine constructs. Additionally, epitope labeling is useful to directly ascertain the position of putative internal loops. Flags inserted at position 485 and 1119, corresponding to internal loops 5 and 7, were shown only to label with permeabilization (Fig. 5). These loops flank NBF1, an ATP binding domain known to reside within the cytoplasm (22Nichols C.G. Shyng S.L. Nestorowicz A. Glaser B. Clement J.P., IV Gonzalez G. Aguilar-Bryan L.

It has been shown that drug binding influences ATP binding (25Schwanstecher M. Sieverding C. Dörschner H. Gross I. Aguilar-Bryan L. Schwanstecher C. Bryan J.

Understanding the architecture of SUR1 may give insights to this mechanism.Reentrant Loops in Membrane-spanning Segments 8/9 and 14/15The hydropathy profile of SUR1 suggests that there may be two additional external loops: putative loop 4 bracketed by transmembrane segments 8 and 9, and putative loop 7 bracketed by transmembrane segments 14 and 15. Close inspection of the hydrophobic regions that make up the proposed membrane-spanning segments 8/9 and 14/15 reveals only a limited number of amino acids available to form external loops, of which few are hydrophilic. Based on position and hydrophilicity, Tyr-454 and Thr-1161 were the likeliest candidates for externally residing residues. When replaced with cysteines, these positions were inaccessible to external biotinylating reagent. Attempts to probe regions at the transmembrane interface using increased concentrations of biotin maleimide also indicated that these sites were inaccessible. Topology studies of P-gp used a comparable strategy to examine the two small analogous putative loops. As with SUR1, attempts to label these P-gp regions with increased reagent concentration or incubation time did not result in detectable biotinylation (9Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 843-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Conversely, glycosylation studies with CFTR revealed the two analogous loops to be external (7Chang X.-B. Hou Y.-X. Jensen T.J. Riordan J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18572-18575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In those studies, however, amino acids were added to introduce glycosylation sites, which may have contributed to the accessibility of the region in CFTR. Epitope insertion studies of P-gp were unable to map the region equivalent to putative external loop 4 of SUR1, but showed that the region analogous to external loop 7 is external (10Kast C. Canfield V. Levenson R. Gros P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9240-9248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In that study, the addition of three tandem hemagglutinin tags (27 amino acids) was required to obtain accessibility to labeling for the P-gp loop analogous to SUR1 external loop 7, and the site was inaccessible with the addition of only one to two tandem hemagglutinin tags (10Kast C. Canfield V. Levenson R. Gros P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9240-9248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In SUR1, attempts at “boosting” positions 454 and 1161 to a more accessible position with the introduction of alanines or glycines on either side of the cysteine resulted in SUR1 constructs that lacked complex glycosylation and were not used in analysis.Do putative external loops 4 and 7 extend into the extracellular space? Evidence suggests that these short loops may not be exposed to the surface of the cell, and instead they may form reentrant segments that do not entirely cross the membrane. The hydrophobic putative membrane-spanning region 14/15 consists of only 33 amino acids (residues 1146–1178). This length of hydrophobic stretch is too small to traverse the membrane twice as an α-helix in which 18–20 amino acids per membrane span are required. In addition, the absence of a hydrophilic segment in the middle, and the lack of accessibility of this segment in SUR1 to modifying reagents, suggest that this region does not completely cross the membrane. Accessibility of the analogous site in P-gp and CFTR were only measured after insertion of additional amino acids (7Chang X.-B. Hou Y.-X. Jensen T.J. Riordan J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18572-18575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Kast C. Canfield V. Levenson R. Gros P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9240-9248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Similarly, the hydrophobic stretch for putative membrane-spanning region 8/9 (residues 428–478) lacks a hydrophilic segment that may correspond to an external loop, and is inaccessible in SUR1 and P-gp (but accessible in CFTR after addition of amino acids). In contrast to the 14/15 segment, the 8/9 region is sufficiently long (50 amino acids) to span the membrane twice in an α-helical structure. However, its strongly hydrophobic makeup and lack of external accessibility suggest that it also forms a reentrant membrane loop. Interestingly, the putative 8/9 and 14/15 transmembrane regions each contain a pair of proline residues that is conserved among SUR, MRP, P-gp, and CFTR subfamilies, and we speculate that these prolines may participate in the unique structural arrangement of these segments.Functional Implications of SUR1 MutationsExperiments suggest that the two external cysteines 6 and 26 are required for expression of current. These cysteines are highly conserved, and are present in mammalian SUR1 and SUR2, Drosophila SUR, the MRP proteins, as well as Bpt1p from yeast (6Aguilar-Bryan L. Nichols C.G. Wechsler S.W.

Since preincubation with a reducing agent is necessary for subsequent modification by sulfhydryl reagents in WT SUR1, it is possible that disulfide bonds are present and necessary for channel function. Although SUR1 constructs lacking Cys-6 and Cys-26 did not show detectable currents with patch clamp analysis, topological data from the cysteine mutants are consistent with epitope mapping of Flag-tagged constructs that do form functional channels (Fig. 2), suggesting that cysteine mutants retain normal topological structure.Although the exact role of glycosylation of SUR1 is not understood, oligosaccharides have been shown to play an important role in protein folding (reviewed in Refs. 15Drickamer K. Taylor M.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 321-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar and 16Lehrman M.A. J. Biol.

Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). Consequently, glycosylation of SUR1 constructs was imposed as a requirement for analysis. In addition to the sites discussed, many sites subjected to mutation or Flag insertion resulted in constructs that did not glycosylate. Regions that showed sensitivity to disruption of glycosylation were found in internal loops 4, 5, 8, and 9 and external loop 2. These regions may have some importance in the proper folding of SUR1. Previous studies of insertion of epitope tags into MRP and P-gp similarly showed that function was more often impaired by insertion of tags into intracellular loops (10Kast C. Canfield V. Levenson R. Gros P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9240-9248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar,12Kast C. Gros P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2305-2313Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).Concluding RemarksThe data presented here support a 17-transmembrane model for the topological structure of SUR1 with two pairs of transmembrane segments as possible reentrant loops (Fig. 7). The transmembrane segments are arranged in a 5+6+6 topology in the TM0, TM1, and TM2 domains of SUR1. It is likely that SUR2A and SUR2B have identical topologies to SUR1, given their high sequence homology, similar hydrophobicity profiles, and similar functions. Comparison of the topological structure of SUR1 with other ABC proteins suggests structural similarities among the proteins despite significant functional differences. MRP, a transporter involved in drug resistance of cancer cells, is the protein most closely related to SUR1. Partial mapping of MRP topology is consistent with the 5+6+6 topology model proposed for SUR1 (11Kast C. Gros P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26479-26487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 12Kast C. Gros P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2305-2313Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Determination of SUR1 topology also indicates the close relationship of SUR1 to the more common ABC proteins with the 6+6 conformation such as CFTR and P-gp, and may have broad implications for the structural relationships among ABC proteins. Sulfonylurea receptors (SURx)1 are found in many tissues and play a pivotal role in synchronizing electrical excitability with cellular metabolic state. SURx, members of the ATP binding cassette (ABC) family of proteins, associate with inward rectifier Kir6.x in a heterooctameric 4:4 stoichiometry to form ATP-sensitive (KATP) channels (for review, see Refs. 1Aguilar-Bryan L.

https://openalex.org/W2078035670,"The CD95 ligand (FasL) transmembrane protein is found on activated T cells and cells outside the immune system. A well-known turnover process of membrane FasL is mediated by matrix metalloproteinase, which generates soluble FasL (sFasL). Here, we demonstrate that membrane FasL turnover occurs effectively through the release of membrane vesicles. Quantitative analysis indicates that this process is as effective as sFasL release for FasL-3T3 cells but somewhat less effective for FasL-expressing T cells. The apoptosis-inducing membrane vesicles display unique properties not found in FasL-expressing cells and sFasL. Unlike sFasL, vesicle-associated FasL remained bioactive, killing the same panel of targets that are susceptible to FasL-expressing cells. In contrast to FasL-expressing T cells, FasL-mediated killing by vesicles do not involve LFA-1/ICAM interaction and do not depend on <i>de novo</i>protein synthesis. These observations indicate that the release of FasL-bearing vesicles contributes to the turnover of cell-associated FasL, but the impact of the bioactive FasL-expressing vesicles on the function of cell-associated FasL is different from that of sFasL."
https://openalex.org/W2075849180,"Progesterone receptors (PR) contain three activation functions (AFs) that together define the extent to which they regulate transcription. AF1 and AF2 are common to the two isoforms of PR, PR-A and PR-B, whereas AF3 lies within the N-terminal 164 amino acids unique to PR-B, termed the “B-upstream segment” (BUS). To define the BUS regions that contribute to AF3 function, we generated a series of deletion and amino acid substitution mutants and tested them in three backgrounds as follows: BUS alone fused to the PR DNA binding domain (BUS-DBD), the entire PR-B N terminus linked to its DBD (NT-B), and full-length PR-B. Analyses of these mutants identified two regions in BUS whose loss reduces AF3 activity by more than 90%. These are associated with amino acids 54–90 (R1) and 120–154 (R2).

The ligand-activated receptors bind DNA and regulate gene transcription through regions called activation functions (AFs), AF1 in the N-terminal region upstream of the DBD and AF2 in the HBD. These AFs are thought to regulate transcription directly, by contacting the basal transcription machinery, or indirectly, by binding co-regulatory proteins. Indeed, the latter appears to be a major mechanism, and a large number of receptor co-activators and co-repressors have been identified (1McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr.

Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar). The effects of the steroid hormone, progesterone, are mediated through nuclear progesterone receptors (PR). They exist naturally as two isoforms and are transcribed from two promoters present on a single gene (5Kastner P. Krust A. Turcotte B. Stropp U. Tora L. Gronemeyer H. Chambon P.

Full-length human PR-A are only 769 amino acids in length because they lack 164 N-terminal amino acids present in PR-B. The extra 164 amino acids in the PR-B upstream segment (BUS) are responsible for important functional differences between the two PR isoforms, because BUS contains a strong third AF (AF3) (6Sartorius C.A.

Two additional AFs, analogous to those of other NR, are shared by PR-A and PR-B; AF1 maps to 91 amino acids just upstream of the DBD and AF2 lies within the HBD (7Meyer M.E. Pornon A. Ji J.W.

Milde-Langosch K. Schulte H.M. Loning T. Horm. Res. (Basel). 2000; 54: 32-37Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PR-A to PR-B ratio also varies widely among human breast cancers, with unknown consequences (22Graham J.D. Yeates C. Balleine R.L. Harvey S.S. Milliken J.S. Bilous A.M. Clarke C.L. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5063-5068PubMed Google Scholar). Although the transcriptional differences between PR-A and PR-B have been soundly documented, the mechanisms underlying these differences remain unknown. We have postulated that AF3 in BUS plays an important role, and we have compared the structures of N-terminal A (NT-A) and N-terminal B (NT-B), which are constitutively active forms of PR lacking only the HBD of the full-length receptors (23Bain D.L. Franden M.A. McManaman J.L. Takimoto G.S. Horwitz K.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7313-7320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 24Bain D.L. Franden M.A. McManaman J.L. Takimoto G.S. Horwitz K.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23825-23831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), in an effort to explain their functional differences. These studies indicate that the N termini exist in a non-globular, extended conformation. Interestingly, BUS is even more extended than the downstream regions common to NT-A and NT-B; it is not an independent structural domain. Rather, the ensemble distribution of conformational states is more restricted in NT-B than in NT-A. This suggests that in NT-B BUS stabilizes the rest of the N terminus in a functionally active set of conformations. We therefore attempt to explain the mechanisms by which BUS exerts this stabilizing effect to yield AF3 activity. To that end, we have now mapped BUS in detail, by generating a series of deletion and amino acid substitution mutants. We found two BUS subregions, designated R1 (residues 54–84) and R2 (residues 120–154), that are necessary for efficient transcription by PR-B. Removal of either of these regions decreases the transcriptional efficiency of PR-B by >60%. Removal of both reduces their transcriptional efficiency by >90%. These regions define hydrophilic or hydrophobic peaks within BUS. Mutation of key amino acids within these peaks leads to major decrements in function. Two sites contain canonical LXXLL motifs, usually found on NR co-activators, and are required for their binding to the HBD (4Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar, 25Heery D.M. Hoare S. Hussain S. Parker M.G. Sheppard H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6695-6702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). When these are mutated in BUS, AF3 activity is lost. Tryptophan 140 is also absolutely required for AF3 activity. We discuss the implications of this for BUS structure, and we speculate that BUS is involved in protein-protein interactions that generate AF3 function. Wild-type pSG5-BUS-DBD, which expresses BUS (amino acids 1–164) of human PR-B, fused to the human PR DBD and nuclear localization signal (NLS, amino acids 556–645), was constructed by removing BUS from the full-length PR-B expression vector (pSG5-hPR1) as described previously (6Sartorius C.A. Melville M.Y. Hovland A.R. Tung L. Takimoto G.S. Horwitz K.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1347-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). BUS deletion mutants were initially constructed in pSG5-BUS-DBD by removing wild-type BUS withEcoRI and RsrII restriction enzymes and replacing it with PCR-generated deletion BUS mutants. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out by PCR amplification of wild-type BUS using oligonucleotides containing specific point mutations. Mutant constructs were used to replace wild-type BUS at theEcoRI/RsrII sites in the original vector. All mutations were verified by automated fluorescence sequencing (University of Colorado Health Sciences Cancer Center Core Lab). All BUS deletions and mutants were subsequently moved by direct subcloning, first into pSG5-NT-B, which expresses the entire PR-B N terminus, plus the DBD and NLS (amino acids 1–645), and lacks only the HBD (6Sartorius C.A. Melville M.Y. Hovland A.R. Tung L. Takimoto G.S. Horwitz K.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1347-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), and second into full-length PR-B (pSG5-hPR1). Correct expression of all constructs was verified by transient transfection into COS cells and immunoblotting. Expression of wild-type and mutant PR constructs was verified in COS monkey kidney cells. Briefly, cells were plated at 3 × 105 per 100-mm plate 1 day prior to transfection. Two µg of expression plasmid and 3 µg of internal control plasmid (β-galactosidase) were transiently transfected into each dish by calcium phosphate co-precipitation (26Tung L. Mohamed M.K. Hoeffler J.P. Takimoto G.S. Horwitz K.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1256-1265PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Cells were collected and digested in Elution Buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% bovine serum albumin) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals); extracts were normalized to β-galactosidase activity and resolved by SDS-PAGE (12% acrylamide for pGS5-BUS-DBD, 10% for pSG5-NT-B, and 7.5% for pSG5-PR-B). Immunoblots were either probed with a polyclonal antibody to the PR DBD (gift of David Toft, Mayo Medical School, Rochester, MN) (27Smith D.F. Lubahn D.B. McCormick D.J. Wilson E.M. Toft D.O. Endocrinology. 1988; 122: 2816-2825Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) or with anti-PR monoclonal antibodies AB-52 and B-30 (28Estes P.A. Suba E.J. Lawler-Heavner J. Elashry-Stowers D.

HeLa cervical carcinoma cells were plated in minimum Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum (twice charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum for experiments containing full-length PR-B constructs), at a density of 1.1 × 105 cells per 60-mm dish, 1 day prior to transfection. Cells were transfected by calcium phosphate co-precipitation (26Tung L. Mohamed M.K. Hoeffler J.P. Takimoto G.S. Horwitz K.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1256-1265PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) using concentrations of expression vectors ranging between 5 and 500 ng, depending on the experiment. Two reporters were tested each at 2 µg/dish as follows: a PRE2-TATA-luciferase reporter containing two tandem copies of a perfect palindromic PRE, or a mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter-luciferase construct (gift of S. Nordeen, University of Colorado, Denver, CO) (29Nordeen S.K. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 454-458PubMed Google Scholar). SV40-Renilla luciferase was added as an internal control vector at 20 ng per dish. After transfection, cells were grown for 24 h prior to collection. For experiments with full-length PR-B, the synthetic progestin R5020 was added to each dish at a final concentration of 10 or 100 nm as indicated. The HBD truncated constructs are constitutively active. Cells were collected in 150 µl of lysis buffer (Promega), and 50 µl were analyzed on a dual luminometer. Results were normalized to Renilla luciferase activity and expressed as relative firefly/Renillaluciferase activity. PR-negative T47D human breast cancer cells (30Sartorius C.A. Groshong S.D. Miller L.A. Powell R.L. Tung L. Takimoto G.S. Horwitz K.B. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3868-3877PubMed Google Scholar) were transfected by electroporation. Briefly, cells were collected and resuspended in minimum Eagle's medium at 10 × 106 cells/ml. Cell suspensions were electroporated at 220 V, 950 microfarads with 1 µg of expression vector, 2 µg of luciferase reporter, and 250 ng of SV40-Renilla luciferase per 1 × 106 cells and plated in 35-mm dishes. After a recovery period of 16–20 h, cells were treated with 10 nm R5020 for an additional 24 h. Cells were collected in 100 µl lysis buffer (Promega), and 50 µl were read on a dual luminometer. The present studies analyze the activity of BUS, amino acids 1–164 of human PR-B, in three different backgrounds (Fig.1A) as follows: BUS-DBD (amino acids 1–164 plus 556–645), which contains BUS linked directly upstream of the PR DBD and NLS; NT-B (amino acids 1–645), which contains the entire N terminus of PR-B including the DBD and NLS; and full-length PR-B (amino acids 1–933). These constructs allow study of the presumptive AF3 in BUS alone (BUS-DBD), together with AF1 (NT-B), or with AF1 + AF2 (PR-B). As a control, most studies also include the N terminus of PR-A (NT-A), which has only AF1, or full-length PR-A, which has AF1 + AF2 but not AF3. Note that constructs lacking the HBD are constitutively active. The activity of full-length PR-A and PR-B was tested using saturating concentrations of the synthetic progestin, R5020. Fig. 1 B shows the transcriptional activity of these constructs expressed in HeLa cells after transfection with increasing concentrations of the cDNA expression vectors. The cells were also transfected with a PRE2-TATA luciferase promoter-reporter, with Renilla luciferase to monitor transfection efficiency, and treated with or without R5020 as needed. Data are reported as relative luciferase activities of triplicate transfections, after correction for the Renilla control. Full-length PR-B characteristically have a bell-shaped dose-response curve, with maximal activity at intermediate protein concentrations, and decreasing activity at higher concentrations due to “squelching” (31Giangrande P.H. Pollio G. McDonnell D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32889-32900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). PR-A show a similar pattern of activity, but maximal transcription is generally less than 10% that of PR-B (6Sartorius C.A. Melville M.Y. Hovland A.R. Tung L. Takimoto G.S. Horwitz K.B. Mol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 32889-32900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Unlike the full-length receptors, the dose-response of NT-B and BUS-DBD does not saturate, with increasing activity at increasing protein concentrations. Their maximal activity is equivalent to, or greater than, that of full-length PR-B. This pattern of transcription suggests that squelching requires the presence of the HBD. NT-A has lower activity, analogous to that of PR-A. Because of the variations in activity with varying cDNA levels, analysis of the BUS mutant constructs was always carried out by transfection of multiple cDNA concentrations. In some cases, only the maximal activity is reported. PR are richly phosphorylated proteins (32Zhang Y. Beck C.A. Poletti A. Edwards D.P. Weigel N.L. Mol.

PR-B are more highly phosphorylated than PR-A because of multiple potential phosphorylation sites in BUS, among which phosphorylation of Ser-20, Ser-81, Ser-102, and Ser-162 have been documented in vivo (32Zhang Y. Beck C.A. Poletti A. Edwards D.P. Weigel N.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1029-1040Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Zhang Y. Beck C.A. Poletti A. Edwards D.P. Weigel N.L. J. Biol.

We previously mutated, individually or collectively, all of the potential BUS phosphorylation sites, and we found no decrement in the transcriptional activity of PR-B (TableI) (34Takimoto G.S.

Additionally, there are several cysteine residues in BUS that could theoretically be involved in disulfide bond formation. These were mutated to alanine either singly or together. Transcriptional activity of the mutant PR-B constructs was analogous to that of wild-type PR-B (Table I and data not shown). We conclude that neither phosphorylation nor disulfide bond formation are critical for the AF3 activity of BUS.Table IAmino acid substitutions at serine and cysteine residues in BUS-DBD that have no significant effect on transcriptional activity compared with wild-type BUS-DBDMutation(s)Number of amino acid changesS20A/S25A2S20A/S25A/S99A/S100A/S101A/S102A6S20A/S25A/S99A/S100A/S101A/S102A/S130A7S20A/S25A/S99A/S100A/S101A/S102A/S130A/S162A8S20A/S25A/S99A/S100A/S101A/S102A/S130A/S162A/ S79A/S81A10C29A1C64A1C134A1C141A1C29A/C141A2C134A/C141A2Amino acid changes were made in BUS-DBD as indicated, and transcription was measured in HeLa cells from a PRE2-TATA-luciferase promoter-reporter.

To target sites important for AF3 activity, we generated a series of stepwise deletions from the N terminus, C terminus, and internal regions of BUS. This was accomplished by a PCR-based technique in which specific BUS regions were amplified and used to replace wild-type BUS in expression vectors. BUS deletion mutants were cloned into all three transcriptionally active BUS contexts: BUS-DBD (6Sartorius C.A. Melville M.Y. Hovland A.R. Tung L. Takimoto G.S. Horwitz K.B. Mol.

The accuracy of all constructs was verified by DNA sequencing and by protein expression following transient transfection. Fig. 2shows a representative Western blot of N-terminal deletion constructs in the context of PR-B. Vectors containing PR-B deletions were transiently expressed in COS cells, and whole cell lysates were prepared and separated on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose, and the blot was probed with an anti-PR monoclonal antibody whose epitope lies in the N-terminal region common to both PR isoforms (28Estes P.A. Suba E.J.

The 120-kDa full-length wild-type PR-B is shown inlane 1. Stepwise deletions of PR-B ranging from 23 to 148 amino acids are shown sequentially in lanes 2–7. The 94-kDa PR-A protein is shown in lane 8. Fig. 3, A–C, shows the consequences of stepwise deletions from the BUS N terminus (A), C terminus (B), or both (C) on the transcriptional activity of BUS in the context of the following three backgrounds: BUS-DBD, NT-B, or PR-B. Expression vectors were transfected into HeLa cells at 500 (BUS-DBD and NT-B) or 25 ng/dish (PR-B) (see Fig. 1), and transcription was measured from the PRE2-TATA-luciferase reporter. All data points represent the average of at least four independent assays in a minimum of two separate experiments. The activity of wild-type constructs containing BUS, in each of the three backgrounds, was set at 100%. The data are summarized in Table IIand include statistical analyses.Table IITranscriptional activity of BUS deletion mutants in three PR constructsTable IITranscriptional activity of BUS deletion mutants in three PR constructsThe bars in column 1 graphically depict the amino acid region(s) of BUS that were present in the constructs tested.

Stepwise deletions of BUS from the N terminus, ranging from Δ23 to Δ148 amino acids, in BUS-DBD, NT-B, and PR-B, are shown in Fig.3 A. The first deletion, Δ23, consistently increases (135–185%) receptor activity in all three backgrounds, compared with wild-type BUS constructs (100%). This suggests that the first 23 amino acids of BUS contain an inhibitory activity. Deletion of the first 54 amino acids (Δ54) restores transcription to approximately wild-type, suggesting that AF3 activity does not reside in these residues. Note that when the three BUS backgrounds are compared, deletions always have the most deleterious effects in the context of BUS-DBD. We speculate that AF1 and/or AF2 in the other two constructs partially compensate for the loss of AF3. Deletion to Δ84 dramatically lowers (by 86%) the transcriptional activity of BUS-DBD and extensively lowers the activity of NT-B (by 64%) and PR-B (by 66%), suggesting that at least one important region of AF3 lies within amino acids 54–84 of BUS. Additional deletions to amino acids 114, 135, and 148 reduce the activity of BUS-DBD to negligible levels (below 5%) and also cause major decrements of function in NT-B and PR-B. The PR DBD alone has no activity. A second set of stepwise deletions starting from the C terminus of BUS was tested in the background of BUS-DBD and NT-B (Fig. 3 B). Interestingly, deletion of the C-terminal 30 amino acids (136) reduced transcription by more than 90% in both backgrounds. All residual activity was lost with further C-terminal truncations. We conclude that a second region at the C terminus of BUS is also important for AF3 activity. Constructs containing deletions from both the N- and C-terminal ends of BUS are shown in Fig. 3 C. These double deletions generally support the conclusions drawn from the single deletions above, namely that AF3 activity depends on two BUS regions. Deletions up to amino ac"

Herein we report the structural and functional properties of the Zn(II)-binding site in DDAH-1 from bovine brain. Activity measurements of the native and metal-free enzyme have revealed that the endogenously bound Zn(II) inhibits the enzyme. Native DDAH-1 could be fully or partially activated using various concentrations of phosphate, imidazole, histidine, and histamine, a process that is paralleled by the release of Zn(II). The slow activation of the enzyme by the bulky complexing agents EDTA and 1,10-phenantroline suggests that the Zn(II)-binding site is partially buried in the protein structure. The apparent Zn(II)-dissociation constant of 4.2 nm, determined by19F NMR using the chelator 5F-BAPTA (1,2-bis(2-amino-5-fluorophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid), lies in the range of intracellular free Zn(II) concentrations. These results suggest a regulatory role for the Zn(II)-binding site. The coordination environment of the Zn(II) in DDAH-1 has been examined by Zn K-edge x-ray absorption spectroscopy.

The two constitutive isoforms, nNOS (neuronal) and eNOS (endothelial), produce NO for neurotransmission and cardiovascular regulation, respectively, and are predominantly regulated by cytosolic Ca2+ levels (13Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 175-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (2127) Google Scholar). It is well established that MMA and ADMA are endogenous competitive inhibitors of NOS (9Cooke J.P.

The intracellular l-Arg levels and the corresponding Km value of NOS are such that the production of NO should not depend on l-Arg supplementation (15Wu G. Morris Jr., S.M. Biochem.

Coleman S.M. Dzau V.J. Cooke J.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1248-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar), a phenomenon called the “Arg paradox.” In this context, it may be noted that recent in vitro studies have shown that the concomitant presence of varying, yet physiologically relevant, levels of MMA and ADMA dramatically affects NOS activity (17Tsikas D.

The role of DDAH-1 in the regulation of nNOS is also evident from recent studies showing that both proteins are up-regulated in injured neurons (26Nakagomi S. Kiryu-Seo S. Kimoto M. Emson P.C.

Cooke J.P. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1998; 32: S48-S53PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, increased levels of ADMA in plasma have been discussed as a risk factor for atherosclerosis (3Böger R.H.

Biol. 2000; 20: 2032-2037Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). In contrast, NO overproduction apparently leads to diseases such as septic shock and migraine. In these cases, clinical studies using MMA as a drug have been or are currently being conducted (28Grover R. Zaccardelli D. Colice G. Guntupalli K. Watson D. Vincent J.-L. Crit.

Cephalalgia. 1998; 18: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar).The above studies clearly indicate the importance of DDAH in NO metabolism. Previously, we have demonstrated that DDAH-1 from bovine brain is a monomeric (31.2 kDa) Zn(II)-containing protein (30Fundel S.M. Pountney D.L. Bogumil R. Gehrig P.M. Hasler D.W. Faller P. Vašák M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and that the Zn(II) is not involved in the catalytic process (24Bogumil R. Knipp M. Fundel S.M. Vašák M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4791-4798Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In addition to a structure-stabilizing role, derived from an increased temperature stability of the holoform compared with that of the apoform (24Bogumil R. Knipp M. Fundel S.M. Vašák M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4791-4798Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), a regulatory function for the Zn(II) has also been suggested (24Bogumil R. Knipp M. Fundel S.M. Vašák M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4791-4798Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar,31Kimoto M. Miyatake S. Sasagawa T. Yamashita H. Okita M. Oka T. Ogawa T. Tsuji H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 863-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, the precise function of the Zn(II) in DDAH-1 remains unclear. In this connection it may be noted that in the recently determined crystal structure of a prokaryotic DDAH, no bound metal has been reported (32Murray-Rust J. Leiper J. McAllister M. Phelan J. Tilley S. Santa Maria J. Vallance P. McDonald N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 679-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar).The present work was undertaken with the aim of gaining a better understanding of the role of Zn(II) in mammalian DDAH-1. To facilitate these investigations, a substantially improved isolation procedure for DDAH-1 from bovine brain has been developed. The nature of the Zn(II)-binding site in DDAH-1 has been examined by extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) associated with the ZnK-edge. The competition between the metal chelator 5F-BAPTA and Zn(II)-DDAH-1 has been used to determine the Zn(II) binding constant by 19F NMR spectroscopy. Measurements of enzyme activity have revealed that in a number of common buffer systems DDAH-1 is inactive, but it becomes active when the Zn(II)-free (or apo-) form is generated. The latter effect could be reversed by a subsequent metal reincorporation, suggesting that the bound Zn(II) inhibits the enzyme. The possible biological implications of these findings are discussed.MATERIALS AND METHODSAprotinin from bovine lung and leupeptin were purchased from Sigma and MMA·HOAc from Alexis. Tris-(2-carboxyethyl)-phosphine·HCl, soybean trypsin inhibitor,l-His, d-His, and histamine·2 HCl were obtained from Fluka. K45F-BAPTA is a product of Molecular Probes Inc. Dialysis tubing (molecular weight cut-off; 12–14 kDa, Spectrum) was rendered metal-free as described (33Auld D.S. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 158: 13-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Bovine brains were obtained from a slaughterhouse and stored at −20 °C until used.Metal and Protein QuantificationThe zinc concentration was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy (IL Video 12) and that of DDAH-1 by absorption spectroscopy (Cary 300, Varian), using the molar extinction coefficient ε280 nm = 14,420 m−1cm−1 (24Bogumil R. Knipp M. Fundel S.M. Vašák M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4791-4798Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).Activity MeasurementsThe product of the enzymatic reaction, l-Cit, was determined by our colorimetric method in 96-well microtiter plates (34Knipp M. Vašák M. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 286: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). If not otherwise stated, upon substrate addition (6.7 mm MMA) the samples were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. All activity measurements were performed in triplicate. One unit of DDAH-1 is defined as the amount of enzyme that produces 1 µmol ofl-Cit/min under the conditions given.Protein PurificationAll purification steps (a—f) exceptl-Arg affinity chromatography were performed at 4 °C. During the protein isolation, the activity of DDAH-1 was determined in 250 mm imidazole/HCl, pH 7.0. The protein concentration was estimated by taking one absorbance unit at 280 nm to correspond to ∼1 mg of protein ml−1.Step a: Tissue HomogenizationTwo frozen bovine brains were thawed overnight. The tissue was cut into pieces and washed with 20 mm Tris/HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mmEDTA, pH 8.0. Subsequently, the tissue was homogenized in a food processor together with a triple volume of 50 mm TEA/HCl, 5 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 10 µg ml−1 trypsin inhibitor, 0.1 µg ml−1 aprotinin, 0.5 µg ml−1 leupeptin, pH 8.0. The mixture was then stirred for 30 min and centrifuged for 60 min at 5,000 × g.Step b: (NH4)2SO4PrecipitationThe supernatant (a) was fractionated by (NH4)2SO4, and the precipitate formed between 30 and 80% saturation was collected by centrifugation. The precipitate was resuspended in about 200 ml of 5 mmTEA/HCl, pH 8.2.Step c: Hydrophobic Interaction ChromatographyThe protein sample (b) was applied to a Phenyl-Sepharose 6 Fast Flow column (5.5 × 16 cm) (High Sub, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was equilibrated in 1.8 mm(NH4)2SO4/TEA, pH 7.8. Proteins were eluted with a linear salt gradient from 1.8 mm(NH4)2SO4/TEA to 20 mmTEA/HCl at pH 7.8 and the active fractions were combined. The solution was dialyzed two times against 5 liters of 1 mm TEA/HCl, pH 7.8. Prior to dialysis, the following protease inhibitors were added: 10 µg ml−1 trypsin inhibitor, 0.1 µg of ml−1 aprotinin, 0.5 µg ml−1 leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride.Step d: Anion Exchange ChromatographyThe conductivity of the protein sample (c) was adjusted with H2O to ≤ 15 mΩ−1 cm−1 and then applied to a Source 15Q column (2.6 × 15 cm, Pharmacia) equilibrated with 10 mm TEA/HCl, pH 7.6. The protein was eluted with a linear salt gradient from 0 to 200 mm KCl and the active fractions were pooled.Step e: l-Arg Affinity Chromatographyl-Arg-Sepharose was prepared from NHS-activated Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described (35van Sommeren A.P.G. Machielsen P.A.G.M. Gribnau T.C.J. J. Chromatogr. 1993; 639: 23-31Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar) including the following changes. In the coupling reaction, a solution of 500 mml-Arg/HCl, 200 mm H3BO3, 500 mm NaCl, pH 8.2, was used. Subsequently, the resin was washed three times, alternately with 500 mm ethanolamine/HCl, 500 mm NaCl, pH 9.0, and 250 mm NaOAc/HOAc, 500 mm NaCl, pH 4.0. A coupling efficiency of ≥99% was found by amino acid analysis.The conductivity of the protein sample (d) was adjusted with H2O to ≤ 5 mΩ−1 cm−1 and applied to a l-Arg-Sepharose column (2.6 × 13 cm) equilibrated with 10 mm TEA/HCl, pH 7.6 at room temperature. The resin was washed with 100 ml of 10 mmTEA/HCl, pH 7.6 and the protein eluted with 100 ml of 10 mmTEA/HCl, 30 mml-Arg, pH 7.6.Step f: Size Exclusion ChromatographyThe protein solution(e) was concentrated in Centriprep-10 (Millipore) to 3 ml. The final protein sample was applied to a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 column (Pharmacia) equilibrated with 10 mm TEA/HCl, 100 mm KCl, pH 7.4. The active fractions were combined.Depletion and Reintroduction of Zn(II)All dialysis steps were carried out at 4 °C and the outer solutions were steadily bubbled with argon. Buffers were rendered metal-free as previously described (24Bogumil R. Knipp M. Fundel S.M. Vašák M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4791-4798Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To remove the Zn(II) from native DDAH-1, 200 µl of the protein sample (∼50 µm) was dialyzed against 100 ml of 100 mm imidazole/HCl, 10 mm DTT, pH 6.8. The dialysis buffer was changed 4 times (every 2 h) and the dialysis completed overnight. To remove imidazole and DTT, the protein was dialyzed against 2 changes of 100 ml of 10 mm MES/NaOH, 100 mm KCl, pH 6.2. The re-introduction of Zn(II) into apoDDAH-1 was accomplished for 200 µl of the apoprotein (∼50 µm); this was first dialyzed against 100 ml of 10 mm Tris/HCl, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mmTris-(2-carboxyethyl)-phosphine, pH 8.0 (2 h), followed by dialysis overnight against 100 ml of 10 mm Tris/HCl, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm ZnSO4, pH 7.4. To remove unbound Zn(II), the sample was passed through a Fast Desalting Column HR 10/10 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in 10 mm MES/NaOH, 100 mm KCl, pH 6.2. Protein-containing fractions were collected and concentrated using Centricon-10 (Millipore).Dependence of the Enzymatic Activity on Various Buffers and pH ValuesNative DDAH-1 (0.91 µm) or apoDDAH-1 (0.5 µm) was incubated in 60 µl of various 100 mm buffers at different pH values due to the corresponding buffer capacities (Fig. 1). The pH values of these buffers were determined at 37 °C.Dependence of the Enzymatic Activity on the Buffer ConcentrationThe activity of 0.79 µm native DDAH-1 and apoDDAH-1, respectively, was determined in 60 µl of either 10, 20, 50, 100, or 400 mm Tris/HCl, imidazole/HCl, or HEPES/NaOH buffers. The pH of buffer solutions containing MMA was adjusted to 7.4.Influence of the l-His Concentration on the Zn(II) Content of DDAH-1Five samples of 5 µm native DDAH-1 (Zn(II) content: 0.95 mol equivalents) were incubated on ice for 30 min in 50 mm TEA/HCl, 150 mm KCl, pH 7.4, containing 0, 10, 20, 50, or 100 mml-His. 10 mmMMA was immediately added and the samples incubated for 160 min at 37 °C. For the colorimetric measurement 10 µl aliquots were taken every 10 min and added to a mixture of 50 µl of H2O and 150 µl of 6 m H2SO4, 3m H3PO4, 2 mmNH4Fe(SO4)2 in a 96-well microtiter plate. Because of the limited stability of the developing dye under acid conditions the reported method (34Knipp M. Vašák M. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 286: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) was modified as follows. The addition of 50 µl of the chromogenic solution, containing 80 mm diacetyl monoxime and 2.0 mmthiosemicarbazide, was performed prior to the heating step (34Knipp M. Vašák M. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 286: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The remaining sample solutions were dialyzed against 10 mmTEA/HCl, 150 mm KCl, pH 7.5, for 2.5 h at room temperature and afterward their Zn(II) content was determined.Influence of Salt Concentration and Various Derivatives of Imidazole on the Enzymatic ActivityNative DDAH-1 (1.1 µm) was incubated in 100 mm TEA/HCl, pH 7.4, containing (at 50 mm each) imidazole, l-His, d-His, or histamine, and the activity was determined. The activity of a control sample, containing DDAH-1 in 100 mm TEA/HCl, pH 7.4, was also measured. Similar measurements were performed in the presence of additional 50 or 500 mm KCl.Circular Dichroism (CD) StudiesThe CD spectra of apo- and holoDDAH-1 (25 µm) were recorded on a Jasco (Model J-715) spectropolarimeter in metal-free 10 mm Tris-H3BO3, pH 7.4, using a 0.02 cm quartz cuvette as previously described (24Bogumil R. Knipp M. Fundel S.M. Vašák M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4791-4798Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).Determination of the Zn(II) Binding ConstantNative DDAH-1 was concentrated in a Centricon-10 and the buffer exchanged to 25 mm HEPES/NaOH, 50 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) 2H2O, 1 mmTris-(2-carboxyethyl)-phosphine, pH 7.4. The final protein concentration was 0.42 mm (value based on Zn(II) content). 0.5 ml of this protein solution was incubated with 0.25 mm5F-BABTA at 20 °C in a 5-mm NMR tube. The 19F {1H} NMR spectrum was recorded on a Bruker AMX-600 spectrometer after 17- and 37-h incubations; 4920 scans were accumulated with a delay time of 1 s using a 40° pulse at 20 °C. For the calculation of the apparent Zn(II) binding constant of DDAH-1 the following equation KZn(II)−DDAH−1=KZN(II)-5F-BAPTA[Zn(II)−DDAH−1]0βα2[5F−BAPTA]0(α+β)−βαEquation 1 derived by Hasler et al. (36Hasler D.W. Jensen L.T. Zerbe O. Winge D.R. Vašák M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14567-14575Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) was used, whereα is the integral of the signal of Zn(II)-5F-BAPTA,β that of free 5F-BAPTA, [Zn(II)-DDAH-1]0the initial concentration of holoDDAH-1, and [5F-BAPTA]0the initial concentration of 5F-BAPTA. The apparent Zn(II)-binding constant of 5F-BAPTA, KZn(II)-5F-BAPTA = 1.3 × 108m−1 at an ionic strength of 0.138 m, pH 7.1, 30 °C (37Long G.J. Rosen J.F. Schanne F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 834-837Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was corrected for the conditions applied in this experiment using the program CHELATOR (38Schoenmakers T.J. Visser G.J. Flik G. Theuvenet A.P. BioTechniques. 1992; 12: 870-874PubMed Google Scholar).Preparation of XAS Sample and XAS Data Collection and AnalysisNative DDAH-1 was concentrated to 0.8 mm using a Centricon-10 microconcentrator, exchanging the buffer simultaneously to argon-saturated 25 mm TEA/HCl, 15% (v/v) glycerol, 100 mm KCl, pH 7.4. The solution was injected into an aluminum sample cell with Mylar windows, frozen in liquid nitrogen and the sample was maintained at 77 K in a cryostat with Mylar windows. The x-ray absorption spectrum was measured at Zn K-edge on station 8.1 at the CLRC Daresbury Synchrotron Radiation Source operating at 2 GeV with an average current of 150 mA. An Si(220) double crystal monochromator was used, detuned to 70% of the maximum intensity to minimize any residual harmonic contamination after the focusing mirror.The monochromator energy was calibrated by recording theK-edge profile of a zinc foil before and after the collection of spectra for native DDAH-1; the position of theK-edge of the zinc foil (9669 eV) did not change during data collection. The Zn K-edge XAS of native DDAH-1 was obtained in fluorescence mode using a Canberra 13-element solid-state detector; 24 scans were recorded and averaged. The extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) was analyzed using the Daresbury program EXCURV98 (39Binsted, N. (1998) in CLRC Daresbury Laboratory EXCURV98 Program.Google Scholar), involving exact curved wave theory (40Lee P.A. Pendry J.B. Phys. Rev. 1975; B11: 2795-2811Crossref Scopus (986) Google Scholar, 41Gurman S.J. Binsted N. Ross I. J. Phys. Chem. 1984; 17: 143-151Google Scholar). The phase shifts were derived from ab initio calculations using Hedin-Lundqvist potentials and von Barth ground states (42Hedin L. S. L. Solid State Phys. 1969; 23: 1-181Google Scholar). The EXAFS simulations commenced from the Fourier transform of the experimental data and involved placing of shells of back-scatterering atoms around the Zn(II), at chemically sensible distances, and refining (i) the Fermi energy (Ef), (ii) the absorber-scatterer distances, (iii) the occupation number, and (iv) the Debye-Waller type factors (2ς2) of each shell, to obtain optimum agreement between the experimental and simulated data.DISCUSSIONIn this work we have demonstrated that the isolated Zn(II)-DDAH-1 is inactive. Several other enzymes, including glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (51Krotkiewska B. Banas T. Int. J. Biochem. 1992; 24: 1501-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and caspase-3 (52Perry D.K. Smyth M.J. Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Duriez P. Poirier G.G. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18530-18533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar), and receptors like N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor and γ-aminobutyric acid receptorA (53Choi D.W. Koh J.Y. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1998; 21: 347-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar) are inhibited by Zn(II). However, to our knowledge, the isolation of a Zn(II)-containing enzyme, in which Zn(II) is an inhibitor, has so far not been reported. The observed activation of DDAH-1 upon release of Zn(II) suggests a regulatory role for this metal-binding site.The activity of the apoenzyme displays a broad pH-profile with maximum activity at about pH 7.8 (Fig. 1B). The activation of the holoenzyme by the release of Zn(II) was demonstrated in phosphate and imidazole buffers, for which a maximum activity was observed at pH 6.2 and 6.8, respectively (Fig. 1A). In the other buffers examined, the maximum activity occurred at around pH 5.3. The differences observed in the degree of DDAH-1 activation and in the pH maxima for various buffers essentially follow the variations of the activity of the apoenzyme with pH (Fig. 1). Thus, these results indicate that the observed behavior reflects changes in the amount of the active apoform brought about by differences in metal affinities of these buffers. In buffers that lack an appreciable metal binding affinity, the obtained enzymatic activity reflects the presence of a small amount of apoenzyme in native DDAH-1. In view of these data, we suggest that in the initial characterization of DDAH-1 from rat, a Zn(II)-containing form has also been studied since a pH maximum at 6.5 in 100 mm phosphate buffer has been reported (18Ogawa T. Kimoto M. Sasaoka K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10205-10209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).As judged by the comparison of the specific activities of the apo- and holoenzyme, full metal activation of the holoenzyme would require ≥400 mm imidazole (Fig. 3). Taking advantage of the enzyme activation in imidazole/HCl and the absence of this effect in TEA/HCl, we examined the activity of DDAH-1 in crude bovine brain extract, using 250 mm buffer concentrations. An ∼30% higher DDAH-1 activity is observed in imidazole/HCl compared with TEA/HCl, suggesting that only about 70% of the enzyme was present in the active Zn(II)-free form. This implies that if the true activity is sought,e.g. in cellular extracts, non-activating buffers should be used.Both phosphate and imidazole buffers have been shown to be much more effective in generating apoprotein than bulky metal-chelating agents such as EDTA or 1,10-phenantroline. We ascribe this effect to an inaccessibility of the Zn(II)-binding site to these rather bulky chelators. Thus, it would appear that the Zn(II)-binding site is partially buried in the protein structure. The enzyme activation by phosphate or imidazole presumably reflects both the ability of these agents to access the bound Zn(II) and their metal-complexing ability. However, their marked chemical and electrostatic differences may imply that the mechanism of enzyme activation differs. The differences in the Zn(II)-DDAH-1 activation observed with both stereoisomers of His suggest a certain specificity toward the structure of the metal-depleting compound. However, in all instances the enzyme activation required high concentrations of the activating compounds, suggesting that they are not the physiological enzyme-activating molecules. Because the DDAH from Pseudomonas aureus exists as a dimer (32Murray-Rust J. Leiper J. McAllister M. Phelan J. Tilley S. Santa Maria J. Vallance P. McDonald N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 679-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), it wa"

Several recent studies have revealed direct effector proteins through which G12 subfamily members may transmit signals leading to various cellular responses. Our laboratory recently demonstrated that Gα12 and Gα13specifically interact with the cytoplasmic domains of several members of the cadherin family of cell adhesion molecules (Meigs, T. E., Fields, T. A., McKee, D. D., and Casey, P. J. (2001)Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 98, 519–524). This interaction causes β-catenin to release from cadherin and relocalize to the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it participates in transcriptional activation. Here we report that two distinct regions of the epithelial cadherin (E-cadherin) tail are required for interaction with β-catenin and Gα12, respectively. Deletion of an acidic, 19-amino acid region of E-cadherin abolishes its ability to bind β-catenin in vitro, to inhibit β-catenin-mediated transactivation, or to stabilize β-catenin; causes subcellular mislocalization of β-catenin; and disrupts cadherin-mediated cell adhesion. On the other hand, deletion of a distinct 11-amino acid region of E-cadherin dramatically attenuates interaction with Gα12; furthermore, Gα12 is ineffective in stimulating β-catenin release from an E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain lacking this putative Gα12-binding region. These findings indicate that Gα12 and β-catenin do not compete for the same binding site on cadherin and provide molecular targets for selectively disrupting the interaction of these proteins with cadherin.

G proteins are composed of two functional signaling units, a nucleotide-binding α subunit and a tightly coupled βγ subunit dimer. Based on the primary sequence of the α subunits, G proteins have been classified into four subfamilies: Gs, Gi, Gq, and G12(2Strathmann M.P. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Additionally, G12 subfamily members have been implicated in pathways controlling cell proliferation and early developmental events, as well as oncogenesis (9Offermanns S. Mancino V. Revel J.-P.

Recently, our laboratory reported a specific interaction between Gα12 and Gα13 and the cytoplasmic domain of several cadherins (17Meigs T.E. Fields T.A. McKee D.D. Casey P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 519-524PubMed Google Scholar), which are cell surface proteins involved in calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion (18Pötter E. Bergwitz C. Brabant G. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 207-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This interaction was shown to cause β-catenin, a multifunctional protein involved in both cell adhesion and transcriptional activation (19Provost E. Rimm D.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 567-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), to release from its cadherin-bound state and relocalize to the cytoplasm and nucleus. Furthermore, in cells deficient in β-catenin degradation, expression of Gα12 or Gα13 was found to up-regulate β-catenin-mediated transcriptional activation (17Meigs T.E. Fields T.A. McKee D.D. Casey P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 519-524PubMed Google Scholar). These findings have provided a mechanism that may explain the role of G12subfamily members in developmental processes as well as malignant transformation. Identifying the regions of the cadherin tail necessary for interaction with both Gα12 and β-catenin is critical for understanding the mechanism of Gα12-triggered release of β-catenin and for developing reagents to dissect the biological importance of the Gα12/cadherin interaction. In the present study, we undertook a systematic analysis to identify the regions of E-cadherin that are required for interaction with Gα12, and also expanded upon earlier studies by other researchers in which the region of cadherin critical for interaction with β-catenin was mapped. Our work demonstrates that distinct regions of the cadherin tail are required for interaction with Gα12 and with β-catenin and provides experimental systems that should allow dissection of the roles of these two key regulatory molecules in cadherin-mediated biological processes. The cDNAs for Gα12Q229L and GαzQ205L were a gift of Henry Bourne (University of California, San Francisco). The plasmid pXEH2, encoding the full-length cDNA for human E-cadherin, was a gift of Yutaka Shimoyama (National Okura Hospital, Okura, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo, Japan). The Gα12 baculovirus construct was provided by Alfred Gilman (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas). Baculovirus stock used for production of His-tagged β-catenin was from Barry Gumbiner (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center). Anti-Gα12 antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, anti-Gαz antibody has been previously described (20Casey P.J. Fong H.K. Simon M.I. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2383-2390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), anti-E-cadherin and anti-β-catenin antibodies were purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (S. San Francisco, CA), and anti-green fluorescence protein (GFP) antibody was purchased fromCLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). K562 human chronic myelogenous leukemia cells and SW480 human colorectal carcinoma cells were from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). L mouse fibroblast cells were provided by Karl Willert (Stanford University). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217507) Google Scholar) or by staining with Coomassie Blue using bovine serum albumin standards. cDNA corresponding to the 98 C-terminal amino acids of human E-cadherin was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Deletion mutants within the E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain were generated by a two-step PCR procedure using primers corresponding to the N- and C-terminal ends of the domain, which introduced BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites, respectively. For each mutant, these primers were used, along with internal primers flanking the region to be deleted, in two separate PCR reactions to amplify the N- and C-terminal regions of cDNA; products from the two reactions were then mixed and subjected to a second round of PCR using only the end primers. This reaction effectively “sewed” the N- and C-terminal regions together, producing constructs encoding the C-terminal domain of E-cadherin with the desired regions deleted. Constructs were then subcloned into pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ) for production as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins. Selected constructs were also subcloned into pEGFP-C (CLONTECH) for generation of fusions to GFP. Full-length E-cadΔβ-cat (full-length E-cadherin lacking residues 819–837) was produced by first subcloning the full open reading frame of E-cadherin from pXEH2 into pcDNA1.1/CAT (which lacks a BspHI site), producing the plasmid E-cad-pcDNA. The region of E-cadΔβ-cat containing the deleted residues was then excised from the corresponding GST construct (described above) via digestion with XhoI and BspHI and subcloned into E-cad-pcDNA that had been digested in the identical manner. Finally, the open reading frame encoding the full-length version of E-cadΔβ-cat was subcloned into pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) using the XbaI and EcoRV sites present in both the pcDNA1.1/CAT and pcDNA3.1 (+) vectors. Full-length wild-type E-cadherin was subcloned into pcDNA3.1(+) in a similar manner. All constructs were verified by sequencing. Recombinant Gα12 protein was produced in Sf9 cells as previously described (22Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1734-1741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). His-tagged β-catenin, produced in Sf9 cells and purified as previously described (23Fagotto F. Glück U. Gumbiner B.M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was a generous gift from Tim Fields (Duke University Medical Center). GST fusion proteins were produced in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) and purified from cell lysates using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Bound GST fusion protein was washed with buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 150 mm NaCl and then stored in the same buffer. Binding of Gα12 to GST-E-cadherin or GST-E-cadherin mutants was evaluated as described previously (17Meigs T.E. Fields T.A. McKee D.D. Casey P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 519-524PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 350 ng of purified Gα12 was incubated in buffer containing 10 μm GTPγS for 2 h at 30 °C, and the reaction was divided and then incubated with ∼1 μg of each glutathione Sepharose-bound GST fusion protein. Reactions were incubated with gentle agitation for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by pelleting of glutathione-Sepharose and extensive washing. Bound Gα12was eluted by heating for 10 min at 70 °C in Laemmli sample buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and subsequently analyzed by immunoblotting with 200 ng/ml Gα12 primary antibody followed by 200 ng/ml horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody. Binding of β-catenin (1 μg per reaction) to GST fusion proteins was evaluated in the same manner, except that the nucleotide-loading step was omitted. β-Catenin primary antibody was used at a concentration of 250 ng/ml followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody at a concentration of 200 ng/ml. SW480 cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). L cells, stably expressing full-length E-cadherin or the corresponding E-cadΔβ-cat, were selected in the same media supplemented with 1 mg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen), and clonal populations were isolated and maintained in the same medium containing 500 μg/ml Geneticin. K562 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Rockville, MD) supplemented with 10% FBS and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5). Transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol unless otherwise noted. For stable transfection of K562 cells, ∼10 × 106 cells were washed in RPMI 1640 medium to remove serum, combined with 30 μg of DNA encoding either full-length E-cadherin or the corresponding E-cadΔβ-cat, subjected to electroporation (340 V, 10 ms, 1 pulse, using a T820 square-wave electroporator (BTX, San Diego, CA)), and then plated in fresh medium. After 48 h, cells were seeded at varying dilutions into 96-well plates in the presence of 1 mg/ml Geneticin. After 2 weeks, plates with growth in <20% of wells were chosen, and wells were expanded and maintained in 500 μg/ml Geneticin. SW480 cells were transfected with the T cell factor (TCF) reporter construct TOPFLASH (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY), the control reporter construct pRL-TK (Promega, Madison, WI), and additional plasmids as indicated. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), lysed in Passive Lysis buffer (Promega), cleared by centrifugation, and assayed for protein. Lysates were analyzed using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay system (Promega), first for firefly (TOPFLASH) luciferase activity, followed by quenching and immediate measurement of Renilla (pRL-TK) luciferase activity. Luminometry was performed using either a Lumat LB-9501 (Berthold, Nashua, NH) or a TD-20/20 (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA) luminometer. L cells stably expressing full-length or mutant E-cadherin were grown on glass coverslips, washed with PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and incubated in blocking buffer (PBS containing 10% FBS and 0.2% saponin). Coverslips were incubated with 2.5–5 μg/ml primary antibody in blocking buffer, followed by three washes in PBS containing 10% FBS and subsequent incubation with 7–14 μg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) in blocking buffer. β-Catenin localization was observed using an LSM-410 laser scanning confocal microscope with a 63× oil immersion objective (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). A series of eight deletion mutants within the E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain, with each deleted region being defined by the primary sequence as proline-rich, serine-rich, acidic, basic, or mixed-charged (Fig.1), were constructed as fusions to GST. The fusion proteins were produced in a bacterial expression system, and the purified proteins evaluated in a cell-free system for their ability to interact with purified Gα12 and with purified β-catenin (Fig. 2). The wild-type E-cadherin cytoplasmic tail interacted with activated (GTPγS-loaded) Gα12 and with β-catenin (Fig. 2 C), as did six of the eight deletion mutants (data not shown). Deletion F, which lacks a highly charged region of 11 amino acids (Fig. 2 A), interacted poorly with Gα12 yet retained the ability to bind β-catenin (Fig. 2 C). Based on these results, deletion F will subsequently be referred to as E-cadΔG12 (Fig.2 A). Conversely, deletion D, which lacks a 19-amino acid stretch containing 5 acidic residues (Fig. 2 A), was completely unable to interact with β-catenin but maintained effective binding to Gα12 (Fig. 2 C). Thus, deletion D will subsequently be referred to as E-cadΔβ-cat (Fig.2 A). Unexpectedly, deletion E, which lacks a serine-rich region (Fig. 1) that was previously implicated as essential for β-catenin binding (24Stappert J. Kemler R. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1994; 2: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 25Lickert H. Bauer A. Kemler R. Stappert J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5090-5095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), bound to both β-catenin and Gα12 (Fig. 2 C); this finding will be discussed further below. The ability of each deletion mutant to bind at least one of the two proteins (Gα12 or β-catenin) diminishes the likelihood that these mutations produce misfolded proteins with a global loss of protein binding capacity. These data demonstrate that distinct regions of the cadherin cytoplasmic domain are required for interaction with Gα12 and β-catenin.Figure 2Gα12and β-catenin bind to distinct regions of the E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain. A, diagram highlighting regions of E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain absent in deletions (Del.) D–F. Amino acid sequence is shown for regions deleted in Del. D (E-cadΔβ-cat) and Del. F (E-cadΔG12). B, SDS-PAGE analysis of purified GST fusion proteins of the human E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain and specified deletion mutants (see “Experimental Procedures”). Bacterially produced proteins were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining; molecular mass standards (in kDa) are indicated on the left. Approximately 500 ng of protein was loaded in each lane. C, analysis of the interaction of the E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain and select deletion mutants with Gα12and with β-catenin. GST-E-Cad fusion proteins were incubated with purified Gα12 (loaded with GTPγS) or β-catenin protein (see “Experimental Procedures”). Bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and identified by immunoblot analysis using anti-Gα12 or anti-β-catenin antibody as indicated. Data are from a single experiment that is representative of six independent experiments. IB, immunoblot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Expression of the cytoplasmic domain of cadherins has been shown to attenuate β-catenin-mediated transcriptional activation, presumably by sequestering β-catenin and preventing its interaction with target transcription factors such as TCF or lymphoid enhancer factor (26Sadot E. Simcha I. Shtutman M. Ben-Ze'ev A. Geiger B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15339-15344Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). To determine whether the lack of interaction between β-catenin and E-cadΔβ-cat translates to functional changes within a cellular context, we fused the E-cadΔβ-cat construct to GFP, expressed this fusion protein in SW480 cells along with the TOPFLASH reporter plasmid, and measured β-catenin-mediated activation of the reporter gene. SW480 cells express a truncated form of the adenomatous polyposis coli protein that is unable to promote β-catenin degradation; this results in high levels of β-catenin and a robust β-catenin-mediated transactivation response in these cells. Consistent with previous results (17Meigs T.E. Fields T.A. McKee D.D. Casey P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 519-524PubMed Google Scholar, 26Sadot E. Simcha I. Shtutman M. Ben-Ze'ev A. Geiger B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15339-15344Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), we found that expression of a fusion between GFP and the wild-type E-cadherin tail significantly attenuated β-catenin-mediated transcriptional activation (Fig.3 A). However, the GFP-E-cadΔβ-cat fusion protein was without effect (Fig.3 A), indicating that deletion of the acidic region of the E-cadherin tail abolishes its ability to bind β-catenin in a cellular context. Formation of β-catenin/cadherin complexes has been demonstrated to stabilize β-catenin in cells by preventing its interaction with components required for its degradation (27Papkoff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4536-4543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Papkoff J. Rubinfeld B. Schryver B. Polakis P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2128-2134Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 29Salomon D. Sacco P.A. Roy S.G. Simcha I. Johnson K.R. Wheelock M.J. Ben-Ze'ev A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1325-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined the ability of both wild-type E-cadherin and E-cadΔβ-cat to protect β-catenin from degradation. Full-length E-cadherin or full-length E-cadΔβ-cat was stably expressed in K562 cells, which lack endogenous cadherins (30Ozawa M. Kemler R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6166-6170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), and lysates from these cells were analyzed by immunoblotting for E-cadherin and β-catenin. Although mock transfected K562 cells had very low levels of β-catenin (Fig.3 B), cells stably expressing wild-type E-cadherin exhibited a dramatic stabilization of endogenous β-catenin (Fig.3 B). In contrast, essentially no stabilization of β-catenin was observed in cells stably expressing full-length E-cadΔβ-cat (Fig. 3 B). In most cell types expressing cadherins, β-catenin is localized primarily at the cell periphery, whereas, in cells lacking cadherins, β-catenin is generally cytoplasmic or nuclear (31Peifer M. McCrea P.D. Green K.J. Wieschaus E. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 681-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 32Nathke I.S. Hinck L. Swedlow J.R. Papkoff J. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1341-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). We reasoned that a form of cadherin unable to bind β-catenin, such as E-cadΔβ-cat, should fail to promote peripheral localization of β-catenin. To test this hypothesis, we first examined the localization of β-catenin in L cells, which, like K562 cells, lack endogenous cadherins (30Ozawa M. Kemler R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6166-6170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). L cells are adherent and were used in place of K562 suspension cells to better facilitate growth on coverslips. Indirect immunofluorescence performed on these cells revealed a primarily cytoplasmic and nuclear staining pattern for endogenous β-catenin (Fig. 4 A). As expected, in L cells stably expressing wild-type E-cadherin, β-catenin was now found predominantly at the cell periphery (Fig.4 B). However, no relocalization of β-catenin was observed in L cells stably expressing E-cadΔβ-cat (Fig. 4 C); the staining pattern instead was similar to that observed in control L cells. Preincubation of primary antibody with purified β-catenin ablated the immunofluorescence signal, whereas preincubation with the irrelevant protein farnesyltransferase did not (data not shown). Having demonstrated that E-cadΔβ-cat is unable to functionally interact with β-catenin in vitro or in cells, we next evaluated the impact of loss of β-catenin binding on cadherin function. A primary biological function of cadherins is to mediate cell-cell adhesion through homophilic interaction between cadherins on adjacent cells. Although the extracellular domain of cadherins is directly involved in adhesion, cadherins lacking the cytoplasmic domain are unable to promote cell-cell interaction (33Kintner C. Cell. 1992; 69: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). To evaluate the importance of the region of E-cadherin we defined as essential for β-catenin binding for cell adhesion, we utilized K562 cells, which do not normally exhibit cell-cell adhesion (30Ozawa M. Kemler R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6166-6170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Stable expression of wild-type E-cadherin in these cells resulted in the formation of large aggregates of cells (Fig. 5 B). However, cells stably expressing equivalent levels (see Fig.5 D) of E-cadΔβ-cat showed no such aggregation (Fig.5 C) and were indistinguishable from control K562 cells (see Fig. 5 A). Taken together, these data clearly demonstrate that the 19-amino acid region deleted in E-cadΔβ-cat is essential for both β-catenin binding and for cadherin function. The absence of this domain abolishes the ability of the cadherin tail to inhibit β-catenin-mediated transactivation, eliminates cadherin's ability to localize and stabilize β-catenin, and disrupts cadherin-mediated cell adhesion. The inhibition of β-catenin-mediated transactivation resulting from expression of the GFP-E-cadherin tail (see Fig. 3 A) can be attenuated by co-expression of mutationally activated Gα12; this effect is thought to be due to Gα12 disrupting the interaction between β-catenin and the E-cadherin tail and thus freeing β-catenin to function as a transcriptional co-activator (17Meigs T.E. Fields T.A. McKee D.D. Casey P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 519-524PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, we hypothesized that the Gα12 binding region of cadherin identified by deletion analysis (see Fig. 2) should be required for Gα12 to elicit dissociation of β-catenin from the E-cadherin tail. To test this hypothesis, the E-cadΔG12cytoplasmic tail was fused to GFP, and this construct was transfected into SW480 cells along with the TOPFLASH reporter plasmid and different mutationally activated G proteins. Consistent with our previous study (17Meigs T.E. Fields T.A. McKee D.D. Casey P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 519-524PubMed Google Scholar), expression of activated Gα12 resulted in a significant increase in TOPFLASH reporter activity in cells expressing a GFP-wild-type E-cadherin tail fusion protein (Fig.6). However, activated Gα12was much less effective in stimulating β-catenin-mediated transactivation in cells expressing GFP-E-cadΔG12 (Fig.6). Expression of activated Gαz did not stimulate β-catenin-mediated reporter activation in the presence of either form of cadherin (Fig. 6). Our findings indicate that Gα12indeed requires the 11-amino acid region deleted in the E-cadΔG12 construct to effectively trigger β-catenin dissociation from cadherin. Inappropriate accumulation of β-catenin is believed to be a key event in the development of most colorectal tumors (34Polakis P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar), as well as a variety of other human cancers (35Polakis P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1837-1851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, the majority of epithelial tumors lose E-cadherin function as they progress to a malignant phenotype (36Christofori G. Semb H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 73-76Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Our recent finding, that G12 subfamily proteins interact with the cytoplasmic domain of cadherins in a fashion that stimulates the release of β-catenin, suggests that G12 subfamily members may be involved in β-catenin-mediated tumorigenesis (17Meigs T.E. Fields T.A. McKee D.D. Casey P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 519-524PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we have demonstrated that distinct domains of the E-cadherin tail are required for interaction with Gα12 and with β-catenin. The mutant E-cadherin molecules generated in this study should be of great utility for dissecting the roles of Gα12 and β-catenin in cadherin-mediated functions. Since the discovery that the cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin is required for cell-cell adhesion (37Nagafuchi A. Takeichi M. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3679-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar) and the identification of β-catenin as a protein associated with the cadherin cytoplasmic domain (38Ozawa M. Baribault H. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1711-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar), numerous studies have analyzed the cadherin cytoplasmic domain to identify the region to which β-catenin binds. Early studies demonstrated that deletion of the 72 C-terminal residues of E-cadherin abolished interaction with β-catenin (37Nagafuchi A. Takeichi M. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3679-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar, 38Ozawa M. Baribault H. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1711-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar, 39Nagafuchi A. Takeichi M. Cell Regul. 1989; 1: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 40Ozawa M. Ringwald M. Kemler R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4246-4250Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Stappert and Kemler (24Stappert J. Kemler R. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1994; 2: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) later demonstrated that the mutation of eight serines to alanines between residues 838 and 853 of E-cadherin abolished interaction with β-catenin, as determined by co-immunoprecipitation. Conversely, a study by Jou et al. (41Jou T.-Z. Stewart D.B. Stappert J. Nelson W.J. Marrs J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5067-5071Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) presented data indicating that deletion of a 25-residue acidic region, corresponding to amino acids 815–839 of human E-cadherin, eliminated the ability of β-catenin to interact with E-cadherin in a yeast two-hybrid system. Near the completion of our study, the crystal structure of the murine β-catenin/E-cadherin complex was reported (42Huber A.H. Weis W.I. Cell. 2001; 105: 392-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (615) Google Scholar). The crystal structure indicates that E-cadherin binds to β-catenin as an extended polypeptide with as many as 100 residues of the E-cadherin tail interacting with β-catenin (42Huber A.H. Weis W.I. Cell. 2001; 105: 392-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (615) Google Scholar). However, the authors concluded that 18 residues of the cadherin cytoplasmic tail form a “core” binding region that is essential for interaction with β-catenin, whereas the other residues involved in the extended interface serve to modulate the affinity of the interaction between the two proteins. The core domain identified in the crystal structure corresponds to amino acids 821–838 of human E-cadherin, which is nearly identical to the 19 residue acidic region (amino acids 819–837) we identified as essential for interaction with β-catenin in the current study. Thus, our results support the conclusion from the structural study that the core β-catenin-binding region of cadherin is essential for the biologically functional interaction between cadherin and β-catenin. The β-catenin/E-cadherin crystal structure was solved with both unphosphorylated and phosphorylated E-cadherin. The authors of the study found that the serine-rich region of the E-cadherin tail, corresponding to residues 838–853 of human E-cadherin, interacted with β-catenin only when phosphorylated. This finding provides an explanation for earlier reports demonstrating that phosphorylation of serine residues in this region of cadherin increases the affinity of its interaction with β-catenin (25Lickert H. Bauer A. Kemler R. Stappert J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5090-5095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 43Serres M. Filhol O. Lickert H. Grangeasse C. Chambaz E.M. Stappert J. Vincent C. Schmitt D. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 257: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The structural data suggest that, although the serine-rich region is involved in modulating the affinity of the interaction between the two proteins, it is not essential for the interaction to occur. Our finding that E-cadherin missing this precise serine-rich region (deletion E, see Fig. 1) still binds effectively to β-catenin (Fig. 2 C) supports this conclusion. Another very recent study reported identification of a minimal region of the Drosophila E-cadherin cytoplasmic tail that was able to interact with β-catenin (44Simcha I. Kirkpatrick C. Sadot E. Shtutman M. Polevoy G. Geiger B. Peifer M. Ben-Ze'ev A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1177-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This analysis found that a polypeptide encoding as few as 23 residues of the DrosophilaE-cadherin tail could bind to β-catenin in a yeast two-hybrid system; this 23-residue region corresponds to amino acids 828–850 of the human E-cadherin tail. This region overlaps substantially with the domains identified as essential for β-catenin binding in both the present study and the structural study noted above, although only about half the residues in this region are conserved from fly to mammals. The present study validates the Gα12/cadherin interaction as a key event leading to destabilization of the cadherin/β-catenin complex in cells. Identification of residues 854–864 of human E-cadherin as critical for its interaction with Gα12allowed testing of the hypothesis that this interaction leads to release of β-catenin from the E-cadherin tail (see Fig. 6). In the β-catenin/E-cadherin crystal structure, these residues of E-cadherin are seen to form part of a cap that protects hydrophobic residues of the first armadillo repeat region of β-catenin from solvent exposure (42Huber A.H. Weis W.I. Cell. 2001; 105: 392-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Earlier studies have reported that deletion of the cap region reduces interaction of E-cadherin with β-catenin (45Finnemann S. Mitrik I. Hess M. Otto G. Wedlich D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11856-11862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 24Stappert J. Kemler R. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1994; 2: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). However, because robust binding to β-catenin was still observed when the N- or C-terminal half of the E-cadherin cap region was deleted (see “Results”), it is unlikely that disruption of the interaction between the hydrophobic cap of cadherin and β-catenin could account for the ability of Gα12 to stimulate β-catenin release from cadherin. Rather, we would speculate that binding of Gα12 to cadherin disrupts additional regions involved in formation of the β-catenin/cadherin complex, which likely include interactions involving the acidic core region of cadherin that is essential for β-catenin binding. An intriguing study that may shed light on additional mechanisms by which G12 subfamily members can affect β-catenin signaling was recently reported by Fujino et al. (46Fujino H. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12489-12492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). They demonstrated that stimulation of FPB prostanoid receptors, which are G protein-coupled receptors thought to signal at least in part through G12 and G13 proteins (47Pierce K.L. Fujino H. Srinivasan D. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35944-35949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), leads to activation of a β-catenin/TCF signaling pathway, thereby providing additional evidence of a link between heterotrimeric G proteins and β-catenin signaling. The specific mechanism by which Gα12 stimulates β-catenin release is not yet apparent, but our data clearly demonstrate that these two proteins bind to distinct regions of the cadherin tail. Therefore, a simple competition model cannot adequately explain Gα12-stimulated β-catenin release, and the possibility exists that additional proteins may be involved in this process. We are currently attempting to identify such proteins to investigate whether G12 subfamily members may serve to recruit them to the cadherin/β-catenin complex.

There are also reports of dihydrolipoic acid acting as a pro-oxidant under certain circumstances. This article reports the direct observation by ESR spectrometry of the disulfide radical anion and the spin trapping of the primary thiyl radical formed from the oxidation of dihydrolipoic acid through thiol pumping with phenol and horseradish peroxidase. The disulfide radical anion reacts rapidly with oxygen to form the reactive radical superoxide, which is also trapped. The radical species formed show a potential for pro-oxidant activity of this compound. Although antioxidants, in general, have been shown to have pro-oxidant potential, the pro-oxidant chemistry of dihydrolipoic acid has not been well characterized.

It is possible to initiate this oxidation through a process referred to as “thiol pumping” in which a compound, typically a phenol, is metabolized to a reactive free radical by one of a number of peroxidase enzymes, and the radicals so formed are reduced by a thiol, forming a very reactive thiyl radical (29Schreiber J.

Chem. 1990; 265: 844-847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Investigators have, until now, been unable to detect sulfur-centered radicals from dihydrolipoic acid in such a system (31Goldman R. Stoyanovsky D.A. Day B.W. Kagan V.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4765-4772Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 33Stoyanovsky D.A. Goldman R. Claycamp H.G. Kagan V.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 317: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) although superoxide production and cycling of the phenoxyl radical back to phenol indicate that the dihydrolipoic acid is being oxidized. There was also a failure to detect the thiyl radical when dihydrolipoic acid reduced met-myoglobin to oxy-myoglobin (37Romero F.J. Ordonez I. Arduini A. Cadenas E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1680-1688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a situation in which one would expect the radical to be formed. This article reports the first direct observation of both the disulfide radical anion and the thiyl radical from dihydrolipoic acid in a thiol-pumping experiment. Dihydrolipoic acid, horseradish peroxidase type I, 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO),12-methyl-2-nitrosopropane, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, dithiothreitol, and diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) were all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The DMPO was vacuum-distilled and stored under nitrogen at −70 °C. Phenol (redistilled, ultrapure) was purchased from ICN and used without further purification. Hydrogen peroxide was purchased from Fisher Scientific. Oxygen uptake measurements were made on an YSI model 53 oxygen monitor using a water-jacketed reaction vessel and a Clark electrode. Measurements were begun by putting buffered solutions of dihydrolipoic acid and phenol in the sample well. After 1 min HRP was added, and after another minute hydrogen peroxide was added. All ESR experiments were carried out on a Bruker ElexSys E 500 ESR spectrometer equipped with a Bruker SHQ cavity operating at 9.79 GHz. Fast flow experiments used a mixing quartz flat cell from Willmad. Two reservoirs were used to supply the solutions to the flat cell. One reservoir contained thiol and horseradish peroxidase in buffer and the other contained phenol and hydrogen peroxide in buffer. Freshly made solutions were purged of air by bubbling with nitrogen or argon gas, which was then used to pressurize both reservoirs to force solutions through the flow cell. The flow was controlled with Gilmont Instrument flow meters. At low flow rates (less than 3 ml/min) a syringe pump was used to mix the two solutions in a high-pressure liquid chromatographic static mixing tee just before entrance to a flat cell. The solutions were purged with nitrogen before loading the syringes. Polyethylene tubing was used to connect the syringes with the mixing tee and the flat cell. Aerobic spin-trapping experiments were performed by mixing all components (dissolved in appropriate buffer) of the sample and transferring to a flat cell. The first scan was begun within 30 s of mixing. Anoxic spin-trapping experiments were performed by bubbling the solution of thiol, phenol, HRP, and spin trap with nitrogen for at least 5 min. Hydrogen peroxide was added and the sample aspirated immediately into the flat cell. Measurements were begun within 15 s of mixing. Specific ESR spectrometer settings are given in the figure captions. Simulations of ESR spectra were performed using the computer program WINSIM developed in this laboratory (38Duling D.R. J. Mag. Res. Series B. 1994; 104: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar) and available at the website epr.niehs.nih.gov/. The g-value measurements for the disulfide radical anions were determined using the phenoxyl radical from phenol (g = 2.005) as a secondary standard (39Wertz J.E. Bolton J.R. Electron Spin Resonance: Elementary Theory and Practical Applications. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York1972: 464-465Google Scholar). For experiments at pH 7.4, a 100 mmphosphate buffer was used. This buffer was chelexed overnight and 100 μm DTPA added as a trace transition metal chelator to suppress thiol autoxidation. At pH 8.0 and higher, a 100 mmborate buffer was used. For all experiments stock solutions of the reagents were made using the appropriate buffer. The neutral phenoxyl radical formed from the oxidation of phenol by horseradish peroxidase and hydrogen peroxide was used to produce the disulfide radical anion from dihydrolipoic acid through a process referred to as thiol pumping. The ESR spectrum of the disulfide radical anion from dihydrolipoic acid is shown in Fig.1 A. The spectrum is identical to that assigned by Gilbert et al. (23Gilbert B.C. Laue H.A.H. Norman R.O.C. Sealy R.C. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1975; II: 892-900Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar) to the dihydrolipoic acid radical anion (Table I). The relatively high g value of 2.013 is consistent with a sulfur-centered species. The right side of the spectrum in Fig.1 B, and to a much lesser extent in Fig. 1 A, shows lines from the phenoxyl radical and from a broader signal that is apparently due to polymeric radicals formed from phenol oxidation. The same ESR spectrum was observed using acetaminophen rather than phenol to pump the thiol (data not shown). Only the phenol experiments are reported here because polymer radical formation was much worse in the case of acetaminophen. Free radical formation was totally dependent on phenol (Fig. 1 C), HRP (Fig. 1 D), and hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 1 E).Table IHyperfine coupling constantsRadicalCoupling constants in Gauss (this work)Literature valuesRef.DMPO/⋅SlipoateaN= 15.25Similar to DMPO/⋅SG from glutathione41Mottley C.

This is the first report of the direct observance of this radical in an enzymatic system. In the middle of the phenoxyl radical spectrum, a broad peak due to phenol-derived polymeric radical is beginning to form. The polymeric material sticks to the surface of the flat cell and soon overwhelms any fine structure. When dihydrolipoic acid was included in the reaction mixture, the polymeric radical formed at a much decreased rate. Fig. 3 shows the ESR spectra of the disulfide radical anion from dihydrolipoic acid at pH 7.4 and 9.0. Thearrow indicates the center of the residual phenoxyl radical spectrum. The disulfide radical anion spectrum was shifted to a lower magnetic field compared with the phenoxyl radical spectrum because of the higher g value. The spectra are the same although the signal intensity is much larger at pH 9.0, indicating either a higher radical stability or a greater rate of radical formation or both. While a single species simulation (shown as a dotted line in Fig. 3) fits quite well in the wings of the spectrum, there is too much intensity in the middle of the simulation, which leads us to believe that there are at least two species of radicals contributing to the observed spectra. The dashed line is the simulated spectrum for two slowly exchanging conformations with very similar hyperfine coupling constants, which could arise from two different conformations of the five-membered ring. This two-species simulation fits the experimental spectrum much better than the single-species simulation. In an attempt to understand the dihydrolipoic spectra, we performed similar experiments with dithiothreitol as a model compound. Dithiothreitol is a more symmetrical molecule, and its oxidation chemistry has been extensively investigated (21Chan P.C. Bielski B.H.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1973; 95: 5504-5508Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 22Redpath J.L. Rad. Res. 1973; 54: 364-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 24Elliot A.J. Sopchyshyn F.C. Radiat. Phys.

Schuchmann H-P. von Sonntag C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 5735-5739Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Dithiothreitol gave a much more intense ESR spectrum than dihydrolipoic acid. Fig. 4 shows the ESR spectra of the disulfide radical anion from dithiothreitol as a function of pH value. A simulated spectrum is shown as a dashed line superimposed on each experimental spectrum. The fit of the simulated spectrum to experimental is extremely good, so it is very difficult to distinguish the dashed line. There are two species with their relative concentrations depending on pH value. The simulated spectra of the two species are shown in Fig. 4, E and F. The hyperfine coupling constants are found in Table I and the isotropic g value for both species is 2.013. To try to observe the primary thiyl radical, which cannot be directly detected in solution, we performed spin-trapping experiments using DMPO, a nitrone spin trap. Fig. 5 shows the results of the spin-trapping experiment. Fig. 5 A is the spectrum of the full system in air. The simulated spectrum shown in Fig. 5 B is a mixture of DMPO/⋅Slipoate, DMPO/⋅OH, DMPO/⋅OOH, and DMPO/carbon-centered radical as indicated in the figure legend. The simulated spectrum of each species is shown separately in Fig. 5. The hyperfine coupling constants and relevant literature values are given in Table I. Fig.6 A is the spectrum of the complete system with the simulated spectrum superimposed. The fit between the simulated and the experimental spectra is quite good so that they are hard to distinguish in the figure. Fig. 6,B-E, shows that the ESR signal is enzyme- and substrate-dependent. The addition of SOD to the incubation suppresses the radical adducts DMPO/⋅OH and DMPO/⋅OOH as seen in Fig. 6 F. The dashed line is the sum of the DMPO/⋅Slipoate and the DMPO/carbon-centered radical adducts. The identity of the carbon-centered radical is unknown. An unsuccessful attempt was made to trap the carbon-centered radical with the spin trap 2-methyl-2-nitrosopropane.Figure 6Spin trapping in the aerobic dihydrolipoate system.

This radical adduct has coupling constants very similar to those of the DMPO thiyl adduct formed from glutathione (Table I). The reactions, both aerobic and anoxic, are enzymatic and depend on the presence of phenol as demonstrated by the control experiments in each case. Oxygen-uptake measurements shown in Fig.8 show that DMPO does not break the chain reaction responsible for the disappearance of oxygen. Higher concentrations of hydrogen peroxide did not change the rate of oxygen disappearance, but did increase the total oxygen uptake (data not shown). The addition of SOD slightly increased the rate of oxygen uptake and increased the total amount of oxygen consumed. When SOD was added before HRP, the oxygen uptake with no exogenous H2O2 added was at least double that found in incubations with no SOD, and the oxygen uptake upon addition of H2O2 was several times the concentration of the H2O2 added (data not shown). Catalase produced oxygen from the hydrogen peroxide present and inhibited the reaction. The formation of the thiol radical trapped by DMPO (Figs. 5 and 6) can be explained through thiol pumping by the phenol radical formed via oxidation of phenol by the HRP/H2O2 peroxidase system. The chemical reactions involved are shown in SchemeFS1. It has been reported that the thiyl radical from dihydrolipoic acid was not trapped in this system (31Goldman R. Stoyanovsky D.A. Day B.W. Kagan V.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4765-4772Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 33Stoyanovsky D.A. Goldman R. Claycamp H.G. Kagan V.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 317: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), but that is clearly not the case under our conditions as seen in Figs. Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7. Under anaerobic conditions, a strong DMPO/⋅Slipoate adduct spectrum is seen and, under aerobic conditions, the DMPO/⋅Slipoate adduct is observed along with several other species. In the presence of SOD in the aerobic system, the DMPO/⋅Slipoate adduct is the predominant species. When the system was observed using fast-flow conditions, the disulfide radical anion was observed directly as shown in Figs. 1, 3, and 4. The spectrum of the dihydrolipoic acid-derived disulfide radical anion has been assigned by Gilbert et al. (23Gilbert B.C. Laue H.A.H. Norman R.O.C. Sealy R.C. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1975; II: 892-900Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The simulation of this spectrum fits very well everywhere except in the center, which leads us to believe that there are two species present. We tried varying the pH to see if we could change the relative concentration of the two species. As shown in Fig. 3, the only effect of pH was that the signal was more intense at higher pH. When we varied the pH in the dithiothreitol system, the ESR spectrum changed dramatically as seen in Fig. 4. The observed spectra can be explained using the mechanism proposed by Akhlaq and Sonntag (25Akhlaq M.S. von Sonntag C. Z. Naturforsch. Sect. C Biosci. 1987; 42: 134-140Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and shown in Scheme FS2. The pK a for reaction 2 is 5.2 (22Redpath J.L. Rad. Res. 1973; 54: 364-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 25Akhlaq M.S. von Sonntag C. Z. Naturforsch. Sect. C Biosci. 1987; 42: 134-140Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar), which means, in our system, virtually any cyclic radical which forms will deprotonate to form the cyclic dithiol radical anion. The key reaction to the pH-dependence of the ESR spectra is reaction 3 (Scheme FS2), which depends on having the thiol anion present so that the intermolecular reaction can occur. This depends on the equilibrium, HSRRSH⇆HSRRS−+H+Eq. 1 For dithiothreitol, the pK a of the above reaction is 9.12 (25Akhlaq M.S. von Sonntag C. Z. Naturforsch. Sect. C Biosci. 1987; 42: 134-140Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The second pK a is 10.15 (25Akhlaq M.S. von Sonntag C. Z. Naturforsch. Sect. C Biosci. 1987; 42: 134-140Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This means that at pH 9, about half of the dithiothreitol molecules have one thiol group deprotonated and, since reaction 3 is much faster than 1, the linear product is observed. At pH 7.4, only about 2.5% of the molecules have one thiol group deprotonated. Reactions 1 and 2 outcompete reaction 3 (Scheme FS2), and the cyclic radical is predominant (Fig. 4 A). It should be possible to change the relative amounts of linear and cyclic radical by increasing or decreasing the dithiothreitol concentration. Indeed, this concentration-dependent preference for linear over cyclic disulfide radical anion has been observed in the photolysis of 1,4-butanedithiol (40Cremonini M.A. Lunazzi L. Placucci G. J. Org. Chem. 1993; 58: 3805-3810Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, over the relatively small dithiol concentration range where the radical could be detected, only a very small change could be observed, although the change was in the right direction (data not shown). The dihydrolipoic acid ESR spectrum is essentially pH-independent because the first pKa for this dithiol is 10.7, which means that at pH 9 only about 2% of the molecules have one thiol group deprotonated. Without the deprotonated thiol, the linear radical cannot form. Therefore, a contribution from a linear species cannot be the cause of the decrease in the intensity in the center of the spectrum over what is predicted by the one-species simulation. It is possible that there are two conformations of the cyclic radical formed, which would have very similar hyperfine coupling constants. Indeed, when we include two species, the simulation is greatly improved as can be seen in Fig. 3 B. The single large hyperfine coupling must arise from the lone hydrogen β to the internal sulfhydral group (Table I). In addition to the thiyl radical (38%), superoxide radical anion (37%) and hydroxyl radical (18%) were trapped with DMPO in the aerobic spin-trapping experiments as shown in Figs. 5 and 6. The oxygen species have also been reported in this system by Stoyanovsky et al. (33Stoyanovsky D.A. Goldman R. Claycamp H.G. Kagan V.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 317: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and Goldman et al. (31Goldman R. Stoyanovsky D.A. Day B.W. Kagan V.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4765-4772Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) although the thiyl radical adduct was not detected. The oxygen-centered species did not appear in the presence of SOD. It is well known that the oxidation of thiols via thiyl radicals produces superoxide. There is a small amount (5%) of carbon-centered radical DMPO adduct observable in the aerobic system spectrum (Figs. 5 and 6). This species becomes much more obvious when SOD is included in the reaction mixture. The source of this radical is unknown, but there is a report of glutathione thiyl radical spontaneously transforming into a carbon-centered radical (26Grierson L. Hildenbrand K. Bothe E. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1992; 62: 265-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). It may be that we are observing the same type of rearrangement in dihydrolipoic acid. The oxygen uptake measurements (Fig. 8) show that hydrogen peroxide is required for the oxidation process (addition of catalase produces oxygen and stops the reaction). Horseradish peroxidase was required for detectable oxygen consumption, implying autoxidation of dihydrolipoic acid was relatively slow. DMPO has little, if any, effect on the oxygen uptake, implying that thiyl radical trapping by DMPO is much slower than disulfide anion radical formation, which leads to oxygen consumption through superoxide formation. Additional hydrogen peroxide does not change the rate of oxygen uptake, but increases the total amount of oxygen removed (data not shown), which indicates that the reaction is hydrogen peroxide-limited. The increase in oxygen consumption on the addition of SOD has also been observed in a similar system in which glutathione was oxidized by tyrosyl radicals produced by oxidizing tyrosine with horseradish peroxidase and hydrogen peroxide (32Pichorner H. Metodiewa D. Winterbourn C.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 323: 429-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The increase in oxygen uptake in the presence of SOD could imply the formation of Compound III through the interaction of the ferric HRP enzyme and superoxide. Visible spectroscopy experiments attempting to observe Compound III were not successful (data not shown). The oxygen consumption in the presence of SOD can be explained using the mechanism proposed by Pichorner et al. (32Pichorner H. Metodiewa D. Winterbourn C.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 323: 429-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) for the scavenging of tyrosyl radicals by reduced glutathione. That mechanism, in terms of our reactants, includes the following reactions, 2Phenol+H2O2→2PhO⋅+H2OREACTION 1 PhO⋅+HSRSH→Phenol+HSRS⋅REACTION 2 REACTION3 REACTION4 2O⨪2+2H+→O2+H2O2 REACTION5HSRSH represents dihydrolipoic acid in the reactions above. The superoxide may undergo a number of possible reactions with the phenoxyl radical and with the thiol as well as with itself (dismutation, reaction 5). The reactions with the phenoxyl radical and the thiol are not included in this mechanism because we have no evidence for any of the products produced. When SOD is present in the reaction, it catalyzes reaction 5, which results in the replenishing of H2O2. The sum of reactions 4 and 5 (as would occur in the presence of SOD), REACTION6results in oxygen consumption and the production of hydrogen peroxide so that the overall reaction will run until all oxygen is consumed. In the absence of SOD, reaction 5 occurs slower relative to other reactions of superoxide, which do not form hydrogen peroxide. In the presence of catalase, hydrogen peroxide (used in reaction 1) is destroyed, producing oxygen and terminating the reaction. The formation of the thiyl radical and the disulfide radical anion from dihydrolipoic acid means that this compound may act as a pro-oxidant under the right conditions. The generation of superoxide is a cause of concern when using the compound in any therapeutic manner. While lipoic acid and dihydrolipoic acid may have good antioxidant properties, the effects of dihydrolipoic acid in any system must be seen as a balance between its pro- and antioxidant properties."

We have previously identified a distal element (DE), located ∼1100 nucleotides upstream from the initiation site of sg mRNA2 transcription, part of which must base pair with a portion of a core element (CE), located just 5′ to the initiation site, for efficient transcription to occur (Zhang, G., Slowinski, V., and White, K.

Seron K. Haenni A. Bernardi F. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 367-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, this coding strategy poses a problem for translation of sequentially encoded open reading frames (ORFs)1 within these genomes. The difficulty arises due to the 5′ to 3′ and linear nature of conventional ribosome scanning, which generally allows for only the first ORF encoded in a message to be translated efficiently (2Kozak M. Cell. 1978; 15: 1109-1123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). A coping strategy used commonly by a wide variety of (+)-strand RNA viruses is to synthesize smaller viral mRNAs via RNA-templated transcription (3Miller W.A. Koev G. Virology. 2000; 273: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). These so-called subgenomic (sg) mRNAs represent 5′-truncated 3′-coterminal copies of the genome that permit efficient translation of their most 5′-proximal ORFs (3Miller W.A. Koev G. Virology. 2000; 273: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). There is compelling evidence for two distinct mechanisms for the transcription of sg mRNAs. The first mechanism, which has been studied most extensively in Brome mosaic virus, involves the initiation of transcription at a localized internal promoter within the full-length (−)-strand of the genome (4Miller W.A. Dreher T.W. Hall T.C. Nature. 1985; 313: 68-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 5Siegel R.W. Adkins S. Kao C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11238-11243Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The second defined mechanism, which occurs in the arteriviruses, involves the discontinuous synthesis of (−)-strands that are then used as templates in the production of sg mRNAs, which include a portion of the 5′-untranslated region of the genome (6Pasternak A.O. Gultyaev A.P. Spaan W.J. Snijder E.J. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 11642-11653Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 7van Marle G. Dobbe J.C. Gultyaev A.P. Luytjes W. Spaan W.J. Snijder E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12056-12061Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). A third mechanism that has been proposed is that of premature termination of (−)-strand synthesis during the copying of the genome and subsequent use of the 3′-truncated product as a template for the transcription of sg mRNAs (8Zhong W. Rueckert R.R. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2716-2722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Miller W.A. Brown C.M. Wang S. Semin. Virol. 1997; 8: 3-13Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 10Sit T.L. Vaewhongs A.A. Lommel S.A. Science. 1998; 281: 829-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Although there is no compelling experimental evidence validating this latter model, it is supported indirectly by the observation that (−)-strand sg mRNAs do accumulate in various (+)-strand RNA viral infections (8Zhong W. Rueckert R.R. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2716-2722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Chapman S. Hills G. Watts J. Baulcombe D.

However, the origin and function of these (−)-strand sg mRNAs remain to be determined. Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) is the prototype member of the family Tombusviridae (14Hearne P.Q. Knorr D.A. Hillman B.I. Morris T.J. Virology. 1990; 177: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Its (+)-strand RNA genome is 4.8 kilobases in length and encodes five functional ORFs (see Fig.1 A). The 5′-terminally encoded p33 and its readthrough product p92 are the only viral proteins required for viral RNA synthesis, and both are translated directly from the viral genome (15Oster S.K. Wu B. White K.A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 5845-5851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The three ORFs encoded more 3′ in the genome are involved in viral assembly, movement, and suppression of host defense mechanisms and are translated from two sg mRNAs that are synthesized during infections (Fig. 1 A) (16Scholthof H.B. Scholthof K.B. Kikkert M. Jackson A.O. Virology. 1995; 213: 425-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 17Voinnet O. Pinto Y.M. Baulcombe D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14147-14152Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). RNA sequence elements within the genome that are required for transcription of the smaller sg mRNA2 have been identified previously (18Zhang G. Slowinski V. White K.A. RNA. 1999; 5: 550-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 19Johnson J.C. Rochon D.M. Virology. 1995; 214: 100-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Efficient transcription of this message requires sequences both at the site of initiation, termed the core element (CE), as well as sequences some ∼1100 nucleotides (nt) upstream from the start site, termed the distal element (DE) (Fig.1 A). The DE and CE can each be divided further into subelements A, B, and C based on their relative positions and/or structural properties. The sequence of the CE-C subelement is highly conserved within tombusvirus genomes and is located just 5′ to the sg mRNA2 initiation site (Fig. 1 C) (18Zhang G. Slowinski V. White K.A. RNA. 1999; 5: 550-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The DE-C element is not well conserved within the genus Tombusvirus and displays no significant complementarity to CE-C. In contrast, the DE-A and CE-A subelements and the DE-B and CE-B subelements are complementary to each other, and previous studies have provided compelling evidence that base pairing of the former pair is required for efficient sg mRNA2 synthesis (Fig. 1, B and C) (18Zhang G. Slowinski V. White K.A. RNA. 1999; 5: 550-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). A functional role for the DE-A/CE-A base-pairing interaction was supported by comparative sequence analysis of tombusvirus genomes as well as deletion and compensatory-type mutational analyses (18Zhang G. Slowinski V. White K.A. RNA. 1999; 5: 550-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Interestingly, long distance base-pairing interactions have also been found to be important for sg mRNA transcription in the unrelated virus Potato virus X. (20Kim K.H. Hemenway C.L. Virology. 1997; 232: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar,21Kim K.H. Hemenway C.L. RNA. 1999; 5: 636-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This suggests that long range RNA interactions involved in regulating sg mRNAs may be a common feature in diverse groups of (+)-strand RNA viruses. However, the functions of these far-spanning interactions may be quite different within the unique contexts of these distinct viral genomes. In a previous study we confirmed the functional requirement for the DE-A/CE-A base-pairing interaction (18Zhang G. Slowinski V. White K.A. RNA. 1999; 5: 550-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar); however, these analyses did not determine whether this interaction occurred in the (+)- or (−)-strand of the genome nor did they investigate the specific role of the interaction in sg mRNA2 transcription. To address these questions and to determine the possible roles of other yet uncharacterized subelements, we have carried out additional analyses of the DE and CE. Our results indicate that the DE-A/CE-A base-pairing interaction is functional in the (+)-strand and that the DE-C and CE-C subelements represent newly defined components that are important and essential, respectively, for efficient sg mRNA transcription. Additionally, by localizing both the DE and CE at different positions within the genome, we have deduced that the likely function of the DE-A/CE-A interaction is to position other subelements optimally. Furthermore, mutational analysis of the initiating nucleotide for sg mRNA2 transcription has provided clues to the origin of (−)-strand sg mRNAs and, together with other results, provided important new insight into the mechanism of sg mRNA2 transcription. The plasmid T-100, containing a full-length cDNA copy of the wild type (WT) TBSV genome, has been described previously (14Hearne P.Q. Knorr D.A. Hillman B.I. Morris T.J. Virology. 1990; 177: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Construction of mutant derivatives of T-100 containing modifications to the DE and/or CE (i.e. Psg20/26 and ΔPsg1) have also been described (18Zhang G. Slowinski V. White K.A. RNA. 1999; 5: 550-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). All mutant viral constructs used in this study were generated by standard recombinant DNA cloning techniques and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based oligonucleotide-mediated mutagenesis (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and are derivatives of the previously described constructs pT-100, Psg20/26, or ΔPsg1. Additionally, new mutant constructs were sequenced across all PCR-derived regions to confirm that only the desired modifications were present. Mutants Psg20/26m1 through Psg20/26m6, as well as Psg20/26m1/4, Psg20/26m2/5, and Psg20/26m3/6, were derivatives of Psg20/26 (18Zhang G. Slowinski V. White K.A. RNA. 1999; 5: 550-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). For Psg20/26m1 through Psg20/26m3, primer pairs PM9 (5′-CAACGTATTGACACGGTCACAAATGTGCACAAGTGG) and PM10 (5′-CCAACCGGTTCTAGAGTCTATCCCGCGTGTGTGTATTCTTGGTC), PM11 (5′-CCAACCGGTTCTAGAGTCCATCCCGCGTGTGTGTATTCTTGGTC), or PM12 (5′-CCACCGGTTCTAGAGTCCACCCCGCGTGTGTGTATTCTTGGTC), respectively, were used to generate PCR products containing the desired modifications (see Fig. 2 A). The products were digested with BamHI and XbaI and used to replace the corresponding segment in Psg20/26. For Psg20/26m4 through Psg20/26m6, primer pairs PB30 (5′-CTTGATTCGAATTCGTCTCATCG) and PM13 (5′-GCCCCCACCGGTCTGCAGCTCTAATTTAGTGTGTCCCGCGAGGGGCCTCTTG), PM14 (5′-GCCCCCACCGGTCTGCAGCTCTAATTTAGTGCGTCCCGCGAGGGGCCTCTTG), or PM15 (5′-GCCCCCACCGGTCTGCAGCTCTAATTTAGTGCGCCCCGCGAGGGGCCTCTTG), respectively, were used to generate PCR products containing the desired modifications (see Fig. 2 A). The products were digested with PstI and EcoRI and used to replace the corresponding segment in Psg20/26. The constructs Psg20/26m1/4, Psg20/26m2/5, and Psg20/26m3/6 were generated by combining the mutations in Psg20/26m1 through Psg20/26m3 with those present in Psg20/26m4 through Psg20/26m6, respectively. This was accomplished by replacing the XbaI/SphI fragment in Psg20/26m1 through Psg20/26m3 with the corresponding fragments from Psg20/26m4 through Psg20/26m6, respectively. All mutants described differ in structure from Psg20/26 (18Zhang G. Slowinski V. White K.A. RNA. 1999; 5: 550-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) only by the substitutions indicated in Fig. 2 A. The mutants Psg55C, Psg36C, Psg51C, Psg56C, and Psg50C, in which the DE was repositioned adjacent to the natural CE position, were all derivatives of ΔPsg1 (18Zhang G. Slowinski V. White K.A. RNA. 1999; 5: 550-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The strategy used was to generate PCR products using primer pairs PB30 and PG55 (5′-GCCCCCACCGGTCTGCAGGACCAAGAATACACACACGCAGGATAGACACATGGCAATGGTAAAGAGAAACAACAACATCTAGAAATGATGTTTCTCTAATTTAGTGTG), PG36 (5′-GCCCCCACCGGTCTGCAGCACGCAGGATAGACACATGGCAATGGTAAAG-AGAAACAACAACATCTAGAAATGATGTTTCTCTAATTTAGTGTG), PG51 (5′-GCCCCCACCGGTCTGCAGGACCAAGAATACACACACGCAGGATAGACTCTAGAGTGTGTCCTGCGAGGGGCCTCTG), PG56 (5′-GCCCCCACCGGTCTGCAGCACGCAGGATAGACTCTAGAGTGTGTCCTGCGAGGGGCCTCTTG), or PG50 (5′-GCCCCCACCGGTCTGCAGGACCAAGAATACACACATCTAGAAGGGGCCTCTTGAACAAGACCAG), respectively. The PCR products containing the desired localized DE/CE sequences (see Fig. 3 A) were then used to replace the corresponding AgeI and EcoRI fragment in ΔPsg1. To obtain constructs with the localized DE/CE sequences situated near the natural position of the DE, constructs Psg55C, Psg36C, Psg51C, Psg56C, and Psg50C were used to generate constructs Psg55D, Psg36D, Psg51D, Psg56D, and Psg50D, respectively. This was accomplished by digestion of the former group with SfiI and AgeI and removal of the ∼1100-base pair-long intervening fragment followed by blunt-end repair of the termini of the larger fragment with T4 DNA polymerase and subsequent self-ligation. The mutants Psg20/26ΔCEC and Psg20/26mCEC were generated as derivatives of Psg20/26 with primer pairs PB30 and PI1 (5′-CCGCTCCTGCAGCTCTAATTTAGTGTGTCCTGCGGAACA AGACCAGTTC) or PI2 (5′-CCGCTCCTGCAGCTCTAATTTAGTGTGTCCTGCGGCTCTCGTGAGGAACAAGACCAGTTC), respectively, and using the generated PCR products to replace the PstI/EcoRI fragment in Psg20/26. These mutants precisely lacked the CE-C sequence (5′-AGGGGCCUCUU) or contained a mutated CE-C (5′-GCUCUCGUGAG) that maintained the original nucleotide composition, respectively, and are identical to Psg20/26 (18Zhang G. Slowinski V. White K.A. RNA. 1999; 5: 550-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) except for the modifications described above. The mutant Psg52, in which the DE-C (5′-CCAAGAAUACACACA) was deleted from its natural position, is a derivative of Psg20/26 and was constructed using the primer PG52 (5′-CCAACCGGTTCTAGAGTGTCTATCCTGCGTCAAGCTACGGCGGAGTCGAGGATGC) as described above for Psg20/26m1 through Psg20/26m3. The mutants Psg35G, Psg34A, Psg34U, and Psg34C are derivatives of T-100 (18Zhang G. Slowinski V. White K.A. RNA. 1999; 5: 550-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) in which the initiation nucleotide for sg mRNA2 transcription was either maintained (Psg35G) or substituted with an adenylate, uridylate, or cytidylate (Psg34A, Psg34U, and Psg34C, respectively.) Psg35G was generated with primer pair PB30 and PG35 (5′-GCCCCCACCGGTCTGCAGAATGATGTTTCTCTAATTTAGTG) followed by digestion of the PCR product with AgeI and EcoRI and replacement of the corresponding fragment in T-100. Psg34A, Psg34U, and Psg34C were generated in an identical manner except that the PCR product used for replacement was generated using primer pair PB30 and the degenerate primer PG34 (5′-GCCCCCACCGGTCTGCAGAATGATGTTTCTCTAATTTAGTGTGTCCTGCGAGGGGCCTCTT(A/T/C)TAACAAGACCAGTTCATGG). All of these constructs are identical to T-100 except for the single nucleotide substitutions indicated and a 45-nucleotide deletion directly 5′ to the AgeI site in T-100. DNA templates for in vitro transcription were prepared by linearizing plasmids containing viral cDNAs with SmaI. Viral RNA transcripts were synthesized using the AmpliScribe T7 Transcription kit (Epicentre Technologies) (23White K.A. Morris T.J. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 14-24Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protoplasts were prepared from 6- to 8-day-old cucumber cotyledons, and purified protoplasts (∼3 × 105) were inoculated with 5 μg of each viral RNA transcript and incubated in a growth chamber under fluorescent lighting at 22 °C for 24 h (23White K.A. Morris T.J. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 14-24Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Total nucleic acids were isolated from protoplasts as described previously (23White K.A. Morris T.J. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 14-24Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) except that preparations for the detection of (−)-strand viral RNAs were precipitated in ethanol with 0.1 m sodium acetate rather than 2 mammonium acetate. For (+)-strand viral RNA detection, aliquots of the total nucleic acid preparation (a tenth) were separated in 1.4% agarose gels and subjected to Northern blot analysis using a32P-5′-end-labeled oligonucleotide probe (P9) complementary to the 3′-terminal 23 nt of the TBSV genome (23White K.A.

Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Minus-sensed viral RNAs were detected with α-32P-labeled in vitro RNA transcripts corresponding to the 3′-terminal 380 nt of the TBSV genome. Prehybridization and hybridization of the RNA probe were performed in UltraHyb solution (Ambion) as recommended by the manufacturer. For both (+)- and (−)-strand detection, radioanalytical quantification of Northern blots was performed using an InstantImager (Packard Instrumental Company). Free energy values for predicted helices were calculated using MFOLD (24Mathews D.H. Sabina J. Zuker M. Turner D.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 911-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (3232) Google Scholar, 25Zuker M. Mathews D.H. Turner D.H. Barciszewski J. Clark B.F.C. RNA Biochemistry and Bio/Technology. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1999: 11-43Google Scholar). Previous results indicated a requirement for a base-pairing interaction between the DE-A and CE-A for efficient sg mRNA2 transcription (18Zhang G. Slowinski V. White K.A. RNA. 1999; 5: 550-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, since the majority (i.e. 10 of 12) of the base pairs involved are of the Watson-Crick variety, this interaction could potentially occur in either the (+)- or (−)-strand (Fig.1 C). In the present study we sought to answer this question regarding polarity by introducing base substitutions into DE-A or CE-A that would progressively and preferentially destabilize the DE-A/CE-A base-pairing interaction in either the (+)- or (−)-strand (Fig.2 A). These mutations were introduced into the previously described mutant genome Psg20/26 that is amenable to modification due to the introduction of convenient restriction enzyme sites near the DE-A and CE-A subelements (18Zhang G. Slowinski V. White K.A. RNA. 1999; 5: 550-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Psg20/26 lacks both the DE-B and CE-B subelements (Fig. 2 A) but maintains sg mRNA2 accumulation at ∼80% that of the WT genome (18Zhang G. Slowinski V. White K.A. RNA. 1999; 5: 550-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Preferential (−)-strand destabilization was accomplished by introducing one, two, or three GU base pairs into DE-A/CE-A (via nucleotide substitutions) within the (+)-strand of Psg20/26, thereby creating mutant derivatives Psg20/26m1, Psg20/26m2, and Psg20/26m3, respectively (Fig. 2 A). These non-Watson-Crick GU base pairs were predicted to be less destabilizing to the (+)-strand interaction than to the corresponding (−)-strand interaction that would contain complementary CA mismatches (Fig. 2 A). Conversely, one, two, or three CA mismatches were introduced into DE-A/CE-A in the (+)-strand of Psg20/26 to preferentially destabilize the (+)-strand interaction, thereby creating Psg20/26m4, Psg20/26m5, and Psg20/26m6, respectively (Fig. 2 A). In vitro generated transcripts corresponding to the WT genome (Fig. 1 A), T-100, and mutant genomes were synthesized in vitro and inoculated into cucumber protoplasts. Northern blot analysis was then performed on isolated total nucleic acids to determine whether the modifications introduced affected the level of sg mRNA2 accumulation (Fig. 2 B). The relative levels of sg mRNA2 were determined by radioanalytical analysis of the blot, and the values generated represent ratios of sg mRNA2 levels to their corresponding genomic RNA levels, all normalized to that for Psg20/26 (Fig. 2 B). Mutants Psg20/26m1 through Psg20/26m3, which were predicted to be preferentially destabilized in the (−)-strand DE-A/CE-A interaction, showed a maximum decrease in sg mRNA2 accumulation for Psg20/26m3 to a level ∼60% that of the Psg20/26 control. In contrast, Psg20/26m4 through Psg20/26m6, which were predicted to be preferentially destabilized in the (+)-strand interaction, showed a more pronounced progressive maximal decrease in sg mRNA2 accumulation to ∼20% that of the Psg20/26 control. These data indicate that the (+)-strand DE-A/CE-A interaction is more sensitive to disruption than its (−)-strand counterpart and thus favor a functional role for this interaction in the (+)-strand. Alternatively, the more prominent inhibitory effects observed for Psg20/26m4 through Psg20/26m6 could be related to the changes in nucleotide identities in DE-C (as opposed to their base-pairing potential). To address this possibility we systematically restored base-pairing competence for Psg20/26m4, Psg20/26m5, and Psg20/26m6 by introducing additional substitutions into DE-A that would regenerate base pairing while maintaining the original substitutions in CE-A, thus creating Psg20/26m1/4, Psg20/26m2/5, and Psg20/26m3/6, respectively (Fig. 2 A). Analysis of these mutants showed that sg mRNA2 levels were near Psg20/26 control levels in all cases (Fig.2 C). Since the original U to C substitutions were retained in these mutants, the dominant functional property is likely (+)-strand base pairing rather than nucleotide identity. In the TBSV genome the DE and CE are separated by ∼1100 nt. The reason for the long distance positioning of these two elements is not clear but may be related to the mechanism(s) by which they operate. In an attempt to gain insight into the function of these elements, we created a series of mutants in which the two elements were positioned directly adjacent to one another in the primary sequence. In these mutant genomes, the ∼1100-nt-long sequence normally separating the DE and CE was reduced to a 6-nt-long restriction enzyme site (XbaI, Fig. 3 A). For construction of the first set of mutants (C-series, Fig. 3 B), the previously generated mutant genome ΔPsg1 was used as the base construct (18Zhang G. Slowinski V. White K.A. RNA. 1999; 5: 550-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In ΔPsg1, sg mRNA1 synthesis is completely inactivated by five nucleotide substitutions in and near its site of initiation (18Zhang G. Slowinski V. White K.A. RNA. 1999; 5: 550-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Additionally, and more relevant to this work, the DE is deleted from its natural upstream position (Fig. 3 A), resulting in only very low levels of sg mRNA2 accumulation (∼10% that of T-100, Fig. 3 C). To determine whether sg mRNA2 synthesis could be restored by reintroducing the DE proximal to CE in ΔPsg1, the entire DE sequence was inserted just 5′ to the CE (Fig.3 B). The ΔPsg1 derivative generated, Psg55C (Fig. 3,A and B), was then inoculated into protoplasts to assess the effect on sg mRNA2 accumulation. Northern blot analysis of accumulating viral RNAs revealed a considerable increase in sg mRNA2 levels to ∼50% that of the T-100 control (Fig.3 C). Additional mutants were also constructed in which various subelements were deleted. In Psg51C and Psg50C, either the DE-B/CE-B subelements or both the DE-B/CE-B and DE-A/CE-A subelements, respectively, were deleted from their localized positions (Fig.3 A). These modifications resulted in relative sg mRNA levels of ∼25 and ∼40%, respectively (Fig. 3 C). These results suggest that neither the DE-B/CE-B nor the DE-A/CE-A subelement interactions are required for the DE-mediated increase in sg mRNA2 accumulation observed and instead implicate DE-C as a possible key subelement for improved activity. To further test this latter concept, the DE-C subelement was deleted from the Psg55C and Psg51C contexts to generate Psg36 and Psg56, respectively (Fig.3 A). Both of these DE-C-lacking genomes exhibited reduced levels of sg mRNA2 accumulation similar to that of ΔPsg1 (Fig.3 C), supporting an important role for DE-C within this CE-localized context. Next the same group of localized DE/CE segments (Fig. 3 A) was repositioned near the normal DE locale. The structure of the localized DE/CEs in this second set of mutants was identical to those in the first; however, the genomic context differed. Although these mutants were also derivatives of ΔPsg1, their genomes were ∼1100 nt shorter than ΔPsg1 due to the absence of the normal intervening sequence between the DE and CE in these constructs (Fig.3 D). Consequently the genomes of these mutants exhibit increased electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 3 E). This particular genomic structure was chosen over an alternative in which the CE would be deleted from its normal location and inserted just 3′ to the DE (while maintaining the original ∼1100 nt 5′ to the CE) because the resulting sg mRNA transcribed from such a mutant would be ∼1100 nt longer than the normal sg mRNA2. This highly modified sg mRNA would be predicted to have significantly altered properties that would invalidate any comparisons with WT sg mRNA2. The analysis of Psg55D, which contained the entire CE element positioned near the DE locale, revealed an average sg mRNA2 level ∼70% that of T-100 (Fig. 3 E). Deletion of the DE-B/CE-B or DE-B/CE-B and DE-A/CE-A subelements in Psg51D and Psg50D, respectively, resulted in rather modest decreases in sg mRNA2 accumulation levels to ∼60 and ∼40%, respectively (Fig. 3 E). This lack of strong dependence on these subelements is similar to that witnessed for the corresponding mutants localized at the CE (Fig. 3 C) and again suggests that the DE-B/CE-B and DE-A/CE-A subelements are dispensable for the basal activity observed (i.e. >3-fold over that of ΔPsg1) for these localized structures. Interestingly, the deletion of the DE-C subelement in Psg36D and Psg56D did not lead to any major decreases in sg mRNA2 accumulation (Fig.3 E). These latter results are in contrast to those observed for Psg36C and Psg56C where deletion of DE-C resulted in levels of sg mRNA2 accumulation similar to that of ΔPsg1 (Fig. 3 C). This finding indicates that the requirement for DE-C is context-dependent. To explore the role of the newly defined and previously uncharacterized CE-C subelement, two mutant genomes were constructed within a Psg20/26 context. In the first mutant, Psg20/26ΔCEC, the entire CE-C subelement (5′-AGGGGCCUCUU) was deleted; however, the initiating guanylate located just 3′ to CE-C (see Fig. 1 C) was maintained (Fig.4 A). For the second mutant, Psg20/26mCEC, the sequence of CE-C was mutated to 5′-GCUCUCGUGAG to maintain the original nucleotide composition but not the primary sequence (Fig. 4 A). Again the original initiating guanylate just 3′ to CE-C was maintained. When tested for their ability to direct sg mRNA2 transcription, both showed very low levels of sg mRNA2 accumulation (Fig. 4 B). This result defines CE-C as a new subelement that is essential for efficient sg mRNA2 accumulation. The requirement for the DE-C subelement in the more natural Psg20/26 context was also examined by analyzing mutant Psg52 in which the DE-C was deleted (Fig. 4 A). Deletion of this subelement led to a significant decrease in the relative accumulation of sg mRNA2 (to <50% that of Psg20/26, Fig. 4 C). This notable reduction implicates DE-C as being important for optimal sg mRNA2 accumulation levels when it is positioned distally in a WT-like genomic context. To investigate the role of the initiating nucleotide located just 3′ to CE-C, the guanylate present in the control genome Psg35G was mutated to an A, U, or C, generating the Psg35G-derivatives Psg34A, Psg34U, and Psg34C, respectively (Fig.5 A). Each of the three substitutions led to dramatic decreases (>10-fold) in sg mRNA2 accumulation levels (Fig. 5 B). In contrast, when (−)-strand viral RNAs were analyzed for the same infections there was no corresponding decrease in the relative (−)-strand sg mRNA2 accumulation levels, and, in two cases, relative levels instead increased (Fig. 5 C). These observations indicate that the initiating nucleotide is specifically required for efficient accumulation of sg mRNA2 (+)-strands and suggests that it can also influence, albeit to a lesser degree, the relative abundance of sg mRNA2 (−)-strands. In this study we have carried out a more detailed analysis of the RNA subelements implicated in the regulation of sg mRNA2 transcription in TBSV. Previous results from our laboratory have confirmed the importance of the DE-A/CE-A base-pairing interaction for efficient sg mRNA2 transcription (18Zhang G. Slowinski V. White K.A. RNA. 1999; 5: 550-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Our current results suggest that this interaction is functional primarily in the (+)-strand (Fig. 2 B). Strengthening of this interaction by the substitution of AU with GC base pairs did not dramatically alter sg mRNA2 accumulation, although slightly elevated levels were observed when three GC base pairs were introduced (Fig. 2 C). This suggests that this interaction may already be at its minimally required stability for near-optimal activity. The (+)-strand activity defined for the DE-A/CE-A interaction also likely extends to the DE-B/CE-B interaction that was proposed to play an auxiliary role in promoting and/or stabilizing the DE-A/CE-A interaction (18Zhang G. Slowinski V. White K.A. RNA. 1999; 5: 550-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Additional support that these two interactions occur in the (+)-strand comes from previous comparative sequence analyses of corresponding elements in other species of the genus Tombusvirus (18Zhang G. Slowinski V. White K.A. RNA. 1999; 5: 550-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Sequence comparisons of the predicted secondary structures revealed a preponderance of GU, GA, and GG non-Watson-Crick base pairs within the analyzed helices. Such noncanonical base pairs are common in rRNA secondary structure and are predicted to be significantly more stable than their corresponding (−)-strand counterparts (26Limmer S. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1997; 57: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data support the functional interaction of DE-A/CE-A, and by extension DE-B/CE-B, in the (+)-strand of the viral genome. What is the function of the DE-A/CE-A interaction in the (+)-strand? A similar 8-base pair-long secondary structure is predicted to form in Red clover necrotic mosaic virus (RCNMV), however it occurs just 2 nt upstream from the initiation site of sg mRNA synthesis (10Sit T.L. Vaewhongs A.A. Lommel S.A. Science. 1998; 281: 829-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Another difference in the RCNMV interaction is that it occurs in trans as it involves base pairing between the two RNA segments comprising the bipartite genome. For the RCNMV interaction, it was proposed that formation of this helix acts to stall the viral polymerase during (−)-strand synthesis and that this, in turn, causes it to terminate prematurely and generate (−)-strand sg mRNAs (10Sit T.L. Vaewhongs A.A. Lommel S.A. Science. 1998; 281: 829-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). These (−)-strand sg mRNAs would then be used as templates for (+)-strand sg mRNA transcription. Our previous studies showed that the DE-A/CE-A interaction is essential for enhanced sg mRNA2 synthesis when the DE and CE are separated by ∼1100 nt within the genome (18Zhang G. Slowinski V. White K.A. RNA. 1999; 5: 550-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, our current results indicate that when the DE and CE are placed directly adjacent to each other, there is no strict requirement for the DE-A/CE-A interaction. Localized elements containing only the DE-C/CE-C subelements were still able to direct notable sg mRNA2 transcription (Fig. 3, C and E). This observation suggests that the primary role of the DE-A/CE-A interaction within the context of the WT genome may be in the appropriate relative positioning of other subelements, such as DE-C and/or CE-C, thereby facilitating their activities (see below). Nevertheless, additional roles for this interaction cannot be precluded currently. The DE-C, unlike the DE-A and DE-B, is not predicted to have any significant complementarity to its counterpart in the CE, CE-C (Fig. 1 C). Our results indicate that the necessity of the DE-C subelement for sg mRNA2 accumulation is context-dependent. When the DE was repositioned near the normal CE location, deletion of DE-C led to a dramatic decrease in sg mRNA2 accumulation (Fig. 2 B). However, when the CE was localized near the DE no such effect was observed upon deletion of CE-C (Fig. 2 C). In the more natural context of Psg20/26, the DE-C was also found to be important for optimal sg mRNA2 accumulation (Fig. 4 C). Based on its structural properties, a possible role for this element may simply be to not base pair with CE-C. This would in turn leave CE-C free to interact functionally with other sequences and/or proteins. This idea is consistent with the observation that there is no significant sequence identity among DE-C elements from different members of the genus Tombusvirus, yet a common feature is that they all exhibit little complementarity to their corresponding CE-C subelements (18Zhang G. Slowinski V. White K.A. RNA. 1999; 5: 550-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In contrast, the sequence comprising the CE-C is highly conserved for members of this genus and is located just 5′ to the site of initiation of sg mRNA2 (18Zhang G. Slowinski V. White K.A. RNA. 1999; 5: 550-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This subelement was found to be essential for efficient sg mRNA2 accumulation (Fig. 4 B). In RCNMV the sequence just 5′ to the initiation site of its sg mRNA interacts with a complementary viral sequence to mediate sg mRNA transcription (10Sit T.L. Vaewhongs A.A. Lommel S.A. Science. 1998; 281: 829-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Due to the relatedness of these viruses (i.e. they are both members of the family Tombusviridae), it is possible that sg mRNA2 transcription in TBSV also requires base pairing of its similarly positioned sequence, CE-C. The lack of complementarity between CE-C and DE-C would preclude the latter from acting in this capacity. However, possible base-pairing partners for the CE-C sequence have been identified within the TBSV genomic sequence and are currently being analyzed to determine whether they participate in regulating sg mRNA2 transcription. The initiating nucleotide for sg mRNA2 synthesis has been mapped by primer extension to a guanylate just 3′ to the CE-C (27Hillman B.I. Hearne P. Rochon D. Morris T.J. Virology. 1989; 169: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Our results have shown that for efficient transcription of sg mRNA2 there is a strict requirement for the identity of the initiating nucleotide to be a guanylate (Fig.5 B). However, the same strict requirement was not observed for the production of (−)-strands corresponding to sg mRNA2 (Fig.5 C). These (−)-strands have been previously implicated as possible templates for the synthesis of (+)-strand sg mRNA2 (18Zhang G. Slowinski V. White K.A. RNA. 1999; 5: 550-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar); however, exactly how they are formed remains unclear. For example, the sg mRNA2 (−)-strands could accumulate either as dead-end products synthesized from sg mRNAs transcribed from the full-length (−)-strand of the genome or, alternatively, could represent prematurely terminated products synthesized during (−)-strand synthesis of the (+)-strand genome. In the latter case, the sg mRNA2 (−)-strands could potentially serve as intermediates by acting as templates for the transcription of (+)-strand sg mRNA2. Our finding that (−)-strand accumulation does not correlate with (+)-strand accumulation argues against the (−)-strands originating from (+)-strand sg mRNA2. This independence of (−)- on (+)-strand sg mRNA accumulation has also been observed for Flock house virus (13Price B.D. Roeder M. Ahlquist P. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 11724-11733Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). For TBSV, in some cases, the relationship between the two oppositely sensed strands is actually inverse, with lower (+)-strand accumulation corresponding to higher (−)-strand accumulation, as for Psg34A and Psg34U (Fig. 5, B and C). These results support the concept that the (−)-strand sg mRNAs observed are not derived from (+)-strand sg mRNA2. Instead they could represent prematurely terminated products that arise during (−)-strand synthesis of the viral genome that, in turn, could serve as templates for sg mRNA2 synthesis. The inability of the (−)-strands generated from the mutants (Psg34A, Psg34C, and Psg34U) to direct transcription of (+)-strands could be related to the strict requirement of tombusvirus polymerases to initiate efficiently only opposite to an appropriately positioned C within promoters in viral templates (28Nagy P.D. Pogany J. Virology. 2000; 276: 279-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Taken together, our results are consistent with the concept that sg mRNA2 transcription could occur via a premature termination mechanism. However, other alternatives, such as the observed effects being the result of post-transcriptional processes, cannot be ruled out at the present time. Additional experiments are planned to further investigate the mode by which sg mRNA2 is expressed."

However, it is not known whether CD39 is active in the compartments of the secretory pathway. One distinguishing hallmark of E- NTPDases is their ability to hydrolyze nucleotide substrates at extremely high turnover rates. The specific ecto-ATPase activity of the digitonin-solublized membrane-bound CD39 has been estimated to be ∼2000 µmol/min/mg (11Wang T.F. Ou Y. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24814-24821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). If such high nucleotidase activity were present in the lumen of intracellular compartments such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or the Golgi, it would deplete the lumenal ATP and potentially inhibit other ATP-dependent lumenal components and processes (16Quemeneur E. Guthapfel R. Gueguen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5485-5488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Pfeffer S.R. Rothman J.E. Annu. Rev.

It thus becomes of interest to determine whether cells can tolerate the presence of high nucleotidase activity within intracellular compartments and to identify the stage at which CD39 becomes active. In this study, we provide evidence that CD39 is not active until it reaches the plasma membrane, indicating that cells restrict CD39 activity to its target location. Our results also demonstrate that complete N-glycosylation of CD39 correlates with its enzymatic activity and that N-glycan addition is essential for its surface localization.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have provided multiple lines of evidence that the mammalian E-NTPDase CD39 is not active until it reaches the plasma membrane. First, the results of sucrose density fractionation of COS-7 membranes illustrated that although transfected CD39 primarily localized within the ER fraction, CD39 activity localized to the plasma membrane fraction. Secondly, soluble CD39 is active when it is secreted into the extracellular medium, but it is not active when it is within the COS-7 cells. Thirdly, secretable soluble CD39 with an ER retention signal is not active in both COS-7 and yeast cells. Finally, overexpression of either CD39 or sCD39-HDEL in yeast does not cause a slow growth phenotype, even though CD39 is active in the yeast plasma membrane.Furthermore, both wild type CD39 and soluble CD39 devoid ofN-glycosylation are retained intracellularly and remain inactive. In addition, similar ecto-ATPase activities are observed for both intact and digitonin-permeablized cells transfected with CD39, suggesting that CD39 is normally only active at the cell surface. Thus, it is concluded that full N-glycosylation correlates with the activation of CD39 and is required for its surface localization.Our findings are consistent with the notion that maintaining lumenal ATP concentrations within intracellular compartments is essential. Many steps in ER protein processing are catalyzed by lumenal ATP-dependent factors. The post-translational transfer of secretory protein precursors in yeast can only occur if a sufficient level of ATP is present inside the ER lumen (32Mayinger P. Meyer D.I. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 659-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 33Mayinger P. Bankaitis V.A. Meyer D.I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1377-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Mammalian lumenal chaperone protein BiP and its yeast homolog Kar2p are crucial for ATP-dependent protein translocation (34Normington K. Kohno K. Kozutsumi Y. Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Cell. 1989; 57: 1223-1236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 35Rose M.D. Misra L.M. Vogel J.P.

In addition, Kar2p and other ATP-dependent chaperones are critical for the proper folding of translocated protein inside the ER lumen and ensure that only correctly folded proteins proceed along the secretory pathway toward their final destination (38Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3576) Google Scholar, 39Simons J.F. Ferro-Novick S. Rose M.D. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Golgi lumenal ATP is vital for the phosphorylation of secreted proteins and Golgi integral membrane proteins (40Puglielli L. Mandon E.C. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12665-12669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Futile hydrolysis of this lumenal ATP by intracellular CD39 would presumably impair these biological processes. It seems necessary for biological systems to minimize CD39 activity during its processing and shipping in the ER and Golgi.CD39 is a prototypical member of the rapidly expanding E-NTPDase family. Not only do some members localize to the plasma membrane or to the extracellular space (41Smith T.M. Kirley T.L. Biochim. Biophys.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3282-3292Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Interestingly, most of these intracellular E-NTPDases, such as mammalian Golgi-UDPase (48Wang T.F. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11392-11399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), mammalian ER-UDPase (49Trombetta E.S. Helenius A.

Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 307-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), are ecto-NDPases and possess little ecto-ATPase activity. The only reported Golgi E-NTPDase possessing high ecto-ATPase activity is the yeast protein Ynd1p (23Zhong X. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32704-32711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 47Gao X.D. Kaigorodov V. Jigami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21450-21456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, the activity of this enzyme is normally down-regulated by Vma13p, a peripheral protein associated with the vacuolar H+-ATPase (50Zhong X. Malhotra R. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35592-35599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). When this repressor is missing, Ynd1p activity increases drastically. Overexpression of Ynd1p causes a slow growth phenotype in such cells (50Zhong X. Malhotra R. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35592-35599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These observations, together with the data in this paper, support the notion that ecto-ATPase activity present in the secretory pathway is toxic to cells and therefore is tightly regulated.What are the potential mechanisms that ensure the inactive state of CD39 before its arrival to the plasma membrane? CD39 does not contain a cleavable propeptide sequence, although a limited extent of tryptic cleavage of intact CD39 on the cell surface has been reported that augments NTPDase activity by roughly 2-fold (13Schulte am Esch J. Sevigny J. Kaczmarek E. Siegel J.B. Imai M. Koziak K. Beaudoin A.R. Robson S.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2248-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The surrounding pH does not appear to be a major factor that affects CD39 activity in the intracellular compartments. CD39 retains ∼50% of its activity at pH 6.5 (51Gayle R.B. Maliszewski C.R. Gimpel S.D. Schoenborn M.A. Caspary R.G. Richards C. Brasel K. Price V. Drosopoulos J.H. Islam N. Alyonycheva T.N. Broekman M.J. Marcus A.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1851-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), whereas the pH in the ER lumen is close to neutral (52Kim J.H. Johannes L. Goud B. Antony C. Lingwood C.A. Daneman R. Grinstein S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2997-3002Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), and the pH in the Golgi lumen was measured to be 6.45 (53Kim J.H. Lingwood C.A. Williams D.B. Furuya W. Manolson M.F. Grinstein S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1387-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Palmitoylation within the NH2 terminus of CD39 has been reported to be important both in its plasma membrane association and in its targeting to caveolae (15Koziak K. Kaczmarek E. Kittel A. Sevigny J. Blusztajn J.K. Schulte Am Esch J. Imai M. Guckelberger O. Goepfert C. Qawi I. Robson S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2057-2062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, this modification is not essential for the activation of CD39 because sCD39, which lacks the NH2-terminal modification site, is active when it is secreted into the extracellular medium (Fig. 5B and Refs. 11Wang T.F. Ou Y. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24814-24821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholarand 51Gayle R.B. Maliszewski C.R. Gimpel S.D. Schoenborn M.A. Caspary R.G. Richards C. Brasel K. Price V. Drosopoulos J.H. Islam N. Alyonycheva T.N. Broekman M.J. Marcus A.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1851-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar).Although the oligomeric state of CD39 in the intracellular compartments may have an effect on enzymatic activity, it can only be a partial effect because monomeric CD39 retains at least 10% of its oligomeric activity (11Wang T.F. Ou Y. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24814-24821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Thus, even if CD39 were monomeric in the intracellular compartment, it would still have sufficient activity that would require further silencing.The addition and processing of N-linked glycans in the ER and Golgi play a critical role in the biogenesis and quality control of many membrane proteins and secretory proteins (54Helenius A. Aebi M. Science. 2001; 291: 2364-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (1956) Google Scholar). Whereas glycosylation can promote the proper folding and assembly of glycoproteins to increase their stability and trafficking, glycosylation is not required for the cell surface expression of many glycoproteins and secretory proteins (55Khanna R. Myers M.P. Laine M. Papazian M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34028-34034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 56Ballensiefen W. Schmitt H.D. Eur J Biochem. 1997; 247: 142-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 57Sarokin L. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 2750-2757Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Previous work has shown that N-glycosylation is important for maintaining the enzymatic activities of HB6, another member of the E-NTPDase family (58Smith T.M. Kirley T.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1509-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The data presented here demonstrate thatN-glycosylation is essential for the surface localization of CD39 and correlates with the activation of the protein. Furthermore, intracellular sCD39 and sCD39-(H/K)DEL are partially glycosylated (Figs. 3B and 5A) within the ER and probably within the early compartment of the Golgi, because soluble ER-resident proteins with the (K/H)DEL signal are retrieved back to the ER from early Golgi compartments via (K/H)DEL receptors (29Pelham H.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar, 30Nilsson T. Warren G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 517-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). But these proteins are still not active. This suggests that terminal glycosylation of CD39 in the mid-Golgi or late Golgi compartments is critical for CD39 activity. It is possible that terminal glycosylation of CD39 is required for proper folding of the active enzyme. Extracellular nucleotides such as ATP can act as signaling transmitters in nerve, muscle, and blood tissues through their interactions with specific plasma membrane purinergic receptors (1Dubyak G.R. el-Moatassim C.

Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 519-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The ability of ecto-nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolases (E-NTPDases)1 to hydrolyze nucleoside tri- and diphosphates in the presence of divalent cations (usually Ca2+ or Mg2+) suggests that they may regulate the actions of purinergic receptors by controlling the extracellular conversion rate from ATP to adenosine (1Dubyak G.R. el-Moatassim C.

The molecular identity of the E-NTPDase family was initially discovered by the cloning of a soluble apyrase from potato tubers (Solanum tuberosum) (5Handa M. Guidotti G. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Recent data from CD39-null mice indicate that CD39 indeed plays an important role in regulating the function of the ADP-dependent purinoreceptor P2Y1 (10Enjyoji K. Sevigny J. Lin Y. Frenette P.S.

https://openalex.org/W2017333206,"The ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, CDC34, has been implicated in the ubiquitination of a number of vertebrate substrates, including p27Kip1, IκBα, Wee1, and MyoD. We show that mammalian CDC34 is a phosphoprotein that is phosphorylated in proliferating cells. By yeast two-hybrid screening, we identified the regulatory (β) subunit of human casein kinase 2 (CK2) as a CDC34-interacting protein and show that human CDC34 interacts in vivo with CK2β in transfected cells. CDC34 is specifically phosphorylated in vitro by recombinant CK2 and HeLa nuclear extract at five sites within the carboxyl-terminal 36 amino acids of CDC34. Importantly, this phosphorylation is inhibited by heparin, a substrate-specific inhibitor of CK2. We have also identified a kinase activity associated with CDC34 in proliferating cells, and we show that this kinase is sensitive to heparin and can utilize GTP, strongly suggesting it is CK2. Phosphorylation of CDC34 by the associated kinase maps predominantly to residues 203 and 222. Mutation of CDC34 at CK2-targeted residues, Ser-203, Ser-222, Ser-231, Thr-233, and Ser-236, abolishes the phosphorylation of CDC34 observed in vivo and markedly shifts nuclearly localized CDC34 to the cytoplasm. These results suggest a potential role for CK2-mediated phosphorylation in the regulation of CDC34 cell localization and function. The ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, CDC34, has been implicated in the ubiquitination of a number of vertebrate substrates, including p27Kip1, IκBα, Wee1, and MyoD. We show that mammalian CDC34 is a phosphoprotein that is phosphorylated in proliferating cells. By yeast two-hybrid screening, we identified the regulatory (β) subunit of human casein kinase 2 (CK2) as a CDC34-interacting protein and show that human CDC34 interacts in vivo with CK2β in transfected cells. CDC34 is specifically phosphorylated in vitro by recombinant CK2 and HeLa nuclear extract at five sites within the carboxyl-terminal 36 amino acids of CDC34. Importantly, this phosphorylation is inhibited by heparin, a substrate-specific inhibitor of CK2. We have also identified a kinase activity associated with CDC34 in proliferating cells, and we show that this kinase is sensitive to heparin and can utilize GTP, strongly suggesting it is CK2. Phosphorylation of CDC34 by the associated kinase maps predominantly to residues 203 and 222. Mutation of CDC34 at CK2-targeted residues, Ser-203, Ser-222, Ser-231, Thr-233, and Ser-236, abolishes the phosphorylation of CDC34 observed in vivo and markedly shifts nuclearly localized CDC34 to the cytoplasm. These results suggest a potential role for CK2-mediated phosphorylation in the regulation of CDC34 cell localization and function. ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme bromodeoxyuridine bovine serum albumin cell division cycle casein kinase 2 casein kinase 1 glutathione S-transferase hemagglutinin human casein kinase 2β human CDC34 sodium deoxycholate polymerase chain reaction Skp1/cullin/F-box Cdc34p in S. cerevisiae polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis wild-type point mutant radioimmune precipitation buffer immunoprecipitation-Western The CDC34 gene was first identified as a cell division cycle gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae required for the G1 to S phase transition and was later shown to encode a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (UBC)1 or E2 (1Hereford L.M.

A. 1993; 90: 10484-10488Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and has been proposed to participate in the ubiquitination of various substrates during diverse cellular processes in vertebrates (4DeSalle L.M. Pagano M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 179-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 5Yew P.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 187: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The most detailed studies of CDC34 have focused on its function during the onset of DNA replication. In budding yeast, Cdc34p is required to degrade the Cdc28-Clb5,6 kinase inhibitor, p40Sic1, to traverse the G1 to S phase transition and initiate DNA replication (6Schwob E. Bohm T. Mendenhall M.D. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1994; 79: 233-244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). Studies in interphase egg extracts of Xenopus laevisshow that CDC34 is also required for the onset of DNA replication in vertebrates, implying a protein degradation requirement for the progression into S phase (7Yew P.R. Kirschner M.W. Science. 1997; 277: 1672-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Functionally, vertebrate CDC34 in association with different ubiquitin protein ligase or E3 complexes has been shown to target many different substrates for ubiquitination and degradation during cell division, signal transduction, and development (reviewed in Refs. 8Tyers M. Jorgensen P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 54-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar and 9Koepp D.M. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1999; 97: 431-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). The vertebrate CDC34 substrates that have been characterized to date include IκBα, B-Myb, Wee1, MyoD, ICERIIγ, ATF5, p27Xic1, and p27Kip1 (7, 10–12; reviewed in Refs. 8Tyers M. Jorgensen P. Curr.

Cell. 1999; 97: 431-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Additionally, substrates such as β-catenin, p21Cip1, E2F, cyclin E, and cyclin D are putative substrates of CDC34 by virtue of their SCF requirement for proteolysis (reviewed in Refs. 5Yew P.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 187: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 8Tyers M. Jorgensen P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 54-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). SCF is a multiprotein E3 complex that functions in association with CDC34 and is composed of the F-box binding protein p19Skp1, a cullin protein, an F-box protein, and the ring finger protein Roc1/Rbx1/Hrt1 (reviewed in Refs.4DeSalle L.M. Pagano M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 179-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 13Deshaies R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 435-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). In mammals, CDC34 in association with SCFp45Skp2participates in the ubiquitination of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p27Kip1 (14Carrano A.C. Eytan E. Hershko A. Pagano M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1341) Google Scholar, 15Tsvetkov L.M. Yeh K.H. Lee S.J. Sun H. Zhang H. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 661-664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). The regulation of CDC34·SCF-dependent ubiquitination of substrates is found at many different levels. To date, most of the characterized SCF substrates are targeted to the ubiquitination machinery only upon phosphorylation and subsequent binding to the F-box protein (reviewed in Refs. 13Deshaies R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 435-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar, 16Ciechanover A. Orian A. Schwartz A.L. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 442-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). This suggests two levels of regulation, one at the level of the kinase responsible for substrate phosphorylation and the other at the level of F-box protein expression. In budding yeast, regulation of substrate ubiquitination has also been demonstrated at the level of the components of the ubiquitination machinery. The ring finger protein Roc1/Rbx1/Hrt1 in yeast modulates the level of active Cdc34p that associates with the SCF complex, thus regulating the level of substrate ubiquitination (17Skowyra D. Koepp D.M. Kamura T. Conrad M.N. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Science. 1999; 284: 662-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 18Seol J.H. Feldman R.M. Zachariae W.

Recent studies have also indicated that the ubiquitination machinery is regulated by post-translational modifications as well. Cullin proteins are found to be post-translationally modified by NEDD8 conjugation, and this modification has been shown to be required for full activation of a Roc1·Cul1 ubiquitin ligase complex (19Wu K. Chen A. Pan Z.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32317-32324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 20Read M.A. Brownell J.E. Gladysheva T.B. Hottelet M. Parent L.A.

Xiong Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8185-8197Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Roc1/Rbx1/Hrt1 and F-box proteins themselves appear to be regulated by ubiquitination and proteolysis as well. In budding yeast, F-box proteins Grr1, Cdc4, and Met30 have been shown to be ubiquitinated by core components of SCF complexes, targeting them for degradation and potentially resulting in changes in the levels of functional F-box proteins (22Galan J.M.

Michel J.J. Xiong Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6758-6766Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In addition, Cdc34p inS. cerevisiae (ScCdc34p) has been shown to dimerize and to be phosphorylated and ubiquitinated, although these post-translational modifications have not yet been linked to an essential biological function (27Banerjee A. Gregori L. Xu Y. Chau V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5668-5675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Goebl M.G. Goetsch L. Byers B. Mol. Cell.

We also identify the regulatory subunit (β) of human casein kinase 2 (CK2) as a novel CDC34-interacting protein through yeast two-hybrid screening and characterize the putative phosphorylation of hCDC34 by CK2. CK2 is a constitutive and ubiquitously expressed serine-threonine kinase (reviewed in Refs. 30Allende J.E. Allende C.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 31Pinna L.A. Meggio F. Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 1997; 3: 77-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) that is essential for viability and cell cycle progression in S. cerevisiae (32Padmanabha R. Chen-Wu J.L. Hanna D.E.

Chem. 1995; 270: 25905-25914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). CK2 is also required for cell cycle progression in mammals (34Pepperkok R. Lorenz P. Ansorge W. Pyerin W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6986-6991Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and misregulation of CK2 expression in the lymphocytes of transgenic mice has been shown to result in the development of lymphoma (35Seldin D.C. Leder P. Science. 1995; 267: 894-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone). Serum starvation was used to synchronize cells and for the generation of quiescent cells. Cells at 40–50% confluency were washed with serum-free media, and the media were replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.1% fetal bovine serum or 0.1% calf serum for 72 h before harvesting. Proliferating cells were harvested at 60–70% confluence. To determine the onset of S phase in synchronized cells, serum-starved cells were stimulated and pulse-labeled with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 3 or 10 h as indicated, fixed in 100% methanol, permeabilized, and stained with anti-BrdUrd antibodies (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells staining positively for BrdUrd were quantitated as a percentage of the total number of cells counted (∼200–400) for each labeling time period. Unstimulated or asynchronously growing cells were labeled with BrdUrd for 3 h and treated as above. Cells were metabolically pulse-labeled for 3 h with [35S]methionine or 3–5 h with [32P]orthophosphate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Transfected cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate 39 h post-transfection for 5 h. U20S, WI-38, 10T-1/2, and 293 cells were transfected at 30–50% confluency by CaPO4 transfection (36Davis R.L. Weintraub H. Lassar A.B. Cell. 1987; 51: 987-1000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2499) Google Scholar), and the cells were harvested 36–48 h following transfection. Cells were then washed in 1× PBS and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde. Immunofluorescence studies were performed by permeabilizing the cells in PBST (1× PBS, 0.25% Triton X-100), blocking in 3% BSA, and incubating in either protein A-Sepharose-purified 12CA5 monoclonal antibody (gift of Pascal Stein and Tom Rapoport) or affinity-purified anti-CDC34 antibody (7Yew P.R. Kirschner M.W. Science. 1997; 277: 1672-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Following incubation at 24 °C and washing, the cells were incubated with donkey anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies coupled to Cyanin-3, followed by staining with Hoechst 33342. The slides were visualized on a Zeiss Axiophot microscope at a final magnification of 500×, and digital images were captured using OpenLab imaging software (Improvision, Inc.). Two-hybrid library screening was performed using the method of Stan Hollenberg (37Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). Full-length hCDC34 was cloned into pBTM116 (38Bartel P.L. Fields S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 254: 241-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) and screened against a human lung Matchmaker cDNA library (CLONTECH). All cloning by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed using Pfu DNA polymerase (Pfu, Stratagene). Xenopus laevis CK2β was cloned into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of pCS2+ by PCR using a X. laevis Stage 11.5–15 pCS2+ plasmid library (gift from Kevin Lustig and Marc W. Kirschner). Carboxyl-terminally FLAG-tagged human CK2β (hCK2β) was generated by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis. The amino acid sequences of human andX. laevis CK2β are identical with only one amino acid difference at residue 214, which was changed from methionine to isoleucine to generate the hCK2β expression plasmid. 6xHis-hCDC34-(1–200) was cloned into theBamHI/SmaI sites of pQE30 (Qiagen) and theBamHI/StuI sites of pCS2+ by PCR. Human RAD6 was cloned into the BamHI/Asp718 sites of pQE30 by PCR. Amino-terminally HA-tagged hCDC34 was cloned into theEcoRI/filled-in XhoI sites of pCS2+ from HA-hCDC34/pcDL-SRα-296. Amino-terminally FLAG-tagged hCDC34 was cloned into the BamHI/StuI sites of pCS2+ by PCR. Point mutations were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit as described (Stratagene). Point mutations were subcloned from pQE30 into HA-hCDC34/pCS2+ for mammalian cell expression. Human CDC34 point mutant S231A, T233A,S236A (3 PT MUT) was generated by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis. Human CDC34 point mutant S203A,S231A,T233A, S236A (4 PT MUT) was generated from the hCDC34 3 PT MUT. Human CDC34 point mutant S203A,S222A,S231A,T233A,S236A (5 PT MUT) was generated from the hCDC34 4 PT MUT. All clones were confirmed by DNA sequencing using the Amplicycle sequencing kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). All 6xHis/pQE30 proteins were expressed in M15 cells and purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose as previously described (7Yew P.R. Kirschner M.W. Science. 1997; 277: 1672-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). All proteins were extensively dialyzed into 1× PBS before use in kinase or binding assays. The hCDC34 and hCK2βin vitro co-immunoprecipitation reaction was incubated and washed in RIPA buffer with sodium deoxycholate (NaDOC) (100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, 10 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% NaDOC). In a 20-µl reaction, 5 µl of [35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in vitro translated FLAG-hCK2β (TNT Quick Coupled kit, Promega) was added to 4 µg of recombinant 6xHis-hCDC34 (7Yew P.R. Kirschner M.W. Science. 1997; 277: 1672-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) in RIPA buffer with NaDOC. Samples were allowed to bind at 30 °C for 1 h followed by a pre-clearing step with 20 µl of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The lysates were then immunoprecipitated with 2 µl of anti-CDC34 polyclonal rabbit serum (7Yew P.R. Kirschner M.W. Science. 1997; 277: 1672-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) or normal rabbit serum (Sigma Chemical Co.) and 25 µl of protein A-Sepharose. After incubation, the beads were washed with RIPA buffer with NaDOC, the beads were aspirated and boiled in 1× Laemmli sample buffer (39Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), and the samples were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). A percentage of the input [35S]methionine in vitro translated protein (2.5%) was included on the gel to quantitate the percentage of co-immunoprecipitated protein. Gels were quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Immunoprecipitation-Western (IP-Western) assays were conducted using whole cell lysates generated with RIPA buffer. For immunoprecipitations, the amount of lysate used was normalized to an equal amount of total protein as determined by Bradford analysis (Bio-Rad) or direct Western of the protein of interest and ranged between 200 and 1500 µg, depending on expression levels. The lysates were immunoprecipitated using 8.8 µg of FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) or mouse IgG, 1 µl of 12CA5 or control mouse ascites (Sigma), and 4 µg of affinity-purified CDC34 or rabbit IgG (Sigma). The immunoprecipitates were bound to protein A- or G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), washed with RIPA buffer, boiled, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Immunoblots were performed on the immunoprecipitated material or on 50 µg of total cell lysate per gel lane. Between 25 and 50 µg of total protein was typically analyzed by immunoblotting in a single gel lane. Immunoblots were incubated with affinity-purified CDC34 antibody (1.2 µg/ml), 12CA5 ascites (1:5000), or FLAG M2 antibody (2 µg/ml). Immunoblots were then incubated with goat anti-rabbit/mouse or protein A coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad) followed by chemiluminescence using ECL reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Double-immunoprecipitation assays were performed on cell lysates following [35S]methionine or [32P]orthophosphate metabolic labeling of cells as previously described (40Yew P.R. Berk A.J. Nature. 1992; 357: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Labeled cell lysates were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and normalized by using equivalent amounts of trichloroacetic acid-precipitable counts for each sample. Between 4 × 106 and 1 × 108 trichloroacetic acid-precipitable counts from cell extracts or 1.7 × 108 trichloroacetic acid-precipitable counts from transfected cell extracts were immunoprecipitated. The in vitro CK2 kinase assays were performed with recombinant human CK2 enzyme, cell extracts, or immunoprecipitates. For in vitro kinase assays utilizing recombinant human CK2, a 20-µl reaction containing 0.5–5 µg of recombinant 6xHis-hCDC34 protein or other recombinant proteins, CK2 buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 150 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol), 0.1 or 0.25 milliunit of human recombinant CK2 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals or New England BioLabs, respectively), and 0.09 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by boiling samples in 1× Laemmli sample buffer, followed by SDS-PAGE, Coomassie Blue staining, and autoradiography. Kinase assays using cell lysates were performed by adding 5–50 µg of nuclear or total cell extract to a 30-µl reaction with 0.5 µg of recombinant 6xHis-hCDC34 protein.X. laevis S100 and HeLa cell nuclear extract were generated as previously described (7Yew P.R. Kirschner M.W. Science. 1997; 277: 1672-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 41Boyer T.G. Martin M.E. Lees E. Ricciardi R.P. Berk A.J. Nature. 1999; 399: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 1 h and then were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Kinase assays performed on immunoprecipitates were conducted as follows. Cell extracts were generated from 100-mm tissue culture plates using 300-µl RIPA buffer containing 50 mm NaF and 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate. Between 165 and 270 µl of cell lysate was immunoprecipitated with 3 µg of affinity-purified hCDC34 or rabbit IgG, 1 µl of 12CA5 or mouse ascites, and 20 µl of protein A-Sepharose. Direct immunoblot analyses were performed using 50 µg of total cell lysates to confirm normalization of immunoprecipitated proteins. Following immunoprecipitation, the beads were washed twice in RIPA buffer and once in CK2 kinase buffer. The beads were then mixed with 20 µl of kinase reaction mixture containing 50 mmHepes, pH 7.2, 150 mm KCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was carried out at 30 °C for 30 min with mixing every 10 min followed by the addition of 500 µl of RIPA buffer containing 5 mm EDTA. The beads were then washed, boiled, and added to l ml of RIPA buffer followed by re-immunoprecipitation. The samples were then washed in 10S buffer (250 mm NaCl, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 0.3% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.005% SDS) (42Lee W.S. Kao C.C. Bryant G.O. Liu X. Berk A.J. Cell. 1991; 67: 365-376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), boiled, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. To determine if CDC34 is phosphorylated in mammalian cells, we metabolically labeled WI-38 human diploid fibroblast cells and NIH3T3 mouse fibroblast cells with [35S]methionine or [32P]orthophosphate. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with CDC34 or pre-immune antibodies, and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The results show that CDC34 is readily phosphorylated in mammalian cells (Fig. 1A,lanes 3 and 7). To further characterize thein vivo phosphorylation status of mammalian CDC34, NIH3T3 cells were synchronized by serum deprivation followed by serum stimulation and metabolic pulse labeling with [35S]methionine or [32P]orthophosphate. In parallel, synchronized cells were incubated with BrdUrd to measure the incorporation of nucleotides following the addition of serum to determine the time of DNA replication onset. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with CDC34 antibodies and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The results indicate that the cells entered S phase between 13 to 16 h following serum stimulation, with the majority of cells undergoing DNA replication during the period 16–19 h post-serum stimulation (Fig. 1B). CDC34 immunoprecipitated from [35S]methionine-labeled cell extracts revealed that the steady-state level of CDC34 protein varied no more than 2-fold between quiescent cells (Fig. 1B, right upper panel, lane 1) and serum-stimulated cells (Fig.1B, right upper panel, lanes 2–4). Immunoprecipitation of CDC34 from [32P]orthophosphate-labeled extracts indicates that CDC34 is not appreciably phosphorylated in quiescent cells but is readily phosphorylated within 6 h following serum stimulation and remains phosphorylated at all time points during the cell cycle (Fig.1B, right lower panel). These results indicate that CDC34 is readily phosphorylated in proliferating cells but not highly phosphorylated in quiescent cells. To identify potential regulators of CDC34, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen (37Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). Full-length hCDC34 was cloned into plasmid pBTM116, resulting in the expression of a fusion protein between the activation domain of Lex A and hCDC34. This chimera was used to screen a normal human adult lung plasmid library expressing GAL4 DNA binding domain fusion proteins. Three strong positives were identified, all encoding the full-length hCK2β regulatory subunit. CK2 functions as a heterotetramer comprised of α and α′ forming the catalytic subunit and 2β subunits forming the regulatory subunit, which is primarily responsible for substrate binding (30Allende J.E. Allende C.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 31Pinna L.A. Meggio F. Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 1997; 3: 77-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). This result suggests that CDC34 is a potential substrate of CK2 or that CK2β may be a potential substrate of CDC34. To determine whether CK2β can interact directly with CDC34, we performed an in vitroco-immunoprecipitation assay using recombinant hCDC34 and in vitro translated hCK2β. The results show that hCK2β could be specifically co-immunoprecipitated with hCDC34, suggesting that these proteins interact in vitro (Fig.2A). A reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation experiment using in vitro translated hCDC34 and recombinant hCK2β also resulted in specific co-immunoprecipitation of the two proteins (data not shown). Efforts to identify the interacting domains of hCK2β and CDC34 by in vitro co-immunoprecipitation, indicated that the carboxyl terminus of CK2β was indispensable for CDC34 binding while domains within the central region of CDC34 appeared to be required for CK2β binding (data not shown). To examine whether CDC34 and CK2β can interact in vivo, 293 cells were transfected with HA-tagged hCDC34 and FLAG-tagged CK2β followed by immunoprecipitation with FLAG antibodies and immunoblot analysis with CDC34 antibodies. The result shows that both HA-hCDC34 and endogenous CDC34 co-precipitate with FLAG-hCK2β (Fig.2B). Western analysis of the transfected cell lysate showed two CDC34-immunoreactive bands representing HA-tagged and endogenous CDC34 (Fig. 2B). The reciprocal experiment was not possible, because the electrophoretic migration of FLAG-hCK2β is coincident with that of the immunoglobulin light chain. Transiently expressed hCK2β was observed to associate with endogenous CDC34 in the presence or absence of transiently co-expressed human CK2α (data not shown). These results demonstrate that CDC34 and CK2β interact both in vitro and in vivo in transiently transfected cells. To test whether hCDC34 may be a substrate of CK2, recombinant human CK2 was tested for its ability to phosphorylate recombinant CDC34 in vitro. To determine whether the phosphorylation of CDC34 was specific, several other proteins not previously shown to be CK2 substrates were tested in parallel for CK2 phosphorylation. Among those proteins tested for CK2 phosphorylation, including bovine serum albumin (BSA), lysozyme, chicken serum albumin, rabbit immunoglobulin, histone H1, glutathione S-transferase (GST), ubiquitin, aldolase, and catalase, only CDC34 was specifically phosphorylated by CK2 (Fig.3A, upper panel,lane 1). Importantly, human RAD6, a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme closely related to CDC34 by amino acid sequence, is not phosphorylated by CK2 (Fig. 3B, left panel,lane 2). Protein bands corresponding to the α and β subunits of CK2 were also observed to be phosphorylated in every sample due to the autophosphorylation activity exhibited by CK2 (43Meggio F. Brunati A.M. Pinna L.A. FEBS Lett. 1983; 160: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Coomassie Blue staining of the gels show that the proteins tested were present at quantities similar to CDC34 (Fig. 3A, lower panel and Fig. 3B, left panel). These results show that hCDC34 is phosphorylated by CK2 in vitroand suggests that CDC34 may be a bona fide substrate of CK2. These results do not exclude the possibility that the interaction between CDC34 and CK2β also may indicate that CK2β is a substrate of CDC34, although CDC34 is not generally believed to directly bind to its substrates. To address whether CK2β may be polyubiquitinated and proteolyzed in a CDC34-dependent manner, we measured the stability of [35S]methionine in vitrotranslated Xenopus CK2β in control- or CDC34-immunodepleted Xenopus interphase egg extract. Removal of CDC34 from egg extract was evaluated by immunoblotting with CDC34 antibody and by confirming the loss of DNA replication activity in extracts after CDC34 immunodepletion as described previously (7Yew P.R. Kirschner M.W. Science. 1997; 277: 1672-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) (data not shown). We observed little turnover of CK2β and no difference in the stability of CK2β in control- or CDC34-depleted extract suggesting CK2β is not ta"

Adjacent to the first repeat of the microtubule-binding domain is an RTPPKSP motif for binding SH3 domains. To identify SH3-containing proteins that interact with MAP-2, transfections, filter overlay assays, glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-mediated binding assays, co-immunoprecipitations and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were performed. Transfections of MAP-2a, MAP-2b, and MAP-2c constructs into COS7 cells, followed by incubation of the cell lysates with SH3-GST fusion proteins, determined that the strongest interaction was between MAP-2c and the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Fyn; however, MAP-2b and MAP-2c also bound to Grb2. Co-immunoprecipitation of Fyn and MAP-2c from human fetal homogenates confirmed the interaction in vivo. MAP-2 synthetic peptides spanning the RTPPKSP motif bound to Fyn, and the interaction was regulated by phosphorylation. Co-transfections with MAP-2c and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2) demonstrated that MAP-2c is threonine/serine-phosphorylated on its RTPPKSP motif and that threonine phosphorylation abolished the MAP-2c/Fyn binding. Kinase assays and co-transfection of MAP-2c and Fyn confirmed that Fyn tyrosine kinase phosphorylates MAP-2c. Thus, the activation of signaling pathways may regulate cytoskeletal dynamics by altering the state of phosphorylation of MAP-2 by both ERK2 and Fyn kinase.

In rodents, MAP-2b and MAP-2c are expressed during early fetal development, followed by a decline of MAP-2c and an increase of MAP-2a (10Binder L.I. Frankfurter A. Kim H. Caceres A. Payne M.R.

The most abundant high molecular weight MAP-2 isoforms, MAP-2a and MAP-2b, are composed of a large projection arm and a short microtubule-binding domain (MTBD). The low molecular weight isoforms MAP-2c and MAP-2d lack most of the projection arm of the high molecular weight forms, but retain the amino and carboxy portions of the molecule (13Garner C.C.

The proline-rich region consists of a stretch of PXXP motifs localized upstream of the first repeat of the MTBD. One of the PXXP repeats contains the sequence RTPPKSP, consistent with a class I ligand for the putative binding of SH3-containing proteins (17Morton C.J. Pugh D.J.R. Brown E.L.J. Kahmann J.D.

Some of the proteins containing SH3 domains include the Src family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases (NRTKs), adaptor proteins such as Grb2 and Nck, the Abl tyrosine kinase, PLCγ, and spectrin. Among the Src family of NRTKs expressed in the CNS, Src, Fyn, and Yes are enriched in growth cones and growing processes (20Umemori H. Wanaka A. Kato H. Takeuchi M. Tohyama M. Yamamoto T. Brain Res.

Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1209-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Fyn is abundantly expressed in neurons and oligodendrocytes, especially during process extension. In addition, Fyn is the only active NRTK in early oligodendrocyte development (23Osterhout D.J. Wolven A. Wolf R.M. Resh M.D. Chao M.V. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1209-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Rat primary cultures of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells either infected with a Fyn dominant-negative vector or treated with specific inhibitors have shortened oligodendrocyte processes (23Osterhout D.J. Wolven A. Wolf R.M. Resh M.D. Chao M.V. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1209-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). MAP-2 isoforms expressed in neurons and oligodendrocytes contain the RTPPKSP motif, and the domain is conserved in Tau. It has been shown that Tau binds Fyn, Src, and Lck through this motif (24Lee G. Newman S.T. Gard D.L. Band H. Panchamoorthy G. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3167-3177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting an important interaction between the structural MAPs and Fyn. To gain insight into the interaction between MAP-2 and SH3 ligands, we examined the binding of SH3-containing proteins to the RTPPKSP motif on MAP-2 isoforms and identified Fyn as a relevant interacting protein. We present biochemical evidence that Fyn can phosphorylate MAP-2c in vitro and in vivo and ERK2 can modulate the interaction by phosphorylating the RTPPKSP motif. The results depict another functional domain on MAP-2, and we speculate that this domain is capable of regulating cytoskeletal dynamics. Full-length human MAP-2c (pRC/CMV vector), full-length MAP-2b (pSV vector), full-length MAP-2a (pSV vector), and clone 900 (pcDNA3.1/His vector) cDNAs were constructed as previously described (8Kalcheva N.

Full-length human ERK2 cDNA (pCEP4L vector) was obtained from Dr. Melanie Cobb (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). Full-length human wild-type Fyn and full-length K299M mutant Fyn cDNAs (pCMV5 vector) were obtained from Dr. Marilyn Resh (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY). The procedure was performed as previously described (26Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene. 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5046) Google Scholar). Purification of the protein was confirmed by Western blot analysis with the GST-specific mAb DT-12. Full-length human MAP-2c (14Albala J.S. Kalcheva N. Shafit-Zagardo B. Gene. 1993; 136: 377-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) was cloned into the pQE-30 expression vector (Qiagen), and the construct was sequenced to verify the correct open reading frame. Induction of protein expression in bacteria and purification of 6xHis-tagged MAP-2c was performed as described by Qiagen, with some modifications. The salt concentration in the sonication buffer was increased to 500 mm NaCl. Following sonication and centrifugation the sample was boiled for 10 min and centrifuged again. The pH of the wash buffer was increased to 6.5, and the elution was done at pH 4.5. Purification of the protein was confirmed by Western blot analysis with the anti-MAP-2 mAb HM-2 (Sigma Chemical Co.). Varying amounts (1–30 µg) of purified GST fusion proteins from Fyn, Src, and full-length Grb2 and GST protein without an insert were loaded in 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). After protein transfer, the nitrocellulose membranes were incubated with bacterially expressed human MAP-2c (10 µg/ml in 5% milk in 1× TBS (140 mm NaCl, 1 mm Tris-HCl) for 2 h at room temperature (RT), extensively washed with 1× TBS and 0.1% Tween-20, incubated with the anti-MAP-2 mAb HM-2 (1:500; 2 h at RT), followed by IgG1-goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase conjugate (HRP) (1:10,000; 1 h at RT) and visualization by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The reverse experiment, where the bacterially expressed human MAP-2c was loaded on a gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and incubated with the different GST fusion proteins was also performed. COS7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in an 8% humidified CO2 atmosphere. For transient transfections, COS7 cells were plated at a density of 1 × 106 cells/100-mm dish the day before transfection. 5–10 µg of the respective cDNAs were mixed with LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) in serum-free medium as indicated in the manufacture's protocol. After 5 h the medium was replaced with complete medium. 24–48 h later the transfections were stopped. For total protein extraction, COS7-transfected cells were washed in 1× TBS, followed by addition of extraction buffer (1 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 2 µg/ml leupeptin, 4 µg/ml pepstatin, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 30 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 30 mm sodium fluoride, 0.1 mm AEBSF). All steps were performed on ice. The cells were scraped and centrifuged at 1,200 rpm in an Eppendorf centrifuge at 4 °C. Supernatants were discarded, and the pellets were resuspended in extraction buffer and placed at −70 °C for at least 30 min. The samples were thawed on ice, homogenized, and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm in an Eppendorf centrifuge for 5 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were saved, and the pellets were resuspended and reprocessed as described. Following centrifugation the supernatants were combined and protein quantification was performed (Bio-Rad protein assay). For heat-stable protein extraction, an aliquot of the total proteins was taken and NaCl (0.34 m final) and β-mercaptoethanol (0.28 m final) were added. The samples were boiled for 5 min, and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm in an Eppendorf centrifuge for 5 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were saved, and protein concentration was quantified. COS7 cells were lysed on ice in 1 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 30 mmβ-glycerolphosphate, 30 mm sodium fluoride, 2 µg/ml leupeptin, 4 µg/ml pepstatin, 0.1 mm AEBSF, and 0.5% Triton X-100. The homogenates were cleared by centrifugation (12,000 rpm in an Eppendorf centrifuge for 1 min), and the supernatants were incubated overnight at 4 °C with GST fusion proteins bound to glutathione-agarose beads. Subsequently, samples were washed 5× in extraction buffer, and 0.5% Triton X-100, pellets were resuspended in 1× sample and boiled, and the supernatants were separated in 10% SDS-PAGE. Fetal brain and spinal cord were obtained from elective terminations of pregnancies in the second trimester of gestation performed at affiliated hospitals of Albert Einstein College of Medicine. All studies were approved by the Clinical Investigation and the Health and Hospital Corporation of the City of New York. The brain and spinal cord used in this study were obtained from aborted fetuses of females without significant medical problems. Human fetal brain tissue (19 gestational weeks) was homogenized in extraction buffer at three times weight/volume and centrifuged at 22,900 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was saved, and the protein content was quantified. The brain protein homogenates were aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. Human fetal spinal cord tissue (20 gestational weeks) was dissected from the meninges and homogenized in extraction buffer as described for brain. The sample was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm in an Eppendorf centrifuge for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was retained, and protein quantification was performed. Protein homogenates from human fetal brain were thawed on ice and centrifuged at 250,000 × g for 25 min at 4 °C to eliminate association of microtubule-associated proteins with tubulin. 1 mg of the supernatant protein was mixed with extraction buffer and 0.5% Triton X-100 to a final volume of 1 ml and incubated with the GST fusion proteins as previously described. For the pull-down assays performed with the agarose-conjugated bacterially expressed and purified Fyn protein (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-4040), the volume was adjusted to 1 ml with immunoprecipitation buffer (IP, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, 2 µg/ml leupeptin, 4 µg/ml pepstatin, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 30 mmβ-glycerolphosphate, 30 mm sodium fluoride, 0.1 mm AEBSF, 0.5% Triton X-100). The samples were pre-cleared with 20 µl of resuspended protein-G PLUS-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) by incubation for 30 min at 4 °C followed by centrifugation at 5,000 rpm in an Eppendorf centrifuge for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were collected and incubated with either 10 µg of purified Fyn protein coupled to agarose or 10 µl of resuspended protein-G PLUS-agarose as a control, and rocked overnight at 4 °C. Following centrifugation the pellets were washed five times in the immunoprecipitation buffer, resuspended in 1× sample buffer, and boiled for 5 min, and the supernatants were separated in a 10% SDS-PAGE. One milligram of human fetal spinal cord protein homogenate was adjusted to 1 ml with IP buffer and processed similar to the brain homogenates with 10 µg of purified Fyn protein coupled to agarose or 10 µl of resuspended protein-G PLUS-agarose. For immunoprecipitations, transiently co-transfected COS7 cells were lysed on ice in IP buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 30 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 30 mm sodium fluoride, 0.1 mm AEBSF, 1 mm orthovanadate, 2 µg/ml leupeptin, 4 µg/ml pepstatin, and 0.5% Triton X-100), and all subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. Cellular debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm in an Eppendorf centrifuge for 10 min; the supernatants were precleared with 1 µg of the control IgG2b antibody plus 20 µl of resuspended protein-G PLUS-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), gently mixed for 30 min, and centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatants were immunoprecipitated with either 10 µg of the mAb 4G10, that recognizes phosphotyrosine residues, or a control IgG2b antibody, and mixed on a Nutator for at least 4 h. 20 µl of resuspended protein-G PLUS-agarose was added to the samples and rocked overnight. Following centrifugation, the pellets were washed five times in IP buffer, resuspended in 1× sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and centrifuged, and the supernatants were separated in a 10% SDS-PAGE. For co-immunoprecipitation studies, frozen human fetal brain homogenates were thawed on ice and centrifuged at 250,000 ×g for 25 min at 4 °C, and all subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. One milligram of the supernatant protein was adjusted to 1 ml with IP buffer, without orthovanadate, and 0.5% Triton X-100 final. The samples were pre-cleared with either 1 µg of an irrelevant IgG1 control antibody or 1 µg of rabbit serum, plus 20 µl of resuspended protein-G PLUS-agarose. The homogenates were gently mixed for 30 min and centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatants were incubated with either 10 µg of the anti-MAP-2 mAb HM-2 and an irrelevant IgG1 antibody as a control, or with the dual specific Fyn/Src polyclonal antibody and rabbit serum. The samples were mixed on a Nutator for 2 h, and then 20 µl of resuspended protein-G PLUS-agarose was added to the samples and rocked overnight. Following centrifugation, the pellets were washed five times in the IP buffer, resuspended in 1× sample buffer, and boiled, and the supernatants were separated in a 10% SDS-PAGE. Following 10% SDS-PAGE (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar), the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose (28Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44893) Google Scholar) and incubated with 5% non-fat dry milk in 1× TBS. After blocking, the membranes were incubated with the respective primary antibodies followed by HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. Visualization was by enhanced chemiluminescent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech or Pierce). When the Fyn mAb was used to determine if Fyn was co-immunoprecipitated with MAP-2, the membrane was first incubated with the secondary antibody to eliminate the reactivity with the IgGs that will interfere with the detection of Fyn, followed by the primary and secondary antibodies as usual. anti-MAP-2 mAb HM-2 (IgG1, Sigma) recognizes an amino-terminal epitope of all MAP-2 isoforms. Tau46 (IgG1, Zymed Laboratories Inc.) recognizes the carboxyl terminus of all MAP-2 isoforms and Tau. The monoclonal antibodies CP9 (phosphothreonine) (29Lu P.J. Wolf G. Zhou X.Z. Davies P. Lu K.P.

The dual specific Fyn/Src polyclonal antibody (anti-Src sc-18) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The sheep anti-human pp60c-src polyclonal antibody was from Chemicon International, Inc. The tyrosine-phosphorylated mAb 4G10 (IgG2b) was from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc. Mutant forms of human MAP-2c were made by polymerase chain reaction cloning as described under the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit instruction manual (Stratagene). The primers used to mutate residues (underlined) within the RTPPKSP motif on MAP-2 are: for the Thr/Ala mutation: GTCGCCATCATACGTGCTCCTCCAAAATCTCCTG (sense), CAGGAGATTTTGGAGGAGCACGTATGATGGCGAC (antisense); for the Ser/Ala mutation: CGTACTCCTCCAAAAGCTCCTGCGACTACTCCC (sense), GGGAGTAGTCGCAGGAGCTTTTGGAGGAGTACG (antisense). The amplification protocol consisted of 18 cycles of the following conditions: denaturation for 0.3 min at 95 °C (the first cycle was 0.6 min), primer annealing for 1 min at 55 °C, chain extension for 20 min at 68 °C, and an extra 20 min for the last cycle. Both constructs were sequenced to verify the correct open reading frames and the mutation sites. The MAP-2, Tau, and the irrelevant synthetic peptides (Table I) were synthesized with a biotin tag at the amino terminus and bound to neutravidin-coated ELISA plates at 20 ng/well in 2% bovine serum albumin, for 1 h at RT. Excess peptide was washed off and the plates were incubated overnight at 4 °C with either SH3-Fyn GST fusion protein or GST without insert in 2% bovine serum albumin at 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2 µg/well, respectively. Binding was detected by incubation with the anti-GST mAb DT-12 (1:100; 1.5 h), followed by goat anti-mouse IgG1-HRP (1:500; 1 h) and horseradish peroxidase substrates A and B (ABTS substrate, Bio-Rad, 30 min). Optical densities were recorded at 405 nm with an ELISA reader (TECAN). The experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated three times. Two-way analysis of variance statistical analysis was performed.Table ISynthetic peptides spanning the RTPPKSP motif on MAP-2 and TauMAP-2 peptidesRP: SEKKVAIIRTPPKSPATRA: SEKKVAIIRTPAKSPATAP: SEKKVAIIA TPPKSPATAA: SEKKVAIIA TPAKSPAT02: SEKKVAIIRTPPKSP GL03: SEKKVAIIRTPPKSP GL (phospho-Thr)Tau peptides813: EPKKVAVVRTPPKSPSS1085: EPKKVAVVRTPPKSPSS (phospho-Thr)Irrelevant Tau phosphopeptide935: DTSPRHLSNVSSTGS (phospho-Ser)The MAP-2, Tau, and the irrelevant synthetic peptides were synthesized with a biotin tag at the amino terminus and were used in ELISAs to study the interaction with the SH3 domain of Fyn.

Open table in a new tab The MAP-2, Tau, and the irrelevant synthetic peptides were synthesized with a biotin tag at the amino terminus and were used in ELISAs to study the interaction with the SH3 domain of Fyn. The RTPPKSP motif is marked in boldface, and mutations and phosphorylations areunderlined. Bacterially expressed human 6xHis-tagged MAP-2c (1.8 µg) was incubated with 2.5 units of Fyn tyrosine kinase (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) according to manufacture's protocol using a reaction volume of 20 µl and incubation at 37 °C for 90 min; the reaction was performed without radioactivity. Kinase reactions were immunoblotted with the phosphotyrosine mAb 4G10. To examine the MAP-2 isoforms that interact with the SH3 domain of the NRTKs Fyn and Src and the adaptor protein Grb2, cDNAs to human MAP-2c, MAP-2b, MAP-2a, and clone 900, consisting of the last 900 bp of MAP-2, were transiently transfected into COS7 cells. Cell lysates were incubated with the SH3-Fyn, SH3-Src, or full-length Grb2-GST fusion proteins coupled to glutathione-agarose beads. Immunoblotting with the anti-MAP-2 mAb HM-2 indicated that MAP-2a did not interact with any of the GST fusion proteins (Fig.1A, top panel). MAP-2b showed a stronger interaction with Grb2 than Fyn (Fig.1 B, top panel), whereas MAP-2c showed a very strong interaction with Fyn, an interaction with Grb2, and a minimal to no interaction with Src (Fig. 1 C, top panel). Clone 900 interacted strongly with Fyn and Grb2-GST fusion proteins (Fig. 1 D, top panel), demonstrating that the interaction between MAP-2 and the fusion proteins occurs within a region encompassing the last 900 bp of MAP-2. This region of the molecule contains a putative class I SH3 binding domain, the RTPPKSP motif, and the repeats of the MTBD. To confirm that the lanes contained equal amounts of fusion proteins, the blots were stripped and reincubated with the mAb DT-12, an antibody specific to the GST region of the fusion protein (Fig. 1, A–D, lower panels). In addition to examining Fyn, Src, and Grb2, interaction of MAP-2 with SH3-GST fusion protein from neuronal Src, Lyn, Lck, Crk, Abl, Nck, PLCγ, and spectrin were examined, and all the interactions were negative (data not shown). To further examine the interaction of MAP-2c with Fyn, Src, and Grb2, bacterially expressed human MAP-2c was incubated with varying amounts of nitrocellulose-bound GST fusion proteins expressing SH3-Fyn, SH3-Src, and full-length Grb2. As shown in Fig.2, MAP-2c bound in a concentration-dependent manner to all of the fusion proteins; however, MAP-2c binding to Fyn was much stronger than to Src or Grb2. Minimal to no binding was observed with GST protein without insert. The reverse experiment, where varying amounts of bacterially expressed human MAP-2c were bound to nitrocellulose membranes and incubated with the respective GST fusion proteins, gave the same results (data not shown). GST-mediated binding assays were performed with human fetal brain and the SH3 domains of Fyn, Src, and full-length Grb2-GST fusion proteins to examine the interactions between the GST fusion proteins with the brain endogenous MAPs. As shown in Fig.3A, MAP-2c was the predominant MAP-2 form interacting with SH3-Fyn and Grb2; MAP-2c did not efficiently interact with SH3-Src. Consistent with the data shown in Fig. 1 B, MAP-2b interacted with Grb2. To confirm that the lanes contained equal amounts of fusion proteins, the blots were stripped and reincubated with the GST-specific DT-12 mAb (Fig.3 A, lower panel). As a result of the strong Fyn and MAP-2c binding, we focused our studies on this interaction. To confirm the MAP-2c interaction observed with the Fyn-SH3 domain, purified Fyn protein coupled to agarose was incubated with human fetal brain homogenate. As shown in Fig. 3 B, only MAP-2c was present in the proteins associating with Fyn, further supporting an interaction between these proteins in the human fetal CNS. To explore an in vivointeraction between MAP-2c and Fyn or Src in brain we used the anti-MAP-2 HM-2 mAb and determined that Fyn was co-immunoprecipitated (Fig. 4A, upper panel). A Src-specific polyclonal antibody (Chemicon) did not detect Src, indicating that Src did not co-immunoprecipitate with MAP-2c (data not shown). As expected, incubation of the membrane with the anti-MAP-2 mAb confirmed the presence of MAP-2 in the pellet (Fig.4 A, lower panel). The MAP-2c/Fyn interaction was further confirmed by immunoprecipitations performed with a carboxy-terminal polyclonal antibody that recognizes Fyn and Src (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). As shown in Fig. 4 B, upper panel, this dual-specific antibody immunoprecipitated MAP-2c and Fyn (determined with a specific mAb that does not cross-react with Src; Fig. 4 B, lower panel). Fyn antibodies that recognized epitopes at the amino terminus of the protein failed to immunoprecipitate MAP-2 from human fetal brain homogenates (data not shown), and we speculate that the binding of MAP-2 to Fyn might prevent the binding of these amino-terminal-specific antibodies to Fyn.

https://openalex.org/W2046177551,"One of the rate-limiting steps in protein folding has been shown to be the cis-trans isomerization of proline residues, which is catalyzed by a range of peptidylprolylcis-trans isomerases. To characterize the interaction between model peptides and the periplasmic peptidylprolylcis-trans isomerase SurA from E. coli, we employed a chemical cross-linking strategy that has been used previously to elucidate the interaction of substrates with other folding catalysts. The interaction between purified SurA and model peptides was significant in that it showed saturation and was abolished by denaturation of SurA; however the interaction was independent of the presence of proline residues in the model peptides. From results obtained by limited proteolysis we conclude that an N-terminal fragment of SurA, comprising 150 amino acids that do not contain the active sites involved in the peptidylprolyl cis-transisomerization, is essential for the binding of peptides by SurA. This was confirmed by probing the interaction of the model peptide with the recombinant N-terminal fragment, expressed in Escherichia coli. Hence we propose that, similar to protein disulfide isomerase and other folding catalysts, SurA exhibits a modular architecture composed of a substrate binding domain and distinct catalytically active domains.

However, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of protein folding and hence protein misfolding is far from being complete. Folding catalysts have been identified that facilitate specific isomerization steps that would otherwise limit the rate of polypeptide folding. Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI)1 catalyzes the formation, isomerization, and reduction of disulfide bonds (for review see Ref. 1Freedman R.B. Klappa P. Bukau B. Molecular Chaperones and Protein Folding. Harwood Academic Press, London1999: 437-459Google Scholar), and peptidylprolyl cis-trans isomerases (PPIases) accelerate the rate of conformational interconversions around proline residues in polypeptides in vitro (2Bang H. Pecht A. Raddatz G. Scior T. Solbach W. Brune K. Pahl A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3270-3280Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 3Fischer G. Tradler T. Zarnt T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 17-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). PPIases are ubiquitous in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes (4Maruyama T. Furutani M. Front Biosci. 2000; 5: D821-D836PubMed Google Scholar, 5Schiene C. Fischer G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 40-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar); however, their biological significance remains elusive. Three classes of PPIases have been identified so far: the cyclophilins, the FK506-binding proteins, and PPIases that have sequence homology with the catalytic domain of parvulin (3Fischer G. Tradler T. Zarnt T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 17-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Some PPIases are thought to have separate substrate binding domains structurally distinct from their catalytic domains (6Zarnt T. Tradler T. Stoller G. Scholz C. Schmid F.X. Fischer G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 827-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and hence it has been postulated that these folding catalysts also can exert chaperone-like activities. Trigger factor, a bacterial cytoplasmic PPIase, was found to have two domains at the N and C terminus that did not influence catalytic activity but are essential for substrate binding (6Zarnt T. Tradler T. Stoller G. Scholz C. Schmid F.X. Fischer G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 827-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). FkpA, a periplasmic PPIase, was found to assist the folding of single-chain antibody fragments (scFv) independent of its PPIase activity. It appeared that FkpA was able to interact with early folding intermediates to prevent aggregation and also interact with unfolded or partially aggregated proteins to prevent irreversible aggregation and facilitate their reactivation (7Bothmann H. Plückthun A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17100-17105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 8Ramm K. Plückthun A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17106-17113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Interestingly, FkpA had this chaperone effect also on scFv antibody fragments that did not contain any proline residues. In contrast, the coexpression of the periplasmic PPIase SurA produced no increase in the functional scFv fragment level in the periplasm (7Bothmann H. Plückthun A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17100-17105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 8Ramm K. Plückthun A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17106-17113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). SurA was originally isolated as a protein product of stationary phase survival genes of Escherichia coli (9Tormo A. Almiron M. Kolter R. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4339-4347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Lazar S.W. Kolter R. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1770-1773Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Lazar S.W. Almiron M. Tormo A. Kolter R. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5704-5711Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Null mutants of SurA resulted in loss of cell viability after 3–5 days of incubation, leading to the conclusion that SurA was essential for stationary phase survival (11Lazar S.W. Almiron M. Tormo A. Kolter R. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5704-5711Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sequence analysis revealed that SurA contained two domains with strong homology to parvulin, and from this finding it was inferred that SurA has PPIase activity (10Lazar S.W. Kolter R. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1770-1773Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Missiakas D. Betton J.M. Raina S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 871-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 13Scholz C. Stoller G. Zarnt T. Fischer G. Schmid F.X. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 54-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Further functional studies were carried out, and it was concluded that SurA was important in maintaining outer membrane integrity probably through the binding of peptidoglycans (10Lazar S.W. Kolter R. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1770-1773Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Lazar S.W. Almiron M. Tormo A. Kolter R. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5704-5711Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was also found that those null mutants, or mutants with decreased amounts of SurA in the periplasm resulted in a decrease in the folding of the maltose-inducible porin Lam B (11Lazar S.W. Almiron M. Tormo A. Kolter R. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5704-5711Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This led to the conclusion that SurA was important not only in maintaining outer membrane integrity but also in catalyzing the folding of other outer membrane proteins (12Missiakas D. Betton J.M. Raina S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 871-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). To address the question of the nature of the interaction between SurA and its substrates we used chemical cross-linkers, powerful tools to study interactions between proteins, which can be applied to proteins available in small amounts even in crude cell extracts (14Klappa P. Hawkins H.C. Freedman R.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 15Klappa P. Ruddock L.W. Darby N.J. Freedman R.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 927-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Here we report the results of our recent studies using chemical cross-linking of purified SurA and its fragments to model peptides, which mimic substrates. “Scrambled” ribonuclease A, the homobifunctional cross-linking reagent disuccinimidyl glutarate (DSG), Juglon, and all other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Cyclosporin A and FK506 were from Calbiochem. 125I-Bolton-Hunter labeling reagent, enhanced chemiluminescence reagent, and x-ray films were purchased fromAmersham Pharmacia Biotech. N-Hydroxysuccinimidyl biotin and streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugates were from Pierce. The somatostatin derivative without cysteine residues (Δ-somatostatin, Ala-Gly-Ser-Lys-Asn-Phe-Phe-Trp-Lys-Thr-Phe-Thr-Ser-Ser) and peptide P (Phe-Thr-Glu-Gln-Thr-Ala-Pro-Lys-Ile-Phe-Gly-Gly-Glu-Ile-Lys) were synthesized as described previously for other peptides (16Klappa P. Mayinger P. Pipkorn R. Zimmermann M. Zimmermann R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2795-2803Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). 125I-Bolton-Hunter labeling of Δ-somatostatin was performed as recommended by the manufacturer. Scrambled ribonuclease A was biotinylated withN-hydroxysuccinimidyl biotin as described by the manufacturer. Bovine liver PDI was purified as described previously (17Freedman R.B. Hawkins H.C. McLaughlin S.H. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 397-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The gene encoding SurA was amplified from theE. coli genome by polymerase chain reaction using the following primers. Forward primer, 5′-TTTTTTTTCATATGGCCCCCCAGGTAGTCGATAAAGTCG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TTTTTTTTCTCGAGCTATTAGTTGCTCAGGATTTTAA- CGTAGGC-3′. For the amplification of the N-terminal fragment (Ala21–Arg133) the following primers were used. Forward primer, 5′-TAATAATACATATGGCCCCCCAGGTAGTCGATAAAGTCGCAG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TAATAA- TAGTCGACTTATTAGCGGATCTGGTTACGATAGGTGTTGTAGTTC-3′. For the amplification of the fragment without the N terminus (Asp169–Asn428) the following primers were used. Forward primer, 5′-TAATAATACATATGGACGCCAGCACTGAGCTGAACCTGAGC; reverse primer, 5′-TAATAATAGTCGACTTATTAGTTGCTCAGGATTTTAACGT- AGGCGCTGGC-3′. These primers allowed the insertion of a NdeI site at the N terminus and a SalI site at the C terminus. The primers complementary to the 3′-end included a stop codon. The inserts were cloned between the NdeI and SalI site of pLWRP51, a modified pET23d vector, which contained an insert coding for an initiating methionine residue followed by a hexahistidine tag. 2L. W. Ruddock, unpublished results. Protein production was carried out inE. coli strain BL21(DE3) carrying the pLysS plasmid to control leak-through expression and to allow subsequent cell lysis by freeze thawing. For the production of full-length SurA and its fragments, E. coli BL21(DE3)-pLysS was transformed with the corresponding plasmid-DNA. The cells were incubated at 37 °C in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Three hours after induction with 1 mmisopropyl-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside the cells were harvested by centrifugation. For the purification of full-length SurA, the cell pellet was suspended in buffer A (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.3), and DNase to a final concentration of 10 μg/ml was added. After freezing and thawing the suspension twice, the lysate was centrifuged at 12000 × g for 30 min. The filter-sterilized supernatant was loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (12-ml volume, Qiagen), which, after activation with NiSO4, was equilibrated with buffer A. Unspecifically bound proteins were removed by washing the column with buffer A containing 500 mm NaCl and 50 mm imidazole, followed by buffer A. Recombinant SurA was eluted with buffer A containing 10 mm EDTA. The elution fraction was loaded onto a ResourceQ column (6 ml, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with buffer A and eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 0.5 m NaCl in buffer A. Fractions containing homogenous SurA were pooled and dialyzed against 10 mmphosphate buffer, pH 7.2. Purified SurA was incubated with chymotrypsin (30 μg/ml) for 30 min at 0 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 10 mm PMSF and subsequent incubation for 5 min at 0 °C. After precipitation with trichloroacetic acid, the radiolabeled Δ-somatostatin was dissolved in distilled water. Labeled Δ-somatostatin (approximately 30 μm) or biotinylated scrambled RNase (approximately 50 μm) was added to buffer B (100 mm NaCl, 25 mm KCl, 25 mmsodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5) containing purified SurA or PDI (approximately 2 mg/ml) or E. coli lysates containing full-length SurA or fragments of it. The samples (10 μl) were incubated for 10 min on ice before cross-linking (14Klappa P. Hawkins H.C. Freedman R.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Cross-linking was performed using the homobifunctional cross-linking reagent DSG (18Ruddock L.W. Freedman R.B. Klappa P. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 758-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The samples were supplied with one-fifth volume of cross-linking solution (2.5 mm DSG in buffer B). The reaction was carried out for 60 min at 0 °C. Cross-linking was stopped by the addition of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer (18Ruddock L.W. Freedman R.B. Klappa P. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 758-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The samples were subjected to electrophoresis in 10, 12.5, or 17.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels with subsequent autoradiography. For protein sequencing the proteins were electrotransferred onto polyvinylidine difluoride membranes and subjected to N-terminal Edman degradation (492 Protein Sequencer, Applied Biosystems). Biotinylated products were detected using streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugates. The detection was carried out with enhanced chemiluminescence reagent. Chemical cross-linking of radiolabeled peptides has been successfully employed to study the interactions between various folding catalysts, specifically members of the protein disulfide isomerase family, and small peptides. Here we extended our studies and asked whether this technique can also be employed to study the interactions between the periplasmic PPIase SurA and peptides. To this aim125I-Bolton-Hunter-labeled peptide P was cross-linked to purified SurA (Fig. 1 A), using the chemical cross-linker DSG. Purified bovine liver PDI served as a positive control whereas a sample without SurA or PDI, supplemented only with buffer, served as a negative control (lanes 5 and6). In the absence of DSG, no cross-linking products could be detected (lanes 1–4). In the presence of purified SurA a single cross-linking product with an apparent molecular mass of 48 kDa could be observed (lane 10). This indicates that a radiolabeled model peptide containing a proline residue can be cross-linked to purified SurA. To address the question whether or not the interaction between SurA and peptides depends on the presence of proline residues in the peptide, we used another radiolabeled model peptide, Δ-somatostatin (Δ-SRIF). As with the proline-containing peptide, a cross-linking product could be detected (lane 9), indicating that the interaction of SurA with peptides does not depend on the presence of proline residues in the peptide. From these data we conclude that peptides without proline residues can be cross-linked specifically to purified SurA. After heat inactivation of purified SurA (5 min at 95 °C) prior to chemical cross-linking, the interaction between Δ-somatostatin and SurA was strongly inhibited (Fig. 1 B). Thus, the interaction of radiolabeled Δ-somatostatin with purified SurA depended on its native conformation. Chemical cross-linking after increasing the concentration of radiolabeled Δ-somatostatin while keeping the concentration of purified SurA constant (2 μm) revealed that there was saturation of binding at concentrations above 45 μm (Fig.2 A). To reveal the nature of the interaction between SurA and non-proline-containing peptides, radiolabeled Δ-somatostatin was chemically cross-linked to purified SurA in the absence or presence of Triton X-100. Purified PDI, the interaction of which with peptides is inhibited in the presence of Triton X-100, served as a positive control. As with PDI, the binding of radiolabeled Δ-somatostatin to purified SurA was completely abolished in the presence of Triton X-100 (Fig. 2 B). This experiment clearly demonstrates that the interaction of SurA, like PDI, with peptides is detergent-sensitive and presumably relies on hydrophobic interactions. Chemical cross-linking of 10 μm radiolabeled Δ-somatostatin to purified SurA was reduced in the presence of an excess (100 μm) of unlabeled Δ-somatostatin (Δ-SRIF) or peptide P (Fig.3 A). This experiment demonstrates that the interaction between SurA and radiolabeled peptides is not due to an unspecific binding of peptides via the125I-Bolton-Hunter labeling reagent. To further investigate whether SurA interacts with misfolded proteins as well as with model peptides, we performed chemical cross-linking of radiolabeled Δ-somatostatin (10 μm) to purified SurA in the presence of an excess of unlabeled scrambled ribonuclease A (scRNase) (100 μm). Fig. 3 A clearly shows that unlabeled scrambled ribonuclease A competed with radiolabeled Δ-somatostatin for the binding to SurA, and hence we conclude that a misfolded protein and a small peptide interact with the same principal binding site in SurA. This was confirmed when biotinylated scrambled ribonuclease A was used as a substrate for SurA. As with radiolabeled peptides, a single cross-linking product could be observed, the intensity of which was strongly reduced in the presence of a 10-fold excess of unlabeled Δ-somatostatin (Fig. 3 B). This demonstrates that the interaction is independent of the identity of the cross-linked substrate or its method of labeling. When an excess of unlabeled Δ-somatostatin (S) was added to purified SurA simultaneously (Fig.4, lane 4) or before125I-Bolton-Hunter-labeled Δ-somatostatin (S*) was added (lane 3), the same decrease in the intensities of the cross-linking products could be observed as when unlabeled Δ-somatostatin (S) was added after preincubation with radiolabeled Δ-somatostatin (lane 2). Thus we conclude that the interaction between SurA and somatostatin is reversible. SurA shows a modular architecture consisting of an N-terminal region with no significant similarities to other E. coli proteins and two parvulin-like domains (Fig.5 B). From the observation that the parvulin-specific inhibitor Juglon (19Hennig L. Christner C. Kipping M. Schelbert B. Rucknagel K.P. Grabley S. Kullertz G. Fischer G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5953-5960Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) had no effect on the binding of radiolabeled Δ-somatostatin (data not shown), we hypothesized that the activity of the parvulin-like domains is not required for peptide binding. To further investigate the peptide binding site, purified SurA was pretreated with chymotrypsin, and after stopping the protease activity with PMSF, the products were cross-linked to radiolabeled Δ-somatostatin. We consistently observed a double band with an approximate molecular mass of 32 kDa (O in Fig.5 A, lane 4). When these fragments were probed by cross-linking of radiolabeled Δ-somatostatin, we did not detect any significant interaction between them and radiolabeled Δ-somatostatin (Fig. 5 A, lane 8). Full-length SurA that was not proteolytically cleaved, however, still showed binding of radiolabeled Δ-somatostatin indicating that the conditions did not affect cross-linking in general. This was confirmed by using control samples in which SurA was incubated with PMSF alone (lane 6) or PMSF-inactivated chymotrypsin (lane 7) prior to cross-linking. The N-terminal amino acid sequences of both bands were determined and compared with the sequence of SurA (Fig. 5 B). Both fragments contained the two parvulin-like domains but were devoid of the N-terminal 108 and 116 amino acids, respectively. These results indicate very clearly that the N-terminal part of SurA is required for the interaction with radiolabeled Δ-somatostatin. To confirm this result, we cloned and expressed the N-terminal fragment of SurA (Ala21–Arg133) and the fragment containing the parvulin domains (Asp169-Asn428). The expression of both fragments, as well as full-length SurA (Ala21–Asn428), resulted in soluble products (data not shown) that were probed for their interaction with radiolabeled Δ-somatostatin without purification from the E. coli lysates. Fig. 6 shows that radiolabeled Δ-somatostatin could be cross-linked to full-length SurA and the N-terminal fragment but did not interact with the C-terminal fragment containing the two parvulin domains. These results clearly indicate that the N-terminal fragment of SurA is essential and sufficient for the interaction with model peptides. Although the folding of many proteins can occur spontaneously, the folding of other proteins requires the assistance of folding catalysts and molecular chaperones. Molecular chaperones bind to partially folded intermediates in nascent polypeptide chains or newly synthesized proteins in a reversible process to prevent aggregation and misfolding. Folding catalysts enhance the rate of certain rate-limiting steps,e.g. formation and isomerization of disulfide bonds and thecis-trans isomerization of peptidylprolyl residues, to ensure that efficient folding occurs (1Freedman R.B. Klappa P. Bukau B. Molecular Chaperones and Protein Folding. Harwood Academic Press, London1999: 437-459Google Scholar, 3Fischer G. Tradler T. Zarnt T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 17-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). There is increasing interest in elucidating the underlying principles of protein folding and the mechanisms by which molecular chaperones and folding catalysts interact with their substrates; however, those interactions are still poorly understood. To reveal the nature of the interaction between the purified PPIase SurA from E. coli and its substrates, we employed a cross-linking approach, which we had used previously to determine the interaction between peptides and other folding catalysts (14Klappa P.

We found that the 14-amino acid peptide Δ-somatostatin, which does not contain proline residues, and peptide P, a proline-containing peptide, after 125I-Bolton-Hunter radiolabeling can be chemically cross-linked to purified SurA using an homobifunctional cross-linker, specific for the N terminus or the ε-amino group of lysine residues. To validate the cross-linking approach and to demonstrate that the interaction between SurA and model peptides was specific we performed various control experiments and compared the results with previous findings obtained for the specific interaction between model peptides and purified PDI (14Klappa P. Hawkins H.C. Freedman R.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). As with purified PDI, the interaction between radiolabeled peptides and SurA was abolished after heat denaturation of purified SurA prior to cross-linking, indicating that the interaction required native SurA. We found that the interaction between SurA and a model peptide was independent of the presence of a proline residue within the peptide. This result is in line with the findings of Scholz et al. (23Scholz C. Mucke M. Rape M. Pecht A. Pahl A. Bang H. Schmid F.X. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 723-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), who showed very clearly that the PPIase trigger factor recognizes protein substrates independently of proline residues (23Scholz C. Mucke M. Rape M. Pecht A. Pahl A. Bang H. Schmid F.X. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 723-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These observations are not limited to PPIases, and similar results were obtained with purified PDI, which is a potent catalyst of disulfide bond formation and isomerization in the ER. Using chemical cross-linkers we showed previously that PDI interacts with model peptides and that this interaction is independent of the presence of cysteine residues within the model peptide (14Klappa P. Hawkins H.C. Freedman R.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). It appears that folding catalysts in general interact with a range of model peptides, even if those peptides do not contain the amino acids the folding catalysts act on. When radiolabeled Δ-somatostatin was cross-linked to a crude cell extract of E. coli overexpressing SurA, cross-linking of the peptides to SurA still could be observed (Fig. 6). This is similar to results obtained when crude cell extracts of E. colioverexpressing PDI were used (15Klappa P. Ruddock L.W. Darby N.J. Freedman R.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 927-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The binding of radiolabeled peptides to purified SurA showed saturation, and as with purified PDI (14Klappa P. Hawkins H.C. Freedman R.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), cross-linking of radiolabeled Δ-somatostatin to purified SurA could be inhibited by the addition of unlabeled Δ-somatostatin. Half-maximal intensity of the cross-linking product was observed at a 1:1 ratio of unlabeled:radiolabeled Δ-somatostatin (data not shown), indicating that the interaction with purified SurA was not due to an unspecific binding of the radiolabeled Δ-somatostatin via the125I-Bolton-Hunter labeling reagent. The interaction between SurA and Δ-somatostatin prior to cross-linking was found to be reversible, as demonstrated by the addition of unlabeled Δ-somatostatin to SurA, which has been preincubated with radiolabeled Δ-somatostatin. Unlabeled Δ-somatostatin displaced radiolabeled Δ-somatostatin indicating that the interaction between SurA and peptides is highly dynamic, which is very similar to results obtained previously for purified PDI (14Klappa P. Hawkins H.C. Freedman R.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). As with PDI (14Klappa P. Hawkins H.C. Freedman R.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) we observed that the interaction between SurA and radiolabeled peptides is sensitive to Triton X-100. Although we cannot completely exclude the possibility that Triton X-100 interferes with the structure of the N-terminal fragment of SurA, this detergent is widely used for the functional recovery of intracellular soluble and membrane-bound proteins, and hence this sensitivity suggests that hydrophobic interactions play an important role in the initial binding of peptides to SurA. When scrambled ribonuclease A was used in a competition experiment, we found that this inhibited the interaction between radiolabeled Δ-somatostatin and SurA, similar to the inhibition observed with purified PDI (14Klappa P. Hawkins H.C. Freedman R.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We also observed that the interaction between biotinylated scrambled ribonuclease A and SurA could be inhibited by an excess of unlabeled Δ-somatostatin, which indicates an interaction with the same principal binding site in SurA. Taken together, these data indicate that there is specific binding of Δ-somatostatin and other peptides and that this models the interaction of protein substrates with SurA. To investigate whether the peptide binding site of SurA resides in the catalytically active site involved in peptidylprolyl cis-transisomerization, we performed experiments using limited proteolysis. Our results show very clearly that under the chosen conditions the first 108 and 116 amino acids, respectively, excluding the signal sequence, were protease-sensitive. The catalytic activity of SurA resides only in the C-terminal of the two parvulin-like domains (24Behrens S. Maier R. de Cock H. Schmid F.X. Gross C.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar); nevertheless, a fragment comprising both domains was comparatively resistant to protease treatment. When cross-linking experiments with radiolabeled Δ-somatostatin were carried out, we observed that this stable fragment of SurA did not show binding activity, indicating that the N-terminal, protease-sensitive fragment is required for peptide binding. To confirm this result we cloned and overexpressed the N-terminal fragment and the C-terminal fragment containing the two parvulin-like domains in E. coli. Cross-linking of radiolabeled Δ-somatostatin was only observed with the N terminus of SurA, confirming that this fragment is essential and sufficient for the efficient binding of model peptides. This observation is in excellent agreement with the results obtained recently by Behrens et al. (24Behrens S. Maier R. de Cock H. Schmid F.X. Gross C.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). They showed that a 24-kDa fragment of SurA, comprising the first 150 N-terminal amino acids fused to the 43 amino acids of the very C terminus of SurA, has a PPIase-independent chaperone activity and can complement the in vivo activity of intact SurA. It was speculated that the 43 amino acids from the C terminus of SurA stabilized the fragment containing the 150 N-terminal amino acids but were not otherwise involved in the overall chaperone activity of the fragment (24Behrens S. Maier R. de Cock H. Schmid F.X. Gross C.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The fragment that we used in our studies was devoid of this C-terminal extension, confirming the assumption that the C-terminal residues are not essential for peptide binding. Together these results show very clearly that substrate binding and PPIase activities of SurA are in distinct domains of the protein. This is very similar to the situation in some other folding catalysts,e.g. PDI (25Kemmink J. Darby N.J. Dijkstra K. Nilges M. Creighton T.E. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 239-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) and the PPIase trigger factor from E. coli. These proteins clearly exhibit a modular structure with distinct and separate sites for protein binding and catalytic activities (13Scholz C. Stoller G. Zarnt T. Fischer G. Schmid F.X. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 54-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) located in different structural domains (6Zarnt T. Tradler T. Stoller G. Scholz C. Schmid F.X. Fischer G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 827-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Interestingly, however, Ramm and Plückthun 3K. Ramm and A. Plückthun, personal communication. observed that the chaperone activity of FkpA appeared to reside in the PPIase domain. The picture that now emerges is that in many folding catalysts domains that are specialized in a specific chemical isomerization activity are linked in sequence to domains dedicated to the binding of peptides or unfolded proteins. The combination provides for efficient catalysis of protein folding linked to disulfide isomerization and peptidylprolylcis-trans isomerization, respectively.

In addition, they have a depletion of CD5+ (B1) lymphocytes and defective IgG class switching. This phenotype is reminiscent of that observed in mice null for the cell cycle regulatory protein, cyclin D2. We demonstrate here that the inability of vav−/− B cells to proliferate in response to BCR ligation is due to an inability to induce cyclin D2. In addition, we show that the proliferative defect of these cells occurs after the cells have entered early G1phase. Analyses of potential down-stream signaling intermediates revealed differential activation of the stress-activated MAP kinases in the absence of Vav, normal activation of the ERK, MAPK, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathways, and defective intracellular calcium mobilization. We further demonstrate that intracellular calcium homeostasis is required for cyclin D2 induction, implicating a possible link with the defective calcium response ofvav−/− B cells and their inability to induce cyclin D2.

Vav is rapidly phosphorylated following stimulation of the antigen receptors in B and T lymphocytes and integrates signals from antigen receptors and co-stimulatory molecules (CD19 in B cells and CD28 in T cells) (4O'Rourke L.M.

Several protein-interaction domains are present in Vav, including the GEF catalytic Dbl domain, a Src homology 2 (SH2) domain, two SH3 domains, a calponin homology domain, and a pleckstrin homology domain. Analyses of vav−/− mice have demonstrated an important role for Vav in lymphocyte development and proliferation (6Tarakhovsky A. Turner M. Schaal S. Mee P.J. Duddy L.P. Rajewsky K. Tybulewicz V.L. Nature. 1995; 374: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar,7Zhang R. Alt F.W. Davidson L. Orkin S.H. Swat W. Nature. 1995; 374: 470-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Defects in T cell selection in the thymus, and in the production of peripheral T cells were observed in Vav-deficient mice (8Turner M. Mee P.J. Walters A.E. Quinn M.E. Mellor A.L. Zamoyska R. Tybulewicz V.L. Immunity. 1997; 7: 451-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Vav is essential for T cell receptor capping and actin polymerization (9Fischer K.D. Kong Y.Y. Nishina H. Tedford K. Marengere L.E. Kozieradzki I. Sasaki T. Starr M. Chan G. Gardener S. Nghiem M.P. Bouchard D. Barbacid M. Bernstein A. Penninger J.M. Curr.

A failure of interleukin-2 production by Vav-deficient T cells was demonstrated to be the molecular basis for this proliferative defect. Recent data shows that Vav has in important role in setting the threshold for antigen receptor-mediated activation of B lymphocytes, which is likely due to its regulation of receptor clustering (11Bachmann M.F. Nitschke L. Krawczyk C. Tedford K. Ohashi P.S. Fischer K.D. Penninger J.M. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 137-142PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, increased degrees of antigen receptor cross-linking could partially reverse the proliferative defect in the anti-IgM response ofvav−/−-deficient B cells. Vav is also implicated in efficient T help-dependent IgG class switching, and in antibody responses to T cell-dependent hapten antigens. In addition, Vav-deficient mice exhibit a defect in the development of peritoneal CD5+ (B1) B lymphocytes, a phenotype also observed in mice lacking the Vav-interacting CD19 (12Rickert R.C.

However, Vav is not essential for CD40, interleukin-4, or LPS-induced B cell activation, and vav−/− mice mount normal B cell responses to T cell-independent repetitive viral and polyvalent hapten antigens. Cell proliferation requires successful transition through cell cycle check-points. The D-type cyclins (cyclins D1, D2, and D3) are rate-limiting for transition through the restriction point (R) (15Pardee A.B. Science. 1989; 246: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar, 16Lauper N. Beck A.R. Cariou S. Richman L. Hofmann K. Reith W. Slingerland J.M. Amati B. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2637-2643Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 17Sherr C.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 187-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Once cells have passed through R, the E-type cyclins (E1 and E2) accumulate and allow S phase initiation (18Ekholm S.V. Zickert P. Reed S.I. Zetterberg A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3256-3265Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The D- and E-families of G1 cyclins have different specificities for their cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) subunits; the D-type cyclins preferentially bind to and activate CDKs-4 and -6, while cyclin E is preferentially associated with CDK2. D-type cyclins are predominantly regulated by extracellular mitogenic signals, whereas cyclin E is regulated autonomously, in a cyclical manner, peaking at the G1/S boundary. The primary physiological substrate for the CDKs are the retinoblastoma (pRb) family of pocket proteins (pRb, p107, and p130) (19Grana X. Garriga J. Mayol X. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3365-3383Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 20Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1981) Google Scholar). When hypophosphorylated, the pocket proteins bind to and inactivate the E2F family of transcription factors which are required for the transcription of genes that are necessary for entry into S-phase of the cell cycle. The activities of the CDKs are negatively regulated by two families of CDK inhibitors, namely the WAF/CIP family (comprising p21Cip1, p27Kip1, and p57Kip2) and the INK4 family (p15INK4b, p16INK4a, p18INK4c, and p19INK4d). The WAF/CIP family inhibits a broad range of cyclin-CDK complexes, while the INK4 family specifically inhibit cyclin D-CDK4/6 complexes (21Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5159) Google Scholar). We have shown previously, that cyclin D2 is critical for IgM mediated activation of B cells and that cyclin D3 can partially compensate for the function of cyclin D2 in cyclin D2-deficient B cells (22Lam E.W.-F. Glassford J. Banerji L. Thomas N.S. Sicinski P. Klaus G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3479-3484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Moreover, while cyclin D2-deficient B cells respond poorly to weak cross-linking of the BCR by monoclonal anti-IgM, they respond normally to LPS (23Solvason N. Wu W.W. Parry D. Mahony D. Lam E.W. Glassford J. Klaus G.G. Sicinski P. Weinberg R. Liu Y.J. Howard M. Lees E. Int. Immunol. 2000; 12: 631-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The molecular basis for the differential activation by IgM and LPS is due to specific targeting of cyclin D2 by IgM, while LPS normally activates both cyclins D2 and D3. Mice null for cyclin D2 share phenotypic features with vav−/− mice with respect to defects in activation of B cells in response to BCR cross-linking, impaired IgG class-switching, and having a significant depletion of CD5 (B1) lymphocytes (23Solvason N. Wu W.W. Parry D. Mahony D. Lam E.W. Glassford J. Klaus G.G. Sicinski P. Weinberg R. Liu Y.J. Howard M. Lees E. Int. Immunol. 2000; 12: 631-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In the present study, we identify Vav as a key component of IgM induced cyclin D2 induction and subsequent cell cycle progression. In addition, we begin to delineate the signaling pathways converging on cyclin D2 upon BCR cross-linking. The generation of mice homozygous for the Vav null mutation have been described previously (8Turner M. Mee P.J. Walters A.E. Quinn M.E. Mellor A.L. Zamoyska R. Tybulewicz V.L. Immunity. 1997; 7: 451-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Splenic B cells were purified from these Vav null mice and their wild-type counterparts by previously published methods (24Johnson-Leger C. Christenson J.R. Holman M. Klaus G.G. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4618-4626PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, T cells were killed by a mixture of monoclonal antibodies against Thy-1, CD4, and CD8, plus guinea pig complement. Small, dense B cells were then isolated on Percoll density gradients. These preparations typically consisted of 90–95% B-lymphocytes. The cells were cultured at 106 cells ml−1 in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 2 mmglutamine, 100 units ml−1 penicillin/streptomycin and 50 µm 2-mercaptoethanol, and were stimulated with 10 µg ml−1 of monoclonal anti-IgM (clone b.7.6) (25Choi M.S.

The p38 MAPK inhibitor SB 203580 (purchased from Calbiochem) was used at 10 µm, and the calcium flux inhibitor SK&F 96365 (purchased from Sigma) at 10 µg ml−1. Cell proliferation was monitored by [3H]thymidine incorporation assays. The cells were cultured in quadruplicate at 105 cells/well in 200-µl cultures in supplemented RPMI 1640 medium, and [3H]thymidine was added for the final 4 h of a 72-, 48-, or 24-h culture period. Cells were collected using a PHD cell harvester (Cambridge Technology, Cambridge, MA) and [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA was quantified by scintillation counting. All presented data are mean ± S.D. (n = 4) (some data points the error bars are smaller than the data point symbol). Cell cycle analyses were performed by combined PI and fluorescein isothiocyanate staining as described (27Williams C.D. Linch D.C. Watts M.J. Thomas N.S. Blood. 1997; 90: 194-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in 90% ethanol, 10% phosphate-buffered saline. Following fixation, cells were washed again and then incubated with 500 µg ml−1 DNase-free RNase, 20 µg ml−1 PI, and 0.05 µg ml−1 fluorescein isothiocyanate for 30 min at 37 °C prior to analysis using a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). Western blot whole cell extracts were prepared by lysing cells with 4 times packed cell volume of lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaF, 1 mmsodium orthovanadate and protease inhibitors (“Complete” purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals) on ice for 15 min. Protein yield was quantified by Bio-Rad Dc protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). 50 µg of lysate was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and recognized by specific antibodies. The antibodies against cyclin D2 (M-20), cyclin D3 (18B6–10), cyclin E (M-20), CDK2 (M2), CDK4 (C-22), CDK6 (C-21), and p27 (C-19) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The anti-phospho pRB (Ser807/811) antibody was purchased from New England Biolabs and the anti-phospho pRB (Thr821) antibody from BIOSOURCE. Antibodies raised against phospho-p38 MAPK (Thr180/Tyr182), phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Thr202/Tyr204), phospho SAPK/JNK (Thr183/Tyr185), phospho-AKT (Ser473), and antibodies raised against the total (activation state-independent) forms of these kinases were purchased from New England Biolabs. The antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase-linked goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (Dako), or mouse absorbed goat anti-rat IgG (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc.) and visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescent (ECL) detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, United Kingdom). Small dense B cells were stained with anti-B220-fluorescein isothiocyanate before being incubated with Indo-1 acetoxymethyl ester (Indo-1) for 20 min at 37 °C. Cells were then washed before analysis of real-time intracellular free calcium by flow cytometry. Indo-1 emmision was analyzed for 1 min before stimulation to establish baseline calcium concentrations, and following stimulation with monoclonal or polyclonal anti-IgMs, for a further 9 min. Previous studies have shown that antigen receptor-mediated proliferative responses of B cells fromvav−/− mice are severely compromised. As a first step in identifying potential cell-cycle regulatory events responsible for this defect, we analyzed the kinetics of S-phase entry in cultures of small, dense B cells stimulated with either monoclonal anti-IgM (a relatively weak mitogen) or with the polyclonal activator, LPS (a potent mitogen). Our results showed that small, dense B cells from vav−/− mice proliferated equally as well as those from wild-type mice in response to LPS, but unlike their wild-type counterparts, were completely unable to proliferate in response to monoclonal anti-IgM (Fig. 1). We next sought to analyze the kinetics of cell cycle entry of these cells. This was monitored by flow cytometric analysis of both DNA and protein content (Fig. 2and TableI). Resting B cells were found to have a 2N DNA content and low protein content in both wild-type and Vav-null B cells, indicating that most cells (96 and 94%, respectively) were in G0. Both wild-type and Vav null B cells had begun to enter G1 by 24 h after LPS treatment, as evidenced by an increase in their protein content. At 48 and 72 h following LPS treatment, both wild-type and vav−/− B cells were observed to have entered S and G2/M phases, since they had a high protein content and an increased DNA content. As expected, the kinetics of cell cycle entry were slower in wild type cells stimulated with anti-IgM (compared with those activated by LPS), with cells present in G1 phase by 48 h and S phase by 72 h. Interestingly, Vav-null cells began to enter G1phase by 48 h and 72 h, but did not progress into S phase. Rather, they appear to have undergone apoptosis, indicated by a sub-2N DNA content. These data confirm the previously reported inability of Vav-null cells to proliferate in response to antigen receptor-mediated stimuli, and extend these findings to show that this defect occurs after the cells have entered G1 phase.Figure 2Cell cycle analysis of B cells fromvav−/− and wild-type mice.Small dense B cells were cultured with either monoclonal anti-IgM (10 µg/ml b.7.6) or LPS (10 µg/ml) for the indicated times. Cells were permeablized and stained with PI and fluorescein isothiocyanate to measure DNA and protein content, respectively, prior to FACS analysis.

Open table in a new tab Cells were stimulated and analysed as described in the legend to Fig. 2. We have shown previously that proliferative signals emanating from the B cell receptor converge on the pRB/E2F pathway, and that cyclin D2 is an essential effector of pRB phosphorylation and subsequent activation of E2F regulated genes and cell cycle entry in response to anti-IgM. Since Vav-null B cells fail to enter S phase in response to anti-IgM, and vav−/− mice share phenotypic features with cyclin D2−/− mice, we next sought to ascertain if a defect in cyclin D2 regulation was responsible for the inability of Vav-null B cells to proliferate in response to anti-IgM. Consistent with our hypothesis, there was no induction of cyclin D2 in response to anti-IgM stimulation of Vav-null B cells (Fig. 3), even after 48 and 72 h, by which time cell cycle analyses demonstrated that they had entered G1. By contrast, cyclin D2 was induced by 24 h in wild-type B cells stimulated with anti-IgM and in both wild-type and Vav-null cells treated with LPS. This induction of cyclin D2 was concomitant with a down-regulation of the cdk inhibitor, p27. Interestingly, this down-regulation of p27 also occurred in the Vav-null cells treated with anti-IgM which failed to up-regulate cyclin D2. D-type cyclins are thought to be responsible for sequestering p27 and their activation ultimately leads to its degradation in response to mitogenic stimuli (21Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5159) Google Scholar). However, the decrease in p27 levels in this case is possibly due to general protein degradation as a result of cells undergoing apoptosis. Using antibodies that specifically recognize CDK4/6 phosphorylated residues on pRb (21Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5159) Google Scholar, 28Zarkowska T. Mittnacht S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12738-12746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), we measured the in vivo D-type cyclin-associated CDK (4 and 6) activity in these cells. In all cases, induction of cyclin D2 was associated with a subsequent induction of CDK4/6 activity, followed by an induction of cyclin D3, the late G1 cyclin, cyclin E, and the expression and activity of its catalytic partner, CDK2. However, in Vav-null cells treated with anti-IgM, induction of CDK4/6 activity and other downstream events did not occur. It is notable that cyclin E expression is induced faster and at a higher level in LPS-treated wild-type cells compared with those treated with anti-IgM. Since cyclin D2 accumulation is important for passage through the restriction point, while cyclin E is essential for S phase initiation (18Ekholm S.V. Zickert P. Reed S.I. Zetterberg A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3256-3265Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), the earlier expression of cyclin E in LPS-treated cells compared with anti-IgM-treated cells explains the greater level of DNA synthesis observed (Fig. 1.). We have shown previously that cyclin D3 can partially compensate for cyclin D2 in cyclin D2−/− B cells stimulated with anti-IgM. There was no induction of cyclin D3 in anti-IgM stimulatedvav−/− B cells, consistent with their inability to enter S phase and absence of CDK activity, and as previously reported (29Solvason N. Wu W.W. Kabra N. Wu X. Lees E. Howard M.C. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 407-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), B cells did not express cyclin D1 (data not shown). The down-regulation in CDK activity observed at 72 h in cells treated with LPS is consistent with cells having passed through S phase of the cell cycle (Figs. 1 and 2). Also of note, are the lower levels of cyclin E observed in Vav-null cells treated with LPS compared with wild-type cells (Fig. 3), but this did not appear to be rate-limiting for CDK 2 activity or S-phase induction. It has been proposed that Vav plays an important role in setting the threshold for antigen receptor-mediated stimulation of B lymphocytes, since increased degrees of cross-linking could partially rescue the proliferative defect in the anti-IgM response of vav−/− B cells (11Bachmann M.F. Nitschke L. Krawczyk C. Tedford K. Ohashi P.S. Fischer K.D. Penninger J.M. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 137-142PubMed Google Scholar). As a first step to examining the molecular basis for this response, we sought to analyze the proliferative response of small dense resting B cells in response to polyclonal anti-IgM, which has a higher degree of cross-linking to the BCR than that of the b.7.6 monoclonal anti-IgM. Previous work has demonstrated a differential proliferative response to these two stimuli in the presence of interleukin-4 (30Gulbranson-Judge A. Tybulewicz V.L. Walters A.E. Toellner K.M. MacLennan I.C. Turner M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). As has been shown previously for the total B cell population, Vav-null B cells were now able to proliferate in response to BCR cross-linking, albeit poorly in comparison to their wild-type counterparts (Fig.4A). We next examined the expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins in these cells, and found that cyclin D2 was up-regulated in response to polyclonal anti-IgM, although its expression was lower than that observed in their wild-type counterparts. Since there was no further increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation or in cyclin D2 expression between 48 and 72 h after BCR cross-linking in Vav-null cells, it appears to be a quantitatively lower response, rather than a delayed response compared with wild-type cells. The lower level of cyclin D2 induced in vav−/− cells is associated with a lower induction of the downstream molecules cyclin D3 and cyclin E, reduced cdk activity and a smaller reduction in p27 expression. Thus, these data further implicate cyclin D2 as a specific target of Vav downstream of the BCR. As described previously, Vav contains several protein interaction domains in addition to its GEF activity, which suggests it may be important in several signaling pathways that might target cyclin D2 induction via the BCR. As a first step to identifying which of these pathways are involved, we analyzed the expression and activity of key enzymes by Western blotting, using antibodies raised against their phosphorylated, active forms. In addition to analyzing the rapid activation of these signaling intermediates in response to receptor cross-linking, we also looked for more prolonged activation which might be responsible for activating delayed-early genes such as cyclin D2. Vav has been shown to function as a GEF with selectivity for the Rho family GTPase, Rac1 (1Cantrell D. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R535-538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One potential downstream effector of Vav is the stress-activated kinase, p38 MAPK, which is downstream of Rac1 (31Hashimoto A. Okada H. Jiang A. Kurosaki M. Greenberg S. Clark E.A. Kurosaki T. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1287-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Vav has been reported to integrate signals via the T cell receptor with p38 MAPK (32Hehner S.P. Hofmann T.G. Dienz O. Droge W. Schmitz M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18160-18171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 33Salojin K.V. Zhang J. Delovitch T.L. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 844-853PubMed Google Scholar), and there are several reports of p38 MAPK activation in response to BCR cross-linking (34Swart J.M. Chiles T.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 35Sakata N. Hamelmann E. Siadak A.W. Terada N. Gerwins P. Aruffo A. Johnson G.L. Gelfand E.W. Cell.

Young P.R. Gold M.R. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 3381-3390PubMed Google Scholar). The biological consequences of p38 MAPK activation in B cells, however, remains unclear. Fig. 5shows that p38 MAPK is rapidly activated in response to BCR cross-linking in wild-type B cells, with levels approaching the basal state after 2 h. In the Vav-null cells, however, there was no detectable p38 MAPK activity, indicating that this kinase might play a role in mediating the proliferative response to BCR cross-linking. p38 MAPK has frequently been implicated in the regulation of D-type cyclins (39Page K.

In contrast to p38 MAPK, there appeared to be a later up-regulation of another stress-activated kinase family member, SAPK/JNK, that persisted until 2 h following stimulation. This activity was augmented in the Vav-null cells compared with their wild-type counterparts, possibly compensating for the loss of p38 MAPK in these cells. The p42/p44 (ERK) MAPK pathway is most usually associated with proliferative responses to mitogens, and has been implicated in the positive regulation of the D-type cylins (44Lavoie J.N.

BCR cross-linking induced a rapid activation of p42/p44 MAPK in both wild-type and vav−/− B cells, indicating that this pathway is not dependent on Vav expression. Similarly, the activation of the AKT protein kinase which lies downstream of PI 3-K, is apparently unaffected by the loss of Vav. Recent data suggests that PI 4-phosphate (PIP) 5-kinase is a downstream target of Vav after BCR cross-linking (4O'Rourke L.M. Tooze R. Turner M. Sandoval D.M. Carter R.H. Tybulewicz V.L. Fearon D.T.

The α subunits of G proteins comprising four major families, Gs, Gi, Gq, and G12 have a guanine nucleotide-binding site and intrinsic GTPase activity. When the associated receptors are activated by stimuli, exchange of a guanine nucleotide from GDP to GTP occurs on Gα, and G protein heterotrimers dissociate into Gα and Gβγ, which then interact with and regulate effectors, such as adenylyl cyclase and phospholipase Cβ as well as K+- and Ca2+-channels (1Iñiguez-Lluhi J.

In the same report, we demonstrated that expression of constitutively active mutants of Gαs, Gαi2, and Gα11 (Gα11QL), a member of the Gq family, does not induce stress fibers, though Gα11QL appeared to be associated with formation of thin actin fibers judging by the bright staining of cells with rhodamine phalloidin (6Ueda H.

Antibodies against phosphospecific p38 MAP kinase and cleaved caspase-3 were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. A mouse monoclonal antibody against Myc epitope (9E10) was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals and Alexa Fluor 488 anti-rabbit IgG, Alexa Fluor 568 anti-mouse IgG and Alexa Fluor 568 phalloidin were obtained from Molecular Probes. Ro-31-8220, Gö 6983, BAPTA/AM and A23187 were obtained from Calbiochem-Novabiochem Co. Benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (zVAD-fmk) was purchased from Peptide Institute, Inc., and Y-27632 was supplied by Yoshitomi Pharmaceutical Industries (24Uehata M. Ishizaki T. Satoh H. Ono T. Kawahara T. Morishita T. Tamakawa H. Yamagami K. Inui J. Maekawa M. Narumiya S. Nature. 1997; 389: 990-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (2538) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C. Transient transfection with LipofectAMINE plus reagent was accomplished according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). Immediately after transfection, zVAD-fmk and Y-27632 were added to final concentrations of 100 and 10 μm, respectively. Cells were cultured for 16 or 48 h, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Fixed cells were then immunostained using antibodies against Gα, Gβ, vinculin, and cleaved caspase-3 followed by secondary antibodies, Alexa Fluor 488 anti-rabbit IgG or Alexa Fluor 568 anti-mouse IgG. The cells were also stained for F-actin with Alexa Fluor 568 phalloidin. After coverslipping, slides were examined under a laser-scanning microscope (FLUOVIEW Olympus) equipped for fluorescence. HeLa cells were co-transfected with m1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor and ROCK-I plasmids (plus pEGFP-C3 for immunocytochemistry), cultured for 16 h, and 30 min after addition of atropine, Y-27632, zVAD-fmk, Ro-31-8220, Gö 6983, BAPTA/AM, or 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate they were stimulated with 100 μm carbachol. Cells were then fixed and immunostained with antibodies against vinculin or subjected to immunoblotting. In experiments with other apoptotic stimuli, cells were transfected with ROCK-I, cultured for 16 h, and stimulated with staurosporine, an antibody against Fas plus cycloheximide, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, or A23187 for 4 h. For immunoblotting, they were lysed with 1% SDS in 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, and lysates were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 7.5 and 10% polyacrylamide gels for detection of ROCK and other proteins, respectively. Immunoblotting was performed employing a chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and densitometry was achieved using the LAS-1000 system (Fujifilm). This was performed essentially as described previously (11Ishizaki T. Maekawa M. Fujisawa K. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Fujita A. Watanabe N. Saito Y. Kakizuka A. Morii N. Narumiya S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1885-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). In brief, transfected cells were lysed with a lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mmMgCl2, 25 mm NaF, 1 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm sodium vanadate, 0.05% Triton X-100, and 0.1 μm calyculin A) on ice for 20 min, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. An antibody against a Myc epitope coupled to protein A-Sepharose was added to the supernatant, shaken at 4 °C for 3 h, and centrifuged at 1,000 ×g for 5 min. The pellet was washed three times with the lysis buffer and once with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 5 mm MgCl2 and 0.1 μmcalyculin A and resuspended in 31 μl of phosphorylation buffer containing 40 μm [γ-32P]ATP (3.3 Ci/mmol), 3 μg of myelin basic protein (MBP), 50 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, 0.03% Briji 35, and 2 mmdithiothreitol. The suspension was incubated for 20 min at 30 °C, terminated by addition of 2× Laemmli sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue, dried, and analyzed by the BAS-1800 system (Fujifilm). Transfected cells including floating cells were suspended and counted using a hematocytometer in the presence of trypan blue solution at a 1:1 ratio (v/v, Life Technologies, Inc.) as described previously (25Zhang J. Reedy M.C. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Proteins were quantified using a micro bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Pierce), with bovine serum albumin as the standard. We have previously reported that expression of Gβγ induces the formation of thick actin stress fibers and focal adhesions in HeLa cells (6Ueda H. Itoh H. Yamauchi J. Morishita R. Kaziro Y. Kato K. Asano T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2098-2102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Co-transfection of a dominant negative mutant of RhoA and a specific inhibitor of ROCK, Y-27632 have inhibited Gβγ-induced focal adhesion assembly (Fig. 1,B, D, and F) and stress fiber formation (data not shown), indicating that these morphological changes are Rho- and ROCK-dependent (6Ueda H. Itoh H. Yamauchi J. Morishita R. Kaziro Y. Kato K. Asano T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2098-2102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Because cells were cultured in medium containing 10% fetal calf serum in the present study, focal adhesions were also observed in surrounding untransfected cells, but to a much lesser extent than in Gβγ-expressing cells (Fig. 1 B). Expression of Gα11QL induced the formation of vinculin-enriched plaques and somewhat contractile shapes of cells (Fig. 1 A). Punctate vinculin staining was observed within as well as at the edges of cells and was more dense and greater in area than that in Gβ1γ2-expressing cells (Fig. 1, A and B). Gα11QL-induced formation of vinculin-enriched plaques, however, was not inhibited by co-transfection of the dominant negative mutant of Rho (Fig. 1 C), whereas it was blocked by Y-27632 (Fig. 1 E), suggesting Gα11QL-induced formation of vinculin-enriched plaques to be Rho-independent but ROCK-dependent. Because previous reports showed that a constitutively active mutant of Gαq induced apoptosis in several cultured cells (17Althoefer H. Eversole-Cire P. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24380-24386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 18Adams J.W. Pagel A.L. Means C.K. Oksenberg D. Armstrong R.C. Brown J.H. Circ.

A. 1998; 95: 10140-10145Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar), we examined whether this was also the case for Gα11QL in HeLa cells. First, the trypan blue exclusion method revealed that expression of Gα11QL increased the population of trypan blue-positive cells (Fig. 2 A). Treatment with zVAD-fmk, a specific inhibitor of caspases, prevented this increase. Next, determination of protein content as a parameter for detached cells indicated that Gα11QL promoted detachment, but not in the presence of zVAD-fmk (Fig. 2 B). In a third experiment, immunocytochemical staining with an antibody against cleaved caspase-3 showed many positive Gα11QL-expressing cells, and treatment with zVAD-fmk prevented cleavage of these (Fig. 2 C). In addition, zVAD-fmk inhibited Gα11QL-induced vinculin-enriched plaque formation but not Gβγ-induced focal adhesion formation (Fig. 1,G and H). These results strongly indicate that Gα11QL induces apoptosis in HeLa cells, and this involves ROCK activation. It has been shown that one Rho effector, a fatty acid- and Rho-activated serine/threonine kinase, is cleaved and activated by caspase-3 in Jurkat and U973 cells during apoptosis (26Takahashi M. Mukai H. Toshimori M. Miyamoto M. Ono Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11566-11571Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In addition, evidence that deletion of the C-terminal region of ROCK results in kinase activation (22Ishizaki T. Naito M. Fujisawa K. Maekawa M. Watanabe N. Saito Y. Narumiya S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 118-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 27Leung T. Chen X.Q. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5313-5327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Amano M. Chihara K. Kimura K. Fukata Y. Nakamura N. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1997; 275: 1308-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar) and transfection with C-terminally truncated mutants induces the formation of vinculin-enriched plaques in HeLa cells (22Ishizaki T. Naito M. Fujisawa K. Maekawa M. Watanabe N. Saito Y. Narumiya S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 118-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar) suggests the possibility that ROCK is cleaved and activated by caspase. Cell extracts were therefore immunoblotted with the antibody against ROCK-I, and indeed a fragment with a molecular mass of ∼130 kDa was observed, as well as the native protein with a molecular mass of ∼160 kDa, in Gα11QL-expressing cells (Fig. 3 A). This fragment was not detected in the presence of zVAD-fmk, indicating the cleavage of ROCK-I to be caspase-dependent (Fig. 3 A). In contrast, immunoblotting with the antibody against ROCK-II revealed that it was not a substrate of caspase (Fig. 3 A). To confirm these observations obtained with endogenous ROCK-I, we co-transfected HeLa cells with Gα11QL and Myc-tagged ROCK-I. Gα11QL stimulated cleavage of overexpressed ROCK-I, and this was inhibited by zVAD-fmk (Fig. 3 B). The expression of the dominant negative mutant of Rho did not affect Gα11QL-induced cleavage of ROCK-I, suggesting the cleavage to be Rho-independent (Fig. 3 C). In the present study, we used two separate antibodies to detect ROCK-I; one against a peptide (amino acid residues 906–1012) and the other against Myc for detection of ROCK-I tagged with Myc epitope at the N terminus (Fig. 3 D). Because both antibodies reacted with the fragment with a molecular mass of ∼130 kDa as well as native protein (Fig. 3 B), it was concluded to have an intact N terminus. Previous studies have established that caspase cleaves carboxyl-terminally at sequences conforming to the consensus sequence D XXD (26Takahashi M. Mukai H. Toshimori M. Miyamoto M. Ono Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11566-11571Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 29Smith G.C. di Fagagna F. Lakin N.D. Jackson S.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6076-6084Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Notably, around 130 kDa from the N terminus of ROCK-I protein are three potential caspase cleavage sites: the first comprising amino acid residues 1096–1099 and the second and third corresponding to amino acid residues 1110–1113 and 1155–1158, respectively (Fig. 3 D). ROCK-I is probably cleaved at Asp-1099, Asp-1113, or Asp-1158, to constitutively active forms. To examine this hypothesis, we transfected HeLa cells with mutants of ROCK-I in which amino acid residues at 1100 (D1), 1114 (D2), and 1159 (D3) were substituted with stop codons. Immunoblot analyses of cell lysates revealed D2 to have the same apparent molecular mass as the ROCK-I fragment cleaved by the caspase, suggesting the cleavage site to be Asp-1113 (Fig. 4 A). The D2 mutant was then subjected to in vitro immunocomplex kinase assay to determine whether it is an active form, showing higher phosphorylation of MBP than full-length wild-type ROCK-I (Fig. 4 B). Transfection with D2 induced contractile shapes of cells and the formation of vinculin-enriched plaques, which were more dense and greater in area than those in wild-type ROCK-I-expressing cells (Fig. 4, D and E). The caspase inhibitor did not affect the plaque formation induced by D2 (Fig. 4 F). These results indicate that caspase-cleaved ROCK-I is the constitutively active form. Because transfection of a constitutively active mutant induced sustained activation of Gα, the apoptosis and cleavage of ROCK-I in Gα11QL-expressing cells could have been due to secondary effects. To assess this possibility, we transfected cells with the m1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, which couples with Gqand G11, and examined whether cleavage of ROCK-I occurs upon stimulation of the receptor. A time course study showed carbachol-induced cleavage of ROCK-I, which was observed around 2 h after stimulation (Fig. 5 A). Carbachol also increased the level of phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase around 20 min after stimulation, indicating functioning of the expressed m1 muscarinic receptors (data not shown). Carbachol-stimulated cleavage of ROCK-I was prevented by the antagonist, atropine, showing the cleavage to be agonist-dependent (Fig. 5 B). Small amounts of the fragment were also observed in unstimulated cells. Atropine diminished carbachol-enhanced cleavage to this level of untreated cells, whereas zVAD-fmk exerted almost complete blocking action (Fig. 5 B). These results suggest that some apoptosis does occur in untreated HeLa cells, probably due to the 10% fetal calf serum, which contains various agonists capable of activating Gq/11, such as lysophosphatidic acid (30Seufferlein T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9345-9351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We next examined whether carbachol stimulation induces the formation of vinculin-enriched plaques in a ROCK-dependent but Rho-independent manner, as observed in Fig. 1. Upon stimulation of cells expressing the m1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor by carbachol, vinculin staining increased in to cover greater areas and became more dense (Fig. 6, A and B). Carbachol-induced vinculin-enriched plaque formation was inhibited by atropine and Y-27632 but not by a dominant negative mutant of Rho (Fig. 6, C–E). In the presence of the caspase inhibitor, vinculin staining was only partially decreased, though zVAD-fmk is expected to completely prevent carbachol-stimulated vinculin-enriched plaque formation (Fig. 6 F). Incomplete inhibition could be explained as follows; m1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors may couple with G12/13 as well as Gq/11 (31Luthin G.R. Wang P. Zhou H. Dhanasekaran D. Ruggieri M.R. Life Sci. 1997; 60: 963-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and activated Gα and Gβγ are released from these G proteins on stimulation of receptors. Both Gβγ and Gα12/13 induce focal adhesion assembly in a Rho- and ROCK-dependent manner, and this signal pathway may occur together with activation of ROCK-I by caspase-mediated cleavage on stimulation of m1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor-expressing cells. This explanation is supported by the fact that the combination of the dominant negative mutant of Rho and zVAD-fmk completely inhibited carbachol-stimulated formation of vinculin-enriched plaques (Fig. 6 G). These results thus indicate that activation of Gq/11 by receptor stimulation induces caspase-mediated activation of ROCK-I. It is well known that Gq stimulates phospholipase Cβ, resulting in an increase in protein kinase C activity and elevation of initial Ca2+ concentrations. Althoefer et al.(17Althoefer H. Eversole-Cire P. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24380-24386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) demonstrated that a constitutively active mutant of Gαq induced apoptosis via a protein kinase C-dependent pathway in COS-7 cells. To determine the involvement of protein kinase C or Ca2+ in Gα11-induced cleavage of ROCK-I, cells expressing the m1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor were treated with one of two protein kinase C inhibitors, Ro-31-8220 and Gö 6983, the Ca2+chelator, BAPTA/AM, or an inhibitor of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-induced Ca2+ release, 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (32Maruyama T. Kanaji T. Nakade S. Kanno T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 498-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). None of the inhibitors significantly influenced carbachol-induced cleavage of ROCK-I (Fig. 7), whereas they inhibited the phosphorylation of the G protein γ12 subunit, which is mainly due to diacylglycerol and Ca2+-dependent protein kinase C (33Morishita R. Nakayama H. Isobe T. Matsuda T. Hashimoto Y. Okano T. Fukada Y. Mizuno K. Ohno S. Kozawa O. Kato K. Asano T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29469-29475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), indicating these inhibitors to be effective under these conditions (data not shown). These results suggest that Gα11 induces caspase activation via a protein kinase C or Ca2+-independent pathway in HeLa cells. Recent reports indicated that phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, a substrate for phospholipase C, inhibits caspase-3 and caspase-9 in concert with gelsolin (34Azuma T. Koths K. Flanagan L. Kwiatkowski D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3761-3766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) or caspase-8 and caspase-9 directly (35Mejillano M. Yamamoto M. Rozelle A.L. Sun H.Q. Wang X. Yin H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1865-1872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This evidence suggests that the intracellular concentration of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate directly regulates the progression of apoptosis, and therefore, the decrease of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate by Gq/11-stimulated phospholipase C may activate caspase pathways. Thus, Gq/11 regulates concentrations of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and Ca2+ and the activity of protein kinase C, all of which are important for cellular homeostasis. The execution of apoptosis is triggered by intrinsic signal transduction events that link changes in physiological conditions to cell death-signaling pathways. The present study as well as previous findings (17Althoefer H. Eversole-Cire P. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24380-24386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 18Adams J.W. Pagel A.L. Means C.K. Oksenberg D. Armstrong R.C. Brown J.H. Circ.

A. 1998; 95: 10140-10145Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar) suggests that enhanced signals to Gq/11 may trigger apoptosis. To examine whether other common apoptotic stimuli induce ROCK-I cleavage, HeLa cells were incubated with staurosporine, an antibody against Fas plus cycloheximide, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, or the Ca2+ ionophore, A23187. Staurosporine and anti-Fas plus cycloheximide effectively induced ROCK-I cleavage but phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and A23187 did not (Fig. 8). The inability of the phorbol ester and the Ca2+ ionophore to induce ROCK-I cleavage supported the above conclusion that protein kinase C and Ca2+ are not involved in Gα11-mediated caspase activation in HeLa cells. ROCK-I is known to regulate myosin light chain phosphorylation (16Kimura K. Ito M. Amano M. Chihara K. Fukata Y. Nakafuku M. Yamamori B. Feng J. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1996; 273: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (2433) Google Scholar), and a previous study showed that this is critical for apoptotic membrane blebbing, also implicating Rho signaling in such active morphological changes (10Mills J.C. Stone N.L. Erhardt J. Pittman R.N. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 627-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Although the physiological role of the vinculin-containing plaques observed in the present study is unclear, caspase-mediated ROCK-I activation seems to contribute to morphological changes such as cell contraction and membrane blebbing during apoptosis. ROCK-I activation has also been found to contribute to stimulation of transcription by a serum response factor (36Sahai E. Alberts A.S. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1350-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Thus the constitutively active mutant of ROCK-I activates serum response factor-dependent gene expression. However, this activation is inhibited by the C3 exoenzyme, indicating that ROCK-I activation and an unidentified Rho-dependent pathway are necessary for stimulation of serum response factor-dependent gene expression (36Sahai E. Alberts A.S. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1350-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Sagi et al. (37Sagi S.A. Seasholtz T.M. Kobiashvili M. Wilson B.A. Toksoz D. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15445-15452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) also demonstrated that a constitutively active mutant of Gαq stimulated serum response factor-dependent transcription without activating Rho in COS-7 cells. Because the constitutively active mutant of Gαq induces apoptosis of COS-7 cells (17Althoefer H. Eversole-Cire P. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24380-24386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), caspase-induced activation of ROCK-I may be involved in Gαq-induced activation of serum response factor-dependent transcription. In conclusion, Gα11 induces proteolytic activation of ROCK-I by caspase and thereby regulates the actin cytoskeleton. The results point to the existence of a novel pathway activating ROCK-I in a Rho-independent manner and may offer insights on some previously inexplicable observations related to Rho and ROCK-I. After submission of this manuscript, two papers were published describing the caspase-mediated cleavage of ROCK-I to be responsible for membrane blebbing in apoptotic cells (Coleman, M. L., Sahai, E. A., Yeo, M., Bosch, M., Dewar, A., and Olson, M. F. (2001) Nat. Cell Biol. 3, 339–345. Sebbagh, M., Renvoizé, C., Hamelin, J., Riché, N., Bertoglio, J., and Bréard, J. (2001) Nat. Cell Biol. 3, 346–352). We thank Drs. M. I. Simon, T. Nukada, E. M. Ross, and K. Kaibuchi for supplying the plasmids."

A G protein mutated at the same site on the γ subunit shows enhanced receptor stimulated nucleotide exchange without affecting G protein heterotrimerization.

Peptide and mutant studies using biochemical assays that measure receptor-G protein coupling have implicated three protein domains, the N- and C-terminal domains of the α subunit and the C-terminal domain of the γ subunit in receptor interaction (1Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 669-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar, 2Gautam N. Downes G.B. Yan K. Kisselev O. Cell.

Functional contact between the γ subunit and a receptor is one mechanism that can explain the universal requirement of the βγ complex for receptor-mediated nucleotide exchange in the α subunit. However, the particular role that the γ subunit plays at the receptor surface during G protein activation has not been clear. The crystal structure of the G protein heterotrimer indicates that the C termini of the γ and α subunits are a considerable distance from the nucleotide-binding site in the α subunit (4Lambright D.G.

The mechanisms that help the receptor regulate nucleotide exchange by contacting these domains are therefore an outstanding puzzle. Because a peptide specific to the C terminus of the γ1 subunit type stabilizes activated rhodopsin in a sequence-dependent manner (6Kisselev O.G. Ermolaeva M.V. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21399-21402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a homologous γ5 peptide specifically inhibits muscarinic receptor modulation of a Ca2+ current in intact neurons (3Azpiazu I. Cruzblanca H. Li P. Linder M. Zhuo M. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35305-35308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of a geranylgeranylated γ5 peptide on the M2 muscarinic receptor activation of a G protein. The peptide specific to the C-terminal 14 residues of the γ5 subunit was prenylated because the native γ5 subunit is modified with geranylgeranyl at the C-terminal Cys residue that is part of a CAA X motif (2Gautam N. Downes G.B. Yan K. Kisselev O. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). This peptide inhibited activation of G proteins by reconstituted M2 receptor. A peptide with the same sequence scrambled was inactive. These studies indicated that the γ subunit peptide interacts with the receptor in a sequence-specific fashion. To test the effect of mutations in this C-terminal domain of γ5 on G protein activation by M2, C-terminal residues of γ5 corresponding to the peptides were scrambled. The scrambled sequence was identical to the sequence of the scrambled peptide used in the earlier experiments. Wild type and mutant β1γ5 complexes were purified and bound to αo, and the ability of the M2 receptor to activate these heterotrimers was measured in a reconstituted system containing purified proteins. A significant difference in the receptor-stimulated GTPase activity between the wild type and mutant Go was detected in this system. A phospholipase C enzyme-based assay indicated that efficacy of interaction with the α subunit was unaltered by the mutant γ subunit. Together these results indicate that the γ subunit interaction with the receptor regulates nucleotide exchange in the α subunit by affecting the positioning of the βγ complex with reference to the α subunit. The results thus identify a mechanism that allows a receptor to regulate nucleotide exchange at a distance in the G protein. The amino acid sequences of the peptides were as follows: γ5pep-gg (wild type):VSSSTNPFRPQKVC and γ5pep-gg-scr (scrambled): PSRTPVNFSQVSKC. Cys residues were retained at the C terminus for chemical geranylgeranylation using geranylgeranyl bromide. Prenylation and purification using fast protein liquid chromatography has been described (7Azpiazu I. Gautam N. Methods Enzymol. 2001; (in press)Google Scholar). The integrity of the modified peptides were checked by mass spectrometry and chromatography, and peptide concentrations were estimated by amino acid analysis. Except where specified, all chemicals were from Sigma. Detailed description of M2 purification, reconstitution, and measurement of G protein stimulation is published elsewhere (7Azpiazu I. Gautam N. Methods Enzymol. 2001; (in press)Google Scholar). Briefly, baculoviruses containing His-tagged M2 receptor cDNA (kind gift from Dr. E. M. Ross) were expressed in insect cells. M2 was purified according to a previously published protocol (8Hayashi M.K. Haga T. J Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 1232-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Sf9 cell membranes containing M2 were solubilized in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7, 50 mmNaCl, digitonin (Calbiochem)/sodium cholate added to 1:0.5% final concentration. All procedures were performed at 4 °C. Solubilized receptor was bound to cobalt-chelate beads that were prepared using iminodiacetic acid beads and cobalt chloride. His-M2 eluted from these columns with 200 mm imidazole retain 50% of the N-[methyl-3H]scopolamine binding activity in Sf9 cell membranes. Using modifications of a previous method (8Hayashi M.K. Haga T. J Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 1232-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), purified M2 was reconstituted into brain lipids (Folch Fraction VII). The composition of the brain lipid mixture is sphingomyelin (20%), phosphatidyl-ethanolamine (30%), phosphatidyl-serine (20%), and other lipids according to the distributor (Sigma). Typically, 100 μl (1 mg lipid) of the aqueous lipid suspension is added to 18 μl of 10% sodium deoxycholate and 4 μl of 10% sodium cholate. 100–500 μl of pure receptor is mixed with solubilized lipids (∼122 μl from above). The mixture is applied to a 10–12-ml column of Sephadex G-50 (fine), equilibrated with solubilization buffer. Vesicle fractions were collected and concentrated.N-[methyl-3H]Scopolamine binding in a standard filter binding assay was used to estimate receptor concentration. The yields were 20–30% relative to purified solubilized receptors. αo subunit protein was expressed in bacteria with yeast myristoyl-transferase and purified as described before (9Linder M.E. Kleuss C. Mumby S.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 314-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). β1γ5 and β1γ5scr complexes were produced in Sf9 insect cells by triple infection of His-αi2, β1 (kind gifts from Dr. T. Kozasa), and γ subunit viruses using a previously published procedure with minor modifications (10Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1734-1741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The two βγ complexes were separately purified in complex with His-tagged αi2 subunit by binding the complex to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin and eluted the βγ complexes with aluminum fluoride. Yields of the β1γ5 and β1γ5scr were similar. The γ5Al and γ5Δ mutants were synthesized as His-tagged proteins, expressed in complex with β1 subunit in Sf9 cells, and purified by directly binding to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin. As a control a wild type β1-His-tagged γ5 complex was expressed and purified. Although the yield of β1His-γ5 was comparable with or higher than that of β1γ5, the yields of the β1Hisγ5Ala/Δ were relatively low. The final purity was examined by gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Blue staining where no significant levels of other proteins were detected. Protein concentration was determined by laser scanning densitometry using standards. G protein heterotrimer was formed by preincubating αo with βγ complexes for 30 min at 4 °C. Lipid-reconstituted M2 was incubated with αo subunit with or without βγ complexes for 30 min at 4 °C in 20 mm Hepes buffer, pH 8, containing 2 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 10 μm GDP, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. GTPγS1 binding to αo was determined using previously published methods (11Biddlecome G.H. Berstein G. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7999-8007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In peptide assays, the incubation was performed by mixing with dried peptide or peptide vehicle (3 μm CHAPS) as a control. The final reaction mix contained 1 nm M2, 100 nm αo, and 0–10 nm β1γ5 in the buffer above and was equilibrated at 23 °C. The binding reaction was started by addition of 0.2 μm [35S]GTPγS and 1 mmcarbachol, 1 mm atropine or vehicle. The reaction was stopped with ice-cold reaction buffer containing 200 μmGTPγS and 1 mm atropine. [35S]GTPγS bound to αo was measured in a filter binding assay. For GTPase assays, the conditions were the same as above. αo GTPase activity was measured essentially as described (11Biddlecome G.H. Berstein G. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7999-8007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The reaction was started with 0.2 μm [γ-32P]GTP, 1 mmcarbachol, or vehicle and stopped with ice-cold 5% charcoal in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0. The samples were centrifuged, and the radioactivity in the supernatant was estimated using scintillation counting. Purified RGS4 was kindly provided by Dr. Maurine Linder. αo inhibition of βγ complex-stimulated PLC-β activity was measured as described before (12Hou Y. Azpiazu I. Smrcka A. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38961-38964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). αo and β1γ5 or β1γ5scr complexes were preincubated for 30 min at 4 °C. The reaction mixture contained G protein, PLC-β, and lipids. Freeze dried lipid mixtures were ultrasonicated before use. Final concentrations were 150 μm phosphatidyl ethanolamine, 50 μm [3H]phosphatidyl inositol diphosphate, 1.25 nm PLC-β3, and 4 nm β1γ5 (wild type or mutant). Ca2+ was added to initiate the reaction. The reaction was performed at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped with trichloroacetic acid with bovine serum albumin, and the radioactivity in the supernatant was measured. No more than 10–15% of the substrate, [3H]phosphatidyl inositol diphosphate, was used during the reactions. Purified recombinant PLC-β was a kind gift from Dr. A. Smrcka. The rat γ5 cDNA was mutated by replacing the 3′ end of the γ5 cDNA (beginning from a BsmI site at base 156) with a double-stranded DNA cassette encoding the scrambled sequence. Alanine substitutions and the deletion of 10 residues upstream of the codon encoding the C-terminal Cys were performed using polymerase chain reaction based methods in a γ5 cDNA that was His-tagged. Mutant cDNAs were transferred to the baculovirus using the pFastBac system (Invitrogen-Life Technologies, Inc.). A peptide specific to the C-terminal 14 residues of γ5 was geranylgeranylated (γ5pep-gg), and the ability of the peptide to compete with a G protein (αoβ1γ5) for interaction with M2 was examined. A reconstituted system containing purified M2 and G protein subunits was set up (described under “Materials and Methods”; Fig. 1,A and B). Purified reconstituted M2 had a Kd for N-methyl-scopolamine of 250 pm (12Hou Y. Azpiazu I. Smrcka A. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38961-38964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and activated Go in an agonist- (Fig.1 C) and βγ-dependent fashion (data not shown). M2-stimulated Go activation was significantly inhibited by γ5pep-gg but not by a peptide with the same amino acids sequence scrambled, γ5pep-gg-scr (Fig. 1 C). Because these peptides have no effect on the G protein heterotrimer (3Azpiazu I. Cruzblanca H. Li P. Linder M. Zhuo M. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35305-35308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), these results indicate that γ5pep-gg competes with the G protein for a site on the M2 receptor in a sequence-specific manner. Competition of the γ5 peptide with the G protein indicated that the G protein γ5 C-terminal domain interacts with the M2 receptor. To obtain further evidence to support this mechanism, mutant forms of the γ subunit were synthesized with altered C-terminal sequences. If effective interaction of the γ5 subunit C terminus with the M2 receptor is a requirement for activation of a G protein, one or more of these mutant forms of γ5 were expected to alter the activation properties of the G protein. Three different mutants of the γ5 subunit were expressed and purified from insect cells in complex with the β1 subunit type (Fig.2 A). These mutants were as follows: (i) γ5scr: the last 13 residues upstream of the Cys in the CAA X box were scrambled identical to the sequence of γ5pep-gg-scr; (ii) γ5Δ: 10 residues upstream of the Cys residue were deleted; and (iii) γ5Ala: a short sequence of three residues, NPFR, which is conserved in all G protein γ subunits, was substituted with Ala residues. His-tagged forms of γ5Ala and γ5Δ mutants were co-expressed with the β1 subunit and purified as β1γ5Δ and β1γ5Ala complexes. A wild type β1His-γ5 complex was also expressed and purified as a control. Gel exclusion chromatography indicated that the two mutants formed effective complexes with the β1 subunit. However, in contrast to the wild type β1His-γ5, the mutant β1His-γ5Ala and β1His-γ5Δ did not activate PLC-β3 and did not form a heterotrimer with the αo subunit effectively (measured using the ability of pertussis toxin to ADP-ribosylate the αo subunit in the presence of the βγ complex (data not shown)). They were therefore not used in the experiments described below. The γ5scr mutant was co-expressed in the native state with β1 and His tagged αi2 subunits. The heterotrimer was bound to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column. The β1γ5scr complex was eluted using imidazole. As a control wild type β1γ5 was synthesized using a similar approach (Fig. 1 B). The purified β1γ5scr activated PLC-β3 and formed heterotrimers effectively similar to wild type β1γ5 (described below). All experiments were therefore performed with this mutant. The mutant β1γ5scr and wild type β1γ5 in complex with αo were first compared for their relative levels of activation by the M2 receptor. At a receptor to αο subunit ratio of (1:100), no significant difference in receptor-stimulated GTPγS binding was detected between the wild type and mutant heterotrimers at various concentrations of the βγ complex (Fig. 2 B). Assaying M2 activation of αoβ1γ5 and αoβ1γ5scr at various concentrations of carbachol also did not indicate differential activation (Fig. 2 C). In contrast to M2-stimulated GTPγS binding where each α subunit can bind utmost one molecule of GTPγS, M2-stimulated GTPase activity can result in several cycles of activation of a G protein α subunit resulting in the formation of many molecules of Pifor each G protein. Because of this amplification, GTPase assays could be performed with significantly lower concentrations of the αo subunit compared with the GTPγS binding assay, thus approaching a ratio of [receptor] to [G protein] of 1:1. Although the Kd for Go binding to M2 is not known, the Kd for Gt binding to rhodopsin is 1 nm in the absence of nucleotide (13Bennett N. Dupont Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4156-4168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The conditions in the GTPase assay were thus potentially closer to the Kdfor Go binding to M2 and likely to reveal differences between wild type and mutant β1γ5 complexes during M2 activation. To enhance sensitivity, we examined the receptor-stimulated GTPase activity in the presence of saturating concentrations of RGS protein, RGS4 (7Azpiazu I. Gautam N. Methods Enzymol. 2001; (in press)Google Scholar). RGS4 acts as a GTPase-activating protein for the Go/i family (14Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1269-1272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). RGS4 potentiated M2-stimulated GTPase activity over 10-fold (7Azpiazu I. Gautam N. Methods Enzymol. 2001; (in press)Google Scholar). When the time course of M2-stimulated GTPase activity was measured in the presence of RGS4, the M2 receptor activated αoβ1γ5scr significantly more than the wild type (Fig.3). In the absence of the agonist or the βγ complex, M2 did not effectively stimulate Go GTPase activity (footnote a in TableI). Go containing the γ5scr mutant was also more active at several ratios of Go:M2 (Table I). Under these conditions the GTPase activity is a measure of the rate of receptor-stimulated nucleotide exchange (15Mukhopadhyay S. Ross E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9539-9544Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The results thus indicate that the mutant has a higher rate of receptor-stimulated nucleotide exchange compared with the wild type.Table IM2 activation of αoβ1γ5 wild type and αoβ1γ5-scrambledMolar ratio of G protein/M2Turnover numbersaM2-stimulated GTPase activity was measured at the following time points for various molar ratios: 0.3 and 0.6, 20 min; 1 and 2, 10 min; 4–5 min in the presence of 1 mm.

All differences are significant at p < 0.05 except the reaction without RGS4 at a molar ratio of 4. Open table in a new tab In the absence of the RGS protein, the mutant and wild type Go proteins still showed differential receptor-stimulated GTPase activities (Table I). This result indicates that differential receptor-stimulated GTPase activities of αoβ1γ5scr mutant and wild type are not due to differential effects of the RGS4 protein on receptor activation of the mutant and wild type. Alternative explanations were excluded for this differential activity: (i) Both βγ complexes were not contaminated with α subunit because M2 stimulated GTPase activity of the βγ complexes alone was not detectable. (ii) The difference in activity was not due to variation in protein concentrations. When M2-stimulated GTPase activity was measured at various concentrations of β1γ5 (but constant concentrations of αo and M2), a 2–3-fold increase in βγ complex elicited the magnitude of increase in activity seen between the βγ mutant and wild type. Thus a 2–3-fold difference in concentration between β1γ5 and β1γ5scr must remain undetected. However, we could clearly detect 2-fold differences in the concentration of βγ subunits by densitometry of Coomassie Blue-stained proteins in SDS-PAGE gels (Fig. 1 B). (iii) The difference was not due to differences in functional proportion of βγ complexes because in the GTPγS binding assay, a 2-fold difference in βγ concentration elicits an equivalent increase in GTPγS binding (Fig. 2 A). (iv) Thin layer chromatography of βγ complex samples indicated that both samples contained the same concentrations of detergent. (v) Buffer components in the βγ complexes did not contribute to the differential activity because the addition of heat-denatured mutant sample to the wild type and vice versa had no effect. (vi) The differences in M2 activation of wild type and mutant αoβ1γ5 and αoβ1γ5scr also cannot be due to differences in the proportion of prenylated γ5 subunit because the βγ5 and βγ5scr proteins were purified using a His-tagged αi subunit. Prenylation is essential for βγ complex interaction with the α subunit. (vii) New stocks of βγ complexes that were independently expressed, purified, and assayed again showed the same difference in M2-stimulated αo GTPase activity. To examine the affinities of β1γ5 and β1γ5scr for αo in the 1–10 nm concentration range used in the GTPase assays, we used a recently developed assay (12Hou Y. Azpiazu I. Smrcka A. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38961-38964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) that relies on the overlap in binding sites for α subunits and PLC-β2/3 on the βγ complex. Thus binding of αo to the βγ complex inhibits PLC-β3 stimulation by the βγ complex. There was no significant difference in the inhibition of β1γ5 and β1γ5scr, indicating that αo affinity for both is the same (Fig. 4). This result also further confirmed that both the wild type and mutant γ subunits are prenylated to the same extent because prenylation is essential for βγ complex activation of PLC-β. The difference in GTPase activity between mutant and wild type thus arises from differential receptor interaction. The results from the experiment above (Fig. 1 C), where γ5 peptide interaction with M2 was tested, indicated that the γ5 scrambled peptide does not effectively interact with the receptor. An earlier report also indicated that in contrast to the wild type, the scrambled γ5 peptide had little effect on a muscarinic receptor modulation of a Ca2+ current or on a the muscarinic receptor modulation of an excitatory postsynaptic current (3Azpiazu I. Cruzblanca H. Li P. Linder M. Zhuo M. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35305-35308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Viewed in this context, the higher M2-stimulated GTPase activity in the αoβ1γ5scr mutant indicates that weak interaction of the mutant γ subunit C terminus with M2 leads to a higher nucleotide exchange rate. The receptor-G protein activation cycle involves three broad steps: (i) G protein binding to receptor; (ii) receptor-initiated nucleotide exchange in the G protein and dissociation of the ternary complex; and (iii) deactivation of Gα by RGS protein and reassociation with the βγ complex. The difference in receptor-stimulated GTPase rates between the Go wild type and mutant must arise at one of these steps. We infer that differences between mutant and wild type proteins occurs during receptor-initiated nucleotide exchange in the G protein. Other steps in the receptor-G protein activation cycle cannot be affected because the results presented indicate that heterotrimer formation of the mutant is unaltered and that RGS4 has no influence on the differential activation of the mutant. The affected step cannot be initial binding of G protein with receptor because this would lead to lower GTPase rates in the mutant compared with wild type. A model that explains the results here must take into account the effect of the γ subunit mutation on receptor-stimulated nucleotide exchange. It should also take into account (i) the inability of the scrambled γ5 peptide to interact with the receptor and (ii) the higher receptor-stimulated GTPase in mutant Go containing γ5scr. The crystal structure of the G protein heterotrimer (Gt) when compared with the structures of Gαt bound to GTP or GDP indicates that the domains on the α subunit that undergo the most significant changes in conformation during activation are the same domains that contact the β subunit (4Lambright D.G. Sondek J. Bohm A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). It was suggested based on this that the βγ complex occludes nucleotide release from the α subunit when the G protein is bound to the receptor (4Lambright D.G. Sondek J. Bohm A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). Receptor-stimulated nucleotide exchange will therefore require the receptor to shift the βγ complex away from the α subunit (Fig.5 A). This was later detailed as a model for receptor activation of a G protein (16Iiri T. Farfel Z. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1998; 394: 35-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In this model it was proposed that two mechanisms account for the ability of the receptor to stimulate nucleotide exchange in the G protein α subunit: (i) the α subunit C terminus contacts a receptor, and receptor activation leads to conformational changes being triggered through the C-terminal domain to the β6/α5 loop of the α subunit, which is in contact with GDP; (ii) receptor loop(s) enter the cavity between the α subunit and βγ complex, prising them apart and creating an opening through which GDP leaks out. It was proposed in this model that only the α subunit C terminus contacts the receptor and that the C terminus of the γ subunit interacts with membranes, despite evidence to the contrary (6Kisselev O.G. Ermolaeva M.V. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21399-21402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Kisselev O. Pronin A. Ermolaeva M. Gautam N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9102-9106Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Recently, this model has been modified to include the evidence indicating γ subunit interaction with a receptor (3Azpiazu I. Cruzblanca H. Li P. Linder M. Zhuo M. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35305-35308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 6Kisselev O.G. Ermolaeva M.V. Gautam N. J.

A. 1995; 92: 9102-9106Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) to propose that the γ subunit C terminus also interacts with the receptor and that the receptor loops, instead of entering the cavity between the α subunit and βγ complex, actually prise the subunits apart through their interaction with the α and γ subunit C termini (18Rondard P. Iiri T. Srinivasan S. Meng E. Fujita T. Bourne H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6150-6155Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This model is now similar to our earlier proposal that interaction with the α subunit and γ subunit C termini with a receptor is a requirement for G protein activation (2Gautam N. Downes G.B. Yan K. Kisselev O. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar,12Hou Y. Azpiazu I. Smrcka A. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38961-38964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Such a model would predict that mutating the γ subunit C terminus would result in weaker activation of the G protein by the receptor. However, earlier results indicate that this may be a simplistic expectation. Although a γ5 but not a γ7 subunit-specific peptide inhibits muscarinic receptor-stimulated signaling (3Azpiazu I. Cruzblanca H. Li P. Linder M. Zhuo M. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35305-35308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), the M2 muscarinic receptor stimulates higher nucleotide exchange in Go containing γ7 compared with γ5 (12Hou Y. Azpiazu I. Smrcka A. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38961-38964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These results suggested that contrary to expectations, poor interaction of the γ subunit with a receptor can result in more robust G protein activation. This result is not surprising if potential mechanisms underlying nucleotide exchange are considered based on the crystal structures of a G protein. Crystal structures of the heterotrimer and active and inactive α subunits indicate that guanine nucleotide release requires the βγ complex to move away from the α subunit (4Lambright D.G. Sondek J. Bohm A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). Any orientation of the βγ complex that results in exposing the bound GDP will therefore result in more rapid nucleotide release. If the γ subunit does not effectively interact with the receptor and anchor the βγ complex, the βγ complex may be inappropriately oriented with reference to the α subunit. The inappropriately oriented βγ complex will enhance nucleotide exchange by exposing the bound nucleotide in the α subunit. Fig. 5 B shows one such potential orientation of a βγ complex where the γ subunit C terminus does not effectively anchor the βγ complex by interacting with the receptor. As shown in Fig. 5 B, nucleotide exchange in the α subunit will be facilitated by this orientation of the βγ complex. This model predicts that a mutant γ subunit that interacts weakly with a receptor will encourage higher nucleotide exchange in the associated α subunit compared with a wild type γ subunit that interacts strongly with the receptor. This prediction is borne out by the results presented here. Peptide evidence indicates that the γ5scr mutant interacts poorly with the receptor compared with the wild type. However, Go containing the γ5scr mutant shows a higher rate of receptor-stimulated nucleotide exchange compared with the wild type. The model also predicts that a γ subunit type with a lower affinity for the receptor will allow higher rates of receptor-stimulated nucleotide exchange in the associated α subunit compared with a different γ subunit type with a higher affinity for the receptor. This prediction is also supported by previous results. Only the C-terminal peptide specific to γ5 but not γ7 disrupts muscarinic receptor regulation of Ca2+ current in neurons (3Azpiazu I. Cruzblanca H. Li P. Linder M. Zhuo M. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35305-35308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This result indicated that the γ5 subunit type but not γ7 interacts with the M2/M4 receptor types. However, αoβ1γ7 shows significantly higher M2-stimulated nucleotide exchange compared with αoβ1γ5 (12Hou Y. Azpiazu I. Smrcka A. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38961-38964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Thus, consistent with the results obtained with the γ5scr mutant, a G protein containing a γ subunit type that does not interact effectively with a receptor shows enhanced receptor-stimulated GTPase activity in comparison with the wild type. Although αoβ1γ5scr contains a mutant γ subunit that does not effectively interact with the receptor, it still possesses higher receptor-stimulated nucleotide exchange compared with wild type. This result does not imply that a model for receptor activation of a G protein that invokes receptor loops contacting the α and γ subunit C termini and prising the βγ complex away from the α subunit is incorrect. It does suggest that mutational approaches with purified proteins may not provide direct evidence for such a model because any mutant that disturbs the orientation of the βγ complex with reference to the α subunit can potentially encourage nucleotide exchange. As mentioned before, there is evidence for the α subunit N and C termini interacting with the receptor. Inspection of the crystal structure for the heterotrimeric G protein indicates that the α subunit N terminus, C terminus and the γ subunit C terminus lie roughly along the same axis and can be oriented toward the plane of the membrane (Fig. 5). The distance between the C termini of α and γ subunits cannot be estimated precisely in the crystal structure because at least seven residues at the α subunit C terminus are not resolved, and the γ subunit is devoid of the prenyl moiety as well as three residues at its C terminus (4Lambright D.G. Sondek J. Bohm A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). The NMR structure of an 11-amino acid peptide specific to the α subunit C terminus indicates that this domain forms a constrained structure in the presence of a receptor (19Kisselev O.G. Kao J. Ponder J.W. Fann Y.C. Gautam N. Marshall G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4270-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). It is thus likely that the distance between the γ subunit C terminus that includes the prenyl group and the C terminus of the α subunit is less than 40 Å. The crystal structure of inactive rhodopsin that has been determined recently indicates that the intracellular portions of rhodopsin are folded such that the longest distance across the intracellular domains is more than 40 Å (20Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5053) Google Scholar). This indicates that the exposed surface of the receptor will be sufficient for both the α and γ subunit C termini to contact the receptor simultaneously. However, this may not be a requirement if the two domains contact the receptor in a temporal sequence. We propose that by interacting with the receptor, the γ subunit appropriately positions the βγ complex with reference to the α subunit. This can allow the receptor to regulate nucleotide exchange at a site in the α subunit that does not contact the receptor directly.

Recently, a working mechanism for apoE was proposed (Twisk, J., Gillian-Daniel, D. L., Tebon, A., Wang, L., Barrett, P. H., and Attie, A. D. (2000) J. Clin. Invest. 105, 521–532) in which apoE prevents the inhibitory action of the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLr) by binding to it. We have first tested whether this newly described effect of the LDLr on VLDL secretion, obtained in vitro, is also observed in vivo. In LDLr knockout mice (LDLr−/−), the production of VLDL triglycerides and apoB was 30% higher than that in controls. Also the ratio of apoB100:apoB48 secretion was increased in the LDLr−/− mice. The composition of nascent VLDL was similar in both strains. To test whether the action of apoE depends on the presence of the LDLr, VLDL production was measured in LDLr−/− and apoE−/− LDLr−/− mice. Deletion of apoE on a LDLr−/− background still caused a 50% decrease of VLDL triglycerides and apoB production. The composition of nascent VLDL was again similar for both strains. We conclude that the effect of apoE on hepatic VLDL production is independent of the presence of the LDLr.

Ji Z.S. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The role of apoE in lipoprotein metabolism is not confined, however, to the clearance of lipoprotein particles from the circulation. ApoE inhibits lipolysis of lipoproteins by lipoprotein lipase (2Jong M.C. Dahlmans V.E. Hofker M.H. Havekes L.M. Biochem.

More recently, it was demonstrated that apoE also affects the hepatic secretion of very low density lipoproteins (VLDLs): apoE-deficient (apoE−/−) mice showed a reduction in VLDL secretion by some 50% (4Kuipers F. Jong M.C. Lin Y. Eck M. Havinga R. Bloks V. Verkade H.J. Hofker M.H. Moshage H. Berkel T.J. Vonk R.J. Havekes L.M. J. Clin.

Hepatic overexpression of apoE2, apoE3, and apoE4 all stimulated VLDL secretion (7Maugeais C. Tietge U.J. Tsukamoto K. Glick J.M. Rader D.J. J.

R., Teusink, B., Baller, J. F. W., Wolters, H., Havinga, R., Willems van Dijk, K., Havekes, L. M., and Kuipers, F. (2001) Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol., 21, in press.Google Scholar). The mechanism by which apoE affects VLDL assembly and secretion is poorly understood. A recent in vitro study by Twisk et al. (11Twisk J. Gillian-Daniel D.L. Tebon A. Wang L. Barrett P.H. Attie A.D. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 521-532Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) offered a potential mechanism by which apoE might affect VLDL secretion. These authors studied the role of the LDL receptor (LDLr) in production of VLDL. Experiments in cultured hepatocytes of LDLr−/− and control mice showed that LDLr−/− hepatocytes had a strongly increased apoB secretion. This was explained in part by a decreased intracellular degradation of apoB protein. It was concluded that the LDLr binds nascent apoB intracellularly during the course of VLDL assembly, thereby promoting its intracellular degradation. Because apoE and apoB are both ligands for the LDLr, it was suggested that apoE's stimulatory action on VLDL secretion might occur by preventing apoB from binding to the LDLr. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the effect of apoE on VLDL secretion is LDLr-dependent. After verification that the reported in vitro effects of the LDLr can also be observed in the in vivo situation, we tested whether the effect of apoE is LDLr-dependent by knocking out apoE on a LDLr-deficient background. Our results confirm that the LDLr modulates the VLDL production rate in vivo, but they also clearly indicate that the effect of apoE on VLDL production is independent of the presence of the LDLr. all mice were housed under standard conditions with free access to water and regular lab chow. For the comparison between wild type and LDLr−/− mice, male mice with a C57BL/6 background were used. Male animals were also used for comparison of apoE−/− LDLr−/− mice with LDLr−/− mice. Because the apoE−/− LDLr−/− double knockout mice were on a mixed background of C57BL/6 and 129, LDLr−/− mice on the same mixed genetic background as the double knockout mice were used in these experiments as controls. All experiments were approved by the institutional animal care committee. The in vivo VLDL production was measured after intravenous administration of 500 mg/kg Triton WR1339 as described previously (4Kuipers F. Jong M.C. Lin Y. Eck M. Havinga R. Bloks V. Verkade H.J. Hofker M.H. Moshage H. Berkel T.J. Vonk R.J. Havekes L.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2915-2922Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 12Jong M.C. Dahlmans V.E. van Gorp P.J. Breuer M.L.

To measure de novo synthesis of VLDL apoB, 100 µCi of 35S-Tran label (ICN, Zoetermeer, The Netherlands) was injected i.v. 30 min before Triton WR1339 injection. Blood samples were withdrawn from the tail at regular intervals after Triton WR1339 injection. Att = 120 min, an additional large blood sample was withdrawn via the orbital plexus. In each sample, plasma triglycerides (TGs) were determined, and the rate of triglyceride accumulation in plasma was taken as the in vivo rate of VLDL TG production. From the large blood sample at t = 120 min after Triton WR1339 administration, 200 µl of plasma was brought to 1.063 g/ml with potassium bromide in a volume of 2 ml, transferred to SW41 centrifuge tubes, and layered with a 1.006 g/ml salt solution. After 16 h of centrifugation at 37,000 rpm and 4 °C, the VLDL fraction was carefully removed by pipetting off 1.2 ml. ApoB in 0.2 ml of this VLDL fraction was precipitated with isopropanol (13Egusa G. Brady D.W. Grundy S.M. Howard B.V. J. Lipid Res. 1983; 24: 1261-1267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), dissolved in 20% (w/v) SDS, and counted for assessment of total VLDL apoB production. Pilots with blood samples taken at t = 1 min after Triton WR1339 administration showed that basal activity was less than 10% of the value at t = 120 min, and therefore the t = 120 min point was taken as the totalde novo VLDL apoB production. In the remaining VLDL, triglycerides, phospholipids, and cholesterol were measured with commercially available kits as described previously (4Kuipers F. Jong M.C. Lin Y. Eck M. Havinga R. Bloks V. Verkade H.J. Hofker M.H. Moshage H. Berkel T.J. Vonk R.J. Havekes L.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2915-2922Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). This composition of VLDL is a mixture of VLDL that circulated before administration of Triton WR1339 and nascent VLDL produced during the 2-h period after Triton WR1339 administration. To obtain the composition of nascent VLDL, the contribution of circulating VLDL was determined and corrected for, as described previously (14Tacken P.J. Teusink B. Jong M.C. Harats D. Havekes L.M. van Dijk K.W. Hofker M.H. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 2055-2062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For determination of apoB100 and apoB48 production, an aliquot of the blood samples at t = 1 and t = 120 min after Triton WR1339 administration (10 µl) was delipidated by 1.8 ml of −20 °C diethyl ether:methanol (1:1), and, after centrifugation in an Eppendorff centrifuge (13,000 rpm, 10 min), the pellet was dissolved in sample buffer for SDS-PAGE analysis on a 5% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel. A volume corresponding to 5 µl of plasma was loaded onto the gel. The gel was fixed by Coomassie staining (BioSafe Coomassie; Bio-Rad) and dried overnight between two cellophane sheets using a GradiDry gel drying solution (Gradipore). After drying, one sheet was carefully removed, and the uncovered part of the gel was autoradiographed with phosphoimager technology. Nonparametric Mann-WhitneyU tests were used for all statistical analyses.p ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant. First we tested whether the LDLr affects the VLDL secretion rate in vivo. Hepatic VLDL triglyceride and apoB production rates were measured by intravenous injection of 35S-Tran label and Triton WR1339 in 4-h-fasted mice. As shown in Fig.1A, LDLr−/− mice showed a 30% increase in the triglyceride production rate as compared with wild type animals (162 ± 42 and 211 ± 12 µmol·kg−1·h−1 for wild type and LDLr−/− animals, respectively; p < 0.005). Total apoB production (Fig. 1B) was also significantly increased by ∼30% in LDLr−/− mice as compared with wild type mice (100 ± 19% and 132 ± 42% for wild type and LDLr−/− mice, respectively; p < 0.05). We also measured the de novo synthesis rate of B100 and B48 by SDS-PAGE analysis of plasma collected 1 and 120 min after Triton WR1339 injection (Fig.1C). No significant differences could be observed between the LDLr−/− and wild type mice for apoB100 and apoB48 production rates, although the former strain secreted relatively more apoB100. This was evident from a significantly higher apoB100:apoB48 ratio (2.02 ± 0.39 and 1.26 ± 0.42 for LDLr−/− and wild type mice, respectively; p < 0.02). We have also analyzed the lipid composition of the nascent VLDL particles after Triton WR1339 injection (Fig.2). We confirmed that Triton WR1339 itself did not affect the lipid composition of lipoprotein particles. 2B. Teusink and H. van der Boom, unpublished observations. The composition of nascent VLDL was very similar between the LDLr−/− and wild type mice; both groups had triglycerides comprising ∼75% of total lipid mass. Circulating VLDL from LDLr−/− mice was somewhat lower in triglyceride content than VLDL of the wild type mice (50% and 69%, respectively). To determine whether the effect of apoE is dependent on the LDLr, we have characterized VLDL production and composition in apoE−/− LDLr−/− double knockout mice and LDLr −/− mice. As seen in Fig. 3A, the VLDL TG production was approximately 2-fold lower in the apoE−/− LDLr−/− mice as compared with the LDLr−/− mice (77 ± 16 and 132 ± 39 µmol·kg−1·h−1 for apoE−/− LDLr−/− mice and LDLr−/− mice, respectively; p < 0.005). A similar result was obtained for the total VLDL apoB production (Fig. 3B). The rate of total apoB production was significantly lower in the apoE−/− LDLr−/− mice than in the LDLr−/− mice (53 ± 17% and 100 ± 39% for apoE−/− LDLr−/− mice and LDLr−/− mice, respectively; p = 0.01). In Fig. 3C, SDS-PAGE analysis of plasma collected 1 and 120 min after Triton WR1339 administration is shown for the apoE−/− LDLr−/− double knockout mice and the LDLr−/− mice. Most strikingly, apoB100 production in the apoE−/− LDLr−/− mice was severely diminished to only 10% of that of the LDLr−/− mice. In Fig. 4, the average composition of nascent and circulating VLDL is shown. Because of the high lipid levels in apoE−/− LDLr−/− mice before Triton WR1339 injection, the nascent VLDL composition is calculated using the differences in lipids between total VLDL 2 h after Triton WR1339 administration and the circulating VLDL lipid content (i.e. the lipids present before Triton WR1339 administration). In both mouse models, nascent VLDL was rich in triglycerides. Large differences were found in circulating VLDL: VLDL of the apoE−/− LDLr−/− mice contained only 7% TGs as compared with 50% TGs in the LDLr−/− mice. In this study, we have tested the hypothesis that the effect of apoE on VLDL secretion is mediated via intracellular interaction with the LDL receptor. If this hypothesis were true, we reasoned that the 50% reduction of VLDL secretion as observed in the apoE−/− mouse compared with the wild type mouse controls (4Kuipers F. Jong M.C. Lin Y. Eck M. Havinga R. Bloks V. Verkade H.J. Hofker M.H. Moshage H. Berkel T.J. Vonk R.J. Havekes L.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2915-2922Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 5Mensenkamp A.R.

Fig. 3 shows that the effect of deleting apoE in reducing VLDL secretion was independent of the LDL receptor: a 50% reduction of both VLDL apoB and TGs was observed in the apoE−/− LDLr−/− mouse as compared with the LDLr−/− controls. The conclusion that apoE acts on the VLDL assembly pathway irrespective of the presence of the LDLr is indirectly supported by other recent studies. On one hand, it was shown that apoE2, a variant of apoE that binds poorly to lipoprotein receptors (15Mahley R.W. Science. 1988; 240: 622-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (3392) Google Scholar), is still capable of stimulating VLDL secretion (3de Beer F. van Dijk K.W. Jong M.C. van Vark L.C. van Der Zee A. Hofker M.H. Fallaux F.J. Hoeben R.C. Smelt A.H. Havekes L.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1800-1806Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 7Maugeais C. Tietge U.J. Tsukamoto K. Glick J.M.

Invest. 1997; 100: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). On the other hand, truncation of apoE at the C-terminal lipid-binding domain abolishes the stimulatory effect of apoE on VLDL secretion (16Kypreos K.E. Teusink B. Willems V.D. Havekes L.M. Zannis V.I. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1598-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 17Kypreos K.E. Willems van Dijk K. Van der Zee A. Havekes L.M. Zannis V.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19778-19786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This truncated form of apoE is properly transcribed and detectable in plasma associated with VLDL particles, and it still contains an intact LDLr binding domain as judged by rescue from hyperlipidemia in apoE−/− mice. Thus, if competition of apoE with apoB for binding to the LDLr was the mechanism of apoE's action on VLDL secretion, the truncated apoE protein should still be able to increase VLDL secretion, whereas apoE2 should not be able to do so. Because the opposite is observed, we conclude that lipid binding, rather than receptor binding, is important for the stimulation of VLDL production by apoE. Although apoE does not act via the LDL receptor, we did confirmin vivo that absence of the LDLr enhances VLDL apoB secretion as described previously for mouse hepatocytes (11Twisk J. Gillian-Daniel D.L. Tebon A. Wang L. Barrett P.H. Attie A.D. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 521-532Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, LDLr deficiency leads to a 30% increase in VLDL apoB production. Also, the rate of VLDL TG secretion was increased by 30% in LDLr−/− mice. The effects of the LDL receptor on VLDL apoB100 and apoB48 secretion were too small for our analysis to give significant differences. However, we found a significant increase in the ratio of secreted apoB100:apoB48 particles in the LDLr−/− mice. Thus, although the effect of the LDLr on VLDL apoB production in vivo is much smaller than that observed in vitro, it is in line with the previous in vitro observation that apoB100 secretion was increased 3–4-fold, and apoB48 was increased only 1.5–2-fold (11Twisk J. Gillian-Daniel D.L. Tebon A. Wang L. Barrett P.H. Attie A.D. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 521-532Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been reported that the genetic background can have a large impact on the rate of VLDL secretion (18Voyiaziakis E. Ko C. O'Rourke S.M. Huang L. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 2004-2012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the apoE−/− LDLr−/− mice were on a mixed background of C57BL/6 and 129, we used LDLr−/− mice that were on the same mixed background. Our data confirm the impact of genetic background: when the rate of VLDL TG secretion is compared between the LDLr−/− mice on the two genetic backgrounds used in this study, the mice on a C57/BL6 background clearly had a higher VLDL TG secretion as compared with mice on the mixed background (211 ± 12 and 132 ± 39 µmol·kg−1·h−1, respectively). The composition of nascent VLDL was similar for all mouse models tested, comprising ∼70–75% triglycerides (Figs. 2 and 4). The TG content of the apoE−/− LDLr−/− mice was higher, i.e.88%, but this is likely the result of the large contribution of circulating VLDL to the total VLDL fraction after Triton WR1339 administration. In particular, the cholesterol content of nascent VLDL is prone to large error because of the enormous amount of cholesterol already present in these mice (19van Dijk K.W. van Vlijmen B.J. De Winther M.P. van't Hof B. van Der, Zee A. van Der Boom H. Havekes L.M. Hofker M.H. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 2945-2951Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 20Ishibashi S. Herz J. Maeda N. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4431-4435Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Similar TG content of nascent VLDL is consistent with the fact that both total apoB and VLDL TG secretion were affected to the same extent in both Figs. 1 and 3. Maugeais et al. (7Maugeais C. Tietge U.J. Tsukamoto K. Glick J.M. Rader D.J. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1673-1679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) previously reached a similar conclusion regarding the effect of apoE isoforms on VLDL production,i.e. that both apoB and TGs were affected. However, we have recently seen that the particles secreted by hepatocytes of apoE−/− mice were smaller, although they were of similar composition (4Kuipers F. Jong M.C. Lin Y. Eck M. Havinga R. Bloks V. Verkade H.J. Hofker M.H. Moshage H. Berkel T.J. Vonk R.J. Havekes L.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2915-2922Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). It appears that particle size and lipid composition are not always tightly correlated, but it remains to be seen whether this observation is specific for particles lacking apoE. In the mouse models tested in this study and also in other mouse models, e.g. the VLDLr−/− LDLr−/− mouse (14Tacken P.J. Teusink B. Jong M.C. Harats D. Havekes L.M. van Dijk K.W. Hofker M.H. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 2055-2062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the apoE−/− mouse (4Kuipers F. Jong M.C. Lin Y. Eck M. Havinga R. Bloks V. Verkade H.J. Hofker M.H. Moshage H. Berkel T.J. Vonk R.J. Havekes L.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2915-2922Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), nascent VLDL invariably contained ∼65–80% triglycerides. This contrasts with studies in humans or in vitro systems. Compartmental modeling of apoB lipoprotein metabolism in humans invariably requires the input of particles into the plasma compartment ranging from large buoyant VLDL to LDL (21Packard C.J. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1999; 10: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 22Packard C.J. Demant T. Stewart J.P. Bedford D. Caslake M.J. Schwertfeger G. Bedynek A. Shepherd J. Seidel D. J.

Biol. 1997; 17: 3542-3556Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Also, in in vitro experiments, the size (i.e.triglyceride content) of the lipoprotein particles produced varies and appears to be related to lipid availability (for review, see Ref. 24Davis R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1440: 1-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), although it has been suggested that lipolytic activity in the medium may account for at least some of the observed effects (25Arrol S. Mackness M.I. Durrington P.N. Atherosclerosis. 2000; 150: 255-264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We2 and others (26Aalto-Setala K. Fisher E.A. Chen X. Chajek-Shaul T. Hayek T. Zechner R. Walsh A. Ramakrishnan R. Ginsberg H.N. Breslow J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1889-1900Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have verified that catabolism of VLDL is completely blocked by Triton WR1339 administration, thus the composition of the VLDL that subsequently accumulates should be a direct measure of the composition of nascent VLDL. Therefore, we conclude that in contrast to the human situation, mice secrete VLDL rather homogeneously as triglyceride-rich particles. It therefore appears that in mice, the rate of VLDL production is regulated not so much by VLDL composition as by particle number, i.e. by degradation of nascent apoB protein and/or pre-VLDL particles during the second stage of VLDL assembly (24Davis R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1440: 1-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 27Olofsson S.O. Asp L. Boren J. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1999; 10: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The large differences in the TG content of circulating VLDL as opposed to nascent VLDL (Figs. 2and 4) reflect differences in VLDL catabolism (10Mensenkamp, A. R., Teusink, B., Baller, J. F.

We observed an unexpected effect of combined apoE and LDLr deficiency on the secretion of apoB100 particles: in the apoE−/− LDLr−/− mice, the secretion of apoB100 was reduced to only 10% of that in LDLr−/− mice. In apoE−/− mice, apoB100 production is at most 50% lower (5Mensenkamp A.R. Jong M.C. van Goor H. van Luyn M.J. Bloks V. Havinga R. Voshol P.J. Hofker M.H. van Dijk K.W. Havekes L.M. Kuipers F. J.

At this moment, we can only speculate on the mechanism that underlies this striking observation. Rather, we would like to discuss some fundamental differences between B100- and B48-containing lipoproteins that may be relevant in rationalizing our observations. ApoB48 does not bind to the LDLr but rather requires the LDLr-related protein for endocytosis (28Rohlmann A. Gotthardt M. Hammer R.E. Herz J. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 29Veniant M.M. Zlot C.H. Walzem R.L. Pierotti V. Driscoll R. Dichek D. Herz J. Young S.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1559-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). LDLr-related protein-mediated uptake of lipoproteins depends on apoE (30Linton M.F. Hasty A.H. Babaev V.R. Fazio S. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1726-1736Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Therefore, in the apoE−/− mouse, the LDLr and the LDLr-related protein are not able to take up apoB48 particles. However, secretion of apoB48 particles by the liver still continues (5Mensenkamp A.R. Jong M.C. van Goor H. van Luyn M.J. Bloks V. Havinga R. Voshol P.J. Hofker M.H. van Dijk K.W. Havekes L.M. Kuipers F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35711-35718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 7Maugeais C. Tietge U.J. Tsukamoto K. Glick J.M. Rader D.J. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1673-1679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the rate of apoB48 particle secretion should equal the rate of apoB48 particle uptake in steady state, this implies that other receptors should be present to clear these apoB48 particles. One receptor may be the recently cloned apoB48 receptor (31Brown M.L. Ramprasad M.P. Umeda P.K. Tanaka A. Kobayashi Y. Watanabe T. Shimoyamada H. Kuo W.L. Li R. Song R. Bradley W.A. Gianturco S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7488-7493Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In the LDLr−/− apoE−/− mouse, apoB100 particles must also be cleared by receptors other than the LDLr and the LDLr-related protein. It appears that these back-up systems perform poorly because Ishibashiet al. (20Ishibashi S. Herz J. Maeda N. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4431-4435Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) found that plasma B100 levels were well detectable (∼50% of normal) in these mice, despite the very low production rate that we have observed in this study. The extremely low TG content of the circulating VLDL as compared with that in the wild type also suggests very poor clearance of VLDL particles. It may be envisaged that the reduced VLDL apoB100 secretion rate in apoE−/− LDLr−/− mice is the result of some unknown feedback mechanism to maintain steady state and prevent unrestrained accumulation of apoB100 particles in the circulation. Such a feedback on VLDL secretion is only hypothetical at this moment; yet it becomes apparent that factors such as apoE and the LDLr that are clearly involved in lipoprotein uptake are also involved in VLDL production. The concept of hepatic VLDL production as a merely substrate-driven process (32Lewis G.F. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1997; 8: 146-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) thus requires considerable sophistication.
