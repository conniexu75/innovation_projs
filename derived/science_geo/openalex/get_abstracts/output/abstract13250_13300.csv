https://openalex.org/W2049043712,"Human diploid epidermis epidermal cells have been successfully grown in serial culture. To initiate colony formation, they require the presence of fibroblasts, but proliferation of fibroblasts must be controlled so that the epidermal cell population is not overgrown. Both conditions can be achieved by the use of lethally irradiated 3T3 cells at the correct density. When trypsinized human skin cells are plated together with the 3T3 cells, the growth of the human fibroblasts is largely suppressed, but epidermal cells grow from single cells into colonies. Each colony consists of keratinocytes ultimately forming a stratified squamous epithelium in which the dividing cells are confined to the lowest layer(s). Hydrocortisone is added to the medium, since in secondary and subsequent subcultures it makes the colony morphology more oderly and distinctive, and maintains proliferation at a slightly greater rate. Under these culture conditions, it is possible to isolate keratinocyte clones free of viable fibroblasts. Like human diploid fibroblasts, human diploid keratinocytes appear to have a finite culture lifetime. For 7 strains studied, the culture lifetime ranged from 20-50 cell generations. The plating efficiency of the epidermal cells taken directly from skin was usually 0.1-1.0%. On subsequent transfer of the cultures initiated from newborns, the plating efficiency rose to 10% or higher, but was most often in the range of 1-5% and dropped sharply toward the end of their culture life. The plating efficiency and culture lifetime were lower for keratinocytes of older persons."
https://openalex.org/W2045934824,"From a transplantable mouse teratoma it has been possible to derive an established keratinizing cell line (XB) which grows well in cultures containing lethally irradiated 3T3 fibroblasts at the correct density. Single cells of the keratinizing line grow into colonies each consisting of a stratified squamous epithelium. The keratinizing nature of the colonies has been demonstrated by specific staining with Rhodanile blue, and by light and electron microscopy of sections through the colonies. A function of fibroblasts appears to be a strict requirement for keratinization and an important though less strict requirement for cell growth. The fibroblast function can be carried out by medium harvested from 3T3 cultures. It is possible to detect keratinizing colonies in primary cultures of disaggregated teratoma cells combined with 3T3 cells. Such colonies appeared in cultures of a transplantable teratoma with an overall frequency of 6 X 10(-6) of the cells plated. Nonkeratinizing colonies of cells with otherwise very similar appearance were about 10 fold more abundant. Since both the keratinizing and the related nonkeratinizing colonies can be identified in the living state, it is possible to isolate them from the primary cultures."

It is effective at one hundredth the concentration required of dimethylsulfoxide, a most effective inducing agent. Studies using a variety of analogues and metabolites suggest that the structural features of butyric acid are rather stringently required for induction. This effect is considered in view of the fact that butyric acid is a naturally occurring fatty acid, is effective in relatively low concentrations, and is widely used to form derivatives of cAMP."
https://openalex.org/W2035633375,"Mapping with the restriction enzymes Sal 1 and R1 has generated a picture of the organization of Dictyostelium ribosomal DNA. The DNA which codes for 17S and 25S ribosomal RNAs is located within a stretch of repetitive DNA at least 38,000 base pairs long. This repeated unit includes 5S DNA, linked to 25S DNA. Two techniques were especially useful in the mapping: ""cloning"" 14S + 25S DNA on the plasmid pMB9 to amplify individual R1 fragments, and digesting DNA with R1 in the presence of the antibiotic distamycin A to produce specific partial digestion products."
https://openalex.org/W2069062868,"The organization of three sequence classes—single copy, repetitive, and inverted repeated sequences—within the human genome has been studied by renaturation techniques, hydroxylapatite binding methods, and DNA hyperchromism. Repetitive sequence classes are distributed throughout 80% or more of the genome. Slightly more than half of the genome consists of short single copy sequences, with a length of about 2 kb interspersed with repetitive sequences. The average length of the repetitive sequences is also small and approximates the length of these sequences found in other organisms. The sequence organization of the human genome therefore resembles the sequence organization found in Xenopus and sea urchin. The inverted repeats are essentially randomly positioned with respect to both sequence class and sequence arrangement, so that all three sequence classes are found to be mutually interspersed in a portion of the genome."

https://openalex.org/W1509464307,"Two forms of deoxythymidine kinase from blast cells of acute myelocytic leukemia were identified by electrophoresis. One was associated mainly with the cytoplasm and the other with mitochondria. Both isozymes were separated and purified by differential affinity column chromatography which resulted in 2416- and 1634-fold purification of the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial enzymes, respectively. Affinity gel was prepared by linkage through position 3' of deoxythymidine. Each enzyme had the same electrophoretic mobility in the purified state as it did in the enzyme derived from the corresponding subcellular fraction of the homogenate. Thymidine phosphorylase was not retarded by the affinity column. The purified cytoplasmic and mitochondrial deoxythymidine kinase had different molecular weights, sensitivities to inhibition by ammonium sulfate, activation energies for the reaction and divalent cation requirements. Adenosine, guanosine, and cytosine 3':5'-monophosphates, putrescine, spermine, and spermidine were neither activators nor inhibitors of either deoxythymidine kinase."

https://openalex.org/W2050403417,Erythroid differentiation can be readily induced by butyric acid in cultured erythroleukemic cells in the presence of inhibitors of DNA synthesis and in the absence of cell division. This result appears to rule out more complex models for globin gene expression which require gene replication or cell division (or both).

https://openalex.org/W1969804030,"Sucrose gradient analysis of total sea urchin DNA cleaved with the EcoRI and Hind III restriction endonucleases and identification of histone coding gene sequences by hybridization with histone mRNA have elucidated the basic organization of the histone gene repeat unit. These data, plus results obtained by electrophoretic analysis of purified endonuclease-cleaved sea urchin histone DNA and hybridization with cRNA transcribed from the eucaryotic segment of constructed plasmid chimeras cloned in E. coli, show that the several DNA sequences coding for individual histone proteins are intermingled in a 7 kilobase (kb) repeat unit. Cleavage of total sea urchin DNA with EcoRI produces 2.2 and 4.8 kb fragments, and which are contained in a 7 kb Hind III fragment. Cleavage with both enzymes reveals that the 2.2 kb EcoRI fragment contains a Hind III site 0.15--0.2 kb from an end. RNA.DNA hybridization between chimeric palsmic DNA and purified individual mRNAs isolated from sea urchin embryo polyribosomes has been used to assign coding sequences to either the 2.2 or 4.8 kb region of the histone DNA repeat unit. A map of the histone genes is proposed."

https://openalex.org/W1964233699,"Initiator tRNAs from the cytoplasm of salmon testes and salmon liver have been purified. The nucleotide sequence of these initiator tRNAs has been determined and found identical to that of initiator tRNA from mammalian cytoplasm. The only difference is the extent of modification of the nucleoside located between the dihydrouridine and the anticodon stems. In the salmon tRNAs, this modified nucleoside is predominantly N2N2-dimethyl guanosine, whereas in the mammalian initiator tRNA it is N2-methyl guanosine."
https://openalex.org/W1968563219,"Most of the Dictyostellum ribosomal nontrascribed spacer DNA has been mapped using Eco R1, Hind III, and Sal I restriction digests and recombinant plasmids containing parts of the rDNA (ribosomal DNA). The repeat units are at least 42 kb (1 kilobase = 1000 base pairs = 1 kb) long; of this, 8 kb codes for the 36S rRNA precursor. The repeat units give a homogeneous pattern of Sal I, Eco R1, and Hind III restriction fragments. The repeats could be linked by a heterogeneous region in the nontrascribed spacer, not tandemly repeated, or linked in a more complicated structural arrangement. The total rDNA comprises at least 18% of the nuclear DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2041314239,"The surface proteins of Thy-1 positive mouse lymphomas and Thy-1 negative variants were labeled by lactoperoxidase-catalyzed iodination and characterized by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecylsulphate and by immunological studies. The loss of the serologically defined Thy-1 antigenic determinant correlated with the absence of a radioactive band corresponding to a T lymphocyte-specific surface glycoprotein, T25, on autoradiographs of the iodinated proteins of Thy-1 negative variants. Reexpression of Thy-1 on hybrid cells dervied from fusions of complementary Thy-1 negative variants correlated with the reappearance of T25. Quantitative absorption studies using an antiserum which specifically recognized T25 confirmed that the Thy-1 negative variants have no detectable T25 (less than 0.03 of that of the Thy-1 positive lines) on their surface. Biosynthetic labeling studies revealed that none of the Thy-1 negative variants synthesized T25. However, synthesis of an immunologically cross-reactive molecule could be detected in two variants. On the basis of these results, we propose a model which describes a possible structure of the Thy-1 antigenic determinant and explains the biochemical nature of the genetic lesions leading to the loss of Thy-1 in these variants."

https://openalex.org/W1518967257,"The material obtained from reduced hen egg white lysozyme after complete air oxidation at pH 8.0 and 37 degrees has yielded, by gel filtration on a Bio-Gel P-30 column, enzymically active species and an enzymically inactive form which eluted sooner than the active species but later than expected for a dimer of lysozyme. Reduced lysozyme also elutes at the same position as this inactive material. Examination of the fragments produced on CNBr cleavage of the inactive form indicates that at least 24% of the population contains incorrect disulfide bonds involving half-cystine residues 6, 30, 115, and 127. Tryptophan fluorescence and the intrinsic viscosity of the inactive form show an enlarged molecular domain with a disordered conformation. The yield of the inactive form increases as the oxidation of reduced lysozyme is accelerated using cupric ion. In the presence of 4 X 10(-5) M cupric ion, reduced lysozyme forms almost quantitatively the inactive form, which is almost completely converted to the native form by sulfhydryl-disulfide interchange catalyzed by thiol groups of either reduced lysozyme or beta-mercaptoethanol. The material trapped by alkylation of the free sulfhydryl groups with [1-14C]iodoacetic acid during the early stage of air oxidation of reduced lysozyme was fractionated by gel filtration to permit separation of the active species from the inactive form. Ion exchange chromatography of the active species yielded completely renatured lysozyme and three major enzymically active radioactive derivatives. Two of these derivatives contained approximately 2 mol of S-carboxymethylcysteine. Isolation and characterization of radioactive tryptic peptides from each of the three active forms, permitted the identification of Cys 6 and Cys 127, Cys 76 and 94, and Cys 80 as the sulfhydryl groups alkylated in these three incompletely oxidized, partially active forms. Thus, it appears that the interatomic interactions maintaining the compact three-dimensional structure of native lysozyme are operational even when one of these three native disulfide bonds between Cys 6 and Cys 127, Cys 76 and Cys 94, and Cys 64 and 80 is open."

https://openalex.org/W2410163385,"The reaction sequence for the biosynthesis of gangliosides by mouse neuroblastoma cells has been investigated by studying the pattern of incorporation of labeled precursors into sialoglycosphingolipids. Cultured NB41A cells incorporated N-[3H]acetylmannosamine into the sialic acid moiety of GM3 in less than 10 min. Labeled GM2 was not detected in cells incubated for less than 30 min, while measurable radioactivity did not appear in GM1 until after 60 to 90 min. Analogous experiments were carried out using [14C]galactose. No significant amount of labeled hexose was incorporated into asialo-GM2 during 60 min of culture. These studies are in accord with results of previous studies on glycosyltransferases of NB41A cells (Kemp, S. F., and Stoolmiller, A. C. (1976), J. Neurochem. 26, 723-732), and further support the concept that the pathway of synthesis of gangliosides proceeds via GM3 leads to GM2 leads to GM1."

https://openalex.org/W2059236860,"The pladmid RK2 is stably maintained in a broad range of gram-negative bacteria. The RK2 DNA has a single Eco RI restriction site. The insertion of a DNA fragment into this site does not interfere with either plasmid maintenance or self-transmissibility. Because RK2 has a broad host range, it should be useful for the construction in vitro of hybrid plasmid molecules capable of being established by conjugal transfer or transformation into many genera of gram-negative organisms."

https://openalex.org/W3205776411,"At a dose as low as 1 microgram per kilogram of body weight, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) significantly decreased the suppressive effect of electric shock on licking behavior of the rat. Attenuation of punishment was also obtained with mescaline, but neither dimethyltryptamine nor delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol was active in this test. Cyproheptadine and alpha-propyldopacetamide, drugs that interfere with the function of neurons that contain serotonin, have a behavioral effect similar to that of LSD and mescaline, which suggests that the attenuation of punishment produced by these hallucinogens may result from decreased activity of such neurons."

Male Sprague-Dawley rats were rendered physically dependent on ethanol by intragastric administration of ethanol at a dosage of 9 to 15 grams per kilogram per day over a 4-day period. A nonintoxicating oral dose of 1,3-butanediol at 4 grams per kilogram administered after elimination of ethanol from the blood was effective against the tremulous and convulsive components of the ethanol withdrawal syndrome in all animals for 1 to 5 hours. This period coincided with the time of maximum severity of the withdrawal syndrome, as seen in the control animals."
