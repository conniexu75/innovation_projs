https://openalex.org/W2081472291,"The hepatitis B virus (HBV) X gene product trans-activates viral and cellular genes. The X protein (pX) does not bind independently to nucleic acids. The data presented here demonstrate that pX entered into a protein-protein complex with the cellular transcriptional factors CREB and ATF-2 and altered their DNA binding specificities. Although CREB and ATF-2 alone did not bind to the HBV enhancer element, a pX-CREB or pX-ATF-2 complex did bind to the HBV enhancer. Thus, the ability of pX to interact with cellular factors broadened the DNA binding specificity of these regulatory proteins and provides a mechanism for pX to participate in transcriptional regulation. This strategy of altered binding specificity may modify the repertoire of genes that can be regulated by transcriptional factors during viral infection."
https://openalex.org/W1520223434,"The interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) is a protein capable of inhibiting receptor binding and biological activities of IL-1 without inducing an IL-1-like response. Equilibrium binding and kinetic experiments show that IL-1ra binds to the 80-kDa IL-1 receptor on the murine thymoma cell line EL4 with an affinity (KD = 150 pM) approximately equal to that of IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta for this receptor. However, IL-1ra is unable to induce two early events associated with IL-1 activity. Surface-bound IL-1ra does not undergo receptor-mediated internalization, and IL-1ra does not activate the protein kinase activity responsible for down-modulation of the EGF receptor on the murine 3T3 fibroblast cell line. The failure to induce general, early responses characteristic of IL-1 indicates that IL-1ra is unlikely to act as an agonist on any cell expressing the 80-kDa receptor."

https://openalex.org/W1992117629,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by extensive synaptic and neuronal loss and by plaque formation in the cortex, but the mechanisms responsible for synaptic plasticity in the neocortex are still not completely understood. To analyze the sprouting response in AD cortex, we compared the patterns of GAP-43 with synaptophysin immunoreactivity. In AD, GAP-43 immunohistochemistry revealed extensive sprouting in the hippocampal molecular layer, stratum polymorphous, CA1 region, and prosubiculum. These regions presented abundant anti-GAP-43-immunoreactive coiled fibers and dystrophic neurites in association with plaques. Some of these sprouting structures were colocalized with anti-synapto-physin- and anti-neurofilament-positive neurites. The AD neocortex was characterized by an overall decrease in GAP-43 immunoreactivity accompanied by sprouting neurites in the areas of synaptic pathology. We conclude that GAP-43 might be involved in the mechanisms of synaptic plasticity in the AD cortex, as well as in the process of aberrant sprouting in the neuritic plaques."
https://openalex.org/W1525421301,"Recent studies have identified inositol 1,4,5-tris-phosphate(InsP3)-sensitive and -insensitive Ca2+ pools and a GTP-dependent mechanism that transfers Ca2+ between them. Here, the Ca2+ pump-inhibitory sesquiterpene lactone, thapsigargin, is shown to distinguish these two Ca2+ pools and identify a third Ca2+ pumping pool unresponsive to InsP3 or GTP. Using saponin-permeabilized DDT1MF-2 smooth muscle cells, approximately 75% of total intracellular ATP-dependent Ca2+ accumulation is blocked by thapsigargin with an IC50 of 30 nM. In contrast, 1 mM vanadate or 5 microM A23187 block 100% of Ca2+ accumulation. The thapsigargin-responsive Ca2+ pool corresponds exactly to that released by 10 microM InsP3 in the presence of 10 microM GTP. Indeed, addition of InsP3 with GTP has no effect on Ca2+ accumulated in the presence of 3 microM thapsigargin whereas A23187 releases all the remaining Ca2+. Added after maximal Ca2+ uptake, thapsigargin induces only slow Ca2+ release consistent with blockade of pumping activity. Unlike InsP3, the action of thapsigargin is entirely heparin insensitive. The large increment in Ca2+ uptake caused by 12 mM oxalate is completely reversed by thapsigargin, indicating that thapsigargin functions on an oxalate-permeable pool. Moreover, the still larger uptake induced by GTP in the presence of oxalate is also completely reversed by either thapsigargin or InsP3. The results indicate that thasigargin blocks Ca2+ uptake into two discrete pools: the InsP3-sensitive, oxalate-permeable Ca2+ pool and the InsP3-insensitive, oxalate-impermeable Ca2+ pool that can be recruited into the InsP3-sensitive pool by GTP-dependent Ca2+ translocation (Ghosh, T. K., Mullaney, J.M., Tarazi, F.I., and Gill, D.L. (1989) Nature 340, 236-239). Additionally, a third Ca2+ pool is defined, unreleasable by InsP3 or GTP, and containing a thapsigargin-insensitive Ca2+ pump."

https://openalex.org/W1987060667,"The circumsporozoite (CS) protein has been the target for development of malaria sporozoite vaccines for a decade. However, immunization with subunit vaccines based on the CS protein has never given the complete protection found after immunization with irradiated sporozoites. BALB/c mice immunized with irradiated Plasmodium yoelii sporozoites produced antibodies and cytotoxic T cells against a 140-kilodalton protein, sporozoite surface protein 2 (SSP2). Mice immunized with P815 cells that had been transfected with either SSP2 or CS genes were partially protected, and those immunized with a mixture of SSP2 and CS transfectants were completely protected against malaria. These studies emphasize the importance of vaccine delivery systems in achieving protection and define a multi-antigen sporozoite vaccine."
https://openalex.org/W1480048429,"Abstract Secretory vesicles that accumulate in the temperature-sensitive sec6-4 strain of yeast have been shown to contain a vanadate-sensitive ATPase, presumably en route to the plasma membrane (Walworth, N. C., and Novick, P. J. (1987) J. Cell Biol. 105, 163-174). We have now established this enzyme to be a fully functional form of the PMA1 [H+]ATPase, identical in its catalytic properties to that found in the plasma membrane. In addition, the secretory vesicles are sealed tightly enough to permit the measurement of ATP-dependent proton pumping with fluorescent probes. We have gone on to exploit the vesicles as an expression system for site-directed mutants of the ATPase. For this purpose, a sec6-4 strain has been constructed in which the chromosomal PMA1 gene is under control of the GAL1 promoter; the mutant pma1 allele to be studied is introduced on a centromeric plasmid under the control of a novel heat shock promoter. In galactose medium at 23 degrees C, the wild-type ATPase is produced and supports normal vegetative growth. When the cells are switched to glucose medium at 37 degrees C, however, the wild-type gene turns off, the mutant gene turns on, and secretory vesicles accumulate. The vesicles contain a substantial amount of newly synthesized, plasmid-encoded ATPase (5-10% of total vesicle protein), but only traces of residual wild-type PMA1 ATPase and no detectable mitochondrial ATPase, vacuolar ATPase, or acid or alkaline phosphatase. To test the expression strategy, we have made use of pma1-105 (Ser368----Phe), a vanadate-resistant mutant previously characterized by standard methods (Perlin, D. S., Harris, S. L., Seto-Young, D., and Haber, J. E. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 21857-21864). In secretory vesicles, as expected, the plasmid-borne pma1-105 allele gives rise to a mutant enzyme with a reduced rate of ATP hydrolysis and a 100-fold increase in Ki for vanadate. Proton pumping is similarly resistant to vanadate. Thus, the vesicles appear well suited for the production and characterization of mutant forms of the PMA1 [H+]ATPase. They should also aid the study of other yeast membrane proteins that are essential for growth as well as heterologous proteins whose appearance in the plasma membrane may be toxic to the cell."
https://openalex.org/W1510528711,"We have used the zero-length cross-linker 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC) to examine protein-protein associations within purified outer arm dynein and axonemes from Chlamydomonas flagella. When axonemes were treated with 0.5-1 mM EDC in either the presence or absence of ATP/vanadate, a polypeptide band of Mr 127,000 recognized by monoclonal antibody 1878A (specific for the Mr 78,000 intermediate chain (IC78) of outer arm dynein) was generated. This conjugate was not obtained when purified dynein was treated with EDC. Further immunological analysis demonstrated that this complex also contained alpha- (but not beta-) tubulin. These results indicate that IC78 interacts with alpha-tubulin in situ in an ATP-insensitive manner. Identification of this interface between dynein and tubulin suggests that IC78, which probably is located at the base of the dynein particle (King, S. M., and Witman, G. B. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 19807-19811), contributes to the structural attachment of the dynein arms to the A-tubules of the outer doublet microtubules. Analysis of the cross-linked products from the purified dynein revealed several additional interactions involving the intermediate chains; these adducts provide further evidence for an intermediate chain/light chain complex within dynein and confirm that IC78 and IC69 associate directly."
https://openalex.org/W1587846326,"The mRNA encoding the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ ATPase is highly influenced by thyroid hormone (T3) in the hearts of intact animals. We show here that this effect of T3 can be mimicked in primary neonatal rat cardiocytes, both in serum-containing and in serum-free media; the expression of SR Ca2+ ATPase mRNA is myocyte-specific and is also modulated by retinoic acid (RA). RA also induces myosin heavy chain (MHC) alpha-mRNA in this system. The induction of Ca2+ ATPase mRNA is sensitive to T3 (EC50 approximately 30 pM) and less sensitive to RA (EC50 approximately 2 nM). Transient transfection experiments utilizing various segments of the Ca2+ATPase promoter fused to the reporter gene chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) indicate a minimal thyroid hormone response element (TRE) between nucleotides -262 and -322, while sequences between -322 and -559 are required for maximal trans-activation. RA is not able to regulate these constructs. Likewise, a clear effect of T3 but no effect of RA was observed when the CAT gene was driven by a TRE derived from the rat alpha-MHC gene. In contrast, CAT expression was induced by either hormone when placed under the control of a synthetic palindromic TRE. Taken together, these results indicate that T3 and RA induce gene expression in primary cardiac myocytes, but through distinct response elements and/or mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1971844671,"We present evidence that the genes encoding U3 snRNA in plants are transcribed by RNA polymerase III (pol III) and not by RNA polymerase II (pol II) as in vertebrates or lower eukaryotes. The U3 gene is the only known example of a gene transcribed by different polymerases in different organisms. It is possible to convert the plant U3 gene into a functional pol II-transcribed gene by manipulating the spacing between the promoter elements and inserting a pol II-specific termination signal. Pol II-transcribed U3 RNA, containing the 5'-terminal cap different from that present in the wild-type counterpart, is packaged in transfected protoplasts into U3 snRNP precipitable with anti-fibrillarin antibodies. These findings provide further evidence for the common ancestry of the pol II and pol III transcription systems, and indicate that promoter diversification in some genes has occurred relatively recently."
https://openalex.org/W1557890613,"The glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors that attach certain proteins to membranes are preassembled by sequential addition of glycan components to phosphatidylinositol (PI) before being transferred to nascent polypeptide. A cell-free system consisting of trypanosome membranes has been reported to catalyze GPI biosynthesis (Masterson, W. J., Doering, T. L., Hart, G. W., and Englund, P. T. (1989) Cell 56, 793-800; Menon, A. K., Schwarz, R. T., Mayor, S., and Cross, G. A. M. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 9033-9042). We now describe conditions for studying the initial steps of GPI biosynthesis in extracts of murine lymphoma cells. Two chloroform-soluble products, tentatively identified as [6-3H]GlcNAc-PI and [6-3H]GlcN-PI were generated during incubations of EL4 cell lysates with UDP-[6-3H]GlcNAc. The involvement of PI in the reaction was established by the sensitivity of the products to hydrolysis by PI-specific phospholipase C and the finding that the addition of exogenous PI to the incubation stimulated the reaction. The minor, more polar product was sensitive to nitrous acid cleavage and was converted to the major product, as judged by TLC, after treatment with acetic anhydride. The glycolipids generated in lymphoma extracts appeared to be the same as the products produced in parallel incubations with trypanosome membranes. Analysis of available lymphoma mutants deficient in Thy-1 surface expression revealed that extracts of the class A, C, and H mutants are completely defective in synthesizing GlcNAc-PI and GlcN-PI."
https://openalex.org/W1599634353,"Purified Ca(2+)-stimulated, Mg(2+)-dependent ATPase (Ca(2+)-ATPase) from human erythrocytes was phosphorylated with a stoichiometry of about 1 mol of phosphate/mol of ATPase at both threonine and serine residues by purified rat brain type III protein kinase C. In the presence of calmodulin, the phosphorylation was markedly reduced. Labeled phosphate from [gamma-32P]ATP was retained on an 86-kDa calmodulin-binding tryptic fragment of Ca(2+)-ATPase but not on 82- and 77-kDa non-calmodulin-binding fragments. Similarly, fragmentation of the phosphorylated Ca(2+)-ATPase by calpain I revealed that calmodulin-binding fragments (127 and 125 kDa) retained phosphate label whereas a non-calmodulin-binding fragment (124 kDa) did not. The calmodulin-binding domain, located about 12 kDa from the carboxyl terminus of the Ca(2+)-ATPase, was thus located as a site of protein kinase C phosphorylation. A synthetic peptide corresponding to a segment of the calmodulin-binding domain (H2 N-R-G-L-N-R-I-Q-T-Q-I-K-V-V-N-COOH) was indeed phosphorylated at the single threonine residue within this sequence. The additional serine phosphorylation site was carboxyl terminal to the calmodulin domain. Phosphorylation by purified type III protein kinase C (canine heart) antagonized the calmodulin activation of the Ca(2+)-ATPase, particularly at lower Ca2+ concentrations (0.2-1.0 microM). By contrast, a purified but unresolved protein kinase C isoenzyme mixture from rat brain stimulated the activity of Ca(2+)-ATPase prepared in asolectin, but not glycerol, by more than 2-fold in the presence of the ionophore A23187, without increasing its Ca2+ sensitivity. The results clearly indicate that human erythrocyte Ca(2+)-ATPase is a substrate of protein kinase C, but the effect of phosphorylation on the activity of the enzyme depends on the isoenzyme form of protein kinase C used and on the lipid associated with the Ca(2+)-ATPase."

https://openalex.org/W1584234581,"The regulation by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) of its own promoter has been investigated by transient transfection and nuclear protein binding assays. In human K652 erythroleukemia cells TNF produced an 8-10-fold activation of the human TNF promoter linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene. The TNF-responsive element was localized to the -125 to -82 region by examining the TNF activation in 5'-deletion or site-directed mutants of the TNF promoter and by demonstrating that the -125 to -82 fragment confers TNF responsiveness to the thymidine kinase promoter. This region contains a palindrome, 5' TGAGCTCA 3', that resembles the consensus binding sequences for the transcription factors, activator protein-1 (AP-1), cyclic AMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB), and activation transcription factor (ATF). An internal deletion in the palindrome abolished the TNF responsiveness, whereas known AP-1 and CREB/ATF elements were unresponsive to TNF. In band shift analyses a nuclear factor from U937 cells specifically bound to the -125 to -82 TNF-responsive fragment in or near the palindromic sequence. Oligonucleotides containing AP-1 or CREB/ATF sites did not effectively compete for the binding, indicating that the U937 cell factor is different from these factors. Anti-c-fos antiserum did not affect binding of the U937 cell factor, whereas anti-c-jun antiserum did block its binding, indicating that either c-jun or a protein antigenically related to c-jun is a component of the factor. These results suggest that the TNF-responsive element is not activated by AP-1 or CREB in U937 cells and that a novel DNA binding factor is important for constitutive and inducible TNF gene expression."

https://openalex.org/W1509970463,"The two isoforms of ribulose 1,2-bisphosphate carboxylase activase (Rbu-P2 carboxylase) from spinach (Spinacea oleracea L.) were individually purified from Escherichia coli transformed with expression vectors for the appropriate cDNAs. Both isoforms catalyzed activation of Rbu-P2 carboxylase (ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, EC 4.1.1.39) and ATP hydrolysis. The kinetics of the two isoforms with respect to ATP concentration were different, in that the 45-kDa polypeptide exhibited a sigmoidal response while a rectangular response was observed with the 41-kDa isoform. These observations suggest that the additional domain at the C terminus of the 45-kDa isoform modulates the ATP regulation of activity. Lysine 169, at the putative ATP-binding site of the 41-kDa form of Rbu-P2 carboxylase activase, was changed to arginine, isoleucine, and threonine by directed mutagenesis. These mutations abolished Rbu-P2 carboxylase activase and ATPase activities, as well as the capability of the protein to bind ATP. These results confirm that lysine 169 is an essential residue."
https://openalex.org/W1590365700,"The mechanism responsible for the increase in cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) during mitogenic stimulation of lymphocytes has been widely investigated. By contrast, little is known about the processes underlying Ca2+i homeostasis in resting (unstimulated) cells. It has been suggested that [Ca2+]i is an important determinant of the rate of Ca2+ influx following mitogenic activation. Using rat thymic lymphocytes, we investigated whether the resting influx pathway is similarly controlled by [Ca2+]i. Otherwise untreated cells were Ca(2+)-depleted by loading with Ca2+ chelators while suspended in Ca(2+)-free solution. Ca2+ depletion induced an 8-fold increase in the rate of unidirectional Ca2+ uptake. The depletion-activated flux was voltage-sensitive and was blocked by La3+ and by compound SK&F 96365, a receptor-operated Ca2+ channel blocker. Upon reintroduction to Ca(2+)-containing solution, the increased influx brought about a rapid recovery of [Ca2+]i. Detailed analysis of the magnitude of the 45Ca2+ flux during this recovery indicated that [Ca2+]i is not the primary determinant of the plasmalemmal Ca2+ permeability. Instead, depletion of an internal thapsigargin-sensitive store correlates with and appears to be responsible for the increased permeability of the plasma membrane. Accordingly, the Ca2+ fluxes induced by intracellular Ca2+ depletion and by thapsigargin were pharmacologically indistinguishable. Mitogenic lectins also released Ca2+ from a thapsigargin-sensitive store and activated a plasmalemmal Ca2+ permeability displaying identical pharmacology. The data support the existence of a coupling process whereby the degree of filling of an internal Ca2+ store dictates the Ca2+ permeability of the plasma membrane. This coupling mechanism is important not only in mediating the effects of mitogens and other agonists, as suggested before, but seemingly also in the control of resting Ca2+i homeostasis in unstimulated cells."
https://openalex.org/W1512108330,"DNase I protection and gel retardation assays have identified a sequence 5' to the transcription start site of the rat opsin gene that interacts with nuclear proteins from mammalian retinas but not from a variety of other neural and non-neural tissues. Following sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transfer to nitrocellulose the protein(s) responsible for this binding were identified with an oligonucleotide probe and were found to migrate with an apparent molecular size of 40 kilodaltons. The binding complex eluted from fast protein liquid chromatography gel filtration as a peak centered at 100 kilodaltons, suggesting the presence of more than one subunit. Binding activity could be detected in postnatal day 1 retinal extracts and increased over the next 2 weeks of development, a time course coincident with opsin gene expression and maturation of rod photoreceptors. Synthetic oligonucleotides with altered sequences showed that the binding was dependent upon residues in a CTAAT motif and was facilitated by surrounding GGCCCC sequences. The specificity of the binding interaction was measured by inhibition of complex formation in a gel retardation assay. The unaltered sequence was over 2 orders of magnitude more effective at inhibiting complex formation than either an unrelated DNA sequence or a concensus sequence corresponding to a known CCAAT box binding protein NF1."
https://openalex.org/W1557236506,"Peptides C28R2 and C28R1A, representing the two main alternative classes of calmodulin-binding domains from the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump, were tested for their calmodulin-binding properties and for their capacity to interact with pump from which the calmodulin-binding domain had been removed by chymotryptic proteolysis. Peptide C28R2 was more effective in both capacities. Binding of peptide to calmodulin was measured by competition experiments. Such experiments indicated that Ki for C28R2 as an inhibitor of the pump-calmodulin interaction was 0.1 nM, whereas C28R1A had a Ki of 1 nM. Interaction of peptide with chymotryptically activated Ca2+ pump was measured by observing the inhibition by peptide of active Ca2+ transport into inside-out membrane vesicles at low Ca2+. Those experiments showed that C28R2 interacted relatively strongly (an IC50 of 1 microM), whereas C28R1A had an IC50 of 15 microM. The calmodulin-binding peptides had effects on both the K1/2 for Ca2+ and the Vmax of the proteolyzed pump. The effects on the K1/2 for Ca2+ were related to the net plus charge on the peptide, with the most positive peptides being most effective in competing with Ca2+. The substantial differences between C28R2 and C28R1A suggest that Ca2+ pumps containing calmodulin-binding domains like C28R1A have lower calmodulin affinities and higher activities in the absence of activator."
https://openalex.org/W1492636455,"Synthetic peptide analogs mimicking a repeated motif within the Staphylococcus aureus fibronectin receptor inhibit binding of the bacteria to fibronectin (Signas, C., Raucci, G., Jonsson, K., Lindgren, P. E., Anantharamaiah, G. M., Hook, M., and Lindberg, M. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 86, 699-703). In this study, we have further localized the fibronectin-binding determinant within the 37 amino acid D3 peptide. Chemical modification of the carboxyl side chains of the glutamic and aspartic residues in D3 abolished fibronectin-binding activity, whereas modifications of lysine or tyrosine residues had little effect. An active peptide encompassing residues 15-36 was isolated from a trypsin digest of D3, and a synthetic peptide S16-36 had activity comparable with that of intact D3. Scrambling the amino acid sequence of S16-36 or replacing the aspartic and glutamic residues with asparagine and glutamine resulted in loss of activity. Therefore, one or more of the acidic residues are essential for activity. However, additional sequence is required. Reduction in the size of S16-36 from either the N- or C-terminal end resulted in peptides with greatly diminished activity. These data suggest that the amino acids essential for binding fibronectin are contained within residues 21-33 of the D3 peptide and that the flanking N- and C-terminal amino acids are necessary for the peptide to acquire a conformation that is favorable for fibronectin binding."

https://openalex.org/W1571818311,"Neuromodulin (P-57, GAP-43, B-50, F-1) is a neurospecific calmodulin-binding protein believed to play a role in regulation of neurite outgrowth and neuroplasticity. Neuromodulin is phosphorylated by protein kinase C, and this phosphorylation prevents calmodulin from binding to neuromodulin (Alexander, K. A., Cimler, B. M., Meier, K. E. & Storm, D. R. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 6108-6113). The only other protein kinase known to phosphorylate neuromodulin is casein kinase II (Pisano, M. R., Hegazy, M. G., Reimann, E. M. & Dokas, L. A. (1988) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 155, 1207-1212). Phosphoamino acid analyses revealed that casein kinase II modified serine and threonine residues in both native bovine and recombinant mouse neuromodulin. Two serines located in the C-terminal end of neuromodulin, Ser-192 and Ser-193, were identified as the major casein kinase II phosphorylation sites. Thr-88, Thr-89, or Thr-95 were identified as minor casein kinase II phosphorylation sites. Phosphorylation by casein kinase II did not affect the ability of neuromodulin to bind to calmodulin-Sepharose. However, calmodulin did inhibit the phosphorylation of neuromodulin by casein kinase II with a Ki of 1-2 microM. Calmodulin inhibition of casein kinase II phosphorylation was due to calmodulin binding to neuromodulin rather than to the protein kinase. These data suggest that the minimal secondary and tertiary structure exhibited by neuromodulin may be sufficient to juxtapose its calmodulin-binding domain, located at the N-terminal end, with the neuromodulin casein kinase II phosphorylation sites at the C-terminal end of the protein. We propose that calmodulin regulates casein kinase II phosphorylation of neuromodulin by binding to neuromodulin and sterically hindering the interaction of casein kinase II with its phosphorylation sites on neuromodulin."
https://openalex.org/W1874661287,"Mitochondrial F1-ATPase is an oligomeric enzyme composed of five distinct subunit polypeptides. The alpha and beta subunits make up the bulk of protein mass of F1. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae both subunits are synthesized as precursors with amino-terminal targeting signals that are removed upon translocation of the proteins to the matrix compartment. Recently, two different complementation groups (G13, G57), consisting of yeast nuclear mutants with defective F1, have been described. Biochemical analyses indicate that the mutational block in both groups of mutants affects a critical step needed for the assembly of the alpha and beta subunits into the F1 oligomer after their transport into mitochondria. In this study the ATP12 gene representative of the nuclear respiratory-deficient mutant of S. cerevisiae (pet) complementation group G57 has been cloned and the encoded product partially characterized. The ATP12 reading frame is 975 base pairs long and codes for a protein of Mr = 36,587. The ATP12 protein is not homologous to the subunits of F1 whose sequences are known, nor does it exhibit significant primary structure similarity to any known protein. In vitro import assays indicate that ATP12 protein is synthesized as a precursor approximately 3 kDa larger than the mature protein. The mitochondrial localization of the protein has been confirmed by Western blot analysis of mitochondrial proteins with an antibody against a hybrid protein expressed from a trpE-ATP12 fusion. Fractionation of mitochondria indicates further that the ATP12 protein is either a minor component of the matrix compartment or is weakly bound to the matrix side of the inner membrane. The molecular weight of the native protein, estimated from its sedimentation properties in sucrose gradients, is at least two times larger than the monomer. This suggests that the ATP12 protein is probably part of a larger complex."
https://openalex.org/W1526718730,"Using DNA synthesis technology we constructed two synthetic DNAs, designated syn-uPA-DNA and mut-uPA-DNA. Syn-uPA-DNA contains the complete coding sequence of human presecretion form of single-chain u-PA. Mut-uPA-DNA was derived from syn-uPA-DNA by deleting 18 base pairs coding for amino acids Arg179-Ser184. Each synthetic DNA was inserted into a bovine papilloma viral genome-based expression vector to obtain expression in mouse cells. The results indicate that both syn-uPA and mut-uPA proteins are secreted predominantly in single-chain form. The single-chain form of both enzymes can be completely converted to two-chain form by treatment with plasmin. Both enzymes are as active as natural urokinase (std-uPA) isolated from urine. Analysis of enzymatic activity indicates that under conditions where syn-uPA and std-uPA are completely inhibited by endothelial-type plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1), mut-uPA retains 90% activity. In identical experiments with placental-type PAI (PAI-2), mut-uPA retains 80% activity. Syn-uPA is capable of forming a approximately 100-kDa complex with PAI, whereas mut-uPA can not. PAI-treated mut-uPA has kinetic properties similar to untreated syn-uPA or std-uPA. Overall, the data indicate that amino acids Arg179-Ser184 function at least in part as a binding site for PAI. Resistance to PAI inhibition may increase the potency of mut-uPA as a thrombolytic agent."

They had no introns within the reading frames and coded for proteins of 373 and 386 amino acid residues, respectively, including putative transit sequences (50 and 60 amino acid residues, respectively). In contrast, the spinach gamma subunit gene had two introns within the reading frame. The mature sequences coded by the two genes of A. thaliana (atpC1, 323 residues; atpC2, 326 residues) were homologous with that of spinach (J. Miki, M. Maeda, Y. Mukohata, and M. Futai (1988) FEBS Lett. 232, 221-226): the homologies of gamma subunits coded by atpC1 and atpC2 were 72%, those of the subunits coded by atpC1 and spinach cDNA were 84%, and those of the proteins coded by atpC2 and spinach cDNA were 71%. Like the spinach subunit, the gamma subunits coded by the two genes had unique regulatory domains not found in mitochondrial or bacterial subunits. Poly(A)+ mRNAs corresponding to atpC1 (1.5 kilobases) and atpC2 (2.5 kilobases) were detected in illuminated plants, the amount of the former being at least 140 times that of the latter. The atpC1 mRNA was not found in dark-adapted plants. Nuclear protein(s) specifically bound to the upstream region of atpC1 was detected by gel shift assay and its binding was shown to be inhibited by the GT-1 element of the gene encoding the ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase small subunit, which is expressed under illumination (P. J. Green, S. A. Kay, and N. H. Chau (1987) EMBO J. 6, 2543-2549). Consistent with these findings, an increased amount of the gamma subunit was detected immunochemically in illuminated plants."
https://openalex.org/W1506615983,We have studied the expression of the gene 2 for the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+ pump (SERCA2) in BC3H1 cells. Myogenic differentiation not only activated the SERCA2 expression but it also induced an isoform switch. Undifferentiated myoblasts only expressed the SERCA2b isoform (non-muscle) whereas differentiated myocytes predominantly contained the SERCA2a isoform (cardiac/slow skeletal muscle). The isoform switch was documented by immunoblot analysis with isoform-specific antibodies. This observation was confirmed at the mRNA level by using antisense RNA probes specific for class 1 (SERCA2a) or class 2 (SERCA2b) messengers. The expression of the SERCA2a isoform after differentiation was accompanied by a decreased sensitivity of the Ca2+ uptake in permeabilized cells to the Ca2+ pump inhibitor thapsigargin.
https://openalex.org/W1534258830,"Incubation of Rhodospirillum rubrum chromatophores with 2 M LiCl in the presence of MgATP has been shown to remove their F1 beta subunit leaving inactive but fully reconstitutable beta-less chromatophores (Gromet-Elhanan, Z., and Khanashvili, D., (1986) Methods Enzymol, 126, 528-538). A similar treatment of thoroughly washed spinach thylakoids has now been shown to release the CF1 beta subunit (CF1 beta) together with a complex containing equal amounts of CF1 alpha and CF1 beta (CF1 (alpha beta]. The purified CF1 (alpha beta) complex can reconstitute an active membrane-bound hybrid F0F1-ATPase with beta-less R. rubrum chromatophores and also catalyzes a low but very reproducible soluble MgATPase. Purified CF1 beta shows none of these activities although it can bind as efficiently as CF1 (alpha beta) to the beta-less chromatophores. By subjecting the crude spinach 2 m LiCl extract to dissociating conditions an enriched CF1 beta preparation is released. It contains traces of CF1 alpha and CF1 delta, is able to reconstitute an active hybrid F0F1-ATPase but, as the pure CF1 beta shows no soluble ATPase activity. These results indicate that trace amounts of CF1 alpha are enough for endowing CF1 beta with a reconstitutive capacity, but for exhibition of a significant soluble ATPase activity equivalent amounts of CF1 alpha and beta are required. The CF 1 (alpha beta) complex isolated and purified in this report thus represents the minimal catalytic core of the CF1-ATPase."

https://openalex.org/W1517386623,"Limited proteolysis of gizzard myosin by alpha-chymotrypsin converted the heavy chain doublet pattern, seen by gel electrophoresis, to a single band. Light chain degradation was not observed and only minor cleavage occurred at other heavy chain sites. Using a polyclonal antibody raised against a unique sequence from the slower-migrating heavy chain (SM1) it was shown that this conversion was due to the loss of a peptide approximately 4000 daltons from the C terminus of SM1. The peptide was isolated and sequenced, and the cleavage site was identified between phenylalanine 1943 and alanine 1944. Addition of antibody before protease protected SM1 from cleavage. The following changes were observed (a) the Mg2(+)-dependence of actin-activated ATPase of digested phosphorylated myosin was altered and activity was relatively high at low Mg2+ levels, i.e. similar to phosphorylated heavy meromyosin; (b) the KCl dependence of Mg2(+)-ATPase of the digested myosin, particularly the phosphorylated form, showed an altered pattern consistent with the stabilization of the 6 S conformation; (c) the tendency for aggregation was increased by proteolysis of phosphorylated myosin. These results show that the C-terminal region of a gizzard myosin heavy chain can modify some of the properties of myosin. It is suggested that the observed modifications reflect an enhanced tendency of the digested myosin to aggregate."
https://openalex.org/W1518685164,"The beta subunit isolated from the chloroplast ATP synthase F1 (CF1) has a single dissociable nucleotide binding site, consistent with the proposed function of this subunit in nucleotide binding and catalysis. The beta subunit bound the nucleotide analogs trinitrophenyl-ATP (TNP-ATP) or trinitrophenyl-ADP (TNP-ADP) with nearly equal affinities (Kd = 1-2 microM) but did not bind trinitrophenyl-AMP. Both ATP and ADP effectively competed with TNP-ATP for binding. Other nucleoside triphosphates were also able to compete with TNP-ATP for binding to beta; their order of effectiveness (ATP greater than GTP, ITP greater than CTP) mimicked the normal substrate specificity of CF1. The single nucleotide binding site on the isolated beta subunit very closely resembles the low affinity catalytic site (site 3) of CF1 (Bruist, M.F., and Hammes, G. G. (1981) Biochemistry 20, 6298-6305), suggesting that tight nucleotide binding by other sites on the enzyme involves other CF1 subunits in addition to the beta subunit. The results are inconsistent with an earlier report (Frasch, W.D., Green, J., Caguial, J., and Mejia, A. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 5064-5069), which suggested more than one nucleotide binding site per beta subunit. Binding of nucleotides to the isolated beta subunit was eliminated by a brief heat treatment (40 degrees C for 10 min) of the protein. A small change in the circular dichroism spectrum of beta accompanied the heat treatment indicating that a localized (rather than global) change in the folding of beta, involving at least part of the nucleotide binding domain, had occurred. Also accompanying the loss of nucleotide binding was a loss of the reconstitutive capacity of the beta subunit. ATP protected against the effects of the heat treatment."
https://openalex.org/W1571672585,"In human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1)-infected cell cultures, cell-to-cell fusion and the formation of multinucleated giant cells (syncytia) are induced as a consequence of interactions between the viral envelope glycoprotein on infected cells and cell surface CD4 molecules on uninfected cells. Although activated CD4+ T cells rapidly form syncytia when cultured with HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein expressing (env+) cells, freshly isolated, unstimulated CD4+ T cells do so more slowly. In these studies, we sought to explore the role of T cell activation in rendering CD4+ T cells susceptible to HIV-1-mediated syncytia formation. Our results indicate that within 2 h of exposure to immunologic stimuli, CD4+ T cells acquire the ability to form syncytia with HIV-1 env+ cells. Both cholera toxin, an inhibitor of protein kinase C (PKC) through its effects on inositol triphosphate and diacylglycerol production, and 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine dihydrochloride, a noncompetitive inhibitor (with respect to ATP) of PKC, prevented unstimulated but not previously stimulated CD4+ T cells from forming syncytia with HIV-1 env+ cells. 1-Oleoyl-2-acetyl glycerol, an analog of the PKC activator, diacylglycerol, enhanced syncytia formation whereas ionomycin, a calcium ionophore, had no effect. These results suggest that activation of PKC is essential for previously unstimulated CD4+ T cells to become fusogenic."
https://openalex.org/W1490634864,"Human leukosialin (CD43) is a major sialoglycoprotein expressed on leukocytes and platelets. In order to investigate the transcriptional regulation of this gene, we have isolated a genomic DNA of 12 kilobases in size that includes the 5'-flanking sequence. Comparison of the genomic and cDNA sequences revealed that the leukosialin gene consists of two exons, and that its entire translation product is encoded in the second exon. The transcriptional start site was determined by primer extension analysis in human T-cell line Jurkat. No canonical TATA or CAAT boxes were found in the prospected upstream region, but a guanine-rich region was observed on the sense strand. To localize the transcriptional regulatory region of this gene, various regions of 5' sequences were fused to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene, and transient expression assays were conducted in Jurkat cells. We employed the polymerase chain reaction to generate a series of clones containing 5' sequences of the leukosialin gene using primer sequences based on the genomic sequence. This strategy enabled us to narrow the search for a transcriptional regulatory element. In addition, we introduced site-directed mutations in the regulatory region by polymerase chain reaction to define it in detail. These studies showed that the sequence from -53 to -40 base pairs 5' to the transcriptional start site is critically involved in leukosialin expression. This sequence, 5'GGGTGGGTGGAGCC3', represents a novel promoter sequence which has not been reported in the promoters for other molecules expressed in T-lymphocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1529907300,"The goal of this study was to determine the mechanisms involved in the transport of the organic cation, tetraethylammonium (TEA), across the apical membrane of OK cells. [14C]TEA accumulated in OK cell monolayers reaching equilibrium in 2 h. The uptake of [14C]TEA at equilibrium was dependent upon temperature and was inhibited by sodium azide and by various organic cations, including N1-methylnicotinamide (NMN), mepiperphenidol, and cimetidine but not by the organic anion, p-aminohippuric acid. The initial uptake of [14C]TEA was characterized by a saturable process. The mean +/- S.D. Km was 27.8 +/- 2.6 microM and the Vmax was 414 +/- 26.5 pmol/mg protein/min. Both an accelerated efflux and influx of [14C]TEA in the presence of a trans-gradient of unlabeled TEA and NMN was observed, whereas a deaccelerated influx and efflux was observed in the presence of a trans-gradient of mepiperphenidol. The mechanism of interaction between NMN and TEA was examined. NMN significantly increased the apparent Km (mean +/- S.D.) of TEA to 82.8 +/- 16.4 microM (p less than 0.001), whereas the Vmax (mean +/- S.D.) was only slightly affected (478 +/- 72 pmol/mg protein/min) suggesting a competitive inhibition. The stimulatory effect of trans-gradients of NMN on TEA transport was due to an increase in the Vmax of TEA suggesting that NMN trans-stimulates TEA transport by increasing the turnover rate of the exchanger. In the presence of an inwardly directed proton gradient, the efflux at 30 s of [14C]TEA from the OK cell monolayers was significantly accelerated (p less than 0.05). Studies with the pH-sensitive fluorescent probe, 2',7'-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein, suggested that TEA could drive the countertransport of protons. In apical membrane vesicles prepared from OK cells, the uptake of [3H]NMN exhibited an apparent overshoot phenomenon in the presence of an initial outwardly directed proton gradient. Protons competitively inhibited TEA uptake suggesting that the proton/organic cation and the organic cation/organic cation self exchange mechanism are the same mechanism. This is the first report describing both TEA self-exchange and proton/TEA exchange in the apical membrane of a continuous cell line. OK cells are an excellent model for the study of organic cation transport across the apical membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1542056763,"Abstract The first described alpha-subunit mutation of yeast mitochondrial F1 has been recently identified as a single Gln173----Leu substitution in a strongly conserved sequence (Falson, P., Maffey, L., Conrath, K., and Boutry, M. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 287-293). This mutation is shown here to greatly modify the biphasic pattern of ATPase activity as a function of pH: (i) the shoulder observed at acidic pH is significantly increased; (ii) the main peak, at alkaline pH, is markedly lowered; (iii) the optimal pH is shifted from 8.8 to 7.7. The mutation lowers both apparent negative cooperativity and sensitivity to azide inhibition which concomitantly increase when the assay pH decreases. Azide partial inhibition produces apparent negative cooperativity which can be further abolished by bicarbonate. The mutation increases both activation energies determined from biphasic Arrhenius plots. The mutation decreases the inactivation rate by 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine and abolishes the protection by nucleotide binding at the adenine-specific regulatory site. On the contrary, it does not modify the reactivity of 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoylguanosine at the less-selective catalytic site. In addition, partial inactivation by 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine, as opposed to 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoylguanosine, produces apparent negative cooperativity under conditions where unmodified-enzyme kinetics are noncooperative. The results show that alpha-Gln173 participates in nucleotide interaction at a regulatory site which controls the negative cooperativity of F1-ATPase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1599739927,"The Ca(2+)-stimulated adenosine 5'-triphosphate-orthophosphate (ATP in equilibrium with 32Pi) exchange reaction was studied using a vesicular preparation derived from plasma membrane of kidney proximal tubules. With native inside-out vesicles, ATP in equilibrium with 32Pi was stimulated by micromolar Ca2+ concentrations. Treatment of the vesicles with the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 that abolished Ca2+ accumulation, strongly inhibited ATP in equilibrium with 32Pi. When Ca(2+)-ATPase was solubilized with the nonionic detergent octaethylene glycol mono n-dodecyl ether, maximal activation of ATP in equilibrium with 32Pi required millimolar Ca2+ concentrations. These Ca2+ concentrations inhibited ATP hydrolysis. ATP in equilibrium with 32Pi exhibited a Michaelian dependence on Pi and Mg2+, was stimulated by ATP, and depended on the ATP/ADP ratio. ATP in equilibrium with 32Pi was modified by the osmolytes urea, trimethylamine-N-oxide, and sucrose, which are representative of the methylamines and polyols that normally accumulate in renal tissue. These compounds did not modify the apparent affinity for Pi; they affected the response to ADP in the same fashion as the overall rate of ATP in equilibrium 32Pi, and their effects depended on medium pH. These data show that the Ca(2+)-ATPase from plasma membrane kidney proximal tubules can operate simultaneously in forward and backward directions. They also show that ATP in equilibrium with 32Pi is modulated by the ligands Ca2+, ATP, ADP, Pi, Mg2+, and H+, and by organic solutes found in renal tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1540006531,"The periplasmic glucans of Gram-negative bacteria, including the membrane-derived oligosaccharides (MDO) of Escherichia coli and the cyclic glucans of the Rhizobiaceae, are now recognized to be a family of closely related substances with important functions in osmotic adaptation and cell signaling. The synthesis of the beta-1,2-glucan backbone of MDO is catalyzed by a membrane-bound glucosyltransferase system previously shown to require UDP-glucose and (surprisingly) acyl carrier protein (Therisod, H., Weissborn, A. C., and Kennedy, E. P. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 83, 7236-7240). In the present study, no glucan intermediates bound to acyl carrier protein or to UDP could detected. The enzyme system, however, was found to be strongly inhibited by bacitracin and by amphomycin. Because the two antibiotics function by forming specific complexes with polyprenyl phosphates, their inhibitory effect suggests a prenol requirement for MDO biosynthesis. Furthermore, the activity of the glucosyltransferase was greatly stimulated by the addition of polyprenyl phosphates such as decaprenyl-P and dihydroheptaprenyl-P, but not by farnesyl-P. The same membrane preparations carry out the synthesis of polyprenyl-P-glucose, which is also stimulated by added polyprenyl-P, including farnesyl-P, the most active of those tested. Pulse chase experiments, however, indicate that the endogenous pool of polyprenyl-P-glucose cannot be an obligate intermediate in the MDO glucosyltransferase system."

https://openalex.org/W1483653071,"The change in reaction energetics of the bicarbonate-dependent ATPase reaction of Escherichia coli carbamoyl phosphate synthetase has been investigated for two site-directed mutations of the essential cysteine in the small subunit. Cysteine 269 has been proposed to facilitate the hydrolysis of glutamine by the formation of a glutamyl-thioester intermediate. The two mutant enzymes, C269S and C269G, along with the isolated large subunit, exhibit a 2-2.6-fold increase in the bicarbonate-dependent ATPase reaction relative to that observed for the wild type enzyme. In the presence of glutamine the overall enhancement is 3.7 and 9.0 for the C269G and C269S mutant enzymes, respectively. Carboxyphosphate is an intermediate in the bicarbonate-dependent ATPase reaction. The cause of the rate enhancements was investigated by measuring the positional isotope exchange rate in [gamma-18O4] ATP relative to the net rate of ATP hydrolysis. This ratio (Vex/Vchem) is a measure of the partitioning of the enzyme-carboxyphosphate-ADP complex. The partitioning ratio for the mutants is identical within experimental error to that observed for the wild type enzyme. This observation is consistent with the conclusion that the ground state for the enzyme-carboxyphosphate-ADP complex in the mutants is destabilized relative to the same complex in the wild type enzyme. If the increase in the absolute rate of ATP hydrolysis was due to a stabilization of the transition state for carboxyphosphate hydrolysis then the positional isotope exchange rate relative to the chemical hydrolysis rate would have been expected to decrease in the mutants."
https://openalex.org/W1628234532,"For F1-ATPases from mitochondria and chloroplasts, tight binding of Mg2+ and ADP without Pi at a catalytic site had been reported as a cause of enzyme inhibition. The time dependence of this inhibition and the effect of various agents on this process have been described (Du, Z., and Boyer, P. D. (1990) Biochemistry 29, 402-407, and references therein). Similar results are now reported for the ATPase from Halobacterium saccharovorum. The nonlinear hydrolysis kinetics were modulated by nitrate, azide, sulfite, GTP, ADP in the absence of ATP, or Pi in characteristic ways, in good analogy with the effects of these agents on F1 enzymes. The similarity to the F1 systems suggests that it is tight ADP binding that is affected. Although these reactions of the H. saccharovorum ATPase occurred on different time and concentration scales than those of F1-ATPases, the two systems do not appear to be fundamentally different. The hydrolytic mechanism of the H. saccharovorum ATPase thus identifies this enzyme as a member of the F0F1-ATPase family."
https://openalex.org/W1491421876,"In this work we report an unusual pattern of activation by calmodulin on the (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-ATPase from basolateral membranes of kidney proximal tubule cells. The activity of the ATPase depleted of calmodulin is characterized by a high Ca2+ affinity (Km = 2.2-3.4 microM) and a biphasic dependence on ATP concentration. The preparation responded to the addition of calmodulin by giving rise to a new Ca2+ site of very high affinity (Km less than 0.05 microM). Calmodulin antagonists had diverse effects on ATPase activity. Compound 48/80 inhibited calmodulin-stimulated activity by 70%, whereas calmidazolium did not modify this component. In the absence of calmodulin, 48/80 still acted as an antagonist, increasing the Km for Ca2+ to 5.7 microM and reducing enzyme turnover by competing with ATP at the low affinity regulatory site. Calmidazolium did not affect Ca2+ affinity, but it did displace ATP from the regulatory site. At fixed Ca2+ (30 microM) and ATP (5 mM) concentrations, Pi protected against 48/80 and potentiated inhibition by calmidazolium. At 25 microM ATP, Pi protected against calmidazolium inhibition. We propose that the effects of ATP and Pi arise because binding of the drugs to the ATPase occurs mainly on the E2 forms."
https://openalex.org/W1671378649,"The internal control elements of Neurospora crassa 5 S genes include an A box and a C box as in Xenopus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, plus a novel element, the Ribo box at position +18 to +34. The Ribo box is also found in the 40 S rRNA promoter and a ribosomal protein gene but is absent from tRNA genes in N. crassa. The 5 S A box diverges from the tRNA A box consensus at two positions. We tested whether replacement of the 5 S A box with a tRNALeu A box sequence would increase 5 S gene transcription in vitro or would remove the requirement for the Ribo box. The 5 S gene with the tRNALeu A box was transcribed poorly, and the Ribo box and the C box are still required for transcription. We tested the function of the Ribo box and 5 S A box in a tRNA-like transcription unit by constructing hybrids between a 5 S gene and a tRNALeu gene. In the tRNA-like context, the 5 S A box supported a lower level of transcription than the tRNA A box, and the Ribo box was not required at all. Therefore, in N. crassa, all of the 5 S internal control elements are gene-specific. In particular, the 5 S and tRNA A box sequences are not functionally interchangeable and may bind different transcription factors. Transcription of the hybrids was initiated at the 5 S initiation site, suggesting that the mechanism of initiation site selection is the same in the 5 S and tRNA genes. Competition experiments with the tRNA B box suggested that the N. crassa 5 S and tRNA genes require at least one common transcription factor such as TFIIIC."
https://openalex.org/W1507124967,"Tight contact of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate to the substrate phosphate is considered to be a crucial requirement of the phosphorolytic cleavage of polysaccharides by glycogen phosphorylases. This study demonstrates an essential role of lysine 533, the only charged residue in hydrogen bond distance to the phosphate of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate in Escherichia coli maltodextrin phosphorylase. Substitution of Lys533 by Ser reduced the turnover number 600-fold. Addition of monovalent cations significantly increased activity of the Lys533-Ser mutant up to a factor of 10, whereas the apparent affinity for Pi was decreased up to 80-fold. Although substitution of Lys533 by Gln caused a similar reduction of kcat, the Km values remained unchanged, and no response to small cations was observed. These results suggest a key role of the positive charge contributed by Lys533 in catalysis, most probably in maintaining the electrostatic neutrality of the pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and aligning the close phosphate-phosphate contacts indispensable for the proton transfer mechanism."

https://openalex.org/W1564056655,"Kinetic data have been collected suggesting that heterotropic activation by fructose 2,6-bisphosphate and AMP is a result not only of the relief of allosteric inhibition by ATP but is also the result of an increase in the affinity of phosphofructokinase for fructose 6-phosphate. Modification of the Ascaris suum phosphofructokinase at the ATP inhibitory site produces a form of the enzyme that no longer has hysteretic time courses or homotropic positive (fructose 6-phosphate) cooperativity or substrate inhibition (ATP) (Rao, G.S. J., Wariso, B.A., Cook, P.F., Hofer, H.W., and Harris, B.G. (1987a) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 14068-14073). This form of phosphofructokinase is Michaelis-Menten in its kinetic behavior but is still activated by fructose 2,6-bisphosphate and AMP and by phosphorylation using the catalytic subunit of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (cAPK). Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate activates by decreasing KF-6-P by about 15-fold and has an activation constant of 92 nM, while AMP decreases KF-6-P about 6-fold and has an activation constant of 93 microM. Double activation experiments suggest that fructose 2,6-bisphosphate and AMP are synergistic in their activation. The desensitized form of the enzyme is phosphorylated by cAPK and has an increased affinity for fructose 6-phosphate in the absence of MgATP. The increased affinity results in a change in the order of addition of reactants from that with MgATP adding first for the nonphosphorylated enzyme to addition of fructose 6-phosphate first for the phosphorylated enzyme. The phosphorylated form of the enzyme is also still activated by fructose 2,6-bisphosphate and AMP."
https://openalex.org/W1565143639,"Results of activity and spectral studies using fluorescence and circular dichroism show that AMP and fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (F-2,6-P2) activate Ascaris suum phosphofructokinase through specific and similar conformational changes. Inorganic compounds like (NH4)2SO4 and KH2PO4 also induce structural alterations in the enzyme in a manner different from those caused by AMP and F-2,6-P2. The enzyme is activated by both AMP and F-2,6-P2, in 20 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.6, with 0.2 mM ATP and 1 mM F-6-P. The Kact values for AMP and F-2,6-P2 are 25 +/- 3 microM and 1.5 +/- 0.2 microM, respectively. Both effectors quench enzyme tryptophan fluorescence in phosphate, pH 6.6, in a concentration-dependent manner. The Kd values determined from the decrease in emission intensity at 342 nm as a function of effector concentration are 24 +/- 3 microM for AMP and 1.00 +/- 0.15 microM for F-2,6-P2, in excellent agreement with the values of Kact. Both effectors also produce dramatic changes in the CD spectrum of the enzyme, in the region from 240 to 190 nm representing the peptide backbone. Secondary structure calculations suggest an increase in the alpha-helical content of the enzyme in the presence of either effector. The Kd values obtained from the concentration dependence of the decrease in ellipticity at 210 nm are 22.8 +/- 5.3 microM and 1.3 +/- 0.2 microM, respectively, for AMP and F-2,6-P2, once again in close agreement with the Kact values for these effectors. The data imply that activation of phosphofructokinase by these effectors is concomitant with structural changes in the enzyme. Further, comparison of the difference CD spectra for the effects of AMP and F-2,6-P2 show that both of them produce similar conformational changes and probably stabilize a similar final activated state of the enzyme. Other hexose phosphate analogues such as fructose 6-phosphate, glucose 1,6-bisphosphate, and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate do not affect the CD spectrum of the enzyme. Ammonium sulfate has no effect on the CD spectrum of the enzyme in phosphate buffer but does cause a significant alteration in the spectrum obtained in Mes. Gel filtration high performance liquid chromatography using a Borosil TSK 400 column shows that the tetrameric state of the native enzyme is not affected by the presence of the effectors."
https://openalex.org/W1543589297,"Antibody-induced antigenic modulation occurs after binding of antibodies to a variety of cell surface proteins. It is characterized by aggregation and subsequent loss of the molecules from the cell surface, usually by internalization. In this study we have investigated the effect of modulation of the T-cell antigen receptor complex (TCR) and the transferrin receptor (TFR) on the distribution of cholera toxin (CTx)- and pertussis toxin (PTx)-sensitive GTP binding proteins in human T-lymphocytes. Modulation of both the TCR and the TFR induced a selective shift of PTx-sensitive G-proteins from the plasma membrane to a high density membrane fraction enriched for lysosomal membranes. The distribution of CTx-sensitive G-proteins was unaffected. This shift was found in both the T-cell leukemia line Jurkat and in normal T-cells. The loss of PTx-sensitive G-proteins from the plasma membrane required approximately 15 h to be complete and was not inhibited by cycloheximide. It had no influence on T-cell triggering via anti-T-cell receptor antibodies and is unrelated to the inactivating effect of TCR-modulation on T-cell signalling. The loss of PTx-sensitive G-proteins was not accompanied by greater sensitivity to stimuli raising cAMP concentration. These results show that PTx-sensitive G-proteins can be selectively depleted from the plasma membrane by antibody treatment of T-cells."
