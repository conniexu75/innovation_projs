https://openalex.org/W4308444625,"We report on the first detection of linearly polarized x-ray emission from an ultra-magnetized neutron star with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE). The IXPE 35 observations of the anomalous x-ray pulsar 4U 0142+61 reveal a linear polarization degree of $(12\pm 1)\%$ throughout the IXPE 2--8 keV band. We detect a substantial variation of the polarization with energy: the degree is $(14\pm 1)\%$ at 2--4 keV and $(41\pm 7)\%$ at 5.5--8 keV, while it drops below the instrumental sensitivity around 4--5 keV, where the polarization angle swings by $\sim 90^\circ$. The IXPE observations give us completely new information about the properties of the neutron star surface and magnetosphere and lend further support to the presence of the quantum mechanical effect of vacuum birefringence."

Recently, it has been shown that they also reliably reveal stereoanomalies, and, thus, might have clinical applications. Their translation from research to clinical setting has however been hindered by their small size, which makes them difficult to record, and by a lack of data about their properties in sizable populations. Notably, they have so far only been recorded in adults. We recorded ocular following responses (OFRs)–defined as the change in eye position in the 80–160 ms time window following the motion onset of a large textured stimulus–in 14 school-age children (6 to 13 years old, 9 males and 5 females), under recording conditions that closely mimic a clinical setting. The OFRs were acquired non-invasively by a custom developed high-resolution video-oculography system, described in this study. With the developed system we were able to non-invasively detect OFRs in all children in short recording sessions. Across subjects, we observed a large variability in the magnitude of the movements (by a factor of 4); OFR magnitude was however not correlated with age. A power analysis indicates that even considerably smaller movements could be detected. We conclude that the ocular following system is well developed by age six, and OFRs can be recorded non-invasively in young children in a clinical setting."
https://openalex.org/W4308883560,"The earliest vascular plants had stems with a central cylindrical strand of water-conducting xylem, which rapidly diversified into more complex shapes. This diversification is understood to coincide with increases in plant body size and branching; however, no selection pressure favoring xylem strand-shape complexity is known. We show that incremental changes in xylem network organization that diverge from the cylindrical ancestral form lead to progressively greater drought resistance by reducing the risk of hydraulic failure. As xylem strand complexity increases, independent pathways for embolism spread become fewer and increasingly concentrated in more centrally located conduits, thus limiting the systemic spread of embolism during drought. Selection by drought may thus explain observed trajectories of xylem strand evolution in the fossil record and the diversity of extant forms."

We included 60 Chinese pSS patients and 50 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. DNA was extracted from stool samples and subjected to 16S ribosomal RNA gene analysis (V3-V4) for intestinal dysbiosis. In addition, patients were examined for laboratory and serological pSS features. A Spearman's correlation analysis was performed to assess correlations between individual bacteria taxa and clinical characteristics. The alpha-diversity (Chao1 and Shannon Index) and beta-diversity (unweighted UniFrac distances) of the gut microbiota differed significantly between pSS patients and healthy controls. Further analysis showed that several gut opportunistic pathogens (Bacteroides, Megamonas, and Veillonella) were significantly more abundant in pSS patients and positively correlated with their clinical indicators. In contrast, some probiotic genera (Collinsella, unidentified_Ruminococcaceae, Romboutsia, and Dorea) were significantly decreased in pSS patients and negatively correlated with their clinical indicators. Therefore, pSS patients in Northern China showed a dysbiotic intestinal microbiome enriched for potentially pathogenic genera that might be associated with autoimmune disease."
https://openalex.org/W4308705709,"China has been exploring a sustainable development path that harmonizes economic growth and environmental protection, targeting to build a beautiful China. The role of green finance in adjusting the misallocation of financial resources and leading the green sustainable development of the real economy is receiving increasingly more attention. Currently, green credit accounts for more than 90% of the total green finance funding in China and constitutes the most significant component of the green finance matrix. Whether green credit effectively promotes the green and sustainable development of the regional economy largely determines the success of China's economic green transformation.Existing studies of green credit mainly focus on its influences on financing, investment, and emission reduction of environmental pollution industries or companies. Extending the literature by exploring whether green credit is effective in promoting green sustainable development and what impact green credit exerts on the upstream (energy inputs), midstream (technological innovation), and downstream (pollution outputs) stages of the green sustainable development value chain, is the leading research objective of this paper.This paper discusses the impact of green credit on green sustainable development based on city panel data from 2012 to 2019. The level of green sustainable development is calculated by the GML index based on SBM directional distance function. The city-level green credit scale is calculated from the green credit issued by banks, weighted by the density of bank branches in a city. Synthetic control methods are employed in the robustness analysis to reduce the impact of endogeneity issues.The results of this paper indicate that green credit can promote green sustainable development and the impact gradually strengthens over time as the incremental implementations of complementary policies with substantial constraints and incentives, through which pollution control and economic growth achieve a ""win-win"" situation. Furthermore, the results indicate that green credit reduces the overall amount of energy inputs while optimizing the energy input structure. However, green credit does not boost the green technological level and even crowds out high technical value green innovations. Besides, the pollution reduction effects of green credit are associated with the strength of green credit constraints and the importance of pollution industries in the local economy, which means green credit performs better pollution reduction effects in regions with relatively strong green credit binding effects or in regions where pollution industries are not local economic pillars. The empirical results are further validated through robustness tests, including changing scope and measurement variables and applying the synthetic control method.Although this paper provides valuable contributions to the research area of green credit and green sustainable development, specific limitations exist in the current study. Firstly, as the official information disclosure of green credit in China is not sufficient, existing studies, including ours, could only use estimation methods through different perspectives to measure green credit, which is overall logical and reasonable but may lose some accuracy. Secondly, since there might be a certain degree of lag in the effect of green credit on the economy, the dynamic impact and long-term effects of green credit deserve further study. Thirdly, considering the characteristics of the Chinese administrative systems, introducing the behavior of local governments and local officials into the analysis of green credit and green sustainable development could be valuable."

Radiation-use efficiency (RUE) is an index used to quantify the relationship between solar radiation and biomass, and crop yield can be increased by increasing RUE. The main goals of this study were to initially investigate the effects of plant densities on the aboveground dry matter of corn, and subsequently examine the effects of plant densities on RUE and leaf area index (LAI), and the effects of LAI on RUE. Finally, we provide a comparative assessment of the approaches used to determine RUE. Analyses were conducted using growth and meteorological data obtained for two field corn varieties (TNG1 and TNG7) grown under four different plant density conditions in central Taiwan in 2017. The RUE values obtained in this study were primarily estimated from the slope of the linear relationship between aboveground dry matter measured at periodic harvests and the corresponding cumulative intercepted photosynthetically active radiation up to the time of harvest. TNG1 and TNG7 with a row spacing of 37.5 cm × 20 cm had the largest amounts of aboveground dry matter and highest RUE values of 4.41 and 4.55 g MJ -1 , respectively. We established that the higher the plant density, the higher were the values obtained for RUE and LAI. We also compared the different methods of estimating RUE and make recommendations in this regard. Our findings in this study will enable farmers to gain information on the dynamics of crop yield variation at an early stage of growth, and also provide reference values that can be incorporated in future crop yield models."
https://openalex.org/W4308700353,"Although the pathophysiological mechanism of hypertension is not fully elucidated yet, a large number of pieces of evidence have shown that genetic alterations in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system play a central role. However, the association of insertion/deletion polymorphism of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene with essential hypertension is controversial yet, and there is a limited number of publications among the Ethiopian population. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the association of ACE gene I/D polymorphism with the risk of hypertension among essential hypertension patients at the University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, Gondar, Ethiopia.A case-control study was conducted from October 07, 2020, to June 02, 2021, among hypertensive patients and normotensive control groups at the University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized Hospital. A structured questionnaire was used to collect socio-demographic data and anthropometric measurements. Five milliliters of blood were drawn from each of the randomly selected 64 hypertensive and 64 normotensive participants for molecular test analysis. Genetic polymorphism of the ACE gene was identified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and electrophoresis. Data analysis was done using SPSS version 25.0 software. The strength of association between the genotype and hypertension was estimated through the calculation of adjusted odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals using logistic regression. P-value &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.The distribution of DD genotypes and D allele of the ACE gene were 48.4% and 63% in essential hypertensive patients, respectively, while it were 29.7% and 42.2% in control subjects respectively. The ACE DD genotype (p-value = 0.005) and D allele (p-value = 0.001) were more frequent among hypertensive patients as compared to controls.The present study found that the DD genotype and D allele of the ACE gene has had a strong association with a high risk of hypertension in the study population."
https://openalex.org/W4308700473,"Introduction Since the late COVID-19, many countries have faced various surges and peaks within the number of infected. Iran was one of the countries that faced many surges and peaks within these years and faced many inadequacies and shortages of resources and hospital beds. Hence the healthcare system started using in-hospital medication such as Remdesivir in outpatients to reduce the load of patients admitted to the hospital. This study aimed to evaluate and compare the reported signs, symptoms, and outcomes of COVID-infected hospitalized and out-patients receiving Remdesivir. Methods In this retrospective cohort study, 214 patients (121 outpatient and 93 hospitalized) with moderate levels of Covid infection between October 2021 and February 2022 were studied. Both groups were treated with 200mg of Remdesivir, followed by 100 mg daily intravenous injections for five days; signs and symptoms, such as pain, shortness of breath, cough, fever and etc., of patients at the initiation and the end of treatment were recorded. Moreover, the patients’ blood oxygen saturation was assessed two to three times a day, and the mean of the recorded measures was considered as the daily oxygen saturation. The outpatient group had to visit the hospital daily for treatment and assessment. At the treatment’s end, mortality rates, disease signs, and symptoms alleviations were compared between the groups. Results The outpatient and hospitalized group’s mean age was 40.30 ± 12.25 and 37.70 ± 12.00 years, and 51.2% and 55.9% were males, respectively. There was no statistical difference between baseline and clinical characteristics in the outpatients and hospitalized groups. After adjusting for oxygen saturation at baseline and gender in the multivariable Cox regression analysis, the risk of death did not statistically differ between the hospitalized and outpatient group (hazard ratio: 0.99, 95% confidence interval: 0.39–2.50)) at the end of the study. Conclusion Based on the results of this study, the outcome, signs, and symptoms of inpatient and outpatient Remdesivir treatment groups did not differ significantly. Hence in COVID-19 surges where we have limitations in admitting patients, outpatient Remdesivir treatment for those without any underlying diseases can be a proper management method."
https://openalex.org/W4308700714,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors, introduced in recent years, have revolutionized the treatment of many cancers. However, the toxicity associated with this therapy may cause severe adverse events. In the case of advanced lung cancer or metastatic melanoma, a significant number (10%) of patients treated with CTLA-4 inhibitor incur damage to the pituitary gland. In order to reduce the risk of hypophysitis and other severe adverse events, steroids may be combined with CTLA-4 inhibitor; they reduce toxicity, but they also diminish the anti-cancer effect of the immunotherapy. This trade-off between tumor reduction and the risk of severe adverse events poses the following question: What is the optimal time to initiate treatment with steroid. We address this question with a mathematical model from which we can also evaluate the comparative benefits of each schedule of steroid administration. In particular, we conclude that treatment with steroid should not begin too early, but also not very late, after immunotherapy began; more precisely, it should start as soon as tumor volume, under the effect of CTLA-4 inhibitor alone, begins to decrease. We can also compare the benefits of short term treatment of steroid at high doses to a longer term treatment with lower doses."
https://openalex.org/W4308701129,"Phytoremediation assisted with plant growth promoting bacteria (PGPB) is a green technology to remediate metal contaminated soils. Plants usually produce secondary metabolites to tolerate metal toxicity. Present study was designed to explore the phytoremediation potential of Vigna radiata var. NM-II in the presence of metal resistant PGPB and comparison of metabolites produced under heavy metal stresses (Pb, Ni, Cr). Three PGPB selected for present study include Bacillus pumilus MB246, Serratia nematodiphila MB307 and Delftia Lacustris MB322. Pot experiments were conducted with inoculated V. radiata NM-II seeds grown in soil artificially contaminated with lead (Pb), Nickle (Ni) and chromium (Cr) at a concentration of 300, 200 and 100 mg/kg respectively. After harvesting various growth parameters were studied (root length, shoot length, fresh weight and dry weight). Bacterial colonization on root surfaces of harvested plants was observed through Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Elemental composition was recorded through Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) attached with SEM. Metabolic response of harvested plants was studied through Gas chromatography Mass spectrophotometry (GC-MS) analysis. Metal accumulation in roots, shoots and soil was analysed by acid digestion method from which Bioaccumulation factor (BF) and Translocation factor (TF) of metal from soil to plant was calculated. Results revealed stimulatory effect of PGPB on growth and phytoextraction ability of V. radiata. Soil metal removal efficiency was in the order Pb&gt;Ni&gt;Cr, whereas metal distribution in each part of plant was root&gt;stem&gt;leaf. The BF and TF values suggested V. radiata as Pb and Ni excluder while moderate accumulator for Cr. Elemental analysis through Energy Dispersive X- ray spectroscopy (EDX) found potassium (K+)and calcium (Ca+)as highly abundant nutrients with least accumulation of sulphur (S). Metabolites study through GC-MS revealed variety of compounds (carbohydrates, amino acids, fatty acids, steroids etc) detected differentially under each metal treatment and their concentration was influenced by different bacterial inoculations. Overall 9-Octadecenamide was found as commonly present lipid compound in most of the treatments which is required for detoxification in plants. The study concluded beneficial role of PGPB for successful phytoremediation of heavy metals and differential response of metabolites towards each metal stress that is related to metal tolerance ability of V. radiata."
https://openalex.org/W4308700398,"To assess the effect of COVID-19 vaccination on menstrual patterns and mental health of medical students and to explore the students' perspective regarding this effect.This mixed-method study was conducted on the medical and dental students of the private and public sector institutions of Peshawar from September 2021 to March 2022. A Menstrual symptom questionnaire (MSQ) and hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS) were used. This was followed by qualitative interviews with the students who faced problems in their menstruation after the COVID-19 vaccination.A total of 953 students were included, with a mean age of 20.67±1. 56 years. More than half (n = 512, 53.7%) experienced menstrual cycle abnormalities post-vaccination. The majority having disturbances in their menstrual cycle had significantly higher levels of anxiety (p = 0.000). Results on the menstrual symptom questionnaire, anxiety, and depression subtype of HADS showed a negative and statistically significant relationship with changes after COVID-19 vaccination (p&lt;0.05). In the qualitative interviews, 10 (58.8%) students each had problems with frequency and flow, followed by 7 (41.2%) students, who had dysmenorrhea. Seven (41.2%) consulted a gynecologist for management. The majority (n = 14, 82.4%) stated that these issues had an adverse impact on their mental health and almost half (n = 8, 47.1%) suggested consulting a gynecologist while facing such situations.This study showed the impact of the COVID-19 vaccine on women`s menstrual patterns and subsequent mental health status. Although the majority of the students experienced menstrual cycle abnormalities and subsequent mental health adversities post COVID-19 vaccination but these were temporary and self-limiting and were attributed to the psychological impact of the vaccination. Therefore, it is imperative to alert health care professionals about possible side effects and prior counseling is expected to play an important role in this context."
https://openalex.org/W4308700729,"Background Despite the history of United States of America (USA)-based partners implementing global health programs in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), future models for sustainable healthcare rely on local country ownership and leadership. Transition is the process of shifting programs towards country ownership, where local stakeholders plan, manage, and deliver health programs. Transition is not a singular event but a process which may include a phase where health programs are led and managed by local entities but still reliant on awards from international partners. This phase is scarcely described yet can impact long-term program sustainability if navigated poorly. This qualitative study examines the transition of Zimbabwe’s voluntary medical male circumcision and HIV care and treatment services from management by a USA-based organization, the International Training and Education Center for Health (I-TECH), to management under a new Zimbabwean organization, the Zimbabwe Technical Assistance, Training and Education Centre for Health (Zim-TTECH). The primary objective of this paper is to explore challenges, successes, and lessons learned during this transition to inform other non-governmental organizations. Methods We conducted sixteen virtual, key informant interviews using purposeful sampling, identifying potential participants based on their role in the transition team (leadership, administrative, financial, or human resources) and willingness to consent to the study. We aimed for equal representation from USA-based, I-TECH headquarters staff and Zimbabwe-based, Zim-TTECH staff involved in the transition team. Data were analyzed in Atlas.Ti using deductive and inductive methods, followed by a thematic analysis guided by several frameworks for program transition and organizational change. Results Findings suggest five themes to guide transition: 1) Develop a vision and empower leadership for change by delegating clear roles and supporting local ownership; 2) Plan and strategize for transition in a manner that accounts for historical context; 3) Communicate with and inform stakeholders to understand transition perceptions, understand barriers to transition, and enable open communications related to risks and benefits; 4) Engage and mobilize staff by constructing necessary infrastructure and providing technical assistance as needed; and 5) Define short-term and long-term success. Conclusion Transition processes were challenged by the local country context, compressed transition timelines, and all-or-nothing measures of transition success. Facilitators included strong staff capacity and a synergistic partnership model between Zim-TTECH and I-TECH. Global funders and international organizations should support local LMIC partners in their pathway to independence by removing restrictions on funding awards, including transitioning ownership mid-stream, and positioning leadership of international awards for in-country entities."
https://openalex.org/W4308700971,"Functional technological applications have become an integral part of our lives changing our patterns of reasoning and behavior. The current study examines whether, how and why use of WAZE app, a popular GPS-based navigation application, demonstrate behaviors and patterns which resemble those of technological dependency. We conducted semi-structured in-depth interviews with 50 WAZE users. The questions took inspiration from the model of IT addiction, which identifies six behavioral parameters: withdrawal, conflict, mood modification, relapse, tolerance, and saliency. The novelty of the study lies in the evidence of patterns and behaviors which resemble technological dependency on the WAZE app. The findings indicate that WAZE app satisfies users' needs driven by functionality. Four behavioral characteristics associated with IT addiction are applicable to WAZE users: mood modification, conflict, relapse, and withdrawal. The study concludes that functional technological applications may trigger behavioral indicators of technological addiction."

Their left hamstring muscles were assessed using static wide field of view ultrasound on two separate occasions. Static ultrasound images were acquired by a single sonographer using a 92mm linear transducer. The architectural characteristics (muscle length, fascicle length, pennation angle and muscle thickness) from two distinct locations of the bicep femoris long head and semimembranosus were evaluated. Muscle length and thickness of the bicep femoris short head and semitendinosus muscle were also evaluated. Intraclass correlation coefficient analyses were performed to determine the intra-rater reliability of the performed measurements.Both muscle (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.99; standard error of measurement = 4.3 to 6.6mm) and fascicle (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.92 to 0.98; standard error measurement = 1.1 to 2.4mm) length were measured with excellent intra-rater reliability. Muscle thickness was measured with excellent reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.9 to 0.96; standard error of measurement = 0.91mm to 1.4mm) for all hamstring muscles except for the proximal segments of the bicep femoris short head (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.85; standard error of measurement = 0.84mm) and semitendinosus (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.88; standard error of measurement = 0.82mm), which were measured with good reliability. Pennation angle was measured with good reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.77 to 0.87; standard error of measurement = 1 to 1.6°).The architectural characteristics of the hamstring muscles of male amateur athletes can be reliably quantified using static wide field of view ultrasound."
https://openalex.org/W4308701201,"Ginseng root rot caused by Fusarium oxysporum is serious disease that impacts ginseng production. In the present study, 145 strains of bacteria were isolated from the rhizosphere soil of healthy ginseng plants. Three strains with inhibitory activity against Fusarium oxysporum (accession number AF077393) were identified using the dual culture tests and designated as YN-42(L), YN-43(L), and YN-59(L). Morphological, physiological, biochemical, 16S rRNA gene sequencing and phylogenetic analyses were used to identify the strains as Bacillus subtilis [YN-42(L)] (accession number ON545980), Delftia acidovorans [YN-43(L)] (accession number ON545981), and Bacillus polymyxae [YN-59(L)] (accession number ON545982). All three isolates effectively inhibited the growth of Fusarium oxysporum in vitro and the antagonistic mechanism used by the three strains involved the secretion of multiple bioactive metabolites responsible for the hydrolysis of the fungal cell wall. All three biocontrol bacteria produce indoleacetic acid, which has a beneficial effect on plant growth. From our findings, all three antagonistic strains can be excellent candidates for ginseng root rot caused by the pathogenic fungus Fusarium oxysporum. These bacteria have laid the foundation for the biological control of ginseng root rot and for further research on the field control of ginseng pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W4308699805,"The hypothalamus is comprised of heterogenous cell populations and includes highly complex neural circuits that regulate the autonomic nerve system. Its dysfunction therefore results in severe endocrine disorders. Although recent experiments have been conducted for in vitro organogenesis of hypothalamic neurons from embryonic stem (ES) or induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, whether these stem cell-derived hypothalamic neurons can be useful for regenerative medicine remains unclear. We therefore performed orthotopic transplantation of mouse ES cell (mESC)-derived hypothalamic neurons into adult mouse brains. We generated electrophysiologically functional hypothalamic neurons from mESCs and transplanted them into the supraoptic nucleus of mice. Grafts extended their axons along hypothalamic nerve bundles in host brain, and some of them even projected into the posterior pituitary (PPit), which consists of distal axons of the magnocellular neurons located in hypothalamic supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei. The axonal projections to the PPit were not observed when the mESC-derived hypothalamic neurons were ectopically transplanted into the substantia nigra reticular part. These findings suggest that our stem cell-based orthotopic transplantation approach might contribute to the establishment of regenerative medicine for hypothalamic and pituitary disorders."

Four creams with different textures were randomly applied, and they were divided into two classes, “like (positive)” and “dislike (negative)”, according to the preference score given by the subject. We extracted frequency features using well-known frequency bands, i.e., alpha, beta and low and high gamma bands, and then we created a matrix including frequency and spatial information of the EEG data. We developed seven CNN-based models: (1) inception-like CNN with four-band merged input, (2) stacked CNN with four-band merged input, (3) stacked CNN with four-band parallel input, and stacked CNN with single-band input of (4) alpha, (5) beta, (6) low gamma, and (7) high gamma. The models were evaluated by the Leave-One-Subject-Out Cross-Validation method. In like/dislike two-class classification, the average accuracies of all subjects were 73.2%, 75.4%, 73.9%, 68.8%, 68.0%, 70.7%, and 69.7%, respectively. We found that the classification performance is higher when using multi-band features than when using single-band feature. This is the first study to apply a CNN-based deep learning method based on EEG data to evaluate preference for cosmetic creams."

The study sample was selected via simple random sampling. The link to the survey was sent to potential respondents via email, and the responses were analysed using SPSS version 26. Content validity, factor analysis, and known group validity were employed to construct and validate an instrument that will enable the identification of cosmetics safety. The instrument's reliability was evaluated using test-retest reliability, internal consistency, item internal consistency (IIC), and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs).The study sample included 978 participants. The content validity index for the final 24-item scale was 0.84. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin value was 0.959 with a statistically significant Bartlett's test of sphericity (p &lt;0.001). Factor analysis presented a three-component model. PCFA analysis found good fit values with 0.960 for the normed fit index, 0.977 for the comparative fit index, and 0.987 for the Tucker Lewis Index. All values were in excess of 0.95, and the root mean square error of approximation was below 0.06 (0.03); thus, the model had a good fit. Cronbach's alpha also showed good consistency of the overall instrument (0.963), and all factors had a Cronbach's alpha above 0.70. Each item on the instrument met the IIC correlation standard of ≥ 0.40, and there were good overall ICC statistics of 0.963 (0.959-0.966) for the instrument as a whole with statistical significance (p &lt; 0.001). The instrument's test-retest reliability was assessed by correlating the respondents' identification scores at two time points with a four-week gap revealing a correlation coefficient of 0.870 (p-value &lt;0.01). Participants holding a bachelor's degree were more likely to be able to identify safe and authentic cosmetics than those with a high-school educational level (p = 0.015).This study developed a novel validated instrument to determine the safety of cosmetics. The final questionnaire uses 24 items on three dimensions (13 items on hazard information, eight items on product identity, and three items on product handling and storage). The tool is concise and easy to complete, and it is suitable for use among the general population. The use of this instrument can promote greater collaboration between the consumer health regulatory authorities and inspection authorities thus increasing consumer satisfaction and public participation."
https://openalex.org/W4308700349,"Urban scaling analysis has shown that various aggregated urban quantities obey power-law relationships with the population size. Despite the rapid progress, direct empirical evidence that shows how the power-law exponents β depend on the spatial organization of the GDP has been lacking. Moreover, urban scaling studies are hardly reproduced in developing countries due to inadequate official statistics. We tackle these issues by performing urban scaling analysis on Indonesian cities using globally harmonized functional cities delineations and global-scale gridded Gross Domestic Product (GDP) datasets. First, we observe that the GDP and area of Indonesian cities scale linearly with the population size. For GDP in particular, the deviations from the scaling law follow a geographical pattern. Second, we determine the economic hotspots in each city and observe that the area of the hotspots scales mildly sublinear with the population size. Surprisingly, the GDP of hotspots also scales sublinearly with the population size, indicating a lack of increasing returns due to scaling. Third, by classifying the cities based on the spatial organization of the GDP in two dimensions (heterogeneity and spatial dispersion) and examining the scaling exponents of each class, we discover a non-trivial relation between scaling behavior and the spatial organization of the GDP. Spatial dispersion strongly affects the scaling behavior in heterogeneous cities, while such effect is weakened for homogeneous cities. Finally, we find that the scaling effect in terms of economies of scale (sublinearity of area) and increasing returns (superlinearity of GDP) is stronger for Indonesian cities with spatially compact GDP distribution."
https://openalex.org/W4308700597,"Caregiving stress is a risk factor for cardiometabolic disease. Therefore, integrating cardiometabolic biomarkers into caregiving research provides a more comprehensive assessment of an individual's health and response to an intervention. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of a yoga-based stress reduction intervention on stress, psychological outcomes, and cardiometabolic biomarkers in cancer caregivers. This prospective randomized controlled trial enrolled family caregivers of adult patients who underwent an allogeneic HSCT at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center. All subjects received usual care education. Participants in the intervention group received an Iyengar yoga intervention self-administered over six weeks using an audio recording file. The primary outcome was perceived stress (measured using the NIH toolbox Perceived Stress). The secondary outcomes were psychological factors (depression and anxiety measured using PROMIS® Depression and Anxiety), and cardiometabolic biomarkers measured by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. A total of 50 family caregivers (mean [SD] age, 44.9 [15.2] years; 42 [84.0%] women) were randomized, 25 to the intervention group and 25 to the control group. No group differences were noted in stress, depression, and anxiety. Significant interaction effects between group and time were found in large TRL-P (F(1,43) = 10.16, p = 0.003) and LP-IR (F(1,42) = 4.28, p = 0.045). Post-hoc analyses revealed that the levels of large TRL-P (mean difference = 1.68, CI = [0.86, 2.51], p&lt; .001) and LP-IR (mean difference = 5.67, CI = [1.15, 10.18], p = 0.015) significantly increased over time in the control group but while remained stable in the intervention group (mean difference = -0.15, CI = [-0.96, 0.66], p = 0.718; mean difference = -0.81, CI = [-5.22, 3.61], p = 0.714, respectively). Even when perceptions of psychological distress remain unchanged, incorporating gentle yoga poses and breathing exercises may reduce the risk of cardiometabolic disease in caregivers by inhibiting the development of insulin resistance. Standard lipids of cardiometabolic risk do not appear to be robust enough to detect short-term early changes of cardiometabolic risk in caregivers.

https://openalex.org/W4308700722,"With the increasing concerns about the health and economic burden attributed to sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) consumption, SSB taxation has been proposed and implemented in many countries. Many previous economic evaluations of SSB taxation have shown that this kind of policy is cost-effective. However, the magnitude of impact varies. This study aims to design a comprehensive model to estimate the impact and cost-effectiveness of the SSB tax in Canada.A proportional multi-state life table-based Markov model was chosen to estimate the impacts of SSB tax in Canada. The health-related quality of life (including disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)), the costs (including health care costs and intervention costs), and the tax revenue were the main health and economic outcomes. We compared the simulated SSB tax with the current practice from the public health care payer perspective, and the tax was applied to the 2015 adult Canadian population up to 100 years. The economic model was built following guidelines from the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health.After implementing a CAD$0.015/oz SSB tax, 282,104 cases of overweight and obesity, 210,542 cases of diseases, and 2,189 deaths could be prevented. The simulated SSB tax has the potential to avert 2.3 million DALYs, gain 1.5 million QALYs, and save CAD$32,583 million in health care costs in a lifetime period. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the SSB tax was CAD$ -24,933/QALY. The SSB tax with different tax levels (CAD$0.01/oz and CAD$0.02/oz) remained cost-effective.Implementing the SSB tax in Canada is a potential cost-effective policy option for reducing obesity and related chronic diseases. The model built in this study provides a more accurate estimate of health and economic impact of SSB tax and could be used to estimate other sugar tax options."
https://openalex.org/W4308700781,"We analyzed the complete chloroplast genomes of eight Orostachys species and compared the sequences to those of published chloroplast genomes of the congeneric and closely related genera, Meterostachys and Hylotelephium. The total chloroplast genome length of thirteen species, including the eight species analyzed in this study and the five species analyzed in previous studies, ranged from 149,860 (M. sikokianus) to 151,707 bp (H. verticillatum). The overall GC contents of the genomes were almost identical (37.6 to 37.8%). The thirteen chloroplast genomes each contained 113 unique genes comprising 79 protein-coding genes, 30 tRNA genes, and four rRNA genes. Among the annotated genes, sixteen genes contained one or two introns. Although the genome structures of all Orostachys and Hylotelephium species were identical, Meterostachys differed in structure due to a relatively large gene block (trnS-GCU-trnS-GGA) inversion. The nucleotide diversity among the subsect. Orostachys chloroplast genomes was extremely low in all regions, and among the subsect. Appendiculatae, genus Orostachys, and all thirteen chloroplast genomes showed high values of Pi (&gt;0.03) in one, five, or three regions. The phylogenetic analysis showed that Orostachys formed polyphyly, and subsect. Orostachys and Appendiculatae were clustered with Hylotelephium and Meterostachys, respectively, supporting the conclusion that each subsection should be considered as an independent genus. Furthermore, the data supported the taxonomic position of O. margaritifolia and O. iwarenge f. magnus, which were treated as synonyms for O. iwarenge in a previous study, as independent taxa. Our results suggested that O. ramosa and O. japonica f. polycephala were individual variations of O. malacophylla and O. japonica, respectively. The exact taxonomic position of O. latielliptica and the phylogenetic relationship among the three species, O. chongsunensis, O. malacophylla and O. ramosa, should be a topic of future study."
https://openalex.org/W4308700886,"Recently, pesticides have been suggested to be one of the factors responsible for the large-scale decline in honey bee populations, including colony collapse disorder. The identification of the genes that respond to pesticide exposure based on their expression is essential for understanding the xenobiotic detoxification metabolism in honey bees. For the accurate determination of target gene expression by quantitative real-time PCR, the expression stability of reference genes should be validated in honey bees exposed to various pesticides. Therefore, in this study, to select the optimal reference genes, we analyzed the amplification efficiencies of five candidate reference genes ( RPS5 , RPS18 , GAPDH , ARF1 , and RAD1a ) and their expression stability values using four programs (geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and RefFinder) across samples of five body parts (head, thorax, gut, fat body, and carcass) from honey bees exposed to seven pesticides (acetamiprid, imidacloprid, flupyradifurone, fenitrothion, carbaryl, amitraz, and bifenthrin). Among these five candidate genes, a combination of RAD1a and RPS18 was suggested for target gene normalization. Subsequently, expression levels of six genes ( AChE1 , CYP9Q1 , CYP9Q2 , CYP9Q3 , CAT , and SOD1 ) were normalized with a combination of RAD1a and RPS18 in the different body parts from honey bees exposed to pesticides. Among the six genes in the five body parts, the expression of SOD1 in the head, fat body, and carcass was significantly induced by six pesticides. In addition, among seven pesticides, flupyradifurone statistically induced expression levels of five genes in the fat body."
https://openalex.org/W4308700972,"Hydroxyurea (HU) is an evidence-based therapy that is currently the most effective drug for sickle cell disease (SCD). HU is widely used in high-income countries with consequent reduction of morbidity and mortality. In Nigeria, HU is prescribed by physicians while nurses are mainly involved in counseling the patients to ensure adherence. The extent of utilization and the determinant factors have not been sufficiently evaluated in Nigeria.To assess the frequency of use of HU and factors affecting utilization among healthcare providers, patients, and caregivers for SCD.A questionnaire was administered online and in- person to assess the frequency of HU use and the factors that promote and limit its use. The data were analyzed by descriptive statistics using IBM SPSS software version 23 and the result was presented in frequency tables and percentages.A total of 137 physicians, 137 nurses, and 237 patients/caregivers responded to the survey. The rate of prescription of HU by doctors in the past 6 months was 64 (46.7%), 43 (31.4%) nurses provided counseling and 36 (15.6%) patients were on HU. Among doctors, adequate knowledge (91.3%), clinical benefits and safety (94.8%), and inclusion of HU in management guidelines (86.9%) were motivators for prescribing it while inadequate knowledge (60.9%) and unawareness of treatment guidelines (68.6%) constituted barriers. Among nurses, reduction of crisis (91.6%) and safety (64.8%) were the major motivators while barriers were high cost (79.1%) and intensive monitoring (63.1%) of HU treatment. Among the patients, the major motivator was the reduction of crises (80.3%) while poor knowledge (93.2%), high cost of the drug (92.2%) while monitoring (91.2%), non-availability (87.7%) and side effects (83.9%) were the major barriers for the utilization of HU.HU prescription and utilization are still poor among healthcare providers and patients. Inadequate knowledge, non-availability and high cost of HU as well as unawareness of treatment guidelines constitute major barriers to prescription and utilization."
https://openalex.org/W4308701003,"Substance use is a steadily worsening crisis, yet there is limited evidence on the effectiveness of brief educational programs related to substance use disorders (SUD). To address this, the Just Five digital program launched in 2019 with six educational lessons about SUD, each five minutes long. Just Five is delivered through various organizations, including employers as part of workplace wellness, health plans that offer it to members, and to community-based organizations and populations they serve. This study evaluated the effectiveness of the program across 10 organizations in the initial launch. A cross-sectional survey was given to Just Five viewers to establish changes in perceived knowledge and attitudes toward SUD. Results were analyzed among the overall sample; a sub-analysis compared results within the three types of organizations taking part. Between December 2019 and September 2021, 2,749 baseline and 397 follow-up surveys were collected. Significant improvements were observed across almost all questions asked, with the largest improvements in respondent confidence to recognize signs of addiction (52.5% baseline; 87.7% follow-up); knowledge about ways to reduce the risk of addiction (54.1% baseline; 86.5% follow-up); and knowledge of how to help someone with addiction (38.7% baseline; 81.7% follow-up). All trends were replicated in sub-analyses. Substance use has severe societal impacts, and there is a need for effective programs that can be quickly implemented across various environments at large scale. Just Five is a potentially effective tool to increase perceived knowledge and improve attitudes toward SUD."
https://openalex.org/W4308701398,"Introduction We aimed to describe the profile of adult patients and analyze the predictors of death from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the state of Rio de Janeiro. Knowledge of the predictors of death by COVID-19 in Rio de Janeiro, a state with one of the highest mortality rates in Brazil, is essential to improve health care for these patients. Methods Data from the Information System for Epidemiological Surveillance of Influenza and the Mortality Information System were used. A binary logistic regression model evaluated the outcome of death, sociodemographic data, and clinical-epidemiological and health care covariates. Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate statistics were performed with the R program, version 4.0.0. Results Overall, 51,383 cases of SARS due to COVID-19 among adults were reported in the state between March 5 and December 2, 2020. Mortality was high (40.5%). The adjusted final model presented the following predictors of death in SARS patients due to COVID-19: male sex (odds ratio [OR] = 1.10, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04–1.17); age (OR = 5.35, 95%CI, 4.88–5.88; ≥75 years); oxygen saturation &lt;95% (OR = 1.48, 95%CI, 1.37–1.59), respiratory distress (OR = 1.31, 95%CI, 1.21–1.41) and dyspnoea (OR = 1.25, 95%CI, 1.15–1.36), the presence of at least one risk factor/comorbidity (OR = 1.32, 95%CI, 1.23–1.42), chronic kidney disease (OR = 1.94, 95%CI, 1.69–2.23), immunosuppression (OR = 1.51, 95%CI, 1.26–1.81) or chronic neurological disease (OR = 1.36, 95%CI, 1.18–1.58), and ventilatory support, invasive (OR = 8.89, 95%CI, 8.08–9.79) or non-invasive (OR = 1.25, 95%CI, 1.15–1.35). Conclusions Factors associated with death were male sex, old age, oxygen saturation &lt;95%, respiratory distress, dyspnoea, chronic kidney and neurological diseases, immunosuppression, and use of invasive or noninvasive ventilatory support. Identifying factors associated with disease progression can help the clinical management of patients with COVID-19 and improve outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4308701451,"COVID-19 had a tremendous effect on medical education. Most teaching sessions had to be shifted online, posing additional stress and potential isolation on medical students. However, it also offered the promotion of innovative digital teaching concepts. In this article, an approach to undergraduate mental health training is presented and evaluated. The curriculum was designed according to Kern's six-step approach and consisted of asynchronous online material as well synchronous digital teaching and was accompanied by a plethora of newly developed teaching material (videos, fact sheets, etc.). Content covered the whole spectrum of diseases seen in a service of psychosomatic medicine and psychotherapy (i.e. anxiety, depression, trauma, somatoform and eating disorders, as well as motivational interviewing). Feedback from participants was collected, and exam results (written and practical) were compared to pre-COVID-19 times using t-tests for dependent and independent samples. Students were highly satisfied with the teaching (rating of 1.3 ± 0.6, n = 139 students). There was no significant difference from course evaluations before COVID-19 (1.5 ± 0.5, p &gt; .05). The teaching also received an award in the students' competition ""best digital teaching concept in summer term 2020"". In the written exams, there was no significant difference between before COVID-19 (2.4 ± 0.45) and during COVID-19 times (1.6 ± 0.39; p &gt; .05). In the practical objective structured clinical examination (OSCE), there was also no significant difference between students' judgement of the difficulty of the station (1.9 ± 0.22 vs 1.9 ± 0.31; p &gt; .05) or how well-prepared they felt for the exam (2.0 ± 0.24 vs 2.0 ± 0.31; p &gt; .05). However, there was a significant difference in terms of grades, with the pre-COVID-19 grades being significantly better (2.7 ± 0.37 vs 2.0 ± 0.44; p &lt; .05), which reflects the difficulty of transferring practical skills training to an online setting. Students particularly valued the possibility of self-directed learning combined with personal guidance by departmental experts, reflecting the importance of wellbeing-centred medical education. The pandemic triggered overnight challenges for teaching mental health that may also offer the opportunity to think about worldwide teaching standards with easily accessible material and courses online. This may offer the opportunity to enthral medical students to become mental health specialists themselves."
https://openalex.org/W4308701475,"The effective segmentation of lesion(s) from dermoscopic skin images assists the Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems in improving the diagnosing rate of skin cancer. The results of the existing skin lesion segmentation techniques are not up to the mark for dermoscopic images with artifacts like varying size corner borders with color similar to lesion(s) and/or hairs having low contrast with surrounding background. To improve the results of the existing skin lesion segmentation techniques for such kinds of dermoscopic images, an effective skin lesion segmentation method is proposed in this research work. The proposed method searches for the presence of corner borders in the given dermoscopc image and removes them if found otherwise it starts searching for the presence of hairs on it and eliminate them if present. Next, it enhances the resultant image using state-of-the-art image enhancement method and segments lesion from it using machine learning technique namely, GrabCut method. The proposed method was tested on PH2 and ISIC 2018 datasets containing 200 images each and its accuracy was measured with two evaluation metrics, i.e., Jaccard index, and Dice index. The evaluation results show that our proposed skin lesion segmentation method obtained Jaccard Index of 0.77, 0.80 and Dice index of 0.87, 0.82 values on PH2, and ISIC2018 datasets, respectively, which are better than state-of-the-art skin lesion segmentation techniques."
https://openalex.org/W4308705657,"Despite new antivirals are being approved against SARS-CoV-2 they suffer from significant constraints and are not indicated for hospitalized patients, who are left with few antiviral options. Repurposed drugs have previously shown controversial clinical results and it remains difficult to understand why certain trials delivered positive results and other trials failed. Our manuscript contributes to explaining the puzzle: this might have been caused by a suboptimal drug exposure and, consequently, an incomplete virus suppression, also because the drugs have mostly been used as add-on monotherapies. As with other viruses (e.g., HIV and HCV) identifying synergistic combinations among such drugs could overcome monotherapy-related limitations. In a cell culture model for SARS-CoV-2 infection the following stringent criteria were adopted to assess drug combinations: 1) identify robust, synergistic antiviral activity with no increase in cytotoxicity, 2) identify the lowest drug concentration inhibiting the virus by 100% (LIC 100 ) and 3) understand whether the LIC 100 could be reached in the lung at clinically indicated drug doses. Among several combinations tested, remdesivir with either azithromycin or ivermectin synergistically increased the antiviral activity with no increase in cytotoxicity, improving the therapeutic index and lowering the LIC 100 of every one of the drugs to levels that are expected to be achievable and maintained in the lung for a therapeutically relevant period of time. These results are consistent with recent clinical observations showing that intensive care unit admission was significantly delayed by the combination of AZI and RDV, but not by RDV alone, and could have immediate implications for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 as the proposed “drug cocktails” should have antiviral activity against present and future SARS-CoV-2 variants without significant overlapping toxicity, while minimizing the onset of drug resistance. Our results also provide a validated methodology to help sort out which combination of drugs are most likely to be efficacious in vivo , based on their in vitro activity, potential synergy and PK profiles."
https://openalex.org/W4308705698,"Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) results in weakening of the heart muscle and an increased risk for chronic heart failure. Therapeutic stem cells have been shown to reduce inflammatory signaling and scar tissue expansion, despite most of these studies being limited by poor retention of cells. Gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) coatings have been shown to increase the retention of these therapeutic cells near the infarct. In this work, we evaluate two different potential binding partners for GelMA-coated bone marrow cells (BMCs) and myocardial tissue: the extracellular matrix (ECM) and interstitial non-cardiomyocytes. While cells containing β1 integrins mediate cell-ECM adhesion in vivo, these cells do not promote binding to our collagen-degraded, GelMA coating. Specifically, microscopic imagining shows that even with high integrin expression, GelMA-coated BMCs do not bind to cells within the myocardium. Alternatively, BMC incubation with decellularized heart tissue results in higher adhesion of coated cells versus uncoated cells supporting our GelMA-ECM binding mode. To further evaluate the ECM binding mode, cells were incubated on slides modified with one of three different major heart ECM components: collagen, laminin, or fibronectin. While all three components promoted higher adhesion than unmodified glass, collagen-coated slides resulted in a significantly higher adhesion of GelMA-coated BMCs over laminin and fibronectin. Incubation with unmodified BMCs confirmed that without a GelMA coating minimal adhesion of BMCs occurred. We conclude that GelMA cellular coatings significantly increase the binding of cells to collagen within the ECM. Our results provide progress towards a biocompatible and easily translatable method to enhance the retention of transplanted cells in human studies."
https://openalex.org/W4308699850,"Background There is increasing concern and focus in the interventional cardiology community on potential long term health issues related to radiation exposure and heavy wearable protection. Optimized shielding measures may reduce operator dose to levels where lighter radioprotective garments can safely be used, or even omitted. X-ray blankets (XRB) are commercially available but suffer from small size and lack of stability. A larger XRB may reduce operator dose but could hamper vascular access and visualization. The aim of this study is to assess shielding effect of an optimized XRB during cardiac catheterization and estimate the potential reduction in annual operator dose based on DICOM Radiation Dose Structured Report (RDSR) data reflecting everyday clinical practice. Methods Data accumulated from 7681 procedures over three years in our RDSR repository was used to identify projection angles and radiation doses during cardiac catheterization. Using an anthropomorphic phantom and a scatter radiation detector, radiation dose to the operator (mSv) and patient (dose area product—DAP) was measured for each angiographic projection for three different shielding setups. Relative operator dose (mSv/DAP) was calculated and multiplied by DAP per projection to estimate effect on operator dose. Results Adding an optimized XRB to a standard shielding setup comprising a table- and ceiling-mounted shield resulted in a 94.9% reduction in estimated operator dose. The largest shielding effect was observed in left and cranial projections where the ceiling-mounted shield offered less protection. Conclusions An optimized XRB is a simple shielding measure that has the potential to reduce operator dose."
https://openalex.org/W4308699856,"While vitamin D inadequacy occurs worldwide, there is a lack of consensus internationally on the optimum plasma levels of 25(OH)D to maximally suppress the level of parathyroid hormone toward reducing bone loss. This study aimed to investigate the response of intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) to vitamin D3 supplementation among Malaysian women of reproductive age in a randomised double-blind placebo-control trial [NMRR-15-479-25680]. A total of 106 women who fulfilled the study inclusion criteria were randomly assigned to receive daily one of these three supplement doses (i) 600 IU vitamin D3 + 500 mg calcium; (ii) 1200 IU vitamin D3 + 500 mg calcium; or (iii) 4000 IU vitamin D3 + 500 mg calcium. The placebo group received daily 500 mg calcium. The outcome examined was change in plasma iPTH concentration in response to daily vitamin D3 supplementation for 16 weeks. Fasting blood sample was obtained at baseline and post-supplementation. A total of 78 subjects (73.6%) completed the intervention. None of the supplementation groups brought about any detectable suppression of iPTH concentration post-supplementation. Vitamin D3 supplementation resulted in overall increase in plasma 25(OH)D levels, but only the 4000 IU/day group showed a significant dose effect post-supplementation (mean 49.7 ± 26.5 nmol/L) compared to placebo (29.3 ± 13.3 nmol/L). The lack of iPTH suppression is attributed to high prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency at baseline and the supplementation regimen was inadequate to raise the 25(OH)D level to cause PTH suppression. Inadequate calcium intake of the participants was also a likely contributing factor to the result. As prolonged vitamin D insufficiency and hypocalcaemia could lead to a compensatory rise in PTH resulting in accelerated bone loss, as well as posing increasing risks of non-skeletal morbidities, further clinical trials with an adequately powered sample size should be undertaken over an appropriate study duration to verify the results obtained in this study."
https://openalex.org/W4308700298,"In this study, we examine how the prosocial ethical culture in audit firms, measured as their philanthropic contributions over gross revenues, influences auditor independence. Using 5,246 audits in the Chinese market between 2010 and 2012, we find that the level of ethical culture in audit firms is significantly negatively associated with the magnitude of earnings management and the frequencies of financial restatements of their client firms. We also find this association is even stronger when auditors provide services to clients that are economically important or when signing auditors bear school ties with at least one top executive of the client. Further evidence show that the ethical culture can both act as a mechanism that attract auditors with a compatible internal norm, and great a group norm in audit firms that directly shape auditor behavior. Collectively, our study suggests that ethical culture of audit firms can significantly improve auditor independence."

However, the applicability of this marker to measure malaria transmission risk where human populations are mostly bitten by secondary vectors in Africa has not yet been evaluated. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether anti-gSG6-P1 antibodies response could be induced in humans living in forest areas in Cameroon where An. gambiae s.l is not predominant. In October 2019 at the pick of the rainy season, blood samples were collected from people living in the Nyabessang in the forest area in the South region of Cameroon. Malaria infection was determined using thick blood smear microscopy and Rapid Diagnostic Test. The level of IgG Anti-gSG6-P1 response as a biomarker of human exposure to Anopheles bite, was assessed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Mosquitoes were collected using the human landing catches to assess Anopheles density and for the identification of Anopheles species present in that area. IgG antibody response to the gSG6-P1 salivary peptide was detected in inhabitants of Nyabessang with high inter-individual heterogeneity. No significant variation in the level of this immune response was observed according to age and gender. The concentration of gSG6-P1 antibodies was significantly correlated with the malaria infection status and, Plasmodium falciparum-infected individuals presented a significantly higher level of IgG response than uninfected individuals (p = 0.0087). No significant difference was observed according to the use of insecticide treated nets. Out of the 1,442 Anopheles mosquitoes species collected, 849 (58.9%) were identified as An. paludis, 489 (33.91%) as An. moucheti, 28 (4.44%) as An. nili, 22 (2.08%) as An. gambiae s.l and 10 (0.69%) as An. marshallii. Our findings show that IgG response to An. gambiae gSG6-P1 peptide could be detected in humans exposed predominantly to An. moucheti and An. paludis bites. Taken together, the data revealed the potential of the Anti-gSG6-P1 IgG antibody response to serve as a universal marker to assess human exposure to any Anopheles species."

Here, we broaden the scope and depth of previous investigations by considering how DWMs responded to an ongoing pandemic after the initial shock. Our dataset contains listings from 194 DWMs collected until July 2021. We start by focusing on vaccines. We find 248 listings offering approved vaccines, like Pfizer/BioNTech and AstraZeneca, as well as vendors offering fabricated proofs of vaccination and COVID-19 passports. Then, we consider COVID-19 related products. We show that, as the regular economy has become able to satisfy the demand of these goods, DWMs have decreased their offer. Next, we analyse the profile of vendors of COVID-19 related products and vaccines. We find that most of them are specialized in a single type of listings and are willing to ship worldwide. Finally, we consider a broader set of listings mentioning COVID-19, in order to assess the general impact of the pandemic on the broader activity of DWMs. Among 10,330 such listings, we show that recreational drugs are the most affected among traditional DWMs product, with COVID-19 mentions steadily increasing since March 2020.

https://openalex.org/W4308700685,"Background Nearly 1/3 rd of patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) have left ventricular systolic dysfunction. However, the extent, direction and implications of perioperative changes in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) have not been well characterized in these patients. Methods We studied the changes in LVEF among 549 patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVEF &lt;50%) who underwent CABG as part of the Surgical Treatment for Ischemic Heart Failure (STICH) trial. Patients had pre- and post-CABG (4 month) LVEF assessments using identical cardiac imaging modality, interpreted at a core laboratory. An absolute change of &gt;10% in LVEF was considered clinically significant. Results Of the 549 patients (mean age 61.4±9.55 years, and 72 [13.1%] women), 145 (26.4%) had a &gt;10% improvement in LVEF, 369 (67.2%) had no change and 35 (6.4%) had &gt;10% worsening of LVEF following CABG. Patients with lower preoperative LVEF were more likely to experience an improvement after CABG (odds ratio 1.36; 95% CI 1.21–1.53; per 5% lower preoperative LVEF; p &lt;0.001). Notably, incidence of postoperative improvement in LVEF was not influenced by presence, nor absence, of myocardial viability (25.5% vs. 28.3% respectively, p = 0.67). After adjusting for age, sex, baseline LVEF, and NYHA Class, a &gt;10% improvement in LVEF after CABG was associated with a 57% lower risk of all-cause mortality (HR: 0.43, 95% CI: 0.26–0.71). Conclusions Among patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy undergoing CABG, 26.4% had &gt;10% improvement in LVEF. An improvement in LVEF was more likely in patients with lower preoperative LVEF and was associated with improved long-term survival."

Ecosystem stability (ES) FMSY were estimated by proportion of biological production allocated to predators, giving ESFMSY of 0.23 for small pelagic and 0.27 for pelagic finfish, prioritising ecosystem over economics. To maintain both stability and biomass (SB) a full pelagic EBFM SBFMSY of about 0.08 was obtained for both small pelagic and pelagic finfish, having mostly ecosystem considerations. As the FMSY are single-species averages of catchable species targeted in a specific trophic level, multispecies fishing mortalities were proportioned by the biological production of each species in the trophic level. This way catches for each species are consistent with the average ecosystem FMSY for a trophic level. The theoretical estimates gave similar results to other fisheries for sustainable fish catches that maintain the fishery ecosystem processes. They were also tested using six tropical Ecopath Models and showed the effects of imposing commercial fishing mortalities on predominantly EBFM conditions. The ecosystem stability ESFMSY is suggested to be investigated for sustainable fish catches and the full EBFM SBFMSY for protected areas or recovery of heavily depleted stocks."

Twenty healthy participants (10 females and 10 males, 27.6±6.2yrs, 73.6±13.7kg, 175.3±8.9cm) completed a cognitive performance test, followed by the modified Harvard-step protocol, in four environments: normobaric normoxia (NN; PiO2: 146.0±1.5mmHg), NH (PiO2: 100.9±1.3mmHg), HH at the first day of ascent (HH1: PiO2 = 105.6±0.4mmHg) and HH after an overnight stay (HH2: PiO2 = 106.0±0.5mmHg). At rest and/or exercise, SpO2, NIRS, and cardiovascular and perceptual data were collected. The cerebral tissue oxygenation index and the cognitive performance (throughput, accuracy, and reaction time) were not different between the hypoxic conditions (all p&gt;0.05). In NH, SpO2 was higher compared to HH1 (ΔSpO2 NH vs HH1: 1.7±0.5%, p = 0.003) whilst heart rate (ΔHR NH vs HH2: 5.8±2.6 bpm, p = 0.03) and sympathetic activation (ΔSNSi NH vs HH2: 0.8±0.4, p = 0.03) were lower in NH compared to HH2. Heart rate (ΔHR HH1 vs HH2: 6.9±2.6 bpm, p = 0.01) and sympathetic action (ΔSNSi HH1 vs HH2: 0.9±0.4, p = 0.02) were both lower in HH1 compared to HH2. In conclusion, cognitive performance and cerebral oxygenation didn't differ between the hypoxic conditions. SpO2 was only higher in NH compared to HH1. In HH2, heart rate and sympathetic activation were higher compared to both NH and HH1. These conclusions account for a PiO2 between 100-106 mmHg."
https://openalex.org/W4308700791,"In this study, we investigated diagnostic accuracy of quantitative severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antigen testing and whether universal screening was effective to prevent a nosocomial outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).All adult patients admitted to an acute-care hospital in Tokyo, Japan, after receiving LUMIPULSE SARS-CoV-2 Ag using a nasopharyngeal swab and a brief questionnaire to evaluate symptoms and exposures from December 3, 2020 to March 20, 2021 were included.Of the 5191 patients, 53 were antigen-positive, 19 were inconclusive and 5119 were negative. The sensitivity and specificity (positive or inconclusive results) of the quantitative antigen test for COVID-19 diagnosis at admission was 0.957 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.855-0.995) and 0.995 (95% CI: 0.992-0.997), respectively. Six asymptomatic patients were identified on admission. Two patients were antigen-negative and diagnosed with COVID-19 later; however, they had been isolated prior to diagnosis because both had symptoms of COVID-19 and exposure. No nosocomial infections occurred during the period.Quantitative SARS-CoV-2 antigen testing was found to be valid for the early detection of asymptomatic COVID-19 patients as a universal screening test on admission."
https://openalex.org/W4308700932,"Female sex workers (FSWs) in Uganda are at high risk of HIV infection. Scaling up oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) will reduce HIV incidence if high levels of adherence are maintained. This study evaluates PrEP adherence using clinic-based pill counts and self-reported measures, and factors associated with protective levels of adherence.Participants were sex workers who had been taking PrEP for at least 5 months and were attending routine follow-up visits for PrEP care in fishing communities and along the Trans-African Highway. Participants who had a pill count showing at least 85% use since their last clinic visit and those who reported taking their PrEP every day in the last 5 months were categorised as having 'protective adherence'. Spearman's correlation and weighted kappa assessed the relationship between pill count and self-reported measures. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression was used to determine factors associated with protective adherence as measured by pill count.We recruited 524 FSWs, with a median age of 29 years (IQR 23-35). Participants were recruited from fishing communities and Trans-African Highway towns (n = 297, 56.7%, and n = 227, 43.0%). Nearly three quarters (n = 372, 71.0%) of women were estimated to have protective adherence based on pill count (i.e., a pill count of &gt;85%) and 50.4% by self-report in last 3 months. There was a strong positive association between self-reported measures and pill count measures (rest = 0.6453, 95% CI = 0.5924-0.6927) and a moderate agreement between self-reported measures and pill count measures, κ = 0.544 (95%CI = 0.4869-0.6011, p &lt; 0.001). Factors associated with protective adherence included being aged 35 years or older (aOR = 2.40, 95% CI = 1.17-4.86), living in a fishing community (aOR = 1.45, 95% CI = 0.62-3.38), and having an STI in last 3 months (aOR = 1.64, 95% CI = 1.07-2.49).Our findings indicate that PrEP-experienced FSWs attending clinical follow-up visits reported high protective levels of oral pre-exposure prophylaxis, as measured by both pill count and self-reported measures, and a moderate agreement between pill count and self-reported measures."
https://openalex.org/W4308700982,"This paper is concerned with the sampled-data consensus of networked Euler-Lagrange systems. The Euler-Lagrange system has enormous advantages in analyzing and designing dynamical systems. Yet, some problems arise in the Euler-Lagrange equation-based control laws when they contain sampled-data feedbacks. The control law differentiates the discontinuous sampled-data signals to generate its control input. In this process, infinities in the control inputs are generated inevitably. The main goal of this work is to eliminate these infinities and make the control inputs applicable. To reach this goal, a class of differentiable pulse functions is designed for the controllers. The pulse functions work as multipliers on the sampled-data signals to make them differentiable, hence avoid the infinities. A new consensus condition compatible with the pulse function is also obtained through rigorous consensus analysis. The condition is proved to be less conservative compared with that of the existing method. Finally, numerical examples are given to illustrate the findings and theoretical results."
https://openalex.org/W4308701083,"The effect of vitamin D levels on the response to the hepatitis B vaccine in childhood and the induced levels of antibodies against the hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) is not yet well understood. The study aimed to investigate the relationship between age, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration and anti-HBs titer among children under 12 years old. Serum 25(OH)D concentration and anti-HBs titer were determined in 352 healthy Caucasian children with the average age of 4.2 (2.5; 6.3) years. All children were vaccinated with 3 doses of hepatitis B vaccine (Engerix-B, GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals Limited) in infancy according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations. Only 14.5% of children had an optimal concentration of 25(OH)D ≥ 30 ng/mL and 71.9% children had a seroprotective anti-HBs titer ≥ 10 mIU/mL. Significant negative correlations were found between 25(OH)D, anti-HBs titer and age (r = -0.420, p = 0.000; r = -0.425, p = 0.000, respectively), and a weak positive correlation between 25(OH)D concentration and anti-HBs titer (r = 0.243, p = 0.000). Analysis of six clusters of children demonstrated that age is the main factor affecting anti-HBs titer. One third of children under 12 years of age had nonprotective anti-HBs titer &lt; 10 mIU/mL and around 40% had vitamin D deficiency. We conclude that vitamin D status has no impact on anti-HBs titer in children vaccinated against hepatitis B virus in infancy. Age, so time since the receipt of the last dose of hepatitis B vaccine, is the main factor influencing a decline in anti-HBs titer."
https://openalex.org/W4308701279,"Adequate intermittent preventive treatment (IPTp) uptake (≥3 doses) routinely delivered at antenatal clinics is effective in preventing malaria during pregnancy. Whereas, low IPTp uptake (24.0%) had been reported among pregnant women in Ebonyi State, there is paucity of studies comparing the uptake and its predictors in the urban and rural areas of Ebonyi State. We determined IPTp uptake and its predictors in the urban and rural areas of Ebonyi State.We conducted a cross-sectional comparative study among 864 reproductive age women selected using multistage sampling. Using a structured interviewer-administered questionnaire, we collected data on respondent's socio-demographic characteristics and IPTp uptake. Uptake was adjudged adequate if ≥3 doses were taken, otherwise inadequate. We estimated the proportion of women with adequate IPTp uptake and determined the factors associated with adequate uptake in rural and urban areas using chi square and multiple logistic regression at 5% level of significance.The mean ages of respondents in the urban and rural areas were 28.5±4.6 and 27.4±5.0 years respectively. Adequate IPTp uptake was 82.5% and 60.8% in the urban and rural respectively (p&lt;0.001). In the urban area, women whose husbands had attained ≥ secondary education (aOR:2.9; 95%CI:1.2-7.4; p = 0.02) and those who paid for sulfadoxine/pyrimethamime (aOR:0.2; 95%CI: 0.1-0.6; p = 0.01) were 2.9 times more likely and 5 times less likely to take adequate IPTp respectively compared to respondents whose husbands had attained ≤ primary education and those who had sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine free. In the rural area, women who had attended ANC &lt;4 times (aOR:0.4; 95%CI: 0.3-0.7; p&lt;0.001) were 2.5 times less likely to take adequate IPTp compared to women that had attended ANC ≥4 times.Uptake of IPTp was more in the urban than rural areas of Ebonyi State. Interventions that reinforce the importance of health professionals carrying out actions aimed at pregnant women and their partners (spousal) in order to guide them on preventive actions against malaria and other diseases are recommended in Ebonyi State."
https://openalex.org/W4308701412,"Introduction Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most frequent malignant disease in the world. In some countries with established screening programs, its incidence and mortality have decreased, and survival has improved. Aims To obtain reliable data about the epidemiology of CRC in Chile, we analyzed the trends in the last ten years and the influence of observable factors on survival, including a nationwide health program for CRC treatment access (GES program). Methods Publicly available data published by the Ministry of Health and National Institute of Statistics were used. Data were obtained from registries of mortality and hospital discharges, making follow-up of the individuals possible. Crude and age-standardized incidence and mortality rates were calculated, and individual survival was studied by constructing Kaplan–Meier curves. Finally, a Cox statistical model was established to estimate the impact of the observable factors. Results We found 37,217 newly identified CRC patients between 2008 and 2019 in Chile, corresponding to 103,239 hospital discharges. In the same period, 24,217 people died of CRC. A nearly linear, steady increase in crude incidence, mortality and prevalence was observed. CRC incidence was the lowest in the North of the country, increasing toward the South and reaching a maximum value of 34.6/100,000 inhabitants/year in terms of crude incidence and 20.7/100,000 inhabitants/year in terms of crude mortality in the XII region in 2018. We found that older patients had lower survival rates, as well as men compared to women. Survival was significantly better for patients with private insurance than those under the public insurance system, and the treating hospital also played a significant role in the survival of patients. Patients in the capital region survived longer than those in almost every other part of the country. We found no significant effect on survival associated with the GES program. Conclusions We found important inequalities in the survival probabilities for CRC patients in Chile. Survival depends mainly on the type of insurance, access to more complex hospitals, and geographical location; all three factors correlated with socioeconomic status of the population. Our work emphasized the need to create specific programs addressing primary causes to decrease the differences in CRC survival."
https://openalex.org/W4308705655,"Females of container-breeding mosquito species use visual and chemical cues to determine suitable habitats to oviposit their eggs. Female Culex mosquitoes oviposit single egg rafts containing hundreds of eggs on the surface of water in container habitats. In this project, the effects of water volume and nutrient concentration were studied using three semi-controlled field assays to determine the role these parameters play on female Culex mosquito oviposition preference. The results of this study suggest female Culex prefer to oviposit in larger volumes of water and higher concentrations of nutrients separately, but chose intermediate conditions when presented with a combination of these two variables, which follows the Goldilocks principle. This choice may provide their offspring with optimal conditions for development by reducing intraspecific competition, thereby maximizing the biological fitness of the ovipositing Culex females."
