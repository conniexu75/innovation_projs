https://openalex.org/W3182094313,"The SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617 lineage was identified in October 2020 in India1–5. Since then, it has become dominant in some regions of India and in the UK, and has spread to many other countries6. The lineage includes three main subtypes (B1.617.1, B.1.617.2 and B.1.617.3), which contain diverse mutations in the N-terminal domain (NTD) and the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that may increase the immune evasion potential of these variants. B.1.617.2—also termed the Delta variant—is believed to spread faster than other variants. Here we isolated an infectious strain of the Delta variant from an individual with COVID-19 who had returned to France from India. We examined the sensitivity of this strain to monoclonal antibodies and to antibodies present in sera from individuals who had recovered from COVID-19 (hereafter referred to as convalescent individuals) or who had received a COVID-19 vaccine, and then compared this strain with other strains of SARS-CoV-2. The Delta variant was resistant to neutralization by some anti-NTD and anti-RBD monoclonal antibodies, including bamlanivimab, and these antibodies showed impaired binding to the spike protein. Sera collected from convalescent individuals up to 12 months after the onset of symptoms were fourfold less potent against the Delta variant relative to the Alpha variant (B.1.1.7). Sera from individuals who had received one dose of the Pfizer or the AstraZeneca vaccine had a barely discernible inhibitory effect on the Delta variant. Administration of two doses of the vaccine generated a neutralizing response in 95% of individuals, with titres three- to fivefold lower against the Delta variant than against the Alpha variant. Thus, the spread of the Delta variant is associated with an escape from antibodies that target non-RBD and RBD epitopes of the spike protein. The SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant partially evades neutralization by several monoclonal antibodies and by sera from individuals who have had COVID-19, but two doses of anti-COVID-19 vaccines still generate a strong neutralizing response."

IntroductionNeurons share many common functions, yet there are a remarkable variety of different neuronal types, each with distinct features and functions. Because genetic programs likely specify these differences, a comprehensive molecular model of the brain requires a gene expression map at single-cell resolution. Although profiling methods have cataloged diverse neuron types in a variety of organisms (Adorjan et al., 2019Adorjan I. Tyler T. Bhaduri A. Demharter S. Finszter C.K. Bako M. Sebok O.M.

The complete anatomy and wiring diagram of the C. elegans nervous system were defined by serial section electron microscopy (Albertson and Thomson, 1976Albertson D.G. Thomson J.N.

This approach identified 118 anatomically distinct classes among the 302 neurons in the mature hermaphrodite nervous system. We established the C. elegans Neuronal Gene Expression Map & Network (CeNGEN) consortium (Hammarlund et al., 2018Hammarlund M. Hobert O. Miller 3rd, D.M. Sestan N. The CeNGEN Project: The Complete Gene Expression Map of an Entire Nervous System.Neuron. 2018; 99: 430-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) to generate transcriptional profiles of each neuron class, thereby bridging the gap between C. elegans neuroanatomy and the genetic blueprint that defines it. We used fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) to isolate neurons from L4 stage larvae for scRNA-seq. By the L4 stage, the entire nervous system has been generated and most neurons have terminally differentiated. Our approach generated profiles of 70,296 neurons, including all 118 canonical neuron classes and thus offers a comprehensive catalog of gene expression for an entire nervous system.We found that every neuron class is defined by distinct combinations of neuropeptide-encoding genes and neuropeptide receptors, suggesting different roles for each type of neuron in sending and receiving signals. We identified an expansive catalog of DNA and RNA sequence motifs that are correlated with cohorts of co-regulated genes. We used computational approaches to identify cell adhesion molecules associated with neuron-specific synapses and bundling. Together, our results provide a comprehensive link between neuron-specific gene expression and the structure and function of an entire nervous system. We expect that these datasets and the tools that we have developed for interrogating them will power future investigations into the genetic basis of neuronal connectivity and function.Results and discussionscRNA-seq identifies all known neuron classes in the mature C. elegans nervous systemTo profile the entire C. elegans nervous system (Figure 1A), we isolated neurons at the L4 larval stage, when all neuron types have been generated (Sulston and Horvitz, 1977Sulston J.E. Horvitz H.R. Post-embryonic cell lineages of the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans.Dev. Biol. 1977; 56: 110-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (2333) Google Scholar) and terminally differentiated to generate a functional nervous system. Initially, we used FACS to isolate neurons from a pan-neural marker strain and found that many neuron classes were either underrepresented or absent (Figures S1A–S1C). To overcome this limitation, we isolated cells from a series of fluorescent marker strains that labeled distinct subsets of neurons (Figure 1C; Table S1). We generated 100,955 single cell transcriptomes with a median of 928 unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) and 328 genes/cell. Application of the uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) dimensional reduction algorithm effectively segregated most of these cells into distinct groups (Figure S2A).Figure S1Isolating L4 larval stage neurons from fluorescent marker strains for scRNA-seq, related to Figures 1 and 2 and Table S1Show full caption(A) Confocal images of the pan-neural marker, rab-3::TagRFP (otIs355), ventral cord cholinergic motor neurons marked with acr-2::GFP (juIs14) and neurons in the head region dual-labeled with the GABA neuron-specific reporter, unc-47::GFP (oxIs12) and the pan neural marker strain, rab-3::TagRFP.

Neurons had a median of 1,033 UMIs and 363 genes/cell. Most neuronal UMAP clusters could be assigned to individual neuron classes based on known marker genes (Hobert et al., 2016Hobert O.

The remaining clusters contained multiple, closely related neuron classes (e.g., oxygen-sensing neurons, ventral cord motor neurons). Individual UMAP projections of these clusters facilitated the annotation of 38 additional neuron types (Figures 1E, 1F, and S3F–S3J), including subtypes within 10 classes (see below). Only two neuron classes were inseparable, the DD and VD ventral cord GABAergic motor neurons, despite known differences in gene expression (Melkman and Sengupta, 2005Melkman T. Sengupta P.

We detected distinct subclusters for two neuron classes with 6-fold symmetry at the nerve ring, the inner labial IL2 neurons (Figures 2A and 2C) and the RMD neurons (Figures 1E and S4A). In both cases, the left/right pair of neurons (e.g., IL2L/R) segregates from the dorsal/ventral pairs (IL2DL/R and IL2VL/R). Differentially expressed genes between the IL2 clusters encode neuropeptides, ion channels, calcium binding proteins, and transcription factors and point to potentially distinct functions for the subtypes (Figures 2C and 2D). For the GABAergic RME head motor neurons, we detected distinct dorsal/ventral (RMED/V) and left/right clusters (RMEL/R) (Figures 1F and S4A). We also identified multiple clusters for the DA, DB, VA, VB, and VC ventral nerve cord motor neuron classes. In each case, one subtype corresponded to one or two individual members of these classes. For example, VC4 and VC5, which flank the vulva, clustered independently from the other four VC neurons (Figures 1F and S4A). For A-class motor neurons (DA and VA), we detected distinct clusters corresponding to the most posterior neurons located in the pre-anal ganglion, DA9 and VA12 (Figures 1E and S4A).Both B-class motor neuron classes (DB and VB) contained multiple independent clusters (Figures 2E and S4A). In this case, the most anterior B-class motor neurons (DB1, VB1, and VB2) segregated into separate clusters. The homeodomain transcription factor CEH-12 is selectively expressed in VBs (Von Stetina et al., 2007Von Stetina S.E. Fox R.M. Watkins K.L. Starich T.A. Shaw J.E. Miller 3rd, D.M. UNC-4 represses CEH-12/HB9 to specify synaptic inputs to VA motor neurons in C. elegans.Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 332-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) and marks the VB clusters (Figure 2E). We identified VB1 based on expression of a GFP reporter gene for the subcluster-specific marker sptf-1 (Figure 2E-F). The VB2 subcluster was similarly identified by the selective expression of hlh-17::GFP in VB2 among VBs in vivo (Figure 2E-G). Interestingly, all of the molecularly distinct subclasses we detected also have known differences in synaptic connectivity (Hobert et al., 2016Hobert O. Glenwinkel L. White J.

Biol. 2016; 26: R1197-R1203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar; White et al., 1986White J.G. Southgate E. Thomson J.N. Brenner S. The structure of the nervous system of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1986; 314: 1-340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).We did not detect subtypes for additional classes with 3-, 4-, or 6-fold symmetry. This may be due to the low number of cells (<100 for OLQ, SAA, URY, and IL1, see Table S1) assigned to some of these classes. Alternatively, molecular differences among subsets of these neuron types (Hobert et al., 2016Hobert O. Glenwinkel L. White J. Revisiting Neuronal Cell Type Classification in Caenorhabditis elegans.Curr. Biol. 2016; 26: R1197-R1203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) may be limited to a small number of genes that would be insufficient to drive separation in our analyses.Using 7,390 highly variable genes (see STAR Methods), we generated a network describing the relative molecular relationship of the 128 identified neuron classes and subclasses (Figure 2I). This approach separated sensory and motor neurons as well as a distinct cluster of pharyngeal neurons. Interestingly, pre-motor interneurons cluster with motor neurons. Amphid/phasmid sensory neurons clearly separated from non-amphid/phasmid sensory neuron types. Within amphid/phasmid neurons, some neurons cluster according to sensory modalities. Notably, the chemorepulsive neurons ADL, ASH, and PHA/PHB form their own subcluster. The CO2-sensitive BAG neuron and the CAN neuron show the least similarity to other neuron types. Thus, a systematic comparison of neuron-specific profiles confirms that neurons with shared anatomical and functional characteristics are defined by similar patterns of gene expression.Defining gene expression across neuron typesA key consideration for scRNA-seq data is accurately determining whether a detected signal (UMI) for a given gene is actual expression in a cell type (rather than noise). We addressed this question quantitatively by thresholding aggregated data for each cell type using a ground-truth dataset of high-confidence gene expression results across the entire nervous system (mostly fosmid-based reporters and/or reporter-tagged endogenous genes; see STAR Methods and Figure S5). We selected 4 threshold levels (designated as 1–4) offering different compromises between the risk of false-positives and false-negatives. We used threshold 2 for subsequent analyses. With this threshold, we estimate a true positive detection rate of 0.81 and a false discovery rate of 0.14 (see STAR Methods). The number of genes detected per neuron type (median, 5,842; range = 1,371 [ALN] to 7,542 [ASJ]) was positively correlated with the number of cells sequenced per neuron type (median, 352; range = 12 [M4] to 3,189 [AIZ]; Figure S5I, Spearman rank correlation = 0.783, p < 2.2e−16) and with the true positive rate (Figure S5J, Spearman rank correlation = 0.6776, p < 2.2e−16). Neurons with fewer cells and fewer detected genes were concentrated in the anterior and pre-anal ganglia (Figure S5H), possibly reflecting bias in the dissociation procedure. Nine neuron classes with the fewest detected genes and lowest true positive rates compared to ground truth are labeled in Figure S5J. These cell types are likely to have the highest rates of false negatives, as we estimate the true mean number of genes expressed per neuron type to be ∼6,550 (see STAR Methods).Figure S5Establishing expression thresholds, related to Figures 3 and 4 and Table S2Show full captionA) Jitter plot of normalized ttx-1 expression (y axis) in all neuronal clusters (x axis) shows strongest expression in AFD, M2, RIB and RIP.

https://openalex.org/W3112934313,"Treatment with combined immune checkpoint blockade (CICB) targeting CTLA-4 and PD-1 is associated with clinical benefit across tumor types, but also a high rate of immune-related adverse events. Insights into biomarkers and mechanisms of response and toxicity to CICB are needed. To address this, we profiled the blood, tumor and gut microbiome of 77 patients with advanced melanoma treated with CICB, with a high rate of any ≥grade 3 immune-related adverse events (49%) with parallel studies in pre-clinical models. Tumor-associated immune and genomic biomarkers of response to CICB were similar to those identified for ICB monotherapy, and toxicity from CICB was associated with a more diverse peripheral T-cell repertoire. Profiling of gut microbiota demonstrated a significantly higher abundance of Bacteroides intestinalis in patients with toxicity, with upregulation of mucosal IL-1β in patient samples of colitis and in pre-clinical models. Together, these data offer potential new therapeutic angles for targeting toxicity to CICB. Clinical benefit or intestinal toxicity resulting from combined immune checkpoint blockade in patients with melanoma associates with prevalent commensal bacteria and can be decoupled by IL-1R inhibition."

Here, we present a multi-omic single-nucleus study of 191,890 nuclei in late-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD), accessible through our web portal, profiling chromatin accessibility and gene expression in the same biological samples and uncovering vast cellular heterogeneity. We identified cell-type-specific, disease-associated candidate cis-regulatory elements and their candidate target genes, including an oligodendrocyte-associated regulatory module containing links to APOE and CLU. We describe cis-regulatory relationships in specific cell types at a subset of AD risk loci defined by genome-wide association studies, demonstrating the utility of this multi-omic single-nucleus approach. Trajectory analysis of glial populations identified disease-relevant transcription factors, such as SREBF1, and their regulatory targets. Finally, we introduce single-nucleus consensus weighted gene coexpression analysis, a coexpression network analysis strategy robust to sparse single-cell data, and perform a systems-level analysis of the AD transcriptome."

We assessed the safety and efficacy of efruxifermin, a long-acting Fc-FGF21 fusion protein, for the treatment of NASH. BALANCED was a randomized, placebo-controlled study in patients with NASH conducted at 27 centers in the United States (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03976401 ). Eighty patients, stratified by hepatic fat fraction (HFF) and fibrosis stage, were randomized using a centrally administered minimization algorithm 1:1:1:1 to receive placebo (n = 21) or efruxifermin 28 mg (n = 19), efruxifermin 50 mg (n = 20) or efruxifermin 70 mg (n = 20) via weekly subcutaneous injection for 16 weeks. The primary endpoint—absolute change from baseline in HFF measured as magnetic resonance imaging–proton density fat fraction at week 12—was met. For the full analysis set, the least squares mean absolute changes (one-sided 97.5% confidence interval) from baseline in HFF were −12.3% (−infinity (−inf), −10.3), −13.4% (−inf, −11.4) and −14.1% (−inf, −12.1) in the 28-, 50- and 70-mg groups, respectively, versus 0.3% (−inf, 1.6) in the placebo group, with statistically significant differences between efruxifermin groups and placebo (P < 0.0001 each). Overall, 70 of 79 patients who received the study drug (89%) experienced at least one treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE), with the majority grade 1–2 (64 (81%)), five (6%) grade 3 and one grade 4. The most commonly reported drug-related TEAEs were grade 1–2 gastrointestinal (36 (46%)). Treatment with efruxifermin significantly reduced HFF in patients with F1–F3 stage NASH, with an acceptable safety profile. Results from BALANCED, a phase 2a, multicenter, randomized controlled trial testing efruxifermin (a long-acting Fc-FGF21 fusion protein) over 16 weeks, demonstrated significant reductions in the hepatic fat fraction in patients with F1–F3 stage non-alcoholic steatohepatitis."
https://openalex.org/W3180384198,"Patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 exhibit low expression of interferon-stimulated genes, contributing to a limited antiviral response. Uncovering the underlying mechanism of innate immune suppression and rescuing the innate antiviral response remain urgent issues in the current pandemic. Here we identified that the dimerization domain of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (SARS2-NP) is required for SARS2-NP to undergo liquid-liquid phase separation with RNA, which inhibits Lys63-linked poly-ubiquitination and aggregation of MAVS and thereby suppresses the innate antiviral immune response. Mice infected with an RNA virus carrying SARS2-NP exhibited reduced innate immunity, an increased viral load and high morbidity. Notably, we identified SARS2-NP acetylation at Lys375 by host acetyltransferase and reported frequently occurring acetylation-mimicking mutations of Lys375, all of which impaired SARS2-NP liquid-liquid phase separation with RNA. Importantly, a peptide targeting the dimerization domain was screened out to disrupt the SARS2-NP liquid-liquid phase separation and demonstrated to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication and rescue innate antiviral immunity both in vitro and in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W3181116195,"The remaining carbon budget for limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius will probably be exhausted within this decade1,2. Carbon debt3 generated thereafter will need to be compensated by net-negative emissions4. However, economic policy instruments to guarantee potentially very costly net carbon dioxide removal (CDR) have not yet been devised. Here we propose intertemporal instruments to provide the basis for widely applied carbon taxes and emission trading systems to finance a net-negative carbon economy5. We investigate an idealized market approach to incentivize the repayment of previously accrued carbon debt by establishing the responsibility of emitters for the net removal of carbon dioxide through 'carbon removal obligations' (CROs). Inherent risks, such as the risk of default by carbon debtors, are addressed by pricing atmospheric CO2 storage through interest on carbon debt. In contrast to the prevailing literature on emission pathways, we find that interest payments for CROs induce substantially more-ambitious near-term decarbonization that is complemented by earlier and less-aggressive deployment of CDR. We conclude that CROs will need to become an integral part of the global climate policy mix if we are to ensure the viability of ambitious climate targets and an equitable distribution of mitigation efforts across generations."

In this study, we generated a genomic atlas of protein levels in three tissues relevant to neurological disorders (brain, cerebrospinal fluid and plasma) by profiling thousands of proteins from participants with and without Alzheimer’s disease. We identified 274, 127 and 32 protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs) for cerebrospinal fluid, plasma and brain, respectively. cis-pQTLs were more likely to be tissue shared, but trans-pQTLs tended to be tissue specific. Between 48.0% and 76.6% of pQTLs did not co-localize with expression, splicing, DNA methylation or histone acetylation QTLs. Using Mendelian randomization, we nominated proteins implicated in neurological diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and stroke. This first multi-tissue study will be instrumental to map signals from genome-wide association studies onto functional genes, to discover pathways and to identify drug targets for neurological diseases.

Previous studies of CH analyzed either single-nucleotide variants and indels (SNVs/indels) or copy number alterations (CNAs), but not both. Here, using a combination of targeted sequencing of 23 CH-related genes and array-based CNA detection of blood-derived DNA, we have delineated the landscape of CH-related SNVs/indels and CNAs in 11,234 individuals without HM from the BioBank Japan cohort, including 672 individuals with subsequent HM development, and studied the effects of these somatic alterations on mortality from HM and cardiovascular disease, as well as on hematological and cardiovascular phenotypes. The total number of both types of CH-related lesions and their clone size positively correlated with blood count abnormalities and mortality from HM. CH-related SNVs/indels and CNAs exhibited statistically significant co-occurrence in the same individuals. In particular, co-occurrence of SNVs/indels and CNAs affecting DNMT3A, TET2, JAK2 and TP53 resulted in biallelic alterations of these genes and was associated with higher HM mortality. Co-occurrence of SNVs/indels and CNAs also modulated risks for cardiovascular mortality. These findings highlight the importance of detecting both SNVs/indels and CNAs in the evaluation of CH."

Kinesiophobia (fear of pain to movement or re-injury) combined with emotions and physical variables may play a vital role in assessing and managing individuals with CNP. The study’s objectives are 1) to evaluate the relationship between kinesiophobia, neck pain intensity, proprioception, and functional performance; 2) to determine if kinesiophobia predicts pain intensity, proprioception, and functional performance among CNP individuals. Sixty-four participants with CNP (mean age 54.31 ± 9.41) were recruited for this cross-sectional study. The following outcome measures were evaluated: Kinesiophobia using the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia (TSK), neck pain intensity using the visual analog scale (VAS), cervical proprioceptive joint position errors (in flexion, extension, and rotation directions) using cervical range of motion (CROM) device and handgrip strength as a measure of functional performance using the Baseline® hydraulic hand dynamometer. Kinesiophobia showed a strong positive correlation with neck pain intensity (r = 0.81, p&lt;0.001), a mild to a moderate positive correlation with proprioception joint position errors (JPE) in extension, rotation left and right directions (p&lt;0.05), but no correlation in flexion direction (p = 0.127). Also, there was a moderate negative correlation with handgrip strength (r = -0.65, p&lt;0.001). Regression analysis proved that kinesiophobia was a significant predictor of pain intensity, proprioception, and functional performance (p&lt;0.05). This study infers that kinesiophobia in individuals with CNP predicts pain, proprioception, and functional performance. Kinesiophobia assessment should be considered in regular clinical practice to understand the barriers that can influence rehabilitation outcomes in CNP individuals."

Deciphering the cellular ubiquitin code is of central importance to understand the physiology of the cell. However, our understanding of its function is rather limited due to the lack of specific binders as tools to detect K29-linked polyubiquitin. In this study, we screened and characterized a synthetic antigen-binding fragment, termed sAB-K29, that can specifically recognize K29-linked polyubiquitin using chemically synthesized K29-linked diubiquitin. We further determined the crystal structure of this fragment bound to the K29-linked diubiquitin, which revealed the molecular basis of specificity. Using sAB-K29 as a tool, we uncovered that K29-linked ubiquitination is involved in different kinds of cellular proteotoxic stress response as well as cell cycle regulation. In particular, we showed that K29-linked ubiquitination is enriched in the midbody and downregulation of the K29-linked ubiquitination signal arrests cells in G1/S phase."
https://openalex.org/W3182124707,"The impact of the microbiome on HIV disease is widely acknowledged although the mechanisms downstream of fluctuations in microbial composition remain speculative. We detected rapid, dynamic changes in translocated microbial constituents during two years after cART initiation. An unbiased systems biology approach revealed two distinct pathways driven by changes in the abundance ratio of Serratia to other bacterial genera. Increased CD4 T cell numbers over the first year were associated with high Serratia abundance, pro-inflammatory innate cytokines, and metabolites that drive Th17 gene expression signatures and restoration of mucosal integrity. Subsequently, decreased Serratia abundance and downregulation of innate cytokines allowed re-establishment of systemic T cell homeostasis promoting restoration of Th1 and Th2 gene expression signatures. Analyses of three other geographically distinct cohorts of treated HIV infection established a more generalized principle that changes in diversity and composition of translocated microbial species influence systemic inflammation and consequently CD4 T cell recovery."

In mammalian brain, the architecture and dynamics of nuclear compartment-associated genome organization is not known. In this study, we developed Genome Organization using CUT and RUN Technology (GO-CaRT) to map genomic interactions with two nuclear compartments‚Äîthe nuclear lamina and nuclear speckles‚Äîfrom different regions of the developing mouse, macaque and human brain. Lamina-associated domain (LAD) architecture in cells in vivo is distinct from that of cultured cells, including major differences in LADs previously considered to be cell type invariant. In the mouse and human forebrain, dorsal and ventral neural precursor cells have differences in LAD architecture that correspond to their regional identity. LADs in the human and mouse cortex contain transcriptionally highly active sub-domains characterized by broad depletion of histone-3-lysine-9 dimethylation. Evolutionarily conserved LADs in human, macaque and mouse brain are enriched for transcriptionally active neural genes associated with synapse function. By integrating GO-CaRT maps with genome-wide association study data, we found speckle-associated domains to be enriched for schizophrenia risk loci, indicating a physical relationship between these disease-associated genetic variants and a specific nuclear structure. Our work provides a framework for understanding the relationship between distinct nuclear compartments and genome function in brain development and disease.

https://openalex.org/W3182277482,"Despite the evidence of links between health expenditure and health care efficiency, it is still unclear why countries with similar levels of health expenditures experience different outputs in terms of life expectancy at birth. Health care system efficiency might shed some light on the question. Using output-oriented data envelopment analysis, we compared the health systems of 140 countries in terms of attained life expectancy. Efficiency is determined by the distance from the closest country on the best practice frontier, which identifies the highest attainable life expectancy observed for any given level of health care spending. By using national data form the Human Development Data, we built the efficiency frontier and computed the potential life expectancy increase for each country. The potential improvement was, on average, 5.47 years [95%CI: 4.71-6.27 years]. The least efficient countries (10th percentile of the efficiency score) could improve by 11.78 years, while the most efficient countries (90th percentile of the efficiency score) could only improve by 0.83 years. We then analyzed, with regression analysis stratified by average education level, and by the role of health-related variables in differentiating efficient and inefficient countries from each other. The results suggest that, among countries with lower levels of education, decreasing unemployment and income inequality increases average life expectancy, without increasing health expenditure levels."

Results MoCA scores were converted to MMSE-2 scores according to a conversion table that achieved a reliability of 0.961 (intraclass correlation). The accuracy of this algorithm was 84.5% within 3 points difference from the raw score.

PEAK1 (Pseudopodium-Enriched Atypical Kinase One) is an actin cytoskeleton- and focal adhesion-associated pseudokinase that promotes cell state plasticity and cancer metastasis by mediating growth factor-integrin signaling crosstalk. Here, we determined that stromal PEAK1 expression predicts poor outcomes in HER2-positive breast cancers high in SNAI2 expression and enriched for MSC content. Specifically, we identified that the fibroblastic stroma in HER2-positive breast cancer patient tissue stains positive for both nuclear SNAI2 and cytoplasmic PEAK1. Furthermore, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) express high PEAK1 protein levels and potentiate tumorigenesis, lapatinib resistance and metastasis of HER2-positive breast cancer cells in a PEAK1-dependent manner. Analysis of PEAK1-dependent secreted factors from MSCs revealed INHBA/activin-A as a necessary factor in the conditioned media of PEAK1-expressing MSCs that promotes lapatinib resistance.

Here, I characterized the microbiota of indoor surface nest of four brazilian stingless bee species (Apidae: Meliponini) with different construction behaviors and populations. Bees that use predominantly plant material to build the nest (Frieseomelitta varia and Tetragonisca angustula) have a microbiome dominated by bacteria found in the phylloplane and flowers such as Pseudomonas sp. and Sphingomonas sp. Species that use mud and feces (Trigona spinipes) possess a microbiome dominated by coliforms such as Escherichia coli and Alcaligenes faecalis. Melipona quadrifasciata, which uses both mud / feces and plant resin, showed a hybrid microbiome with microbes found in soil, feces and plant material.

Both pharmacologic and genetic inhibition of TrxR impairs the growth of human AML in mouse models. We found that TrxR inhibition leads to a rapid and marked impairment of metabolism in leukemic cells subsequently leading to cell death. TrxR was found to be a major and direct regulator of metabolism in AML cells through impacts on both glycolysis and the TCA cycle. Studies revealed that TrxR directly regulates GAPDH leading to a disruption of glycolysis and an increase in flux through the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). The combined inhibition of TrxR and the PPP led to enhanced leukemia growth inhibition. Overall, TrxR abrogation, particularly with S-250, was identified as a promising strategy to disrupt AML metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W3181936373,"Recent growth and institutionalization in the field of mixed methods research has provided fertile ground for a wide range of thoughtful criticism of how this research approach has been developed and conceptualized by some members of the mixed methods community. This criticism reflects the increasing maturity of the field as well as the different theoretical perspectives and methodological practices of researchers in different disciplines. While debates addressing these criticisms are likely to lead to valuable insights, no empirical studies have been carried out to date that have investigated researchers' critical views on the development and conceptualization of mixed methods research. This study examines the criticisms of the mixed methods field raised by a cross-national sample of researchers in education, nursing, psychology, and sociology. We carried out a secondary analysis of semi-structured interviews with 42 researchers and identified 11 different criticisms, which we classified in four domains: essence of mixed methods, philosophy, procedures, and politics. The criticisms related to the procedures domain were equally distributed among the four disciplines, while those related to the essence, philosophy and politics domains were more common among sociologists. Based on our findings, we argue that the divergence of views on foundational issues in this field reflects researchers' affiliation to different communities of practice, each having its own principles, values, and interests. We suggest that a greater awareness of this divergence of perspectives could help researchers establish effective collaboration and anticipate potential challenges when working with researchers having different methodological approaches."

Identification of the best reference gene is a key point in performing high-quality qPCR, providing strong support for results, and performing as a source of bias when inappropriately chosen. Mesangial cells and podocytes, as essential cell lines to study diabetic kidney disease (DKD) physiopathology, demand accurate analysis of the reference genes used thus far to enhance the validity of gene expression studies, especially regarding high glucose (HG) and DKD treatments, with angiotensin II receptor blockers (e.g., losartan) being the most commonly used. This study aimed to evaluate the suitability and define the most stable reference gene for mesangial cell and podocyte studies of an in vitro DKD model of disease and its treatment. Methods Five software packages (RefFinder, NormFinder, GeNorm, Bestkeeper, and DataAssist) and the comparative ΔCt method were selected to analyze six different candidate genes: HPRT , ACTB , PGAM-1 , GAPDH , PPIA , and B2M . RNA was extracted, and cDNA was synthesized from immortalized mouse mesangial cells and podocytes cultured in 4 groups: control (n = 5; 5 mM glucose), mannitol (n = 5; 30 mM, as osmotic control), HG (n = 5; 30 mM glucose), and HG + losartan (n = 5; 30 mM glucose and 10 −4 mM losartan). Real-time PCR was performed according to MIQE guidelines. Results We identified that the use of 2 genes was the best combination for qPCR normalization for both mesangial cells and podocytes. For mesangial cells, the combination of HPRT and ACTB presented higher stability values. For podocytes, HPRT and GAPDH showed the best results. Conclusion This analysis provides support for the use of HPRT and ACTB as reference genes in mouse mesangial cell studies of gene expression via real-time PCR, while for podocytes, HPRT and GAPDH should be chosen."
https://openalex.org/W3181348256,"Coral disease is a growing problem for coral reefs globally and diseases have been linked to thermal stress, excess nutrients, overfishing and other human impacts. The Red Sea is a unique environment for corals with a strong environmental gradient characterized by temperature extremes and high salinities, but minimal terrestrial runoff or riverine input and their associated pollution. Yet, relatively little is known about coral diseases in this region. Disease surveys were conducted at 22 reefs within three regions (Yanbu, Thuwal, Al Lith) in the central Red Sea along the Saudi Arabian coast. Surveys occurred in October 2015, which coincided with a hyperthermal-induced bleaching event. Our objectives were to 1) document types, prevalence, and distribution of coral diseases in a region with minimal terrestrial input, 2) compare regional differences in diseases and bleaching along a latitudinal gradient of environmental conditions, and 3) use histopathology to characterize disease lesions at the cellular level. Coral reefs of the central Red Sea had a widespread but a surprisingly low prevalence of disease (<0.5%), based on the examination of >75,750 colonies. Twenty diseases were recorded affecting 16 coral taxa and included black band disease, white syndromes, endolithic hypermycosis, skeletal eroding band, growth anomalies and focal bleached patches. The three most common diseases were Acropora white syndrome (59.1% of the survey sites), Porites growth anomalies (40.9%), and Porites white syndrome (31.8%). Sixteen out of 30 coral genera within transects had lesions and Acropora, Millepora and Lobophyllia were the most commonly affected. Cell-associated microbial aggregates were found in four coral genera including a first report in Stylophora. Differences in disease prevalence, coral cover, amount of heat stress as measured by degree heating weeks (DHW) and extent of bleaching was evident among sites. Disease prevalence was not explained by coral cover or DHW, and a negative relationship between coral bleaching and disease prevalence was found. The northern-most sites off the coast of Yanbu had the highest average disease prevalence and highest average DHW values but no bleaching. Our study provides a foundation and baseline data for coral disease prevalence in the central Red Sea, which is projected to increase as a consequence of increased frequency and severity of ocean warming."

We implemented the first extensive door-to-door longitudinal survey in 2 Cambodian provinces, namely Kandal and Battambang, to estimate dog population demographic parameters, identify dog ownership determinants, analyze dog management practices and estimate the yearly cumulative bite incidence and associated factors. During the first session, more than 5000 dogs were recorded and identified. Data on families, dogs and cats characteristics, as well as the number of bites experienced the year before in the family, were recorded. One year later, a second session was performed in both provinces to record missing dogs and the reasons for missing. Age-specific survival rates of the dog populations were computed using Kaplan-Meier estimates. Ownership determinants and bite risk factors were identified using a negative binomial regression model. Dog trade and dog meat consumption were often reported. We estimated high dog-to-human ratios (1:3.8 in Kandal, and 1:3.3 in Battambang). The mean age of dog populations was 26.4 months in Kandal against 24.3 in Battambang, with a survival rate of 52% at 24 months in Kandal (34% only in Battambang). They were no feral dogs, but the large majority of recorded dogs were free roaming. In both provinces, the number of dogs significantly increased in families with children younger than 15, and when the head of the family was a male. The estimated yearly cumulative bite incidences were 2.3 and 3.1% in Kandal and Battambang provinces respectively, and are among the highest in the world.

https://openalex.org/W3182168513,"Human skin enables interaction with diverse materials every day and at all times. The ability to grasp objects, feel textures, and perceive the environment depends on the mechanical behavior, complex structure, and microscale topography of human skin. At the same time, abrasive interactions, such as sometimes occur with prostheses or textiles, can damage the skin and impair its function. Previous theoretical and computational efforts have shown that skin's surface topography or microrelief is crucial for its tribological behavior. However, current understanding is limited to adult surface profiles and simplified two-dimensional simulations. Yet, the skin has a rich set of features in three dimensions, and the geometry of skin is known to change with aging. Here we create a numerical model of a dynamic indentation test to elucidate the effect of changes in microscale topography with aging on the skin's response under indentation and sliding contact with a spherical indenter. We create three different microrelief geometries representative of different ages based on experimental reports from the literature. We perform the indentation and sliding steps, and calculate the normal and tangential forces on the indenter as it moves in three distinct directions based on the characteristic skin lines. The model also evaluates the effect of varying the material parameters. Our results show that the microscale topography of the skin in three dimensions, together with the mechanical behavior of the skin layers, lead to distinctive trends on the stress and strain distribution. The major finding is the increasing role of anisotropy which emerges from the geometric changes seen with aging."
https://openalex.org/W3177945253,"The reciprocal relation between falling and concern about falling is complex and not well understood. We aimed to determine whether concern about falling increases after a fall and whether concern about falling increases the odds of future falls in community-dwelling older adults without a recent fall history.We selected 118 community-dwelling older adults (mean age: 71.4 (SD: 5.3) years) without a self-reported history of falling, one year prior to baseline assessment, from the one-year VIBE cohort for analyses. On a monthly basis, we recorded concern about falling (using the Falls Efficacy Scale-International, FES-I), as well as the occurrence of falls (through questionnaires and telephone calls). We determined 1) whether falling predicts an increase in concern about falling and 2) whether a high concern about falling is predictive of falling. Standard linear (fixed-effects) regression and mixed effects regression analyses were performed over long-term, i.e. one year, and short-term, i.e. one-month, intervals, respectively and were adjusted for gender, age and physical activity (quantified as the average total walking duration per day). Analyses were performed separately for all reported falls and for injurious falls only.High concern about falling at baseline did not predict falls over the course of one year, nor over the course of one month. Furthermore, falls in between baseline assessment and one year thereafter did not predict increased concern about falling from baseline to one year later, independent of whether all falls or only injurious falls were considered. However, falls, either all or injurious only, happening somewhere over the course of a one-month interval, significantly predicted small increases in concern about falling (1.49 FES-I points, 95% CI [0.74, 2.25], p<0.001 for all falls; 2.60 FES-I points, 95% CI [1.55, 3.64], p<0.001 for injurious falls) from the start to the end of that one-month interval.Older adults without a recent history of falling seem to be resilient against developing concern about falling after having fallen, resulting in a short-term temporary effect of falling on concern about falling. Furthermore, we found no evidence that a high concern about falling predicts future falls over a one-month or a one-year follow-up period, suggesting that concern is not a primary cause for falls in older adults without a recent history of falling."
https://openalex.org/W3182112984,"Microglia are the resident immune cell of the brain involved in the development and progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Modulation of microglia activity represents a potential mechanism for treating AD. Herein, the compound NNC 26–9100 (NNC) was evaluated in toxicity, nitric oxide release, Aβ 1–42 uptake and cytosolic calcium assays during lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated conditions using mouse BV2 microglia cells. After 24 hours, LPS increased cell toxicity in the alamar blue and lactate dehydrogenase assays, increased nitrite release, and increase cytoplasmic calcium. Addition of NNC decreased the LPS-induce lactate dehydrogenase release, had no effect in the alamar blue assay, decreased nitrite release and decreased cytosolic calcium. In the absence of LPS, NNC increased uptake of FITC-tagged Aβ 1–42 . These data demonstrate that NNC treatment decreases nitrosative stress and microglia cell damage during LPS-induced activation and enhances phagocytosis of Aβ 1–42 during non-inflammatory conditions. Thus, NNC 26–9100 may have beneficial effects in AD and in inflammatory diseases of the brain through enhancement of microglial Aβ clearance, and cell protective effects through prevention of elevated cytosolic calcium and inhibition of nitric oxide release."

Design Stepped-wedge cluster randomised trial (unblinded), randomised at hospital-level. Setting 12 hospitals in south-west Nigeria. Participants 7,141 children (aged 28 days to 14 years) admitted with severe pneumonia, severe malaria or diarrhoea with severe dehydration between January 2014 and October 2017. Interventions Phase 1 (pulse oximetry) introduced pulse oximetry for all admitted children. Phase 2 (full oxygen system) (i) standardised oxygen equipment package, (ii) clinical education and support, (iii) technical training and support, and (iv) infrastructure and systems support. Outcome measures We used quantitative QOC scores evaluating assessment , diagnosis , treatment , and monitoring practices against World Health Organization and Nigerian standards. We evaluated mean differences in QOC scores between study periods (baseline, oximetry, full oxygen system), using mixed-effects linear regression. Results 7,141 eligible participants; 6,893 (96.5%) had adequate data for analysis. Mean paediatric QOC score (maximum 6) increased from 1.64 to 3.00 (adjusted mean difference 1.39; 95% CI 1.08–1.69, p&lt;0.001) for severe pneumonia and 2.81 to 4.04 (aMD 1.53; 95% CI 1.23–1.83, p&lt;0.001) for severe malaria, comparing the full intervention to baseline, but did not change for diarrhoea with severe dehydration (aMD -0.12; 95% CI -0.46–0.23, p = 0.501). After excluding practices directly related to pulse oximetry and oxygen, we found aMD 0.23 for severe pneumonia (95% CI -0.02–0.48, p = 0.072) and 0.65 for severe malaria (95% CI 0.41–0.89, p&lt;0.001) comparing full intervention to baseline. Sub-analysis showed some improvements (and no deterioration) in care processes not directly related to oxygen or pulse oximetry. Conclusion Improvements in hospital oxygen systems were associated with higher QOC scores, attributable to better use of pulse oximetry and oxygen as well as broader improvements in clinical care, with no negative distortions in care practices.

Here, we describe the recombinant expression and purification of S2-E in amphipol-class amphipathic polymer solutions, which solubilize and stabilize membrane proteins, but do not disrupt membranes. We found that amphipol delivery of S2-E to preformed planar bilayers results in spontaneous membrane integration and formation of viroporin cation channels. Amphipol delivery of the S2-E protein to human cells results in plasma membrane integration, followed by retrograde trafficking to the trans-Golgi network and accumulation in swollen perinuclear lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1–positive vesicles, likely lysosomes. CoV envelope proteins have previously been proposed to manipulate the luminal pH of the trans-Golgi network, which serves as an accumulation station for progeny CoV particles prior to cellular egress via lysosomes.

Current methods to study the E protein in mammalian cells are reliant on transfection of genetic material encoding the protein into cells and its subsequent transcription and translation. Here, we sought to develop a robust method for exogenous delivery of purified SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein (S2-E) into human cell lines to enable chemical biological methods for studies of S2-E function and possibly to potentiate novel therapeutic approaches. We developed a straightforward bacterial expression and purification protocol that yields ∼100 μg per liter of culture of 90 to 95% pure full-length S2-E under conditions in which it is bereft of detergent and lipid, with its aqueous solubility being maintained by complexation with the zwitterionic amphipol poly (maleic anhydride-alt-1-decene) substituted with 3-(dimethylamino) propylamine (33Nagy J.K.

This purification protocol has been streamlined to a single gravity column and does not require semiautomated chromatography or an ultracentrifuge. Once purified into lipid/detergent-free amphipol solution, the S2-E–amphipol complexes remain stable and soluble in aqueous solution even following removal of excess uncomplexed amphipols. Amphipols are a class of amphipathic polymers that exhibit weak detergent properties, in that they can solubilize and stabilize membrane proteins but cannot solubilize or even permeabilize membranes (35Tribet C.

In addition, some amphipols are well tolerated by animals (37Fernandez A. Le Bon C. Baumlin N. Giusti F. Cremel G. Popot J.L. Bagnard D.

Planar lipid bilayer electrophysiology was used to test if amphipols can deliver the S2-E protein to a membrane environment to form ion channels without otherwise disrupting the lipid bilayer (Fig. 1A). It was seen that amphipol-based S2-E delivery resulted in ion channel activity that is consistent with previous SARS-CoV-1E (40Wilson L. McKinlay C. Gage P. Ewart G. SARS coronavirus E protein forms cation-selective ion channels.Virology. 2004; 330: 322-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) and preliminary S2-E (17Xia B. He Y. Pan X. Liu F.-L. Wang Y.

The S2-E–dependent currents and similarity to other planar bilayer measurements support the idea that S2-E is released spontaneously from amphipols into membranes. The bilayer integrity during amphipol delivery and exposure was monitored through membrane capacitance measurements. The bilayers remained stable throughout the recordings with an average value of 58 ± 3 pF. These results demonstrate that recombinant S2-E can be delivered into preformed lipid bilayers using amphipols, where the protein not only inserts into the bilayers but also retains ion channel function, without compromising the bilayer integrity. We next tested whether S2-E can be delivered from amphipol complexes to the membranes of human cells. To this end, S2-E was irreversibly tagged at one of its three native cysteine residues with fluorophores nitrobenzoxadiazole (NBD) or Alexa Flour 488 (AF488).

A Chem. 1993; 70: 229-243Crossref Scopus (182) Google Scholar) were better for observing the deposition of S2-E on the plasma membrane at early time points (Fig. S4) while the environment insensitivity of AF488 (45Rezgui R. Blumer K. Yeoh-Tan G. Trexler A.J. Magzoub M.

Acta. 2016; 1858: 1499-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) was more suited for S2-E colocalization experiments. No significant difference was observed between S2-E labeled with either AF488 or NBD when quantifying colocalization (Fig. S5). As shown in Figure 2 and Fig. S6, the NBD-labeled S2-E (S2-E-NBD) protein was delivered from amphipol complexes to HeLa cell membranes, with all cells exhibiting NBD signal within 30 min (Fig. 2B). Figure 2, C–F shows the 8 h progression of the S2-E-NBD protein from the plasma membrane to a predominately perinuclear intracellular location. After 16 to 18 h, nearly all the S2-E proteins were observed in the vicinity of the nucleus, with a clear focal area on one side of the nuclear compartment (Fig. 2, G and H). Delivered S2-E was typically more diffuse at early time points but becomes punctate as it traffics toward the perinuclear space. The amount of S2-E signal in cells was dependent on the applied amphipol/S2-E dose (Fig. S7). It was verified that NBD did not drive S2-E internalization and perinuclear aggregation (Fig. S7). To ensure that we were microscopically tracking intact S2-E-NBD instead of dye freed from full-length S2-E by degradation, we confirmed S2-E localization following cell fixation and permeabilization with a polyclonal anti-S2-E antibody (Fig. S5). We observed consistent strong colocalization between S2-E labeled with either AF488 or NBD and the polyclonal anti-E signal. Cysteine-reacted NBD was used as an S2-E degradation control and was found to stain all cellular membranes (Fig. S8). Therefore, delivered S2-E is not extensively degraded during the 24-h treatment since the level of anti-S2E and S2-E-dye colocalization remained strong at both short and long time points (Fig. S5). We observed unspecific binding of the anti-E antibody in the nucleus and determined the dye-tagged S2-E to be a better reporter of S2-E localization (Fig. S5). While amphipols have previously been reported to deliver select membrane proteins to artificial lipid bilayers (33Nagy J.K. Kuhn Hoffmann A. Keyes M.H. Gray D.N. Oxenoid K. Sanders C.R. Use of amphipathic polymers to deliver a membrane protein to lipid bilayers.FEBS Lett. 2001; 501: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 46Pocanschi C.L. Dahmane T. Gohon Y. Rappaport F.

Amphipathic polymers: Tools to fold integral membrane proteins to their active form.Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 13954-13961Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), this study represents the first use of amphipols to deliver a protein to mammalian cells. Elucidation of the pathway(s) taken by the S2-E protein to dissociate from its soluble amphipol complex to then insert into the membrane and adopt a transbilayer configuration will require further study. To ensure that the observed S2-E delivery and perinuclear trafficking was not unique to HeLa cells, we also examined possible delivery of S2-E from amphipol solutions into SW1573 human alveolar cells, a coronavirus disease 2019–relevant cell line (47Valyaeva A.A. Zharikova A.A. Kasianov A.S. Vassetzky Y.S. Sheval E.V. Expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry factors in lung epithelial stem cells and its potential implications for COVID-19.Sci. Rep. 2020; 10: 17772Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We observed (Fig. S9) that S2-E is indeed taken up by these cells and similarly undergoes surface-to-perinuclear retrograde trafficking as seen in HeLa cells. The fact that delivered S2-E retrograde traffics proximal to one side of the nucleus (Fig. 2, G and H) is consistent with its localization at or near the Golgi compartments. To gain further insight into the final cellular location of S2-E, we used organelle-specific monoclonal antibodies and wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) to pinpoint the locations of the cis-Golgi and trans-Golgi, TGN, early endosomes, lysosomes, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), aggresomes, and ER–Golgi complex intermediate compartment (ERGIC) relative to delivered S2-E in the perinuclear space at later time points. In agreement with Figure 2, B–E, S2-E does not strongly colocalize with markers of ER–Golgi space at early time points and takes 18 to 24 h for the protein to accumulate in the perinuclear space via retrograde trafficking (Fig. 2, G and H). At 18 to 24 h after initial delivery, S2-E was not found in the ER, ERGIC, or cis-Golgi (Fig. 3, D–F and Figs. S10–S12). Instead, S2-E was seen to partially overlap with the trans-Golgi marker Golgin 97 (48Lock J.G. Hammond L.A. Houghton F. Gleeson P.A. Stow J.L. E-cadherin transport from the trans-Golgi network in tubulovesicular carriers is selectively regulated by golgin-97.Traffic. 2005; 6: 1142-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) in the area surrounding the Golgi but not within the cis-Golgi (Fig. 3, A–C and Fig. S9). The partial colocalization of S2-E with the trans-Golgi and exclusion from the cis-Golgi indicated that delivered S2-E ultimately resides in the TGN and associated vesicles. WGA is an N-acetylglucosamine and sialic acid-binding lectin (49Pusztai A. Ewen S.W.B. Grant G. Brown D.S. Stewart J.C. Peumans W.J. Vandamme E.J.M. Bardocz S.

Labeling membrane glycoproteins or glycolipids with fluorescent wheat germ agglutinin.Cold Spring Harb. Protoc. 2011; 2011 (pdb.prot5623)Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In live cells, WGA is rapidly endocytosed to the Golgi and specifically accumulates in the endocytic TGN (Fig. S13) (52Pavelka M. Neumuller J. Ellinger A.

Cytochem. 1989; 37: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We observed strong colocalization between WGA and delivered S2-E between 16 and 24 h, indicating that S2-E accumulates in the TGN (Fig. 3, G–I and Fig. S10). WGA and S2-E travel to the TGN independently, and WGA does not induce S2-E TGN colocalization. There is significant bidirectional traffic between the TGN and endosome–lysosome systems (56Rohn W.M. Rouille Y. Waguri S. Hoflack B. Bi-directional trafficking between the trans-Golgi network and the endosomal/lysosomal system.J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2093-2101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and we wanted to determine if delivered S2-E was accumulating in endosomes and lysosomes at later time points. We did observe some colocalization of S2-E with early endosome marker, early endosome antigen 1 (57Wilson J.M. de Hoop M. Zorzi N. Toh B.H. Dotti C.G. Parton R.G. EEA1, a tethering protein of the early sorting endosome, shows a polarized distribution in hippocampal neurons, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2657-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), at later time points (Fig. S14). In addition, we observed colocalization of S2-E with late endosomes and lysosomes as indicated by the overlap in S2-E and lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) signals (Fig. S15) (58Jiang Y. Sato Y. Im E. Berg M. Bordi M. Darji S. Kumar A. Mohan P.S. Bandyopadhyay U. Diaz A. Cuervo A.M. Nixon R.A.

Perinuclear S2-E containing LAMP1-positive vesicles were enlarged, whereas peripheral LAMP1-positive vesicles remained unchanged. The localization of delivered S2-E to swollen TGN vesicles is likely disease relevant given that progeny CoVs are known to accumulate in the TGN before cellular egress (27Tooze J. Tooze S.A.

The envelope protein of SARS-CoV-2 increases intra-Golgi pH and forms a cation channel that is regulated by pH.J Physiol. 2021; 599: 2851-2868Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Lysosomes have long been associated with CoV infection (60Ducatelle R. Hoorens J. Significance of lysosomes in the morphogenesis of coronaviruses.Arch. Virol. 1984; 79: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and recent work showed that CoV is unique in its use of deacidified lysosomes for cellular egress (28Ghosh S. Dellibovi-Ragheb T.A. Kerviel A. Pak E. Qiu Q. Fisher M. Takvorian P.M. Bleck C. Hsu V.W. Fehr A.R. Perlman S. Achar S.R. Straus M.R.

In line with these ideas, E is known to increase the pH of the Golgi (59Cabrera-Garcia D. Bekdash R. Abbott G.W. Yazawa M. Harrison N.L. The envelope protein of SARS-CoV-2 increases intra-Golgi pH and forms a cation channel that is regulated by pH.J Physiol. 2021; 599: 2851-2868Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and TGN (61Westerbeck J.W. Machamer C.E. The infectious bronchitis coronavirus envelope protein alters Golgi pH to protect the spike protein and promote the release of infectious virus.J. Virol. 2019; 93e00015-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), apparently to protect the spike protein from premature processing. E also has been shown to slow cellular secretory pathways (62Boson B. Legros V. Zhou B. Siret E. Mathieu C. Cosset F.L. Lavillette D. Denolly S. The SARS-CoV-2 envelope and membrane proteins modulate maturation and retention of the spike protein, allowing assembly of virus-like particles.J. Biol. Chem. 2020; 296: 100111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). It is likely that the Golgi-localization motifs (29Cohen J.R. Lin L.D. Machamer C.E. Identification of a Golgi complex-targeting signal in the cytoplasmic tail of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus envelope protein.J. Virol. 2011; 85: 5794-5803Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) in S2-E drive its retrograde trafficking in a way closely related to the mechanism that facilitates E protein perinuclear retention during viral infection. However, we also considered the possibility that amphipol-mediated extracellular delivery of S2-E triggers ER stress and unfolded protein response–related retrograde trafficking, leading to deposition of S2-E in perinuclear aggresomes. Aggresomes are ordered protein aggregates that form following transport of certain proteins along microtubules by dynein to perinuclear microtubule-organizing centers (63Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. Aggresomes: A cellular response to misfolded proteins.J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1794) Google Scholar) and are often detected by the formation of vimentin cages (63Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. Aggresomes: A cellular response to misfolded proteins.J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1794) Google Scholar). We looked but did not observe the induction of vimentin cages with our delivered S2-E (Fig. S16). The lack of aggresome formation suggests that our delivered S2-E does not induce an obvious unfolded protein response stress, likely because the S2-E accumulates in the TGN and not in the ER (64Wileman T. Aggresomes and autophagy generate sites for virus replication.Science. 2006; 312: 875-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 65Prentice E. Jerome W.G. Yoshimori T. Mizushima N. Denison M.R.

Involvement of autophagy in coronavirus replication.Viruses. 2012; 4: 3440-3451Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We did not observe an obvious enrichment of S2-E in the ERGIC or ER compartments before the accumulation in the TGN. However, it is important to note that we focused on identifying the final location of externally delivered S2-E and not its location in earlier time points. In addition, further studies will be required to understand by which pathways S2-E is trafficked from the plasma membrane to the TGN. We have shown that the S2-E protein can be stripped of lipid and detergent and purified into aqueous solutions in which its solubility is maintained solely by complexation with amphipols. The protein can then be delivered to lipid bilayers, in which the protein spontaneously inserts into the membrane to form ion channels. As proposed in Figure 4, addition of the S2-E protein to living human cells results in plasma membrane integration and subsequent retrograde trafficking deep within the cell, ultimately occupying enlarged LAMP1-positive vesicles derived from the TGN, which are believed to be critical for CoV egress and pH dysregulation."

This study was done to determine nutrient mineralization and nutrient release patterns of different combinations or a mix of vermicast-sawdust growing media amended with or without Trichoderma viride (10 5 spores/g). The mixed-media treatments were (1) 80% vermicast+20% sawdust; (2) 60% vermicast+40% sawdust; (3) 40% vermicast+60% sawdust; (4) 20% vermicast+80% sawdust; and (5) sawdust alone (control). Total dissolved solids, electric conductivity and salinity increased with each sampling time following submergence in deionized. Nutrients released from media without T . viride were significantly higher than the corresponding media with added T . viride . Overall, the starting total nitrogen of the different media did not change during the incubation period, but nitrate-nitrogen was reduced to a negligible amount by the end of day 30 of incubation. A repeated measures analysis showed a significant effect of Time* T . viride *Treatment on total dissolved solids. Redundancy analysis demonstrated a positive and strong association between media composed of ≥40% vermicast and ≤60% sawdust with or without T . viride and mineral nutrients released, electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids and salinity. These findings suggest that fast-growing plants may benefit from 40% to 60% vermicast added to 40% to 60% sawdust without T . viride while slow-growing plants can benefit from the same mixed medium combined with the addition of T . viride . Further investigation is underway to assess microbial dynamics in the mixed media and their influence on plant growth."
https://openalex.org/W3180424556,"Following the West African Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak of 2013-2016 and more recent EVD outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of Congo, thousands of EVD survivors are at-risk for sequelae including uveitis, which can lead to unremitting inflammation and vision loss from cataract. Because of the known risk of Ebola virus persistence in ocular fluid and the need to provide vision-restorative, safe cataract surgery, the Ebola Virus Persistence in Ocular Tissues and Fluids (EVICT) Study was implemented in Sierra Leone. During implementation of this multi-national study, challenges included regulatory approvals, mobilization, community engagement, infection prevention and control, and collaboration between multiple disciplines. In this report, we address the multifacted approach to address these challenges and the impact of implementation science research to address an urgent clinical subspecialty need in an outbreak setting.Given the patient care need to develop a protocol to evaluate ocular fluid for Ebola virus RNA persistence prior to cataract surgery, as well as protocols to provide reassurance to ophthalmologists caring for EVD survivors with cataracts, the EVICT study was designed and implemented through the work of the Ministry of Health, Sierra Leone National Eye Programme, and international partnerships. The EVICT study showed that all 50 patients who underwent ocular fluid sampling at 19 and 34 months, respectively, tested negative for Ebola virus RNA. Thirty-four patients underwent successful cataract surgery with visual acuity improvement. Here we describe the methodology for study implementation, challenges encountered, and key issues that impacted EVD vision care in the immediate aftermath of the EVD outbreak. Key aspects of the EVICT study included defining the pertinent questions and clinical need, partnership alignment with key stakeholders, community engagement with EVD survivor associations, in-country and international regulatory approvals, study site design for infection prevention and control, and thorough plans for EVD survivor follow-up care and monitoring. Challenges encountered included patient mobilization owing to transportation routes and distance of patients in rural districts. Strong in-country partnerships and multiple international organizations overcame these challenges so that lessons learned could be applied for future EVD outbreaks in West and Central Africa including EVD outbreaks that are ongoing in Guinea and Democratic Republic of Congo.The EVICT Study showed that cataract surgery with a protocol-driven approach was safe and vision-restorative for EVD survivors, which provided guidance for EVD ophthalmic surgical care. Ophthalmologic care remains a key aspect of the public health response for EVD outbreaks but requires a meticulous, yet partnered approach with international and local in-country partners. Future efforts may build on this framework for clinical care and to improve our understanding of ophthalmic sequelae, develop treatment paradigms for EVD survivors, and strengthen vision health systems in resource-limited settings."
https://openalex.org/W3180601618,"In recent years, many studies have found that mechanical tension can activiate NF-kB signal pathway and NF-kB plays an important role in the process of osteogenesis. However, it is still unclear whether this process exists in the anterior palatal suture expansion. In this paper, we mainly studied the effect of intraperitoneal injection of PDTC on the NF-kB signaling pathway and osteogenesis index of the anterior palatal suture expansion model in young adult rats. The expansion model is grouped and established: 45 male 8-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups, an expansion only (EO) group, an expansion plus PDTC (PE) group, and a control group. The results revealed that PDTC inhibited the activity of NF-kB signaling pathway and promote one morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2), steocalatin (OCN) expression. Compared with the control group, the optical density (OD) value of BMP in the EO group and PE group rats increased significantly from the first day to the seventh day, and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). After 6.0Gy irradiation, PDTC administration group could slightly increase the total SOD level in the liver and serum of rats, and reduce the MDA level in the liver and serum, especially the effect of 60mg/kg and 90mg/kg was the most obvious."
https://openalex.org/W3182793681,"Medical imaging as method to assess the longitudinal process of a SARS-CoV-2 infection in non-human primates is commonly used in research settings. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is regularly used to determine the local virus production and immune effects of SARS-CoV-2 in the lower respiratory tract. However, the potential interference of those two diagnostic modalities is unknown in non-human primates. The current study investigated the effect and duration of BAL on computed tomography (CT) in both healthy and experimentally SARS-CoV-2-infected female rhesus macaques ( Macaca mulatta ). In addition, the effect of subsequent BALs was reviewed. Thorax CTs and BALs were obtained from four healthy animals and 11 experimentally SARS-CoV-2-infected animals. From all animals, CTs were obtained just before BAL, and 24 hours post-BAL. Additionally, from the healthy animals, CTs immediately after, and four hours post-BAL were obtained. Thorax CTs were evaluated for alterations in lung density, measured in Hounsfield units, and a visual semi-quantitative scoring system. An increase in the lung density was observed on the immediately post-BAL CT but resolved within 24 hours in the healthy animals. In the infected animals, a significant difference in both the lung density and CT score was still found 24 hours after BAL. Furthermore, the differences between time points in CT score were increased for the second BAL. These results indicate that the effect of BAL on infected lungs is not resolved within the first 24 hours. Therefore, it is important to acknowledge the interference between BAL and CT in rhesus macaques."
https://openalex.org/W3179340540,"Background Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) is caused by Chlamydia trachomatis strains with ompA genotypes L1 to L3. An LGV epidemic associated with the L2b genotype has emerged in the past few decades amongst men who have sex with men (MSM). C . trachomatis genotypes can be discriminated by outer membrane protein A gene ( ompA ) sequencing, however this method has limited resolution. This study employed a high-resolution genotyping method, namely, multi-locus tandem repeat (VNTR) analysis with ompA sequencing (MLVA- ompA ), to assess the distribution of LGV MLVA- ompA genotypes amongst individuals attending genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinics in London. Methods Clinical specimens were collected from individuals attending eight London-based GUM clinics. Specimens that tested positive for C . trachomatis by commercial nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) were confirmed as LGV by pmpH real-time PCR. LGV-positive DNA extracts were subsequently genotyped using MLVA- ompA . Results Two hundred and thirty DNA extracts were confirmed as LGV, and 162 (70%) yielded complete MLVA- ompA genotypes. Six LGV MLVA- ompA genotypes were identified: 1.9.2b-L2, 1.9.3b-L2b, 1.9.2b-L2b, 1.9.2b-L2b/D, 1.4a.2b-L2b, and 5.9.2b-L1. The following LGV ompA genotypes were identified (in descending order of abundance): L2, L2b, L2b/D, and L1. Eight ompA sequences with the hybrid L2b/D profile were detected. The hybrid sequence was identical to the ompA of a recombinant L2b/D strain detected in Portugal in 2017. Conclusions The L2 ompA genotype was found to predominate in the London study population. The study detected an unusual hybrid L2b/D ompA profile that was previously reported in Portugal. We recommend further monitoring and surveillance of LGV strains within the UK population."
https://openalex.org/W3181892933,"Background and aim Psychological stress has been shown to increase intestinal permeability and is associated with the development of gastrointestinal disorders. This study aimed to investigate skydiving as an alternative model to analyse the effect of acute psychological stress on intestinal barrier function. Materials and methods Twenty healthy subjects participated in a tandem skydive followed by a negative control visit, of which 19 (9 females and 10 males, 25.9 ± 3.7 years) were included in the study. Intestinal permeability was assessed by a multi-sugar urinary recovery test. Sucrose recovery and lactulose/rhamnose ratio in 0-5h urine indicated gastroduodenal and small intestinal permeability, respectively, and sucralose/erythritol ratio in 5-24h urine indicated colonic permeability. Blood samples were taken to assess markers associated with barrier function. This study has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03644979) on August 23, 2018. Results Skydiving resulted in a significant increase in salivary cortisol levels directly after skydiving compared to the control visit. Cortisol levels were still increased two hours after landing, while cortisol levels before skydiving were not significantly different from the baseline at the control visit. Skydiving did not induce a significant increase in gastroduodenal, small intestinal or colonic permeability. There was also no significant increase in plasma intestinal and liver fatty acid-binding proteins, suggesting no damage to the enterocytes. Discussion These results show that the acute intense psychological stress induced by skydiving does not affect intestinal permeability in healthy subjects. Future models aiming to investigate the effect of stress on human intestinal barrier function should consider a more sustained exposure to the psychological stressor."

https://openalex.org/W3178121893,"Patients with urothelial carcinoma (UC) experience gemcitabine resistance is a critical issue. The role of hedgehog pathway in the problem was explored. The expressions of phospho-AKT ser473 , phospho-GSK3β ser9 and Gli2 were up-regulated in gemcitabine-resistant NTUB1 (NGR) cells. Without hedgehog ligands, Gli proteins can be phosphorylated by GSK3β kinase to inhibit their downstream regulations. Furthermore, the GSK3β kinase can be phosphorylated by AKT at its Ser9 residue to become an inactive kinase. Therefore, overexpression of AKT1 , Flag-GSK S9D (constitutively inactive form) or active Gli2 (GLI2ΔN) in NTUB1 cells could activate Gli2 pathway to enhance migration/invasion ability and increase gemcitabine resistance, respectively. Conversely, overexpression of Flag-GSK S9A (constitutively active form) or knockdown of Gli2 could suppress Gli2 pathway, and then reduce gemcitabine resistance in NGR cells. Therefore, we suggest gemcitabine-activated AKT/GSK3β pathway can elicit Gli2 activity, which leads to enhanced migration/invasion ability and resistance to gemcitabine therapy in UC patients. The non-canonical hedgehog pathway should be evaluated in the therapy to benefit UC patients."

Diffusion-weighted imaging with body signal suppression magnetic resonance imaging (DWIBS-MRI) allows for acquisition of whole-body volumetric data without radiation exposure. This study aimed to investigate the usefulness of DWIBS-MRI in plasma-cell neoplasms. We retrospectively analyzed 29 and 8 Japanese patients with multiple myeloma and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, respectively, who underwent DWIBS-MRI. We conducted a histogram analysis of apparent diffusion coefficient values. The correlations between each histogram parameter and staging, cell maturation, prognosis, and treatment response were evaluated. We found that the apparent diffusion coefficient values in patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance were lower than those in patients with multiple myeloma. Pretreatment apparent diffusion coefficient values of immature myeloma were lower than those of mature myeloma. Moreover, these values decreased in proportion to stage progression in Durie-Salmon classification system but showed no significant correlation with other staging systems or prognosis. Patients were stratified as responder, stable, and non-responder based on the International Myeloma Working Group criteria. The magnitude of changes in apparent diffusion coefficients differed significantly between responders and non-responders (0.154 ± 0.386 ×10-3 mm2/s vs. -0.307 ± 0.424 ×10-3 mm2/s, p = 0.003). Although its usefulness has yet to be established, DWIBS-MRI combined with apparent diffusion coefficient measurement allowed for excellent response evaluation in patients with multiple myeloma. Furthermore, apparent diffusion coefficient analysis using DWIBS-MRI may be useful in predicting cell maturation and total tumor volume."

The acceleration threshold was measured by letting the bed oscillate freely until a natural break and asking the patient when he did not perceive any motion. The perception latency was determined by asking the patient to indicate whether the beep and the peak of each oscillation were synchronous. The time lag between sound and peak of the head position was swept from -750 to +750 ms by 50 ms increments.The mean acceleration threshold was 9.2±4.60 cm/s2. The range width of the synchronous perception interval was estimated as 535±190 ms. The point of subjective synchronicity defined as the center of this interval was -195±106 ms (n = 30). The test-retest evaluation in the same trial showed an acceptable reproducibility for the acceleration threshold and good to excellent for all parameters related to sound-movement latency.Swinging bed combined to sound stimulation can provide reproducible information on movement perception in a simple and non-invasive manner with highly reproducible results.

Myosins that function as transporters often form complexes with adaptor proteins and vesicular membranes, making it unclear how they transport their cargo through the actin cytoskeletal network. Rai et al. now use single-molecule kinetics, FRET, and DNA origami scaffolds that mimic motor–adaptor complexes to reveal that the myosin VI-Dab2 complex, which is held together weakly and turns over rapidly, can facilitate processive transport without disruption of the cytoskeleton."
https://openalex.org/W3178984648,"Defaunation is a global threat to biodiversity that can be counteracted through trophic rewilding, a restoration strategy that promotes self-regulating ecosystems through active reintroductions or passive management. In order to estimate success in restoration initiatives, progress of the rewilding projects is measured and monitored. However, a spatially explicit understanding of rewilding and rewilding potential in a rewilding site has been absent so far. We present a novel approach for monitoring rewilding progress that focuses on a spatially explicit estimate of progress and ecological integrity within rewilding initiatives. This framework uses habitat classification of the site and tracking data of the reintroduced animals, to model their habitat selection. Through this we measure and map realized and potential rewilding. We operationalize the framework in an ongoing rewilding project in the Iberá Wetlands, Corrientes, Argentina. The majority of areas (76%) predicted to be occupied by reintroduced fauna were only predicted to be selected by one species. Of the four species in the rewilding project, only the giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla) filled the majority of its potential distribution, whereas pampas deer (Ozotoceros bezoarticus), collared peccary (Pecari tajacu) and lowland tapir (Tapirus terrestris) filled less than 23% of theirs. After rewilding we found a 10% increase in the proportion of the study area with high ecological integrity. Through this case study, we showed that this framework can be used to assess the spatial progress of a rewilding site. By incorporating wildlife tracking and satellite-based remote sensing, we are integrating a spatial component to monitoring of rewilding projects that should lead to more detailed understanding of the progress of rewilding. Applying this framework would facilitate decision-making for practitioners and inform species management plans."
https://openalex.org/W3181699092,"In soybean variety development and genetic improvement projects, iron deficiency chlorosis (IDC) is visually assessed as an ordinal response variable. Linear Mixed Models for Genomic Prediction (GP) have been developed, compared, and used to select continuous plant traits such as yield, height, and maturity, but can be inappropriate for ordinal traits. Generalized Linear Mixed Models have been developed for GP of ordinal response variables. However, neither approach addresses the most important questions for cultivar development and genetic improvement: How frequently are the 'wrong' genotypes retained, and how often are the 'correct' genotypes discarded? The research objective reported herein was to compare outcomes from four data modeling and six algorithmic modeling GP methods applied to IDC using decision metrics appropriate for variety development and genetic improvement projects. Appropriate metrics for decision making consist of specificity, sensitivity, precision, decision accuracy, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Data modeling methods for GP included ridge regression, logistic regression, penalized logistic regression, and Bayesian generalized linear regression. Algorithmic modeling methods include Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machine, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naïve Bayes, and Artificial Neural Network. We found that a Support Vector Machine model provided the most specific decisions of correctly discarding IDC susceptible genotypes, while a Random Forest model resulted in the best decisions of retaining IDC tolerant genotypes, as well as the best outcomes when considering all decision metrics. Overall, the predictions from algorithmic modeling result in better decisions than from data modeling methods applied to soybean IDC."

Full-Text PDF Open Access There are more than a hundred species of Plasmodium, protozoan blood parasites that infect vertebrates. The parasite Plasmodium falciparum is transmitted to humans through the bite of a female Anopheles mosquito and causes the most dangerous form of malaria. The emergence of drug-resistant parasites has beleaguered efforts to eradicate malaria. The approach of combination drug therapy, a widely practiced countermeasure to deal with the emergence of resistant organisms, has been used against P. falciparum in an attempt to block resistance. However, the parasite is resistant to nearly all current therapies, including the currently WHO-recommended combination-based approach based on artemisinin (1Guidelines for the Treatment of Malaria. 3rd Ed. World Health Organization, Geneva2015Google Scholar). P. falciparum parasites are purine auxotrophs and salvage purines via a pathway in which its purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PfPNP) has an essential role in breaking down inosine scavenged from the host to form the purine precursor hypoxanthine. In 2004, an extensive study of the transition state of inosine cleavage by PfPNP using kinetic isotope effects was carried out (2Lewandowicz A. Schramm V.L. Transition state analysis for human and Plasmodium falciparum purine nucleoside phosphorylases.Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 1458-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Analysis of the data indicated PfPNP catalysis goes through a highly dissociative, SN1-like transition state, which led to the design of a transition state analog, 4’-Deaza-1’- Aza-2’-Deoxy-1’-(9-Methylene)-Immucillin-G (DADMe-ImmG). The compound is a picomolar inhibitor of PfPNP, and crystal structures of the enzyme–inhibitor complex (PDB ID: 3PHC) revealed how it binds more tightly than the substrate inosine (PDB ID: 2BSX) (3Schnick C.

Crystallogr. 2005; 61: 1245-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Subsequently, it was shown that P. falciparum infections in a primate malaria model could be cleared by oral administration of DADMe-ImmG (4Cassera M.B. Hazleton K.Z. Merino E.F. Obaldia 3rd, N.

Plasmodium falciparum parasites are killed by a transition state analogue of purine nucleoside phosphorylase in a primate animal model.PLoS One. 2011; 6e26916Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). It had been assumed that a transition state analog inhibitor would limit the development of resistance because mutations that disrupt the inhibitor function should also disrupt catalysis, but whether this holds true in the complicated biological milieu has not been established. A previous study reported findings from resistance selection experiments after 3 years of continuous drug pressure (5Ducati R.G. Namanja-Magliano H.A. Harijan R.K. Fajardo J.E. Fiser A. Daily J.P. Schramm V.L. Genetic resistance to purine nucleoside phosphorylase inhibition in Plasmodium falciparum.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2018; 115: 2114-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The results revealed the parasite’s version of combination-based “therapy”, synergistically allying targeted gene amplification with a point mutation presumed to provide functional resistance. Genomic sequencing of resistant organisms showed the presence of the M183L mutation in about one-half of the sequences read, the other half being WT PfPNP copies. Unexpectedly, the purified enzyme containing the M183L mutation was severely compromised, with catalytic efficiency too low to support parasite survivability. So what was the advantage provided by the evolved mutant? Minnow et al. (6Minnow Y.V.T. Harijan R.K. Schramm V.L. A resistant mutant of Plasmodium falciparum purine nucleoside phosphorylase uses wild-type neighbors to maintain parasite survival.J. Biol. Chem. 2021; 296: 100342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) noted two additional aspects of PfPNP that could factor in. First, PfPNP functions as a hexamer, consisting of a trimer of dimers. Second, a crystal structure (5Ducati R.G. Namanja-Magliano H.A. Harijan R.K. Fajardo J.E. Fiser A. Daily J.P. Schramm V.L. Genetic resistance to purine nucleoside phosphorylase inhibition in Plasmodium falciparum.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2018; 115: 2114-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) indicated that Met183 resides between the catalytic site and the subunit interface, and the mutation allows the side chain of Tyr160 to enter the active site and hinder substrate binding. These observations led to the hypothesis that the resistant organism might utilize a hybrid form of PfPNP with a combination of the mutant and native subunits (Fig. 1). The authors tested their proposal by engineering a fusion protein composed of native and M183L mutant subunits joined with a short peptide linker. The kinetic properties of the mutant/native fusion protein were characterized and compared with native PfPNP, using a tethered version of the native enzyme as a control for effects of the peptide linkers. Although native PfPNP has a high catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM) of 3.5 × 105 M−1s−1, fully mutated M183L PfPNP is functionally inert—its KM value is increased, and the kcat is decreased compared with the WT, resulting in a 17,000-fold decrease in catalytic efficiency. The binding of the DADMe-ImmG transition state analog is also weaker; its dissociation constant increases from 670 pM in native PfPNP to 26 μM in the M183L variant. Thus, although the mutation weakens inhibition, the enzyme is also too weak a catalyst for survival of the organism. However, the catalytic efficiency of the fused hybrid composed of alternating native and M183L subunits is only 9-fold lower than the native fused enzyme, with a similar increase in its Ki for DADMe-ImmG, confirming the notion that affinity for a transition state analog should track inhibition of catalysis. The kinetics of inhibition are also altered in the hybrid: with native PfPNP, the inhibitor induces a slow-onset isomerization process leading to the formation of a tightly bound enzyme–inhibitor complex while the hybrid enzyme exhibits a much shorter slow-onset phase. The authors also tested the effect of a slightly longer peptide linker and the insertion of a protease cleavage site to release the fusion and more accurately represent the cellular assembly. A PAGE gel analysis of the cleaved construct suggested it has the same hexameric structure as the native enzyme; removal of the linkers modestly increased the kinetics of both the native and mutant enzymes. These data, combined with a 12-fold gene amplification found in the resistant organisms, reveal a combination of countermeasures that restores the catalytic capacity for purine salvage to a level comparable with that in the WT parasite. Although this is not the first example of an organism developing resistance using a combination of strategies, the usage of mixed-subunit hybrid hexamers to productively implement an otherwise fatal mutation is unusual. The authors point out that although the typical malaria treatment period lasts from days to weeks, it is far shorter than the 3 years needed for the resistance strategy to develop and conclude that the likelihood of such resistance developing in the field is very low. These findings remind us, however, of the relentlessness of microorganisms to evolve ways to survive under pressure. This combination of mutation, hybridization, and gene duplication to combat a drug was akin to picking a winning combination in the lottery. There are two ways to better one’s odds in a lottery: play it long enough or play it with more numbers. Although incubation times will be shorter in the field, the number of “incubators,” patients undergoing treatment, is large. These results have obvious implications for the present pandemic and warn us that humans do not own the natural world intellectual property rights for combination therapy. The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest with the contents of this article."

Based on the airflow distribution characteristics from fluid dynamics, sequential measurement and correction is proposed as a method of measuring wind direction. In addition, a wind velocity and direction measurement instrument was developed using the above-mentioned approaches. The test results showed that the proposed instrument can obtain large dynamic wind velocity measurements from 0 to 60 m/s. The wind velocity measurement accuracy was ±0.5 m/s in the common velocity range of 0–20 m/s and ±1 m/s in the high velocity range of 20–60 m/s. The wind direction accuracy was ±3° throughout the 360° range. The proposed approaches and instrument are not only practical but also capable of meeting the requirements of wide-range and large dynamic wind vector measurement applications."
https://openalex.org/W3180921635,"During development, homeostasis, and disease, organisms must balance responses that allow adaptation to low oxygen (hypoxia) with those that protect cells from oxidative stress. The evolutionarily conserved hypoxia-inducible factors are central to these processes, as they orchestrate transcriptional responses to oxygen deprivation. Here, we employ genetic strategies in C. elegans to identify stress-responsive genes and pathways that modulate the HIF-1 hypoxia-inducible factor and facilitate oxygen homeostasis. Through a genome-wide RNAi screen, we show that RNAi-mediated mitochondrial or proteasomal dysfunction increases the expression of hypoxia-responsive reporter Pnhr-57::GFP in C. elegans. Interestingly, only a subset of these effects requires hif-1. Of particular importance, we found that skn-1 RNAi increases the expression of hypoxia-responsive reporter Pnhr-57::GFP and elevates HIF-1 protein levels. The SKN-1/NRF transcription factor has been shown to promote oxidative stress resistance. We present evidence that the crosstalk between HIF-1 and SKN-1 is mediated by EGL-9, the prolyl hydroxylase that targets HIF-1 for oxygen-dependent degradation. Treatment that induces SKN-1, such as heat or gsk-3 RNAi, increases expression of a Pegl-9::GFP reporter, and this effect requires skn-1 function and a putative SKN-1 binding site in egl-9 regulatory sequences. Collectively, these data support a model in which SKN-1 promotes egl-9 transcription, thereby inhibiting HIF-1. We propose that this interaction enables animals to adapt quickly to changes in cellular oxygenation and to better survive accompanying oxidative stress."
