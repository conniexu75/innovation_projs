https://openalex.org/W3189985782,"Immune correlates of protection can be used as surrogate endpoints for vaccine efficacy. Here, nonhuman primates (NHPs) received either no vaccine or doses ranging from 0.3 to 100 μg of the mRNA-1273 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine. mRNA-1273 vaccination elicited circulating and mucosal antibody responses in a dose-dependent manner. Viral replication was significantly reduced in bronchoalveolar lavages and nasal swabs after SARS-CoV-2 challenge in vaccinated animals and most strongly correlated with levels of anti–S antibody and neutralizing activity. Lower antibody levels were needed for reduction of viral replication in the lower airway than in the upper airway. Passive transfer of mRNA-1273–induced immunoglobulin G to naïve hamsters was sufficient to mediate protection. Thus, mRNA-1273 vaccine–induced humoral immune responses are a mechanistic correlate of protection against SARS-CoV-2 in NHPs."
https://openalex.org/W3199230945,"Conventional understanding has it that a liquid deposited on a surface tends to move along directions that reduce surface energy, which is mainly dictated by surface properties rather than liquid properties, such as surface tension. Achieving well-controlled directional steering remains challenging because the liquid-solid interaction mainly occurs in the two-dimensional (2D) domain. We show that the spreading direction of liquids with different surface tensions can be tailored by designing 3D capillary ratchets that create an asymmetric and 3D spreading profile both in and out of the surface plane. Such directional steering is also accompanied by self-propulsion and high flow velocity, all of which are preferred in liquid transport."
https://openalex.org/W3199565759,"Despite contributing to healthy diets for billions of people, aquatic foods are often undervalued as a nutritional solution because their diversity is often reduced to the protein and energy value of a single food type ('seafood' or 'fish')1-4. Here we create a cohesive model that unites terrestrial foods with nearly 3,000 taxa of aquatic foods to understand the future impact of aquatic foods on human nutrition. We project two plausible futures to 2030: a baseline scenario with moderate growth in aquatic animal-source food (AASF) production, and a high-production scenario with a 15-million-tonne increased supply of AASFs over the business-as-usual scenario in 2030, driven largely by investment and innovation in aquaculture production. By comparing changes in AASF consumption between the scenarios, we elucidate geographic and demographic vulnerabilities and estimate health impacts from diet-related causes. Globally, we find that a high-production scenario will decrease AASF prices by 26% and increase their consumption, thereby reducing the consumption of red and processed meats that can lead to diet-related non-communicable diseases5,6 while also preventing approximately 166 million cases of inadequate micronutrient intake. This finding provides a broad evidentiary basis for policy makers and development stakeholders to capitalize on the potential of aquatic foods to reduce food and nutrition insecurity and tackle malnutrition in all its forms."
https://openalex.org/W3199944054,"Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) can directly convert the chemical energy stored in organic matter to electricity and are of considerable interest for power generation and wastewater treatment. However, the current MFCs typically exhibit unsatisfactorily low power densities that are largely limited by the sluggish transmembrane and extracellular electron-transfer processes. Here, we report a rational strategy to boost the charge-extraction efficiency in Shewanella MFCs substantially by introducing transmembrane and outer-membrane silver nanoparticles. The resulting Shewanella-silver MFCs deliver a maximum current density of 3.85 milliamperes per square centimeter, power density of 0.66 milliwatts per square centimeter, and single-cell turnover frequency of 8.6 × 105 per second, which are all considerably higher than those of the best MFCs reported to date. Additionally, the hybrid MFCs feature an excellent fuel-utilization efficiency, with a coulombic efficiency of 81%."
https://openalex.org/W3200380640,"Nanostructured metals are usually strong because the ultrahigh density of internal boundaries restricts the mean free path of dislocations. Usually, they are also more brittle because of their diminished work-hardening ability. Nanotwinned materials, with coherent interfaces of mirror symmetry, can overcome this inherent trade-off. We show a bulk nanostructuring method that produces a multiscale, hierarchical twin architecture in a hexagonal closed-packed, solute-free, and coarse-grained titanium (Ti), with a substantial enhancement of tensile strength and ductility. Pure Ti achieved an ultimate tensile strength of almost 2 gigapascals and a true failure strain close to 100% at 77 kelvin. The multiscale twin structures are thermally stable up to 873 kelvin, which is above the critical temperature for many applications in extreme environments. Our results demonstrate a practical route to achieve attractive mechanical properties in Ti without involving exotic and often expensive alloying elements."
https://openalex.org/W3199702860,"Seven years after the declaration of the first epidemic of Ebola virus disease in Guinea, the country faced a new outbreak—between 14 February and 19 June 2021—near the epicentre of the previous epidemic1,2. Here we use next-generation sequencing to generate complete or near-complete genomes of Zaire ebolavirus from samples obtained from 12 different patients. These genomes form a well-supported phylogenetic cluster with genomes from the previous outbreak, which indicates that the new outbreak was not the result of a new spillover event from an animal reservoir. The 2021 lineage shows considerably lower divergence than would be expected during sustained human-to-human transmission, which suggests a persistent infection with reduced replication or a period of latency. The resurgence of Zaire ebolavirus from humans five years after the end of the previous outbreak of Ebola virus disease reinforces the need for long-term medical and social care for patients who survive the disease, to reduce the risk of re-emergence and to prevent further stigmatization. The viral lineage responsible for the February 2021 outbreak of Ebola virus disease in Guinea is nested within a clade that predominantly consists of genomes sampled during the 2013–2016 epidemic, suggesting that the virus might have re-emerged after a long period of latency within a previously infected individual."
https://openalex.org/W3200323540,"Inflammation is a major risk factor for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). When occurring in the context of pancreatitis, KRAS mutations accelerate tumor development in mouse models. We report that long after its complete resolution, a transient inflammatory event primes pancreatic epithelial cells to subsequent transformation by oncogenic KRAS. Upon recovery from acute inflammation, pancreatic epithelial cells display an enduring adaptive response associated with sustained transcriptional and epigenetic reprogramming. Such adaptation enables the reactivation of acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM) upon subsequent inflammatory events, thereby limiting tissue damage through a rapid decrease of zymogen production. We propose that because activating mutations of KRAS maintain an irreversible ADM, they may be beneficial and under strong positive selection in the context of recurrent pancreatitis."
https://openalex.org/W3199631386,"Zeolites are versatile catalysts and molecular sieves with large topological diversity, but managing phase competition in zeolite synthesis is an empirical, labor-intensive task. In this work, we controlled phase selectivity in templated zeolite synthesis from first principles by combining high-throughput atomistic simulations, literature mining, human-computer interaction, synthesis, and characterization. Proposed binding metrics distilled from more than 586,000 zeolite-molecule simulations reproduced the extracted literature and rationalized framework competition in the design of organic structure-directing agents. Energetic, geometric, and electrostatic descriptors of template molecules were found to regulate synthetic accessibility windows and aluminum distributions in pure-phase zeolites. Furthermore, these parameters allowed us to realize an intergrowth zeolite through a single bi-selective template. The computation-first approach enables control of both zeolite synthesis and structure composition using a priori theoretical descriptors."
https://openalex.org/W3201651407,"Adoptive transfer of antigen-specific T cells represents a major advance in cancer immunotherapy, with robust clinical outcomes in some patients1. Both the number of transferred T cells and their differentiation state are critical determinants of effective responses2,3. T cells can be expanded with T cell receptor (TCR)-mediated stimulation and interleukin-2, but this can lead to differentiation into effector T cells4,5 and lower therapeutic efficacy6, whereas maintenance of a more stem-cell-like state before adoptive transfer is beneficial7. Here we show that H9T, an engineered interleukin-2 partial agonist, promotes the expansion of CD8+ T cells without driving terminal differentiation. H9T led to altered STAT5 signalling and mediated distinctive downstream transcriptional, epigenetic and metabolic programs. In addition, H9T treatment sustained the expression of T cell transcription factor 1 (TCF-1) and promoted mitochondrial fitness, thereby facilitating the maintenance of a stem-cell-like state. Moreover, TCR-transgenic and chimeric antigen receptor-modified CD8+ T cells that were expanded with H9T showed robust anti-tumour activity in vivo in mouse models of melanoma and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Thus, engineering cytokine variants with distinctive properties is a promising strategy for creating new molecules with translational potential. H9T, an engineered IL-2 partial agonist, promotes the expansion of T cells while maintaining a stem-cell-like state, leading to improved efficacy of adoptive cell therapy in mouse models of melanoma and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia."
https://openalex.org/W3201390648,"During tumorigenesis, tumors must evolve to evade the immune system and do so by disrupting the genes involved in antigen processing and presentation or up-regulating inhibitory immune checkpoint genes. We performed in vivo CRISPR screens in syngeneic mouse tumor models to examine requirements for tumorigenesis both with and without adaptive immune selective pressure. In each tumor type tested, we found a marked enrichment for the loss of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) in the presence of an adaptive immune system relative to immunocompromised mice. Nearly one-third of TSGs showed preferential enrichment, often in a cancer- and tissue-specific manner. These results suggest that clonal selection of recurrent mutations found in cancer is driven largely by the tumor’s requirement to avoid the adaptive immune system."
https://openalex.org/W3199909334,"Transcription-coupled DNA repair removes bulky DNA lesions from the genome1,2 and protects cells against ultraviolet (UV) irradiation3. Transcription-coupled DNA repair begins when RNA polymerase II (Pol II) stalls at a DNA lesion and recruits the Cockayne syndrome protein CSB, the E3 ubiquitin ligase, CRL4CSA and UV-stimulated scaffold protein A (UVSSA)3. Here we provide five high-resolution structures of Pol II transcription complexes containing human transcription-coupled DNA repair factors and the elongation factors PAF1 complex (PAF) and SPT6. Together with biochemical and published3,4 data, the structures provide a model for transcription-repair coupling. Stalling of Pol II at a DNA lesion triggers replacement of the elongation factor DSIF by CSB, which binds to PAF and moves upstream DNA to SPT6. The resulting elongation complex, ECTCR, uses the CSA-stimulated translocase activity of CSB to pull on upstream DNA and push Pol II forward. If the lesion cannot be bypassed, CRL4CSA spans over the Pol II clamp and ubiquitylates the RPB1 residue K1268, enabling recruitment of TFIIH to UVSSA and DNA repair. Conformational changes in CRL4CSA lead to ubiquitylation of CSB and to release of transcription-coupled DNA repair factors before transcription may continue over repaired DNA."
https://openalex.org/W3199687825,"Vitamin A and its derivative retinol are essential for the development of intestinal adaptive immunity. Retinoic acid (RA)–producing myeloid cells are central to this process, but how myeloid cells acquire retinol for conversion to RA is unknown. Here, we show that serum amyloid A (SAA) proteins—retinol-binding proteins induced in intestinal epithelial cells by the microbiota—deliver retinol to myeloid cells. We identify low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor–related protein 1 (LRP1) as an SAA receptor that endocytoses SAA-retinol complexes and promotes retinol acquisition by RA-producing intestinal myeloid cells. Consequently, SAA and LRP1 are essential for vitamin A–dependent immunity, including B and T cell homing to the intestine and immunoglobulin A production. Our findings identify a key mechanism by which vitamin A promotes intestinal immunity."
https://openalex.org/W3200327268,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a causal agent of chronic liver disease, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in humans, and afflicts more than 70 million people worldwide. The HCV envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2 are responsible for the binding of the virus to the host cell, but the exact entry process remains undetermined1. The majority of broadly neutralizing antibodies block interaction between HCV E2 and the large extracellular loop (LEL) of the cellular receptor CD81 (CD81-LEL)2. Here we show that low pH enhances the binding of CD81-LEL to E2, and we determine the crystal structure of E2 in complex with an antigen-binding fragment (2A12) and CD81-LEL (E2-2A12-CD81-LEL); E2 in complex with 2A12 (E2-2A12); and CD81-LEL alone. After binding CD81, residues 418-422 in E2 are displaced, which allows for the extension of an internal loop consisting of residues 520-539. Docking of the E2-CD81-LEL complex onto a membrane-embedded, full-length CD81 places the residues Tyr529 and Trp531 of E2 proximal to the membrane. Liposome flotation assays show that low pH and CD81-LEL increase the interaction of E2 with membranes, whereas structure-based mutants of Tyr529, Trp531 and Ile422 in the amino terminus of E2 abolish membrane binding. These data support a model in which acidification and receptor binding result in a conformational change in E2 in preparation for membrane fusion."
https://openalex.org/W3200480720,"The present study was performed to evaluate the effects of seed priming. This was done by soaking the seeds of two rapeseed cultivars, namely, ZY15 (tolerant to low temperature and drought) and HY49 (sensitive to low temperature and drought), for 12 h in varying solutions: distilled water, 138 mg/L salicylic acid (SA), 300 mg/L gibberellic acid (GA), 89.4 mg/L sodium nitroprusside (SNP), 3000 mg/L calcium chloride (CaCl 2 ), and 30 mg/L abscisic acid (ABA). Primed and non-primed seeds were left to germinate at 15°C and -0.15 MPa (T 15 W 15 ) and at 25°C and 0 MPa (T 25 W 0 ), respectively. The results showed that SA, GA, SNP, CaCl 2 , and ABA significantly improved the germination potential (GP), germination rate (GR), germination index (GI), stem fresh weight (SFW), stem dry weight (SDW), root length (RL), stem length (SL), and seed vigor index (SVI) under T 15 W 15 . For ZY15 seeds under T 25 W 0 , GA, SNP, CaCl 2 , and ABA priming reduced the average germination time (96% after 5 days) compared to that of the control (88% after 5 days). For ZY15 seeds under T 15 W 15 , SA, SNP, CaCl 2 , and ABA priming, with respect to the control and water-treated groups, shortened the average germination time (92% after 5 days) compared to that of the control (80% after 5 days). For HY49 seeds under T 25 W 0 , GA, SNP, CaCl 2 , and ABA priming reduced the average germination time (92% after 5 days) compared to that of the control (85% after 5 days). Similarly, for HY49 seeds under T 15 W 15 , GA priming shortened the average germination time (89% after 5 days) compared to that of the control (83% after 5 days). These priming agents increased the net photosynthesis, stomatal conductivity, and transpiration rate of rape seedlings under conditions of low temperature and drought stress, while also decreasing intercellular carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) concentrations. Additionally, SA, GA, SNP, CaCl 2 , and ABA increased superoxide dismutase concentrations (SOD) and ascorbic peroxidase (APX) activities of rape seedlings under stress conditions, while decreasing catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POD) activities in ZY15 seedlings. In HY49, which is sensitive to low temperature and drought, all priming solutions, except for SNP, led to an increase in SOD activity levels and a decrease in CAT activity levels. Overall, SA, GA, SNP, and CaCl 2 increased the concentrations of indoleacetic acid (IAA), GA, ABA, and cytokinin (CTK) in seedlings under stress conditions. Moreover, compared to SA, CaCl 2 , and ABA, GA (300 mg/L) and SNP (300 mol/L) showed improved priming effects for ZY15 and HY49 under stress conditions."

https://openalex.org/W3198943098,"Background Hospitalization of patients infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have remained considerable worldwide. Patients often develop severe complications and have high mortality rates. The cycle threshold (Ct) value derived from nasopharyngeal swab samples using real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) may be a useful prognostic marker in hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, however, its role in predicting the course of the pandemic has not been evaluated thus far. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study which included all patients who had a nasopharyngeal sample positive for SARS-CoV-2 between April 4 –June 5, 2020. The Ct value was used to estimate the number of viral particles in a patient sample. The trend in initial viral load on admission on a population level was evaluated. Moreover, patient characteristics and outcomes stratified by viral load categories were compared and initial viral load was assessed as an independent predictor of intubation and in-hospital mortality. Results A total of 461 hospitalized patients met the inclusion criteria. This study consisted predominantly of acutely infected patients with a median of 4 days since symptom onset to PCR. As the severity of the pandemic eased, there was an increase in the percentage of samples in the low initial viral load category, coinciding with a decrease in deaths. Compared to an initial low viral load, a high initial viral load was an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality (OR 5.5, CI 3.1–9.7, p &lt; 0.001) and intubation (OR 1.82 CI 1.07–3.11, p = 0.03), while an initial intermediate viral load was associated with increased risk of inpatient mortality (OR 1.9, CI 1.14–3.21, p = 0.015) but not with increased risk for intubation. Conclusion The Ct value obtained from nasopharyngeal samples of hospitalized patients on admission may serve as a prognostic marker at an individual level and may help predict the course of the pandemic when evaluated at a population level."
https://openalex.org/W3200284485,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths worldwide1. Studies in human tissues and in mouse models have suggested that for many cancers, stem cells sustain early mutations driving tumour development2,3. For the pancreas, however, mechanisms underlying cellular renewal and initiation of PDAC remain unresolved. Here, using lineage tracing from the endogenous telomerase reverse transcriptase (Tert) locus, we identify a rare TERT-positive subpopulation of pancreatic acinar cells dispersed throughout the exocrine compartment. During homeostasis, these TERThigh acinar cells renew the pancreas by forming expanding clones of acinar cells, whereas randomly marked acinar cells do not form these clones. Specific expression of mutant Kras in TERThigh acinar cells accelerates acinar clone formation and causes transdifferentiation to ductal pre-invasive pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasms by upregulating Ras-MAPK signalling and activating the downstream kinase ERK (phospho-ERK). In resected human pancreatic neoplasms, we find that foci of phospho-ERK-positive acinar cells are common and frequently contain activating KRAS mutations, suggesting that these acinar regions represent an early cancer precursor lesion. These data support a model in which rare TERThigh acinar cells may sustain KRAS mutations, driving acinar cell expansion and creating a field of aberrant cells initiating pancreatic tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W3199571445,"Weakly interacting Bose gases usually form Bose-Einstein condensates in which most particles occupy the same single-particle state. However, when this state cannot realize a continuous symmetry of the many-body Hamiltonian, a fragmented condensate exhibiting the expected symmetry may emerge. Here, we produced a three-fragment condensate for a mesoscopic spin-1 gas of about 100 atoms, with anti-ferromagnetic interactions and vanishing collective spin. Using a spin-resolved detection approaching single-atom resolution, we show that the reconstructed state is close to the expected many-body ground state, whereas one-body observables are the same as for a completely mixed state. Our results highlight how the interplay between symmetry and interactions generates entanglement in a mesoscopic quantum system."
https://openalex.org/W3201156205,"Introduction Our pilot study aimed to evaluate the role of local impedance drop in lesion formation during pulmonary vein isolation with a novel contact force sensing ablation catheter that records local impedance as well and to find a local impedance cut-off value that predicts successful lesion formation. Materials and methods After completing point-by-point radiofrequency pulmonary vein isolation, the success of the applications was evaluated by pacing along the ablation line at 10 mA, 2 ms pulse width. Lesions were considered successful if loss of local capture was achieved. Results Out of 645 applications, 561 were successful and 84 were unsuccessful. Compared to the unsuccessful ablation points, the successful applications were shorter (p = 0.0429) and had a larger local impedance drop (p&lt;0.0001). There was no difference between successful and unsuccessful applications in terms of mean contact force (p = 0.8571), force-time integral (p = 0.0699) and contact force range (p = 0.0519). The optimal cut-point for the local impedance drop indicating successful lesion formation was 21.80 Ohms on the anterior wall [AUC = 0.80 (0.75–0.86), p&lt;0.0001], and 18.30 Ohms on the posterior wall [AUC = 0.77 (0.72–0.83), p&lt;0.0001]. A local impedance drop larger than 21.80 Ohms on the anterior wall and 18.30 Ohms on the posterior wall was associated with an increased probability of effective lesion creation [OR = 11.21, 95%CI 4.22–29.81, p&lt;0.0001; and OR = 7.91, 95%CI 3.77–16.57, p&lt;0.0001, respectively]. Conclusion The measurement of the local impedance may predict optimal lesion formation. A local impedance drop &gt; 21.80 Ohms on the anterior wall and &gt; 18.30 Ohms on the posterior wall significantly increases the probability of creating a successful lesion."

Leslie et al . analyzed the temporal pattern of this increase in a study of fossil and extant land plants across the entire paleontological record. Reproductive complexity increased in two widely separated pulses corresponding to key innovations in reproductive biology: the origin of seeds in the very late Devonian and the origin of flowering plants in the mid-Cretaceous almost 250 million years later. After the origin of flowers, there was a rapid expansion in the morphological complexity of flowering plants. In contrast to many aspects of animal morphological diversity, which expanded early in evolutionary history, most complexity in plants was achieved relatively late. —AMS"
https://openalex.org/W3200064716,"By adopting the 2009 ""pesticide package,"" the EU proposed a common approach to limiting the harmful effects of pesticides, promoting Integrated Pest Management, and the progressive replacement of the most dangerous pesticides with low-risk alternatives through a comprehensive but flexible framework for all EU Member States. Each EU Member State had to develop a National Action Plan that would propose measures to achieve the package's goals. Nevertheless, the choice of actions and indicators remained to be established at the national level. A series of recent evaluations of how Directive 2009/128/EC of the European Parliament and the Council on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides Directive (SUD), a central piece of the ""pesticide package,"" was implemented showed limited success in achieving its goals. Aiming to explain these failures, we compare the National Action Plans eight EU Member States adopted after the SUD. We assess the degree to which the countries' proposed measures and indicators would achieve the Directive's three overarching objectives (reduce risks and impact; promote Integrated Pest Management; promote approaches and techniques to reduce reliance on pesticides). We develop the comparative analysis along three dimensions: the promotion of measures to achieve SUD's three goals; the evolution of the pre-and post-Directive action plans of some of the old EU Member States; and the differences between old and the new EU Member States. The comparison along ten variables shows that the SUD had a minimal effect in homogenizing different states' approaches to develop their National Action Plans to systematically treat problems, propose measures, and timetables for implementation and indicators. Given that the overall effect in generating a common EU approach to raise the sustainability of pesticide use and agriculture, in general, was still limited, as no common measures, indicators, or process to planning were identified, we discuss some suggestions to improve the situation."
https://openalex.org/W3200926007,"Theileria annulata is a tick-borne hemoprotozoan parasite responsible for tropical theileriosis in the bovine population, which causes substantial economic losses to the livestock sector. The present study has investigated, characterized, and shaped epidemiologic and phylogenetic profiles of T. annulata infection in the cattle population of central Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. A total of 600 blood samples were collected from cattle. Microscopy and PCR (18S rRNA taxonomic marker) assays were performed to detect T. annulata infection in cattle from the study area. The overall relative prevalence rates of T. annulata in the examined cattle population were 12.8% (microscopy) and 23.7% (PCR). District-wise analysis (microscopy/PCR) showed that cattle from district Mardan were found more infected (16.0%/28.0%), as compared to cattle from district Charsadda (13.5%/25.5%) and district Peshawar (9.0%/17.5%). Based on host demographic and ecological parameters analysis, theileriosis was found to be higher in young, female, crossbred, freely grazing, tick-infested, and irregular/no acaricides treated cattle. The univariate logistic analysis showed that host age, tick infestation, acaricides use, and feeding method were significant risk factors (P<0.05) whereas multivariate analysis indicated that host age, gender, tick infestation, acaricidal application, and feeding method were potential risk factors (P<0.05) for tropical theileriosis in the cattle population. Phylogenetic and sequence analysis showed that T. annulata 18S rRNA isolates shared homology and phylogeny with other isolates from Asia and Europe. This study has addressed the epidemiology and phylogeny of T. annulata circulating in bovid in the study area where gaps were still present. These findings will serve as a baseline and will facilitate future large-scale epidemiological investigations on tropical theileriosis in the cattle population at a national level."
https://openalex.org/W3199711488,"Objective To determine if maternal plasma CRH and preterm birth history were associated with recurrent preterm birth risk in a high-risk cohort. Study design Secondary analysis of pregnant women with a prior preterm birth ≤35 weeks receiving 17-alpha hydroxyprogesterone caproate for the prevention of recurrent spontaneous preterm birth. All women with a 24-week blood sample were included. Maternal plasma CRH level at 24- and 32-weeks’ gestation was measured using both enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and extracted radioimmunoassay (RIA) technologies. The primary outcome was spontaneous preterm birth &lt;37 weeks. The association of CRH, prior preterm birth history, and the two combined was assessed in relation to recurrent preterm birth risk. Results Recurrent preterm birth in this cohort of 169 women was 24.9%. Comparing women who subsequently delivered &lt;37 versus ≥37 weeks, mean levels of CRH measured by RIA were significantly different at 24 weeks (111.1±87.5 vs. 66.1±45.4 pg/mL, P = .002) and 32 weeks (440.9±275.6 vs. 280.2±214.5 pg/mL, P = .003). The area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) at 24 and 32 weeks for (1) CRH level was 0.68 (95% CI 0.59–0.78) and 0.70 (95% CI 0.59–0.81), (2) prior preterm birth history was 0.75 (95% CI 0.67–0.83) and 0.78 (95% CI 0.69–0.87), and (3) combined was 0.81 (95% CI 0.73–0.88, P = .001) and 0.81 (95% CI 0.72–0.90, P = .01) respectively for delivery &lt;37 weeks. CRH measured by ELISA failed to correlate with gestational age or other clinical parameters. Conclusion In women with a prior preterm birth, CRH levels were higher and had an earlier rise in women who experienced recurrent preterm birth. Second trimester CRH may be useful in identifying a sub-group of women with preterm birth due to early activation of the placenta-fetal adrenal axis. Assay methodology is a variable that contributes to difficulties in reproducibility of CRH levels in the obstetric literature."
https://openalex.org/W3201182526,"The evaluation of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-induced motor evoked potentials (MEPs) promises valuable information about fundamental brain related mechanisms and may serve as a diagnostic tool for clinical monitoring of therapeutic progress or surgery procedures. However, reports about spontaneous fluctuations of MEP amplitudes causing high intra-individual variability have led to increased concerns about the reliability of this measure. One possible cause for high variability of MEPs could be neuronal oscillatory activity, which reflects fluctuations of membrane potentials that systematically increase and decrease the excitability of neuronal networks. Here, we investigate the dependence of MEP amplitude on oscillation power and phase by combining the application of single pulse TMS over the primary motor cortex with concurrent recordings of electromyography and electroencephalography. Our results show that MEP amplitude is correlated to alpha phase, alpha power as well as beta phase. These findings may help explain corticospinal excitability fluctuations by highlighting the modulatory effect of alpha and beta phase on MEPs. In the future, controlling for such a causal relationship may allow for the development of new protocols, improve this method as a (diagnostic) tool and increase the specificity and efficacy of general TMS applications."
https://openalex.org/W3173699986,"Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is a widely used autologous treatment for tendon injuries in clinics. Platelets (PLTs) are a major source of high mobility group box1 (HMGB1) that is gaining attention as a chemoattractant that can recruit stem cells to the wound area to enhance healing of injured tissues; however, the contribution of PLT HMGB1 in wounded tendon healing remains unexplored. This study investigated the effect of PLT HMGB1 within PRP on tendon healing using PLT HMGB1 knockout (KO) and GFP mice. A window defect was created in the patellar tendons of both groups of mice, and wounds were treated with either saline, PRP isolated from PLT HMGB1-KO mice, or PRP isolated from GFP mice. Seven days post-treatment, animals were sacrificed and analyzed by gross inspection, histology, and immunostaining for characteristic signs of tendon healing and repair. Our results showed that in comparison to mice treated with PRP from PLT HMGB1-KO mice, wounds treated with PRP from GFP mice healed faster and exhibited a better organization in tendon structure. Mice treated with PRP from PLT HMGB1-KO mice produced tendon tissue with large premature wound areas and low cell densities. However, wounds of PLT HMGB1-KO mice showed better healing with PRP from HMGB1-KO mice compared to saline treatment. Moreover, wounds treated with PRP from GFP mice had increased extracellular HMGB1, decreased CD68, increased stem cell markers CD146 and CD73, and increased collagen III protein expression levels compared to those treated with PRP from PLT HMGB1-KO mice. Thus, PLT HMGB1 within PRP plays an important role in tendon wound healing by decreasing inflammation, increasing local HMGB1 levels, and recruiting stem cells to the wound area in the tendon. Our findings also suggest that the efficacy of PRP treatment for tendon injuries in clinics may depend on PLT HMGB1 within PRP preparations."

In Vanderbilt University, first year biomedical sciences PhD students were in the middle of their spring semester coursework and in the process of identifying a thesis research lab, while senior students who had already completed the first year were at various stages of their graduate training and were working on their thesis research projects. To learn how the university closure and resulting interruptions impacted our students’ learning and well-being, we administered two surveys, one to the first year students and the other to the senior students. Our main findings show that the university closure negatively impacted the overall psychological health of about one-third of the survey respondents, time management was the aspect of remote learning that caused the highest stress for close to 50% of the students, and interaction with their peers and in-person discussions were the aspects of on-campus learning that students missed the most during the remote learning period. Additionally, survey responses also show that students experienced positive outcomes as a result of remote learning that included spending increased time on additional learning interests, with family, on self-care, and for dissertation or manuscript writing. Though a variety of supportive resources are already available to students in our institution, results from our survey suggest enhancing these measures and identifying new ones targeted to addressing the academic and emotional needs of PhD students would be beneficial. Such support measures may be appropriate for students in other institutions as well."
https://openalex.org/W3200965778,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact in the United States, particularly for Black populations, and has heavily burdened the healthcare system. Hospitals have created protocols to allocate limited resources, but there is concern that these protocols will exacerbate disparities. The sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score is a tool often used in triage protocols. In these protocols, patients with higher SOFA scores are denied resources based on the assumption that they have worse clinical outcomes. The purpose of this study was to assess whether using SOFA score as a triage tool among COVID-positive patients would exacerbate racial disparities in clinical outcomes. Methods We analyzed data from a retrospective cohort of hospitalized COVID-positive patients in the Yale-New Haven Health System. We examined associations between race/ethnicity and peak overall/24-hour SOFA score, in-hospital mortality, and ICU admission. Other predictors of interest were age, sex, primary language, and insurance status. We used one-way ANOVA and chi-square tests to assess differences in SOFA score across racial/ethnic groups and linear and logistic regression to assess differences in clinical outcomes by sociodemographic characteristics. Results Our final sample included 2,554 patients. Black patients had higher SOFA scores compared to patients of other races. However, Black patients did not have significantly greater in-hospital mortality or ICU admission compared to patients of other races. Conclusion While Black patients in this sample of hospitalized COVID-positive patients had higher SOFA scores compared to patients of other races, this did not translate to higher in-hospital mortality or ICU admission. Results demonstrate that if SOFA score had been used to allocate care, Black COVID patients would have been denied care despite having similar clinical outcomes to white patients. Therefore, using SOFA score to allocate resources has the potential to exacerbate racial inequities by disproportionately denying care to Black patients and should not be used to determine access to care. Healthcare systems must develop and use COVID-19 triage protocols that prioritize equity."

https://openalex.org/W3200741573,"There is a high prevalence of gender gap in Bangladesh which might affect women's likelihood to receive maternal healthcare services. In this backdrop, we aim to investigate how gender inequality measured by intrahousehold bargaining power (or autonomy) of women and their attitudes towards intimate partner violence (IPV) affects accessing and utilizing maternal health care services. We used Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) data of 2014 covering 5460 women who gave birth at least one child in the last three years preceding the survey. We performed logistic regression to estimate the effect of women's autonomy and their attitude towards IPV on access to and utilization of maternal healthcare services. Besides, we employed different channels to understand the heterogeneous effect of gender inequality on access to maternal healthcare services. We observed that women having autonomy positively influenced attaining five required antenatal care (ANC) services (AOR: 1.17; 95% CI: 0.98-1.41) and women's negative attitudes towards IPV were positively associated with five ANC services (AOR: 1.42; 95% CI: 1.02-1.97), sufficient ANC visits (COR: 1.55; CI: 1.19-2.01), skilled birth attendant (SBA) (AOR: 1.43; 95% CI: 1.05-1.94) and postnatal care (PNC) services (AOR: 1.44; 95% CI: 1.12-1.84). Besides, rural residency, religion, household wealth, education of both women and husband were found to have some of the important channels which were making stronger effect of gender inequality on access to maternal healthcare services. The findings of our study indicate a significant association between access to maternal healthcare services and women's autonomy as well as attitude towards IPV in Bangladesh. We, therefore, recommend to protect women from violence at home and mprove their intrahousehold bargaining power to increase their access to and utilization of required maternal healthcare services."

https://openalex.org/W3201138415,"Calf morbidity and mortality are serious constraints in the success of dairy calf production. Thus, the current study was carried out with the objective to estimate the incidence of calf morbidity and mortality and associated risk factors in milk-shed districts of Gamo Zone, Southern Ethiopia. A prospective cohort and cross-sectional survey were employed from November 2019 to April 2020. A total of 196 calves were recruited by simple random sampling. Recruitment of calves was deployed by both the concurrent and prospective cohorts in calves aged below three months in study herds. The crude incidence of calf morbidity and mortality was 30.9% and 8.64%, respectively. The most frequently encountered disorder was calf diarrhea (10.17%), followed by pneumonia (6.5%). The other disorders were septicemia, omphalitis, arthritis, eye problem and miscellaneous cases. Multivariable Cox regression was revealed significant association for the calf vigor status, colostrum ingestion time, colostrum feeding status, dam parity, age at first calving, and related disorders were found risk factors of calf morbidity; likewise, calf vigor status at birth, time of colostrum ingestion and weaning were risk factors determining calf mortality. Calf morbidity and mortality rates recorded in this study were marginally higher than economically tolerable level, therefore, could affect the productivity of smallholder dairying by decreasing the obtainability of replacement heifers. Among significant explanatory factors investigated, colostrum ingestion time, method and amount were found important determinant factors of calf mortality and morbidity under the small-holder farming in the milk-shed districts of the Gamo zone. Therefore, rigorous calf husbandry practice is a need to manipulate the aforementioned calf determinants with subsequent application of tailor-made interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3200270107,"The ability to transmit information between individuals through social learning is a foundational component of cultural evolution. However, how this transmission occurs is still debated. On the one hand, the copying account draws parallels with biological mechanisms for genetic inheritance, arguing that learners copy what they observe and novel variations occur through random copying errors. On the other hand, the reconstruction account claims that, rather than directly copying behaviour, learners reconstruct the information that they believe to be most relevant on the basis of pragmatic inference, environmental and contextual cues. Distinguishing these two accounts empirically is difficult based on data from typical transmission chain studies because the predictions they generate frequently overlap. In this study we present a methodological approach that generates different predictions of these accounts by manipulating the task context between model and learner in a transmission episode. We then report an empirical proof-of-concept that applies this approach. The results show that, when a model introduces context-dependent embedded signals to their actions that are not intended to be transmitted, it is possible to empirically distinguish between competing predictions made by these two accounts. Our approach can therefore serve to understand the underlying cognitive mechanisms at play in cultural transmission and can make important contributions to the debate between preservative and reconstructive schools of thought."
https://openalex.org/W3200366552,"Environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis with species-specific primer/probe sets is promising as a tool to quantify fish abundance and distribution. Nevertheless, several factors could reduce the accuracy of this method. Here, we aimed to analyze whether intraspecific variability and diel activity rhythm affect eDNA detection in Japanese eels (Anguilla japonica). For this purpose, we performed tank experiments focusing on two points. First, we assessed the effects of base pair sequences with probe region polymorphism on eDNA detection. Next, we evaluated the influences of diel rhythm, activity, and individual differences in eDNA release rate on eDNA concentration. We examined the base pair sequences of the probe regions of 20 individuals and found genetic mismatches in two of them. The eDNA concentration was estimated to be much lower in these variants than it was in the other individuals. We conducted a rearing experiment on four non-variant individuals to explore the influences of diel activity and inter-individual differences in eDNA detection. Nocturnal eel activity was reflected in the eDNA detection but the inter-individual differences remained large. The observed weak positive correlations between eDNA concentration and activity suggest that eDNA emission is highly dependent on basal metabolism. The present study suggests that consideration of polymorphic sites at the probe region and diel activity rhythms should improve the accuracy and precision of abundance estimation through eDNA. Such fine-tuning is applicable not only for eels but also for other fishes to be targeted by eDNA technology."

San Clemente, USA), implantation in moderately advanced primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) with 5-years follow-up. Methods Retrospective, interventional case series. All subjects had POAG and underwent single iStent implantation+ phaco+IOL by a single surgeon, with 5 years follow-up. Primary outcome measures: reduction in intraocular pressure (IOP) and proportion of eyes achieving at least 20% reduction of IOP at 5 years. Secondary outcome measures: number of glaucoma drops at 1 through to 5 years; change in visual field mean deviation (MD) at year 5 compared to baseline. Results 35 eyes of 26 patients were included. Mean (sd) medicated pre-op IOP was 18.5 (3.2) mm Hg on mean (sd) 2.3 (1.0) medications. Mean IOP was reduced to 15.9 (4.5) mm Hg on 2.2 (0.9) drops, 15.0mm (4.5) mm Hg on 2.3 (0.9) drops, 15.6 (3.6) mm Hg on 2.5 (1.0) drops, 15.7 (4.43) mmHg on 2.6 (1.0) drops and 14.7 (3.02) mmHg (P&lt;0.001) on 2.7 (1.14) drops (P = 0.06) from 1 through to 5 years. At year 5, 62% of eyes had achieved at least 20% reduction in IOP. MD reduced from -8 (8.1) dB to -10.7 (13.4) dB over 5 years (p = 0.8) at 0.54dB/ annum. One eye required filtering surgery. There were no sight-threatening complications. Conclusion This study showed sustained IOP reduction and excellent safety profile for single iStent implantation. Uniquely it provides data for a more severe stage of glaucoma, and also visual field data, which indicated no significant change through 5 years."
https://openalex.org/W3200199574,"Patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) experience partial or complete upper airway collapses during sleep resulting in nocturnal hypoxia-normoxia cycling, and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the golden treatment for OSA. Nevertheless, the exact mechanisms of action, especially the transcriptome effect of CPAP on OSA patients, remain elusive. The goal of this study was to evaluate the longitudinal alterations in peripheral blood mononuclear cells transcriptome profiles of OSA patients in order to identify the hub gene and immune response. GSE133601 was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). We identified black module via weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), the genes in which were correlated significantly with the clinical trait of CPAP treatment. Finally, eleven hub genes (TRAV10, SNORA36A, RPL10, OBP2B, IGLV1-40, H2BC8, ESAM, DNASE1L3, CD22, ANK3, ACP3) were traced and used to construct a random forest model to predict therapeutic efficacy of CPAP in OSA with a good performance with AUC of 0.92. We further studied the immune cells infiltration in OSA patients with CIBERSORT, and monocytes were found to be related with the remission of OSA and partially correlated with the hub genes identified. In conclusion, these key genes and immune infiltration may be of great importance in the remission of OSA and related research of these genes may provide a new therapeutic target for OSA in the future."
https://openalex.org/W3200221431,"Ultrarunning requires extraordinary endurance but the psychological factors involved in successful ultrarunning are not well understood. One widely held view is that fluctuations in mood play a pivotal role in performance during endurance events. However, this view is primarily based on comparisons of mood before and after marathons and shorter running events. Indeed, to date no study has explicitly examined mood changes during a competive ultramarathon. To address this issue, we measured mood fluctuations in athletes competing in the Hardmoors 60, a 100 km, single day continuous trail-ultramarathon, and examined how variation in mood related to performance, as measured by completion time. The key finding was that the variability of athletes Total Mood Disturbance (TMD) score was significantly and positively correlated with completion time, consistent with the idea that mood is an important factor in determining race performance. Athletes also experienced a significant increase in tension immediately prior to race onset. This effect was more pronounced in less experienced athletes and significantly attenuated by measurement stage 1 at 35.4 km, which suggests the effect was driven by the release of pre-competition anxiety. Depression, anger and TMD were significantly lower at the pre-race measurement compared to the baseline measurement taken the week before. Consistent with previous studies, there were also significant increases in fatigue, anger and TMD during the race. The data are interpreted in terms of the Psychobiological model of endurance and may have broader implications for the understanding of endurance performance in other domains."

A proper understanding of the population genetic structure of sand fly vectors is considered important prior to planning and implementation of a successful vector control program. Thus, the present study was conducted to determine the population genetic structure of sand fly vectors in Sri Lanka. Two mitochondrial genes namely Cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (Cox 1) and Cytochrome b (Cytb), and the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) region from the nuclear ribosomal DNA were used for molecular characterization. Analyses included maximum likelihood method, network analysis and DNA polymorphisms. The outcome revealed unique sequences of all genomic regions studied except the cox 1 gene had a relationship with sand flies isolated previously from Sri Lanka, India and Israel and cytb gene of 4 sand flies that aligned with those isolated earlier from Sri Lanka and 3 from Madagascar. Furthermore, cox 1 gene and ITS 2 region analyses based on FST values indicated a possible gene flow between the study sites whereas cytb gene analysis favoured the existence of genetically distinct populations of P. argentipes in each of the study sites. Poor population differentiation of P. argentipes, a possible consequence of a gene flow, is indeed of concern due to the risk imposed by promoting the spread of functionally important phenotypes such as insecticide resistance across the country, making future vector control efforts challenging."
https://openalex.org/W3199253696,"In China, overcrowding at hospitals increases the workload of medical staff, which may negatively impact the quality of medical services. This study empirically examined the impact of hospital admissions on the quality of healthcare services in Chinese hospitals. Specifically, we estimated the impact of the number of hospital admissions per day on a patient’s length of stay (LOS) and hospital mortality rate using both ordinary least squares (OLS) and instrumental variable (IV) methods. To deal with potential endogeneity problems and accurately identify the impact of medical staff configuration on medical quality, the daily air quality index was selected as the IV. Furthermore, we examined the differential effects of hospital admissions on the quality of care across different hospital tiers. We used the data from a random sample of 10% of inpatients from a city in China, covering the period from January 2014 to June 2019. Our final regression analysis included a sample of 167 disease types (as per the ICD-10 classification list) and 862,722 patient cases from 517 hospitals. According to our results, the LOS decreased and hospital mortality rate increased with an increasing number of admissions. Using the IV method, for every additional hospital admission, there was a 6.22% ( p &lt; 0.01) decrease in LOS and a 1.86% ( p &lt; 0.01) increase in hospital mortality. The impact of healthcare staffing levels on the quality of care varied between different hospital tiers. The quality of care in secondary hospitals was most affected by the number of admissions, with the average decrease of 18.60% ( p &lt; 0.05) in LOS and the increase of 6.05% ( p &lt; 0.01) in hospital mortality for every additional hospital admission in our sample. The findings suggested that the supply of medical services in China should be increased and a hierarchical diagnosis and treatment system should be actively promoted."

Methods An observational cross-sectional study was conducted in the nephrology department at Sidi Bouzid Regional Hospital (Tunisia). In total, 39 patients with CRF and 37 healthy subjects were included. Several biochemical parameters were measured. Furthermore, markers of the oxidative and inflammatory status (MDA, TAS, SOD, and CRP) were evaluated. The p66Shc methylation status was determined using the methylation-specific PCR. Results Our results showed that levels of blood glucose, urea, creatinine, uric acid, ChT, TG, albuminuria, CRP and MDA were significantly elevated in CRF patients compared to controls. Furthermore, p66Shc promoter region was highly demethylated in CRF patients compared to healthy controls (84% vs 4%). Our data showed a positive correlation between p66Shc hypomethylation and levels of MDA (r = 0.93; p&lt;0, 05) and CRP (r = 0.89; P &lt;0, 05), as well as a significant negative correlation between p66Shc hypomethylation, TAS (r = -0.76; P &lt;0, 05) and SOD (r = -0.77; p&lt;0, 05) levels. Similarly, there was a positive correlation between p66Shc hypomethylation and the disease stages. Importantly, multiple regression analysis showed that p66shc DNA hypomethylation remains strongly correlated with MDA, CRP and stages of CRF. Conclusion This study indicates that the DNA hypomethylation of p66shc promoter was correlated with oxidative and inflammatory stress and the disease stages in CRF patients."

The efficiency of earthworms in ecology varies along with species. Therefore, the role of taxonomy in earthworm study is significant. The taxonomy of earthworms cannot reliably be established through morphological characteristics because the small and simple body plan of the earthworm does not have anatomical complex and highly specialized structures. Recently, molecular techniques have been adopted to accurately classify the earthworm species but these techniques are time-consuming and costly. To combat this issue, in this study, we propose a machine learning-based earthworm species identification model that uses digital images of earthworms. We performed a stringent performance evaluation not only through 10-fold cross-validation and on an external validation dataset but also in real settings by involving an experienced taxonomist. In all the evaluation settings, our proposed model has given state-of-the-art performance and justified its use to aid earthworm taxonomy studies. We made this model openly accessible through a cloud-based webserver and python code available at https://sites.google.com/view/wajidarshad/software and https://github.com/wajidarshad/ESIDE."

Men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women (TW) have been reported as target groups for HAV infection. This study aimed to determine the seroprevalence, risk factors, and circulating strains associated with HAV infection among MSM and TW in Central Brazil. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted from November 2011 to September 2013. Serum samples were collected from 425 individuals for anti-HAV antibody testing and HAV molecular characterization. Of them, 149 (35.1%) participants were self-identified as transgender women. Statistical analysis was performed to evaluate the risk factors of HAV seropositivity. Results The seroprevalence of HAV exposure was 69.7% (95% Confidence Interval: 65.3–74.0%). Serological evidence of HAV was significantly higher in participants who self-identified as transgender women (83.2%) than MSM (62.3%). Increasing age, non-white race, and lower monthly household income were independently associated with HAV exposure among MSM. Only lower monthly household income was independently associated with HAV exposure among TW. One anti-HAV IgM positive sample, from a transgender woman (0.2%), was detected and classified as subgenotype IA. Conclusions High HAV prevalence was observed, markedly among TW. Considering the risky sexual behaviors this population is exposed to, HAV vaccination and prevention programs targeting this population should be considered to prevent outbreaks and the burden of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W3199056395,"The tropics are naturally vulnerable to watershed erosion. This region is rapidly growing (projected to be 50% of the global population by 2050) which exacerbates erosional issues by the subsequent land use change. The issue is particularly of interest on the many (~45,000) small tropical (<5,000 km2) islands, and their >115M residents, where ecotourism and sediment intolerant ecosystems such as coral reefs are the main driver of their economies. However, vulnerability to erosion and deposition is poorly quantified in these regions due to the misclassification or exclusion of small islands in coarse global analyses. We use the only vulnerability assessment method that connects watershed erosion and coastal deposition to compare locally sourced, high-resolution datasets (5 x 5 m) to satellite-collected, remotely sensed low-resolution datasets (463 x 463 m). We find that on the island scale (~52 km2) the difference in vulnerability calculated by the two methods is minor. On the watershed scale however, low-resolution datasets fail to accurately demonstrate watershed and coastal deposition vulnerability when compared to high-resolution analysis. Specifically, we find that anthropogenic development (roads and buildings) is poorly constrained at a global scale. Structures and roads are difficult to identify in heavily forested regions using satellite algorithms and the rapid, ongoing rate of development aggravates the issue. We recommend that end-users of this method obtain locally sourced anthropogenic development datasets for the best results while using low resolution datasets for the other variables. Fortunately, anthropogenic development data can be easily collected using community-based research or identified using satellite imagery by any level of user. Using high-resolution results, we identify a development trend across St. John and regions that are both high risk and possible targets for future development. Previously published modeled and measured sedimentation rates demonstrate the method is accurate when using low-resolution or high-resolution data but, anthropogenic development, watershed slope, and earthquake probability datasets should be of the highest resolution depending on the region specified."

https://openalex.org/W3199991413,"Children imitate actions that are perceivably unnecessary to achieve the instrumental goal of an action sequence, a behavior termed over-imitation. It is debated whether this behavior is based on the motivation to follow behavioral norms and affiliate with the model or whether it can be interpreted in terms of a behavioral heuristic to copy observed intentional actions without questioning the purpose of each action step. To resolve this question, we tested whether preschool-aged children (N = 89) over-imitate a prosocial model, a helper in a prior third-party moral transgression, but refuse to over-imitate an antisocial model, the perpetrator of the moral transgression. After first observing an inefficient way to extract a reward from a puzzle box from either a perpetrator or a helper, children over-imitated the perpetrator to the same degree as they over-imitated the helper. In a second phase, children were then presented the efficient solution by the respective other model, i.e. the helper or the perpetrator. Over-imitation rates then dropped in both conditions, but remained significantly higher than in a baseline condition only when children had observed the prosocial model demonstrate the inefficient action sequence and the perpetrator performed the efficient solution. In contrast, over-imitation dropped to baseline level when the perpetrator had modelled the inefficient actions and the prosocial model subsequently showed children the efficient solution. In line with a dual-process account of over-imitation, results speak to a strong initial tendency to imitate perceivably irrelevant actions regardless of the model. Imitation behavior is then adjusted according to social motivations after deliberate consideration of different options to attain the goal."

The United Arab Emirates government implemented various preventive measures to decrease injuries in the country. We aimed to evaluate the changes in the epidemiology of fall-related injuries in Al-Ain City over the last decade. Methods Data of hospitalized patients who presented with fall-related injuries to the Al-Ain Hospital during the two periods of March 2003 to March 2006 and January 2014 to December 2017 were compared. This included patients’ demographics, mechanism, location, anatomical distribution and parameters related to injury severity. Non-parametric tests were used for the statistical analysis. Results 882 in the first and 1358 patients in the second period were studied. The incidence of falls decreased by 30.5% over ten years. The number of elderly, female patients, and UAE nationals increased, ( p &lt; 0.001, p = 0.004, and p &lt; 0.001). Falls from height decreased by 32.5% ( p &lt; 0.001) while fall on the same level increased by 22.5% ( p &lt; 0.001). Fall-related injuries at home have increased significantly by 22.6% ( p &lt;0.001), while falls in workplaces decreased by 24.4% ( p &lt;0.001). Conclusions Our study showed that the overall incidence of falls decreased compared to a decade ago. The preventive measures were effective in reducing falls from height and workplace injuries. Future preventive measures should target falls at the same level and homes."

In typically developing children, anxiety is a strong predictor of poor school performance. Despite the high prevalence of anxiety disorders among children on the spectrum, the impact of their anxiety on academic achievement is under-researched. The main aim of this project is to determine the moderating role anxiety may have in the development of academic learning behaviours (academic enablers) in children on the spectrum. This project addresses a gap in knowledge about the possible associations between anxiety and academic achievement in children on the spectrum. Understanding these associations opens up the possibility of new intervention pathways to enhance academic outcomes through anxiety reduction/prevention.This longitudinal study will aim to recruit 64 children on the spectrum aged 4-5 years and their parents. Information will be gathered from children, parents and teachers. Children will be randomly assigned to one of two conditions in order to experimentally manipulate anxiety levels in the sample: experimental (to receive an anxiety reduction/prevention program, N = 32) or control (no intervention/treatment as usual, N = 32). The primary outcome measures are child academic skills and enabling behaviours assessed using the Academic Competence Evaluation Scales and the WIAT-II. Anxiety will be assessed through parent and teacher report. Assessments will be conducted at baseline, post-experimental manipulation of anxiety, and within the first year of formal schooling. It is hypothesised that anxiety will moderate the relationship between autism characteristics and academic enablers.Results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed manuscripts and conference presentations. Lay summaries will be provided to all participants and available on the research centre website."

https://openalex.org/W3199770749,"In Location-Based Social Networks (LBSNs), registered users submit their reviews for visited point-of-interests (POIs) to the system providers (SPs). The SPs anonymously publish submitted reviews to build reputations for POIs. Unfortunately, the user profile and trajectory contained in reviews can be easily obtained by adversaries who SPs has compromised with. Even worse, existing techniques, such as cryptography and generalization, etc., are infeasible due to the necessity of public publication of reviews and the facticity of reviews. Inspired by pseudonym techniques, we propose an approach to exchanging reviews before users submit reviews to SPs. In our approach, we introduce two attacks, namely review-based location correlation attack (RLCA) and semantic-based long-term statistical attack (SLSA). RLCA can be exploited to link the real user by reconstructing the trajectory, and SLSA can be launched to establish a connection between locations and users through the difference of semantic frequency. To resist RLCA, we design a method named User Selection to Resist RLCA (USR-RLCA) to exchange reviews. We propose a metric to measure the correlation between a user and a trajectory. Based on the metric, USR-RLCA can select reviews resisting RLCA to exchange by suppressing the number of locations on each reconstructed trajectory below the correlation. However, USR-RLCA fails to resist SLSA because of ignoring the essential semantics. Hence, we design an enhanced USR-RLCA named User Selection to Resist SLSA (USR-SLSA). We first propose a metric to measure the indistinguishability of locations concerning the difference of semantic frequency in a long term. Then, USR-SLSA can select reviews resisting SLSA to exchange by allowing two reviews whose indistinguishability is below the probability difference after the exchange to be exchanged. Evaluation results verify the effectiveness of our approach in terms of privacy and utility."
https://openalex.org/W3200473767,"Source monitoring refers to the ability to identify the origin of a memory, for example, whether you remember saying something or thinking about it, and confusions of these sources have been associated with the experience of auditory verbal hallucinations (AVHs). Both AVHs and source confusions are reported to originate from dysfunctional brain activations in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the superior temporal gyrus (STG); specifically, it is assumed that a hypo active PFC and a hyper active STG gives rise to AVHs and source confusions. We set out to test this assumption by trying to mimic this hyper temporal /hypo frontal model in healthy individuals with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS): the inhibitory cathode was placed over the left PFC and the excitatory anode over the left dorsolateral STG. Participants completed a reality monitoring task (distinguishing between external and internal memory sources) and an internal source monitoring task (distinguishing between two or more internal memory sources) in two separate experiments (offline vs. online tDCS). In the offline experiment (n = 34), both source monitoring tasks were completed after tDCS stimulation, and in the online experiment (n = 27) source monitoring tasks were completed while simultaneously being stimulated with tDCS. We found that internal source monitoring abilities were significantly enhanced during active online tDCS, while reality monitoring abilities were unaffected by stimulation in both experiments. We speculate, based on combining the present findings with previous studies, that there might be different brain areas involved in reality and internal source monitoring. While internal source monitoring seems to involve speech production areas, specifically Broca’s area, as suggested in the present study, reality monitoring seems to rely more on the STG and DLPFC, as shown in other studies of the field."
