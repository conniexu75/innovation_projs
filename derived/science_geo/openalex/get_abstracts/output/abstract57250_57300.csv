https://openalex.org/W2032300143,"Visual pigment molecules are found to move transversely, but not longitudinally, in both rod and cone outer segments of mud puppy and frog. This is consistent with the idea that they are immersed in a two-dimensional fluid disk membrane. The diffusion coefficient for the motion is about 5 x 10(-9) square centimeters per second at 20 degrees C, corresponding to a root-mean-square molecular displacement of 0.3 micrometer in 1 second."
https://openalex.org/W1990583841,"This article describes the selection of auxotrophic mutants of Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells and the genetic and biochemical characterization of two mutant lines. AUXB1 is auxotrophic for glycine, adenosine, and thymidine (GAT-), whereas AUXB3 requires only glycine and adenosine (GA-). These mutants do not complement since hybrid cells formed between them are also auxotrophic. Experiments concerned with the reversion of AUXB1 to prototrophy suggest that a single genetic lesion is responsible for the multiple auxotrophy. Biochemical analysis indicates that the multiple auxotrophy of both AUXB1 and AUXB3 is a result of low levels of intracellular folates in mutant cells. Phenotypic reversion to complete or partial prototrophy can be accomplished by growing these cells in high concentrations of folic or folinic acids. However, neither the folate transport nor the dihydrofolate reductase are defective in mutant cells. Chromatographic analysis of intracellular folate derivatives indicates that while folates extracted from wild type cells exist almost exclusively as polyglutamyl derivates (primarily pentaglutamates), AUXB1 cells contain primarily folate derivates in monoglutamyl form and AUXB3 cells contain mono-, di-, and perhaps some triglutamates. This observation suggests that the enzyme responsible for linking glutamate residues onto intracellular folate derivates is the site of the biochemical lesion in the mutant cells. Our results also suggest that a possible function of polyglutamyl residues is to aid cellular retention of folates."

https://openalex.org/W1509417706,"Abstract The polyribosomes synthesizing ovalbumin and albumin have been isolated from total oviduct polysomes and total rat liver polysomes, respectively. The isolation was performed using an indirect immunoprecipitation technique which is based on the specific reaction which occurs between antibody against a purified native protein and the nascent peptide chains on polysomes synthesizing that protein. A soluble antibody-nascent chain-polysome complex is formed by incubating antibody with polysomes, and then precipitated by reaction with an anti-antibody. The techniques developed are both efficient and highly specific. Near quantitative isolation of polysomal mRNA coding for a specific protein may be achieved. Indirect immunoprecipitation results in nonspecific precipitation of less than 0.5% of total polysomes. Ovalbumin mRNA isolated by indirect immunoprecipitation is 99% pure with respect to contamination by other species of mRNA and rat liver albumin mRNA is greater than 95% pure. Evidence supporting these conclusions includes: (a) incubation of oviduct polysomes containing labeled nascent peptide chains with anti-bovine serum albumin results in precipitation of only 0.4% of the labeled polysomes; (b) indirect immunoprecipitates from oviduct polysomes reacted with anti-ovalbumin contain essentially no nascent peptide chains larger than ovalbumin; (c) ovalbumin and albumin mRNAs extracted from immunoprecipitates are enriched for the synthesis of their respective proteins by 1.8- and 8.7-fold, exactly the degree of purification predicted from their relative rates of synthesis; (d) isolation of albumin synthesizing polysomes from a mixture of rat liver polysomes and hen oviduct polysomes resulted in nonspecific precipitation of only 0.4% of the ovalbumin synthesizing polysomes when the immunoprecipitated RNA was assayed for its ability to synthesize ovalbumin in vitro. Indirect immunoprecipitation appears to be a general method widely applicable to the separation and isolation of polysomes and messenger RNAs coding for specific proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1987017005,The mechanism by which plasmacytomas (PC) depress the primary immune response to sheep red cells was investigated by determining the ability of normal spleen cells to produce antibody when enclosed in Millipore chambers and implanted in PC-bearing mice. Chamber-enclosed normal spleen cells implanted in PC-bearing mice responded poorly to the sheep red cells when compared to similar cells enclosed in chambers and implanted in normal mice or in mice with other lymphoid and nonlymphoid tumors. The data suggest that PC-induced immune suppression is mediated by a humoral factor.

https://openalex.org/W2071725061,"A hydroxy analog of vitamin D2, 1α-hydroxyvitamin D2, has been synthesized and tested for biological activity. This vitamin derivative is active in stimulating intestinal calcium transport and bone calcium mobilization in the rat and exhibits antirachitic activity. Its biopotency is comparable to that of the corresponding vitamin D3 analog, 1α-hydroxyvitamin D3."

https://openalex.org/W1576994573,"Abstract When l-2-aminopropanol is added to a reaction mixture containing ethanolamine ammonia-lyase and adenosylcobalamin, the carbon-cobalt bond of adenosylcobalamin is rapidly cleaved. The adenosyl moiety of the cofactor accumulates as 5'-deoxyadenosine, or a compound which readily converts to 5'-deoxyadenosine, while the cobalamin moiety is converted to a species with a spectrum resembling that of cob(II)alamin. No loss in enzymatic activity occurs. The presence of 5'-deoxyadenosine, therefore, cannot be associated with inactivation of the enzyme. The formation of 5'-deoxyadenosine from adenosylcobalamin is reversible. This provides further evidence for intermediate involvement of the nucleoside in the catalytic process. Upon longer incubation with l-2-aminopropanol, the enzyme-adenosylcobalamin complex losses its activity, while its spectrum changes to that of hydroxocobalamin. Upon denaturation, 5'-deoxyadenosine is again isolated. We tentatively attribute this inactivation to the decomposition of a (hypothetical) intermediate substrate-cobalamin adduct."

The duration over which reciprocity holds decrease with increases in either flash energy of ambient light intensity. These findings parallel those of human psychophysical experiments."

https://openalex.org/W1602314374,"Abstract Some of the properties of galactosyltransferase of Golgi membrane-rich fractions from rat liver were investigated. The kinetic properties of the enzyme were determined from the initial rates of reaction under various conditions of incubation. Puromycyin, a known inhibitor of protein synthesis, was shown to inhibit the galactosyltransferase activity in vitro. The inhibition depended on the concentration of puromycin and on the duration of exposure of Golgi membranes to the drug. A number of compounds, structurally related to puromycin, were unable to produce the inhibition. A combination of the aminonucleoside and amino acid portions of the puromycin molecule was equally ineffective. Binding of puromycin to the membranes was demonstrated with [3H]puromycin. It was concluded that this binding to the membrane disrupted the enzymatic activity."
https://openalex.org/W2005837371,"Scanning electron microscopy has been used to characterize alterations of lymphocyte surface topology that occur on contact with erythrocytes during the rosetting reaction. Molt-4 cells, a line of leukemic human lymphocytes, defined as T-cells through their ability to form rosettes with sheep erythrocytes, were used for this. Unreacted Molt-4 cells exhibit surfaces that are virtually smooth and carry few microvilli. In contrast, Molt-4 cells in rosettes display a time-dependent modification of surface topology, characterized by the emergence of numerous, long microvilli, particularly in areas of red cell contact."

As unbleached rhodopsin concentration rose during fractionation, adenylate cyclase activity declined, although cyclase and rhodopsin were not completely resolved. In those fractions with higher cyclase activity, unbleached rhodopsin concentration was low. Adenylate cyclase activity was confined almost entirely to membranous fractions. Cyclase activity of the outer segment fraction was not affected by bleaching, homogenization, sonication, or freezing at -196°."
