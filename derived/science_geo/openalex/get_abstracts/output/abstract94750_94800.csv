https://openalex.org/W1986115510,"Striking convergent evolution is found in the properties of the organic osmotic solute (osmolyte) systems observed in bacteria, plants, and animals. Polyhydric alcohols, free amino acids and their derivatives, and combinations of urea and methylamines are the three types of osmolyte systems found in all water-stressed organisms except the halobacteria. The selective advantages of the organic osmolyte systems are, first, a compatibility with macromolecular structure and function at high or variable (or both) osmolyte concentrations, and, second, greatly reduced needs for modifying proteins to function in concentrated intracellular solutions. Osmolyte compatibility is proposed to result from the absence of osmolyte interactions with substrates and cofactors, and the nonperturbing or favorable effects of osmolytes on macromolecular-solvent interactions."

https://openalex.org/W2019931839,"Whether neoplasms are unicellular or multicellular in their origin, the process of tumor evolution and progression can rapidly generate biological diversity. Metastases result from the survival and proliferation of specialized subpopulations of cells within the parent tumor. Metastases may have a clonal origin and different metastases may develop from different progenitor cells. However, as with the primary tumor, the origin of metastases is unimportant since the process of tumor evolution and progression can generate biological diversity within and among different metastatic foci."

Hence, prolonged photographic exposure of immunofluorescently labeled cells in the fluorescence microscope yields images with increased sensitivity, making feasible multiple data collection, as with serial optical sectioning."
https://openalex.org/W2088327372,"Scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive x-ray spectrometry was used to analyze the elemental content of neurofibrillary tangle (NFT)-bearing and NFT-free neurons within the Sommer's sector (H1 region) of the hippocampus in Guamanian Chamorros with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and parkinsonism-dementia and in neurologically normal controls. Preliminary data indicate prominent accumulation of aluminum within the nuclear region and perikaryal cytoplasm of NFT-bearing hippocampal neurons, regardless of the underlying neurological diagnosis. These findings further extend the association between intraneuronal aluminum and NFT formation and support the hypothesis that environmental factors are related to the neurodegenerative changes seen in the Chamorro population."
https://openalex.org/W2065997722,"A wide variety of toxic chemicals cause blebbing of the plasma membrane in isolated hepatocytes. These alterations in surface structure occur well before cell death. The formation of blebs appears to be directly related to changes in the concentration of extramitochondrial calcium ions. These changes probably reduce the ability of the hepatocyte cytoskeleton to maintain normal surface morphology. The concentration of soluble thiols, notably glutathione, appears to regulate the size of the extramitochondrial calcium ion pool. Disturbances in intracellular thiol and calcium ion homeostasis therefore seem to be responsible for the surface blebbing observed during toxic injury to isolated hepatocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1578874979,"The carbohydrate binding specificities of the leukoagglutinating phytohemagglutinin (L-PHA) and erythroagglutinating phytohemagglutinin (E-PHA) lectins of the red kidney bean, Phaseolus vulgaris, have been investigated by lectin-agarose affinity chromatography of Asn-linked oligosaccharides. High affinity binding to E-PHA-agarose occurs only with biantennary glycopeptides containing 2 outer galactose residues and a residue of N-acetylglucosamine linked beta 1,4 to the beta-linked mannose residue in the core. This species is not retarded on L-PHA-agarose. In contrast, tri- and tetraanternnary glycopeptides containing outer galactose residues and an alpha-linked mannose residue substituted at positions C-2 and C-6 are specifically retarded on L-PHA-agarose. Triantennary glycopeptides containing outer galactose residues and an alpha-linked mannose residue substituted at positions C-2 and C-4 are not retarded on L-PHA-agarose. Additionally, the presence of outer sialic acid residues or a core fucose residue does not influence the behavior of complex glycopeptides on either of these lectin-agarose conjugates. This ability of E-PHA and L-PHA to discriminate between Asn-linked oligosaccharides with various branching patterns can be utilized in the fractionation of these glycopeptides (see paper following)."
https://openalex.org/W1485602773,"We present a general technique for fractionating cell-derived asparagine-linked oligosaccharides on the basis of oligosaccharide structure. This procedure has been applied to the study of [2-3H]mannose-labeled mouse lymphoma cells (BW5147). The fractionation scheme involves serial chromatography on concanavalin A-Sepharose, pea lectin-Sepharose, and leukoagglutinating phytohemagglutinin-agarose. Approximately 85% of the labeled glycopeptides was retained on one or more of the affinity columns. The various fractions eluted from the columns contain relatively pure populations of glycopeptides which were used for structural analysis. The recovery of the glycopeptides was quantitative. The procedure was used to estimate the overall spectrum of Asn-linked oligosaccharides synthesized by the lymphoma cell line. We conclude that serial lectin-agarose affinity chromatography is a rapid, sensitive, and specific technique for fractionating and analyzing Asn-linked oligosaccharides. A general fractionation scheme employing additional lectins is presented."
https://openalex.org/W2071187146,"To start by looking back a little, recall that even a small brain lesion, if critically located in the left or language hemisphere, may selectively destroy a person's ability to read, while at the same time sparing speech and the ability to converse. The printed page continues to be seen, but the words have lost their meaning. This condition typically follows from focal damage to the angular gyrus in the left hemisphere. It also results from lesions interruptingt he neural input to this left angular gyrus from the visual or calcarine cortical areas (1, 2). It is natural to conclude in such cases that the left hemisphere is responsible
for reading while the undamaged right hemisphere, in contrast, must be wordblind or incapable of seeing meaning in the printed word."
https://openalex.org/W2007510308,"A fusion plasmid, pMK, containing the mouse metallothionein-I promoter/regulatory region joined to the structural gene of herpesvirus thymidine kinase, was introduced into mice by microinjection into fertilized eggs followed by reinsertion of the eggs into foster mothers. Fifteen percent (10 of 69) of the mice developing from this procedure carried pMK sequences. Seven of these mice expressed high levels of viral thymidine kinase in the liver. This enzyme is inducible by heavy metals, as indicated by assay of thymidine kinase activity following sequential partial hepatectomies with or without cadmium treatment. However, glucocorticoid treatment has been ineffective in all transgenic mice tested. The pMK sequences are extensively methylated at a variety of restriction sites, indicating the existence of a de novo methylation enzyme. We have analyzed the inheritance of pMK sequences and their expression in several pedigrees. These fusion genes are inherited as though they were integrated into a single chromosome; however, their expression may be extinguished, diminished or enhanced in the offspring relative to that of the parent. In some animals there is a correlation between changes in DNA methylation and expression of these fusion genes."
https://openalex.org/W1975360166,"The activity of a cystine transport system in lysosomes prepared from the leukocytes of patients with cystinosis was found to be deficient. In normal subjects, this system was resistant to N-ethylmaleimide and demonstrated saturation kinetics. Lysosomes from individuals heterozygous for cystinosis demonstrated a reduced maximum velocity for cystine egress from lysosomes. The rate of cystine escape from normal lysosomes was enhanced by adenosine triphosphate. The availability of normal and mutant lysosomes provides a means of investigating mechanisms of amino acid transport across lysosomal membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1990326404,"The effect of general anesthetics on frog motoneurons and rat hippocampus pyramidal cells was examined with sucrose gap and intracellular recording, respectively. A number of volatile and intravenous anesthetics directly hyperpolarized the motoneurons. The potency of these agents in hyperpolarizing motoneurons was strongly correlated with their anesthetic potency. While the responses to barbiturates and alpha-chloralose were blocked by gamma-aminobutyric acid antagonists and were dependent on the chloride gradient, the responses to all the other anesthetics tested were generated by a separate mechanism. Intracellular recording from hippocampal pyramidal cells suggested that an increase in potassium conductance accounts for these responses. Such a nonsynaptic action would contribute to the decreased neuronal responsiveness observed for these compounds and thus to their anesthetic action."

https://openalex.org/W2018503548,Increases with aging in subperiosteal dimensions and second moments of area (measures of bending and torsional rigidity) in femoral and tibial cross sections are documented in an archeological sample from the American Southwest. Significant differences between cross-sectional sites and between sexes in the pattern of cortical remodeling with age are also present. These differences appear to be related to variations in the stress or strain levels in different regions of the femur and tibia which result from in vivo mechanical loadings of the lower limb.
https://openalex.org/W1524830639,"Bovine aortic endothelial cells release a heparin-like substance in the presence of 0.4% fetal calf serum. This substance inhibited the growth of smooth muscle cells in vitro by about 70%. Substitution of platelet-poor plasma for serum resulted in minimal liberation of inhibitory activity from the cells unless at least 10-fold higher concentrations of platelet-poor plasma were utilized. This suggested that a platelet product was involved in the release process. Therefore, we examined the ability of the platelet heparitinase described in the preceding communication to release heparin-like species from cultured endothelial cells. Our results show that when endothelial cells were exposed to serum-free medium containing 1 ng/ml of the purified platelet endoglycosidase, at least as much inhibitory activity was released as was obtained with 0.4% serum. Dose response experiments indicated that only 10 pg/ml of the enzyme were necessary to liberate 50% of the inhibitory activity from endothelial cells. The heparin-like nature of the inhibitory substance was demonstrated by its sensitivity to Flavobacterium heparinase. Utilizing appropriate controls, the release of heparin-like material by the endoglycosidase was shown to be enzyme-specific and was not due to artifacts of experimental manipulations. In addition, this enzyme did not convert prereleased material to an active component, but directly liberated the active heparin-like species from endothelial cells. A simple model describing the possible role of heparin-like components and the endoglycosidase in the normal and injured wall is presented."
https://openalex.org/W1969298458,"Cytogenic studies were performed on the direct chromosome preparations of the renal cell carcinoma cells and the cultured peripheral blood lymphocytes of a patient with familial renal cell carcinoma. The results revealed a specific, acquired translocations (3p;11p) present in the majority of metaphases of the tumor, indicating that the development of renal cell carcinoma is associated with a deletion in the proximal end of 3p. Renal cell carcinoma is thus the third example--the first two being retinoblastoma and Wilms' tumor--of a chromosomal deletion occurring germinally or somatically in association with a specific tumor. This finding adds further support to the existence of specific human cancer genes."
https://openalex.org/W1994096971,"In the epidermis of terrestrial vertebrates, lipid lamellae between the horny cells are thought to form a barrier to water loss. The lipids are extruded from living cells after assembly in lamellar granules. This assembly might be promoted by recently identified 1-(3'-O-acyl)-beta-D-glucosyl-N-(omega-hydroxyacyl)sphingosines, which have 30- and 32-carbon hydroxy acids as amides and linoleic acid esterified to glucose. Such a role for these molecules could explain the effects of essential fatty acid deficiency, in which the lamellar granules fail to assemble and the barrier to water diffusion is lost."
https://openalex.org/W1984887177,"We have asked whether there are sequences around the human growth hormone gene that render this gene responsive to induction by glucocorticoid hormones. Recombinant clones encoding human growth hormone were introduced into the chromosome of murine fibroblasts by cotransformation. Exposure of cotransformants to glucocorticoids results in a three to five fold induction of human growth hormone mRNA and a similar induction in secreted human growth hormone protein. The DNA sequences required for induction reside within 500 nucleotides of 5'-flanking DNA. Fusion of this segment of 5'-flanking DNA to the structural gene sequences of a hormone-insensitive gene, such as thymidine kinase, now renders this gene responsive to glucocorticoid induction."
https://openalex.org/W2030682940,"Antibodies to collagen types I, II, and IV were measured in patients with otosclerosis and patients with Meniere's disease. Levels of antibodies to type II collagen were significantly higher in these patients than in control subjects, while no differences were found among levels of antibodies to collagen type I or type IV. These observations suggest a possible role for type II collagen autoimmunity in the etiology of otosclerosis and Meniere's disease."
https://openalex.org/W2112548723,"In northern California, western fence lizards, Sceloporus occidentalis, are frequently parasitized by Plasmodium mexicanum, which causes malaria. Animals with this naturally occurring malarial infection are anemic: immature erythrocytes in peripheral blood become abundant (1 to 30 percent), and blood hemoglobin concentration decreases 25 percent. Maximal oxygen consumption decreases 15 percent and aerobic scope drops 29 percent in infected lizards; both correlate with blood hemoglobin concentration. Running stamina, but not burst running speed, is reduced in malarious lizards. There is a hierarchical relation between infection with malaria and effects on hematology, physiological function, and behavioral capacity. The results suggest that malarial infection may have significant effects on the ecology of lizard hosts."
https://openalex.org/W2044781673,"The efficient assembly of ribosomes requires a balanced synthesis of ribosomal RNA and each ribosomal protein. In an attempt to establish the mechanisms responsible for such balanced synthesis we have altered the gene dosage for one of the components by introducing into yeast an autonomously replicating plasmid containing the gene tcm1, which codes for ribosomal protein L3. The plasmid is maintained at 5-10 copies per cell by selection for expression of its URA3 gene. The plasmid-containing cells transcribe 7.5 times as much L3 mRNA as control cells, maintain 3.5 times as much L3 mRNA as control cells and synthesize no more than 1.2 times as much L3 protein as control cells. We conclude that the balanced synthesis of ribosomal proteins is maintained by modulating both the efficiency of translation and the lifetime of their mRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W1510809099,"An endoglycosidase which cleaves heparin and heparan sulfate was isolated from outdated human platelets by freeze-thaw solubilization, heparin-Sepharose chromatography, DEAE-cellulose chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography, octyl-agarose chromatography, concanavalin A-Sepharose chromatography, and Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration. The overall extent of purification of the platelet heparitinase is about 240,000-fold and the overall yield of the enzyme is about 5.6% as compared to the initial freeze-thaw solubilization preparation. The final product is physically homogeneous as judged by disc gel electrophoresis at acidic pH as well as gel filtration chromatography and exhibits an apparent molecular weight of approximately 134,000. Furthermore, our results indicate that the above enzyme is present within platelet lysosomes. The biologic potency of the endoglycosidase was examined as a function of pH. The data show that the platelet heparitinase is maximally active from pH 5.5 to pH 7.5. However, the enzyme possesses minimal ability to cleave heparin at pH less than 4.0 or greater than 9.0. The substrate specificity of the platelet endoglycosidase was determined by identifying susceptible linkages within the heparin molecule that can be cleaved by the above component. Our studies indicate that this enzyme is only able to hydrolyze glucuronsylglucosamine linkages. Furthermore, investigation of the structure of the disaccharide which lies on the nonreducing end of the cleaved glucuronic acid residue suggests that N-sulfation of the glucosamine moiety or ester sulfation of the adjacent iduronic acid groups are not essential for bond scission."
https://openalex.org/W1974941650,A method combining steroid autoradiography and fluorescent dye retrograde neuroanatomical tracing has been devised. This method makes it possible to demonstrate that some estrogen-concentrating cells in the ventrolateral subdivision of the ventromedial nucleus of the rat hypothalamus are neurons that send axons to the dorsal midbrain. Other cells only concentrate estrogen or only project to the midbrain. Estrogen-concentrating neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus that project to the dorsal midbrain are likely to transmit hormone-influenced signals that regulate circuits for reproductive or other behaviors or autonomic functions.
https://openalex.org/W2049865525,"Intron 4 (14) of the split gene cob in mitochondrial DNA contains a long open reading frame in phase with the preceding exon. Mutations in this intron block the excision of the 14 sequence from the cob precursor RNA and, at the same time, generate a series of new polypeptides, parts of which apparently result from translation of 14 sequences. We sequenced six mutations clustered in the upstream part of the open reading frame, about 340 bp from the exon-intron boundary (box9 cluster). Four are base pair exchanges in the same triplet of this region; these form the polypeptides typical for 14 plus a trans-acting product encoded by 14, as shown by complementation studies. The other two mutations--a -2 bp deletion at the same site, causing frameshift with a chain-terminating codon within a few triplets, and a base pair exchange at a nearby site--affect both the formation of 14 typical translation products and the trans-acting function. These results on box9 mutants combined with results on box7 mutants suggest that an 14-encoded ""maturase"" protein (apparent molecular weight, 27,000) is cleaved off a precursor protein (apparent molecular weight, 55,000) encoded by exon sequences B1 to B4 and the intron open reading frame. We further discuss the role of the box9 nucleotide sequence in the maturation of cob-specific RNA."
https://openalex.org/W2027927803,"The thorax of the adult Drosophila contains about 80 muscles, which develop from the mesoderm. A new genetic marker was used to map the cell lineage of the myoblasts that form these muscles. Clones of marked cells were produced by irradiation of embryos and larvae, and these were detected in the adult by histochemical staining. The principal findings are that the muscles of each segment have separate origins, and that each becomes compartmented precisely into a dorsal-lineage and a ventral-lineage set of muscles, each set probably being formed by the adepithelial cells found in one imaginal disc. In contrast with the epidermis, the muscles of each thoracic segment are not subdivided into anterior and posterior compartments, and clones of muscle cells that are homozygous for recessive-lethal alleles of engrailed develop normally."

Our results suggest that the transcriptionally active CaMV DNA is in the form of a minichromosome and that this DNA does not contain the site-specific discontinuities characteristic of the virion."
https://openalex.org/W2019649192,"The level of pyridine nucleotides (NADH and NAD+) in the mineralizing growth plate of the chick was ascertained by high-resolution scanning microfluorimetry and biochemical analysis. Scanning electron microscopy and light microscopy were used to relate the concentrations of NADH and NAD+ to stages of chondrocyte maturation. A dramatic increase was found in the relative concentration of reduced pyridine nucleotides in the hypertrophic zone. On either side of this zone, in proliferating and calcifying cartilage, there was a decrease in NADH fluorescence, and the NADH/NAD+ ratio was depressed. The finding that NADH accumulated in the tissue zone associated with the earliest deposition of bone mineral supports the hypothesis that a change in the redox state initiates tissue mineralization."
https://openalex.org/W2078125985,"2′-Fluoro-5-methyl-1-β-D-arabinosyluracil (FMAU) labeled with carbon-14 was used to image herpes simplex virus type 1-infected regions of rat brain by quantitative autoradiography. FMAU is a potent antiviral pyrimidine nucleoside which is selectively phosphorylated by virus-coded thymidine kinase. When the labeled FMAU was administered 6 hours before the rats were killed, the selective uptake and concentration of the drug and its metabolites by infected cells (defined by immunoperoxidase staining of viral antigens) allowed quantitative definition and mapping of HSV-1-infected structures in autoradiograms of brain sections. These results show that quantitative autoradiography can be used to characterize the local metabolism of antiviral drugs by infected cells in vivo. They also suggest that the selective uptake of drugs that exploit viral thymidine kinase for their antiviral effect can, by appropriate labeling, be used in conjunction with clinical neuroimaging techniques to define infected regions of human brain, thereby providing a new approach to the diagnosis of herpes encephalitis in man."
https://openalex.org/W2067781400,"We have recovered overlapping clones that represent in the aggregate a contiguous segment of chromosomal DNA 270 kb in length, or probably one third of the chorion locus of Bombyx mori. Approximately 70 genes have been identified, the majority of which are arranged in coordinately expressed pairs. The nonidentical genes expressed in the late period of choriogenesis are clustered within a single, 130 kb region, which is flanked by regions containing genes that are active during the middle developmental period. The late genes encode two families of high-cysteine proteins; the evolutionarily persistent clustering of these families contrasts sharply with the extensive sequence diversification of the structural genes and their flanking DNA elements. We discuss the possible regulatory significance of the clustered arrangement, as well as certain features of multigene family evolution."
https://openalex.org/W1970066246,The release of γ-aminobutyric acid was confirmed in isolated cat colon loaded with tritiated γ-aminobutyric acid. Thirty to 180 minutes after loading the spontaneous efflux of tritium appeared to fit a single exponential curve with an efflux rate coefficient of 0.002 per minute. Electrical stimulation produced frequency-dependent increases in the tritium efflux and in the contractions. Even 120 minutes later over 91 percent of the total radioactivity in the superfusates was attributable to tritiated γ-aminobutyric acid. The acid release and the contractions induced by electrical transmural stimulation were inhibited by tetrodotoxin and by a calcium-free medium. Release of the acid was not significant during contractions elicited by nicotine and acetylcholine. These findings indicate that γ-aminobutyric acid is released from the terminals of neurons in the myenteric plexus of the colon.
https://openalex.org/W1799752396,"Hydrophobic binding to the lectin from lima beans (Phaseolus lunatus) was studied by lectin-induced alterations in the fluorescence and absorption spectra of several hydrophobic ligands. The fluorescence of 1,8-anilinonaphthalenesulfonic acid (ANS) was greatly enhanced in the presence of lima bean lectin with concomitant shift of the fluorescence emission maximum from 520 to 469 nm. Similar enhancement was seen with 2,6-toluidinylnaphthalenesulfonic acid (TNS) with a shift of emission from 500 to 423 nm, and with an uncharged analogue, N-phenyl-1-naphthylamine. Fluorescence titrations with ANS and rose bengal yielded affinity constants of 3.9 X 10(3) and 6 X 10(5) M-1, respectively. Fluorescence titration with TNS indicated binding heterogeneity and yielded intrinsic association constants of 7.8 X 10(4) and 2.2 X 10(3) M-1 assuming a model with two classes of independent sites. The high affinity binding had an apparent stoichiometry of 1.08 sites/lectin tetramer. Equilibrium dialysis for ANS and TNS confirmed the results of fluorescence titration and gave stoichiometries for ANS and low affinity TNS binding of one site/subunit. Neither chemical modification of thiol groups known to be essential for carbohydrate binding nor titration in the presence of haptenic sugar affected the binding of ANS or TNS to the lectin. These results indicated that the carbohydrate and hydrophobic binding sites of lima bean lectin are independent and noninteracting."
https://openalex.org/W2037326480,"Strains of Saccharomyces that carry the nib allele of a nuclear gene exhibit a “nibbled” colony morphology if they also harbor the plasmid 2μ DNA. I have found that the expression of the nibbled phenotype is correlated with the presence of a subpopulation of abnormally large cells that give rise to mortal clones. Large cells apparently become large as a consequence of a defect in DNA replication or nuclear division. Large nib cells contain twice as much 2μ DNA per microgram of total DNA as small nib cells do, and elevated 2μ DNA copy number is the cause, not the effect, of increased cell size. It appears that the NIB allele can prevent an increase in 2μ DNA copy number, but cannot produce a decrease once the copy number has exceeded the normal level. I propose, therefore, that the NIB gene product normally represses the amplification of 2μ DNA copy number, and that the nib allele is partially defective in this function."

https://openalex.org/W1997955552,"Studies of a unique clone of skin fibroblasts from a normal 46 XX female reveal that the G6PD locus on the inactive X chromosome has been derepressed. The reactivation event occurs spontaneously, and is associated with normal karyotype, including the presence of a late-replicating X chromosome. Analysis of mouse-human hybrids with the relevant chromosome provides evidence that the derepressed locus is on the inactive X, and that reactivation is not extensive (the PGK locus is not derepressed). Nor is any general change in DNA methylation of this chromosome detectable with Hpa II and an X-specific DNA probe. Studies of the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase phenotype in these heterozygous cells indicate that the reactivated X produces only half the enzyme subunits as are produced by the active X. Although this dosage difference may be related to the mutational event responsible for derepression of the locus, these observations along with other evidence suggest that loci on the inactive X, when expressed, have less activity than corresponding loci on the active X."
https://openalex.org/W2034128994,"In Neurospora, the gene encoding the mitochondrial large (25S) ribosomal RNA contains an intervening sequence of 2.3 kb. We have identified eight nuclear mutants that are defective in splicing the mitochondrial large ribosomal RNA and that accumulate unspliced precursor RNA. These mutants identify three different nuclear genes required for the same mitochondrial RNA splicing reaction. Some of the mutants have unique phenotypic characteristics (for example, accumulation of an unusual intron RNA) that may provide insight into specific aspects of mitochondrial RNA splicing. Mutations at one locus, cyt4, are subject to partial phenotypic suppression by the electron-transport inhibitor antimycin. This phenomenon suggests that at least one component required for mitochondrial RNA splicing is regulated such that its synthesis or activity is increased in response to impairment of electron transport."

Such differences suggest that XP-A, -C and -D carry mutations at different loci. The product of the first of these loci (factor A) is present in significant excess in normal fibroblasts, seems to turn over rapidly and may be a dimer or higher polymer. The products of the other two loci (factors C and D) do not seem to be present in significant excess in the cytoplasm of normal fibroblasts, but factor C may accumulate abnormally in XP-D. Factors C and D turn over slowly (D more than C) and they do not move freely from the cell nucleus. Factors A and C, at least, seem to act directly and not via gene regulation."

Complete assignment, at various temperatures, of the 360-MHz 1H NMR spectrum of beta-methyl N,N'-diacetyl chitobioside confirms this interpretation. This analysis has revealed the existence of a long range chemical shift perturbation in these glycopeptides which is interpreted as arising from their specific three-dimensional structure."

(1980) Cell 19, 473-480). The present studies showed that the addition of prostaglandin (PG) E2 blocked the inhibitory effect of cortisol on the synthesis and accumulation of alpha-lactalbumin without affecting casein production. The effect of PGE2 was observed at a concentration as low as 6.6 X 10(-8) M and was maximal at 2.8 X 10(-6) M. Among various prostaglandins tested, PGE2 and PGE1 were most potent and other prostaglandins were also active with the potency decreasing in the following order: PGF1 alpha greater than or equal to PGF2 alpha greater than or equal to PGA2 greater than or equal to PGB2 greater than PGA1 greater than or equal to PGB1. Arachidonic acid was also effective, but only at very high concentrations, 6.6 X 10(-5)-1.6 X 10(-4) M. The ability of prostaglandins to allow a maximal formation of the two milk proteins suggests a possible modulatory role of prostaglandins in hormonal control of milk-protein synthesis."
