https://openalex.org/W2765351619,"Nucleic acid editing holds promise for treating genetic disease, particularly at the RNA level, where disease-relevant sequences can be rescued to yield functional protein products. Type VI CRISPR-Cas systems contain the programmable single-effector RNA-guided ribonuclease Cas13. We profiled type VI systems in order to engineer a Cas13 ortholog capable of robust knockdown and demonstrated RNA editing by using catalytically inactive Cas13 (dCas13) to direct adenosine-to-inosine deaminase activity by ADAR2 (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA type 2) to transcripts in mammalian cells. This system, referred to as RNA Editing for Programmable A to I Replacement (REPAIR), which has no strict sequence constraints, can be used to edit full-length transcripts containing pathogenic mutations. We further engineered this system to create a high-specificity variant and minimized the system to facilitate viral delivery. REPAIR presents a promising RNA-editing platform with broad applicability for research, therapeutics, and biotechnology."

https://openalex.org/W2766316242,"Empirical two-part models describe the relationship between conservation spending, human development pressures and biodiversity loss and can inform sustainable development strategies by predicting the effects of financing decisions on future biodiversity losses. Financial investments into conservation are often held back by a lack of certainty over the benefits of spending more. Anthony Waldron and colleagues assess the impact of conservation spending on biodiversity between 1996 and 2008 in 109 countries that signed up to the Convention on Biological Diversity. They find that conservation spending over this period reduced national-level biodiversity loss by 29%, on average. They also find that the funding needed to achieve specific conservation goals rises with socioeconomic pressures. The authors develop a predictive model of biodiversity decline, which takes into account the effects of human development pressures and conservation financing. They propose that this could help to predict the funding that each country needs to achieve specific biodiversity policy goals, including those laid out in the Convention on Biological Diversity and the broader United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Halting global biodiversity loss is central to the Convention on Biological Diversity and United Nations Sustainable Development Goals1,2, but success to date has been very limited3,4,5. A critical determinant of success in achieving these goals is the financing that is committed to maintaining biodiversity6,7,8,9; however, financing decisions are hindered by considerable uncertainty over the likely impact of any conservation investment6,7,8,9. For greater effectiveness, we need an evidence-based model10,11,12 that shows how conservation spending quantitatively reduces the rate of biodiversity loss. Here we demonstrate such a model, and empirically quantify how conservation investment reduced biodiversity loss in 109 countries (signatories to the Convention on Biological Diversity and Sustainable Development Goals), by a median average of 29% per country between 1996 and 2008 We also show that biodiversity changes in signatory countries can be predicted with high accuracy, using a dual model that balances the effects of conservation investment against those of economic, agricultural and population growth (human development pressures)13,14,15,16,17,18. Decision-makers can use this model to forecast the improvement that any proposed biodiversity budget would achieve under various scenarios of human development pressure, and then compare these forecasts to any chosen policy target. We find that the impact of spending decreases as human development pressures grow, which implies that funding may need to increase over time. The model offers a flexible tool for balancing the Sustainable Development Goals of human development and maintaining biodiversity, by predicting the dynamic changes in conservation finance that will be needed as human development proceeds."

Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphoid cells that contribute to host defence against viral infection and to the control of some types of cancer. Alberto Mantovani and colleagues show in this study that IL-1R8, a negative regulator of the IL-1 family of cytokines, restrains the activity of NK cells. IL-1R8-deficient mice have more mature NK cells with enhanced functional capabilities and are more resistant to NK-cell-dependent hepatic tumour models and murine cytomegalovirus infection. The results suggest that IL-1R8 acts as a checkpoint regulator of NK cell activation and that its blockade may be of use in cancer therapy. Interleukin-1 receptor 8 (IL-1R8, also known as single immunoglobulin IL-1R-related receptor, SIGIRR, or TIR8) is a member of the IL-1 receptor (ILR) family with distinct structural and functional characteristics, acting as a negative regulator of ILR and Toll-like receptor (TLR) downstream signalling pathways and inflammation1. Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphoid cells which mediate resistance against pathogens and contribute to the activation and orientation of adaptive immune responses2,3,4. NK cells mediate resistance against haematopoietic neoplasms but are generally considered to play a minor role in solid tumour carcinogenesis5,6,7. Here we report that IL-1R8 serves as a checkpoint for NK cell maturation and effector function. Its genetic blockade unleashes NK-cell-mediated resistance to hepatic carcinogenesis, haematogenous liver and lung metastasis, and cytomegalovirus infection."
https://openalex.org/W2767103112,"Direct lineage conversion offers a new strategy for tissue regeneration and disease modelling. Despite recent success in directly reprogramming fibroblasts into various cell types, the precise changes that occur as fibroblasts progressively convert to the target cell fates remain unclear. The inherent heterogeneity and asynchronous nature of the reprogramming process renders it difficult to study this process using bulk genomic techniques. Here we used single-cell RNA sequencing to overcome this limitation and analysed global transcriptome changes at early stages during the reprogramming of mouse fibroblasts into induced cardiomyocytes (iCMs). Using unsupervised dimensionality reduction and clustering algorithms, we identified molecularly distinct subpopulations of cells during reprogramming. We also constructed routes of iCM formation, and delineated the relationship between cell proliferation and iCM induction. Further analysis of global gene expression changes during reprogramming revealed unexpected downregulation of factors involved in mRNA processing and splicing. Detailed functional analysis of the top candidate splicing factor, Ptbp1, revealed that it is a critical barrier for the acquisition of cardiomyocyte-specific splicing patterns in fibroblasts. Concomitantly, Ptbp1 depletion promoted cardiac transcriptome acquisition and increased iCM reprogramming efficiency. Additional quantitative analysis of our dataset revealed a strong correlation between the expression of each reprogramming factor and the progress of individual cells through the reprogramming process, and led to the discovery of new surface markers for the enrichment of iCMs. In summary, our single-cell transcriptomics approaches enabled us to reconstruct the reprogramming trajectory and to uncover intermediate cell populations, gene pathways and regulators involved in iCM induction."

https://openalex.org/W2766084746,"Pressure-driven shock waves in solid materials can cause extreme damage and deformation. Understanding this deformation and the associated defects that are created in the material is crucial in the study of a wide range of phenomena, including planetary formation and asteroid impact sites, the formation of interstellar dust clouds, ballistic penetrators, spacecraft shielding and ductility in high-performance ceramics. At the lattice level, the basic mechanisms of plastic deformation are twinning (whereby crystallites with a mirror-image lattice form) and slip (whereby lattice dislocations are generated and move), but determining which of these mechanisms is active during deformation is challenging. Experiments that characterized lattice defects have typically examined the microstructure of samples after deformation, and so are complicated by post-shock annealing and reverberations. In addition, measurements have been limited to relatively modest pressures (less than 100 gigapascals). In situ X-ray diffraction experiments can provide insights into the dynamic behaviour of materials, but have only recently been applied to plasticity during shock compression and have yet to provide detailed insight into competing deformation mechanisms. Here we present X-ray diffraction experiments with femtosecond resolution that capture in situ, lattice-level information on the microstructural processes that drive shock-wave-driven deformation. To demonstrate this method we shock-compress the body-centred-cubic material tantalum-an important material for high-energy-density physics owing to its high shock impedance and high X-ray opacity. Tantalum is also a material for which previous shock compression simulations and experiments have provided conflicting information about the dominant deformation mechanism. Our experiments reveal twinning and related lattice rotation occurring on the timescale of tens of picoseconds. In addition, despite the common association between twinning and strong shocks, we find a transition from twinning to dislocation-slip-dominated plasticity at high pressure (more than 150 gigapascals), a regime that recovery experiments cannot accurately access. The techniques demonstrated here will be useful for studying shock waves and other high-strain-rate phenomena, as well as a broad range of processes induced by plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2766216977,"Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a key molecule in focal adhesions and regulates fundamental processes in cells such as growth, survival, and migration. FAK is one of the first molecules recruited to focal adhesions in response to external mechanical stimuli and therefore is a pivotal mediator of cell mechanosignaling, and relays these stimuli to other mechanotransducers within the cytoplasm. Yes-associated protein (YAP) has been identified recently as one of these core mechanotransducers. YAP translocates to the nucleus following changes in cell mechanics to promote the expression of genes implicated in motility, apoptosis, proliferation, and organ growth. Here, we show that FAK controls the nuclear translocation and activation of YAP in response to mechanical activation and submit that the YAP-dependent process of durotaxis requires a cell with an asymmetric distribution of active and inactive FAK molecules.-Lachowski, D., Cortes, E., Robinson, B., Rice, A., Rombouts, K., Del Rio Hernandez, A. E. FAK controls the mechanical activation of YAP, a transcriptional regulator required for durotaxis."
https://openalex.org/W2765972933,"The regulation of size, volume and mass in living cells is physiologically important, and dysregulation of these parameters gives rise to many diseases. Cell mass is largely determined by the amount of water, proteins, lipids, carbohydrates and nucleic acids present in a cell, and is tightly linked to metabolism, proliferation and gene expression. Technologies have emerged in recent years that make it possible to track the masses of single suspended cells and adherent cells. However, it has not been possible to track individual adherent cells in physiological conditions at the mass and time resolutions required to observe fast cellular dynamics. Here we introduce a cell balance (a 'picobalance'), based on an optically excited microresonator, that measures the total mass of single or multiple adherent cells in culture conditions over days with millisecond time resolution and picogram mass sensitivity. Using our technique, we observe that the mass of living mammalian cells fluctuates intrinsically by around one to four per cent over timescales of seconds throughout the cell cycle. Perturbation experiments link these mass fluctuations to the basic cellular processes of ATP synthesis and water transport. Furthermore, we show that growth and cell cycle progression are arrested in cells infected with vaccinia virus, but mass fluctuations continue until cell death. Our measurements suggest that all living cells show fast and subtle mass fluctuations throughout the cell cycle. As our cell balance is easy to handle and compatible with fluorescence microscopy, we anticipate that our approach will contribute to the understanding of cell mass regulation in various cell states and across timescales, which is important in areas including physiology, cancer research, stem-cell differentiation and drug discovery."
https://openalex.org/W2766896536,"T helper 17 (TH17) cells are critically involved in host defence, inflammation, and autoimmunity. Transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) is instrumental in TH17 cell differentiation by cooperating with interleukin-6 (refs 6, 7). Yet, the mechanism by which TGFβ enables TH17 cell differentiation remains elusive. Here we reveal that TGFβ enables TH17 cell differentiation by reversing SKI-SMAD4-mediated suppression of the expression of the retinoic acid receptor (RAR)-related orphan receptor γt (RORγt). We found that, unlike wild-type T cells, SMAD4-deficient T cells differentiate into TH17 cells in the absence of TGFβ signalling in a RORγt-dependent manner. Ectopic SMAD4 expression suppresses RORγt expression and TH17 cell differentiation of SMAD4-deficient T cells. However, TGFβ neutralizes SMAD4-mediated suppression without affecting SMAD4 binding to the Rorc locus. Proteomic analysis revealed that SMAD4 interacts with SKI, a transcriptional repressor that is degraded upon TGFβ stimulation. SKI controls histone acetylation and deacetylation of the Rorc locus and TH17 cell differentiation via SMAD4: ectopic SKI expression inhibits H3K9 acetylation of the Rorc locus, Rorc expression, and TH17 cell differentiation in a SMAD4-dependent manner. Therefore, TGFβ-induced disruption of SKI reverses SKI-SMAD4-mediated suppression of RORγt to enable TH17 cell differentiation. This study reveals a critical mechanism by which TGFβ controls TH17 cell differentiation and uncovers the SKI-SMAD4 axis as a potential therapeutic target for treating TH17-related diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2765732860,"Marine ice-cliff instability (MICI) processes could accelerate future retreat of the Antarctic Ice Sheet if ice shelves that buttress grounding lines more than 800 metres below sea level are lost. The present-day grounding zones of the Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers in West Antarctica need to retreat only short distances before they reach extensive retrograde slopes. When grounding zones of glaciers retreat onto such slopes, theoretical considerations and modelling results indicate that the retreat becomes unstable (marine ice-sheet instability) and thus accelerates. It is thought that MICI is triggered when this retreat produces ice cliffs above the water line with heights approaching about 90 metres. However, observational evidence confirming the action of MICI has not previously been reported. Here we present observational evidence that rapid deglacial ice-sheet retreat into Pine Island Bay proceeded in a similar manner to that simulated in a recent modelling study, driven by MICI. Iceberg-keel plough marks on the sea-floor provide geological evidence of past and present iceberg morphology, keel depth and drift direction. From the planform shape and cross-sectional morphologies of iceberg-keel plough marks, we find that iceberg calving during the most recent deglaciation was not characterized by small numbers of large, tabular icebergs as is observed today, which would produce wide, flat-based plough marks or toothcomb-like multi-keeled plough marks. Instead, it was characterized by large numbers of smaller icebergs with V-shaped keels. Geological evidence of the form and water-depth distribution of the plough marks indicates calving-margin thicknesses equivalent to the threshold that is predicted to trigger ice-cliff structural collapse as a result of MICI. We infer rapid and sustained ice-sheet retreat driven by MICI, commencing around 12,300 years ago and terminating before about 11,200 years ago, which produced large numbers of icebergs smaller than the typical tabular icebergs produced today. Our findings demonstrate the effective operation of MICI in the past, and highlight its potential contribution to accelerated future retreat of the Antarctic Ice Sheet."
https://openalex.org/W2767129564,"Blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption plays a critical role in brain injury induced by cerebral ischemia, and preserving BBB integrity during ischemia could alleviate cerebral injury. We examined the role of miR-130a in ischemic BBB disruption by using models of rat middle cerebral artery occlusion and cell oxygen–glucose deprivation. We found that ischemia significantly increased microRNA-130a (miR-130a) level and that miR-130a was predominantly from brain microvascular endothelial cells. Antagomir-130a, an antagonist of miR-130a, could attenuate brain edema, lower BBB permeability, reduce infarct volume, and improve neurologic function. MiR-130a overexpression induced by miR-130a mimic increased monolayer permeability, and intercellular inhibition of miR-130a by a miR-130a inhibitor suppressed oxygen–glucose deprivation–induced increase in monolayer permeability. Moreover, dual luciferase reporter system showed that Homeobox A5 was the direct target of miR-130a. MiR-130a, by inhibiting Homeobox A5 expression, could down-regulate occludin, thereby increasing BBB permeability. Our results suggested that miR-130a might be implicated in ischemia-induced BBB dysfunction and serve as a target for the treatment of ischemic stroke.—Wang, Y., Wang, M.-D., Xia, Y.-P., Gao, Y., Zhu, Y.-Y., Chen, S.-C., Mao, L., He, Q.-W., Yue, Z.-Y., Hu, B.

https://openalex.org/W2765985238,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common chronic degenerative disease characterized by degeneration in the joints and subsequent destruction of cartilage and bone, yet much remains to be elucidated regarding its molecular mechanism. Ghrelin is a recently discovered neuropeptide with anti-inflammatory actions, but it is unknown whether ghrelin is involved in OA. Human primary chondrocyte and cartilage samples were collected from patients with OA, and the expression pattern of ghrelin was assessed. Human chondrocyte and cartilage samples were stimulated with IL-1β and TNF-α, and exogenous ghrelin-alleviated disorganization of catabolism and anabolism were mediated by IL-1β and TNF-α. Destabilization of the medial meniscus and anterior cruciate ligament transection models were established in wild-type mice that were administered ghrelin or PBS. Severity of inflammation and degeneration in the joints were determined by measuring the levels of various inflammatory cytokines and degeneration-associated molecules. Ghrelin down-regulated the production of various inflammatory cytokines, inhibited apoptosis of chondrocytes, decreased the levels of metalloproteinases (including matrix metalloproteinase-13 and a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motif-5), and maintained the expression of critical matrix components, such as aggrecan and collagen 2. Moreover, suppression of the Akt signaling pathway and activation of NF-κB signaling in chondrocytes during OA development was antagonized by ghrelin administration. This supports the assessment of ghrelin as a potential therapeutic approach to treat degenerative cartilage diseases, including OA.-Qu, R., Chen, X., Wang, W., Qiu, C., Ban, M., Guo, L., Vasilev, K., Chen, J., Li, W., Zhao, Y.

https://openalex.org/W2766445662,"Objective Preterm birth is the main reason for neonatal deaths worldwide. We investigate whether maternal gut microbiota may play a previously overlooked role. Methods The Norwegian Microbiota Study (NoMIC) is a case control study on preterm birth (<259 days of gestation, calculated primarily based on the last menstrual period), including two consecutively born term infants per infant born prematurely. Eligible mothers were fluent in Norwegian and recruited from the maternity ward at a county hospital in Eastern Norway in the period 2002–2005. Fecal samples were collected at day 4 postpartum, and analyzed using 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. We used samples from 121 mothers giving birth vaginally. Measures of alpha diversity (Shannon, Phylogenetic Diversity and Observed Operational Taxonomic Units) and microbiome composition were combined with information from the Medical Birth Registry, pregnancy journals, and questionnaires. Results The association between maternal gut diversity and preterm delivery was examined using logistic regression. One IQR increase in Shannon diversity was significantly associated with 38% lower odds of spontaneous preterm birth, (95% confident interval (CI): 1%, 61%), and the association was stronger when adjusting for maternal age, marital status, ethnicity, parity, BMI, education, antibiotic use, pets in the household, income and smoking (48% lower odds, 95% CI: 4.2%, 72%). Mothers delivering prematurely also had lower abundance of OTUs belonging to Bifidobacterium and Streptococcus, and of the Clostridiales order. Conclusion Analysis of maternal gut microbiota using next-generation sequencing shows that low gut diversity, with a distinct microbial composition, is associated with spontaneous preterm delivery."
https://openalex.org/W2766555262,"NOD-like receptor family caspase recruitment domain family domain containing 5 (NLRC5) has important roles in inflammation and innate immunity. NLRC5 was highly expressed in kidney from streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice, db/ db mice and patients with diabetes. Based on that evidence, the present study was designed to explore the roles of NLRC5 in the progression of diabetic nephropathy (DN). We examined kidney injury, including inflammation and fibrosis in Nlrc5 gene knockout ( Nlrc5-/-) and wild-type (WT) diabetic mice. We found that Nlrc5-/- mice developed less-severe diabetic kidney injury compared with WT mice, exhibiting lower albuminuria, less fibronectin and collagen IV expression, and reduced macrophage infiltration but greater levels of podocin and nephrin in the diabetic kidney. The underlying mechanisms were further investigated in vitro with peritoneal macrophages and mesangial cells treated with high glucose. Reduced proinflammatory effect was observed in peritoneal macrophages from Nlrc5-/- mice, associated with NF-κB pathway suppression. Knocking down of NLRC5 in mesangial cells in high-glucose conditions was also associated with reduced NF-κB and TGF-β/Smad signaling. Taken together, NLRC5 promotes inflammation and fibrosis during DN progression partly through the effects on NF-κB and TGF-β/Smad pathways. NLRC5 may, therefore, be a promising therapeutic target for DN treatment.-Luan, P., Zhuang, J., Zou, J., Li, H., Shuai, P., Xu, X., Zhao, Y., Kou, W., Ji, S., Peng, A., Xu, Y., Su, Q., Jian, W., Peng, W.

Even less research addresses the effect of gifts on the prescribing behavior of nurse practitioners (NPs), physician assistants (PAs), and podiatrists.To analyze the association between gifts provided by pharmaceutical companies to individual prescribers in Washington DC and the number of prescriptions, cost of prescriptions, and proportion of branded prescriptions for each prescriber.Gifts data from the District of Columbia's (DC) AccessRx program and the federal Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Open Payments program were analyzed with claims data from the CMS 2013 Medicare Provider Utilization and Payment Data.Washington DC, 2013.Physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, podiatrists, and other licensed Medicare Part D prescribers who participated in Medicare Part D (a Federal prescription drug program that covers patients over age 65 or who are disabled).Gifts to healthcare prescribers (including cash, meals, and ownership interests) from pharmaceutical companies.Average number of Medicare Part D claims per prescriber, number of claims per patient, cost per claim, and proportion of branded claims.In 2013, 1,122 (39.1%) of 2,873 Medicare Part D prescribers received gifts from pharmaceutical companies totaling $3.9 million in 2013. Compared to non-gift recipients, gift recipients prescribed 2.3 more claims per patient, prescribed medications costing $50 more per claim, and prescribed 7.8% more branded drugs. In six specialties (General Internal Medicine, Family Medicine, Obstetrics/Gynecology, Urology, Ophthalmology, and Dermatology), gifts were associated with a significantly increased average cost of claims. For Internal Medicine, Family Medicine, and Ophthalmology, gifts were associated with more branded claims. Gift acceptance was associated with increased average cost per claim for PAs and NPs. Gift acceptance was also associated with higher proportion of branded claims for PAs but not NPs. Physicians who received small gifts (less than $500 annually) had more expensive claims ($114 vs. $85) and more branded claims (30.3% vs. 25.7%) than physicians who received no gifts. Those receiving large gifts (greater than $500 annually) had the highest average costs per claim ($189) and branded claims (39.9%) than other groups. All differences were statistically significant (p<0.05).Gifts from pharmaceutical companies are associated with more prescriptions per patient, more costly prescriptions, and a higher proportion of branded prescriptions with variation across specialties. Gifts of any size had an effect and larger gifts elicited a larger impact on prescribing behaviors. Our study confirms and expands on previous work showing that industry gifts are associated with more expensive prescriptions and more branded prescriptions. Industry gifts influence prescribing behavior, may have adverse public health implications, and should be banned."

We describe the conflict experiences of men and women from the general population of Bougainville Papua New Guinea, perceptions of the enduring impact of conflict, and the associations between these and the major health and development problems on the islands: mental ill-health and violence against women.Fourteen years after the end of the decade long civil war, we conducted a household survey with a random sample of adult (n = 864) men and (n = 879) women living in Bougainville. The interviews were mostly conducted face-to-face, with very sensitive questions self-completed.Mental ill-health was highly prevalent, 37.8% of women and 32% of men had high levels of depressive symptomatology, 34.4% of men abused alcohol and 15.1% of women and 24.6% of men had high levels of PTSD symptoms. Among women, 23.3% had been raped in the year prior to the interview and 33.3% had experience physical or sexual partner violence. The prevalence of exposure to trauma during the civil war was very high and many of the men and women experienced lingering impact of conflict. Multiple logistic regression models showed that war trauma was associated with PTSD symptoms in women and PTSD symptoms, alcohol abuse and depressive symptoms in men. The perceived enduring impact of conflict was associated with depressive symptoms in men and women, problem drinking and suicidal thoughts in women and drug use in men. The perceived enduring conflict impact was associated with perpetration of past year rape and physical and/or sexual partner violence.The Bougainville civil war had a devastating impact on the population's lives. Reversing this legacy is essential but requires addressing what is perceived as the enduring social, economic and psychological impact of the conflict and a major focus on prevention of violence against women."
https://openalex.org/W2766457898,"A large reef manta ray (Manta alfredi) aggregation has been observed off the north Sudanese Red Sea coast since the 1950s. Sightings have been predominantly within the boundaries of a marine protected area (MPA), which was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in July 2016. Contrasting economic development trajectories have been proposed for the area (small-scale ecotourism and large-scale island development). To examine space-use, Wildlife Computers® SPOT 5 tags were secured to three manta rays. A two-state switching Bayesian state space model (BSSM), that allowed movement parameters to switch between resident and travelling, was fit to the recorded locations, and 50% and 95% kernel utilization distributions (KUD) home ranges calculated. A total of 682 BSSM locations were recorded between 30 October 2012 and 6 November 2013. Of these, 98.5% fell within the MPA boundaries; 99.5% for manta 1, 91.5% for manta 2, and 100% for manta 3. The BSSM identified that all three mantas were resident during 99% of transmissions, with 50% and 95% KUD home ranges falling mainly within the MPA boundaries. For all three mantas combined (88.4%), and all individuals (manta 1-92.4%, manta 2-64.9%, manta 3-91.9%), the majority of locations occurred within 15 km of the proposed large-scale island development. Results indicated that the MPA boundaries are spatially appropriate for manta rays in the region, however, a close association to the proposed large-scale development highlights the potential threat of disruption. Conversely, the focused nature of spatial use highlights the potential for reliable ecotourism opportunities."

What do they perceive? We investigated this question in oysters Magallana gigas (Crassostrea gigas) using pure tone exposures, accelerometer fixed on the oyster shell and hydrophone in the water column. Groups of 16 oysters were exposed to quantifiable waterborne sinusoidal sounds in the range of 10 Hz to 20 kHz at various acoustic energies. The experiment was conducted in running seawater using an experimental flume equipped with suspended loudspeakers. The sensitivity of the oysters was measured by recording their valve movements by high-frequency noninvasive valvometry. The tests were 3 min tone exposures including a 70 sec fade-in period. Three endpoints were analysed: the ratio of responding individuals in the group, the resulting changes of valve opening amplitude and the response latency. At high enough acoustic energy, oysters transiently closed their valves in response to frequencies in the range of 10 to <1000 Hz, with maximum sensitivity from 10 to 200 Hz. The minimum acoustic energy required to elicit a response was 0.02 m∙s-2 at 122 dBrms re 1 μPa for frequencies ranging from 10 to 80 Hz. As a partial valve closure cannot be differentiated from a nociceptive response, it is very likely that oysters detect sounds at lower acoustic energy. The mechanism involved in sound detection and the ecological consequences are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2766433128,"Increasing evidence suggests a crucial role of inflammation in cytokine-mediated β-cell dysfunction and death in type 1 diabetes mellitus, although the mechanisms are incompletely understood. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a multifunctional bioactive sphingolipid involved in the development of many autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Here, we investigated the role of intracellular S1P in insulin-secreting INS1E cells by genetically manipulating the S1P-metabolizing enzyme S1P lyase (SPL). The expression of spl was down-regulated by cytokines in INS1E cells and rat islets. Overexpression of SPL protected against cytokine toxicity. Interestingly, the SPL overexpression did not suppress the cytokine-induced NFκB-iNOS-NO pathway but attenuated calcium leakage from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stores as manifested by lower cytosolic calcium levels, higher expression of the ER protein Sec61a, decreased dephosphorylation of Bcl-2–associated death promoter (Bad) protein, and weaker caspase-3 activation in cytokine-treated (IL-1β, TNFα, and IFNγ) cells. This coincided with reduced cytokine-mediated ER stress, indicated by measurements of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (chop) and immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein (bip) levels. Moreover, cytokine-treated SPL-overexpressing cells exhibited increased expression of prohibitin 2 (Phb2), involved in the regulation of mitochondrial assembly and respiration.

https://openalex.org/W2765133302,"Mechanosensory transduction by vertebrate hair cells depends on a protein complex at the tips of shorter stereocilia associated with mechanoelectrical transduction channels activated by tip links in the hair bundle. In mammalian hair cells, this complex includes transmembrane channel-like protein subunit 1 (TMC1), lipoma HMGIC fusion partner-like 5 protein (LHFPL5) and protocadherin 15 (PCDH15), a lower-end component of the tip link. TMC1 interacts with LHFPL5 and PCDH15 but how the complex develops to maturity, and the relationships between these proteins, remains uncertain. Here we evaluate the spatiotemporal development of LHFPL5 distributions in mouse cochlear hair bundles by immunofluorescence and immunogold transmission electron microscopy, from postnatal day 0 (P0) through P21 in wild type and PCDH15-deficient mice. At P0, hair bundles contain many short microvilli-like processes which we term unranked stereocilia, and a subset of lengthening rows, adjacent to a kinocilium. LHFPL5 is distributed throughout the bundle, including on stereocilia tips and the kinocilium. At P3, 4-to-6 rows of ranked stereocilia are evident, total LHFPL5 expression peaks, and LHFPL5 is localised to ranked stereocilia tips of all rows and to lower shaft/ankle links. By P12, the bundle has a mature pattern with 3 ranked rows but virtually no unranked stereocilia or kinocilium; LHFPL5 expression has declined and become restricted to the tips of shorter stereocilia. Throughout development from P0, expression of LHFPL5 is greater overall on apical than basal bundles, but there is, on average, an equal amount of labelling per labelled tip. In P3 mice lacking PCDH15, LHFPL5 labelling is not at the tips but is primarily on unranked stereocilia and lower lateral links. These data show that LHFPL5 is already present in the MET apparatus at P0 but requires PCDH15 at P3 to remain there. Shaft/ankle link localisation suggests it interacts with link proteins other than PCDH15."
https://openalex.org/W2765740226,"Scientists who perform environmental research on policy-relevant topics face challenges when communicating about how values may have influenced their research. This study examines how citizens view scientists who publicly acknowledge values. Specifically, we investigate whether it matters: if citizens share or oppose a scientist's values, if a scientist's conclusions seem contrary to or consistent with the scientist's values, and if a scientist is assessing the state of the science or making a policy recommendation. We conducted two 3x2 factorial design online experiments. Experiment 1 featured a hypothetical scientist assessing the state of the science on the public-health effects of exposure to Bisphenol A (BPA), and Experiment 2 featured a scientist making a policy recommendation on use of BPA. We manipulated whether or not the scientist expressed values and whether the scientist's conclusion appeared contrary to or consistent with the scientist's values, and we accounted for whether or not subjects' values aligned with the scientist's values. We analyzed our data with ordinary least squares (OLS) regression techniques. Our results provide at least preliminary evidence that acknowledging values may reduce the perceived credibility of scientists within the general public, but this effect differs depending on whether scientists and citizens share values, whether scientists draw conclusions that run contrary to their values, and whether scientists make policy recommendations."

Signaling events that result in the inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3)β represent an adaptive response that might limit the extent of adverse remodeling in the aftermath of AMI. Here, we report that an allosteric inhibitor of GSK-3β, 4-benzyl-2-(naphthalene-1-yl)-1,2,4-thiadiazolidine-3,5-dione (NP12), lessens the magnitude of adverse myocardial remodeling and promotes angiogenesis. Male and female mice 8–10 weeks old were grouped (six animals in each group) into sham surgery (sham group), left anterior descending (LAD) ligation of the coronary artery followed by intramyocardial PBS injections (control group), and LAD ligation followed by NP12 administration (NP12 group). After 7 and 14 days, the extents of fibrosis and integrity of blood vessels were determined. Intramyocardial administration of NP12 increased phosphorylation of GSK-3β, reduced fibrosis, and restored diastolic function in the mice that had experienced an AMI. Morphometric analyses revealed increased CD31+ and Ki67+ vascular structures and decreased apoptosis in these mice. NP12 administration mediated proliferation of reparative cells in the AMI hearts. In a time-course analysis, Wnt3a and NP12 stabilized β-catenin and increased expression of both Nanog and VEGFR2. Moreover, NP12 increased the expression of β-catenin and Nanog in myocardium from AMI mice. Finally, loss- and gain-of-function experiments indicated that the NP12-mediated benefit is, in part, Nanog-specific. These findings indicate that NP12 reduces fibrosis, reestablishes coronary blood flow, and improves ventricular function following an AMI. We conclude that NP12 might be useful for limiting ventricular remodeling after an AMI. A key feature of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is an alteration in cardiac architecture.

https://openalex.org/W2766108361,"A palaeosurface with one megatheropod trackway and several theropod tracks and trackways from the Lower Jurassic upper Elliot Formation (Stormberg Group, Karoo Supergroup) in western Lesotho is described. The majority of the theropod tracks are referable to either Eubrontes or Kayentapus based on their morphological characteristics. The larger megatheropod tracks are 57 cm long and have no Southern Hemisphere equivalent. Morphologically, they are more similar to the Early Jurassic Kayentapus, as well as the much younger Upper Cretaceous ichnogenus Irenesauripus, than to other contemporaneous ichnogenera in southern Africa. Herein they have been placed within the ichnogenus Kayentapus and described as a new ichnospecies (Kayentapus ambrokholohali). The tracks are preserved on ripple marked, very fine-grained sandstone of the Lower Jurassic upper Elliot Formation, and thus were made after the end-Triassic mass extinction event (ETE). This new megatheropod trackway site marks the first occurrence of very large carnivorous dinosaurs (estimated body length >8-9 meters) in the Early Jurassic of southern Gondwana, an evolutionary strategy that was repeatedly pursued and amplified in the following ~135 million years, until the next major biotic crisis at the end-Cretaceous."
https://openalex.org/W2765930298,"Background 
There is much evidence showing that childhood socioeconomic position is associated with physical health in adulthood; however existing evidence on how early life disadvantage is associated with adult mental wellbeing is inconsistent. This paper investigated whether childhood socioeconomic position (SEP) is associated with adult mental wellbeing and to what extent any association is explained by adult SEP using harmonised data from four British birth cohort studies.


Methods 
The sample comprised 20,717 participants with mental wellbeing data in the Hertfordshire Cohort Study (HCS), the MRC National Survey of Health and Development (NSHD), the National Child Development Study (NCDS), and the British Cohort Study (BCS70). Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS) scores at age 73 (HCS), 60–64 (NSHD), 50 (NCDS), or 42 (BCS70) were used. Harmonised socioeconomic position (Registrar General’s Social Classification) was ascertained in childhood (age 10/11) and adulthood (age 42/43). Associations between childhood SEP, adult SEP, and wellbeing were tested using linear regression and multi-group structural equation models.


Results 
More advantaged father’s social class was associated with better adult mental wellbeing in the BCS70 and the NCDS. This association was independent of adult SEP in the BCS70 but fully mediated by adult SEP in the NCDS. There was no evidence of an association between father’s social class and adult mental wellbeing in the HCS or the NSHD.


Conclusions 
Socioeconomic conditions in childhood are directly and indirectly, through adult socioeconomic pathways, associated with adult mental wellbeing, but findings from these harmonised data suggest this association may depend on cohort or age."
https://openalex.org/W2765698691,"Tumor cells display on their surface several molecular chaperones that normally reside in the endoplasmic reticulum. Because this display is unique to cancer cells, these chaperones are attractive targets for drug development. Previous epitope-mapping of autoantibodies (AutoAbs) from prostate cancer patients identified the 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78) as one such target. Although we previously showed that anti-GRP78 AutoAbs increase tissue factor (TF) procoagulant activity on the surface of tumor cells, the direct effect of TF activation on tumor growth was not examined. In this study, we explore the interplay between the AutoAbs against cell surface–associated GRP78, TF expression/activity, and prostate cancer progression. First, we show that tumor GRP78 expression correlates with disease stage and that anti-GRP78 AutoAb levels parallel prostate-specific antigen concentrations in patient-derived serum samples. Second, we demonstrate that these anti-GRP78 AutoAbs target cell-surface GRP78, activating the unfolded protein response and inducing tumor cell proliferation through a TF-dependent mechanism, a specific effect reversed by neutralization or immunodepletion of the AutoAb pool. Finally, these AutoAbs enhance tumor growth in mice bearing human prostate cancer xenografts, and heparin derivatives specifically abrogate this effect by blocking AutoAb binding to cell-surface GRP78 and decreasing TF expression/activity. Together, these results establish a molecular mechanism in which AutoAbs against cell-surface GRP78 drive TF-mediated tumor progression in an experimental model of prostate cancer. Heparin derivatives counteract this mechanism and, as such, represent potentially appealing compounds to be evaluated in well-designed translational clinical trials."

This dynamic localization is driven by MinD-catalyzed ATP hydrolysis, stimulated by interactions with MinE’s anti-MinCD domain. This domain is buried in the 6-β–stranded MinE “closed” structure, but is liberated for interactions with MinD, giving rise to a 4-β–stranded “open” structure through an unknown mechanism. Here we show that MinE–membrane interactions induce a structural change into a state resembling the open conformation. However, MinE mutants lacking the MinE membrane-targeting sequence stimulated higher ATP hydrolysis rates than the full-length protein, indicating that binding to MinD is sufficient to trigger this conformational transition in MinE. In contrast, conformational change between the open and closed states did not affect stimulation of ATP hydrolysis rates in the absence of membrane binding, although the MinD-binding residue Ile-25 is critical for this conformational transition. We therefore propose an updated model where MinE is brought to the membrane through interactions with MinD. After stimulation of ATP hydrolysis, MinE remains bound to the membrane in a state that does not catalyze additional rounds of ATP hydrolysis. Although the molecular basis for this inhibited state is unknown, previous observations of higher-order MinE self-association may explain this inhibition.

Motivated by an interest in understanding the survivability of anaerobic microorganisms under Martian conditions, we investigated the responses of a new isolate, Yersinia intermedia MASE-LG-1 to individual and combined stresses associated with the Martian surface. This organism belongs to an adaptable and persistent genus of anaerobic microorganisms found in many environments worldwide. The effects of desiccation, low pressure, ionizing radiation, varying temperature, osmotic pressure, and oxidizing chemical compounds were investigated. The strain showed a high tolerance to desiccation, with a decline of survivability by four orders of magnitude during a storage time of 85 days. Exposure to X-rays resulted in dose-dependent inactivation for exposure up to 600 Gy while applied doses above 750 Gy led to complete inactivation. The effects of the combination of desiccation and irradiation were additive and the survivability was influenced by the order in which they were imposed. Ionizing irradiation and subsequent desiccation was more deleterious than vice versa. By contrast, the presence of perchlorates was not found to significantly affect the survival of the Yersinia strain after ionizing radiation. These data show that the organism has the capacity to survive and grow in physical and chemical stresses, imposed individually or in combination that are associated with Martian environment. Eventually it lost its viability showing that many of the most adaptable anaerobic organisms on Earth would be killed on Mars today."

Its non-conserved regions, which are located between the conserved domains and at the C terminus, contain sites for phosphorylation by multiple protein kinases. Truncation analyses of the non-conserved regions showed that they are not essential for the catalytic activity of Pah1 and its physiological functions (e.g. triacylglycerol synthesis). This analysis also revealed that the C-terminal region contains a previously unrecognized WRDPLVDID domain (residues 637-645) that is conserved in yeast, mice, and humans. The deletion of this domain had no effect on the catalytic activity of Pah1 but caused the loss of its in vivo function.

Overall, phosphorylation of Pah1 favors phospholipid synthesis at the expense of TAG synthesis, and its dephosphorylation favors TAG synthesis at the expense of phospholipid synthesis (3Pascual F.

Chem. 2007; 282: 37026-37035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). The enzyme contains two non-conserved regions, one located between the conserved domains and the other at the C terminus. These non-conserved regions contain multiple sites of phosphorylation by different protein kinases (Fig. 1B). In this work, we performed a mutational analysis of the non-conserved regions to gain further insight into the role of the regions for Pah1 function. This analysis showed that the non-conserved N- and C-terminal regions are not essential for PAP activity and TAG production and for the function of Pah1 in the complementation of the pah1Δ temperature-sensitive phenotype. We identified a WRDPLVDID domain at the boundary of the C-terminal non-conserved region that is required for Pah1 function in vivo. In particular, the tryptophan residue of the domain, which is conserved in orthologous PAP enzymes (i.e. lipins) from mice and humans, is essential for Pah1 function in TAG synthesis. The mutations of the tryptophan residue did not abolish the catalytic activity of Pah1, demonstrating that PAP activity is required for, but not sufficient for, the physiological function of Pah1. We undertook an unbiased approach to examine the importance of the N- and C-terminal non-conserved regions of Pah1 (Fig. 1, gray) for its PAP activity and physiological function. A series of mutations (Table 1) were introduced into the coding sequence of PAH1, and the mutant alleles were expressed on a low-copy plasmid in the pah1Δ mutant that lacks the wild-type enzyme (Table 2). For experiments to evaluate the effects of the mutations on PAP activity, the mutant enzymes were expressed in pah1Δ app1Δ dpp1Δ lpp1Δ quadruple mutant cells (43Chae M. Han G.-S. Carman G.M.

Forward loss of balance was achieved by releasing participants (14 older adults and 6 younger adults) from a static whole-body forward lean angle of approximately 18 degrees. 10 older adults and 6 younger adults were able to recover with a single step and included in subsequent analysis. A scalable anatomical model consisting of 36 degrees-of-freedom was used to compute kinematics and joint moments from motion capture and force plate data. Forces for 92 muscle actuators were computed using Static Optimisation and Induced Acceleration Analysis was used to compute individual muscle contributions to the three-dimensional acceleration of the whole body COM. There were no significant differences between older and younger adults in step length, step time, 3D COM accelerations or muscle contributions to 3D COM accelerations. The stance and stepping leg Gastrocnemius and Soleus muscles were primarily responsible for the vertical acceleration experienced by the COM. The Gastrocnemius and Soleus from the stance side leg together with bilateral Hamstrings accelerated the COM forwards throughout balance recovery while the Vasti and Soleus of the stepping side leg provided the majority of braking accelerations following foot contact. The Hip Abductor muscles provided the greatest contribution to medial-lateral accelerations of the COM. Deficits in the neuromuscular control of the Gastrocnemius, Soleus, Vasti and Hip Abductors in particular could adversely influence balance recovery and may be important targets in interventions to improve balance recovery performance."
https://openalex.org/W2766815910,"Molecular oscillators are important cellular regulators of, for example, circadian clocks, oscillations of immune regulators, and short-period (ultradian) rhythms during embryonic development. The Notch signaling factor HES1 (hairy and enhancer of split 1) is a well-known repressor of proneural genes, and HES1 ultradian oscillation is essential for keeping cells in an efficiently proliferating progenitor state. HES1 oscillation is driven by both transcriptional self-repression and ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. However, the E3 ubiquitin ligase targeting HES1 for proteolysis remains unclear. Based on siRNA-mediated gene silencing screening, co-immunoprecipitation, and ubiquitination assays, we discovered that the E3 ubiquitin ligase SCFFBXL14 complex regulates HES1 ubiquitination and proteolysis. siRNA-mediated knockdown of the Cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligases RBX1 or CUL1 increased HES1 protein levels, prolonged its half-life, and dampened its oscillation. FBXL14, an F-box protein for SCF ubiquitin ligase, associates with HES1. FBXL14 silencing stabilized HES1, whereas FBXL14 overexpression decreased HES1 protein levels. Of note, the SCFFBXL14 complex promoted the ubiquitination of HES1 in vivo, and a conserved WRPW motif in HES1 was essential for HES1 binding to FBXL14 and for ubiquitin-dependent HES1 degradation. HES1 knockdown promoted neuronal differentiation, but FBXL14 silencing inhibited neuronal differentiation induced by HES1 ablation in mES and F9 cells. Our results suggest that SCFFBXL14 promotes neuronal differentiation by targeting HES1 for ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis and that the C-terminal WRPW motif in HES1 is required for this process."

Here we present a detailed description and inferred taxonomic relationship of the specimen. The present study revealed that the articulated skeleton belongs to the family Ophthalmosauridae. The new discovery from India further improves the depauperate fossil record of ichthyosaurs from the former Gondwanan continents. Based on the preserved length of the axial skeleton and anterior part of the snout and taking into account the missing parts of the skull and postflexural region, it is suggested that the specimen may represent an adult possibly reaching a length of 5.0–5.5 m. The widespread occurrence of ophthalmosaurids in the Upper Jurassic deposits of western Tethys, Madagascar, South America and India points to possible faunal exchanges between the western Tethys and Gondwanan continents through a southern seaway."

The caudal vertebrae have a unique longitudinal canal within the neural arch. The carpometacarpus, with metacarpal III occupying about one third of the width of the carpometacarpus, shows the most plesiomorphic stage of the evolution of the forelimb among known alvarezsaurids. The proximal phalanx of manual digit II differs from the corresponding bone in Parvicursorinae in having a less asymmetrical proximal articular surface without a dorsal process and short ventral ridges. The ungual phalanx of manual digit II has laterally open ventral foramina.

https://openalex.org/W2765749173,"Former studies relying on hydrogen/deuterium exchange analysis suggest that DnaC bound to DnaB alters the conformation of the N-terminal domain (NTD) of DnaB to impair the ability of this DNA helicase to interact with primase. Supporting this idea, the work described herein based on biosensor experiments and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays shows that the DnaB-DnaC complex binds poorly to primase in comparison with DnaB alone. Using a structural model of DnaB complexed with the C-terminal domain of primase, we found that Ile-85 is located at the interface in the NTD of DnaB that contacts primase. An alanine substitution for Ile-85 specifically interfered with this interaction and impeded DnaB function in DNA replication, but not its activity as a DNA helicase or its ability to bind to ssDNA. By comparison, substitutions of Asn for Ile-136 (I136N) and Thr for Ile-142 (I142T) in a subdomain previously named the helical hairpin in the NTD of DnaB altered the conformation of the helical hairpin and/or compromised its pairwise arrangement with the companion subdomain in each brace of protomers of the DnaB hexamer. In contrast with the I85A mutant, the latter were defective in DNA replication due to impaired binding to both ssDNA and primase. In view of these findings, we propose that DnaC controls the ability of DnaB to interact with primase by modifying the conformation of the NTD of DnaB.

Its function in the stages of DNA replication requires its interaction with specific proteins. At the stage of initiation, DnaB must interact with DnaC, forming a stable complex. DnaB alone is inadequate. DnaB in this complex then interacts with DnaA assembled as a self-oligomer at oriC, which loads the DnaB-DnaC complex onto each DNA strand in an AT-rich region unwound by DnaA (5Duderstadt K.E.

During the transition from initiation to the elongation stage of DNA replication, DnaB interacts with primase, which leads to the release of DnaC from DnaB and its activation as a DNA helicase (10Makowska-Grzyska M.

Whereas models suggest that three primase molecules are able to interact with DnaB as the helicase unwinds the parental DNA, the number of DnaB-bound primase molecules that are sufficient for primer synthesis has not been established. Of interest, DnaB also interacts with the τ subunit of the clamp loader (DnaX complex), which leads to a 20-fold increase in the rate of replication fork movement that stems from the synergy between DnaB as it unwinds the parental duplex DNA and DNA polymerase III holoenzyme as it copies the unwound parental DNA (21Kim S.

At the termination stage, one of the proposed models to prevent replication forks from progressing beyond the terminus region, which would otherwise cause overreplication, involves an interaction of DnaB with Tus bound to a Ter site in an orientation that blocks the replisome (22Khatri G.S.

On the basis of the crystal structures of Geobacillus stearothermophilus DnaB (GstDnaB) in which the helicase is either a closed ring or open spiral (19Bailey S. Eliason W.K. Steitz T.A.

To form the dilated N-terminal collar, the helical hairpin and globular head domain of one DnaB protomer interact pairwise with the respective subdomain in pairs of protomers of the DnaB hexamer. For the closed ring form of Aquifex aeolicus DnaB, image analysis of negatively stained samples obtained by electron microscopy revealed a narrow inner channel within the N-terminal collar (42Strycharska M.S. Arias-Palomo E. Lyubimov A.Y. Erzberger J.P. O'Shea V.L. Bustamante C.J. Berger J.M. Nucleotide and partner-protein control of bacterial replicative helicase structure and function.Mol. Cell. 2013; 52: 844-854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). For this constricted form, which was observed in equal abundance as the dilated form in the presence of ATP or ATP analogues, one set of globular heads are positioned on the outside of the N-terminal collar with the other set in the interior (Fig. 1A). For either dilated or constricted conformations, the interactions between the helical hairpins of pairs of DnaB protomers are preserved. These conformations of the N-terminal collar correlate with electron microscopic studies of E. coli DnaB in which this domain has either 3- or 6-fold symmetry (44Yang S. Yu X. VanLoock M.S. Jezewska M.J. Bujalowski W. Egelman E.H. Flexibility of the rings: structural asymmetry in the DnaB hexameric helicase.J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 321: 839-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Compared with these structures, 3D electron microscopic reconstructions of E. coli DnaB in a complex with DnaC suggests that this helicase is a spiral, but the NTD is constricted (43Arias-Palomo E. O'Shea V.L. Hood I.V. Berger J.M. The bacterial DnaC helicase loader is a DnaB ring breaker.Cell. 2013; 153: 438-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In contrast, the crystal structure of GstDnaB complexed with the CTD of the cognate primase revealed that this DNA helicase is a closed ring, but its NTD is dilated (19Bailey S. Eliason W.K. Steitz T.A. Structure of hexameric DnaB helicase and its complex with a domain of DnaG primase.Science. 2007; 318: 459-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Compared with these static X-ray structures, the helicase presumably engages in a larger set of conformations during its catalytic cycle. This structure of GstDnaB bound to primase also describes the interacting surfaces of these proteins (19Bailey S. Eliason W.K. Steitz T.A. Structure of hexameric DnaB helicase and its complex with a domain of DnaG primase.Science. 2007; 318: 459-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Related studies of E. coli primase demonstrated that truncations or amino acid substitutions within 16 residues from its C terminus blocked or altered its ability to associate with DnaB (18Tougu K. Marians K.J. The interaction between helicase and primase sets the replication fork clock.J. Biol.

It has been suggested that the low negative charge distribution of the NTD of E. coli DnaB is the reason for its weaker binding to primase (36Kashav T. Nitharwal R. Abdulrehman S.A. Gabdoulkhakov A.

Alternatively, E. coli primase may make contact with DnaB primarily through one but not both of its globular heads. Other experiments on E. coli DnaB demonstrated that an Asn substitution for Ile-136 or a Thr substitution for Ile-142 (referred herein as the I136N or I142T mutants to denote the position of the amino acid substitution relative to the first residue of DnaB) in the helical hairpin does not disrupt the ATPase activity of DnaB, but negatively affects general priming (14Stordal L. Maurer R. Defect in general priming conferred by linker region mutants of Escherichia coli dnaB.J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4620-4627Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), an assay that requires a physical interaction between primase and ssDNA-bound DnaB for primer formation (46Soultanas P.

A separate study of the corresponding substitutions in GstDnaB showed that the mutant proteins are impaired in forming a complex with primase (16Thirlway J. Turner I.J. Gibson C.T. Gardiner L. Brady K. Allen S. Roberts C.J. Soultanas P.

Together, these findings suggest that the wild-type residues, which are conserved, contact primase directly. More recent experiments of differential hydrogen/deuterium exchange (HDX (55Wales T.E. Engen J.R. Hydrogen exchange mass spectrometry for the analysis of protein dynamics.Mass Spectrom. Rev. 2006; 25: 158-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar)), combined with mass spectrometry and molecular modeling, identified sites in the CTD of DnaB and in the NTD of DnaC that interact in the formation of the DnaB-DnaC complex (33Chodavarapu S. Jones A.D. Feig M. Kaguni J.M. DnaC traps DnaB as an open ring and remodels the domain that binds primase.Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44: 210-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This method measures the status of amide hydrogens of a protein that are solvent-exposed compared with buried residues. The ability of amide hydrogens to exchange is also affected by the binding of a protein or small molecule, which led to the identification of segments of DnaB and DnaC that interact, or by structural changes. Other evidence showed that the DnaB ring spontaneously opens and closes and that DnaC upon binding appears to trap DnaB as an open ring. The open ring conformation is evidently necessary for the DnaB-DnaC complex to load at the unwound region of oriC. This study also found that the binding of DnaC to DnaB causes a dramatic reduction in exchange of specific DnaB peptides (residues 122–134, 135–141, and 158–162) of the helical hairpin (residues 120–168). Apparently, this binding event induces a conformational change of the NTD that results in occlusion of the helical hairpin. The possibility that this structural change inhibits the binding of primase to DnaB has not been tested experimentally. Noting the alternate conformations of the NTD described above, the underlying purpose of this study was to test the model that the altered conformation of DnaB's NTD caused by its association with DnaC affects the binding of primase. Evidence from biosensor experiments, ELISAs, and hydrogen/deuterium exchange substantiates this model. Supporting biochemical assays showed that an I85A substitution in the globular head of DnaB specifically impairs the interaction between the helicase and primase. Other results showed that I136N and I142T substitutions alter the conformation of the helical hairpin and/or its pairing with this subdomain in the companion DnaB protomer to interfere with the binding of DnaB to ssDNA and to primase. Hence, primer formation and subsequent DNA replication are inhibited. We prepared a homology model of E. coli DnaB bound to the CTD of primase using the X-ray structure of GstDnaB complexed to the CTD of the cognate primase (19Bailey S. Eliason W.K. Steitz T.A.

https://openalex.org/W2767069845,"Methods We quantified 378 HRMAS 1H NMR spectra of human brain tumours (132 glioblastomas, 101 astrocytomas, 75 meningiomas, 37 oligodendrogliomas and 33 metastases) from the eTumour database and looked for metabolic interactions by metabolite-metabolite correlation analysis (MMCA). Results All tumour types showed remarkably similar metabolic correlations. Lactate correlated positively with alanine, glutamate with glutamine; creatine + phosphocreatine (tCr) correlated positively with lactate, alanine and choline + phosphocholine + glycerophosphocholine (tCho), and tCho correlated positively with lactate; fatty acids correlated negatively with lactate, glutamate + glutamine (tGlut), tCr and tCho. Oligodendrogliomas had fewer correlations but they still fitted that pattern. Conclusions Possible explanations include (i) glycolytic tumour cells (the Warburg effect) generating pyruvate which is converted to lactate, alanine, glutamate and then glutamine; (ii) an association between elevated glycolysis and increased choline turnover in membranes; (iii) an increase in the tCr pool to facilitate phosphocreatine-driven glutamate uptake; (iv) lipid signals come from cytosolic lipid droplets in necrotic or pre-necrotic tumour tissue that has lower concentrations of anabolic and catabolic metabolites. Additional metabolite exchanges with host cells may also be involved. If tumours co-opt a standard set of biochemical mechanisms to grow in the brain, then drugs might be developed to disrupt those mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2765890257,"Caspase-9 (casp-9) is an initiator caspase and plays a central role in activating apoptotic cell death. Control of all caspases is tightly regulated by a series of phosphorylation events enacted by several different kinases. Caspase-9 is the most heavily phosphorylated of all caspases, with phosphorylation of at least 11 distinct residues in all three caspase-9 domains by nine kinases. Caspase-9 phosphorylation by the non-receptor tyrosine kinase c-Abl at Tyr-153 reportedly leads to caspase-9 activation. All other phosphorylation events on caspases have been shown to block proteolytic function by a number of mechanisms, so we sought to unravel the molecular mechanism of the putative caspase-9 activation by phosphorylation. Surprisingly, we observed no evidence for Tyr-153 phosphorylation of caspase-9 in vitro or in cells, suggesting that Tyr-153 is not phosphorylated by c-Abl. Instead, we identified a new site for c-Abl-mediated phosphorylation, Tyr-397. This residue is adjacent to the caspase-9 active site but, as a member of the second shell, not a residue that directly contacts substrate. Our results further indicate that Tyr-397 is the dominant site of c-Abl phosphorylation both in vitro and upon c-Abl activation in cells. Of note, phosphorylation at this site inhibits caspase-9 activity, and the bulk of the added phosphate moiety appeared to directly block substrate binding. c-Abl plays both proapoptotic and prosurvival roles, and our findings suggest that c-Abl's effects on caspase-9 activity promote the prosurvival mode."

https://openalex.org/W2766831427,"Breast density is associated with reduced imaging resolution in the detection of breast cancer. A biochemical approach that is not affected by density would provide an important tool to healthcare professionals who are managing women with dense breasts and suspicious imaging findings. Videssa® Breast is a combinatorial proteomic biomarker assay (CPBA), comprised of Serum Protein Biomarkers (SPB) and Tumor Associated Autoantibodies (TAAb) integrated with patient-specific clinical data to produce a diagnostic score that reliably detects breast cancer (BC) as an adjunctive tool to imaging. The performance of Videssa® Breast was evaluated in the dense (a and b) and non-dense (c and d) groups in a population of n = 545 women under age 50. The sensitivity and specificity in the dense breast group were calculated to be 88.9% and 81.2%, respectively, and 92.3% and 86.6%, respectively, for the non-dense group. No significant differences were observed in the sensitivity (p = 1.0) or specificity (p = 0.18) between these groups. The NPV was 99.3% and 99.1% in non-dense and dense groups, respectively. Unlike imaging, Videssa® Breast does not appear to be impacted by breast density; it can effectively detect breast cancer in women with dense and non-dense breasts alike. Thus, Videssa® Breast provides a powerful tool for healthcare providers when women with dense breasts present with challenging imaging findings. In addition, Videssa® Breast provides assurance to women with dense breasts that they do not have breast cancer, reducing further anxiety in this higher risk patient population."
https://openalex.org/W2765439500,"The Indo-Pacific is home to Earth’s most biodiverse coral reefs. Diversity on these reefs decreases from the Coral Triangle east through the islands of Melanesia. Despite this pattern having been identified during the early 20th century, our knowledge about the interaction between pattern and process remains incomplete. To evaluate the structure of coral reef fish communities across Melanesia, we obtained distributional records for 396 reef fish species in five taxa across seven countries. We used hierarchical clustering, nestedness, and multiple linear regression analyses to evaluate the community structure. We also compiled data on life history traits (pelagic larval duration, body size and schooling behavior) to help elucidate the ecological mechanisms behind community structure. Species richness for these taxa along the gradient was significantly related to longitude but not habitat area. Communities are significantly nested, indicating that species-poor communities are largely composed of subsets of the species found on species rich reefs. These trends are robust across taxonomic groups except for the Pomacentridae, which exhibit an anti-nested pattern, perhaps due to a large number of endemic species. Correlations between life history traits and the number of reefs on which species occurred indicate that dispersal and survival ability contribute to determining community structure. We conclude that distance from the Coral Triangle dominates community structure in reef fish; however, conservation of the most species-rich areas will not be sufficient alone to conserve the vivid splendor of this region."
https://openalex.org/W2766563387,"There is increasing recognition of the long-lasting effects of tsunamis on human populations. This is particularly notable along tectonically active coastlines with repeated inundations occurring over thousands of years. Given the often high death tolls reported from historical events though it is remarkable that so few human skeletal remains have been found in the numerous palaeotsunami deposits studied to date. The 1929 discovery of the Aitape Skull in northern Papua New Guinea and its inferred late Pleistocene age played an important role in discussions about the origins of humans in Australasia for over 25 years until it was more reliably radiocarbon dated to around 6000 years old. However, no similar attention has been given to reassessing the deposit in which it was found-a coastal mangrove swamp inundated by water from a shallow sea. With the benefit of knowledge gained from studies of the 1998 tsunami in the same area, we conclude that the skull was laid down in a tsunami deposit and as such may represent the oldest known tsunami victim in the world. These findings raise the question of whether other coastal archaeological sites with human skeletal remains would benefit from a re-assessment of their geological context."
https://openalex.org/W2765269043,"Donation of haematopoietic stem cells, either through bone marrow (BM) or peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) collection, is a generally safe procedure for healthy donors, although side effects are a known risk. Previous research, including our recent quantitative study, has shown that the psychosocial response to donating is usually a positive one and most donors would be willing to donate again in the future. This is often despite experiencing significant side effects during the donation process. Due to the relative recent introduction of PBSC, a comprehensive understanding of the range of physical and emotional issues donors may experience is lacking, as well as an understanding of specific donor characteristics Qualitative research can provide rich narrative data into these areas. This study was set up in order to identify specific donor characteristics and to further explore the relationship between pre-donation physical health and the donation experience, as previously identified in our quantitative study.It involved in-depth telephone interviews with 14 PBSC donors who participated in our original quantitative study. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the findings and the results provide a summary of participants' characteristics using themes and constituent codes.We identified several donor characteristics, including strong intrinsic motivation, altruism, sense of duty, determination, low levels of ambivalence and the ability to develop a strong emotional relationship with an (unknown/anonymous) recipient whilst being able to manage strong feelings and emotions.These personality traits may explain the resilience that has been observed previously in haematopoietic stem cells donors. Significant feelings of grief were reported after a recipient's death. Possibilities to alleviate these symptoms may include raising awareness of potential poor outcomes in the recipient and offering improved counselling services if the recipient dies. We acknowledge several limitations including the sampling frame."
