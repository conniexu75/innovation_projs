https://openalex.org/W4282960930,"To understand degradation routes and improve the stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), accelerated aging tests are needed. Here, we use elevated temperatures (up to 110°C) to quantify the accelerated degradation of encapsulated CsPbI 3 PSCs under constant illumination. Incorporating a two-dimensional (2D) Cs 2 PbI 2 Cl 2 capping layer between the perovskite active layer and hole-transport layer stabilizes the interface while increasing power conversion efficiency of the all-inorganic PSCs from 14.9 to 17.4%. Devices with this 2D capping layer did not degrade at 35°C and required &gt;2100 hours at 110°C under constant illumination to degrade by 20% of their initial efficiency. Degradation acceleration factors based on the observed Arrhenius temperature dependence predict intrinsic lifetimes of 51,000 ± 7000 hours (&gt;5 years) operating continuously at 35°C."

Erbium ions could provide a basis for efficient optical amplification in photonic integrated circuits but their use remains impractical as a result of insufficient output power. We demonstrate a photonic integrated circuit-based erbium amplifier reaching 145 milliwatts of output power and more than 30 decibels of small-signal gain-on par with commercial fiber amplifiers and surpassing state-of-the-art III-V heterogeneously integrated semiconductor amplifiers. We apply ion implantation to ultralow-loss silicon nitride (Si3N4) photonic integrated circuits, which are able to increase the soliton microcomb output power by 100 times, achieving power requirements for low-noise photonic microwave generation and wavelength-division multiplexing optical communications. Endowing Si3N4 photonic integrated circuits with gain enables the miniaturization of various fiber-based devices such as high-pulse-energy femtosecond mode-locked lasers."
https://openalex.org/W4282969800,"How the plasma membrane senses external heat-stress signals to communicate with chloroplasts to orchestrate thermotolerance remains elusive. We identified a quantitative trait locus, Thermo-tolerance 3 ( TT3 ), consisting of two genes, TT3.1 and TT3.2 , that interact together to enhance rice thermotolerance and reduce grain-yield losses caused by heat stress. Upon heat stress, plasma membrane–localized E3 ligase TT3.1 translocates to the endosomes, on which TT3.1 ubiquitinates chloroplast precursor protein TT3.2 for vacuolar degradation, implying that TT3.1 might serve as a potential thermosensor. Lesser accumulated, mature TT3.2 proteins in chloroplasts are essential for protecting thylakoids from heat stress. Our findings not only reveal a TT3.1-TT3.2 genetic module at one locus that transduces heat signals from plasma membrane to chloroplasts but also provide the strategy for breeding highly thermotolerant crops."
https://openalex.org/W4282975176,"Advances in additive manufacturing techniques have enabled the creation of stimuli-responsive materials with designed three-dimensional (3D) architectures. Unlike biological systems in which functions such as sensing, actuation, and control are closely integrated, few architected materials have comparable system complexity. We report a design and manufacturing route to create a class of robotic metamaterials capable of motion with multiple degrees of freedom, amplification of strain in a prescribed direction in response to an electric field (and vice versa), and thus, programmed motions with self-sensing and feedback control. These robotic metamaterials consist of networks of piezoelectric, conductive, and structural elements interwoven into a designed 3D lattice. The resulting architected materials function as proprioceptive microrobots that actively sense and move."
https://openalex.org/W4283012163,"Ocean oil slicks can be attributed to natural seepages or to anthropogenic discharges. To date, the global picture of their distribution and relative natural and anthropogenic contributions remains unclear. Here, by analyzing 563,705 Sentinel-1 images from 2014-2019, we provide the first global map of oil slicks and a detailed inventory of static-and-persistent sources (natural seeps, platforms, and pipelines). About 90% of oil slicks were within 160 kilometers of shorelines, with 21 high-density slick belts coinciding well with shipping routes. Quantified by slick area, the proportion of anthropogenic discharges was an order of magnitude greater than natural seepages (94 versus 6%), in contrast to the previous estimate quantified by volume during 1990-1999 (54 versus 46%). Our findings reveal that the present-day anthropogenic contribution to marine oil pollution may have been substantially underestimated."
https://openalex.org/W4282976483,"Mammalian cells autonomously activate hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs) to ensure survival in low-oxygen environments. We report here that injury-induced hypoxia is insufficient to trigger HIF1α in damaged epithelium. Instead, multimodal single-cell and spatial transcriptomics analyses and functional studies reveal that retinoic acid–related orphan receptor γt + (RORγt + ) γδ T cell–derived interleukin-17A (IL-17A) is necessary and sufficient to activate HIF1α. Protein kinase B (AKT) and extracellular signal–regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling proximal of IL-17 receptor C (IL-17RC) activates mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and consequently HIF1α. The IL-17A–HIF1α axis drives glycolysis in wound front epithelia. Epithelial-specific loss of IL-17RC, HIF1α, or blockade of glycolysis derails repair. Our findings underscore the coupling of inflammatory, metabolic, and migratory programs to expedite epithelial healing and illuminate the immune cell–derived inputs in cellular adaptation to hypoxic stress during repair."
https://openalex.org/W4282959256,"In eukaryotes, RNA polymerase (Pol) II transcribes chromatin and must move past nucleosomes, often resulting in nucleosome displacement. How Pol II unwraps the DNA from nucleosomes to allow transcription and how DNA rewraps to retain nucleosomes has been unclear. Here, we report the 3.0-angstrom cryo–electron microscopy structure of a mammalian Pol II-DSIF-SPT6-PAF1c-TFIIS-nucleosome complex stalled 54 base pairs within the nucleosome. The structure provides a mechanistic basis for nucleosome retention during transcription elongation where upstream DNA emerging from the Pol II cleft has rewrapped the proximal side of the nucleosome. The structure uncovers a direct role for Pol II and transcription elongation factors in nucleosome retention and explains how nucleosomes are retained to prevent the disruption of chromatin structure across actively transcribed genes."
https://openalex.org/W4282961075,"Effective tissue repair after myocardial infarction entails a vigorous angiogenic response, guided by incompletely defined immune cell–endothelial cell interactions. We identify the monocyte- and macrophage-derived cytokine METRNL (meteorin-like) as a driver of postinfarction angiogenesis and high-affinity ligand for the stem cell factor receptor KIT (KIT receptor tyrosine kinase). METRNL mediated angiogenic effects in cultured human endothelial cells through KIT-dependent signaling pathways. In a mouse model of myocardial infarction, METRNL promoted infarct repair by selectively expanding the KIT-expressing endothelial cell population in the infarct border zone. Metrnl -deficient mice failed to mount this KIT-dependent angiogenic response and developed severe postinfarction heart failure. Our data establish METRNL as a KIT receptor ligand in the context of ischemic tissue repair."
https://openalex.org/W4282972035,"The elongation of eukaryotic selenoproteins relies on a poorly understood process of interpreting in-frame UGA stop codons as selenocysteine (Sec). We used cryo-electron microscopy to visualize Sec UGA recoding in mammals. A complex between the noncoding Sec-insertion sequence (SECIS), SECIS-binding protein 2 (SBP2), and 40S ribosomal subunit enables Sec-specific elongation factor eEFSec to deliver Sec. eEFSec and SBP2 do not interact directly but rather deploy their carboxyl-terminal domains to engage with the opposite ends of the SECIS. By using its Lys-rich and carboxyl-terminal segments, the ribosomal protein eS31 simultaneously interacts with Sec-specific transfer RNA (tRNASec) and SBP2, which further stabilizes the assembly. eEFSec is indiscriminate toward l-serine and facilitates its misincorporation at Sec UGA codons. Our results support a fundamentally distinct mechanism of Sec UGA recoding in eukaryotes from that in bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W4282961320,"The centrosome provides an intracellular anchor for the cytoskeleton, regulating cell division, cell migration, and cilia formation. We used spatial proteomics to elucidate protein interaction networks at the centrosome of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural stem cells (NSCs) and neurons. Centrosome-associated proteins were largely cell type-specific, with protein hubs involved in RNA dynamics. Analysis of neurodevelopmental disease cohorts identified a significant overrepresentation of NSC centrosome proteins with variants in patients with periventricular heterotopia (PH). Expressing the PH-associated mutant pre-mRNA-processing factor 6 (PRPF6) reproduced the periventricular misplacement in the developing mouse brain, highlighting missplicing of transcripts of a microtubule-associated kinase with centrosomal location as essential for the phenotype. Collectively, cell type-specific centrosome interactomes explain how genetic variants in ubiquitous proteins may convey brain-specific phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W4283021342,"The emergence of new therapeutic modalities requires complementary tools for their efficient syntheses. Availability of methodologies for site-selective modification of biomolecules remains a long-standing challenge, given the inherent complexity and the presence of repeating residues that bear functional groups with similar reactivity profiles. We describe a bioconjugation strategy for modification of native peptides relying on high site selectivity conveyed by enzymes. We engineered penicillin G acylases to distinguish among free amino moieties of insulin (two at amino termini and an internal lysine) and manipulate cleavable phenylacetamide groups in a programmable manner to form protected insulin derivatives. This enables selective and specific chemical ligation to synthesize homogeneous bioconjugates, improving yield and purity compared to the existing methods, and generally opens avenues in the functionalization of native proteins to access biological probes or drugs."
https://openalex.org/W4282960480,"Polar bears are susceptible to climate warming because of their dependence on sea ice, which is declining rapidly. We present the first evidence for a genetically distinct and functionally isolated group of polar bears in Southeast Greenland. These bears occupy sea-ice conditions resembling those projected for the High Arctic in the late 21st century, with an annual ice-free period that is >100 days longer than the estimated fasting threshold for the species. Whereas polar bears in most of the Arctic depend on annual sea ice to catch seals, Southeast Greenland bears have a year-round hunting platform in the form of freshwater glacial mélange. This suggests that marine-terminating glaciers, although of limited availability, may serve as previously unrecognized climate refugia. Conservation of Southeast Greenland polar bears, which meet criteria for recognition as the world's 20th polar bear subpopulation, is necessary to preserve the genetic diversity and evolutionary potential of the species."
https://openalex.org/W4282969031,"Ultracold atoms confined to periodic potentials have proven to be a powerful tool for quantum simulation of complex many-body systems. We confine fermions to one dimension to realize the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid model, which describes the highly collective nature of their low-energy excitations. We use Bragg spectroscopy to directly excite either the spin or charge waves for various strengths of repulsive interaction. We observe that the velocity of the spin and charge excitations shift in opposite directions with increasing interaction, a hallmark of spin-charge separation. The excitation spectra are in quantitative agreement with the exact solution of the Yang-Gaudin model and the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid theory. Furthermore, we identify effects of nonlinear corrections to this theory that arise from band curvature and back-scattering."
https://openalex.org/W4282961269,"Industrialization plays a vital role in the development of a country's economy. However, it also adversely affects the environment by discharging various unwanted and harmful substances such as heavy metals into the surface and subsurface aquifers. The current research work investigates the identification, characterization, and evaluation of specific heavy metals in industrial wastewater (IWW) and different composite samples of soil and vegetables (onion, pumpkin, lady finger, and green pepper) collected from selected agricultural fields irrigated with canals fed IWW in Mingora city of Swat (Pakistan). Obtained results were compared with the tube well water irrigated soil and vegetables grown in it. Heavy metals accumulation was tested through wet digestion method and atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS). The metal transfer factor (MTF) of heavy metals from soil to vegetables was also determined along with the health index (HI) to assess the potential health risk of the metals towards consumers using Monte Carlo simulation technique. Analysis of water samples showed that the concentration in mg l-1 of heavy metals in IWW follows the trend Fe (6.72) > Cr (0.537) > Pb (0.393) > Co (0.204) > Mn (0.125) > Ni (0.121). Analysis of the soil samples irrigated with IWW followed the order of Fe (47.27) > Pb (2.92) > Cr (2.90) >Ni (1.02) > Mn (0.90) > Co (0.68) and Fe (17.12) > Pb (2.12) > Cr (2.03) >Ni (0.76) > Co (0.49) > Mn (0.23) irrigated with TWW. Heavy metals concentration values found in soil irrigated with IWW were higher than the soil irrigated with TWW. Similar trends were found for agricultural produces grown on soil irrigated with IWW and found higher than the normal allowable WHO limits, indicating higher possibilities of health risks if continuously consumed. MTF values were found higher than 1 for ladyfinger and green pepper for Pb intake and pumpkin for Mn intake. The current study suggests the continuous monitoring of soil, irrigation water and agricultural products to prevent heavy metals concentration beyond allowable limits, in the food chain. Thus, concrete preventive measures must be taken to reduce heavy metal accumulation through wastewater irrigation to protect both human and animal health in the study area of Mingora Swat Pakistan."
https://openalex.org/W4282970868,"A shift of paradigm is running over online social platforms: the over-centralization of these platforms is leaving room for decentralized solutions based on blockchain technologies, such as blockchain-based online social networks-BOSNs. Among the many unknown aspects of these techno-social systems, the objective of this study is to propose an analytical framework to assess the impact of the cryptocurrencies linked to a BOSN platform on the evolution of its social network and on the behavior of their users, in terms of production of content and/or its promotion through a voting and rewarding system. The framework has been applied to Steemit, one of the most widespread BOSNs, from which we collected three-year-long high-resolution data on its evolution along with the price of its main cryptocurrencies. On users' activities extracted from these longitudinal data, we applied a time-series correlation analysis and a correlation analysis between the action allocation strategies and the obtained rewards, in the case of most central accounts. The analysis has highlighted pieces of evidence of the influence of the cryptocurrency price on users' actions, particularly on actions that shape the structure of the social networks. Second, we also found highly rewarded users prefer actions related to the promotion of content rather than the creation of high-quality content, exploiting the reward distribution mechanisms implemented by the platform. These findings highlight that the shift of paradigm towards blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies might strengthen the influence of financial and economic factors rather than relational/social aspects on the evolution of these new complex techno-social systems."
https://openalex.org/W4283009283,"DNA G-quadruplexes (G4s) are now widely accepted as viable targets in the pursuit of anticancer therapeutics. To date, few small molecules have been identified that exhibit selectivity for G4s over alternative forms of DNA, such as the ubiquitous duplex. We posit that the lack of current ligand specificity arises for multiple reasons: G4 atomic models are often small, monomeric, single quadruplex structures with few or no druggable pockets; targeting G-tetrad faces frequently results in the enrichment of extended electron-deficient polyaromatic end-pasting scaffolds; and virtual drug discovery efforts often under-sample chemical search space. We show that by addressing these issues we can enrich for non-standard molecular templates that exhibit high selectivity towards G4s over other forms of DNA. We performed an extensive virtual screen against the higher-order hTERT core promoter G4 that we have previously characterized, targeting 12 of its unique loop and groove pockets using libraries containing 40 million drug-like compounds for each screen. Using our drug discovery funnel approach, which utilizes high-throughput fluorescence thermal shift assay (FTSA) screens, microscale thermophoresis (MST), and orthogonal biophysical methods, we have identified multiple unique G4 binding scaffolds. We subsequently used two rounds of catalogue-based SAR to increase the affinity of a disubstituted 2-aminoethyl-quinazoline that stabilizes the higher-order hTERT G-quadruplex by binding across its G4 junctional sites. We show selectivity of its binding affinity towards hTERT is virtually unaffected in the presence of near-physiological levels of duplex DNA, and that this molecule downregulates hTERT transcription in breast cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W4282965050,"Antimicrobial stewardship encourages appropriate antibiotic use, the specific activities of which will vary by institutional context. We investigated regional variation in antibiotic use by surveying three regional public hospitals in Kenya. Hospital-level data for antimicrobial stewardship activities, infection prevention and control, and laboratory diagnostic capacities were collected from hospital administrators, heads of infection prevention and control units, and laboratory directors, respectively. Patient-level antibiotic use data were abstracted from medical records using a modified World Health Organization point-prevalence survey form. Altogether, 1,071 consenting patients were surveyed at Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH, n = 579), Coast Provincial General Hospital (CPGH, n = 229) and Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital (MTRH, n = 263). The majority (67%, 722/1071) were ≥18 years and 53% (563/1071) were female. Forty-six percent (46%, 489/1071) were receiving at least one antibiotic. Antibiotic use was higher among children &lt;5 years (70%, 150/224) than among other age groups (40%, 339/847; P &lt; 0.001). Critical care (82%, 14/17 patients) and pediatric wards (59%, 155/265) had the highest proportion of antibiotic users. Amoxicillin/clavulanate was the most frequently used antibiotic at KNH (17%, 64/383 antibiotic doses), and ceftriaxone was most used at CPGH (29%, 55/189) and MTRH (31%, 57/184). Forty-three percent (326/756) of all antibiotic prescriptions had at least one missed dose recorded. Forty-six percent (204/489) of patients on antibiotics had a specific infectious disease diagnosis, of which 18% (37/204) had soft-tissue infections, 17% (35/204) had clinical sepsis, 15% (31/204) had pneumonia, 13% (27/204) had central nervous system infections and 10% (20/204) had obstetric or gynecological infections. Of these, 27% (56/204) had bacterial culture tests ordered, with culture results available for 68% (38/56) of tests. Missed antibiotic doses, low use of specimen cultures to guide therapy, high rates of antibiotic use, particularly in the pediatric and surgical population, and preference for broad-spectrum antibiotics suggest antibiotic use in these tertiary care hospitals is not optimal. Antimicrobial stewardship programs, policies, and guidelines should be tailored to address these areas."
https://openalex.org/W4282974262,"Volatile elements are thought to have been delivered to Solar System terrestrial planets late in their formation through accretion of chondritic meteorites. Mars can provide information on inner Solar System volatile delivery during the earliest planet formation stages. We measured krypton isotopes in the martian meteorite Chassigny, representative of the planet's interior. We found chondritic krypton isotope ratios, which imply early incorporation of chondritic volatiles. The atmosphere of Mars has different (solar-type) krypton isotope ratios, indicating that it is not a product of magma ocean outgassing or fractionation of interior volatiles. Atmospheric krypton instead originates from accretion of solar nebula gas after formation of the mantle but before nebular dissipation. Our observations contradict the common hypothesis that during planet formation, chondritic volatile delivery occurred after solar gas acquisition."
https://openalex.org/W4282965293,"The classical SEIR model, being an autonomous system of differential equations, has important limitations when representing a pandemic situation. Particularly, the geometric unimodal shape of the epidemic curve is not what is generally observed. This work introduces the β SEIR model, which adds to the classical SEIR model a differential law to model the variation in the transmission rate. It considers two opposite thrives generally found in a population: first, reaction to disease presence that may be linked to mitigation strategies, which tends to decrease transmission, and second, the urge to return to normal conditions that pulls to restore the initial value of the transmission rate. Our results open a wide spectrum of dynamic variabilities in the curve of new infected, which are justified by reaction and restoration thrives that affect disease transmission over time. Some of these dynamics have been observed in the existing COVID-19 disease data. In particular and to further exemplify the potential of the model proposed in this article, we show its capability of capturing the evolution of the number of new confirmed cases of Chile and Italy for several months after epidemic onset, while incorporating a reaction to disease presence with decreasing adherence to mitigation strategies, as well as a seasonal effect on the restoration of the initial transmissibility conditions."
https://openalex.org/W4283009112,"Hyperuricemia has a suspected relationship with hypertension, metabolic syndrome, kidney disease, and cardiovascular disease. Endocrine disruptors may affect uric acid metabolism; however, few epidemiologic studies have been performed in children regarding newly developed bisphenol A (BPA) substitutes. We evaluated the associations between BPA, bisphenol S (BPS), and bisphenol F (BPF) exposure and serum uric acid concentrations in 6-year-old Korean children.From the Environment and Development of Children cohort study, six-year-old children (N = 489; 251 boys) who underwent an examination during 2015-2017 were included. Anthropometry, questionnaires, and biological samples were evaluated. BPA, BPS, and BPF levels were measured from spot urine samples, and log-transformed or categorized into groups for analysis. We constructed linear regression models adjusting for age, sex, urinary creatinine levels, body mass index z-scores, and estimated glomerular filtration rates.Mean serum uric level was 4.2 mg dL-1 (0.8 SD) without sex-differences. Among the three bisphenols, higher BPS exposure was associated with increased serum uric acid concentrations (P-value for trend = 0.002). When BPS levels were categorized into three groups (non-detection < 0.02 μg L-1 vs. medium BPS; 0.02-0.05 μg L-1 vs. high BPS ≥ 0.05 μg L-1), the high BPS group showed higher serum uric acid concentrations (by 0.26 mg dL-1, P = 0.003) than the non-detection group after adjusting for covariates, which was significant in boys but not girls.Urinary BPS levels was positively associated with serum uric acid concentrations in 6-year-old children, and the association was more pronounced in boys. Considering the increasing use of BPS and concerning effect of hyperuricemia on health outcomes, their positive relationship should be investigated further."
https://openalex.org/W4282966033,"Prevention of tuberculosis (TB) recurrence is an important issue in TB control. South Korea, a country with a high average income, has been challenged with an intermediate burden of TB. We aimed to estimate the TB recurrence rate after successful completion of the first anti-TB chemotherapy, and to identify the risk factors for the TB recurrence by focusing on co-morbidities and behavioral factors.This is a population-based cohort study using data from the National Health Insurance (NHI) database between 2002 and 2013. Newly diagnosed TB patients were identified using the classification of disease codes and prescription records. Final analytical subjects included people who successfully completed the first anti-TB chemotherapy. The primary outcome measure was recurrent TB 6-month after the first treatment completion. A set of associated risk factors, including demographic characteristics, co-morbidities, and health behavior factors were analyzed using Cox regression analysis.Among 5,446 TB patients, 2,226 (40.1%) completed the first anti-TB treatment. During the follow-up period, 150 (6.7%) patients had TB recurrence, and the crude recurrent rate was 22.6 per 1000 person-years. The majority of recurrence cases (89%) occurred within the first 2-year period. The major findings show that participants who are male (adjusted HR (aHR) = 1.81, at a 95% CI, range: 1.11-2.94), older in age (aHR = 1.07, at a 95% CI, range: 1.00-1.14), have a lower income (aHR = 1.96, at a 95% CI, range: 1.10-3.48) and who are underweight (aHR = 1.92, at a 95% CI, range 1.15-3.20) were at higher risks for TB recurrence.People who have risk factors for recurrent TB need to improve treatment compliance through more effective TB management, and follow-up observation for one or two years after the treatment completion."
https://openalex.org/W4282968800,"In addition to laser photocoagulation, therapeutic interventions for diabetic retinopathy (DR) have heretofore consisted of anti-VEGF drugs, which, besides drawbacks inherent to the treatments themselves, are limited in scope and may not fully address the condition's complex pathophysiology. This is because DR is a multifactorial condition, meaning a gene therapy focused on a target with broader effects, such as the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), may prove to be the solution in overcoming these concerns. Having previously demonstrated the potential of a mTOR-inhibiting shRNA packaged in a recombinant adeno-associated virus to address a variety of angiogenic retinal diseases, here we explore the effects of rAAV2-shmTOR-SD in a streptozotocin-induced diabetic mouse model. Delivered via intravitreal injection, the therapeutic efficacy of the virus vector upon early DR processes was examined. rAAV2-shmTOR-SD effectively transduced mouse retinas and therein downregulated mTOR expression, which was elevated in sham-treated and control shRNA-injected (rAAV2-shCon-SD) control groups. mTOR inhibition additionally led to marked reductions in pericyte loss, acellular capillary formation, vascular permeability, and retinal cell layer thinning, processes that contribute to DR progression. Immunohistochemistry showed that rAAV2-shmTOR-SD decreased ganglion cell loss and pathogenic Müller cell activation and proliferation, while also having anti-apoptotic activity, with these effects suggesting the therapeutic virus vector may be neuroprotective. Taken together, these results build upon our previous work to demonstrate the broad ability of rAAV2-shmTOR-SD to address aspects of DR pathophysiology further evidencing its potential as a human gene therapeutic strategy for DR."
https://openalex.org/W4282980185,"Background Hemodialysis impacts the quality of life of patients with end-stage renal disease. Particularly, depression is the most common psychological condition among patients. Self-care self-efficacy might play an important role in quality of life of patients with hemodialysis. Objective This study was designed to explore the relationships among self-care self-efficacy, depression, and quality of life. The second aim was to explore the extent to which self-care self-efficacy and depression explain the variance in quality of life of patients on hemodialysis. Methods This cross-sectional study included 127 patients receiving hemodialysis and used the Short Form 36 Health Survey, the Strategies Used by People to Promote Health, and the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 to evaluate quality of life, self-care self-efficacy, and depression. Data was analyzed using independent t-test, analysis of variance, Pearson’s correlation and hierarchical multiple regression. Results The findings indicated that self-care self-efficacy was significantly positively correlated (PCS r = .533, p &lt; 0.001, MCS r = .47, p &lt; .001) and depression was significantly negatively correlated (PCS r = −.446, p &lt; .001, MCS r = −.605, p &lt; .001) with the two quality of life components. Self-care self-efficacy and depression were significant predictors of the physical ( R 2 inc = 0.09, β = -0.38, p &lt;0.001, R 2 inc = 0.12, β = -0.22, p &lt;0.001) and mental ( R 2 inc = 0.04%, β = -0.25, p &lt;0.001, R 2 inc = 0.33, β = -0.51, p &lt;0.001) quality of life of hemodialysis patients. Conclusions Health professionals may target improving self-care self-efficacy and reducing depressive symptoms to enhance patient quality of life."
https://openalex.org/W4282982084,"Background COVID-19 prognostic factors include age, sex, comorbidities, laboratory and imaging findings, and time from symptom onset to seeking care. Purpose The study aim was to evaluate indices combining disease severity measures and time from disease onset to predict mortality of COVID-19 patients admitted to the emergency department (ED). Materials and methods All consecutive COVID-19 patients who underwent both computed tomography (CT) and chest X-ray (CXR) at ED presentation between 27/02/2020 and 13/03/2020 were included. CT visual score of disease extension and CXR Radiographic Assessment of Lung Edema (RALE) score were collected. The CT- and CXR-based scores, C-reactive protein (CRP), and oxygen saturation levels (sO 2 ) were separately combined with time from symptom onset to ED presentation to obtain severity/time indices. Multivariable regression age- and sex-adjusted models without and with severity/time indices were compared. For CXR-RALE, the models were tested in a validation cohort. Results Of the 308 included patients, 55 (17.9%) died. In multivariable logistic age- and sex-adjusted models for death at 30 days, severity/time indices showed good discrimination ability, higher for imaging than for laboratory measures (AUC CT = 0.92, AUC CXR = 0.90, AUC CRP = 0.88, AUC sO2 = 0.88). AUC CXR was lower in the validation cohort (0.79). The models including severity/time indices performed slightly better than models including measures of disease severity not combined with time and those including the Charlson Comorbidity Index, except for CRP-based models. Conclusion Time from symptom onset to ED admission is a strong prognostic factor and provides added value to the interpretation of imaging and laboratory findings at ED presentation."
https://openalex.org/W4283013259,"Salt and drought stresses are major environmental conditions that severely limit grape growth and productivity, while exogenous melatonin can alleviate the drought and salt damage to grapevines. N-acetylserotonin methyltransferase (ASMT) is the key enzyme in melatonin synthesis, which plays a critical role in regulating stress responses. However, the roles of ASMTs from grapevine under drought and salt stresses responses remain largely unclear. In this study, the VvASMT1 gene was isolated from grapevine, and its physiological functions in salt and mimic drought stress tolerance were investigated. Expression pattern analysis revealed that VvASMT1 was significantly induced by different salt and osmotic stresses. Ectopic expression of VvASMT1 in Nicotiana benthamiana significantly enhanced melatonin production in transgenic plants. Compared with wild-type plants, the transgenic lines exhibited a higher germination ratio, longer root length, lower degree of leaf wilting and relative water content (RWC) under salt and osmotic stresses. In addition, under salt and osmotic stresses, overexpression of VvASMT1 improved proline and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents, increased the activity of antioxidant enzymes and decreased the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Taken together, our results demonstrate the explicit role of VvASMT1 in salt and osmotic stress responses, which provides a theoretical foundation for the genetic engineering of grapevine."
https://openalex.org/W4282973900,"Despite diagnostic advances in microbiology, the etiology of neutropenic fever remains elusive in most cases. In this study, we evaluated the utility of a metagenomic shotgun sequencing based assay for detection of bacteria and viruses in blood samples of patients with febrile neutropenia. We prospectively enrolled 20 acute leukemia patients and obtained blood from these patients at three time points: 1) anytime from onset of neutropenia until before development of neutropenic fever, 2) within 24 hours of onset of neutropenic fever, 3) 5–7 days after onset of neutropenic fever. Blood samples underwent sample preparation, sequencing and analysis using the iDTECT® Dx Blood v1® platform (PathoQuest, Paris, France). Clinically relevant viruses or bacteria were detected in three cases each by metagenomic shotgun sequencing and blood cultures, albeit with no concordance between the two.

This study has been conducted to investigate their perception of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on their current and future social interactions. To this end, semi-structured narrative interviews were conducted. Ten adults on the autism spectrum participated in the study. The phenomenological analysis of the narratives focused on categories related to the social functioning of the study participants. The interpretation of the narratives has shown that autistic people can experience a sense of loss due to the lack of direct contact. On the other hand, we also talked to the participants who expressed their satisfaction with the situation of obligatory social distance. The respondents also discussed the subject of changing the form of interaction in some areas of public life to one that is more adjusted to the needs of people with their condition. The study concludes with a suggestion that autistic people might benefit from technological progress in institutions and the availability of the option to prefer online contact for interactions that are not strictly necessary."
https://openalex.org/W4282968266,"Since the COVID-19 pandemic, the demand for online courses has increased enormously. Therefore, finding new methods to improve medical education is imperative.The aim of this study was to compare the self-reports of the individual student-centered virtual teaching techniques (seminar versus fishbowl) in a group of medical students.During the second semester of 2020, students in the clinical phase of the study (n = 144) participated in the optional subject of Sports Medicine. The students were divided into 2 groups. One group (n = 72) received the knowledge transfer in the form of a virtual seminar, the other group (n = 72) in the form of a virtual fishbowl.Virtual seminar and virtual fishbowl students gave insights into these teaching techniques. Most of the students from the virtual fishbowl group believed that the virtual fishbowl format allowed them to be more actively involved in learning. The mean quiz scores were statistically higher for students in the virtual fishbowl group than students in the virtual seminar group (p < 0. 001).This study concluded that virtual seminars and virtual fishbowl formats could be served as structured learning and teaching formats. At the same time, the virtual fishbowl format can promote an active exchange of knowledge from students' perspectives."
https://openalex.org/W4282975142,"Net primary productivity (NPP) plays an important role in the carbon cycle of an ecosystem. To explore the impact of unused land development on NPP, this study adopted an improved Carnegie Ames Stanford Approach (CASA) model to analyze the changes in NPP before and after the development of unused land in Tang County, Hebei Province, in 2000, 2007, and 2018. The results showed that, due to the changes in land use types from unused land, forestland, arable land with high NPP values to urban and rural residential land, traffic land with low NPP values, and the changes in precipitation and temperature, the NPP in the study area showed an overall trend of decreasing first and then rising from 2000 to 2018. Before the development of unused land in 2000, the total NPP was 38.45×10 10 g C. After the development in 2007 and 2018, the total NPP was 36.44×10 10 g C and 41.05×10 10 g C, respectively. The NPP of each land type in 2018 was arable land (1046.18 g C m -2 ) &gt; forestland (464.42 g C m -2 ) &gt; unused land (356.34 g C m -2 ) &gt; grassland (343.77 g C m -2 ) &gt; waters (182.56 g C m -2 ) &gt; urban and rural settlements (120.86 g C m -2 ) &gt; traffic land (120.70 g C m -2 ). The distribution of NPP was generally high in the north and low in the south before and after development. NPP was mainly concentrated in the interval of 300 g C m -2 yr -1 –400 g C m -2 yr -1 , and the range of NPP change was mostly within 100 g C m -2 . The influence of elevation, temperature and precipitation on the spatial distribution of NPP was significant. Elevation and precipitation were positively correlated with NPP, while temperature was negatively correlated with NPP. The increase in NPP mainly originated from the conversion of unused land to forestland and arable land. The loss of NPP was mainly due to the conversion from forestland with high vegetation productivity to a land use type with low vegetation productivity, such as the conversion from forestland to urban and rural residential land. The results can provide references for making reasonable land planning decisions and ecological environment construction."
https://openalex.org/W4282980531,"Schools provide a big opportunity for promoting the student's health, life skill, and behavior. Teachers play a fundamental role in the promotion and successful implementation of school health services. This study aimed to assess the level of involvement in the Health Promoting School program and its associated factors and to explore the benefits and barriers to involvement among high school teachers in Myanmar.A mixed methods explanatory sequential study was conducted among 194 high school teachers in Thanlyin Township, Yangon Region, Myanmar, from June to August 2020. Quantitative data were collected with the pretested structural questionnaire and analyzed by Chi-square tests and Fisher's exact tests. A qualitative strand was added by conducting in-depth interviews (n = 15, five teachers from each level of involvement: poor, medium, and good), analyzed by thematic content analysis.Of the 194 teachers, 23.7% had a good level of involvement in the Health Promoting School program. The factor associated with involvement in Health Promoting School program were age (p value < 0.001), duration of services (p value = 0.001), and a number of accomplished training-related school health (p value = 0.008). Qualitative data revealed that improvement of the health knowledge and awareness on health problems, the progress of healthy behaviors, development of physical and mental health, prevention of the disease spread, achievement of healthy and productive learning environment, and development of academic achievement were major benefits of teachers' involvement. Moreover, the main barriers to involvement were insufficient materials and human resources, time constraints, incompetence of the teachers, poor cooperation of school health partnerships, and insufficient awareness of parents.The proportion of good involvement in the Health Promoting School program among high school teachers was low in this study area. Providing sufficient human resources and material, conducting the on-the-job and refresher training, enhancing parent-teacher cooperation, and strengthening the community partnerships were crucial to improve the level of involvement and reduced the barriers for the achievement of the Health Promoting School program."
https://openalex.org/W4282981694,"Previous studies into Low Back Pain (LBP) assessed the effects of physical interventions or face-to-face (FTF) education mostly in western cultures. The present study aimed to compare the effects of multimedia and FTF pain management education (PME) on pain intensity and pain catastrophizing among participants with chronic LBP.This double-blind randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted on ninety participants with chronic LBP randomly allocated to either multimedia, FTF, or control groups. Participants in the multimedia group received PME through watching seven educational CDs at home and their counterparts in the FTF group received the same educations in seven weekly FTF educational sessions. Pain intensity (using a numerical rating scale) and pain catastrophizing (using the Pain Catastrophizing Scale) were assessed before, immediately after, and one month after the study intervention. The effects of the interventions were assessed using the repeated-measures multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). Effect size and minimal detectable change (MDC) were reported for both variables. The regression model used in the present study was Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE).The findings of MANOVA showed the significant effects of time on pain intensity and pain catastrophizing (P<0.001). The Tukey's test showed that before and immediately after the intervention, the mean scores of pain intensity and pain catastrophizing in the FTF and PME groups were significantly different from the control group (P<0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively). MDC did not show clinically significant changes in the mean score of pain intensity and GEE revealed significant difference among the groups.The findings suggested that multimedia PME is as effective as FTF education in reducing pain intensity and pain catastrophizing among participants with LBP. Future studies into the effects of education on LBP are recommended to consider longitudinal designs, a reliable cutoff score for pain catastrophizing, and participants' physical ability.IRCT20180313039074N1."
https://openalex.org/W4283021423,"Nasopulmonary mites (NPMs) of the family Halarachnidae are obligate endoparasites that colonize the respiratory tracts of mammals. NPMs damage surface epithelium resulting in mucosal irritation, respiratory illness, and secondary infection, yet the role of NPMs in facilitating pathogen invasion or dissemination between hosts remains unclear. Using 16S rRNA massively parallel amplicon sequencing of six hypervariable regions (or ""16S profiling""), we characterized the bacterial community of NPMs from 4 southern sea otters (Enhydra lutris nereis). This data was paired with detection of a priority pathogen, Streptococcus phocae, from NPMs infesting 16 southern sea otters and 9 California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) using nested conventional polymerase chain reaction (nPCR). The bacteriome of assessed NPMs was dominated by Mycoplasmataceae and Vibrionaceae, but at least 16 organisms with pathogenic potential were detected as well. Importantly, S. phocae was detected in 37% of NPM by nPCR and was also detected by 16S profiling. Detection of multiple organisms with pathogenic potential in or on NPMs suggests they may act as mechanical vectors of bacterial infection for marine mammals."
https://openalex.org/W4283026253,"Panama's HIV epidemic is far from under control. One of the populations with the fastest-growing epidemic among the Indigenous peoples of the Comarca Ngäbe-Buglé (CNB). The CNB is an administratively autonomous Indigenous region in Western Panama that is home to over 200,000 individuals of Ngäbe and Buglé ethnicities. This population is unique and, in several ways, represents the early stages of the AIDS epidemics in high-income countries. The CNB is the most impoverished region in Panama and is relatively isolated from outside influences, with limited roads, electricity, and an internet connection, including medical assistance. Around 1.5% of all rapid HIV tests are positive, compared to a national prevalence of 0.9%; in CNB, diagnosis tends to be late. In CNB, 56.3% of individuals had an initial CD4 count of <350 cells/mm3. Antiretroviral treatment (ART) dropout in this region is five times higher than the national average; there is high early mortality due to opportunistic infections. Using the Social-Ecological Theory for Health as a framework, this study aims to describe the facilitators and barriers associated with ART adherence and retention in HIV care among people living with HIV (PLHIV) in the CNB. A better understanding of factors that obstruct adherence could lead to more effective HIV care and prevention in CNB.We conducted 21 semi-structured interviews with PLHIV who reside across all three regions of the CNB and have attended an antiretroviral (ART) clinic at least once. Deductive thematic analysis was used to uncover themes related ART adherence and retention in HIV care at the individual, social and structural levels.This unique, isolated population of rural Indigenous peoples has high infection rates, late diagnosis, poor ART adherence, and high AIDS-related death rates. The CNB is an important region to examen ART adherence and retention in care. We determined that psychological health, social support, and discrimination acted as individual-level facilitators and barriers to adherence and retention. Notably, structural barriers included difficult access to ART care due to travel costs, ART shortages, and uncooperative Western/Traditional medical systems. Recommended interventions used in other Low- and Middle-Income settings include increasing peer and family-level support and community knowledge and understanding of HIV infection. Additionally, our study suggests structural interventions, including decreasing the cost and distance of traveling to the ART clinic, by decentralizing services, decreasing food scarcity, and increasing collaboration between Western and Traditional providers."
https://openalex.org/W4283029708,"This Korean population-based study aimed to describe the patterns of hypothyroidism after adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) in patients with breast cancer. The Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service database was searched for patients with invasive breast carcinomas. We calculated the cumulative incidence and incidence rates per 1,000 person-years of subsequent hypothyroidism and compared them using the log-rank test and the Cox proportional hazards model. Between 2007 and 2018, 117,135 women diagnosed with breast cancer with a median follow-up time of 4.6 years were identified. The 8-year incidence of hypothyroidism was 9.3% in patients treated with radiation and 8.6% in those treated without radiation (p = 0.002). The incidence rates per 1,000 person-years in the corresponding treatment groups were 6.2 and 5.7 cases, respectively. The hazard ratio (HR) in patients receiving RT was 1.081 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.013-1.134; p = 0.002). After mastectomy, RT showed a trend toward a higher risk of hypothyroidism (HR = 1.248; 95% CI, 0.977-1.595; p = 0.076). Our study provides one of the largest population-based data analyses regarding the risk of hypothyroidism among Korean patients with breast cancer. The adjusted risk for patients treated with RT exceeded that for patients with breast cancer treated without RT. The effect was evident immediately after treatment and lasted up to approximately 9 years."
https://openalex.org/W4282961560,"Introduction Delayed diagnosis contributes to the high burden and transmission of tuberculosis and extrapulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) and continued to be a major public health problem in Ethiopia. Currently, there is insufficient knowledge on the contributing factors to diagnostic delay of EPTB patients in healthcare settings in Ethiopia, because of unique cultural and societal issues in this country. This study assessed patients’ knowledge of symptoms and contributing factors of delay in diagnosis of EPTB patients at selected public health facilities in North Shewa zone, Ethiopia. Methods An institutional-based study was conducted from March to April 2021. All recently registered EPTB patients were included. Logistic regression was performed to analyze the data. A significant association was declared at a p-value of &lt; 0.05, and the results were presented with an adjusted odds ratio (AOR) and the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). Results In this study, only 15.5% of respondents knew EPTB symptoms. The median patient and healthcare system delay was 55 days. A patient delay of greater than 3 weeks and a health system delay of greater than 2 weeks were observed among 85.2% and 81% of patients, respectively. After the end of 5 weeks, 87.3% of EPTB patients had been diagnosed with the disease and the total median delay was 108.5 days. Living more than ten kilometers far from a health facility (AOR = 1.54; 95% CI = 1.11, 4.63), having never heard of EPTB disease (AOR = 5.52; 95% CI = 1.73, 17.56), and having ever taken antibiotics at the first health facility visit (AOR = 7.62; 95% CI = 2.26, 25.65) were associated with a total diagnostic delay of beyond 5 weeks. Conclusions The diagnostic delays of EPTB remain high. Both patient and health system delays equally contributed to the total diagnosis delay. Improving community awareness of EPTB and advancing diagnostic efficiencies of healthcare facilities could help reduce both delays."

We evaluated clinical performance of the Diagnostic Analyzer for Selective Hybridization (DASH) SARS-CoV-2 POC rapid PCR test.We conducted a cross-sectional study of adults with and without symptoms of COVID-19 at four clinical sites where we collected two bilateral anterior nasal swabs and information on COVID-19 symptoms, vaccination, and exposure. One swab was tested with the DASH SARS-CoV-2 POC PCR and the second in a central laboratory using Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 PCR. We assessed test concordance and calculated sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values using Xpert as the ""gold standard"".We enrolled 315 and analyzed 313 participants with median age 42 years; 65% were female, 62% symptomatic, 75% had received ≥2 doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, and 16% currently SARS-CoV-2 positive. There were concordant results for 307 tests indicating an overall agreement for DASH of 0.98 [95% CI 0.96, 0.99] compared to Xpert. DASH performed at 0.96 [95% CI 0.86, 1.00] sensitivity and 0.98 [95% CI 0.96, 1.00] specificity, with a positive predictive value of 0.85 [95% CI 0.73, 0.96] and negative predictive value of 0.996 [95% CI 0.99, 1.00]. The six discordant tests between DASH and Xpert all had high Ct values (>30) on the respective positive assay. DASH and Xpert Ct values were highly correlated (R = 0.89 [95% CI 0.81, 0.94]).DASH POC SARS-CoV-2 PCR was accurate, easy to use, and provided fast results (approximately 15 minutes) in real-life clinical settings with an overall performance similar to an EUA-approved laboratory-based PCR."

We used the relevant data to conduct descriptive statistics, linear regression, and Logistic regression analysis.After adjusting for age, sex, and race, as well as all other variables, serum albumin was significantly negatively related to DR (P<0.001). Furthermore, after controlling for confounding factors, the third quartile (Q3) and the fourth quartile (Q4) had quite a negative significant relationship with the incidence of DR (P<0.01). The second quartile had a significant positive correlation with DR, whereas the observed negative correlations were not statistically meaningful (P>0.05).Albumin levels in the serum have a quantitatively significant negative correlation with DR. Serum albumin levels in the blood can be used as a reference point for protracted follow-up of people with T2DM."

https://openalex.org/W4282981242,"Central sensitization is thought to play a critical role in the development of chronic pain, and secondary mechanical hyperalgesia is considered one of its hall-mark features. Consequently, interventions capable of modulating its development could have important therapeutic value. Non-invasive neuromodulation of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) has shown potential to reduce pain, both in healthy volunteers and in patients. Whether it can modulate the induction of central sensitization, however, is less well known.To determine whether multifocal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) targeting the left DLPFC affects the development of secondary mechanical hyperalgesia.In this within-subjects, cross-over, double-blinded study, eighteen healthy volunteers participated in three experimental sessions. After 20 minutes of either anodal, cathodal, or sham multichannel tDCS over the left DLPFC, secondary mechanical hyperalgesia was induced using high-frequency electrical stimulation (HFS) of the volar forearm. We assessed intensity of perception to 128 mN mechanical pinprick stimuli at baseline and up to 240 minutes after HFS. We also mapped the area of mechanical hyperalgesia.HFS resulted in a robust and unilateral increase in the intensity of perception to mechanical pinprick stimuli at the HFS arm, which was not different between tDCS stimulation conditions. However, the area of hyperalgesia was reduced after anodal tDCS compared to sham.Anodal tDCS over the left DLPFC modestly modulates the size of the HFS-induced area of secondary mechanical hyperalgesia, suggesting that non-invasive neuromodulation targeting the left DLPFC may be a potential intervention to limit the development of central sensitization."

Since the morphological characteristics of Qi-Nan germplasm are similar to those of Aquilaria species and germplasm is bred by grafting, it is difficult to determine the source species of this germplasm by traditional taxonomic characteristics. In this study, we performed a DNA barcoding analysis of 58 major Qi-Nan germplasms as well as Aquilaria sinensis , A . yunnanensis , A . crassna , A . malaccensis and A . hirta with 5 primers (nuclear gene internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) and the chloroplast genes matK , trnH-psbA , rbcL and trnL-trnF ). This field survey in the Qi-Nan germplasm plantations in Guangdong and Hainan Provinces aimed to accurately identify the source species of Qi-Nan germplasm. According to the results, ITS2 and matK showed the most variability and the highest divergence at all genetic distances. This ITS2 +matK combination, screened for with TaxonDNA analysis, showed the highest success rate in species identification of the Qi-Nan germplasm. Clustering in the phylogenetic trees constructed with Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood indicated that the Qi-Nan germplasm was most closely related to A . sinensis and more distantly related to A . yunnanensis , A . crassna , A . malaccensis and A . hirta . Therefore, this study determined that the source species of the Qi-Nan germplasm is A . sinensis ."

In contrast to pregnant women and adults, service delivery for children and adolescents living with HIV continues to lag behind with regard to access to care, components of care delivery, treatment options, and clinical and immunologic outcomes. Aim The aim of this systematic review is to synthesize the evidence on the most effective interventions, models, programs, and strategies to optimize the delivery of services for the testing, linkage, treatment and retention of children and adolescents living with HIV globally. Methods This review protocol is registered at PROSPERO with Registration number: CRD42020209553. The systematic review will be conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P). We will use a comprehensive search strategy to search several bibliographic databases including MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Global Health, and Psycinfo to identify relevant studies published in the last ten years (2010 to 2020). In addition, we will review cited and citing references of included studies. A pair of reviewers will independently screen titles, abstracts and full texts of articles, extract data from articles meeting inclusion criteria and perform quality assessments of the evidence collected. We will conduct a narrative synthesis of our findings, and if there are sufficient clinically similar studies available, we will conduct meta-analysis using a random-effects model. Discussion This review will provide evidence on service delivery models that have been evaluated in a range of settings to efficiently and effectively locate, link, treat and retain in care, children and adolescents living with HIV. The synthesized evidence will help guide national governments and health care providers in prioritizing and adopting evidence-based service delivery approaches for children and adolescents living with HIV.

https://openalex.org/W4283029269,"An experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of screw speed, feeding head speed, and the nature and type of granular material on the productivity and power consumption of a screw conveyor, and then determine the optimal speed. This experiment contains two parts. Part one was designed with 11 levels of screw speed (100-600r/min, interval 50r/min), three levels of feeding head speed (60,80 and 100r/min), and two kinds of granular materials (fine sand and soybeans). Part two was designed with 11 levels of screw speed (20-140r/min, interval 20r/min), three levels of feeding head speed (300,400 and 500r/min), and two kinds of granular materials (fine sand and soybeans). The results indicated that with the increase of the screw speed, the conveying performance will not always get better; with the rise of the feeding head speed, the conveying performance will get better. Due to the higher bulk density of sand, the productivity of conveying sand is higher for granular materials. Finally, for sand, the result indicates when the screw speed is 400r/min, and the feeding head speed is 120r/min, the conveying performance of sand determined by the productivity and power consumption is the best; for soybean, when the screw speed is 300r/min, and the feeding head speed is 140r/min, the conveying performance is the best."
https://openalex.org/W4283034506,"We urgently need answers to basic epidemiological questions regarding SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant and postpartum women and its effect on their newborns. While many national registries, health facilities, and research groups are collecting relevant data, we need a collaborative and methodologically rigorous approach to better combine these data and address knowledge gaps, especially those related to rare outcomes. We propose that using a sequential, prospective meta-analysis (PMA) is the best approach to generate data for policy- and practice-oriented guidelines. As the pandemic evolves, additional studies identified retrospectively by the steering committee or through living systematic reviews will be invited to participate in this PMA. Investigators can contribute to the PMA by either submitting individual patient data or running standardized code to generate aggregate data estimates. For the primary analysis, we will pool data using two-stage meta-analysis methods. The meta-analyses will be updated as additional data accrue in each contributing study and as additional studies meet study-specific time or data accrual thresholds for sharing. At the time of publication, investigators of 25 studies, including more than 76,000 pregnancies, in 41 countries had agreed to share data for this analysis. Among the included studies, 12 have a contemporaneous comparison group of pregnancies without COVID-19, and four studies include a comparison group of non-pregnant women of reproductive age with COVID-19. Protocols and updates will be maintained publicly. Results will be shared with key stakeholders, including the World Health Organization (WHO) Maternal, Newborn, Child, and Adolescent Health (MNCAH) Research Working Group. Data contributors will share results with local stakeholders. Scientific publications will be published in open-access journals on an ongoing basis."
https://openalex.org/W4282961245,"Cassava root rot disease is caused by a complex of soil-borne pathogens and has high economic impacts because it directly affects the tuberous roots, which are the main commercial product. This study aimed to evaluate cassava genotypes for resistance to root rot disease in a field with a previous history of high disease incidence. It also aimed to identify possible genomic regions associated with field resistance based on genome-wide association studies. A total of 148 genotypes from Embrapa Mandioca and Fruticultura were evaluated over two years, including improved materials and curated germplasms. Analysis of phenotypic data was conducted, as well as a genomic association analysis, based on the general linear model, mixed linear model, and fixed and random model circulating probability unification. The observed high disease index (ω) was directly correlated with genotype survival, affecting plant height, shoot yield, and fresh root yield. The genotypes were grouped into five clusters, which were classified according to level of root rot resistance (i.e., extremely susceptible, susceptible, moderately susceptible, moderately resistant, and resistant). The 10 genotypes with the best performance in the field were selected as potential progenitors for the development of segregating progenies. Estimates of genomic kinship between these genotypes ranged from -0.183 to 0.671. The genotypes BGM-1171 and BGM-1190 showed the lowest degree of kinship with the other selected sources of resistance. The genotypes BGM-0209, BGM-0398, and BGM-0659 showed negative kinship values with most elite varieties, while BGM-0659 presented negative kinship with all landraces. A genome-wide association analysis detected five significant single nucleotide polymorphisms related to defense mechanisms against biotic and abiotic stresses, with putative association with fresh root yield in soil infested with root rot pathogens. These findings can be utilized to develop molecular selection for root rot resistance in cassava."

https://openalex.org/W4282972339,"Many real-life problems boil down to a variant of the Minimum Steiner Tree Problem (STP). In telecommunications, Fiber-To-The-Home (FTTH) houses are clustered so they can be connected with fiber as cost-efficiently as possible. The cost calculation of a fiber installment can be formulated as a capacitated STP. Often, STP variants are solved with integer linear programs, which provide excellent solutions, though the running time costs increase quickly with graph size. Some geographical areas require graphs of over 20000 nodes—typically unattainable for integer linear programs. This paper presents an alternative approach. It extends the shortest path heuristic for the STP to a new heuristic that can construct solutions for the capacitated STP: the Capacitated Shortest Path Heuristic (CSPH). It is straightforward to implement, allowing many extensions. In experiments on realistic telecommunications datasets, CSPH finds solutions on average in time O (| V | 2 ), quadratic in the number of nodes, making it possible to solve 50000 node graphs in under a minute."

We have examined 283 intimate partner violence cases in which provisional suspension of criminal proceedings was applied. The decision as to whether defendants should be referred for social reintegration program attendance (G1) or not (G2) was made by the state prosecutor. Differences between G1 and G2 were identified: the victim’s age, couple living in a current relationship, drug-addicted defendant, intimate partner violence child exposure. However, defendants’ unemployment and drug abuse were the only two variables identified as a determinant for state prosecutor decisions. We believe that the effectiveness of state prosecution decision-making would benefit from: (a) systematically taking into account all intimate partner violence risk factors; (b) an index or checklist detailing what science reveals useful in intimate partner violence offenders’ social reintegration; (c) rehabilitation solutions based on the needs of each offender instead of a “one-size-fits-all” approach."

Brown Norway (BN) rat pregnancies are characterized by placental insufficiency, maternal hypertension, and proteinuria. We hypothesized that BN pregnancies would show renal functional, anatomical, or molecular features of preeclampsia. We used the Sprague-Dawley (CD) rat as a model of normal pregnancy. Pregnancy increased the glomerular filtration rate by 50% in CD rats and 12.2% in BN rats compared to non-pregnancy, and induced proteinuria only in BN rats. BN pregnancies showed a decrease in maternal plasma calcitriol levels, which correlated with renal downregulation of 1-alpha hydroxylase and upregulation of 24-hydroxylase. RNA sequencing revealed that pregnancy induced 297 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in CD rats and 174 DEGs in BN rats, indicating a 70% increased response to pregnancy in CD compared to BN rats. Pregnancy induced activation of innate immune pathways such as 'Role of Pattern Recognition Receptors', and 'Interferon signaling' with interferon regulatory factor 7 as a common upregulated upstream factor in both rat strains. Comparison of rat strain transcriptomic profiles revealed 475 DEGs at non-pregnancy and 569 DEGs at pregnancy with 205 DEGs shared at non-pregnancy (36%), indicating that pregnancy interacted with rat strain in regulating 64% of the DEGs. Pathway analysis revealed that pregnancy induced a switch in renal transcriptomics in BN rats from 'inhibition of renal damage' to 'acute phase reaction', 'recruitment of immune cells' and 'inhibition of 1,25-(OH)2-vitamin D synthesis'. Key upstream regulators included peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARA), platelet-derived growth factor B dimer (PDGF-BB), and NF-kB p65 (RELA). DNA methylome profiling by reduced representation bisulfite sequencing studies revealed that the DEGs did not correlate with changes in promoter methylation. In sum, BN rat kidneys respond to pregnancy-specific signals with an increase in pro-inflammatory gene networks and alteration of metabolic pathways including vitamin D deficiency in association with mild proteinuria and blunted GFR increase. However, the lack of glomerular endotheliosis and mild hypertension/proteinuria in pregnant BN rats limits the relevance of this rat strain for preeclampsia research."
