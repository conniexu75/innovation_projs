https://openalex.org/W1510308646,"The 39-43-amino acid amyloid beta-protein (A beta), which is progressively deposited in cerebral plaques and blood vessels in Alzheimer's disease (AD), is released by cultured human cells during normal metabolism. Here we show that agents which activate protein kinase C or otherwise enhance protein phosphorylation caused a substantial decrease in A beta production in vitro. Protein kinase C activation also markedly decreased A beta release from cells that express mutant forms of the beta-amyloid precursor protein genetically linked to familial AD. Inhibition of A beta secretion could also be effected by direct stimulation of m1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors with carbachol. These results demonstrate that activation of the protein kinase C signal transduction pathways down-regulates the generation of the amyloidogenic A beta peptide. Pharmacologic agents that activate this system, including a variety of first messengers, could potentially slow the development or growth of some A beta plaques during the early stages of AD."
https://openalex.org/W1572716768,"Phosphotyrosine-containing synthetic peptides were used to identify the binding sites for cellular polypeptides involved in nerve growth factor receptor/Trk-mediated signal transduction. In vitro association of SHC and the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase with the Trk tyrosine kinase was prevented only by phosphorylated Y-490- and Y-751-containing peptides, respectively. In spite of the close proximity of the p85 binding site to that of phospholipase C gamma (Y-785), both target proteins are able to interact with the same receptor molecule simultaneously."
https://openalex.org/W1542361020,"Hepatocyte growth factor activator (HGF activator) is a serine protease which converts single-chain HGF to the active two-chain form. HGF activator purified from human serum has a molecular mass of 34 kDa and consists of two chains held together by a disulfide bond. The nucleotide sequence of HGF activator cDNA shows that HGF activator is derived from the COOH-terminal region of a precursor of 655 amino acids by proteolytic cleavage of the bonds between Arg372 and Val373 and between Arg407 and Ile408 and that the precursor consists of multiple domains homologous to those observed in blood coagulation factor XII. In this study, we identified the precursor of HGF activator in human plasma using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system. The precursor was purified from plasma by a five-step procedure. The purified precursor did not activate single-chain HGF. The precursor was efficiently cleaved in vitro by thrombin, at the bond between Arg407 and Ile408, in the presence of negatively charged substances. The cleaved precursor activated single-chain HGF. These findings led us to conclude that HGF activator is present in plasma as an inactive zymogen and that the zymogen is activated by the cleavage of the bond between Arg407 and Ile408 by thrombin. Characteristic structural domains in the NH2-terminal region of the zymogen may be involved in the binding of the zymogen to negatively charged substances, which stimulates the activation of the zymogen by thrombin."
https://openalex.org/W1536933520,"Phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) was purified from lipoprotein-free human plasma, obtained upon treatment of plasma with dextran sulfate and Ca2+, by employing a series of column chromatography. Upon sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the purified PLTP showed a single main band, corresponding to the molecular mass of 78 kDa. However, isoelectric focusing of the purified preparation gave multiple bands with pI ranging from 4.3 to 5.1, indicative of microheterogeneity. Purified PLTP was shown to possess not only phospholipid transfer activity, but also high density lipoprotein (HDL) conversion activity (Tu, A.-Y., Nishida, H. I., and Nishida, T. (1990), FASEB J. 4, A2148; Jauhiainen, M., Metso, J., Pahlman, R., Blomqvist, S., van Tol, A., and Ehnholm, C. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 4032-4036). Isolated HDL3 was enlarged to the size of HDL2b upon incubation with purified PLTP for 6 h at 37 degrees C at the PLTP/HDL3 molar ratio of approximately 1:45. Both the HDL conversion and the phosphatidylcholine transfer activities of purified PLTP were effectively inhibited by rabbit anti-PLTP immunoglobulin G. The primary importance of PLTP in the HDL enlargement that occurs in human plasma upon incubation at 37 degrees C was shown by the strong inhibitory effect of the anti-PLTP immunoglobulin G. The process of PLTP-mediated HDL enlargement was accompanied by the release of apoproteins, primarily apoA-I. HDL3 enlargement mediated by PLTP was effectively inhibited by the addition of free fatty acids."
https://openalex.org/W1539205733,"The demonstration of type 2 activin receptor expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells prompted an investigation of the effects of the activin/inhibin family of hormones on vascular endothelial cell growth. Recombinant activin-A inhibited [3H]methylthymidine uptake and growth of a panel of endothelial cell types; recombinant inhibin-A was without effect. Affinity cross-linking studies demonstrated the presence of type 1 and type 2 activin receptors on the surface of bovine aortic endothelial cells, while detailed analysis of type 2 activin receptor expression revealed both type 2 and type 2B activin receptor mRNA in all endothelial cell types analyzed. In addition, capillary endothelial cells were found to express activin-beta A subunit mRNA and protein, the levels of which were increased in response to transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta. Furthermore, activin-A and TGF-beta caused additive inhibition of capillary endothelial cell [3H]methylthymidine uptake. These findings implicate the activins in the regulation of endothelial cell function, and suggest that TGF-beta and activin may interact to inhibit capillary endothelial cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W1482251675,"The enkephalins, dynorphins, and endorphins are endogenous opioids which function as neurotransmitters, neuromodulators, and hormones and are involved in the perception of pain, modulation of behavior, and regulation of autonomic and neuroendocrine function. Pharmacological studies have defined three classes of opioid receptors, designated as delta, kappa, and mu. To investigate mechanisms by which agonists and antagonists interact with the delta opioid receptor, we have substituted aspartic acid 95 in the transmembrane segment 2 of the cloned mouse delta opioid receptor with an asparagine (D95N). The D95N mutant receptor had reduced affinity for delta receptor-selective agonists such as enkephalin, [D-Pen2,D-Pen5]enkephalin and [D-Ser2,Leu5]enkephalin-Thr6 such that it did not bind these peptides even at micromolar concentrations. The binding of delta-selective non-peptide agonists was also reduced. In contrast, the delta receptor-selective antagonists, such as naltrindole, the benzofuran analog of naltrindole, and 7-benyllidenenaltrexone, bound equally well to the wild-type and mutant receptor. Similarly, non-selective opioid agonists such as bremazocine and buprenorphine, which interact with delta, kappa, and mu opioid receptors, showed no difference in binding to the wild-type and mutant delta receptor. The D95N mutant remained coupled to G proteins, and the receptor was functionally active since it mediated agonist inhibition of cAMP accumulation. These results indicate that selective agonists and antagonists bind differently to the delta receptor and show that Asp-95 contributes to high affinity delta-selective agonist binding. The identification of a key residue involved in selective agonist binding to the delta opioid receptor will facilitate the development of novel therapeutic reagents that can be used for the treatment of chronic pain and other conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1541183759,"Under lipid-poor conditions, most newly synthesized apolipoprotein B100 (apoB) undergoes rapid degradation in Hep G2 cells such that only a small fraction of newly synthesized apoB is actually secreted. Addition of oleate to Hep G2 culture medium stimulates apoB secretion by a post-translational mechanism. In the current studies we have explored oleate-stimulation of apoB secretion by using calpain inhibitor I, N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal (ALLN), a compound that inhibits the intracellular degradation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase and the T cell receptor alpha subunit. Preincubation of Hep G2 cells with ALLN (40 micrograms/ml) for 1 h markedly inhibited degradation of newly synthesized apoB. Whereas only 32% of newly labeled apoB remained intact (cells+medium) in control cells after a 10-min pulse with [3H]leucine followed by a 60-min chase, 84% of labeled apoB was intact in ALLN-treated cells. However, most of the ALLN-protected apoB remained intracellular, as ALLN did not stimulate the rate of apoB secretion over the control rate (12 versus 9.2%). Although secretion of apoB was not accelerated, the protection afforded by ALLN continued for several hours, and labeled apoB continued to be secreted over 3 h of chase after which secretion ceased. The protection afforded by ALLN resulted in 37% of labeled apoB secreted by 3 h compared to 15% in control cells. In contrast, simultaneous treatment of cells with ALLN and oleate both accelerated and increased total apoB secretion, such that 36% of initially labeled apoB was recovered in the medium by 60 min and 71% of labeled apoB was secreted by 180 min of chase. These data show that ALLN and oleate affect apoB metabolism by different mechanisms. Although ALLN can protect nascent apoB from rapid early intracellular degradation, it does not accelerate apoB secretion. In contrast, although our results can not rule out the possibility that oleate may directly inhibit proteolysis of apoB, oleate appears to protect apoB mainly by facilitating transport of apoB out of a protease-containing compartment associated with the endoplasmic reticulum."
https://openalex.org/W1601987904,"In our preceding paper, we reported that a temperature-sensitive Chinese hamster ovary cell mutant, PGS-S, with thermolabile phosphatidylglycerophosphate synthase was defective in the biogenesis of both phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin (CL) at a nonpermissive temperature (Ohtsuka, T., Nishijima, M., and Akamatsu, Y. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 22908-22913). To investigate the biological role of cardiolipin, we examined the structure and function of mitochondria in mutant PGS-S cells, since CL is primarily found in the mitochondrial membranes of eukaryotic cells. Under conditions where the formation of CL was impaired, this mutant had both morphological and functional mitochondrial abnormalities, manifested by more stringent temperature sensitivity for cell growth in glucose-deficient medium and by reduced ATP production, increased glycolysis, and reduced oxygen consumption in intact cells. Rotenone-sensitive NADH oxidase activity in cell extracts was also reduced in the mutant cultivated at a nonpermissive temperature, showing a defect(s) in the respiratory electron transport chain of mitochondria. Of the respiratory chain complexes, rotenone-sensitive NADH-ubiquinone reductase (Complex I) was most severely impaired in the mutant, whereas its activity was restored in a revertant of the mutant that had regained the ability to synthesize CL. These results suggest that CL plays a critical role in mitochondrial functions, at least in the respiratory electron transport chain."
https://openalex.org/W1550347145,"Glutamate, the major excitatory neurotransmitter of the mammalian central nervous system, is stored in synaptic vesicles and released by exocytosis upon depolarization of the presynaptic nerve terminal. Synaptic vesicles possess an active glutamate-specific transporter that is driven by an electrochemical proton gradient across the vesicle membrane and requires chloride for maximal activity. In this study, we have characterized the role of chloride in vesicular glutamate transport using 4,4‘-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2‘-disulfonic acid (DIDS), a potent inhibitor of anion translocators. DIDS inhibited glutamate uptake with an IC50 of 0.7 microM or less. In contrast, all energy gradient parameters (membrane potential, pH gradient, and ATPase activity) required at least 5-fold higher concentration of DIDS for inhibition. Furthermore, high concentrations of chloride but not of glutamate or other anions prevented DIDS inhibition of glutamate uptake. In contrast to uptake, glutamate efflux from glutamate-loaded vesicles was independent of chloride over a wide concentration range. However, efflux was still susceptible to DIDS inhibition. DIDS inhibition was prevented by excess chloride. We conclude that the vesicular glutamate transporter possesses a DIDS-sensitive chloride binding site on the cytoplasmic side, distinct from the substrate binding site, which regulates transport activity."
https://openalex.org/W1605841758,"By stopped-flow kinetic analysis, we have directly evaluated the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity of a number of organic nitroxides and iron- and manganese-based complexes that have been attributed with having SOD activity based upon competition experiments with cytochrome c. In 60 mM HEPES buffer, pH 8.1, or 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, Mn(II) and manganese complexes of desferal had no detectable SOD activity by stopped-flow analysis (catalytic rate constant (kcat) < 10(5.5) M-1 s-1), whereas Mn(II) and manganese complexes of desferal inhibited the reduction of cytochrome c by superoxide generated by the xanthine/xanthine oxidase system. Fe(II)-N,N,N',N'-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine (FeTPEN) was eight times more active than Fe(III)-tris[N-(2-pyridylmethyl)-2-aminoethyl]amine(Fe-TPAA) in the cytochrome c assay, but only FeTPAA catalyzed the first-order decay of superoxide (kcat = 2.15 x 10(6) M-1 s-1) by stopped-flow. Fe(III)-tetrakis(4-N-methylpyridyl)porphine (FeTMPP) was active at low micromolar concentrations in both the cytochrome c and stopped-flow assays. At high micromolar concentrations, the organic nitroxides 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-yloxy (TEMPO) and 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-yloxy (TEMPOL) were inhibitory in the cytochrome c assay, but showed no detectable SOD activity by stopped-flow. None of the tested compounds inhibited xanthine oxidase activity as shown by the measurement of urate production. Under the conditions of the cytochrome c assay, FeTPEN, TEMPO, and TEMPOL oxidized reduced cytochrome c which rationalizes the false positives for these compounds in this assay. The inhibitory activities of Mn(II) and the manganese desferal complexes in the cytochrome c assay appear to be due to a stoichiometric, not catalytic, reaction with superoxide as catalytic amounts of these agents do not induce a first-order decay of superoxide as shown by stopped-flow."
https://openalex.org/W1502711475,"Endothelium-derived relaxing factor, identified as nitric oxide (NO), is derived from a guanidino nitrogen of L-arginine via its metabolism by nitric oxide synthase. A newly developed aqua-chemiluminescence system was used to measure the amount of NO release from the isolated, perfused rat kidney concomitantly with the pressure changes (Kikuchi, K., Nagano, T., Hayakawa, H., Hirata, Y., and Hirobe, M. (1993) Anal. Chem. 65, 1794-1799). In normotensive rats, basal NO release was estimated to be 86 +/- 6 fmol min-1 (g of kidney weight)-1, and endothelium-dependent vasodilators increased NO release with a concomitant pressure reduction. Pretreatment of the kidney with detergents to damage the vascular endothelium diminished the responses of NO and perfusion pressure to acetylcholine, while infusion of authentic NO solution caused an increase in the chemiluminescence and a concomitant decrease in the pressure. The half-life of NO in O2-saturated Krebs-Henseleit buffer was determined as 6.41 s, and the decay constant (Kd) was 0.108 s-1. The measuring system involves a lag time of 15 s after passage of the solution through the kidney, so that the measured value is 13.0% of the true luminal NO concentration in the kidney, up to 400 pM. These observations enabled us to quantitate the degree to which NO released from the rat kidney changes perfusion pressure. Acetylcholine-induced vasodilation and NO release were markedly attenuated in deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt hypertensive rats, in which the endothelium is known to be markedly damaged. Thus, this assay system may make it possible to evaluate the extent of injury to the endothelium in conditions involving vascular damage."
https://openalex.org/W1587524494,"Calmodulin (CaM), the major intracellular receptor for calcium, is involved in regulation of diverse cellular functions. Positively charged amphipathic helical segments have been identified as an important structural motif in the recognition of CaM by different CaM-activated enzymes and peptides. The carboxyl-terminal domain of the envelope glycoproteins of human and simian immunodeficiency viruses (HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIV) contain regions that can fold into amphipathic helical segments, which closely resemble the amphipathic segments found in CaM-activated enzymes. We show here that synthetic peptide analogs corresponding to the two putative amphipathic helical regions of HIV-1/WMJ gp160 bind to CaM with high affinity (Kd 31-41 nM) in the presence of calcium. They also bind CaM in the absence of calcium, although with much lower affinity. The peptides inhibit CaM-regulated activation of bovine brain phosphodiesterase in vitro. The peptides also inhibit mitogen-induced lymphocyte activation, a property shared by CaM antagonists. Purified HIV-1 gp160 binds to CaM, while gp120, which lacks the putative amphipathic helical segments, does not bind CaM. In HIV-infected cells, the putative CaM-binding regions of gp160 are located intracellularly and may therefore interact with the cytosolic CaM. We postulate that CaM binding by HIV envelope proteins is likely to exert diverse modulatory effects, and the mechanism for HIV-induced cytotoxicity may involve, in part, inhibition of CaM-regulated cellular functions."
https://openalex.org/W1583686676,"Immunoprecipitation of DNA topoisomerase II from yeast results in a preparation that contains casein kinase II; this suggests that the two proteins may associate in the intact cell. Purified recombinant topoisomerase II and casein kinase II associate to form a complex in vitro which is stable after topoisomerase II becomes phosphorylated by the kinase. Studies with isolated recombinant casein kinase II subunits disclosed that although the alpha (catalytic) subunit alone can efficiently phosphorylate topoisomerase II, the formation of a stable topoisomerase II-casein kinase II association requires the presence of the beta subunit of the kinase. Both proteins engaged in this complex retain their catalytic activities. Naturally occurring polyamines and polyanionic compounds appear to be crucial factors governing the interaction between the two proteins. Although the biological significance of a stable catalytically active topoisomerase II-casein kinase II molecular complex remains to be defined, these observations suggest the possibility of a novel mechanism regulating topoisomerase II and casein kinase II activities."
https://openalex.org/W1577702300,"In human umbilical vein endothelial cells, activators of protein kinase C (PKC) exert cell cycle-dependent, bidirectional growth regulatory effects. Thus, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate or 1,2-dioctanoylglycerol potentiates growth factor-induced DNA synthesis up to 3-fold when they act during the early G1 phase, whereas they completely inhibit the initiation of DNA synthesis when they act in the late G1 phase. In addition, the PKC activators induce a rapid inhibition of the ongoing DNA synthesis when they are applied after entry into the S phase. The effects of the PKC activators in both stimulatory and inhibitory directions are abolished in PKC-downregulated cells. The cell cycle-dependent, PKC-mediated bidirectional growth regulation is closely associated with either potentiation or inhibition of RB protein phosphorylation and the histone H1 kinase activity of cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks) cdc2 and cdk2, which normally accumulate along the G1 to the S phase transition. Northern and Western blot analyses of cdc2 and cdk2 have revealed that PKC regulates the cdks at multiple steps in distinct ways. Thus, for cdc2, the levels of mRNA and protein as well as the extent of post-translational modification are all subject to the PKC-mediated regulation. In contrast, the level of mRNA or protein of cdk2 is not affected by PKC stimulation at any phase of the cell cycle. These results demonstrate the existence of a complex array of PKC-cdk signaling pathways, which mediate temporally organized bimodal growth regulation in endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W1505892283,"p56lck, a member of the src family of non-receptor protein tyrosine kinases, is expressed almost exclusively in cells of lymphoid origin. Recent evidence has implicated p56lck in a critical role both in T cell development and activation. A variety of T cell stimuli induce a shift in the electrophoretic mobility of p56lck from an apparent molecular mass of 56 kDa (p56lck) to 60 kDa (p60lck). This shift in electrophoretic mobility correlates with an increase in the phosphoserine content of the p60lck. We have shown that both 4 alpha-phorbol 12 beta-myristate acetate and OKT3 treatment of Jurkat cells, as well as 4 alpha-phorbol 12 beta-myristate acetate treatment of 171.CD4 and LSTRA cells, induced phosphorylation of serine-59 on p56lck in vivo, which correlated with the shift to p60lck. We also demonstrated that the same serine residue could be phosphorylated in vitro with mitogen-activated protein kinases and that this event was capable of reducing p56lck activity in vitro. Combined, these data suggest a novel pathway for the in vivo regulation of p56lck activity."
https://openalex.org/W1622026323,"The effects of cholesterol on the conformation and net charge of apoA-I have been investigated in homogeneous recombinant high density lipoprotein (HDL) particles. ApoA-I charge and structure in discoidal recombinant HDL complexes containing palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine and cholesterol have been quantitated by guanidine HCl denaturation, circular dichroism, electrokinetic analysis, and NMR spectroscopy of [13C]lysine-labeled apoA-I. In a discoidal particle containing 2 molecules of apoA-I and 160 molecules of palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine, apoA-I exhibits an alpha-helix content of 75%, and the particle has a net negative surface charge of -5.2e/mol of apoA-I at pH 8.6. Addition of 2 molecules of cholesterol to this complex has no significant effect upon particle size, but slightly decreases the net charge (-5.0e) and alpha-helix content (68%) of apoA-I and enhances the stability of the helical segments, as reflected by an increase in the free energy of unfolding from 2.9 to 3.5 kcal/mol. In contrast, increasing the cholesterol content to 20 molecules/particle progressively increases particle size and apoA-I net negative charge (-6.1e), and there is a concomitant reduction in the free energy of stabilization of the alpha-helical structure in apoA-I to 2.2 kcal/mol. (13CH3)2-Lys resonances from apoA-I in discoidal recombinant HDL exhibit six chemical shifts at pH 10; these peaks originate from dimethyl-Lys residues that have pKa values ranging from 8.4 to 10.3. The titration behavior of apoA-I Lys residues is generally similar in the presence and absence of cholesterol, except that 4 Lys residues titrate at a significantly higher pH in the presence of cholesterol. These data are consistent with cholesterol having a direct effect on apoA-I conformation and charge in HDL. Structural changes of this magnitude can affect the interactions between HDL and various plasma proteins and cell surfaces. It is therefore likely that the cholesterol content of HDL plays an important role in regulating the metabolism of this lipoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W1500251414,"The trans-prenyltransferase activity present in rat liver microsomes was investigated using an in vitro system. Geranyl-PP, but not farnesyl-PP is utilized as substrate. The pH optimum is at 8.0, and Mn2+ and Mg2+ activate, while Zn2+ completely inhibits the enzyme. Digitonin, taurodeoxycholate, and Tween 80 increase this activity, whereas deoxycholate and SDS are inhibitory. In contrast to the cis-prenyltransferase, the trans-prenyltransferase is not dependent on cytosolic protein factors. The trans-prenyltransferase is present at the cytoplasmic surface of rough and smooth microsomes. Solanesyl-PP and all-trans-geranylgeranyl-PP inhibit the transferase activity but poly-cis-polyprenyl-12-PP, an intermediate in the cis-prenyltransferase reaction, does not. The enzyme reaction gives rise to two products, solanesyl-PP and an unidentified polyprenyl metabolite. Mevinolin treatment distinguishes this enzyme from the cytoplasmic geranylgeranyl-PP synthase. The results demonstrate that rat liver microsomes synthesize solanesyl-PP via a trans-prenyltransferase, which is distinct from cis-prenyltransferase and geranylgeranyl-PP synthase."
https://openalex.org/W1585020772,"Mastoparan, a tetradecapeptide from wasp venom, stimulated exocytosis in a concentration-dependent manner, which was enhanced by pertussis toxin pre-treatment, in the insulin secreting beta-cell line RINm5F. Mastoparan (3-20 microM) also elevated cytosolic free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i), a rise that was not attenuated by nitrendipine. Divalent cation-free Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate (KRB) medium with 0.1 mM EGTA nullified the mastoparan-induced increase in [Ca2+]i, suggesting that the peptide increased Ca2+ influx but not through the L-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel. Depletion of the intracellular Ca2+ pool did not affect the mastoparan-induced elevation of [Ca2+]i. Remarkably, in divalent cation-free KRB medium with 0.1 mM EGTA and 2 microM thapsigargin in which mastoparan reduced [Ca2+]i, the mastoparan-stimulated insulin release was similar to that in normal Ca(2+)-containing KRB medium. Inhibitors of protein kinase C, such as bisindolylmaleimide, staurosporine, and 1-O-hexadecyl-2-O-methyl-rac-glycerol did not suppress the mastoparan-stimulated insulin release. Mastoparan at 10-20 microM did not increase cellular cAMP levels, nor did mastoparan at 5-10 microM affect [3H]arachidonic acid release. In conclusion, although mastoparan increased [Ca2+]i, this increase was not involved in the stimulation of insulin release. Rather, the data suggest that mastoparan directly stimulates exocytosis in a Ca(2+)-independent manner. As GTP-binding proteins (G proteins) are thought to be involved in the process of exocytosis and as mastoparan is known to exert at least some of its effects by activation of G proteins, an action of mastoparan to activate the putative stimulatory Ge (exocytosis) protein is likely."
https://openalex.org/W1514627997,"We have developed a novel method of reciprocal substitution mutation to identify pairing of amino acids within a receptor and its ligand. Using this method, we demonstrate for the first time that a pair of counterionic amino acids, one from the lutropin/choriogonadotropin receptor and the other from the ligand (human choriogonadotropin), cooperate and perhaps interact with each other to activate the receptor and to generate hormonal signal. In this study, Asp397 of the receptor was converted to Lys while Lys91 of the alpha subunit of human choriogonadotropin was substituted with Asp, thus maintaining the counterionic nature of this pair of amino acids. Mutation at each of these positions does not affect the hormone-receptor interaction but results in the significant or complete loss of the bioactivity of both the receptor and the hormone. However, when the impotent mutant receptor and mutant hormone were paired to interact together, they induced cAMP synthesis, resulting in a potent receptor-hormone couple. Substitutions with other amino acids that eliminated the counterionic nature failed to induce cAMP synthesis. Our results shed light on the molecular mechanisms of receptor activation and will serve as a model for other G-protein-coupled peptide receptors, particularly glycoprotein hormone receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1557003501,"Proliferation of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in atherosclerosis may be modulated by several growth regulatory molecules. At least two mitogens for SMCs, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) A-chain and heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF), can be produced by SMCs themselves and may stimulate smooth muscle proliferation in an autocrine or paracrine fashion. We examined the effects of thrombin, which may be generated at the site of vascular injury during atherogenesis, and the potent anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid, dexamethasone (DEX), on the expression of the genes encoding these two growth factors. Since both PDGF A-chain and HB-EGF have affinity for heparin, we also examined the effect of thrombin and DEX on the release of heparin binding mitogenic activity from SMCs. Treatment of SMCs with thrombin resulted in increases both in the level of the PDGF-A and HB-EGF transcripts in the cells, as well as in released heparin-binding growth factor activity. DEX inhibits the thrombin-stimulated release of mitogenic activity in a dose-dependent manner. An enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay showed that DEX inhibits both constitutive and thrombin-stimulated release of PDGF-AA. DEX also decreases both constitutive and thrombin-stimulated mRNA levels for PDGF A-chain and HB-EGF and destabilizes the transcripts for both growth factors. A nuclear run-on assay revealed that DEX acts, in addition, to inhibit constitutive and thrombin-stimulated transcription of the PDGF A-chain and HB-EGF genes. Thus, these findings indicate that expression of PDGF A-chain and HB-EGF may be regulated by thrombin and glucocorticoid at the transcription level. Our results are consistent with the involvement of thrombin-induced growth factor expression in neointimal SMC proliferation and suggest the possibility that intimal proliferation may be attenuated by glucocorticoids."
https://openalex.org/W1565332914,"Phosphatidylglycerophosphate (PGP) synthase catalyzes a reaction involved in the synthesis of phosphatidylglycerol (PG), which serves as a metabolic precursor for cardiolipin (CL), found primarily in the mitochondrial membranes of eukaryotic cells. We isolated a Chinese hamster ovary cell mutant (designated PGS-S) with a specific lesion in PGP synthase by using an in situ enzymatic assay for the enzyme. This mutant was obtained by introducing a second mutation into mutant PGS-P that had been generated by first-step mutagenesis. The PGP synthase activities in cell extracts of mutant PGS-S grown at 33 and 40 degrees C were 14 and 1% of those in the wild type cells, respectively; in addition, PGP synthase in cell extracts of mutant PGS-S exhibited higher sensitivity to heat than that of the wild type. Mutant PGS-S also showed a temperature-dependent defect in the synthesis of PG and CL in vivo, together with temperature sensitivity for cell growth. A temperature-resistant revertant of mutant PGS-S simultaneously restored PGP synthase activity and the ability to synthesize PG and CL in vivo to nearly the same levels as those of mutant PGS-P. These results constitute genetic evidence that PGP synthase is responsible for PG synthesis and is essential for cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W1607611516,"The acceptor substrate specificity of a pure polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase has been examined with synthetic polypeptides with sequences identical, or similar to those found in porcine mucin or human erythropoietin. The sequences adjacent to either threonine or serine markedly influence the formation of GalNAc-O-Thr and GalNAc-O-Ser. Examination of the mucin-like peptide VLGXXAV, where X is Thr, Ser, or Ala, shows only Thr-containing peptides to be acceptors. The best substrate is formed when XX is TT. Peptides with XX as either AT or TA are less effective and those with XX as either ST or TS are much less effective acceptors. The amino acids adjacent to serine in the peptide formed by residues 121-131 in human erythropoietin, PPDAASAAPLR, also markedly influence the formation of GalNAc-O-Ser. Thus, PPDASSSAPLR and PPDVVSVVPLR are about 5- and 30-fold, respectively, less active than the erythropoietin peptide. The peptide PPDGGSGGPLR is inactive. The shorter peptide DAASAAPL is also about 5-fold less active than the full-length peptide, but the peptide AASAA is inactive. These studies indicate that one transferase can form both GalNAc-O-Ser and GalNAc-O-Thr residues when the sequences adjacent to the glycosylated residue are of the proper kind. Thus, in contrast to earlier suggestions, there is no evidence that different transferases form GalNAc-O-Ser and GalNAc-O-Thr. Examination of tissue homogenates from various tissues confirms this conclusion."
https://openalex.org/W1601537695,"Abstract Transmembrane segments in integral membrane proteins exist characteristically as helices in lipid bilayers, yet are often rich in residues considered helix-destabilizing (Val, Ile, Gly) in soluble proteins. We propose that helicity of a transmembrane segment is likely to be affected by factors other than the intrinsic helical propensities of its component amino acids. This hypothesis is tested by comparing the conformation(s) in aqueous, organic, membrane-mimetic (micellar), and membrane (bilayer) environments of designed model peptides with systematically altered helical propensity and/or segmental hydrophobicity. Peptides of prototypic sequence NH2-(Ser-Lys)2-Ala5-Leu6-Ala7-Ala8-Leu9-Ala10-++ +Trp11-Ala12-Leu13-Ala14- (Lys-Ser)3-OH were synthesized, which incorporate a hydrophobic core guest segment (residues 5-14) into a water-soluble hydrophilic host matrix. Related peptides featured substitution of Leu6,9,13-->Gly, Leu6,9,13-->Ala, and Ala7,10,14-->Gly. Circular dichroism spectra revealed that algorithms for soluble proteins correctly predicted peptide helical proclivities in aqueous solutions, but peptide helicity in organic (trifluoroethanol) solvents, membrane-mimetic SDS micelles, and negatively charged lipid bilayer vesicles, was found to be governed almost exclusively by the segmental hydrophobicity of the peptide mid-hydrophobic core segment. In related Trp fluorescence studies, peptide-membrane association was similarly correlated with extent of hydrophobic interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1491350470,"Hydroxylation of aspartic acid to erythro-beta-aspartic acid (Hya) occurs in epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like modules in numerous extracellular proteins with diverse functions. Several EGF-like modules with the consensus sequence for hydroxylation bind Ca2+, and it has therefore been suggested that the hydroxyl group is essential for Ca2+ binding. To determine directly the influence of beta-hydroxylation on calcium binding in the EGF-like modules from coagulation factors IX and X, we have now measured calcium binding to both the fully beta-hydroxylated and the non-beta-hydroxylated modules of the two proteins. At low ionic strength, the Hya-containing module of factor X has a slightly higher Ca2+ affinity, but at physiological salt concentrations this difference is no longer significant for either factor IX or X. Analysis of the 1H NMR chemical shift differences between the hydroxylated and nonhydroxylated factor X modules show that hydroxylation has no effect on the domain fold. Furthermore, measurements on factor IX show that hydroxylation has no effect on the Ca2+/Mg2+ specificity of the ion binding site. We conclude that the hydroxyl group is not a direct ligand for the calcium ion in these EGF-like modules, nor is it essential for high-affinity Ca2+ binding."
https://openalex.org/W1496958175,"Urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) confers invasive potential to transformed cells. Cancer cells express high numbers of uPA receptors (uPARs), which concentrate uPA activity at the invasive edge of cancer cells and the tumor mass. We synthesized a conjugate between human uPA and saporin (SAP), a ribosome-inactivating protein produced by Saponaria officinalis. Results of cell-killing assays showed that uPA is very effective at targeting saporin specifically to uPAR-expressing cells, whereas cell lines devoid of uPARs were not affected by the conjugate. Receptor-bound uPA is internalized only upon formation of a complex with one of its inhibitors (PAIs). However, our conjugate was highly cytotoxic even when the interaction between uPA and PAIs was prevented. Moreover, the alpha 2-macroglobulin receptor, which has been reported to mediate the internalization of uPA.PAI complexes, seems not to be involved in cell killing caused by the uPA.SAP conjugate. Thus, uPA.SAP might follow a mechanism of internalization different from that of unconjugated uPA complexed to PAIs, although still uPAR-mediated. Our results also suggest that alpha 2-macroglobulin and/or its receptor could mediate the internalization and cytotoxicity of unconjugated saporin, as it has been shown for other toxins."
https://openalex.org/W1502602673,"We have studied the properties of beef heart mitochondrial F1 having inhibitory MgADP bound at one of the three catalytic sites and various levels of occupancy of the three noncatalytic nucleotide sites including zero, two, or three ADP/ATPs or two ADP/ATP plus one GTP. The properties examined include the rate of MgATP-dependent reactivation and the rate of increase in the fraction of F1 containing transiently bound intermediates. For each form of the enzyme tested, the rate of reactivation closely paralleled the rate of increase in the level of bound intermediates, indicating that when one catalytic site on F1 is blocked by inhibitory MgADP, the remaining two sites are incapable of residual uni- or bi-site activity. It was also found that the stability of the MgADP-inhibited complex decreases with full occupancy of the noncatalytic sites. This demonstrates that the noncatalytic sites modulate the properties of catalytic sites. Finally, it was found that the noncatalytic sites on mitochondrial F1 do not, as has long been believed, bind adenine nucleotides exclusively. Evidence is presented that both GTP and PPi bind tightly at noncatalytic sites."
https://openalex.org/W1596097790,"Serine hydroxymethyltransferase has a conserved lysine residue (Lys-229) that forms the internal aldimine with pyridoxal 5'-phosphate. In other pyridoxal 5'-phosphate enzymes investigated so far, this conserved lysine residue also plays a catalytic role as a base that removes the alpha-proton from the amino acid substrate. Three mutant forms of Escherichia coli serine hydroxymethyltransferase (K229Q, K229R, and K229H) were constructed, expressed, and purified. The absorbance spectra, rapid reaction kinetics, and thermal denaturation of the mutant analogs were studied. Only the K229Q mutant serine hydroxymethyltransferase resembled the wild-type enzyme. The results indicate that Lys-229 plays a critical role in expelling the product by converting the external aldimine to an internal aldimine. In the absence of Lys-229, ammonia can also catalyze the same function at a much slower rate. However, Lys-229 apparently is not the base that removes the alpha-proton from the amino acid substrate. The K229Q mutant enzyme could catalyze one turnover of either serine to glycine or glycine to serine at rates approaching those of the wild-type enzyme. After one turnover, the mutant enzyme could not expel the product and bind new substrate. The K229Q mutant enzyme can also transaminate D-alanine, which, like the hydroxymethyltransferase activity, also requires removing the alpha-proton from the substrate. The absorbance spectra of the K229R and K229H serine hydroxymethyltransferases showed that their pyridoxal 5'-phosphate could not readily form an external aldimine with substrates, suggesting that Lys-229 in the wild-type enzyme may never bear a positive charge, further evidence that it is not the base that removes the alpha-proton."
https://openalex.org/W1576537844,"We studied the abundance, subcellular distribution of a non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinase p72syk (Taniguchi, T., Kobayashi, T., Kondo, J., Takahashi, K., Nakamura, H., Suzuki, J., Nagai, K., Yamada, T., Nakamura, S., and Yamamura, H. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 15790-15796) in porcine polymorphonuclear neutrophils and the activation upon the stimulation with concanavalin A. The abundance was about 0.1% of total proteins and mainly distributed in the particulate fraction. Upon concanavalin A stimulation, the activity of p72syk increased within 30 s, attained to the maximum level at 1 min, and then returned to the basal level within 6 min. This activation was observed in a dose-dependent manner and abrogated by simultaneous addition of methyl alpha-mannopyranoside. When both extra- and intracellular Ca2+ were depleted, the activation of p72syk was still persistent; in contrast, the deactivation process was completely abrogated even at 6 min after stimulation. The replenishment of Ca2+ in the presence of A23187 resulted in a similar deactivation pattern as seen in the Ca(2+)-rich condition. In addition, genistein and herbimycin A, potent protein-tyrosine-kinase inhibitors, were capable of reducing concanavalin A-evoked p72syk activation and Ca2+ mobilization as well as the aggregation and lysozyme release. Furthermore, A23187-induced Ca2+ accumulation in inhibitor-treated cells resulted in the restoration of those cellular responses. These lines of evidence suggest that p72syk is activated with concanavalin A in a Ca(2+)-independent manner, participating in a mechanism of Ca2+ recruitment, and negatively regulated by a feedback mechanism through Ca2+ in neutrophils."
https://openalex.org/W1599584623,"The purified mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor (mBzR) is a complex comprising the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), adenine nucleotide carrier, and an 18-kDa protein that binds isoquinoline carboxamide ligands (McEnery, M. W., Snowman, A. M., Trifiletti, R. R., and Snyder, S. H. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 89, 3170-3174). An antiserum raised against the mBzR complex reacts selectively with VDAC and is used, along with purification, electrophysiological and immunohistochemical techniques, to characterize the properties and distribution of rat brain VDAC. Although purified VDAC displays biochemical and electrical conductance properties similar to VDAC from other sources, the immunohistochemical distribution of VDAC in rat brain is heterogeneous with pronounced regional variations; the pontine nuclei, the supraoptic nucleus, Purkinje cells of the cerebellum, and the caudate putamen evidence the highest density. The distribution of VDAC is inclusive of the more discretely localized 18-kDa mBzR protein, suggesting that only a portion of the total VDAC participates in the mBzR. The histochemical localizations of the mitochondrial marker enzymes glutamate dehydrogenase and cytochrome c oxidase also indicate marked regional variability in both mitochondrial content and composition. The discrete expression of VDAC reflects a striking heterogeneity of rat brain mitochondria and underlying differences in the utilization of mitochondrial outer membrane ion channels."
https://openalex.org/W1491566368,"It has been reported that the synthetic heptapeptide cholecystokinin (CCK) analogue JMV-180 evokes cytosolic Ca2+ signals in pancreatic acinar cells via mechanisms that do not include either the generation or action of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) (Saluja, A. K., Dawra, R. K., Lerch, M. M., and Steer, M. L. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 11202-11207; Yule, D. I., and Williams, J. A. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 13830-13835). We have now investigated the CCK- and JMV-180-evoked cytosolic Ca2+ oscillations by measurement of the Ca(2+)-sensitive ion currents in internally perfused mouse pancreatic acinar cells. We find that the InsP3 receptor antagonist heparin (500 micrograms/ml) blocks Ca2+ oscillations induced by both CCK (5-20 pM) and JMV 180 (10-40 nM), whereas de-N-sulfated heparin (500 micrograms/ml), which does not affect InsP3 binding to its receptor, fails to inhibit the responses to the two agonists. We conclude that the cytosolic Ca2+ oscillations evoked by both CCK and JMV-180 are dependent on functional InsP3 receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1558446072,"Lysine (Lys) residues in apolipoprotein (apo) E are known to be involved in binding of apoE-containing lipoproteins to the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor. To examine the microenvironments of the Lys residues of apoE-3 in a variety of lipid-associated states, we have used a high resolution 13C-NMR method in which Lys were reductively methylated with [13C] formaldehyde. Over a wide pH range, the spectrum of apoE in canine HDLc, a spherical lipoprotein particle, exhibited two peaks from Lys epsilon-amino groups. The two pools of Lys in HDLc titrate with pK alpha values of 10.4 (normal) and 9.3 (active). In contrast, eight epsilon-[13CH3]2Lys peaks (delta = 42.5-44.5 parts/million) with pK alpha values ranging from 8.2 to 10.1 and 7.8 to 10.5 were observed at pH 9.5 for human and canine apoE, respectively, in discoidal complexes with dimyristoyl glycerophosphocholine. A single Lys microenvironment was observed for apoE present in a disordered, lipid-free, state in 8 M urea, confirming the fact that the lipid environment is modulating the conformation of apoE. The above data demonstrate that the conformation of apoE, as reflected by the Lys microenvironments, on spherical HDLc particles is different from that on discoidal complexes."
https://openalex.org/W1511063261,"A series of mouse nerve growth factor (NGF) deletion mutants have been constructed using in vitro mutagenesis to define domains of the protein essential for its activity. Deletions of the amino or carboxyl termini of mature NGF or of an internal domain, which normally produces a surface-exposed reverse turn, have been analyzed. Mutants with deletions in the amino terminus or in the reverse turn retain significant biological activity, whereas, in contrast, a mutant NGF lacking the seven most carboxyl-terminal amino acids is appropriately synthesized but shows no measurable biological activity. These results suggests that the flexible carboxyl tail of NGF, and perhaps other neurotrophins, plays a crucial role in mediating receptor recognition and/or ligand binding."

https://openalex.org/W1602687090,"The inositol trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) in brain has been shown to be a substrate for several different protein kinases in vitro. We have studied the phosphorylation of the IP3R in intact cells by using isolated hepatocytes and an antibody to immunoprecipitate the receptor protein from detergent extracts. Stimulation of 32P-labeled hepatocytes with glucagon or N6,2'-O-dibutyryladenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (db-cAMP) markedly increased phosphorylation of the IP3R. However, no increase was observed in response to angiotensin II, vasopressin, 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate, or epidermal growth factor. The kinetics of phosphorylation in response to glucagon was both rapid and transient. In agreement with previous studies, physiological concentrations of Ca2+ stimulated D-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) binding to permeabilized hepatocytes (Pietri, F., Hilly, M., and Mauger, J.-P. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 17478-17485). Pretreatment of cells with db-cAMP had no effect on binding in the absence of added Ca2+ but enhanced binding measured in the presence of basal low concentrations (0.16-0.25 microM) of Ca2+ and decreased the concentration of Ca2+ required for half-maximal stimulation. The effect of db-cAMP was associated with an increase in affinity of the IP3 binding site without a change in maximum number of binding sites. Preincubation of intact hepatocytes with okadaic acid alone produced an increase in basal phosphorylation of the IP3R, and maximal phosphorylation of the receptor was observed in the presence of both okadaic acid and db-cAMP. However, okadaic acid blocked the effect of db-cAMP and inhibited the effect of Ca2+ on IP3 binding. Detergent-solubilized binding sites were already fully activated and insensitive to modulation by Ca2+ or cAMP-dependent protein kinase. It is proposed that the receptor in native membranes is inhibited and that Ca2+ and cAMP-dependent protein kinase may act to relieve this inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W1587348622,"Abstract Eggs of oviparous species must contain all components required for normal embryonic development. Among these, the vitamin riboflavin is deposited into egg white and yolk bound to the carrier protein, riboflavin-binding protein (ribBP). We have begun to investigate the mechanisms underlying ribBP transport pathways by molecular characterization of a relevant mutation in chicken. The autosomal recessive rd allele in Gallus gallus domesticus prevents the synthesis of functional ribBP and induces embryonic death on day 13. Polymerase chain reaction primers derived from the previously determined wild type cDNA sequence were used to amplify and clone cDNAs for ribBP from normal (Rd) and deficient (rd) animals. The rd allele was associated with a 100-nucleotide deletion in the messenger RNA for ribBP. Genomic clones were generated via polymerase chain reaction using primers flanking this 100-base pair deletion, and the resulting 2.1-kilobase pair clones were sequenced. The deletion in the rd ribBP cDNA corresponds precisely to an exon. The splice site following this exon contains a G-->A mutation at position 1 of the downstream 5'-splice donor sequence. The effect of this anomaly and the cause of the rd phenotype is the loss of the 100-base pair exon during the splicing process."
https://openalex.org/W1576505892,"A series of chemically synthesized trp and mutant operator DNAs was employed to examine trp repressor binding. Although only a single repressor-operator complex was observed for most DNAs as reported previously, varying DNA sequence revealed two retarded complexes with an additional band of faster mobility. The relative intensity of the two retarded bands with varying repressor concentrations suggests that cooperative interactions between dimers may occur in the formation of the predominant repressor-operator complex. Direct stoichiometry measurements demonstrated that a 2:1 stoichiometry (two dimers per operator) is found in the primary repressor-operator complex band and that a 1:1 stoichiometry is observed, when present, for the minor repressor-operator complex band of faster mobility. Similar retardation patterns with a single complex of 2:1 stoichiometry were observed for 40-base pair (bp) trp operators corresponding to TrpEDCBA, aroH, and Trp-PL (a derivative of TrpEDCBA with increased symmetry) operator sequences as well as to hybrid operators containing a half-binding site from TrpEDCBA in conjunction with lac operator sequences, although the apparent affinity for the half-site DNAs was diminished by 10-fold. In contrast, the prominence of the 1:1 dimer-operator complex for Trp-PR, a different derivative of TrpEDCBA with increased symmetry, suggests that sequence context may diminish cooperativity between dimers. The stoichiometry observed was also dependent on the length of TrpEDCBA operator DNA used, shifting from primarily 2:1 for 40- and 33-bp TrpEDCBA DNA to primarily 1:1 for 29-, 26-, and 20-bp TrpEDCBA DNAs. In addition, the stability of the repressor-operator complex to electrophoresis is reduced for DNA lengths of 33, 29, and 26 bp. Based on the binding data and footprinting patterns for two hybrid 40-bp TrpEDCBA/lac half-binding site DNAs, it appears that repressor associates tightly to the specific trp half-site, whereas the nonspecific half of the DNA is more loosely bound. These results suggest that repressor dimer-dimer interaction may be an important feature in the trp repressor-operator interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1554299549,"beta-Glucuronidase is an acid hydrolase located in both the lysosomal and microsomal compartments of the hepatocyte. The function of the latter remains undefined. We postulated that microsomal beta-glucuronidase may be responsible for the deconjugation of bilirubin-IX alpha glucuronides which are synthesized primarily in the hepatic microsomal compartment. We utilized two unique congenic strains of mice to characterize the role of hepatic beta-glucuronidase in the metabolism and disposition of bilirubin-IX alpha; the first exhibited less than 1% of total hepatic beta-glucuronidase activity (ATM), the second lacked only the microsomal enzyme activity (AT1). The biliary excretion of bilirubin-IX alpha conjugates was quantitated using reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Under basal conditions, there was a 2-fold increase in the biliary excretion of bilirubin-IX alpha monoglucuronides and total glucuronides in the AT1 and ATM mutants compared to the normal controls. When the plasma bilirubin-IX alpha level was increased to approximately 7 mg/dl to simulate hyperbilirubinemia, by intravenous administration of [14C]bilirubin-IX alpha, mathematical modeling of the biliary excretion curves of bilirubin-IX alpha glucuronides revealed qualitative differences between control and mutant animals, whereas both mutant groups were similar. Collectively, these data demonstrate that microsomal beta-glucuronidase modulates the net rate of bilirubin-IX alpha glucuronidation and glucuronide excretion in bile, under both basal and hyperbilirubinemic conditions, and that lysosomal beta-glucuronidase has no such effects. Hepatic microsomal beta-glucuronidase appears likely to influence the biliary excretion and hence the hepatic elimination of endogenous and xenobiotic substrates (e.g. carcinogens) which undergo hepatic glucuronidation."
https://openalex.org/W1506851181,"GTPase-activating protein (GAP) and neurofibromin, a gene product of neurofibromatosis type I gene, have been identified as factors that stimulate GTPase activity of ras p21. We have previously suggested the presence of novel GAP activity that is immunologically distinguishable from GAP or neurofibromin in both the cytosolic and the particulate fractions of rat brain (Hattori, S., Maekawa, M., and Nakamura, S. (1992) Oncogene 7, 481-485). We have purified this novel GAP molecule from the cytosolic fraction of rat brain by more than 200,000-fold by five successive column chromatographies with a recovery of 6%. Apparent molecular mass of this molecule was estimated to be 100 kDa (p100GAPras). The same p100GAPras was purified from the particulate fraction after extraction with high salt. The activation of GTPase was observed with normal ras p21 but not with oncogenic ras p21, Rap1B/smg21B, or Ram25K. The dissociation constant of p100GAPras toward ras p21 estimated by competitive inhibition using ras p21 in complex with nonhydrolyzable analog of GTP was two times higher than that of neurofibromin and was lower than that of GAP by 2 orders of magnitude. These results clearly indicate that p100GAPras is a novel ras GAP molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1588301798,"The fdhF mRNA for formate dehydrogenase H of Escherichia coli contains a UGA codon at position 140. This termination codon is decoded by selenocysteinyl tRNA (the selC product) with the aid of its own specific elongation factor, SelB. For this decoding, a unique secondary structure immediately downstream of the UGA codon has been shown to be essential (Zinoni, F., Heider, J., and Bock, A. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 87, 4660-4664). We examined the positional effect of the UGA codon relative to the secondary structure on its decoding using a fdhF-lacZ fusion gene. When the UGA codon was separated by one codon (position -1) from the secondary structure, the UGA decoding, as measured by the beta-galactosidase activity, dropped to approximately 76% of the normal level but was still almost as fully dependent upon selC and selenium in the culture medium as in the case of the UGA codon in the normal position (position 0). However, when the UGA codon was separated by two codons (position -2), the decoding level further dropped to 20% of the normal level, and in addition, became dependent only on selC but independent of selenium. When the UGA codon was further separated by three codons (position -3), the decoding level of UGA (-3) became higher than the decoding of UGA (-2) and was completely independent from selC and selenium, indicating that the UGA codon was nonspecifically suppressed. A similar nonspecific suppression was observed for the UGA codon at position -4, but at a lower level. When two UGA codons were tandemly placed at positions 0 and -1, they were still able to be decoded at 17% of the normal level in a selC- and selenium-dependent manner. In the absence of the SelB function, the decoding level of UGA(0) dropped to 1.6% of the normal level, whereas the UGA(-1) decoding dropped to 7.5%. These results indicate that the UGA codon at position 0 is not only most effectively decoded by selenocysteinyl tRNA but also tightly blocked from its nonspecific suppression in the absence of any components required for the decoding."

The Ca(2+)-dependent association of these proteins with quartz-supported planar membranes composed of mixtures of phosphatidylserine (2-10 mol%) and phosphatidylcholine was examined. Equilibrium binding measurements showed that the apparent equilibrium dissociation constants increased with decreasing molar fractions of phosphatidylserine and that the dissociation constants were somewhat lower for intact prothrombin. Kinetic measurements, using fluorescence photobleaching recovery, showed that the measured dissociation rates were approximately equivalent for prothrombin and fragment 1 and did not change with the protein solution concentration or the molar fraction of phosphatidylserine. The kinetic data also implied that the surface binding mechanism for both proteins is more complex than a simple reversible reaction between monovalent proteins and monovalent surface sites. Measured equilibrium and kinetic constants are reported and compared for prothrombin and fragment 1 on planar membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1604960793,"The yeast vacuolar H(+)-ATPase (V-ATPase) exhibits nonlinear hydrolysis kinetics, i.e. an initial rapid rate followed by a slower, steadily declining rate. Sulfite (50-100 mM) stimulates the yeast V-ATPase specifically during the latter period. Sulfite activation has been observed for the F-ATPases and archaebacterial ATPases and is thought to be caused by the release of tightly bound nucleotide at the catalytic site. However, turnover-dependent inactivation of the yeast V-ATPase, and sulfite stimulation, were only observed at MgATP concentrations > 1.0 mM. Below 1.0 mM MgATP, the hydrolysis time course was linear, and sulfite was inhibitory. The inhibition during the initial phase and the stimulation during the later phase of the time course could be accounted for by a 5.5-fold sulfite-induced increase in the apparent Km, and a small increase in the apparent Vmax. Sulfite also protected the enzyme against inhibition by cold inactivation and by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide but not by bafilomycin. Sulfite stimulation during the later phase was antagonized by delta mu H+, particularly by delta pH. In contrast to its effects on hydrolysis, sulfite inhibited the formation of a pH gradient at all times and failed to enhance the membrane potential even when delta pH was collapsed by nigericin. These results indicate that sulfite partially uncouples hydrolysis from proton transport in a way that preserves regulation by delta mu H+."
https://openalex.org/W1591510024,"Incubation of leaky or nonionic detergent-solubilized sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles in solutions containing magnesium, beryllium, and fluoride caused a time-dependent complete inhibition of calcium ATPase activity. The inhibited state persisted through dialysis for 2 days versus EGTA and was reversed within minutes by the presence of 0.5 mM calcium. Calcium-independent ATPase activity was unaffected. Omission of magnesium or fluoride resulted in retention of activity, while omission of beryllium produced slower inactivation, as described previously (Murphy, A. J., and Coll, R. J. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 5229-5235). Incubation of nonleaky vesicles had a similar effect, although it occurred more than 10-fold more slowly, suggesting that a component, probably beryllium, must enter the vesicles for inhibition to occur. By contrast, inhibition of nonleaky vesicles by magnesium and fluoride developed less than 2-fold more slowly. Including calcium in the incubation mixtures resulted in partial protection, so that the time course of CaATPase activity leveled off at nonzero values (for example, at 0.1 mM calcium, the activity leveled off at 43% of control). This result is most simply accounted for by a model involving simultaneous binding of calcium and a form of fluoroberyllium to the CaATPase (e.g. Ca2EMgBeFn)."
https://openalex.org/W1646351026,"Multiple disulfide bonds form in recombinant myosin light chain-2 mutants that contain an engineered cysteine at positions 2, 73, or 94, in addition to the endogenous cysteines at residues 126 and 155 (Saraswat, L.D., and Lowey, S. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 1977). By replacing one of the native cysteines with an alanine, mutants with a single pair of thiols were created: Cys2/Cys155, Cys2/Cys126, Cys73/Cys155 and Cys94/Cys155. Oxidation of these mutants resulted in a fast migrating band on nonreducing SDS gels, which was attributed to an intramolecular disulfide bond. To determine if disulfide formation could also occur when the light chains (LC) are bound to the myosin heavy chains, LCs were added to myosin which had been depleted of its native LC2 by an immunoadsorbent. When the reconstituted myosin was reacted with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) in the absence of divalent cations, intramolecular disulfide bonds formed in the mutant and wild type LCs, but the LCs did not remain bound to the myosin heavy chains. Addition of magnesium ions prevented LC dissociation, but intramolecular disulfide bonds no longer formed. Instead, mutants containing cysteines in the NH2-terminal domain formed intermolecular disulfide bonds between the two heads of myosin. The ability to cross-link the heads demonstrates the existence of close head/head interactions in the myosin molecule, a feature that may be essential for regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1510583609,"To study transactivation by the Xenopus laevis estrogen receptor (XER), we inserted one or two copies of a synthetic amphipathic helix at amino acid 276 of the XER. The XER mutants containing one or two copies of the amphipathic helix (XER/1AH and XER/2AH, respectively) and wild-type XER were expressed at similar levels. In transient transfection assays, XER/1AH exhibited only a modest, promoter-specific increase in transactivation. Constitutive (estrogen-independent) transcription of a synthetic promoter containing two estrogen response elements (EREs) was approximately 10-fold higher for the XER/2AH mutant than for wild-type XER. The XER/2AH mutant and wild-type XER exhibited similar 17 beta-estradiol dose-response curves for transactivation. In studies carried out over a broad range of DNA concentrations using the simple 2ERE-TATA promoter or a complex vitellogenin-derived promoter, the XER/2AH mutant exhibited an estrogen-dependent 2-3-fold increase in transactivation. A 2-3-fold increase in transactivation by XER/2AH was also observed using synthetic promoters in which the two EREs exhibit synergistic interactions with the NF1, AP1, or vitellogenin activator upstream activator sequences. Using a promoter interference assay to investigate intracellular interactions between the estrogen receptor and the ERE, we showed that binding of wild-type XER to the ERE was strongly estrogen-dependent. In the presence of 17 beta-estradiol, XER/2AH and wild-type XER exhibited similar promoter interference curves. In the absence of 17 beta-estradiol, the expression plasmid encoding the XER/2AH mutant achieved levels of promoter interference with 0.25-0.5 microgram of transfected DNA that were similar to those observed with 5-10 micrograms of the expression plasmid encoding wild-type XER. The ability of the XER/2AH mutant to activate transcription in the absence of estrogen therefore is likely to be related to the approximately 20-fold increase in its apparent ability to bind to the ERE. Since XER/2AH was unable to activate transcription from a glucocorticoid response element, enhanced binding of XER/2AH to the ERE did not result from a general increase in binding to DNA. The XER/2AH mutant appears to be the first nuclear receptor mutant to retain hormone-dependent transactivation and to exhibit enhanced hormone-independent binding to its hormone response element."
https://openalex.org/W1571021507,"We used human hepatoma Hep3B/C16 cells as a model to examine the effect of all-trans retinoic acid on the gene expression of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Hep3B/C16 is a clonal derivative of human hepatoma Hep3B cell which was stably transfected with HBsAg DNA sequences and can produce hepatitis B virus surface antigen. We analyzed the HBsAg product and mRNA in Hep3B/C16 cells which were exposed to retinoic acid for different periods of time. The level of HBsAg started to increase after 24 h and reached maximum at 48 h of retinoic acid treatment. However, the level of HBsAg expression was severely suppressed compared to the control cells after long term (120 h) retinoic acid treatment. Such biphasic regulation of HBsAg production by retinoic acid was paralleled by the changes of HBsAg mRNA. Nuclear run-on assays also demonstrated that the retinoic acid-mediated regulation was determined at least in part at the transcriptional level. Furthermore, an exposure of the cells to retinoic acid for only 8 h was sufficient to show that up- and down-regulation of HBsAg gene occurred 2 and 5 days later. Using a transient expression system, we demonstrated that the retinoic acid response element is located within the 5'-flanking region of the HBsAg gene."
https://openalex.org/W1662682458,"In certain instances, antibody variable region mutations outside of the antigen-combining site influence antigen binding. We reported previously that a heavy chain mutation (Ser-94-->Arg) decreased binding of the anti-digoxin antibody 40-150, whereas an additional signal peptide mutation at the -2 position (Gln-->Pro) causing NH2-terminal 2-residue truncation partially restored binding. To assess the combined effects on binding of two seemingly distant mutations, we constructed signal peptide mutations and NH2-terminal deletions in the presence of Ser-94 and Arg-94. Deletions of one to three amino acids had little effect on binding for Ser-94 mutants, whereas 2-residue truncations produced directly or by signal peptide mutation increased affinity approximately 40-fold for Arg-94 mutants. These observations are consistent with the reported computer-generated model of antibody 40-150. Introduction of Pro at the signal peptide -3 position in 40-150 resulted in cleavage at alternative sites, with varying effects on affinity. Introduction of Pro at -2 into the anti-digoxin antibody 26-10 resulted, unexpectedly, in expression of heavy chains with 3 extra NH2-terminal residues, causing an approximately 100-fold reduction in affinity. Thus, both extensions and deletions of the heavy chain amino terminus can enhance or reduce antigen binding, depending on the structural context of specific antigen combining sites."
https://openalex.org/W1541663996,"An expression vector for NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase containing a thrombin cleavage site directly before the N-terminal glycine residue of the flavoprotein was used to isolate the non-myristoylated enzyme by thrombin cleavage of the initial fusion protein of a short segment of the multiple cloning site of the plasmid vector and the reductase. This flavoprotein preparation, containing only the 28-residue N-terminal peptide segment of the membrane-binding domain of the mammalian enzyme, binds to phospholipid vesicles and interacts with membrane-bound cytochrome b5. The effect of N-myristoylation of the enzyme therefore appears to be limited to facilitating and stabilizing interactions with phospholipid vesicles. However, the relatively short intervening peptide sequence that separates the crucial peptide membrane-binding domain from lysine 41, which has been implicated in the active-site interaction with cytochrome b5 (Strittmatter, P., Kittler, J. M., Coghill, J. E., and Ozols, J. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 2519-2523), provides some limitation of the distance from the membrane surface for the interactions required for rapid electron transfer from the flavin of the reductase to the heme of cytochrome b5."
https://openalex.org/W107574857,"To probe the molecular mechanism of allosteric function of cobaltous protoporphyrin-substituted hemoglobin (CoHb), a series of alpha, alpha-cross-linked symmetric and asymmetric Fe-Co hybrid hemoglobins, which contain (1Co porphyrin/3Fe porphyrins), (2Co porphyrins/2Fe porphyrins), and (3Co porphyrins/1Fe porphyrin) per tetramer, have been prepared. Because only Fe porphyrin-containing subunits react with CO, these Fe-Co hybrids are converted to mono-, di-, and tri-CO-ligated states in the presence of CO, respectively, and are proposed to stand as models for mono-, di-, and tri-ligated intermediates of CoHb, respectively. The oxygen binding properties of these Fe-Co hybrids were investigated by measuring oxygen binding isotherms in the presence of CO as a function of pH in the presence and absence of IHP. The ligation of CO to a beta subunit causes larger changes in the oxygen affinity and the Bohr effect than that to an alpha subunit, indicating that the ligation to a beta subunit induces larger affinity-related structural changes in cross-linked CoHb. Di- and tri-CO-ligated intermediates exhibited substantially increased oxygen affinity, reduced Bohr effect, and reduced IHP effect, indicating that they are in high affinity states. Calculation of the Adair equilibrium constants for the first and last oxygenation steps for each of these intermediates permitted the determination of the level of free energy of cooperation. The intermediately ligated species of cross-linked CoHb are distributed in multiple levels of free energy of cooperation within the free energy difference of 1.14 kcal mol-1 between deoxy and fully ligated states of cross-linked CoHb at pH 7.4. The ligation process in CoHb is determined by the number and distribution of the bound ligands, and ligation takes place through steps that require minimal free energy changes."
https://openalex.org/W1498591284,"The effect of retinoic acid (RA) on the uptake and utilization of extracellular amino acids by fetal lung fibroblasts was examined. RA decreased the incorporation of [3H]proline into collagen and other proteins. The effect was maximal at a RA concentration of 10(-5) M; smaller decreases were observed at a RA concentration of 10(-6) M. This decrease in collagen formation was associated with a large decrease in intracellular [3H] proline. The decrease in intracellular [3H]proline was first observed at 2 h following the addition of RA to cell cultures. Transport studies employing radiolabeled amino acids revealed that RA decreased the uptake of proline, 2-aminoisobutyric acid, and 2-(methylamino)isobutyric acid but not leucine or methionine. Kinetic analysis of 2-aminoisobutyric acid uptake indicated that this effect was mediated primarily by an increase in apparent Km, with a lesser decrease in Vmax, RA-induced inhibition of proline uptake was not abolished by the presence of cycloheximide nor by pretreatment with indomethacin. Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity was not affected by RA treatment. These results suggest that RA modulates protein production in fibroblasts by altering the function of the Na(+)-dependent A transport system for amino acid uptake."
https://openalex.org/W1561498107,"The present investigation examined the glucose transporter (GLUT) transcript levels in glucose-grown rat L6 myoblasts, which possessed a high (HAHT) and a low (LAHT) affinity hexose transport system. The most prominent GLUT transcript detected in these cells was a GLUT 3-recognizable 4.1-kilobase transcript. Mutants defective in HAHT contained only residual levels of the GLUT 3 transcript and transporter. Corresponding changes in GLUT 3 transcript levels and HAHT activity were observed in myotubes, confluent cultures, and myogenesis-impaired cells. The other prominent GLUT transcripts detected were the GLUT 4-recognizable 2.8- and 1.4-kilobase transcripts. The close correlation between the GLUT 4 isoform and LAHT activity was indicated by the absence of this isoform in LAHT- mutants, and their corresponding changes in myoblasts grown under different conditions. These findings suggested the HAHT and LAHT transporters might be coded or regulated by the genes responsible for the GLUT 3 and 4 transcripts, respectively. Although relatively high levels of the GLUT 1 transcript and transporter were detected in glucose-grown HAHT-LAHT- mutants, these cells did not exhibit any GLUT 1 transport activity. Since the GLUT 1 transporter was not functional, it was not likely responsible for the HAHT and LAHT activities observed in glucose-grown L6 myoblasts."
