https://openalex.org/W2008294451,"The bacterial macrolide rapamycin is an efficacious anticancer agent against solid tumors. In a hypoxic environment, the increase in mass of solid tumors is dependent on the recruitment of mitogens and nutrients. When nutrient concentrations change, particularly those of essential amino acids, the mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) functions in regulatory pathways that control ribosome biogenesis and cell growth. In bacteria, ribosome biogenesis is independently regulated by amino acids and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Here we demonstrate that the mTOR pathway is influenced by the intracellular concentration of ATP, independent of the abundance of amino acids, and that mTOR itself is an ATP sensor."
https://openalex.org/W2061491996,"The mechanisms controlling neural stem cell proliferation are poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that the PTEN tumor suppressor plays an important role in regulating neural stem/progenitor cells in vivo and in vitro. Mice lacking PTEN exhibited enlarged, histoarchitecturally abnormal brains, which resulted from increased cell proliferation, decreased cell death, and enlarged cell size. Neurosphere cultures revealed a greater proliferation capacity for tripotent Pten-/- central nervous system stem/progenitor cells, which can be attributed, at least in part, to a shortened cell cycle. However, cell fate commitments of the progenitors were largely undisturbed. Our results suggest that PTEN negatively regulates neural stem cell proliferation."

https://openalex.org/W2034468530,"SNAREs (soluble NSF-attachment protein receptors) are generally acknowledged as central components of membrane fusion reactions, but their precise function has remained enigmatic. Competing hypotheses suggest roles for SNAREs in mediating the specificity of fusion, catalyzing fusion, or actually executing fusion. We generated knockout mice lacking synaptobrevin/VAMP 2, the vesicular SNARE protein responsible for synaptic vesicle fusion in forebrain synapses, to make use of the exquisite temporal resolution of electrophysiology in measuring fusion. In the absence of synaptobrevin 2, spontaneous synaptic vesicle fusion and fusion induced by hypertonic sucrose were decreased approximately 10-fold, but fast Ca2+-triggered fusion was decreased more than 100-fold. Thus, synaptobrevin 2 may function in catalyzing fusion reactions and stabilizing fusion intermediates but is not absolutely required for synaptic fusion."

https://openalex.org/W2166224338,"A new class of microwires can be assembled by dielectrophoresis from suspensions of metallic nanoparticles. The wires are formed in the gaps between planar electrodes and can grow faster than 50 micrometers per second to lengths exceeding 5 millimeters. They have good ohmic conductance and automatically form electrical connections to conductive islands or particles. The thickness and the fractal dimension of the wires can be controlled, and composite wires with a metallic core surrounded by a latex shell can be assembled. The simple assembly process and their high surface-to-volume ratio make these structures promising for wet electronic and bioelectronic circuits."
https://openalex.org/W2047645785,"Systematic changes in the chemistry of evaporated seawater contained in primary fluid inclusions in marine halites indicate that seawater chemistry has fluctuated during the Phanerozoic. The fluctuations are in phase with oscillations in seafloor spreading rates, volcanism, global sea level, and the primary mineralogies of marine limestones and evaporites. The data suggest that seawater had high Mg 2+ /Ca 2+ ratios (&gt;2.5) and relatively high Na + concentrations during the Late Precambrian [544 to 543 million years ago (Ma)], Permian (258 to 251 Ma), and Tertiary through the present (40 to 0 Ma), when aragonite and MgSO 4 salts were the dominant marine precipitates. Conversely, seawater had low Mg 2+ /Ca 2+ ratios (&lt;2.3) and relatively low Na + concentrations during the Cambrian (540 to 520 Ma), Silurian (440 to 418 Ma), and Cretaceous (124 to 94 Ma), when calcite was the dominant nonskeletal carbonate and K-, Mg-, and Ca-bearing chloride salts, were the only potash evaporites."
https://openalex.org/W1996686613,"Cytokinins are a class of phytohormones involved in various physiological events of plants. The Arabidopsis sensor histidine kinase CRE1 was recently reported to be a cytokinin receptor. We used a steroid-inducible system to show that the transcription factor–type response regulator ARR1 directs transcriptional activation of the ARR6 gene, which responds to cytokinins without de novo protein synthesis. This fact, together with characteristics of ARR1 -overexpressing plants and arr1 mutant plants, indicates that the phosphorelay to ARR1, probably from CRE1, constitutes an intracellular signal transduction occurring immediately after cytokinin perception."

https://openalex.org/W1512072195,"The reversible tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins, modulated by the coordinated actions of protein-tyrosine kinases and protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), regulates the cellular response to a wide variety of stimuli. It is established that protein kinases possess discrete sets of substrates and that substrate recognition is often dictated by the presence of consensus phosphorylation sites. Here, we have extended this concept to the PTPs and demonstrated that (E/D)-pY-pY-(R/K) is a consensus substrate recognition motif for PTP1B. We have shown that JAK2 and TYK2 are substrates of PTP1B and that the substrate recognition site within theses kinases is similar to the site of dephosphorylation previously identified within the insulin receptor. A substrate-trapping mutant of PTP1B formed a stable interaction with JAK2 and TYK2 in response to interferon stimulation. Expression of wild type or substrate-trapping mutant PTP1B inhibited interferon-dependent transcriptional activation. Finally, mouse embryo fibroblasts deficient in PTP1B displayed subtle changes in tyrosine phosphorylation, including hyperphosphorylation of JAK2. The closely related JAK family member, JAK1, which does not match the consensus dephosphorylation site, was not recognized as a substrate. These data illustrate that PTP1B may be an important physiological regulator of cytokine signaling and that it may be possible to derive consensus substrate recognition motifs for other members of the PTP family, which may then be used to predict novel physiological substrates."
https://openalex.org/W2013081383,"The mushroom bodies, substructures of the Drosophila brain, are involved in olfactory learning and short-term memory, but their role in long-term memory is unknown. Here we show that the alpha-lobes-absent (ala) mutant lacks either the two vertical lobes of the mushroom body or two of the three median lobes which contain branches of vertical lobe neurons. This unique phenotype allows analysis of mushroom body function. Long-term memory required the presence of the vertical lobes but not the median lobes. Short-term memory was normal in flies without either vertical lobes or the two median lobes studied."

https://openalex.org/W1990308563,"The Arabidopsis thaliana response regulator 4, expressed in response to phytochrome B action, specifically interacts with the extreme amino-terminus of the photoreceptor. The response regulator 4 stabilizes the active Pfr form of phytochrome B in yeast and in planta, thus elevates the level of the active photoreceptor in vivo. Accordingly, transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing the response regulator 4 display hypersensitivity to red light but not to light of other wavelengths. We propose that the response regulator 4 acts as an output element of a two-component system that modulates red light signaling on the level of the phytochrome B photoreceptor."
https://openalex.org/W2035070093,"In the exocytosis of neurotransmitter, fusion pore opening represents the first instant of fluid contact between the vesicle lumen and extracellular space. The existence of the fusion pore has been established by electrical measurements, but its molecular composition is unknown. The possibility that synaptotagmin regulates fusion pores was investigated with amperometry to monitor exocytosis of single dense-core vesicles. Overexpression of synaptotagmin I prolonged the time from fusion pore opening to dilation, whereas synaptotagmin IV shortened this time. Both synaptotagmin isoforms reduced norepinephrine flux through open fusion pores. Thus, synaptotagmin interacts with fusion pores, possibly by associating with a core complex of membrane proteins and/or lipid."
https://openalex.org/W2169601134,"Human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) Vpr expression halts the proliferation of human cells at or near the G2 cell-cycle checkpoint. The transition from G2 to mitosis is normally controlled by changes in the state of phosphorylation and subcellular compartmentalization of key cell-cycle regulatory proteins. In studies of the intracellular trafficking of these regulators, we unexpectedly found that wild-type Vpr, but not Vpr mutants impaired for G2 arrest, induced transient, localized herniations in the nuclear envelope (NE). These herniations were associated with defects in the nuclear lamina. Intermittently, these herniations ruptured, resulting in the mixing of nuclear and cytoplasmic components. These Vpr-induced NE changes probably contribute to the observed cell-cycle arrest."
https://openalex.org/W2055627344,"Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) is a pleiotropic cytokine with a proposed role in obesity-related insulin resistance. This could be mediated by increased lipolysis in adipose tissue resulting in elevated free fatty acid levels. The early intracellular signals entailed in TNF-α-mediated lipolysis are unknown but may involve members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family. We investigated the possible contribution of MAPK in TNF-α-induced lipolysis in human preadipocytes. TNF-α activated the three mammalian MAPK, p44/42, JNK, and p38, in a distinct time- and concentration-dependent manner. TNF-α also induced a concentration-dependent stimulation of lipolysis with a more than 3-fold increase at the maximal dose. Lipolysis was completely inhibited by blockers specific for p44/42 (PD98059) and JNK (dimetylaminopurine) but was not affected by the p38 blocker SB203580. Use of receptor-specific TNF-α mutants showed that activation of MAPK is entirely mediated by the TNFR1 receptor. The results in human preadipocytes differed from those obtained in murine 3T3-L1 adipocytes in which all three MAPK were constitutively active. Thus, studies of intracellular signaling pathways obtained in different cellular contexts should be interpreted with caution. In conclusion, although TNF-α activates all three known MAPK in human preadipocytes, only p44/42 and JNK appear to be involved in the regulation of lipolysis.

Krakower G.R. Sonnenberg G.E. Hennes M.I. Bray G.A. Bouchard C. James W.D. Handbook of Obesity. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1998: 601-636Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms underlying this close association are still not clear but are thought to involve, among others, factors produced by the adipose tissue. A wealth of studies in recent years has implicated tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)1 in this process (2Sethi J.K. Hotamisligil G.S. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 19-29Google Scholar). TNF-α was first described as a potent regulator of apoptosis and is well known for its central role in the immune system (3Tracey K.J. Cerami A. Annu. Rev. Med. 1994; 45: 491-503Google Scholar). Soluble TNF-α is a 17-kDa molecule (4Decoster E. Vanhaesebroeck B. Vandenabeele P. Grooten J. Fiers W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18473-18478Google Scholar) that signals through two different receptors termed TNFR1 and TNFR2 (for tumor necrosis factor receptor; in humans also termed p60 and p80 based on their apparent size in gel electrophoresis). Most cell types, including adipocytes, have the capacity to produce varying amounts of TNF-α and its receptors. The involvement of TNF-α in obesity-induced insulin resistance is based, among other things, on the following observations in cell lines, animals, and humans: (i) TNF-α mRNA and protein levels are increased in adipose tissue of overweight subjects and in animal models of obesity and insulin resistance (5Hotamisligil G.S. Shargill N.S. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1993; 259: 87-91Google Scholar). (ii) TNF-α regulates the expression of several genes associated with glucose and lipid metabolism, e.g. the glucose transporter GLUT-4, lipoprotein lipase, and the atherogenic protein plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (6Samad F. Loskutoff D.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 781: 652-655Google Scholar, 7Stephens J.M. Lee J. Pilch P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 971-976Google Scholar). (iii) TNF-α has direct inhibitory effects on insulin receptor signaling by inhibition of autophosphorylation and/or effects on downstream signaling components (8Hotamisligil G.S. Peraldi P. Budavari A. Ellis R. White M.F. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1996; 271: 665-668Google Scholar). (iv) Administration of TNF-α-neutralizing antibodies in vivo ameliorates insulin resistance in obese rodents (5Hotamisligil G.S. Shargill N.S. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1993; 259: 87-91Google Scholar). (v) Finally, gene ablation experiments in mice have demonstrated that a lack of TNF-α enhances peripheral insulin sensitivity (9Uysal K.T. Wiesbrock S.M. Marino M.W. Hotamisligil G.S. Nature. 1997; 389: 610-614Google Scholar, 10Ventre J. Doebber T. Wu M. MacNaul K. Stevens K. Pasparakis M. Kollias G. Moller D.E. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1526-1531Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms underlying TNF-α-mediated insulin resistance have raised considerable attention. Several lines of evidence suggest that TNF-α may at least in part act through an indirect mechanism by up-regulating circulating free fatty acid (FFA) levels (11Boden G. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 3-10Google Scholar). FFA are released by adipose tissue in a process termed lipolysis in which stored triglycerides are broken down into FFA and glycerol. FFA levels are elevated in obesity and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and chronic elevation of FFA promotes insulin resistance (11Boden G. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 3-10Google Scholar). Prolonged treatment (6–24 h) of adipocytes with TNF-α in vitro stimulates lipolysis (12Hauner H. Petruschke T. Russ M. Eckel J. Diabetologia. 1995; 38: 764-771Google Scholar). TNF-α gene knockout mice exhibit lower circulating FFA and are protected from obesity-induced insulin resistance (9Uysal K.T. Wiesbrock S.M. Marino M.W. Hotamisligil G.S. Nature. 1997; 389: 610-614Google Scholar), whereas the infusion of TNF-α in rodents (13Evans R.D. Ilic V. Williamson D.H. Clin. Sci. (Colch). 1992; 82: 205-209Google Scholar, 14Lang C.H. Dobrescu C. Bagby G.J. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 43-52Google Scholar, 15Miles P.D. Romeo O.M. Higo K. Cohen A. Rafaat K. Olefsky J.M. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1678-1683Google Scholar) or humans (16Starnes H.F.J. Warren R.S. Jeevanandam M. Gabrilove J.L. Larchian W. Oettgen H.F. Brennan M.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 1321-1325Google Scholar, 17Van der Poll T. Romijn J.A. Endert E. Borm J.J. Buller H.R. Sauerwein H.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: E457-E465Google Scholar) results in increased plasma FFA and systemic insulin resistance. Certain clinical conditions such as cachexia are associated with increased TNF-α levels, activated lipolysis, and high circulating FFA levels in combination with insulin resistance (18Tisdale M.J. J. Nutr. 1999; 129 (S-246S)2443Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent studies have demonstrated that the novel class of insulin-sensitizing antidiabetic agents, thiazolidinediones, inhibit TNF-α-induced lipolysis in murine adipocytes (19Souza S.C. Yamamoto M.T. Franciosa M.D. Lien P. Greenberg A.S. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 691-695Google Scholar). Pretreatment of lean rats with a thiazolidinedione for 10 days prevents the increase in circulating FFAs and ensuing insulin resistance induced by TNF-α infusion (15Miles P.D. Romeo O.M. Higo K. Cohen A. Rafaat K. Olefsky J.M. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1678-1683Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that TNF-α-induced lipolysis and thereby augmented FFA release may be one of the mechanisms by which the cytokine promotes insulin resistance. The intracellular signaling pathways involved in this regulation are, however, still unknown. Studies in non-fat tissue have shown that TNF-α, upon binding and oligomerization of TNFR1 and TNFR2, induces several distinct signaling cascades. TNF-α regulates de novo gene expression through activation of transcription factors, and members of the family of signaling proteins termed mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) play an essential role in this respect. These molecules propagate signals from the cell surface to the nucleus in defined phosphorylation cascades, and some effects of TNF-α are transduced by MAPK (20Kyriakis J.M. Gene Expr. 1999; 7: 217-231Google Scholar). MAPK, in turn, phosphorylate and activate an array of transcription factors. There are three distinct mammalian MAPK groups, the p44/42 (also termed extracellular signal-regulated kinases, ERK1/2), p38 (also termed stress/cytokine-activated kinases) and c-Jun-NH2-terminal kinases (JNK, also termed stress-activated protein kinases, SAPK). The role of MAPK in fat cells is at present unclear. Data obtained in murine cell lines indicate that some of the MAPK can be activated by TNF-α, but their importance in lipolysis is unknown (21Jain R.G. Phelps K.D. Pekala P.H. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 179: 58-66Google Scholar). We hypothesized that members of the MAPK are involved in mediating the lipolytic action of TNF-α in human adipocytes and that inhibition of one or several of these pathways could abrogate the lipolytic effect of TNF-α. As a model system, we chose primary cultures of human preadipocytes, which offer the advantage of a prolonged survival when compared with mature adipocytes. Subcutaneous adipose tissue was obtained from otherwise healthy obese subjects who underwent surgery for non-malignant disorders. None were on any regular medication. No selection was made for age (range 23–53 years), gender, or body mass index (range 26–44 kg/m2). The study was approved by the Ethics Committee at Huddinge Hospital. All subjects gave their informed consent to participate in the study. Specimens from subcutaneous adipose tissue were obtained within 30–45 min after the onset of surgery. All subjects fasted overnight, and only saline was administered until the tissue pieces were taken. In general, 25–35 g of adipose tissue was obtained, which yielded two or three 24-well plates of preadipocytes. Isolation and differentiation of preadipocytes was performed as described previously (22Hauner H. Entenmann G. Wabitsch M. Gaillard D. Ailhaud G. Negrel R. Pfeiffer E.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 1663-1670Google Scholar). Tissue specimens were transported in saline to the laboratory, where fibrous material and blood vessels were carefully dissected and discarded. The remaining tissue was cut into fragments of ∼5–10 mg and incubated with 0.5 g/liter collagenase (Sigma) in Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) supplemented with 40 g/liter dialyzed bovine serum albumin (fraction V, Sigma) for 1 h at 37 °C in a shaking bath. A 5:1 volume ratio of incubation solution and fat tissue was used. The treated fat tissue was filtered through a nylon mesh with a 250-μm pore size, and remaining fibrous material was discarded. The cell suspension was centrifuged at 200 ×g for 10 min at room temperature. The supernatant (containing mature adipocytes) was discarded, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of erythrocyte lysis buffer (0.154 mNH4Cl, 5.7 mm K2HPO4, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.3) for 10 min. Following a centrifugation step, cells were resuspended in 10 ml of DMEM/F12 medium (Invitrogen, Paisley, Scotland) and filtered through a nylon filter with a 70-μm pore size. After an additional centrifugation, the cell fraction was resuspended in DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 100 mg/liter penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were seeded into 12- or 24-well plates at a density of ∼50,000 cells/cm2 and kept at 37 °C in 5.3 kPa of CO2 for 18–20 h. This initial incubation in fetal calf serum improves overall cell survival. Cells were then washed twice with DMEM/F12 medium and re-fed a chemically defined serum-free medium (DMEM/F12, supplemented with 100 nm cortisol, 66 nm insulin, 15 mm HEPES, 1 nmtriiodothyronine, 33 μm biotin, 17 μmpantothenate, 10 μg/ml transferrin, 100 mg/liter penicillin/streptomycin, and 2.5 μg/ml amphotericin B). To differentiate the cells, a thiazolidinedione, rosiglitazone (Invitrogen, 49653, kindly provided by Smith Kline Beecham Pharmaceuticals, Harlow, Essex, UK), was added during the 14-day differentiation process to a final concentration of 10 μm(days 1–14). Cells were maintained in the medium at 37 °C and in 5.3 kPa of CO2 for a total of 16 days; medium was changed every 3 days. After 14–16 days of culture, more than 70% of the preadipocytes displayed a round shape with a cytoplasm completely filled with multiple fat droplets. Only cultures with a differentiation density ≥70% were used in experiments. Plates containing more than 5% contaminating endothelial cells were discarded. Differentiation was assessed using Oil-Red-O staining. Cells were fixed in 7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, and triglyceride contents were stained with 1% Oil-Red-O in 99% isopropyl alcohol. After repeated washings with water, the Oil-Red-O was dissolved in 100% isopropyl alcohol, and the optical density of the solution was measured at 500 nm. An empty well treated in the same way was used as a blank. Differentiation was also determined by direct counting of differentiated cells under the microscope. Three well diameters were counted from left to right within 30 min; cells were regarded as differentiated when they displayed a round shape and the cytoplasm was completely filled with multiple fat droplets. In some experiments, differentiation was additionally determined by quantifying glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) activity as described previously (Ref. 22Hauner H. Entenmann G. Wabitsch M. Gaillard D. Ailhaud G. Negrel R. Pfeiffer E.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 1663-1670Google Scholar and data not shown). Expression of the adipocyte-specific enzyme hormone-sensitive lipase was additionally detected and assessed by Western blot using a human-specific antibody (a gift from Dr C. Holm, Lund University, Sweden, data not shown). Viability was assessed by staining with 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT). Briefly, differentiated cells were grown in 12-well plates and incubated for 48 h in medium without or with increasing concentrations of TNF-α. Cells were then washed twice with modified Eagle's medium (without phenol red) and subsequently incubated in 1 mg/ml MTT in modified Eagle's medium without phenol red for 3 h at 37 °C. Supernatants were discarded, and cells were dissolved in 0.5 ml of isopropyl alcohol. Absorbance was measured at 570 nm, and data from TNF-α-treated wells were expressed relative to control wells to obtain a cell survival index. 3T3-L1 cells were cultured and differentiated as described previously (23Shimizu M. Blaak E.E. Lonnqvist F. Gafvels M.E. Arner P. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 78: 254-263Google Scholar). In brief, cells were grown into confluence in complete growth medium (DMEM/F12 Glutamax II, 45000 mg/liter glucose, 10% iron-supplemented bovine calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin). At 2–3 days after confluence, the medium was changed to differentiation medium (DM), day = 0 (DMEM/F12 Glutamax II, 4500 mg/liter glucose, 10% iron-supplemented fetal calf serum, 0.5 mm isobutylmethylxanthine, 1 μmdexamethasone, 10 μg/ml bovine insulin and penicillin/streptomycin). After 48 h in DM, this was changed into post-differentiation medium (PDF, identical to DM but without dexamethasone or isobutylmethylxanthine). At day 7 in PDF, ∼90% of the cells had differentiated. After 14 days of differentiation, preadipocytes were incubated in the presence of increasing concentrations of TNF-α or in the presence of 100 ng/ml TNF-α in combination with the specific MAPK inhibitors: DMAP (dimetylaminopurine), PD98059, and SB203580 (all from Sigma) in BRL49653 free medium. All inhibitors were added 2 h before the initiation of stimulation to diminish intrinsic activity to a minimum. After 48 h (16th day of differentiation), the medium was removed, and cells were washed with DMEM/F12 medium and subsequently incubated for 3 h in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 20 g/liter BSA. The medium was removed and kept for measuring the glycerol concentration as an index of lipolysis using a bioluminescence method (Hellmer et al. (39Hellmer J. Arner P. Lundin A. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 132-137Google Scholar)). Preadipocytes were lysed in a buffer containing Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris base, 150 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitors. The total amount of protein was measured using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Glycerol concentrations were expressed per grams of protein. Preadipocytes were differentiated as described above for 14 days followed by a 48-h incubation in medium lacking BRL49653. At day 16, cells were stimulated for either 5 or 30 min in the presence of increasing concentrations of TNF-α ranging from 0.01–100 ng/ml, with or without each of the MAPK-inhibitors. Inhibitors were added 2 h before stimulation to diminish intrinsic phosphorylation to a minimum. All incubations were performed in triplicates or quadruplicates. Background activity was assessed in wells lysed before TNF-α stimulation, termedt = 0. Following the incubation, cells were immediately lysed in an ice-cold buffer supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors as supplied by the manufacturer (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Wells incubated in the absence of TNF-α were termed control samples. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 min at +4 °C, and the supernatant was removed to new tubes. Equal amounts of cell lysates from each sample were boiled in 1× SDS loading buffer for 5 min and loaded and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gels were then blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences, Inc., Little Chalfont, UK) by Western blotting. Blots were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T) and 5% non-fat dried milk and subsequently incubated overnight at +4 °C in the presence of antibodies specific for phosphorylated forms of p38, p44/42, and JNK as described by the manufacturer (New England Biolabs). Following washing steps in TBS-T and incubation with secondary anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, antigen-antibody complexes were detected by chemiluminescence (LumiGlo®, New England Biolabs) and exposed to high-performance chemiluminescence film (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Films were scanned, and specific bands were quantified using the NIH Image software. To control for differences in gel loading, sample concentration etc, blots were subsequently stripped and incubated with antibodies that recognized both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms of p38, p44/42 and JNK, respectively. Assessment of p44/42 kinase activity was performed with a kit of reagents from New England Biolabs and used according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Values are given as means ± S.E.. Student's t test was used where indicated.p < 0.05 (two-sided) was regarded as statistically significant. Human preadipocytes were isolated and differentiated in a defined medium supplemented with rosiglitazone, a potent agonist of the adipocyte-specific transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ. Sixteen days after plating, more than 70% of the cells displayed classical characteristics of mature adipocytes such as expression of the adipocyte-specific enzyme GPDH, hormone-sensitive lipase, and lipid accumulation (data not shown, see “Experimental Procedures”). Differentiation rate was consistently above 70%, and contamination with endothelial cells was minimal. Prolonged stimulation with TNF-α in these cells results in enhanced lipolysis, which is first observed after 6 h (12Hauner H. Petruschke T. Russ M. Eckel J. Diabetologia. 1995; 38: 764-771Google Scholar). Adipocytes were washed and incubated in the presence of increasing amounts of TNF-α (0.1–100 ng/ml). Previous studies have demonstrated that maximum TNF-α-induced lipolysis is observed at the earliest after 6–24 h (12Hauner H. Petruschke T. Russ M. Eckel J. Diabetologia. 1995; 38: 764-771Google Scholar). We chose 48 h as a suitable incubation period in order to obtain maximum stimulation. At the end of the treatment, the medium was removed, and lipolysis was measured as the amount of released glycerol following a 3 h-incubation in cell medium. As determined by visual inspection, viability of the cell cultures at the end of each experiment was not overtly affected by the prolonged exposure to TNF-α. However, in accordance with previous studies (24Prins J.B. Niesler C.U. Winterford C.M. Bright N.A. Siddle K. O'Rahilly S. Walker N.I. Cameron D.P. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1939-1944Google Scholar), a small decrease (≈15%) in cell survival, measured with the use of the vital stain MTT, could be observed at high concentrations (100 ng/ml, Fig. 1A). In contrast, when differentiation and viability was assessed as GPDH activity relative to protein content, there was no difference at any concentration of TNF-α (Fig. 1B). Thus, to control for even small differences in cell survival, glycerol release was expressed relative to total protein content in each well. A TNF-α concentration-dependent increase in lipolysis was observed with a small effect already at 1 ng/ml. A maximum stimulation was obtained between 10 and 100 ng/ml, reaching an average of 2-fold stimulation of basal lipolysis (Fig.2A, n = 3). Taking together data from all performed lipolysis experiments (n = 13), 100 ng/ml TNF-α induced a 3.3-fold increase in lipolysis (44.26 ± 8.56 and 143.87 ± 32.5 μmol of glycerol/g of protein, control and TNF-α-treated, respectively,p < 0.001).Figure 2TNF-α-induced lipolysis in human preadipocytes is blocked by MAPK inhibitors.Preadipocytes were incubated in the presence of increasing concentrations of TNF-α for 48 h (A). A concentration-dependent increase in lipolysis was observed reaching a maximum level at 10 ng/ml. Error bars indicate S.E. for n = 3 experiments. Preadipocytes were incubated as described under “Experimental Procedures” in either control (ctrl) medium or 100 ng/ml TNF-α (B). MAPK inhibitors were added 2 h prior to TNF-α stimulation. None of the inhibitors affected basal lipolysis. PD98059 (PD) and DMAP (inhibitors of p44/42 and JNK activation, respectively) but not SB203580 (SB, inhibitor of the p38-pathway) abrogated TNF-α-induced lipolysis completely.

Error bars indicate S.E. for n = 9 experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To map signals involved in TNF-α-induced lipolysis, we focused on members of the MAPK family. We obtained well characterized inhibitors specific for the three different MAPK pathways, SB203580 for p38 (25De Cesaris P. Starace D. Riccioli A. Padula F. Filippini A. Ziparo E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 272: 7566-7571Google Scholar), PD98059 for p44/42 (an inhibitor of MAP/ERK kinase 1/2, the kinase immediately upstream of p44/42) (26Alessi D. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D. Saltiel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Google Scholar), and dimethylaminopurine (DMAP) for JNK/SAPK (27Marino M.W. Dunbar J.D. Wu L.W. Ngaiza J.R. Han H.M. Guo D. Matsushita M. Nairn A.C. Zhang Y. Kolesnick R. Jaffe E.A. Donner D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28624-28629Google Scholar). These were initially added to the cells at concentrations known to be effective in other cell systems (25De Cesaris P. Starace D. Riccioli A. Padula F. Filippini A. Ziparo E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 272: 7566-7571Google Scholar, 26Alessi D. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D. Saltiel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Google Scholar, 27Marino M.W. Dunbar J.D. Wu L.W. Ngaiza J.R. Han H.M. Guo D. Matsushita M. Nairn A.C. Zhang Y. Kolesnick R. Jaffe E.A. Donner D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28624-28629Google Scholar). To minimize background activity, cells were incubated for 2 h in the presence of the inhibitor prior to stimulation with 100 ng/ml TNF-α. Interestingly, although 75 μm PD98059 and 1 mm DMAP did not affect basal lipolysis, they displayed a potent inhibitory effect on TNF-α-stimulated lipolysis (Fig. 2B). In contrast, 20 μm SB203580 had no effect on basal or TNF-α-induced lipolysis rates under these conditions (Fig. 2B). The maximum effective concentration of PD98059 and DMAP was subsequently determined in separate concentration-response experiments (data not shown). Visual inspection and measurement of GPDH activity showed that the blockers did not appreciably alter the viability of the cell cultures either per se or in combination with TNF-α. Taken together, these results indicate that p44/42 and JNK (but not p38) are involved in regulating TNF-α-mediated lipolysis. To obtain a more detailed analysis of the MAPK pathways activated by TNF-α, we obtained antibodies specific for the phosphorylated forms of p38, p44/42, and JNK. Cells were incubated in increasing concentrations of TNF-α for either 5 or 30 min, and Western blot analysis demonstrated that TNF-α could potently induce the phosphorylation of p38 with a half-maximal effect (EC50) at ∼1 ng/ml (Fig.3A). This effect was observed already after 5 min and was sustained at 30 min of incubation (data not shown). Activation of JNK was also concentration-dependent with a half-maximal stimulation at ∼0.5 ng/ml (Fig. 3B). However, in contrast to p38, JNK phosphorylation was only observed after 30 min of incubation. Finally, p44/42 appeared to be constitutively phosphorylated, and no apparent change in the degree of phosphorylation was observed at any concentration or time point (Fig.3C). To control for differences in gel loading and sample concentration, all blots were stripped and incubated with antibodies that recognized both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms of each MAPK (Fig. 3, lower panels). As our results indicated that p44/42 and JNK could be involved in TNF-α-induced lipolysis, we next focused on the effect of PD98059 and DMAP on the activity and phosphorylation status of their cognate MAPK. The finding that p44/42 appeared to be constitutively phosphorylated was intriguing given that PD98059, an inhibitor of p44/42 activation, blocked TNF-α-induced lipolysis. Because phosphorylation is not equivalent with enzymatic activity, we obtained a kit specifically designed to assess kinase activity of p44/42 (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Briefly, this method involves the immunoprecipitation of phosphorylated p44/42, which is then used in an in vitrokinase assay in the presence of recombinant elk-1, a target transcription factor for p44/42. Phosphorylated elk-1 is subsequently detected by Western blot analysis in which the degree of elk-1 phosphorylation is directly proportional to p44/42 activity. By this method, we could easily observe a potent TNF-α-induced stimulation of p44/42 enzymatic activity, which was fully inhibited by 75 μm PD98059, a concentration that completely inhibits TNF-α-induced lipolysis (Fig. 4). The specificity of PD98059 was assessed in separate experiments, demonstrating that phosphorylation of p38 and JNK by TNF-α was not affected (data not shown). The inhibition of JNK by DMAP was directly assessed by Western blot analysis. The concentration of 1 mm DMAP, which effectively inhibited the lipolytic action of TNF-α, resulted in an approximate 10-fold reduction of JNK phosphorylation (Fig.5). Moreover, this effect was specific because DMAP did not affect the phosphorylation status of either p38 or p44/42 (data not shown). Our results demonstrate that TNF-α is a potent inducer of MAPK signaling pathways in human adipocytes. To evaluate which receptor is responsible for this activation, we obtained mutated variants of TNF-α that specifically bind to either TNFR1 (TNF-α R32W/S86T) or TNFR2 (TNF-α D143N/A145R) (28Loetscher H. Stueber D. Banner D. Mackay F. Lesslauer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26350-26357Google Scholar). Cells were stimulated in the presence of a broad concentration range of each agonist, and TNF-α-induced phosphorylation was assessed as described above. Although the TNFR1 agonist could clearly induce p38 and JNK phosphorylation in a concentration-dependent manner, the TNFR2 agonist did not appreciably affect the phosphorylation status of either protein (Fig. 6). Unfortunately, the limited availability of these recombinant TNF-α forms prevented us from studying the enzymatic activation of p44/42 (or the effect of the mutants on lipolysis). However our results suggest that MAPK activation by TNF-α is predominant"

We show that the KH-QUA2 region of SF1 defines an enlarged KH (hn RNP K) fold which is necessary and sufficient for BPS binding. The 3' part of the BPS (UAAC), including the conserved branch point adenosine (underlined), is specifically recognized in a hydrophobic cleft formed by the Gly-Pro-Arg-Gly motif and the variable loop of the KH domain. The QUA2 region recognizes the 5' nucleotides of the BPS (ACU). The branch point adenosine acting as the nucleophile in the first biochemical step of splicing is deeply buried.

https://openalex.org/W2092710223,"Acetylcholine-evoked secretion from the parotid gland is substantially potentiated by cAMP-raising agonists. A potential locus for the action of cAMP is the intracellular signaling pathway resulting in elevated cytosolic calcium levels ([Ca2+]i). This hypothesis was tested in mouse parotid acinar cells. Forskolin dramatically potentiated the carbachol-evoked increase in [Ca2+]i, converted oscillatory [Ca2+]i changes into a sustained [Ca2+]i increase, and caused subthreshold concentrations of carbachol to increase [Ca2+]i measurably. This potentiation was found to be independent of Ca2+ entry and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) production, suggesting that cAMP-mediated effects on Ca2+ release was the major underlying mechanism. Consistent with this hypothesis, dibutyryl cAMP dramatically potentiated InsP3-evoked Ca2+release from streptolysin-O-permeabilized cells. Furthermore, type II InsP3 receptors (InsP3R) were shown to be directly phosphorylated by a protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated mechanism after treatment with forskolin. In contrast, no evidence was obtained to support direct PKA-mediated activation of ryanodine receptors (RyRs). However, inhibition of RyRs in intact cells, demonstrated a role for RyRs in propagating Ca2+ oscillations and amplifying potentiated Ca2+ release from InsP3Rs. These data indicate that potentiation of Ca2+ release is primarily the result of PKA-mediated phosphorylation of InsP3Rs, and may largely explain the synergistic relationship between cAMP-raising agonists and acetylcholine-evoked secretion in the parotid. In addition, this report supports the emerging consensus that phosphorylation at the level of the Ca2+ release machinery is a broadly important mechanism by which cells can regulate Ca2+-mediated processes.

The spatio-temporal “shaping” of Ca2+ signals is thought to play an important role in defining the specificity of stimulus-response coupling both between cell types and within the same cell (4Putney J.W.J. Science. 1998; 279: 191-192Google Scholar, 5Berridge M.J. Nature. 1997; 386: 759-760Google Scholar). However, despite intensive investigation, the molecular mechanisms that control frequency- and/or amplitude-encoded Ca2+ oscillations, Ca2+ wave propagation, or localized Ca2+ release events remain poorly understood. An emerging body of evidence indicates that, in various systems, specific control over Ca2+ signals may be achieved by cross-talk between second messenger systems that raise [Ca2+]i 1interacting with those that elevate cAMP. Such cross-talk may alter the sensitivity of a variety of Ca2+ transport processes (6Putney J.W.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1986; 48: 75-88Google Scholar,7Bugrim A.E. Cell Calcium. 1999; 25: 219-226Google Scholar). An example of this cross-talk occurs in the salivary gland, where both fluid and exocytotic secretion are controlled by separate neuronal and/or humoral inputs (6Putney J.W.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1986; 48: 75-88Google Scholar, 8Baum B.J. Sreenby L.M. The Salivary System. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1987: 123-134Google Scholar). Specifically, neuronally released acetylcholine (ACh) activates acinar cell muscarinic receptors, leading to increased [Ca2+]i via the phosphoinositide pathway. Elevations in [Ca2+]i activate ion channels essential for unidirectional fluid secretion (9Petersen O.H. Gallacher D.V. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1988; 50: 65-80Google Scholar), and, in addition, exert regulatory control over the exocytotic machinery required for protein secretion (6Putney J.W.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1986; 48: 75-88Google Scholar). Muscarinic activation of both fluid secretion, and to a lesser extent exocytosis, has been shown to be dramatically potentiated by the concomitant activation of cAMP-raising pathways, such as by co-released vasoactive intestinal peptide, or by sympathetic stimulation of β-adrenoreceptors (10Larsson O. Olgart L. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1989; 137: 231-236Google Scholar, 11Bobyock E. Chernick W.S. J. Dent. Res. 1989; 68: 1489-1494Google Scholar, 12Baldys-Waligorska A. Pour A. Moriarty C.M. Dowd F.

Although cAMP could have direct effects on ion channels (14Kraus-Friedmann N. Cell Calcium. 2000; 27: 127-138Google Scholar) and/or exocytotic proteins (15Fujita-Yoshigaki J. Cell Signal. 1998; 10: 371-375Google Scholar), an alternative hypothesis is that cAMP interacts directly with the Ca2+ signaling machinery to account for the synergistic effects (6Putney J.W.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1986; 48: 75-88Google Scholar, 13Yoshimura K. Hiramatsu Y. Murakami M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1402: 171-187Google Scholar, 16McKinney J.S. Desole M.S. Rubin R.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: C651-C657Google Scholar). Because parotid acinar cells have been used extensively to study Ca2+ signaling, this model system is ideally suited to investigate cross-talk between cAMP and Ca2+ signaling. InsP3 production, Ca2+ influx, and Ca2+ release from either InsP3Rs or RyRs, are all potential targets for cAMP in modulating Ca2+signaling, however, the literature is equivocal as to the site of any interaction (16McKinney J.S.

No single study has been successful in unambiguously identifying a specific molecular target that accounts for the synergistic relationship between cAMP and Ca2+ signaling in parotid acinar cells. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the molecular target(s) for the interaction between cAMP and Ca2+ signaling in mouse parotid acinar cells. This was achieved using a combination of imaging (intact and SL-O-permeabilized cells), inositol phosphate assays and in situphosphorylation experiments. These experimental paradigms revealed that cAMP dramatically potentiated Ca2+ release through PKA-mediated phosphorylation of InsP3 receptors, likely the type II isoform. This regulatory control likely underlies the synergistic relationship between ACh and cAMP-elevating agonists in parotid acinar cells. These findings have broad implications and may represent a general feature for the regulation of Ca2+release events that are linked to a vast array of specific functions in all cell types. Single and small groups of parotid acinar cells were isolated by collagenase digestion of freshly dissected parotid glands from wild type Swiss Black mice using a technique similar to that described previously for rat parotid (24Evans R.L. Bell S.M. Schultheis P.J. Shull G.E. Melvin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29025-29030Google Scholar). Briefly, 25-g mice were killed by cardiac puncture immediately following CO2 gas asphyxiation. Parotid glands were dissected, minced, and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C in Earle's minimum essential medium (Biofluids, Inc., Rockville, MD) containing 2 mm glutamine, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.04 mg/ml collagenase P (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany). Minced tissue was dispersed by multiple trituration every 20 min. Cells were resuspended in bovine serum albumin-free Eagle's basal medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2 mm glutamine and penicillin/streptomycin and left on ice until ready for use. Isolated parotid acinar cells were resuspended in a HEPES-buffered physiological saline solution (HEPES-PSS) containing (in mm) 5.5 glucose, 137 NaCl, 0.56 MgCl2, 4.7 KCl, 1 Na2HPO4, 10 HEPES (pH 7.4), 1.2 CaCl2. The cells were then incubated in the above HEPES-PSS containing 2 μm fura-2/AM for 30 min at room temperature, after which they were washed once and resuspended in the above HEPES-PSS and kept on ice. Cells were allowed to adhere to a glass coverslip that formed the base of a gravity-fed perfusion chamber and continually perfused with HEPES-PSS. [Ca2+] imaging was performed using an inverted epifluorescence Nikon microscope with a 40× oil immersion objective lens (numerical aperture, 1.3). A field of 3–15 fura-2-loaded cells was excited alternately with light at 340 and 380 nm (± 10 nm bandpass filters, Chroma) using an illumination system (Sutter, DG-4). Fluorescence images (500 ± 45 nm) were captured and digitized at 12-bit resolution using an interline progressive scan CCD camera (Sensicam). Axon Imaging Workbench was used to drive the DG-4 and image acquisition by the camera. Images were acquired every second with an exposure of 200 ms. Background-subtracted and 340/380 ratio images were calculated on-line and stored immediately to hard disk. Images (480 × 640 pixels) were collected with no binning, thereby giving a spatial resolution of 0.225 μm/pixel. All experiments were performed at room temperature. Isolated parotid acinar cells were incubated in the above attachment media containing 10 μm fura-2FF/AM (KD for Ca2+ ∼13 μm; see Ref. 25Hyrc K.L. Bownik J.M. Goldberg M.P. Cell Calcium. 2000; 27: 75-86Google Scholar) for 60 min at 37 °C. Permeabilization and subsequent Ca2+ uptake and Ca2+ release experiments were similar to those reported in pancreatic acinar cells (26van de Put F.H. Elliott A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4999-5006Google Scholar, 27van de Put F.H. Elliott A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27764-27770Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were constantly perfused with a Chelex-100 “scrubbed” cytosol-like medium containing (in mm) 135 KCl, 1.2 KH2PO4, 0.5 EGTA, 0.5 HEDTA, 0.5 nitriloacetic acid, and 20 HEPES/KOH (pH 7.1). MgCl2, CaCl2, and MgATP were added accordingly to give a constant free Mg2+, Ca2+, and ATP concentration of 0.9 mm, 200 nm, and 1 mm, respectively (as calculated by WEBMAXC version 2.1). Permeabilization was achieved by perfusion with an ATP-containing (but Ca2+-free) cytosol-like medium containing 0.4 IU of streptolysin-O (SL-O). Permeabilization was monitored and verified using the imaging system by exciting loaded cells with light at 360 nm, which is the isosbestic point for fura-2FF (360 ± 25 nm bandpass filter, Chroma). Images were acquired every 10 s (100-ms exposure) and the fluorescence in each cell monitored over time. The emitted fluorescence declined rapidly within 10 min as the plasma membrane permeabilized and all the cytosolic dye leaked out of the cell. The resultant fluorescence (<20% of pre-permeabilized cells) was caused by dye trapped in intracellular organelles. The cells were subsequently perfused with the cytosol-like medium devoid of SL-O, Ca2+, or ATP for 10 min. Measurement of [Ca2+]ER was achieved by exciting permeabilized cells with light at 340 and 380 nm as with fura-2, except images were acquired every 10 s with an exposure of 300 ms. This was done to prevent photobleaching of the dye because emitted fluorescence was significantly lower than when the dye was trapped in the cytosol. Rapid Ca2+ uptake was achieved upon addition of 1 mm Mg-ATP and 0.2 μmCa2+, reaching a steady state within 3 min. Upon loading the stores with Ca2+, permeabilized cells were stimulated with various concentrations of InsP3 in the absence or presence of 100 μm dibutyryl cyclic AMP (Bt2cAMP), 10 μm Rp-cAMPS, and/or 500 μm ryanodine. Ca2+ release was measured as a decrease in the fura-2FF 340/380 ratio. Total inositol phosphate production in response to forskolin and/or carbachol (CCh) was determined by a similar method to that described previously (28Shuttleworth T.J. Thompson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32636-32643Google Scholar). Briefly, isolated parotid acinar cells were incubated with 5 μCi/mlmyo-[3H]inositol for 2 h, followed by three washes in HEPES-PSS. Cells were then incubated with 1 μm CCh and/or 10 μm forskolin for 5 min in the presence of 10 mm lithium. Totalmyo-[3H]inositol phosphates from each sample were extracted by solubilization with 0.5 m trichloroacetic acid, eluted on Dowex columns and detected by liquid scintillation. Total inositol phosphate generation was expressed as a percentage of total phosphoinositides, determined by counting the trichloroacetic acid-insoluble fraction by liquid scintillation. Parotid acinar cells were isolated from 4 mice as described above and metabolically labeled by incubating for 2 h with 14 μCi/ml 32PO 4− (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in a phosphate-free saline solution containing (in mm) 109.7 NaCl, 4.5 KCl, 1.2 MgCl2, 5.95 HEPES (free acid), 7.05 NaHEPES (pH 7.4) 1.13 CaCl2 and 6 glucose. Following incubation, cells were washed three times in the above 32PO 4−-free media and aliquots treated with or without 10 μm forskolin for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were then rapidly pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer containing (in mm) 50 Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 250 NaCl, 5 EDTA, 100 NaF, 1 benzamidine, 1 dithiothreitol, 1% CHAPS, 10 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml antipain. Cell lysates were then sonicated, left on ice for 30 min, and vortexed every 5 min. InsP3R or RyR protein was immunoprecipitated from the samples by incubating lysates with a mixture of antibodies (∼1 μg of antibody/mg of protein) raised against all three InsP3R types or all three RyR types for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by incubation with 80 μl of protein A-agarose beads (Pierce) for an additional 1 h at 4 °C. Antibodies directed against InsP3R were CT1 and CT2 (kind gifts from Richard Wojcikiewicz, State University of New York, Syracuse, NY) and type III antibody (Transduction Laboratories). Antibodies directed against RyR were 34C directed against RyR1 (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, IA), C3–33 directed against RyR2 (Affinity Bioreagents, Inc.), and anti-rabbit skeletal muscle RyR antibody directed against RyR3 (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). As a secondary control, aliquots of cell lysate from cells treated with forskolin were incubated with beads without any antibodies. Following incubation, the beads-protein complexes were washed five times in lysis buffer by repeated centrifugation and resuspension and then boiled in SDS-sample buffer (Laemmli). Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel (5%) electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), after which the gels were vacuum-dried (Bio-Rad) and exposed to a PhosphorImager intensifier screen. Bands of the appropriate molecular weight, which corresponded to phosphorylated proteins that had incorporated 32PO 4−, were detected using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. To determine whether phosphorylation of InsP3Rs was mediated by PKA, H-89 and Rp-cAMPS were used to inhibit PKA in combination with an additional and complimentary approach using a phospho-PKA substrate antibody (Cell Signaling Technology). This antibody specifically recognizes proteins containing phosphorylated serine or threonine, with an arginine residue at position −3, but not the corresponding nonphosphorylated motif (29Montminy M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 807-822Google Scholar, 30Pearson R.B. Kemp B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 62-81Google Scholar). Although this antibody would not discriminate between substrates of PKA, protein kinase C, or cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase, the combined use of forskolin and appropriate PKA inhibitors was used to implicate a specific role of PKA. Aliquots of isolated parotid acinar cells were treated with or without 10 μm forskolin, 50 nm okadaic acid, and/or the PKA inhibitors, H-89 (2 μm) and Rp-cAMPS (30 μm) for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were then solubilized in lysis buffer similar to the method above. Lysates were then incubated with phospho-PKA substrate antibody (1:100 dilution) to immunoprecipitate phosphorylated proteins. Specific detection of phosphorylated type II InsP3Rs was achieved by Western blotting with the CT2 antibody. Whole cell lysates or immunoprecipitated proteins were denatured in SDS-sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell) prior to immunoblotting with the CT2 antibody. Immunoreactivity was visualized using peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad), followed by detection by Super Signal detection system (Pierce) exposed on XAR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). In all experiments (unless otherwise stated in the text), a paired experimental design was applied, whereby a particular experimental paradigm was repeated in the absence or presence of a test reagent(s) on the same cell. Therefore, statistical significance was determined, where appropriate, using a paired t test, Wilcoxon test for pairs, or one samplet test. Occasionally, statistical significance was determined between groups of experiments where an unpaired ttest or Mann-Whitney test was used. For any parameter analyzed from several cells in a particular experiment, an average value was determined. These values were in turn averaged to give the values expressed in the text as means ± S.E. To investigate the effects of elevated cAMP levels on [Ca2+]i signaling in parotid acinar cells, we first characterized the types of [Ca2+]i responses evoked by the muscarinic receptor agonist, CCh. Low concentrations of CCh (10–300 nm) caused an oscillatory increase in [Ca2+]i in 86% of cells tested, which was characterized by a large initial spike followed by rapid sinusoidal oscillations superimposed over an elevated base line. These oscillations were complex in nature, and their frequency and amplitude varied markedly between cells. Higher concentrations of CCh (300 nm to 10 μm) induced a biphasic increase in [Ca2+]i, which was characterized by a large initial spike followed by a sustained elevation. These patterns of [Ca2+]i changes are typical of a variety of exocrine cells; however, the oscillation frequency was significantly higher than reported in pancreatic acinar cells (7–11/min in parotid compared with 4–6/min; see Ref. 31Yule D.I. Lawrie A.M. Gallacher D.V. Cell Calcium. 1991; 12: 145-151Google Scholar). Despite the complex nature of these CCh-evoked [Ca2+]i changes, there was a consistent concentration-dependent increase in the magnitude of the initial spike-like increase in [Ca2+]i. This initial [Ca2+]i spike was interpreted to reflect Ca2+ release from intracellular stores and was quantitatively compared in the absence and presence of 10 μm forskolin using a paired experimental design. Using the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin, we investigated the effects of elevating intracellular cAMP levels on CCh-evoked [Ca2+]i signaling (33Seamon K.B. Padgett W. Daly J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3363-3367Google Scholar). Repeated stimulations with CCh evoked [Ca2+]i changes of equal magnitude (Fig. 1). Forskolin (10 μm) induced a dramatic and time-dependent potentiation of this CCh-evoked initial increase in [Ca2+]i. Upon removal of forskolin, there was an equivalent time-dependent recovery (Fig. 1). On average, forskolin increased the CCh-evoked [Ca2+]i response by 148.9 ± 8.5% after 3–5 min, which increased further to 177.1 ± 17.4% after 8–10 min of incubation with forskolin (see Fig. 1). To test whether the potentiation was the result of specific activation of PKA, cells were also pretreated with 2 μm H-89, an inhibitor of serine/threonine kinases such as PKA (34Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Google Scholar) prior to specific activation of PKA by treatment with forskolin. This completely prevented the potentiation of the CCh-evoked initial increase in [Ca2+]i (Fig.2), suggesting that the potentiation was caused by activation of PKA.Figure 2A PKA inhibitor prevents the potentiation of the CCh-evoked [Ca2+]i response by forskolin. Using a similar experimental paradigm as Fig. 1, cells were pretreated with 2 μm H-89 for 5 min prior to treatment with 10 μm forskolin in combination with 2 μm H-89 for at least 5 min. A, representative trace from 6 separate experiments (24 cells). B, quantification of mean data revealed that the PKA inhibitor, H-89 completely prevented the potentiation by forskolin. Statistical significance was determined using a paired one sample t test (*p < 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In addition to the potentiation of the CCh-evoked initial increase in [Ca2+]i, forskolin also converted oscillatory [Ca2+]i changes into a sustained increase, suggesting a leftward shift in the CCh concentration-response curve compared with control cells (Fig.3A). Consistent with this hypothesis, forskolin treatment enabled normally subthreshold concentrations of CCh (3–30 nm) to evoke oscillatory [Ca2+]i responses (49 of 75 cells). Interestingly, in six of these cells, [Ca2+]i oscillations were confined to the apical region of the cells (Fig. 3B), revealing conversion of a subthreshold response into a measurable threshold response. To identify the molecular site at which this potentiation was manifested, we systematically investigated the effects of forskolin on Ca2+ entry, InsP3 production, and Ca2+ release channels in parotid acinar cells using a variety of biochemical and functional assays. A potential locus for the effects of cAMP on Ca2+ signals is the Ca2+ entry pathways. Stimulation of parotid acinar cells with low concentrations of CCh (100 nm) in Ca2+-free solution (nominal Ca2+) evoked [Ca2+]i oscillations. These oscillations progressively decreased in amplitude (Fig.4A), presumably in response to depletion of intracellular stores. Re-introduction of external Ca2+ in the continued presence of CCh produced a large increase in base-line [Ca2+]i with oscillations of increasing amplitude superimposed (Fig. 4A). The elevated base-line [Ca2+]i was interpreted to reflect capacitative Ca2+ entry. Repeating this paradigm in the presence of 10 μm forskolin caused a 169.3 ± 6.5% potentiation of the initial CCh-evoked [Ca2+]i increase, which was not significantly different from that observed in the presence of external Ca2+ (177.1 ± 17.4%; Fig. 4B) This suggests that enhanced Ca2+ release, rather than Ca2+ entry, was responsible for potentiation of the initial CCh-evoked [Ca2+]i increase. Re-introduction of external Ca2+ in the presence of forskolin produced a potentiation of the elevated base-line [Ca2+]i (Fig. 4, A andB; 122.1 ± 11.3% higher than control), suggesting an effect on capacitative Ca2+ entry. This most likely reflected an indirect effect, resulting from the enhanced Ca2+ release and store depletion, on Ca2+entry. However, additional direct effects of cAMP on Ca2+entry cannot be completely excluded. Activation of muscarinic receptors leads to the generation of InsP3 through G-protein-coupled activation of phospholipase C (PLC). Thus, the effects of forskolin could conceivably be caused by an interaction of cAMP with this receptor-signaling complex leading to an enhancement of InsP3 generation. To test this idea we examined the effects of forskolin on inositol phosphate production by measuring [3H]inositol incorporation to assess PLC activity and thus InsP3production. CCh (1 μm) significantly increased inositol phosphates from 5.9 ± 0.2 to 9.8 ± 0.1% of total phosphoinositides (Fig. 5). In contrast, forskolin (10 μm) had no effect on either basal (6.1 ± 0.1%) or CCh-evoked (8.9 ± 0.3%) inositol phosphate turnover (Fig. 5). This indicated that increased cAMP does not directly stimulate the production of inositol phosphates and suggests a likely site of action is the Ca2+ release process itself. In nonexcitable cells, InsP3Rs are generally thought to be the trigger for Ca2+ release, whereas RyRs may have a role in propagating further release by Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) (35Straub S.V. Giovannucci D.R. Yule D.I. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 547-560Google Scholar). We pharmacologically separated these two Ca2+release pathways by inhibiting RyRs with 500 μm ryanodine (36Zucchi R. Ronca-Testoni S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1997; 49: 1-51Google Scholar). Ryanodine alone failed to significantly affect the initial increase in [Ca2+]i evoked by CCh (101.5 ± 7.3%; Fig. 6,A and C), suggesting that this event does not involve RyRs. However, when applied during a train of Ca2+oscillations, ryanodine dramatically dampened the oscillatory [Ca2+]i response (Fig. 6,A and B). These data therefore imply that RyRs may be important for propagating and maintaining Ca2+oscillations in parotid acinar cells as is the case in pancreatic acinar cells (32Lee M.-G. Xu X. Zeng W. Diaz J. Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Kuo T.H. Wuytack R. Racymaekers L. Muallem M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15765-15770Google Scholar). When applied in combination with 10 μm forskolin, ryanodine significantly reduced the potentiation of the CCh-evoked [Ca2+]i response from 177.1 ± 17.4% to 125.2 ± 2.8% of that observed in the absence of forskolin and ryanodine (Fig. 6, B and C). Nevertheless, the residual potentiation (125.2 ± 2.8%) remained significantly different from control. One possible interpretation of these data is that the potentiation of Ca2+ release by forskolin is caused by a direct effect of PKA on both RyRs and InsP3Rs. To address whether the potentiation by forskolin was caused by a direct effect of PKA on RyRs, we attempted to selectively activate RyRs. Caffeine (20 mm,n = 5 experiments, 22 cells) or low concentrations of ryanodine (0.01–10 μm, n = 8 experiments, 49 cells) consistently failed to affect resting [Ca2+]i either in the absence or presence of forskolin (Fig. 7,A and B). In addition, 10 μmforskolin failed to affect resting [Ca2+]i in any cell tested either in the presence or absence of ryanodine (data not shown). Because the effects of ryanodine are use-dependent (see Ref. 36Zucchi R. Ronca-Testoni S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1997; 49: 1-51Google Scholar, and references therein), two separate approaches were utilized to facilitate activation of RyRs. First, 10 μm ryanodine was added during a train of CCh-evoked [Ca2+]i oscillations (see Fig.7C) and continually applied after CCh was removed (similarly to Ref. 37Verma V. Carter C. Keable S. Bennett D. Thorn P. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 449-454Google Scholar). The second approach was to increase external [Ca2+] to 10 mm in an attempt to progressively elevate resting [Ca2+]i, thereby increasing the sensitivity of RyRs to ryanodine (see Fig. 7D). However, ryanodine, either alone or in combination with forskolin, failed to affect resting [Ca2+]i in any cell tested (see Fig. 7, C (three separate experiments, 15 cells) and D (four separate experiments, 29 cells). In contrast to conventional activators, such as caffeine or ryanodine, 4-chloro-m-cresol (CmC), a compound well documented to specifically activate RyRs (38Zorzato F. Scutari E. Tegazzin V.

Here we show that in cultured adipocytes insulin causes acute cortical localization of the actin-regulatory neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP) and actin-related protein-3 (Arp3) as well as cortical F-actin polymerization by a mechanism that is insensitive to the PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin. Expression of the dominant inhibitory N-WASP-ΔWA protein lacking the Arp and actin binding regions attenuates the cortical F-actin rearrangements by insulin in these cells. Remarkably, the N-WASP-ΔWA protein also inhibits insulin action on GLUT4 translocation, indicating dependence of GLUT4 recycling on N-WASP-directed cortical F-actin assembly. TC10 exhibits sequence similarity to Cdc42 and has been reported to bind N-WASP. We show the inhibitory TC10 (T31N) mutant, which abrogates insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation and glucose transport, also inhibits both cortical localization of N-WASP and F-actin formation in response to insulin. These findings reveal that N-WASP likely functions downstream of TC10 in a PI 3-kinase-independent insulin signaling pathway to mobilize cortical F-actin, which in turn promotes GLUT4 responsiveness to insulin."

These proteins, consisting of histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 come together to form the nucleosome when combined with 146 base pairs of DNA (2Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F.

The amino-terminal tails of histones radiate from the nucleosome core, whereas the remaining globular portions of the histones are responsible for creating the histone-histone contacts within the core (2Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6991) Google Scholar, 3White C.L. Suto R.K. Luger K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5207-5218Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The positively charged amino-terminal tails contain several known sites for posttranslational modification. These include acetylation, phosphorylation, and methylation (reviewed in Ref.4Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6679) Google Scholar). Specific modifications are associated with certain DNA template-mediated processes, such as transcription and DNA repair (4Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6679) Google Scholar). The deposition of a tetramer consisting of histones H3 and H4 onto DNA constitutes the first step of nucleosome assembly followed by the addition of a pair of H2A and H2B heterodimers to form the histone octamer (reviewed in Ref. 5Ito T.

Site-specific evolutionary conserved acetylation of the H3 and H4 amino-terminal tails occurs in the cytoplasm, suggesting a role in either deposition or nuclear transport (reviewed in Ref. 6Verreault A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1430-1438PubMed Google Scholar). The histone acetyltransferase B complex, which in yeast resides partially in the cytoplasm, is responsible for cytoplasmic H4 acetylation (7Parthun M.R. Widom J. Gottschling D.E.

The import of histones into the nucleus must take place in a rapid cell cycle-regulated manner to efficiently accommodate newly replicated DNA. Although potentially small enough to diffuse into the nucleus, it is unlikely that diffusion would allow the necessary nuclear accumulation of a large amount of histone in a relatively short span of time. The nuclear import of all proteins is believed to be mediated by a family of receptors called karyopherins (Kaps)1 or importins (reviewed in Refs. 9Nakielny S. Dreyfuss G.

Kaps can associate directly with their import cargoes, although examples where adapter proteins are involved have been demonstrated (9Nakielny S. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1999; 99: 677-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Kaps can also associate with components of the nuclear pore complex, a large macromolecular structure that spans the nuclear envelope and links the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm (reviewed in Refs. 9Nakielny S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 22857-22860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Transport is believed to occur by multiple transient low-affinity interactions between the Kap and the nuclear pore complex, which ultimately leads to translocation of the Kap-cargo complex through the nuclear pore complex (9Nakielny S.

Once in the nucleus, import Kaps bind RanGTP, which results in the dissociation of Kaps from their cargoes and leads to the termination of the import cycle (12Moore M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22857-22860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 13Rexach M. Blobel G.

The specific nuclear localization signals (NLSs) recognized by each Kap within their cognate cargoes are mostly undefined, primarily because only one or two cargoes have been determined for each Kap (9Nakielny S.

In addition, some cargoes can be imported by a number of different Kaps, suggesting some overlap between NLSs recognized by distinct Kaps (17Schlenstedt G. Smirnova E. Deane R. Solsbacher J. Kutay U.

Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated that histones H2A and H2B are imported primarily by Kap114p (21Mosammaparast N. Jackson K.R. Guo Y. Brame C.J. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Pemberton L.F. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), a Kap previously shown to be responsible for the import of the TATA-binding protein (20Pemberton L.F. Rosenblum J.S.

A. 1999; 96: 12542-12547Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). As Kap114p is encoded by a nonessential gene and the nuclear function of histones is clearly essential, other pathways of transport exist for H2A and H2B. At least three other Kaps are responsible for H2A/H2B import (21Mosammaparast N. Jackson K.R. Guo Y. Brame C.J. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Pemberton L.F. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). H3 and H4 are the first histones to be deposited onto DNA during the assembly of the nucleosome, and because of their central importance, we sought to determine which factor(s) mediate the import of H3 and H4. In this report, we demonstrate that the import of H3 and H4 is mediated primarily by Kap123p. Kap121p and potentially two other Kaps also serve as pathways of import for these two histones. Cytosolic H4 was found to be associated with Kap123p, Kap121p, and H3. Although presumed to be imported as a heteromer, both H3 and H4 contained NLSs in their amino-terminal domains, which can bind specifically and directly to Kap123p and Kap121p. These amino-terminal domains were found to be crucial for the nuclear accumulation of H3 and H4. The H3 and H4 NLS-GFP reporters were mislocalized to the cytosol in strains harboring mutations in the Kaps, which we identified biochemically. This suggests that several nuclear import pathways are responsible for the nuclear transport of the core histones. Yeast strains in this study were derived from DF5 and manipulated as described previously (23Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics.

The protein A-tagged histone H4 strain (H4-PrA) was constructed by integrative transformation of four and a half IgG binding domains ofStaphylococcus aureus PrA just upstream of the stop codon of the HHF1 allele (yeast H4 is encoded from two genes, HHF1 and HHF2, which encode identical proteins). The Kap123-PrA strain has been described previously (18Rout M.P. Blobel G. Aitchison J.D.

GFP reporter constructs were based on pGFP2-C-FUS as described previously (21Mosammaparast N. Jackson K.R. Guo Y. Brame C.J. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Pemberton L.F. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). H3 and H4 reporter constructs were made by cloning the relevant sequences by PCR into pGFP2-C-FUS. The NLS domains of H3 (residues 1–28) and H4 (residues 1–42) were expressed as fusions to GST at the amino terminus and two tandem IgG binding motifs of PrA (ZZ tag) at the COOH terminus in pGEX-ZZ (a gift from Michael Nemergut and Ian Macara, University of Virginia). For overexpression of Kap123p in yeast, the KAP123 open reading frame was cloned into p425-GAL1. For purification of recombinant Kap123p, theKAP123 open reading frame was expressed as a fusion to maltose-binding protein (MBP) in pMAL-c2X (New England Biolabs). For purification of recombinant Kap121p, the KAP121 open reading frame was expressed as a fusion to GST in pGEX-4T1. Postnuclear postribosomal cytosol was prepared from one liter of the H4-PrA and Kap123-PrA strains as described previously (28Aitchison J.D. Blobel G. Rout M.P. Science. 1996; 274: 624-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Kap123-PrA and H4-PrA and their associated proteins were isolated by incubation of the cytosol with rabbit IgG-Sepharose as described previously (28Aitchison J.D. Blobel G. Rout M.P.

Bound material was washed extensively in transport buffer (21Mosammaparast N. Jackson K.R. Guo Y. Brame C.J. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Pemberton L.F. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and proteins were eluted from the IgG-Sepharose with a MgCl2 step gradient, precipitated in methanol, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Bands identified by Coomassie Blue staining were excised and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) as described previously (30Gharahdaghi F. Kirchner M. Fernandez J. Mische S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 233: 94-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Western blotting was performed by transferring the proteins onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and probing with antibodies as noted. The anti-Kap123p antibody was a kind gift from John Aitchison (Institute for Systems Biology, Seattle, WA) (18Rout M.P. Blobel G. Aitchison J.D. Cell. 1997; 89: 715-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The anti-Ac-H3 and anti-Ac-H4 (Penta) antibodies were kind gifts from C. David Allis (University of Virginia). The binding of antibody was visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and ECL (Amersham Biosciences, Inc). For analysis of the entire interacting fraction, IgG-Sepharose and associated proteins were washed extensively in transport buffer and 50 mm MgCl2. Proteins were then eluted with 1 m MgCl2 and precipitated with methanol. An aliquot of the sample was digested with modified trypsin (Promega) at room temperature for approximately 18 h and then stored frozen at −35 °C. An aliquot of the digested sample was acidified and analyzed by nano-HPLC microelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry. All spectra were recorded on an LCQ ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Finnigan). Nano-HPLC columns were constructed briefly from 360 × 75 μm fused silica and packed with 7-cm C18 beads (YMC ODS-AQ, Waters). The HPLC gradient was 0–60% solvent B in 70 min, 60–100% solvent B in 15 min. Solvents A and B were 0.1m acetic acid in water and 0.1 m acetic acid in 70% acetonitrile, respectively. Spectra were acquired with the instrument operating in the data-dependent mode throughout the HPLC gradient. Every 12–15 s, the instrument cycled through the acquisition of a full scan mass spectrum, and 5 MS/MS spectra recorded sequentially on the five most abundant ions present in the initial MS scan. MS/MS spectra were searched against Saccharomyces cerevisiae data base using SEQUEST (31Eng J. McCormack A.L. Yates J.R. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1994; 5: 976-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (5472) Google Scholar, 32Yates J.R.D. Eng J.K. McCormack A.L. Schieltz D. Anal. Chem. 1995; 67: 1426-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar). Peptides with cross correlation scores >2 were manually confirmed. Peptides were synthesized by the solid phase method using standard fmoc chemistry, purified by reverse phase HPLC, and analyzed by mass spectrometry to confirm their purity and sequence. Strains containing the reporter constructs based on pGFP2-C-FUS were grown and induced as described previously (21Mosammaparast N. Jackson K.R. Guo Y. Brame C.J. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Pemberton L.F. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). All microscopy and image manipulation were performed as described previously (21Mosammaparast N. Jackson K.R. Guo Y. Brame C.J. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Pemberton L.F. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) with a Nikon Microphot-SA microscope and OpenLab software using a ×60 (in figures) or ×100 (for quantitation) objective. Quantitation of nuclear to cytoplasmic (N:C) fluorescence intensity ratios were determined as described previously (21Mosammaparast N. Jackson K.R. Guo Y. Brame C.J. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Pemberton L.F. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). For each figure, images were taken at the same exposure settings and manipulated identically using Adobe Photoshop, with the exception of H3 and H4 COOH-terminal GFP reporters (H3-(58–136), H3-(83–138), H4-(42–103), H4-(81–103)), which were taken at higher exposure times and manipulated separately. MBP-tagged Kap123p and GST-tagged Kap121p were purified by overexpression in Escherichia coli and purified on amylose-agarose or glutathione-Sepharose resin, respectively, according to the instructions by the manufacturer (New England Biolabs) for MBP-Kap123p or as previously described for GST-Kap121p (21Mosammaparast N. Jackson K.R. Guo Y. Brame C.J. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Pemberton L.F. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The GST tag was cleaved from purified Kap121p with thrombin. The H3 and H4 NLSs were expressed as GST-NLS-ZZ fusions, purified on glutathione-Sepharose, and cleaved with thrombin while bound, releasing the NLS-ZZ fusion protein. For each binding reaction, ∼5 μg of NLS-ZZ fusion protein was incubated with 2.5 μg of MBP-Kap123p or 2.5 μg of Kap121p and 20 μl of rabbit IgG-Sepharose at 4 °C for 1 h. The IgG-Sepharose was preblocked with 10% bovine serum albumin in transport buffer. The Sepharose was then washed extensively with transport buffer and boiled in SDS sample buffer, and bound material was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. To identify the import receptor for histone H4, H4 and its interacting partners were isolated from cytosol. A haploid yeast strain was constructed where one copy of H4 (HHF1) was COOH-terminally tagged with PrA and used to prepare postribosomal cytosol. To isolate H4-PrA and associated proteins, this extract was incubated with IgG-Sepharose, and isolated proteins were eluted with a MgCl2 step gradient and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining (Fig.1a). H4-PrA was eluted at the highest MgCl2 concentration (4.5 m) as expected, and a number of distinct bands, presumably H4-associated proteins, were eluted at lower concentrations of MgCl2. The amount of H4-PrA recovered was less than expected and was probably because of insolubility after MgCl2 elution, as with H2A and H2B (21Mosammaparast N. Jackson K.R. Guo Y. Brame C.J. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Pemberton L.F. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). A band that corresponded to a size expected of a karyopherin (∼116 kDa) eluted in the 100–1000 mmMgCl2 fractions. Initial characterization of the excised band found in the 250 mm fraction was carried out by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, which revealed that it contained Kap123p, suggesting that H4 and Kap123p specifically interact in cytosol. This result was confirmed by Western blotting a parallel set of H4-PrA-associated fractions (0–1000 mm MgCl2) with an antibody to Kap123p (Fig. 1a). The interaction of Kap123p and H4 suggested that Kap123p may be the primary import receptor for H4. The fact that the KAP123 gene is nonessential suggested that other pathways of import must exist for H4. To determine whether other Kaps besides Kap123p were present in the ∼116-kDa bands in the 100–1000 mm MgCl2 fractions, an analysis of these bands was carried out using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. Using this more sensitive technique, numerous peptides for Kap123p were found for the ∼116-kDa bands (from elutions with 100 mm, 250 mm, and 1 mMgCl2), confirming the MALDI-TOF MS data. Additionally, a number of peptides corresponding to Kap121p was found in each of the same bands. This suggested that Kap121p may serve as an additional import pathway for H4. Peptides corresponding to Nmd5p/Kap119p were also found in the 1 m MgCl2 fraction, suggesting that this Kap may serve as a minor import receptor for H4. The above MS analysis was limited to the visible gel bands migrating at ∼116 kDa in the 100–1000 mm MgCl2 fractions. However, a number of other Kap proteins have significantly lower or higher molecular weights, which may have been missed by this type of selective analysis. To determine the H4-PrA-interacting proteins more comprehensively, two parallel experiments were carried out using cytosol from this strain. After washing the cytosolic H4-PrA-associated proteins with 50 mm MgCl2, all associated proteins were eluted with 1 m MgCl2 and precipitated. In the first experiment, this fraction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the gel region corresponding to 90–150 kDa (which includes all the yeast β-Kaps) was analyzed by liquid chromatography/tandem MS as described above. In the second experiment, the entire precipitated fraction was analyzed by liquid chromatography/tandem MS. From both experiments, numerous peptides corresponding to Kap123p and Kap121p were found. In addition, a single peptide corresponding to Sxm1p/Kap108p was found in the MS analysis of the 90–150-kDa region. The consistent presence of Kap123p and Kap121p in all of these fractions strongly suggested that these two Kaps constitute the major pathway of import for histone H4. In addition, the isolation of peptides (albeit relatively few) from Nmd5p/Kap119p and Sxm1p/Kap108p suggested that several other Kaps may play a minor role in H4 import. To determine the relative roles of Kap123p and Kap121p in the import of H4, the relative abundance of these two proteins was determined by summing the ion current observed for 10 tryptic peptides from each protein. Data acquired during the liquid chromatography/tandem MS experiment on sample eluted in the 1 m MgCl2fraction indicated that the ratio of Kap123p to Kap121p in the complex was 20:1. Thus, although both import pathways appear to be used by H4, the Kap123p-mediated pathway appears to be strongly preferred. A number of other distinct bands was present in the H4-PrA-interacting fractions. Two bands, which co-eluted at 250–1000 mmMgCl2 and migrated at ∼45 and 50 kDa, were excised and analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. This analysis revealed that these bands corresponded to Hat1p (lower band) and Hat2p (upper band). Peptides corresponding to these two proteins were also found when analyzing the entire 1 m MgCl2H4-PrA-interacting fraction with liquid chromatography/tandem MS. These two proteins had been previously identified as a cytosolic H4-associated acetyltransferase complex (7Parthun M.R. Widom J. Gottschling D.E. Cell. 1996; 87: 85-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). This finding suggested that cytosolic Hat1p·Hat2p existed in a complex with H4, however, it is possible that this complex may be distinct from the H4·Kap123p complex. To determine whether H3 was present in the H4-PrA-associated fractions, a parallel set of H4-PrA associated fractions was blotted with an antibody that recognizes acetylated H3. This showed that H3 is indeed associated with cytosolic H4 (Fig. 1a) and suggested that H3 and H4 may be co-imported by Kap123p. H3 was also found to be present when analyzing the entire 1 m MgCl2H4-PrA-interacting fraction with liquid chromatography/tandem MS, corroborating its presence by Western analysis. To confirm that H3 and H4 are indeed cargoes for Kap123p, cytosol from a Kap123-PrA strain was isolated and incubated with IgG-Sepharose, and associated proteins were eluted with MgCl2 as described above for the H4-PrA experiments. Initially, fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. However, because of the number of Kap123p-interacting proteins present, it was not possible to identify which bands represented H3 and H4. This was not surprising as Kap123p interacts with and imports at least 20 ribosomal proteins (18Rout M.P. Blobel G. Aitchison J.D. Cell. 1997; 89: 715-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Thus, Kap123-PrA-associated fractions were blotted and probed with antibodies that recognized acetylated H3 or acetylated H4 (Fig. 1b). Both H3 and H4 were present in the Kap123-PrA-associated fractions (Fig. 1b). H3 and H4 co-eluted primarily in the 250–1000 mm MgCl2fractions, consistent with the possibility that H3/H4 may interact with Kap123p as a complex. These data suggest that both H3 and H4 are cargoes for Kap123p. As available antibodies to H3 and H4 were specific for the acetylated forms of these histones, we were also able to determine from our Western blotting data that, as expected, some cytosolic H3 and H4 are acetylated. In addition, we showed that the Kap123-PrA-interacting fraction of histones included acetylated H3 and H4 (Fig. 1b). These data correlated with the finding that cytosolic H4-interacting proteins included the cytosolic acetyltransferase complex composed of Hat1p·Hat2p. We previously demonstrated that H2A and H2B each contain a NLS located at their amino termini, and that these sequences are sufficient for association with the Kaps responsible for their transport (21Mosammaparast N. Jackson K.R. Guo Y. Brame C.J. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Pemberton L.F. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Because of the overall similarity in histone structure, we hypothesized that histones H3 and H4 also contained NLSs in their amino termini. To test this hypothesis, amino acids 1–58 of H3 and 1–42 of H4 were expressed as fusions with two tandem copies of GFP (GFP2) in yeast. An analysis of the expression of both reporters demonstrated that these residues were sufficient to confer nuclear accumulation of GFP, whereas GFP alone was localized over the entire cell (Fig. 2, and data not shown). Smaller amino-terminal GFP fusions were constructed to determine the minimal NLS for each histone. For H3, the minimal region capable of conferring nuclear localization was residues 1–28 (Fig.2a). Further deletion from either the NH2 or COOH terminus (residues 1–20 or residues 13–28) abolished NLS function. For H4, the minimal NLS domain was mapped to residues 1–21 (Fig. 2b). The NLS function of the amino terminus of H4 was abolished when the first 11 residues of this domain were deleted (Fig.2b). The minimal NLS of H4 (residues 1–21) did not appear entirely nuclear, and more cytoplasmic signal was visible than had been detected with the H4-(1–42) GFP2 reporter. This finding suggests that residues 22–42 of H4 co"

We have recently reported that the paxillin LD1 motif acts as a binding interface for both the actin-binding protein actopaxin and the serine/threonine integrin-linked kinase (ILK). In this report we demonstrate the direct association between actopaxin and ILK and dissect the role of the respective interactions in their subcellular localization. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments were employed to map the binding sites on ILK and actopaxin. ILK binds to the CH2 domain of actopaxin. However, an actopaxin CH2 domain mutant defective for paxillin binding (paxillin binding subdomain mutant) retains the capacity to bind ILK, indicating that paxillin and ILK binding sites on actopaxin are distinct. Actopaxin binds to the C terminus of ILK. Despite the direct binding between actopaxin and ILK, mutation analysis confirmed a primary role for paxillin in their localization to focal adhesions. Interestingly, an ILK mutant (E359K) that was previously reported to act as dominant negative for ILK function was unable to bind actopaxin or paxillin and failed to localize to focal adhesions. This mutant also exhibited in vitro kinase activity comparable with wild-type ILK. Taken together, these data suggest that normal ILK signaling is dependent on efficient localization involving multiple protein interactions.

Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Google Scholar). Engagement of integrin molecules on the cell surface with the extracellular matrix is accompanied by the recruitment of numerous cytoskeletal and signaling proteins to the cytoplasmic face of these attachment sites, resulting in the formation of structures called focal adhesions. These protein complexes coordinate integrin-mediated signal transduction associated with cell motility, gene expression, and cell proliferation. Paxillin is a multidomain adapter protein localized to focal adhesions that functions as a molecular scaffold to facilitate signaling (5Turner C.E. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 955-959Google Scholar, 6Turner C.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E231-E236Google Scholar). The N terminus of paxillin contains five LD motifs that are highly conserved between species and between other paxillin family members (7Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Turner C.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1109-1123Google Scholar,8Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Turner C.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1803-1816Google Scholar). These leucine-rich repeats serve as binding sites for the cytoskeletal proteins actopaxin and vinculin (7Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Turner C.E. J.

Turner C.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1109-1123Google Scholar). The LD4 motif also links paxillin to the p21-activated kinase through the Arf GTPase-activating protein paxillin kinase linker and the Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor p21-activated kinase interacting exchange factor/cloned out of library (10Turner C.E. Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Riedy M.C. Nikolopoulos S.N. McDonald A.R. Bagrodia S. Thomas S. Leventhal P.S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 851-863Google Scholar). Recently we also demonstrated that the LD1 motif binds directly to the serine-threonine integrin-linked kinase (ILK) (11Nikolopoulos S.N. Turner C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23499-23505Google Scholar). Actopaxin localizes to focal adhesions and binds actin in addition to binding paxillin (9Nikolopoulos S.N. Turner C.E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1435-1448Google Scholar). We have previously shown that paxillin binding is necessary for actopaxin recruitment to focal adhesions (9Nikolopoulos S.N. Turner C.E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1435-1448Google Scholar). In addition, ectopic expression of a paxillin binding-defective actopaxin mutant (paxillin binding subdomain (PBS) mutant) in HeLa cells results in a substantial reduction in cell adhesion/spreading on collagen, suggesting an important role for actopaxin-paxillin interactions in integrin-dependent remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton (9Nikolopoulos S.N. Turner C.E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1435-1448Google Scholar). Actopaxin was also identified independently in a data base screen for actin-binding proteins and named parvin, defining a family of proteins with three members (α, β, and γ) (12Olski T.M. Noegel A.A. Korenbaum E. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 525-538Google Scholar).

Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 319-323Google Scholar), and myogenic differentiation (21Huang Y. Li J. Zhang Y. Wu C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 861-872Google Scholar). ILK contains a PBS in the C terminus region, and ILK PBS mutants fail to localize to focal adhesions, suggesting an important role for ILK-paxillin association in focal adhesion targeting of ILK and in the role of ILK in integrin-mediated signal transduction events (11Nikolopoulos S.N. Turner C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23499-23505Google Scholar). An interaction between ILK and two actopaxin family members (human actopaxin/α-parvin/CH-ILKBP and β-parvin/affixin) has recently been described (22Tu Y. Huang Y. Zhang Y. Hua Y. Wu C. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 585-598Google Scholar, 23Yamaji S. Suzuki A. Sugiyama Y. Koide Y. Yoshida M. Kanamori H. Mohri H. Ohno S. Ishigatsubo Y. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1251-1264Google Scholar). However, in these studies their interaction with paxillin was not reported. Consequently, the defects in cell adhesion/spreading caused by CH-ILKBP or affixin mutants were attributed to perturbation of their associations with ILK. In this study, we confirm a direct association of actopaxin with ILK and further examine a role for paxillin binding in actopaxin and ILK subcellular localization. We show that the association with paxillin is essential for actopaxin and ILK targeting to focal adhesions. Additionally we demonstrate that the “kinase-dead” ILK (E359K) mutant, previously shown to act as a “dominant negative” in several cellular processes, retains wild-type kinase activity as recently reported (23Yamaji S. Suzuki A. Sugiyama Y. Koide Y. Yoshida M. Kanamori H. Mohri H. Ohno S. Ishigatsubo Y. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1251-1264Google Scholar) but fails to bind paxillin or actopaxin in vivo and also fails to localize to focal adhesions. Taken together these results suggest that correct subcellular localization of ILK through an intact paxillin-actopaxin-ILK protein assembly is likely to impact significantly on normal ILK signaling. Polyclonal actopaxin antibody has been described previously (9Nikolopoulos S.N. Turner C.E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1435-1448Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal ILK antibody (clone 3) was generated in collaboration with Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY) and was previously characterized (11Nikolopoulos S.N. Turner C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23499-23505Google Scholar). Paxillin monoclonal antibody (clone 349) was also from Transduction Laboratories; paxillin phospho-Y118 polyclonal antibody was a gift from Dr. Erik Schaeffer (BIOSOURCE International (Camarillo, CA)); α-actinin and vinculin monoclonal antibodies were from Sigma; Xpress monoclonal antibody was from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA), and GFP rabbit polyclonal antibody was a generous gift of Dr. P. Silver (Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA). Rat aortic smooth muscle cells, rat embryo fibroblasts (REF-52), and HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Mediatech, Washington, D. C.) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals), 1 mm glutamine, and 50 units/ml penicillin-50 μg/ml streptomycin (Sigma). Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells were cultured in modified Ham's F-12 medium (Mediatech) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated, certified fetal bovine serum and 50 units/ml penicillin- 50 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified chamber with 5% CO2. Transfection of HeLa cells was performed with Fugene 6TM (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) following the instructions of the manufacturer. GFP-ILK containing a deletion of the first ankyrin repeat (GFP-ILKΔANK1) (aa 51–452) (Fig. 3) was generated by PCR using rat ILK as template andPfu polymerase (Stratagene), followed by subcloning of the PCR product into the EcoRI site of the EGFP-C2 vector (CLONTECH). The Xpress-ILK N terminus (aa 1–189) or Xpress-ILK C terminus (aa 190–452) (Fig. 3) was similarly generated by PCR and subcloning of the PCR products in the EcoRI site of the pcDNA3.1HisC vector (Invitrogen). The GFP-ILKE359K and Xpress-actopaxin F271D mutants were generated with the Quik Change Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using the rat GFP-ILK and Xpress-actopaxin as template, respectively, according to the instructions of the manufacturer. All constructs were sequenced on both strands (BioResource Center, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY). All other ILK or actopaxin constructs were previously described (9Nikolopoulos S.N. Turner C.E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1435-1448Google Scholar, 11Nikolopoulos S.N. Turner C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23499-23505Google Scholar). Individual glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins of the GST vector, paxillin LD1 motif (aa 1–20), and full-length actopaxin (aa 1–372) were expressed in Escherichia coli (BL21) and purified on glutathione-agarose beads as described previously (10Turner C.E. Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Riedy M.C. Nikolopoulos S.N. McDonald A.R. Bagrodia S. Thomas S. Leventhal P.S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 851-863Google Scholar). For in vitro binding experiments, GST, GST-paxillin LD1, or GST-actopaxin fusion proteins were incubated with [35S]methionine-labeled ILK generated by in vitro transcription-translation in a cell-free reticulocyte lysate system (TnT, Promega, Madison, WI) following the instructions of the manufacturer. The reaction mixture containing the [35S]methionine-labeled ILK was clarified by centrifugation prior to incubation with GST-fusion proteins and 0.1% (w/v) ovalbumin (Sigma) in binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (Sigma). After four washes in binding buffer, bound ILK was analyzed on SDS-PAGE gels followed by enhanced fluorography using AmplifyTM (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). For in vivo binding studies, cells were lysed in co-immunoprecipitation buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). The association of endogenous ILK with actopaxin was demonstrated by immunoprecipitation of actopaxin from rat aortic smooth muscle lysates with actopaxin antibody and protein A/G-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C, fractionation of the immunoprecipitates by SDS-PAGE, transfer to nitrocellulose membranes, and probing of the membranes with ILK antibody. For co-precipitation experiments with exogenously expressed proteins, cells were lysed in co-immunoprecipitation buffer and protein complexes precipitated using antibodies to GFP or control immunoglobulin followed by Western blotting as indicated. HeLa cells transfected with GFP-ILK constructs were lysed in a modified radioimmune precipitation buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 25 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, 25 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmp-nitrophenyl phosphate), and immunoprecipitations with GFP antibody were performed. After four washes with lysis buffer and once with kinase buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 10 mm MnCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4), the immunoprecipitates were subjected to protein kinase assays in 20 μl of kinase reaction buffer containing 10 μCi of [32P]ATP and 10 μg of myelin basic protein (MBP) as substrate. After incubation for 20 min at room temperature with intermittent mixing, the reactions were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE. The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue to visualize MBP, dried on paper, and exposed against film for 1 h. Indirect immunofluorescence analysis was performed as previously described (7Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Turner C.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1109-1123Google Scholar) with the modification that antibody dilutions were made in Western block buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 0.2% Tween 20, 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin). Photographs were taken on a digital SPOTTMRT camera (Diagnostic Instruments Inc, Sterling Heights, MI). Images were processed using Adobe Photoshop 3.0.5. We previously described direct interactions between the paxillin LD1 motif and both actopaxin and ILK using GST-paxillin LD motif fusion proteins and35S-labeled Xpress-tagged actopaxin or Xpress-tagged ILK (9Nikolopoulos S.N. Turner C.E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1435-1448Google Scholar, 11Nikolopoulos S.N. Turner C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23499-23505Google Scholar). During the course of these experiments, a GST-actopaxin fusion protein was also tested for its ability to bind 35S-labeled Xpress-ILK. As illustrated in Fig. 1,A and B, Xpress-ILK, in addition to binding paxillin LD1 motif, also bound efficiently to GST-actopaxin, thus indicating a direct association between these two proteins. Our previous characterization of paxillin interactions with actopaxin and ILK revealed that actopaxin binds to both paxillin LD1 and LD4, whereas ILK binds only to LD1 motif in vitro. The observed direct association of actopaxin and ILK in vitro (Fig. 1,A and B) urged us to examine if ILK still binds exclusively to the paxillin LD1 motif when incubated with cell lysates. Each paxillin GST-LD motif (Fig. 1C) was incubated with rat aortic smooth muscle cell lysates in a precipitation binding experiment followed by Western blotting with ILK antibody. In this case, ILK co-precipitated with both the LD1 and LD4 motif (Fig. 1D). Reprobing of the blot with α−actinin antibody revealed that α−actinin was unable to bind any paxillin LD motif, whereas reprobing with actopaxin antibody confirmed binding to both LD1 and LD4 ((9) and data not shown). These results demonstrate the capacity of ILK to bind paxillin both directly and indirectly, potentially through association with actopaxin. To evaluate further the interaction between actopaxin, ILK, and paxillin in vivo, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed using lysates from several fibroblast or epithelial cell lines including rat aortic smooth muscle (Fig. 2) and REF-52, IEC-18, and CHO-K1 (data not shown). Total lysates from these cell lines were incubated with actopaxin antibody or with control rabbit IgG. Immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and Western blots were probed sequentially with ILK, paxillin, and α-actinin antibodies. ILK was strongly co-immunoprecipitated with the actopaxin antibody from all lysates, as was paxillin, whereas α-actinin failed to bind (Fig. 2). In addition, the co-precipitation of actopaxin and paxillin with ILK was retained in lysates from rat aortic smooth muscle cells maintained in suspension for 2 h (Fig. 2), indicating that the actopaxin-ILK-paxillin associations are not adhesion-dependent. To determine the region of ILK required for binding to actopaxin, we performed co-transfection experiments in HeLa cells using GFP-actopaxin with Xpress-ILK (aa 1–452), Xpress-ILK N terminus (aa 1–189), or Xpress-ILK C terminus (aa 190–452) (Fig. 3). Following transfection, cells were lysed in co-immunoprecipitation buffer, and immunoprecipitation using either GFP or control rabbit IgG antibodies was performed. Both endogenous ILK and Xpress-ILK, as well as the Xpress-ILK C terminus, were co-precipitated with GFP-actopaxin (Fig.4). Paxillin was also co-precipitated under these conditions. A reprobe of the blot with α-actinin showed no binding to the immunoprecipitates, thus confirming the specificity of the associations. In contrast, Xpress-ILK N terminus failed to co-precipitate with actopaxin (data not shown). Taken together these data suggest that the C-terminal domain of ILK contains the binding site for actopaxin in addition to binding sites for paxillin (11Nikolopoulos S.N. Turner C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23499-23505Google Scholar) and β1 integrin (13Hannigan G.E. Leung-Hagesteijn C. Fitz-Gibbon L. Coppolino M.G. Radeva G. Filmus J. Bell J.C. Dedhar S. Nature. 1996; 379: 91-96Google Scholar). We described previously the presence of a PBS within the C terminus of ILK. Mutations within the PBS of ILK abrogated its association with paxillin in vitro (11Nikolopoulos S.N. Turner C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23499-23505Google Scholar). To assess the ability of the ILK PBS mutant to bind actopaxin, we performed bothin vitro and in vivo binding experiments. For thein vitro experiments, ILK PBS mutant was generated by coupled transcription-translation as [35S]methionine-labeled protein and used in binding reactions with GST, paxillin GST-LD1 motif, and GST-actopaxin. The ILK PBS mutant was able to bind GST-actopaxin (Fig.5A), although less efficiently than the wild-type ILK (Fig. 1), thus indicating that actopaxin and paxillin binding sites are distinct. In contrast, when co-precipitation binding experiments were performed with the actopaxin and ILK PBS mutant proteins were expressed in vivo, we were not co-precipitate actopaxin with the ILK PBS mutant (Fig. 5B). Thus, although actopaxin is capable of binding in vitro to an ILK mutant defective for paxillin binding, the reduced affinity of this interaction precludes a stable association between ILK and actopaxin in vivo. Additionally, we performed binding experiments with a GFP-ILK mutant lacking the first N-terminal ankyrin repeat, a domain previously shown to be critical for PINCH binding (14Tu Y. Li F. Goicoechea S. Wu C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2425-2434Google Scholar). Interestingly the ILKΔANK1 mutant retained the capacity to bind actopaxin but failed to efficiently co-precipitate paxillin (Fig. 5B). Although this result provides further evidence that the paxillin and actopaxin binding sites on ILK are distinct, it also suggests that certain ILK mutants may exhibit more global perturbations in structure. We have previously mapped the paxillin binding site on actopaxin to a PBS motif within the CH2 domain (Fig. 3). To identify the ILK binding site on actopaxin we performed co-precipitation experiments from cells co-transfected with GFP-ILK and Xpress-actopaxin constructs representing the wild-type (aa 1–372), the N-terminal (aa 1–222), or C-terminal (aa 223–372) region (Fig. 3). As with paxillin (9Nikolopoulos S.N. Turner C.E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1435-1448Google Scholar), Western blots of the immunoprecipitates and of the corresponding lysates demonstrated that GFP-ILK bound both full-length actopaxin and the C-terminal fragment but not the N terminus (Fig.6A). To assess whether ILK and paxillin binding sites within the actopaxin CH2 domain are separable, we used the Xpress-actopaxin PBS mutant that is incapable of binding paxillin in vitro (9Nikolopoulos S.N. Turner C.E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1435-1448Google Scholar) in co-transfection experiments with GFP-ILK wild-type. Western blot analysis of GFP immunoprecipitates with Xpress Ab showed that GFP-ILK binds as efficiently to the actopaxin PBS mutant as to actopaxin wild-type (Fig. 6B). Reprobing of the same blot with paxillin showed that co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous paxillin with the GFP-ILK wild-type/Xpress-actopaxin PBS mutant is substantially reduced as compared with GFP-ILK wild-type/Xpress-actopaxin wild-type precipitates and likely represents the fraction of paxillin binding directly to ILK. These results indicate that the ILK and paxillin binding sites on actopaxin are distinct. A recent report indicated that a point mutant (F271D) of CH-ILKBP (which is identical to human actopaxin/α-parvin) is incapable of binding ILK in vitro and of localizing to focal adhesions in rat mesangial cells (22Tu Y. Huang Y. Zhang Y. Hua Y. Wu C. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 585-598Google Scholar). We generated the same mutation in rat actopaxin cDNA and tested its capacity to localize to focal adhesions and to bind paxillin and ILK. In our hands, actopaxin F271D localizes to focal adhesions when it is transfected into HeLa cells. In certain cases robust localization was observed (Fig.7B, a andb) whereas in others localization was attenuated (asterisks in Fig. 7B, c andd). Co-precipitation experiments showed that the actopaxin F271D mutant binds at wild type levels to ILK (Fig. 7A). However, the amount of paxillin co-precipitated in these experiments was substantially reduced to a level similar to that seen with the ILK-actopaxin PBS mutant co-precipitation experiments (see Fig.6B and data not shown). These data indicate that the reduced overall efficiency of localization of the F271D actopaxin mutant is likely due to perturbation of paxillin, rather than ILK binding. We have previously shown that an actopaxin PBS mutant is unable to target to focal adhesions, as a result of its inability to bind to paxillin (9Nikolopoulos S.N. Turner C.E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1435-1448Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the biochemical data presented above suggest that an ILK-actopaxin interaction may be important for the subcellular localization of these two proteins. Thus, we examined the subcellular distribution of ILK and actopaxin wild-type and mutant proteins expressed in HeLa cells. Both actopaxin wild-type and ILK wild-type localized efficiently to focal adhesions when they were transfected as single constructs, or if they were co-transfected into HeLa cells (Fig.8A, a andb). In contrast, the actopaxin PBS mutant or the ILK PBS mutant when transfected separately remained cytoplasmic, as we previously reported (9Nikolopoulos S.N. Turner C.E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1435-1448Google Scholar, 11Nikolopoulos S.N. Turner C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23499-23505Google Scholar) (and data not shown). Additionally, as expected both the actopaxin PBS mutant and the ILK PBS mutant proteins remained cytoplasmic when co-transfected (Fig. 8A,c and d). Although the ILKΔANK1 mutant is capable of binding actopaxin in vivo (Fig. 5B), it is incapable of localizing to focal adhesions even in the presence of exogenous actopaxin (Fig. 8A, e andf) confirming previous reports (14Tu Y. Li F. Goicoechea S. Wu C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2425-2434Google Scholar) (Fig. 8A). However, in co-transfection experiments of GFP-ILK with Xpress-actopaxin PBS mutant, the actopaxin PBS mutant protein was able to localize to focal adhesions in ∼50% of transfectants (results of three independent experiments) (Fig. 8, A, g andh, and B). Taken together these data suggest that while the primary mechanism of recruitment of actopaxin and ILK to focal adhesions is through their direct binding to paxillin, alternative mechanisms may be utilized under certain experimental or physiologic conditions. The ILK E359K mutant has previously been described to function as a kinase-dead form of ILK and to act as a dominant negative for ILK signaling in the context of cell adhesion, fibronectin matrix assembly, cell cycle progression, and myogenic differentiation (13Hannigan G.E. Leung-Hagesteijn C. Fitz-Gibbon L. Coppolino M.G. Radeva G. Filmus J. Bell J.C. Dedhar S. Nature. 1996; 379: 91-96Google Scholar, 16Delcommenne M. Tan C. Gray V. Rue L. Woodgett J. Dedhar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11211-11216Google Scholar, 18Wu C. Keightley S.Y. Leung-Hagesteijn C. Radeva G. Coppolino M. Goicoechea S. McDonald J.A. Dedhar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 528-536Google Scholar, 21Huang Y. Li J. Zhang Y. Wu C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 861-872Google Scholar). We have generated the kinase-deficient ILK mutant (E359K) and tested its ability to interact with actopaxin and paxillin by co-transfection experiments of GFP-ILK E359K with Xpress-actopaxin. In contrast to wild-type ILK, which co-precipitated both actopaxin and paxillin, no binding of these proteins to the ILK E359K mutant was observed (Fig. 9A). Furthermore, immunofluorescence staining of ILK E359K transfected cells showed that the ILK E359K mutant cannot target to focal adhesions but remains cytosolic (Fig. 9B). Finally, it has been suggested recently that the ILK E359K mutant may retain kinase activity (23Yamaji S. Suzuki A. Sugiyama Y. Koide Y. Yoshida M. Kanamori H. Mohri H. Ohno S. Ishigatsubo Y. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1251-1264Google Scholar). The kinase activity of the ILK E359K mutant relative to the ILK PBS mutant and the ILK wild-type was examined. GFP vector, GFP-ILK, GFP-ILK E359K, and GFP-ILK PBS mutant were transfected into HeLa cells, and kinase activities of the GFP immunoprecipitates were assayed using MBP as a substrate (Fig.9C). Western blots with equal amounts of lysates from the transfectants were also prepared to determine the amount of exogenous GFP-ILK among transfectants (Fig. 9D). From both experiments we determine there are no significant differences between the basal kinase activity of the wild-type ILK and the E359K or PBS mutants under these assay conditions. Taken together these data suggest that the “kinase-deficient” ILK E359K mutant may exhibit its dominant negative phenotype as a result of inappropriate subcellular localization rather than as a consequence of defective kinase activity. We have previously reported that paxillin through its LD1 motif binds directly to the focal adhesion proteins actopaxin (9Nikolopoulos S.N. Turner C.E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1435-1448Google Scholar) and ILK (11Nikolopoulos S.N. Turner C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23499-23505Google Scholar). Recently, actopaxin family members have been isolated as ILK-interacting proteins in yeast two-hybrid screens and named CH-ILKBP (identical to human actopaxin/α-parvin) (22Tu Y. Huang Y. Zhang Y. Hua Y. Wu C. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 585-598Google Scholar) and affixin (identical to β-parvin) (23Yamaji S. Suzuki A. Sugiyama Y. Koide Y. Yoshida M. Kanamori H. Mohri H. Ohno S. Ishigatsubo Y. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1251-1264Google Scholar). In the present study we confirm that actopaxin and ILK can associate directly and provide further evidence for the importance of paxillin binding in their efficient localization at focal adhesions. Furthermore, we present evidence that the dominant negative effects of the ILK E359K mutant, may be due to a deficiency in paxillin and actopaxin binding and thus loss of focal adhesion localization, as opposed to a defect in kinase activity. As is the case with other paxillin LD motif binding proteins such as vinculin and FAK, the C-terminal domains of actopaxin and ILK contain a PBS. Mutation of either the actopaxin or ILK PBS eliminates paxillin binding and also the ability of either actopaxin or ILK to localize to focal adhesions (9Nikolopoulos S.N. Turner C.E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1435-1448Google Scholar, 11Nikolopoulos S.N. Turner C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23499-23505Google Scholar). Interestingly, and consistent with recent reports (22Tu Y. Huang Y. Zhang Y. Hua Y. Wu C. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 585-598Google Scholar, 23Yamaji S. Suzuki A. Sugiyama Y. Koide Y. Yoshida M. Kanamori H. Mohri H. Ohno S. Ishigatsubo Y. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1251-1264Google Scholar), we find that ILK and actopaxin also interact directly through their respective C-terminal domains. However, although ILK, like paxillin, binds to the second CH domain of actopaxin, its binding is unaffected by an actopaxin PBS mutation, thus demonstrating that paxillin and ILK binding sites on actopaxin are distinct. Similarly, ILK PBS mutants retain the capacity to bind actopaxin in vitro, indicating that the paxillin and actopaxin binding sites within the ILK C terminus are also distinct. However, the ILK PBS mutant was unable to bind actopaxin in vivo, suggesting that the two binding sites are closely juxtaposed and that the PBS mutation is sufficient to interfere with optimal folding of the adjacent actopaxin binding site. Additionally, certain mutations within the ILK molecule, such as the E359K mutant (see below) and the ΔANK1 mutant, appear to exert more global effects on protein folding. The N-terminal ANK1 repeat has previously been identified as the PINCH binding site (14Tu Y. Li F. Goicoechea S. Wu C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2425-2434Google Scholar). However, the ΔANK1 ILK mutant has also lost the capacity to bind paxillin, while retaining functional actopaxin binding. Consistent with previous reports (14Tu Y. Li F. Goicoechea S. Wu C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2425-2434Google Scholar) the ΔANK1 ILK mutant remained cytosolic when transfected into HeLa cells, thus indicating that robust actopaxin binding is insufficient for ILK recruitment to focal adhesions. Whether ILK requires both PINCH and paxillin binding for efficient targeting remains to be determined. Our previous studies have suggested that paxillin binding is essential for normal localization of actopaxin to focal adhesions. Recently, however, it was reported that a point mutation (F271D) of CH-ILKBP (identical to human actopaxin) abrogated the CH-ILKBP-ILK associationin vitro and rendered the protein incapable of localizing to focal adhesions when expressed in rat mesangial cells. These data suggested that CH-ILKBP (actopaxin) is recruited to focal adhesions through its association with ILK (22Tu Y. Huang Y. Zhang Y. Hua Y. Wu C. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 585-598Google Scholar). We created the same mutation in rat actopaxin and found that the actopaxin F271D mutant binds ILKin vivo as efficiently as the wild-type actopaxin or its PBS mutant. In contrast, co-precipitation of paxillin was substantially reduced to a level similar to that seen with the ILK-actopaxin PBS mutant combination. Additionally, the actopaxin F271D mutant localized to focal adhesions when introduced into HeLa cells albeit with reduced efficiency compared with the wild-type protein. Taken together, these results confirm that mutation of residue Phe-271 compromises actopaxin targeting to focal adhesions, but that this is likely due to perturbation of paxillin binding rather than the actopaxin-ILK association. Indeed Phe-271 is only two residues upstream of the minimal PBS domain (9Nikolopoulos S.N. Turner C.E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1435-1448Google Scholar). These data reinforce a primary role for paxillin in the recruitment of actopaxin to focal adhesions. However, one result that is in potential conflict with this model is the ability of an actopaxin PBS mutant to localize to focal adhesions in 50% of the cells when it is co-transfected with ILK. Although in the absence of ILK overexpression the actopaxin PBS mutant never localizes to focal adhesions (Figs. 8and 9), this result suggests that under certain physiologic conditions ILK binding alone may be sufficient for actopaxin recruitment. It should be noted, however, that this does not preclude a role for paxillin in this particular scenario, because ILK targeting is dependent on paxillin. Thus, although actopaxin can bind directly to both the LD1 and LD4 motifs of paxillin, it may also interact indirectly with paxillin via ILK binding to LD1. Similarly, we have found that ILK can interact indirectly with the paxillin LD4 motif, possibly through association with actopaxin. How the cell utilizes the differential binding capacity of the paxillin LD motifs (6Turner C.E. Nat.

ILK kinase activity has been implicated in the regulation of multiple physiologic processes including cell adhesion/transformation (13Hannigan G.E. Leung-Hagesteijn C. Fitz-Gibbon L. Coppolino M.G.

A. 2000; 97: 3207-3212Google Scholar), and myogenic differentiation (21Huang Y. Li J. Zhang Y. Wu C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 861-872Google Scholar). These assignments were based primarily on the effects of overexpression of the ILK E359K mutant relative to wild-type ILK. In this study we demonstrate that in precipitation kinase assays the ILK E359K mutant exhibits basal kinase activity comparable with the wild-type protein as reported by others (23Yamaji S. Suzuki A. Sugiyama Y. Koide Y. Yoshida M. Kanamori H. Mohri H. Ohno S. Ishigatsubo Y. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1251-1264Google Scholar). Importantly, however, the ILK E359K mutant is incapable of interacting with actopaxin and paxillin in vivo. This is perhaps not surprising considering the close proximity of the Glu-359 residue to the defined minimal PBS of ILK which starts at Ser-377 (11Nikolopoulos S.N. Turner C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23499-23505Google Scholar). Accordingly, the ILK E359K mutant does not localize to focal adhesions when expressed in HeLa cells. Taken together these observations suggest that the dominant negative effects exerted by the ILK E359K mutant may be due to inappropriate subcellular localization as a result of its inability to bind paxillin (and actopaxin), rather than due to alterations in kinase propertiesper se. Nevertheless, it is likely that correct subcellular localization of ILK is essential for appropriate integrin- and growth factor-mediated stimulation of ILK kinase activity and subsequent downstream signaling events. Finally, both ILK and actopaxin have homologues in Caenorhabditis elegans (pat-4 and pat-6, respectively) andDrosophila. A proposed role for these proteins in mediating actin-membrane attachment has been suggested by genetic studies that include mutations/deletions of these homologues. Loss ofpat-4 or pat-6 results in phenotypes that resemble the elimination of α or β integrin homologues (pat-2 and pat-3, respectively) and are characterized by defects in muscle cell body and dense bodies (25Williams B.D. Waterston R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 475-490Google Scholar, 26Gettner S.N. Kenyon C. Reichardt L.F. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1127-1141Google Scholar, 27Hobert O. Moerman D.G. Clark K.A. Beckerle M.C. Ruvkun G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 45-57Google Scholar). In addition, mutations in Drosophila ILK results in detachment of actin filaments from the membrane at the muscle attachment sites. Again this phenotype is comparable with that observed following loss of integrin function and suggests a primary structural role for ILK and actopaxin in linking integrins to the actin cytoskeleton (28Zervas C.G. Gregory S.L. Brown N.H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1007-1018Google Scholar). Paxillin is similarly localized to skeletal muscle myotendinous junctions and smooth muscle dense plaques in higher eukaryotes (29Turner C.E. Kramarcy N. Sealock R. Burridge K. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 192: 651-655Google Scholar). A paxillin homologue has recently been described inDrosophila where its expression pattern coincides with sites of high integrin mRNA levels (30Wheeler G.N. Hynes R.O. Gene. 2001; 262: 291-299Google Scholar). Importantly, the domain structure of paxillin, including the LIM domains and LD motifs, is highly conserved across species. Thus, in addition to potentially facilitating integrin-mediated signal transduction, the paxillin-actopaxin-ILK associations discussed in this report are likely to be of fundamental importance in the structural organization of extracellular matrix-actin interactions and thus normal muscle function.

We previously identified PINCH, an adaptor protein comprising primarily five LIM domains, as a binding protein for integrin-linked kinase (ILK). In this study, we show that PINCH co-localizes with ILK in both focal adhesions and fibrillar adhesions. Furthermore, we have investigated the molecular basis underlying the targeting of PINCH to the cell-matrix contact sites and the functional significance of the PINCH-ILK interaction. We have found that the N-terminal LIM1 domain, which mediates the ILK binding, is required for the targeting of PINCH to the cell-matrix contact sites.

Focal adhesions represent firm substrate attachment sites that typically are arrowhead-shaped and contain clusters of integrins and cytoskeletal and signaling molecules including talin, viculin, focal adhesion kinase, and paxillin. Fibrillar adhesions form between fibrillar matrix such as fibronectin fibrils and actin cytoskeleton. Fibrillar adhesions are more elongated (typical axial ratio, >7) and are rich in integrins, fibronectin, and tensin, but they are deficient in paxillin and several other components of focal adhesions (5Zamir E.

Recent studies have suggested that ILK plays a crucial role in the assembly and functions of the cell-matrix adhesion structures (17Dedhar S. Williams B. Hannigan G.

PINCH is a widely expressed and evolutionarily conserved protein comprising primarily five LIM domains. In previous studies, we have shown that PINCH binds to ILK (18Wu C. J.

Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 585-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), an ILK C-terminal domain-binding protein, in cells. Mutational studies have shown that the formation of the PINCH-ILK complex is mediated by a direct interaction between the second zinc finger located within the PINCH LIM1 domain and the N-terminal ANK domain of ILK (13Li F. Zhang Y. Wu C. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4589-4599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Tu Y. Li F. Goicoechea S. Wu C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2425-2434Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of the PINCH LIM1 domain has recently been solved. It folds into a globular structure consisting of two zinc fingers, each of which comprises two antiparallel β-sheets (22Velyvis A. Yang Y. Wu C. Qin J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4932-4939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Consistent with the mutational studies, chemical mapping studies have revealed that many residues in the second zinc finger of the PINCH LIM1 domain undergo large chemical shift changes upon ILK binding (22Velyvis A. Yang Y. Wu C. Qin J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4932-4939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). PINCH has been detected in integrin-rich cell-matrix adhesion sites in cells that are spreading on fibronectin (13Li F. Zhang Y. Wu C. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4589-4599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The current study is aimed at determining (i) whether PINCH co-localizes with ILK in both focal adhesions and fibrillar adhesions, (ii) the molecular basis underlying the targeting of PINCH to the cell-matrix contact sites, and (iii) the function of the PINCH-ILK interaction in cell spreading and migration. Mouse C2C12 cells (from American Type Culture Collection) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Rat embryo fibroblasts (REF-52, kindly provided by Dr. James Pipas, the University of Pittsburgh) were cultured in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. CHO K1 cells were cultured in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. DNA fragments encoding the FLAG-tagged full-length or mutant forms (as specified in each experiment) of human PINCH were cloned into the pEGFP-C2 expression vector (CLONTECH). C2C12 cells and CHO K1 cells were transfected with the GFP expression vectors using LipofectAMINE PLUS (Invitrogen) as described (21Tu Y. Huang Y. Zhang Z. Hua Y. Wu C. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 585-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 23Huang Y. Li J. Zhang Z. Wu C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 861-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). CHO K1 cells stably expressing GFP and GFP fusion proteins were selected with 1 mg/ml of G418 (Invitrogen) and cloned as described previously (23Huang Y. Li J. Zhang Z. Wu C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 861-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 24Li J. Mayne R. Wu C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1391-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The adenoviral expressing vector encoding a FLAG-tagged N-terminal fragment of ILK (residues 1–230) was generated based on a previously described protocol (25He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3253) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cDNA fragment encoding the FLAG-tagged N-terminal fragment of ILK was cloned into theSalI/XbaI sites of the pAdTrack-CMV shuttle vector. The shuttle vector plasmid was linearized with PmeI, purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, and mixed with supercoiled pADEsay-1. The vectors were transferred intoEscherichia coli BJ5183 by electroporation using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser electroporator. The bacteria were immediately placed in 1 ml of LB Broth (10 g/l tryptone, 5 g/l yeast extract, and 5 g/l NaCl) (Fisher) and grown at 37 °C for 1 h. The bacteria were then inoculated onto agar containing LB Broth supplemented with 50 μg/ml of kanamycin. After 16–20 h of growth, colonies were picked and grown in 2 ml of LB Broth containing 50 μg/ml of kanamycin. The clones were screened by digestions with restriction endonucleasesPacI and BamHI. The positive supercoiled plasmids were transformed into DH10B cells by electroporation for large scale amplification. The plasmid DNA was digested with PacI and ethanol-precipitated and was used to transfect 293 cells using LipofectAMINE PLUS. The transfected cells were harvested 10 days after transfection. The cells were lysed by three cycles of freezing in a methanol/dry ice bath and rapid thawing at 37 °C, and the lysates containing the recombinant adenovirus were collected. The control adenoviral expression vector encoding β-galactosidase was kindly provided by Drs. Tong-Chuan He and Bert Vogelstein (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, the Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, Baltimore, MD). The recombinant adenoviral expressing vector encoding the FLAG-tagged N-terminal ILK fragment and the control vector were used to infect REF-52 cells. The infection efficiency was monitored by the expression of GFP encoded by the viral vectors and typically reached 80–90% within 48 h. The expression of the FLAG-tagged N-terminal ILK fragment in the infected cells was further confirmed by Western blotting with monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody M5. Immunofluorescence staining was performed as described (13Li F. Zhang Y. Wu C. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4589-4599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Tu Y. Huang Y. Zhang Z. Hua Y. Wu C. J.

Briefly, cells (as specified in each experiment) were plated in complete medium on fibronectin- or vitronectin-coated coverslips or Lab-Tek eight-chamber culture slides and cultured for 24 h. The cells were then fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and stained with mouse monoclonal anti-ILK antibody 65.1 (13Li F. Zhang Y. Wu C. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4589-4599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or monoclonal anti-paxillin antibody (clone 349; Transduction Laboratories). The mouse antibodies were detected with a Rhodamine RedTM-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs, Inc., West Grove, PA). Similar results were obtained with cells plated on fibronectin- or vitronectin-coated surfaces. The cells were cultured in complete medium in 60- or 100-mm culture plates. Cell monolayers were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and directly lysed on the plates with 1% Triton X-100 in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 150 mm NaCl, 10 mmNa4P2O7, 2 mmNa3VO4, 100 mm NaF, and protease inhibitors. The protocol for immunoprecipitation with monoclonal anti-CH-ILKBP antibody was previously described (21Tu Y. Huang Y. Zhang Z. Hua Y. Wu C. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 585-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell lysates (500 μg) were mixed with 500 μl of hybridoma culture supernatant containing monoclonal anti-CH-ILKBP antibody 1D4. The samples were incubated for 3 h, mixed with 40 μl of UltraLink immobilized protein G (Pierce), and then incubated for an additional 1.5 h. The beads were washed four times, and the proteins bound were released from the beads by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer for 5 min. The samples were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-CH-ILKBP antibody 3B5, anti-ILK antibody 65.1, or rabbit polyclonal anti-PINCH antibodies as specified in each experiment. For immunoprecipitation of GFP-FLAG-ΔLIM5 (PINCH residues 1–249), GFP-FLAG-ΔLIM1 (PINCH residues 63–325), and GFP-FLAG-LIM1–2 (PINCH residues 1–130), the cells expressing the corresponding GFP- and FLAG-tagged PINCH mutants or those expressing GFP as a control were lysed as described above. The lysates (300 μg) were mixed with 30 μl of agarose beads conjugated with anti-FLAG antibody M2 (Sigma). The precipitated proteins were released from the beads by boiling in 50 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer for 5 min and analyzed by Western blotting (8 μl/lane) with antibodies as specified in each experiment. The cells (as specified in each experiment) were plated on 96-well plates coated with vitronectin (BD Biosciences, Bedford, MS) in Opti-MEM I serum-free medium (Invitrogen). The plates were incubated at 37 °C under a 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere for different periods of time (as specified in each experiment). The cell morphology were observed under an Olympus IX70 fluorescence microscope equipped with an Hoffman Modulation Contrast system and recorded with a DVC-1310C MagnafireTM digital camera (Optronics). Unspread cells were defined as round cells, whereas spread cells were defined as cells with extended processes as described (21Tu Y. Huang Y. Zhang Z. Hua Y. Wu C. J.

The percentage of cells adopting spread morphology was quantified by analyzing at least 300 cells from three randomly selected fields (>100 cells/field) (21Tu Y. Huang Y. Zhang Z. Hua Y. Wu C. J.

Cell migration was assessed by the ability of the cells to migrate into a cell-free area as previously described (29Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1990; 60: 849-859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar, 30Chen P. Xie H. Sekar M.C. Gupta K. Wells A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 847-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were plated in complete medium on 24-well plates and grown for 24 h to reach confluence. The monolayers were then wounded by scratching with a plastic pipette tip. After washing, the cells were incubated in complete medium for the indicated times and observed under an Olympus IX70 microscope equipped with an Hoffman Modulation Contrast system. Images of three different segments of the cell-free area were recorded with a DVC-1310C MagnafireTMdigital camera (Optronics), and the distances traveled by the cells at the front in three different segments of the wound were measured. To test whether PINCH co-localizes with ILK in both focal adhesions and fibrillar adhesions, we expressed a GFP-tagged PINCH in mouse C2C12 cells. Cells expressing GFP-PINCH were stained with antibodies that recognize ILK (Fig.1, A and B), fibronectin (as a marker for fibrillar adhesions) (Fig. 1, Cand D), and paxillin (as a marker for focal adhesions) (Fig.1, E and F), respectively. GFP-PINCH was clustered in fibrillar adhesions that were rich in fibronectin (Fig. 1,C and D, arrowheads) but deficient in paxillin (Fig. 1, E and F,arrowheads). In addition, it localized to focal adhesions where abundant paxillin (Fig. 1, E and F,arrows) but little or no fibronectin clusters (Fig. 1,C and D, arrows) were detected. Analyses of cells stained with the monoclonal anti-ILK antibody showed that GFP-PINCH co-localized with ILK in both types of cell-matrix contact sites (Fig. 1, A and B, arrowsand arrowheads). We next analyzed the PINCH domains that are involved in the localization of PINCH to the cell-matrix contact sites. Because PINCH binds to ILK (13Li F. Zhang Y. Wu C. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4589-4599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Tu Y. Li F. Goicoechea S. Wu C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2425-2434Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), and PINCH and ILK co-localize in cell-matrix adhesion sites (Fig. 1), we hypothesized that the ILK-binding is required for the localization of PINCH to the cell-matrix contact sites. To test this, we expressed PINCH mutants in which either the N-terminal-most ILK-binding LIM1 domain or the C-terminal-most LIM5 domain is deleted in C2C12 cells. The PINCH mutants were tagged with GFP and a FLAG epitope to facilitate cellular and biochemical analyses. The expression of the GFP- and FLAG-tagged ΔLIM1 (Fig. 2A,lane 2) and ΔLIM5 (Fig. 2A, lane 1) PINCH mutants was confirmed by Western blotting with an anti-GFP antibody. To test whether the PINCH mutants bind to ILK, we immunoprecipitated the GFP- and FLAG-tagged PINCH mutants from the cell lysates with a monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 2A,lanes 4 and 5). Western blotting analyses of the ΔLIM1 and ΔLIM5 immunoprecipitates showed that ILK was co-precipitated with ΔLIM5 (Fig. 2B, lane 4) but not with ΔLIM1 (Fig. 2B, lane 5). In control experiments, neither GFP (Fig. 2A, lane 6) nor ILK (Fig. 2B, lane 6) was precipitated with the anti-FLAG antibody from lysates of control cells that express GFP, confirming the specificity of the immunoprecipitation assay. Taken together, these results show that the GFP-FLAG-ΔLIM5, but not GFP-FLAG-ΔLIM1, binds to ILK in cells. To determine the ability of the PINCH mutants to localize to cell-matrix contact sites, we plated the C2C12 cells expressing GFP-FLAG-ΔLIM1 or GFP-FLAG-ΔLIM5 on fibronectin-coated coverslips and stained them with monoclonal anti-ILK antibody 65.1. The ILK-binding defective LIM1 deletion mutant (Fig. 2C), unlike the full-length PINCH (Fig. 1), was unable to localize to cell-matrix contact sites where abundant ILK was detected (Fig. 2D), suggesting that the ILK binding is essential for the localization of PINCH to the cell-matrix contact sites. By contrast, the LIM5 deletion mutant was able to co-localize with ILK in cell-matrix contact sites (Fig. 2, E and F), indicating that the LIM5 domain, unlike the LIM1 domain, is not required for the localization of PINCH. The level of the LIM5 deletion mutant (Fig. 2E) that was detected in the cell-matrix contact sites, however, appeared lower than that of the full-length PINCH (Fig. 1), suggesting that deletion of LIM5 decreases the efficiency or the stability of the PINCH localization to the cell-matrix contact sites. To further analyze this, we expressed a PINCH mutant in which LIM3–5 were deleted in C2C12 cells. The expression of the PINCH mutant (LIM1–2) was confirmed by Western blotting with a monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 3A, lane 4). As expected, ILK (Fig. 3B, lane 2) was readily co-immunoprecipitated with GFP-FLAG-LIM1–2 (Fig.3A, lane 2). In control experiment, no ILK (Fig.3B, lane 1) was precipitated by the anti-FLAG antibody in the absence of GFP-FLAG-LIM1–2 (Fig. 3A,lane 1), confirming the specificity of the co-immunoprecipitation experiment. Fluorescence microscopic analyses showed that GFP-FLAG-LIM1–2 distributed rather diffusely in cells (Fig. 3, C, E, and G). A closer examination of the cells revealed that in some but not all cells, a very low level of GFP-FLAG-LIM1–2 clusters was present in cell adhesion sites where ILK was clustered (Fig. 3, E andF). Taken together, these results suggest that deletion of the LIM3–5 domains greatly impairs the ability of PINCH to localize to cell-matrix contact sites. Thus, although the C-terminal LIM3–5 domains were not absolutely required for the targeting of PINCH to cell-matrix contact sites, they do play important roles in the regulation of PINCH localization. Intriguingly, although we have detected ILK clusters in cells overexpressing GFP-FLAG-LIM1–2 (Fig. 3, D andF), they often appeared smaller and less well organized than those in cells that overexpress GFP-FLAG-PINCH (Fig. 1B), GFP-FLAG-ΔLIM1 (Fig. 2D) or GFP alone (data not shown). Abundant paxillin clusters were detected in the GFP-FLAG-LIM1–2 overexpressing cells under the same condition (Fig. 3, G andH). These results suggest that overexpression of LIM1–2, which binds to ILK but fails to localize to the cell-matrix adhesion sites efficiently, negatively influences the localization of ILK to the adhesion sites. We next sought to assess the functional significance of the PINCH-ILK interaction. To do this, we generated reagents that allow us to modulate the PINCH-ILK interaction in cells. Because the LIM1–2 fragment binds efficiently to ILK in cells (Fig. 3), we postulated that it could potentially function as a dominant negative inhibitor of the PINCH-ILK interaction. To test this, we transfected CHO cells, which have been widely used in gene transfer experiments because of their high transfection efficiency, with expression vectors encoding either GFP-FLAG-LIM1–2 or GFP alone (as a control). Under the experimental conditions used, the transfection efficiency was ∼80% based on the percentages of CHO cells that expressed GFP or GFP-FLAG-LIM1–2. The expression of GFP (Fig.4A, lane 2) and GFP-FLAG-LIM1–2 (Fig. 4A, lane 3) in the corresponding transfectants was confirmed by Western blotting. To test the effect of LIM1–2 overexpression on the complex formation, we immunoprecipitated the PINCH-ILK-CH-ILKBP complex from lysates of CHO cells overexpressing GFP-FLAG-LIM1–2 and those of the GFP control cells, respectively, with monoclonal anti-CH-ILKBP antibody 1D4. Analyses of the immunoprecipitates showed that similar amounts of CH-ILKBP (Fig. 4B, lanes 3 and 4) and ILK (Fig. 4C, lanes 3 and 4) were precipitated from the GFP-FLAG-LIM1–2 overexpressing cells and the control cells. The amount of PINCH associated with ILK and CH-ILKBP was noticeably reduced in cells overexpressing LIM1–2 (Fig. 4D, compare lanes 3 and 4), suggesting that overexpression of LIM1–2 significantly inhibits the PINCH-ILK interaction. To facilitate studies on the functions of the PINCH-ILK interaction, we selected cells that stably express GFP-FLAG-LIM1–2 by culturing the transfectants in the presence of G418. Three independent clones (7.2, 8.1, and 9.1) were obtained. To investigate whether the PINCH-ILK interaction is involved in the cellular control of cell shape change, we plated the CHO cells stably expressing GFP-FLAG-LIM1–2, CHO cells stably expressing GFP-FLAG-PINCH, the control GFP-expressing cells, and the parental CHO cells on vitronectin-coated surfaces. Most of the parental CHO cells and GFP control cells spread within 30 min of plating (Fig. 5). Overexpression of GFP-FLAG-PINCH did not alter cell spreading (Fig. 5). By contrast, most of the GFP-FLAG-LIM1–2-expressing cells exhibited a round cell shape during the same period of time (Fig. 5), although they were able to spread after longer incubation time (Fig. 5A). Taken together, these results suggest that inhibition of the PINCH-ILK interaction significantly delays the change of cell shape. Cell migration is a pathologically and physiologically important process that involves dynamic changes of cell shape. The finding that the PINCH-ILK interaction is involved in the cellular control of cell shape change prompted us to test whether it plays a role in cell migration. To do this, we analyzed the migration of cells overexpressing GFP-FLAG-LIM1–2 using a “wound” assay, a well established in vitro system for measuring cell motility (29Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1990; 60: 849-859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar,30Chen P. Xie H. Sekar M.C. Gupta K. Wells A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 847-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The results showed that the cells overexpressing GFP-FLAG-LIM1–2 migrated much more slowly than the cells overexpressing GFP-FLAG-PINCH, the parental cells, and the GFP control cells (Fig.6). Thus, consistent with the retardation in cell spreading, overexpression of the LIM1–2 fragment significantly impairs the cell motility. Because the N-terminal ANK domain of ILK mediates the binding to PINCH, we hypothesized that overexpressing the ILK N-terminal ANK fragment might also inhibit the PINCH-ILK interaction. To test this, we generated an adenoviral vector encoding a FLAG-tagged ILK N-terminal ANK fragment, which allowed us to express the ILK fragment with high efficiency (typically 80–90%). We infected rat embryo fibroblasts (REF-52) with the recombinant adenovirus encoding the ANK fragment or that encoding an irrelevant protein (β-galactosidase) as a control. The expression of the FLAG-tagged ILK N-terminal ANK fragment in the REF-52 cells that were infected with the adenovirus encoding the ANK fragment (Fig.7A, lane 3) but not in the uninfected REF-52 (Fig. 7A, lane 1) nor in the control cells that were infected with the β-galactosidase adenovirus (Fig. 7A, lane 2) was confirmed by Western blotting. To determine the effect of overexpression of the ANK fragment on the complex formation between PINCH, ILK, and CH-ILKBP, we immunoprecipitated the PINCH-ILK-CH-ILKBP complex from lysates of the ANK-expressing cells as well as those of the control cells with monoclonal anti-CH-ILKBP antibody 1D4. Similar amount of ILK (Fig.7C, lanes 3 and 4) was co-precipitated with CH-ILKBP (Fig. 7B, lanes 3 and 4) either in the presence or absence of the ANK fragment, indicating that the interaction between ILK and CH-ILKBP was not altered by the overexpression of the ANK fragment. By contrast, the amount of PINCH associated with ILK was markedly reduced in cells overexpressing the ANK fragment (Fig. 7D, lanes 3 and 4), confirming that overexpression of the ILK N-terminal ANK fragment inhibits the complex formation between PINCH and ILK. To test whether overexpression of the ILK ANK fragment, like that of the PINCH LIM1–2 fragment, also inhibits cell spreading, we plated cells infected with the ANK adenovirus, cells infected with the control β-galactosidase adenovirus, or the uninfected REF-52 cells on vitronectin-coated surfaces. The viral infection efficiency was ∼80–90% under the condition used. Analyses of the cells at different time points after the plating revealed that the spreading of the cells overexpressing the ILK ANK fragment was significantly slower than that of the control cells (Fig. 8,A and B). We next analyzed the migration of cells overexpressing the ILK ANK fragment using the wound assay. The results showed that cells overexpressing the ILK ANK fragment migrated much more slowly than the parental REF-52 and the β-galactosidase vector control cells (Fig. 8,C and D). Taken together, these results indicate that inhibition of the PINCH-ILK interaction, either by overexpression of the PINCH LIM1–2 fragment or by overexpression of the ILK ANK fragment, significantly retards cell spreading and reduces cell motility. In this study, we have shown that PINCH co-localizes with ILK in both focal adhesions and fibrillar adhesions. Furthermore, we have mapped the domains of PINCH that are involved in the localization of PINCH to the cell-matrix contact sites. Our results indicate that the ILK-binding LIM1 domain is required for the localization of PINCH to the cell-matrix contact sites, whereas the C-terminal LIM domains are involved in the modulation of this process. Finally, we have investigated the function of the PINCH-ILK interaction in cell spreading and migration. We have developed two different dominant negative inhibitors of the PINCH-ILK interaction and demonstrated that down-regulation of the PINCH-ILK interaction by overexpression of either inhibitor results in a significant reduction of cell spreading and migration. The results reported in this paper, together with those of previous studies, shed light on the mechanism by which PINCH and ILK localize to cell-matrix contact sites. The finding that the ILK-binding LIM1 domain is indispensable for the localization of PINCH to cell-matrix adhesion sites (Fig. 2) suggests an essential role of ILK in this process. One explanation for this observation is that ILK simply provides a PINCH-docking site at the cell-matrix adhesion sites. However, two pieces of evidence suggest that the PINCH-ILK interaction is not only crucial for the localization of PINCH but also important for the localization of ILK. First, we have found in previous studies that the PINCH-binding ANK repeat is required for the localization of ILK to cell-matrix adhesion sites (13Li F. Zhang Y. Wu C. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4589-4599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, we have observed in this study that overexpression of the PINCH LIM1–2 fragment, which reduced but did not completely eliminate the PINCH-ILK interaction, partially inhibited the localization of ILK to cell-matrix contact sites (Fig. 3). Thus, a more likely possibility is that ILK and PINCH form a complex before reaching the cell-matrix adhesion sites and that the formation of such a complex is a prerequisite for the efficient localization of both proteins. The formation of the PINCH-ILK complex could allow multiple, simultaneous interactions mediated by other domains of PINCH and ILK and therefore promote efficient localization of both proteins to the cell-matrix adhesion sites. This model explains why the PINCH-ILK interaction is crucial for the localization of both PINCH and ILK to the cell-matrix adhesion sites. Furthermore, it implies that there exist other PINCH- and/or ILK-mediated interactions that are important for the localization of both proteins. The C-terminal domain of ILK is capable of interacting with several additional components of the cell-matrix adhesion structures including β1 integrins (12Hannigan G.E. Leung-Hagesteijn C. Fitz-Gibbon L. Coppolino M.G. Radeva G. Filmus J. Bell J.C. Dedhar S. Nature. 1996; 379: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar), CH-ILKBP (21Tu Y. Huang Y. Zhang Z. Hua Y. Wu C. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 585-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), paxillin (15Nikolopoulos S.N. Turner C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23499-23505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), and affixin (31Yamaji S. Suzuki A. Sugiyama Y. Koide Y. Yoshida M. Kanamori H. Mohri H. Ohno S. Ishigatsubo Y. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1251-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Deletion of the C-terminal domain abolished the ability of ILK to localize to cell-matrix adhesion sites (13Li F. Zhang Y. Wu C. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4589-4599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that at least one and, more likely, multiple interactions mediated by this domain are required in this process. Mutations in an ILK C-terminal sequence that is 15–33% identical to the paxillin binding sequences in vinculin, focal adhesion kinase, and actopaxin disrupt the localization of ILK to cell-matrix contact sites, suggesting that the interaction with paxillin is involved in this process (15Nikolopoulos S.N. Turner C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23499-23505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). However, because paxillin is deficient in fibrillar adhesions (5Zamir E.

Leung-Hagesteijn C. Fitz-Gibbon L. Coppolino M.G. Radeva G. Filmus J. Bell J.C. Dedhar S. Nature. 1996; 379: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar, 21Tu Y. Huang Y. Zhang Z. Hua Y. Wu C.

Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). It is worth noting in this regard that CH-ILKBP forms a ternary complex with ILK and PINCH in cells (21Tu Y. Huang Y. Zhang Z. Hua Y. Wu C. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 585-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), and therefore it is attractive to propose that the formation of the PINCH-ILK-CH-ILKBP complex is a crucial step in the localization of these three proteins to cell-matrix contact sites. The notion that PINCH, ILK, and CH-ILKBP assemble into a complex and thereby localize and function interdependently at the cell-matrix adhesion sites is consistent with recent genetic studies in model organisms such as Caenorhabditis elegans showing that lack of PINCH/UNC-97 (36Hobert O. Moerman D.G. Clark K.A. Beckerle M.C. Ruvkun G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 45-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), ILK/PAT-4 (44Mackinnon A.C. Williams B.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 515aGoogle Scholar), or CH-ILKBP/PAT-6 (45Lin X. Williams B.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 515aGoogle Scholar) resulted in an identical defect in the assembly of muscle attachment sites. In addition to the interactions involving ILK, interactions mediated by the PINCH C-terminal LIM domains likely also contribute to the localization of PINCH, and consequently ILK and CH-ILKBP, to cell-matrix contact sites. Deletion of the LIM3–5 domains greatly impairs the ability of PINCH to localize to cell-matrix contact sites. Deletion of the LIM5 domain also decreased, although to a lesser extent, the efficiency of the localization of PINCH to cell-matrix contact sites. Because the LIM1-containing PINCH N-terminal fragments bind efficiently to ILK (Figs. 2 and 3), the impairment in the localization of the PINCH C-terminal deletion mutants is likely caused by the loss of interactions mediated by the C-terminal LIM domains. It is interesting to note that one of the C-terminal domains, LIM4, interacts with Nck-2 (also known as Nckβ (37Chen M. She H. Davis E.M. Spicer C.M. Kim L. Ren R. Le Beau M.M. Li W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25171-25178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) or Grb4 (38Braverman L.E. Quilliam L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5542-5549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar)), a Src homology 2 domain- and Src homology 3 domain-containing adaptor protein (39Tu Y. Li F. Wu C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3367-3382Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Because Nck-2 is present in the cell-matrix contact sites in spreading cells, 2S. M. Goicoechea and C. Wu, unpublished observations. it could represent one of the interactions mediated by the PINCH C-terminal domains that are involved in the localization of PINCH to these sites. The observation that deletion of LIM3–4 further reduces the efficiency of the localization to cell-matrix contact sites (compare Fig.2E with Figs. 3, C–G) provides evidence supporting, albeit not proving, this possibility. Clearly, future studies are required to test this possibility and to identify other interactions that are involved in this process. Cell migration is a complex process that is critically involved in embryonic development and many physiological and pathological processes including injury repair, inflammation, and metastasis. Using two different dominant negative inhibitors of the PINCH-ILK interaction, we have demonstrated in this study that PINCH, through its interaction with ILK, plays an important role in the regulation of cell migration. Because cell migration requires coordinated changes of cell shape and inhibition of the PINCH-ILK interaction impairs this process, the defect in cell migration is most likely caused by, at least in part, the disregulation of cell shape change. At the molecular level, this could reflect a need for the PINCH-ILK interaction in physically connecting the transmembrane receptors such as integrins to the actin cytoskeleton. Additionally, PINCH could participate in other events that are critical for cell migration. For example, PINCH, through interactions mediated by Nck-2, could potentially bring proteins that are involved in the actin polymerization into proximity of the cell-matrix adhesion sites and therefore promote cell migration. Nck-2 is known to interact with p21-activated kinase and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (37Chen M. She H. Davis E.M. Spicer C.M. Kim L. Ren R. Le Beau M.M. Li W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25171-25178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 38Braverman L.E. Quilliam L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5542-5549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), proteins that are directly involved in the regulation of actin polymerization. Although a direct role for Nck-2 in the regulation of actin polymerization remains to be tested, it has recently been shown that Nck-1/Nckα, which is structurally closely related to Nck-2, cooperates with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bishposphate to dramatically activate neural-Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein/Arp2/3-mediated actin nucleation (40Rohatgi R.

Additional Nck-2-binding proteins include DOCK180 (41Tu Y. Kucik D.F. Wu C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 491: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), a Rac-activating protein that is involved in the regulation of membrane ruffling and cell migration (42Kiyokawa E.

Structures are available for polymerases without DNA, with DNA bound, and with either a very short initial transcript or with longer transcripts, corresponding to elongation. Lacking in any system, however, is x-ray structural information on the critical transition from an unstable initially transcribing complex (ITC)1to a stable elongation complex. This transition occurs at about 10 base pairs (bp) in all RNA polymerases, suggesting that the transition is a fundamental feature of transcription, independent of the specific system (8Ebright R.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 687-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). What is the nature of the transcription bubble at this critical, early transition point? For the single-subunit RNA polymerase from T7, a crystal structure is available with a 3-base RNA transcript at the active site (7Cheetham G.M. Steitz T.A. Science. 1999; 286: 2305-2309Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Modeling from that structure, Cheetham and Steitz (7Cheetham G.M. Steitz T.A. Science. 1999; 286: 2305-2309Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) predicted that as the polymerase transcribes forward, the enzyme could accommodate no more than a 3-base heteroduplex. Recent results have shown, however, that in a stably elongating complex stalled clear of the promoter, near position +15, the transcription bubble extends about 8–9 bp upstream of the stall site, consistent with a heteroduplex size of ∼8 bp (9Huang J. Sousa R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 10Temiakov D. Mentesana P.E. Ma K. Mustaev A. Borukhov S. McAllister W.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cross-linking studies report that in a complex stalled at position +23, RNA at position −9 relative to the stall site cross-links to RNA polymerase but not to DNA, whereas RNA at positions closer to the last incorporated base cross-links to DNA, again consistent with an 8-bp heteroduplex (10Temiakov D. Mentesana P.E. Ma K. Mustaev A. Borukhov S. McAllister W.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14109-14114Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Footprinting studies have indicated that complexes stalled at position +6 retain promoter occupancy, as in the crystal structure, but complexes stalled at position +15 have cleared the promoter (9Huang J. Sousa R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 12Ikeda R.A. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It is reasonable to expect a substantial difference in these structures; perhaps the initially transcribing complex has different structural constraints. We have previously used fluorescent base analogs to map DNA melting in both the initial promoter-bound complex and in a stably elongating complex (beyond the transition) in the model enzyme T7 RNA polymerase (11Liu C. Martin C.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 13Újvári A. Martin C.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14574-14582Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The details of the model for the initial melted complex derived from the early fluorescence study have been confirmed by recent crystal structures (6Cheetham G.M. Jeruzalmi D. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), and the results from the latter are consistent with biochemical probes of a similarly stalled elongation complex (9Huang J. Sousa R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In the current work, we turn this approach toward mapping the collapse of the initially melted, untranscribed region of the DNA and the initial peeling away of the RNA from the heteroduplex as the ITC progresses through and beyond position +10. The new finding that pyrrolo-dC in a mismatch context has typical fluorescence values higher than that of the same probe in single-stranded DNA (which, in turn, has higher fluorescence than in double-stranded DNA), coupled with the fact that fluorescence is quenched in a heteroduplex, now allows us to probe not only the melted state of the DNA but also for the presence of a heteroduplex. The results present a detailed structural picture of promoter clearance in the T7 RNA polymerase model system. T7 RNA polymerase was prepared fromEscherichia coli strain BL21, carrying the overproducing plasmid pAR1219 (kindly supplied by F. W. Studier), in which RNA polymerase is expressed under inducible control of the lacUV5 promoter (14Davanloo P. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Studier F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2035-2039Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). The enzyme was purified, and the concentration was determined (ε280 = 1.4 × 105m/cm) as described previously (15King G.C. Martin C.T. Pham T.T. Coleman J.E. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Purity of the enzyme (>95%) was verified by SDS-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by the phosphoramidite method on an Expedite 8909 DNA/RNA synthesizer. The standard phosphoramidites were purchased from CPG Inc. The fluorescent cytosine analog pyrrolo-dC was incorporated into oligonucleotides using furano-dT phosphoramidite (Glen Research Corp.) as described previously (11Liu C. Martin C.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Single strands were purified using an Amberchrom CG-16C reverse phase resin as described (16Schick C. Martin C.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4275-4280Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Purity of the single-stranded oligonucleotides was confirmed by denaturing (urea) gel electrophoresis of 5′ end-labeled single strands. Double-stranded templates were prepared by heating a 1:1 mixture of complementary single strands in Tris-EDTA buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 1 mm EDTA) at 75 °C for 5 min. The samples were then allowed to cool slowly to room temperature. The constructs were either used immediately or stored at −20 °C. Fluorescence measurements were carried out with a Photon Technology International L-format fluorimeter with a 75-watt arc lamp and both emission and excitation monochrometers using a 75-μl (light path, 3 × 3 mm; center, 15 mm) ultramicro cell (Hellma). Fluorescence emission from pyrrolo-dC was detected at 460 nm, with excitation at 350 nm; slits on both channels were set to 5 nm. Fluorescence from 2-aminopurine was obtained similarly but with excitation at 315 nm and emission detected at 370 nm. For measurements of fluorescence from 2-aminopurine, fluorescence is reported after subtraction of the enzyme background. All fluorescence experiments were carried out in fluorescence buffer: 30 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 15 mm magnesium acetate, 25 mm potassium glutamate, 0.25 mm EDTA, and 0.05% Tween 20 (Calbiochem; 10% protein grade) in a sample compartment thermostated at 25 °C. The fluorescence changes recorded in all experiments represent an average of three measurements. In the chase experiments, the fluorescence from double-stranded DNA (1.0 μm) was first recorded alone and then after the addition of each of the following: enzyme (to ∼1.0 μm final concentration), GTP and ATP, 3′-dCTP (or CTP), and UTP (to 1000 μm each), with each addition occurring at 3-min intervals. For samples with two fluorophores, the same protocol was followed, except that during the measurement, the monochrometers were switched, under computer control, alternately between the excitation and emission pairs above. Transcription reactions were carried out in the above fluorescence buffer at 25 °C in a volume of 20 μl containing nucleoside triphosphates as described below and [α-32P]GTP (specific activity, 800 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Reactions were stopped by the addition of an equal volume of quenching solution (95% formaldehyde, 50 mmEDTA, 0.01% bromphenol blue, 0.01% xylene cyanol). The enzyme and DNA (1.0 μm each) were incubated in transcription buffer (lacking nucleoside triphosphates) for 4 min at room temperature and then divided into two equivalent fractions. GTP and ATP (including [α-32P]GTP) were added to the first fraction, which was then incubated for 3 min at room temperature and quenched. The second fraction was similarly incubated with GTP and ATP for 3 min, and then 3′-dCTP was added to a final concentration of 1000 μm. This was then incubated for 3 min and quenched. All transcription samples were heated to 95 °C for 2 min and loaded onto 20% polyacrylamide-6 m urea gels. After electrophoresis, gels were dried and quantified using a Molecular Dynamics Storm 840 PhosphorImager. In the initial formation of the open complex, base pairs at positions −4 through +3 are melted open (6Cheetham G.M. Jeruzalmi D. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 13Újvári A. Martin C.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14574-14582Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). As the polymerase translocates through to position +3, the upstream edge (position −4) of this initial bubble remains open (7Cheetham G.M. Steitz T.A. Science. 1999; 286: 2305-2309Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). However, translocation to position +15 results in the closure of the initial bubble and the loss of promoter contacts (11Liu C. Martin C.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 12Ikeda R.A. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3614-3618Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In a complex stalled at position +15, the heteroduplex extends ∼8 bp upstream of the last base incorporated (9Huang J. Sousa R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 10Temiakov D. Mentesana P.E. Ma K. Mustaev A. Borukhov S. McAllister W.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Between these two states, the RNA polymerase must clear the promoter and become a stable elongation complex. At what point between positions +3 and +15 does the initial bubble collapse? At what point does the RNA begin to peel away from the heteroduplex? Fluorescence from base analogs placed site-specifically within the DNA reports on the melted state near the analog. To monitor fluorescence changes at specific positions as the RNA polymerase translocates along the template DNA, DNA constructs (summarized in TableI) were prepared, which allow walking of the RNA polymerase to positions +7–12 in the presence of only GTP and ATP as substrates. Subsequent addition of 3′-dCTP allows further translocation by only 1 base pair, to positions +8–13, ensuring that misincorporation does not lead to heterogeneity in the stalled complexes. In some experiments below, subsequent addition of UTP allows binding of the next substrate nucleotide (and translocation by 1 more base), but without covalent bond formation.Table ISequences of DNA constructs used throughout this studyNomenclatureDNA sequence downstream of position −52AP−2TGA (7)…TATAGGGAGAGCTTACGGTTATCTAGATC…ATATCCCTCTCGAATGCCAATAGATCTAG2AP−2TGA (8)…TATAGGGAGAGGCTTCGGTTATCTAGATC…ATATCCCTCTCCGAAGCCAATAGATCTAG2AP−2TGA (9)…TATAGGGAGAGAGCTTCGTTATCTAGATC…ATATCCCTCTCTCGAAGCAATAGATCTAG2AP−2TGA (10)…TATAGGGAGAGGAGCTTCTTATCTAGATC…ATATCCCTCTCCTCGAAGAATAGATCTAGpyC+1TGA (10)…TATAGGGAGAGGAGCTTCTATCCTAGATC…ATATCCCTCTCCTCGAAGATAGGATCTAGpyC+1TGA (11)…TATAGGGAGAAGGAGCTTCTATCTAGATC…ATATCCCTCTTCCTCGAAGATAGATCTAGpyC+2TGA (10)…TATAGGGAGAGGAGCTTCTATCCTAGATC…ATATCCCTCTCCTCGAAGATAGGATCTAGpyC+2TGA (11)…TATAGGGAGAAGGAGCTTCTATCTAGATC…ATATCCCTCTTCCTCGAAGATAGATCTAGm-pyC+1TGA (10)…TATAAGGAGAGGAGCTTCTATCCTAGATC…ATATCCCTCTCCTCGAAGATAGGATCTAGm-pyC+1TGA (11)…TATAAGGAGAAGGAGCTTCTATCTAGATC…ATATCCCTCTTCCTCGAAGATAGATCTAGm-pyC+1TGA (12)…TATAAGGAGAGAGGAGCTTCTACTAGATC…ATATCCCTCTCTCCTCGAAGATGATCTAGm-pyC+2TGA (10)…TATAGAGAGAGGAGCTTCTATCCTAGATC…ATATCCCTCTCCTCGAAGATAGGATCTAGm-pyC+2TGA (11)…TATAGAGAGAAGGAGCTTCTATCTAGATC…ATATCCCTCTTCCTCGAAGATAGATCTAGm-pyC+2TGA (12)…TATAGAGAGAGAGGAGCTTCTACTAGATC…ATATCCCTCTCTCCTCGAAGATGATCTAGpyC+11NGA (10)…TATAGGAAGGGAGGCGGAGTTTACTCATC…ATATCCTTCCCTCCGCCTCAAATGAGTAGpyC+13TGA (10)…TATAGGAAGGGAGGCGGAGTTTACTCATC…ATATCCTTCCCTCCGCCTCAAATGAGTAG2AP−2TpyC+8NGA (7)…TATAGGGAGAGCTTACGGTTATCTAGATC…ATATCCCTCTCGAATGCCAATAGATCTAG2AP−2TpyC+9NGA (8)…TATAGGGAGAGGCTTCGGTTATCTAGATC…ATATCCCTCTCCGAAGCCAATAGATCTAG2AP−2TpyC+10NGA (9)…TATAGGGAGAGAGCTTCGTTATCTAGATC…ATATCCCTCTCTCGAAGCAATAGATCTAGAll constructs contained the duplex promoter (nontemplate) consensus sequence TAATACGACTCAC from positions −17 through −5.

The DNA sequence TATA at positions −4 through −1 of the promoter is melted in the initial open complex (6Cheetham G.M. Jeruzalmi D. Steitz T.A.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14574-14582Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Placement of 2-aminopurine at position −2 of the template strand provides a probe of the melted state of this region, as shown in earlier studies (13Újvári A. Martin C.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14574-14582Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 17Jia Y. Kumar A. Patel S. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 14075-14082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). A set of data showing closing of the bubble is presented in Fig.1. Different DNA constructs were prepared, which in the presence of GTP and ATP allow the steady-state accumulation of complexes stalled at various positions (indicated by the upper member of each pair of numbers along the y axis). Subsequent addition of 3′dCTP allows translocation by one nucleotide (as indicated by the lower number of each pair). The results show clearly that in complexes translocated to position +7 or +8, the initially melted region (positions −2 and −1) remains melted, as evidenced by the high fluorescence relative to the double-stranded control. In complexes stalled at position +9, on each of two different constructs, the fluorescence is intermediate between that of double- and single-stranded DNA. Finally, on translocation to position +10, the fluorescence is close to that of the fully double-stranded control. The latter result shows that by position +10, the TATA region, as represented by probes at positions −2 and −1, has collapsed. In contrast, on translocation up to position +8, the initially melted region remains melted, consistent with the retention of promoter contacts. Looking more carefully at the transition itself, these data are consistent with one of three, more detailed, models. In one model, on translocation to position +9, the complexes are homogeneous, but the stacking interactions at position −2 have been altered to yield an intermediate level of fluorescence. In a clearly distinct model, on translocation to position +9, the initially melted region collapses fully in ∼40–50% of the complexes, with near complete collapse occurring on translocation to position +10. A third model suggests that on stalling at position +9, there is a distribution of translocational complexes. In this most likely scenario, the complexes are distributed between those that have incorporated the base at +9 but have not moved forward and those that have moved forward to expose the elongating base in the template strand. In this scenario, collapse of the bubble would occur on translocation to position +10. A potential issue in these types of studies involves the fact that walked complexes can undergo turnover (returning to the initial promoter positioning) during the measurement, such that steady-state measurements under any given set of substrates will yield a distribution of complexes, including complexes poised for initiation (19Mentesana P.E. Chin-Bow S.T. Sousa R. McAllister W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 1049-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It is important to note that the time scale of the fluorescence measurement (nanoseconds) is much faster than potential translocational events, such that this approach provides an accurate measurement of any such distribution. Direct fluorescence measurements can easily be carried out within 3–4 min of addition of the substrate NTPs, limiting overall turnover (11Liu C. Martin C.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). To assess the extent of turnover within this time frame, steady-state measurements of RNA synthesis were made under conditions identical to the fluorescence studies. The results, summarized in Table II, show that turnover (maximally 1 min–1 for complexes stalled at position +7) is slower than the rate of initiation, providing evidence that the expected stalled complex should be the predominant species in the fluorescence measurements. These results also demonstrate that, as expected, the turnover rate steadily decreases with increasing position of the stall. Given that the sequence context at the stall site, as well as the initial few bases of the transcript, remain constant across these constructs, these results also demonstrate that the inherent stability of the ITC increases steadily as the enzyme translocates from position +7 to +10.Table IICharacterization of turnover on templates encoding different length RNAs under conditions that mimic the fluorescence measurementsDNA constructnGAGA [Rn]GA + 3′-dC[Rn][Rn + 1]μm2AP−2TGA(7)+72.05.01.22AP−2TGA(8)+81.71.21.82AP−2TGA(9)+91.00.40.82AP−2TGA(10)+100.80.150.9As described under “Materials and Methods,” 1.0 μmpolymerase and 1.0 μm double-stranded promoter were allowed to react for 3 min at 25° C in the presence of 1000 μm GTP, 1000 μm ATP, and [32P]GTP, conditions that mimic those in the fluorescence measurement.

Construct nomenclature is that of Table 1. Our previous study of an elongation complex stalled at position +15 showed that the downstream edge of the melted bubble lies very close to the last incorporated base (11Liu C. Martin C.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). We now ask whether this is true in complexes that have just cleared the promoter (as evidenced by collapse of the upstream TATA bubble). The data in Fig. 1 follow fluorescence from probes near the start site, in complexes stalled 7–11 nucleotides downstream. In these same stalled complexes, we can use fluorescence from probes placed just downstream of the stall site. The results presented in Fig. 2A show that in complexes stalled at position +10, fluorescence from a probe placed at position +11 on the nontemplate strand increases slightly, indicating only minor melting at this position just 1 base downstream of the stall site. Walking these complexes forward to position +15, to place the probe fully within the expected bubble (position −5 relative to the stall site), yields an increase in fluorescence to single-stranded levels, consistent with full opening. In a complementary experiment presented in Fig. 2B, placing the label in the template strand at position +13 and walking to position +10 yields no increase in fluorescence, consistent with the retention of duplex DNA downstream. Interestingly, walking this stalled complex to position +15 also results in no increase in fluorescence. In this case, the DNA must be melted, but the probe in the template strand is now in an RNA-DNA heteroduplex. One cannot, from the above, rule out the possibility that some stalled complexes, at position +8, for example, might transiently backtrack to the promoter, thus yielding a distribution of products at steady state. In other words, the actual footprint of an individual enzyme on the DNA might be smaller than implied by the data in Fig. 1 but reflect a steady-state scenario in which some complexes are situated at the promoter with their −2 base pairs open and their +8 base pairs closed, whereas others are situated at the +8 stall site, with their −2 bases closed and their +8 bases open. One might also worry that the introduction of base analogs in two separate constructs results in different behavior for the two constructs. To address these concerns quantitatively, we prepared a series of DNA constructs in which 2-aminopurine was placed at position −2 of the template strand, whereas pyrrolo-dC was simultaneously placed immediately downstream of the stall site on the nontemplate strand. Excitation at 315 nm with observation at 370 nm yielded a signal from 2-aminopurine, whereas excitation at 350 nm with observation at 460 nm yielded a signal from pyrrolo-dC (in all cases, no evidence of energy transfer from 2-aminopurine to pyrrolo-dC was observed). As shown in Fig. 3, a steady decrease in fluorescence from 2-aminopurine placed at position −2 of the template strand is observed in translocation from position +8 to +10, as was seen in Fig. 1. The magnitude of the change relative to the controls is consistent with an overwhelming majority of the complexes transiting from fully open to fully closed. At the same time, in constructs stalled with ATP and GTP only, the fluorescence from pyrrolo-dC at a position 1 base downstream of the initial stall site is less than, but close to, single-stranded levels, consistent with melting of the DNA 1 base pair downstream of the stall site in at least 50% of the complexes. This signal increases only slightly with the addition of 3′dCTP and negligibly with subsequent addition of UTP. This level of fluorescence is likely the true measure of a fully melted (at the stall site) complex, such that close to 100% of the complexes are stalled as anticipated. Thus, under conditions designed to stall transcription at position +8, the majority of the complexes have melted DNA at positions −2 and +8, inconsistent with transient sliding of a (smaller) fixed length bubble. The changes in fluorescence intensity observed in 2-aminopurine are thought to arise from changes in the stacking interactions surrounding the fluorophore (20Nordlund T.M. Xu D. Evans K.O. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12090-12095Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 21Xu D.G. Nordlund T.M. Biophys.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 946-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). In duplex DNA, the bases are well stacked, providing for efficient quenching of fluorescence. In contrast, in single-stranded DNA, stacking is still present but is presumably less well ordered. These results have been used to probe melted regions within DNA, both for 2-aminopurine and, more recently, for pyrrolo-dC (11Liu C. Martin C.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 13Újvári A. Martin C.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14574-14582Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 17Jia Y. Kumar A.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8005-8012Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The results shown in Fig. 4 demonstrate that the fluorescence of pyrrolo-dC in an engineered mismatched setting (opposite adenine) is higher than that of the same probe in single stranded DNA. Presumably, the mismatch imposes constraints on stacking not present in the single strand. This result can be used to our advantage in assessing the state of the bubble and of the heteroduplex. Correct pairing of the probe pyrrolo-dC in the template strand opposite guanine in the original DNA duplex, should give low fluorescence when the probe is in either a DNA:DNA duplex or in an RNA:DNA heteroduplex. Fluorescence will be high only when the template strand is in a single stranded environment. Construction of an identical DNA construct, with the exception that pyrrolo-dC is mispaired opposite adenine, provides complementary data. In this case, fluorescence will be low in the (correctly paired) RNA:DNA heteroduplex, but formation of the (mispaired) DNA:DNA duplex should show fluorescence intensities higher than that of the same probe in single (or double)-stranded DNA. To determine at what point the 5′ end of the RNA initially separates from the heteroduplex and the DNA reanneals, we placed fluorescent base analogs at positions +1 and +2, either correctly paired opposite guanine or mispaired with adenine in the nontemplate strand. The results presented in Fig.5, A and C, suggest that with one possible exception, probes placed at position +1 or +2 of the template strand remain in a duplex environment as the polymerase translocates from positions +10–12. The fluorescence is close to that of the control DNA duplex and significantly lower than that of the single-stranded DNA. However, these results cannot distinguish between a DNA-DNA or an RNA-DNA duplex. The data in Fig. 5, B and D, provide this distinction. In this case, the “duplex” control contains pyrrolo-dC in a mismatched environment, opposite adenine. In complexes stalled at position +10, fluorescence from probes placed at positions +1 and +2 is significantly lower than that of the duplex control, consistent with the presence of the heteroduplex at those positions. As the complex progresses to position +11, the fluorescence from a probe at position +1 increases, whereas that from a probe at position +2 remains constant. Progression to position +12 leads to high fluorescence from both probes (although the extent varies depending on how the complexes are walked to position +12, again suggesting some distribution of translocational complexes), consistent with the reannealing of the duplex, to provide a mismatched environment at the fluorophore. All RNA polymerases show a transition from an abortive cycling phase to a more stable elongation phase at ∼10 base pairs, a region midway between the initial promoter-bound complex and an elongation complex stalled clear of the promoter (24Uptain S.M. Kane C.M. Chamberlin M.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 117-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Understanding this transition is critical to understanding both the fundamental machinery of transcription and the various regulatory processes that exploit this phenomenon. That the transition occurs at about the same position in both the multisubunit eukaryotic and prokaryotic polymerases and in the much smaller single-subunit RNA polymerase from T7 suggests a fundamental mechanism inherent to transcription. Fluorescent base analogs provide a relatively nonperturbing probe of local structural changes in the DNA, which accompany protein binding (21Xu D.G. Nordlund T.M. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1042-1058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 22Rachofsky E.L. Osman R. Ross J.B.

Martin, unpublished results. to expand the repertoire of sequences that can be studied to map the melted bubble in elongation complexes stalled at position +15, clear of the promoter (11Liu C.

The quenching of the fluorescence of base analogs in DNA is thought to arise primarily from neighbor stacking interactions (22Rachofsky E.L. Osman R. Ross J.B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 946-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Such interactions are substantial in single-stranded DNA but increase significantly in the more ordered environment of a DNA duplex. The results presented here show that quenching is similarly higher in an RNA-DNA heteroduplex relative to the control single-stranded DNA. This is useful for probing template strand involvement in a hybrid but presents a problem in that one cannot readily distinguish an RNA-DNA duplex from a DNA-DNA duplex. The new observation that quenching is generally less in an otherwise duplex mismatch than it is in single-stranded DNA presents a tool to allow one to distinguish between an RNA-DNA duplex and a reannealed homoduplex. In the case of the placement of the fluorescent base analog in the template strand opposite a correctly matched base in the nontemplate strand, low fluorescence indicates the presence of either a homo- or a heteroduplex. For a parallel experiment in which the base analog in the template strand is mismatched to an incorrect base in the nontemplate strand, low fluorescence can arise only from a (correctly paired) heteroduplex. The result that quenching in a mismatched but otherwise duplex environment is less than that in single-stranded DNA is consistent with thoughts about the structures of mismatched DNA. Combined with parallel measurements in a correctly paired construct, this approach provides a powerful tool to probe for the presence of a local heteroduplex in a transcription bubble. Using both 2-aminopurine and pyrrolo-dC placed individually at specific positions along the DNA, we now present a thorough study following the transition of the initially elongating complex. In separate experiments, probes were monitored at various positions from −2 to +13. The data are summarized in Fig.6. As summarized pictorially in Fig. 6, the initially melted bubble (as reported by probes at positions −2 and −1 on the template and nontemplate strands, respectively) remains single-stranded through translocation to position +8. As the complex translocates through position +9 to position +10, the initially melted upstream edge of the bubble reanneals. This indicates that a maximal bubble size of 10–12 nucleotides is reached on translocation to position +8. The collapse of the bubble at this point suggests a dramatic reorganization of the DNA on the protein. Retention of the upstream specificity contacts (Fig. 6,yellow) as the TATA region (−4 to −1) resumes a duplex topology would further strain the template strand connectivity. Thus we predict that promoter contacts are lost on translocation beyond position +8. Through translocation to position +10, beyond the point at which the initial bubble has collapsed, probes placed in the template strand at positions +1 and +2 remain in a heteroduplex, indicating that RNA is bound to DNA all the way back to its 5′ end (the RNA has not yet begun to dissociate). As the complex progresses to position +11, the RNA at position −1 (the 5′ end) begins to peel away. On translocation to position +12, the RNA base at position +2 relative to the start site dissociates (position +2 is no a longer heteroduplex), and the template strand base at position +1 returns to a DNA-DNA duplex. These results suggest a smooth and sequential peeling off of the RNA and indicate that the DNA bubble collapses very close behind the exiting RNA, consistent with maintaining optimal melting energetics. At this point, the heteroduplex is expected to be ∼10 base pairs in length (which, with data to date, appears to be an upper limit for the size of the heteroduplex). Interestingly, similar probes of complexes stalled near position +15 suggest a maximal heteroduplex length of 8 (9Huang J. Sousa R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 11Liu C. Martin C.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), suggesting a minor transition in the nature of the bubble between translocational positions +11 and +15. The introduction of a mismatched base pair at position +1 or +2 raises the possibility that the peeling away of the 5′ end of the RNA, if driven by reannealing of the DNA duplex, might occur later (at a slightly longer length of heteroduplex) in these constructs than in normal transcription. Preliminary results 3C. Liu and C. T. Martin, unpublished results. indicate a similar peeling away on constructs completely lacking the nontemplate strand, suggesting that heteroduplex length is limited by other factors. These results for the single-subunit T7 RNA polymerase are consistent with those from some recent studies of the more complex multisubunit enzymes. The elongation complexes of bothE. coli RNA polymerase and yeast Pol II are thought to contain a 8–9-bp hybrid, with the bubble melted only slightly ahead of the stalled complex (2Gnatt A.L.

These proteins arise from covalent dimerization of two PDGF subunits, designated the A-chain and B-chain, yielding the heterodimer PDGF-AB and two homodimers, PDGF-AA and PDGF-BB (1Ostman A. Rall L.

PDGF was implicated in tumorigenesis following the discovery of high sequence homology between the PDGF B-chain (PDGF-B) and the viral oncogene, v-sis (for a review, see Ref. 3Silver B.J. BioFactors. 1992; 86: 217-227Google Scholar). Other studies suggest that both PDGF-A and PDGF-B may also mediate tumor progression to the metastatic phenotype (4Potapova O. Fakhrai H. Baird S. Mercola D. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 280-286Google Scholar, 5Anan K. Morisaki T. Katano M. Ikubo A. Kitsuki H. Uchiyama A. Kuroki S. Tanaka M. Torisu M. Surgery. 1996; 119: 333-339Google Scholar). Transcription of the PDGF-A gene is regulated by several enhancer and silencer elements that are poly-purine/pyrimidine-rich and possess a high degree of single-stranded, non-B DNA structure. Other laboratories (6Lin X. Wang Z. Gu L. Deuel T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25614-25619Google Scholar, 7Khachigian L.M. Williams A.J. Collins T. J. Biol.

This activity is mediated by the binding of members of the Sp1 family of transcription factors and can be induced in vascular endothelial cells by phorbol ester treatment through displacement of Sp1 and Sp3 by the early growth response factor Egr-1 (7Khachigian L.M.

Chem. 1992; 267: 21999-22002Google Scholar). More recently, we localized a GC-rich, nuclease-hypersensitive silencer element in a more 5′-distal region of the PDGF-A promoter (−1488 to −1388), which we designated the 5′-S1 nuclease-hypersensitive silencer or 5′-SHS, that represses transcription in a variety of normal and transformed cell lines (11Liu B. Maul R.S. Kaetzel Jr., D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26281-26290Google Scholar). The noncoding (pyrimidine-rich) strand of the 5′-SHS has been shown by Southwestern blot analysis to bind specifically to proteins ofMr 97,000, 87,000, 44,000, and 17,000, and binding of these proteins is well correlated with silencer function. The current study was undertaken to identify these 5′-SHS binding proteins and better characterize their potential transcriptional functions. To that end, a HeLa cell cDNA expression library was screened with a radiolabeled probe derived from the pyrimidine-rich strand of the 5′-SHS. This approach yielded multiple cDNA clones, each encoding the 17-kDa protein, NM23-H1. The nm23-H1 gene belongs to a family of which eight human members have been identified to date (reviewed in Ref. 12Lacombe M.-L. Milon L. Mehus J.G. Lambeth D.O. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2000; 32: 247-258Google Scholar), including nm23-H1,nm23-H2, DR-nm23, nm23-H4, andnm23-H5. These genes appear to play critical roles in cellular proliferation (13Hailat N. Keim D.R.

All NM23 proteins possess nucleoside diphosphate kinase activities, which direct the transfer of γ-phosphates between nucleoside triphosphates and diphosphates (22Agarwal R.P. Robinson B. Parks R.E. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 51: 376-386Google Scholar). In addition, NM23-H2 was shown to be identical to PuF, a transcriptional activator of the c-myc protooncogene that binds to the nuclease-hypersensitive element of the c-myc promoter (c-myc NHE) (23Postel E.H. Berberich S.J. Flint S.J. Ferrone C.A. Science. 1993; 261: 478-480Google Scholar). NM23-H2/PuF has recently been identified as an activator of several genes required for early myeloid differentiation through recognition of c-myc NHE-like elements (24Postel E. Berberich S.J. Rooney J.W. Kaetzel D.M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2000; 32: 277-284Google Scholar). However, no DNA binding or transcriptional function has yet been ascribed to NM23-H1. In the current study, we find that NM23-H1 recognizes both the 5′-SHS silencer and the NHE basal promoter element of the PDGF-A gene as substrates for DNA cleavage, directing its activity to the 3′-portions of the individual strands of these nuclease-hypersensitive elements. Interestingly, NM23-H2 also cleaves both elements, but its activity is directed to their respective 5′-terminal regions. NM23-H1 and NM23-H2 also repress transcriptional activity of the PDGF-A promoter via functional interactions with both elements, suggesting a potentially important role for these proteins in dampening expression of an oncogenic and metastasis-promoting growth factor. A HeLa S3 cDNA expression library constructed in the expression vector Uni-Zap XR (Stratagene) was employed for DNA recognition site cloning. An oligodeoxyribonucleotide corresponding to the noncoding strand of the 5′-SHS silencer element was end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol), purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and used for screening of protein replica filters as described (25Singh H. LeBowitz A.S. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Sharp P. Cell. 1988; 52: 415-423Google Scholar). Clones (5 × 105) were screened on 150-mm plates containing 0.7% agarose at a density of 5 × 104 plaque-forming units/plate. Three to four cycles of limiting dilution and screening were conducted to obtain purified plaques containing cDNAs of interest. cDNA inserts were sequenced by the Sequenase procedure (U.S. Biochemicals, Inc.). Recombinant NM23-H1 and NM23-H2 were expressed underlacZ induction in the Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) using the vector pET3C (Novogen). Both proteins were purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation (60–90% fraction) and chromatography over anion exchange (DEAE-Sephacel) and hydroxylapatite (HTP; Bio-Rad) columns, as described (23Postel E.H. Berberich S.J. Flint S.J. Ferrone C.A. Science. 1993; 261: 478-480Google Scholar, 26Postel E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22821-22829Google Scholar). NM23-H1 bound to the DEAE column (25 ml; 5.4 × 2.4 cm) under low salt conditions and eluted at ∼100 mm NaCl in a gradient of 0–400 mm NaCl. NM23-H2 did not bind to the DEAE-Sephacel column and was collected in the fall-through fraction. NM23-H1 and NM23-H2 were applied to HTP columns (12 ml; 6.5 × 1.5 cm) and eluted with a 60-ml gradient of 10–400 mm potassium phosphate. The peak of NM23-H1 was found at ∼150 mm phosphate, whereas NM23-H2 was eluted much later in the gradient (peak, ∼350 mm). NM23-H1 obtained from the most enriched HTP fraction was employed for further analysis. NM23-H1 and NM23-H2 prepared by this procedure was >95% pure. DNA cleavage assays and mapping of DNA cleavage sites were performed as described (26Postel E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22821-22829Google Scholar), using 10–50 fmol of 32P-labeled oligodeoxyribonucleotide/15 μl of incubation mixture. To promote DNA cleavage activities of the NM23 proteins, 2.7 mm Mg2+ and 27 mm KCl were included in the incubation buffer. Double-stranded probes were prepared as indicated in the text by either (a) radiolabeling at both 5′-termini after annealing or (b) radiolabeling the strand of interest followed by annealing to the unlabeled opposite strand. Annealing of single-stranded oligodeoxyribonucleotides into double-stranded forms was performed by denaturation of individual strands for 2 min at 94 °C, followed by a gradual decrease to 23 °C over a 4-h time span. Protein-DNA complexes, radiolabeled probes, and cleavage products were resolved by electrophoresis through 6% polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× TBE buffer (45 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3, 1 mm EDTA), whereas mapping of DNA cleavage products was performed on denaturing 16% sequencing gels. Sequencing ladders were generated by established procedures (27Maxam A. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Google Scholar). Radiolabeled bands were visualized with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The nucleotide sequences of oligodeoxyribonucleotides employed (only sense strand sequences are shown) were: 5′-SHS, 5′-CTAGAGACGTGGGGAGGGGGCCTGCAGGTGTGT-3′; and PDGF-A NHE, 5′-CTAGAGGGGGCGGGGGCGGGGGCGGGGGAGGGG T-3′. HepG2 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Construction of plasmids pAC1800, pAC880, pAC261, pAC-F11, pAC-F47, 5′-SHS+/pAC261 (8Kaetzel Jr., D.M. Maul R.S. Liu B.

To construct the NM23-H1 expression plasmid pL2-H1, a 700-bp EcoRI-KpnI cDNA fragment containing the full coding sequence of NM23-H1 was excised from pBluescript SK− (HeLa λ-ZAP clone 2-1) and inserted into theEcoRI site of pL2. The NM23-H2 expression plasmid pL3-H2 was constructed by insertion of a 650-bpEcoRI/HindIII NM23-H2 cDNA fragment from pSPORT (Invitrogen) into the corresponding site in pL3. Expression of both proteins was driven by the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter/enhancer. The cells were transfected in 60-mm dishes by the calcium phosphate/DNA co-precipitation method (29Graham F.L. Van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Google Scholar). The precipitates were prepared using 2 μg of promoter/CAT reporter plasmid, 4 μg of NM23 expression plasmid, and 2 μg of the β-galactosidase-expressing plasmid pCMVβ. CAT and β-galactosidase assays were performed as described (11Liu B. Maul R.S. Kaetzel Jr., D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26281-26290Google Scholar). Our previous studies indicated that the noncoding, pyrimidine-rich strand of the 5′-SHS silencer element (5′-SHS Py) bound to a number of proteins with specificity for single-stranded DNA and that binding by those proteins appeared to mediate silencer function (11Liu B. Maul R.S. Kaetzel Jr., D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26281-26290Google Scholar). To identify those proteins, the method of DNA recognition site screening described by Singh et al. (25Singh H. LeBowitz A.S. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Sharp P. Cell. 1988; 52: 415-423Google Scholar) was undertaken using a HeLa cDNA expression library (λ-Zap II, Stratagene) and a single-stranded, 32P-labeled oligodeoxyribonucleotide 5′-SHS Py probe. Screening of ∼5 × 105 independent plaques yielded three clones that exhibited strong retention of the radiolabeled 5′-SHS Py probe. DNA sequencing and a search of the human genome revealed that all three contained a 456-bp open reading frame encoding NM23-H1 (for a review see Ref. 30De La Rosa A. Williams R.L. Steeg P.S. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 53-62Google Scholar). Two of the clones (HL1 and HL7) expressed identical 784-bp cDNA inserts containing a short segment of 5′-untranslated sequence (7 bp) and 321 bp of 3′-untranslated sequence (Fig.1). The 3′-untranslated segment was 122 bp longer than that previously reported (31Rosengard A.M. Krutzch H.C. Shearn A. Biggs J.R. Barker E. Margulies I.M.K. King C.R. Liotta L.A. Steeg P.S. Nature. 1989; 342: 177-180Google Scholar), suggesting a novel pattern of processing of the primary NM23-H1 transcript. The third clone (HL2) contained a 660-bp insert that contained shorter 5′-untranslated (2 bp) and 3′-untranslated (189 bp) segments, of which the latter was identical to that described previously (31Rosengard A.M. Krutzch H.C. Shearn A. Biggs J.R. Barker E. Margulies I.M.K. King C.R. Liotta L.A. Steeg P.S. Nature. 1989; 342: 177-180Google Scholar). To study the interactions of NM23-H1 with the 5′-SHS element in detail, the protein was expressed in E. coli and was purified to near homogeneity, using sequential steps of anion exchange and HTP column chromatography (see “Experimental Procedures”). NM23-H1 eluted as a doublet of ∼19 kDa from the HTP column with a gradient of increasing potassium phosphate (Fig. 2A). Resolution of NM23-H1 into a doublet is related to the presence of phosphate, because a single 19-kDa band is observed after phosphate removal (data not shown). Using a 32P-labeled, single-stranded 5′-SHS Py strand as the DNA substrate and conditions shown previously for NM23-H2 to promote its DNA cleaving activity and to reduce formation of stable complexes with DNA (see “Experimental Procedures”; Ref. 26Postel E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22821-22829Google Scholar), strong cleaving activity was demonstrated in NM23-H1-containing fractions (Fig. 2B). The peak in DNA cleaving activity co-eluted precisely with NM23-H1 protein at ∼150 mm of the phosphate gradient, strongly suggesting that NM23-H1 was indeed the active species. The HTP-purified preparation of NM23-H1 was next analyzed in more detail for its ability to cleave either of the individual strands of the 5′-SHS (5′-SHS Pu and 5′-SHS Py) in their single-stranded forms. In addition, considering the probability that these single-stranded oligodeoxyribonucleotides would form secondary structures not found in the natural context of duplex DNA, the double-stranded form of 5′-SHS was also evaluated. NM23-H1 cleaved both the single-stranded 5′-SHS Pu and 5′-SHS Py DNAs in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.3A, lanes 1–12). Increasing amounts of NM23-H1 protein (0.1–2.5 μg) yielded bands of progressively faster electrophoretic mobility from both individual 5′-SHS strands, suggesting a processive nuclease activity. The ability of NM23-H1 to cleave such distinct single-stranded DNA sequences (Pu-rich versus Py-rich) indicated recognition of structural features distinct from the primary nucleotide sequence per se. Co-incubation of NM23-H1 with double-stranded 5′-SHS that was radiolabeled at both 5′-termini yielded a pattern of bands similar to those obtained from the individual strands alone (lanes 13–18), suggesting that the signals for cleavage were the same in either single-stranded or duplex DNA forms. Based on the previously characterized ability of NM23-H2 to cleave the c-myc NHE sequence (26Postel E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22821-22829Google Scholar, 32Postel E. Abramczyk B.M. Levit M.N. Kyin S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 97: 14194-14199Google Scholar), we next examined the extent to which NM23-H2 could cleave the structurally similar 5′-SHS sequence. Indeed, NM23-H2 cleaved the 5′-SHS sequence in both its single-stranded and double-stranded forms (Fig. 3B). Most of the 5′-SHS Py strand was converted into a single fragment with high mobility, although small amounts of three fragments of lesser mobility were also observed (lanes 1–6). Co-incubation of increasing amounts of NM23-H2 with the 5′-SHS Pu strand yielded increasing levels of one rapidly migrating species and lesser amounts of two others (lanes 7–12). The pattern of cleavage obtained with a 5′-SHS double-stranded DNA substrate was consistent with that seen with the single-stranded 5′-SHS substrates (lanes 13–18). NM23-H2 appeared to be somewhat more potent than NM23-H1 under the experimental conditions employed, with 5′-SHS cleaving activity appearing at concentrations as low as 100 ng/reaction as compared with 250–500 ng with NM23-H1. Interestingly, NM23-H2 yielded a small number of DNA fragments that in general were not converted to progressively smaller sizes with increasing NM23-H2 concentration in the manner seen with NM23-H1. Cleavage of single- and double-stranded forms of the 5′-SHS by NM23-H1 and NM23-H2 were of relatively high affinity, because cleavage of each was inhibited with low concentrations of unlabeled, homologous DNAs (IC50 = 0.5–5 nm; data not shown). Although nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels proved useful in the analysis of NM23-generated cleavage products, they did not provide the resolution necessary to localize specific sites of cleavage. Thus, we next analyzed the 5′-SHS cleavage products on denaturing sequencing gels, restricting our focus to the duplex form. To obtain an independent analysis of the individual strands within the 5′-SHS duplex, substrates were prepared for which either the Py or the Pu strand was selectively radiolabeled (see “Experimental Procedures”). In addition, we extended our analyses to the PDGF-A NHE located between −82 and −42, which has been shown to be critical for basal transcriptional activity. The PDGF-A NHE was considered a likely target of NM23 because of its considerable paranemic character (i.e. hypersensitivity to nuclease and chemical modification) and its high degree of nucleotide sequence identity with both the 5′-SHS silencer and the c-myc NHE, most notably the perfect conservation of a GGGGAGGGGG motif at its 3′-terminus. As expected from the nondenaturing gel analyses (Fig. 3), NM23-H1 and NM23-H2 cleaved both the Pu-rich and Py-rich strands of the duplex 5′-SHS sequence, but the cleavage patterns obtained with the two proteins were quite different (Fig. 4A; results summarized in Fig. 4B). NM23-H1 generated an array of Py strand fragments (lane 2), with cleavage occurring predominantly at two sites located 4 and 5 nucleotides from the 3′-terminus. Cleavage of the Pu strand by NM23-H1 was similar to that of the Py strand, characterized by multiple fragments with varying lengths of 3′ truncation (lane 5). In contrast, NM23-H2 produced a more limited set of fragments resulting from cleavage within the 5′-portions of both 5′-SHS strands (Fig. 4A, lanes 3 and6). The Py strand was cleaved predominantly between nucleotides located 7–11 residues from the 5′-terminus (lane 3), although minor cleavage sites were detected within the 3′-terminal portion. A single predominant cleavage site was mapped to 9 nucleotides from the 5′-terminus of the Pu strand (lane 6) but again with minor amounts of cleavage in the 3′-region. Interestingly, the cleavage sites mapped for NM23-H1 and NM23-H2 were not localized to the CCCCCTCCCC motif shared by the 5′-SHS, c-myc NHE, and the PDGF-A NHE. The observation that NM23-H2 cleaved the Py and Pu strands at similar distances from the 5′-terminus but within very different sequence contexts strongly suggests that cleavage of the 5′-SHS by NM23-H2 is position-dependent rather than strictly sequence-specific. The patterns of NHE cleavage by NM23-H1 were quite similar to those observed with the 5′-SHS sequence, with cleavage directed to the 3′-portions of both strands. The Py strand appeared to be a better cleavage substrate than the Pu strand, however, being characterized by a more extensive array of 3′-truncated products (lanes 8 and 11). NM23-H2 produced a single Py strand fragment resulting from cleavage at a site 9 nucleotides from the 5′-terminus (lane 9). The Pu strand was also a poorer substrate for NM23-H2 than the Py strand, although minor amounts of cleavage products were observed (lane 12). To measure the extent to which NM23-H1 and NM23-H2 interact with the upstream silencer and the proximal promoter regions of the PDGF-A gene, effects of NM23-H1 and NM23-H2 overexpression were assessed by transient transfection analysis. The HepG2 cell line (human hepatoma) was employed because it exhibits significant levels of basal promoter activity and PDGF-A expression, as well as silencer activity of the 5′-SHS element and the larger negative regulatory region (NRR; −1853 to −883). The plasmid pAC1853, which contains the NRR in the overall context of a 1853 to +8 fragment of the PDGF-A gene, yielded only 40% of the CAT activity obtained with pAC883, from which the NRR has been deleted (Fig.5A). These trends were consistent with previous observations of NRR activity in BSC-1 (African green monkey epithelial cells; Ref. 8Kaetzel Jr., D.M. Maul R.S. Liu B. Bonthron D. Fenstermaker R.A. Coyne D.W. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 321-327Google Scholar) and HeLa (6Lin X. Wang Z. Gu L. Deuel T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25614-25619Google Scholar) cell lines. Also, as seen previously (11Liu B. Maul R.S. Kaetzel Jr., D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26281-26290Google Scholar), relocation of the 33-bp 5′-SHS silencer sequence to a site just upstream of the basal A-chain promoter (−261 to +8) reduced CAT activity to 55% of that seen with the basal promoter alone. Overexpression of either NM23-H1 or NM23-H2 repressed each of the PDGF-A promoter constructs studied (Fig. 5A). These repressive effects were selective for the PDGF-A promoter, with little or no effect seen on a co-transfected β-galactosidase reporter plasmid (pCMV-βgal, data not shown). Although the inhibition obtained with NM23-H1 and NM23-H2 on the pAC261, pAC261/5′-SHS and pAC881 constructs ranged between 45 and 60%, NM23-H1 and NM23-H2 appeared to repress pAC1853 more strongly (33 and 26% of the activity of pAC1853, respectively), suggesting that additional repressive activity might be directed to the NRR. The presence of the 5′-SHS silencer (pAC261/5′-SHS) did not result in additional NM23-mediated repression, possibly because of relocation of this element from its natural upstream location to a position much closer to the basal promoter. The previous localization of transcriptional activity of pAC261 to the −82 to −40 region (8Kaetzel Jr., D.M. Maul R.S. Liu B. Bonthron D. Fenstermaker R.A. Coyne D.W. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 321-327Google Scholar, 33Takimoto Y. Wang Z. Kobler K. Deuel T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1991; 88: 1686-1690Google Scholar), taken together with the current demonstration of efficient cleavage of this region in vitroby NM23-H1 and NM23-H2, strongly suggested that the repressive effects of NM23-H1 and NM23-H2 on pAC261 were directed to this element. To address this question more directly, a plasmid (pAC-F11) bearing the −82 to +8 promoter fragment that contains only the NHE and TATA motifs of the basal promoter was analyzed. Both NM23-H1 and NM23-H2 reduced CAT activities of F11 by ∼50% (Fig. 5B), localizing the inhibitory effects to within the minimal −82 to +8 region of the PDGF-A promoter. Co-expression of NM23-H1 and NM23-H2 consistently resulted in less CAT reporter gene repression than was seen with either protein alone; however, this apparent repressive effect was cancelled by a concomitant inhibition of the transfection efficiency control plasmid, pCMV-βgal (data not shown), presumably because of a cooperative transcriptional effect of NM23-H1 and NM23-H2 on the CMV promoter. CAT activity of a minimal −42 to +8 promoter fragment was below the limit of detection (data not shown), consistent with previous studies (8Kaetzel Jr., D.M. Maul R.S. Liu B. Bonthron D. Fenstermaker R.A. Coyne D.W. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 321-327Google Scholar). Unwound or non-B-form regions of DNA, termed paranemic structures by Watson and Crick (34Watson J.D. Crick F.H.C. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1953; 18: 123-131Google Scholar), are often associated with both enhancement and repression of transcription in eukaryotic genes (35Yagil G. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 26: 475-559Google Scholar). Our studies have demonstrated that NM23-H1 (H1) interacts with two such structures in the PDGF-A gene, the 5′-SHS silencer and the NHE basal promoter element, recognizing them as binding/cleavage substrates and repressing their transcriptional activity in cultured cells. These sequences can be added to a rapidly growing list of elements shown to be targets of NM23 proteins, including the NHE of the c-myc gene (23Postel E.H. Berberich S.J. Flint S.J. Ferrone C.A. Science. 1993; 261: 478-480Google Scholar), as well as elements located within five different genes involved in myeloid-specific differentiation (myeloperoxidase,CD11b, CD11c, CD54, andCCR5) (24Postel E. Berberich S.J. Rooney J.W. Kaetzel D.M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2000; 32: 277-284Google Scholar). Although considerable nucleotide sequence identity is seen among the NM23 target sequences identified to date (e.g. the GGGGAGGGG motif found in the c-myc NHE, and the NHE and 5′-SHS of PDGF-A), a clear consensus sequence for DNA cleavage is not apparent. However, evidence of sequence selectivity has been observed; for example, NM23-H2 binds a 104-bp fragment of the c-myc NHE better than 50- or 34-bp duplex oligonucleotides (24Postel E. Berberich S.J. Rooney J.W. Kaetzel D.M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2000; 32: 277-284Google Scholar). Furthermore, methylation interference footprint"

PDI consists of four domains arranged in the order a-b-b′-a′ with an acidic extension at the C terminus (c domain) that contains the KDEL retention sequence. The first two domains show significant homology to thioredoxin (4Kemmink J. Darby N.J. Dijkstra K. Nilges M. Creighton T.E. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 239-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 5Kemmink J. Darby N.J. Dijkstra K. Nilges M. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7684-7691Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Although there are no structural data available for the b′ and a′ domains, it can be infered from their sequence similarities to the b and adomain, respectively, that they also contain the thioredoxin fold. Both, the a and a′ domains of PDI, contain the local sequence -WCGHCK- that is essential for the catalytic activity of PDI. Both isolated domains can operate as thiol:disulfide oxidoreductases, but all other PDI domains are required to assist protein refolding and formation of native disulfide bonds with maximum catalytic activity (6Darby N.J. Penka E. Vincentelli R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). No function has been assigned to the b domain so far, however, the b′ domain provides the principle peptide-binding site (7Klappa P. Ruddock L.W. Darby N.J. Freedman R.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 927-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). This domain alone is sufficient to bind peptides of 10–15 residues but binding of larger peptides or non-native proteins requires the contribution of either thea and b domains or the a′ domain (7Klappa P. Ruddock L.W. Darby N.J. Freedman R.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 927-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). In vitro, PDI can assist folding of proteins that contain no disulfide bonds, demonstrating its function as a chaperone (8Song J.L. Wang C.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 312-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 9Cai H. Wang C.C. Tsou C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24550-24552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PDI can influence folding of proteins with multiple disulfide bonds as a chaperone and also as an isomerase (10−17). Yao et al. (11Yao Y. Zhou Y. Wang C.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) proposed that PDI can fulfil both activities on the refolding of acidic phospholipase A2. When using mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase (10van den Berg B. Chung E.W. Robinson C.V. Mateo P.L. Dobson C.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4794-4803Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) or rhodanese (8Song J.L. Wang C.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 312-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) as a substrate PDI influences refolding in a chaperone-like manner. PDI and also alkylated PDI displaying no isomerase activity can chaperone refolding ofd-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase indicating that the active sites are not required for the chaperone activity of PDI (9Cai H.

J. 1988; 255: 451-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Furthermore, under certain redox conditions PDI can reduce protein substrates with native disulfide bonds (13Lilie H. McLaughlin S. Freedman R. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14290-14296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Zheng J. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15747-15752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In addition, PDI can catalyze disulfide bond formation and rearrangements within kinetically trapped, structured folding intermediates (21Weissman J.S. Kim P.S. Nature. 1993; 365: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). This demonstrates that the substrate specificity of PDI is not restricted to misfolded proteins containing no or non-native “scrambled” disulfide bonds. It is possible to discriminate between isomerase and chaperone activity of PDI by using mutants or variants displaying only one of both activities. Active site mutants or alkylated PDI have been used to generate species that act as a chaperone only (11Yao Y. Zhou Y. Wang C.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 13Lilie H. McLaughlin S. Freedman R. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14290-14296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand mutants lacking chaperone activity do not exist as it is not clear which amino acid residues in the peptide-binding domain are involved and essential for substrate binding. Tsibris et al.(22Tsibris J.C. Hunt L.T. Ballejo G. Barker W.C. Toney L.J. Spellacy W.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13967-13970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) could show that isomerization of scrambled RNase and reduction of insulin are inhibited by estrogens which might be due to the similarity of PDI parts with estrogen receptor segments. Additionally, compounds with estrogenic activity can inhibit peptide binding to PDIp, a pancreas-specific member of the protein-disulfide isomerase family (23Klappa P. Freedman R.B. Langenbuch M. Lan M.S. Robinson G.K. Ruddock L.W. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 553-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To dissect the different activities of PDI we used human proinsulin as model substrate. Human proinsulin consists of a single polypeptide which, after trypsin and carboxypeptidase B cleavage, can be converted to the biologically active insulin and the c-peptide in vitro (24Kemmler W. Peterson J.D. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 6786-6791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proinsulin contains three disulfide bonds (1Freedman R.B. Klappa P. Bukau B. Molecular Chaperones and Protein Folding. Harwood Academic Press, London1999: 437-459Google Scholar) Cys7-Cys72, (2Noiva R. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 481-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) Cys19-Cys85, and (3Wang C.C. Biochemistry (Mosc.). 1998; 63: 407-412PubMed Google Scholar) Cys71-Cys76 which are essential for its native structure. In addition to the efficient spontaneous oxidative folding of reduced proinsulin at pH 10.5, 2J. Winter, unpublished results.2J. Winter, unpublished results. native proinsulin can also be generated at neutral pH starting from the scrambled molecule in the presence of PDI in a molar ratio PDI/substrate of 0.1 (17Tang J.G. Wang C.C. Tsou C.L. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 451-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Here we investigated the mechanism of PDI function in proinsulin refolding. We show that PDI influences the refolding of denatured and reduced proinsulin both as an isomerase and as a chaperone. PDI in catalytic amounts is able to increase the refolding rate and the refolding yield while PDI variants devoid of isomerase activity influence the refolding yield only when present in stoichiometric amounts. The chaperone function is essential during the first seconds of refolding because aggregation of folding proinsulin is a major side reaction. Inhibition of the peptide-binding site of PDI leads to a suppression of the aggregation preventing role of PDI. Besides the chaperone function the isomerase activity is also required at the beginning of proinsulin folding, but the late refolding process does only depend on the isomerase activity. Recombinant native human proinsulin was provided by BIOBRÁS, Montes Claros, Brazil. ELISA antibodies were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Penzberg, Germany. The vectors pET23-PDI and pET23-PDI-b′a′c were received from Dr. L. W. Ruddock, University of Kent, Canterbury, UK. PDI and PDI variants were purified from Escherichia coli lysates as described below. Genistein and the homobifunctional cross-linking reagent disuccinimidyl glutarate were purchased from Sigma, iodoacetamide was obtained from ICN. X-ray films and Bolton-Hunter 125I labeling reagent were obtained from Amersham Bioscience, Inc. The human proinsulin, containing a N-terminal His8-Arg-tag was subjected to reductive unfolding by adding 20 mg of the native proinsulin to 1 ml of 6 m guanidinium chloride, 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1.1 m dithiothreitol. The sample was incubated for 8 h at 37 °C and then extensively dialyzed at 4 °C against 6 m guanidinium chloride, 5 mm EDTA, pH 3. For cross-linking, the denatured and reduced proinsulin was desalted to a final concentration of 2 mguanidinium chloride using a NAP-5 column (Amersham Bioscience, Inc.). Refolding of proinsulin was performed in 10 mm Tris, 10 mm glycine, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmGSH, 2 mm GSSG at 25 °C by diluting the unfolded and reduced proinsulin to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml, if not otherwise indicated. The sample was immediately mixed. At distinct time points aliquots were removed and acetonitrile (final concentration 20% (v/v)) and trifluoroacetic acid (final concentration 0.1% (v/v)) were added, if not otherwise indicated. Refolding of proinsulin in the presence of genistein was performed with proinsulin at a final concentration of 27 μg/ml. Genistein (10 mm solution in Me2SO) was added to a final concentration of 20 μm. Aliquots were removed and digested with trypsin and carboxypeptidase B (see below). Refolding of denatured and reduced proinsulin was monitored by reversed phase HPLC (RP-HPLC) using a C18 column (Macherey-Nagel) equilibrated with 100% solvent A (solvent A: 20% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid; solvent B: 80% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid). The protein was eluted at 20 °C with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min of a linear gradient from 20 to 40% solvent B within 20 min. For samples containing genistein and for samples after digestion, the column was equilibrated with 10% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. The protein was eluted with a linear gradient from 10 to 38% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min within 40 min. Peaks were detected by absorbance at 214 nm and quantified according to a calibration curve. Refolding samples containing genistein were digested with trypsin and carboxypeptidase B (final concentration 1.35 μg/ml each) for 20 min at ambient temperature. Afterward acetonitrile and trifluoroacetic acid were added to a final concentration of 10 and 0.1% (v/v), respectively, and the samples were analyzed by RP-HPLC as described above. To verify the native structure of the refolded proinsulin, a digestion was performed with native and refolded proinsulin at refolding conditions (100 μg/ml proinsulin). After incubation for 20 min at ambient temperature the digestion was stopped by addition of soybean trypsin inhibitor and EDTA. The final concentrations were 5 μg/ml trypsin, 5 μg/ml carboxypeptidase B, 25 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, and 125 mm EDTA. Samples were analyzed by RP-HPLC as described above and by an insulin-ELISA as described previously (25Winter J. Neubauer P. Glockshuber R. Rudolph R. J. Biotechnol. 2000; 84: 175-185Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Light scattering due to aggregation was measured at 500 nm in a stirrable 2-ml cuvette using a fluorescence spectrometer (FLUOROMAX, Spec Instruments). For proinsulin concentrations of 10–100 μg/ml both excitation and emission slits were adjusted to 1 nm band width, for lower concentrations to 3 nm. The temperature of the refolding buffer (see above) was adjusted to 25 °C. The protein to be measured was added to the stirred refolding buffer and aggregation was recorded for 120 to 600 s. At the same conditions a calibration curve was generated for denatured and reduced proinsulin (from 0.2 to 10 μm). According to this calibration curve, the light scattering signal caused by the aggregation of proinsulin could be calculated to micrograms/ml aggregating proinsulin. Related to the amount of proinsulin used one can calculate the corresponding amount of proinsulin protected from aggregation. Point mutations to replace the codons for cysteine in the active sites of PDI by serine were generated using the vector pET23-PDI for the quick change procedure (Qiagen). The wild-type sequences 5′-TGTGGCCACTGC-3′ for the a domain (corresponding to -35CGHC38-) and 5′-TGTGGTCACTGC-3′ for the a′ domain (corresponding to -379CGHC382-) were changed to 5′-TCCGGTCACTCT-3′ encoding the amino acid sequence -SGHS-. The active site in either the a domain (PDIΔC1) or a′domain (PDIΔC2) was mutated to generate a PDI-single mutant. The PDI-double mutant (PDIΔC1,2) was produced by replacing the cysteine codons of both active sites by serine. The correct sequence was verified by DNA sequencing. For the production of wild-type PDI, PDI-b′a′c, and the mutants PDIΔC1, PDIΔC2, and PDIΔC1,2, E. coli BL21(DE3)-pLysS was transformed with the corresponding plasmid-DNA. The cells were incubated at 37 or 30 °C on LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Three hours after induction with 1 mmisopropyl-thio-β-d-galactopyranosid, the cells were harvested by centrifugation. The cell pellet was suspended in buffer A (20 mm Na-phosphate, pH 7.3) and DNase was added to a final concentration of 10 μg/ml. After freezing and thawing the suspension twice, the lysate was centrifuged. After ultrafiltration (0.2 μm), the supernatant was loaded onto a Ni-NTA column (volume 12 ml, Qiagen), which, after activation with NiSO4 and washing with double-distilled water, was equilibrated with buffer A. Proteins bound nonspecifically onto the matrix were removed by washing the column with buffer A containing 500 mm NaCl and 50 mmimidazole, followed by buffer A. Recombinant protein was eluted with buffer A containing 10 mm EDTA. The elution fraction was loaded onto a ResourceQ column (6 ml, Amersham Bioscience, Inc.) equilibrated with buffer A and eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 0.5 m NaCl in buffer A. Fractions containing homogenous PDI or PDI variants were pooled and dialyzed against 1 mm Tris, 1 mm glycine, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA. The concentration of purified protein was determined by UV spectroscopy (molar absorbance coefficient 45,380 m−1cm−1 (280 nm)). The molecular mass of the purified proteins was determined by mass spectrometry. PDIΔC1,2 was centrifuged (70,000 × g, 4 °C, 30 min) prior to use and afterward the correct concentration was determined by UV spectroscopy. PDI was incubated with 5 mm dithiothreitol. After 20 min at 25 °C, iodoacetamide was added to a final concentration of 50 mm and the sample was incubated for 45 min at 25 °C. Excess dithiothreitol and iodoacetamide was removed by dialysis against 1 mm Tris, 1 mm glycine, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA and the alkylated PDI lyophilized and stored at −20 °C. For refolding experiments, lyophilized alkylated PDI was dissolved in double distilled water to a concentration of ∼5 mg/ml. After centrifugation (70,000 × g, 4 °C, 30 min), the correct concentration was determined by UV spectroscopy. Bolton-Hunter 125I labeling of denatured and reduced proinsulin (5 mg/ml, in 2 mguanidinium chloride, pH 3.0) was carried out as recommended by the manufacturer. Radiolabeled proinsulin was incubated with the E. coli cell extract that expressed PDI (10 μg/ml) on ice. After 10 min 0.1 volume of disuccinimidyl glutarate (5 mm in Me2SO) was added and the sample incubated for additional 60 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer (26Klappa P. Hawkins H.C. Freedman R.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated on 12.5 or 15% polyacrylamide gels and electrotransferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and subsequently analyzed by autoradiography. PDI catalyzed the refolding of denatured and reduced proinsulin with two effects (Fig.1A). First, PDI increased the rate of oxidative folding in a concentration-dependent manner. In the absence of PDI the apparent rate constant of oxidative refolding of proinsulin was kapp = 0.0018 s−1. With equimolar amounts of PDI present the rate constant of folding was increased drastically to approximatelykapp = 0.033 s−1. Second, PDI enhanced the refolding yield (Fig. 1C). The yield reached a plateau of about 50–60% once PDI was present in a molar ratio of PDI/proinsulin of 0.033 and could not be increased further even in the presence of stoichiometric amounts of PDI. Under the same conditions bovine serum albumin did not affect proinsulin folding (data not shown). Refolding of proinsulin depended on the redox conditions; with 1 mm GSH and 2 mm GSSG the best yield of refolding was obtained for the spontaneous and the catalyzed reaction (data not shown). A slow decrease in native proinsulin was observed after folding in the presence of high PDI concentrations (Fig. 1A). To analyze this effect native proinsulin was incubated under the same conditions in the absence and presence of PDI (data not shown). The amount of native proinsulin was unchanged under all conditions indicating that aggregation or proteolysis of native proinsulin did not occur under these conditions and that no isomerization of native disulfide bonds occurred, neither spontaneously nor catalyzed by PDI. In addition, native proinsulin at refolding conditions and refolded proinsulin were digested with trypsin and carboxypeptidase B and the digestion products were analyzed by an insulin-ELISA (25Winter J. Neubauer P. Glockshuber R. Rudolph R. J. Biotechnol. 2000; 84: 175-185Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). At these conditions only correctly folded proinsulin can be converted to native insulin (24Kemmler W. Peterson J.D. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 6786-6791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amount of insulin generated from native and refolded proinsulin, respectively, was identical indicating that the refolded proinsulin was indeed correctly folded and contained native disulfide bonds (data not shown). PDI, PDI-b′a′c (a PDI variant containing only the last three domains), and mutants having one (PDIΔC1 and PDIΔC2) or both (PDIΔC1,2) active sites inactivated by cysteine to serine substitutions were tested with respect to refolding of denatured and reduced proinsulin. As shown in Fig.1B only wild-type PDI was able to increase refolding to the maximum rate and yield. PDIΔC1 and PDIΔC2 increased the folding rate and yield, but not to the same extent as wild-type PDI, even when they were present at a two times higher concentration which corresponded to the same amount of active sites present in wild-type PDI. This effect was independent of which active site, either in thea domain or a′ domain, was mutated. PDI-b′a′c had the same properties in proinsulin renaturation as PDIΔC1 and PDIΔC2 (data not shown). PDIΔC1,2 was not capable of increasing the folding rate, however, PDIΔC1,2 could improve the yield of refolding by about 30% (Fig. 1C). In contrast to wild-type PDI which increased the yield of refolding of proinsulin already at substoichiometric concentrations PDIΔC1,2 had to be present at least at stoichiometric concentrations. These results indicate that PDI acts both as an isomerase and as a chaperone when present during refolding of proinsulin. Next, we asked at which stages of the renaturation process the isomerase and the chaperone activity of PDI are required to allow efficient refolding of proinsulin. Refolding was performed in the presence of wild-type PDI or PDIΔC1,2 added to refolding proinsulin at different times of renaturation (Fig. 2). The chaperone activity was only effective when present during the first seconds of the refolding process. While PDIΔC1,2 could chaperone renaturation of proinsulin when present at the beginning of the process, no increase in yield was observed if PDIΔC1,2 was added to refolding proinsulin after 7 s of refolding. PDI inactivated by alkylation (13Lilie H. McLaughlin S. Freedman R. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14290-14296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was tested under the same conditions (data not shown) and its activity on refolding was identical to that of PDIΔC1,2 thus excluding unspecific effects of possible structural changes caused by the point mutations in PDIΔC1,2. Both, PDIΔC1,2 and alkylated PDI, showed identical results in the timed addition experiment. In contrast, wild-type PDI, even when added 1 min after initiation of folding could improve renaturation. This improvement, however, was not as efficient as when present from the beginning. This indicates that the significant decrease in the refolding yield due to the absence of the chaperone function in the first seconds of refolding can be partly compensated by the isomerase activity of PDI. The observed decrease in the yield of refolding of proinsulin when PDI was added to the refolding sample at different time points exhibits a biphasic kinetic. A very fast first phase with an apparent rate constantkapp = 0.075 s−1 was followed by a slow phase with a kapp = 0.0043 s−1. Compared with the rate constant of formation of native proinsulin (kapp = 0.0018 s−1, Fig. 1A) the second phase occurred in a similar time range but the first phase was much faster. From this we conclude that upon renaturation of proinsulin there is a kinetic competition between an overall slow folding process and an ∼20 times faster off-pathway reaction. This off-pathway seems to depend on redox reactions subsequently leading to aggregation. Furthermore, PDI and PDIΔC1,2 were tested with respect to peptide binding. Chemical cross-linking with an amino-specific cross-linking reagent is a useful method to detect interaction partners for PDI (7Klappa P. Ruddock L.W. Darby N.J. Freedman R.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 927-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 26Klappa P. Hawkins H.C. Freedman R.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Both variants of PDI were capable of binding radiolabeled denatured and reduced proinsulin (Fig.3). Furthermore, the binding was reversible, as it could be competed with other substrate peptides and proteins (data not shown). This clearly demonstrates that PDI and PDIΔC1,2 were indistinguishable with respect to their interactions with substrates. PDIΔC1,2 shows two bands in the cross-linking (Fig.3). The signal at lower molecular weight corresponded to a degraded PDIΔC1,2. Both, the full-length and the degraded PDIΔC1,2 were able to bind denatured and reduced proinsulin. This degradation was probably due to proteases present in the E. coli cell extract used for the cross-linking assay. No degradation of PDIΔC1,2 was observed with purified protein under refolding conditions as analyzed by SDS gels (data not shown). To demonstrate that the observed effects of the PDIΔC1,2 were not due to misfolding of one or more of its domains its stability was compared with that of wild-type PDI. Incubation of PDIΔC1,2 or the wild-type PDI with various concentrations of proteinase K showed that there was no significant difference in the protease sensitivity indicating that PDIΔC1,2 can adopt as compact a structure as the wild-type and that there was no difference in the structural stability of both proteins (data not shown). Aggregation of folding proinsulin as detected by light scattering was proportional to the proinsulin concentration in the refolding sample (Fig. 4B, inset). It occurred in the first seconds of refolding, reaching a maximum after 20–30 s (Fig. 4A). This indicates that aggregation of proinsulin during renaturation occurred in the same time range as the fast phase of the unproductive reaction observed in the timed addition experiment of PDI (Fig. 2). PDI suppressed aggregation of refolding proinsulin substantially and was already effective in catalytic amounts (Fig.4B) which is in agreement with the refolding data shown in Fig. 1A and the timed addition data from Fig. 2. PDI at a molar ratio of PDI/proinsulin of 0.05 could protect about 20% of the folding proinsulin from aggregation. In contrast, alkylated PDI in the same molar ratio could suppress only 10% of the aggregation (data not shown). Only when present in stoichiometric amounts could alkylated PDI prevent aggregation of folding proinsulin to the same extent as PDI. Under identical conditions bovine serum albumin did not suppress aggregation (data not shown). This clearly indicates that PDI, present in catalytic amounts, possesses chaperone activity which alone is not sufficient to protect folding proinsulin from aggregation. Early intermediates in the proinsulin folding pathway, probably containing wrong disulfide bonds, seem to be highly susceptible to aggregation. In the presence of wild-type PDI these aggregation-prone intermediates can isomerize to folding intermediates that are less susceptible to aggregation. This results in reduced aggregation and, as a consequence, in an enhanced refolding yield. When present in very high concentrations alkylated PDI was similarly effective, indicating that a noncatalyzed isomerization of disulfides during proinsulin folding can occur if aggregation is sufficiently suppressed by the chaperone activity. However, independent of the presence of PDI a significant part of proinsulin aggregated during the refolding. This correlates with the maximum refolding yield of about 50%. To analyze whether the interaction of PDI and PDIΔC1,2 with denatured and reduced proinsulin can be suppressed by an inhibitor of the chaperone activity we used the small molecular weight substance genistein. It has been shown previously that genistein, a substance with estrogenic activity, can suppress the binding of Δ-somatostatin to PDIp, a member of the protein-disulfide isomerase family (23Klappa P. Freedman R.B. Langenbuch M. Lan M.S. Robinson G.K. Ruddock L.W. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 553-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and also PDI. 3L. W. Ruddock and P. Klappa, unpublished observations. Both, PDI and PDIΔC1,2 showed the same genistein binding properties (Fig.5A) indicating that the peptide-binding domain of PDIΔC1,2 was not affected by the mutations in both active sites. By titration of genistein we found that a 3-fold molar excess of genistein over proinsulin was required to completely suppress binding of denatured and reduced proinsulin to PDI as well as to PDIΔC1,2. Genistein-inhibited PDI or alkylated PDI were significantly affected in their ability to prevent proinsulin from aggregation (Fig.5B). In refolding samples analyzed by light scattering genistein-inhibited PDI and genistein-inhibited alkylated PDI could protect about 11% of the folding proinsulin from aggregation. This indicates that both PDIs still had some residual chaperone activity under the experimental conditions. Genistein inhibited 66% of the chaperone function of PDI. For comparison, the inhibitory effect of genistein on alkylated PDI was less pronounced (about 50% inhibition). The lower inhibition effect for alkylated PDI was due to i"
https://openalex.org/W2058171174,"The correlation, found in nearby galaxies, between black hole mass and stellar bulge mass implies that the formation of these two components must be related. Here we report submillimeter photometry of eight x--ray absorbed active galactic nuclei which have luminosities and redshifts characteristic of the sources that produce the bulk of the accretion luminosity in the universe. The four sources with the highest redshifts are detected at 850 microns, with flux densities between 5.9 and 10.1 milliJanskies, and hence are ultraluminous infrared galaxies. Interpreting the submillimeter flux as emission from dust heated by starbursts, these results suggest that the majority of stars in spheroids were formed at the same time as their central black holes built up most of their mass by accretion, accounting for the observed demography of massive black holes in the local universe. The skewed rate of submillimeter detection with redshift is consistent with a high redshift epoch of star formation in radio quiet active galactic nuclei, similar to that seen in radio galaxies."
https://openalex.org/W2085132609,"We recently identified a novel protein called syncoilin, a putative intermediate filament protein that interacts with α-dystrobrevin, a member of the dystrophin-associated protein complex. Syncoilin is found at the neuromuscular junction, sarcolemma, and Z-lines and is thought to be important for muscle fiber integrity. Based on the similar protein structure and cellular localization of syncoilin and desmin, we proposed that these proteins interact in vivo. The data presented confirm an interaction between syncoilin and desmin and demonstrate their co-localization in skeletal muscle. Intriguingly, whereas these proteins interact, COS-7 cell expression studies show that desmin and syncoilin do not assemble into heterofilaments. Furthermore, fractionation assay and immunofluorescence study of H2K myoblasts and myotubes suggest that, unlike typical intermediate filament proteins, syncoilin does not participate in filament formation with any protein. However, it is possible that syncoilin is involved in the anchoring of the desmin intermediate filament network at the sarcolemma and the neuromuscular junction. This interaction is likely to be important for maintaining muscle fiber integrity and may also link the dystrophin-associated protein complex to the cytoskeleton. The dysfunction or absence of syncoilin may result in the disruption of the intermediate filament network leading to muscle necrosis. Syncoilin is therefore an ideal candidate gene for muscular dystrophies and desmin-related myopathies."

We have shown that the transcription factor cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) participates in adipogenesis, with constitutively active forms of CREB inducing adipocyte differentiation and dominant negative forms of CREB blocking this process. In other cell types, CREB and related factors have been shown to play important roles in survival and apoptosis. Here we demonstrate that reduction of CREB activity by ectopic expression of the dominant negative CREB, KCREB, induces apoptosis of mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes in culture. Death by apoptosis was confirmed by increased nuclear condensation, changes in membrane morphology, and increased DNA fragmentation. Gene microarray analysis indicated that KCREB expression increased expression of several pro-apoptotic genes like Interleukin Converting Enzyme and decreased the expression of the anti-apoptotic signaling molecule, Akt/protein kinase B. Finally, introduction of constitutively active CREB, CREB-DIEDML, blocked death of mature adipocytes treated with TNF-α. The data indicate that CREB plays a central role in adipocyte survival, perhaps by regulating the expression of certain pro- and anti-apoptotic genes. These results not only extend the role of CREB in adipocyte biology but also highlight the general developmental and survival role of this factor in numerous cell and tissue types.

For example, overweight and obesity and related conditions, including diabetes and cardiovascular disease, are reaching epidemic proportions worldwide (2U. S.

Loss or redistribution of adipose tissue associated with acquired or congenital lipodystrophies, or due to aggressive antiretroviral therapy or subcutaneous insulin injection, also constitutes a growing health concern (5Domingo P.

Although these syndromes reflect the action of numerous interacting processes, they all are characterized by changes in adipose tissue mass. Adipose tissue mass is governed in part through competing processes that either increase or decrease the size, number, and “maturity” of fat cells (9Hirsch J. Han P.W. J. Lipid Res. 1969; 10: 77-82Google Scholar). Adipocyte size increases via increased storage of triacylglycerol from dietary sources or generated by lipogenic pathways; new fat cells may arise via the proliferation and differentiation of pre-adipocytes or adipoblasts to mature adipocytes (10Roncari D.A.K. Lau D.C.W. Kindler S. Metabolism. 1981; 30: 425-427Google Scholar). Alternately, decreases in adipose tissue mass generally involve the loss of stored lipids by lipolytic processes. There is now evidence that decreases in adipose tissue mass may also involve the loss of mature fat cells through programmed cell death or apoptosis in certain situations (8Dowell P. Flexner C.

In culture, adipocytes from rodents or cell lines like 3T3-L1 undergo apoptosis upon exposure to TNF-α1 or HIV protease inhibitors (8Dowell P. Flexner C. Kwiterovich P.O. Lane M.D. J. Biol.

Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32111-32120Google Scholar). Other studies in rodents have demonstrated a decrease in adipose tissue DNA content due to loss of adipocytes in response to starvation or streptozotocin-induced diabetes (14Prins J.B. O'Rahilly S. Clin. Sci. 1997; 93: 3-11Google Scholar). More recently, intracerebroventricular administration of leptin was also shown to decrease fat pad weight and DNA content (16Qian H. Azain M.J. Compton M.M. Hartzell D.L. Hausman G.J. Baile C.A. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 791-794Google Scholar). Apoptotic features, including DNA laddering and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining accompanied these changes. Apoptosis of adipose tissue cells has also been observed in human adipose tissue explants subjected to growth factor deprivation, elevated temperature, or TNF-α exposure as determined by changes in cell morphology and DNA laddering (12Prins J.B. Walker N.I. Winterford C.M. Cameron D.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 500-507Google Scholar, 15Prins J.B. Niesler C.U. Winterford C.M. Bright N.A. Siddle K. O'Rahilly S. Walker N.I.

Cameron D.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 625-630Google Scholar). Previously, we have shown that the transcription factor CREB is a target for extracellular agents and intracellular signaling systems that induce adipogenesis (18Reusch J.E.-B. Colton L.A. Klemm D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1008-1020Google Scholar, 19Klemm D.J. Leitner J.W. Watson P. Nesterova A. Reusch J.E.B. Goalstone M.L. Draznin B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28430-28435Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of a constitutively active, chimeric VP16-CREB protein was sufficient to induce adipogenesis, whereas expression of a dominant negative form of CREB, KCREB, blocked the adipogenic program. Similar roles for CREB have been observed in neuronal cells where it participates in differentiation and neurite outgrowth (20Sung J.Y. Shin S.W. Ahn Y.S. Chung K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13858-13866Google Scholar, 21Shimomura A. Okamoto Y. Hirata Y. Kobayashi M. Kawakami K. Kiuchi K. Wakabayashi T. Hagiwara M. J.

CREB also serves as a potent survival factor in neurons preventing apoptosis due to neurotrophin withdrawal (23Francois F. Godhinho M.J. Grimes M.L. FEBS Lett. 2000; 486: 281-284Google Scholar, 24Pugazhenthi S. Miller E. Sable C. Young P.R. Heidenreich K.A. Boxer L.M. Reusch J.E.B. J. Biol.

When KCREB is expressed in mature adipocytes, we observe a loss of triacylglycerol vesicles and cells with typical adipocyte morphology over a 4- to 8-day period. Is this loss due to lipolysis and dedifferentiation of fat cells or is it due to adipocyte apoptosis? Here we show that ectopic expression of KCREB leads to apoptosis of mature adipocytes, which are replaced by undifferentiated pre-adipocytes in culture. Apoptosis was concomitant with an increase in several pro-apoptotic genes and down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic protein kinase B/Akt. We also demonstrate that ectopic expression of constitutively active forms of CREB block adipocyte apoptosis in response to exposure to TNF-α. These results indicate that CREB acts as a survival factor in mature adipocytes and may play out a role in regulating adipose tissue mass and controlling insulin sensitivity.

All supplies and reagents for SDS-PAGE were from Novex/Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Cell culture media and supplies were from Invitrogen (Beverly, MA) and Gemini Bioproducts (Gaithersburg, MD). The Ecdysone-inducible expression system (pIND, pVgRXR vectors, zeocin, and Ponasterone A) was from Invitrogen. The PI3K inhibitor was purchased from Calbiochem, and the adenoviral expression vector for Akt(K179M) was provided by Dr. Carol Sable (VA Medical Center, Denver, CO). 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were grown to confluence in fibroblast growth medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5.5 mm glucose, 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), and 0.5 mm glutamine). Differentiation was initiated by addition of medium containing 10% FCS, 1 mm glutamine, 500 μm isobutylmethylxanthine (or 300 μmBt2cAMP), 1 μm dexamethasone, and 1 μg/ml insulin. After 2 days, cells were transferred to adipocyte growth medium containing 25 mm glucose, 0.5 mmglutamine, 10% FCS, 1 mm glutamine, and 1 μg/ml insulin and re-fed every 2 days. Differentiation of fibroblasts into mature adipocytes was confirmed by Oil Red O staining (18Reusch J.E.-B. Colton L.A. Klemm D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1008-1020Google Scholar). Plates of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were grown to 70–80% confluency and transfected with the indicated plasmids with Superfect Reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Cells stably transfected with the plasmid pVgRXR were selected in conventional medium containing 500 μg/ml zeocin, and cells stably transfected with pIND-KCREB, pIND-VP16-CREB, pIND-CREB-DIEDML, or pIND-LacZ plasmids were selected in medium containing 500 μg/ml Geneticin. Large, rapidly growing, well-separated colonies were isolated 10–12 days after selection was begun with either antibiotic. Isolated clones were passaged in low glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FCS, 1 mm l-glutamine, and 500 μg/ml each of zeocin and Geneticin. KCREB, VP16-CREB, CREB-DIEDML or LacZ expression was induced through the addition of 5 μm Ponasterone A to the growth medium. Assays were performed on cells growing on eight-chamber microscope slides. Ten days following the initiation of differentiation, the cells were stained with Oil Red O and counterstained with hematoxylin to visualize cell morphology. Cells were observed by bright-field microscopy, and representative fields were photographed with Kodak 200 film. Alternately, cells growing on multiwell slides were lysed directly in Laemmli SDS gel loading buffer, and the lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis for marker protein expression. The Ecdysone-inducible expression system was employed to prepare stably transfected 3T3-L1cells in which we could induce the expression of KCREB, CREB-DIEDML, and LacZ as described previously (18Reusch J.E.-B. Colton L.A. Klemm D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1008-1020Google Scholar, 19Klemm D.J. Leitner J.W. Watson P. Nesterova A. Reusch J.E.B. Goalstone M.L. Draznin B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28430-28435Google Scholar). After correcting for protein concentrations, lysates from 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and adipocytes treated as described in the figure legends were prepared in Laemmli SDS loading buffer, resolved on 10% polyacrylamide-SDS gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose. The nitrocellulose blots were blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20 and then treated with antibodies that recognize Akt, CREB, or VP16. The blots were washed and subsequently treated with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase. After the blots were washed, specific immune complexes for each target protein were visualized with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium. Nuclear condensation in apoptotic cells was determined by microscopic observation of cells stained with Hoechst 33342. Control cells (LacZ expressing), KCREB-expressing cells, or cells treated with TNF-α were washed with PBS and fixed in PBS containing 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min. The cells were washed in PBS, and stained in PBS containing 5 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 for 15 min at ambient temperature. The monolayer were washed three times with PBS and observed by fluorescence microscopy (fluorescein isothiocyanate filter set). Images were captured on Kodak Royal Gold 200 film and scanned into a Macintosh G4 computer using an Agfa T1200 scanner. Essentially, 3T3-L1 cells were lifted from culture containers by gentle trypsinization and washed twice in PBS. The cells were resuspended in a buffer containing 100 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, and 1 mm EDTA at 4° C. Immediately, an equal volume of 100% ethanol was added dropwise while vortexing, and the cells were fixed for 3 h at 4° C. After fixing, an additional volume of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 20 units/ml RNase A, and 75 μmpropidium iodide was added while vortexing, and the suspension was placed under refrigeration overnight. The following day the suspensions were subjected to flow cytometry on a Becton Dickinson FACScan linked to a Macintosh G3 computer running CellQuest software. Total RNA was extracted from cells using the Atlas Pure Total RNA Labeling kit fromCLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). Single-strand cDNA probes were generated from total RNA using [32P]dATP. These probes were used for hybridization with separate Mouse cDNA array membranes using protocols and reagents provided by the manufacturer (CLONTECH). Arrays were subjected to autoradiography at −80 °C using Kodak Lightning Plus screens. Scanned arrays were analyzed using Atlas Image software (CLONTECH), comparing relative intensities of specific cDNA “spots,” which were corrected for differences in the relative intensities of housekeeping genes between membranes prior to analysis. Three separate Array analyses were performed with probes generated from RNA resulting from two different experiments. Results for cDNAs depicted below are the mean of these three separate determinations. Data is presented as mRNA content in KCREB-expressing cells relative to mRNA content in LacZ-expressing cells. We have reported that CREB participates in the induction of adipogenesis. As part of the studies, we noted that CREB phosphorylation and activity were stimulated by conventional differentiation-inducing agents in an acute fashion, but were also transiently elevated at later times during adipogenesis. This suggested that CREB might also play a role in later stages of the differentiation process. In addition, our results in adipocyte cell lines parallel similar results in neurons wherein CREB not only participates in differentiation but also acts as a survival factor preventing apoptosis in the absence of neurotrophins. These factors led us to hypothesize that CREB may also play roles in the later stages of adipocyte differentiation or in maintaining the mature adipocyte phenotype. As an initial test of this hypothesis, we blocked the activity of endogenous CREB in mature adipocytes through the ectopic expression of the dominant negative CREB protein, KCREB (27Walton K.M. Rehfuss R.P. Chrivia J.C. Lochner J.E. Goodman R.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 647-655Google Scholar). KCREB inhibits the action of endogenous CREB by forming heterodimers with the endogenous protein that are incapable of binding target DNA sequences. KCREB differs from CREB by one amino acid in the DNA binding domain, and antibodies capable of differentiating between CREB and KCREB do not exist. However, using antibodies that recognize both proteins we were able to detect Ponasterone A-induced KCREB expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by Western blot (Fig.1A). Inhibition of endogenous CREB activity by KCREB was verified by demonstrating that KCREB expression blocked dibutyryl-cAMP (Bt2cAMP)-stimulated transcription from the CRE-containing somatostatin gene promoter (Fig. 1B). We found that within 6–9 days following the initiation of KCREB expression in mature adipocytes, no triacylglycerol vesicles were visible in the cells, and in general, the cells lacked the characteristic rounded morphology of adipocytes (Fig.1C). Similar results were obtained when adipocytes were infected with adenoviral vectors expressing other dominant negative CREBs, including CREBm1 and ACREB (data not shown). We initially proposed that the changes elicited by KCREB reflected lipolysis of triacylglycerol stores and partial dedifferentiation. However, close examination of the cultures revealed a substantial number of non-adherent cells suggesting that the loss of mature adipocytes may have been due to cell death. To test the later hypothesis we expressed KCREB in mature adipocytes over several days and looked for apoptotic nuclear condensation by Hoechst staining. As shown in Fig. 2A, KCREB expression produced a time-dependent, transient increase in cells containing brightly staining nuclei indicative of nuclear condensation. The number of cells with apoptotic nuclei reached an apparent maximum on day 3 and then declined over the following 72 h. During the 6-day period, cells with dimly staining non-apoptotic nuclei, fibroblast morphology, and lacking lipid vesicles increased in number. These data suggested that KCREB expression induced the death of mature adipocytes, which were replaced in culture by undifferentiated pre-adipocytes. In addition to nuclear condensation, we also noted changes in membrane morphology consistent with apoptosis, including membrane retraction (Fig. 2B) and the formation of “blebs” (Fig. 2C). Another hallmark of apoptotic cell death is DNA fragmentation. This parameter was measured by subjecting KCREB-expressing adipocytes to flow cytometric analysis after staining with propidium iodide. Apoptotic cells are evident on the resulting histograms as a “sub-G0/G1” peak indicative of DNA fragmentation and reduced DNA content. The number of cells in the sub-G0/G1 peak increased from day 0 through day 3 and then declined (Fig. 3); consistent with the temporal changes in nuclear condensation shown in Fig.2A. We also noted an increase in the number of cells in the S and G2/M regions of the histograms on days 4–6. No lipid vesicles were evident during microscopic examination of cells in the S and G2/M regions (data not shown). Given the uniform expression of KCREB in the cell population (18Reusch J.E.-B. Colton L.A. Klemm D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1008-1020Google Scholar), we speculate that these cells represent undifferentiated cells that survive KCREB expression and proliferate during and after the death of mature adipocytes. It is also possible that these cells express little of no KCREB upon exposure to Ponasterone A and, therefore, do not undergo apoptotic cell death. The specific nature of these cells is currently being investigated in our laboratory. Given CREB's primary function in regulating gene expression, we examined the levels of expression of several apoptotic genes in untreated adipocytes, or adipocytes inducibly expressing KCREB for 24 h. For these assays, mouse Atlas 1.2 gene arrays (CLONTECH) were employed. We found that the expression of several pro-apoptotic genes were elevated in KCREB-expressing cells, most notably Receptor Interacting Protein (RIP), and Interleukin 1β Converting Enzyme (ICE, or caspase-1) (Fig.4A). At the same time, expression of the anti-apoptotic signaling enzyme, protein kinase B/Akt (Fig. 4, Akt) was dramatically diminished by KCREB. Down-regulation of Akt and up-regulation of RIP and ICE by KCREB in adipocytes was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 4B). The Atlas gene arrays contain several other apoptosis-related genes, including caspases 2, 7, and 11,bcl-2, and BAX. However, either no change in the expression of these genes was observed, or no detectable signal was present on the autoradiograms even after prolonged exposure. Although a number of factors participate in apoptotic cell death, we have examined the contribution of Akt to adipocyte survival in preliminary experiments. We have found that ectopic expression of dominant negative Akt (Akt(K179M)) or treatment of cells with the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, resulted in apoptosis of adipocytes as determined by FACS analysis (Fig. 5). The percentage of apoptotic cells with either of these two treatments reached ∼30% to 50% within 48 h, whereas no apoptotic cells were detected in populations expressing an LacZ protein. These preliminary data suggest that one mechanism by which inhibition of CREB induces apoptosis is through decreased Akt signaling.Figure 5Inhibition of PI3K/Akt signaling induces 3T3-L1 adipocyte apoptosis. Mature adipocytes were infected with adenoviral vectors (multiplicity of infection = 100) for LacZ or dominant negative Akt (Akt(K179M)) expression, or treated with 1 μm LY294002 for 48 h. The cells were gently trypsinized, fixed, and stained with propidium iodide as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cell suspensions were subjected to flow cytometric analysis on a Becton Dickinson FACScan linked to a Macintosh G3 computer, and data were analyzed with CellQuest software. Each panel shows a representative histogram of fluorescence intensity (DNA content) versus cell count. The apoptotic sub-G0/G1 region is stippled in eachpanel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The ability of KCREB to induce adipocyte apoptosis suggested that constitutively active forms of CREB might block programmed cell death. To test this concept, the Ecdysone-inducible expression system was employed to express the active CREB mutant, CREB-DIEDML, which stimulates transcription and associates with the transcriptional co-adaptor, CREB-binding protein (CBP) p300, in a phosphorylation-independent manner (28Cardinaux J.R. Notis J.C. Zhang Q. Vo N. Craig J.C. Fass D.M. Brennan R.G. Goodman R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1546-1552Google Scholar). First, we verified that the protein was expressed in response to Ponasterone A treatment by Western blot analysis (Fig. 6A). Simultaneously, we assessed the ability of CREB-DIEDML expression to drive transcription (luciferase production) from the CRE-containing,somatostatin gene promoter. We found that low doses of Ponasterone A (0.1 μm) and low levels of CREB-DIEDML elicited a 6.8-fold increase in transcription, whereas transcription levels decreased with further increases in Ponasterone A/CREB-DIEDML (Fig. 6B). The decrease in transcription levels with high CREB-DIEDML expression probably reflects transcriptional squelching due to excess transactivator levels. Having optimized CREB-DIEDML expression/activity, we tested the ability of this factor to block adipocyte apoptosis induced by TNF-α. As shown in Fig. 6C, TNF-α produced a substantial increase in the number of control cells (ectopically expressing LacZ) with condensed nuclei as determined by Hoechst staining. However, in cells expressing CREB-DIEDML, fewer condensed nuclei were evident. These cell populations were subjected to FACS analysis to quantitate the number of apoptotic cells. No apoptotic nuclei were evident in untreated control cells (Fig. 6D). The percentage of apoptotic cells in the LacZ-expressing, TNF-α-treated populations averaged 30%, whereas the percentage for CREB-DIEDML-expressing, TNF-α-treated cells averaged only 5%. In this paper we have shown that decreases in CREB activity generated by inducible, ectopic expression of KCREB and other dominant negative “CREBs” stimulate apoptosis of mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes in culture. Apoptosis was confirmed by chromatin condensation (Hoechst staining), changes in membrane morphology (retraction and blebbing), and cellular DNA degradation (subdiploid or sub-G0/G1 cells in FACS analysis). The ability of KCREB to induce adipocyte apoptosis appears to be due, in part, to the increased expression of certain pro-apoptotic genes, including RIP and ICE, and the decreased expression of the anti-apoptotic signaling enzyme, Akt. Although changes in the expression of most of these factors await confirmation, the decreased expression of Akt in response to KCREB was also noted by Western blot analysis. Finally, we demonstrated that ectopic expression of constitutively active forms of CREB partially inhibits the induction of adipocyte apoptosis in response to TNF-α exposure. Other groups have shown that insulin and IGF-1 inhibit apoptosis of adipocytes and pre-adipocytes in response to TNF-α or serum deprivation (17Qian H. Hausman D.B. Compton M.M. Martin R.J.

We have shown that these hormones stimulate CREB phosphorylation and transcriptional activity in several cell types, including 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes and adipocytes through the activation of ERK and PI3K signaling systems and through the inhibition of protein phosphatase 2A (24Pugazhenthi S.

Our current data implicate CREB as an important nuclear effector of the protective effects of insulin and IGF-1. The ability of KCREB to initiate programmed cell death in adipocytes is consistent with the role of CREB in survival/apoptosis of other cells types, its regulation of survival/apoptotic genes, and its regulation by survival-associated growth factors. This is especially true of neurons. Walton et al. (33Walton M. Woodgate A.M. Muravlev A. Xu R. During M.J. Dragunow M. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1836-1842Google Scholar) have shown that CREB overexpression and prolonged phosphorylation protects neurons from okadaic acid-induced apoptosis, and Ginty and colleagues (26Riccio A. Ahn S. Davenport C.M. Blendy J.A. Ginty D.D. Science. 1999; 286: 2358-2361Google Scholar) have shown that nerve growth factor and other neurotrophins promote neuronal survival in part through CREB activation of bcl-2 expression and other pro-survival genes. Similarly, Pugazhenthi et al. (24Pugazhenthi S. Miller E. Sable C. Young P.R. Heidenreich K.A. Boxer L.M. Reusch J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27529-27535Google Scholar, 25Pugazhenthi S. Nesterova A. Sable C. Heidenreich K.A. Boxer L.M. Heasley L.E. Reusch J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10761-10766Google Scholar) have shown that IGF-1 prevents apoptosis of PC12 cells in culture by activating CREB, which in turn increases bcl-2 expression. Interestingly, CREB levels were reduced by caspase-mediated cleavage in neuroblastoma cells undergoing apoptosis in response to staurosporine, suggesting that apoptosis is associated with a decrease in CREB that normally protects against programmed cell death (23Francois F. Godhinho M.J. Grimes M.L. FEBS Lett. 2000; 486: 281-284Google Scholar). Finally, addition of extracellular HIV-1 Tat protein to PC12 cells elicits a chronic down-regulation of CREB content and phosphorylation, and a progressive increase in apoptosis (34Zauli G. Milani D. Mirandola P. Mazzoni M. Secchiero P. Miscia S. Capitani S. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 483-491Google Scholar). This may account, partly, for the neuronal apoptosis and subsequent dementia frequently observed in HIV-infected individuals. CREB and proteins of the related activating transcription factor (ATF), cAMP-response element repressor/inducible cAMP-early repressor family of proteins also regulate survival of other cell types. For example, ectopic expression of KCREB in human melanoma cells decreases their resistance to radiation and renders them susceptible to thapsigargin-induced apoptosis, suggesting that CREB and the related ATF1 transcription factor may contribute to the acquisition of the malignant phenotype (35Jean D. Harbison M. McConkey D.J. Ronai Z. Bar-Eli M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24884-24890Google Scholar). Walker and colleagues (36Scobey M. Bertera S. Someras J. Watkins S. Zeleznik A. Walker W. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 948-954Google Scholar) have shown that introduction of the phosphorylation-deficient, dominant negative CREBm1 into seminiferous tubules disrupts spermatogenesis through the apoptosis of spermatocyte germ cells. These data indicate that CREB and related proteins play key roles in the survival and development of numerous cell types and tissues. An interesting observation in this study was the down-regulation of Akt/protein kinase B expression in KCREB-expressing adipocytes. Of the several apoptosis-related genes regulated by KCREB in our gene array analysis, we were able to confirm the regulation of Akt expression by Western blot analysis. The Akt serine/threonine-specific kinases are key mediators of cell survival in response to growth factors and calcium influx (37Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 435-437Google Scholar). Phosphorylation by Akt represses the activity of several pro-apoptotic molecules, including caspase-9, BAD, Forkhead transcription factors, and GSK-3 (38Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z.

Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 205-212Google Scholar) have shown that IGF-1 inhibits apoptosis of 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes following serum deprivation via the activation of PI3K/Akt signaling. This pathway also contributes to adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells, with agents that block this signaling system inhibiting the conversion of pre-adipocytes to adipocytes (42Xia X. Serrero G. J. Cell Physiol. 1999; 178: 9-16Google Scholar, 43Sakaue H. Ogawa W. Matsumoto M. Kuroda S. Takata M. Sugimoto T. Spiegelman B.M. Kasuga M. J. Biol.

Interestingly, we have noted elevated Akt expression in gene array experiments and by Western blot, in 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes treated with conventional differentiation-inducing agents, or inducibly expressing the constitutively active VP16-CREB or CREB-DIEDML. 2J. E. B. Reusch and D. J. Klemm, unpublished data. We have extended these results to bovine aortic smooth muscle cells in culture, wherein KCREB decreases Akt expression and induces apoptosis, but CREB-DIEDML increases Akt expression.2 Although these data are far from confirmatory, it is tempting to speculate that many of CREBs functions may be mediated via the direct regulation of Akt gene expression. We have previously demonstrated that VP16-CREB and CREB-DIEDML induce adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes, and here we show that dominant negative KCREB stimulates adipocyte apoptosis while constitutively active CREBs protect against cell death in response to TNF-α. The development of new fat cells, and the death of mature adipocytes probably play competing roles in controlling adipose tissue mass and, in turn, in regulating insulin sensitivity. This connection is frequently manifest in obese individuals who develop insulin resistance, and ultimately type II diabetes, apparently due to the overabundance of stored fat in existing adipocytes (1Spiegelman B.M. Flier J.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 377-389Google Scholar). In most cases, agents that stimulate the development of new fat cells and the redistribution of fat stores vastly improves overall insulin sensitivity (45Kletzien R.F. Clarke S.D. Ulrich R.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 393-398Google Scholar). At the other extreme, congenital and acquired lipoatrophic and lipodystrophic disorders are also commonly associated with increased insulin resistance (46Ganda O.P. Ann. Intern. Med. 2000; 133: 304-306Google Scholar, 47Hegele R.A. Curr. Atheroscler. Rep. 2000; 2: 397-404Google Scholar). The conditions reflect a loss or decreased number of fat cells that leads to insulin resistance. The participation of CREB in the generation of new fat cells and its ability to block adipocyte apoptosis suggest that CREB may be a central determinant of overall insulin sensitivity. Experiments to explore the ability of constitutively active and dominant negative CREBs to modulate adipose tissue mass and insulin responsiveness are currently underway in our laboratories. Our data indicate that CREB plays a central role in adipocyte survival, perhaps by regulating the expression of anti-apoptotic genes such as Akt. Our results not only extend the role of CREB in adipocyte biology but also highlight the general developmental and survival role of this factor in numerous cell and tissue types."

Diabete Metab. 1990; 16: 26-29Google Scholar). Other vision-threatening conditions such as hypertensive retinopathy (12Tso M.O. Jampol L.M. Ophthalmology. 1982; 89: 1132-1145Google Scholar) and age-related macular degeneration are also aggravated by hypertension (13Macular Photocoagulation Study GroupArch. Ophthalmol. 1997; 115: 741-747Google Scholar). Although the mechanisms underlying the exacerbation of these conditions by hypertension are not fully understood, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)1 has been strongly implicated as a primary mediator of ocular complications in diabetes and age-related macular degeneration. VEGF is a hypoxia-induced, endothelial cell-selective mitogen (14Shweiki D. Itin A. Soffer D. Keshet E. Nature. 1992; 359: 843-845Google Scholar, 15Shweiki D. Itin A. Neufeld G. Gitay-Goren H.

Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 1774-1778Google Scholar). VEGF is the principal stimuli for intraocular neovascularization and retinal vascular permeability in diabetic retinopathy, retinal vein occlusion, retinopathy of prematurity, age-related macular degeneration, and numerous other conditions (18Aiello L.P.

Sci. 1999; 40: 3287-3291Google Scholar). Recently we reported that mechanical stretch induced expression of VEGF and its receptors in retinal endothelial cells (36Suzuma I. Hata Y. Clermont A. Pokras F. Rook S.L. Suzuma K. Feener E.P. Aiello L.P. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 444-454Google Scholar) and demonstrated that retinal expression of VEGF and VEGF-R2 was increased during hypertension in vivo. The molecular mechanisms underlying stretch-induced VEGF expression have not been studied extensively. Stretch rapidly activates a plethora of second messenger pathways including tyrosine kinases, p21ras, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), S6 kinase, protein kinase C (PKC), phospholipases C and D, and the P450 pathway (37Ishida T. Takahashi M. Corson M.A. Berk B.C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1997; 811: 12-23Google Scholar, 38Sadoshima J. Izumo S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1681-1692Google Scholar). Mechanical stretch can also regulate protein synthesis and the activity of numerous factors including NO (39Ziegler T. Silacci P. Harrison V.J. Hayoz D.

Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27509-27512Google Scholar) PKC-ζ has been implicated in the regulation of VEGF expression (49Pal S. Claffey K.P. Cohen H.T. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol.

PKC-ζ is an atypical isoform lacking the Ca2+binding C2 domain and with only one cysteine-rich zinc finger-like motif in the diacylglycerol binding C1 domain (51Ono Y. Fujii T. Ogita K. Kikkawa U. Igarashi K. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3099-3103Google Scholar). Thus, PKC-ζ does not bind Ca2+ and is not activated by diacylglycerol or phorbol esters (52Nakanishi H. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16347-16354Google Scholar). PKC-ζ is activated by several lipid mediators including phosphatidic acid (52Nakanishi H. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16347-16354Google Scholar) and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (53Nakanishi H. Brewer K.A. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13-16Google Scholar). Nevertheless, PKC-ζ activity is important in mitogenesis, protein synthesis, cell survival, and regulation of transcription (54Berra E. Diaz-Meco M.T. Dominguez I. Municio M.M. Sanz L. Lozano J. Chapkin R.S. Moscat J. Cell. 1993; 74: 555-563Google Scholar, 55Chou M.M. Hou W. Johnson J. Graham L.K. Lee M.H. Chen C.S. Newton A.C. Schaffhausen B.S. Toker A. Curr.

Chem. 1998; 273: 26277-26280Google Scholar) is dependent upon PKC-ζ and subsequent ERK1/2 activation. Ras-induced VEGF expression in human fibrosarcoma and renal cell carcinoma cell lines is almost totally dependent on PKC-ζ activity, which is mediated through both Raf-dependent and Raf-independent pathways (56Pal S. Datta K. Khosravi-Far R. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2395-2403Google Scholar). PKC-ζ has also been reported to mediate the downstream proliferative effect of VEGF (58Wellner M. Maasch C. Kupprion C. Lindschau C. Luft F.C. Haller H. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 178-185Google Scholar). In this study, we examined the molecular mechanism of stretch-induced VEGF expression in retinal cells. These data are the first to demonstrate that stretch-induced VEGF expression is mediated by phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase and PKC-ζ in a manner independent of ERK1/2, Akt, or Ras. Thus, stretch-induced VEGF expression may be distinct from other pathways mediating VEGF expression, and theoretically, PI 3-kinase and PKC-ζ inhibitors may have therapeutic benefit in ameliorating the well documented exacerbation of ocular diseases by concomitant hypertension.

Primary cultures of bovine retinal pericytes (BRPCs) were isolated by homogenization and a series of filtration steps as described previously (59King G.L. Goodman A.D. Buzney S. Moses A. Kahn C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 75: 1028-1036Google Scholar). BRPCs were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5.5 mm glucose and 20% fetal bovine serum. The cells were maintained in 5% CO2 at 37 °C, and media were changed every 3 days. Cells were characterized for their homogeneity by immunoreactivity with monoclonal antibody 3G5 (60Nayak R.C. Berman A.B. George K.L. Eisenbarth G.S. King G.L. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1595-1601Google Scholar). Cells were plated at a density of 2 × 104 cells/cm2 and passaged when confluent. The media were changed every 3 days, and only cells from passages 2–5 were used for experiments. cDNA of constitutively active Akt (ca Akt; Gag protein fused to the N terminus of wild type Akt) was constructed as described previously (61Burgering B.M. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Google Scholar). cDNA of dominant negative Akt (mt Akt) was constructed by substituting Thr-308 to Ala and Ser-473 to Ala as described previously (62Kitamura T.

Hellbert K. Kampfer S. Maly K. Villunger A. Spitaler M. Mwanjewe J. Baier-Bitterlich G. Baier G. Grunicke H.H. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 413-425Google Scholar). The recombinant adenoviruses were constructed by homologous recombination between the parental virus genome and the expression cosmid cassette or shuttle vector as described previously (68He T.C.

Adenovirus was applied at a concentration of 1 × 108 plaque-forming units/ml, and adenovirus with the same parental genome carryingLacZ gene or enhanced green fluorescent protein gene (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) were used as controls. Expression of each recombinant protein was confirmed by Western blot analysis, and expression was increased ∼10-fold with all constructs as compared with cells infected with control adenovirus. Cells were plated on six-well flexible-bottom culture plates coated with collagen (Flexcell Corp., Mckeepsport, PA). After 2 days, media were changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% calf serum, and the cells were incubated overnight. Cells were then subjected to uniform radial and circumferential strain in 5% CO2 at 37 °C using a computer-controlled, vacuum stretch apparatus (Flexcer Cell Strain Unit; Flexcell Corp.). A physiologic stretch frequency of 60 cpm and 3–20% prolongation of elastomer-bottomed plates were used as described previously (36Suzuma I. Hata Y. Clermont A. Pokras F. Rook S.L. Suzuma K. Feener E.P. Aiello L.P. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 444-454Google Scholar). RNA was extracted using the guanidinium thiocyanate method. RNA purity was determined by the ratio of optical density (OD) measured at 260 and 280 nm, and RNA quantity was estimated using OD measured at 260 nm. Northern blot analysis was performed on 15 μg of total RNA/lane after 1% agarose, 2 mformaldehyde gel electrophoresis and subsequent capillary transfer to Biodyne nylon membranes (Pall BioSupport, East Hills, NY). Membranes underwent ultraviolet cross-linking using a UV Stratalinker 2400 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Radioactive probes were generated using Megaprime labeling kits (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) and [32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Blots were prehybridized, hybridized, and washed four times in 0.5× SSC, 5% SDS at 65 °C for 1 h in a rotating hybridization oven (Robbins Scientific Corp., Sunnyvale, CA). All signals were analyzed using a computing PhosphorImager with ImageQuant software analysis (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The signal for each sample was normalized by reprobing the same blot using 36B4 cDNA control probe. BRPCs were cultured as indicated above and exposed to 9%/60 cpm mechanical stretch for 4 h. Actinomycin D (5 μg/ml) was added, and RNA was isolated 0, 2, and 4 h later. Northern blot analysis of these samples was performed and quantitated as described above. BRPCs were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 1× Laemmli buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol) containing protease inhibitors (10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Protein concentrations were determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay. Total cell lysate (30 μg) was subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, and proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). The blots were incubated with primary antibodies followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Visualization was performed using the Amersham Biosciences, Inc. enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (ECL) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 1× Laemmli buffer containing protease inhibitors as described above. Cell lysates were heated to 95 °C for 2 min, and equal volumes of lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. The blots were incubated with anti-phospho-specific ERK1(p44)/ERK2(p42) or anti-phospho-specific Akt antibody (New England Biolabs). Lane loading differences were normalized by reblotting with nonphosphorylation-specific (total) anti-ERK1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) or anti-Akt (total) antibody (New England Biolabs). PI 3-kinase activity was measured byin vitro phosphorylation of PI (70Xia P. Aiello L.P. Ishii H. Jiang Z.Y. Park D.J. Robinson G.S. Takagi H. Newsome W.P. Jirousek M.R. King G.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2018-2026Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 2 mmNa3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 2 mmEDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. PI 3-kinase was immunoprecipitated from aliquots of the supernatant with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. After washing, the pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA. 10 μl of 100 mm MgCl2 and 10 μl of PI (2 μg/μl) sonicated in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5) with 1 mm EGTA was added to each pellet. The PI 3-kinase reaction was initiated by the addition of 5 μl of 0.5 mm ATP containing 30 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. After 10 min at room temperature with constant shaking, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 20 μl of 8 n HCl and 160 μl of chloroform:methanol (1:1). The samples were centrifuged, and the organic phase was removed and applied to silica gel TLC plates developing in CHCl3:CH3OH:H2O:NH4OH (60:47:11:2). The radioactive spots were quantitated by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). PKC-ζ activity was measured as described previously (71Takeda H. Matozaki T. Takada T. Noguchi T. Yamao T. Tsuda M. Ochi F. Fukunaga K. Inagaki K. Kasuga M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 386-395Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed in 0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 20 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with polyclonal antibodies against PKC-ζ. The immunocomplexes were incubated at 30 °C for 15 min in 50 μl of kinase assay mixture containing 35 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 40 μm ATP, 0.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 30 μm PKC-ε pseudosubstrate peptide (BIOSOURCE, Camarillo, CA). Aliquots of reaction mixtures were spotted on p81 filter paper (Whatman) and washed with 75 mm phosphoric acid. The radioactivity incorporated into phosphorylated substrate proteins was quantitated by scintillation counting. All experiments were repeated at least three times unless otherwise indicated. Results are expressed as mean ± S.D. Statistical analysis used Student's ttest or analysis of variance to compare quantitative data populations with normal distributions and equal variance. Data were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney rank sum test or the Kruskal-Wallis test for populations with non-normal distributions or unequal variance. Ap value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Confluent cultures of BRPCs were subjected to a single instance of 5 or 20% static stretch for the durations indicated in Fig. 1A. Static stretch (20%) maximally increased VEGF mRNA expression 2.2-fold after 3 h (p = 0.048). VEGF mRNA levels gradually declined thereafter returning to baseline values after 6 h. VEGF mRNA expression was increased 15 ± 22%, 116 ± 50% (p = 0.048), 90 ± 62%, and −4 ± 23% after 1, 3, 6, and 9 h, respectively. VEGF mRNA expression in response to 5% static stretch was less pronounced with a tendency to increase within the first 3 h; however, this change was not statistically significant. The vasculature in vivo is continually exposed to repetitive stretch with pressure dynamics reflecting the cardiac cycle. To approximate this physiologically relevant condition, we evaluated whether cardiac profile cyclic stretch altered VEGF mRNA expression in BRPCs undergoing 9 and 3% cyclic stretch at a rate of 60 cpm with a dynamic stress contour reflecting that of the normal cardiac cycle. As shown in Fig. 1B, cardiac cycle cyclic stretch increased VEGF mRNA expression in a time- and dose-dependent manner. At 9% cyclic stretch, an increase in KDR mRNA expression was initially evident after 1 h, which continued to increase even after 9 h when expression was 3.1 ± 0.2-fold greater than in control cells (p < 0.001). VEGF mRNA expression was increased 37 ± 15%, 136 ± 25% (p < 0.001), 168 ± 10% (p < 0.001), and 206 ± 17% (p < 0.001) after 1, 3, 6, and 9 h of cyclic stretch, respectively. Cyclic stretch of 3% also increased VEGF mRNA expression, although to a reduced extent with only a 1.7 ± 0.6-fold increase observed after 9 h. To determine whether stretch-induced VEGF mRNA expression resulted in increased VEGF protein levels, cells were exposed to 9% stretch at 60 cpm for 12 h. Cell lysates were evaluated by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2A). VEGF protein expression was increased 2.7 ± 1.0-fold (p = 0.002) as compared with control cells. Since stretch-induced mRNA expression could be the result of alterations in gene transcription or mRNA stability, BRPCs were exposed to 9%/60 cpm cyclic stretch for 4 h and then treated with 5 mg/ml actinomycin D, and RNA was harvested 2 and 4 h later (Fig.2B). VEGF mRNA concentration declined at an equivalent rate in both control and stretched cells, suggesting that transcriptional regulation, rather than changes in mRNA stability, was primarily responsib"
https://openalex.org/W2068740605,"CEACAM1, a tumor suppressor (previously known as pp120), is a plasma membrane protein that undergoes phosphorylation on Tyr488 in its cytoplasmic tail by the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase. Co-expression of CEACAM1 with insulin receptors decreased cell growth in response to insulin. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments in intact NIH 3T3 cells and glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays revealed that phosphorylated Tyr488 in CEACAM1 binds to the SH2 domain of Shc, another substrate of the insulin receptor. Overexpressing Shc SH2 domain relieved endogenous Shc from binding to CEACAM1 and restored MAP kinase activity, growth of cells in response to insulin, and their colonization in soft agar. Thus, by binding to Shc, CEACAM1 sequesters this major coupler of Grb2 to the insulin receptor and down-regulates the Ras/MAP kinase mitogenesis pathway. Additionally, CEACAM1 binding to Shc enhances its ability to compete with IRS-1 for phosphorylation by the insulin receptor. This leads to a decrease in IRS-1 binding to phosphoinositide 3′-kinase and to the down-regulation of the phosphoinositide 3′-kinase/Akt pathway that mediates cell proliferation and survival. Thus, binding to Shc appears to constitute a major mechanism for the down-regulatory effect of CEACAM1 on cell proliferation. CEACAM1, a tumor suppressor (previously known as pp120), is a plasma membrane protein that undergoes phosphorylation on Tyr488 in its cytoplasmic tail by the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase. Co-expression of CEACAM1 with insulin receptors decreased cell growth in response to insulin.

Phosphorylation of different substrates is required to mediate the diverse effects of hormones on metabolism and growth (4Araki E. Lipes M.A. Patti M.E. Bruning J.C. Haag B.R. Johnson R.S. Kahn C.R.

Williams L.T. Science. 1994; 266: 1862-1865Google Scholar). Activation of receptors causes redistribution of Shc from the perinuclear region to the cytosolic site of the plasma membrane (8Lotti L.V. Lanfrancone L. Migliaccio E. Zompetta C. Pelicci G. Salcini A.E. Falini B. Pelicci P.G. Torrisi M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1946-1954Google Scholar). The tyrosine kinase receptors that phosphorylate Shc include insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) receptors (2Pronk G.J. McGlade J. Pelicci G. Pawson T. Bos J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5748-5753Google Scholar, 9Skolnik E.Y. Batzer A. Li N. Lee C.H. Lowenstein E. Mohammadi M. Margolis B. Schlessinger J. Science. 1993; 260: 1953-1955Google Scholar). The Shc family of proteins consists of three isoforms. p46/p52 that are ubiquitously expressed are the products of the same transcript and result from alternative usage of two in-frame ATGs. In contrast, p66 that is mostly expressed in epithelial cells is translated from a different transcript (10Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Grignani F. McGlade J. Cavallo F. Forni G. Nicoletti I. Pawson T. Pelicci P.G. Cell. 1992; 70: 93-104Google Scholar, 11Migliaccio E. Mele S. Salcini A.E. Pelicci G. Lai K.M. Superti-Furga G. Di Pawson T. Fiore P.P. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 706-716Google Scholar). The three isoforms have overlapping domains as follows: an SH2 domain at the C terminus, an adjacent glycine/proline-rich collagen homology (CH1) domain, and a phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain in the N terminus of p46/p52. p66Shc contains an additional collagen homology (CH2) domain at its N terminus end.By binding to other signaling proteins, Shc exerts many effects on the cell. Upon its phosphorylation on Tyr317 in the CH1 domain by the insulin receptor, Shc binds to the SH2 domain of Grb2 and couples it to the receptor (12Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-579Google Scholar, 13Wolf G. Trub T. Ottinger E. Groninga L. Lynch A. White M.F. Miyazaki M. Lee J. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27407-27410Google Scholar). This leads to the association of Grb2 with the Son of Sevenless Ras GDP/GTP exchanger, causing translocation of Son of Sevenless to the plasma membrane in proximity to its p21ras substrate (14Gale N.W. Kaplan S. Lowenstein E.J. Schlessinger J. Bar-Sagi D. Nature. 1993; 363: 88-92Google Scholar), activation of the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) pathway, and regulation of cell growth, differentiation, and proliferation in response to insulin and other growth factors. Shc also interacts with adaptins to play a role in growth factor endocytosis (15Okabayashi Y. Sugimoto Y. Totty N.F. Hsuan J. Kido Y. Sakaguchi K.M. Gout I. Waterfield M.D. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5265-5269Google Scholar). It also binds to cadherins to regulate the role of these proteins in cell-cell adhesion and cell morphogenesis (16Takeichi M. Science. 1991; 251: 1451-1455Google Scholar, 17Xu Y. Guo D.F. Davidson M. Inagami T. Carpenter G. J. Biol.

Cell. 1998; 94: 625-634Google Scholar).Members of the IRS family do not contain SH2 domains but transmit insulin signaling by forming complexes via their multiple phosphotyrosine-containing binding motifs with SH2 domains in signaling molecules such as the growth factor receptor-binding protein (Grb2) (19Lowenstein E.J.

Hu P. Margolis B. Skolnik E. Schlessinger J. White M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3469-3479Google Scholar). Coupling of PI-3 kinase to the insulin receptor by the IRS proteins activates downstream signaling molecules like Akt and p70 ribosomal protein 6 kinase (p70 S6 kinase). Akt activation promotes cell growth and proliferation (23Medema R.H. Kops G.J. Bos J.L. Burgering B.M. Nature. 2000; 404: 782-787Google Scholar, 24Zhou B.P. Liao Y. Xia W. Spohn B. Lee M.H. Hung M.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 245-252Google Scholar) in addition to mediating anti-apoptosis and cell survival (25Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Google Scholar, 26Khwaja A. Nature. 1999; 401: 33-34Google Scholar). Activation of p70 S6 kinase mediates the mitogenic effects of insulin in many cell types, including hepatocytes (27Kimura M. Ogihara M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 327: 87-95Google Scholar).Among insulin-targeted tissues, CEACAM1 is only expressed in liver. It is a plasma membrane glycoprotein of Mr∼120,000. The rat protein is expressed as two spliced variants differing by the inclusion (CEACAM1–4L) or exclusion (CEACAM1–4S) of a 61-amino acid segment in the C terminus of its cytoplasmic domain (28Najjar S.M. Accili D. Philippe N. Jernberg J. Margolis R. Taylor S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1201-1206Google Scholar). The truncated isoform lacks all phosphorylation sites. Site-directed mutagenesis in NIH 3T3 cells revealed that CEACAM1 is constitutively phosphorylated on Ser503 and that this phosphorylation is required for its phosphorylation on the Tyr488 residue by the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase (1Najjar S.M. Philippe N. Suzuki Y. Ignacio G.A. Formisano P. Accili D. Taylor S.I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9341-9349Google Scholar).The function of CEACAM1 remains elusive. It may function as a tumor suppressor in breast, colon, bladder, liver, and prostate (29Neumaier M. Paululat S. Chan A. Matthaes P. Wagener C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10744-10748Google Scholar, 30Thompson N.L. Lin S.H. Panzica M.A. Hixson D.C. Pathobiology. 1994; 62: 209-220Google Scholar, 31Luo W. Wood C.G. Earley K. Hung M.C. Lin S.H.

Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2781-2788Google Scholar) and as a down-regulator of the mitogenic action of insulin (33Formisano P. Najjar S.M. Gross C.N. Philippe N. Oriente F. Kern B.C. Accili D. Gorden P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24073-24077Google Scholar, 34Soni P. Lakkis M. Poy M.N. Fernstrom M.A. Najjar S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3896-3905Google Scholar). CEACAM1 may up-regulate the transport of bile acids and insulin (33Formisano P. Najjar S.M. Gross C.N. Philippe N. Oriente F. Kern B.C. Accili D. Gorden P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24073-24077Google Scholar,35Li Calzi S. Choice C.V. Najjar S.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: E801-E808Google Scholar) in the hepatocyte. Supportive evidence for a role of CEACAM1 in cell adhesion has also emerged (36Edlund M. Öbrink B. FEBS Lett. 1993; 327: 90-94Google Scholar, 37Sadekova S. Lamarche-Vane N. Li X. Beauchemin N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 65-77Google Scholar).The basic mechanism of CEACAM1 functions is not completely understood. However, CEACAM1 phosphorylation is required for its function in bile acid and insulin transport (38Choice C.V. Howard M.J. Poy M.N. Hankin M.H. Najjar S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22194-22200Google Scholar, 39Najjar S.M. Choice C.V. Soni P. Whitman C.M. Poy M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12923-12928Google Scholar) and in tumor suppression (40Luo W. Earley K. Tantingco V. Hixson D.C. Liang T.C. Lin S.H. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1141-1147Google Scholar). Failure of phosphorylation-defective CEACAM1 mutants to decrease cell growth in response to insulin suggested that CEACAM1 phosphorylation is required for its down-regulatory effect on insulin mitogenesis (33Formisano P. Najjar S.M. Gross C.N. Philippe N. Oriente F. Kern B.C. Accili D. Gorden P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24073-24077Google Scholar). This was further supported by the observation that CEACAM1 failed to down-regulate growth of cells overexpressing IGF-1 receptors that do not phosphorylate CEACAM1 (34Soni P. Lakkis M. Poy M.N. Fernstrom M.A. Najjar S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3896-3905Google Scholar, 41Najjar S.M. Blakesley V.A. Calzi S.L. Kato H. LeRoith D. Choice C.V. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6827-6834Google Scholar).Because sequences flanking Tyr488 of CEACAM1 (Tyr-Ser-Val-Leu) closely resemble binding sites of Shc SH2 domains from several proteins with important functions in the immune system, human CD3 γ and δ chain (Tyr-Ser-His-Leu), the human CD3 ζ chain (Tyr-Asp-Val-Leu), the mouse CD3 ε chain (Tyr-Ser-Gly-Leu), and the mouse Ig ε receptor b (Tyr-Ser-Glu-Leu) (42Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. McGlade J. Olivier P. Pawson T. Bustelo X.R. Barbacid M. Sabe H. Hanafusa H. Yi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2777-2785Google Scholar), it is possible that phosphorylated CEACAM1 binds to Shc. Co-immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays revealed that insulin stimulates binding of phosphorylated Tyr488 in CEACAM1 to the SH2 domain of Shc. Overexpressing the Shc SH2 domain in NIH 3T3 cells transfected with CEACAM1 released endogenous Shc proteins from the CEACAM1 complex and restored cell growth and MAP kinase activity in response to insulin. This suggests that by binding to Shc, CEACAM1 sequesters it and limits Grb2 coupling to the insulin receptor. Additionally, this binding increases the ability of Shc to compete with IRS-1 for phosphorylation by the insulin receptor in light of the fact that this event requires an intact Tyr960 in the juxtamembrane domain of the receptor (43Kaburagi Y. Momomura K. Yamamoto H.R. Tobe K. Tamori Y. Sakura H. Akanuma Y. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16610-16622Google Scholar, 44Gustafson T.A. He W. Craparo A. Schaub C.D. O'Neill T.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2500-2508Google Scholar), as opposed to that of CEACAM1 which requires an intact Tyr1316 in the C terminus of the β-subunit of the receptor (34Soni P. Lakkis M. Poy M.N. Fernstrom M.A. Najjar S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3896-3905Google Scholar). Decreased IRS-1 phosphorylation leads to down-regulation of the PI-3 kinase/Akt mitogenesis pathway in cells co-expressing CEACAM1. Thus, it appears that Shc binding underlies the down-regulatory effect of CEACAM1 on cell growth and proliferation.DISCUSSIONCEACAM1, a substrate of the insulin receptor kinase, decreases the mitogenic action of insulin. This effect requires its phosphorylation by the receptor (33Formisano P. Najjar S.M. Gross C.N. Philippe N. Oriente F. Kern B.C. Accili D. Gorden P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24073-24077Google Scholar, 34Soni P. Lakkis M. Poy M.N. Fernstrom M.A. Najjar S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3896-3905Google Scholar). The current studies reveal that CEACAM1 phosphorylation increases its association with Shc and that this association mediates its down-regulation of insulin mitogenesis.Because the β-subunit of the insulin receptor does not directly bind to CEACAM1 (38Choice C.V. Howard M.J. Poy M.N. Hankin M.H. Najjar S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22194-22200Google Scholar), its detection in the CEACAM1/GST-Shc precipitate suggests that Shc binding to CEACAM1 does not interfere with its binding to the receptor. Instead, it mediates the indirect association between the receptor and CEACAM1. This is consistent with Shc binding to phosphorylated Tyr488 of CEACAM1 at its SH2 domain and to Tyr960 in the juxtamembrane domain of the insulin receptor at its PTB domain. Thus, Shc may function as one of the adaptor proteins that mediate the indirect association between CEACAM1 and the insulin receptor (38Choice C.V. Howard M.J. Poy M.N. Hankin M.H. Najjar S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22194-22200Google Scholar, 39Najjar S.M. Choice C.V. Soni P. Whitman C.M. Poy M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12923-12928Google Scholar).Like CEACAM1, cadherins (17Xu Y. Guo D.F. Davidson M. Inagami T. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13463-13466Google Scholar, 48Xu Y. Carpenter G. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 75: 264-271Google Scholar) and Gab2 (66) interact with Shc at its SH2 domain. Epidermal growth factor and interleukin-3 receptors bind to both the SH2 and PTB domains of Shc (49Bone H. Welham M.J. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 183-194Google Scholar, 50Sakaguchi K. Okabayashi Y. Kido Y. Kimura S. Matsumura Y. Inushima K. Kasuga M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 536-543Google Scholar). The expression level of these signaling molecules in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts is not significant. Thus, overexpressing Shc SH2 domain in these cells is not expected to alter their signaling pathways, consistent with the observation that overexpressing Shc SH2 domain in NIH 3T3 cells transfected with insulin receptors alone did not alter their growth (Fig. 5A). This is in agreement with results obtained by microinjecting Rat1 fibroblasts with this domain (51Sasaoka T. Draznin B. Leitner J.W. Langlois W.J. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10734-10738Google Scholar, 52Sasaoka T. Rose D.W. Jhun B.H. Saltiel A.R. Draznin B. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13689-13694Google Scholar). Thus, the cellular changes observed upon overexpressing the Shc SH2 domain in CEACAM1-transfected NIH 3T3 cells would be chiefly attributed to the ability of this domain to specifically alter CEACAM1 binding to endogenous Shc proteins. Restoring growth of CEACAM1-transfected cells by overexpressing the SH2 domain of Shc (Fig. 5A) suggests that Shc binding mediates the down-regulatory effect of CEACAM1 on cell growth in response to insulin.We herein report that CEACAM1 binding to Shc down-regulates the Ras/MAP kinase pathway by sequestering Shc and decreasing the efficiency of Grb2 coupling to the insulin receptor (Fig. 6A). Additionally, CEACAM1 binding to Shc was correlated with decreased IRS-1 phosphorylation (Fig. 6C). Because phosphorylation of Shc and IRS proteins is regulated by Tyr960 in the juxtamembrane domain of the insulin receptor, it is conceivable that the two proteins compete for phosphorylation by the receptor, as suggested by previous observations in Rat1 fibroblasts (53Ishihara H. Sasaoka T. Ishiki M. Takata Y. Imamura T. Usui I. Langlois W.J. Sawa T. Kobayashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9581-9586Google Scholar). Because the cytoplasmic tail of CEACAM1 is short (71 aa), its binding to Shc may prolong the localization of this otherwise perinuclear protein in the vicinity of the plasma membrane and increase its ability to compete with IRS-1 for Tyr960 in the insulin receptor. This reduces IRS-1 phosphorylation (Fig. 6C) and its ability to couple Grb2 to the insulin receptor and activate the Ras/MAP kinase pathway (Fig. 6B) in addition to decreasing the association between IRS-1 and the p85 subunit of PI-3 kinase and down-regulating the PI-3 kinase/Akt pathway (Fig. 7). Additionally, by recruiting Shc to the vicinity of the membrane, CEACAM1 enhances the availability of Shc to compete with the p85 subunit of PI-3 kinase for its binding to Tyr608 in IRS-1, the main site of p85 binding to IRS-1 (54Sun X.J. Crimmins D.L. Myers M.J. Miralpeix M. White M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7418-7428Google Scholar). This would down-regulate the PI-3 kinase/Akt pathway (55Kasus-Jacobi A. Perdereau D. Tartare-Deckert S. Van Obberghen E. Girard J. Burnol A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17166-17170Google Scholar). Similarly, Shc competes with IRS-1 for binding at a single residue in Ret tyrosine kinase receptor to down-regulate Ret-mediated activation of the PI-3 kinase/Akt pathway (56Melillo R.M. De Carlomagno F. Vita G. Formisano P. Vecchio G. Fusco A. Billaud M. Santoro M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 209-218Google Scholar). Even though the Ras/MAP kinase pathway constitutes the main mechanism of cell proliferation in response to insulin, the PI-3 kinase pathway also plays an important role in this event (57Chuang L.M. Myers M.J. Backer J.M. Shoelson S.E. White M.F. Birnbaum M.J. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6653-6660Google Scholar, 58Jhun B.H. Meinkoth J.L. Leitner J.W. Draznin B. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5699-5704Google Scholar). Thus, the association between CEACAM1 and Shc appears to alter the two pathways leading to cell growth in response to insulin.We have shown previously that co-transfecting NIH 3T3 cells with CEACAM1 decreased thymidine uptake as compared with cells expressing insulin receptors alone (33Formisano P. Najjar S.M. Gross C.N. Philippe N. Oriente F. Kern B.C. Accili D. Gorden P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24073-24077Google Scholar). Thus, CEACAM1 expression is correlated with decreased DNA synthesis and slower cell cycle progression. Because CEACAM1 expression down-regulates the PI-3 kinase/Akt pathway (Fig. 7) that plays a key role in mediating the anti-apoptotic effect of insulin, it is possible that CEACAM1 expression is also associated with increased cell death. This possibility warrants further investigation.It has been suggested that CEACAM1 acts as a tumor suppressor in tissues of epithelial origin and that its intracellular domain is required for this function (40Luo W. Earley K. Tantingco V. Hixson D.C. Liang T.C. Lin S.H. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1141-1147Google Scholar). In these studies, we observed that CEACAM1 expression decreased colonization of NIH 3T3 cells in soft agar and that overexpressing the Shc SH2 domain reversed this effect (Fig.5C). Moreover, CEACAM1 appears to bind specifically to p46/p52Shc that are able to transform NIH 3T3 cellsin vitro (11Migliaccio E. Mele S. Salcini A.E. Pelicci G. Lai K.M. Superti-Furga G. Di Pawson T. Fiore P.P. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 706-716Google Scholar). This suggests that Shc binding may be implicated in the molecular basis of the tumor suppression function of CEACAM1.Like CEACAM1, other cell adhesion molecules such as cadherins bind the SH2 domain of Shc at phosphorylated tyrosines in their intracellular tail (17Xu Y. Guo D.F. Davidson M. Inagami T. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13463-13466Google Scholar, 48Xu Y. Carpenter G. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 75: 264-271Google Scholar). Both cadherins and CEACAM1 mediate homophilic cell-cell adhesion even though cadherins require calcium for this function and CEACAM1 does not (16Takeichi M. Science. 1991; 251: 1451-1455Google Scholar, 36Edlund M. Öbrink B. FEBS Lett. 1993; 327: 90-94Google Scholar). Interestingly, the cytoplasmic tail of cadherins is linked to actin filaments via catenins (59Ozawa M. Ringwald M. Kemler R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4246-4250Google Scholar). Actin binding to the cadherin-catenin complex and Shc interaction with cadherins promote cell adhesiveness (17Xu Y. Guo D.F. Davidson M. Inagami T. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13463-13466Google Scholar, 59Ozawa M. Ringwald M. Kemler R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4246-4250Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic tail of CEACAM1 associates with the actin cytoskeleton through yet unidentified molecules that do not included catenins (37Sadekova S. Lamarche-Vane N. Li X. Beauchemin N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 65-77Google Scholar). Because Shc association regulates the adhesion function of cadherins, it is reasonable to speculate that it is involved in the complex formation between CEACAM1 and actin filaments and that this association mediates the tumor suppression function of CEACAM1.Down-regulation of the Ras/MAP kinase pathway by other signaling molecules has been reported. These include SHIP2 in skeletal muscle (60Ishihara H. Sasaoka T. Hori H. Wada T. Hirai H. Haruta T. Langlois W.J. Kobayashi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 265-272Google Scholar). However, the basic mechanism of the down-regulatory effect of SHIP on the mitogenic action of insulin involves competition with Grb2 for binding phosphorylated Tyr317 in the CH1 domain of Shc (49Bone H. Welham M.J. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 183-194Google Scholar). Because CEACAM1 is expressed in liver and SHIP2 in skeletal muscle, the different mechanisms invoked by these molecules to reduce Shc coupling of Grb2 to the insulin receptor suggests that the effect of Shc is tightly regulated by multiple tissue-specific signaling mechanisms.CEACAM1 also associates with SHP-2 phosphatase (61Huber M. Izzi L. Grondin P. Houde C. Kunath T. Veillette A. Beauchemin N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 335-344Google Scholar). Like Shc, SHP-2 couples Grb2 to the insulin receptor, albeit at much lower extent. Thus, it is possible that similarly to Shc, binding of CEACAM1 sequesters SHP-2 and down-regulates cell growth and proliferation in response to insulin.In these studies, we propose that CEACAM1 provides an alternative signaling pathway that modulates the biologic action of insulin. An extension of our hypothesis is that abnormal CEACAM1 expression is associated with abnormal growth and development. Further studies are required to explore this possibility. Insulin binding to its receptor activates its tyrosine kinase to cause phosphorylation of the receptor and of endogenous substrates, including CEACAM1 (previously known as pp120) (1Najjar S.M. Philippe N. Suzuki Y. Ignacio G.A. Formisano P. Accili D. Taylor S.I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9341-9349Google Scholar), insulin receptor substrate proteins (IRS-1–4),1 Shc (2Pronk G.J. McGlade J.

Phosphorylation of different substrates is required to mediate the diverse effects of hormones on metabolism and growth (4Araki E. Lipes M.A. Patti M.E. Bruning J.C. Haag B.R. Johnson R.S. Kahn C.R.

Shc is a Src homology 2 (SH2)-containing cytoplasmic adaptor protein that undergoes phosphorylation by receptors of the tyrosine kinase family (7Kavanaugh W.M. Williams L.T. Science. 1994; 266: 1862-1865Google Scholar). Activation of receptors causes redistribution of Shc from the perinuclear region to the cytosolic site of the plasma membrane (8Lotti L.V. Lanfrancone L. Migliaccio E. Zompetta C. Pelicci G. Salcini A.E. Falini B. Pelicci P.G. Torrisi M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1946-1954Google Scholar). The tyrosine kinase receptors that phosphorylate Shc include insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) receptors (2Pronk G.J. McGlade J. Pelicci G. Pawson T. Bos J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5748-5753Google Scholar, 9Skolnik E.Y. Batzer A. Li N. Lee C.H. Lowenstein E. Mohammadi M. Margolis B. Schlessinger J. Science. 1993; 260: 1953-1955Google Scholar). The Shc family of proteins consists of three isoforms. p46/p52 that are ubiquitously expressed are the products of the same transcript and result from alternative usage of two in-frame ATGs. In contrast, p66 that is mostly expressed in epithelial cells is translated from a different transcript (10Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Grignani F. McGlade J. Cavallo F. Forni G. Nicoletti I. Pawson T. Pelicci P.G. Cell. 1992; 70: 93-104Google Scholar, 11Migliaccio E. Mele S. Salcini A.E. Pelicci G. Lai K.M. Superti-Furga G. Di Pawson T. Fiore P.P. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 706-716Google Scholar). The three isoforms have overlapping domains as follows: an SH2 domain at the C terminus, an adjacent glycine/proline-rich collagen homology (CH1) domain, and a phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain in the N terminus of p46/p52. p66Shc contains an additional collagen homology (CH2) domain at its N terminus end. By binding to other signaling proteins, Shc exerts many effects on the cell. Upon its phosphorylation on Tyr317 in the CH1 domain by the insulin receptor, Shc binds to the SH2 domain of Grb2 and couples it to the receptor (12Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-579Google Scholar, 13Wolf G. Trub T. Ottinger E. Groninga L. Lynch A. White M.F. Miyazaki M. Lee J. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27407-27410Google Scholar). This leads to the association of Grb2 with the Son of Sevenless Ras GDP/GTP exchanger, causing translocation of Son of Sevenless to the plasma membrane in proximity to its p21ras substrate (14Gale N.W.

Shc also interacts with adaptins to play a role in growth factor endocytosis (15Okabayashi Y. Sugimoto Y. Totty N.F. Hsuan J. Kido Y. Sakaguchi K.M. Gout I. Waterfield M.D. Kasuga M. J. Biol.

We obtained high signal-to-noise ratio emission lines of the cometary NH2 bands from which an ortho-to-para ratio (OPR) of 3.33 +/- 0.07 was derived on the basis of a fluorescence excitation model. Assuming that cometary NH2 mainly originates from ammonia through photodissociation, the derived OPR of NH2 molecules should reflect that of ammonia, which provides information on the environment of molecular formation or condensation and of the thermal history of cometary ices. Assuming that the OPR of ammonia in comets was unchanged in the nucleus, the derived spin temperature of ammonia (28 +/- 2 kelvin) suggests that a formation region of the cometary ammonia ice was between the orbit of Saturn and that of Uranus in the solar nebula."

The human Ca2+- and Mg2+-dependent endonuclease DNAS1L3 is inhibited by poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation in vitro, and its activation during apoptosis shows a time course similar to that of the cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1). The role of the cleavage and consequent inactivation of PARP-1 by caspase-3 in the activation of DNAS1L3 has now been investigated further both in vitro and in vivo. In an in vitro system based on purified recombinant proteins and NAD, caspase-3 prevented the inhibition of DNAS1L3 endonuclease activity by wild-type PARP-1 but not that induced by a caspase-3-resistant PARP-1 mutant. The induction by etoposide of apoptosis in human osteosarcoma cells (which were shown not to express endogenous DNAS1L3) was accompanied by internucleosomal DNA fragmentation only after transfection of the cells with a plasmid encoding DNAS1L3. This DNA fragmentation in etoposide-treated cells was blocked by 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)-ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, an inhibitor of intracellular Ca2+ release. Expression of the endonuclease subunit of DNA fragmentation factor (DFF40) and cleavage of its inhibitor, DFF45, were not sufficient to cause internucleosomal DNA fragmentation in osteosarcoma cells during etoposide-induced apoptosis. Coexpression of caspase-3-resistant PARP-1 mutant with DNAS1L3 in osteosarcoma cells blocked etoposide-induced internucleosomal DNA fragmentation and resulted in persistent poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of DNAS1L3; it did not, however, prevent the activation of caspase-3 and the consequent cleavage of endogenous PARP-1. These results indicate that PARP-1 cleavage during apoptosis is not simply required to prevent excessive depletion of NAD and ATP but is also necessary to release DNAS1L3 from poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation-mediated inhibition.

This process of programmed cell death is characterized by marked changes in cell morphology, including chromatin condensation, membrane blebbing, nuclear breakdown, and the appearance of membrane-associated apoptotic bodies, as well as by internucleosomal DNA fragmentation and the cleavage of many housekeeping proteins such as poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1)1 and lamins. Apoptosis is triggered by various agents, including endogenous cytokines as well as therapeutic and cytotoxic drugs, and its initiation and execution are mediated by activation of members of the caspase family of aspartate-specific cysteine proteases. Fragmentation of DNA is thought to be an important step in disposal of the genome in cells undergoing apoptosis. Defective DNA fragmentation has been associated with an increased resistance of cells to apoptosis (1Kawabata Y. Hirokawa M. Kitabayashi A. Horiuchi T. Kuroki J. Miura A.B.

The endonuclease activity of this enzyme, which is intrinsic to DFF40, is induced on cleavage of DFF45 by caspase-3. We have recently cloned and characterized the human homolog (12Yakovlev A.G.

PARP-1 is thought to be one of the earliest targets for cleavage by caspase-3-like proteases during apoptosis. Its cleavage into 89- and 24-kDa fragments renders PARP-1 inactive. With the use of a caspase-3-resistant PARP-1 mutant, we have recently shown that cleavage of PARP-1 plays an important role in the normal progression of apoptosis and that interference with PARP-1 cleavage increases the rate of apoptotic cell death as a result of excessive depletion of the PARP-1 substrate NAD (16Boulares H.

Wang Z.Q. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5124-5133Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) showed that expression of a similar caspase-3-resistant mutant of PARP-1 switched the mode of cell death induced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF) from apoptosis to necrosis. The cleavage of PARP-1 into inactive peptides on exposure of cells to inducers of apoptosis is thus thought to avoid excessive depletion of energy reserves and a switch to necrosis. Cleavage and inactivation of PARP-1 by caspase-3-like proteases during apoptosis also may be necessary for activation of the endonuclease DNAS1L3. In a continuation of our investigations into the contribution of PARP-1 to mid and late stages of apoptosis, we have now examined the role of PARP-1 activity and cleavage of this enzyme by caspases in DNAS1L3-mediated DNA fragmentation, both with the use of an in vitro assay and in human osteosarcoma cells treated with the chemotherapeutic and pro-apoptotic drug etoposide. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, that PARP-1 and its cleavage by caspases play a direct role in DNAS1L3-mediated internucleosomal DNA fragmentation in intact cells.

Both DNAS1L3 and mut-PARP-1 cDNAs were positioned immediately downstream of the coding sequence for six histidine residues, followed by the FLAG epitope, and were cloned in pcDNA3.1 and pCR3.1 mammalian expression vectors (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), respectively. The addition of the His6-FLAG tag was necessary for analysis of protein expression as well as for precipitation of the expressed proteins; antibodies to native DNAS1L3 are not available. Transfected osteosarcoma clones were isolated by selection with G418 or hygromycin (Sigma), or both, and were tested for expression of DNAS1L3 or mut-PARP-1 by immunoblot analysis with antibodies to the FLAG epitope as described below. Apoptosis was induced by exposing cells to 70 μm etoposide (Sigma) for 12 or 24 h at 37 °C. Recombinant human wild-type PARP-1 and catalytically inactive PARP-1 were purified essentially as described (21Smulson M.E. Pang D. Jung M. Dimtchev A. Chasovskikh S. Spoonde A. Simbulan-Rosenthal C.

The mut-PARP-1 protein was partially purified from extracts of transfected osteosarcoma cells by precipitation with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid magnetic beads (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). For assay of DNA fragmentation in vitro, the recombinant proteins DNAS1L3 (1 μg) (Alexis Biochemicals, San Diego, CA), wild-type PARP-1 (0.2 μg), inactive mutant PARP-1 (0.2 μg), the caspase-3-resistant mut-PARP-1 (1 μg), and caspase-3 (0.1 μg) (Alexis Biochemicals, San Diego, CA) were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C in a final volume of 30 μl of a solution containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1 μg of genomic DNA, and 0.5 mm NAD. The integrity of the DNA was then analyzed by electrophoresis through a 1.5% agarose gel and staining with ethidium bromide. Plasmids encoding wild-type PARP-1 or mut-PARP-1 tagged with His6-FLAG were used to synthesize [35S]methionine-labeled proteins by coupled T7 RNA polymerase-mediated transcription and translation in a reticulocyte lysate (Promega, Madison, WI). Lysates (1 μl) containing either recombinant protein were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in the absence or presence of 10 ng of caspase-3. The reaction was terminated by the addition of SDS sample buffer, and the products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Total RNA was isolated from osteosarcoma or U-937 cells with the use of an Rneasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and 10-μg portions were subjected to reverse transcription (RT) with HotStarTaq (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). One-tenth of the resulting cDNA was amplified by PCR with the following primers (sense and antisense, respectively): DNAS1L3, 5′-GTTCCAATCTCCCCACACTG-3′ and 5′-GTCCTCTAAGCACAATCCTG-3′; human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5′-TCTGCCCCCTCTGCTGATGC-3′ and 5′-CCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTAG-3′.

We have also demonstrated previously that DNAS1L3-mediated internucleosomal DNA fragmentation in transfected fibroblasts exposed to TNF and cycloheximide occurs immediately after PARP-1 cleavage, suggesting that the cleavage and consequent inactivation of PARP-1 might be required for the induction of DNAS1L3 endonuclease activity in cells. With the use of our in vitro system, we have now examined the effect of inactivation of PARP-1 by caspase-3 on DNAS1L3-mediated DNA fragmentation. Recombinant human DNAS1L3 was incubated with recombinant human PARP-1 in the presence of NAD and genomic DNA and in the absence or presence of recombinant human caspase-3. As shown previously, DNAS1L3 mediated the complete degradation of genomic DNA (Fig.1A), and this action was blocked by the addition of wild-type PARP-1. In contrast, a catalytically inactive mutant of PARP-1 had no effect on DNAS1L3-mediated DNA degradation, demonstrating that poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation catalyzed by PARP-1 is required for the inhibition of DNAS1L3 endonuclease activity. The presence of caspase-3 completely blocked the inhibition by PARP-1 of DNAS1L3 endonuclease activity, suggesting that PARP-1 cleavage by caspase-3 promotes the activation of this nuclease. To confirm that the cleavage and consequent inactivation of PARP-1 by caspase-3 are required for DNAS1L3 endonuclease activity in ourin vitro system, we examined the effect of a partially purified caspase-3-resistant mutant of PARP-1 (mut-PARP-1), in which the aspartate residue (Asp214) at the caspase-3 cleavage site had been replaced with a glycine residue by site-directed mutagenesis. The catalytic activity and structural integrity of this mutant protein were unaffected either by recombinant caspase-3 in vitro (Fig. 1B) (16Boulares H. Yakovlev A. Ivanova I. Stoica B.A. Wang G. Iyer S. Smulson M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22932-22940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar) or when expressed in osteosarcoma cells induced to undergo apoptosis by staurosporine (16Boulares H. Yakovlev A. Ivanova I. Stoica B.A. Wang G. Iyer S. Smulson M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22932-22940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). The recombinant mut-PARP-1 completely blocked DNAS1L3 endonuclease activity in the absence or presence of caspase-3 (Fig. 1A). To demonstrate that inhibition of DNAS1L3 by mut-PARP-1 required the catalytic activity of the mutant, we examined the effect of 3-aminobenzamide. This drug prevented the inhibition of DNAS1L3 endonuclease activity by mut-PARP-1, confirming that PARP-1 activity is specifically required for the inhibition of DNAS1L3. These in vitro results thus indicate that the cleavage and consequent inactivation of PARP-1 by caspase-3 are necessary for the induction of DNAS1L3 endonuclease activity. During a search for a cell type with which to study the role of DNAS1L3 in DNA fragmentation during apoptosis, we found that human osteosarcoma cells (unlike U-937 human monocytes) do not express DNAS1L3, as revealed by RT-PCR analysis with primers specific for human DNAS1L3 cDNA (Fig.2A). Furthermore, again unlike U-937 cells, the osteosarcoma cells do not undergo internucleosomal DNA fragmentation in response to the pro-apoptotic drug etoposide (Fig.2B). We therefore transfected osteosarcoma cells with an expression vector that encodes DNAS1L3 fused to a His6-FLAG tag. Immunoblot analysis with antibodies to the FLAG epitope revealed that the transfected cells expressed recombinant DNAS1L3 (Fig.2C). Exposure of the transfected osteosarcoma cells to etoposide resulted in marked internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, and this effect was completely blocked by the presence in the incubation medium of a cell-permeable BAPTA, which inhibits intracellular Ca2+ release. These results demonstrated that DNAS1L3 mediates internucleosomal DNA fragmentation in the transfected osteosarcoma cells and that this activity is dependent on Ca2+, consistent with the results of our previous study (12Yakovlev A.G. Wang G. Stoica B.A. Simbulan-Rosenthal C.M. Yoshihara K. Smulson M.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1999-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) showing a requirement of Ca2+ for DNAS1L3 endonuclease activity, in vitro. Because DFF has been suggested to play a major role in DNA fragmentation during apoptosis (3Boulares A.H. Zoltoski A.J. Yakovlev A. Xu M. Smulson M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38185-38192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Nagata S. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar, 9Liu X. Li P. Widlak P.

Cell. 1997; 89: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1642) Google Scholar), it was thus important to determine whether failure of osteosarcoma cells to undergo internucleosomal DNA fragmentation was associated with either an alteration in DFF40 and DFF45 protein expression or to a defect in DFF45 proteolytic processing after etoposide treatment. DFF40 and DFF45 protein expressions were, therefore, assessed in extracts from osteosarcoma cells and compared with those from U-937 cells by Western immunoblot analysis with antibodies to either human DFF40 or DFF45. Fig. 3A shows that both DFF40 and DFF45 protein levels were comparable with those detected in U-937 cells. We then examined the fate of DFF45 in extracts from cells that were treated with etoposide for 12 or 24 h. Fig.3B shows that DFF45 was proteolytically cleaved into its typical apoptotic 32- and 11-kDa fragments. Altogether, these results suggest that expression of DFF40 and cleavage of DFF45 are not sufficient to cause internucleosomal DNA fragmentation in osteosarcoma cells during etoposide-induced apoptosis. To examine the role of PARP-1 cleavage in the induction of DNAS1L3 endonuclease activity in osteosarcoma cells, we transfected the cells with vectors encoding DNAS1L3, mut-PARP-1 (also fused to the His6-FLAG sequence), or both of these proteins. Immunoblot analysis with antibodies to FLAG confirmed the expression of the recombinant proteins in the transfected cells (Fig. 4A). We next examined the effect of mut-PARP-1 expression on DNAS1L3-mediated internucleosomal DNA fragmentation by incubating transfected cells in the presence of etoposide for 12 or 24 h. Expression of mut-PARP-1 together with DNAS1L3 blocked etoposide-induced DNA fragmentation mediated by the recombinant endonuclease (Fig. 4B), presumably by maintaining it in the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated (inhibited) state. Expression of mut-PARP-1 alone had no effect on the integrity of DNA in cells exposed (or not) to etoposide. These results suggest that cleavage of PARP-1 is necessary for DNAS1L3-mediated degradation of DNA and are consistent with the in vitro data shown in Fig. 1. The recombinant mut-PARP-1 protein remained intact during incubation of cells with etoposide (Fig. 4C). To examine the relation between the endonuclease activity and the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation state of DNAS1L3, we precipitated DNAS1L3 from etoposide-treated osteosarcoma cells expressing the endonuclease in the absence or presence of mut-PARP-1. The precipitates were then subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies to PAR. Cells expressing only DNAS1L3 exhibited a transient increase in the extent of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of this protein that was apparent after exposure to etoposide for 12 h but not after 24 h (Fig. 5). In contrast, coexpression of mut-PARP-1 was associated with a markedly greater increase in the extent of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of DNAS1L3 after incubation with etoposide for 12 h, and this level of modification was still apparent at 24 h. These results appear to correlate with the kinetics of DNA fragmentation in the transfected cells, and they suggest that hydrolysis of PAR moieties attached to DNAS1L3 by the action of PARP-1 is required for induction of the endonuclease activity of this protein in cells undergoing apoptosis. To verify that the lack of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation in etoposide-treated osteosarcoma cells expressing both DNAS1L3 and mut-PARP-1 was not due to inhibition of the activation of other apoptotic factors, we measured caspase-3-like activity. Cells were incubated for 12 or 24 h in the presence of etoposide, after which cell extracts were prepared and assayed for caspase-3-like activity with the substrate DEVD-AMC. Etoposide induced a marked increase in caspase-3-like activity in osteosarcoma cells expressing mut-PARP-1, DNAS1L3, or both recombinant proteins (Fig.6A), indicating that the failure of cells expressing both DNAS1L3 and mut-PARP-1 to undergo internucleosomal DNA fragmentation in response to etoposide was not due to a lack of caspase-3 activity. The same cell extracts were also subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies to PARP-1, which recognize both the full-length protein and its 89-kDa cleavage product but not the His6-FLAG-tagged recombinant mut-PARP-1 (16Boulares H. Yakovlev A. Ivanova I. Stoica B.A. Wang G. Iyer S. Smulson M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22932-22940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Etoposide induced the cleavage of endogenous PARP-1 in each of the three types of transfected cells (Fig.6B, upper panel). Similar results were obtained when the cleavage of endogenous PARP-1 was monitored with the use of antibodies that recognize only the 89-kDa cleavage fragment (Fig.6B, lower panel). The maximal level of caspase-3-like activity (Fig. 6A) and the extent of cleavage of endogenous PARP-1 (Fig. 6B) were higher in cells expressing only DNAS1L3 than in those expressing mut-PARP-1 alone or both mut-PARP-1 and DNAS1L3. These results are consistent with the higher sensitivity of the former cells to etoposide (data not shown). PARP-1 is cleaved by caspase-3 or caspase-7 early during apoptosis in many cell lines and tissues. Several caspase substrates have been shown to play a direct positive or negative role in apoptosis. Among these substrates are pro-apoptotic proteins such as caspases themselves (23Cryns V. Yuan J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1551-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar, 24Budihardjo I. Oliver H. Lutter M. Luo X. Wang X. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 269-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (2253) Google Scholar) and Bid (25Yin X.M. J. Mol. Med. 2000; 78: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), whose cleavage results in activation and escalation of the apoptotic pathway, as well as anti-apoptotic proteins such as members of the Bcl-2 family (26Antonsson B.

Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 882-886PubMed Google Scholar), which, if not cleaved, block the death program. Although the role of PARP-1 cleavage in apoptosis remains to be fully elucidated, substantial insight into this role has been gained during the past several years (3Boular"

We present evidence that an abrupt change in intracellular IHF concentrations occurs when P. putidacells enter stationary phase. This change results in enhanced binding of the factor to the promoter and in the ensuing bending of the target DNA. Since Pu activity depends rigorously on DNA bending, promoter occupation is in turn translated into a much higher transcriptional output when cells leave exponential growth. Inspection of the residual activity of Pu in an IHF− strain reveals that IHF predominantly locks the capacity of the promoter to specific growth stages and also that additional physiological signals are entered in the system through ς54-RNA polymerase. The results substantiate the notion that ς54 promoters process metabolic co-regulation signals through factor-induced changes in the architecture of the cognate DNA region.

Further, they validate UV laser technology as a suitable tool to visualize nondisruptive alterations of DNA shapein vivo. upstream activating sequence integration host factor RNA polymerase The activity of bacterial promoters in vivo is generally subject to two levels of control. First, regulated promoters respond to particular physical-chemical signals (typically distinct nutrients) through cognate proteins that directly or indirectly up/down-regulate expression of genes for transport, metabolism, or other functions. Nevertheless, regulation of specific promoters is subject to a second level of control (generally termed co-regulation) that links transcription of individual genes or operons to the general physiological standing of the cells (1Cases I. de Lorenzo V. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1998; 1: 303-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This ensures a proper balance between all those metabolic networks operating concurrently in living cells (2Cases I. de Lorenzo V. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). A well characterized paradigm of co-regulation is the cAMP-receptor-protein-mediated catabolite repression that certain carbon sources exert on a large number of promoters inEscherichia coli (3Saier M.H. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1998; 58: 170-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, there is growing evidence that many, if not all, bacterial promoters are influenced by global environmental stimuli in addition to their primary inducer signals (2Cases I. de Lorenzo V. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The mechanisms involved in such co-regulation are very diverse, involving not only signaling through chemicals and metabolites whose levels report physiological conditions (ppGpp, trehalose, fumarate, and ATP) but also phosphotransfer relays, mRNA stability, and interplay between sigma factors (for a review, see Ref. 1Cases I. de Lorenzo V. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1998; 1: 303-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Growth conditions affect also the levels and activities of nucleoid-associated proteins, which bind DNA with variable sequence specificity (4Ali Azam T. Iwata A. Nishimura A. Ueda S. Ishihama A. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6361-6370Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and can thus influence expression of a large number and variety of genes.The Pu promoter of the TOL plasmid pWW0 ofPseudomonas putida (Fig. 1) is an engaging case of integration between specific and global inputs in the outcome of transcription. Pu belongs to the class of promoters that depend on the alternative sigma factor ς54 and is activated at a distance by a toluene-responsive activator (XylR). This involves the binding of the regulator to upstream activating sequences (UASs)1 and the looping-out of the complex drawing it into close proximity to the ς54-containing form of RNA polymerase (ς54-RNAP) bound to the −12/−24 region of the promoter (5Wedel A. Weiss D.S. Popham D. Dr-ge P. Kustu S. Science. 1990; 248: 486-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In the case of Pu, this event is assisted by the presence of an integration host factor (IHF) binding site at the intervening region between the UAS and the ς54-RNAP attachment site (Fig. 1). The IHF protein is a small (20-kDa) basic heterodimeric protein that contains a helix-turn-helix domain involved in dimerization and two antiparallel β-sheets. IHF binds and sharply bends DNA (6Rice P.A. Yang S. Mizuuchi K. Nash H.A. Cell. 1996; 87: 1295-1306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar), producing a distinct footprint on target DNA sequences (7Craig N.L. Nash H.A.

Cell. 1988; 55: 545-554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). IHF binding sites include the motif 5′-WATCARNNNNTTR-3′ (where W is A or T and R is A or G) separated by 8 bp from a less conserved A/T-rich track of 4–6 bp (9Goodrich J.A. Schwartz M.L. McClure W.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4993-5000Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 10Lee E.C. MacWilliams M.P. Gumport R.I. Gardner J.F. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 609-617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These structural themes are conserved with small variations in all bacterial species. IHF binding to Pu sharply bends the target DNA sequence, an event that fixes an optimal promoter geometry and facilitates contacts between distant proteins and aids the recruitment of ς54-RNAP to −12/−24 (11Pèrez-Martı̀n J. Timmis K.N. de Lorenzo V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22657-22662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Bertoni G. Fujita N. Ishihama A. de Lorenzo V. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5120-5128Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The lack of IHF abolishes any significant activity from Pu in vitro or in vivo (13Calb R. Davidovitch A. Koby S. Giladi H. Goldenberg D. Margalit H. Holtel A. Timmis K. Sanchez-Romero J.M. de Lorenzo V. Oppenheim A.B. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6319-6326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Pèrez-Martı̀n J. de Lorenzo V. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 575-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).The performance of Pu is exquisitely dependent on the metabolic status of the cell. An excess of certain carbon sources or rapid growth in rich medium inhibits the promoter in vivoeven if toluene is present in the culture or if a constitutive XylR variant is used (15Cases I. de Lorenzo V. Pèrez-Martı̀n J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 16Kolb A. Busby S. Buc H. Garges S. Adhya S. Cases I. de Lorenzo V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 749-795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At least four different physiological inputs are channeled into the promoter. First, the presence of glucose and other carbohydrates controls Pu activity through a process which involves the ptsN gene, encoding the IIANtr protein of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (17Powell B.S. Court D.L. Inada T. Nakamura Y. Michotey V. Cui X. Reizer A. Saier M.H. Reizer J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4822-4839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 18Cases I. Pèrez-Martı̀n J. de Lorenzo V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15562-15568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Second, rapid growth in a rich medium down-regulates the activity of Pu probably by keeping the performance of the ς54 protein under check, a phenomenon that has been termed exponential silencing (15Cases I. de Lorenzo V. Pèrez-Martı̀n J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 19Marques S. Holtel A. Timmis K.N. Ramos J.L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2517-2524Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Third, there seems to be a separate control connected to the heat shock response as revealed by the significant loss of activity of the promoter in cells defective in the FtsH protein (20Carmona M. de Lorenzo V. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Finally,Pu is moderately stimulated by the alarmone (p)ppGpp that mediates the stringent response to amino acid starvation (21Carmona M. Rodrı̀guez M. Martı̀nez-Costa O. de Lorenzo V. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4711-4718Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). None of these observations, however, explain entirely the phenomenal burst in activity of a chromosomal Pu-lacZ fusion (from undetectable to ∼10,000 Miller units) when P. putida cells pass from exponential growth to stationary phase.The absolute requirement of DNA bending for Pu activity and the growth phase variations of IHF reported for E. coli make it plausible that some co-regulation signals could be channeled through factor-mediated changes in Pu geometry. Although simple, this notion has been difficult to test properly (15Cases I. de Lorenzo V. Pèrez-Martı̀n J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 22Ditto M.D. Roberts D. Weisberg R.A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3738-3748Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Hill S.A. Belland R.J. Wilson J. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 215: 303-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar).In this work, we set out to clarify unequivocally the connections between the physiological standing of P. putida cells, the concentration of IHF, and the activity of the Pu promoter. The main instrument to this end has been the use of a nondisruptive UV laser footprinting technique for visualizing the binding of IHF toPu in vivo and the ensuing bending of DNA in monocopy in the native stoichiometry of regulatory elements. While this technique has been applied in the past to follow IHF binding to target sites in multicopy plasmids in E. coli (24Engelhorn M. Boccard F. Murtin C. Prentki P. Geiselmann J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2959-2965Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 25Murtin C. Engelhorn M. Geiselmann J. Boccard F. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 949-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) this is the first case that the same approach has been applied to examine the occupation of a functional promoter by the factor in vivo under physiologically significant conditions. As shown below, IHF binds to the Pu promoter only when cells cease to grow exponentially. This synchronizes with a sudden rise in intracellular concentrations of the factor and a steep increase in promoter output. The activity of bacterial promoters in vivo is generally subject to two levels of control. First, regulated promoters respond to particular physical-chemical signals (typically distinct nutrients) through cognate proteins that directly or indirectly up/down-regulate expression of genes for transport, metabolism, or other functions.

An excess of certain carbon sources or rapid growth in rich medium inhibits the promoter in vivoeven if toluene is present in the culture or if a constitutive XylR variant is used (15Cases I. de Lorenzo V.

Biochem. 1993; 62: 749-795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At least four different physiological inputs are channeled into the promoter. First, the presence of glucose and other carbohydrates controls Pu activity through a process which involves the ptsN gene, encoding the IIANtr protein of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (17Powell B.S.

Second, rapid growth in a rich medium down-regulates the activity of Pu probably by keeping the performance of the ς54 protein under check, a phenomenon that has been termed exponential silencing (15Cases I. de Lorenzo V. Pèrez-Martı̀n J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 19Marques S. Holtel A. Timmis K.N. Ramos J.L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2517-2524Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Third, there seems to be a separate control connected to the heat shock response as revealed by the significant loss of activity of the promoter in cells defective in the FtsH protein (20Carmona M. de Lorenzo V. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Finally,Pu is moderately stimulated by the alarmone (p)ppGpp that mediates the stringent response to amino acid starvation (21Carmona M. Rodrı̀guez M. Martı̀nez-Costa O. de Lorenzo V. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4711-4718Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). None of these observations, however, explain entirely the phenomenal burst in activity of a chromosomal Pu-lacZ fusion (from undetectable to ∼10,000 Miller units) when P. putida cells pass from exponential growth to stationary phase. The absolute requirement of DNA bending for Pu activity and the growth phase variations of IHF reported for E. coli make it plausible that some co-regulation signals could be channeled through factor-mediated changes in Pu geometry. Although simple, this notion has been difficult to test properly (15Cases I. de Lorenzo V. Pèrez-Martı̀n J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 22Ditto M.D. Roberts D. Weisberg R.A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3738-3748Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Hill S.A. Belland R.J. Wilson J. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 215: 303-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In this work, we set out to clarify unequivocally the connections between the physiological standing of P. putida cells, the concentration of IHF, and the activity of the Pu promoter. The main instrument to this end has been the use of a nondisruptive UV laser footprinting technique for visualizing the binding of IHF toPu in vivo and the ensuing bending of DNA in monocopy in the native stoichiometry of regulatory elements. While this technique has been applied in the past to follow IHF binding to target sites in multicopy plasmids in E. coli (24Engelhorn M. Boccard F. Murtin C. Prentki P. Geiselmann J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2959-2965Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 25Murtin C. Engelhorn M. Geiselmann J. Boccard F. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 949-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) this is the first case that the same approach has been applied to examine the occupation of a functional promoter by the factor in vivo under physiologically significant conditions. As shown below, IHF binds to the Pu promoter only when cells cease to grow exponentially. This synchronizes with a sudden rise in intracellular concentrations of the factor and a steep increase in promoter output. We are indebted to I. Cases, L. A Fernandez, and J. Garmendia for inspiring discussions."

Much of the interest in PKB stems from the discovery that this kinase is rapidly activated in response to a wide variety of receptor-tyrosine kinases and that such activation is prevented by strategies that inhibit or prevent the activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI 3-kinases; Refs. 2Walker K.S.

Lipid binding results in translocation of PKB to membranes and induces a conformational change in PKB, making it an efficient substrate for upstream kinase(s). Phosphorylation of Thr308 is accomplished by phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1, which possesses a carboxyl-terminal pleckstrin homology domain that also binds PI 3-kinase lipid products. Phosphorylation of Ser473 may involve phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1, a yet to be identified protein kinase, currently termed phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 2, or both (1Vanhaesebroeck B.

There is also at least one report of wortmannin-insensitive activation of PKB via Gs-coupled β-adrenergic receptors (19Moule S.K. Welsh G.I. Edgell N.J. Foulstone E.J. Proud C.G. Denton R.M. J. Biol.

There are currently few reports of Gq-coupled receptors stimulating PKB, PI 3-kinases, or both (20Liebmann C. Bohmer F.D. Curr. Med.

Downes C.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We were therefore surprised to observe substantial activation of PKB when these cells were exposed to the muscarinic cholinergic agonist carbachol, which acts primarily on Gq-coupled M3 receptors in this system (23Ashkenazi A. Peralta E.G. Winslow J.W. Ramachandran J. Capon D.J Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1989; 53: 263-272Crossref Google Scholar). We show here that PKB activation occurs downstream of phospholipase C (PLC) activity and does not require PKC but does involve calcium, ErbB3 transactivation, and subsequently activation of a p85-associated PI 3-kinase. 1321N1 cells were obtained from the European Tissue Culture Collection, and materials for cell culture were from Invitrogen or Sigma. Calcium ionophores (A23187 and ionomycin), calcium chelator (bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid-acetoxymethylester (BAPTA-AM)), thapsigargin, bisindolylmaleimide IX (RO-318220), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), and pertussis toxin were from Calbiochem. Antibodies to the following were obtained from the sources indicated: phosphotyrosine, Upstate Biotechnology; insulin receptor substrate-1, Upstate Biotechnology or Santa Cruz Biotechnology; PKB isoforms (α, β, and γ) and phospho-Ser473 PKB, Medical Research Council Protein Phosphorylation Unit, University of Dundee; and phospho-Thr308 PKB antibodies, Cell Signaling. Antibodies specific for the p85α subunit of PI 3-kinase were a generous gift from M. Waterfield (University College London). Other materials were from sources defined previously (22Batty I.H. Downes C.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). 1321N1 cells were grown to confluence in 6- or 24-well plates as described previously (22Batty I.H. Downes C.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These activities were measured in cells in which the phosphoinositide pools were prelabeled to steady state with [3H]inositol (5–10 μCi/ml) exactly as described previously (22Batty I.H. Downes C.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 24Batty I.H. Downes C.P. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 529-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Cells were washed three times with Hepes-buffered, modified Krebs-Henseleit buffer (118 mm NaCl, 4.69 mm KCl, 1.18 mmMgSO4, 1.29 mm CaCl2, 1.18 mm KH2PO4, 11.67 mmglucose, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4 at 37 °C) and preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C in the same buffer before exposure to stimuli or appropriate vehicle. Where indicated, antagonists or inhibitors were present for all or part of the 30-min preincubation period as specified in the figure legends. Incubations were fixed by rapid removal of the incubation buffer and addition of ice-cold lysis buffer (1% v/v Triton X-100, 120 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.6 at 4 °C, freshly supplemented with 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm benzamidine, 10 μm leupeptin, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Cell debris was collected, transferred onto ice, and subsequently centrifuged for 5 min at 20,000 × g and 4 °C to remove insoluble material. The supernatants from cell lysates were then either assayed directly as described below or frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C for later analysis. For PI 3-kinase, cell lysates (∼1 mg protein) were mixed for ≥2 h at 4 °C on a shaking platform with antibodies against insulin receptor substrate-1 or p85, each of which was precoupled to protein G beads (10 μl/sample). Immunoprecipitates were collected by brief centrifugation and then washed and assayed for PI 3-kinase activity as described previously (25Herbert T.P. Kilhams G.R. Batty I.H. Proud C.G. J. Biol.

The PKB isoforms (α, β, and γ) were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates (∼300 μg protein) using the isoform-specific antibodies, and the immunoprecipitates were assayed as described previously (2Walker K.S. Deak M. Paterson A. Hudson K. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 275: 13377-13385Google Scholar, 27Tang X. Downes C.P. Whetton A.D. Owen-Lynch P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13142-13824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), except that assays were continued for 45 min at 30 °C. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting were performed as described previously (26Tang X. Downes C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14193-14199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In previous work using 1321N1 cells to study cross talk between PI 3-kinase and PLC-dependent signaling pathways, we showed that insulin-stimulated production of PtdIns (3,4,5)P3 was inhibited by agonists acting on PLC-coupled receptors. This results both from prolonged inhibition of insulin-stimulated PI 3-kinase activity and from acute activation of an unidentified PtdIns (3,4,5)P3 5-phosphatase (22Batty I.H. Downes C.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 28Batty I.H. Hickinson D.M. Downes C.P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 1132-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). It was thus unexpected that PLC-coupled receptors would prove capable of stimulating PKB activity themselves. This activation is illustrated in Fig.1A, in which PKB activity was analyzed in immunoprecipitates from cells treated for different times with carbachol, a cholinergic agonist. Carbachol induced a time-dependent stimulation of PKB activity, which showed a marked delay in onset of ∼2 min and which reached a maximum of 4-fold above basal after 15 min. This response was attributable to activation of muscarinic receptors (presumably M3 receptors, because these predominate in this cell line (23Ashkenazi A. Peralta E.G. Winslow J.W. Ramachandran J. Capon D.J Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1989; 53: 263-272Crossref Google Scholar) and because the response was blocked by atropine (data not shown)). The effects of carbachol were relatively potent, with an EC50 of ∼10 μm(Fig. 1B), a concentration ∼2–3-fold lower than that required for half-maximal activation of PLC in these cells. The majority of the PKB activity resulted from the α and γ isoforms, whereas PKBβ was barely detectable. PKBα and γ were activated to similar extents by carbachol (Fig. 1C). As shown in Fig. 2A, pretreatment of 1321N1 cells with 100 nm wortmannin abolished the carbachol-stimulated PKB response. In control experiments, wortmannin also blocked PKB activation by insulin, which is known to regulate PKB via class 1A PI 3-kinases. The latter binds to phosphotyrosine-containing sequences in insulin receptor substrate proteins via the Src homology 2 domain in the PI 3-kinase regulatory subunit. Fig. 2A also shows that insulin activates PKB to a level ∼3-fold greater than carbachol. The data in Fig. 2Bestablish that PKB activity correlates with the degree of phosphorylation of Ser473 and Thr308, compatible with the hypothesis that PI 3-kinase-dependent lipid products are responsible for the effects of both insulin and carbachol on PKB. To address this question further, we measured the levels of [3H]PtdIns (3,4,5)P3 in [3H]inositol-labeled cells. Fig.3 shows that carbachol induced a limited but significant increase in [3H]PtdIns (3,4,5)P3 of ∼50% above basal (Fig. 3A), which our earlier preliminary study (22Batty I.H. Downes C.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) would have easily overlooked. At maximally effective concentrations, insulin stimulates a much larger (≥10-fold) increase in PtdIns (3,4,5)P3 levels (22Batty I.H. Downes C.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) in these cells. However, as shown in Fig. 3B, the dose curve for PI 3-kinase activation by insulin lies ∼10-fold to the right of the corresponding dose curve for PKB activation. This implies that only a very small increase in PtdIns (3,4,5)P3 is required to achieve substantial activation of PKB. The results illustrated in Fig. 3C implicate a type IA PI 3-kinase, at least in part, in the pathway leading to activation of PKB in response to carbachol. Stimulation of 1321N1 cells with carbachol for 15 min resulted in an ∼3-fold increase in PI 3-kinase activity that could be immunoprecipitated with an anti-p85 antibody. The muscaranic receptor-stimulated PKB response was unaltered after preincubation of the cells with pertussis toxin, whereas adenosine-stimulated PKB was abolished by this treatment. These results established that the muscaranic receptor-mediated response is not mediated by Gi and Go but most probably by Gq (Fig. 4A). In addition to muscarinic receptors, 1321N1 cells express several other endogenous receptors, which couple, most probably via Gq, to the stimulation of PLC. These include histamine H1receptors (29Nakahata N. Martin M.W. Hughes A.R. Hepler J.R. Harden T.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1986; 29: 188-195PubMed Google Scholar, 30Kurita M. Mashiko H. Ogata M. Kumasaka T. Niwa S. Nakahata N. Takano S. Nakanishi H. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 2000; 27: 208-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), protease-activated receptors sensitive to thrombin (31Nakahata N. Harden T.K. Biochem. J. 1987; 241: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and the synthetic peptide ligand SFLLRN (22Batty I.H. Downes C.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and bradykinin receptors (see Fig. 4). Fig. 4 shows that maximally effective concentrations of histamine, SFLLRN, and bradykinin each elicited activation of PKB in 1321N1 cells. The smaller effects of these stimuli on PKB activity compared with that of carbachol are generally compatible with their relative impacts on PLC activity over the time scale shown. Direct, quantitative comparison of these events is difficult, however, because muscarinic receptor stimulation induces persistent activation of PLC in 1321N1 cells, whereas PLC responses to the other stimuli vary both in initial magnitude and in the rate and extent of desensitization (22Batty I.H. Downes C.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 29Nakahata N. Martin M.W. Hughes A.R. Hepler J.R. Harden T.K. Mol.

Indeed the comparative efficacy of carbachol and SFLLRN in activating PKB is particularly noteworthy, because the initial (≤30-s) PLC response to the latter is severalfold greater than that elicited by the former ligand but desensitizes extensively within 1–2 min after agonist addition (22Batty I.H. Downes C.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), during which phase neither carbachol nor SFLLRN activates PKB. This result implies that relatively persistent stimulation of PLC is required for this response. However, the ability of thrombin receptors in 1321N1 cells to couple to G-proteins in addition to Gq (32Aragay A.M. Collins L.R. Post G.R. Watson A.J. Feramisco J.R. Brown J.H. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20073-20077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 33Post G.R. Collins L.R. Kennedy E.D. Moskowitz S.A. Aragay A.M. Goldstein D. Brown J.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1679-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) may also be relevant in this regard. Fig. 4B also illustrates that, like PKB responses to carbachol, those to histamine, SFLLRN, and bradykinin are blocked by wortmannin, consistent again with a downstream requirement for PI 3-kinase. By contrast, stimulation of the endogenous β-adrenergic receptor, which couples to the activation of adenylyl cyclase in 1321N1 cells (34Harden T.K. Foster S.J. Perkins J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4416-4422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), did not enhance PKB activity (data not shown). These data thus show a strong qualitative correlation between PLC and PKB activities compatible with the hypothesis that the latter can be activated in a PLC-dependent manner. Previous work has shown that acute pretreatment of 1321N1 cells with phorbol ester markedly reduces maximal muscarinic receptor-stimulated PLC activity by uncoupling either the receptor-G-protein or the G-protein-PLC interaction (8Orellana S.A. Solski P.A. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5236-5239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig.5, we took advantage of this to confirm that muscarinic receptor activation of PKB is dependent on PLC activity. These data show a dose-related inhibition of carbachol-stimulated PLC activity by phorbol ester, with maximal inhibition of ∼70% at 1 μm PMA. These effects were paralleled by an almost identical degree of inhibition of the PKB response to carbachol. This inhibition could not have been mediated via a direct action on PKB, because PMA had little or no effect on insulin-stimulated (Fig. 5) or basal PKB activity (see below). Thus, these results strongly support the conclusion that PLC activity is required for the ability of muscarinic agonists to stimulate PKB activity. The signaling pathways downstream of PLCs involve inositol trisphosphate-mediated Ca2+ release and diacylglycerol-stimulated PKC activity. Fig. 6A examines the role of PKC in carbachol-stimulated PKB activity. Treatment of 1321N1 cells with the phorbol ester PMA, on its own, failed to stimulate PKB. Consistent with this observation, pretreatment with the bisindolylmaleimide PKC inhibitor RO-318220 did not block carbachol-stimulated PKB (Fig. 6A). On the contrary, RO-318220 enhanced both basal and carbachol-stimulated PKB activity, suggesting that either PKC or another RO-318220-sensitive target exerts a tonic inhibitory influence on PKB activity in these cells. By contrast, reagents that elevate cytosolic [Ca2+] did stimulate PKB activity in a similar manner to carbachol. Thus Fig.6B shows stimulation of PKB activity by the Ca2+ionophore ionomycin of a magnitude and time course similar to that induced by carbachol. The delayed response of 1–2 min is especially reminiscent of the receptor-mediated activation of PKB. Similar responses were also observed using another Ca2+ ionophore (A23187) and after application of a Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor, thapsigargin (Fig. 6C), which raises cytosolic [Ca2+] by blocking its uptake into the endoplasmic reticulum (35Kurosu H. Maehama T. Okada T. Yamamoto T. Hoshino S. Fukui Y. Ui M. Hazeki O. Katada T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24252-24256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The effects of all three reagents were blocked by wortmannin, suggesting that Ca2+ acts upstream of PI 3-kinase in this system. If a Ca2+ signal is necessary and sufficient for the stimulation of PKB by carbachol, it would be predicted that the agonist-induced response should be inhibited by reagents that reduce cytosolic [Ca2+]. Experiments addressing this issue are shown in Fig. 6A, in which intracellular [Ca2+] was buffered by treating cells with the cell-penetrant acetoxymethylester of the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA (BAPTA-AM). The results presented in Fig. 6A show that carbachol-induced PKB activity was diminished in cells loaded with BAPTA-AM. Because the PLC response to carbachol was not similarly affected by the chelator (data not shown), these data clearly imply that the muscarinic receptor-mediated stimulation of PKB is dependent on an increase in intracellular Ca2+ distal to PLC activation. We would note, however, that although BAPTA-AM always attenuated carbachol-stimulated PKB activity, its inhibitory effect was considerably reduced when presented to cells in culture medium containing serum. Because the above data suggest that PLC-mediated Ca2+ signals are capable of activating PKB, we examined the effects of reagents that influence signaling cascades downstream of Ca2+. It has been reported that Ca2+ is required for EGFR transactivation in response to activation of some G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). In the rat pheochromocytoma cell line PC12, which is widely used to study neuronal differentiation, EGFR transactivation by either bradykinin or membrane depolarization was shown to be dependent on the presence of extracellular calcium (36Zwick E. Daub H. Aoki N. Yamaguchi-Aoki Y. Tinhofer I. Maly K. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24767-24770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Recently, angiotensin II induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation was shown to be mediated by EGFR transactivation in a Ca2+ signal-dependent manner in cardiac fibroblasts (37Li X. Lee J.W. Graves L.M. Earp H.S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2574-2583Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), vascular smooth muscle cells (38Eguchi S. Numaguchi K. Iwasaki H. Matsumoto T. Yamakawa T. Utsunomiya H. Motley E.D. Kawakatsu H. Owada K.M. Hirata Y. Marumo F. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8890-8896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar), and liver epithelial cells (39Maloney J.A. Tsygankova O.M. Yang L. Li Q. Szot A. Baysal K. Williamson J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C221-C230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The EGFR transactivation itself was identified as a critical element in GPCR-induced mitogen signaling (40Hackel P.O. Zwick E. Prenzel N. Ullrich A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 184-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar) and in regulation of various ion channels (41Tsai W. Morielli A.D. Peralta E.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4597-4605Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). We examined the possibility that PKB activation might be downstream of EGFR transactivation in response to carbachol. Carbachol, however, failed to stimulate a significant increase in EGFR-tyrosine phosphorylation. In contrast, EGF-stimulated EGFR-tyrosine phosphorylation was readily detectable and could be blocked by preincubating the cells with the EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor AG1478 (Fig.7A). By contrast, we found that another member of the ErbB family, ErbB3, is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to both carbachol and EGF (Fig.7B). The phosphorylation and activation of ErbB3 is known to generate a docking site for the Src homology 2 domain of PI 3-kinase (42Tzahar E. Waterman H. Chen X. Levkowitz G. Karunagaran D. Lavi S. Ratzkin B.J. Yarden Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5276-5287Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 7B, the association of PI 3-kinase with ErbB3 increased significantly after stimulation with either carbachol or EGF, and the tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB3 increased in a time-dependent manner, with a lag phase of ∼ 2 min, and reached maximum phosphorylation at ∼15 min. AG1478 inhibited both ErbB3-tyrosine phosphorylation and PKB activation (Fig.8, A and B). Taken together, these data suggest that ErbB3 transactivation is required for activation of PKB by carbachol. We have investigated the signaling pathway linking endogenous muscarinic cholinergic receptors to the activation of PKB in 1321N1 astrocytoma cells. The evidence implicates PLC-mediated phosphoinositide hydrolysis, Ca2+, ErbB3, and the lipid products of PI 3-kinase as minimal components of the pathway. This is the first report directly demonstrating a link between a PLC-dependent signaling cascade and the activation of PKB, although other very recent studies have implied a similar conclusion (21Eguchi S. Iwasaki H. Ueno H. Frank G.D. Motley E.D. Eguchi K. Marumo F. Hirata Y. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36843-36851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). There have been several recent reports of GPCR-mediated activation of PKB. The majority of these responses involved pertussis toxin-sensitive G-proteins and were inhibited by wortmannin, suggesting a requirement for PI 3-kinase activity (12Murga C. Laguinge L. Wetzker R.

Relatively direct activation of the G-protein βγ subunit-sensitive PI 3-kinase γ and p110β isoforms has been suggested to account for some of these observations (12Murga C. Laguinge L. Wetzker R. Cuadrado A. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19080-19085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 17Murga C. Fukuhara S. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12069-12073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), but evidence also exists for indirect mechanisms involving Ras (15Hu Z.W. Shi X.Y. Lin R.Z. Hoffman B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8977-8982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and transactivation of EGF receptors (18Laffargue M. Raynal P. Yart A. Peres C. Wetzker R. Roche S. Payrastre B. Chap H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32835-32841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). By contrast, there is only one report of wortmannin-insensitive activation of PKB, which was observed in β-adrenergic receptor-stimulated rat epididymal fat cells (19Moule S.K. Welsh G.I. Edgell N.J. Foulstone E.J. Proud C.G. Denton R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7713-7719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The involvement of PI 3-kinase lipid products in carbachol-stimulated PKB activation is indicated by the marked sensitivity of the response to wortmannin, by the detection of PKB Ser473 and Thr308 phosphorylation, by the enhanced PI 3-kinase activity of p85 immunoprecipitates, and by the small but detectable increase in PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 concentration. It remains possible, however, that the effect of PI 3-kinase inhibitors in this report may be mediated by reduction of the basal level of 3-phosphoinositides rather than by blockade of carbachol-induced PI 3-kinase activation. This seems unlikely because of the role of ErbB3 transactivation in carbachol-stimulated PKB activation and the inhibitory effect of AG1478, an EGF receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor. The latter had no effect on basal PKB activity or PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 levels (data not shown). The carbachol-stimulated response seems unlikely to be the result of direct activation of PI 3-kinase by G-protein subunits. First, evidence in the literature suggests that endogenous expression of the class IB PI 3-kinase, p110γ-p101 complex, is largely restricted to cells of hemopoietic lineage (6Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 239-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar, 13Graness A. Adomeit A. Heinze R. Wetzker R. Liebmann C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32016-32022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). More recently, however, evidence has emerged suggesting that Gβγ subunits can synergistically activate a type IA PI 3-kinase in THP-1 cells stimulated with insulin, together with a stimulus for a pertussis toxin-sensitive GPCR (43Okada T. Hazeki O. Ui M. Katada T. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). By transient transfection of PI 3-kinase isoforms into NIH3T3 cells, Murgaet al. (17Murga C. Fukuhara S. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12069-12073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) concluded that PI3Kβ expression is necessary and sufficient to activate PI3K-dependent pathways by GPCRs in cells lacking PI3Kγ and that this involves the direct interaction of p110β with Gβγ subunits. By contrast, however, we have shown that PLC-coupled thrombin receptors (22Batty I.H. Downes C.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) or muscarinic receptors 2I. H. Batty and C. P. Downes, unpublished data. profoundly inhibit insulin-stimulated PtdIns (3,4,5)P3 accumulation (28Batty I.H. Hickinson D.M. Downes C.P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 1132-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) in 1321N1 cells, suggesting that such a synergistic response or direct activation of PI3K by Gβγ is not the means by which PKB is activated in these cells. This conclusion is supported by the lack of effect of pertussis toxin and by the kinetics of carbachol-stimulated PKB activity, which was delayed in relation to insulin-stimulated or other direct G-protein subunit-stimulated PI 3-kinase responses (2Walker K.S. Deak M. Paterson A. Hudson K. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 275: 13377-13385Google Scholar,12Murga C. Laguinge L. Wetzker R. Cuadrado A. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19080-19085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Experiments involving inhibition of agonist-stimulated PLC by pretreatment with phorbol esters or manipulation of cytosolic [Ca2+] using a variety of reagents and the demonstration that stimulation of PKB is a common consequence of activating several PLC-coupled receptors all strongly implicate PLC-dependent Ca2+ signals in the pathway leading to activation of PI 3-kinase and PKB. This conclusion is in accord with previously reported results obtained using cardiac myocytes (44Morisco C. Zebrowski D. Condorelli G. Tsichlis P. Vatner S.F. Sadoshima J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14466-14475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). β-Adrenergic receptor stimulation of such cells opens L-type voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels, and the resulting Ca2+ signal has been reported to mediate wortmannin-sensitive activation of PKB. Ca2+ ionophores and thapsigargin have also been shown to stimulate PKB in human embryonic kidney 293 cells (45Conus N.M. Hemmings B.A. Pearson R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4776-4782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), suggesting that the pathway described here may be quite widespread. It has been reported that Ca2+/calmodulin can directly activate PI 3-kinase (46Joyal J.L. Burks D.J. Pons S. Matter W.F. Vlahos C.J. White M.F. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28183-28186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), but this seems unlikely to explain the persistent elevation of PI 3-kinase activity we observed in well washed anti-p85 immunoprecipitates. It has been reported that EGFR transactivation is a common element in GPCR signaling (40Hackel P.O. Zwick E. Prenzel N. Ullrich A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 184-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Carbachol, however, failed to stimulate a significant increase of EGFR-tyrosine phosphorylation, although AG1478 blocked carbachol-stimulated PKB. This may reflect limited expression of EGFR in 1321N1 cells, but our data suggest that Ca2+-mediated PI 3-kinase activation involves activation of ErbB3 and the subsequent recruitment of PI 3-kinase to the ErbB3 receptor. Because ErbB3 itself lacks intrinsic protein-tyrosine kinase activity, it has been suggested that its phosphorylation occurs via heterodimerization with ErbB2 (47Graus-Porta D. Beerli R.R. Daly J.M.

The phosphorylation of ErbB2 has been reported in rat-1 cells stimulated by endothelin-1, lysophosphatidic acid, and thrombin (40Hackel P.O. Zwick E. Prenzel N. Ullrich A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 184-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). So far, the precise route from Ca2+ to ErbB3 activation is unclear. One possibility could be the induction of secretion of EGF or other ligands for ErbB3 receptors compatible with the observed delay in the activation of PKB by carbachol. However, we were not able to detect activation of PKB using conditioned medium from cells pretreated with carbachol, although this approach does not preclude release and action of EGF (or a similar ligand) in a tight autocrine loop. Recently it has been shown that EGF receptor transactivation by GPCRs involves pro-HB-EGF and a metalloproteinase activity that is rapidly induced on GPCR-ligand interaction. The cleavage of the pro-HB-EGF by the metalloproteinase appeared to be essential for the GPCR-induced EGFR transactivation and downstream signaling (50Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 2000; 402: 884-888Crossref Scopus (1482) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that Src plays a role in GPCR transactivation of EGFR (51Keely S.J. Calandrella S.O. Barrett K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12619-12625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), but this seems unlikely to explain the activation of PKB we observed in 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine (a potent Src inhibitor)-preincubated cells (data not shown). In summary, our data describes a novel mechanism coupling PLC-dependent receptors to activation of PKB. The signaling pathway involves phosphoinositide hydrolysis and the resulting Ca2+ signal, which activates PI 3-kinase via ErbB3 transactivation. Very small increases in PI 3-kinase lipid products are sufficient to regulate the phosphorylation and hence activation of PKB. Because of the inherent lag in this response, only receptors that generate persistent Ca2+ signals are likely to cause significant activation of PKB."

Widely used in solid organ and stem cell transplantation, cyclosporin A (CsA), a fungal cyclic undecapeptide, has been shown to bind to a family of intracellular immunophilin receptors, the cyclophilins (CyP) (24Schreiber S.L.

Tacrolimus (FK506), an immunosuppressant structurally unrelated to CsA but with biological properties similar to those of CsA, was found to bind to members of an intracellular immunophilin family termed FK506-binding protein (FKBP) (24Schreiber S.L.

The CyP and FKBP immunophilin families are highly conserved, ubiquitously expressed proteins that share the ability to catalyze the cis totrans isomerization of proline residues and are thus thought to play a role in protein folding and transport (24Schreiber S.L.

Although CsA and FK506 bind to and inhibit the isomerase activity of CyPs and FKBPs, respectively, it is not the inhibition of this enzymatic activity that correlates with immunosuppression (29Bierer B.E. Mattila P.S. Standaert R.F. Herzenberg L.A. Burakoff S.J. Crabtree G.R. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9231-9235Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). The complexes of CsA·CyP and, independently, of FK506·FKBP bind to and inhibit the activity of the serine/threonine phosphatase calcineurin (30Liu J. Farmer Jr., J.D. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3617) Google Scholar, 31Friedman J. Weissman I. Cell. 1991; 66: 799-806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). We used cDNA-based microarray analysis to obtain a more comprehensive view of CsA- and FK506-sensitive early genes in purified human peripheral blood T lymphocytes (PBL). The complexity of large-scale gene expression analysis was aided by the use of simultaneous hybridization using two different cDNA samples each labeled with a different fluorophore. We reasoned that changes in gene expression common to both CsA and FK506 treatment would likely be secondary to inactivation of calcineurin phosphatase activity. Additionally, perturbations in gene expression unique to one drug alone would potentially identify specific immunophilin (CyP or FKBP)-dependent gene targets. We failed to identify transcripts specifically regulated by only one immunosuppressive agent, suggesting that immunophilin-dependent, calcineurin-independent gene expression was below the limits of detection of our analysis. However, we did identify a number of CsA- and FK506-sensitive (and calcineurin-dependent) genes induced or inhibited following anti-CD3 mAb ligation in the presence of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate relative to resting cells. Although a number of these transcripts are well characterized (e.g.IL-2 and lymphotactin), the array data suggested a number of novel calcineurin-dependent substrates. Analysis of mRNA transcription and protein in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subpopulations, used to verify and extend these cDNA microarray results, demonstrated both induction of Stat5a and inhibition of IL-16, genetic elements not previously appreciated to be affected by either CsA or FK506. Hierarchy profiles of these target genes suggested relative specificity of these drugs. Human PBL were isolated from volunteer donors by apheresis. Cells were then subjected to reverse flow elutriation and Ficoll-Hypaque centrifugation and washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). PBL were resuspended in RPMI 1640 (MediaTech, Herndon, VA) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 2 mm L-glutamine, 10 mmHepes, pH7.2, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (MediaTech), and 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), termed 10% RPMI, and incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2-in-air. After overnight incubation, cells were stimulated as indicated with 10 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; Calbiochem), 1 μm ionomycin (Calbiochem), plate-bound (10 μg) or soluble (100 ng/ml) anti-CD3 mAb OKT3 (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA), 1 μg/ml anti-CD28 mAb 9.3 (the kind gift of Carl June, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia). CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes were purified by negative selection using an indirect magnetic labeling system and the MidiMACS™ columns (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA). Total RNA was prepared from resting or stimulated human PBL using TrizolTM (Invitrogen). Poly(A) mRNA was extracted using Oligotex mRNA midi-kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and quantitated using RiboGreen™ RNA quantitation kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). cDNA from resting or stimulated, CsA-, FK506-, or ethanol-treated cells were labeled with Cy3 and Cy5 fluorescent dyes for microarray hybridization. Fluorescently labeled cDNA were hybridized to UnigemTM version 1.0 human microarrays (IncyteGenomics, Palo Alto, CA). Data were analyzed using GemToolsTMsoftware and are expressed as balanced differential. Total RNA was prepared from human PBL using TrizolTM (Invitrogen) and quantitated usingA260 and a RiboGreen™ RNA quantitation kit (Molecular Probes). mRNA levels were assayed using the Onestep RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) using the following oligonucleotide purification cartridge purified primers (BioServe Biotechnologies, Laurel, MD; where F is forward and R is reverse): Stat5a-F, 5′-GAG TCT CAG TTC AGT GTT GGC AGC-3′; Stat5a-R, 5′-AGT CAC TAA AGC GCA ACA AGA AGG TC-3′; IL-16-F, 5′-TGC TGG TCT TGG GTT CAG CTT GGC-3′; IL-16-R, 5′-GTC CTG CCT AGG AGT CTC CAG CAG-3′; β-actin-F, 5′-ATC TGG CAC CAC ACC TTC TAC AAT GAG CTG CG-3′; β-actin-R, 5′-CGT CAT ACT CCT GCT TGC TGA TCC ACA TCT GC-3′; IL2-F, 5′-CAT TGC ACT AAG TCT TGC ACT TGT CA-3′; IL2-R, 5′ CGT TGA TAT TGC TGA TTA AGT CCC TG-3′. RT-PCR was performed using the following conditions: 50 °C for 30 min, 95 °C for 15 min, 30 cycles of (i) 94 °C for 1 min, (ii) 55 °C for 1 min, and (iii) 72 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 10 min. Samples were analyzed by gel electrophoresis, and bands were revealed by staining gels with ethidium bromide. Bands were quantitated by phosphorimaging analysis using ImageQuant software, and mRNA levels were normalized to β-actin mRNA levels as indicated. After stimulation of human PBL or purified CD4+ or CD8+ T lymphocytes as indicated, samples were centrifuged at 466 × g for 5 min and washed once with RPMI 1640. Cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, Na3VO4, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Samples were incubated for 20 min on ice and then centrifuged at 17,530 × g. The supernatant containing the post-nuclear lysate was removed, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (Protogel, National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA). Electrophoresed proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA), immunoblotted with a mouse anti-human Stat5a antibody (clone 89, Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Human CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were stimulated with PMA (10 ng/ml), PMA + ionomycin (1 μm), anti-CD3 (100 ng/ml) + PMA, or anti-CD3/anti-CD28 (1 μg/ml) + PMA, cells were centrifuged for 5 min at 1500 rpm, and supernatants were collected to assay for IL-16 protein. 96-well Nunc immunoplate with MaxiSorpTM surface (Nalge Nunc Int., Rochester, NY) were coated with 4 μg/ml mouse anti-human IL-16 antibody (50 μl/well) (clone 14.1, PharMingen, San Diego, CA) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Wells were then washed with 1× PBS and blocked for 2 h with blocking buffer (250 μl/well; 1% fatty-acid free bovine serum albumin, 10% fetal bovine serum, 10% calf serum in 1× PBS). Control samples containing known amounts of human IL-16 were prepared using recombinant human IL-16 (PharMingen). Sample supernatants (100 μl/well) or recombinant IL-16 standard controls (100 μl/well) were added to the 96-well plate and then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Wells were washed with 0.02% Tween 20 (in 1× PBS) and then incubated with 0.5 μg/ml biotinylated goat anti-human IL-16 (100 μl/well; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) for 1 h at 37 °C. Wells were washed as described above and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (1:1000; 100 μl/well) for 1 h at 37 °C. Finally, 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine liquid substrate (100 μl/well, Sigma) was added to each well (10 min) followed by the addition of 0.5 m sulfuric acid (100 μl/well). The signal was detected using the Fmax colorimetric plate reader (Molecular Devices). To identify transcriptional events regulated coordinately or differentially by the immunosuppressive agents CsA and FK506, we compared resting and activated human peripheral blood T cells cultured in the presence or absence of either vehicle or drug. Purified human T cells were stimulated using immobilized anti-CD3 (pCD3) mAb in concert with PMA, an agent used to activate classical forms of protein kinase C; each was used at concentrations and culture conditions known, and previously optimized, to induce IL-2 production and proliferation of T cells (data not shown). We isolated poly(A)+-selected RNA from appropriately cultured cells using standard methods, synthesized fluorescently Cy5- or Cy3-labeled cDNA from each culture, and hybridized these to cDNA microarrays using the human Unigem version 1.0 microarray (IncyteGenomics Inc.). The cDNA microarray chosen represents ∼10,000 human cDNA clones representing unique human genes identified in the NCBI UniGene data base. The distribution of fluorescence intensity ratios between cDNA prepared from resting and activated cells and between cDNA from cells activated in the absence of or in the presence of either CsA or FK506 were compared and analyzed using standard methodology (Fig.1). The majority of the genes represented were not appreciably affected either by the 4-h stimulation or by incubation with immunosuppressive agents. However, the comparison of unstimulated to anti-CD3 mAb plus PMA-stimulated cells revealed a number of genes in which expression was found to be significantly different (Fig. 1). Of genetic elements induced by anti-CD3 mAb plus PMA stimulation, ∼2000 genes had differential values between 1.0 and 1.9, whereas 76 had values ≥1.7 and were thus considered induced by T cell activation. In addition, 105 genes were found to have differential values between 2.0 and 4.9, 13 genes had values between 5.0 and 9.9, and four genes had differential values greater than 10.0. An obvious advantage of this approach was that well characterized genes (e.g. IL-2, TNFα, lymphotactin) were identified that served as robust internal controls. Of genetic elements down-regulated by T cell activation, ∼4,500 genes had differential values between −1.0 and −1.9, whereas 140 of them had values ≤ −1.7; 112 genes had differential values between −2.0 and −4.9, three genes had values between −5.0 and −9.9, and one gene had a differential value less than −10.0. Thus, multiple transcriptional events occur during the very early stages of T cell activation. To identify genes in which expression levels were differentially modulated by CsA and FK506, we compared the differential expression pattern of gene elements using fluorescently modified probes prepared from 4-h stimulated (plate-bound anti-CD3 mAb plus PMA) human PBL cultured in the presence of CsA, FK506, or vehicle alone. Twenty-seven genes were identified in which expression levels were consistently inhibited by both immunosuppressants (TableI). Among the genes identified, 22 corresponded to genes induced upon T cell activation and five showed no change with activation (compared with resting cells) but were nevertheless inhibited by drug. Again, genes previously reported to be sensitive to CsA and/or FK506 inhibition were identified, including lymphotactin, L-selectin, TNFα, and IL-2 (32Rumsaeng V. Vliagoftis H. Oh C.K. Metcalfe D.D.

Differential expression values that are not statistically significant when comparing resting and pCD3+P-treated human PBL are in parentheses (column 5). To confirm the cDNA microarray data (Table I), the regulation of Stat5a mRNA was explored further. Stat5a is a member of the STAT family of transcription factors that has been shown to mediate cytokine, growth factor, and hormone responses (36Yasukawa H. Sasaki A. Yoshimura A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 143-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 37Herrington J. Smit L.S. Schwartz J. Carter-Su C. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2585-2597Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) and to play a critical role in cell cycle progression. Phosphorylated STAT proteins form homodimeric and heteromeric complexes that, together with other transcription factors, induce transcriptional activation of a number of target genes. Among the STAT family of proteins are two closely related Stat5 proteins, Stat5a and Stat5b, that are both activated by a number of cytokines including IL-2 and IL-4 (38Lin J.X. Migone T.S. Tsang M.

The importance of Stat5a and Stat5b in T cell function has been underscored by mice rendered genetically deficient in either Stat5a and Stat5b; the lymphocytes derived from these mice display defects in both T cell proliferation and function (42Nakajima H.

Although the role of and factors that influence Stat5a in T cell cycle progression have been extensively studied, much less is know about the transcriptional regulation of its expression. Stat5a mRNA from unstimulated or treated peripheral blood T cells was analyzed by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR (Fig.2). The high basal expression of Stat5a mRNA in resting, purified human PBL (Fig. 2A, upper panel, lane 1) was enhanced by stimulation with the calcium ionophore ionomycin (lane 3) and further induced by the combination of PMA and ionomycin (lane 5). Cyclosporine pretreatment minimally reduced basal Stat5a mRNA expression (lane 2) and partially attenuated ionomycin (lane 4) and ionomycin plus PMA (lane 6)-dependent Stat5a transcriptional activation. As expected, IL-2 mRNA levels were present at very low levels in resting human PBL (Fig. 2A, lower panel, lane 1) and were induced minimally by calcium agonists (lane 3) and more significantly by PMA plus ionomycin (lane 5). As anticipated (45Yoshimura N. Kahan B.D. Transplantation. 1985; 40: 661-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 46Kahan B.D. N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 321: 1725-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar), CsA reduced both basal and stimulated IL-2 transcription. The induction of Stat5a mRNA by PMA plus ionomycin was found to be sensitive to incubation with the inhibitor of transcription actinomycin D (ActD, Fig. 2B). This latter finding suggests that Stat5a mRNA induction was dependent, at least in part, on new mRNA transcription and was not due solely to mRNA stabilization (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, Stat5a mRNA levels in stimulated cells pretreated with both CsA and ActD was less than that found in cells pretreated with CsA alone, implying that new Stat5a mRNA synthesis contributes not only to inductive, stimulation-dependent (and CsA-inhibitable) mRNA but also to basal Stat5a expression. Similar results were noted in samples derived from cells stimulated with anti-CD3 mAb (OKT3) plus PMA (data not shown). To determine whether the induction and suppression of Stat5a mRNA translated into changes in protein expression, post-nuclear lysates of appropriately treated PBL were subjected to immunoblotting analysis (Fig. 2C). Compared with resting cells, Stat5a protein was induced in cells stimulated with ionomycin, PMA, PMA plus ionomycin, anti-CD3 mAb, or anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 mAb (Fig. 2C). Although CsA pretreatment attenuated Stat5a protein expression in ionomycin-, anti-CD3 mAb plus PMA-, or anti-CD3/anti-CD28 mAb plus PMA-treated cells, CsA had no appreciable affect on PMA plus ionomycin- or PMA-only treated cells. Purified CD4+ and CD8+ subpopulations of T cells demonstrated a similar pattern of responses (Fig.3). Note that the basal expression of Stat5a was reproducibly greater in resting purified CD8+ T cells compared with CD4+ T cells. Although some variability was noted in the extent of CsA-dependent inhibition between different healthy donors, the pattern was similar in all experiments. Taken together, these results confirm and extend the results of the cDNA microarray analysis to demonstrate"

It can also use enterobactin as a xenosiderophore. We began this work by sequencing the 5′-upstream region of the fct-cbsCEBA operon, which encodes the ferric chrysobactin receptor and proteins involved in synthesis of the catechol moiety. We identified a new iron-regulated gene (cbsH) transcribed divergently relative to thefct gene, the translated sequence of which is 45.6% identical to that of Escherichia coli ferric enterobactin esterase. Insertions within this gene interrupt the chrysobactin biosynthetic pathway by exerting a polar effect on a downstream gene with some sequence identity to the E. coli enterobactin synthase gene. These mutations had no effect on the ability of the bacterium to obtain iron from enterobactin, showing that a functionalcbsH gene is not required for iron removal from ferric enterobactin in E. chrysanthemi. ThecbsH-negative mutants were less able to utilize ferric chrysobactin, and this effect was not caused by a defect in transportper se. In a nonpolar cbsH-negative mutant, chrysobactin accumulated intracellularly. These defects were rescued by the cbsH gene supplied on a plasmid. The amino acid sequence of the CbsH protein revealed characteristics of the S9 prolyl oligopeptidase family. Ferric chrysobactin hydrolysis was detected in cell extracts from a cbsH-positive strain that was inhibited by diisopropyl fluorophosphate. These data are consistent with the fact that chrysobactin is ad-lysyl-l-serine derivative. Mössbauer spectroscopy of whole cells at various states of57Fe-labeled chrysobactin uptake showed that this enzyme is not required for iron removal from chrysobactin in vivo. The CbsH protein may therefore be regarded as a peptidase that prevents the bacterial cells from being intracellularly iron-depleted by chrysobactin. Under iron limitation, the plant pathogenErwinia chrysanthemi produces the catechol-type siderophore chrysobactin, which acts as a virulence factor. It can also use enterobactin as a xenosiderophore.

The bioavailability of the ferric ion is extremely limited because of its poor solubility (at pH 7,Ksp (solubility product) of Fe(OH)3 = 10−17m).

Diolez A. Expert D. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2419-2426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These mutants do not acquire iron from ferric enterobactin. Enterobactin is not synthesized by E. chrysanthemi cells, but promotes growth of a chrysobactin-deficient mutant if supplied exogenously. An iron-regulated outer membrane protein with an apparent molecular mass of 88,000 Da and immunologically related to the E. coliferric enterobactin receptor FepA is thought to play a similar function in E. chrysanthemi (21Enard C. Franza T. Neema C. Gill P.R. Persmark M. Neilands J.B. Expert D. Plant Soil. 1991; 130: 263-271Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In addition, E. chrysanthemi strain 3937 produces another high-affinity iron uptake system mediated by a citrate siderophore called achromobactin (22Münzinger M. Budzikiewicz H. Expert D. Enard C. Meyer J.-M. Z. Naturforsch. 2000; 55C: 328-332Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar).Most of the proteins involved in chrysobactin-mediated iron transport are encoded by a 50-kb contiguous region of the E. chrysanthemi chromosome (20Enard C.

In E. chrysanthemi, as in E. coli and many other bacterial species, control by iron is achieved via a fur gene that encodes a protein highly similar to the E. coli Fur regulator (32Franza T. Sauvage C. Expert D. Mol. Plant Microbe Interact. 1999; 12: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In the presence of ferrous iron as a cofactor, theE. coli Fur protein acts as a transcriptional repressor by binding to operator-specific sequences (Fur or iron boxes) (33de Lorenzo V. Giovannini F. Herrero M. Neilands J.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 875-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar,34Escolar L. Perez-Martin J. de Lorenzo V. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6223-6229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Sequence analysis of the 5′-upstream region of the fct gene revealed the existence of a gene (cbsH) transcribed in the opposite direction to the fct gene that shares identity with the E. coli fes gene. The functional analysis of thecbsH gene product is presented.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we report the functional analysis of a new gene (cbsH) that belongs to the chrysobactin-dependent iron transport gene cluster ofE. chrysanthemi strain 3937. The cbsH gene is the first gene of an operon involved in chrysobactin biosynthesis and transcribed from the iron-regulated divergent promoterfct-cbsH, which controls, in the opposite orientation, the transcription of the fct-cbsCEBA operon, identified earlier (23Franza T. Expert D. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6874-6881Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cbsH gene is 64% identical to the E. coli fes gene for the 871 nucleotides from positions 272 to 1143. It encodes a polypeptide with an apparent molecular mass of 43,000 Da, a size similar to that reported for the E. coli Fes protein (25Pettis G.S. Brickman T.J. McIntosh M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18857-18863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The CbsH protein is 45.6% identical to the Fes protein ofE. coli, 46% identical to the Fes protein of Yersinia enterocolitica (57Schubert S. Fischer D. Heesemann J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6387-6395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and 42% identical to Salmonella enterica IroD (iroD gene, GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank accession number U97227), with the level of identity uniform over the entire amino acid sequence (according to the program BLAST)The presence in E. chrysanthemi of a homolog of the ferric enterobactin esterase of E. coli was expected. E. chrysanthemi has a ferric enterobactin transport system that supplies the cell with iron. As the hydrolysis of ferric enterobactin is essential in E. coli cells, we thought it likely that this molecule would have the same fate in E. chrysanthemi.We have shown that the CbsH protein is not required for the removal of iron from ferric enterobactin in E. chrysanthemi. These data indicate that cleavage of the ester bonds of ferric enterobactin is not required in E. chrysanthemi for iron reduction and release. This was not because of the presence of an additionalfes-like gene on the E. chrysanthemi chromosome, as shown by DNA/DNA hybridization analysis (data not shown). In contrast, the Fes homolog from Y. enterocolitica appears to be absolutely required for ferric enterobactin utilization in this bacterium (57Schubert S. Fischer D. Heesemann J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6387-6395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the viuB gene from Vibrio cholerae, which is involved in vibriobactin processing, can complement the E. coli fes mutation (58Butterton J.R. Calderwood S.B. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5631-5638Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). No functional complementation of the E. coli fes mutation was observed with the E. chrysanthemi cbsH gene. These results show that iron release from enterobactin is not CbsH-dependent. Instead, a Fes/CbsH-independent mechanism has to be considered.We should point out that the role of the E. coli ferric enterobactin esterase has been much debated. In particular, several experimental aspects have remained unexplained (10Greenwood K.T. Luke R.K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 525: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 11Brickman T.J. McIntosh M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12350-12355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 59Cohen S.M. Meyer M. Raymond K.N. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 6277-6286Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). For instance, this enzyme is required for the removal of iron from enterobactin analogs devoid of ester bonds (60Hollifield W.C. Neilands J.B. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 1922-1928Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 61Heidinger S. Braun V. Pecorado V.L. Raymond K.N. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 109-115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The redox potential of a ferric siderophore depends on the binding constant for iron and thus on the capacity of the molecule to be protonated at neutral pH (62Cooper S.R. McArdle J.V. Raymond K.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 3551-3554Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). If the internal pH of E. chrysanthemi were slightly lower than that of E. coli, then iron would be easier to extract in E. chrysanthemi than in E. coli. Cohen et al. (59Cohen S.M. Meyer M. Raymond K.N. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 6277-6286Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar) have reported that enterobactin, like synthetic analogs such as TRENSAM, may adopt a Tris salicylate mode of binding if sequentially protonated, with iron release facilitated by a biological reductant.On the basis of amino acid sequence comparisons, we found that the CbsH protein displays characteristics of the S9 prolyl oligopeptidase family (48Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 19-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar), viz. the conservation of amino acids around the catalytic triad Ser, Asp, and His (Fig. 5). The S9 family contains serine peptidases with a varied range of restricted specificities, including oligopeptidase B from eubacteria, which cleaves arginyl and lysyl bonds. In agreement with sequence predictions, we showed that the CbsH protein is an enzyme able to degrade ferric chrysobactin in the cytosol. This hydrolytic activity is thiol-dependent and inhibited by fluorophosphates such as diisopropyl fluorophosphate. Given the chrysobactin structure (Fig. 1), it is very likely that this enzyme cleaves the lysyl bond, thus forming 2,3-dihydroxybenzoyllysine and serine.To further understand the role of this enzyme, we analyzed the cellular distribution and redox state of iron following the transport of ferric chrysobactin into the cytosol using Mössbauer spectroscopy. After 30 min of incubation with 57Fe-labeled chrysobactin, the Mössbauer spectra of the cbsH-positive strain and of acbsH-negative mutant showed mainly ferrous iron. The total lack of ferric chrysobactin and the initially observed high-ferrous iron contribution in the cell spectra of Erwinia clearly demonstrate that ferric chrysobactin transport is followed by a very rapid intracellular enzymatic iron reduction. Because ferric chrysobactin is transported across the cell membranes via a highly specific receptor-mediated pathway (18Sauvage C. Franza T. Expert D. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1227-1231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the reduction obviously occurs at the level of the cytoplasmic membrane or in the cytosol. The affinity of catecholate siderophores for ferrous iron is very low. Even water is a better chelator of ferrous high-spin iron than these siderophores. Therefore, the presence of ferrous iron provides evidence for a rapid reductive release of the metal from its carrier, preventing an observable intracellular concentration of 57Fe-labeled chrysobactin. Although a ferrous hexaquo complex is stable in a strict reductive (and anaerobic) environment, it is very likely that the reduced metal is complexed by a specific intracellular chelator to prevent Haber-Weiss-Fenton chemistry (50Matzanke B.F. Winkelmann G. Handbook of Microbial Iron Chelates (Siderophores). CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 15-60Google Scholar). Previously, we found that ferrous iron constitutes one of the major cellular iron species in many microorganisms under conditions of siderophore-controlled growth (52Böhnke R. Matzanke B.F. BioMetals. 1995; 8: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar,53Matzanke B.F. Winkelmann G. Carrano C.J. Transition Metals in Microbial Metabolism. Harwood Academic Publishers GmbH, Amsterdam, The Netherlands1994: 117-158Google Scholar). The corresponding compound has been isolated from E. coli and from Pantoea agglomerans 2B. F. Matzanke, unpublished data. and partially characterized as an oligomeric sugar phosphate (52Böhnke R. Matzanke B.F. BioMetals. 1995; 8: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). It was termed ferrochelatin (53Matzanke B.F. Winkelmann G. Carrano C.J. Transition Metals in Microbial Metabolism. Harwood Academic Publishers GmbH, Amsterdam, The Netherlands1994: 117-158Google Scholar). Based on the previous studies, we attribute the detected ferrous iron to ferrochelatin. Whereas ferrochelatin-bound iron keeps its intracellular concentration at a certain level (∼0.3% effect), the second component of the Mössbauer spectra increases its contribution by time and represents the major component after 2 h of incubation. Based on the temperature-dependent Mössbauer spectra and their parameters, the conclusion must be drawn that this component represents a bacterioferritin-like iron storage compound. Thus, ferrous iron released from chrysobactin is immediately transferred into the iron storage form, where it is oxidized again at the ferroxidase site (71Frolow F. Kalb A.J. Yariv J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 72Le Brun N.E. Andrews S.C. Guest J.R. Harrison P.M. Moore G.R. Thomson A.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 385-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In summary, the Mössbauer spectroscopic analysis shows significant differences neither in the chrysobactin-mediated iron uptake between the parental strain and its mutant nor in the metabolic distribution pattern. Based on the results of this investigation, it is safe to state that metabolic utilization of both enterobactin- and chrysobactin-bound iron is not cbsH-dependent (see scheme shown in Fig.8).Figure 8Schematic drawing of ferric chrysobactin uptake and its metabolic utilization in E. chrysanthemi.Cb, chrysobactin;Fe [Cb]3; ferric chrysobactin; DHB, 2,3-dihydroxybenzoyl.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)As described above, there is good evidence for hydrolytic cleavage of chrysobactin by CbsH. In addition, long-term growth inhibition has been observed in cbsH-negative mutants. This ligand hydrolysis occurs obviously after iron removal, and lack of hydrolysis in the mutants results in growth inhibition. This unexpected finding might be linked either to utilization of the aromatic systems of chrysobactin for anabolic reactions or to a role of cbsH in intracellular iron homeostasis. Within the rationale of bacterial iron metabolism, we favor the latter line of thought. The free chrysobactin ligand is thermodynamically capable of extracting ferric iron from all intracellular ferric iron sources exhibiting a lower complex formation constant than that of ferric chrysobactin. In addition, recent studies on the uptake of iron(III) by chrysobactin have shown that the carboxyl group of the serine residue in chrysobactin strongly influences the kinetics of formation of the ferric complex. 3A.-M. Albrecht-Gary, personal communication. To prevent iron removal from metabolically active enzymes or from any accessible intracellular iron pool, either the ligand has to be re-excreted (which is known for some bacterial siderophore uptake systems), or it must be degraded or modified. At this point, it is important to note that the nonpolar cbsH-negative mutant behaves as if it was severely iron-depleted, although it contains high levels of ferric chrysobactin. This finding fits well with our hypothesis because an intracellular post-transport recomplexation of iron by the non-degraded ligand seems to occur. In summary, taking all pieces of circumstantial evidence together, we suggest that hydrolytic degradation of chrysobactin by CbsH is aimed at keeping the intracellular iron distribution at a well regulated level (iron homeostasis) in E. chrysanthemistrain 3937. Iron is an essential but nevertheless potentially toxic element for most living organisms. The bioavailability of the ferric ion is extremely limited because of its poor solubility (at pH 7,Ksp (solubility product) of Fe(OH)3 = 10−17m).

Phytopathol. 1999; 37: 307-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Chrysobactin is a bidentate ligand consisting of a monomer of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoyl-d-lysyl-l-serine (16Persmark M. Expert D. Neilands J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3187-3193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). Ferric chrysobactin is transported back into the cell via its specific TonB-dependent outer membrane receptor Fct (17Persmark M. Expert D. Neilands J.B. J.

Diolez A. Expert D. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2419-2426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These mutants do not acquire iron from ferric enterobactin. Enterobactin is not synthesized by E. chrysanthemi cells, but promotes growth of a chrysobactin-deficient mutant if supplied exogenously. An iron-regulated outer membrane protein with an apparent molecular mass of 88,000 Da and immunologically related to the E. coliferric enterobactin receptor FepA is thought to play a similar function in E. chrysanthemi (21Enard C.

The present study indicates that they directly interact in vitro. The interaction was investigated with overlay experiments, surface plasmon resonance experiments, and solid-phase immunoassays by immobilizing one factor or the other and by steady-state fluorescence analysis. The interaction observed was specific, dose-dependent, and saturable, and the bFGF/PDGF-BB binding stoichiometry was found to be 2:1.KD1 for the first step equilibrium and the overall KD values were found to be in the nanomolar and in the picomolar range, respectively. Basic FGF/PDGF-BB interaction was strongly reduced as a function of time of PDGF-BB proteolysis. Furthermore, docking analysis suggested that the PDGF-BB region interacting with bFGF may overlap, at least in part, with the PDGF-BB receptor-binding site. This hypothesis was supported by surface plasmon resonance experiments showing that an anti-PDGF-BB antibody, known to inhibit PDGF-BB binding with its receptor, strongly reduced bFGF/PDGF-BB interaction, whereas a control antibody was ineffective. According to these data, the observed bFGF·PDGF-BB complex formation might explain, at least in part, previous observations showing that PDGF-BB chemotactic and mitogenic activity on smooth muscle cells are strongly inhibited in the presence of bFGF.

Both bFGF and PDGF are reported to be increased in a variety of conditions including tumor growth (8Westphal J.R. Van't Hullenaar R. Peek R. Willems R.W. Crickard K. Crickard U. Askaa J.

Ross R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5154-5160Google Scholar) consisting of two polypeptides, designated as A- and B-chain, sharing about 60% sequence homology (15Betzholtz C. Johnsson A. Heldin C.-H.

Recently, PDGF-C and PDGF-D isoforms were also identified (19Bergsten E. Uutela M. Li X. Pietras K. Ostman A. Heldin C.H. Alitalo K. Eriksson U. Nat.

PDGF-BB and PDGF-AA exhibit different functional effects, depending on the binding with two distinct cell surface tyrosine kinase receptors, α and β. The α receptors bind PDGF-AA, -AB, -BB, and -CC with high affinity, whereas β receptors bind only BB and DD dimers with high affinity (19Bergsten E. Uutela M. Li X. Pietras K. Ostman A. Heldin C.H.

PDGF-BB crystallographic analysis revealed that the two chains are arranged in an antiparallel manner. Each subunit consists of a tight cystine knot motif with two loops, loops 1 and 3, pointing in one direction and one loop, i.e. loop 2, pointing in the other directions. Due to this antiparallel arrangement, loops 1 and 3 of one subunit are juxtaposed to loop 2 of the other. Mutational analyses mapped the receptor-binding sites mainly within loops 1 and 3, and within loop 2 to some extent (23Oefner C. D'Arcy A. Winkler F.K. Eggimann B. Hosang M.

Basic FGF belongs to a family of at least 22 polypeptides (28Nishimura T. Nakatake Y. Konishi M. Itoh N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1492: 203-206Google Scholar, 29Coulier F. Pontarotti P.

Basic FGF crystallographic analyses showed a “β-trefoil” fold consisting of three copies of a basic four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet (32Zhu X. Komiya H. Chirino A. Faham S. Fox G.M. Arakawa T.

This growth factor acts through high affinity tyrosine kinase receptors (34Givol D. Yayon A. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3362-3369Google Scholar) and through low affinity heparan sulfate proteoglycan receptors (35Rapraeger A.C. Krufka A. Olwin B.B.

Williams L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22814-22819Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been suggested that bFGF activates multiple signaling pathways by also utilizing FGF receptor monomers or multimers (44Krufka A. Guimond S. Rapraeger A.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11131-11141Google Scholar). PDGF and bFGF may be released simultaneously and at the same site bothin vitro and in vivo (45Crowley S.T. Ray C.J. Nawaz D. Majack R.A.

Circulation. 1992; 86: 43-46Google Scholar). We have shown previously that bFGF reduces in vitro the chemotactic and mitogenic activity of PDGF-BB on VSMC (51De Facchiano A. Marchis F. Turchetti E. Facchiano F. Guglielmi M. Denaro A. Palumbo R. Scoccianti M. Capogrossi M.C. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2855-2863Google Scholar) and that bFGF angiogenic properties are markedly reduced by PDGF-BB (82De Marchis F. Ribatti D. Giampietri C. Lentini A. Faraone D. Scoccianti M. Capogrossi M.C. Facchiano A. Blood. 2002; (in press)Google Scholar). We therefore tested in this study whether a direct interaction between the two factors occurs, which may underlie the observed functional inhibition. Fluorescence titration, overlay assays, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurements, and solid-phase immunoassays were carried out to evaluate and characterize the interaction between bFGF and PDGF-BB. The BIAcore instrument (BIAcoreX), sensor chips CM5, surfactant P20, the amine coupling kit containingN-hydroxysuccinimide,N-ethyl-N′-(3-diethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide, and ethanolamine hydrochloride were from Amersham Biosciences AB. Recombinant human PDGF-BB and acidic FGF (aFGF) were purchased from R & D Systems (Abingdon, UK); recombinant human bFGF, fibronectin, and vitronectin were purchased from Invitrogen; elastase was purchased from Worthington; bovine serum albumin fraction V (BSA) was purchased from Sigma; blotting grade blocker nonfat dry milk was from Bio-Rad;125I-bFGF and Hybond ECL membranes were purchased from Amersham Biosciences AB. Antibodies used in this study include purified mouse anti-PDGF-BB/AB monoclonal antibody (clone Sis1, PharMingen, San Diego, CA), goat anti-human bFGF, and anti-human PDGF-BB antibodies (R & D Systems), rabbit anti-goat IgG (H + L) horseradish peroxidase-conjugated and rabbit anti-goat IgG (H+L) alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibodies (Pierce). Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), leupeptin, DTT, and trypsin were purchased from Sigma. Steady-state fluorescence titration was performed on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences 50B fluorimeter. The excitation wavelength was set at 280 nm, and the emission originated by both tyrosyl and tryptophyl fluorophores was followed in the 300–360 nm range at 20 °C. In all experiments equal bandwidths were used for both excitation and emission, and the integration time was 1 s. To obtain information on binding constant and stoichiometry, experiments were carried out according to the Continuous Variation Method (52Job P. Ann. Chim. 1928; 9: 113-203Google Scholar, 53Huang C.Y. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 509-525Google Scholar). Variable amounts of the two proteins were mixed so that the sum of their concentrations was held constant at 2 μm, throughout the experiment. The individual contribution of the two species, which is linear with the concentration and was estimated by distinct dilution experiments, was always subtracted from the total fluorescence signal. Under these conditions, the minimum fluorescence signal is recorded at the molar ratio corresponding with the complex stoichiometric ratio (52Job P. Ann. Chim. 1928; 9: 113-203Google Scholar, 53Huang C.Y. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 509-525Google Scholar). Two types of experiments were carried out, with protein concentrations falling within the fluorescence linearity. In the first set of experiments small aliquots of 2 μm bFGF dissolved in phosphate-buffer solution (PBS) without Ca2+ and without Mg2+, pH 7.2, were added to 2 μm PDGF-BB dissolved in the same buffer. In the range of molar ratios explored, i.e.[bFGF]/[PDGF-BB] from 0 to 1.7, the trend of the fluorescence signal was monotonic. Then a second set of experiments was carried out by adding small aliquots of 2 μm PDGF-BB dissolved in PBS without Ca2+ and without Mg2+, pH 7.2, to 2 μm bFGF dissolved in the same buffer with [bFGF]/[PDGF-BB] molar ratio from 0 to 1.8. A fluorescence minimum was observed at a PDGF-BB/bFGF molar ratio of about 0.5, suggesting a 2:1 bFGF/PDGF-BB binding stoichiometry. Fluorescence data were then smoothed by means of the Savitzky-Golay filter implemented in the software package Scientist by MicroMath (Salt Lake City, UT), and nonlinear least squares analysis was performed according to the one-step equilibrium (Reaction 1),PDGF­BB+2bFGF⇔KDPDGF­BB(bFGF)2REACTION1 Three hundred fifty nanograms of either bFGF, PDGF-BB, aFGF, fibronectin, vitronectin, elastase, anti-bFGF, or anti-PDGF-BB antibodies were spotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane, which was then blocked with 5% milk in TPBS (0.1% Tween 20 in PBS). After washing extensively with TPBS, the membrane was incubated with 125I-bFGF (1 μCi, 2 ml, 10 ng/ml) for 4 h at room temperature and washed extensively with TPBS. Nitrocellulose was exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film (Eastman Kodak Co.) and subjected to densitometric analysis on GS 710 Calibrated Imaging Densitometer (Bio-Rad). SPR assays were performed on a BIAcoreX instrument equipped with a two-flow cell sensor chip. Basic FGF immobilization was carried out on one flow cell, here referred to as “sample flow cell,” and the second flow cell was used as a control cell. Basic FGF was covalently coupled to the CM5 sensor chip after activation of the carboxymethylated dextran surface by a mixture of 0.05 mN-hydroxysuccinimide and 0.2mN-ethyl-N′-(3-diethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide according to a published procedure (54Goretzki L. Burg M.A. Grako K.A. Stallcup W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16831-16837Google Scholar). The coupling reaction was performed by injecting bFGF (80 μl, 1.25 μg/ml) diluted in 30 mm acetate buffer, pH 4.8. The residual activated groups were blocked with 1 m ethanolamine hydrochloride, pH 8.5. Immobilized bFGF achieved about 500 resonance unit (RU) signals, corresponding approximately to a concentration of 0.5 ng/mm2 (55Bailly S. Brand C. Chambaz E.M. Feige J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16329-16334Google Scholar). The integrity of the immobilized growth factor was tested by injecting a polyclonal anti-bFGF antibody. All experiments were performed using HBS (10 mm Hepes, 0.15m NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.005% surfactant P20, pH 7.4) as running buffer and to dilute the injected factors. A flow rate of 30 μl/min was used throughout the experiments. Soluble ligands, namely PDGF-BB, aFGF, vitronectin, BSA, fibronectin, and PDGF-AA (30 μl), were injected for a 30-s association phase, followed by HBS flow for a 2-min dissociation phase. The response expressed as sensorgram, in RU versus time, was monitored at 25 °C. In the current study, the RU response was always reported as the difference between signals arising from the sample and the reference cell. Therefore, bulk refractive index background and nonspecific binding of the soluble ligands were always subtracted. Sensor chip regeneration was successfully achieved by injecting 10 μl of 50 mm NaOH after each injection. All injections were carried out in triplicate. Experiments were carried out on two different sensor chips and similar results were obtained. A low immobilization level as well as a high flow rate (30 μl/min) and analyte concentrations suitable to limit the mass transport phenomenon were used to optimize the kinetic evaluation, according to published reports (55Bailly S. Brand C. Chambaz E.M. Feige J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16329-16334Google Scholar). In additional experiments, PDGF-BB (10 μl, 500 nm) was injected for a 2-min association phase, both in the presence and in the absence of two different anti-PDGF-BB antibodies (100 μg/ml), or 0.1 mm PMSF or 0.1 mm DTT, followed by HBS flow for a 30-s dissociation phase. A flow rate of 5 μl/min was used throughout this experiment. Basic FGF binding to PDGF-BB was also evaluated by solid-phase immunoassays carried out as described (56Di Stasio E. Sciandra F.G. Di Maras B. Tommaso F. Petrucci T.C. Giardina B. Brancaccio A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 274-278Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, microtiter plates (Costar) were coated by incubating 100 μl/well of PDGF-BB or heat-denatured PDGF-BB (100 °C for 20 min) or BSA (7 μg/ml) in AC7.5 buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2) for 4 h at 4 °C. Then incubation with 3% BSA (300 μl/well) in AC7.5 buffer was carried out overnight at 4 °C. All subsequent operations were carried out at room temperature and by using 100 μl/well. After washing three times with AC7.5T/BSA buffer (AC7.5 containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 1 mg/ml BSA), wells were incubated with serial dilutions of bFGF or denatured bFGF (100 °C for 20 min) for 4 h. They were washed four times as described above and incubated with anti-bFGF or anti-PDGF-BB antibodies for 1 h. Plates were then washed three times and incubated with rabbit anti-goat IgG (H + L) alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibody (1:1000 dilution) for 1 h and washed once with AC7.5T/BSA and twice with diethanolamine buffer (10 mm diethanolamine, 0.5 mmMgCl2). Plates were then stained with 1 mg/ml ofp-nitrophenyl phosphate in diethanolamine buffer (100 μl/well), and absorption at 405 nm (A405) was determined. SPR sensorgrams were analyzed by nonlinear least squares curve fitting using BIAevaluation software version 3.0 (Amersham Biosciences AB) and according to published procedures (57Herzog A. Szegedi C. Jona I. Herberg F.W. Varsanyi M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 472: 73-77Google Scholar, 58Di Russo K. Stasio E. Macchia G. Rosa G. Brancaccio A. Petrucci T.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Kinetic constants were generated of the association and dissociation curves from SPR experiments by fitting to a single site binding model (Langmuir model) (Reaction 2). A+B⇔KD1ABREACTION2According to this model, a single exponential fit with a χ2 < 0.5 was computed. Equation 1 was used for the dissociation phase,Rt=R0exp(−kd(t−t0))Equation 1 where Rt is the amount of bound ligand expressed in RU at time t, and t0 is the beginning of dissociation phase. The final dissociation rate constant, kd, was calculated from the mean values obtained from injections performed at least in triplicate. To analyze the association phase, Equation 2 was employed according to BIAtechnology Handbook,Rt=Req(1−exp(−ks(t−t0)))Equation 2 where Req is the amount of bound ligand, expressed in RU, at equilibrium, and t0 is the starting time of injection, and as shown in Equation 3,ks=kaC+kdEquation 3 where C is the concentration of analyte injected over the sensor chip surface. The association rate constantka was determined as the slope of aksversus C plot. The apparent equilibrium dissociation constant, KD1, was determined as the ratio of these two kinetic constants (kd/ka). Solid-phase immunoassay data were analyzed by nonlinear regression, by fitting to two independent, nonequivalent sites binding model, to evaluate the apparent equilibrium dissociation constants (KD1 andKD2) according to the following Reactions 3 and 4,PDGF­BB+bFGF⇔KD1PDGF­BB(bFGF)REACTION3PDGF­BB(bFGF)+bFGF⇔KD2PDGF­BB(bFGF)2−REACTION4This choice was consistent with the biphasic appearance of double-reciprocal plots and was justified by the fact that a single immobilized PDGF-BB molecule shows two potential binding sites, one in each monomer. PDGF-BB and bFGF crystallographic structures were from the Protein Data Bank (codes 1pdgand 2bfh, respectively). The 1pdg model consists of three chains, named A, B, and C. A and B form a noncrystallographic disulfide-linked BB dimer, whereas C is part of a crystallographic disulfide-linked dimer. The docking simulation was carried out by using the A and B chains. Both chains lack three short segments, not visible in the electron map. The GRAMM software was used (60Katchalski-Katzir E. Shariv I. Eisenstein M. Friesem A.A. Aflalo C. Vakser I.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2195-2199Google Scholar) to search for the best putative interaction between PDGF-BB and bFGF, by performing an exhaustive six-dimensional search through the relative molecular translations and rotations. The simulation was performed by setting parameters suitable for high resolution docking (mmode, generic; eta, 3.0; ro, 30; fr, 0; crang, atom_radius; ccti, gray; crep, all; maxm, 1000; ai, 10) according to a published report (61Vakser A. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 37-41Google Scholar). The bFGF/PDGF-BB molecular assembly with the lowest potential energy was then further evaluated to identify residues putatively involved in the interaction. PDGF-BB (400 ng in 50 mmTris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.0) was incubated with trypsin (200 pg) and diluted in the same buffer at 24 °C (62Nemoto T. Sato N. Iwanari H. Yamashita H. Takagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26179-26187Google Scholar, 63Nawratil P. Lenzen S. Kellermann J. Haupt H. Schinke T. Muller-Esterl W. Jahnen-Dechent W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31735-31741Google Scholar). Proteolysis was allowed to proceed for different times (5, 20, 40, 80, and 160 min) and was stopped with 0.1 mm leupeptin. The interaction of such samples with immobilized bFGF was then evaluated by SPR according to the procedure reported above. A 2-min association phase was followed by a 30-s dissociation phase. A flow rate of 5 μl/min was used throughout this experiment. Trypsinized PDGF-BB was also subjected to SDS-PAGE (400 ng/lane) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane for Western blot analysis and revealed with a polyclonal anti-PDGF-BB antibody (R & D Systems). Increasing amounts of 2 μm stock solution of PDGF-BB were added to a fixed amount of 2 μm stock solution of bFGF, and the fluorescence was measured at 330 nm. Then the individual contribution of bFGF and PDGF-BB was subtracted from the total fluorescence signal, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The resulting fluorescence was plotted against the concentration of the added species, showing a minimum at about 0.7 μm PDGF-BB (Fig.1A). According to the Continuous Variation Method used to analyze these data (52Job P. Ann. Chim. 1928; 9: 113-203Google Scholar, 53Huang C.Y. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 509-525Google Scholar), the Job plot suggested that the formation of bFGF·PDGF-BB complex occurs with a 2:1 binding stoichiometry, implying that both disulfide-linked subunits of PDGF-BB are available to interact with monomeric bFGF. Similar results were obtained collecting the signal at other wavelengths (344 and 360 nm). The minimum shown by Job plots does not substantially depend on the model chosen to treat binding data, provided the sum of concentrations of the two interacting species is large relative to the dissociation constant (53Huang C.Y. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 509-525Google Scholar), as in the present case. In fact, the one-step dissociation constant (KD) of the ternary complex was estimated in the picomolar range (5.4×10−12m2), and the total concentration of the two proteins was 2 μm throughout the experiment. These values were used to calculate the complex concentration as a function of the total concentration of PDGF-BB (Fig. 1B). To detect whether specific interaction exists between bFGF and PDGF-BB, several molecules, namely bFGF, PDGF-BB, aFGF, fibronectin, vitronectin, elastase, anti-bFGF, and anti-PDGF-BB antibodies, were immobilized onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was then overlaid with 125I-bFGF (1 μCi; 10 ng/ml) and exposed to a Kodak X-Omat AR film. In these assays all species were under native conditions. Results shown in Fig.2 indicate a marked interaction of labeled bFGF with immobilized bFGF, as well as with immobilized PDGF-BB and anti-bFGF antibody. In contrast, labeled bFGF did not show any interaction with aFGF, fibronectin, vitronectin, elastase, and anti-PDGF-BB antibody. Table I shows the mean densitometry values, expressed as percent versus bFGF, of four different experiments. These data show that under these conditions bFGF specifically interacts with PDGF-BB.Table IOverlay assay, densitometric analysis for the interaction of labeled bFGF with different immobilized factorsImmobilized factors% bFGF densitometry/bFGF densitometry on bFGFPDGF-BB88.64 ± 22.92Anti-bFGF121.38 ± 18.00Fibronectin0.88 ± 0.07Vitronectin0.685 ± 0.02aFGF0.565 ± 0.17Elastase0.08 ± 0.01Anti-PDGF-BB0.53 ± 0.04Data are expressed as percent versus bFGF. Open table in a new tab Data are expressed as percent versus bFGF. Kinetic experiments were performed on a BIAcoreX by immobilizing bFGF and subsequently injecting PDGF-BB as the analyte. Immobilization of bFGF yielded ∼500 RU. Fig.3A shows the response measured at the end of the association phase as a function of increasing PDGF-BB concentration. PDGF-BB bound the bFGF-coated chip in a concentration-dependent manner. Association and dissociation curves from a representative experiment performed with five increasing concentrations of PDGF-BB (12.5–150 nm) are shown in Fig. 3B. All sensorgrams report values obtained after subtraction of the signal on the control flow cell. The association phase lasted from time 0 to time 30 s and was analyzed by nonlinear least squares curve fitting as described under “Experimental Procedures” to yield ks values at each analyte concentration examined (57Herzog A. Szegedi C. Jona I. Herberg F.W. Varsanyi M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 472: 73-77Google Scholar). A plot ofksversus PDGF-BB concentration produced a straight line (Fig. 3C) with a slope equal to the association rate constant (ka). Theka value for PDGF-BB binding to immobilized bFGF was computed as (1.27 ± 0.06) × 106s−1m−1. The dissociation phase was recorded for 2 min after the end injection and was analyzed by nonlinear least squares curve fitting. The dissociation rate constant,kd, was evaluated from traces obtained at ligand saturation (Fig. 3B) as we and others previously reported (57Herzog A. Szegedi C. Jona I. Herberg F.W. Varsanyi M.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1676-1683Google Scholar), constitute one group within a large family of proteins that includes at least four different classes of enzymes having cyclic phosphodiesterase or related activities. Members of this family, or enzymatically competent domains thereof, are of comparable lengths (about 200 residues) and share two similarly spaced tetrapeptide signature motifs (H-Φ-(T/S)-Φ, Φ being a hydrophobic residue) (8Nasr F. Filipowicz W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1676-1683Google Scholar). The first crystal structure for any member of this family was reported recently by us for the CPDase from A. thaliana (9Hofmann A. Zdanov A. Genschik P. Ruvinov S. Filipowicz W. Wlodawer A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6207-6217Google Scholar). The crystal structure showed two almost symmetrical lobes formed by the non-contiguous parts of the peptide chain. Each lobe consists of a three- or four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet, respectively, constituting the inner core of the protein (see Fig. 1A). The arrangement of the β-sheets resembles an open barrel flanked on the outside of each lobe by two antiparallel α-helices. Despite close similarity between both lobes, their multiple connectivity results in only a single globular domain rather than in a two-domain fold. The structural elements within each lobe show similarities to many proteins involved in RNA binding and to kinases; however, their arrangement results in a new protein fold with unique features. A surface loop covering the putative active site showed a high degree of disorder and was thus assumed to be flexible. The active site was found to be located in a water-filled cavity and is composed of the tandem signature motif residues H- Φ -(T/S)- Φ. These residues, as well as Tyr-124, participated in the coordination of a sulfate ion. Based on these findings, an enzymatic mechanism was proposed that employs the nucleophilic attack of a water molecule, which is activated by His-119. Additional residues of the active site motif (Thr-44, Ser-121, Tyr-124) were assigned a stabilizing function by keeping the substrate locally fixed via appropriate coordination. In the last step, the proton from the iminium group of His-42 is transferred to the free 2′-oxygen of the phospho-ribosyl moiety. Because this transfer leaves His-42 in the basic state and His-119 in the acidic state, the system must be restored, most likely via fast proton transfer using two ordered water molecules present in the cavity. CPDase possesses six cysteine residues, four of which form two dithioether linkages as determined by mass spectrometry and by the crystal structure (9Hofmann A. Zdanov A. Genschik P. Ruvinov S. Filipowicz W. Wlodawer A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6207-6217Google Scholar). Cys-64 and Cys-177 are located in helix α2 and the C-terminal β-strand β7, respectively (see Fig. 1C). Both structural elements are directly adjacent and are covalently linked through the formation of a disulfide bridge between these two cysteine residues. The loop region (100) exists in a coil conformation and is exposed to the solvent. The flap-like shape of this loop is maintained by the presence of a second disulfide bridge between Cys-104 and Cys-110. This cystine ties together the upstream and downstream moieties of the loop, thereby stabilizing the overall conformation. The remaining two cysteines, Cys-86 and Cys-159, are found in isolated and shielded positions and thus cannot form disulfide bonds. Therefore, the oxidized state of CPDase contains two disulfides and two free sulfhydryl groups. The assumption that the flexible loop is indeed an important feature of CPDase and the presence of a disulfide bridge within this stretch lead us to investigate the possible effects of reducing environments on the structure and activity of the protein. Although the catalytic activity of the wild-type A. thalianaCPDase was investigated in an earlier study (5Genschik P. Hall J. Filipowicz W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13211-13219Google Scholar), the effect of mutations or redox potentials was not characterized. It is known from a mutation study on Saccharomyces cerevisiae CPDase that the four residues of the tandem signature motif are crucial for the catalytic activity of this protein (8Nasr F. Filipowicz W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1676-1683Google Scholar). Because theArabidopsis and the yeast protein are thought to be homologous, these results have stimulated interpretation of the behavior of the plant enzyme as well. However, the yeast enzyme does not show the same cysteine pattern in its primary structure. In the present study, we provide characterization of the (semi-)reduced state of the A. thaliana CPDase as well as the crystal structure of CPDase in complex with 2′,3′-cyclic uridine vanadate, a putative inhibitor of its enzymatic activity. If used below without specifying its source, the name CPDase refers to theArabidopsis enzyme, whereas enzymes from other sources are explicitly identified. Biophysical characterization of the CPDase fromArabidopsis, including phosphodiesterase activity experiments with the wild-type protein and several mutants, is in progress and will be published elsewhere. CPDase was expressed inEscherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) using a construct in pET11d (5Genschik P. Hall J. Filipowicz W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13211-13219Google Scholar). The recombinant protein features a C-terminal His6 tag and was purified by affinity chromatography using a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin. Typical expression volumes of 8 liters of bacterial culture yielded about 50 mg of protein. The purity after affinity chromatography was 92 to 95%. The protocol for preparation of 2′,3′-cyclic uridine vanadate followed the report of Borah et al. (10Borah B. Chen C.W. Egan W. Miller M. Wlodawer A. Cohen J.S. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2058-2067Google Scholar). 6.11 g (25 mmol) of uridine was dissolved in 1.5 ml of water and mixed with 2.0 g (17 mmol) of NH4VO3 in 1.5 ml of hot water. Formation of the product is accompanied by yellow coloring of the solution. The substrate was used without further purification. Cubic-shaped crystals of semireduced CPDase were grown in acidic ammonium sulfate conditions (1.2–2.0 m(NH4)2SO4, 0.1 m NaOAc, pH 5.0) using the vapor diffusion hanging drop method. The drops consisted of 3 μl of reservoir solution, 1 μl of 1,4-dithio-dl-threitol (DTT; final concentration, 12.5 mm), and 3 μl of protein solution (10 mg/ml in 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). Preparation of ligand-bound crystals was attempted by both soaking and co-crystallization; in the latter case, 1 μl of ligand solution was added to the crystal drop. These ligands were Appr>p (5 mg/ml), 2′,3′-cAMP (10 mg/ml), or U-V (saturated). Growth time of the semireduced crystals was about 8 weeks. Crystals of the inhibitor-bound semireduced protein were very small, appeared after 7 months of growth, and exhibited only limited diffraction power. The crystals were prepared for cryogenic data collection by flash soaking (<1 min) in the cryogenic buffer (15% glycerol, 2.0 m(NH4)2SO4, 0.1 m NaOAc, pH 5.0). Diffraction data were collected on beamline X9B of the National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven, NY, equipped with an ADSC Quantum-4 CCD detector. Data analysis and reduction were performed with HKL2000 (11Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

The self-rotation function for κ = 180°, calculated with GLRF (12Tong L. Rossmann M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1990; 46: 783-792Google Scholar), revealed the presence of crystallographic 2-fold axes at Ψ = 30°, 90°, and 150°. The final space group was thus determined to be R32, with two molecules per asymmetric unit for CNP25 (semireduced CPDase) and with one molecule per asymmetric unit for CNP29 (inhibitor-bound semireduced CPDase). The structures were solved by molecular replacement with the standalone version of the program AMoRe (13Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Google Scholar) using the truncated (Δ90–118) monomer of the oxidized CPDase (9Hofmann A. Zdanov A. Genschik P. Ruvinov S. Filipowicz W. Wlodawer A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6207-6217Google Scholar) as a search model. The solution for CNP25 yielded a correlation coefficient of 0.567 for the first molecule and 0.789 for the second molecule (R-factor, 0.343). With CNP29, the solution had a correlation coefficient of 0.580 (R-factor, 0.350); the next highest peak was 0.253 (R-factor, 0.486). In CNP25, the two monomers found in the asymmetric unit are related by a non-crystallographic symmetry axis almost perpendicular to (001) at the height of 112 of the z axis. The axis deviates by ∼4° from the (110) direction; this is the most likely reason for the absence of any significant peaks in the self-rotation function. The initial model was rebuilt and refined in a number of cycles of visual inspection and manual adjustments with the program O (14Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Google Scholar), interspersed with computational refinement. The latter was carried out using the conjugate gradient method with CNS 1.0 (15Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Core G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Google Scholar), employing the standard crystallographic residual target function. Typical protocols consisted of a positional refinement followed by simulated annealing, grouped and individual B-factor refinement, and the final positional refinement. A bulk solvent model and overall anisotropicB-factor correction were applied throughout the procedure. After including a manually built water model, the structure of semireduced CPDase was refined to an R-factor of 0.192 (Rfree = 0.258). Geometrical properties of the model were analyzed with the program PROCHECK (16Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Google Scholar). The refinement of CNP29 followed a similar procedure to the one described above. However, due to only moderate data quality (rather incomplete and with extensive ice rings), this structure was difficult to refine and required repeated cycling of manual adjustments and computational refinement steps. It has to be noted that the completeness of reflections used for refinement in the working set is only 84%, and the number of reflections in the test set was 650. The final R-factor is 0.213, and we consider the highRfree of 0.398 to be reflective of the missing reflections due to incomplete data and to a model that was not able to describe all features present in the electron density maps. Additionally, there seems to be a high degree of flexibility within this structure, leading to more frequent disordered residues. This observation is in agreement with the rather high averageB-factor for the data and the model. The model of the U-V ligand was built with Insight II (17Molecular Simulations, Inc., Insight II, version 2000, San Diego, CAGoogle Scholar), and its geometry was optimized with the PM3 Hamiltonian function (18Stewart J.J.P. J. Comput Aided Mol. Des. 1990; 4: 1-105Google Scholar) of MOPAC (17Molecular Simulations, Inc., Insight II, version 2000, San Diego, CAGoogle Scholar). Parametrization for refinement was carried out with XPLO2D (19Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 208-230Google Scholar). Table Isummarizes the refinement statistics for both structures (more details are available as supplementary material). Ribbon drawings and graphical representations of electron densities and protein models presented in this work were generated by MOLSCRIPT (20Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Google Scholar) or BOBSCRIPT (21Esnouf R.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Bacon D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 505-524Google Scholar). The folding stability of the protein in the presence and absence of reducing conditions was investigated by urea-induced equilibrium denaturation. The unfolding process was monitored by intrinsic fluorescence. Samples consisted of about 2 μm protein in 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0). The reducing conditions were achieved through the presence of 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Urea was present in 17 separate samples with concentrations ranging from 0 to 8m. The samples were prepared 30 min prior to the measurements to allow for equilibration. Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded on a Perkin Elmer LS 50B luminescence spectrometer using two excitation wavelengths, λexc = 280 nm and λexc = 295 nm, respectively. All fluorescence spectra were corrected against buffer-only samples and analyzed offline with the program AFDP (24Hofmann A. Wlodawer A. Bioinformatics. 2002; (in press)Google Scholar). Three independent denaturing series were carried out for each condition. Each excitation set was analyzed by calculating an i-curea relation in which i =I(λunfolded)/I(λfolded) (emission intensity analysis) and a λ-curea relation (wavelength analysis). Because two-state unfolding reactions were observed, it was possible to calculate stability energies as described by Pace (25Pace C.N. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 259: 538-554Google Scholar); for this purpose, data from the emission intensity analysis were used. Circular dichroic spectra were recorded with an AVIV 202 spectrometer. The final protein concentrations in the samples were about 2 μm. For each sample, three separate CD spectra were collected and averaged and corrected offline with the program ACDP (24Hofmann A. Wlodawer A. Bioinformatics. 2002; (in press)Google Scholar). Correction for each spectrum was against the respective buffer-only spectrum. Following our first report on the structure of the cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase from A. thaliana, we have now solved the structure of the semireduced and inhibitor-bound forms of this enzyme. CPDase possesses six cysteine residues, four of which are engaged in disulfide bridges in the oxidized species. Attempts to reduce the dithioether bonds lead to crystallization conditions very similar to those for the oxidized species but with DTT present at concentrations higher than 10 mm. The crystals obtained from these conditions have a much denser packing arrangement than the ones obtained with the oxidized CPDase species. At the same time, the space group changes from P6122 (oxidized form) to R32 (semireduced form) in a polymorphic transition. This is a very conservative transition because the rhombohedral system is a subgroup of the hexagonal crystal system. Accordingly, the non-crystallographic symmetry trimer observed with the hexagonal structure has now become a crystallographic trimer centered on the 3-fold axis. In the oxidized CPDase structure, one of the disulfide bridges (Cys-104–Cys-110) is located in an exposed surface loop with the bridge separating the two lobes of this loop (100). The dithioether bond in the loop region is absent in the new structure, and the former loop conformation is reorganized to elongate helix α3 by two turns (see Fig.1B), which moves residues 102–115 much closer toward the protein core. This reorganization also forces Cys-104 and Cys-110 into completely different environments, preventing any contact with each other (Figs. 1D and2). The second disulfide bridge (Cys-64–Cys-177) connects helix α2 with the terminal strand β7. Despite the high concentration of DTT in the crystallization drop, this cystine is found to be unchanged compared with the oxidized CPDase structure. Because one of two disulfide bridges is still present in the current crystal structure, we name this structure type semireduced. Superposition of the oxidized CPDase (molecule 1) and the semireduced species (molecule 1) shows only minor deviations in the protein core, mainly around the stretch of residues 161–171. The refolding of the loop segment into a helical structure does not affect the overall conformation of the core, as reflected by a root mean square deviation of 0.63 Å between the oxidized and the semireduced structure. For comparison, the two non-crystallographic symmetry-related molecules of the semireduced structure show almost the same root mean square deviation, namely 0.67 Å (TableII).Table IIGlobal geometrical analysisCNP25Semi-reduced CPDase (Molecules 1 and 2)Semi-reduced (CNP25)/oxidized CPDase2-b1 fsi.pdb, residues 90–115 were excluded from the calculations. r.m.s.2-ar.m.s., root mean square; calculated with Align (24). distance (Cα) in Å0.670.63 r.m.s.2-ar.m.s., root mean square; calculated with Align (24).ΔB in Å29.8918.6CNP29Semi-reduced CPDase (CNP25/CNP292-cResidues 90–114 were excluded from the calculations.)Semi-reduced (CNP29)/oxidized CPDase2-b1 fsi.pdb, residues 90–115 were excluded from the calculations. r.m.s.2-ar.m.s., root mean square; calculated with Align (24). distance (Cα) in Å0.640.85 r.m.s.2-ar.m.s., root mean square; calculated with Align (24).ΔB in Å231.715.32-a r.m.s., root mean square; calculated with Align (24Hofmann A.

Open table in a new tab The two data sets obtained from the semireduced CPDase co-crystallized with U-V are of moderate quality and not entirely complete. However, the length of time necessary for crystal growth and the paucity of available crystals prevented us from improving data quality. Flexibility and disorder in this structure added further to the difficulties in refinement and model building. Nevertheless, the density clearly shows conserved conformation for the core residues and of the active site cleft. The structure in helix α3 and the loop region is similar to that observed with the semireduced CPDase without a ligand, although the local conformations seem to be different. The density in this region indicates considerable disorder, and residues Asn-106 and Phe-108 were modeled as alanines because of insufficient information about their side chain positions. Extra density for U-V was clearly visible within the active site, even at the early stages of refinement. The vanadium atom assumes the position of the sulfate sulfur atom observed in the oxidized species, whereas residues His-42, Thr-44, His-119, Ser-121, and Tyr-124 coordinate all vanadate oxygen atoms (see Fig. 3). The 5′-hydroxyl group of the ligand interacts with Trp-12 and Ser-10, and the imide nitrogen of the uracilyl group is hydrogen-bonded to the backbone carbonyl of Thr-163. Further stabilization of the nucleotide base is provided by hydrophobic contacts with Phe-84 and Trp-171. The density observed for the nucleotide base allows for two other conformations, indicating a possible rotation around the C1-N bond, which connects the base to the ribosyl body. However, these two alternate conformations were not modeled in this structure. The structure reported here also features a secondary binding site for U-V, which is found on the surface of the protein. The ligand is coordinated there by Arg-31, the backbone carbonyl of residue 36, and the backbone amide of residue 38, and it occupies a position on the crystallographic 3-fold axis. The density of this site is not very well defined for the nucleotide base but is apparent for the rest of the ligand. With respect to data quality, we expressly note that the information obtained from this structure is limited to the binding mode of the nucleotide. The conclusions drawn from the observed ligand-protein interactions are valid because the density within the active site region and the surrounding protein core is unambiguous. Because the structures of both the fully oxidized and a semireduced species of CNPase are now available, it is necessary to analyze the respective stabilities of these two distinct forms of the protein. Although the existence of a semireduced state of CPDase in the presence of 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol is not proven experimentally, the assumption of its presence is reasonable. For both species, we find similar stability parameters (TableIII) and also comparable intrinsic fluorescence behavior (data not shown). With the semireduced species, the wavelength analysis of the unfolding series shows some anomaly in the low concentration range. At 280 nm excitation, it appears as if a first transition takes place at c½ = 0.9 m, whereas the main transition is still observed at c½ = 3.9m. Data collected at 295 nm excitation are unstable in the low concentration range but do not allow for a conclusion of an extra transition. Intensity analysis, by contrast, shows a clear two-state unfolding reaction without any anomalies. We therefore conclude that some side reactions might occur with fluorophore groups affecting the emission wavelength. However, the unfolding behavior of CPDase displays clear two-state characteristics in both the oxidized and semireduced redox state.Table IIIFolding stability of CPDase (A. thaliana)Pace analysis3-aFor Pace analysis (25), emission intensity data were used as described in materials and methods.λ analysis3-bc½ determined from the observed wavelength shift.ΔG (H2O)mc½ (urea)c½ (urea)kJ/molkJ∗liter/mol2mmOxidized CPDase3-cAveraged from 280 and 295 nm excitation, respectively.13.13.533.84.2Semi-reduced CPDase3-cAveraged from 280 and 295 nm excitation, respectively.3-dBuffer contained 1 mmβ-mercaptoethanol.12.43.313.83.93-a For Pace analysis (25Pace C.N.

Open table in a new tab Using the molar ellipticity at 222 and 208 nm, CPDase does not show significant differences in the presence or absence of either Appr>p or DTT. Calculation of secondary structure contents with the program CDNN (26Böhm G. CDNN: CD Spectra Deconvolution, Version 2.1.. Universität Halle, Halle, Germany1997Google Scholar) shows no differences when compared with the native CD spectrum (data not shown). The overall increase of α-helical content by elongation of helix α3 is ∼4%, which is presumably too small to be detected by CD. Following our initial work on the structure of the native oxidized form of CPDase from A. thaliana, we undertook extensive efforts to obtain ligand-bound CPDase structures. However, soaking or co-crystallization with Appr>p, 2′,3′-cAMP, and U-V proved unsuccessful (data not shown). The hypothesis evolved that this failure might be due to our inability to grow crystals under conditions other than acidic or of changing pH of the mother liquor without dissolving crystals. Cross-linking of crystals obtained under acidic conditions and rebuffering at higher pH values led to severe crystal damage and/or loss of diffraction (data not shown). At the same time, we set up experiments targeting reduction of the two disulfide bridges found in the oxidized CPDase structure. After obtaining a new crystal form in the presence of DTT, which also promised higher crysta"

J. 1995; 306: 313-325Google Scholar). This methyltransferase is found in a wide array of organisms including eubacteria (10Ichikawa J.K. Clarke S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 358: 222-231Google Scholar), plants (11Mudgett M.B. Lowenson J.D. Clarke S. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 1481-1489Google Scholar, 12Kumar G.N.M. Houtz R.L. Knowles N.R. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 89-99Google Scholar), nematodes (13Kagan R.M. Clarke S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10794-10806Google Scholar), insects (14O'Connor M.B. Galus A. Hartenstine M. Magee M. Jackson F.R. O'Connor C.M. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 27: 49-54Google Scholar), and mammals (15O'Connor C.M. Aswad D.W. Clarke S. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7757-7761Google Scholar). Its amino acid sequence is highly conserved (16Kagan R.M. McFadden H.J. McFadden P.N. O'Connor C.M. Clarke S. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1997; 117B: 379-385Google Scholar). Its functional importance to the bacterium Escherichia coli, the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, and mice has been assessed by analyzing the effect of knockout mutations of its structural genes. In E. coli, methyltransferase-deficient cells are more sensitive to stress in the stationary phase (17Visick J.E. Cai H. Clarke S. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2623-2629Google Scholar), whereas knockout worms show poorer survival in the dauer phase (18Kagan R.M. Niewmierzycka A. Clarke S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 348: 320-328Google Scholar). Methyltransferase-deficient mice suffer fatal seizures at an early age (19Kim E. Lowenson J.D. Clarke S. Young S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20671-20678Google Scholar, 20Shimizu T. Watanabe A. Ogawara M. Mori H. Shirasawa T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 381: 225-234Google Scholar, 21Lowenson J.D. Kim E. Young S.G. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20695-20702Google Scholar). Interestingly, the effect of methyltransferase loss on the accumulation of damaged substrates in these knockout organisms is quite variable, from small effects seen in worms (22Niewmierzycka A. Clarke S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 364: 209-218Google Scholar) and bacteria (23Visick J.E. Ichikawa J.K. Clarke S. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 167: 19-25Google Scholar) to relatively large effects in mice (21Lowenson J.D. Kim E. Young S.G. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20695-20702Google Scholar). Although all of the l-isoaspartyl methyltransferases characterized so far recognize l-isoaspartyl residues in synthetic peptide substrates, their relative affinity for these methyl-acceptors is also quite variable. For example, the human enzyme recognizes substrates with 40–1000 times the affinity of the E. coli, nematode, and plant enzymes (24Thapar N. Clarke S. Protein Express. Purif. 2000; 20: 237-251Google Scholar). The functional significance of these differences is not clear, although mathematical simulations of the repair reaction clearly show that repair efficiency is directly related to the affinity of the enzyme for the methyl-acceptor (25Lowenson J.D. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19396-19406Google Scholar). It is possible that the complexity of human protein interactions necessitates a more efficient repair to minimize the presence of proteins containing abnormal residues (21Lowenson J.D. Kim E. Young S.G. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20695-20702Google Scholar, 22Niewmierzycka A. Clarke S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 364: 209-218Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, this methyltransferase can also catalyze the AdoMet-dependent methylation of substrates containingd-aspartyl residues arising from spontaneous protein racemization reactions (15O'Connor C.M. Aswad D.W. Clarke S. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7757-7761Google Scholar, 26McFadden P.N. Clarke S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 2460-2464Google Scholar, 27Lowenson J.D. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5985-5995Google Scholar). The Km for corresponding synthetic peptides containing d-aspartyl residues in place of l-isoaspartyl residues can be 700–10,000-fold higher, however. Additionally, no methylation ofd-aspartyl peptides has been detected for theE. coli (28Fu J.C. Ding L. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14562-14572Google Scholar), worm (13Kagan R.M. Clarke S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10794-10806Google Scholar), and higher plant (24Thapar N. Clarke S. Protein Express. Purif. 2000; 20: 237-251Google Scholar) enzymes. In mammalian cells, it is possible that the methylation ofd-aspartyl residues can lead to eventuall-aspartyl formation in a repair reaction similar to that observed for l-isoaspartyl residues, although considerable amounts of d-isoaspartyl residues would also be expected to accumulate (27Lowenson J.D. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5985-5995Google Scholar). We have been interested in comparing the properties of protein repair methyltransferases from a variety of organisms that face distinct environmental challenges. We have been particularly interested in the enzymes that exist in thermophilic organisms where the rate of spontaneous isomerization and racemization would be expected to be greatly enhanced. Characterization of the enzyme from the eubacteriumThermotoga maritima demonstrated superior recognition of methyl-accepting substrates compared with the E. coli, plant, and worm enzymes, but the recognition is still 5–14-fold poorer than that of the human enzyme (10Ichikawa J.K. Clarke S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 358: 222-231Google Scholar, 24Thapar N. Clarke S. Protein Express. Purif. 2000; 20: 237-251Google Scholar). Additionally, theT. maritima enzyme has not been observed to methylated-aspartyl-containing peptides recognized by the human enzyme (10Ichikawa J.K. Clarke S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 358: 222-231Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of the T. maritima methyltransferase complexed with the product AdoHcy has been determined (29Skinner M.M. Puvathingal J.M. Walter R.L. Friedman A.M. Structure. 2000; 8: 1189-1201Google Scholar), but unfortunately does not shed light on the problem of the differential recognition of substrates by these enzymes. We have recently been able to determine the structure of anl-isoaspartyl methyltransferase from a second thermophile, the hyperthermophilic archaebacterium Pyrococcus furiosus in complexes with a number of cofactors and an l-isoaspartyl peptide (30Griffith S.C. Sawaya M.R. Boutz D.R. Thapar N. Katz J.E. Clarke S. Yeates T.O. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 1103-1116Google Scholar). P. furiosus was originally isolated from shallow geothermal marine sediments in Italy (31Fiala G. Stetter K.O. Arch. Microbiol. 1986; 145: 56-61Google Scholar) and grows at temperatures ranging from 70 to 103 °C (32Blumentals I.I. Brown S.H. Schicho R.N. Skaja A.K. Costantino H.R. Kelly R.M. Annal. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1990; 589: 301-314Google Scholar). In our biochemical characterization of the purified recombinant enzyme, we were surprised to find that the affinity of this enzyme forl-isoaspartyl-containing methyl-accepting substrates is as good or even better than the human enzyme, suggesting that it may have evolved for efficient repair under conditions where protein degradation may be exceptionally rapid. Significantly, we found that this enzyme is even better than the human enzyme in its ability to catalyzed-aspartyl methylation. By analyzing the common structural features of d- and l-isoaspartyl peptides, we propose that a minimal recognition element would be anN-succinyl peptide, and we now present data that this is indeed the case. P. furiosusrecombinant l-isoaspartyl methyltransferase was prepared inE. coli cells as described (30Griffith S.C. Sawaya M.R. Boutz D.R. Thapar N. Katz J.E. Clarke S. Yeates T.O. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 1103-1116Google Scholar). Using PCR primers based on the PF1922 gene sequence (complement of nucleotides 1,772,562–1,773,380, Utah Genome Center,www.genome.utah.edu/Pfu102000.gb), we amplified genomic DNA to produce a construct encoding an additional six histidine resides at the C terminus. This DNA was incorporated into the plasmid pTrcHis2-TOPO and used to transform E. coli TOP10 cells. Protein expression was induced with isopropyl thio-β-d-galactoside treatment, and the enzyme was purified by chromatography on a nickel-containing HiTrap column of a heat-treated soluble cellular extract as described (30Griffith S.C. Sawaya M.R. Boutz D.R. Thapar N. Katz J.E. Clarke S. Yeates T.O. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 1103-1116Google Scholar). The purified protein consists of a single polypeptide of 24 kDa on SDS gels. From densitometric analyses of overloaded samples on these gels, we estimate the polypeptide purity to be at least 98%. Automated Edman analysis gave a single N-terminal sequence of MHLYS (30Griffith S.C. Sawaya M.R. Boutz D.R. Thapar N. Katz J.E. Clarke S. Yeates T.O. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 1103-1116Google Scholar). The enzyme has a specific activity at pH 7.5 of about 12 nmol methyl groups transferred/min/mg protein at 68 °C and 27 nmol/min/mg protein at 85 °C using VYP-l-isoAsp-HA as methyl-acceptor as assayed below. The human recombinant type IIl-isoaspartyl methyltransferase was prepared according to MacLaren and Clarke (33MacLaren D.C. Clarke S. Protein Express. Purif. 1995; 6: 99-108Google Scholar). The peptides VYP-l-isoAsp-HA and KASA-l-isoAsp-LAKY were synthesized and HPLC-purified by California Peptide Research Inc. (Napa, CA). KASA-d-Asp-LAKY was synthesized and purified as described previously (27Lowenson J.D. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5985-5995Google Scholar). Chromatographic analysis showed no contamination of this peptide with the l-isaspartyl form. This result is supported by the expected poor recognition of this peptide by the human enzyme (27Lowenson J.D. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5985-5995Google Scholar). Ovalbumin (chicken egg, Grade VII) was from Sigma. N-Succinyl p-nitroanilide peptides, succinyl derivatives, succinic acid, succinamic acid, succinamide, alanine, and alanine peptides were from Sigma. AdoHcy, 5-deoxy-5′methylthioadenosine (MTA), and adenosine were from Sigma.N-Succinyl-p-nitroanilide peptides were dissolved in 50 mm NaOH to give 10 mm solutions. Peptide succinylation was performed using a modification of the protocol of Pearson and Kemp (34Pearson R.B. Kemp B.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 870: 312-319Google Scholar). 5 mg each of mono-, di-, tetra-, and penta-alanine and 18 mg of tri-alanine were suspended in 1 ml of 0.2m sodium borate, pH 9. The concentration of each solution was 56, 31, 78, 16, and 13 mm respectively. To these solutions, a total of 180 μl of a 15 mg/ml solution of succinic anhydride in dimethyl formamide was added in small aliquots. The contents were constantly stirred at room temperature, and the pH was maintained at 9 with 1 m NaOH for a total incubation time of 90 min. A vapor diffusion assay was used to determine the methyltransferase activity (35Gilbert J.M. Fowler A. Bleibaum J. Clarke S. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5227-5233Google Scholar). The method involves the transfer of radiolabeled methyl groups by the enzyme fromS–adenosyl-[methyl-14C]-l-methionine ([14C]AdoMet) (57 mCi/mmol; Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) to a suitable methyl-accepting substrate. Subsequently, the methyl esters are hydrolyzed, and the resulting [14C]methanol is quantified. Typically, the reaction mixture (total of 40 μl) contains 10 μm of [14C]AdoMet, either a buffer of 0.33 m sodium HEPES at pH 7.5 or 0.2 m sodium citrate/phosphate at pH 4, and enzyme (0.06–0.12 μg of purified protein). In each set of assays, the activity was measured in the presence and absence of methyl-acceptor. The reaction was allowed to proceed typically at 68 °C for 1 h and was stopped by quenching with 40 μl of 0.2 n NaOH, 1% (w/v) SDS. In preliminary experiments, we demonstrated that the rate of product formation was linear with time under these conditions. The contents of the reaction mixture were vortexed, and 60 μl of this mixture was then spotted onto a 1.5 × 8-cm pleated filter paper (Bio-Rad, number 1650962), which was placed in the neck of a 20-ml scintillation vial containing 5 ml of counting fluor (Safety Solve High Flashpoint mixture; Research Products International). The vials were capped and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. During this period the resulting [14C]methanol diffuses into the fluor, and the unreacted [14C]AdoMet stays on the filter paper. Quantification was done by removal of the paper and counting the vials in a scintillation counter (Beckman LS 100C). Unless otherwise indicated, the specific activity was calculated by subtracting the “endogenous activity” measured in the absence of methyl-acceptor from the activity in the presence of the methyl-acceptor. This “endogenous” activity (which includes contributions from the isotope itself as well as from the presence of endogenous methyl-acceptors) was generally 2–3% of the activity with l-isoaspartyl peptide at pH 4 and 15–20% of this activity at pH 7.5. In experiments where methyl-accepting substrate concentrations were varied, AdoMet was maintained at a fixed concentration of 10 μm. When AdoMet levels were varied, the peptide VYP-l-isoAsp-HA was used as a methyl-acceptor at a fixed concentration of 500 μm. The analyses of the human enzyme withN-succinyl-AAVA-p-nitroanilide were performed at 37 °C at pH 7.5 using 0.016 μg of purified human recombinantl-isoaspartyl methyltransferase type II (33MacLaren D.C. Clarke S. Protein Express. Purif. 1995; 6: 99-108Google Scholar) at a specific activity of 147 nmol/min/mg protein at 37 °C using VYP-l-isoAsp-HA as a methyl-acceptor. In all cases, product formation was linear with time. Mass spectrometry was performed by Dr. Kym Faull at the Pasarow UCLA Mass Spectrometry Facility. HPLC fractions from the C18 reverse-phase column were collected and dried in a Speed-Vac. The dried HPLC samples were redissolved in 20 μl of water/acetonitrile/triethylamine (50:50:0.1, v/v/v), and aliquots were injected into an electrospray ionization source attached to a quadrupole mass spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer, Thornhill, Canada; Sciex API III; −3.5 Kv ion spray voltage, spray nebulization with hydrocarbon-depleted air (“zero” grade air, 40 p.s.i., 0.6 liters/min; Zero Air Generator, Peak Scientific, Chicago, IL), curtain gas (0.6 liters/min) from the vapors of liquid nitrogen, with the mass resolution set so the isotopes of the polypropylene glycol/NH4+ singly charged ion atm/z 906 were resolved with a 40% valley) scanning from m/z 300–2200 in the negative ion mode. The spectra were collected (step size, 0.3 Da; dwell time, 1 ms/step and 6.7 s/scan; orifice at −85 V), and the resulting spectra were summed and then corrected for the background with software supplied with the instrument. The activity of the purified P. furiosusl-isoaspartyl methyltransferase was initially studied for its temperature and pH dependence. Nonthermophilic l-isoaspartyl methyltransferases display maximal activity in the range of 45–55 °C (36Thapar N. Kim A.-K. Clarke S. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 1023-1035Google Scholar), whereas the enzyme from the thermophilic eubacteriumT. maritima was found to have an optimal temperature of 85 °C (10Ichikawa J.K. Clarke S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 358: 222-231Google Scholar). We first assayed the activity of the P. furiosus enzyme at temperatures ranging from 4 to 95 °C at pH 7.5. We found significant activity over the entire range, increasing to a maximal activity at 85 °C, with activity at 95 °C comparable with that at 55 °C (Fig. 1). To measure the thermal stability of the enzyme, the purified enzyme was preincubated at various temperatures for 1 h at pH 7.5 and then assayed at 68 °C at pH 7.5. As shown in Fig.2, little or no loss of activity was observed up to preincubation temperatures of 85 °C, although there was an approximate 7-fold loss of activity after preincubation at 95 °C.Figure 2Thermal stability of the P. furiosus recombinant l-isoaspartyl methyltransferase. The purified enzyme was preincubated at the indicated temperatures (4 °C-95 °C) for 60 min at either pH 4 or pH 7.5 and was then assayed for activity at 68 °C for 30 min using 25 μm of methyl-accepting peptide (VYP-l-isoAsp-HA) and 0.12 μg of enzyme at the same pH value as described in Fig. 1. All reactions were done in duplicate, and the values represent the means ± range. When noerror bar is shown, the error was smaller than thesymbol.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The enzyme was next analyzed for activity at pH values ranging from 3 to 10. Because the organism has been found to grow optimally at pH values ranging from 5 to 9 (32Blumentals I.I. Brown S.H. Schicho R.N. Skaja A.K. Costantino H.R. Kelly R.M. Annal. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1990; 589: 301-314Google Scholar), we expected the enzyme to be most active in the neutral pH range. However, we found maximal activity at pH 4, dropping off to a plateau value ∼4-fold lower from pH 7 to 10. The activity at pH 3 was about 25-fold lower than at pH 4 (Fig.3). An optimal pH forl-isoaspartyl activity as low as 4 has not been previously observed for these enzymes from other organisms; maximal activity is typically found in pH values over the range of 6–8 (33MacLaren D.C. Clarke S. Protein Express. Purif. 1995; 6: 99-108Google Scholar, 36Thapar N. Kim A.-K. Clarke S. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 1023-1035Google Scholar). The data shown in Fig. 3 suggest that a crucial amino acid in the P. furiosus enzyme with a pKa of about 5 must be protonated for full activity. We then reexamined the optimal temperature for activity and stability at pH 4. As shown in Fig. 1, the optimal temperature for the activity at pH 4 is 75 °C, about 10 °C lower than the optimal value at pH 7.5. Up to 75 °C, activity levels at pH 4 were 2–3-fold higher than those at pH 7.5. However at 85 °C, the activity at pH 4 was about 2.5-fold lower than at pH 7.5. The thermal stability of the enzyme at pH 4 was found to be similar to that observed at pH 7.5 up to 75 °C but decreased 4-fold by 85 °C, conditions where the enzyme was still stable at pH 7.5 (Fig. 2). Enzyme prepared for structural studies was previously found to retain tightly bound cofactors including AdoMet, AdoHcy, and surprisingly, adenosine during the course of purification and crystallization (30Griffith S.C. Sawaya M.R. Boutz D.R. Thapar N. Katz J.E. Clarke S. Yeates T.O. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 1103-1116Google Scholar). AdoHcy is known to be a potent inhibitor of most methyltransferases, including the l-isoaspartyl methyltransferase from several organisms (37Johnson B.A. Aswad D.W. Neurochem. Res. 1993; 18: 87-94Google Scholar), whereas adenosine has not been previously reported as an inhibitor of methyltransferases. We thus examined the effect of these compounds, as well as that of another known inhibitor of this enzyme, MTA, a by-product of polyamine synthesis (38Galletti P. Oliva A. Manna C. Della Ragione F. Carteni-Farina M. FEBS Lett. 1981; 126: 236-240Google Scholar). In Fig. 4, we show that AdoHcy is a potent inhibitor both at pH 4 and at pH 7.5, with half-maximal inhibition in the 10 μm range. Poorer inhibition is seen with 5′-deoxy-5′-methylthioadenosine, with half-maximal inhibition at about 250 μm at both pH values. Interestingly, we did detect inhibition with adenosine, with half-maximal inhibition at about 100 μm at pH 7.5 and 1 mm at pH 4. We measured the methyl-accepting activity at pH 7.5 and 68 °C of the recombinantP. furiosus enzyme for a number of peptide and protein substrates previously characterized for other l-isoaspartyl methyltransferases (Table I). We found that the P. furiosus enzyme recognizes these substrates with affinities much higher than those of other prokaryotic organisms and in fact even higher in some cases than those of the human enzyme, previously determined to be the most effective catalyst of these reactions (24Thapar N. Clarke S. Protein Express. Purif. 2000; 20: 237-251Google Scholar). The Km values for thel-isoaspartate peptides were comparable for the P. furiosus and human enzymes, whereas the P. furiosusenzyme recognized the protein ovalbumin with about 8-fold higher affinity than the human enzyme (Table I). Remarkably, the greatest difference seen between the P. furiosus and the human enzyme was with respect to the methylation of ad-aspartyl-containing peptide. Here, the affinity of theP. furiosus enzyme was found to be about 120-fold higher (Km = 23 μm) than that for the human enzyme (Km = 2700 μm), whereas the maximal velocity values were similar (Table I). We also measured the affinity for the methyl donor AdoMet and found that its value was similar to that of the enzymes from other sources (Table I). These results suggest that the P. furiosus enzyme has evolved to be capable of recognizing both l-isoaspartate andd-aspartate residues with high affinity. A combination of direct structural analysis and molecular modeling has demonstrated that peptides containing either l-isoaspartyl ord-aspartyl residues form multiple binding contacts with theP. furiosus methyltransferase (30Griffith S.C.

Although we found that the maximal activity of the enzyme was at pH 4, at this pH value the affinity for AdoMet and its methyl-accepting substrates was found to be decreased by 3–80-fold (Table I). We also examined the effect of lowering the temperature to 37 °C at pH 7.5. TheKm values measured at pH 7.5 for 37 °C were comparable with those measured at 68 °C at the same pH value for the isoaspartyl peptides but were about 7-fold higher for ovalbumin and 4-fold lower for AdoMet. These results suggest that pH has a greater effect on the substrate affinity than does the temperature for theP. furiosus methyltransferase. A different effect of temperature on substrate affinity has been seen with the enzyme from the eubacterial thermophile T. maritima (10Ich"
