https://openalex.org/W1969929163,"The use of solar energy to produce molecular hydrogen and oxygen (H2 and O2) from overall water splitting is a promising means of renewable energy storage. In the past 40 years, various inorganic and organic systems have been developed as photocatalysts for water splitting driven by visible light. These photocatalysts, however, still suffer from low quantum efficiency and/or poor stability. We report the design and fabrication of a metal-free carbon nanodot-carbon nitride (C3N4) nanocomposite and demonstrate its impressive performance for photocatalytic solar water splitting. We measured quantum efficiencies of 16% for wavelength λ = 420 ± 20 nanometers, 6.29% for λ = 580 ± 15 nanometers, and 4.42% for λ = 600 ± 10 nanometers, and determined an overall solar energy conversion efficiency of 2.0%. The catalyst comprises low-cost, Earth-abundant, environmentally friendly materials and shows excellent stability."

We performed whole-genome sequencing and copy number variation (CNV) analysis of 100 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs). Chromosomal rearrangements leading to gene disruption were prevalent, affecting genes known to be important in pancreatic cancer (TP53, SMAD4, CDKN2A, ARID1A and ROBO2) and new candidate drivers of pancreatic carcinogenesis (KDM6A and PREX2). Patterns of structural variation (variation in chromosomal structure) classified PDACs into 4 subtypes with potential clinical utility: the subtypes were termed stable, locally rearranged, scattered and unstable. A significant proportion harboured focal amplifications, many of which contained druggable oncogenes (ERBB2, MET, FGFR1, CDK6, PIK3R3 and PIK3CA), but at low individual patient prevalence. Genomic instability co-segregated with inactivation of DNA maintenance genes (BRCA1, BRCA2 or PALB2) and a mutational signature of DNA damage repair deficiency. Of 8 patients who received platinum therapy, 4 of 5 individuals with these measures of defective DNA maintenance responded. A whole-genome sequencing analysis of 100 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas has discovered known and newly identified genetic drivers of pancreatic cancer; these genetic alterations can be classified into four subtypes, which raises the possibility of improved targeting of clinical treatments.

https://openalex.org/W1981629946,"The binding motifs for many RNA-binding proteins are normally buried within structured regions; now, the N6-methyladenosine modification is shown to act as a switch to remodel these regions, expose the motif, and thereby facilitate binding of RNA-binding proteins. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is a common internal modification found in many eukaryotic mRNAs and long non-coding RNAs. It is involved in the control of various cellular functions including circadian rhythm, meiosis and stem cell development. This study uncovers a previously unknown mechanism by which m6A regulates RNA–protein interactions. Tao Pan and colleagues show that the binding motifs for many RNA binding proteins (RBPs) are normally buried within structured regions. The m6A modification acts as a switch to reorganize these regions, inducing structural changes that expose the motif and thereby facilitate RBP binding. This finding implies that m6A functions as an RNA structure remodeller, for example, to affect mRNA maturation through interference with post-transcriptional regulator binding activities. RNA-binding proteins control many aspects of cellular biology through binding single-stranded RNA binding motifs (RBMs)1,2,3. However, RBMs can be buried within their local RNA structures4,5,6,7, thus inhibiting RNA–protein interactions. N6-methyladenosine (m6A), the most abundant and dynamic internal modification in eukaryotic messenger RNA8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19, can be selectively recognized by the YTHDF2 protein to affect the stability of cytoplasmic mRNAs15, but how m6A achieves its wide-ranging physiological role needs further exploration. Here we show in human cells that m6A controls the RNA-structure-dependent accessibility of RBMs to affect RNA–protein interactions for biological regulation; we term this mechanism ‘the m6A-switch’. We found that m6A alters the local structure in mRNA and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) to facilitate binding of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C (HNRNPC), an abundant nuclear RNA-binding protein responsible for pre-mRNA processing20,21,22,23,24. Combining photoactivatable-ribonucleoside-enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP) and anti-m6A immunoprecipitation (MeRIP) approaches enabled us to identify 39,060 m6A-switches among HNRNPC-binding sites; and global m6A reduction decreased HNRNPC binding at 2,798 high-confidence m6A-switches. We determined that these m6A-switch-regulated HNRNPC-binding activities affect the abundance as well as alternative splicing of target mRNAs, demonstrating the regulatory role of m6A-switches on gene expression and RNA maturation. Our results illustrate how RNA-binding proteins gain regulated access to their RBMs through m6A-dependent RNA structural remodelling, and provide a new direction for investigating RNA-modification-coded cellular biology."
https://openalex.org/W2070658923,"The view of the lysosome as the terminal end of cellular catabolic pathways has been challenged by recent studies showing a central role of this organelle in the control of cell function. Here we show that a lysosomal Ca2+ signalling mechanism controls the activities of the phosphatase calcineurin and of its substrate TFEB, a master transcriptional regulator of lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy. Lysosomal Ca2+ release through mucolipin 1 (MCOLN1) activates calcineurin, which binds and dephosphorylates TFEB, thus promoting its nuclear translocation. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of calcineurin suppressed TFEB activity during starvation and physical exercise, while calcineurin overexpression and constitutive activation had the opposite effect. Induction of autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis through TFEB required MCOLN1-mediated calcineurin activation. These data link lysosomal calcium signalling to both calcineurin regulation and autophagy induction and identify the lysosome as a hub for the signalling pathways that regulate cellular homeostasis. Medina, Ballabio and colleagues report that calcium release from the lysosome stimulates calcineurin, which dephosphorylates and activates TFEB. These findings reveal a central role for calcium signalling in autophagy and lysosome homeostasis."

Soft materials capable of programmable shape change require localized control of the magnitude and directionality of a mechanical response. We report the preparation of soft, ordered materials referred to as liquid crystal elastomers. The direction of molecular order, known as the director, is written within local volume elements (voxels) as small as 0.0005 cubic millimeters. Locally, the director controls the inherent mechanical response (55% strain) within the material. In monoliths with spatially patterned director, thermal or chemical stimuli transform flat sheets into three-dimensional objects through controlled bending and stretching. The programmable mechanical response of these materials could yield monolithic multifunctional devices or serve as reconfigurable substrates for flexible devices in aerospace, medicine, or consumer goods."
https://openalex.org/W1965713361,"So far, roughly 40 quasars with redshifts greater than z=6 have been discovered. Each quasar contains a black hole with a mass of about one billion solar masses ($10^9 M_\odot$). The existence of such black holes when the Universe was less than 1 billion years old presents substantial challenges to theories of the formation and growth of black holes and the coevolution of black holes and galaxies. Here we report the discovery of an ultra-luminous quasar, SDSS J010013.02+280225.8, at redshift z=6.30. It has an optical and near-infrared luminosity a few times greater than those of previously known z>6 quasars. On the basis of the deep absorption trough on the blue side of the Ly $\alpha$ emission line in the spectrum, we estimate the proper size of the ionized proximity zone associated with the quasar to be 26 million light years, larger than found with other z>6.1 quasars with lower luminosities. We estimate (on the basis of a near-infrared spectrum) that the black hole has a mass of $\sim 1.2 \times 10^{10} M_\odot$, which is consistent with the $1.3 \times 10^{10} M_\odot$ derived by assuming an Eddington-limited accretion rate."

Maintaining precise spatial patterns of Hox gene expression is vital during metazoan development. The transcriptional repressor CTCF is involved in the regulation of chromatin architecture. Narendra et al. show that a CTCF protein binding site insulates regions of active and repressed Hox gene expression from each other. This protects heterochromatin containing repressed Hox genes from the encroaching spread of active chromatin. The CTCF protein appears to organize the active and repressed chromatin regions into distinct architectural domains. Science , this issue p. 1017"

Florio et al. combed through genes expressed in the progenitor cells that build the neocortex and zeroed in on one gene found in humans but not in mice. The gene, which seems to differentiate humans from chimpanzees, drives proliferation of the key progenitor cells. Mice expressing this human gene during development built more elaborate brains.

One strategy would be to block the Ebola virus's ability to enter host cells. Cells engulf Ebola virus particles, which then traffic into the cell in structures called endosomes. Sakurai et al. now report that the Ebola virus requires calcium channels called two-pore channels (TPCs) in endosomal membranes for successful entry (see the Perspective by Falzarano and Feldmann). The Ebola virus could not enter cells lacking TPCs or cells treated with a TPC inhibitor. Blocking TPCs therapeutically allowed 50% of mice to survive an ordinarily lethal Ebola virus infection.

https://openalex.org/W2069475437,"Emulsification is a powerful, well-known technique for mixing and dispersing immiscible components within a continuous liquid phase. Consequently, emulsions are central components of medicine, food and performance materials. Complex emulsions, including Janus droplets (that is, droplets with faces of differing chemistries) and multiple emulsions, are of increasing importance in pharmaceuticals and medical diagnostics, in the fabrication of microparticles and capsules for food, in chemical separations, in cosmetics, and in dynamic optics. Because complex emulsion properties and functions are related to the droplet geometry and composition, the development of rapid, simple fabrication approaches allowing precise control over the droplets' physical and chemical characteristics is critical. Significant advances in the fabrication of complex emulsions have been made using a number of procedures, ranging from large-scale, less precise techniques that give compositional heterogeneity using high-shear mixers and membranes, to small-volume but more precise microfluidic methods. However, such approaches have yet to create droplet morphologies that can be controllably altered after emulsification. Reconfigurable complex liquids potentially have great utility as dynamically tunable materials. Here we describe an approach to the one-step fabrication of three- and four-phase complex emulsions with highly controllable and reconfigurable morphologies. The fabrication makes use of the temperature-sensitive miscibility of hydrocarbon, silicone and fluorocarbon liquids, and is applied to both the microfluidic and the scalable batch production of complex droplets. We demonstrate that droplet geometries can be alternated between encapsulated and Janus configurations by varying the interfacial tensions using hydrocarbon and fluorinated surfactants including stimuli-responsive and cleavable surfactants. This yields a generalizable strategy for the fabrication of multiphase emulsions with controllably reconfigurable morphologies and the potential to create a wide range of responsive materials."

A subset of human tumors harbors mutations in the promoter region of the TERT gene, which codes for a subunit of telomerase.

The mutations were associated with aberrantly high levels of TERT mRNA, TERT protein and telomerase activity, and longer telomeres. A small study of clinical samples suggested that high levels of TERT mRNA may be a marker of more aggressive urothelial cancers. Science , this issue p. 1006"

Which recent climate changes have been forced by greenhouse gas emissions, and which have been natural fluctuations of the climate system? Steinman et al. combined observational data and a large collection of climate models to assess the Northern Hemisphere climate over the past 150 years (see the Perspective by Booth). At various points in time, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation have played particularly large roles in producing temperature trends. Their effects have combined to cause the apparent pause in warming at the beginning of the 21st century, known as the warming “hiatus.” This pause is projected to end in the near future as temperatures resume their upward climb.

https://openalex.org/W2064550415,"Low energy states delay aging in multiple species, yet mechanisms coordinating energetics and longevity across tissues remain poorly defined. The conserved energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and its corresponding phosphatase calcineurin modulate longevity via the CREB regulated transcriptional coactivator (CRTC)-1 in C. elegans. We show that CRTC-1 specifically uncouples AMPK/calcineurin-mediated effects on lifespan from pleiotropic side effects by reprogramming mitochondrial and metabolic function. This pro-longevity metabolic state is regulated cell nonautonomously by CRTC-1 in the nervous system. Neuronal CRTC-1/CREB regulates peripheral metabolism antagonistically with the functional PPARα ortholog, NHR-49, drives mitochondrial fragmentation in distal tissues, and suppresses the effects of AMPK on systemic mitochondrial metabolism and longevity via a cell-nonautonomous catecholamine signal. These results demonstrate that while both local and distal mechanisms combine to modulate aging, distal regulation overrides local contribution. Targeting central perception of energetic state is therefore a potential strategy to promote healthy aging."

Particle accelerators in space The acceleration of charged particles to high energies has been a major mystery, with a number of competing theories based on plasma physics. Many include the concept of turbulence, but with different roles. For example, shock-based theories emphasize the importance of turbulence developed from an unstable shock layer, whereas turbulent reconnection theories emphasize interactions of multiple reconnection sites. Matsumoto et al. present results of a large particle-in-cell simulation and examine how electrons are accelerated in the transition layer of a fast nonrelativistic shock (see the Perspective by Ji and Zweibel). Surprisingly, they find that when the shock is strong enough, charged particles (electrons in this case) are efficiently accelerated by turbulent reconnection within a turbulent shock layer containing multiscale structures.

Although this pathway has evolved to help cells adapt in the presence of challenging conditions, it is co-opted in cancer to support malignancy. However, the mechanisms that regulate ​HSF1 and thus cellular stress response are poorly understood. Here we show that the ubiquitin ligase ​FBXW7α interacts with ​HSF1 through a conserved motif phosphorylated by ​GSK3β and ​ERK1. ​FBXW7α ubiquitylates ​HSF1 and loss of ​FBXW7α results in impaired degradation of nuclear ​HSF1 and defective heat-shock response attenuation. ​FBXW7α is either mutated or transcriptionally downregulated in melanoma and ​HSF1 nuclear stabilization correlates with increased metastatic potential and disease progression. ​FBXW7α deficiency and subsequent ​HSF1 accumulation activates an invasion-supportive transcriptional program and enhances the metastatic potential of human melanoma cells.

https://openalex.org/W2013658500,"Background: There is a critical need for chemotherapeutics that overcome multidrug resistance (MDR). Results: Dp44mT is transported into the lysosome by Pgp, causing lysosomal targeting of Dp44mT and resulting in enhanced cytotoxicity in vitro and in vivo. Conclusion: Dp44mT overcomes MDR via utilization of lysosomal Pgp transport activity. Significance: DpT thiosemicarbazones offer a new therapeutic strategy to overcome MDR via utilization of lysosomal Pgp transport activity. Multidrug resistance (MDR) is a major obstacle in cancer treatment. More than half of human cancers express multidrug-resistant P-glycoprotein (Pgp), which correlates with a poor prognosis. Intriguingly, through an unknown mechanism, some drugs have greater activity in drug-resistant tumor cells than their drug-sensitive counterparts. Herein, we investigate how the novel anti-tumor agent di-2-pyridylketone 4,4-dimethyl-3-thiosemicarbazone (Dp44mT) overcomes MDR. Four different cell types were utilized to evaluate the effect of Pgp-potentiated lysosomal targeting of drugs to overcome MDR. To assess the mechanism of how Dp44mT overcomes drug resistance, cellular studies utilized Pgp inhibitors, Pgp silencing, lysosomotropic agents, proliferation assays, immunoblotting, a Pgp-ATPase activity assay, radiolabeled drug uptake/efflux, a rhodamine 123 retention assay, lysosomal membrane permeability assessment, and DCF (2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin) redox studies. Anti-tumor activity and selectivity of Dp44mT in Pgp-expressing, MDR cells versus drug-sensitive cells were studied using a BALB/c nu/nu xenograft mouse model. We demonstrate that Dp44mT is transported by the lysosomal Pgp drug pump, causing lysosomal targeting of Dp44mT and resulting in enhanced cytotoxicity in MDR cells. Lysosomal Pgp and pH were shown to be crucial for increasing Dp44mT-mediated lysosomal damage and subsequent cytotoxicity in drug-resistant cells, with Dp44mT being demonstrated to be a Pgp substrate. Indeed, Pgp-dependent lysosomal damage and cytotoxicity of Dp44mT were abrogated by Pgp inhibitors, Pgp silencing, or increasing lysosomal pH using lysosomotropic bases. In vivo, Dp44mT potently targeted chemotherapy-resistant human Pgp-expressing xenografted tumors relative to non-Pgp-expressing tumors in mice. This study highlights a novel Pgp hijacking strategy of the unique dipyridylthiosemicarbazone series of thiosemicarbazones that overcome MDR via utilization of lysosomal Pgp transport activity."
https://openalex.org/W2067831935,"Many scientific problems can be formulated as classification tasks. Data that harbor relevant information are usually described by a large number of features. Frequently, many of these features are irrelevant for the class prediction. The efficient implementation of classification models requires identification of suitable combinations of features. The smaller number of features reduces the problem’s dimensionality and may result in higher classification performance. We developed DWFS, a web-based tool that allows for efficient selection of features for a variety of problems. DWFS follows the wrapper paradigm and applies a search strategy based on Genetic Algorithms (GAs). A parallel GA implementation examines and evaluates simultaneously large number of candidate collections of features. DWFS also integrates various filtering methods that may be applied as a pre-processing step in the feature selection process. Furthermore, weights and parameters in the fitness function of GA can be adjusted according to the application requirements. Experiments using heterogeneous datasets from different biomedical applications demonstrate that DWFS is fast and leads to a significant reduction of the number of features without sacrificing performance as compared to several widely used existing methods.

https://openalex.org/W1977597136,"Abstract Aside from glucose metabolism, insulin regulates a variety of pathways in peripheral tissues. Under insulin-resistant conditions, it is well known that insulin-stimulated glucose uptake is impaired, and many studies attribute this to a defect in Akt signaling. Here we make use of several insulin resistance models, including insulin-resistant 3T3-L1 adipocytes and fat explants prepared from high fat-fed C57BL/6J and ob/ob mice, to comprehensively distinguish defective from unaffected aspects of insulin signaling and its downstream consequences in adipocytes. Defective regulation of glucose uptake was observed in all models of insulin resistance, whereas other major actions of insulin such as protein synthesis and anti-lipolysis were normal. This defect corresponded to a reduction in the maximum response to insulin. The pattern of change observed for phosphorylation in the Akt pathway was inconsistent with a simple defect at the level of Akt. The only Akt substrate that showed consistently reduced phosphorylation was the RabGAP AS160 that regulates GLUT4 translocation. We conclude that insulin resistance in adipose tissue is highly selective for glucose metabolism and likely involves a defect in one of the components regulating GLUT4 translocation to the cell surface in response to insulin."

https://openalex.org/W2060413782,"Background HIV associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) continue to affect cognition and everyday functioning despite anti-retroviral treatment (ART). Previous studies focused on mechanisms related to monocyte/macrophage mediated inflammation. However, in the ART era, there is increasing evidence for the involvement of CD8+ T-cells in CNS pathogenesis. Methods To investigate the relationship between T-cell responses and neurocognitive impairment (NCI), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and peripheral blood CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell intracellular cytokine (IFNγ, IL-2, TNFα) and lytic marker (CD107a) expression were assessed in HIV infected subjects who underwent comprehensive neurocognitive (NC) evaluation and either initiated or changed ART. Results Data were collected from 31 participants at 70 visits. The frequency of cytokine expressing T-cells in CSF was significantly higher than in peripheral blood for CD4+T-cells: TNFα, IL-2, IFNγ and CD8+T-cells: IL-2 and IFNγ. Analysis of T-cell activity and NCI as a function of CSF HIV RNA levels suggested a general association between NCI, high CSF CD8+ (but not CD4+T-cell) cytokine expression and CSF HIV RNA <103 copies/ml (p<0.0001). Specifically, CSF CD8+ T-cell IFNγ expression correlated with severity of NCI (r = 0.57, p = 0.004). Multivariable analyses indicated that CSF CD8+T-cell IFNγ and myeloid activation (CD163) contributed equally and independently to cognitive status and a composite variable produced the strongest correlation with NCI (r = 0.83, p = 0.0001). In contrast, CD8+ cytolytic activity (CD107a expression) was negatively correlated with NCI (p = 0.05) but was dependent on CD4 levels >400/μl and low CSF HIV RNA levels (<103 copies/ml). In our longitudinal analysis of 16 subjects, higher CSF CD8+IFNγ expression at baseline predicted NC decline at follow-up (p = 0.02). Severity of NCI at follow-up correlated with level of residual HIV RNA in CSF. Conclusions Presence of IFNγ expressing CD8+ T-cells, absence of cytolytic CD8+ T-cells, high myeloid activation, and failure of ART to suppress HIV replication in CSF contribute to increased risk of HAND."
https://openalex.org/W2015111077,"In recent years, graph theory has been widely employed to probe several language properties. More specifically, the so-called word adjacency model has been proven useful for tackling several practical problems, especially those relying on textual stylistic analysis. The most common approach to treat texts as networks has simply considered either large pieces of texts or entire books. This approach has certainly worked well -- many informative discoveries have been made this way -- but it raises an uncomfortable question: could there be important topological patterns in small pieces of texts? To address this problem, the topological properties of subtexts sampled from entire books was probed. Statistical analyzes performed on a dataset comprising 50 novels revealed that most of the traditional topological measurements are stable for short subtexts. When the performance of the authorship recognition task was analyzed, it was found that a proper sampling yields a discriminability similar to the one found with full texts. Surprisingly, the support vector machine classification based on the characterization of short texts outperformed the one performed with entire books. These findings suggest that a local topological analysis of large documents might improve its global characterization. Most importantly, it was verified, as a proof of principle, that short texts can be analyzed with the methods and concepts of complex networks. As a consequence, the techniques described here can be extended in a straightforward fashion to analyze texts as time-varying complex networks."

https://openalex.org/W2017130737,"Various environmental signals integrate into a network of floral regulatory genes leading to the final decision on when to flower. Although a wealth of qualitative knowledge is available on how flowering time genes regulate each other, only a few studies incorporated this knowledge into predictive models. Such models are invaluable as they enable to investigate how various types of inputs are combined to give a quantitative readout. To investigate the effect of gene expression disturbances on flowering time, we developed a dynamic model for the regulation of flowering time in Arabidopsis thaliana. Model parameters were estimated based on expression time-courses for relevant genes, and a consistent set of flowering times for plants of various genetic backgrounds. Validation was performed by predicting changes in expression level in mutant backgrounds and comparing these predictions with independent expression data, and by comparison of predicted and experimental flowering times for several double mutants. Remarkably, the model predicts that a disturbance in a particular gene has not necessarily the largest impact on directly connected genes. For example, the model predicts that SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS (SOC1) mutation has a larger impact on APETALA1 (AP1), which is not directly regulated by SOC1, compared to its effect on LEAFY (LFY) which is under direct control of SOC1. This was confirmed by expression data. Another model prediction involves the importance of cooperativity in the regulation of APETALA1 (AP1) by LFY, a prediction supported by experimental evidence. Concluding, our model for flowering time gene regulation enables to address how different quantitative inputs are combined into one quantitative output, flowering time."

This study determined effectiveness of a health education intervention at improving school children’s knowledge and attitudes related to T. solium cysticercosis and taeniasis in Tanzania. A cluster randomised controlled health education intervention trial was conducted in 60 schools (30 primary, 30 secondary) in Mbulu district. Baseline data were collected using a structured questionnaire in the 60 schools and group discussions in three other schools. The 60 schools stratified by baseline knowledge were randomised to receive the intervention or serve as control. The health education consisted of an address by a trained teacher, a video show and a leaflet given to each pupil. Two post-intervention re-assessments (immediately and 6 months post-intervention) were conducted in all schools and the third (12 months post-intervention) was conducted in 28 secondary schools. Data were analysed using Bayesian hierarchical log-binomial models for individual knowledge and attitude questions and Bayesian hierarchical linear regression models for scores. The overall score (percentage of correct answers) improved by about 10% in all schools after 6 months, but was slightly lower among secondary schools. Monitoring alone was associated with improvement in scores by about 6%. The intervention was linked to improvements in knowledge regarding taeniasis, porcine cysticercosis, human cysticercosis, epilepsy, the attitude of condemning infected meat but it reduced the attitude of contacting a veterinarian if a pig was found to be infected with cysticercosis. Monitoring alone was linked to an improvement in how best to raise pigs.

https://openalex.org/W2042673932,"Growing genetic and molecular biological evidence suggests that the disruption of balance between Secreted Frizzled-Related Protein-1 (SFRP1) and β-catenin plays an important role in the initiation and development of multiple cancers. The aim of this study was to examine whether the expression of SFRP1 and β-catenin is associated with the clinical-pathologic features of patients with prostate cancer (PCa), and to evaluate their potential roles as predictive and prognostic biomarkers. In this study, a total of 61 patients with PCa and 10 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia were included, and we showed that the expression of SFRP1 and β-catenin was correlated with the Gleason score, survival rate and response for endocrine therapy of PCa. The survival rates of PCa patients with low SFRP1 expression (P = 0.016) or high β-catenin expression (P = 0.004) were significantly poorer. A negative correlation (r = -0.275, P = 0.032) between SFRP1 and β-catenin was observed by Chi-square test. Multivariate analysis suggested that SFRP1 (hazard ratio, 0.429; 95% confidence intervals, 0.227–0.812; P = 0.009) may serve as an independent predictive and prognostic factor for PCa. We also showed that the protein and mRNA levels of SFRP1 in androgen-dependent PCa cell line LNCaP were significantly higher than those in androgen-independent PCa cell lines DU145 and PC3. However, the protein level of β-catenin in LNCaP cells was significantly lower than that in DU145 and PC3 cells, and no significant difference of β-catenin mRNA level was observed in LNCaP, DU145 and PC3 cells. Bisulfite sequencing PCR assay revealed significantly lower methylation level of SFRP1 promoter in LNCaP cells than that in DU145 and PC3 cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that SFRP1, which expression inversely correlates with that of β-catenin, is a favorable predictive and prognostic biomarker."
https://openalex.org/W2073794835,"Myogenesis is a tightly regulated differentiation process during which precursor cells express in a coordinated fashion the myogenic regulatory factors, while down-regulating the satellite cell marker Pax7. CCAAT/Enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ) is also expressed in satellite cells and acts to maintain the undifferentiated state by stimulating Pax7 expression and by triggering a decrease in MyoD protein expression. Herein, we show that C/EBPβ protein is rapidly down-regulated upon induction of myogenesis and this is not due to changes in Cebpb mRNA expression. Rather, loss of C/EBPβ protein is accompanied by an increase in Mdm2 expression, an E3 ubiquitin ligase. We demonstrate that Mdm2 interacts with, ubiquitinates and targets C/EBPβ for degradation by the 26 S proteasome, leading to increased MyoD expression. Knockdown of Mdm2 expression in myoblasts using a shRNA resulted in high C/EBPβ levels and a blockade of myogenesis, indicating that Mdm2 is necessary for myogenic differentiation. Primary myoblasts expressing the shMdm2 construct were unable to contribute to muscle regeneration when grafted into cardiotoxin-injured muscle. The differentiation defect imposed by loss of Mdm2 could be partially rescued by loss of C/EBPβ, suggesting that the regulation of C/EBPβ turnover is a major role for Mdm2 in myoblasts. Taken together, we provide evidence that Mdm2 regulates entry into myogenesis by targeting C/EBPβ for degradation by the 26 S proteasome."

https://openalex.org/W2040831414,"The water channel aquaporin-1 (AQP1) promotes migration of many cell types. Although AQP1 is expressed in macrophages, its potential role in macrophage motility, particularly in relation with phenotype polarization, remains unknown. We here addressed these issues in peritoneal macrophages isolated from AQP1-deficient mice, either undifferentiated (M0) or stimulated with LPS to orientate towards pro-inflammatory phenotype (classical macrophage activation; M1). In non-stimulated macrophages, ablation of AQP1 (like inhibition by HgCl2) increased by 2–3 fold spontaneous migration in a Src/PI3K/Rac-dependent manner. This correlated with cell elongation and formation of lamellipodia/ruffles, resulting in membrane lipid and F4/80 recruitment to the leading edge. This indicated that AQP1 normally suppresses migration of resting macrophages, as opposed to other cell types. Resting Aqp1-/- macrophages exhibited CD206 redistribution into ruffles and increased arginase activity like IL4/IL13 (alternative macrophage activation; M2), indicating a M0-M2 shift. In contrast, upon M1 orientation by LPS in vitro or peritoneal inflammation in vivo, migration of Aqp1-/- macrophages was reduced. Taken together, these data indicate that AQP1 oppositely regulates macrophage migration, depending on stimulation or not by LPS, and that macrophage phenotypic and migratory changes may be regulated independently of external cues."

Pretreatment of cells with α2M* antagonist antibody directed against the carboxyl-terminal domain of GRP78 blocks these α2M*-mediated effects, and silencing GRP78 expression by RNAi inhibits up-regulation of ATP citrate lyase and fatty-acid synthase. α2M* induces a 2–3-fold increase in lipogenesis as determined by 6-[14C]glucose or 1-[14C]acetate incorporation into free cholesterol, cholesterol esters, triglycerides, free fatty acids, and phosphatidylcholine, which is blocked by inhibitors of fatty-acid synthase, PI 3-kinase, mTORC, or an antibody against the carboxyl-terminal domain of GRP78.

It consists of two subunits, HcmA and HcmB. To characterize the determinants of substrate specificity, we have analyzed the crystal structure of HCM from Aquincola tertiaricarbonis in complex with coenzyme B12 and the substrates (S)-3-hydroxybutyryl- and 2-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA in alternative binding. When compared with the well studied structure of bacterial and mitochondrial B12-dependent methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MCM), HCM has a highly conserved domain architecture. However, inspection of the substrate binding site identified amino acid residues not present in MCM, namely HcmA IleA90 and AspA117. AspA117 determines the orientation of the hydroxyl group of the acyl-CoA esters by H-bond formation, thus determining stereospecificity of catalysis. Accordingly, HcmA D117A and D117V mutations resulted in significantly increased activity toward (R)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA. Besides interconversion of hydroxylated acyl-CoA esters, wild-type HCM as well as HcmA I90V and I90A mutant enzymes could also isomerize pivalyl- and isovaleryl-CoA, albeit at >10 times lower rates than the favorite substrate (S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA. The nonconservative mutation HcmA D117V, however, resulted in an enzyme showing high activity toward pivalyl-CoA. Structural requirements for binding and isomerization of highly branched acyl-CoA substrates such as 2-hydroxyisobutyryl- and pivalyl-CoA, possessing tertiary and quaternary carbon atoms, respectively, are discussed.

Coenzyme B12-dependent acyl-CoA mutases are a relatively small family of enzymes catalyzing carbon skeleton rearrangements through a unique radical mechanism (1.Banerjee R.

In addition, a variant of ICM (IcmF) has been described as a fusion of ICM with the G-protein chaperon MeaI (5.Cracan V. Padovani D. Banerjee R.

Recently, we have characterized 2-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA mutase (HCM) as the newest member of the acyl-CoA mutase family (6.Yaneva N. Schuster J. Schäfer F. Lede V. Przybylski D. Paproth T. Harms H.

All these radical enzymes catalyze reversible 1,2-rearrangements of the carboxylic acid skeleton of their CoA ester substrates (Fig. 1), e.g. the MCM-catalyzed interconversion of methylmalonyl- and succinyl-CoA, with very narrow substrate specificity. Mutases play a central role in primary metabolism, such as branched-chain amino acid catabolism in mammals (MCM) and the ethylmalonyl-CoA pathway for acetate assimilation in prokaryotes (ethylmalonyl-CoA mutase). In contrast, bacterial ICM seems to be mainly involved in synthesis of secondary metabolites, such as macrolide and polyether antibiotics (7.Cracan V. Banerjee R.

However, a role of the ICM-like IcmF in bacterial catabolism of the prodrug component pivalic acid has recently been suggested (9.Cracan V. Banerjee R.

Likewise, HCM is employed in some bacteria for dissimilation of 2-hydroxyisobutyric acid (6.Yaneva N. Schuster J. Schäfer F. Lede V. Przybylski D. Paproth T. Harms H. Müller R.H. Rohwerder T.

This unusual short-chain carboxylic acid is formed during degradation of xenobiotic fuel oxygenates (10.Rohwerder T. Breuer U. Benndorf D. Lechner U. Müller R.H.

Metabolic, nutritional, iatrogenic, and artifactual sources of urinary organic acids: a comprehensive table.Clin.

Besides these characterized enzymes, several not yet identified B12-dependent mutases have been postulated to be involved in microbial degradation pathways for the anaerobic mineralization of alkanes and ethylbenzene (8.Rohwerder T.

The unusual radical mechanism exchanging a hydrogen with a thioester group bonded on vicinal carbon atoms (Fig. 1) has been thoroughly studied in MCM from the Gram-positive bacterium Propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii (PfMCM) (13.Mancia F. Keep N.H. Nakagawa A. Leadlay P.F. McSweeney S. Rasmussen B. Bösecke P. Diat O. Evans P.R.

Conformational changes on substrate binding to methylmalonyl-CoA mutase and new insights into the free radical mechanism.Structure. 1998; 6: 711-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). These studies showed that binding of the acyl-CoA substrate results in a large conformational change that causes the formation of an initial radical by homolysis of the adenosylcobalamin-cobalt bond in the coenzyme B12. This 5′-deoxyadenosyl radical abstracts a hydrogen atom from the substrate (Fig. 1). Then, the substrate radical undergoes 1,2-rearrangement by migration of the thioester group and re-abstracts the hydrogen from the adenosine to form the acyl-CoA product. A striking feature of all acyl-CoA mutases is that the coenzyme B12 and the CoA substrate are completely buried within the enzyme. The amino acids interacting with B12 and the CoA moiety of the substrate are highly conserved in all acyl-CoA mutases. In contrast, only very few residues seem to be characteristic for each mutase subfamily for specifically interacting with the acyl moiety of the substrate, namely Tyr89 and Arg207 in PfMCM (15.Mancia F.

These residues form several H-bonds with the free carboxyl group of the substrate and radical intermediate.

However, corresponding mutations, e.g. Y89F and R207Q in PfMCM, always led to inactive enzymes (17.Vlasie M.D. Banerjee R. When a spectator turns killer: suicidal electron transfer from cobalamin in methylmalonyl-CoA mutase.Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 8410-8417Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), indicating that other residues might additionally be involved in determining substrate specificity. Thus far, crystal structures for studying active site architecture and catalytic mechanism have been revealed for PfMCM (13.Mancia F. Keep N.H. Nakagawa A. Leadlay P.F. McSweeney S. Rasmussen B.

Structures of other mutases have been deduced by homology modeling based on these MCM structures (3.Erb T.J. Rétey J. Fuchs G. Alber B.E. Ethylmalonyl-CoA mutase from Rhodobacter sphaeroides defines a new subclade of coenzyme B12-dependent acyl-CoA mutases.J. Biol.

When a spectator turns killer: suicidal electron transfer from cobalamin in methylmalonyl-CoA mutase.Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 8410-8417Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) clearly showed that the current structural models for other mutases are not accurate enough. In particular, specific substrate-enzyme interaction might be controlled by different interactions than those mediated by Tyr89 and Arg207 in PfMCM, e.g. the two methyl groups of the ICM substrate isobutyryl-CoA cannot form H-bonds with the corresponding active site amino acids PheA80 and GlnA198 or any other residue as the free substrate carboxyl group does in MCM. Likewise, the preference for (S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA found in HCM cannot be explained without a reliable structure model (6.Yaneva N. Schuster J. Schäfer F. Lede V. Przybylski D. Paproth T. Harms H. Müller R.H. Rohwerder T. Bacterial acyl-CoA mutase specifically catalyzes coenzyme B12-dependent isomerization of 2-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA and (S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 15502-15511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In addition, differences in subunit organization (Fig. 2) might also lead to deviations from the thus far studied MCM structures. PfMCM and HsMCM are structurally closely related as coenzyme B12 and acyl-CoA binding sites are located on the same catalytically active subunit. PfMCM is heterodimeric, consisting of one catalytic subunit and a homologous but only regulatory subunit of similar size lacking essential binding domain residues (e.g. Tyr89 and Arg207 for acyl-CoA binding). HsMCM is homodimeric. In contrast to both PfMCM and HsMCM, however, in bacterial ICM and HCM as well as in recently described archaeal MCMs (19.Han Y. Hawkins A.S. Adams M.W. Kelly R.M.

Biochem. 2014Google Scholar), acyl-CoA and coenzyme B12 binding sites are distributed on two subunits of significantly different size (i.e. large and small subunits A and B, respectively). Here, we present the crystal structure to 2.5 Å resolution of the complex between the two subunits of recombinant HCM (HcmA and HcmB), coenzyme B12, and the substrates (S)-3-hydroxybutyryl- and 2-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA. In comparison with the structure of MCM, decisive differences in the active site could be identified, enabling the specific interconversion of (S)-3-hydroxybutyryl- and 2-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA. 2-Hydroxyisobutyric acid (>98%) was purchased from Merck Schuchardt (Hohenbrunn, Germany). Anhydride of isovaleric acid (99%) was from ABCR GmbH & Co. KG (Karlsruhe, Germany). Anhydride of pivalic acid (≥98%), sodium salts of (R)-3-hydroxybutyric (96%) and (S)-3-hydroxybutyric (≥97%) acid, coenzyme B12 (≥97%), and CoA (≥93%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany). Isovaleryl- and pivalyl-CoA were prepared from their anhydrides (21.Simon E.J. Shemin D. The preparation of S-succinyl coenzyme A.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1953; 75: 2520Crossref Scopus (538) Google Scholar). 2-Hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA, (R)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA, and (S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA were synthesized from the free acid forms via thiophenyl esters (22.Padmakumar R. Gantla S. Banerjee R. A rapid method for the synthesis of methylmalonyl-coenzyme A and other CoA-esters.Anal. Biochem. 1993; 214: 318-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Genes encoding for the large and small subunits of HCM from A. tertiaricarbonis L108 (hcmA and hcmB) were cloned into pASG-IBA43 vectors (IBA GmbH, Goettingen, Germany) and chemically transformed into Escherichia coli TOP10. After growth in Luria-Bertani medium containing 100 mg liter−1 ampicillin to an optical density at 550 nm of 0.5, induction was performed with 200 μg liter−1 anhydrotetracycline for 3 h at 30 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and suspended in 100 ml of wash buffer (100 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.0) for further analysis. Likewise, hcmA mutant genes cloned into pASG-IBA43 were transformed into E. coli TOP10 and expressed as described above. Site-directed mutagenesis of the wild-type hcmA (GeneCust Europe) resulted in HcmA I90V, I90L, and I90A mutants (with the point mutations a268g, a268c, and a268g plus t269c, respectively) and in HcmA D117A and D117V mutants (with the point mutations a350c and a350t, respectively). For the purification of recombinant mutase subunits used for testing enzyme activities, crude extracts of induced E. coli cells were prepared by mechanical disruption using a mixer mill (MM 400, Retsch GmbH, Haan, Germany) with glass beads (212–300 μm, Sigma) at 30 s−1 for 30 min. The recombinant HcmA and HcmB subunits were purified with the help of their His- and Strep-tags, respectively, as described previously (6.Yaneva N. Schuster J. Schäfer F. Lede V. Przybylski D.

For protein purification of A. tertiaricarbonis HcmA and HcmB used for crystallization, the E. coli cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm NaH2PO4, 500 mm NaCl, 30 mm imidazole, 5% glycerol, pH 7.5), homogenized, and ultracentrifuged at 48,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatants were loaded onto a HisTrap (GE Healthcare) nickel affinity chromatography column and eluted with 250 mm imidazole. The pooled fractions were applied to a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 prep grade (GE Healthcare) size-exclusion chromatography column using 20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 5% glycerol, pH 7.5, as buffer and concentrated to 20 mg ml−1. Crystals were grown in 16% PEG 3350, 0.1 m Tris, pH 7.5, by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method at 4 °C after mixing 0.7 μl of protein solution with 0.3 μl of microseeds (of previously grown HCM crystals) and 1 μl of reservoir buffer. The protein solution was prepared by mixing the two individual proteins HcmA and HcmB in equimolar ratio to 12 mg ml−1 followed by the addition of 2 mm coenzyme B12 and 6 mm (S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA. Crystals, which appeared after 2 days at 4 °C, were directly frozen into liquid nitrogen after opening the cover glass with the crystallization drop. No cryoprotectant was added, but we noted that crystals from drops that were in contact with air for a prolonged time (∼30–60 s between reservoir opening and shock cooling) during crystal harvesting resulted in better cryoprotection and diffraction, most likely due to partial water evaporation. Diffraction data were collected to a resolution of 2.5 Å using synchrotron radiation (beamline BL14.1 at Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin (HZB) BESSY II in Berlin, Germany). Data processing was accomplished using XDS (23.Kabsch W. XDS.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (11288) Google Scholar) for integration and SCALA (24.Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 The CCP4 suite: programs for protein crystallography.Acta Crystallogr.

With unit cell dimensions a = 69.0 Å, b = 119.6 Å, and c = 173.9 Å, the crystal belongs to space group C2 and contains four protein chains per asymmetric unit (two HcmA chains and two HcmB chains).

Briefly, equimolar amounts (3 μm) of recombinant HcmA and HcmB were incubated in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.6) amended with 833 μm coenzyme B12, 10 mm MgCl2, and 10% glycerol at 30 °C in the dark. After a 5-min preincubation, the reaction was started by adding acyl-CoA substrate. For stopping the reaction, samples were mixed with an equal volume of 100 mm acetate buffer (pH 3.5) and heated at 60 °C for 5 min prior to HPLC analysis. Kinetic parameters were calculated by nonlinear regression analysis applying the Michaelis-Menten equation (OriginPro 9). The structure of HCM in complex with coenzyme B12 and the substrates (S)-3-hydroxybutyryl- and 2-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA has been determined to 2.5 Å resolution (Fig. 3). In contrast to the structure of HsMCM and PfMCM in which two domains are connected by a long linker, HCM consists of two different subunits representing the MCM domains, HcmA for the N-terminal TIM barrel domain and HcmB for the C-terminal Rossmann fold domain (13.Mancia F.

https://openalex.org/W2043722728,"The impact of population bottlenecks is an important factor to consider when assessing species survival. Population declines can considerably limit the evolutionary potential of species and make them more susceptible to stochastic events. New Zealand has a well documented history of decline of endemic avifauna related to human colonization. Here, we investigate the genetic effects of a recent population decline in the endangered kea (Nestor notabilis). Kea have undergone a long-lasting persecution between the late 1800s to 1970s where an estimated 150,000 kea were culled under a governmental bounty scheme. Kea now number 1,000–5,000 individuals in the wild and it is likely that the recent population decline may have reduced the genetic diversity of the species. Comparison of contemporary (n = 410), historical (n = 15) and fossil samples (n = 4) showed a loss of mitochondrial diversity since the end of the last glaciation (Otiran Glacial) but no loss of overall genetic diversity associated with the cull. Microsatellite data indicated a recent bottleneck for only one population and a range-wide decline in Ne dating back some 300 – 6,000 years ago, a period predating European arrival in NZ. These results suggest that despite a recent human persecution, kea might have experienced a large population decline before stabilizing in numbers prior to human settlement of New Zealand in response to Holocene changes in habitat distribution. Our study therefore highlights the need to understand the respective effects of climate change and human activities on endangered species dynamics when proposing conservation guidelines."

https://openalex.org/W1996004753,"Background A novel avian H7N9 virus with a high case fatality rate in humans emerged in China in 2013. We evaluated the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of a candidate Vero cell culture-derived whole-virus H7N9 vaccine in small animal models. Methods Antibody responses induced in immunized DBA/2J mice and guinea pigs were evaluated by hemagglutination inhibition (HI), microneutralization (MN), and neuraminidase inhibition (NAi) assays. T-helper cell responses and IgG subclass responses in mice were analyzed by ELISPOT and ELISA, respectively. Vaccine efficacy against lethal challenge with wild-type H7N9 virus was evaluated in immunized mice. H7N9-specific antibody responses induced in mice and guinea pigs were compared to those induced by a licensed whole-virus pandemic H1N1 (H1N1pdm09) vaccine. Results The whole-virus H7N9 vaccine induced dose-dependent H7N9-specific HI, MN and NAi antibodies in mice and guinea pigs. Evaluation of T-helper cell responses and IgG subclasses indicated the induction of a balanced Th1/Th2 response. Immunized mice were protected against lethal H7N9 challenge in a dose-dependent manner. H7N9 and H1N1pdm09 vaccines were similarly immunogenic. Conclusions The induction of H7N9-specific antibody and T cell responses and protection against lethal challenge suggest that the Vero cell culture-derived whole-virus vaccine would provide an effective intervention against the H7N9 virus."

The ability of TOG domains to differentially promote MT polymerization rates may be partially explained by variation in TOG domain architectures. Structures to date of Saccharomyces cerevisiae TOG1 and TOG2, Drosophila melanogaster Mini spindles (Msps) TOG2 and TOG4, Caenorhabditis elegans ZYG-9 TOG3, and Homo sapiens ch-TOG TOG4 show that TOG domains have different architectural features that are dependent on the position of TOG domains within the array (16Fox J.C.

Specifically, TOG domains 1 and 2 are structurally similar to each other within and across species, whereas the structure of TOG4 is conserved across species but diverges from TOG1 and TOG2. The ZYG-9 TOG3 structure is unique among TOG domains solved to date, having an additional N-terminal HR positioned orthogonal to the other HRs in the TOG domain that interacts with HRs A–C (39Al-Bassam J. Larsen N.A. Hyman A.A. Harrison S.C.

Studies hypothesize that ZYG-9 TOG3, which is the ultimate TOG domain in the ZYG-9 trimeric TOG domain array, is most similar to TOG5 from pentameric XMAP215 family members, but structural evidence for this observation is still at large (39Al-Bassam J. Larsen N.A. Hyman A.A. Harrison S.C.

Two distinct questions arise from the determination that TOG domains have differential architectures and abilities to promote MT plus-end polymerization; the first concerns whether TOG domains in the pentameric array have a similar or distinct function, and the second concerns whether all the TOG domains bind free tubulin or a subset selectively binds MT lattice-incorporated tubulin. The latter suggests that XMAP215 TOG domain arrays are composed of position-specific TOG domain architectures that recognize different tubulin structural states, which may play a key mechanistic role in XMAP215-mediated MT polymerization. The divergent, yet positionally conserved architecture of TOG4, supports this hypothesis (16Fox J.C. Howard A.E. Currie J.D. Rogers S.L. Slep K.C. The XMAP215 family drives microtubule polymerization using a structurally diverse TOG array.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2014; 25: 2375-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Although structures of TOG domains 1, 2, and 4 are well described, structural information characterizing TOG3 and TOG5 from pentameric XMAP215 family members is lacking and is required to move toward a full understanding of the XMAP215-dependent MT polymerization mechanism. Here, we present the x-ray crystal structure of D. melanogaster Msps TOG3, the first TOG3 structure reported from a pentameric XMAP215 family member. Msps TOG3 has unique structural elements that deviate from other TOG domain structures determined to date, including an extended HR B intra-HEAT loop and a stabilizing C-terminal tail that binds along HRs C–F. Although Msps TOG3 has unique structural features, modeling suggests that TOG3 has preserved the position of conserved tubulin-binding intra-HEAT loop residues in arrangements that mimic those observed in the Stu2 TOG1·αβ-tubulin and TOG2·αβ-tubulin complex structures. Our findings suggest that TOG3 binds αβ-tubulin in a mode similar to TOG1 and TOG2 but different from TOG4, highlighting the polarized nature of architecturally distinct TOG domains in the pentameric XMAP215 family TOG domain array, which is collectively used to promote the rate of MT polymerization. Proteins used to determine conservation included Msps (D. melanogaster), ch-TOG (Homo sapiens), CKAP5 (Bos taurus), CKAP5 (Gallus gallus), CKAP5 (Pan troglodytes), CKAP5 (Mus musculus), XMAP215 (X. laevis), MOR1 (Arabidopsis thaliana), TMBP200 (Nicotiana tabacum), CP224 (Dictyostelium discoideum), ZYG-9 (Caenorhabditis elegans), and Stu2 (S. cerevisiae). Clustal Omega was used to produce preliminary alignments that were then adjusted manually. D. melanogaster Msps TOG3 (residues 582–825) was subcloned into pET28 (Novagen), engineering an N-terminal His6 tag. Msps TOG3 R816A was generated using a single round of QuikChange mutagenesis (Agilent Technologies, Cary, NC). pET28-TOG3 constructs were transformed into BL21 DE3 (pLysS) Escherichia coli for recombinant expression. Cultures (6 liters) were grown at 37 °C under kanamycin selection. Upon reaching an optical density of 0.6 (600 nm), protein expression was induced with 0.125 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The temperature was reduced to 18 °C, and cultures were grown for 20 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 2,100 × g for 8 min. Pellets were resuspended in 200 ml of buffer A (25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, and 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol) and stored at −20 °C. Selenomethionine (SeMet)-substituted Msps TOG3 expression and purification followed the above protocol with the following alterations: pET28-TOG3 was transformed into B834 DE3 auxotrophic E. coli and grown in 6 liters of minimal media (Molecular Dimensions) supplemented with l-SeMet (15 μg/ml). At an optical density (600 nm) of 0.4, protein expression was induced, and cells were grown at 18 °C for 12 h (45Leahy D.J. Erickson H.P. Aukhil I. Joshi P. Hendrickson W.A.

Native, R816A, and SeMet-substituted Msps TOG3 were purified using affinity and ion exchange chromatography. Pellets were thawed, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added, and cells were lysed by sonication at 4 °C. Lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 23,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was loaded onto a 10-ml Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen) and subsequently washed with buffer A. A 250-ml linear gradient between buffer A and buffer B (25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 300 mm imidazole, and 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol) was used to elute TOG3. Protein-containing fractions were pooled and exchanged into buffer A, and the His6 tag was cleaved by incubation with thrombin (Haematologic Technologies) for 16 h at 4 °C. The digested protein was filtered over a benzamidine-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) column to remove thrombin and successively exchanged into buffer Q (25 mm Tris, pH 9.1, and 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol). Protein was loaded onto a 10-ml Q-Sepharose fast flow (GE Healthcare) column and washed with buffer Q. Protein was eluted using a 250-ml linear gradient between buffer Q and buffer HQ (25 mm Tris, pH 9.1, 1 m NaCl, and 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol). Fractions deemed >98% pure by SDS-PAGE analysis were buffer-exchanged into storage buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol), concentrated to 15 mg/ml, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Crystallization of native and SeMet-substituted Msps TOG3 followed the hanging drop diffusion method. After 1 day of equilibration at 20 °C, native Msps TOG3 rod-shaped crystals appeared in drops containing 2 μl of protein at 15 mg/ml and 2 μl of a 500-μl well solution (33% PEG 4000 and 27 mm potassium phosphate monobasic).

Here we compare the transcriptomes of mouse SKPs and SKP-derived fibroblasts (SFBs) by RNA-Seq analysis, trying to find differences in gene expression between the two kinds of cells and then elucidate the candidate genes that may play important roles in the differentiation of SKPs into fibroblasts. A total of 1971 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by RNA-Seq, which provided abundant data for further analysis. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis revealed that genes related to cell differentiation, cell proliferation, protein binding, transporter activity and membrane were significantly enriched. The most significantly up-regulated genes Wnt4, Wisp2 and Tsp-1 and down-regulated genes Slitrk1, Klk6, Agtr2, Ivl, Msx1, IL15, Atp6v0d2, Kcne1l and Thbs4 may play important roles in the differentiation of SKPs into fibroblasts. KEGG analysis showed that DEGs were significantly enriched in the TGF-β signaling pathway, Wnt signaling pathway and Notch signaling pathway, which have been previously proven to regulate the differentiation and self-renewal of various stem cells. These identified DEGs and pathways could facilitate further investigations of the detailed molecular mechanisms, making it possible to take advantage of the potential therapeutic applications of SKPs in skin regeneration in the future."
https://openalex.org/W1992525535,"What is the dominating mechanism of the price dynamics in financial systems is of great interest to scientists. The problem whether and how volatilities affect the price movement draws much attention. Although many efforts have been made, it remains challenging. Physicists usually apply the concepts and methods in statistical physics, such as temporal correlation functions, to study financial dynamics. However, the usual volatility-return correlation function, which is local in time, typically fluctuates around zero. Here we construct dynamic observables nonlocal in time to explore the volatility-return correlation, based on the empirical data of hundreds of individual stocks and 25 stock market indices in different countries. Strikingly, the correlation is discovered to be non-zero, with an amplitude of a few percent and a duration of over two weeks. This result provides compelling evidence that past volatilities nonlocal in time affect future returns. Further, we introduce an agent-based model with a novel mechanism, that is, the asymmetric trading preference in volatile and stable markets, to understand the microscopic origin of the volatility-return correlation nonlocal in time."
https://openalex.org/W1994763747,"Coronary magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) requires a correctly timed trigger delay derived from a scout cine scan to synchronize k-space acquisition with the quiescent period of the cardiac cycle. However, heart rate changes between breath-held cine and free-breathing coronary imaging may result in inaccurate timing errors. Additionally, the determined trigger delay may not reflect the period of minimal motion for both left and right coronary arteries or different segments. In this work, we present a whole-heart coronary imaging approach that allows flexible selection of the trigger delay timings by performing k-space sampling over an enlarged acquisition window. Our approach addresses coronary motion in an interactive manner by allowing the operator to determine the temporal window with minimal cardiac motion for each artery region. An electrocardiogram-gated, k-space segmented 3D radial stack-of-stars sequence that employs a custom rotation angle is developed. An interactive reconstruction and visualization platform is then employed to determine the subset of the enlarged acquisition window for minimal coronary motion. Coronary MRI was acquired on eight healthy subjects (5 male, mean age = 37 ± 18 years), where an enlarged acquisition window of 166–220 ms was set 50 ms prior to the scout-derived trigger delay. Coronary visualization and sharpness scores were compared between the standard 120 ms window set at the trigger delay, and those reconstructed using a manually adjusted window. The proposed method using manual adjustment was able to recover delineation of five mid and distal right coronary artery regions that were otherwise not visible from the standard window, and the sharpness scores improved in all coronary regions using the proposed method. This paper demonstrates the feasibility of a whole-heart coronary imaging approach that allows interactive selection of any subset of the enlarged acquisition window for a tailored reconstruction for each branch region."
https://openalex.org/W2075822522,"Background Kennedy’s disease/Spinobulbar muscular atrophy (KD/SBMA) is a degenerative neuromuscular disease affecting males. This disease is caused by polyglutamine expansion mutations of the androgen receptor (AR) gene. Although KD/SBMA has been traditionally considered a motor neuron disease, emerging evidence points to a central etiological role of muscle. We previously reported a microarray study of genes differentially expressed in muscle of three genetically unique mouse models of KD/SBMA but were unable to detect those which are androgen-dependent or are associated with onset of symptoms. Methodology/Principal Findings In the current study we examined the time course and androgen-dependence of transcriptional changes in the HSA-AR transgenic (Tg) mouse model, in which females have a severe phenotype after acute testosterone treatment. Using microarray analysis we identified differentially expressed genes at the onset and peak of muscle weakness in testosterone-treated Tg females. We found both transient and persistent groups of differentially expressed genes and analysis of gene function indicated functional groups such as mitochondrion, ion and nucleotide binding, muscle development, and sarcomere maintenance. Conclusions/Significance By comparing the current results with those from the three previously reported models we were able to identify KD/SBMA candidate genes that are androgen dependent, and occur early in the disease process, properties which are promising for targeted therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2034991313,"Adenoviruses are common pathogens. The localization of their receptors coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor, and desmoglein-2 in cell-cell junction complexes between polarized epithelial cells represents a major challenge for adenovirus infection from the apical surface. Structural proteins including hexon, penton base and fiber are excessively produced in serotype 5 adenovirus (Ad5)-infected cells. We have characterized the composition of structural protein complexes released from Ad5 infected cells and their capacity in remodeling cell-cell junction complexes. Using T84 cells as a model for polarized epithelium, we have studied the effect of Ad5 structural protein complexes in remodeling cell-cell junctions in polarized epithelium. The initial Ad5 infection in T84 cell culture was inefficient. However, progressive distortion of cell-cell junction in association with fiber release was evident during progression of Ad5 infection. Incubation of T84 cell cultures with virion-free supernatant from Ad5 infected culture resulted in distortion of cell-cell junctions and decreased infectivity of Ad5-GFP vector. We used gel filtration chromatography to fractionate fiber containing virion–free supernatant from Ad5 infected culture supernatant. Fiber containing fractions were further characterized for their capacity to inhibit the infection of Ad5-GFP vector, their composition in adenovirus structural proteins using western blot and LC-MS/MS and their capacity in remolding cell-cell junctions. Fiber molecules in complexes containing penton base and hexon, or mainly hexon were identified. Only the fiber complexes with relatively high content of penton base, but not the fiber-hexon complexes with low penton base, were able to penetrate into T84 cells and cause distortion of cell-cell junctions. Our findings suggest that these two types of fiber complexes may play different roles in adenoviral infection."
