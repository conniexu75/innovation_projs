We sought to exploit serendipity as a means of rapidly identifying unanticipated chemical transformations. By using a high-throughput, automated workflow and evaluating a large number of random reactions, we have discovered a photoredox-catalyzed C-H arylation reaction for the construction of benzylic amines, an important structural motif within pharmaceutical compounds that is not readily accessed via simple substrates. The mechanism directly couples tertiary amines with cyanoaromatics by using mild and operationally trivial conditions."

Williams et al. (p. 53 , published online 24 November) analyze the infrastructure and technology requirements required to meet this goal in California and conclude that simply using the most technologically advanced types of energy supply now available will not be enough. Instead, transportation and other sectors will need to be converted largely to electrical systems, which would make decarbonized electricity the dominant form of energy supply. Such a transformation will require technologies that are not yet commercialized and intensive public-private and interindustry coordination at every stage of the process."

https://openalex.org/W2056385567,"Abscisic acid (ABA) is an essential hormone for plants to survive environmental stresses. At the center of the ABA signaling network is a subfamily of type 2C protein phosphatases (PP2Cs), which form exclusive interactions with ABA receptors and subfamily 2 Snfl-related kinase (SnRK2s). Here, we report a SnRK2-PP2C complex structure, which reveals marked similarity in PP2C recognition by SnRK2 and ABA receptors. In the complex, the kinase activation loop docks into the active site of PP2C, while the conserved ABA-sensing tryptophan of PP2C inserts into the kinase catalytic cleft, thus mimicking receptor-PP2C interactions. These structural results provide a simple mechanism that directly couples ABA binding to SnRK2 kinase activation and highlight a new paradigm of kinase-phosphatase regulation through mutual packing of their catalytic sites."
https://openalex.org/W2774864460,"The DDB1-CUL4-RBX1 (CRL4) ubiquitin ligase family regulates a diverse set of cellular pathways through dedicated substrate receptors (DCAFs). The DCAF DDB2 detects UV-induced pyrimidine dimers in the genome and facilitates nucleotide excision repair. We provide the molecular basis for DDB2 receptor-mediated cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer recognition in chromatin. The structures of the fully assembled DDB1-DDB2-CUL4A/B-RBX1 (CRL4DDB2) ligases reveal that the mobility of the ligase arm creates a defined ubiquitination zone around the damage, which precludes direct ligase activation by DNA lesions. Instead, the COP9 signalosome (CSN) mediates the CRL4DDB2 inhibition in a CSN5 independent, nonenzymatic, fashion. In turn, CSN inhibition is relieved upon DNA damage binding to the DDB2 module within CSN-CRL4DDB2. The Cockayne syndrome A DCAF complex crystal structure shows that CRL4DCAF(WD40) ligases share common architectural features. Our data support a general mechanism of ligase activation, which is induced by CSN displacement from CRL4DCAF on substrate binding to the DCAF."

Antibiotic usage at subtherapeutic levels is postulated to confer a number of modulations in the microbes within the gut that ultimately result in growth promotion and reduced occurrence of disease. This study examined the effects of the coccidiostat monensin and the growth promoters virginiamycin and tylosin on the broiler chicken cecal microbiome and metagenome. Using a longitudinal design, cecal contents of commercial chickens were extracted and examined using 16S rRNA and total DNA shotgun metagenomic pyrosequencing. A number of genus-level enrichments and depletions were observed in response to monensin alone, or monensin in combination with virginiamycin or tylosin. Of note, monensin effects included depletions of Roseburia, Lactobacillus and Enterococcus, and enrichments in Coprococcus and Anaerofilum. The most notable effect observed in the monensin/virginiamycin and monensin/tylosin treatments, but not in the monensin-alone treatments, was enrichments in Escherichia coli. Analysis of the metagenomic dataset identified enrichments in transport system genes, type I fimbrial genes, and type IV conjugative secretion system genes. No significant differences were observed with regard to antimicrobial resistance gene counts. Overall, this study provides a more comprehensive glimpse of the chicken cecum microbial community, the modulations of this community in response to growth promoters, and targets for future efforts to mimic these effects using alternative approaches."

https://openalex.org/W2029021490,"Atypical antipsychotic drugs, such as clozapine and risperidone, have a high affinity for the serotonin 5-HT(2A) G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), the 2AR, which signals via a G(q) heterotrimeric G protein. The closely related non-antipsychotic drugs, such as ritanserin and methysergide, also block 2AR function, but they lack comparable neuropsychological effects. Why some but not all 2AR inhibitors exhibit antipsychotic properties remains unresolved. We now show that a heteromeric complex between the 2AR and the G(i)-linked GPCR, metabotropic glutamate 2 receptor (mGluR2), integrates ligand input, modulating signaling output and behavioral changes. Serotonergic and glutamatergic drugs bind the mGluR2/2AR heterocomplex, which then balances Gi- and Gq-dependent signaling. We find that the mGluR2/2AR-mediated changes in Gi and Gq activity predict the psychoactive behavioral effects of a variety of pharmocological compounds. These observations provide mechanistic insight into antipsychotic action that may advance therapeutic strategies for disorders including schizophrenia and dementia."

https://openalex.org/W2088969742,"B-type lamins, the major components of the nuclear lamina, are believed to be essential for cell proliferation and survival. We found that mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) do not need any lamins for self-renewal and pluripotency. Although genome-wide lamin-B binding profiles correlate with reduced gene expression, such binding is not directly required for gene silencing in ESCs or trophectoderm cells. However, B-type lamins are required for proper organogenesis. Defects in spindle orientation in neural progenitor cells and migration of neurons probably cause brain disorganizations found in lamin-B null mice. Thus, our studies not only disprove several prevailing views of lamin-Bs but also establish a foundation for redefining the function of the nuclear lamina in the context of tissue building and homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2005302422,"Background Although androgens are depleted in castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), metastases still express nuclear androgen receptor (AR) and androgen regulated genes. We recently reported that C-terminal truncated constitutively active AR splice variants contribute to CRPC development. Since specific antibodies detecting all C-terminal truncated AR variants are not available, our aim was to develop an approach to assess the prevalence and function of AR variants in prostate cancer (PCa). Methodology/Principal Findings Using 2 antibodies against different regions of AR protein (N- or C-terminus), we successfully showed the existence of AR variant in the LuCaP 86.2 xenograft. To evaluate the prevalence of AR variants in human PCa tissue, we used this method on tissue microarrays including 50 primary PCa and 162 metastatic CRPC tissues. RT-PCR was used to confirm AR variants. We observed a significant decrease in nuclear C-terminal AR staining in CRPC but no difference between N- and C-terminal AR nuclear staining in primary PCa. The expression of the AR regulated proteins PSA and PSMA were marginally affected by the decrease in C-terminal staining in CRPC samples. These data suggest that there is an increase in the prevalence of AR variants in CRPC based on our ability to differentiate nuclear AR expression using N- and C-terminal AR antibodies. These findings were validated using RT-PCR. Importantly, the loss of C-terminal immunoreactivity and the identification of AR variants were different depending on the site of metastasis in the same patient. Conclusions We successfully developed a novel immunohistochemical approach which was used to ascertain the prevalence of AR variants in a large number of primary PCa and metastatic CRPC. Our results showed a snapshot of overall high frequency of C-terminal truncated AR splice variants and site specific AR loss in CRPC, which could have utility in stratifying patients for AR targeted therapeutics."

https://openalex.org/W2070498223,"Introns are removed from pre-mRNAs during transcription while the pre-mRNA is still tethered to the gene locus via RNA polymerase. However, during alternative splicing, it is important that splicing be deferred until all of the exons and introns involved in the choice have been synthesized. We have developed an in situ RNA imaging method with single-molecule sensitivity to define the intracellular sites of splicing. Using this approach, we found that the normally tight coupling between transcription and splicing is broken in situations where the intron's polypyrimidine tract is sequestered within strong secondary structures. We also found that in two cases of alternative splicing, in which certain exons are skipped due to the activity of the RNA-binding proteins Sxl and PTB, splicing is uncoupled from transcription. This uncoupling occurs only on the perturbed introns, whereas the preceding and succeeding introns are removed cotranscriptionally. PAPERCLIP:"
https://openalex.org/W2059210701,"Gram-negative bacteria produce outer membrane vesicles that play a role in the delivery of virulence factors to host cells. However, little is known about the membrane-derived vesicles (MVs) produced by gram-positive bacteria. The present study examined the production of MVs from Staphylococcus aureus and investigated the delivery of MVs to host cells and subsequent cytotoxicity. Four S. aureus strains tested, two type strains and two clinical isolates, produced spherical nanovesicles during in vitro culture. MVs were also produced during in vivo infection of a clinical S. aureus isolate in a mouse pneumonia model. Proteomic analysis showed that 143 different proteins were identified in the S. aureus-derived MVs. S. aureus MVs were interacted with the plasma membrane of host cells via a cholesterol-rich membrane microdomain and then delivered their component protein A to host cells within 30 min. Intact S. aureus MVs induced apoptosis of HEp-2 cells in a dose-dependent manner, whereas lysed MVs neither delivered their component into the cytosol of host cells nor induced cytotoxicity. In conclusion, this study is the first report that S. aureus MVs are an important vehicle for delivery of bacterial effector molecules to host cells."

https://openalex.org/W2004297150,"DNA mismatch repair (MMR) increases replication fidelity by eliminating mispaired bases resulting from replication errors. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, mispairs are primarily detected by the Msh2-Msh6 complex and corrected following recruitment of the Mlh1-Pms1 complex. Here, we visualized functional fluorescent versions of Msh2-Msh6 and Mlh1-Pms1 in living cells. We found that the Msh2-Msh6 complex is an S phase component of replication centers independent of mispaired bases; this localized pool accounted for 10%–15% of MMR in wild-type cells but was essential for MMR in the absence of Exo1. Unexpectedly, Mlh1-Pms1 formed nuclear foci that, although dependent on Msh2-Msh6 for formation, rarely colocalized with Msh2-Msh6 replication-associated foci. Mlh1-Pms1 foci increased when the number of mispaired bases was increased; in contrast, Msh2-Msh6 foci were unaffected. These findings suggest the presence of replication machinery-coupled and -independent pathways for mispair recognition by Msh2-Msh6, which direct formation of superstoichiometric Mlh1-Pms1 foci that represent sites of active MMR."
https://openalex.org/W1993480617,"Nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) is an agonist-generated second messenger that releases Ca2+ from intracellular acidic Ca2+ stores. Recent evidence has identified the two-pore channels (TPCs) within the endolysosomal system as NAADP-regulated Ca2+ channels that release organellar Ca2+ in response to NAADP. However, little is known about the mechanism coupling NAADP binding to calcium release. To identify the NAADP binding site, we employed a photoaffinity labeling method using a radioactive photoprobe based on 5-azido-NAADP ([32P-5N3]NAADP) that exhibits high affinity binding to NAADP receptors. In several systems that are widely used for studying NAADP-evoked Ca2+ signaling, including sea urchin eggs, human cell lines (HEK293, SKBR3), and mouse pancreas, 5N3-NAADP selectively labeled low molecular weight sites that exhibited the diagnostic pharmacology of NAADP-sensitive Ca2+ release. Surprisingly, we were unable to demonstrate labeling of endogenous, or overexpressed, TPCs. Furthermore, labeling of high affinity NAADP binding sites was preserved in pancreatic samples from TPC1 and TPC2 knock-out mice. These photolabeling data suggest that an accessory component within a larger TPC complex is responsible for binding NAADP that is unique from the core channel itself. This observation necessitates critical evaluation of current models of NAADP-triggered activation of the TPC family.

https://openalex.org/W1967779656,"Despite its central role in signaling and the potential therapeutic applications of inverse agonists, the molecular mechanisms underlying G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) constitutive activity remain largely to be explored. In this context, ghrelin receptor GHS-R1a is a peculiar receptor in the sense that it displays a strikingly high, physiologically relevant, constitutive activity. To identify the molecular mechanisms responsible for this high constitutive activity, we have reconstituted a purified GHS-R1a monomer in a lipid disc. Using this reconstituted system, we show that the isolated ghrelin receptor per se activates G(q) in the absence of agonist, as assessed through guanosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate) binding experiments. The measured constitutive activity is similar in its extent to that observed in heterologous systems and in vivo. This is the first direct evidence for the high constitutive activity of the ghrelin receptor being an intrinsic property of the protein rather than the result of influence of its cellular environment. Moreover, we show that the isolated receptor in lipid discs recruits arrestin-2 in an agonist-dependent manner, whereas it interacts with μ-AP2 in the absence of ligand or in the presence of ghrelin. Of importance, these differences are linked to ligand-specific GHS-R1a conformations, as assessed by intrinsic fluorescence measurements. The distinct ligand requirements for the interaction of purified GHS-R1a with arrestin and AP2 provide a new rationale to the differences in basal and agonist-induced internalization observed in cells."

This Essay attempts to outline roles computer vision may play and should play in image-based studies of cellular life. Computer vision refers to the theory and implementation of artificial systems that extract information from images to understand their content. Although computers are widely used by cell biologists for visualization and measurement, interpretation of image content, i.e., the selection of events worth observing and the definition of what they mean in terms of cellular mechanisms, is mostly left to human intuition. This Essay attempts to outline roles computer vision may play and should play in image-based studies of cellular life. Microscope images and especially time-lapse image sequences contain information about the dynamics of cells, the distribution of subcellular components, and the activity of molecules that is inaccessible to other techniques. Three parallel technical developments have fueled the unique role light microscopy plays today in the study of cells. First, bright and genetically encoded fluorescent probes allow us to follow the distribution and activity of several molecular species within a cell. Second, optimized optics and feedback-controlled microscope hardware permit efficient acquisition of large, high-quality image datasets. Third, rapid advances in electronic detector technology enable the recording of images with ever more sensitivity. Single-molecule detection is now routine, even in living cells. Quite surprisingly, these innovations in microscopic imaging have not been paralleled by developments of image analysis tools. Here, it is essential to clarify the difference between image processing and image analysis. Image-processing tools transform the signal to emphasize a particular aspect of an image. Examples of image-processing methods include contrast and color enhancement, deconvolution, image registration, filtering, and even segmentation. None of these methods interpret the image content, although they may greatly facilitate that task. With the advent of the first digital images in the 1960s (Inoue and Spring, 1997Inoue S. Spring K. Video Microscopy.Second Edition. Plenum Press, New York1997Crossref Google Scholar), cell biologists thus began to use computer programs to manipulate their images in order to “better see what needs to be seen.” However, the ultimate task of assigning meaning to image events has been left to the human observer. Even today the great majority of image-based studies in cell biology still rely on human visual inspection to build a model of the image content. Computer vision is an application area of Artificial Intelligence (AI), broadly defined as the science and engineering of making machines intelligent. Accordingly, computer vision scientists are preoccupied with making machines that can see. Here, see means capable of extracting information from an image in order to solve a particular task or interpret the scene in a limited or broad sense. Computer vision systems are implemented in a wide range of industrial and scientific applications, including systems for the control of robots and autonomous vehicles, video surveillance and inspection, organization of image databases, object modeling, and human-machine interfaces. With all these applications the goal is to replace the human observer, at least in part, during the interpretation of image contents, including the decision of which image events are relevant to answering a particular question. The output of a computer vision program is an abstract representation—a model—of a particular aspect of the image or of the entire image content. Based on the model, robots plan their next actions, autonomous vehicles change speed or driving direction, fire alarms are initiated, images of maple leafs are searched on the internet, the morphology of a brain tumor is defined, or the graphics of video games are adjusted to the pose of the player. Translating the computer vision paradigm to microscopy in a cell biological study, a computer vision system will replace the cell biologist's staring at images for the purpose of describing a cellular process. This Essay focuses on the roles of computer vision in the interpretation of image data from light microscopy, although a similar essay could be written easily about the roles of computer vision in electron microscopy. The function of a computer vision program as an autonomous image interpreter has significant implications for the structure and operation of the software. In contrast to image-processing programs, which run through a fixed sequence of algorithms independent of the input image, computer vision programs progressively adjust the strategy of visual information processing to the properties of the images and to the knowledge acquired in previous processing steps. The goal of a computer vision program is to learn iteratively, as opposed to linearly, about the image content. The complexity of the learning algorithm required will of course depend on the complexity of the analysis task or the variability between scenes. For example, if a cell biological experiment delivers highly reproducible images and the goal is only to count the number of cells expressing a particular protein, the program will be able to process the images by a fixed sequence of filtering and segmentation procedures. Although in strict terms such a program still solves an image-analysis problem, its algorithmic structure does not differ much from, say, a deconvolution program where the procedures are independent of the particular image content. On the other hand, if an experiment delivers images containing several classes of cells with different dynamic properties—some known, some unknown, and some transient—and the goal is to generate a predictive model of the mixed cell population behavior, then the program will have to identify rules for how cell classes affect each other and how changes in the behavior of a particular cell class affect, for example, the chances for interaction between two cells. The program will have to distinguish meaningful from insignificant rules for building such a model. This requires an iterative learning process where the computer replaces human intuition in the search for representative patterns in the cell population behavior. The distinction of image processing and image analysis entails different requirements for the developers of software. The programmer of an image-processing program does not need to know cell biology. The programmer of a computer vision program solving a cell biological problem, on the other hand, must be a cell biologist. Needless to say, both programmers must be familiar with the mathematics of image signal processing as the computer vision program will incorporate steps like image deconvolution, filtering, and segmentation. But the key challenge in developing a computer vision system for cell biology is to conceptualize in a programmable framework the parameters, rules, and models required to characterize cell biological function. This requires profound familiarity with the cellular mechanisms, the range of valid hypotheses, and the expected shifts in phenotypes that may distinguish one model from another. It often also requires familiarity with the molecular techniques for labeling and manipulating cells and with the microscopy itself, as the experimental design directly influences whether image data can be analyzed in terms of a particular question. The first uses of computer vision systems in cellular analysis go back to the sixties, where research groups sought to replace human operator input in karyotyping (Gilbert, 1966Gilbert C.W. Nature. 1966; 212: 1437-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, Castleman et al., 1976Castleman K.R. Melnyk J. Frieden H.J. Persinger G.W. Wall R.J. Mutat. Res. 1976; 41: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The primary goal for eliminating visual inspection was to speed up the tedious processes of finding cells in mitosis, arranging the chromosome images into karyograms, and measuring and classifying features in the chromosome images for the purpose of detecting mutations and defects in the genome. Clearly, these systems qualified as image-analysis programs in that they involved several autonomous, intelligent decisions by the computer about the content of a karyogram. The accuracy of these decisions was deemed as reasonably good when compared to the classifications by a cytologist. Gilbert writes that “a majority of the misclassifications [by the computer program] occur in group III [of the karyogram], where the cytologist's identification will by no means be absolutely certain” (Gilbert, 1966Gilbert C.W. Nature. 1966; 212: 1437-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), suggesting that the performance of computer and human vision were equivalent. Other early developments of computer vision systems served the purpose of counting or tracking cells (Farnoush, 1977Farnoush A. Microsc. Acta. 1977; 80: 43-47PubMed Google Scholar, Lewandowska et al., 1979Lewandowska K. Doroszewski J. Haemmerli G. Sträuli P. Comput. Biol. Med. 1979; 9: 331-344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In their paper on neutrophil tracking, Howe et al. write: “Most methods of measuring neutrophil motility provide information mainly about the performance of a small proportion of the fastest moving cells. Application of a computer-linked image analysis technique provides a convenient, automated method of measuring the motility of the whole cell population. This makes it possible to test whether changes in motility represent a homogeneous alteration affecting all cells or a change in the numbers or performance of a subset of cells” (Howe et al., 1980Howe G.B. Swettenham K.V. Currey H.L.F. Blood. 1980; 56: 696-700PubMed Google Scholar). These sentences pointedly define two key contributions that computer vision systems can bring to image-based cell biology experiments, namely automation and completeness in extracting information from images (Figure 1). Automation is an obvious gain from using computer vision. Many of us are all too familiar with the tedious clicking for weeks and months on images that were acquired in a few minutes. The demand for automated image analysis has rapidly increased with the overwhelming amount of images that can be collected with high-throughput microscopy systems. Accordingly, many of the most recent developments of computer vision systems for cell biological studies have been driven by the need to identify phenotypes in cell morphology and subcellular protein distribution in large-scale pharmacological or genomic screens (Bakal et al., 2007Bakal C. Aach J. Church G. Perrimon N. Science. 2007; 316: 1753-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, Carpenter et al., 2006Carpenter A.E. Jones T.R. Lamprecht M.R. Clarke C. Kang I.H. Friman O.

Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 3268-3281Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). A common point between these studies is that the effects of cellular treatments can be robustly classified only by analysis of multiple image events, for example the spatial distribution, density, and colocalization of several protein markers. Acquiring multidimensional datasets from hundreds of thousands of images evidently exceeds the capacity even of teams of human operators. Computer vision systems have also been required to interpret data with an event density per image that overwhelms human analysis, such as single-cell tracking in developing tissues or following hundreds of thousands of subcellular molecular markers (Chen et al., 2009Chen Y. Ladi E. Herzmark P. Robey E. Roysam B. J. Immunol. Methods. 2009; 340: 65-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, Keller et al., 2008Keller P.J. Schmidt A.D. Wittbrodt J. Stelzer E.H.K.

J. 2005; 89: 3456-3469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). These applications will become increasingly important with the emergence of new imaging methods that monitor the molecular architecture and dynamics of entire tissues with light microscopic resolution (Micheva and Smith, 2007Micheva K.D. Smith S.J. Neuron. 2007; 55: 25-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, Orth et al., 2011Orth J.D. Kohler R.H. Foijer F. Sorger P.K. Weissleder R. Mitchison T.J. Cancer Res. 2011; 71: 4608-4616Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Completeness in data extraction is the second essential argument for using computer vision systems. Complete data are required first to characterize the full spectrum of heterogeneous behaviors and second to interpret the differential shifts of subpopulations of behaviors between experimental conditions. With incomplete data, what if the majority of selected events originate from a subpopulation of behaviors that do not change between experimental conditions? Conversely, what if the selection of events is focused on a few behaviors that do change, although most behaviors remain unaffected by an experimental shift? Images are probably more susceptible than any other kind of data used in cell biological investigation to incomplete analysis and thus biased interpretation. Although the dangers of image event selection are widely appreciated, until recently very few studies have tackled this upfront by quantifying the degree of heterogeneity in the event population. The standard is still to control heterogeneity by human selection of the important from the less important image events, unfortunately often without documenting the fraction of selected versus nonselected events. In contrast, several studies have demonstrated not only how the application of computer vision systems reduces the risk of biased interpretation in heterogeneous populations but how heterogeneity and differential cell responses can be harnessed to generate mechanistic insight into cellular pathways (Keren et al., 2008Keren K. Pincus Z. Allen G.M. Barnhart E.L. Marriott G. Mogilner A. Theriot J.A. Nature. 2008; 453: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, Slack et al., 2008Slack M.D. Martinez E.D. Wu L.F.

Nature. 2009; 461: 520-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). This approach can greatly complement molecular perturbation experiments, which in complex, nonlinear pathways tend to generate pleiotropic effects. Complete measurements also allow the detection of exceedingly rare but mechanistically significant image events. For example, a computer vision system was employed to track the transient fusion and separation of cell-surface receptors, events that occurred for about 5 in 1,000 labeled receptors (Figure 2A , left) (Jaqaman et al., 2011Jaqaman K.

Despite the infrequency of the event, related to the need for substoichometric labeling to achieve single-molecule imaging conditions, the complete measurement of all visible receptors revealed a spatial pattern in receptor interactions that turned out to be essential for the signal transduction properties of the receptor. Hence, as Howe and colleagues projected in 1980, because of the completeness of data produced by computer vision systems, information is extracted from images that will likely escape the attention of a human observer. The third and perhaps most exciting contribution that computer vision systems can make to cell biological research is to give access to image-based information that is inaccessible by eye (Figure 1). Although this seems paradoxical, computer vision programs can be directly coupled to mathematical models that describe the relation between hidden, invisible processes and measurable image events. Changes in the behavior of hidden processes are thus detectable as changes in the image. Among the first to promote this approach in cell biology were David Odde and colleagues, who coined the term model convolution. Their initial implementation of model convolution addressed metaphase kinetochore dynamics in the budding yeast S. cerevisiae (Sprague et al., 2003Sprague B.L. Pearson C.G. Maddox P.S. Bloom K.S. Salmon E.D. Odde D.J. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 3529-3546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Normal S. cerevisiae cells contain 16 pairs of sister chromatids that are segregated by a 1.5–2 μm long mitotic spindle. Given the small size of the spindle, individual kinetochores are not resolvable. Instead, upon bipolar attachment of all 16 sister chromatid pairs, the images of fluorescently labeled kinetochores merge into a blurred bilobed intensity distribution. Odde and colleagues showed that nevertheless they could infer kinetochore movements, which depend on the dynamics of kinetochore-associated microtubules. First, they modeled the hypothetical positions of all 32 kinetochores. Then, they synthesized a combined image of all kinetochores and estimated the parameters of microtubule dynamics so that the synthesized intensity distribution best matched the experimentally observed intensity distribution. Subsequently, the Odde lab also reported that the comparison between synthetic and measured images is sensitive enough to distinguish different models of the mechanism by which kinesin-5 motor proteins regulate metaphase chromosome congression (Gardner et al., 2008Gardner M.K. Bouck D.C. Paliulis L.V. Meehl J.B. O'Toole E.T. Haase J. Soubry A. Joglekar A.P. Winey M. Salmon E.D. et al.Cell. 2008; 135: 894-906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Similar model-image comparison strategies were used to estimate the parameters of interphase microtubule dynamics in mammalian cells (Shariff et al., 2010Shariff A. Murphy R.F. Rohde G.K. Cytometry A. 2010; 77A: 457-466Google Scholar), the length distribution of microtubules in vertebrate meiotic spindles (Yang et al., 2007Yang G. Houghtaling B.R. Gaetz J. Liu J.Z. Danuser G. Kapoor T.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 1233-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and intracellular force fluctuations during epithelial cell migration (Ji et al., 2008Ji L. Lim J. Danuser G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 1393-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) (Figure 2B). These examples compared model predictions and experimental data not at the level of synthetic and measured images but based on extracted image events: image texture (Shariff et al., 2010Shariff A. Murphy R.F. Rohde G.K. Cytometry A. 2010; 77A: 457-466Google Scholar); single-molecule trajectories (Yang et al., 2007Yang G. Houghtaling B.R. Gaetz J. Liu J.Z. Danuser G. Kapoor T.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 1233-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar); and fluorescent speckle flow fields (Ji et al., 2008Ji L. Lim J. Danuser G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 1393-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Comparing model and experiment by image-derived events instead of the original image generally enables better determination of free model parameters describing the hidden processes and increased robustness against image noise. Nevertheless, the key questions in recovering invisible information are the same with both approaches: How many alternative models in addition to the chosen one could accurately explain the experimental data? How much would the conclusions drawn by the alternative model differ from the conclusions drawn from the chosen model? Answering these questions requires a tight integration of model development with controlled variations in the experimental conditions in order to rule out as many alternative models as possible. Ultimately, it is essential that the remaining acceptable alternatives are documented and that it is shown that they would not fundamentally shift the conclusions. Only with these rigorous computational and experimental controls in place will it be possible to gain confidence in invisible information drawn from images. Everyone who has programmed computer vision algorithms knows how hard it is to make a computer “see” the things our eye appears to recognize effortlessly. The reason for the ease with which the human vision system identifies relevant events in complex scenes is that our brain continually associates the observable image signals with our memory of previous visual experiences and our best interpretation of the scene (Figure 1): Seeing is believing. The size of this memory is enormous. The association of the measurable signal with the recollected image of a particular scene allows our brain to interpolate missing information due to low signals and occlusions, as well as to classify a wide range of different objects. Our brain also has the amazing ability to freely combine associations with different visual experiences and to integrate information from different spatial scales. To illustrate this with an example from microscopy, we can within fractions of a second recognize the overall organization of cells in a developing tissue although we have never seen that particular specimen and at the same time identify, for instance, multinucleated, mitotic, and apoptotic cells among the many cell types present in the scene. Achieving the same classification with a computer vision system is a daunting task, mainly because it is nearly impossible to train a computer memory with the full spectrum of visual experiences that may be encountered in a microscope image. The association between actual image signal and previous visual experiences bears also dangers and limitations. Foremost, when analyzing images by eye we have to be concerned that our focus of attention is directed to events that match our expectation: Believing is seeing. This may distort our interpretation if we do not take precautions to analyze images objectively. Moreover, every individual may have a slightly different focus, leading to nonreproducible data. On a more quantitative level, an association-based image analysis may blur the boundaries between similarly looking yet distinct image events, thus reducing the sensitivity with which subtle differences between images can be classified. In such cases, computer vision systems tend to outperform human vision. One of the first examples that made this point explicit in the cell biological literature came from Bob Murphy's work on subcellular location proteomics (Murphy et al., 2003Murphy R.F. Velliste M. Porreca G. J. VLSI Sig. Proc. Syst. Sig. Image Video Technol. 2003; 35: 311-321Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Although human and computer vision classification did equally well in classifying obvious location patterns of proteins like DNA, actin, or tubulin, computer vision outperformed human vision in classifying the patterns produced by the two Golgi-associated proteins Giantin and gpp-130 and the patterns produced by the lysosomal-associated membrane protein LAMP2 versus the transferrin receptor localizing in endosomes. The better performance by the computer vision system stems from the use of systematic and reproducible metrics to determine shifts in protein pattern and, more importantly, from the integration of information from a high-dimensional parameter space. The classification used by Murphy and colleagues relied on more than 100 parameters characterizing every aspect of the image texture produced by these labeled proteins. Even after eliminating redundancy, the parameter set used for final classification contained a few dozen parameters. For a human brain, the integration of so many image events at once is impossible. Numerous publications have followed Murphy's example and reported outstanding performances of computer classification of image data by virtue of integrating high-dimensional parameter sets (Perlman et al., 2004Perlman Z.E. Slack M.D. Feng Y. Mitchison T.J. Wu L.F. Altschuler S.J. Science. 2004; 306: 1194-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, Bakal et al., 2007Bakal C. Aach J. Church G. Perrimon N. Science. 2007; 316: 1753-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, Collinet et al., 2010Collinet C. Stöter M. Bradshaw C.R. Samusik N. Rink J.C. Kenski D. Habermann B. Buchholz F. Henschel R. Mueller M.S. et al.Nature. 2010; 464: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). A second example where we found computer vision to outperform human vision was particle tracking. Presented with movies that contain thousands of particles moving between time points, a human observer tracks particles by toggling back and forth between consecutive frames to decide on correspondences between frames. Although we may consider a few particles in the immediate spatial neighborhood, and although we may toggle forward and backward two or three frames, in essence the assignment of correspondence is made for each particle individually and on the basis of particle configurations between two time points. In computer vision jargon, this is referred to as a greedy assignment. In contrast, a computer vision system can make assignments globally by integrating the positions of all particles over all time points. Reid was the first to introduce this data integration paradigm for particle tracking with the formalism of the Multi-Hypothesis-Tracking (MHT) algorithm (Reid, 1979Reid D.B. IEEE Trans. Automat. Contr. 1979; 24: 843-854Crossref Scopus (2348) Google Scholar). In brief, in the MHT framework all possible paths are constructed for all particles through all frames of a movie. Each path is attributed a cost that defines how likely the motion of a particle along the path is given the general expectation of particle behaviors in that particular dataset. For example, a path resulting in large velocity variations will be less likely, thus will get a higher cost, than a path with nearly constant velocity. From all the possible paths, the MHT algorithm then selects the largest set of mutually exclusive paths with overall minimal cost. This means that the tracking of an individual particle in one particular time point is accomplished by considering all of the past and future of that very particle as well as of all other particles in the movie. Although theoretically optimal, the MHT algorithm is impractical for image sequences of more than a few frames and with more than a hundred particles because of the combinatorial complexity of constructing all paths. In addition, the complexity grows further if the path construction has to account for temporary and/or permanent disappearance of particles and temporary particle occlusion. An entire field of computer vision is devoted to finding computationally affordable approximations to Reid's algorithms. Recent approximations designed to cope with the particularities of particle tracking in cell biology include those by Genovesio et al., 2006Genovesio A. Liedl T. Emiliani V. Parak W.J. Coppey-Moisan M. Olivo-Marin J.C. IEEE Trans. Image Process. 2006; 15: 1062-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar and Jaqaman et al., 2008Jaqaman K. Loerke D. Mettlen M. Kuwata H. Grinstein S. Schmid S.L. Danuser G. Nat. Methods. 2008; 5: 695-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar. How good these algorithms are is difficult to say, as human vision fails to provide a reliable reference for complex particle-tracking problems (Matov et al., 2010Matov A. Applegate K. Kumar P. Thoma C. Krek W. Danuser G. Wittmann T. Nat. Methods. 2010; 7: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Instead these algorithms had to be tested on simulated data. This provides merely a best case scenario analysis in that the definition of assignment costs relies on the same models of particle motion used for the simulation. Nevertheless, the gain in performance when using global information is obvious when one compares tracking solutions that assign particles per frame versus solutions that assign particles after integrating spatial and temporal information to settle on a particular link (Figure 2A, right). The two examples from pattern recognition and particle tracking illustrate the key scenario wherein current computer vision systems bear significant advantages over human vision: When a decision requires integrated analysis of a large number of possible partial solutions in a well-defined but multidimensional space, the computer will fare better. I conjecture that the integrator paradigm holds with not only computer vision but broadly with all AI applications seeking to replace aspects of human brain power. Probably the best known victory the AI community has celebrated so far was the defeat of the world champion chess player Gary Kasparov by the IBM super computer Deep Blue. Similar to MHT's strategy for particle tracking, Deep Blue had the advantage over Kasparov in that it could compute for every move all possible configurations of future moves until termination of the game and then play according to the globally best configuration. Clearly, the world is far from being taken over by intelligent machines; but, we should begin to accept that the human brain does not always set the performance bar in handling complex tasks. This includes the task of understanding images. No longer should we only see and believe; we should measure, measure completely, and integrate the various direct and indirect parameters that can be extracted from images to understand their content.

https://openalex.org/W2080206372,"Our objective was to determine whether lipocalin-2 (Lcn2) regulates cardiomyocyte apoptosis, the mechanisms involved, and the functional significance. Emerging evidence suggests that Lcn2 is a proinflammatory adipokine associated with insulin resistance and obesity-related complications, such as heart failure. Here, we used both primary neonatal rat cardiomyocytes and H9c2 cells and demonstrated for the first time that Lcn2 directly induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis, an important component of cardiac remodeling leading to heart failure. This was shown by detection of DNA fragmentation using TUNEL assay, phosphatidylserine exposure using flow cytometry to detect annexin V-positive cells, caspase-3 activity using enzymatic assay and immunofluorescence, and Western blotting for the detection of cleaved caspase-3. We also observed that Lcn2 caused translocation of the proapoptotic protein Bax to mitochondria and disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential. Using transient transfection of GFP-Bax, we confirmed that Lcn2 induced co-localization of Bax with MitoTracker® dye. Importantly, we used the fluorescent probe Phen Green SK to demonstrate an increase in intracellular iron in response to Lcn2, and depleting intracellular iron using an iron chelator prevented Lcn2-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Administration of recombinant Lcn2 to mice for 14 days increased cardiomyocyte apoptosis as well as an acute inflammatory response with compensatory changes in cardiac functional parameters. In conclusion, Lcn2-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis is of physiological significance and occurs via a mechanism involving elevated intracellular iron levels and Bax translocation."

The log phase of cell culture was obtained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (1:1; Invitrogen) containing 10% calf serum and 1% streptomycin-penicillin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The thiazolyl blue tetrazolium blue (MTT)-based cell proliferation assay was carried out as follows. 5 × 103 to 1 × 104 cells in triplicate were cultured into each well of a 96-well plate (in triplicate) for 72 h, followed by a 3-h 37 °C incubation after the addition of 10 μl (5 mg/ml) of MTT salt (Sigma). The A570 nm reading was obtained, and the mean and S.D. of the triplicate experiments were calculated and plotted (19.Fontana L. Fiori M.E. Albini S. Cifaldi L. Giovinazzi S. Forloni M. Boldrini R.

To determine the IC50, cells in triplicate were subjected to a series dilution of each drug for 72 h, followed the MTT-based analysis. The relative A570 nm readings (mean and S.D.) in each drug-treated set and in the no-drug mock sample were calculated (percentage) and plotted against the logarithm of the drug concentration. The linear regression parameters were determined for each curve, and the IC50 value was extrapolated (20.Andrisano V. Bartolini M. Gotti R. Cavrini V. Felix G.

The analysis mediated with LipofectamineTM 2000 (Invitrogen) transfection/reporter was performed as described previously (21.Wu J.Y. Maniatis T.

The cells at 60% confluence were transfected in duplication by 25 ng luciferase reporter, 50 ng carrier plasmid DNA together with 5 ng of CMV-Renilla luciferase (to control transfection efficacy) luciferase activities of the transfected cells were measured after 24 h with a dual luciferase reporter system (Promega, Madison, WI) by MiniLumat LB 9506 (Berthold, Germany). The S.D. of the ratio of the firefly luciferase over the Renilla luciferase activity of the duplicates was plotted against the tested constructs. All of the experiments were carried out at least three times, and the result from one representative experiment was presented (21.Wu J.Y. Maniatis T. Specific interactions between proteins implicated in splice site selection and regulated alternative splicing.Cell. 1993; 75: 1061-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). The miR-193a-3p mimic and antagomir (Ribobio, Guangzhou, China) transfection was performed at dose of 10 and 50 nm, respectively. For the cell cycle profiling, cells were seeded in 6-well plates at 40% confluence and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h before transfection with the mock (non-related mimic or antagomir), miR-193a-3p mimic, or antagomir with miR-193a-3p-luc reporter/CMV-Renilla reporter constructs. The transfected cells were collected and fixed by 70% ethanol at −20 °C for 24 h, stained with 50 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma), and analyzed on a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) according to the manufacturer's instructions (BD Biosciences). All flow cytometry experiments were performed at least three times, and a representative experiment is shown. Cells were lysed by the 1× SDS loading buffer (60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.25% bromphenol blue, 1.25% 2-mercaptoethanol) and then sonicated to shear the genomic DNA (Bioruptor, Diagenode, Belgium)/Western blot-analyzed with antibodies: anti-SRSF2 (AP2800a), anti-E2F1 (AP7593a), anti-E2F6 (AP6637c), anti-YWHAZ (AP8152c), anti-HDAC1(AP1101a), anti-MCL1 (AP1312a), anti-PCNA(AP2835b), anti-PHF8 (AP9276b), anti-thymidylate synthetase (AP6682b), anti-PTK2 (AP8614b), anti-CDC5L (AP8949c) (Abgent, San Diego, CA), and anti-β-actin (Sigma), respectively. The target proteins were then probed with anti-rabbit IgG peroxidase-conjugated antibody (KangChen Bio-tec, Shanghai, China), followed by an enhanced chemiluminescence reaction (Pierce). The relative levels of proteins were quantified by densitometry with the FR-200A Analysis System (Fu-Ri Technology, Shanghai, China). Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Complementary DNA synthesis was performed using a primeScript RT reagent kit (Tiangen Biotech Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) for the SYBR Green-based real-time PCR analysis in the Rotor-GeneTM 6000 system (Qiagen) of SRSF2, E2F1, ABCC8, and CASP2S/L. The expression of miR-193a-3p (Ribobio) was assessed using the 2 − ΔΔCt method with RNA content normalized to the U6 RNA (Ribobio) and to β-actin for the other genes and plotted (22.Song B. Wang Y.

The primers for qRT-PCR analysis of SRSF2, E2F1, ABCC8, CASP2S/L, and β-actin expression were synthesized by Invitrogen (supplemental Table S1). Genomic DNA was isolated by a standard phenol/chloroform purification method, qualified by electrophoresis on an agarose gel, and visualized with ethidium bromide. For DNA methylation analysis, the primers for methylation-specific PCR (MSP) and bisulfite sequencing PCR (BSP) were designed according to MethPrimer (supplemental Table S1) The methylation status of the miR-193a gene locus was determined by both MSP and BSP as described previously (23.Yu J.

Solexa sequencing-based miR expression profiling was provided by BGI (Shenzhen, China). After transfection with 50 nm miR-193a-3p or mock antagomirs (Ribobio) for 24 h, SMMC-7721 cells were collected and subcutaneously injected into the right and left flanks (1.25 × 106 cells/point) of each nude mouse (10 total), respectively. On day 12 after cell injection, five mice intraperitoneally received 5-FU (75 mg/kg mouse body weight) once per week. The remaining five mice received phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) as a mock treatment control. Also, at the same time, the right sides of all mice tumors were intratumorally injected with 50 nm miR-193a-3p antagomir, and the left sides were injected with mock antagomir (according to the manufacturer's instructions (Ribobio)). To monitor the tumor growth, the volume was measured with a Vernier caliper on days 12, 18, 25, and 32 and calculated as volume = W2 × L × 0.5 (where W and L represent the largest and next largest tumor diameters (cm)) and then plotted (26.Valeri N.

Mice were humanely sacrificed on day 32, and the tumors were weighed and photographed. Immunostaining (27.Kantar M. Kosova B. Cetingul N. Gumus S. Toroslu E. Zafer N. Topcuoglu N. Aksoylar S.

Expressions of SRSF2, E2F1, and Ki67 proteins were measured by immunochemical analysis on 5-mm slices of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor xenografts in nude mice. Antigens were retrieved by pretreating dewaxed sections in a microwave oven at 750 watts for 5 min in a citrate buffer (pH 6) and processed with the Super Sensitive Link-Labeled Detection System (Biogenex, Menarini, Florence, Italy). The enzymatic activity was developed by using 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole (Dako, Milan, Italy) as a chromogenic substrate. Following counterstaining with Mayer hematoxylin (Invitrogen), slides were mounted in aqueous mounting medium (glycergel, Dako). The relative level of each protein was calculated as the density score (mean intensity/lasso, TMAJ density score) that was determined by using TMAJ software (available from the Johns Hopkins Medical Institute Web site), and the percentage of the TMAJ reads of mock over the antagomir-transfected tumor was calculated and plotted. Data are presented as means, and error bars indicate the S.D. or S.E. All statistical analyses were performed with Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA) or Prism (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA). Two-tailed Student's t test, a one-way analysis of variance or Mann-Whitney U test was used to calculate statistical significance. A p value of <0.05 was considered to be significant. The chemoresistance of eight HCC cell lines was determined by IC50 profiling: QGY-7703, SMMC-7721, YY-8103, PLC, HepG2, BEL-7402, Hep3B, and FOCUS to gemcitabine, 5-FU, cisplatin, vinorelbine, docetaxel, mitomycin, paclitaxel, ironotecan, and epirubicin, respectively. The IC50 difference among HCC cell lines to vinorelbine, docetaxel, mitomycin, paclitaxel, and epirubicin was no more than 17-fold (Fig. 1A). However, the IC50 to 5-FU of QGY-7703 was ∼105.2-fold (IC50 = 0.39 versus 41.01 μg/ml) lower than that of SMMC-7721, whereas their IC50 to each of the remaining therapeutics differed little (Fig. 1, B and C). HepG2 was the second 5-FU-sensitive HCC cell line (IC50 = 1.45 μg/ml, 27.3-fold lower than SMMC-7721; supplemental Fig. S1A) in this group, with the other five members even more resistant to 5-FU than SMMC-7721 (the data of four cell lines are shown in supplemental Fig. S1B). Therefore, the genomic profiling at both DNA methylation and miR expression levels was carried out in both QGY-7703 and SMMC-7721 for the DNA methylation regulated miRs having a key role in the 5-FU resistance of HCC cells. Among 39 differentially expressed miRs that were identified by a Solexa sequencing-miRomic analysis, 4K. Ma, Y. He, H. Zhang, Q. Fei, D. Niu, D. Wang, X. Ding, H. Xu, X. Chen, and J. Zhu, unpublished observation. miR-193a-3p was one of the most differentially expressed between SMMC-7721 and QGY-7703: 11.21-fold higher in former than in the latter by Solexa sequencing (Fig. 1D) and 4.44-fold higher by qRT-PCR-based validation (Fig. 1E). The miR-193a-3p level was also low in another 5-FU-sensitive HCC cell line, HepG2 (the second 5-FU-sensitive cell line), but high in all other 5-FU-resistant cell lines: PLC, FOCUS, Hep3B, and BEL-7402 (supplemental Fig. S1C). We also established the methylomic profiles of both cell lines by probing a customized Nimblegene 0.38 million oligonucleotide CpG island array with the heavily methylated DNA fraction from a methylated DNA-binding domain-based capture procedure (28.Brinkman A.B. Simmer F. Ma K. Kaan A. Zhu J. Stunnenberg H.G. Whole-genome DNA methylation profiling using MethylCap-seq.Methods. 2010; 52: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The miR-193a gene was at the top of the most differentially methylated CpG islands (>3000)4: hypermethylated in QGY-7703 and hypomethylated in SMMC-7721 (methylation index, +1.22 versus −2.35; Fig. 1F), negatively correlating with the miR-193a-3p expression. We further determined the methylation state of the miR-193a gene by BSP and MSP of these two HCC cell lines and the other five HCC cell lines and showed that miR-193a was hypermethylated in both 5-FU-sensitive cell lines (HepG2 and QGY-7703) but unmethylated or barely methylated in all five of the 5-FU-resistant cell lines, including SMMC-7721 (supplemental Fig. S1, D–F). The DNA methylation state dependence of miR-193a transcription was finally confirmed by showing that 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine-mediated demethylation raised the steady state level of miR-193a-3p in QGY-7703 (supplemental Fig. S2). It is evident that the 5-FU sensitivity of HCC is tightly linked to the DNA methylation-regulated miR-193a-3p expression in HCC. To determine whether differentially expressed miR-193a-3p do have a functional impact, we transfected both cell lines with each of three luciferase reporter constructs: CMV-luc (empty vector control) and its derivatives miR-193a-3p-luc (the testing construct) and miR-127-luc (a nonspecific control). The latter two have each of the cognate target sequences inserted at the 3′-end of the luciferase genes, respectively (Fig. 2A). Correlating well with the level of miR-193a-3p, in comparison with each of other reporter, the luciferase activity of the transfected miR-193a-luc was no more than 0.29-fold in SMMC-7721 (a miR-193a-3p high expressing cell line) (Fig. 2B), but was similar in QGY-7703 (a miR-193a-3p low expressing cell line) (Fig. 2C). To identify the target gene(s), expression of which is repressed by miR-193a-3p at the post-transcriptional level, we performed Western blot analysis of 10 proteins in both HCC cell lines. The following five proteins were selected from 141 bioinformatically predicted miR-193a-3p target genes (see the TargetScan and EMBL-EBI Web sites): E2F transcription factor 1 (E2F1), E2F transcription factor 6 (E2F6), tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein, ζ-polypeptide (YWHAZ), serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 2 (SRSF2), and myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (BCL2-related; MCL1). We also selected thymidylate synthetase for its role in 5-FU metabolism, protein-tyrosine kinase 2 (PTK2) for its role in cell motility and survival, histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) for its involvement in protein acetylation regulation, and both proliferating cell nuclear antigen and CDC5 cell division cycle 5-like (CDC5L) for their functional coupling with SRSF2 that is suggested bioinformatically (see the FunCoup Web site). Both SRSF2 and E2F1 (0.02 versus 1 and 0.31 versus 1, respectively; Fig. 2D) but none of the others tested have the expected pattern for a bona fide target of miR-193a-3p (i.e. low in the miR-193a-3p high expressing SMMC-7721 and high in the miR-193a-3p low expressing QGY-7703). Both mRNA levels were also lower in SMMC-7721 than in QGY-7703 (2 − ΔΔCt of SMMC-7721/QGY-7703, 0.56 for SRSF2 and 0.48 for E2F1; Fig. 2E), in contrast to a similar level of a non-miR-193a-3p target: ATP-binding cassette, subfamily C (CFTR/MRP), member 8 (ABCC8) (1.14; Fig. 2E). Taken together, the miR-193a-3p regulation of HCC sensitivity to 5-FU is probably achieved by its regulation of both SRSF2 and E2F1 expression at both mRNA stability and translation levels. The lack of an intercellular difference in thymidylate synthetase level suggested that the 5-FU metabolistic process may not impact the 5-FU resistance of HCC cells in this study. We raised the miR-193a-3p level by the mimic transfection and found that 1) the luciferase activity of miR-193a-3p-luc was reduced to 0.21-fold (Fig. 3A), and 2) both E2F1 and SRSF2 proteins went down to 0.47- and 0.24-fold, respectively, of the mock mimic-transfected levels in QGY-7703 (Fig. 3C). We then reduced the miR-193a-3p level by the antagomir transfection and found 1) the luciferase activity of the miR-193a-3p-luc up to 2.43-fold (Fig. 3B) and 2) the level of both E2F1 and SRSF2 up to 1.84- and 2.47-fold, respectively, of the mock antagomir transfected levels in SMMC-7721 (Fig. 3C). Neither MCL1 nor HDAC (non-target proteins) protein levels were affected by the same treatments (Fig. 3C). The changes of SRSF2 and E2F1 mRNAs but not ABCC8 mRN"
https://openalex.org/W1984283750,"Mitotic cell division is controlled by cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks), which phosphorylate hundreds of protein substrates responsible for executing the division program. Cdk inactivation and reversal of Cdk-catalyzed phosphorylation are universal requirements for completing and exiting mitosis and resetting the cell cycle machinery. Mechanisms that define the timing and order of Cdk substrate dephosphorylation remain poorly understood. Cdc14 phosphatases have been implicated in Cdk inactivation and are thought to be generally specific for Cdk-type phosphorylation sites. We show that budding yeast Cdc14 possesses a strong and unusual preference for phosphoserine over phosphothreonine at Pro-directed sites in vitro. Using serine to threonine substitutions in the Cdk consensus sites of the Cdc14 substrate Acm1, we demonstrate that phosphoserine specificity exists in vivo. Furthermore, it appears to be a conserved property of all Cdc14 family phosphatases. An invariant active site residue was identified that sterically restricts phosphothreonine binding and is largely responsible for phosphoserine selectivity. Optimal Cdc14 substrates also possessed a basic residue at the +3 position relative to the phosphoserine, whereas substrates lacking this basic residue were not effectively hydrolyzed. The intrinsic selectivity of Cdc14 may help establish the order of Cdk substrate dephosphorylation during mitotic exit and contribute to roles in other cellular processes."

https://openalex.org/W2054218371,"Estrogens promote bone health in part by increasing osteocyte survival, an effect that requires activation of the protein kinases Akt and ERK1/2, but the molecular mechanisms involved are only partly understood. Because estrogens increase nitric oxide (NO) synthesis and NO can have anti-apoptotic effects, we examined the role of NO/cGMP signaling in estrogen regulation of osteocyte survival. Etoposide-induced death of MLO-Y4 osteocyte-like cells, assessed by trypan blue staining, caspase-3 cleavage, and TUNEL assays, was completely prevented when cells were pre-treated with 17β-estradiol. This protective effect was mimicked when cells were pre-treated with a membrane-permeable cGMP analog and blocked by pharmacological inhibitors of NO synthase, soluble guanylate cyclase, or cGMP-dependent protein kinases (PKGs), supporting a requirement for NO/cGMP/PKG signaling downstream of 17β-estradiol. siRNA-mediated knockdown and viral reconstitution of individual PKG isoforms demonstrated that the anti-apoptotic effects of estradiol and cGMP were mediated by PKG Iα and PKG II. Akt and ERK1/2 activation by 17β-estradiol required PKG II, and cGMP mimicked the effects of estradiol on Akt and ERK, including induction of ERK nuclear translocation. cGMP induced BAD phosphorylation on several sites, and experiments with phosphorylation-deficient BAD mutants demonstrated that the anti-apoptotic effects of cGMP and 17β-estradiol required BAD phosphorylation on Ser(136) and Ser(155); these sites were targeted by Akt and PKG I, respectively, and regulate BAD interaction with Bcl-2. In conclusion, 17β-estradiol protects osteocytes against apoptosis by activating the NO/cGMP/PKG cascade; PKG II is required for estradiol-induced activation of ERK and Akt, and PKG Iα contributes to pro-survival signaling by directly phosphorylating BAD."

To investigate whether such circuits can be functionally reconstituted by synaptic integration of similarly diverse populations of neurons, we generated physically chimeric hypothalami by microtransplanting small numbers of embryonic enhanced green fluorescent protein-expressing, leptin-responsive hypothalamic cells into hypothalami of postnatal leptin receptor-deficient (db/db) mice that develop morbid obesity. Donor neurons differentiated and integrated as four distinct hypothalamic neuron subtypes, formed functional excitatory and inhibitory synapses, partially restored leptin responsiveness, and ameliorated hyperglycemia and obesity in db/db mice. These experiments serve as a proof of concept that transplanted neurons can functionally reconstitute complex neuronal circuitry in the mammalian brain."
https://openalex.org/W2076960531,"The RNA-binding protein, CUG-binding protein 1 (CUGBP1), regulates gene expression at the levels of alternative splicing, mRNA degradation, and translation. We used RNA immunoprecipitation followed by microarray analysis to identify the cytoplasmic mRNA targets of CUGBP1 in resting and activated primary human T cells and found that CUGBP1 targets were highly enriched for the presence of GU-rich elements (GREs) in their 3'-untranslated regions. The number of CUGBP1 target transcripts decreased dramatically following T cell activation as a result of activation-dependent phosphorylation of CUGBP1 and decreased ability of CUGBP1 to bind to GRE-containing RNA. A large percentage of CUGBP1 target transcripts exhibited rapid and transient up-regulation, and a smaller percentage exhibited transient down-regulation following T cell activation. Many of the transiently up-regulated CUGBP1 target transcripts encode important regulatory proteins necessary for transition from a quiescent state to a state of cellular activation and proliferation. Overall, our results show that CUGBP1 binding to certain GRE-containing target transcripts decreased following T cell activation through activation-dependent phosphorylation of CUGBP1."
https://openalex.org/W2077623887,"Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a major threat to the successful outcome of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), although individual risk varies considerably. Recent evidence has established a pivotal role for a danger sensing mechanism implicating the S100B/receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) axis in antifungal immunity. The association of selected genetic variants in the S100B/RAGE axis with susceptibility to IA was investigated in 223 consecutive patients undergoing HSCT. Furthermore, studies addressing the functional consequences of these variants were performed. Susceptibility to IA was significantly associated with two distinct polymorphisms in RAGE (-374T/A) and S100B (+427C/T) genes, the relative contribution of each depended on their presence in both transplantation counterparts [patient SNP(RAGE), adjusted hazard ratio (HR), 1.97; P = 0.042 and donor SNP(RAGE), HR, 2.03; P = 0.047] or in donors (SNP(S100B), HR, 3.15; P = 7.8e-(4)) only, respectively. Functional assays demonstrated a gain-of-function phenotype of both variants, as shown by the enhanced expression of inflammatory cytokines in RAGE polymorphic cells and increased S100B secretion in vitro and in vivo in the presence of the S100B polymorphism. These findings point to a relevant role of the danger sensing signaling in human antifungal immunity and highlight a possible contribution of a genetically-determined hyperfunction of the S100B/RAGE axis to susceptibility to IA in the HSCT setting."

https://openalex.org/W2001566604,"Obesity and insulin resistance are associated with chronic, low grade inflammation. Moreover, regulation of energy metabolism and immunity are highly integrated. We hypothesized that energy-sensitive coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1-α (PGC-1α) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) may modulate inflammatory gene expression in liver. Microarray analysis revealed that PGC-1α up-regulated expression of several cytokines and cytokine receptors, including interleukin 15 receptor α (IL15Rα) and, even more importantly, anti-inflammatory interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL1Rn). Overexpression of PGC-1α and induction of PGC-1α by fasting, physical exercise, glucagon, or cAMP was associated with increased IL1Rn mRNA and protein expression in hepatocytes. Knockdown of PGC-1α by siRNA down-regulated cAMP-induced expression of IL1Rn in mouse hepatocytes. Furthermore, knockdown of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) attenuated IL1Rn induction by PGC-1α. Overexpression of PGC-1α, at least partially through IL1Rn, suppressed interleukin 1β-induced expression of acute phase proteins, C-reactive protein, and haptoglobin. Fasting and exercise also induced IL15Rα expression, whereas glucagon and cAMP resulted in reduction in IL15Rα mRNA levels. Finally, AMPK activator metformin and adenoviral overexpression of AMPK up-regulated IL1Rn and down-regulated IL15Rα in primary hepatocytes. We conclude that PGC-1α and AMPK alter inflammatory gene expression in liver and thus integrate energy homeostasis and inflammation. Induction of IL1Rn by PGC-1α and AMPK may be involved in the beneficial effects of exercise and caloric restriction and putative anti-inflammatory effects of metformin."
https://openalex.org/W2006091414,"Resistance to cisplatin (CDDP)-based therapy is a major hurdle to the successful treatment of human ovarian cancer (OVCA), and the chemoresistant phenotype in OVCA cells is associated with Akt-attenuated p53-mediated apoptosis. Pro-apoptotic functions of p53 involve both transcription-dependent and -independent signaling pathways, and dysfunctional localization and/or inactivation of p53 contribute to the development of chemoresistance. PARC is a cytoplasmic protein regulating p53 subcellular localization and subsequent function. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms regulating PARC. Although PARC contains putative caspase-3 cleavage sites, and CDDP is known to induce the activation of caspases and calpains and induce proteasomal degradation of anti-apoptotic proteins, if and how PARC is regulated by CDDP in OVCA are unknown. Here, we present evidence that CDDP promotes calpain-mediated PARC down-regulation, mitochondrial and nuclear p53 accumulation, and apoptosis in chemosensitive but not resistant OVCA cells. Inhibition of Akt is required to sensitize chemoresistant cells to CDDP in a p53-dependent manner, an effect enhanced by PARC down-regulation. CDDP-induced PARC down-regulation is reversible by inhibition of calpain but not of caspases or the 26 S proteasome. Furthermore, in vitro experiments confirm the ability of calpain in mediating Ca(2+)-dependent PARC down-regulation. The role of Ca(2+) in PARC down-regulation was further confirmed as ionomycin-induced PARC down-regulation in both chemosensitive and chemoresistant ovarian cancer cells. The data presented here implicate the regulation of p53 subcellular localization and apoptosis by PARC as a contributing factor in CDDP resistance in OVCA cells and Ca(2+)/calpain in PARC post-translational processing and chemosensitivity."

https://openalex.org/W1997488451,"Microtubule nucleation is an essential step in the formation of the microtubule cytoskeleton. We recently showed that androgen and Src promote microtubule nucleation and γ-tubulin accumulation at the centrosome. Here, we explore the mechanisms by which androgen and Src regulate these processes and ask whether integrins play a role. We perturb integrin function by a tyrosine-to-alanine substitution in membrane-proximal NPIY motif in the integrin β1 tail and show that this mutant substantially decreases microtubule nucleation and γ-tubulin accumulation at the centrosome. Because androgen stimulation promotes the interaction of the androgen receptor with Src, resulting in PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK signaling, we asked whether these pathways are inhibited by the mutant integrin and whether they regulate microtubule nucleation. Our results indicate that the formation of the androgen receptor-Src complex and the activation of downstream pathways are significantly suppressed when cells are adhered by the mutant integrin. Inhibitor studies indicate that microtubule nucleation requires MEK/ERK but not PI3K/AKT signaling. Importantly, the expression of activated RAF-1 is sufficient to rescue microtubule nucleation inhibited by the mutant integrin by promoting the centrosomal accumulation of γ-tubulin. Our data define a novel paradigm of integrin signaling, where integrins regulate microtubule nucleation by promoting the formation of androgen receptor-Src signaling complexes to activate the MEK/ERK signaling pathway."

Streptococcus pyogenes (or group A streptococcus), a Gram-positive bacterium infecting only humans, is a common colonizer of the upper respiratory tract and the skin where it causes relatively mild and superficial clinical conditions such as pharyngitis and impetigo (1Cunningham M.W. Pathogenesis of group A streptococcal infections.Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2000; 13: 470-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1769) Google Scholar). However, the morbidity and the costs for society of these infections are highly significant, and a study funded by the WHO in 2005 reported that S. pyogenes annually causes over 600 million cases of pharyngitis and 111 million cases of skin infections worldwide (2Carapetis J.R. Steer A.C. Mulholland E.K. Weber M. The global burden of group A streptococcal diseases.Lancet Infect. Dis. 2005; 5: 685-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2012) Google Scholar). Apart from these common and mostly uncomplicated infections, the bacterium is responsible for severe invasive and potentially life-threatening conditions such as necrotizing fasciitis and sepsis, and acute rheumatic fever following S. pyogenes throat or skin infections is the most frequent cause of heart disease in children. The study mentioned above reported that at least 517,000 deaths occur each year due to these conditions, emphasizing that S. pyogenes is one of the most significant bacterial pathogens in the human population. A better understanding of the biology of S. pyogenes and its interactions with the human host is required to identify novel prophylactic, diagnostic, and treatment opportunities to reduce the global burden of S. pyogenes diseases. Several virulence factors that promote S. pyogenes colonization, immune evasion, and spread have been identified (for reviews, see Refs. 1Cunningham M.W.

A characteristic property of S. pyogenes is its capacity to induce a powerful inflammatory response leading to vascular leakage at the site of infection. In this situation, and if the bacterium invades the vasculature, it will be exposed to plasma and its constituents. S. pyogenes expresses a number of surface proteins that bind several of the most abundant plasma proteins (albumin, fibrinogen, IgG, proteins of the complement and contact systems, etc.) with high affinity and specificity, underlining the intense molecular interplay between the pathogen and human plasma. These interactions could influence the gene expression in S. pyogenes with implications for bacterial adaptation and virulence, a notion supported by findings that a subset of S. pyogenes virulence proteins change their abundance levels upon contact with plasma (6Lange V.

Supplements were added at the following concentrations: 1, 5, 10, or 20% (v/v) citrated human plasma (Lund University Hospital), 4 mg/ml of HSA (Sigma), 4 mg/ml of essentially fatty acid free (∼0.005%) HSA (Sigma), 0.3 mg/ml of human fibrinogen (Sigma), or 1.2 mg/ml of human IgG (Sigma). Cells were harvested at mid-exponential phase (A620 nm = 0.5) by centrifugation, washed three times in ice-cold PBS (this will remove secreted proteins), and re-suspended in sterile ice-cold water. To isolate intracellular bacterial proteins, the samples were homogenized in a cell disruptor (FastPrep FP120, Savant Machines Inc.) three times for 20 s at level 6. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g and the homogenates were diluted in 200 mm Tris, pH 8.3, containing 6 m urea, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.2% Triton X-100. With this procedure the homogenates will contain the intracellular protein pool but also the fraction of cell wall proteins and plasma proteins bound to the bacterial surface that is released during the homogenization procedure. The protein concentration was determined using the Bradford reagent (Sigma), and the homogenates were subjected to reversed phase LC-MS/MS analysis. The hybrid LTQ-FT-ICR mass spectrometer (Thermo Finnigan) was interfaced to a nanoelectrospray ion source. Chromatographic separation of peptides was achieved on an Agilent Series 1100 LC system (Agilent Technologies) equipped with a 11-cm fused silica emitter, 100-μm inner diameter (BGB Analytik), packed in-house with a Magic C18 AQ 5-μm resin (Michrom BioResources). Peptides were separated by a 65-min linear gradient of 5 to 40% acetonitrile in water, containing 0.1% formic acid, with a flow rate of 0.95 μl/min. Three MS/MS spectra were acquired in the linear ion trap per each FT-MS scan, which was acquired at 100,000 FWHM nominal resolution settings with an overall cycle time of ∼1 s. Charge state screening was employed to select for ions with at least two charges and rejecting ions with undetermined charge state. The hybrid Orbitrap-LTQ XL mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron, Bremen, Germany) was coupled online to a split-less Eksigent Two-dimensional NanoLC system (Eksigent Technologies, Dublin, CA). Peptides were loaded with a constant flow rate of 10 μl/min onto a pre-column (Zorbax 300SB-C18 5 × 0.3 mm, 5 μm, Agilent Technologies, Wilmington, DE) and subsequently separated on a RP-LC analytical column (Zorbax 300SB-C18 150 mm × 75 μm, 3.5 μm, Agilent Technologies) with a flow rate of 350 nl/min. The peptides were eluted with a linear gradient from 95% solvent A (0.1% formic acid in water) and 5% solvent B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) to 40% solvent B over 55 min. The mass spectrometer was operated in data-dependent mode to automatically switch between Orbitrap-MS (from m/z 400 to 2000) and LTQ-MS/MS acquisition. Four MS/MS spectra were acquired in the linear ion trap per each FT-MS scan, which was acquired at 60,000 FWHM nominal resolution settings using the lock mass option (m/z 445.120025) for internal calibration. The dynamic exclusion list was restricted to 500 entries using a repeat count of two with a repeat duration of 20 s and with a maximum retention period of 120 s. Precursor ion charge state screening was enabled to select for ions with at least two charges and rejecting ions with undetermined charge state. The normalized collision energy was set to 30%, and one microscan was acquired for each spectrum. The resulting MS/MS data were deposited in the peptide atlas. Identified peptides with high probability from FAB proteins were synthesized (JPT Technologies, Berlin, Germany) and the SRM transition lists were generated using a previously published method (10Picotti P.

The SRM measurements were performed on a TSQ Vantage triple quadropole mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron, Bremen, Germany) equipped with a nanoelectrospray ion source (Thermo Electron). Chromatographic separations of peptides were performed on an Eksigent One-dimensional NanoLC system (Eksigent Technologies) using the same chromatographic conditions as described above for the Eksigent Two-dimensional NanoLC system connected to the hybrid Orbitrap-LTQ XL mass spectrometer. The LC was operated with a flow rate of 400 nl/min. The mass spectrometer was operated in SRM mode, with both Q1 and Q3 settings at unit resolution (FWHM 0.7 Da). A spray voltage of +1700 V was used with a heated ion transfer setting of 270 °C for desolvation. Data were acquired using the Xcalibur software (version 2.1.0). The dwell time was set to 10 ms and the scan width to 0.01 m/z. All collision energies were calculated using the formula: CE = (parent m/z) × 0.034 + 3.314.

Kohlbacher O. OpenMS, an open-source software framework for mass spectrometry.BMC Bioinformatics. 2008; 9: 163Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Unless indicated otherwise, TOPP tools (17Kohlbacher O. Reinert K. Gröpl C. Lange E. Pfeifer N. Schulz-Trieglaff O. Sturm M. TOPP. The OpenMS proteomics pipeline.Bioinformatics. 2007; 23: e191-e197Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), small applications provided by OpenMS, were used for the individual processing steps. The input to the analysis pipeline consisted of 10-mzXML files containing LC-MS/MS data acquired on the LTQ-FTICR instrument in profile mode. These files were first converted to mzML format with the FileConverter tool, then centroided using the PeakPicker (“high_res” algorithm). These two steps were carried out in OpenMS 1.6; for the following steps, an early (January 2010) development version of OpenMS 1.7 was used. On the centroided mzML files, feature detection was performed using the FeatureFinder (“centroided” algorithm), producing one feature map per sample. In parallel, results from the MS2 identification pipeline were preprocessed with a custom Python script and split into individual pepXML files (one per sample and search engine). Peptide identification data from these files was read, filtered to 1% FDR, and stored in OpenMS′ idXML format (one file per sample) by a custom C++ program built on top of the OpenMS library (release version of OpenMS 1.7). To annotate the feature maps with identified peptides, the IDMapper tool was applied to the pairs of feature maps/idXML files derived from the same sample. The resulting annotated feature maps were adjusted to a common retention time scale with MapAligner (“identification” algorithm), then combined into one consensus map by grouping features across samples with the FeatureLinker (“unlabeled” algorithm). The consensus map was converted to a table in CSV format using the TextExporter. A custom R script was used to read the quantification data from the CSV file, clean up annotation conflicts, and compute peptide abundances from the intensities of annotated features. To reduce the impact of feature detection differences in the individual samples, only the charge state with the highest intensity per peptide was used for quantification. The resulting peptide abundances were exported into a data base, where protein abundances were inferred by summing up the abundances for the peptides uniquely mapping to each protein (18Malmström L. Marko-Varga G. Westergren-Thorsson G. Laurell T. Malmström J. 2DDB. A bioinformatics solution for analysis of quantitative proteomics data.BMC Bioinformatics. 2006; 7: 158Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The quantitative data from openMS was normalized using the total ion current from each LC/MS experiment that could be assigned to S. pyogenes and then organized in a matrix with proteins as rows and conditions (e.g. % plasma) as columns. The three first principle components resulting from applying principle component analysis (19Venables W.N. Ripley B.D. Chambers J. Eddy W. Hārdle W. Sheater S. Tierney L. Modern Applied Statistics with S. 4 Ed. Springer, New York2002Crossref Google Scholar) to the matrix were used to cluster the proteins using k-mean clustering (20Hartigan J.A. Wong M.A. A k-means clustering algorithm.Appl. Statist. 1979; 28: 100-108Crossref Google Scholar) always performed in R (version 2.9.0). One vial of the BODIPY-FA probe from the QBT Fatty Acid Uptake Assay Kit (Molecular Devices) was mixed with 1 ml of 20 mg/ml of HSA-FA in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. The probe-HSA complex was added 1/10 (v/v) to S. pyogenes wild type (AP1) and mga mutant AP1 bacteria grown to A620 nm = 0.15 in TH broth. Triplicate samples of either living or heat-killed (80 °C, 5 min) bacteria containing probe-HSA complex were further incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2. At time points 0, 40, 80, and 120 min, a small aliquot of the samples were removed and placed on ice. Bacteria were labeled using IVIG (polyclonal human therapeutic IgG, 5 min, 500 μg/ml) and DyLight 649-conjugated goat anti-human F(ab′)2 fragments (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 5 min, 1:100) on ice. Acquisition of images was performed using a fluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse TE300 equipped with a Hamamatsu C4742–95 cooled CCD camera, using a Plan Apochromat ×100 objective with NA 1.4). Images were acquired with identical exposure time (NIS Elements 3, Nikon) and have been processed with linear brightness and contrast adjustments (Adobe Photoshop CS5) to represent the samples as they were observed in the microscope. The flow cytometry measurements were performed using a FacsCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) equipped with lasers tuned to 488 and 633 nm. Bacteria were gated using forward and side scatter in the logarithmic mode and bound IgG (DyLight 649-labeled) was detected in the FL4 channel. Fluorescence from the BODIPY-FA probe was collected in the FL1 channel. Adapting to human plasma is a critical ability for S. pyogenes with implication for pathogenesis and virulence. Human plasma is a complex mixture of proteins and nutrients constituting on one hand a rich medium for the bacterium, and on the other hand a source of host defense systems. In the adaptation process, the type and amount of proteins synthesized is tightly regulated to create a composition that is optimized to cope with the new environment. To study this process, mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics was used to identify and quantify the intracellular protein constituent of the S. pyogenes-translated genome. S. pyogenes (strain SF370 of the M1 serotype) was grown in TH medium supplemented with different amounts of human plasma (0, 1, 5, 10, and 20%) in two biological replicates. Following centrifugation and washing, the bacteria were homogenized. Resulting debris was spun down and proteins of the supernatants were digested to peptides and analyzed using LC-MS/MS. To maximize the number of identified proteins we extensively annotated the detected peptides using the combined outputs of multiple search engines at a stringent false-discovery rate. An analysis pipeline based on the OpenMS software framework (16Sturm M. Bertsch A. Gröpl C. Hildebrandt A. Hussong R. Lange E. Pfeifer N. Schulz-Trieglaff O. Zerck A. Reinert K. Kohlbacher O. OpenMS, an open-source software framework for mass spectrometry.BMC Bioinformatics. 2008; 9: 163Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar) was then used to quantitatively compare the LC-MS peptide patterns from different samples resulting in an extensive quantification matrix for the S. pyogenes proteins. In this experiment, 523 S. pyogenes proteins (supplemental Table S2) were identified and quantified with an estimated false discovery rate of 5% using a reversed data base search strategy (15Elias J.E. Gygi S.P. Target-decoy search strategy for increased confidence in large-scale protein identifications by mass spectrometry.Nat. Methods. 2007; 4: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (2873) Google Scholar) and Protein and PeptideProphet (21Keller A. Nesvizhskii A.I. Kolker E. Aebersold R.

Chem. 2002; 74: 5383-5392Crossref PubMed Scopus (3912) Google Scholar, 22Nesvizhskii A.I. Keller A. Kolker E. Aebersold R. A statistical model for identifying proteins by tandem mass spectrometry.Anal. Chem. 2003; 75: 4646-4658Crossref PubMed Scopus (3655) Google Scholar). The data indicate that S. pyogenes regulates its proteome composition in a dose-dependent manner upon exposure to increasing amounts of plasma (Fig. 1), first demonstrated by using principle component analysis revealing the degree of proteome reorganization. This analysis suggests that there is a small difference in protein abundance between bacteria grown in 0 or 1% plasma, whereas the proteome of bacteria grown in 10 or 20% plasma was considerably different compared with bacteria grown in medium without plasma (Fig. 1F). Cultures grown in 5% plasma display an intermediate profile. In a second stage, the protein abundance profiles were split, using k-mean clustering, into five clusters containing the distinguishing proteins as shown in Fig. 1. The predominant cluster contains the proteins that remain constant at the plasma concentrations tested (Fig. 1A). Two clusters represent the proteins with decreasing protein abundances (Fig. 1, B and C), and two contain the proteins with increasing or fluctuating protein abundances (Fig. 1, D and E). Sixty-one proteins observed in less than four of the five growth conditions were excluded, as these proteins are present at a too low concentration to allow accurate clustering. The clustered data reveal that there are a large number of proteins that either increase or decrease in protein abundance. The largest cluster, 246 proteins (46%), contains the proteins that remain constant at the different plasma concentrations (Fig. 1G, label A), followed by the cluster containing 155 proteins (30%) where the protein abundances were decreased (Fig. 1G, labels B and C). A lower number of proteins, 58 proteins (11%), showed increased abundance (Fig. 1G, labels D and E) (supplemental Table S1 lists the proteins that were mostly influenced by plasma). However, the number of proteins that change their abundance does not necessarily reflect the degree of proteome adaptation. The disproportional amount of proteins of the cluster in Fig. 1A becomes more apparent when the total ion intensities for proteins in the respective cluster are summed up and compared with the protein count (Fig. 1H). Total ion intensities represent the recorded signal intensities for the peptides associated with a protein in the mass spectrometer, and provide a rough estimate of protein abundance (8Malmström J.

Absolute protein expression profiling estimates the relative contributions of transcriptional and translational regulation.Nat. Biotechnol. 2007; 25: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). The cluster in Fig. 1A can be ascribed to 89% of the ion intensities, which indicates that the abundance level for the majority of the intracellular proteins remains constant. Only 9% of ion intensities represent the proteins with decreased protein abundances (Fig. 1H, labels A and B), and 2% of the ion intensities are ascribed to proteins that increase (Fig. 1H, labels D and E). The large over-representation of the proteins with unchanged abundance indicates that the overall proteome reorganization is relatively modest in response to human plasma. Even though a considerable number of proteins change in concentration they tend to be present at relatively low amounts compared with the proteins that remain constant. There are almost three times as many proteins that display decreased protein abundances compared with those that are increased (155 versus 58), and the difference in ion intensities is close to 5-fold (9 versus 2%). The results indicate that a number of proteins become dispensable for S. pyogenes growing in plasma. It should be noted that proteins secreted by the bacteria are lost during the washing step, and despite low intracellular abundance they could be present in high amounts in the growth medium. Hypothetically, the proteins that are repressed or induced belong to certain functional categories that could reflect how the bacteria adapt to the new environment. To allow visualization of the complicated expression profile data we used Cytoscape (27Shannon P. Markiel A. Ozier O. Baliga N.S. Wang J.T. Ramage D. Amin N. Schwikowski B. Ideker T. Cytoscape.

The clamp tethers DNA polymerases to DNA to increase the processivity of synthesis as well as the efficiency of replication. Here, we investigated proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) binding and opening by the Saccharomyces cerevisiae clamp loader, replication factor C (RFC), and the DNA damage checkpoint clamp loader, Rad24-RFC, using two separate fluorescence intensity-based assays. Analysis of PCNA opening by RFC revealed a two-step reaction in which RFC binds PCNA before opening PCNA rather than capturing clamps that have transiently and spontaneously opened in solution. The affinity of RFC for PCNA is about an order of magnitude lower in the absence of ATP than in its presence. The affinity of Rad24-RFC for PCNA in the presence of ATP is about an order magnitude weaker than that of RFC for PCNA, similar to the RFC-PCNA interaction in the absence of ATP. Importantly, fewer open clamp loader-clamp complexes are formed when PCNA is bound by Rad24-RFC than when bound by RFC."

We demonstrated recently that Hed1, a meiosis-specific protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, restricts the access of the recombinase accessory factor Rad54 to presynaptic filaments of Rad51. We now show that Hed1 undergoes self-association in a Rad51-dependent manner and binds ssDNA. We also find a strong stabilizing effect of Hed1 on the Rad51 presynaptic filament.

The catalytically active form of these recombinases comprises a right-handed protein polymer on ssDNA.

Genetic studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae have furnished evidence for the existence of two distinct meiotic recombination pathways, with one being dependent on Rad51 alone (Rad51-only pathway) and the other on both Rad51 and Dmc1 (Dmc1-dependent pathway) (14Tsubouchi H. Roeder G.S. The importance of genetic recombination for fidelity of chromosome pairing in meiosis.Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 915-925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The coordinated action of Rad51 and Dmc1 in the Dmc1-dependent pathway is required to achieve the optimal level of interhomolog crossovers (4Sheridan S. Bishop D.K.

Both rad51Δ and dmc1Δ mutants exhibit defects in the repair of meiotic DSBs (15Rockmill B. Sym M. Scherthan H. Roeder G.S.

However, Rad51 overexpression overcomes the sporulation defect and spore inviability in dmc1Δ cells (14Tsubouchi H. Roeder G.S.

This observation and the fact that Rad51 alone is well capable of catalyzing efficient recombination in vegetative cells suggest that the activity of Rad51 is specifically down-regulated in meiosis, so as to ensure the proper level of Dmc1-dependent interhomolog recombination (4Sheridan S.

The meiosis-specific Red1/Hop1/Mek1 protein complex, associated with the axial elements of meiotic chromosomes, has been shown to attenuate inter-sister recombination that is primarily mediated by Rad51 (16Bishop D.K.

Weiner B.M. Kleckner N. Meiotic cells monitor the status of the interhomolog recombination complex.Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 106-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Mutations that compromise the functional integrity of this complex thus lower the frequency of meiotic inter-homolog crossovers and impair chromosome disjunction. A genetic screen for multi-copy suppressors of a hypomorphic red1 mutant allele, red1–22, identified a novel meiosis-specific factor, HED1 (high-copy suppressor of red1). Deletion of HED1 efficiently overcomes the sporulation and DSB repair defects caused by the dmc1Δ mutation, akin to RAD51 overexpression. Likewise, HED1 deletion alleviates the meiotic defects of the hop2Δ mutant. These suppressor attributes of the HED1 deletion are dependent on Rad51. Thus, Hed1 attenuates the Rad51-only HR pathway in meiotic cells. In fact expression of Hed1 in vegetative cells leads to sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents such as methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) due to suppression of Rad51-mediated DNA repair. Hed1 associates with Rad51 (but not with Dmc1) and is targeted to meiotic DSBs in a Rad51-dependent manner (17Tsubouchi H. Roeder G.S. Budding yeast Hed1 down-regulates the mitotic recombination machinery when meiotic recombination is impaired.Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 1766-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). By studying biochemical properties of purified Hed1 in combination with chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), we found that Hed1 does not interfere with Rad51 presynaptic filament assembly but it restricts access of the Swi2/Snf2-related motor protein Rad54 to the Rad51 presynaptic filament. Consequently, Hed1 prevents functional synergy between Rad54 and the Rad51 presynaptic filament in the HR reaction (20Busygina V. Sehorn M.G. Shi I.Y. Tsubouchi H. Roeder G.S. Sung P. Hed1 regulates Rad51-mediated recombination via a novel mechanism.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 786-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The importance of attenuating Rad51-Rad54 complex activity during meiotic recombination is underscored by the recent finding that phosphorylation of Rad54 on threonine 132 by the meiosis-specific kinase Mek1 reduces the affinity of Rad54 for Rad51. Companion genetic analysis has revealed that the Mek1-mediated regulation of the Rad51-Rad54 complex acts in parallel with the Hed1 regulatory pathway (21Niu H. Wan L. Busygina V. Kwon Y. Allen J.A.

Through the isolation of hed1 mutants selectively impaired for the various functional attributes and their biochemical and genetic analyses, we are able to explain how this HR regulator fulfills its biological role. Our results shed light on how budding yeast cells achieve meiotic HR control to favor crossover formation via the Dmc1-dependent pathway. Yeast strains used are listed in supplemental Table S1.

All of the plasmids were described previously (20Busygina V. Sehorn M.G. Shi I.Y. Tsubouchi H. Roeder G.S. Sung P. Hed1 regulates Rad51-mediated recombination via a novel mechanism.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 786-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Gene knock-out and integration of GAL1 promoter right before the HED1 ORF were done as previously described (22Longtine M.S. McKenzie 3rd, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Additional modules for versatile and economical PCR-based gene deletion and modification in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4193) Google Scholar). HED1 point mutants were introduced into yeast strains by using the pCORE cassette (23Storici F. Lewis L.K. Resnick M.A. In vivo site-directed mutagenesis using oligonucleotides.Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Specifically, nucleotides from 382 to 447 of the HED1 ORF (the first nucleotide of the first codon is one) were replaced with markers carrying both URA3 and KAN first. Then the strain was transformed with DNA fragments carrying mutated HED1 genes, selected for the loss of the URA3 and KAN markers by using 5-FOA plates, followed by checking G418 sensitivity. DNA fragments carrying mutated HED1 genes were PCR-amplified with the plasmids isolated from the yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screening (described below) as templates. The pOAD and pOBD2 plasmids (24Hudson Jr., J.R. Dawson E.P. Rushing K.L. Jackson C.H. Lockshon D. Conover D. Lanciault C. Harris J.R. Simmons S.J. Rothstein R. Fields S.

Expression of Hed1 was evaluated by Western blot with affinity purified rabbit polyclonal anti-Hed1 antibody raised against full-length recombinant Hed1. The DNA fragment carrying the HED1 ORF was randomly mutagenized by PCR and inserted between the PvuII and NcoI sites of the vector pOBD2 (24Hudson Jr., J.R. Dawson E.P. Rushing K.L. Jackson C.H.

The pool of PJ69–4A transformants carrying both a mutagenized HED1 gene in pOBD2 and either RAD51 gene or wild type HED1 gene in the vector pOAD were examined for the activation of the reporter genes ADE2 and HIS3. Clones that failed to or reduced the activation of these reporters were picked for further study. Plasmids were recovered from yeast and used to retransform the PJ69–4A strain along with pOAD-RAD51 or pOAD-HED1 to examine the reproducibility of the phenotypes. The recovered plasmids were sequenced to determine the mutation sites. To test mutagen sensitivity of the strains carrying galactose-inducible wild type or mutant Hed1 the following strains were used: TBR2182, 2164, 2168, 2170, 2172, and 4467. Overnight cultures in YP+3% glycerol media were diluted to 0.2 at OD660. 5-fold serial dilutions of each strain were spotted (5 μl) on YPD or YP-galactose plates containing indicated amounts of MMS or phleomycin (Sigma). To test mutagen sensitivity of the ChIP strains, JKM179 cells harboring the pTB326 vector with FLAG-tagged wild type or mutant Hed1 (see below) were grown in SC-Trp overnight, diluted (10-fold serial dilutions) in SC-Trp and spotted on SC-Trp plates containing the indicated amount of MMS. Expression and purification of wild type and mutant Hed1 proteins that were either tagged with (His)6 or with both GST and (His)6 were performed as described (20Busygina V. Sehorn M.G. Shi I.Y.

Wild type or mutant (His)6-tagged Hed1 (0.6, 0.8, 1.2, and 1.5 μm) was incubated with pBluescript SK viral (+) strand DNA (30 μm nucleotides) and pBluescript II SK (+) duplex DNA linearized with BamHI (30 μm base pairs) in buffer A (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 100 μg/ml BSA, 5 mm MgCl2) for 10 min at 37 °C. Where indicated, the reactions were de-proteinized with SDS (1% final concentration) and proteinase K (100 μg/ml final concentration). DNA species were resolved by electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel in TAE buffer (40 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA) and stained with ethidium bromide. Homology searches were performed using NCBI BLAST. Hed1 fragments were aligned with T4 endonuclease and HhoI sequences using the T-Coffee software (28Notredame C. Higgins D.G. Heringa J.

The filament stabilization assay was performed essentially as described (13Chi P. San Filippo J. Sehorn M.G. Petukhova G.V. Sung P. Bipartite stimulatory action of the Hop2-Mnd1 complex on the Rad51 recombinase.Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 1747-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) with several modifications. To assemble the presynaptic filament biotinylated 83-mer oligo dT (15 μm nucleotides) was incubated with Rad51 (3 μm) or RecA (supplemental Fig. S1C, 6 μm) and with or without wild type or mutant Hed1 (0.75, 1.25, 1.9, and 2.5 μm) in buffer A (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 100 μg/ml BSA, 5 mm MgCl2) supplemented with 2.5 mm ATP for 5 min at 37 °C. Then, 83-mer oligo dT (150 μm nucleotides) was added in 1 μl as Rad51 trap, followed by a 20-min incubation. After being mixed with 0.75 μl of Streptavidin magnetic beads (Roche) for 5 min, the Magnetic separator (NEB) was used to capture the beads. Proteins bound to the magnetic beads were eluted in 20 μl of 2% SDS. The supernatant and bead fractions were analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. To verify that the DNA trap remained in the supernatant, the supernatant and bead fractions were incubated with 100 μg/ml of proteinase K at 37 °C for 30 min and then analyzed in a 6% polyacrylamide gel in TBE (89 mm Tris, 89 mm boric acid, pH 8.3, 2 mm EDTA) followed by ethidium bromide staining of DNA. The experiment to examine whether Hed1 stabilizes Rad51-dsDNA filaments was performed as above, except that the streptavidin magnetic beads were coated with biotinylated dsDNA (5 μm base pairs; 600 bp pBluescript II SK (+) PCR product) and non-biotinylated dsDNA (50 μm base pairs; pBluescript II SK (+) DNA linearized with BamHI) was used as the Rad51 trap. Hed1 (60 μg) was analyzed in a 20 ml Sephacryl S-200 column equilibrated in buffer K (20 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.01% Igepal, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 500 mm KCl. Fractions (0.5 ml) were subjected to TCA precipitation followed by SDS-PAGE analysis in 12% polyacrylamide gels and staining with Coomassie Blue. SAXS data were collected at the ALS beamline 12.3.1 at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (30Hura G.L. Menon A.L. Hammel M. Rambo R.P. Poole 2nd, F.L. Tsutakawa S.E. Jenney Jr., F.E. Classen S.

Data were collected at a wavelength λ of 1.0 Å and sample-to-detector distances of 1.5 m, resulting in scattering vectors, q, ranging from 0.01 Å−1 to 0.31 Å−1. The scattering vector is defined as q = 4π sinθ/λ, where θ is the scattering angle. All experiments were performed at 20 °C and data were processed as described (30Hura G.L. Menon A.L. Hammel M.

Robust, high-throughput solution structural analyses by small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS).Nat. Methods. 2009; 6: 606-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). Briefly, data were acquired at short and long time exposure (0.5 s, 5 s) for both protein, at a concentration between 0.4 and 4 mg/ml, and relevant buffer. Scattering profiles were generated by subtracting buffer from protein exposures and analysis of Guinier plots (31Guinier A. Fournet G. Small-angle Scattering of X-rays. Wiley, New York1955Google Scholar) at the various protein concentrations showed no signs of aggregation. Data from short and long exposures were then merged to generate SAXS data that include the entire scattering spectrum, which were used for subsequent analyses. The radius of gyration Rg was derived by the Guinier approximation I(q) = I(0) exp(−q2Rg2/3) with the limits qRg<1.3. The program GNOM (32Svergun D.I.

https://openalex.org/W2044287941,"Correct folding of a nascent polypeptide in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) into a three-dimensional conformation is a crucial step in the stability, intracellular trafficking, and targeting to the final destination of a protein. By transiently and stably expressing human-relevant mutants of Tamm-Horsfall protein in polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, we show here that a cysteine-altering mutation in the evolutionally conserved cysteine-rich domain had more severe defects in ER exit and surface translocation and triggered more apoptosis than a cysteine-altering mutation outside the domain. Both mutants were able to specifically bind and trap the wild-type Tamm-Horsfall protein (THP) and prevent it from exiting the ER and translocating to the cell surface. This explains at least partly why in patients with THP-associated diseases there is a marked urinary reduction of both the mutant and the wild-type THP. Exposure of mutant-expressing cells to low temperature (30 °C), osmolytes (glycerol, trimethylamine N-oxide, and dimethyl sulfoxide), and the Ca(2+)-ATP inhibitor thapsigargin only slightly relieved ER retention and increased surface targeting of the mutants. In contrast, sodium 4-phenylbutyrate and probenecid, the latter a uricosuric drug used clinically to treat gout, markedly reduced ER retention of the mutants and increased their surface translocation and secretion into the culture media. The rescue of the THP mutants was associated with the restoration of the level and subcellular localization of cytosolic chaperone HSP70. Our results reveal intricate mechanistic details that may underlie THP-associated diseases and suggest that novel therapeutics enhancing the refolding of THP mutants may be of important value in therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2078762581,"Folding of the ribosomal protein S6 is a malleable process controlled by two competing, and partly overlapping, folding nuclei. Together, these nuclei extend over most of the S6 structure, except the edge strand β2, which is consistently missing in the folding transition states; despite being part of the S6 four-stranded sheet, β2 seems not to be part of the cooperative unit of the protein. The question is then whether β2 can be removed from the S6 structure without compromising folding cooperativity or native state integrity. To investigate this, we constructed a truncated variant of S6 lacking β2, reducing the size of the protein from 96 to 76 residues (S6Δβ2). The new S6 variant expresses well in Escherichia coli and has a well dispersed heteronuclear single quantum correlation spectrum and a perfectly wild-type-like crystal structure, but with a smaller three-stranded β-sheet. Moreover, S6Δβ2 displays an archetypical v-shaped chevron plot with decreased slope of the unfolding limb, as expected from a protein with maintained folding cooperativity and reduced size. The results support the notion that foldons, as defined by the structural distribution of the folding nuclei, represent a property-based level of hierarchy in the build-up of larger protein structures and suggest that the role of β2 in S6 is mainly in intermolecular binding, consistent with the position of this strand in the ribosomal assembly.

In general, the activation of tyrosine kinases (TKs) can be antagonized by the action of protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). However, in some cases PTPs can potentiate the activation of TKs. In this study, we have investigated the functional role of PTPϵ in human breast cancer cell lines. We found the up-regulation and activation of receptor PTPϵ (RPTPϵ) in MCF-7 cells and MDA-MB-231 upon PMA, FGF, and serum stimulation, which depended on EGFR and ERK1/2 activity. Diminishing the expression of PTPϵ in human breast cancer cells abolished ERK1/2 and AKT activation, and decreased the viability and anchorage-independent growth of the cells. Conversely, stable MCF-7 cell lines expressing inducible high levels of ectopic PTPϵ displayed higher activation of ERK1/2 and anchorage-independent growth. Our results demonstrate that expression of PTPϵ is up-regulated and activated in breast cancer cell lines, through EGFR, by sustained activation of the ERK1/2 pathway, generating a positive feedback regulatory loop required for survival of human breast cancer cells.

https://openalex.org/W2164832079,"Biological edge effects are often assessed in high quality focal habitats that are negatively influenced by human-modified low quality matrix habitats. A deeper understanding of the possibilities for positive edge effects in matrix habitats bordering focal habitats (e.g. spillover effects) is, however, essential for enhancing landscape-level resilience to human alterations. We surveyed epixylic (dead wood inhabiting) forest-interior cryptogams (lichens, bryophytes, and fungi) associated with mature old-growth forests in 30 young managed Swedish boreal forest stands bordering a mature forest of high conservation value. In each young stand we registered species occurrences on coarse dead wood in transects 0-50 m from the border between stand types. We quantified the effect of distance from the mature forest on the occurrence of forest-interior species in the young stands, while accounting for local environment and propagule sources. For comparison we also surveyed epixylic open-habitat (associated with open forests) and generalist cryptogams. Species composition of epixylic cryptogams in young stands differed with distance from the mature forest: the frequency of occurrence of forest-interior species decreased with increasing distance whereas it increased for open-habitat species. Generalists were unaffected by distance. Epixylic, boreal forest-interior cryptogams do occur in matrix habitats such as clear-cuts. In addition, they are associated with the matrix edge because of a favourable microclimate closer to the mature forest on southern matrix edges. Retention and creation of dead wood in clear-cuts along the edges to focal habitats is a feasible way to enhance the long-term persistence of epixylic habitat specialists in fragmented landscapes. The proposed management measures should be performed in the whole stand as it matures, since microclimatic edge effects diminish as the matrix habitat matures. We argue that management that aims to increase habitat quality in matrix habitats bordering focal habitats should increase the probability of long-term persistence of habitat specialists."
https://openalex.org/W1979115682,"The neurological disorder familial hemiplegic migraine type II (FHM2) is caused by mutations in the α2-isoform of the Na(+),K(+)-ATPase. We have studied the partial reaction steps of the Na(+),K(+)-pump cycle in nine FHM2 mutants retaining overall activity at a level still compatible with cell growth. Although it is believed that the pathophysiology of FHM2 results from reduced extracellular K(+) clearance and/or changes in Na(+) gradient-dependent transport processes in neuroglia, a reduced affinity for K(+) or Na(+) is not a general finding with the FHM2 mutants. Six of the FHM2 mutations markedly affect the maximal rate of phosphorylation from ATP leading to inhibition by intracellular K(+), thereby likely compromising pump function under physiological conditions. In mutants R593W, V628M, and M731T, the defective phosphorylation is caused by local perturbations within the Rossmann fold, possibly interfering with the bending of the P-domain during phosphoryl transfer. In mutants V138A, T345A, and R834Q, long range effects reaching from as far away as the M2 transmembrane helix perturb the function of the catalytic site. Mutant E700K exhibits a reduced rate of E(2)P dephosphorylation without effect on phosphorylation from ATP. An extremely reduced vanadate affinity of this mutant indicates that the slow dephosphorylation reflects a destabilization of the phosphoryl transition state. This seems to be caused by insertion of the lysine between two other positively charged residues of the Rossmann fold. In mutants R202Q and T263M, effects on the A-domain structure are responsible for a reduced rate of the E(1)P to E(2)P transition."

This has led to design of peptide based vaccines that are more specific, safe, and easy to produce. The obligately intracellular gram negative bacteria Ehrlichia cause ehrlichioses in humans and animals. As yet there are no vaccines to protect against Ehrlichia infection.We applied the principle of structural vaccinology to design peptides to the epitopes of Ehrlichia muris outer membrane P28-19 (OMP-1/P28) and Ehrlichia Heat shock protein 60 (Hsp60/GroEL) antigenic proteins. Both P28-19 and Ehrlichia Hsp60 peptides reacted with polyclonal antibodies against E. canis and E. chaffeensis and could be used as a diagnostic tool for ehrlichiosis.

https://openalex.org/W2075592013,"The six high-affinity insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins (IGFBPs) comprise a conserved family of secreted molecules that modulate IGF actions by regulating their half-life and access to signaling receptors, and also exert biological effects that are independent of IGF binding. IGFBPs are composed of cysteine-rich amino- (N-) and carboxyl- (C-) terminal domains, along with a cysteine-poor central linker segment. IGFBP-5 is the most conserved IGFBP, and contains 18 cysteines, but only 2 of 9 putative disulfide bonds have been mapped to date. Using a mass spectrometry (MS)-based strategy combining sequential electron transfer dissociation (ETD) and collision-induced dissociation (CID) steps, in which ETD fragmentation preferentially induces cleavage of disulfide bonds, and CID provides exact disulfide linkage assignments between liberated peptides, we now have definitively mapped 5 disulfide bonds in IGFBP-5. In addition, in conjunction with ab initio molecular modeling we are able to assign the other 4 disulfide linkages to within a GCGCCXXC motif that is conserved in five IGFBPs. Because of the nature of ETD fragmentation MS experiments were performed without chemical reduction of IGFBP-5. Our results not only establish a disulfide bond map of IGFBP-5 but also define a general approach that takes advantage of the specificity of ETD and the scalability of tandem MS, and the predictive power of ab initio molecular modeling to characterize unknown disulfide linkages in proteins."
