https://openalex.org/W2800290862,"Noncoding mutations in cancer genomes are frequent but challenging to interpret. PVT1 encodes an oncogenic lncRNA, but recurrent translocations and deletions in human cancers suggest alternative mechanisms. Here, we show that the PVT1 promoter has a tumor-suppressor function that is independent of PVT1 lncRNA. CRISPR interference of PVT1 promoter enhances breast cancer cell competition and growth in vivo. The promoters of the PVT1 and the MYC oncogenes, located 55 kb apart on chromosome 8q24, compete for engagement with four intragenic enhancers in the PVT1 locus, thereby allowing the PVT1 promoter to regulate pause release of MYC transcription. PVT1 undergoes developmentally regulated monoallelic expression, and the PVT1 promoter inhibits MYC expression only from the same chromosome via promoter competition. Cancer genome sequencing identifies recurrent mutations encompassing the human PVT1 promoter, and genome editing verified that PVT1 promoter mutation promotes cancer cell growth. These results highlight regulatory sequences of lncRNA genes as potential disease-associated DNA elements."

The role of adult stem and progenitor cells in responding to short-term fasting and whether such responses improve regeneration are not well studied. Here we show that a 24 hr fast augments intestinal stem cell (ISC) function in young and aged mice by inducing a fatty acid oxidation (FAO) program and that pharmacological activation of this program mimics many effects of fasting. Acute genetic disruption of Cpt1a, the rate-limiting enzyme in FAO, abrogates ISC-enhancing effects of fasting, but long-term Cpt1a deletion decreases ISC numbers and function, implicating a role for FAO in ISC maintenance. These findings highlight a role for FAO in mediating pro-regenerative effects of fasting in intestinal biology, and they may represent a viable strategy for enhancing intestinal regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2800679800,"Most sequenced genomes are currently stored in strict access-controlled repositories. Free access to these data could improve the power of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to identify disease-causing genetic variants and aid the discovery of new drug targets. However, concerns over genetic data privacy may deter individuals from contributing their genomes to scientific studies and could prevent researchers from sharing data with the scientific community. Although cryptographic techniques for secure data analysis exist, none scales to computationally intensive analyses, such as GWAS. Here we describe a protocol for large-scale genome-wide analysis that facilitates quality control and population stratification correction in 9K, 13K, and 23K individuals while maintaining the confidentiality of underlying genotypes and phenotypes. We show the protocol could feasibly scale to a million individuals. This approach may help to make currently restricted data available to the scientific community and could potentially enable secure genome crowdsourcing, allowing individuals to contribute their genomes to a study without compromising their privacy."
https://openalex.org/W2802144855,"Our understanding of how genotype controls phenotype is limited by the scale at which we can precisely alter the genome and assess the phenotypic consequences of each perturbation. Here we describe a CRISPR-Cas9-based method for multiplexed accurate genome editing with short, trackable, integrated cellular barcodes (MAGESTIC) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. MAGESTIC uses array-synthesized guide-donor oligos for plasmid-based high-throughput editing and features genomic barcode integration to prevent plasmid barcode loss and to enable robust phenotyping. We demonstrate that editing efficiency can be increased more than fivefold by recruiting donor DNA to the site of breaks using the LexA-Fkh1p fusion protein. We performed saturation editing of the essential gene SEC14 and identified amino acids critical for chemical inhibition of lipid signaling. We also constructed thousands of natural genetic variants, characterized guide mismatch tolerance at the genome scale, and ascertained that cryptic Pol III termination elements substantially reduce guide efficacy. MAGESTIC will be broadly useful to uncover the genetic basis of phenotypes in yeast."
https://openalex.org/W2800622346,"How long does a neutron live? Unlike the proton, whose lifetime is longer than the age of the universe, a free neutron decays with a lifetime of about 15 minutes. Measuring the exact lifetime of neutrons is surprisingly tricky; putting them in a container and monitoring their decay can lead to errors because some neutrons will be lost owing to interactions with the container walls. To overcome this problem, Pattie et al. measured the lifetime in a trap where ultracold polarized neutrons were levitated by magnetic fields, precluding interactions with the trap walls (see the Perspective by Mumm). This more precise determination of the neutron lifetime will aid our understanding of how the first nuclei formed after the Big Bang. Science , this issue p. 627 ; see also p. 605"
https://openalex.org/W2800111275,"The cell wall, a defining feature of plants, provides a rigid structure critical for bonding cells together. To overcome this physical constraint, plants must process cell wall linkages during growth and development. However, little is known about the mechanism guiding cell-cell detachment and cell wall remodeling. Here, we identify two neighboring cell types in Arabidopsis that coordinate their activities to control cell wall processing, thereby ensuring precise abscission to discard organs. One cell type produces a honeycomb structure of lignin, which acts as a mechanical ""brace"" to localize cell wall breakdown and spatially limit abscising cells. The second cell type undergoes transdifferentiation into epidermal cells, forming protective cuticle, demonstrating de novo specification of epidermal cells, previously thought to be restricted to embryogenesis. Loss of the lignin brace leads to inadequate cuticle formation, resulting in surface barrier defects and susceptible to infection. Together, we show how plants precisely accomplish abscission."
https://openalex.org/W2783688988,"Summary The dentate gyrus (DG) is crucial for behaviorally discriminating similar spatial memories, predicting that DG place cells change (remap) their relative spatial tuning (place fields) for memory discrimination. This prediction was never tested, although DG place cells remap across similar environments without memory tasks. We confirm this prior finding but find that DG place fields do not remap across spatial tasks that require DG-dependent memory discrimination. Instead of remapping, place-discriminating discharge is observed transiently among DG place cells, particularly when memory discrimination is most necessary. The DG network may signal memory discrimination by expressing distinctive sub-second network patterns of co-firing at memory discrimination sites. This involves increased coupling of discharge from place cells and interneurons, as was observed during successful, but not failed, behavioral expression of memory discrimination. Instead of remapping, these findings indicate that memory discrimination is signaled by sub-second patterns of correlated discharge within the dentate network."

Accordingly, we characterized near-pan-neutralizing antibodies extracted directly from the plasma of two elite neutralizers. Circulating anti-gp120 polyclonal antibodies were deconvoluted using proteomics to guide lineage analysis of bone marrow plasma cells. In both subjects, a single lineage of anti-CD4-binding site (CD4bs) antibodies explained the plasma-neutralizing activity. Importantly, members of these lineages potently neutralized 89%-100% of a multi-tier 117 pseudovirus panel, closely matching the specificity and breadth of the circulating antibodies. X-ray crystallographic analysis of one monoclonal, N49P7, suggested a unique ability to bypass the CD4bs Phe43 cavity, while reaching deep into highly conserved residues of Layer 3 of the gp120 inner domain, likely explaining its extreme potency and breadth. Further direct analyses of plasma anti-HIV-1 bNAbs should provide new insights for developing antibody-based antiviral agents and vaccines."

These findings provide the first algorithmic description of heat processing from sensory input to behavioral output. Environmental temperature strongly influences human behavior such as seeking shelter or wearing warm clothes in the cold. Similarly, most animal species have a narrow temperature range in which their metabolism functions optimally and have evolved behavioral strategies to seek out these preferred temperatures. Navigational strategies that lead animals to preferred temperatures within a heat gradient have been studied in diverse species, such as E. coli, C. elegans, zebrafish, and mouse (Hedgecock and Russell, 1975Hedgecock E.M.

A large group of transient receptor potential (Trp) channels are gated by temperature, and different Trp channels tile the temperature space from noxious cold to noxious heat (Caterina et al., 1997Caterina M.J. Schumacher M.A. Tominaga M. Rosen T.A. Levine J.D. Julius D.

Thermoreceptors and thermosensitive afferents.Neurosci. Biobehav. Rev. 2010; 34: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, neurons expressing these channels are concentrated in the sensory trigeminal ganglia, innervating the face, as well as in the dorsal root ganglia, from which they detect stimuli across the trunk and tail (Erzurumlu et al., 2006Erzurumlu R.S. Chen Z.-F. Jacquin M.F. Molecular determinants of the face map development in the trigeminal brainstem.Anat. Rec. A Discov. Mol. Cell. Evol.

Rev. 2010; 34: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Like other sensory stimuli, temperature has to be encoded and represented by neural activity in primary sensory neurons and subsequently needs to be filtered and processed to extract the information relevant for behavioral responses. Especially at the periphery, circuit studies have begun to elucidate how nervous systems encode temperature. For example, in C. elegans, the AFD neuron is specifically tuned to detect changes in temperature via response adaptation (Clark et al., 2006Clark D.A. Biron D. Sengupta P. Samuel A.D.T. The AFD sensory neurons encode multiple functions underlying thermotactic behavior in Caenorhabditis elegans.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 7444-7451Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). This strategy is thought to provide information about temperature gradient direction aiding in navigation (Clark et al., 2007Clark D.A. Gabel C.V. Gabel H. Samuel A.D.T. Temporal activity patterns in thermosensory neurons of freely moving Caenorhabditis elegans encode spatial thermal gradients.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 6083-6090Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, hot- and cold-sensitive neurons in the antenna form topographic projections in the brain (Gallio et al., 2011Gallio M. Ofstad T.A. Macpherson L.J. Wang J.W. Zuker C.S. The coding of temperature in the Drosophila brain.Cell. 2011; 144: 614-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), and downstream thermosensory projection neurons that can be subdivided into “ON” and “OFF” classes have been implicated in heat avoidance behavior (Frank et al., 2015Frank D.D.

Mazor O. Wilson R.I. Thermosensory processing in the Drosophila brain.Nature. 2015; 519: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In the mouse trigeminal ganglion, thermosensory neurons tile temperature space, with different neurons responding to different levels of cold or warmth (Yarmolinsky et al., 2016Yarmolinsky D.A. Peng Y. Pogorzala L.A. Rutlin M. Hoon M.A. Zuker C.S. Coding and Plasticity in the Mammalian Thermosensory System.Neuron. 2016; 92: 1079-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Overall, most thermosensory neurons represent noxious temperatures, while encoding of ambient temperature is sparse (Yarmolinsky et al., 2016Yarmolinsky D.A. Peng Y. Pogorzala L.A. Rutlin M. Hoon M.A. Zuker C.S. Coding and Plasticity in the Mammalian Thermosensory System.Neuron. 2016; 92: 1079-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Just like the aforementioned second-order projection neurons in Drosophila, second-order temperature-modulated neurons in the mouse spinal cord can be grouped into ON and OFF types (Ran et al., 2016Ran C. Hoon M.A. Chen X. The coding of cutaneous temperature in the spinal cord.Nat. Neurosci. 2016; 19: 1201-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). While warm-responsive neurons exclusively show sustained responses, cold-sensitive spinal cord neurons are generally fast adapting (Ran et al., 2016Ran C. Hoon M.A. Chen X. The coding of cutaneous temperature in the spinal cord.Nat. Neurosci. 2016; 19: 1201-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Despite these advances at the cellular and molecular level, it remains unclear how a temperature percept arises in the brain and how thermosensory activity ultimately leads to behavior. Thus, a description and analysis of the pathways that link temperature sensing to computational processes and behavioral outputs is lacking. We recently investigated how temperature influences zebrafish swimming behavior. We found that zebrafish are sensitive to absolute levels as well as to changes in temperature and that different behavioral outputs—such as turning versus straight swims—are differentially influenced by ON- and OFF-responsive channels (Haesemeyer et al., 2015Haesemeyer M. Robson D.N. Li J.M. Schier A.F. Engert F. The structure and timescales of heat perception in larval zebrafish.Cell Syst. 2015; 1: 338-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In the current study, we establish brain-wide functional calcium imaging with heat stimulation and behavioral recording to identify heat processing centers throughout the larval zebrafish brain. We find that temperature information is represented in ON and OFF channels, and we identify different cell types that represent temperature on different timescales: some are slow modulated and others are fast adapting. In particular, cell types differ between anatomical regions, with the hindbrain favoring representation on faster timescales while some forebrain regions, including the preoptic area, represent temperature on longer timescales. Importantly, we identify a critical step in the sensori-motor transformations: trigeminal sensory neurons represent temperature exclusively using sustained ON and OFF cells, whereas activity diversifies in a trigeminal target area in the hindbrain. There, cell types with transient responses arise and form a more detailed representation of temperature stimulus features. Strikingly, this response type diversification is required to explain the behavior. We used these data to derive a realistic circuit model that captures the most important computations underlying the sensori-motor transformations. The circuit model not only captures neural activity transformations but also predicts behavior and neural activity in response to novel stimuli. To observe neuronal activity and behavior in response to temperature stimuli, we used a fiber-coupled infrared laser delivering precise heat stimuli to a head-embedded larval zebrafish under a custom-built 2-photon microscope (Figures 1A and 1B ). By freeing the tail of the larva, we could monitor behavior under infrared illumination at 100 Hz while simultaneously recording calcium activity at ∼2.5 Hz. Since changes in temperature led to expansion movements in our preparation, we developed an online z-stabilization technique that allowed imaging calcium responses without stimulus induced artifacts (Figures S1A–S1C). We imaged calcium activity in larval zebrafish pan-neuronally expressing the nuclear indicator H2B-GCaMP-6 s (Freeman et al., 2014Freeman J. Vladimirov N. Kawashima T. Mu Y. Sofroniew N.J. Bennett D.V. Rosen J. Yang C.-T. Looger L.L. Ahrens M.B. Mapping brain activity at scale with cluster computing.Nat. Methods. 2014; 11: 941-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). To study behavioral and neuronal heat responses, a heat stimulus consisting of both a sinusoidal temperature modulation and discrete temperature steps was presented to the larvae. We used a thermistor in place of the fish to calibrate our stimulus (Figure 1B; see STAR Methods). With a range of 24°C to 29°C, the heat stimulus stayed below the noxious temperature threshold of ∼34°C. We probed each imaging plane with three stimulus trials and imaged 30 planes separated by 2.5 μm in each fish, achieving 3-fold coverage of the whole brain across 40 animals. Across trials, the stimulus reliably induced behavior in all tested fish (Figure 1C). As seen in Figure 1B, larval zebrafish do not swim continuously but perform swim bouts at discrete intervals (Budick and O’Malley, 2000Budick S.A. O’Malley D.M. Locomotor repertoire of the larval zebrafish: swimming, turning and prey capture.J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 2565-2579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and they can display bouts of different speeds and turn magnitudes. In our preparation, we noticed a prominent class of bouts that were characterized by unilateral flicks of the tail. We therefore used tail dynamics to divide the behavior into undulating “swims” and unilateral “flicks,” which likely correspond to near-stationary turns in freely swimming behavior (Figure 1D). Importantly, larval zebrafish performed these two behaviors with different dynamics relative to the temperature stimulus. While flick and swim rates rose similarly as temperature increased, swim rates stayed elevated for a longer time after the temperature decreased (Figure 1F). This is likely part of an adaptive strategy, favoring straighter movements over in-place turns when temperature decreases. We anatomically segmented individual cell nuclei and used spectral clustering (see STAR Methods) to extract stimulus-evoked activity in an unbiased manner across the whole brain. Imaging a total of 40 fish identified 24,947 responsive cells comprising around 4% of all imaged neurons. The neuronal responses broadly fell into two classes: ON-responsive cells, which are excited by increases in temperature, and OFF-type cells, which are inhibited by temperature or show rebound excitation when temperature decreases (Figures 1E and S1D–S1D’’). Shuffling data with respect to the stimulus reduced the number of identified cells to fewer than 5% of the original set (Figure S1E). In control fish expressing an anatomical indicator (red fluorescent protein), our clustering approach did not reveal any fluorescence changes resembling our stimulus (Figures S1F and S1G). To compare trial-to-trial variability across heat-modulated cells and behavior, we computed correlations between trial activity and behavior. While heat-modulated cells very reliably reported the stimulus with trial-to-trial correlations similar to a shot-noise model (Figure S1H), individual swim-bout generation was highly variable across trials (Figure S1I). Notably, behavioral variability across trials within fish was very similar to variability across fish (Figure S1I). To compare activity and behavior across stimulus modalities, we imaged a second set of fish presenting a modified heat stimulus followed by an acoustic tap (Figures S1J–S1L). These taps elicited escape swims that were in most cases distinct from heat-induced unilateral flicks and generally classified as swims, consistent with their bilateral tail dynamics (Lacoste et al., 2015Lacoste A.M.B. Schoppik D. Robson D.N. Haesemeyer M. Portugues R. Li J.M. Randlett O. Wee C.L. Engert F. Schier A.F. A convergent and essential interneuron pathway for Mauthner-cell-mediated escapes.Curr. Biol. 2015; 25: 1526-1534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar; Figure S1K). In summary, the head-embedded preparation enabled characterization of behavioral and neural dynamics across the whole brain while the animal was exposed to temperature and acoustic stimuli. Having established a preparation to monitor temperature-modulated neuronal activity, we set out to map heat processing centers throughout the larval zebrafish brain. To this end, we registered all imaging data onto a common reference brain (see STAR Methods; Portugues et al., 2014Portugues R. Feierstein C.E. Engert F. Orger M.B. Whole-brain activity maps reveal stereotyped, distributed networks for visuomotor behavior.Neuron. 2014; 81: 1328-1343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Neurons with heat-modulated activity could be identified throughout most of the brain prominently clustering in specific regions (Figures 2A–2D ). In the sensory trigeminal ganglia, heat-sensing neurons occupied a specific caudal subdomain (Figure 2C, right insets) that was distinct from a more rostral location of tap-responsive cells identified in our heat and tap experiments (data not shown). In the hindbrain, heat cells formed a cluster in the dorsal cerebellum; another prominent cluster could be identified in rhombomeres 5/6 (Rh 5/6), which receive synaptic input from trigeminal fibers carrying information about aversive stimuli (Pan et al., 2012Pan Y.A. Choy M. Prober D.A. Schier A.F. Robo2 determines subtype-specific axonal projections of trigeminal sensory neurons.Development. 2012; 139: 591-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The forebrain displayed widespread heat-related activity, with large fractions of heat-responsive cells in the sub-pallium as well as the right habenula (Figures 2A, 2B, and 2E). Furthermore, clusters of heat-responsive cells were identified in the pre-optic area, which has been implicated in temperature sensation and thermoregulation in mammals and reptiles (Cabanac et al., 1967Cabanac M. Hammel T. Hardy J.D. Tiliqua scincoides: temperature-sensitive units in lizard brain.Science. 1967; 158: 1050-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, Dean and Boulant, 1989Dean J.B. Boulant J.A. In vitro localization of thermosensitive neurons in the rat diencephalon.Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: R57-R64PubMed Google Scholar). Brain regions with heat-modulated activity generally contained both ON- and OFF-type cells with varying proportions (Figures 2C–2E), and with the exception of the cerebellum, most regions harbored more ON- than OFF-type cells. After identifying heat-processing centers, we tested whether heat-modulated cells and their ON and OFF subtypes cluster in the brain or if they are instead distributed in a random manner. Comparing nearest-neighbor distances revealed that heat-modulated cells indeed clustered together and that this was maintained across subtypes such as ON and OFF cells as well (Figure S2A). This clustering indicates that functional subdivisions are reflected in the anatomical location of cell types. Notably, shuffling cell identities removed all region-specific cell and type clustering (Figures S2B–S2E). This confirms that the observed structure in the data is indeed a feature of the brain and does not simply arise by chance. After the anatomical characterization, we wanted to know whether heat-modulated neurons likely encode heat information specifically or if some neurons generalize across modalities. To distinguish between these possibilities, we used the stimulus set combining temperature changes and aversive acoustic taps (Figure S1J) and identified cells that only respond to either the temperature or tap stimulus alone (unimodal cells) as well as cells that respond to both (multimodal cells) (Figure S2F). Importantly, the sensory trigeminal ganglia contained only unimodal cells for tap or for heat, a property which was also largely reflected by cells in the hindbrain (Figure 2F, blue and red). While a much larger fraction of trigeminal cells responded to the strong tap stimulus than temperature, this distribution reversed in the hindbrain. Indeed, mechano-sensory islet1-expressing cells in the trigeminal do not form extensive arborizations in Rh 5/6, which could explain this difference (Pan et al., 2012Pan Y.A. Choy M. Prober D.A. Schier A.F. Robo2 determines subtype-specific axonal projections of trigeminal sensory neurons.Development. 2012; 139: 591-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The forebrain, on the other hand, contained a significant fraction of multimodal cells, and taps were largely represented by these. Especially in the habenula, tap-responsive cells were almost exclusively multimodal, which suggests that taps are not encoded there with independent negative valence (Figure 2F). To test the role of the trigeminal ganglia in temperature sensation, we imaged the hindbrain, subsequently ablated one trigeminal ganglion, and imaged the same region again. As expected, this unilateral ablation revealed a significant reduction in heat-modulated cells in Rh 5/6 (Figure 2G). Interestingly, even though the trigeminal ganglion only innervates the ipsilateral hindbrain (Pan et al., 2012Pan Y.A. Choy M. Prober D.A. Schier A.F. Robo2 determines subtype-specific axonal projections of trigeminal sensory neurons.Development. 2012; 139: 591-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), active cells were reduced both ipsilateral and contralateral to the ablation (Figure 2G). This indicates a crossing of information in the hindbrain. The reduction in the amount of heat-modulated cells in the cerebellum was smaller than in Rh 5/6 (Figures 2G’ and 2H), which points to a non-linear flow of sensory information through the hindbrain to the cerebellum and highlights a potential compensatory function of cerebellar circuitry. In summary, the data demonstrate that heat-evoked activity is widespread throughout the brain, but heat-responsive neurons nonetheless cluster into specific regions such as the posterior trigeminal ganglion and rhombomeres 5 and 6 of the hindbrain or the cerebellum. Furthermore, while most neurons seem to be modality specific, especially in the forebrain, cell types arise that have a mixed representation of aversive stimuli. After pinpointing neurons and brain regions processing temperature stimuli, we sought to identify neurons with motor-correlated activity. To this end, we used the bout starts in each imaging plane (Figure 1C) to derive behavioral regressors by convolution with a calcium response kernel (Miri et al., 2011Miri A. Daie K. Burdine R.D. Aksay E. Tank D.W. Regression-based identification of behavior-encoding neurons during large-scale optical imaging of neural activity at cellular resolution.J. Neurophysiol. 2011; 105: 964-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These regressors represent the expected calcium response in a cell encoding the behavior and can therefore be used to probe the brain for cells showing activity that is strongly correlated (r ≥ 0.6) to motor output (Figure 3A ). Due to the high trial-to-trial variability of behavior (Figure S1I), these motor regressors are distinct from expected sensory responses; this large variability is also reflected in trial-to-trial variation of motor cell activity (Figure S1H). We generated regressors encoding all motor events (Figure 3A, “AM”) as well as regressors encoding the two subsets of motor events, flicks (“FL”) and swims (“S”). Correlating activity across the whole brain to these regressors revealed a large representation of all motor events as well as neurons significantly more correlated to behavior-specific regressors such as either flicks to the right and left or swims (Figure 3B, p < 0.01, bootstrap hypothesis test). Either motor events could be controlled by a single set of pre-motor cells or distinct stimulus modalities could influence different pre-motor pools. We therefore probed the brain for cells that encoded motor events in a stimulus-dependent manner. Namely, we created regressors that only reported motor output while the stimulus is being delivered or, conversely, during rest, while the stimulus is off. These regressors could indeed recover cells that encode behavior contingent on the stimulus presentation, either “evoked-motor” or “spontaneous-motor” cells (Figure 3B, “EVK” and “SPNT” respectively). As expected, while “all-motor” cells were equally responsive during left and right flicks, “flick-left” and “flick-right” cells responded almost exclusively during left and right flicks, respectively (Figure S3A). Bout-triggered averages also revealed that “all-motor” cells respond with equal strength irrespective of the stimulus, while “evoked-motor” and “spontaneous-motor” cells showed a much stronger response in the presence or absence of the stimulus, respectively (Figure S3B). Shuffling the activity data with respect to the behavior reduced the number of identified cells to less than 1.8% (Figures S3C and S3D). The anterior hindbrain and cerebellum contained prominent clusters of motor-related cells (Figures 3C, 3D, S3E, and S3F). Notably, the trigeminal ganglia also harbored a few motor-correlated cells in a rostral region mostly distinct from the caudal heat-sensitive domain (Figure S3E). We also identified a cluster of motor cells in the nucleus of the medial longitudinal fascicle (ncMLF), which has been implicated in controlling swim speed (Severi et al., 2014Severi K.E. Portugues R. Marques J.C. O’Malley D.M. Orger M.B. Engert F. Neural control and modulation of swimming speed in the larval zebrafish.Neuron. 2014; 83: 692-707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar; Figures 3C and 3D). While a sizeable fraction of hindbrain and ncMLF neurons encoded motor behavior, there were only few such neurons in the forebrain (Figure 3E). Cells encoding flicks to the left versus right were notably absent from the ncMLF and showed a lateralized distribution in the hindbrain, where more cells encoded behavior in an ipsilateral manner (Figure 3F). Evoked-motor and spontaneous-motor cells, on the other hand, were largely dispersed throughout motor-related brain regions but did cluster spatially within those regions (Figure 3G). In summary, behavioral subtypes and stimulus contingencies are encoded by separate pools of motor cells that are largely confined to regions previously described as encoding motor activity (Dunn et al., 2016Dunn T.W.

After the identification of heat- and motor-encoding cells in the brain, we wanted to know how well temperature-related activity in specific regions can explain the observed swim and flick behaviors. To this end, we partially annotated our reference brain with Z-Brain annotations (Randlett et al., 2015Randlett O. Wee C.L. Naumann E.A. Nnaemeka O. Schoppik D. Fitzgerald J.E. Portugues R. Lacoste A.M.B. Riegler C. Engert F. Schier A.F. Whole-brain activity mapping onto a zebrafish brain atlas.Nat. Methods. 2015; 12: 1039-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). This allowed extracting sensory-related activity using spectral clustering for cells in specific regions, effectively capturing more diversity than brain-wide clustering (see STAR Methods). This analysis revealed that stimulus representation in the sensory trigeminal neurons is simple, consisting of one ON and one OFF cell type tracking the stimulus with slow dynamics (Figure 4A ). Furthermore, the activity of both cell types was highly anti-correlated (Figure 4A’), indicating that they have very similar stimulus encoding, albeit with opposite signs. We next asked whether a simple linear regression model using the activity present in the trigeminal sensory ganglion could explain the observed flick and swim rates. Activity in the trigeminal was indeed sufficient to explain flick-type bout generation, capturing more than 90% of the variance in this behavior (Figure 4A’’ left), but it was considerably worse in explaining swims, capturing less than 70% of the variance (Figure 4A’’ right). In the Rh 5/6 region of the hindbrain, a trigeminal target area (Pan et al., 2012Pan Y.A. Choy M. Prober D.A. Schier A.F. Robo2 determines subtype-specific axonal projections of trigeminal sensory neurons.Development. 2012; 139: 591-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), activity profiles became considerably more diverse with the presence of two distinct ON and three distinct OFF cell types (Figure 4B). Importantly, both transient “fast-ON” and transient “fast-OFF” activity arose in this region, while another set of “slow-ON” and “slow-OFF” neurons mostly reflected trigeminal activity (Figure 4B). These new response types change the stimulus representation from exclusively encoding temperature levels to also representing the direction of temperature change. The distinct temporal dynamics furthermore resulted in a decorrelation of activity at this first relay station (Figure 4B’). Remarkably, combining the activity of just two response types—the trigeminal-like slow-ON and a newly formed Fast-OFF type—was sufficient to explain both flick and swim behavior, capturing 90% of the variance in both behaviors (Figure 4B’’). This suggests that the observed response diversification underlies the generation of behavior. Analyzing activity in other brain regions revealed differences in stimulus representation throughout the brain (Figures S4A–S4E). Temperature-related activity in the cerebellum followed different dynamics than activity in Rh 5/6, and the representation of stimulus amplitude was strongly reduced in this region (Figure S4A). The forebrain, especially the pallium (Figure S4C) and pre-optic area (Figure S4E), contained activity types that evolve on considerably slower timescales than neurons within the hindbrain (Figures 4B and S4A). This might indicate a role of forebrain areas in longer timescale integration of stimuli, potentially related to the"

In humans, rDNA instability is observed in cancers and premature aging syndromes, but its underlying mechanisms and functional consequences remain unclear. Here, we uncovered a pivotal role of sirtuin 7 (SIRT7), a mammalian Sir2 homolog, in guarding against rDNA instability and show that this function of SIRT7 protects against senescence in primary human cells. We found that, mechanistically, SIRT7 is required for association of SNF2H (also called SMARCA5, SWI/SNF-related matrix-associated actin-dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily A, member 5), a component of the nucleolar heterochromatin-silencing complex NoRC, with rDNA sequences. Defective rDNA–heterochromatin silencing in SIRT7-deficient cells unleashed rDNA instability, with excision and loss of rDNA gene copies, which in turn induced acute senescence. Mounting evidence indicates that accumulation of senescent cells significantly contributes to tissue dysfunction in aging-related pathologies.

https://openalex.org/W2801366999,"Ubiquitination constitutes one of the most important signaling mechanisms in eukaryotes. Conventional ubiquitination is catalyzed by the universally conserved E1-E2-E3 three-enzyme cascade in an ATP-dependent manner. The newly identified SidE family effectors of the pathogen Legionella pneumophila ubiquitinate several human proteins by a different mechanism without engaging any of the conventional ubiquitination machinery. We now report the crystal structures of SidE alone and in complex with ubiquitin, NAD, and ADP-ribose, thereby capturing different conformations of SidE before and after ubiquitin and ligand binding. The structures of ubiquitin bound to both mART and PDE domains reveal several unique features of the two reaction steps catalyzed by SidE. Further, the structural and biochemical results demonstrate that SidE family members do not recognize specific structural folds of the substrate proteins. Our studies provide both structural explanations for the functional observations and new insights into the molecular mechanisms of this non-canonical ubiquitination machinery."

Previous studies have identified brain abnormalities in abstinent alcoholics. However, whether these persistent brain deficits in abstinence could predict early relapse to alcohol use has not been well established. This study aimed to identify biomarkers of relapse vulnerability by investigating persistent brain abnormalities in abstinent alcohol-dependent patients. Methods Brain imaging and impulsive behavior data were collected from 56 abstinent alcohol-dependent male inpatients and 33 age-matched male healthy controls. Voxel-based morphometry was used to investigate the differences of grey matter volume between the groups. The resting-state functional connectivity was examined using brain areas with gray matter deficits as seed regions. A preliminary prospective study design was used to classify patients into abstainers and relapsers after a 62-day average abstinence period. Results Compared with healthy controls, both relapsers and abstainers exhibited significantly reduced gray matter volume in the cuneus. Functional connectivity analysis revealed that relapsers relative to abstainers demonstrated increased cuneus-centered negative functional connectivity within a network of brain regions which are involved in executive control and salience. Abnormal gray matter volume in the left cuneus and the functional connectivity between the right cuneus and bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex could successfully predict relapse during the 3-month follow-up period. Conclusions Findings suggest that the abnormal gray matter volume in the cuneus and resting-state cuneus-prefrontal functional connectivity may play an important role in poor treatment outcomes in alcoholics and serve as useful neural markers of relapse vulnerability."

NagA enzymes catalyze the deacetylation of GlcNAc-6-phosphate (GlcNAc6P) to glucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcN6P). NagA is a potential antitubercular drug target because it represents the key enzymatic step in the generation of essential amino-sugar precursors required for Mtb cell wall biosynthesis and also influences recycling of cell wall peptidoglycan fragments. Here, we report the structural and functional characterization of NagA from Mycobacterium smegmatis (MSNagA) and Mycobacterium marinum (MMNagA), close relatives of Mtb. Using a combination of X-ray crystallography, site-directed mutagenesis, and biochemical and biophysical assays, we show that these mycobacterial NagA enzymes are selective for GlcNAc6P. Site-directed mutagenesis studies revealed crucial roles of conserved residues in the active site that underpin stereoselective recognition, binding, and catalysis of substrates. Moreover, we report the crystal structure of MSNagA in both ligand-free form and in complex with the GlcNAc6P substrate at 2.6 and 2.0 Å resolutions, respectively. The GlcNAc6P complex structure disclosed the precise mode of GlcNAc6P binding and the structural framework of the active site, including two divalent metals located in the α/β binuclear site. Furthermore, we observed a cysteine residue located on a flexible loop region that occludes the active site. This cysteine is unique to mycobacteria and may represent a unique subsite for targeting mycobacterial NagA enzymes.

https://openalex.org/W2802516582,"Mineralocorticoid receptors (MRs) and glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) are two closely related hormone-activated transcription factors that regulate major pathophysiologic functions. High homology between these receptors accounts for the crossbinding of their corresponding ligands, MR being activated by both aldosterone and cortisol and GR essentially activated by cortisol. Their coexpression and ability to bind similar DNA motifs highlight the need to investigate their respective contributions to overall corticosteroid signaling. Here, we decipher the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms that underlie selective effects of MRs and GRs on shared genomic targets in a human renal cellular model. Kinetic, serial, and sequential chromatin immunoprecipitation approaches were performed on the period circadian protein 1 ( PER1) target gene, providing evidence that both receptors dynamically and cyclically interact at the same target promoter in a specific and distinct transcriptional signature. During this process, both receptors regulate PER1 gene by binding as homo- or heterodimers to the same promoter region. Our results suggest a novel level of MR-GR target gene regulation, which should be considered for a better and integrated understanding of corticosteroid-related pathophysiology.-Le Billan, F., Amazit, L., Bleakley, K., Xue, Q.-Y., Pussard, E., Lhadj, C., Kolkhof, P., Viengchareun, S., Fagart, J., Lombès, M.

Extensive high resolution, confocal live-cell imaging was performed to characterise the different stages of CAT fusion, using genetically encoded fluorescent labelling and vital fluorescent organelle stains. CAT homing and fusion were found to be dependent on adhesion to the surface, in contrast to germ tube development which occurs in the absence of adhesion. Staining with fluorescently labelled concanavalin A indicated that the cell wall composition of CATs differs from that of microconidia and germ tubes. The movement of nuclei, mitochondria, vacuoles and lipid droplets through fused germlings was observed by live-cell imaging."
https://openalex.org/W2799871704,"Fetal movements (FM) are a key factor in clinical management of high-risk pregnancies such as fetal growth restriction. While maternal perception of reduced FM can trigger self-referral to obstetric services, maternal sensation is highly subjective. Objective, reliable monitoring of fetal movement patterns outside clinical environs is not currently possible. A wearable and non-transmitting system capable of sensing fetal movements over extended periods of time would be extremely valuable, not only for monitoring individual fetal health, but also for establishing normal levels of movement in the population at large. Wearable monitors based on accelerometers have previously been proposed as a means of tracking FM, but such systems have difficulty separating maternal and fetal activity and have not matured to the level of clinical use. We introduce a new wearable system based on a novel combination of accelerometers and bespoke acoustic sensors as well as an advanced signal processing architecture to identify and discriminate between types of fetal movements. We validate the system with concurrent ultrasound tests on a cohort of 44 pregnant women and demonstrate that the garment is capable of both detecting and discriminating the vigorous, whole-body 'startle' movements of a fetus. These results demonstrate the promise of multimodal sensing for the development of a low-cost, non-transmitting wearable monitor for fetal movements."

These complex processes are regulated by several molecular pathways. Melanophilin (MLPH) and WNT family member 1 (WNT1), known to be involved in melanin transfer and melanin production, respectively, were predicted to be targets of microRNA-5110 using bioinformatics. In the current study, we investigated the effects of microRNA-5110 on pigmentation in alpaca (Vicugna pacos) melanocytes. In situ hybridization identified high levels of microRNA-5110 in the cytoplasm of alpaca melanocytes. Luciferase activity assays confirmed that MLPH and WNT1 were targeted by microRNA-5110 in these cells. Overexpression and knockdown of microRNA-5110 in alpaca melanocytes downregulated and upregulated MLPH and WNT1 expression at the mRNA and protein levels, respectively. In addition, overexpression and knockdown of microRNA-5110 in alpaca melanocytes decreased and increased, respectively, the mRNA levels of the melanin transfer-related genes, rat sarcoma (RAS)-associated binding (RAB27a) andmyosin5a(MYO5a); the mRNA levels of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), tyrosinase (TYR), and tyrosinase-related protein (TYRP)1; and the production of total alkali melanin and pheomelanin. In contrast, overexpression and knockdown of microRNA-5110 increased and decreased the mRNA levels of TYRP2, respectively. Overexpression of microRNA-5110 also increased eumelanin. These results indicate that microRNA- 5110 regulates pigmentation in alpaca melanocytes by directly targeting MLPH and WNT1 to affect eumelanin production and transfer.—Yang, S., Liu, B., Ji, K., Fan, R., Dong, C.

On decentralized markets, where the information is private, the influence of trust on the market outcome has been underlined by many authors. We present an empirical study of the distinctive Boulogne-sur-Mer Fish Market (where both buyers and sellers can choose to trade by either bidding or bargaining), focused on the interactions between agents. Our approach is inspired by studies of mutualistic ecosystems, where the agents are of two different types (as in plant-pollinator networks) and the interactions only take place between agents of different kinds, naturally providing benefits to both. In our context, where the two kinds of agents are buyers and sellers, our study shows that not only do their interactions bring economic benefits for the agents directly involved, but they also contribute to the stability of the market. Our results help to explain the surprising coexistence of the two forms of market in the distinctive Boulogne sur Mer Fish Market."

With the occurrences of new services, new types of distributions may arise. In this paper, we study the distributions of the time intervals between two consecutive visits to QQ and WeChat service, the top two popular instant messaging services in China, and present a new finding that when the value of statistical unit T is set to 0.001s, the inter-event time distribution follows a piecewise distribution of exponential and power-law, indicating the heterogeneous character of IM services users’ online behavior in different time scales. We infer that the heterogeneous character is related to the communication mechanism of IM and the habits of users. Then we develop a combination model of exponential model and interest model to characterize the heterogeneity. Furthermore, we find that the exponent of the inter-event time distribution of the same service is different in two cities, which is correlated with the popularity of the services. Our research is useful for the application of information diffusion, prediction of economic development of cities, and so on."

If there are changes in the objectives of the monitoring or the availability of resources, network designs should be adjusted. At the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire, USA, precipitation has been monitored with a network established in 1955 that has grown to 23 gauges distributed across nine small catchments. This high sampling intensity allowed us to simulate reduced sampling schemes and thereby evaluate the effect of decommissioning gauges on the quality of precipitation estimates. We considered all possible scenarios of sampling intensity for the catchments on the south-facing slope (2047 combinations) and the north-facing slope (4095 combinations), from the current scenario with 11 or 12 gauges to only 1 gauge remaining. Gauge scenarios differed by as much as 6.0% from the best estimate (based on all the gauges), depending on the catchment, but 95% of the scenarios gave estimates within 2% of the long-term average annual precipitation. The insensitivity of precipitation estimates and the catchment fluxes that depend on them under many reduced monitoring scenarios allowed us to base our reduction decision on other factors such as technician safety, the time required for monitoring, and co-location with other hydrometeorological measurements (snow, air temperature). At Hubbard Brook, precipitation gauges could be reduced from 23 to 10 with a change of <2% in the long-term precipitation estimates. The decision-making approach illustrated in this case study is applicable to the redesign of monitoring networks when reduction of effort seems warranted."
