https://openalex.org/W1489860413,"Superoxide (O2-.), nitric oxide (.NO), and their reaction product peroxynitrite (ONOO-) have all been shown to independently exert toxic target molecule reactions. Because these reactive species are often generated in excess during diverse inflammatory and other pathologic circumstances, we assessed the influence of .NO on membrane lipid peroxidation induced by O2-., H2O2, and .OH derived from xanthine oxidase (XO) and by ONOO-. Experimental conditions in lipid oxidation systems were adjusted to yield different rates of delivery of .NO, relative to rates of O2-. and H2O2 generation, by infusion of either .NO or via .NO released from S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine or S-nitrosoglutathione. Peroxidation of phosphatidylcholine liposomes was assessed by formation of thiobarbituric acid-reactive products and by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Liposomes exposed to XO-derived reactive species in the presence of .NO exhibited both stimulation and inhibition of lipid peroxidation, depending on the ratio of the rates of reactive oxygen species production and .NO introduction into reaction systems. Nitric oxide alone did not induce lipid peroxidation. Linolenic acid emulsions peroxidized by XO-derived reactive species showed similar dose-dependent regulation of lipid peroxidation by .NO. Mass spectral analysis of oxidation products showed formation of nitrito-, nitro-, nitrosoperoxo-, and/or nitrated lipid oxidation adducts, demonstrating that .NO serves as a potent terminator of radical chain propagation reactions. Electron spin resonance (ESR) analysis of incubation mixtures provided no evidence for formation of paramagnetic iron-lipid-nitric oxide complexes in reaction systems. Peroxynitrite-dependent lipid peroxidation, which predominantly occurs by metal-independent mechanisms, was also inhibited by .NO. Peroxynitrite-mediated benzoate hydroxylation was partially inhibited by .NO, inferring reaction between .NO and ONOOH. It is concluded that .NO can both stimulate O2-./H2O2/.OH-induced lipid oxidation and mediate oxidant-protective reactions in membranes at higher rates of .NO production, with the prooxidant versus antioxidant outcome critically dependent on relative concentrations of individual reactive species. Prooxidant reactions of .NO will occur after O2-. reaction with .NO to yield potent secondary oxidants such as ONOO- and the antioxidant effects of .NO a consequence of direct reaction with alkoxyl and peroxyl radical intermediates during lipid peroxidation, thus terminating lipid radical chain propagation reactions."
https://openalex.org/W1563689661,"Previous studies on Fe(II) uptake in Saccharomyces cerevisiae suggested the presence of two uptake systems with different affinities for this substrate. We demonstrate that the FET3 gene is required for high affinity uptake but not for the low affinity system. This requirement has enabled a characterization of the low affinity system. Low affinity uptake is time-, temperature-, and concentration-dependent and prefers Fe(II) over Fe(III) as substrate. We have isolated a new gene, FET4, that is required for low affinity uptake, and our results suggest that FET4 encodes an Fe(II) transporter protein. FET4's predicted amino acid sequence contains six potential transmembrane domains. Overexpressing FET4 increased low affinity uptake, whereas disrupting this gene eliminated that activity. In contrast, overexpressing FET4 decreased high affinity activity, while disrupting FET4 increased that activity. Therefore, the high affinity system may be regulated to compensate for alterations in low affinity activity. These analyses, and the analysis of the iron-dependent regulation of the plasma membrane Fe(III) reductase, demonstrate that the low affinity system is a biologically relevant mechanism of iron uptake in yeast. Furthermore, our results indicate that the high and low affinity systems are separate uptake pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1488601915,"Stimulation of phospholipase D by guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S) in rat liver plasma membranes indicates the involvement of GTP-binding proteins. We used RhoGDI, an inhibitor of GDP dissociation from small GTP-binding proteins of the Rho family, to determine the involvement of these proteins. Incubation, and subsequent washing, of plasma membranes with RhoGDI dose-dependently diminished GTP gamma S-stimulated phospholipase D activity, as determined by accumulation of phosphatidylethanol in the presence of ethanol. Incubation with RhoGDI also caused a rapid and dose-dependent appearance of RhoA in the wash, which was associated with the inhibition of phospholipase D. RhoGDI also rapidly extracted Cdc42 from membranes, but Rac1 was not extracted. Full reconstitution of GTP gamma S-stimulated phospholipase D in RhoGDI-washed membranes was achieved with recombinant RhoA. There was partial reconstitution with Rac1 and no enhancement with Cdc42 or ADP-ribosylation factor. The response to RhoA was dose-dependent (EC50 = 0.5 microM). ADP-ribosylation of RhoA by Clostridium botulinum C3 exoenzyme did not affect its ability to recover GTP gamma S-stimulated phospholipase D activity in RhoGDI-washed membranes. These findings support a role for GTP-binding proteins of the Rho family in the activation of membrane-associated phospholipase D and implicate RhoA as the major protein involved."
https://openalex.org/W1615328259,"11 beta-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11-HSD) catalyzes the conversion of cortisol to cortisone and corticosterone to 11-dehydrocorticosterone. This activity may be required to confer normal ligand specificity upon the mineralocorticoid receptor. Although an isozyme of 11-HSD was previously isolated from rat liver, a different isozyme is apparently expressed in mineralocorticoid target tissues. We isolated a sheep kidney cDNA clone encoding this isozyme by expression screening using Xenopus oocytes. The cDNA is 1.8 kilobase pairs in length and encodes a protein of 427 amino acid residues with a predicted M(r) of 46,700. When expressed in oocytes, this enzyme functions as an NAD(+)-dependent 11 beta-dehydrogenase with very high affinity for steroids, but it has no detectable reductase activity. It is 37% identical in amino acid sequence to an NAD(+)-dependent isozyme of 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase but only 20% identical to the NADP(+)-dependent liver isozyme of 11-HSD. It is expressed at high levels in the kidney and adrenal and at lower levels in the colon. The corresponding gene is present in a single copy in the sheep genome. In humans, this gene is a candidate locus for the syndrome of apparent mineralocorticoid excess, a form of hypertension postulated to result from 11-HSD deficiency in mineralocorticoid target tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1568494138,"The Ser/Thr phosphoprotein phosphatases (PPases) display similarities in amino acid sequence and biochemical properties. Most members of this family require transition metal ions for activity. The smallest family member, the bacteriophage lambda PPase (lambda-PPase), has been successfully overexpressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and characterized (Zhuo, S., Clemens, J.C., Hakes, D.J., Barford, D., and Dixon, J. E. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 17754-17761). Site-directed mutagenesis has now been employed to define amino acid residues in lambda-PPase required for metal ion binding and catalysis. Conservative amino acid substitutions at residues Asp20, His22, Asp49, His76, and Glu77 affected lambda-PPase catalysis and metal ion binding, whereas substitutions at residues Arg53 and Arg73 affected catalysis and substrate binding. Each of these residues is invariant in all phosphoprotein phosphatases, suggesting that these residues may play important roles in binding and catalysis in all of the PPases. Computer-assisted sequence alignment further revealed that lambda-PPase residues Asp20, His22, Asp49, His76, Arg53, and Arg73 lie within three larger regions of PPase sequence identity with the consensus sequence (DXH-(approximately 25)-GDXXD-(approximately 25)-GNHD/E). This motif can be found in a wide variety of phosphoesterases unrelated to the PPases and defines structural and catalytic features utilized by a diverse group of enzymes for the hydrolysis of phosphate esters."
https://openalex.org/W1606267994,"The repetitive C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase (RNAP) II is extensively phosphorylated concomitant with the initiation of transcription and must be dephosphorylated before RNAP II can begin another round of transcription. A CTD phosphatase was purified more than 7,500-fold from a HeLa cell extract. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis shows a predominant protein of 205 kDa and a less abundant protein of 150 kDa co-eluting with the CTD phosphatase activity. Sedimentation and gel filtration analysis suggest that CTD phosphatase has an elongated structure with a M(r) of 200,000. This enzyme is a type 2C phosphatase in that it requires Mg2+ for activity and is resistant to okadaic acid. CTD phosphatase appears to processively dephosphorylate the CTD and is specific in that it does not dephosphorylate phosphorylase a, the alpha or beta subunits of phosphorylase kinase or RNAP II phosphorylated with casein kinase II. CTD phosphatase dephosphorylates RNAP IIO purified from calf thymus or generated in vitro by two previously described CTD kinases. These results suggest that CTD phosphatase has the properties expected for a protein phosphatase that catalyzes the conversion of RNAP IIO to RNAP IIA and may play a key role in the transcription cycle of RNAP II."
https://openalex.org/W1503779966,"Extracellular 14-kDa phospholipases A2 (PLA2) in inflammatory exudates can contribute to bacterial phospholipid (PL) degradation during phagocytosis of Escherichia coli by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) and are highly active toward E. coli treated with the bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI) purified from PMN. PLA2 activity toward BPI-treated E. coli varies greatly among members of this conserved family of enzymes and apparently depends on a cluster of basic residues in a variable surface region near the NH2 terminus for recognition of this biological target (Weiss, J., Wright, G.W., Bekkers, A.C.A.P.A., van den Bergh, C.J., and Verheij, H.M. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 4162-4167). We have examined by site-specific mutagenesis of a recombinant PLA2 that is identical to an enzyme in human synovial fluid (containing His-6, Arg-7, Lys-10, and Lys-15 and a global net charge of +15) the role of basic residues in this region in PLA2 action against PLA-deficient (pldA-) E. coli. Substitution of Ser for Arg-7 +/- Gln for Lys-15 caused, respectively, about a 10- and 25-fold reduction in BPI-dependent PLA2 binding and activity to E. coli, but had no effect on hydrolysis of PL of autoclaved E. coli or dispersions of purified PL. PL degradation during phagocytosis was increased after pretreatment of E. coli (or PMN) with wild-type PLA2 followed by removal of unbound PLA2. Thus, the PLA2 binds to cells before phagocytosis followed by internalization of the enzyme along with E. coli and intracellular action. Mutant (e.g. R7S +/- K15Q) PLA2 show the same BPI-independent binding to E. coli as the wild-type enzyme but 10-30-fold reduced activity during phagocytosis, reflecting lower intracellular activity of these enzymes. Thus, structural determinants first implicated in PLA2 action toward E. coli treated with purified BPI apparently are also important in the intracellular action of PLA2 during phagocytosis by PMN."
https://openalex.org/W1612358423,"Studies were conducted to characterize a human monocyte model where the role of the 85-kDa phospholipase A2 (PLA2) in prostanoid formation could be evaluated. The presence of an immunologically related 85-kDa PLA2 and type II 14-kDa PLA2 was demonstrated in human monocytes and their roles examined in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced monocyte prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) formation. Exposure of human monocytes to LPS over 18 h resulted in the up-regulation of the mitogen-inducible cyclooxygenase-2 and was accompanied by production and release of prostaglandin E2 but not leukotriene C4. This coincided with a 2-fold increase in the 85-kDa PLA2 protein and activity levels. In contrast, there was no effect on the type II 14-kDa-like PLA2 activity measured in the 100,000 x g particulate fraction nor did LPS induce the release of type II 14-kDa PLA2 into the medium. Treatment with cycloheximide over 18 h resulted in a time-dependent decrease in cytosolic 85-kDa PLA2 protein and activity (half-life = 4 h), but there was no change in the particulate type II 14-kDa-like PLA2 activity. Monocytes were therefore exposed to an 85-kDa PLA2 initiation site-directed antisense oligonucleotide which specifically decreased the cytosolic 85-kDa PLA2 protein levels and activity in a concentration-dependent manner. This had no effect on the cyclooxygenase-2 (protein mass or the ability to convert arachidonic acid to PGE2) or the particulate fraction sn-2 acylhydrolytic activity but was associated with a decrease in LPS-induced PGE2 production. Taken together, these data support a role for the cytosolic 85-kDa PLA2 in LPS-induced monocyte PGE2 formation."
https://openalex.org/W1579870050,Full-length cDNAs for the three human plasma membrane Ca2+ pump isoforms 2 (PMCA2) differently spliced at the A site were constructed and transferred to baculovirus. The corresponding proteins were expressed after infection in Sf9 insect cells. The proteins were expressed at high levels and retained the canonical properties of the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump. The alternative splicing process failed to produce functional differences detectable with the methods used. The Ca(2+)-dependent ATPase activity of the PMCA2 pumps had a 5-10-fold higher affinity for calmodulin than the PMCA4 pump expressed in the same system. Experiments on the formation of the phosphoenzyme intermediate from ATP revealed that the PMCA2 pumps had higher affinity for ATP than did the PMCA4 counterpart. The response of the two pump types to activating acidic phospholipids was the same.
https://openalex.org/W1663952990,"Normal cells become senescent in culture after a limited number of population doublings becoming unable to respond to mitogens. This raises the possibility of defects in mitogenic signaling pathways in cellular senescence. In contrast to young human diploid fibroblasts (HDF), their senescent counterparts failed to undergo protein kinase C translocation in response to serum stimulation. On the other hand, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate was equally active in inducing protein kinase C translocation in young and senescent HDF. This suggested a defect in generation of the endogenous activator of protein kinase C, diacylglycerol. Stimulation of young HDF with serum resulted in 3-4-fold generation of diacylglycerol (DAG). In contrast, senescent cells displayed insignificant DAG formation in response to serum. The mechanism of DAG generation was investigated next. In young HDF, serum induced a 5-fold activation of the phospholipase D (PLD) pathway as measured by the incorporation of exogenous ethanol into phosphatidylethanol, which is a measure of the transphosphatidylation reaction of PLD. In contrast, PLD in senescent cells was not activated by serum. Since senescent cells demonstrate significant elevations in the level of endogenous ceramide, the impact of ceramide on the PLD/DAG pathway was also investigated. A soluble analog of ceramide, C6-ceramide, was found to inhibit serum-stimulated DAG accumulation and PLD activation in young cells. These data demonstrate for the first time a defect in PLD activation in cellular senescence and suggest that ceramide may be responsible for the inhibition of this pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1583629732,"The uncoupling protein generates heat by catalyzing electrophoretic proton transport across the inner membrane of brown adipose tissue mitochondria. It also transports Cl- and other monovalent anions, and both proton and anion transport are inhibited by purine nucleotides. Several long-standing hypotheses bear on specific aspects of Cl- transport, H+ transport, and nucleotide gating mechanisms in uncoupling protein. We reevaluated these hypotheses in mitochondria and liposomes reconstituted with purified uncoupling protein; GDP inhibition is strictly noncompetitive with Cl- and unaffected by either transmembrane electrical potential or fatty acids. The Km and Vmax values for Cl- are independent of pH, arguing against a common binding site for Cl- and OH- ions. Cl- transport was inhibited by fatty acids and stimulated by fatty acid removal, refuting the consensus hypothesis that there is no interaction between fatty acids and anion transport through uncoupling protein. These results support a mechanism in which the transport pathway for anions is identical with the fatty acid binding site and distinct from the nucleotide binding site."
https://openalex.org/W1581994435,"To investigate roles of second extracellular loop sequences in peptide and nonpeptide ligand recognition by human opiate receptors, we have constructed a chimeric receptor in which this domain of the human mu opiate receptor has been replaced with that of the human kappa opiate receptor. The chimeric opiate receptor displays dramatically increased affinity for dynorphin peptides. Affinities for dynorphin A-(1-17), dynorphin A-(1-13), and alpha-neoendorphin increase by up to 250-fold when compared with the wild-type human mu opiate receptor. The chimera maintains recognition of the mu-selective ligands morphine and [D-Ala2,MePhe4,Gly-ol5]enkephalin and displays no significant changes in affinity for the kappa-selective small molecule ligand U50,488. The chimeric opiate receptor displays evidence for effective G-protein coupling; 100 nM dynorphin A-(1-17) is as effective as 100 nM morphine at inhibiting forskolin-stimulated adenyl cyclase activity through actions at the chimeric receptor. These data suggest that the putative second extracellular loop contributes substantially to the kappa receptor's selectivity in dynorphin ligand recognition."
https://openalex.org/W991373308,"beta-Adrenergic receptor (beta AR) subtypes differ not only by characteristic ligand affinities but also in the manner and extent to which they mediate agonist-promoted events such as activation of adenylyl cyclase and receptor sequestration. We utilized mutagenesis and recombinant expression in Chinese hamster fibroblasts to examine the effect of an unusual proline-rich 24-amino acid sequence (PARPPSPSPSPVPAPAPPPGPPRP) present in the third intracellular loop of the beta 1AR, but not in the beta 2AR, on the aforementioned receptor-mediated events. Cells expressing the wild-type beta 2AR stimulated adenylyl cyclase in response to the agonist isoproterenol with an EC50 approximately 5-fold lower than that observed with the beta 1AR (0.53 +/- 0.14 versus 2.47 +/- 0.52 nM, p < 0.01). Deletion of the proline-rich sequence from the beta 1AR resulted in an improvement in isoproterenol-stimulated adenylyl cyclase to an EC50 value intermediate to that observed in the wild-type receptors (1.14 +/- 0.08 nM, p < 0.05 versus wild-type beta 1AR). In contrast, insertion of this sequence into the beta 2AR impaired its ability to mediate this process. Similar results were observed for receptor sequestration. Wild-type beta 1-and beta 2AR underwent maximal agonist-promoted sequestration of 25.9 +/- 4.0 and 60.0 +/- 3.3%, respectively. Deletion of the proline-rich region from the beta 1AR improved maximal sequestration to 43.0 +/- 2.7% (p < 0.01 versus wild-type beta 1AR), while insertion of the sequence into the beta 2AR impaired sequestration to 33.9 +/- 2.7% (p < 0.001 versus wild-type beta 2AR). We conclude that the distinct phenotypic patterns observed for these two agonist-promoted events in the beta 1AR and beta 2AR subtypes are partially due to the conformational effects of this proline-rich third intracellular loop sequence. Such regions, which are also found in some other G-protein-coupled receptors, may represent a general motif responsible for attenuating certain agonist-promoted receptor events."
https://openalex.org/W1543592150,"Respiration-defective pet mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, assigned to complementation group G25, are grossly deficient in mitochondrial respiratory and ATPase complexes. This phenotype is usually found in strains impaired in mitochondrial protein synthesis. The G25 mutants, however, synthesize all of the proteins encoded by mitochondrial DNA. The mutants are also able to import and process cytoplasmically derived subunits of these enzymes. These results are most compatible with the idea that the gene defined by G25 mutants (RCA1) codes for a protein essential for the assembly of functional respiratory and ATPase complexes. The RCA1 gene has been cloned by complementation of an rca1 mutant with a yeast genomic library. The sequence of the encoded product shows Rca1 protein to be a new member of a recently described family of ATPases. The Rca1 protein is a mitochondrial membrane protein and is the third known member of this family implicated to function in the biogenesis of mitochondria. The primary structure of Rca1 protein indicates several distinct domains in addition to the common purine nucleotide binding region shared by all members of this protein family. One, located in the amino-terminal half, contains two hydrophobic stretches of sufficient length to span a membrane lipid bilayer."
https://openalex.org/W1610200887,"An Nb2 prolactin receptor (PRL-R) cDNA has been cloned from the PRL-dependent Nb2-11C cell line, and the protein-coding region is identical to that of the PRL-R isolated from the PRL-independent cell line Nb2-Sp. Short, Nb2, and long forms of the PRL-R were analyzed for signal transduction to the immediate-early gene, interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) and for cellular proliferation. Receptor and IRF-1-CAT reporter constructs were transiently cotransfected into the interleukin-3-dependent cell lines FDC-P1 and BaF3. The Nb2 PRL-R induced IRF-1-CAT 14.3-fold on addition of PRL, while the long PRL-R induced IRF-1-CAT 5.6-fold in FDC-P1 cells. The short PRL-R did not activate the IRF-1 promoter. Stable transfectants were also generated by selecting for growth in PRL. Only the Nb2 and long forms were able to convert the IL-3-dependent cells to PRL-dependence. IRF-1-CAT was induced in these cell lines by the Nb2 PRL-R 10- to 12-fold and long PRL-R 3- to 3.5-fold. Overall, the Nb2 form is more efficient than the long form by about 3-fold at inducing IRF-1-CAT. A PRL dose-response growth curve showed that the Nb2 form requires 20-fold less PRL for half maximal growth than the long form. A PRL dose-response for IRF-1-CAT activity gave similar results, indicating a tight correlation between IRF-1 induction and cell proliferation. These results show that the short PRL-R does not signal to IRF-1 or for growth, and that the Nb2 PRL-R signals more efficiently than the long PRL-R."
https://openalex.org/W1555328112,"Dileucine motifs have been shown to be involved in trans Golgi sorting, lysosomal targeting, and internalization of a number of proteins. The insulin receptor contains four dileucine pairs in its cytoplasmic domain. To determine if these insulin receptor sequences can serve as lysosomal sorting sequences, chimeric molecules expressing the Tac antigen fused to each isolated insulin receptor motif were constructed. A chimera containing the juxtamembrane dileucine motif (EKITLL), which closely resembles the sequences originally identified in the gamma- and delta-chains of the T cell receptor (DKQTLL and EVQALL), was shown to sort to lysosomes by immunofluorescence microscopy, as did a chimera expressing the dileucine motif (GGKGLL) found in the tyrosine kinase domain. Chimeras expressing either a second tyrosine kinase domain sequence (HVVRLL) or the carboxyl-terminal sequence (EIVNLL) localized to both lysosomes and the plasma membrane. In contrast, chimeras expressing two other potential sorting signals found in the cytoplasmic tail of the insulin receptor (NARDII and KNGRIL) localized predominantly to the plasma membrane. Exclusively cell surface staining was also seen for a chimera expressing a mutant motif (EKITAA), where the leucine residues were mutated to alanines. When the alanine pair was introduced into the juxtamembrane domain of the intact insulin receptor and the mutant receptor expressed in NIH-3T3 cells, we found that the mutation did not impair insulin binding or receptor tyrosine kinase activity. However, the Ala-Ala mutant internalized insulin 5-fold slower than the wild-type receptor. Taken together, these findings suggest that the dileucine motif found in the juxtamembrane domain of the insulin receptor is involved in receptor internalization and that other insulin receptor sequences may mask the potential lysosomal targeting signals in the intact molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1574889281,"To better understand the molecular basis for increased atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) expression during overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy, we studied the induction of the genes in primary myocardial cells by the alpha 1-adrenergic agonist, phenylephrine (PE), a potent hypertrophic agent. PE augmented the transcription of both genes to similar extents, although the time course of mRNA accumulation differed. Increases in ANF mRNA were evident only after 6-8 h of PE exposure, when transcript levels were 2-4-fold over control. However, similar increases in BNP mRNA were observed as soon as 1 h of PE exposure. Moreover, while ANF mRNA levels continued to increase through 24 h of PE treatment, maximal levels of BNP mRNA (8-10-fold over control) were observed at 4 h, after which transcript levels declined to about 3-fold over control. The early induction of the BNP mRNA by PE was independent of protein synthesis, whereas the late induction of both genes required protein synthesis. Interestingly, the early BNP induction was only partially blocked by the transcription inhibitor, actinomycin D, indicating that, in part, the inductive effects of PE might be the result of transcript stabilization. Indeed, the BNP transcript, which was shown to possess a half-life of less than 1 h in control cells, was stabilized by the addition of PE, while the ANF transcript possessed a half-life of at least 24 h under all conditions. These data indicate that the induction of BNP by alpha 1-adrenergic agonists has characteristics of both a primary and secondary response gene, while ANF is a typical secondary response gene. Moreover, alpha 1-adrenergic stimulation enhances BNP expression through both transcriptional activation and transcript stabilization, while ANF expression is enhanced primarily transcriptionally."
https://openalex.org/W1528146981,"Several B2 bradykinin (BK) receptor-specific antagonists including HOE140, NPC17731, and NPC567 exhibited negative intrinsic activity, which was observed as a decrease in basal phosphoinositide hydrolysis in primary cultures of rat myometrial cells, and this response was opposite to that elicited by the agonist BK. The order of potency of the antagonists in attenuating basal activity was essentially the same as that in competing both [3H]BK and [3H]NPC17731 for binding to B2 receptors on both intact rat myometrial cells and bovine myometrial membranes. We previously proposed a three-state model for the binding of agonists to G-protein-coupled B2 receptors in bovine myometrial membranes (Leeb-Lundberg, L. M. F. and Mathis, S. A. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 9621-9627). This model was based on the ability of BK to promote the sequential formation of three receptor binding states where formation of the third, equilibrium state was blocked by Gpp(NH)p (guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate) identifying it as the G-protein-coupled state of the receptor. Here, we show that, in contrast to BK, these antagonists bound preferentially to a G-protein-uncoupled state of the receptor. These results indicate that B2 receptor antagonists that stabilize a G-protein-uncoupled state of the receptor act as inverse agonists. Furthermore, these results provide strong evidence that endogenous G-protein-coupled receptors exhibit spontaneous activity in their natural environment in the absence of agonist occupancy."
https://openalex.org/W1543392049,"Growth hormone activates gene transcription of the serine protease inhibitors (SPI) 2.1 and 2.2 by an unknown mechanism. In order to define the promoter regions responsible for this effect and to characterize the transcription factors involved, we have performed gel electrophoresis mobility shift assays on nuclear extracts from cell lines transfected with growth hormone receptor cDNA. We have identified a 9-base pair DNA element, the SPI-GLE 1, which forms a complex with nuclear proteins following activation by growth hormone and which, when placed upstream of a minimal thymidine kinase promoter, drives chloramphenicol acetyltransferase expression in a growth hormone-dependent fashion. This element is similar to those from several genes regulated by other cytokines including interferon. The growth hormone-induced complexes formed were dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation but did not contain the interferon-gamma-activated transcription factor Stat 91. Competition studies with oligonucleotides similar to the SPI-GLE 1 reveal the sequence of a consensus element that specifically binds growth hormone-regulated nuclear proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1592461359,"Insects have a unique repertoire of peptide antibiotics but, to date, prospects of clinical applications are not clear. Apidaecin, a small peptide isolated from honeybees, inhibits viability of Gram-negative bacteria; lethal activity is near immediate, independent of a conventional lytic mechanism, and involves stereoselective recognition of target molecules. Here we report structural analysis of 14 naturally occurring apidaecin-type peptides and the existence of evolutionarily conserved (constant) regions. By detailed analysis of activities against clinically relevant bacteria, we demonstrate that the diversity of the intervening (variable) regions confers specificity to the antibacterial spectrum of each homolog. As a result, apidaecin-homolog-based antibiograms (using 16 peptides) differ markedly between bacterial strains, contrasting the most between Yersinia enterocolitica and Campylobacter jejuni. Furthermore, in at least one instance, acquired resistance to apidaecin could be negated by minor substitutions in the variable regions. The delineation in a short peptide of constant and variable regions, responsible for, respectively, general antibacterial capacity and specificity of the antibacterial spectrum, is unprecedented. Taken together, we provide evidence that antibacterial spectra of apidaecin-type peptides can be manipulated, and that, in some cases, resistance can be countered and perhaps prevented. The current findings will guide rational design of second generation peptide antibiotics for clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W1680435437,"NhaB, a Na+/H+ antiporter from Escherichia coli, was overproduced, purified, and reconstituted in a functional state, demonstrating that a single polypeptide, the product of the nhaB gene, can catalyze full activity. NhaB is a minor protein that accounts for less than 0.1% of the total membrane protein. The use of proteoliposomes made possible the determination of important kinetic and pharmacological properties in the absence of passive and mediated leaks. The activity of NhaB was found to have some pH dependence; the apparent Km for Na+ changes by 10-fold from 1.55 mM at pH 8.5 to 16.66 mM at pH 7.2, while the Vmax remains constant. It was demonstrated that NhaB is electrogenic and translocates more H+ than Na+ per cycle; the rate of sodium efflux from proteoliposomes was accelerated by a membrane potential, negative inside, and NhaB activity generated a membrane potential as monitored by two techniques. The stoichiometry of NhaB was estimated by a thermodynamic method in which the magnitude of delta psi generated by NhaB was measured at various Na+ gradients. A kinetic method, in which the electrophoretic movement of 86Rb+ (in the presence of valinomycin) was monitored in parallel with measurements of NhaB-mediated 22Na+ uptake, allowed us to determine a stoichiometry of 3H+/2Na+. The significance of the existence of two antiporters with different stoichiometries, NhaA and NhaB, active in the same cell, is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1871333004,"The substrate-binding site of a protein with multiple specificity should satisfy geometric and energetic complementarity for several different substrates. The structural basis of the multiple ligand specificity of the periplasmic lysine-, arginine-, ornithine-binding protein (LAO) was investigated by determining and analyzing the structures of the protein unliganded and liganded with each of the three high-affinity ligands (L-lysine, L-arginine, and L-ornithine) and with one low-affinity ligand (L-histidine). The geometric complementarity is achieved primarily by virtue of the large size of the ligand-binding site which can accommodate the maximum common volume of the four ligands plus three water molecules. The optimization of energetic complementarity is achieved by the relocation of protein-bound water molecules and by the movement of the Asp-11 side chain. The structure of the LAO-histidine complex indicates that the 30-fold reduced affinity of the protein for histidine is primarily due to unavailability of one ionic interaction of the histidine side chain with the protein which is present in the other three complexes."

We have characterized a novel 14-kDa V-ATPase subunit (Vma7p), encoded by the VMA7 gene, which exhibits features common to both V1 and V0 subunit proteins. Vma7p is a hydrophilic protein of 118 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 13,452 Da. Vacuolar membranes isolated from a vma7 delta null mutant contained no V-ATPase activity. Western analysis of vma7 delta cells revealed greatly reduced levels of the remaining V0 complex V-ATPase subunits, but normal levels of the V1 subunits. However, the V1 subunits failed to associate with the vacuolar membrane. Unlike the integral membrane subunits of the V0 complex, Vma7p was easily stripped from vacuolar membranes. Density gradient fractionation revealed that Vma7p associated only with the fully assembled V-ATPase and did not associate with a separate lower density V0 subcomplex fraction. The unique properties of the Vma7p may reflect a critical role in stabilizing the V0 complex and bridging the V1 and V0 complexes to form a functional V-ATPase complex."
https://openalex.org/W1534302336,"cdc2 mRNA transcripts were detected in immature bone marrow cells and became undetectable along with differentiation. Peripheral blood resting cells did not express cdc2 mRNA, but it was induced in T-lymphocytes when the cells reentered the cell cycle in response to specific mitogens. In contrast, cdc2 mRNA could not be induced in granulocytes and monocytes even after the culture with the appropriate stimulants. In order to investigate the mechanism of the regulation of cdc2 mRNA expression in hematopoietic cells, we isolated the 5'-flanking sequence of the cdc2 gene and found the putative E2F binding site at the position of nucleotides -124 to -117. The binding of E2F at this region was detected by a gel-retardation assay and DNaseI footprinting in phytohemagglutinin-stimulated T-lymphocytes, which was coincident with the expression of cdc2 mRNA. E2F binding was not observed in both granulocytes and monocytes. Transient chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay revealed that the region containing E2F binding site had a strong promoter activity, and introduction of the mutation at the E2F binding site resulted in a significant loss of the activity. E2F-1 and DP-1 mRNAs were not detectable in granulocytes, monocytes and resting T-lymphocytes but were induced after the mitogenic stimulation of T-lymphocytes. The induction of E2F activity preceded the appearance of cdc2 mRNA, which is consistent with the role of E2F in the regulation of cdc2 mRNA expression. These results suggest that cdc2 mRNA expression is related to the cell cycling of normal human hematopoietic cells and that E2F plays some roles in the regulation of its expression."
https://openalex.org/W1595997248,"We recently demonstrated that conserved tyrosines Tyr198 of the alpha subunit and Tyr117 of the gamma subunit of the acetylcholine receptor stabilize binding of the curariform antagonist dimethyl-d-tubocurarine (DMT). To test the hypothesis that DMT interacts directly with these tyrosines, and therefore bridges the alpha-gamma subunit interface, we introduced point mutations into these key positions and expressed one or both mutant subunits in alpha 2 beta gamma 2 acetylcholine receptors in 293 HEK cells. Binding of DMT, measured by competition against the initial rate of 125I-alpha-bungarotoxin binding, shows high affinity for aromatic mutations, reduced affinity for polar mutations, and lowest affinity for arginine mutations. Similar side chain dependences were observed for both Tyr alpha 198 and Tyr gamma 117, indicating interaction of these residues with two symmetrical chemical groups in DMT. Two more bisquaternary antagonists, pancuronium and gallamine, show side chain dependences similar to that of DMT, indicating that the primary stabilizing interactions are aromatic-quaternary in both subunits. For the rigid ligands DMT and pancuronium, co-expressing mutant alpha and gamma subunits revealed independent contributions by each determinant, but strict independence was not observed for the flexible ligand gallamine. The free energy contributed by each aromatic-quaternary interaction was estimated to be 2-4 kcal/mol, as determined from the free energy difference between aromatic and alkyl hydroxyl mutations. Our results suggest that bis-quaternary competitive antagonists bridge the alpha-gamma subunit interface by fitting into a pocket bounded by tyrosines at positions 198 of the alpha subunit and 117 of the gamma subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1487850409,"Site-directed mutagenesis was used to explore the functions of a number of acidic residues of bovine low molecular weight protein tyrosine phosphatase. Residues Asp-129, Asp-56, and Asp-92 were mutated to Ala or Asn. The mutant enzymes D56A, D56N, and D92A showed no significant changes in Vmax values, although they did exhibit significantly altered Km values. In contrast, the D129A mutant enzyme exhibited a greater than 2000-fold reduction in Vmax, using p-nitrophenyl phosphate as a substrate. The Vmax values of D129A also exhibited a leaving group dependence, an altered solvent isotope effect of VmaxH/VmaxD of 0.78, and a lack of dependence on the presence of alternative phosphate acceptor alcohols, all properties that distinguish this mutant from wild type enzyme. The differences are due to a change of the rate-limiting step of the catalytic reaction. Asp-129 is concluded to be the proton donor to the leaving group in the phosphorylation step, and its mutation to alanine results in a reduced Vmax value and a change in the rate-limiting step of the catalysis from dephosphorylation to phosphorylation. Mechanistic considerations suggest that other phosphotyrosyl phosphatases having cysteine at the active site may be expected to have a similar requirement for a proton donor."
https://openalex.org/W1642924803,"Single-chain Fv (sFv) proteins are genetically engineered molecules that consist of the two variable domains of an antibody connected by a polypeptide linker; they contain the antigen binding function of the parental protein in a single 30-kDa polypeptide chain. sFvs are usually produced in bacteria where they are insoluble and therefore require extensive refolding in vitro. In this report we followed the processing of three antibody sFvs (145-2C11 directed against murine CD3 epsilon chain, OKT9 against the human transferrin receptor, and U7.6 against dinitrophenyl groups) by transfected mammalian (COS-7) cells to determine whether the mammalian protein folding machinery can produce and secrete active sFv with high efficiency. The sFvs contained an immunoglobulin light chain leader sequence, which directed them to the endoplasmic reticulum and allowed secretion into the medium. We found that the sFvs were secreted at different rates, with the rate-limiting step of secretion being their exit from the endoplasmic reticulum. We increased the secretion rate of one of the sFvs by introducing an asparagine-linked glycosylation site in FR1 of the heavy chain, and by using tunicamycin (an inhibitor of glycosylation) we found that glycosylated antibody sFvs were secreted faster than their nonglycosylated counterparts. All secreted sFvs specifically bound their antigens; where tested, at least 90% of the secreted sFv was functional. Therefore, mammalian cells can effectively fold and secrete sFv antibody and can provide a convenient system for testing and producing sFv proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1505009523,"Mutants in and around the catalytic zinc-binding site of human fibroblast-type collagenase have been expressed in Escherichia coli. Replacement of each of the three zinc ligands, His-199, His-203, and His-209, in the active site sequence: VAAHEXGHXXGXXH, not only destroyed catalytic activity but also led to improper folding of the polypeptide, suggesting that this sequence also serves as a structural zinc-binding site. By comparison, mutation of His-194 immediately preceding this sequence had no measurable effect on catalytic activity or on folding. Replacement of Glu-200 in the active site yielded enzymes that either were completely inactive (E200Q) or had greatly diminished (E200D) catalytic activity. Both Glu-200 mutants, however, were fully capable of forming complexes with tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1) after reaction with organomercurials. Formation of complexes with TIMP-1 appear to require a properly folded, but not necessarily catalytically competent, active site. By contrast, complexes with alpha 2-macroglobulin form only with mutants with a catalytically competent active site. Two mutants identified in this study (E200Q and D212E) appeared to be properly folded but unable to generate any catalytic activity when exposed to either p-aminophenylmercuric acetate, trypsin, or SDS."
https://openalex.org/W1578325385,"The effect of glucose on hepatic fructose (Fru) 2,6-P2 in starved rats was investigated. When livers were perfused with high glucose (40 mM), hexose-P in the liver increased immediately reaching the maximum within in 2 min, but Fru 2,6-P2 after a lag period of 4 min increased linearly. The activation of Fru 6-P,2-kinase and inactivation of Fru 2,6-Pase also showed a similar lag period. Determination of the phosphate contents of the bifunctional enzyme after 10 min of glucose perfusion revealed that 90% of the enzyme was in the dephospho form while only 10% of the control liver enzyme was dephosphorylated. Comparison of crude extracts of liver perfused with either high glucose or normal glucose (5.6 mM) showed that high glucose livers contained 50% higher protein phosphatase activity, which dephosphorylated the bifunctional enzyme. Subcellular fractionation of the extract showed that activation of the protein phosphatase occurred in the cytosol. Desalting of the cytosolic fraction resulted in a 50% loss of the protein phosphatase activity. The low molecular weight activator in the cytosol was isolated, and by various chemical and enzymatic methods it was identified as xylulose 5-P. The activation of protein phosphatase by xylulose 5-P showed a highly sigmoidal saturation curve. The rate of formation of xylulose 5-P in the perfused liver showed a lag period of approximately 2 min, and after 4 min its concentration reached 10 microM, the minimum concentration necessary for the activation of the protein phosphatase. We conclude that the mechanism of glucose-induced Fru 2,6-P2 synthesis was not due to increased Fru 6-P as generally thought but occurred as a result of dephosphorylation of Fru 6-P,2-kinase:Fru 2,6-Pase. Moreover, the dephosphorylation was enhanced by increased xylulose 5-P, which activated a specific protein phosphatase. The results suggest a mechanism for coordinated regulation of glycolysis and the pentose shunt pathway that is mediated by xylulose 5-P."
https://openalex.org/W1557233801,"The relations between the filling state of intracellular calcium stores that are regulated by the endoplasmic Ca(2+)-ATPase and trans plasma membrane sodium and calcium influx were investigated. The effects of specific inhibition of endoplasmic Ca(2+)-ATPase by thapsigargin, cyclopiazonic acid, and 2,5-di-(tert-butyl)-1,4-benzohydroquinone (BHQ) on cytosolic free sodium concentration ([Na+]i) and cytosolic free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) were evaluated in lymphocytes from healthy subjects using the fluorescent dyes sodium-binding benzofuran isophthalate and fura2. The specific inhibition of endoplasmic Ca(2+)-ATPase by thapsigargin, cyclopiazonic acid, or BHQ increased lymphocytic [Na+]i and [Ca2+]i. The thapsigargin-induced [Na+]i increase was abolished in the absence of external sodium, indicating that thapsigargin induced a trans plasma membrane sodium influx. In the absence of external calcium the thapsigargin-induced [Ca2+]i increase was significantly reduced, whereas the thapsigargin-induced [Na+]i increase remained the same. This finding indicates that the filling state of intracellular calcium pools rather than the elevation of [Ca2+]i per se regulates the plasma membrane permeability for sodium in lymphocytes. The inhibition of the tyrosine kinase by genistein inhibited the thapsigargin-induced increases of both [Na+]i and [Ca2+]i in lymphocytes. The present study shows that the filling state of intracellular thapsigargin-sensitive calcium pools regulates trans plasma membrane sodium and calcium influx via a tyrosine kinase-dependent pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2133842509,"We transfected COS cells with cDNA for rat cholecystokinin-A (CCK-A) and different CCK-B receptors and measured binding of 125I-CCK-8, [3H]L-364,718 and [3H]L-365,260 to characterize the different affinity states for each type of CCK receptor. Rat CCK-A and CCK-B receptors, canine CCK-B receptors and canine mutant CCK-B (M-CCK-B) receptors in which the leucine in position 355 was replaced by valine each existed in three different affinity states for CCK-8, high affinity, low affinity, and very low affinity. In rat CCK-A and probably CCK-B receptors, most were in the very low affinity state, whereas with canine CCK-B and M-CCK-B receptors, most were in the low affinity state. Studies with CCK receptor agonists, CCK-8, gastrin, and CCK-JMV-180, in conjunction with CCK receptor antagonists, L-364,718 and L-365,260, showed a different pattern of affinities for these ligands at the different CCK receptors. Thus, each transfected CCK receptor can exist in three different affinity states for CCK-8 and has a characteristic pattern of interaction with different ligands. This ability to exist in multiple affinity states is an intrinsic property of the CCK receptor molecule itself."
https://openalex.org/W1561015727,"The light chain of tetanus toxin is a zinc endoprotease that inhibits neurotransmitter release by selective proteolysis of the synaptic vesicle-associated protein synaptobrevin/vesicle-associated membrane protein. Cellubrevin is a homologue of synaptobrevin that is found in most cell types and is also a substrate for tetanus toxin. The lack of receptors for tetanus toxin on most cell types has made studies of tetanus toxin action in non-neuronal cells difficult. To characterize tetanus toxin effects in non-neuronal cells, a fusion protein consisting of the 254 amino-terminal amino acids of lethal factor (LF) of anthrax toxin and tetanus toxin light chain (LC) was prepared. This protein (LF-LC) inhibited evoked glycine release from primary spinal cord neurons at concentrations between 1.0 and 100 ng/ml. LF-LC was cytotoxic to RAW 264.7, ANA-1 cells (mouse macrophage cell lines), and Chinese hamster ovary cells in a dose-dependent manner. These effects required the presence of protective antigen, the receptor binding component of anthrax toxin. In contrast, LF-LC was not cytotoxic to RBL-2H3, Vero, or mouse hybridoma cell lines. Mutagenesis of conserved amino acids (His237 and Glu234) in the zinc-binding motif of LC resulted in fusion proteins having no biological activity. LF-LC did not inhibit regulated secretion of serotonin in RBL-2H3 cells or constitutive secretion in any non-neuronal cell lines as measured in several different assays. We suggest that the cytotoxic effects of LF-LC result from inhibition of a specific intracellular membrane fusion event mediated by cellubrevin."
https://openalex.org/W178922452,"The reduction of ribonucleotides is catalyzed by different enzymes in aerobic and anaerobic Escherichia coli, each with a different primary and quaternary structure. Here, we describe the allosteric regulation of the substrate specificity of the anaerobic ribonucleoside triphosphate reductase. The enzyme reduced ribonucleotides at a low basal rate. Reduction was stimulated up to 10-fold by an appropriate modulator (dGTP for ATP reduction, ATP for CTP and UTP reduction, and dTTP for GTP reduction). dGTP and dTTP inhibited the reduction of the incorrect substrate; dATP inhibited reduction of all four. From kinetic, effector binding, and competition experiments we conclude that the enzyme has two classes of sites, one that binds ATP and dATP and regulates pyrimidine ribonucleotide reduction (pyrimidine site), the other that binds dATP, dGTP, and dTTP and regulates purine ribonucleotide reduction (purine site). This model differs slightly from the model for the aerobic reductase, but the physiological consequences remain the same and explain how a single enzyme can provide a balanced supply of the four dNTPs. The similarity of a highly sophisticated control mechanism for the aerobic and anaerobic enzymes suggests that both arose by divergent evolution from a common ancestor, in spite of their different structures."
https://openalex.org/W2039847702,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae pet mutants, of complementation group G115, are deficient in mitochondrial ATPase and have properties indicative of defective F1. In this study we show that C287/LU1, a mutant belonging to group G115, is complemented by the yeast nuclear ATP3 gene coding for the gamma-subunit of the mitochondrial F1-ATPase. The amino-terminal sequence of the mature gamma-subunit matches the sequence encoded by ATP3 starting with the 34th amino acid confirming the identity of the gene, and earlier evidence indicating that this F1 component is synthesized as a precursor with a long amino-terminal extension. The properties of the mitochondrial ATPase have been studied in C287/LU1 with an Ala273–>Val substitution in the carboxyl-terminal region of the gamma-subunit and in W303 delta ATP3, a mutant lacking the gamma-subunit as a result of a deletion in ATP3. Both strains have negligible ATPase activity but near normal concentrations of the alpha- and beta-subunits of F1. In W303 delta ATP3, the subunits do not form a stable F1 oligomer nor are they firmly associated with F0. This is not true of C287/LU1, which was found to assemble an F1-F0 complex. These data indicate that the yeast gamma-subunit has dual functions, one in catalysis of ATP hydrolysis/synthesis and the second in assembly/stability of F1."
https://openalex.org/W1586716828,"The kinetic mechanism of super high affinity [3H]oxotremorine M binding to porcine m2 muscarinic receptors expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells was examined. In cell lines expressing low receptor numbers (10(4) binding sites/cell) and in high expression (10(6) sites/cell) cell lines treated with cholate, [3H]oxotremorine M association and dissociation kinetics were monophasic. The reciprocal relaxation time for the association reaction was independent of [3H]oxotremorine M concentration and equaled the dissociation rate constant consistent with a special case for a mechanism involving a protein conformational change followed by ligand binding. Membranes from high expression cell lines and porcine atrial membranes showed complex kinetic behavior. Two kinetic phases were observed for [3H]oxotremorine M association, and both reciprocal relaxation times were independent of ligand concentration. The number of kinetic phases and their relative amplitudes seen in dissociation experiments were dependent on whether dissociation was initiated by dilution or by addition of unlabeled ligand(s) as well as on the fractional saturation of the receptor. Computer simulations of the data led to a model consistent with the existence of asymmetric receptor dimers as well as monomers and the ligand-dependent interconversion of fully occupied dimers and monomers."
https://openalex.org/W1509839595,"Procyclic forms of Trypanosoma brucei were stably transformed with an expression vector containing a gene for a P-type ATPase (tba1) cloned from T. brucei genomic DNA. Transformation with this gene resulted specifically in a 4-5-fold increase in the cellular Ca(2+)-ATPase activity. Subcellular fractionation studies revealed this increase to be enriched in the microsomal fraction. There was no detectable change in the plasma membrane Ca(2+)-ATPase activity of the transformants. Western blot analysis of subcellular fractions using antibodies raised against the recombinant tba1 gene product also demonstrated a significant enrichment of a protein with a M(r) of 115,000 in the microsomal fraction of transformed cells. This protein was not detected in purified plasma membranes. Significantly, the increased Ca(2+)-ATPase activity possessed a high affinity for Ca2+. The activity was sensitive to the classical P-type ATPase inhibitor vanadate, anti-tba1 antibodies, as well as low concentrations of thapsigargin, a specific inhibitor of endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPases. Taken together, these data demonstrated that the tba1 gene codes for a high affinity Ca(2+)-ATPase of the endoplasmic reticulum, with properties similar to those reported for the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum family of Ca2+ pumps from higher eukaryotes. In addition, these results have identified the tba1 gene product as potentially important element, in conjunction with the mitochondrial membrane potential and the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump, in the pathways of cellular Ca2+ homeostasis in these protozoans."
https://openalex.org/W1536234382,"The metabolism of variously labeled [13C]- and [14C]glucoses, used at a physiological concentration (5 mM), has been studied in isolated rabbit kidney tubules both in the absence and the presence of NH4Cl. When present as sole exogenous substrate, glucose was metabolized at high rates and converted not only into CO2 and lactate but also, in contrast to a previous conclusion of Krebs (Krebs, H.A. (1935) Biochem. J. 29, 1951-1969), into glutamine. Absolute fluxes through enzymes of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis and of enzymes of three different cycles operating simultaneously were assessed by using a novel model describing reactions of glucose metabolism in conjunction with the 13C NMR and, to a lesser extent, the radioactive data obtained. The presence of NH4Cl (5 mM) caused a large stimulation of glucose removal and a large increase in lactate, glutamine, and glycerol 3-phosphate accumulation. Under this condition, the stimulation of glutamine synthesis was accompanied not by an activation of citrate synthesis but by an inhibition of flux through alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. The resulting depletion of citric acid cycle intermediates was compensated by anaplerosis at the level of pyruvate carboxylase. The futile cycle involving oxaloacetate, phosphoenolpyruvate, and pyruvate, which was intense in the presence of glucose alone, was greatly stimulated by the addition of NH4Cl."

Assays for recombinational DNA repair and LexA coprotease activities identify Glu154 as the only one of these 8 residues which is critical to RecA function. Several other mutations observed at nearby residues support the identity of Glu154 as the most important of the 14 residues in the area defined by Pro151 to Met164. In addition, Gly157 and Glu158 appear to be hot spots for the occurrence of mutation-induced constitutive coprotease activity."
https://openalex.org/W1593503582,"The murine urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) gene has been isolated and its complete nucleotide sequence established. The gene is organized into seven exons comprising 9.5% of the 13,207-base pair region that spans the interval between the transcription initiation and polyadenylation sites. The region upstream of the transcription initiation site lacks TATA- or CCAAT-like elements but is flanked by a G+C-rich region, which contains a number of potential regulatory elements including Sp1 and AP1 binding motifs. The close association of both Sp1 and AP1 sites within the proximal promoter region is consistent with the observation that the murine uPAR gene is inducible by phorbol esters. The major functional domains of the encoded protein, including the signal peptide, three cysteine-rich internal repeats, and the glycolipid anchor attachment motif, are encoded by separate exons. Based on the organization of the murine uPAR gene and the distribution of protein domains within the exons in the Ly-6 family of genes, it appears that the uPAR gene evolved secondarily to two internal duplication events within a Ly-6-like ancestral gene. The cloned and sequenced murine uPAR gene will be a valuable tool in understanding the regulation and biological roles of uPAR in that it will permit detailed studies of gene expression and uPAR-dependent processes in vitro, as well as the generation of both gain-of-function and loss-of-function mutants in transgenic mice."
https://openalex.org/W1557473573,"The influence of the monovalent cations on the UV-visible spectra of the methylamine dehydrogenase (MADH) from bacterium W3A1 was investigated. The spectra for the oxidized and 1- and 2-electron-reduced forms, unperturbed by bound cations, were obtained for the enzyme, and the extinction coefficients for these forms were determined. The binding of the following cations was investigated: Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+, Cs+, NH4+, (CH3)3NH+, and (CH3)4N+. It was shown that each cation produced unique spectral changes, some of which were pH-dependent. Except for NH4+, all spectral changes produced by binding of the monovalent cations can be explained by assuming two different binding sites in MADH (type I and type II sites). Na+ and K+ displayed monophasic binding to the type II site, (CH3)3NH+ and (CH3)4N+ displayed monophasic binding to the type I site, and Li+, Rb+, and Cs+ displayed either monophasic or biphasic binding to one or both sites depending on pH. The pH dependence for binding to the two sites is different, i.e. plots of log(Kd) versus pH have negative slopes approximately 1 for the type II site, whereas the negative slope is significantly less than 1 (0.6-0.8) for the type I site. This difference leads to pH-dependent changes in spectral features produced by binding of Li+, Rb+, and Cs+. The spectral changes seen during titrations with NH+4 were unlike those seen for any other cation. The binding of NH+4 was biphasic, and the spectra produced in each phase were unaffected by pH. It is assumed that this cation binds to the tryptophan tryptophylquinone cofactor to produce the iminoquinone in the first phase and then binds to the type I monovalent cation binding site in the second phase. It is suggested that binding of NH+4 (and CH3NH+3) to the type I site is a prelude to binding to the cofactor."
https://openalex.org/W1530982459,"Abstract Recent studies have shown that the Escherichia coli F plasmid-encoded traI gene product (TraIp), also known as DNA helicase I, catalyzes the formation of the site- and strand-specific nick that initiates F plasmid DNA transfer. Scission of the phosphodiester bond at the nic site within the origin of transfer (oriT) is accompanied by the covalent attachment of TraIp to the 5'-phosphate of the nicked DNA strand. This mechanism suggests that TraIp may also be capable of catalyzing a DNA ligation reaction using the energy stored in the protein-DNA intermediate. To test this possibility, an in vitro assay was designed that utilized short single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides of different lengths derived from the region within oriT that spanned the nic site. Purified TraIp was capable of efficiently cleaving single-stranded DNA that contained a nic site, and upon cleavage, the protein became covalently linked to the 5'-end of the nic site. When TraIp was incubated with two oligonucleotides of different length that contained the nic site, there was formation of novel recombinant products resulting from a TraIp-catalyzed cleavage/ligation reaction. Furthermore, the cleavage and ligation reactions were both sequence-specific. These data suggest that TraIp plays an important role in the initiation and termination of conjugative DNA transfer."
https://openalex.org/W1576517657,"We have cloned a human cDNA encoding for a novel transmembrane protein from a bladder carcinoma cell line (HT-1376) cDNA library. Sequence analysis of this clone revealed an open reading frame of 2,691 bases encoding a protein of 896 amino acids. Sequence comparison showed that this clone has significantly homology to desmocollins, intracellular adhesion molecules belonging to the cadherin superfamily. This protein consists of a signal peptide of 30 amino acids, a precursor segment of 105 amino acids, and a mature protein of 761 amino acids. We expressed this cDNA clone in COS1 cells and found that the predicted cell adhesion molecule remained in the membrane fraction. Antibodies recognizing the predicted mature adhesion molecule of the protein stained antigens along the cell boundaries of both HT-1376 cells and normal human keratinocytes resembling the pattern of desmosome localization. These findings suggest that our clone might be a new member of the desmocollin family, and we have tentatively called this clone human desmocollin type 4."
https://openalex.org/W1542692642,"Abstract Phorbol esters stimulate the phosphorylation of the insulin receptor on discrete serine and threonine residues in intact cells. Phosphorylation of the insulin receptor cytoplasmic domain on serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues regulates receptor tyrosine kinase activity and signaling. In these studies, we demonstrate that phorbol ester treatment of intact COS-1 cells transiently expressing the human insulin receptor stimulates phosphorylation of serine 1327 within the carboxyl-terminal tail of the insulin receptor beta subunit. Phosphopeptide maps of wild-type (Ser1327) and mutant (Ala1327) human insulin receptors revealed the absence of a single phosphopeptide in the Ala1327 receptors when compared with wild-type receptors from phorbol ester-treated cells. Phosphoamino acid analysis revealed phosphoserine within the phosphopeptide from wild-type receptors that is absent in the Ala1327 receptor. The synthetic peptide 1327S (KRSYEEHIPYTHMNGGKK) corresponding to amino acids 1325-1342 of the human insulin receptor is phosphorylated on serine by protein kinase C. After digestion with trypsin, the phosphorylated synthetic peptide comigrated with the serine-phosphorylated peptide isolated from wild-type insulin receptors that was absent from the Ala1327 mutant. Ser1327 is proximal to autophosphorylation sites Tyr1328 and Tyr1334. The potential effects of serine phosphorylation at position 1327 on subsequent phosphorylation of these tyrosines by the insulin receptor kinase were examined using synthetic peptides. The chemically modified peptide 1327S(P) was synthesized with the stoichiometric addition of phosphate to the side chain hydroxyl of a serine corresponding to position 1327 of the insulin receptor. Kinetic analysis revealed that the addition of phosphate to the serine improved substrate recognition by the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase almost 2-fold. The average Km was 1.44 mM for the peptide 1327S(P) versus 2.64 mM for peptide 1327S. However, when compared with the unphosphorylated control peptide, 1327S, the serine-phosphorylated peptide 1327S(P) also reduced the Vmax of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase 53%. Radiosequence analysis revealed that the chemical addition of phosphate to the serine in peptide 1327S(P) inhibited insulin receptor-catalyzed phosphorylation of the tyrosine on 1327S(P) corresponding to Tyr1334 but not of the tyrosine corresponding to Tyr1328. These data suggest that the juxtaposition of a serine phosphorylation site adjacent to receptor tyrosine phosphorylation sites provides the potential for regulation of insulin receptor autophosphorylation and signaling through its carboxyl-terminal tail."
https://openalex.org/W1565628545,"The 106-amino acid sequence motifs of spectrin have been suggested to fold into stable structural domains, consisting mostly of coiled coils of triple helices. With the advent of molecular biology and biophysical techniques, structural studies of these spectrin 106-amino acid structural domains became approachable. However, one of the difficulties in such an approach is determination of the correct phasing of the structural domains, which may or may not coincide with the phasing of the sequence motifs. Proper identification of the domain phasing is vital to the construction of stable spectrin domains for molecular studies. A previously published phasing shift for Drosophila alpha-spectrin indicated a downstream phase-shift of 26 amino acids for the structural domain (Winograd, E., Hume, D., and Branton, D. (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 88, 10788-10791). Using this phase-shift, we prepared a recombinant spectrin peptide with the sequence from residue 49 to residue 155 of human erythrocyte alpha-spectrin and found this peptide to be unstable relative to other peptides that we prepared. Using several other recombinant alpha-spectrin peptides and following the protease digestion approach, we digested spectrin peptides with elastase and chymotrypsin and analyzed the amino acid sequence of the digestive products. We provide the first experimental evidence in identifying the first amino acid residue of the first spectrin domain in human erythrocyte alpha-spectrin as residue 52 (Ser)."
https://openalex.org/W1547247409,"Abstract We present a mathematical model for calculating most reaction rates of glycolysis, gluconeogenesis and citric acid cycle in mammalian cells. The model also includes cycles such as the phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)-->pyruvate-->oxaloacetate-->PEP cycle and the pyruvate-->acetyl-CoA-->citrate-->citric acid cycle-->oxaloacetate-->PEP--> pyruvate cycle. The model, which does not require steady state conditions, is based on a set of equations, each one describing the fates of a given carbon of a selected intermediate. These fates are expressed as ratios of integrated transfer of this carbon to corresponding carbons in subsequent metabolites. At each bifurcation, the sum of all proportions adds up to 1. Among several calculation routes to determine a proportion value, we chose the one that was based on the most reliable parameter determined experimentally. The data introduced in the model are the micrograms of atom of traced carbon measured on each carbon of a number of products (corrected for natural tracer abundance). These incorporations can be measured by 13C NMR, gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy, or 14C counting. Thanks to its flexibility, this model can be applied to data obtained with substrates other than glucose under many experimental conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1591719457,"The N-terminal epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like module in factor X binds a single Ca2+ with low affinity (Kd = 2.2 mM). When it is linked to the gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla)-containing module, however, the affinity increases approximately 20-fold (Kd = 120 microM), indicating an interaction between the two modules and making the site in the N-terminal EGF-like module essentially saturated at physiological Ca2+ concentrations. We have now used the thioredoxin system to probe Ca(2+)-induced conformational changes and interaction between modules in the light chain of factor X. Thioredoxin, in conjunction with thioredoxin reductase and NADPH, allows direct measurements of the rate and extent of disulfide bond reduction. Most disulfide bonds accessible to the reducing agent were found to be located in the light chain of the protein. Moreover, those disulfide bonds that were resistant to reduction by thioredoxin in the presence of Ca2+, but were readily reduced in the absence of the metal ion, were located in the N-terminal EGF-like module and in the Gla module, whereas disulfide bonds in the C-terminal EGF-like module appeared to be equally accessible whether Ca2+ was present or not. Comparison of the rate of disulfide bond reduction in the isolated modules with that in mixtures of modules indicated that a Ca(2+)-dependent interaction occurred between the Gla and the N-terminal EGF-like module. This interaction was mediated by the C-terminal alpha-helical part of the Gla module. The affinity between the modules was low and could not be determined accurately owing to competing equilibria, presumably Ca(2+)-dependent aggregation of the isolated Gla module. By comparing the rates of disulfide bond reduction in Gla module-containing fragments before and after decarboxylation of Gla, we could demonstrate that Ca2+ binding to sites in the Gla module as well as to the single site in the EGF-like module contribute to the interaction between the two modules."
https://openalex.org/W1493838041,"We demonstrate that the previously observed stabilizing effect by the enzyme rhodanese of the oligomeric structure of Cpn60 is general and can be provided by six other proteins that can interact with Cpn60. All these substrate proteins, which include examples that are monomeric, as well as oligomeric polypeptides in their native states, were shown previously to be assisted in their refolding by the chaperonin. Strikingly, during the disassembly of Cpn60 in the presence of any of the substrate proteins, significant amounts of intermediates were detected. Furthermore, unfolded substrate proteins induce the reassembly of tetradecameric Cpn60 from monomers, and binding of each substrate protein stabilizes Cpn60 quaternary structure."
https://openalex.org/W1653081612,"The anaerobic Escherichia coli ribonucleotide reductase (class III reductase) responsible for the synthesis of the deoxyribonucleotides required for anaerobic DNA replication contains an oxygen-sensitive glycyl radical (Gly-681) suggesting involvement of radical chemistry in catalysis. The amino acid sequence of this enzyme completely differs from that of earlier described aerobic class I (prototype, aerobic E. coli) and class II (prototype, Lactobacillus leichmanii) reductases that use radical chemistry but employ other means for radical generation. Here, we study the interaction between the anaerobic E. coli reductase with the 5'-triphosphates of 2'-chloro-2'-deoxycytidine, 2'-fluoro-2'-deoxycytidine, and 2'-azido-2'-deoxycytidine (N3CTP), which are mechanism-based inhibitors of class I and II reductases and, on interaction with these enzymes, decompose to base, inorganic di(tri)phosphate and 2'-methylene-3(2H)-furanone. Also, with the anaerobic E. coli reductase, the 2'-substituted nucleotides act as mechanism-based inhibitors and decompose. N3CTP scavenges the glycyl radical of the enzyme similar to the interaction of N3CDP with the tyrosyl radical of class I enzymes. However, we found no evidence for a new transient radical species as is the case with class I enzymes. Our results suggest that the chemistry at the nucleotide level for the reduction of ribose by class III enzymes is similar to the chemistry employed by class I and II enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1555569515,"Factor J (FJ) is a cationic glycoprotein with inhibitory activity in C1, the first component of the classical complement pathway. This study demonstrates that FJ is able to regulate the activity of the alternative complement pathway. FJ inhibits the generation of fluid-phase and cell-bound alternative pathway C3 convertase, C3b,Bb (C3-cleaving enzyme). Thus, FJ interferes with the generation of alternative pathway C3 convertase when sheep erythrocytes bearing antibody and activated C3 and C4 (EAC4b,3b) are incubated with the individual complement components, factors B, D, and P. FJ accelerates the decay of C3 convertase with a time course similar to that of factor H, and when both regulators are present together, the decay of enzyme activity is faster than when they are added separately. Furthermore, FJ is able to inhibit the cleavage of C3 by factor B in a fluid-phase assay. FJ prevents the initiation of alternative pathway activation in stabilized with well known activators of alternative pathway C3 convertase such as C3 nephritic factor (an autoantibody against alternative pathway C3 convertase), cobra venom factor, and rabbit erythrocytes. In these systems, FJ has no effect on C3 convertase stabilized by rabbit erythrocytes or cobra venom factor. In contrast, FJ promotes the dissociation of C3 convertase stabilized by C3 nephritic factor, but with much lower efficiency than in preventing initiation. Direct interaction of FJ with individual components of C3 convertase was shown by a solid-phase binding assay using plates coated with C3, C3b, B, Bb, or FJ. FJ inhibitory activity in the alternative pathway can be modulated by polyanions like heparin. FJ-mediated inhibition in the alternative complement pathway can be modified by surface interactions, as occurs during alternative pathway C3 convertase activation. Thus, when FJ is adsorbed by and eluted from hydroxylapatite and reverse-phase columns, its inhibitory effect on more stabilized systems is lost. This loss of inhibitory activity is fully reversed when FJ is rechromatographed on heparin-Sepharose or Sepharose columns. Taking into account these data, FJ may be included in the group of highly charged molecules that inhibit the activation of classical and alternative complement pathways (i.e. eosinophil major basic protein, protamine, and heparin)."
https://openalex.org/W107967715,"Our objective was to develop a stable isotopic method to measure the synthesis rates of retinol-binding protein (RBP) and transthyretin (TTR). Both proteins were isolated from human and pig plasma by sequential immunoprecipitation and purified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions. Both human and pig anti-RBP precipitates contained a peptide (TTR2) that had a molecular mass that was similar but not identical to that of TTR subunit. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of porcine TTR2 was highly but not completely homologous with porcine TTR. Human TTR2 showed no homology with TTR but was completely homologous with an internal sequence of human fibrinogen alpha chain. To measure the fractional rates of synthesis (FRS) of these peptides, six infant pigs were infused with [2H3]leucine at a constant rate for 6 h, and the amount of [2H3]leucine incorporated into the proteins was measured by negative chemical ionization gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The plateau isotope ratio of plasma very low density lipoprotein apoB-100-bound leucine was used to estimate the isotopic enrichment of hepatic protein synthetic precursor pool. The mean FRS (% h +/- S.E.) of TTR (1.97 +/- 0.13) and RBP (3.89 +/- 0.07) were significantly different. The FRS of TTR2 was low (0.31 +/- 0.19) relative to that of RBP and TTR. Thus, three different peptides with different turnover rates seem to be involved in the transport of retinol."
