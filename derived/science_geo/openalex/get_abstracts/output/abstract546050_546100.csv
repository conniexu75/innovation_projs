https://openalex.org/W2193413657,"Long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) can regulate the transcription of inflammatory genes and thus may represent a new group of inflammatory mediators with a potential pathogenic role in inflammatory diseases. Here, our genome-wide transcriptomic data show that TNF-α stimulation caused upregulation of 171 lincRNAs and down-regulation of 196 lincRNAs in murine intestinal epithelial cells in culture. One of the up-regulated lincRNAs, lincRNA-Cox2, is an early-responsive lincRNA induced by TNF-α through activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. Knockdown of lincRNA-Cox2 resulted in reprogramming of the gene expression profile in intestinal epithelial cells in response to TNF-α stimulation. Specifically, lincRNA-Cox2 silencing significantly (P < 0.05) enhanced the transcription of Il12b, a secondary late-responsive gene induced by TNF-α. Mechanistically, lincRNA-Cox2 promoted the recruitment of the Mi-2/nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (Mi2/NuRD) repressor complex to the Il12b promoter region. Recruitment of the Mi-2/NuRD complex was associated with decreased H3K27 acetylation and increased H3K27 dimethylation at the Il12b promoter region, which might contribute to Il12b trans-suppression by lincRNA-Cox2. Thus, our data demonstrate a novel mechanism of epigenetic modulation by lincRNA-Cox2 on Il12b transcription, supporting an important role for lincRNAs in the regulation of intestinal epithelial inflammatory responses.—Tong, Q., Gong, A.-Y., Zhang, X.-T., Lin, C., Ma, S., Chen, J., Hu, G., Chen, X.-M.

https://openalex.org/W2173233184,"Mitochondrial fission is a crucial cellular process mediated by the mechanoenzymatic GTPase, dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1). During mitochondrial division, Drp1 is recruited from the cytosol to the outer mitochondrial membrane by one, or several, integral membrane proteins. One such Drp1 partner protein, mitochondrial fission factor (Mff), is essential for mitochondrial division, but its mechanism of action remains unexplored. Previous studies have been limited by a weak interaction between Drp1 and Mff in vitro. Through refined in vitro reconstitution approaches and multiple independent assays, we show that removal of the regulatory variable domain (VD) in Drp1 enhances formation of a functional Drp1-Mff copolymer. This protein assembly exhibits greatly stimulated cooperative GTPase activity in solution. Moreover, when Mff was anchored to a lipid template, to mimic a more physiologic environment, significant stimulation of GTPase activity was observed with both WT and ΔVD Drp1. Contrary to recent findings, we show that premature Drp1 self-assembly in solution impairs functional interactions with membrane-anchored Mff. Instead, dimeric Drp1 species are selectively recruited by Mff to initiate assembly of a functional fission complex. Correspondingly, we also found that the coiled-coil motif in Mff is not essential for Drp1 interactions, but rather serves to augment cooperative self-assembly of Drp1 proximal to the membrane. Taken together, our findings provide a mechanism wherein the multimeric states of both Mff and Drp1 regulate their collaborative interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2219072828,"Multiple isoforms of the mitochondrial fission GTPase dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) arise from the alternative splicing of its single gene-encoded pre-mRNA transcript. Among these, the longer Drp1 isoforms, expressed selectively in neurons, bear unique polypeptide sequences within their GTPase and variable domains, known as the A-insert and the B-insert, respectively. Their functions remain unresolved. A comparison of the various biochemical and biophysical properties of the neuronally expressed isoforms with that of the ubiquitously expressed, and shortest, Drp1 isoform (Drp1-short) has revealed the effect of these inserts on Drp1 function. Utilizing various biochemical, biophysical, and cellular approaches, we find that the A- and B-inserts distinctly alter the oligomerization propensity of Drp1 in solution as well as the preferred curvature of helical Drp1 self-assembly on membranes. Consequently, these sequences also suppress Drp1 cooperative GTPase activity. Mitochondrial fission factor (Mff), a tail-anchored membrane protein of the mitochondrial outer membrane that recruits Drp1 to sites of ensuing fission, differentially stimulates the disparate Drp1 isoforms and alleviates the autoinhibitory effect imposed by these sequences on Drp1 function. Moreover, the differential stimulatory effects of Mff on Drp1 isoforms are dependent on the mitochondrial lipid, cardiolipin (CL). Although Mff stimulation of the intrinsically cooperative Drp1-short isoform is relatively modest, CL-independent, and even counter-productive at high CL concentrations, Mff stimulation of the much less cooperative longest Drp1 isoform (Drp1-long) is robust and occurs synergistically with increasing CL content. Thus, membrane-anchored Mff differentially regulates various Drp1 isoforms by functioning as an allosteric effector of cooperative GTPase activity.

The opposing processes of membrane fission and fusion govern mitochondrial dynamics in eukaryotic cells (1Chan D.C. Fusion and fission: interlinked processes critical for mitochondrial health.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2012; 46: 265-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). Mediated by evolutionarily well conserved GTPases of the dynamin superfamily, the constant flux of mitochondria between fused and fragmented states is essential for the maintenance of mitochondrial size, shape, and distribution (2Labbé K.

However, a cytosolic DRP, dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1 in mammals/Dnm1p in yeast), catalyzes the apparent concerted fission of both membranes. Nevertheless, three different adaptor proteins, namely fission factor 1 (Fis1), mitochondrial fission factor (Mff), and mitochondrial division proteins of 49 and 51 kDa (MiD49/51) that are each TMD-anchored in the mitochondrial outer membrane, have been implicated in Drp1 recruitment to sites of ensuing membrane fission (3Losón O.C.

In yeast, Mdv1p and Caf4p function as adaptors for the essential interactions of Fis1p with Dnm1p. However, mammalian orthologs of these adaptor proteins do not exist. Conserved Fis1 is paradoxically found dispensable for Drp1 mitochondrial recruitment in mammalian cells (3Losón O.C. Song Z. Chen H. Chan D.C.

Among these, MiD49/51 are found exclusively at the mitochondria, whereas Mff (and Fis1) are also found on peroxisomes, which likewise depend on Drp1 for fission. Thus, Mff appears to function as a universal effector of Drp1 recruitment toward mitochondrial and peroxisomal fission in mammalian cells (5Otera H. Wang C. Cleland M.M. Setoguchi K. Yokota S.

Cell. 2015; 26: 4466-4477Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Further complicating this scenario, mammalian cells, unlike yeast, express multiple splice variants (isoforms) of Drp1 ranging from 699 to 755 residues that arise from the alternative splicing of its pre-mRNA transcript (15Uo T. Dworzak J. Kinoshita C. Inman D.M. Kinoshita Y. Horner P.J. Morrison R.S. Drp1 levels constitutively regulate mitochondrial dynamics and cell survival in cortical neurons.Exp.

Cyclin-dependent kinases regulate splice-specific targeting of dynamin-related protein 1 to microtubules.J. Cell Biol. 2013; 201: 1037-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Encoded in its entirety by 20 exons, the alternative splicing of exons 3, 16, and 17, and several variations therein, gives rise to multiple Drp1 isoforms (15Uo T. Dworzak J. Kinoshita C. Inman D.M.

Neurol. 2009; 218: 274-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Among these, the full-length isoform (755 aa; hereafter referred to as Drp1-long) expresses exon 3 in addition to both exons 16 and 17. The exon 3-encoded polypeptide segment (13 aa), referred to as the “A-insert,” localizes to a loop within the Drp1 N-terminal GTPase domain (see Fig. 1A), and is expressed as part of Drp1 selectively in the postmitotic neurons of the brain (15Uo T.

Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 779-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). On the other hand, shorter isoforms of Drp1 that lack the A-insert but alternatively exclude either exon 16 or 17, or both, are variably expressed in other cell types (15Uo T. Dworzak J. Kinoshita C.

Exons 16 and 17 together encode for the “B-insert” segment that constitutes a large part of the unstructured variable domain (VD) located between the middle domain and GED at the base of the Drp1 molecule (see Fig. 1A) (18Fröhlich C. Grabiger S. Schwefel D. Faelber K. Rosenbaum E. Mears J. Rocks O. Daumke O. Structural insights into oligomerization and mitochondrial remodelling of dynamin 1-like protein.EMBO J. 2013; 32: 1280-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The Drp1 isoform that lacks the A-insert but contains the B-insert in its entirety (736 or 742 aa; also known as isoform 1; hereafter referred to as Drp1-B-only) is also found enriched in neurons, whereas the shortest Drp1 isoform lacking both A-inserts and B-inserts (699 aa; also known as isoform 3; hereafter referred to as Drp1-short) is expressed ubiquitously. In contrast to Drp1-short, which has been widely studied and biochemically well characterized, very little is known about the A-insert-containing longer Drp1 variants, which have thus far only been partially characterized (19Yoon Y.

Regardless, an interaction of functional consequence between Drp1 and Mff has not been established in vitro (5Otera H. Wang C. Cleland M.M. Setoguchi K. Yokota S. Youle R.J. Mihara K.

Stable Mff-Drp1 interactions have been realized, thus far, only in the presence of chemical cross-linkers (5Otera H. Wang C. Cleland M.M. Setoguchi K. Yokota S. Youle R.J. Mihara K.

Chem. 2015; 291: 478-492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar)). Previously, a solubilized version of Mff lacking its TMD (MffΔTM) was shown not to significantly affect Drp1 GTPase activity, suggesting that mammalian Mff does not function as a classical effector of Drp1 (13Koirala S. Guo Q. Kalia R. Bui H.T. Eckert D.M. Frost A. Shaw J.M. Interchangeable adaptors regulate mitochondrial dynamin assembly for membrane scission.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: E1342-E1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), much unlike the reported effect of Mdv1p on Dnm1p activity in yeast (6Bui H.T. Shaw J.M. Dynamin assembly strategies and adaptor proteins in mitochondrial fission.Curr. Biol. 2013; 23: R891-R899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The ability of different Drp1 isoforms to differentially utilize various Mff splice variants as effectors, however, remains unexplored. In this study, utilizing a host of sophisticated biochemical, biophysical, and cellular approaches, we have meticulously compared the various activities of Drp1-long with those of Drp1-short (16Strack S. Wilson T.J. Cribbs J.T. Cyclin-dependent kinases regulate splice-specific targeting of dynamin-related protein 1 to microtubules.J. Cell Biol. 2013; 201: 1037-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In addition, we have also characterized the activities of Drp1 isoforms that alternatively bear only the A-insert (Drp1-A-only) or the B-insert (Drp1-B-only), respectively. We reveal that the A-insert functions to enhance the propensity of Drp1 to form cooperative, higher-order polymers in solution, whereas the B-insert functions antagonistically to curtail it. Regardless, the presence of either or both sequences in Drp1 drastically reduces basal and assembly-stimulated cooperative GTPase activities. We further reveal that the B-insert functions to regulate membrane curvature by selectively promoting Drp1 polymerization of a preferred, narrow helical geometry. On the other hand, the A-insert, in the absence of the B-insert, promotes polymers of highly variable, non-uniform geometry with no set curvature preference. In the absence of both A-inserts and B-inserts, Drp1 constitutes polymers of a uniformly large helical geometry. These data suggest that the differential oligomeric propensity and helical geometry of the various Drp1 isoforms may be uniquely tailored to the disparate mitochondrial size and distribution found in neuronal versus non-neuronal cell types. Using proteoliposomes reconstituted with full-length Mff, we show that Mff differentially stimulates the cooperative GTPase activities of Drp1-long and Drp1-short dependent on the mitochondrion-specific lipid, cardiolipin (CL). CL was previously shown to promote Drp1 self-assembly and cooperative GTPase activity on membranes (20Bustillo-Zabalbeitia I. Montessuit S. Raemy E. Basañez G. Terrones O. Martinou J.C. Specific interaction with cardiolipin triggers functional activation of dynamin-related protein 1.PLoS ONE. 2014; 9: e102738Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 21Macdonald P.J. Stepanyants N. Mehrotra N. Mears J.A. Qi X. Sesaki H. Ramachandran R. A dimeric equilibrium intermediate nucleates Drp1 reassembly on mitochondrial membranes for fission.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2014; 25: 1905-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Remarkably, the differential stimulation of Drp1-long and Drp1-short by Mff, in the absence or presence of CL, appears to be inversely correlated to the intrinsic propensity of the two Drp1 isoforms to form higher-order polymers in solution as well as in constituting enzymatically cooperative polymers on membranes. In other words, the higher the intrinsic oligomerization propensity of Drp1 in solution or its stimulated GTPase activity on membranes, the lower the extent of stimulation by Mff. Thus, Drp1 splice variants differentially utilize membrane-anchored Mff as an allosteric effector of cooperative GTPase activity. Drp1-short (699 aa; human isoform 3; accession number NP_005681.2) and Drp1-long (755 aa; full-length clone from rat (17Yoon Y. Pitts K.R. Dahan S.

Drp1-A-only (712 aa; 699 aa + 13-aa A-insert) and Drp1-B-only (742 aa; 755 aa − 13-aa A-insert) were constructed by swapping BamHI and MfeI restriction fragments between Drp1-short and Drp1-long (a unique MfeI site occurs upstream of the B-insert coding region within the Drp1 ORF). Drp1-B-only is equivalent to human Drp1 isoform 1 (736 aa) that lacks the 6 additional amino acid residues (594–599, see Fig. 1A) found in the VD of the rat clone. Human Drp1 isoform 1 exhibits similar enzymatic and assembly properties to Drp1-B-only under our experimental conditions and is not further characterized here (data not shown; also see the accompanying manuscript (54Clinton R.W.

After buffer exchange by dialysis in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT, Mff and MffΔTM were excised from GST using PreScission Protease (GE Healthcare Lifesciences) or Pierce HRV 3C protease (Life Technologies) using prescribed procedures. All proteins were aliquoted in buffer containing 10% (v/v) glycerol and frozen at −80 °C prior to use. All lipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids Inc. (Alabaster, AL). Liposomes were by prepared by extrusion (21 times) through 400-nm-pore-diameter polycarbonate membranes as described previously (21Macdonald P.J. Stepanyants N. Mehrotra N. Mears J.A. Qi X. Sesaki H. Ramachandran R. A dimeric equilibrium intermediate nucleates Drp1 reassembly on mitochondrial membranes for fission.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2014; 25: 1905-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Unless noted otherwise, liposomes contained 25 mol % bovine heart CL, 35 mol % 1,2-dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE), and 40 mol % 1,2-dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC). In liposomes containing less than 25 mol % CL, a corresponding mole fraction of DOPC was substituted for CL. For Trp-dansyl FRET measurements, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(5-dimethylamino-1-naphthalenesulfonyl) (ammonium salt; 18:1 dansyl-PE) at 10 mol % replaced an equivalent concentration of DOPC. For the sucrose gradient flotation assay, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl (rhodamine-labeled PE or RhPE) was incorporated as a fluorescent lipid tracer at 1 mol %, replacing an equivalent concentration of DOPC. Pure DOPS liposomes contain 100 mol % 1,2-dioleoylphosphatidylserine (DOPS). The basal and liposome assembly-stimulated GTPase activities of Drp1 were measured at 37 °C using a malachite green-based colorimetric assay as described previously (21Macdonald P.J. Stepanyants N.

Unless specified otherwise, the final Drp1 and total lipid concentrations were 0.5 and 150 μm, respectively. In experiments with externally added Mff, Mff at the indicated concentrations was preincubated with liposomes for 15 min at room temperature prior to the addition of Drp1 and an additional 15 min of incubation to promote Drp1 interactions. Unless noted otherwise, GTP was used at 1 mm final concentration. Solutions were warmed up to 37 °C for 3 min prior to initiating the GTPase reaction. The initial burst rate of GTP hydrolysis was fit to a linear equation to obtain the turnover number (kcat). Michaelis-Menten kinetics and constants (Km or K0.5) were determined using standard procedures. SEC-MALS measurements were performed at room temperature as described previously (21Macdonald P.J.

Briefly, Drp1 samples were each loaded at a concentration of 10 μm in a 500-μl volume onto a Superose 6 10/300 GL gel filtration column (GE Healthcare Lifesciences), pre-equilibrated in buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, and 1 mm DTT, and resolved at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min on an ÄKTAexplorerTM (GE Healthcare Lifesciences) liquid chromatography system. The resolved samples were then passed inline through tandem differential refractive index and light scattering detectors (Wyatt Technology, Santa Barbara, CA). Data were analyzed and molar mass profiles were determined using the ASTRA 6.1 software package (Wyatt Technology). All measurements were obtained at 25 °C using a Tecan Infinite M1000 PRO microplate reader. To detect Drp1- and Mff-membrane interactions, respectively, intrinsic Trp residues in Drp1 and full-length Mff were used as energy donors (D) for acceptor (A) dansyl-PE molecules incorporated in liposomes as described in detail elsewhere (21Macdonald P.J.

Recent studies have shown that adipose tissue hypoxia promotes an inflammatory phenotype in ATMs. However, our understanding of how hypoxia modulates the response of ATMs to free fatty acids within obese adipose tissue is limited. We examined the effects of hypoxia (1% O2) on the pro-inflammatory responses of human monocyte-derived macrophages to the saturated fatty acid palmitate. Compared with normoxia, hypoxia significantly increased palmitate-induced mRNA expression and protein secretion of IL-6 and IL-1β. Although palmitate-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress and nuclear factor κB pathway activation were not enhanced by hypoxia, hypoxia increased the activation of JNK and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling in palmitate-treated cells. Inhibition of JNK blocked the hypoxic induction of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, whereas knockdown of hypoxia-induced transcription factors HIF-1α and HIF-2α alone or in combination failed to reduce IL-6 and only modestly reduced IL-1β gene expression in palmitate-treated hypoxic macrophages. Enhanced pro-inflammatory cytokine production and JNK activity under hypoxia were prevented by inhibiting reactive oxygen species generation. In addition, silencing of dual-specificity phosphatase 16 increased normoxic levels of IL-6 and IL-1β and reduced the hypoxic potentiation in palmitate-treated macrophages. The secretome of hypoxic palmitate-treated macrophages promoted IL-6 and macrophage chemoattractant protein 1 expression in primary human adipocytes, which was sensitive to macrophage JNK inhibition.

https://openalex.org/W2179263923,"Obesity is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. C1q/TNF-related protein (CTRP)-1 is a poorly characterized adipokine that is up-regulated in association with ischemic heart disease. We investigated the role of CTRP1 in myocardial ischemia injury. CTRP1-knockout mice showed increased myocardial infarct size, cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and proinflammatory gene expression after I/R compared with wild-type (WT) mice. In contrast, systemic delivery of CTRP1 attenuated myocardial damage after I/R in WT mice. Treatment of cardiomyocytes with CTRP1 led to reduction of hypoxia-reoxygenation-induced apoptosis and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated expression of proinflammatory cytokines, which was reversed by inhibition of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) signaling. Treatment of cardiomyocytes with CTRP1 also resulted in the increased production of cAMP, which was blocked by suppression of S1P signaling. The antiapoptotic and anti-inflammatory actions of CTRP1 were cancelled by inhibition of adenylyl cyclase or knockdown of adiponectin receptor 1. Furthermore, blockade of S1P signaling reversed CTRP1-mediated inhibition of myocardial infarct size, apoptosis, and inflammation after I/R in vivo. These data indicate that CTRP1 protects against myocardial ischemic injury by reducing apoptosis and inflammatory response through activation of the S1P/cAMP signaling pathways in cardiomyocytes, suggesting that CTRP1 plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of ischemic heart disease."
https://openalex.org/W2276921622,"Introduction and naturalization of non-native species is one of the most important threats to global biodiversity. Birds have been widely introduced worldwide, but their impacts on populations, communities, and ecosystems have not received as much attention as those of other groups. This work is a global synthesis of the impact of nonnative birds on native ecosystems to determine (1) what groups, impacts, and locations have been best studied; (2) which taxonomic groups and which impacts have greatest effects on ecosystems, (3) how important are bird impacts at the community and ecosystem levels, and (4) what are the known benefits of nonnative birds to natural ecosystems. We conducted an extensive literature search that yielded 148 articles covering 39 species belonging to 18 families -18% of all known naturalized species. Studies were classified according to where they were conducted: Africa, Asia, Australasia, Europe, North America, South America, Islands of the Indian, of the Pacific, and of the Atlantic Ocean. Seven types of impact on native ecosystems were evaluated: competition, disease transmission, chemical, physical, or structural impact on ecosystem, grazing/ herbivory/ browsing, hybridization, predation, and interaction with other non-native species. Hybridization and disease transmission were the most important impacts, affecting the population and community levels. Ecosystem-level impacts, such as structural and chemical impacts were detected. Seven species were found to have positive impacts aside from negative ones. We provide suggestions for future studies focused on mechanisms of impact, regions, and understudied taxonomic groups."
https://openalex.org/W2218208517,"Light-driven ion-pumping rhodopsins are widely distributed in microorganisms and are now classified into the categories of outward H(+) and Na(+) pumps and an inward Cl(-) pump. These different types share a common protein architecture and utilize the photoisomerization of the same chromophore, retinal, to evoke photoreactions. Despite these similarities, successful pump-to-pump conversion had been confined to only the H(+) pump bacteriorhodopsin, which was converted to a Cl(-) pump in 1995 by a single amino acid replacement. In this study we report the first success of the reverse conversion from a Cl(-) pump to a H(+) pump. A novel microbial rhodopsin (MrHR) from the cyanobacterium Mastigocladopsis repens functions as a Cl(-) pump and belongs to a cluster that is far distant from the known Cl(-) pumps. With a single amino acid replacement, MrHR is converted to a H(+) pump in which dissociable residues function almost completely in the H(+) relay reactions. MrHR most likely evolved from a H(+) pump, but it has not yet been highly optimized into a mature Cl(-) pump."
https://openalex.org/W2248010505,"Recent studies have demonstrated that micro (mi)RNA molecules can be detected in the circulation and can serve as potential biomarkers of various diseases. This study used microarray analysis to identify aberrantly expressed circulating miRNAs in patients with type 1 autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) compared with healthy controls. Patients with well-documented and untreated AIH were selected from the National Hospital Organization (NHO)-AIH-liver-network database. They underwent blood sampling and liver biopsy with inflammation grading and fibrosis staging before receiving treatment. To further confirm the microarray data, circulating expression levels of miR-21 and miR-122 were quantified by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction in 46 AIH patients, 40 patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC), and 13 healthy controls. Consistent with the microarray data, serum levels of miR-21 were significantly elevated in AIH patients compared with CHC patients and healthy controls. miR-21 and miR-122 serum levels correlated with alanine aminotransferase levels. Circulating levels of miR-21 and miR-122 were significantly reduced in AIH patients with liver cirrhosis, and were inversely correlated with increased stages of fibrosis. By contrast, levels of circulating miR-21 showed a significant correlation with the histological grades of inflammation in AIH. We postulate that aberrantly expressed serum miRNAs are potential biomarkers of AIH and could be implicated in AIH pathogenesis. Alternations of miR-21 and miR-122 serum levels could reflect their putative roles in the mediation of inflammatory processes in AIH."
https://openalex.org/W2206465665,"Activation of the sympathetic nervous system by stress increases breast cancer metastasis in vivo. Preclinical studies suggest that stress activates β-adrenoceptors (βARs) to enhance metastasis from primary tumors and that β-blockers may be protective in breast cancer. However, the subtype of βAR that mediates this effect, as well as the signaling mechanisms underlying increased tumor cell dissemination, remain unclear. We show that the β2AR is the only functionally relevant βAR subtype in the highly metastatic human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231HM. β2AR activation results in elevated cAMP (formoterol pEC50 9.86 ± 0.32), increased intracellular Ca(2+) (formoterol pEC50 8.20 ± 0.33) and reduced phosphorylated ERK (pERK; formoterol pIC50 11.62 ± 0.31). We demonstrate that a highly amplified positive feedforward loop between the cAMP and Ca(2+) pathways is responsible for efficient inhibition of basal pERK. Importantly, activation of the β2AR increased invasion (formoterol area under the curve [AUC] relative to vehicle: 1.82 ± 0.36), which was dependent on the cAMP/Ca(2+) loop (formoterol AUC in the presence of 2'5'-dideoxyadenosine 0.64 ± 0.03, or BAPTA-AM 0.45 ± 0.23) but independent of inhibition of basal pERK1/2 (vehicle AUC with U0126 0.60 ± 0.30). Specifically targeting the positive feedforward cAMP/Ca(2+) loop may be beneficial for the development of therapeutics to slow disease progression in patients with breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2174462200,"Type 2 diabetes poses an increasing public health burden in South Africa (SA) with obesity as the main driver of the epidemic. Consumption of sugar sweetened beverages (SSBs) is linked to weight gain and reducing SSB consumption may significantly impact the prevalence of obesity and related diseases. We estimated the effect of a 20% SSB tax on the burden of diabetes in SA.We constructed a life table-based model in Microsoft Excel (2010). Consumption data from the 2012 SA National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, previously published own- and cross-price elasticities of SSBs and energy balance equations were used to estimate changes in daily energy intake and its projected impact on BMI arising from increased SSB prices. Diabetes relative risk and prevalent years lived with disability estimates from the Global Burden of Disease Study and modelled disease epidemiology estimates from a previous study were used to estimate the effect of the BMI changes on diabetes burden. Diabetes cost estimates were obtained from the South African Council for Medical Schemes. Over 20 years, a 20% SSB tax could reduce diabetes incident cases by 106 000 in women (95% uncertainty interval (UI) 70 000-142 000) and by 54 000 in men (95% UI: 33 000-80 000); and prevalence in all adults by 4.0% (95% UI: 2.7%-5.3%). Cumulatively over twenty years, approximately 21 000 (95% UI: 14 000-29 000) adult T2DM-related deaths, 374 000 DALYs attributed to T2DM (95% UI: 299 000-463 000) and over ZAR10 billion T2DM healthcare costs (95% UI: ZAR6.8-14.0 billion) equivalent to USD860 million (95% UI: USD570 million-USD1.2 billion) may be averted.Fiscal policy on SSBs has the potential to mitigate the diabetes epidemic in South Africa and contribute to the National Department of Health goals stated in the National NCD strategic plan."
https://openalex.org/W2174941367,"Background Adults with sickle cell anemia (HbSS) are inconsistently treated with hydroxyurea. Objectives We retrospectively evaluated the effects of elevating fetal hemoglobin with hydroxyurea on organ damage and survival in patients enrolled in our screening study between 2001 and 2010. Methods An electronic medical record facilitated development of a database for comparison of study parameters based on hydroxyurea exposure and dose. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00011648. Results Three hundred eighty-three adults with homozygous sickle cell disease were analyzed with 59 deaths during study follow-up. Cox regression analysis revealed deceased subjects had more hepatic dysfunction (elevated alkaline phosphatase, Hazard Ratio = 1.005, 95% CI 1.003–1.006, p<0.0.0001), kidney dysfunction (elevated creatinine, Hazard Ratio = 1.13, 95% CI 1.00–1.27, p = 0.043), and cardiopulmonary dysfunction (elevated tricuspid jet velocity on echocardiogram, Hazard Ratio = 2.22, 1.23–4.02, p = 0.0082). Sixty-six percent of subjects were treated with hydroxyurea, although only 66% of those received a dose within the recommended therapeutic range. Hydroxyurea use was associated with improved survival (Hazard Ratio = 0.58, 95% CI 0.34–0.97, p = 0.040). This effect was most pronounced in those taking the recommended dose of 15–35 mg/kg/day (Hazard Ratio 0.36, 95% CI 0.17–0.73, p = 0.0050). Hydroxyurea use was not associated with changes in organ function over time. Further, subjects with higher fetal hemoglobin responses to hydroxyurea were more likely to survive (p = 0.0004). While alkaline phosphatase was lowest in patients with the best fetal hemoglobin response (95.4 versus 123.6, p = 0.0065 and 96.1 versus 113.6U/L, p = 0.041 at first and last visits, respectively), other markers of organ damage were not consistently improved over time in patients with the highest fetal hemoglobin levels. Conclusions Our data suggest that adults should be treated with the maximum tolerated hydroxyurea dose, ideally before organ damage occurs. Prospective studies are indicated to validate these findings."
https://openalex.org/W2238445461,"Annexins are a family of proteins that bind to phospholipids in a calcium-dependent manner. Earlier studies implicated annexin A6 (AnxA6) to inhibit secretion and participate in the organization of the extracellular matrix. We recently showed that elevated AnxA6 levels significantly reduced secretion of the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin (FN). Because FN is directly linked to the ability of cells to migrate, this prompted us to investigate the role of AnxA6 in cell migration. Up-regulation of AnxA6 in several cell models was associated with reduced cell migration in wound healing, individual cell tracking and three-dimensional migration/invasion assays. The reduced ability of AnxA6-expressing cells to migrate was associated with decreased cell surface expression of αVβ3 and α5β1 integrins, both FN receptors. Mechanistically, we found that elevated AnxA6 levels interfered with syntaxin-6 (Stx6)-dependent recycling of integrins to the cell surface. AnxA6 overexpression caused mislocalization and accumulation of Stx6 and integrins in recycling endosomes, whereas siRNA-mediated AnxA6 knockdown did not modify the trafficking of integrins. Given our recent findings that inhibition of cholesterol export from late endosomes (LEs) inhibits Stx6-dependent integrin recycling and that elevated AnxA6 levels cause LE cholesterol accumulation, we propose that AnxA6 and blockage of LE cholesterol transport are critical for endosomal function required for Stx6-mediated recycling of integrins in cell migration.

Cell Res. 1987; 173: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), it is now well established that endosomes contribute to multiple aspects of cell migration and invasion (2Rainero E. Norman J.C.

This complex and multifunctional process requires a plethora of molecules along endo- and exocytic pathways, enabling the delivery of ECM, integrins, and signaling proteins to the cell surface. To orchestrate and coordinate this complexity, involvement of Rab and soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein (SNAP) receptor (SNARE) proteins together with cytoskeleton elements is well documented (3De Franceschi N.

Evidence for annexin A6-dependent plasma membrane remodelling of lipid domains.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2015; 172: 1677-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Furthermore, because cellular movement requires dynamic reorganization of membrane domains, lipids, in particular cholesterol, but also other less well known proteins participate. In this study, we show that a member of the annexin family, AnxA6, and most likely its ability to impact cellular cholesterol transport and distribution, regulate integrin cell surface expression and consequently cell migration. Annexins are evolutionarily conserved proteins that bind to acidic phospholipids in a calcium-dependent manner and have been described to regulate membrane trafficking events along endo- and exocytic pathways (5Gerke V. Creutz C.E. Moss S.E. Annexins: linking Ca2+ signalling to membrane dynamics.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 449-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). Several reports revealed links between AnxA6 and various aspects of cell migration. First, early studies identified AnxA6 as a potential receptor for fetuin-A and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (6Sakwe A.M. Koumangoye R. Goodwin S.J. Ochieng J.

Yamakawa N. Matsumoto I. Kimata K. Annexin 6 is a putative cell surface receptor for chondroitin sulfate chains.J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3309-3318PubMed Google Scholar). Second, we showed that membrane targeting of AnxA6 correlated with the stabilization of the cortical actin cytoskeleton (9Monastyrskaya K. Babiychuk E.B. Hostettler A. Wood P. Grewal T. Draeger A.

Chem. 2009; 284: 17227-17242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Third, reduced AnxA6 expression appeared to contribute to breast cancer progression by promoting the loss of functional cell-cell and/or cell-ECM contacts (10Sakwe A.M. Koumangoye R. Guillory B.

Cell Res. 2011; 317: 823-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Fourth, the scaffolding function of AnxA6 may alter the activity of receptors, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and downstream effector pathways, including the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade, which are well known to contribute to cancer cell motility and invasiveness (11Koese M.

Finally, we recently identified that elevated levels of AnxA6 cause a Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC1)-like phenotype, which is characterized by an accumulation of cholesterol in LEs. This was associated with reduced caveolin transport to the cell surface but also mislocalization of several SNARE proteins, including SNAP23 and Stx4 (14Cubells L. Vilà de Muga S. Tebar F. Wood P.

Both SNAP23 and Stx4 are normally engaged in the delivery of secretory vesicles to the cell surface; however, their mislocation upon AnxA6 overexpression inhibited exocytic pathways, including FN secretion (15Reverter M.

Cholesterol is considered indispensible for cell migration. The activity of Rac/Rho GTPases, which drive cellular movement, is sensitive to cholesterol levels and distribution in the plasma membrane (16Navarro-Lérida I. Sánchez-Perales S. Calvo M. Rentero C.

Hence, we hypothesized that AnxA6-induced alterations in the cellular distribution of cholesterol could be an additional mechanism affecting cell motility. The present study shows for the first time how elevation of AnxA6 levels interferes with cell migration. Mechanistically, this is caused by LE cholesterol accumulation in AnxA6-expressing cells, which leads to the mislocalization of Stx6, a SNARE protein that is essential for the cell surface delivery of integrins.

Cells were grown on coverslips, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, washed, permeabilized with 0.1% saponin for 10 min, blocked with 1% BSA for 5 min, and incubated with primary and secondary antibodies. Alternatively, cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min. In some experiments, cells were seeded onto FN-coated coverslips; therefore coverslips were washed twice with PBS, coated with poly-l-lysine (50 μg/ml) in PBS for 2 h, washed twice with PBS, incubated in 20 μg/ml FN for 3 h, and washed twice with PBS before use. Finally, samples were mounted in Mowiol, and cells were observed using a Leica DMI 6000B epifluorescence inverted microscope equipped with an HCX PLA Apo 63× oil immersion objective. Some images were captured with a Leica TCS SP5 laser scanning confocal microscope equipped with a DMI6000 inverted microscope, blue diode (405 nm), argon (458/476/488/496/514 nm), diode-pumped solid state (561 nm), HeNe (594/633 nm) lasers, and Apo 63× oil immersion objective lenses.

To quantify staining intensity, images were captured using identical microscope settings. Subcellular fractionation of CHO-WT and CHO-A6 membranes on discontinuous sucrose gradients was performed, and the distribution of Stx6, RE (VAMP3), trans-Golgi network (TGN)-Golgi (Golgin-97), and plasma membrane markers (Na+/K+-ATPase) was analyzed. The cholesterol content (percentage of total cellular cholesterol) of each fraction from both cell lines was determined using the AmplexTM Red Cholesterol Assay kit (Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Subcellular fractionation procedures for the isolation of Golgi membranes from CHO cells have been described in detail previously (27Cubells L. Vilà de Muga S. Tebar F. Bonventre J.V. Balsinde J.

Cells were washed in HBSS, incubated with sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (0.15 mg/ml for 10 min), and then washed with HBSS, 5 mm Tris. Cells were lysed and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Equal amounts of protein from the supernatant were incubated for 1 h with streptavidin beads to precipitate biotinylated proteins, which were analyzed by immunoblotting. Integrin recycling was measured as described previously (28Veale K.J. Offenhäuser C. Whittaker S.P. Estrella R.P. Murray R.Z.

In brief, cell surface biotin-labeled cells were incubated for an additional 30 min to allow internalization of surface biotinylated proteins (quadruplicates for each cell line). One plate was lysed, whereas the three other plates were washed twice in HBSS followed by two washes in PBS, 0.5 mm EDTA. The remaining surface biotin was removed by incubating cells with reduced l-glutathione buffer (50 mm reduced l-glutathione, 75 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 75 mm NaOH, 0.1% BSA). Reduced l-glutathione was neutralized with 10 mm iodoacetamide in HBSS. Cells from a second plate were then lysed, and the remaining two plates were incubated for 30 min in complete cell culture medium. One plate was lysed, whereas the other plate was incubated with reduced l-glutathione and iodoacetamide as described above to remove the surface biotin from recycled proteins. Multiscratch signaling assays were performed as described (29Timpson P. McGhee E.J. Morton J.P. von Kriegsheim A. Schwarz J.P. Karim S.A. Doyle B. Quinn J.A. Carragher N.O. Edward M. Olson M.F.

In brief, 5 × 105 cells were seeded onto 6-well plates and grown to 90% confluence. Using a 200-μl pipette tip, five vertical and five horizontal scratches were made, and lysates were prepared at 0, 30, and 60 min postscratch. Cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting for total and phosphorylated (Tyr(P)861) focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and (Tyr(P)527) Src. Cells were incubated in DMEM, 10% FCS with fluorescently labeled CTxB and STxB (CTxB-Cy5, 2 μg/ml; STxB-Cy3, 1 μg/ml) for 10 min at 37 °C. Non-internalized CTxB and STxB was removed, and cells were incubated for an additional 5–60 min before fixation. CHO cells were plated on FN-coated coverslips (20 mg/ml) for 24 h followed by incubation with α5 integrin antibody (PB1) (diluted 1:100 in complete Ham's F-12) for 1 h at 4 °C to allow the antibody to bind cell surface α5 integrin. Then samples were washed with prewarmed medium and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C to allow internalization of antibody-labeled α5 integrin. Cells were washed with PBS, fixed, and immunostained as described above. Cells were seeded on FN-coated plates (10 μg/ml for A431 and 20 μg/ml for CHO cells). Migration was monitored by time lapse video microscopy, and bright field images were acquired at a rate of 10 min/frame for 14 h. Cell migration (velocity) was measured using MtrackJ (ImageJ) (30Meijering E. Dzyubachyk O. Smal I.

Rat tail tendon collagen solution was prepared by the extraction of tendons with 0.5 m acetic acid (≈2 mg/ml). Detached, polymerized matrix (2.5 ml) in 35-mm dishes was allowed to contract for 6 days in DMEM, 10% FCS until fibroblasts had contracted the matrix to ≈1.5-cm diameter (31Dozynkiewicz M.A. Jamieson N.B.

Then 4 × 104 A431-WT and A431-A6 cells were plated on top of the matrix in complete medium and allowed to grow to confluence for 5 days. The matrix was then mounted on a metal grid and raised to the air/liquid interface, resulting in the matrix being fed from below with complete medium that was changed every 2 days. After 12 days, the cultures were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde and processed for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. The invasion index was calculated as the percentage of cells that invaded beyond ≈30 μm as a percentage of total cells in the assay. Cell invasion was analyzed using BD BioCoat Matrigel invasion chambers with 8-μm-pore size polyethylene terephthalate membrane inserts according to the manufacturer's protocol (BD Biosciences). Briefly, 6 × 104 cells per insert were seeded on the upper chamber in serum-free medium. The lower chamber contained DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS as chemoattractant. After 72 h at 37 °C, cells remaining in the upper chamber were removed. Cells that had invaded the lower chamber were fixed and stained with Diff-Quick stain (Lab Aids, Australia). As a control, migration on uncoated inserts was determined. Images were captured using a Nikon Eclipse TS100 microscope. Six-well plates were marked with horizontal lines at the base of the plate. 5 × 105 CHO-WT, CHO-A6, A431-WT, and A431-A6 cells were seeded in triplicate and grown until ∼70% confluence. A scratch, using the tip of a P10 pipette, was then made across the center of each well such that the scratch was perpendicular to the marked horizontal lines. Images were acquired immediately after scratching (t = 0) and postscratch at t = 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 48, and 60 h, respectively, until cells completely covered the scratched area. Cells were washed at each time point to remove possible cell debris and non-adherent cells. Scratches were studied at 10× magnification using a Nikon Eclipse TS100 inverted microscope, and images were collected with Leica Microsystems Digital Imaging. Image analysis was performed with ImageJ software. The area of the scratch was calculated for the various time points as percent reduction in area over time. Three independent experiments in triplicate per cell line were performed. Cells were harvested in PBS, 0.5 mm EDTA; resuspended in ice-cold PBS, 1% FCS (FACS buffer); and incubated in FACS buffer with anti-integrins (0.01 μg/ml α5 and β3; 0.02 μg/ml αV) for 1 h. Cells were washed, incubated with fluorescently tagged secondary antibody for 1 h, and then washed again. Cell surface fluorescence was measured using FACS-CantoII cytometer at 4 °C. Error bars depict standard deviation (S.D.). Statistical significance was determined with GraphPad Prism by unpaired Student's t test or analysis of variance test as indicated (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001).

https://openalex.org/W2259221054,"Introduction A significant number of healthcare workers have responded to aid in the relief and containment of the 2013 Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa. Healthcare workers are required to wear personal protective clothing (PPC) to impede the transmission of the virus; however, the impermeable design and the hot humid environment lead to risk of heat stress. Objective Provide healthcare workers quantitative modeling and analysis to aid in the prevention of heat stress while wearing PPC in West Africa. Methods A sweating thermal manikin was used to measure the thermal (Rct) and evaporative resistance (Ret) of the five currently used levels of PPC for healthcare workers in the West Africa EVD response. Mathematical methods of predicting the rise in core body temperature (Tc) in response to clothing, activity, and environment was used to simulate different responses to PPC levels, individual body sizes, and two hot humid conditions: morning/evening (air temperature: 25°C, relative humidity: 40%, mean radiant temperature: 35°C, wind velocity: 1 m/s) and mid-day (30°C, 60%, 70°C, 1 m/s). Results Nearly still air (0.4 m/s) measures of Rct ranged from 0.18 to 0.26 m2 K/W and Ret ranged from 25.53 to 340.26 m2 Pa/W. Conclusion Biophysical assessments and modeling in this study provide quantitative guidance for prevention of heat stress of healthcare workers wearing PPC responding to the EVD outbreak in West Africa."
https://openalex.org/W2252735389,"The charging infrastructure location problem is becoming more significant due to the extensive adoption of electric vehicles. Efficient charging station planning can solve deeply rooted problems, such as driving-range anxiety and the stagnation of new electric vehicle consumers. In the initial stage of introducing electric vehicles, the allocation of charging stations is difficult to determine due to the uncertainty of candidate sites and unidentified charging demands, which are determined by diverse variables. This paper introduces the Estimating the Required Density of EV Charging (ERDEC) stations model, which is an analytical approach to estimating the optimal density of charging stations for certain urban areas, which are subsequently aggregated to city level planning. The optimal charging station's density is derived to minimize the total cost. A numerical study is conducted to obtain the correlations among the various parameters in the proposed model, such as regional parameters, technological parameters and coefficient factors. To investigate the effect of technological advances, the corresponding changes in the optimal density and total cost are also examined by various combinations of technological parameters. Daejeon city in South Korea is selected for the case study to examine the applicability of the model to real-world problems. With real taxi trajectory data, the optimal density map of charging stations is generated. These results can provide the optimal number of chargers for driving without driving-range anxiety. In the initial planning phase of installing charging infrastructure, the proposed model can be applied to a relatively extensive area to encourage the usage of electric vehicles, especially areas that lack information, such as exact candidate sites for charging stations and other data related with electric vehicles. The methods and results of this paper can serve as a planning guideline to facilitate the extensive adoption of electric vehicles."
https://openalex.org/W2269469491,"We aimed to assess the relationship between dietary soyfood and isoflavone intake and colorectal cancer risk in a case-control study. A total of 901 colorectal cancer cases and 2669 controls were recruited at the National Cancer Center, Korea. A semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire was used to assess the usual dietary habits, and the isoflavone intake level was estimated from five soyfood items. A high intake of total soy products, legumes, and sprouts was associated with a reduced risk for colorectal cancer in men and women, although the middle quartiles of intake of total soy products were associated with an elevated risk. In contrast, a high intake of fermented soy paste was associated with an elevated risk for colorectal cancer in men. The groups with the highest intake quartiles of isoflavones showed a decreased risk for colorectal cancer compared to their counterparts with the lowest intake quartiles in men (odds ratio (OR): 0.67, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.51–0.89) and women (OR: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.43–0.99). The reduced risk for the highest intake groups persisted for distal colon cancer in men and rectal cancer in women. The association between soyfood intake and colorectal cancer risk was more prominent among post-menopausal women than pre-menopausal women. In conclusion, a high intake of total soy products or dietary isoflavones was associated with a reduced risk for overall colorectal cancer, and the association may be more relevant to distal colon or rectal cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2179718752,"Fat metabolism is a complicated process regulated by a series of factors. microRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of negative regulator of proteins and play crucial roles in many biological processes; including fat metabolism. Although there have been some researches indicating that miRNAs could influence the milk fat metabolism through targeting some factors, little is known about the effect of miRNAs on goat milk fat metabolism. Here we utilized an improved miRNA detection assay, S-Poly-(T), to profile the expression of miRNAs in the goat mammary gland in different periods, and found that miR-130b was abundantly and differentially expressed in goat mammary gland. Additionally, overexpressing miR-130b impaired adipogenesis while inhibiting miR-130b enhanced adipogenesis in goat mammary epithelial cells. Utilizing 3'-UTR assay and Western Blot analusis, the protein peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor coactivator-1α (PGC1α), a major regulator of fat metabolism, was demonstrated to be a potential target of miR-130b. Interestingly, miR-130b potently repressed PGC1α expression by targeting both the PGC1α mRNA coding and 3' untranslated regions. These findings have some insight of miR-130b in mediating adipocyte differentiation by repressing PGC1α expression and this contributes to further understanding about the functional significance of miRNAs in milk fat synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2174870550,"Background In sub-Saharan Africa many children live in extreme poverty and experience a burden of illness and disease that is disproportionately high. The emergence of HIV and AIDS has only exacerbated long-standing challenges to improving children’s health in the region, with recent cohorts experiencing pediatric AIDS and high levels of orphan status, situations which are monitored globally and receive much policy and research attention. Children’s health, however, can be affected also by living with HIV-infected adults, through associated exposure to infectious diseases and the diversion of household resources away from them. While long recognized, far less research has focused on characterizing this distinct and vulnerable population of HIV-affected children. Methods Using Demographic and Health Survey data from 23 countries collected between 2003 and 2011, we estimate the percentage of children living in a household with at least one HIV-infected adult. We assess overlaps with orphan status and investigate the relationship between children and the adults who are infected in their households. Results The population of children living in a household with at least one HIV-infected adult is substantial where HIV prevalence is high; in Southern Africa, the percentage exceeded 10% in all countries and reached as high as 36%. This population is largely distinct from the orphan population. Among children living in households with tested, HIV-infected adults, most live with parents, often mothers, who are infected; nonetheless, in most countries over 20% live in households with at least one infected adult who is not a parent. Conclusion Until new infections contract significantly, improvements in HIV/AIDS treatment suggest that the population of children living with HIV-infected adults will remain substantial. It is vital to on-going efforts to reduce childhood morbidity and mortality to consider whether current care and outreach sufficiently address the distinct vulnerabilities of these children."
https://openalex.org/W2203682056,"The hydrogen isotope (2H/1H) ratio of lipids from phytoplankton is a powerful new tool for reconstructing hydroclimate variations in the geologic past from marine and lacustrine sediments. Water 2H/1H changes are reflected in lipid 2H/1H changes with R2 > 0.99, and salinity variations have been shown to cause about a 1‰ change in lipid δ2H values per unit (ppt) change in salinity. Less understood are the effects of growth rate, nutrient limitation and light on 2H/1H fractionation in phytoplankton. Here we present the first published study of growth rate effects on 2H/1H fractionation in the lipids of coccolithophorids grown in continuous cultures. Emiliania huxleyi was cultivated in steady state at four growth rates and the δ2H value of individual alkenones (C37:2, C37:3, C38:2, C38:3), fatty acids (C14:0, C16:0, C18:0), and 24-methyl cholest-5,22-dien-3β-ol (brassicasterol) were measured. 2H/1H fractionation increased in all lipids as growth rate increased by 24‰ to 79‰ (div d-1)-1. We attribute this response to a proportional increase in the fraction of NADPH from Photosystem I (PS1) of photosynthesis relative to NADPH from the cytosolic oxidative pentose phosphate (OPP) pathway in the synthesis of lipids as growth rate increases. A 3-endmember model is presented in which lipid hydrogen comes from NADPH produced in PS1, NADPH produced by OPP, and intracellular water. With published values or best estimates of the fractionation factors for these sources (αPS1 = 0.4, αOPP = 0.75, and αH2O = 0) and half of the hydrogen in a lipid derived from water the model indicates αlipid = 0.79. This value is within the range measured for alkenones (αalkenone = 0.77 to 0.81) and fatty acids (αFA = 0.75 to 0.82) in the chemostat cultures, but is greater than the range for brassicasterol (αbrassicasterol = 0.68 to 0.72). The latter is attributed to a greater proportion of hydrogen from NADPH relative to water in isoprenoid lipids. The model successfully explains the increase in 2H/1H fractionation in the sterol 24-methyl-cholesta-5,24(28)-dien-3β-ol from marine centric diatom T. pseudonana chemostat cultures as growth rate increases. Insensitivity of αFA in those same cultures may be attributable to a larger fraction of hydrogen in fatty acids sourced from intracellular water at the expense of NADPH as growth rate increases. The high sensitivity of α to growth rate in E. huxleyi lipids and a T. pseudonana sterol implies that any change in growth rate larger than ~0.15 div d-1 can cause a change in δ2Hlipid that is larger than the analytical error of the measurement (~5‰), and needs to be considered when interpreting δ2Hlipid variations in sediments."
https://openalex.org/W2221283327,"The development of methods to monitor manufactured nanomaterials in the environment is one of the crucial areas for the assessment of their risk. More specifically, particle size analysis is a key element, because many properties of nanomaterial are size dependent. The sizing of nanomaterials in real environments is challenging due to their heterogeneity and reactivity with other environmental components. In this study, the fractionation and characterization of a mixture of polyvinylpyrrolidone-coated silver nanoparticles (PVP-AgNPs) of three different sizes were investigated using asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation (AF4) coupled with UV-Vis spectrophotometry. In particular, the effects of electrolyte composition and natural organic matter (NOM) on the particle size and stability were evaluated. The fractogram peaks (i.e., stability) of three different AgNPs decreased in the presence of both 10 mM NaCl and 10 mM CaCl2, while increased with increasing concentration of humic acid (HA). In addition, the hydrodynamic diameters of AgNPs in both electrolytes slightly increased with an increase of HA concentration, suggesting the adsorption (coating) of HA onto the particle surface. It is also interesting to note that an increase in the particle size depended on the types of electrolyte, which could be explained by the conformational characteristics of the adsorbed HA layers. Consistent these results, AgNPs suspended in lake water containing relatively high concentration of organic carbon (TOC) showed higher particle stability and larger particle size (i.e., by approximately 4 nm) than those in river water. In conclusion, the application of AF4 coupled with highly sensitive detectors could be a powerful method to characterize nanoparticles in natural waters."

Most of the metabolic studies underscore glomerular pathobiology, although the tubulo-interstitial compartment has been underemphasized. This study highlights mechanisms concerning the pathobiology of tubular injury in the context of myo-inositol oxygenase (Miox), a tubular enzyme. The kidneys of mice fed a high fat diet (HFD) had increased Miox expression and activity, and the latter was related to phosphorylation of serine/threonine residues. Also, expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein1 (Srebp1) and markers of cellular/nuclear damage was increased along with accentuated apoptosis and loss of tubular brush border. Similar results were observed in cells treated with palmitate/BSA. Multiple sterol-response elements and E-box motifs were found in the miox promoter, and its activity was modulated by palmitate/BSA. Electrophoretic mobility and ChIP assays confirmed binding of Srebp to consensus sequences of the miox promoter. Exposure of palmitate/BSA-treated cells to rapamycin normalized Miox expression and prevented Srebp1 nuclear translocation. In addition, rapamycin treatment reduced p53 expression and apoptosis. Like rapamycin, srebp siRNA reduced Miox expression. Increased expression of Miox was associated with the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in kidney tubules of mice fed an HFD and cell exposed to palmitate/BSA. Both miox and srebp1 siRNAs reduced generation of ROS. Collectively, these findings suggest that HFD or fatty acids modulate transcriptional, translational, and post-translational regulation of Miox expression/activity and underscore Miox being a novel target of the transcription factor Srebp1. Conceivably, activation of the mTORC1/Srebp1/Miox pathway leads to the generation of ROS culminating into tubulo-interstitial injury in states of obesity.

https://openalex.org/W2172799097,"Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-1 (IDO) is an immune regulatory enzyme expressed by most human tumors. IDO levels in tumor cells correlate with increased metastasis and poor patient outcome and IDO is linked to tumor cell resistance to immunotherapy, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. Knowledge of tumor cell-autonomous effects of IDO, independent of its well-known role in regulating and suppressing anti-tumor immune responses, is limited. Clonal populations of A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells stably transfected with anti-IDO shRNA or scrambled control shRNA were used to study IDO effects on drug sensitivity and resistance. IFNγ was used to induce IDO in those cells. We show, for the first time, that IDO mediates human tumor cell resistance to the candidate anticancer drugs FK866 (an NAD+ inhibitor), methoxyamine (MX, a base excision repair [BER] inhibitor) and approved anticancer drugs pemetrexed (a folate anti-metabolite) and gemcitabine (a nucleoside analogue), and combined treatment with pemetrexed and MX, in the absence of immune cells. Concurrent knockdown of IDO and thymidylate synthase (TS, a key rate-limiting enzyme in DNA synthesis and repair) sensitizes human lung cancer cells to pemetrexed and 5FUdR to a greater degree than knockdown of either target alone. We conclude that BER in IDO-expressing A549 cells plays a major role in mediating resistance to a range of approved and candidate anticancer drugs. IDO inhibitors are undergoing clinical trials primarily to improve antitumor immune responses. We show that targeting IDO alone or in combination with TS is a potentially valuable therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment, independent of immune activity and in combination with conventional chemotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2177409152,"Evidence of sex-specific foraging in monomorphic seabirds is increasing though the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. We investigate differential parental care as a mechanism for sex-specific foraging in monomorphic Common Murres (Uria aalge), where the male parent alone provisions the chick after colony departure. Using a combination of geolocation-immersion loggers and stable isotopes, we assess two hypotheses: the reproductive role specialization hypothesis and the energetic constraint hypothesis. We compare the foraging behavior of females (n = 15) and males (n = 9) during bi-parental at the colony, post-fledging male-only parental care and winter when parental care is absent. As predicted by the reproductive role specialization hypothesis, we found evidence of sex-specific foraging during post-fledging only, the stage with the greatest divergence in parental care roles. Single-parenting males spent almost twice as much time diving per day and foraged at lower quality prey patches relative to independent females. This implies a potential energetic constraint for males during the estimated 62.8 ± 8.9 days of offspring dependence at sea. Contrary to the predictions of the energetic constraint hypothesis, we found no evidence of sex-specific foraging during biparental care, suggesting that male parents did not forage for their own benefit before colony departure in anticipation of post-fledging energy constraints. We hypothesize that unpredictable prey conditions at Newfoundland colonies in recent years may limit male parental ability to allocate additional time and energy to self-feeding during biparental care, without compromising chick survival. Our findings support differential parental care as a mechanism for sex-specific foraging in monomorphic murres, and highlight the need to consider ecological context in the interpretation of sex-specific foraging behavior."

However, size estimation of MSM populations is still a significant public health challenge due to high cost, hard to reach and stigma associated with the population.We aimed to estimate the social network size (c value) in general population and the size of MSM population in Shanghai, China by using the net work scale-up method.A multistage random sampling was used to recruit participants aged from 18 to 60 years who had lived in Shanghai for at least 6 months. The ""known population method"" with adjustment of backward estimation and regression model was applied to estimate the c value. And the MSM population size was further estimated using an adjusted c value taking into account for the transmission effect through social respect level towards MSM.A total of 4017 participants were contacted for an interview, and 3907 participants met the inclusion criterion. The social network size (c value) of participants was 236 after adjustment. The estimated size of MSM was 36354 (95% CI: 28489-44219) for the male Shanghaies aged 18 to 60 years, and the proportion of MSM among the total male population aged 18 to 60 years in Shanghai was 0.28%.We employed the network scale-up method and used a wide range of data sources to estimate the size of MSM population in Shanghai, which is useful for HIV prevention and intervention among the target population."
https://openalex.org/W2173492094,"During mammalian oocyte growth, genomic DNA may accumulate DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) induced by factors such as reactive oxygen species. Recent evidence demonstrated that slight DSBs do not activate DNA damage checkpoint proteins in denuded oocytes. These oocytes, even with DNA DSBs, can resume meiosis and progress to metaphase of meiosis II. Meiotic resumption in oocytes is also controlled by the surrounding cumulus cells; accordingly, we analyzed whether cumulus-cell enclosed oocytes (CEOs) with DNA damage are able to resume meiosis. Compared with DNA-damaged denuded oocytes, we found that meiotic resumption rates of CEOs significantly decreased. To assess the mechanism by which cumulus cells block meiotic resumption in CEOs with DNA DSBs, we treated the cumulus oocyte complex with the gap junction inhibitor carbenoxolone and found that carbenoxolone can rescue the block in CEO meiosis induced by DNA DSBs. Since cumulus cell-synthesized cAMPs can pass through the gap junctions between oocyte and cumulus cell to block oocyte meiosis, we measured the expression levels of adenylate cyclase 1 (Adcy1) in cumulus cells, and G-protein coupled receptor 3 (Gpr3) and phosphodiesterase 3A (Pde3a) in oocytes, and found that the mRNA expression level of Adcy1 increased significantly in DNA-damaged cumulus cells. In conclusion, our results indicate that DNA DSBs promote cAMP synthesis in cumulus cells, and cumulus cAMPs can inhibit meiotic resumption of CEOs through gap junctions."
https://openalex.org/W2251562609,"The vital parameter data for 62 stocks, covering 38 species, collected from the literature, including parameters of age, growth, and reproduction, were log-transformed and analyzed using multivariate analyses.

Group (1) included species with slow growth rates (0.034 yr-1 < k < 0.103 yr-1) and extended longevity (26 yr < Tmax < 81 yr), e.g., shortfin mako Isurus oxyrinchus, dusky shark Carcharhinus obscurus, etc.; Group (2) included species with fast growth rates (0.103 yr-1 < k < 0.358 yr-1) and short longevity (9 yr < Tmax < 26 yr), e.g., starspotted smoothhound Mustelus manazo, gray smoothhound M. californicus, etc.; Group (3) included late maturing species (Lm/L∞ ≧ 0.75) with moderate longevity (Tmax < 29 yr), e.g., pelagic thresher Alopias pelagicus, sevengill shark Notorynchus cepedianus. The empirical equation for all data pooled was also developed. The λ’ values estimated by these empirical equations showed good agreement with those calculated using conventional demographic analysis. The predictability was further validated by an independent data set of three species. The empirical equations developed in this study not only reduce the uncertainties in estimation but also account for the difference in life history among groups. This method therefore provides an efficient and effective approach to the implementation of precautionary shark management measures."

We are aiming at determining the specific factors associated with in-hospital delay through a hospital based cohort. In-hospital delay was defined as door-to-needle time (DTN) ≥60 min (standard delay criteria) or ≥75% percentile of all DTNs (severe delay criteria). Demographic data, time intervals [onset-to-door time (OTD), DTN, door-to-examination time (DTE), door-to-imaging time (DTI), door-to-laboratory time (DTL) and final-test-to-needle time (FTN, the time interval between the time obtaining the result of the last screening test and the needle time)], medical history and additional variables were calculated using Mann-Whitney U or Pearson Chi-Square tests for group comparison, and multivariate linear regression analysis was performed to identify independent variables of in-hospital delay. A total of 202 IVT cases were enrolled. The median age was 61 years and 25.2% were female. The cutoff points for the upper quartile of DTN (severe delay criteria) was 135 min.When compared with the reference group without in-hospital delay, older age, shorter OTD and less referral were found in the standard delay group and male sex, presence with transient ischemic attacks or rapidly improving symptom, and with multi-model CT imaging were more frequent in the severe delay group. In the multivariate linear regression analysis, FTN (P<0.001) and DTL (P = 0.002) were significantly associated with standard delay; while DTE (P = 0.005), DTI (P = 0.033), DTL (P<0.001), and FTN (P<0.001) were positively associated with severe delay. There was not a significant change in the trend of DTNs during the study period (P = 0.054). In-hospital delay was due to multifactors in China, in which time delays of decision-making process and laboratory tests contributed the most. Efforts aiming at reducing the delay should be focused on the optimization for the items of screening tests and improvement of the pathway organization."

https://openalex.org/W2229939127,"Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is a highly conserved pathway that removes helix-distorting DNA lesions induced by a plethora of mutagens, including UV light. Our laboratory previously demonstrated that human cells deficient in either ATM and Rad3-related (ATR) kinase or translesion DNA polymerase η (i.e. key proteins that promote the completion of DNA replication in response to UV-induced replicative stress) are characterized by profound inhibition of NER exclusively during S phase. Toward elucidating the mechanistic basis of this phenomenon, we developed a novel assay to quantify NER kinetics as a function of cell cycle in the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using this assay, we demonstrate that in yeast, deficiency of the ATR homologue Mec1 or of any among several other proteins involved in the cellular response to replicative stress significantly abrogates NER uniquely during S phase. Moreover, initiation of DNA replication is required for manifestation of this defect, and S phase NER proficiency is correlated with the capacity of individual mutants to respond to replicative stress. Importantly, we demonstrate that partial depletion of Rfa1 recapitulates defective S phase-specific NER in wild type yeast; moreover, ectopic RPA1–3 overexpression rescues such deficiency in either ATR- or polymerase η-deficient human cells.

NER is evolutionarily conserved, and studies using both yeast and human models have been instrumental in elucidating its molecular underpinnings. (For excellent reviews of the human and yeast NER pathways, see Refs. 5Marteijn J.A. Lans H. Vermeulen W. Hoeijmakers J.H.J.

DNA repair mechanisms and the bypass of DNA damage in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Genetics. 2013; 193: 1025-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar.) Two distinct NER subpathways have been identified: global genomic NER (GG-NER) and transcription-coupled NER (TC-NER), which excise UV DNA photoproducts throughout the entire genome and exclusively from the transcribed strands of active genes, respectively. GG-NER is triggered when DDB1-DDB2 (Rad7-Rad16) (yeast homologs in parentheses) and the heterotrimeric XPC-HR23B-CEN2 complex (Rad4-Rad23-Rad33) recognize helical distortions created by UV photoproducts. In contrast, TC-NER is initiated by blockage of elongating RNA polymerase II at photoadducted sites, followed by recruitment of the CSB (Rad26) and CSA (Rad28) proteins. After these initial events, for either GG-NER or TC-NER, the “core NER machinery” is recruited and accomplishes error-free restoration of DNA integrity through (i) strand denaturation surrounding the lesion, mediated by the helicase and ATPase activities of XPD (Rad3) and XPB (Rad25), respectively; (ii) stabilization of the melted structure and lesion verification by heterotrimeric RPA1–3 (RFA1–3) in conjunction with XPA (Rad14); (iii) incision of the DNA backbone 10–15 bp on either side of the damage, catalyzed by the XPF-ERCC1 (Rad1-Rad10) and XPG (Rad2) endonucleases; (iv) excision of the resultant 25–30-bp single-stranded DNA segment encompassing the lesion, creating a short gap that is resynthesized using normal DNA replication factors and the opposite undamaged strand as template; and finally (v) sealing of the remaining nick by DNA ligase (Cdc9). It is noteworthy that several essential NER factors (e.g. RPA1–3, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and DNA ligase) also play independent roles in other critical cellular processes, such as DNA replication and homologous recombination. Helix-distorting CPDs and 6-4PPs strongly block the progression of DNA polymerases, which causes persistent replication fork stalling and formation of DNA strand breaks, eventually leading to cell death (7Budzowska M. Kanaar R. Mechanisms of dealing with DNA damage-induced replication problems.Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2009; 53: 17-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Eukaryotic cells have thus evolved the highly conserved DNA damage response (DDR), a major branch of which (i.e. the S phase checkpoint) acts to slow down DNA synthesis, thereby providing more opportunity to mitigate the genotoxic consequences of replicative stress. Current models propose that blockage of fork progression by DNA adducts uncouples the activity of replicative helicase complexes from that of DNA polymerases, which generates regions of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) (8Byun T.S. Pacek M. Yee M.C. Walter J.C. Cimprich K.A.

Sensing DNA damage through ATRIP recognition of RPA-ssDNA complexes.Science. 2003; 300: 1542-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (2044) Google Scholar). ATR/Mec1 then phosphorylates a multitude of protein substrates, many of which promote DNA replication completion and hence cell survival (11Branzei D. Foiani M.

Interestingly, consistent with our results in polη-deficient human cells, murine embryonic fibroblasts knocked out for translesion DNA polymerase ζ (which is essential for efficient replicative bypass of 6-4PPs) were recently shown to also exhibit defective NER uniquely during S phase (17Tsaalbi-Shtylik A. Moser J. Mullenders L.H.F. Jansen J.G. de Wind N. Persistently stalled replication forks inhibit nucleotide excision repair in trans by sequestering replication protein A.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: 4406-4413Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) (see “Discussion”). It remains unclear whether the requirement for robust ATR and translesion DNA polymerase activities in S phase-specific NER reflects a common underlying mechanism. However, one potential connection relates to the fact that cells derived from polη-deficient skin cancer-prone xeroderma pigmentosum variant (XPV) patients or from ATR-deficient Seckel syndrome patients each exhibit increased replication fork stalling in response to UV (18Despras E. Daboussi F. Hyrien O. Marheineke K. Kannouche P.L. ATR/Chk1 pathway is essential for resumption of DNA synthesis and cell survival in UV-irradiated XP variant cells.Hum. Mol.

Cell Biol. 2014; 16: 2-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar). Based on this, we (15Auclair Y. Rouget R. Belisle J.M. Costantino S. Drobetsky E.A. Requirement for functional DNA polymerase η in genome-wide repair of UV-induced DNA damage during S phase.DNA Repair. 2010; 9: 754-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and others (17Tsaalbi-Shtylik A. Moser J. Mullenders L.H.F. Jansen J.G. de Wind N. Persistently stalled replication forks inhibit nucleotide excision repair in trans by sequestering replication protein A.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: 4406-4413Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) have postulated a functional link between levels of replicative stress and NER efficiency. To further investigate this possibility, we exploited a genetically tractable model organism, the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Specifically, a novel flow cytometry-based assay was developed to quantify NER kinetics as a function of cell cycle in yeast. We demonstrate that deletion of the yeast ATR homolog MEC1 or of any among several other DDR genes involved in the cellular response to replicative stress cripples NER uniquely in S phase. Furthermore, direct evidence is provided that this cell cycle-specific repair defect is triggered by sequestration of RPA1–3 to regions of ssDNA during periods of enhanced replicative stress, ostensibly causing reduced availability of this complex to perform its essential function in NER. Unless stated otherwise, deletion mutants were obtained from the BY4741 haploid MATa Yeast Knock-out Collection (Thermo Scientific, YSC1053). Other strains used in this study are described in Table 1. Yeast strains were generated and propagated using standard yeast genetics methods.

VE-821 was purchased from Cedarlane. A monochromatic 254-nm G25T8 germicidal lamp (Philips) was used at a fluence of 1 J/m2/s measured using a Spectroline DRC ×100 digital radiometer equipped with a DIX-254 sensor. Yeast cells were washed with water and irradiated in a thin layer of water at a cell density of 0.5 OD. For yeast grown on agar plates, cells were irradiated immediately after plating. UV irradiation and post-UV incubations were carried out in the dark to prevent CPD reversal by yeast photolyase activity. For mammalian cell lines, monolayers were washed with PBS and irradiated through a thin layer of PBS. Whole-cell lysates of S. cerevisiae were prepared for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis by alkaline lysis (22Kushnirov V.V. Rapid and reliable protein extraction from yeast.Yeast. 2000; 16: 857-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar) or standard glass bead/trichloroacetic acid precipitation. Whole-cell lysates of mammalian cells were prepared as described (23Loignon M. Drobetsky E.A. The initiation of UV-induced G1 arrest in human cells is independent of the p53/p21/pRb pathway but can be attenuated through expression of the HPV E7 oncoprotein.Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 35-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE and protein transfers were performed using standard molecular biology protocols. Antibodies used were as follows: mouse monoclonal 12CA5 anti-HA and anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma-Aldrich), rabbit anti-polη (sc-5592, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), mouse anti-RPA2 (NA18, Calbiochem), mouse anti-γH2AX (JBW301, Millipore), rat anti-tubulin (ab6161, Abcam), rabbit anti-RPA1 (ab79398, Abcam), and mouse anti-RPA3 (ab6432, Abcam). Detection was performed using a LAS-3000 imaging system (Fuji). Immunoblot signals were quantified with ImageQuant version 5.2 software (GE Healthcare). DNA was stained using SYTOX Green (Invitrogen), as described previously (24Haase S.B. Reed S.I. Improved flow cytometric analysis of the budding yeast cell cycle.Cell Cycle. 2002; 1: 132-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Flow cytometry was performed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Results were analyzed with FlowJo version 7.6.5 software (FlowJo, LLC). For S. cerevisiae, 1 ml (0.5 OD) of cells were fixed overnight with 2.5 ml of 95% ethanol at 4 °C. Cells were washed with 2 ml of PBS, and incubated with 20 μg/ml Zymolyase T20 (BioShop Canada) in PBS at 30 °C for 40 min. This was followed by incubation in 1 ml of 2 n HCl at room temperature for 15 min, followed by neutralization in 3 ml of 0.1 m borax, pH 9. Cells were then washed in PBS and incubated in 1 ml of PBS plus 0.5 mg/ml RNase A (BioShop Canada) for 1 h at 37 °C. Samples were washed with 3 ml of PBS-TB (PBS, 1% BSA, 0.25% Tween 20), followed by incubation in 0.35 ml of PBS-TB + mouse anti-CPD antibody (Kamiya Biomedical, MC-062) at a 1:1000 dilution for 90 min at room temperature. After a wash with PBS-TB, samples were incubated in 0.35 ml of Alexa647-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (A21235, Invitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. Samples were washed with PBS-TB, resuspended in 1 ml of PBS plus 1 μg/ml SYTOX Green (Invitrogen), and analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Data were analyzed using FlowJo version 7.6.5 software (FlowJo). For mammalian cells, the excision of 6-4PPs was quantified in G0/G1, S, and G2/M phase as described in detail previously (13Auclair Y. Rouget R. Affar El B. Drobetsky E.A. ATR kinase is required for global genomic nucleotide excision repair exclusively during S phase in human cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 17896-17901Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). HeLa cells transfected with vector expressing either RPA or GFP were seeded in 6-cm dishes (106 cells/dish). Cultures were treated for the indicated time with 30 μm BrdU, trypsinized, fixed in ethanol, labeled with an Alexa647-coupled mouse anti-BrdU-antibody (B35133, Thermo Scientific), and analyzed by flow cytometry as described previously (14Bélanger F. Rajotte V. Drobetsky E.A. A majority of human melanoma cell lines exhibits an S phase-specific defect in excision of UV-induced DNA photoproducts.PLoS One. 2014; 9: e85294Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). After UV irradiation, genomic DNA was extracted from yeast using a standard glass bead/phenol/chloroform procedure. DNA concentration was measured with PicoGreen (Invitrogen) using aTBS-380 fluorimeter (Turner Biosystems). 100 ng of DNA samples were bound to Zeta-probe membranes (Bio-Rad) using a Bio-Dot SF slot blotting apparatus (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Membranes were probed with anti-CPD primary antibodies (MC-062, Kamiya Biomedical). Detection was performed using a LAS-3000 imaging system (Fuji). Signals were quantified using ImageQuant version 5.2 software (GE Healthcare). Cells were fixed using formaldehyde as described (25Wurtele H. Kaiser G.S. Bacal J. St-Hilaire E. Lee E.-H. Tsao S. Dorn J. Maddox P. Lisby M. Pasero P. Verreault A. Histone h3 lysine 56 acetylation and the response to DNA replication fork damage.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2012; 32: 154-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Images were acquired at room temperature using a DeltaVision Elite system (GE Healthcare) equipped with a UIS2 ×60/1.42 numerical aperture, plan apo objective (Olympus); a 15-bit EDGE/sCMOS camera (PCO); and SoftWoRx version 6.2.0 software. Images were analyzed using ImageJ version 1.46E (National Institutes of Health). At least 200 cells were evaluated for each sample. Cells were seeded in 6-well plates on a microscope glass slide and irradiated or mock-irradiated as described above. Post-UV incubations were carried out in medium containing 30 μm BrdU (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and incubated for 3 min on ice with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS. Samples were washed with cold PBS and fixed for 15 min on ice with 3% methanol-free paraformaldehyde (Thermo Scientific) in cold PBS. Cells were washed with cold PBS and further incubated with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min on ice. Samples were denatured with 2 n HCl at room temperature for 10 min and neutralized with 0.1 m borax, pH 9. After washing with PBS-TB, samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 3% BSA in PBST (PBS, 0.05% Tween 20). Labeling was performed with mouse anti-RPA32 (NA18, Calbiochem) and rat anti-BrdU (ab6326, Abcam) at a 1:500 dilution in PBS-TB. Secondary antibodies were goat anti-mouse-Alexa488 (A10667, Invitrogen) and chicken anti-rat Alexa594 (A21471, Invitrogen), used at 1:500 dilution in the presence of 20 μg/ml DAPI (Invitrogen). Images were acquired at room temperature using a DeltaVision Elite system (GE Healthcare) equipped with a UIS2 ×60/1.42 numerical aperture, plan apo objective (Olympus); a 15-bit EDGE/sCMOS camera (PCO); and SoftWoRx version 6.2.0 software. Images were analyzed using ImageJ 1.46E (National Institutes of Health) and custom software to evaluate the intensity of RPA2 signals (see below). An algorithm was created using MATLAB (Mathworks, MA) to process three-channel images based on nuclear segmentation. DAPI channel images (435 nm) were automatically thresholded using the Otsu algorithm to obtain a binary mask, objects smaller than 5 pixels were removed, and holes were filled. A watershed algorithm was applied to the mask in order to separate adjacent nuclei. The average intensity and S.D. of both the 523-nm (RPA2) and 632-nm (BrdU) fluorescence channels were calculated for every nucleus detected in the field. For statistical analysis, at least 400 cells from two independent experiments were used for every condition. We developed a novel flow cytometry-based method to quantify NER kinetics as a function of cell cycle in yeast. Toward validating this assay, we initially compared CPD removal in wild type (WT) versus rad4Δ strains synchronized in G2/M using nocodazole. rad4Δ cells are completely defective in NER-mediated CPD removal and exquisitely sensitive to UV irradiation (26Reynolds R.J. Friedberg E.C. Molecular mechanisms of pyrimidine dimer excision in Saccharomyces cerevisiae: incision of ultraviolet-irradiated deoxyribonucleic acid in vivo.J. Bacteriol. 1981; 146: 692-704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Synchronized populations were irradiated with 100 J/m2 of 254-nm UV (hereafter referred to as UV) and incubated in the dark to prevent CPD reversal by DNA photolyase activity. Cells harvested at regular intervals were treated with Alexa647-conjugated anti-CPD antibody and SYTOX Green, followed by flow cytometry analysis. SYTOX Green was used to label double-stranded DNA in order to analyze Alexa647 signal intensity specifically in G2/M cells using a software gate (Fig. 1A). As expected, initial CPD induction by UV (t = 0 min) increased the Alexa647 signal to an equal extent (∼5-fold over background) in both WT and rad4Δ cells (Fig. 1B). During post-UV incubation, the signal decreased gradually for WT cells, reflecting progressive NER-mediated CPD removal (∼90% repair by t = 90 min) but remained essentially unchanged in the NER-deficient rad4Δ strain. We next compared CPD removal in WT, rad4Δ, rad26Δ, and mec1Δ sml1Δ strains synchronized in S phase. Deletion of SML1, encoding an inhibitor of the ribonucleotide"
https://openalex.org/W2267839406,"We aimed to determine how linear growth and fat and lean tissue gain during discrete age periods from birth to adolescence are related to adolescent cardiometabolic risk factors and cognitive ability.Adolescents born to mothers with normal glucose tolerance during pregnancy from an Indian birth cohort (N = 486, age 13.5 years) had detailed anthropometry and measurements of body fat (fat%), fasting plasma glucose, insulin and lipid concentrations, blood pressure and cognitive function. Insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was calculated. These outcomes were examined in relation to birth measurements and statistically independent measures (conditional SD scores) representing linear growth, and fat and lean tissue gain during birth-1, 1-2, 2-5, 5-9.5 and 9.5-13.5 years in 414 of the children with measurements at all these ages.Birth length and linear growth at all ages were positively associated with current height. Fat gain, particularly during 5-9.5 years was positively associated with fat% at 13.5 years (0.44 SD per SD [99.9% confidence interval: 0.29,0.58]). Greater fat gain during mid-late childhood was associated with higher systolic blood pressure (5-9.5 years: 0.23 SD per SD [0.07,0.40]) and HOMA-IR (5-9.5 years: 0.24 [0.08,0.40], 9.5-13.5 years: 0.22 [0.06,0.38]). Greater infant growth (up to age 2 years) in linear, fat or lean components was unrelated to cardiometabolic risk factors or cognitive function.This study suggests that factors that increase linear, fat and lean growth in infancy have no adverse cardiometabolic effects in this population. Factors that increase fat gain in mid-late childhood may increase cardiometabolic risk, without any benefit to cognitive abilities."
https://openalex.org/W2214255198,"Patients of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) frequently have lower bone mineral density and higher rate of hip fracture. Tg2576, a well characterized AD animal model that ubiquitously express Swedish mutant amyloid precursor protein (APPswe), displays not only AD-relevant neuropathology, but also age-dependent bone deficits. However, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. As APP is implicated as a regulator of iron export, and the metal chelation is considered as a potential therapeutic strategy for AD, we examined iron chelation’s effect on the osteoporotic deficit in Tg2576 mice. Remarkably, in vivo treatment with iron chelator, clinoquinol (CQ), increased both trabecular and cortical bone-mass, selectively in Tg2576, but not wild type (WT) mice. Further in vitro studies showed that low concentrations of CQ as well as deferoxamine (DFO), another iron chelator, selectively inhibited osteoclast (OC) differentiation, without an obvious effect on osteoblast (OB) differentiation. Intriguingly, both CQ and DFO’s inhibitory effect on OC was more potent in bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) from Tg2576 mice than that of wild type controls. The reduction of intracellular iron levels in BMMs by CQ was also more dramatic in APPswe-expressing BMMs. Taken together, these results demonstrate a potent inhibition on OC formation and activation in APPswe-expressing BMMs by iron chelation, and reveal a potential therapeutic value of CQ in treating AD-associated osteoporotic deficits."
https://openalex.org/W2224801742,"Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) affects > 500 million people worldwide, and is linked to impaired cognitive development and function in children. Helicobacter pylori, a class 1 carcinogen, infects about half of the world’s population, thus creating a high likelihood of overlapping risk. This study determined the effect of H. pylori infection on iron homeostasis in INS-GAS mice. Two replicates of INS-GAS/FVB male mice (n = 9-12/group) were dosed with H. pylori (Hp) strain SS1 or sham dosed at 6–9 weeks of age, and were necropsied at 27–29 weeks of age. Hematologic and serum iron parameters were evaluated, as was gene expression in gastric and brain tissues. Serum ferritin was lower in Hp SS1-infected mice than uninfected mice (p < 0.0001). Infected mice had a lower red blood cell count (p<0.0001), hematocrit (p < 0.001), and hemoglobin concentration (p <0.0001) than uninfected mice. Relative expression of gastric hepcidin antimicrobial peptide (Hamp) was downregulated in mice infected with Hp SS1 compared to sham-dosed controls (p<0.001). Expression of bone morphogenic protein 4 (Bmp4), a growth factor upstream of hepcidin, was downregulated in gastric tissue of Hp SS1-infected mice (p<0.001). Hp SS1-infected mice had downregulated brain expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (Th) (p = 0.02). Expression of iron-responsive genes involved in myelination (myelin basic protein (Mbp) and proteolipid protein 2 (Plp2)) was downregulated in infected mice (p = 0.001 and p = 0.02). Expression of synaptic plasticity markers (brain derived neurotrophic factor 3 (Bdnf3), Psd95 (a membrane associated guanylate kinase), and insulin-like growth factor 1 (Igf1)) was also downregulated in Hp SS1-infected mice (p = 0.09, p = 0.04, p = 0.02 respectively). Infection of male INS-GAS mice with Hp SS1, without concurrent dietary iron deficiency, depleted serum ferritin, deregulated gastric and hepatic expression of iron regulatory genes, and altered iron-dependent neural processes. The use of Hp SS1-infected INS-GAS mice will be an appropriate animal model for further study of the effects of concurrent H. pylori infection and anemia on iron homeostasis and adult iron-dependent brain gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2175472834,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis latent infection is maintained for years with no clinical symptoms and no adverse effects for the host. The mechanism through which dormant M. tuberculosis resuscitates and enters the cell cycle leading to tuberculosis is attracting much interest. The RPF family of proteins has been found to be responsible for bacteria resuscitation and normal proliferation. This family of proteins in M. tuberculosis is composed by five homologues (named RpfA-E) and understanding their conformational, structural and functional peculiarities is crucial to the design of therapeutic strategies.Therefore, we report the structural and dynamics characterization of the catalytic domain of RpfC from M. tubercolosis by combining Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Circular Dichroism and Molecular Dynamics data. We also show how the formation of a disulfide bridge, highly conserved among the homologues, is likely to modulate the shape of the RpfC hydrophobic catalytic cleft. This might result in a protein function regulation via a ""conformational editing"" through a disulfide bond formation."
https://openalex.org/W2228047847,"Drosophila melanogaster sarcomere length short (SALS) is a recently identified Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein homology 2 (WH2) domain protein involved in skeletal muscle thin filament regulation. SALS was shown to be important for the establishment of the proper length and organization of sarcomeric actin filaments. Here, we present the first detailed characterization of the biochemical activities of the tandem WH2 domains of SALS (SALS-WH2). Our results revealed that SALS-WH2 binds both monomeric and filamentous actin and shifts the monomer-filament equilibrium toward the monomeric actin. In addition, SALS-WH2 can bind to but fails to depolymerize phalloidin- or jasplakinolide-bound actin filaments. These interactions endow SALS-WH2 with the following two major activities in the regulation of actin dynamics: SALS-WH2 sequesters actin monomers into non-polymerizable complexes and enhances actin filament disassembly by severing, which is modulated by tropomyosin. We also show that profilin does not influence the activities of the WH2 domains of SALS in actin dynamics. In conclusion, the tandem WH2 domains of SALS are multifunctional regulators of actin dynamics. Our findings suggest that the activities of the WH2 domains do not reconstitute the presumed biological function of the full-length protein. Consequently, the interactions of the WH2 domains of SALS with actin must be tuned in the cellular context by other modules of the protein and/or sarcomeric components for its proper functioning.

These interactions endow SALS-WH2 with the following two major activities in the regulation of actin dynamics: SALS-WH2 sequesters actin monomers into non-polymerizable complexes and enhances actin filament disassembly by severing, which is modulated by tropomyosin. We also show that profilin does not influence the activities of the WH2 domains of SALS in actin dynamics. In conclusion, the tandem WH2 domains of SALS are multifunctional regulators of actin dynamics. Our findings suggest that the activities of the WH2 domains do not reconstitute the presumed biological function of the full-length protein. Consequently, the interactions of the WH2 domains of SALS with actin must be tuned in the cellular context by other modules of the protein and/or sarcomeric components for its proper functioning. The basic myofibrillar contractile units, sarcomeres, orchestrate the function of striated muscle. Essential components of the sarcomeric protein networks are the thin filaments composed of actin and regulatory proteins. During sarcomerogenesis, the assembly of actin monomers into filaments and the organization of these filaments into higher order complexes result in the formation of thin filaments. Filament barbed ends, anchored to the Z disk by α-actinin, are capped by CapZ, whereas tropomodulin (Tmod) 2The abbreviations used are: Tmod, tropomodulin; WH2, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein homology 2; Lmod, leiomodin, SALS, sarcomere length short; IAEDANS, 1,5-IAEDANS, 5-((((2-iodoacetyl)amino)ethyl)amino)naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid; Alexa488NHS, Alexa Fluor 488 carboxylic acid succinimidyl ester; TIRFM, total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy; WIP, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein-interacting protein. caps pointed ends. Therefore, sarcomeric thin filaments with well defined length are arranged in an extremely regular manner. The structural features of sarcomeric actin filaments are well resolved; however, the mechanisms governing the assembly and proper organization of actin filaments are not completely understood. The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein homology 2 (WH2) domains are found in increasing numbers of proteins that regulate the actin cytoskeleton during morphogenetic and motile processes (1Renault L.

The central element of the domain is an LKK(T/V) consensus motif (Fig. 1A). This motif is flanked by an N-terminal amphipathic α-helix followed by an FXXXK linker and a C-terminal region with variable length and composition. WH2 can occur as a single module or as tandem regions within the actin-associated proteins. Interesting features of the WH2 domains are their multifunctional character originating from subtle structural differences in their complexes with actin. The single WH2 domain of thymosin β4 sequesters actin monomers into a non-polymerizable complex, whereas the ones from Ciboulot, Actobindin, or Cordon Bleu have profilin-like function by directing monomer assembly to the filament barbed end (8Hertzog M. van Heijenoort C.

The presence of tandem WH2 domains can lead to a further level of functional complexity by integrating multiple activities in actin dynamics into a single protein. In vitro, tandem WH2 domains, such as found in Spire, Cordon Bleu, N-WASP, and the Vibrio cholerae/parahemeolyticus VopL/F proteins, possess monomer sequestration activity, which can be converted into nucleation and filament depolymerization-promoting functions by other modules surrounding the WH2 domains (10Husson C.

Recently, members of the WH2 domain protein family emerged as important regulators of muscle actin structures as well. In skeletal muscles two WH2 domain proteins have been implicated in the regulation of assembly and organization of sarcomeric actin filaments as follows: the vertebrate specific leiomodin (Lmod) and the Drosophila melanogaster Sarcomere Length Short (SALS) proteins (18Bai J.

Lmod1 is selectively expressed in smooth muscles, whereas Lmod2 and Lmod3 are present typically in heart and skeletal muscle, respectively. Each Lmod has a single WH2 domain; however, they contain additional actin-binding regions, as well as Tmod-binding domains. Both Lmod2 and Lmod3 were shown to play an important role in the organization of sarcomeric actin filaments (19Yuen M. Sandaradura S.A. Dowling J.J. Kostyukova A.S. Moroz N. Quinlan K.G.

Leiomodin 3 and tropomodulin 4 have overlapping functions during skeletal myofibrillogenesis.J. Cell Sci. 2015; 128: 239-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). SALS exists in two isoforms; the long 935-amino acid isoform (lSALS) is expressed specifically in muscle, and the short one (sSALS) can be found in non-muscle tissues (18Bai J. Hartwig J.H. Perrimon N. SALS, a WH2-domain-containing protein, promotes sarcomeric actin filament elongation from pointed ends during Drosophila muscle growth.Dev. Cell. 2007; 13: 828-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). lSALS possesses two tandem WH2 domains and an upstream proline-rich region (Fig. 1B), and the sSALS covers the C-terminal half of the long isoform containing only a single WH2 domain and lacking the proline-rich element. The investigation of the biological activities of the full-length lSALS isoform revealed that it has important roles in the establishment of the proper length and organization of sarcomeric thin filaments. It was proposed that SALS promotes actin filament elongation at the pointed ends by antagonizing the pointed end capping Tmod (18Bai J. Hartwig J.H. Perrimon N. SALS, a WH2-domain-containing protein, promotes sarcomeric actin filament elongation from pointed ends during Drosophila muscle growth.Dev. Cell. 2007; 13: 828-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, the activities of the WH2 domains of SALS were not analyzed in detail. In this work, our aim was to better understand how the WH2 domains of SALS contribute to the biological function of the full-length protein. We produced recombinant SALS constructs containing the isolated WH2 domains and analyzed their interactions with actin monomers and filaments by using a combination of protein biochemical, fluorescence spectroscopy, and microscopy approaches. We found that the isolated WH2 domains of SALS possess sequestration and depolymerizing activities. These functions support the accumulation of monomeric actin in vitro, which does not reconstitute the in vivo activity of the full-length protein. Based on these findings, we propose that regions of SALS other than the WH2 domains and/or other sarcomeric proteins (such as tropomyosin) must play essential roles in adjusting and adapting the activity of SALS for its proper biological function. These observations emphasize the role of other modules in tuning the activities of WH2 domains, which is a currently exciting issue to investigate in WH2 domain research. cDNAs of D. melanogaster SALS encoding the WH2 domains (SALS-WH2, 379–531 amino acids) and the proline-rich region upstream to the WH2 domains (SALS-Pro-WH2, 345–531 amino acids) (Fig. 1B) were cloned into pGEX-2T vector using SmaI site. SALS-WH2 and SALS-Pro-WH2 were expressed as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS strain (Novagen). Transformed bacteria were grown at 37 °C in Luria Broth (Lennox) EZMixTM powder microbial growth medium (Sigma). Protein expression was induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside at A600 = 0.5. After overnight expression at 20 °C, the bacterial extracts were collected by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C) and stored at −80 °C until use. For protein purification, the bacterial pellet was lysed by sonication in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.15 mm PMSF, 1 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mg/ml DNase, 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme, 400 mm NaCl, and Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Sigma, P8465, components: 23 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, 100 mm EDTA, 2 mm bestatin, 0.3 mm pepstatin A, and 0.3 mm E-64). The cell lysate was ultracentrifuged (Sorvall, T1250 rotor, 100,000 × g, 1 h, 4 °C). The supernatant was incubated with GSH resin (Amersham Biosciences) in batch overnight at 4 °C and washed with PBS and SALS buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1% sucrose). The proteins were cleaved with thrombin overnight at 4 °C and eluted by SALS buffer. Thrombin was separated by benzamidine-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (GE Healthcare). The proteins were concentrated (Amicon Ultra 5-kDa cutoff, Sigma) and clarified by ultracentrifugation (Beckman tabletop ultracentrifuge, MLA80 rotor, 300,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C). SALS constructs were flash-frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −80 °C until use. Control experiments showed that a freeze/thaw cycle does not affect the functionality of the constructs (data not shown). Typically, a 5–6-g bacterial pellet yielded 1–1.2 mg/ml protein. The protein concentrations were measured spectrophotometrically using the extinction coefficient of ϵ280 nm = 7115 m−1 cm−1 at 280 nm and molecular masses of 17,116 and 21,051 Da for SALS-WH2 and SALS-Pro-WH2, respectively, derived from the amino acid sequence (ExPASy ProtParam tool). The same concentration was obtained from measuring the mass of the lyophilized proteins. In contrast, bicinchoninic acid assay (QuantiProTM BCA assay kit, Sigma) gave underestimated values of concentrations due to the acidic nature of the constructs (22Olson B.J. Markwell J. Assays for determination of protein concentration.Curr. Protoc. Protein Sci. 2001; 2007 (Chapter 3, Unit 3.4)Google Scholar). Actin was purified from rabbit skeletal muscle according to standard procedures (23Spudich J.A. Watt S. The regulation of rabbit skeletal muscle contraction. I.

Human gelsolin (gelsolin), mouse profilin 1 (profilin), and rabbit skeletal muscle tropomyosin were purified as described previously and stored at −80 °C until used (24Nag S. Ma Q. Wang H.

Alexa488NHS-labeled actin was analyzed by mass spectrometry. The binding site of the probe was found to be the Lys328 residue of actin. Profilin was labeled by Alexa Fluor® C5 568 maleimide (Alexa568C, Invitrogen) as follows. 10-Fold molar excess of dye was added to the protein solution in DTT-free buffer, and the sample was incubated overnight at 4 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 10 mm DTT. The unbound dye was removed by a PD-10 column (GE Healthcare). The protein concentration was determined by correcting for the absorption of the dye at 280 nm. Samples at each concentration were prepared individually for experiments. All measurements were performed at 20 °C. The sum of the volume of the proteins and the volume of their storing buffer were constant in the samples and represented 50% of the total volume of the sample. The concentrations given in the text are final concentrations, unless stated otherwise. The measurements were performed using Mg2+-ATP-actin. The actin monomer bound calcium was replaced with magnesium by adding 200 μm EGTA and 50 μm MgCl2 and incubating the samples for 5–10 min at room temperature. Actin-polymerizing conditions were 1 mm MgCl2 and 50 mm KCl. The data presented were derived from at least two independent experiments. The fluorescence emission and the steady-state anisotropy (anisotropy) of IAEDANS or Alexa488NHS-labeled G-actin was measured to study the interaction of SALS constructs with monomeric actin. First, IAEDANS- or Alexa488NHS-Mg2+-G-actin (1 μm or 20 μm) was incubated with latrunculin A (4 or 20 μm, respectively) for 30 min to avoid polymerization. Then SALS-WH2 or SALS-Pro-WH2 at different concentrations was added, and the samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C. The measurements were performed using a Horiba Jobin Yvon spectrofluorometer (IAEDANS-G-actin, λex = 350 nm and λem = 460 nm; Alexa488NHS-G-actin, λex = 488 nm and λem = 516 nm). To derive the dissociation equilibrium constant (KD) of the SALS·G-actin complex, the SALS-WH2 concentration dependence of the fluorescence emission (I) and wavelength (λ) values were fit using Equations 1 and 2 (30Hertzog M.

The relative values of the fluorescence parameters were derived by dividing the values measured in the presence of SALS-WH2 by the value measured in the absence of SALS-WH2.

Polymerization of Mg2+-G-actin (2.5 μm, containing 5% pyrenyl-actin) was initiated by the addition of 1 mm MgCl2 and 50 mm KCl in the absence and presence of different concentrations of SALS constructs. Actin assembly was measured by monitoring the change in pyrenyl fluorescence emission using a Safas Xenius FLX spectrofluorimeter (λex = 365 nm and λem = 407 nm). The initial rate of actin assembly (v) was derived from the initial slope (0–500 s) of the pyrenyl traces and plotted as the function of SALS-WH2 concentration ([S]). Data were fitted using Equation 4 (30Hertzog M. Carlier M.F. Functional characterization of proteins regulating actin assembly.Curr. Protoc. Cell Biol. Chapter. 2005; 13 (Unit 13.16)Crossref Google Scholar), VV0=1−[SA][A0](Eq. 4) where v0 is the initial rate of actin assembly in the absence of SALS-WH2; A0 is the total actin concentration, and [SA] is the SALS-WH2·G-actin complex concentration, which was derived using the quadratic binding (Eq. 1), (Eq. 2), (Eq. 3). To study actin assembly at the pointed ends, gelsolin-actin seeds (GA2) were prepared by incubating 0.5 μm gelsolin and 1.1 μm G-actin in G buffer in the presence of excess CaCl2 (2.5 mm) (27Barkó S. Bugyi B. Carlier M.F. Gombos R. Matusek T. Mihály J. Nyitrai M. Characterization of the biochemical properties and biological function of the formin homology domains of Drosophila DAAM.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 13154-13169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The assembly of G-actin (1.2 μm, containing 5% pyrenyl-actin) was monitored from 33 nm GA2 in the absence or presence of different amounts of SALS-WH2 using a Safas Xenius FLX spectrofluorimeter (λex = 365 nm and λem = 407 nm). Pre-polymerized actin filaments (1 μm, containing 50% pyrenyl-actin) were diluted with F buffer (G buffer supplemented with 1 mm MgCl2 and 50 mm KCl) to 20 nm in the absence or presence of different amounts of SALS constructs, gelsolin (0.1 or 0.5 μm), or latrunculin A (20 μm). When tropomyosin was used first, the actin filaments were incubated with excess tropomyosin (4.5 μm) overnight at 4 °C and then the filaments were diluted with F buffer containing the same amount of tropomyosin (4.5 μm) to avoid dissociation of tropomyosin from the filaments due to dilution. Kinetics of actin filament disassembly was monitored by the decrease in pyrenyl fluorescence emission using a Horiba Jobin Yvon spectrofluorometer or a Safas Xenius FLX spectrofluorimeter (λex = 365 nm and λem = 407 nm). The fluorescence emission values were normalized by the value measured at t = 0 s (relative pyrenyl fluorescence). Mg2+-G-actin (containing 5% pyrenyl-actin) at different concentrations was polymerized and then either SALS-WH2 (0.5 μm or 1.5 μm) or gelsolin (0.01 μm) was added, and the samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C. The fluorescence emission of the samples was measured using a Horiba Jobin Yvon spectrofluorometer (λex = 365 nm and λem = 407 nm) and plotted as the function of the actin concentration ([actin]). The amount of unassembled actin (AU) is reflected by the breaking point of the [actin]-fluorescence intensity curve (J(c) plot). The steady-state pool of unassembled actin is composed of free G-actin (critical concentration, cC) and SALS-WH2-bound G-actin (SA). The concentration of SA ([SA]) can be given by Equation 5 (30Hertzog M. Carlier M.F. Functional characterization of proteins regulating actin assembly.Curr. Protoc. Cell Biol. Chapter. 2005; 13 (Unit 13.16)Crossref Google Scholar), [SA]=[S0]cccc+KD(Eq. 5) where S0 is the total SALS-WH2 concentration, and K is the dissociation equilibrium constant of the SALS-WH2·G-actin complex. Actin filaments (2.5 μm, containing 5% of pyrenyl-actin) were polymerized in the absence and presence of phalloidin (2.5 μm), jasplakinolide (2.5 μm), or tropomyosin (6 μm) overnight at 4 °C. Then different amounts of SALS-WH2 were added, and the samples were further incubated overnight at 4 °C. The fluorescence emission of the samples were measured using a Horiba Jobin Yvon spectrofluorometer (λex = 365 nm and λem = 407 nm). The value measured in the absence of SALS-WH2 was used to normalize emission values (relative pyrenyl fluorescence), and these were plotted against the SALS-WH2 concentration. Actin filaments (1, 1.5, or 2.5 μm) or phalloidin-stabilized actin filaments were incubated with different amounts of SALS-WH2 overnight at 4 °C. Phalloidin was added to actin filaments in an equimolar amount and incubated overnight at 4 °C prior to the addition of SALS-WH2. The samples were ultracentrifuged (Beckman tabletop ultracentrifuge, TLA 100 rotor, 300,000 × g, 30 min, 20 °C). The pellets (P) and supernata"
https://openalex.org/W2279374144,"We demonstrated in a previous study that murine double minute (Mdm)-2 is essential for exercise-induced skeletal muscle angiogenesis. In the current study, we investigated the mechanisms that regulate Mdm2 activity in response to acute exercise and identified VEGF-A as a key stimulator of Mdm2 phosphorylation on Ser(166) (p-Ser166-Mdm2). VEGF-A and p-Ser166-Mdm2 protein levels were measured in human and rodent muscle biopsy specimens after 1 bout of exercise. VEGF-A-dependent Mdm2 phosphorylation was demonstrated in vivo in mice harboring myofiber-specific deletion of VEGF-A (mVEGF(-/-)) and in vitro in primary human and rodent endothelial cells (ECs). Exercise increased VEGF-A and p-Ser166-Mdm2 protein levels respectively by 157 and 68% in human muscle vs. pre-exercise levels. Similar results were observed in exercised rodent muscles compared to sedentary controls; however, exercise-induced Mdm2 phosphorylation was significantly attenuated in mVEGF(-/-) mice. Recombinant VEGF-A elevated p-Ser166-Mdm2 by 50-125% and stimulated migration by 33% in ECs when compared to untreated cells, whereas the Mdm2 antagonist Nutlin-3a abrogated VEGF-driven EC migration. Finally, overexpression of a Ser166-Mdm2 phosphorylation mimetic increased EC migration, increased Mdm2 to FoxO1 binding (+55%), and decreased FoxO1-dependent gene expression compared with ECs overexpressing WT-Mdm2. Our results suggest that VEGF-mediated Mdm2 phosphorylation on Ser(166) is a novel proangiogenic pathway within the skeletal muscle."
https://openalex.org/W2173280396,"Groups of distinct but related diseases often share common symptoms, which suggest likely overlaps in underlying pathogenic mechanisms. Identifying the shared pathways and common factors among those disorders can be expected to deepen our understanding for them and help designing new treatment strategies effected on those diseases. Neurodegeneration diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and Huntington's disease (HD), were taken as a case study in this research. Reported susceptibility genes for AD, PD and HD were collected and human protein-protein interaction network (hPPIN) was used to identify biological pathways related to neurodegeneration. 81 KEGG pathways were found to be correlated with neurodegenerative disorders. 36 out of the 81 are human disease pathways, and the remaining ones are involved in miscellaneous human functional pathways. Cancers and infectious diseases are two major subclasses within the disease group. Apoptosis is one of the most significant functional pathways. Most of those pathways found here are actually consistent with prior knowledge of neurodegenerative diseases except two cell communication pathways: adherens and tight junctions. Gene expression analysis showed a high probability that the two pathways were related to neurodegenerative diseases. A combination of common susceptibility genes and hPPIN is an effective method to study shared pathways involved in a group of closely related disorders. Common modules, which might play a bridging role in linking neurodegenerative disorders and the enriched pathways, were identified by clustering analysis. The identified shared pathways and common modules can be expected to yield clues for effective target discovery efforts on neurodegeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2174893446,"The massive fluctuations occurring in Russian alcohol-related mortality since the mid-1980s cannot be seen outside of the context of great social and economic change. There is a dearth of qualitative studies about Russian male drinking and especially needed are those that address social processes and individual changes in drinking. Conducted as part of a longitudinal study on men's alcohol consumption in Izhevsk, this qualitative study uses 25 semi-structured biographical interviews with men aged 33-60 years to explore life course variation in drinking. The dominant pattern was decreasing binge and frequent drinking as men reached middle age which was precipitated by family building, reductions in drinking with work colleagues, and health concerns. A minority of men described chaotic drinking histories with periods of abstinence and heavy drinking. The results highlight the importance of the blue-collar work environment for conditioning male heavy drinking in young adulthood through a variety of social, normative and structural mechanisms. Post-Soviet changes had a structural influence on the propensity for workplace drinking but the important social function of male drinking sessions remained. Bonding with workmates through heavy drinking was seen as an unavoidable and essential part of young men's social life. With age peer pressure to drink decreased and the need to perform the role of responsible breadwinner put different behavioural demands on men. For some resisting social pressure to drink became an important site of self-determination and a mark of masculine maturity. Over the lifetime the place where masculine identity was asserted shifted from the workplace to the home, which commonly resulted in a reduction in drinking. We contribute to existing theories of Russian male drinking by showing that the performance of age-related social roles influences Russian men's drinking patterns, drinking contexts and their attitudes. Further research should be conducted investigating drinking trajectories in Russian men."
https://openalex.org/W2178548903,"The mediation of fluid homeostasis by multiple classes of aquaporins has been suggested to be essential during spermatogenesis and spermiation. In the marine teleost gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata), seven distinct aquaporins, Aqp0a, -1aa, -1ab, -7, -8b, -9b and -10b, are differentially expressed in the somatic and germ cell lineages of the spermiating testis, but the endocrine regulation of these channels during germ cell development is unknown. In this study, we investigated the in vivo developmental expression of aquaporins in the seabream testis together with plasma androgen concentrations. We then examined the in vitro regulatory effects of recombinant piscine gonadotropins, follicle-stimulating (rFsh) and luteinizing (rLh) hormones, and sex steroids on aquaporin mRNA levels during the spermatogenic cycle. During the resting phase, when plasma levels of androgens were low, the testis exclusively contained proliferating spermatogonia expressing Aqp1ab, whereas Aqp10b and -9b were localized in Sertoli and Leydig cells, respectively. At the onset of spermatogenesis and during spermiation, the increase of androgen plasma levels correlated with the additional appearance of Aqp0a and -7 in Sertoli cells, Aqp0a in spermatogonia and spermatocytes, Aqp1ab, -7 and -10b from spermatogonia to spermatozoa, and Aqp1aa and -8b in spermatids and spermatozoa. Short-term in vitro incubation of testis explants indicated that most aquaporins in Sertoli cells and early germ cells were upregulated by rFsh and/or rLh through androgen-dependent pathways, although Aqp1ab in proliferating spermatogonia was also activated by estrogens. However, expression of Aqp9b in Leydig cells, and of Aqp1aa and -7 in spermatocytes and spermatids, was also directly stimulated by rLh. These results reveal a complex gonadotropic control of aquaporin expression during seabream germ cell development, apparently involving both androgen-dependent and independent pathways, which may assure the fine tuning of aquaporin-mediated fluid secretion and absorption mechanisms in the seabream testis."
https://openalex.org/W2177194241,"Pile grade A (PGA) graphite was used as a material for moderating and reflecting neutrons in the UK's first generation Magnox nuclear power reactors. As all but one of these reactors are now shut down there is a need to understand the residual state of the material prior to decommissioning of the cores, in particular the location and concentration of key radio-contaminants such as 14C. The oxidation behaviour of unirradiated PGA graphite was studied, in the temperature range 600-1050°C, in air and nitrogen using thermogravimetric analysis, scanning electron microscopy and X-ray tomography to investigate the possibility of using thermal degradation techniques to examine 14C distribution within irradiated material. The thermal decomposition of PGA graphite was observed to follow the three oxidation regimes historically identified by previous workers with limited, uniform oxidation at temperatures below 600°C and substantial, external oxidation at higher temperatures. This work demonstrates that the different oxidation regimes of PGA graphite could be developed into a methodology to characterise the distribution and concentration of 14C in irradiated graphite by thermal treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2177709668,"In mammals, high parental testosterone levels present around the time of conception are thought to skew offspring sex ratio toward sons. The second to fourth digit ratio (digit ratio) is now widely accepted as a negative correlate of prenatal testosterone. Thus, we investigated the association between digit ratio and offspring sex ratio.A total of 508 Korean patients (257 males and 251 females) less than 60 years old who had one or more offspring were prospectively enrolled. The lengths of the 2nd and 4th digits of the right hand were measured by a single investigator using a digital vernier calliper. Next, the patients' lifetime offspring birth sex ratios were investigated.Maternal (rather than paternal) digit ratio was significantly associated with the number of sons (r = -0.153, p = 0.015), number of daughters (r = 0.130, p = 0.039), and offspring sex ratio (r = -0.171, p = 0.007). And, the maternal digit ratio was a significant factor for predicting offspring sex ratio (B = -1.620, p = 0.008) on multiple linear regression analysis. The female patients with a lower digit ratio (< 0.95) were found to have a higher offspring sex ratio (0.609 versus 0.521, p = 0.046) compared to those with a higher digit ratio (≥ 0.95). Furthermore, females in the low digit ratio group have a probability 1.138 greater of having sons than females in the high digit ratio group.Maternal digit ratio was negatively associated with offspring sex ratio. Females with a lower digit ratio were more likely to have more male offspring compared to those with a higher digit ratio. Thus, our results suggest that the sex of offspring might be more influenced by maternal rather than paternal factors."
https://openalex.org/W2178382936,"The HIV-1 Env spike is the main protein complex that facilitates HIV-1 entry into CD4+ host cells. HIV-1 entry is a multistep process that is not yet completely understood. This process involves several protein-protein interactions between HIV-1 Env and a variety of host cell receptors along with many conformational changes within the spike. HIV-1 Env developed due to high mutation rates and plasticity escape strategies from immense immune pressure and entry inhibitors. We applied a coevolution and residue-residue contact detecting method to identify coevolution patterns within HIV-1 Env protein sequences representing all group M subtypes. We identified 424 coevolving residue pairs within HIV-1 Env. The majority of predicted pairs are residue-residue contacts and are proximal in 3D structure. Furthermore, many of the detected pairs have functional implications due to contributions in either CD4 or coreceptor binding, or variable loop, gp120-gp41, and interdomain interactions. This study provides a new dimension of information in HIV research. The identified residue couplings may not only be important in assisting gp120 and gp41 coordinate structure prediction, but also in designing new and effective entry inhibitors that incorporate mutation patterns of HIV-1 Env."

https://openalex.org/W2269566677,"In practical applications of computed tomography imaging (CT), it is often the case that the set of projection data is incomplete owing to the physical conditions of the data acquisition process. On the other hand, the high radiation dose imposed on patients is also undesired. These issues demand that high quality CT images can be reconstructed from limited projection data. For this reason, iterative methods of image reconstruction have become a topic of increased research interest. Several algorithms have been proposed for few-view CT. We consider that the accurate solution of the reconstruction problem also depends on the system matrix that simulates the scanning process. In this work, we analyze the application of the Siddon method to generate elements of the matrix and we present results based on real projection data."
https://openalex.org/W2277853201,"Natural killer (NK) cells in the upper respiratory airways are not well characterized. In the current study, we sought to characterize and functionally assess murine nasal NK cells.Using immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry, we compared the nasal NK cells of Ncr1GFP/+ knock-in mice, whose NK cells produced green fluorescent protein, with their splenic and pulmonary counterparts. In addition, we functionally analyzed the nasal NK cells of these mice in vitro. To assess the in vivo functions of nasal NK cells, C57BL/6 mice depleted of NK cells after treatment with PK136 antibody were nasally infected with influenza virus PR8.Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed the presence of NK cells in the lamina propria of nasal mucosa, and flow cytometry showed that these cells were of NK cell lineage. The expression patterns of Ly49 receptor, CD11b/CD27, CD62L and CD69 revealed that nasal NK cells had an immature and activated phenotype compared with that of their splenic and pulmonary counterparts. Effector functions including degranulation and IFN(interferon)-γ production after in vitro stimulation with phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate plus ionomycin or IL(interleukin)-12 plus IL-18 were dampened in nasal NK cells, and the depletion of NK cells led to an increased influenza virus titer in nasal passages.The NK cells of the murine nasal passage belong to the conventional NK cell linage and characteristically demonstrate an immature and activated phenotype. Despite their hyporesponsiveness in vitro, nasal NK cells play important roles in the host defense against nasal influenza virus infection."
https://openalex.org/W2221484050,"Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) is characterized by a heightened antibody (Ab) response to pancreatic islet self-antigens, which is a biomarker of progressive islet pathology. We recently identified a novel antibody to clade B serpin that reduces islet-associated T cell accumulation and is linked to the delayed onset of T1D. As natural immunity to clade B arises early in life, we hypothesized that it may influence islet development during that time. To test this possibility healthy young Balb/c male mice were injected with serpin B13 mAb or IgG control and examined for the number and cellularity of pancreatic islets by immunofluorescence and FACS. Beta cell proliferation was assessed by measuring nucleotide analog 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (5-EdU) incorporation into the DNA and islet Reg gene expression was measured by real time PCR. Human studies involved measuring anti-serpin B13 autoantibodies by Luminex. We found that injecting anti-serpin B13 monoclonal Ab enhanced beta cell proliferation and Reg gene expression, induced the generation of ∼80 pancreatic islets per animal, and ultimately led to increase in the beta cell mass. These findings are relevant to human T1D because our analysis of subjects just diagnosed with T1D revealed an association between baseline anti-serpin activity and slower residual beta cell function decline in the first year after the onset of diabetes. Our findings reveal a new role for the anti-serpin immunological response in promoting adaptive changes in the endocrine pancreas and suggests that enhancement of this response could potentially help impede the progression of T1D in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2281358408,"Plant leaf litter is an important source of soil chemicals that are essential for the ecosystem and changes in leaf litter chemical traits during decomposition will determine the availability of multiple chemical elements recycling in the ecosystem. However, it is unclear whether the changes in litter chemical traits during decomposition and their similarities across species can be predicted, respectively, using other leaf traits or using the phylogenetic relatedness of the litter species. Here we examined the fragmentation levels, mass losses, and the changes of 10 litter chemical traits during 1-yr decomposition under different environmental conditions (within/above surrounding litter layer) for 48 temperate tree species and related them to an important leaf functional trait, i.e. leaf toughness. Leaf toughness could predict the changes well in terms of amounts, but poorly in terms of concentrations. Changes of 7 out of 10 litter chemical traits during decomposition showed a significant phylogenetic signal notably when litter was exposed above surrounding litter. These phylogenetic signals in element dynamics were stronger than those of initial elementary composition. Overall, relatively hard-to-measure ecosystem processes like element dynamics during decomposition could be partly predicted simply from phylogenies and leaf toughness measures. We suggest that the strong phylogenetic signals in chemical ecosystem functioning of species may reflect the concerted control by multiple moderately conserved traits, notably if interacting biota suffer microclimatic stress and spatial isolation from ambient litter."
https://openalex.org/W2245145092,"The relationship between the stem cells and the bone turnover in uremic bone disease due to chronic renal failure (CRF) is not described. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of bone turnover status on stem cell properties. To search for the presence of such link and shed some light on stem-cell relevant mechanisms of bone turnover, we carried out a study with mesenchymal stem cells. Tissue biopsies were taken from the abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue of a CRF patient with secondary hyperparathyroidism with the high turnover bone disease. This patient underwent parathyroidectomy operation (PTX) and another sample was taken from this patient after PTX. A CRF patient with adynamic bone disease with low turnover and a healthy control were also included. Mesenchymal stem cells isolated from the subjects were analyzed using proteomic and molecular approaches. Except ALP activity, the bone turnover status did not affect common stem cell properties. However, detailed proteome analysis revealed the presence of regulated protein spots. A total of 32 protein spots were identified following 2D gel electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF/TOF analyzes. The identified proteins were classified into seven distinct groups and their potential relationship to bone turnover were discussed. Distinct protein expression patterns emerged in relation to the bone turnover status indicate a possible link between the stem cells and bone turnover in uremic bone disease due to CRF."
https://openalex.org/W2179247584,"Vaccines based on nonspreading Rift Valley fever virus (NSR) induce strong humoral and robust cellular immune responses with pronounced Th1 polarisation. The present work was aimed to gain insight into the molecular basis of NSR-mediated immunity. Recent studies have demonstrated that wild-type Rift Valley fever virus efficiently targets and replicates in dendritic cells (DCs). We found that NSR infection of cultured human DCs results in maturation of DCs, characterized by surface upregulation of CD40, CD80, CD86, MHC-I and MHC-II and secretion of the proinflammatory cytokines IFN-β, IL-6 and TNF. Interestingly, expression of the most prominent marker of DC maturation, CD83, was consistently downregulated at 24 hours post infection. Remarkably, NSR infection also completely abrogated CD83 upregulation by LPS. Downregulation of CD83 was not associated with reduced mRNA levels or impaired CD83 mRNA transport from the nucleus and could not be prevented by inhibition of the proteasome or endocytic degradation pathways, suggesting that suppression occurs at the translational level. In contrast to infected cells, bystander DCs displayed full maturation as evidenced by upregulation of CD83. Our results indicate that bystander DCs play an important role in NSR-mediated immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2278315662,"The primate brain intelligently processes visual information from the world as the eyes move constantly. The brain must take into account visual motion induced by eye movements, so that visual information about the outside world can be recovered. Certain neurons in the dorsal part of monkey medial superior temporal area (MSTd) play an important role in integrating information about eye movements and visual motion. When a monkey tracks a moving target with its eyes, these neurons respond to visual motion as well as to smooth pursuit eye movements. Furthermore, the responses of some MSTd neurons to the motion of objects in the world are very similar during pursuit and during fixation, even though the visual information on the retina is altered by the pursuit eye movement. We call these neurons compensatory pursuit neurons. In this study we develop a computational model of MSTd compensatory pursuit neurons based on physiological data from single unit studies. Our model MSTd neurons can simulate the velocity tuning of monkey MSTd neurons. The model MSTd neurons also show the pursuit compensation property. We find that pursuit compensation can be achieved by divisive interaction between signals coding eye movements and signals coding visual motion. The model generates two implications that can be tested in future experiments: (1) compensatory pursuit neurons in MSTd should have the same direction preference for pursuit and retinal visual motion; (2) there should be non-compensatory pursuit neurons that show opposite preferred directions of pursuit and retinal visual motion."
