https://openalex.org/W2792021903,"A few commonly used non-antibiotic drugs have recently been associated with changes in gut microbiome composition, but the extent of this phenomenon is unknown. Here, we screened more than 1,000 marketed drugs against 40 representative gut bacterial strains, and found that 24% of the drugs with human targets, including members of all therapeutic classes, inhibited the growth of at least one strain in vitro. Particular classes, such as the chemically diverse antipsychotics, were overrepresented in this group. The effects of human-targeted drugs on gut bacteria are reflected on their antibiotic-like side effects in humans and are concordant with existing human cohort studies. Susceptibility to antibiotics and human-targeted drugs correlates across bacterial species, suggesting common resistance mechanisms, which we verified for some drugs. The potential risk of non-antibiotics promoting antibiotic resistance warrants further exploration. Our results provide a resource for future research on drug-microbiome interactions, opening new paths for side effect control and drug repurposing, and broadening our view of antibiotic resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2759280193,"The kagome lattice is a two-dimensional network of corner-sharing triangles that is known to host exotic quantum magnetic states. Theoretical work has predicted that kagome lattices may also host Dirac electronic states that could lead to topological and Chern insulating phases, but these states have so far not been detected in experiments. Here we study the d-electron kagome metal Fe3Sn2, which is designed to support bulk massive Dirac fermions in the presence of ferromagnetic order. We observe a temperature-independent intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity that persists above room temperature, which is suggestive of prominent Berry curvature from the time-reversal-symmetry-breaking electronic bands of the kagome plane. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we observe a pair of quasi-two-dimensional Dirac cones near the Fermi level with a mass gap of 30 millielectronvolts, which correspond to massive Dirac fermions that generate Berry-curvature-induced Hall conductivity. We show that this behaviour is a consequence of the underlying symmetry properties of the bilayer kagome lattice in the ferromagnetic state and the atomic spin-orbit coupling. This work provides evidence for a ferromagnetic kagome metal and an example of emergent topological electronic properties in a correlated electron system. Our results provide insight into the recent discoveries of exotic electronic behaviour in kagome-lattice antiferromagnets and may enable lattice-model realizations of fractional topological quantum states."
https://openalex.org/W2793201005,"Oligodendrocyte generation in the adult CNS provides a means to adapt the properties of circuits to changes in life experience. However, little is known about the dynamics of oligodendrocytes and the extent of myelin remodeling in the mature brain. Using longitudinal in vivo two-photon imaging of oligodendrocytes and their progenitors in the mouse cerebral cortex, we show that myelination is an inefficient and extended process, with half of the final complement of oligodendrocytes generated after 4 months of age. Oligodendrocytes that successfully integrated formed new sheaths on unmyelinated and sparsely myelinated axons, and they were extremely stable, gradually changing the pattern of myelination. Sensory enrichment robustly increased oligodendrocyte integration, but did not change the length of existing sheaths. This experience-dependent enhancement of myelination in the mature cortex may accelerate information transfer in these circuits and strengthen the ability of axons to sustain activity by providing additional metabolic support."

https://openalex.org/W2796422959,"Stimuli that elicit itch are detected by sensory neurons that innervate the skin. This information is processed by the spinal cord; however, the way in which this occurs is still poorly understood. Here we investigated the neuronal pathways for itch neurotransmission, particularly the contribution of the neuropeptide somatostatin. We find that in the periphery, somatostatin is exclusively expressed in Nppb+ neurons, and we demonstrate that Nppb+somatostatin+ cells function as pruriceptors. Employing chemogenetics, pharmacology and cell-specific ablation methods, we demonstrate that somatostatin potentiates itch by inhibiting inhibitory dynorphin neurons, which results in disinhibition of GRPR+ neurons. Furthermore, elimination of somatostatin from primary afferents and/or from spinal interneurons demonstrates differential involvement of the peptide released from these sources in itch and pain. Our results define the neural circuit underlying somatostatin-induced itch and characterize a contrasting antinociceptive role for the peptide."
https://openalex.org/W2793882579,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis–frontotemporal dementia (ALS-FTD) constitutes a devastating disease spectrum characterized by 43-kDa TAR DNA-binding protein (TDP-43) pathology. Understanding how TDP-43 contributes to neurodegeneration will help direct therapeutic efforts. Here we have created a TDP-43 knock-in mouse with a human-equivalent mutation in the endogenous mouse Tardbp gene. TDP-43Q331K mice demonstrate cognitive dysfunction and a paucity of parvalbumin interneurons. Critically, TDP-43 autoregulation is perturbed, leading to a gain of TDP-43 function and altered splicing of Mapt, another pivotal dementia-associated gene. Furthermore, a new approach to stratify transcriptomic data by phenotype in differentially affected mutant mice revealed 471 changes linked with improved behavior. These changes included downregulation of two known modifiers of neurodegeneration, Atxn2 and Arid4a, and upregulation of myelination and translation genes. With one base change in murine Tardbp, this study identifies TDP-43 misregulation as a pathogenic mechanism that may underpin ALS-FTD and exploits phenotypic heterogeneity to yield candidate suppressors of neurodegenerative disease. TDP-43 gains function due to perturbed autoregulation in a Tardbp knock-in mouse model of ALS-FTD, leading to aberrant Mapt splicing and a paucity of parvalbumin interneurons. Phenotypic heterogeneity is exploited to yield modifiers of disease."
https://openalex.org/W2793848630,"Surgery for brain cancer is a major problem in neurosurgery. The diffuse infiltration into the surrounding normal brain by these tumors makes their accurate identification by the naked eye difficult. Since surgery is the common treatment for brain cancer, an accurate radical resection of the tumor leads to improved survival rates for patients. However, the identification of the tumor boundaries during surgery is challenging. Hyperspectral imaging is a non-contact, non-ionizing and non-invasive technique suitable for medical diagnosis. This study presents the development of a novel classification method taking into account the spatial and spectral characteristics of the hyperspectral images to help neurosurgeons to accurately determine the tumor boundaries in surgical-time during the resection, avoiding excessive excision of normal tissue or unintentionally leaving residual tumor. The algorithm proposed in this study to approach an efficient solution consists of a hybrid framework that combines both supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods. Firstly, a supervised pixel-wise classification using a Support Vector Machine classifier is performed. The generated classification map is spatially homogenized using a one-band representation of the HS cube, employing the Fixed Reference t-Stochastic Neighbors Embedding dimensional reduction algorithm, and performing a K-Nearest Neighbors filtering. The information generated by the supervised stage is combined with a segmentation map obtained via unsupervised clustering employing a Hierarchical K-Means algorithm. The fusion is performed using a majority voting approach that associates each cluster with a certain class. To evaluate the proposed approach, five hyperspectral images of surface of the brain affected by glioblastoma tumor in vivo from five different patients have been used. The final classification maps obtained have been analyzed and validated by specialists. These preliminary results are promising, obtaining an accurate delineation of the tumor area."
https://openalex.org/W2790544980,"Ancient shorelines on Mars must have formed before and during the emplacement of the Tharsis volcanic province, instead of afterwards as previously assumed, suggesting that oceans on Mars formed early. The observation of potential palaeo-shorelines around the northern plains of Mars points to the existence of an ancient Martian ocean. However, these features do not seem to follow an equipotential surface, which would argue against an oceanic origin. The varying elevation of these shorelines could be explained by true polar wander occurring after the formation of Tharsis, a volcanic province that dominates the gravity and topography of Mars. However, this would require Tharsis to have formed far from the equator, which is thought to be unlikely. Robert Citron and co-authors show that variations in shoreline topography can instead be explained if the shorelines formed before and during the emplacement of Tharsis, implying that oceans formed early on Mars, potentially in relation to the initiation and decline of Tharsis volcanism. Widespread evidence points to the existence of an ancient Martian ocean1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Most compelling are the putative ancient shorelines in the northern plains2,7. However, these shorelines fail to follow an equipotential surface, and this has been used to challenge the notion that they formed via an early ocean9 and hence to question the existence of such an ocean. The shorelines’ deviation from a constant elevation can be explained by true polar wander occurring after the formation of Tharsis10, a volcanic province that dominates the gravity and topography of Mars. However, surface loading from the oceans can drive polar wander only if Tharsis formed far from the equator10, and most evidence indicates that Tharsis formed near the equator11,12,13,14,15, meaning that there is no current explanation for the shorelines’ deviation from an equipotential that is consistent with our geophysical understanding of Mars. Here we show that variations in shoreline topography can be explained by deformation caused by the emplacement of Tharsis. We find that the shorelines must have formed before and during the emplacement of Tharsis, instead of afterwards, as previously assumed. Our results imply that oceans on Mars formed early, concurrent with the valley networks15, and point to a close relationship between the evolution of oceans on Mars and the initiation and decline of Tharsis volcanism, with broad implications for the geology, hydrological cycle and climate of early Mars."
https://openalex.org/W2791305882,"Transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) channels TRPC3, TRPC6 and TRPC7 are able to sense the lipid messenger diacylglycerol (DAG). The DAG-sensing and lipid-gating processes in these ion channels are still unknown. To gain insights into the lipid-sensing principle, we generated a DAG photoswitch, OptoDArG, that enabled efficient control of TRPC3 by light. A structure-guided mutagenesis screen of the TRPC3 pore domain unveiled a single glycine residue behind the selectivity filter (G652) that is exposed to lipid through a subunit-joining fenestration. Exchange of G652 with larger residues altered the ability of TRPC3 to discriminate between different DAG molecules. Light-controlled activation-deactivation cycling of TRPC3 channels by an OptoDArG-mediated optical 'lipid clamp' identified pore domain fenestrations as pivotal elements of the channel´s lipid-sensing machinery. We provide evidence for a novel concept of lipid sensing by TRPC channels based on a lateral fenestration in the pore domain that accommodates lipid mediators to control gating."
https://openalex.org/W2792254596,"Despite their evolutionary, developmental and functional importance, the origin of vertebrate paired appendages remains uncertain. In mice, a single enhancer termed ZRS is solely responsible for Shh expression in limbs. Here, zebrafish and mouse transgenic assays trace the functional equivalence of ZRS across the gnathostome phylogeny. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of the medaka (Oryzias latipes) ZRS and enhancer assays identify the existence of ZRS shadow enhancers in both teleost and human genomes. Deletion of both ZRS and shadow ZRS abolishes shh expression and completely truncates pectoral fin formation. Strikingly, deletion of ZRS results in an almost complete ablation of the dorsal fin. This finding indicates that a ZRS-Shh regulatory module is shared by paired and median fins and that paired fins likely emerged by the co-option of developmental programs established in the median fins of stem gnathostomes. Shh function was later reinforced in pectoral fin development with the recruitment of shadow enhancers, conferring additional robustness."

https://openalex.org/W2791840451,"Many fossil specimens exhibit deformations caused by taphonomic processes. Due to these deformations, even important specimens have to be excluded from morphometric analyses, impoverishing an already poor paleontological record. Techniques to retrodeform and virtually restore damaged (i.e. deformed) specimens are available, but these methods genenerally imply the use of a sparse set of bilateral landmarks, ignoring the fact that the distribution and amount of control points directly affects the result of the retrodeformation. We propose a method developed in the R environment and available in the R-package “Morpho” that, in addition to the landmark configurations, also allows using a set of semi-landmarks homogeneously distributed along curves and on surfaces. We evaluated the outcome of the retrodeformation, regarding the number of semi-landmarks used and its robustness against asymmetric noise, based on simulations using a virtually deformed gorilla cranium. Finally, we applied the method to a well-known Neanderthal cranium that exhibits signs of taphonomically induced asymmetry."
https://openalex.org/W2795823040,"Plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 (PVT1) is an lncRNA that plays vital roles in breast cancer (BC) pathogenesis. Increasing evidence suggests that miRNAs that reside in the PVT1 locus are the main driver of the oncogenic roles of PVT1 in cancer. However, the oncogenic role and underlying mechanism of miR-1204, located in the PVT1 locus, in human cancer is still unclear. In this study, we discovered that increased expression of miR-1204 is associated with poor prognosis in BC. Moreover, miR-1204 promotes proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition and invasion of BC cells both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistic investigations demonstrated that VDR is a novel target gene of miR-1204. Interference of VDR restored miR-1204-mediated BC cell proliferation, tumorigenesis, and metastasis. Collectively, our results demonstrated that the miR-1204-VDR pathway exerts oncogenic effects in BC with potential therapeutic applications in blocking BC development and progression."
https://openalex.org/W2790157098,"Climate change has been identified as the primary threat to the integrity and functioning of ecosystems in this century, although there is still much uncertainty about its effects and the degree of vulnerability for different ecosystems to this threat. Here we propose a new methodological approach capable of measuring and mapping the resilience of terrestrial ecosystems at large scales based on their climatic niche. To do this, we used high spatial resolution remote sensing data and ecological niche modeling techniques to calculate and spatialize the resilience of three stable states of ecosystems in South America: forest, savanna, and grassland. Also, we evaluated the sensitivity of ecosystems to climate stress, the likelihood of exposure to non-analogous climatic conditions, and their respective adaptive capacities in the face of climate change. Our results indicate that forests, the most productive and biodiverse terrestrial ecosystems on the earth, are more vulnerable to climate change than savannas or grasslands. Forests showed less resistance to climate stress and a higher chance of exposure to non-analogous climatic conditions. If this scenario occurs, the forest ecosystems would have less chance of adaptation compared to savannas or grasslands because of their narrow climate niche. Therefore, we can conclude that a possible consolidation of non-analogous climatic conditions would lead to a loss of resilience in the forest ecosystem, significantly increasing the chance of a critical transition event to another stable state with a lower density of vegetation cover (e.g., savanna or grassland)."
https://openalex.org/W2791526053,"Histone acetylation plays crucial roles in transcriptional regulation and chromatin organization. Viral RNA of the influenza virus interacts with its nucleoprotein (NP), whose function corresponds to that of eukaryotic histones. NP regulates viral replication and has been shown to undergo acetylation by the cAMP-response element (CRE)–binding protein (CBP) from the host. However, whether NP is the target of other host acetyltransferases is unknown. Here, we show that influenza virus NP undergoes acetylation by the two host acetyltransferases GCN5 and P300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) and that this modification affects viral polymerase activities. Western blot analysis with anti–acetyl-lysine antibody on cultured A549 human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cells infected with different influenza virus strains indicated acetylation of the viral NP. A series of biochemical analyses disclosed that the host lysine acetyltransferases GCN5 and PCAF acetylate NP in vitro. MS experiments identified three lysine residues as acetylation targets in the host cells and suggested that Lys-31 and Lys-90 are acetylated by PCAF and GCN5, respectively. RNAi-mediated silencing of GCN5 and PCAF did not change acetylation levels of NP. However, interestingly, viral polymerase activities were increased by the PCAF silencing and were decreased by the GCN5 silencing, suggesting that acetylation of the Lys-31 and Lys-90 residues has opposing effects on viral replication. Our findings suggest that epigenetic control of NP via acetylation by host acetyltransferases contributes to regulation of polymerase activity in the influenza A virus."
https://openalex.org/W2792363584,"Microbial toluene biosynthesis was reported in anoxic lake sediments more than three decades ago, but the enzyme catalyzing this biochemically challenging reaction has never been identified. Here we report the toluene-producing enzyme PhdB, a glycyl radical enzyme of bacterial origin that catalyzes phenylacetate decarboxylation, and its cognate activating enzyme PhdA, a radical S-adenosylmethionine enzyme, discovered in two distinct anoxic microbial communities that produce toluene. The unconventional process of enzyme discovery from a complex microbial community (>300,000 genes), rather than from a microbial isolate, involved metagenomics- and metaproteomics-enabled biochemistry, as well as in vitro confirmation of activity with recombinant enzymes. This work expands the known catalytic range of glycyl radical enzymes (only seven reaction types had been characterized previously) and aromatic-hydrocarbon-producing enzymes, and will enable first-time biochemical synthesis of an aromatic fuel hydrocarbon from renewable resources, such as lignocellulosic biomass, rather than from petroleum. The source of biological toluene production in diverse anoxic microbial communities is a glycyl radical enzyme that catalyzes phenylacetate decarboxylation (PhdB), and its cognate activating radical S-adenosylmethionine enzyme (PhdA)."
https://openalex.org/W2791987126,"Due to low efficacy of classic antimicrobial drugs, finding new active preparations attracts much attention. In this study an innovative, cost-effective and environmentally friendly method was applied to produce silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using filamentous fungi Metarhizium robertsii biomass waste. It was shown that these NPs possess prominent antifungal effects against C. albicans, C. glabrata and C. parapsilosis reference strains. Further detailed studies were performed on C. albicans ATCC 90028. AgNPs kill curve (CFU method and esterase-mediated reduction of fluorescein diacetate); fractionally inhibitory concentration index (FICI) with fluconazole (FLC); effect on fungal cell membrane permeability (propidium iodide (PI) staining), membrane lipids profile (HPLC-MS), yeast morphotypes and intracellular reactive oxygen species level (H2DCFDA probe) were investigated. Anti-adhesive and anti-biofilm properties of AgNPs (alone and in combination with FLC) were also tested. Biosafety of AgNPs use was assessed in vitro in cytotoxicity tests against L929 fibroblasts, pulmonary epithelial A549 cell line, and red blood cells. Significant reduction in the viability of yeast cells treated with AgNPs was shown within 6 h. The proportion of C. albicans PI-positive cells increased in a dose and time-dependent manner. Changes in the qualitative and quantitative profile of cell membrane lipids, including significant decline in the quantity of most phospholipid species containing C18:2 and an increase in the amount of phospholipids containing C18:1 acyl species were observed after yeast exposure to AgNPs. CLSM images showed an enhancement in ROS intracellular accumulation in C. albicans treated with biogenic nanosilver. C. albicans transformation from yeast to hyphal forms was also reduced. AgNPs decreased adhesion of yeast to abiotic surfaces, as well as acted synergistically with FLC against sessile population. At fungicidal and fungistatic concentrations, they were non-toxic to mammalian cells. Obtained results confirm suitability of our ""green synthesis"" method to produce AgNPs with therapeutic potential against fungal infections."
https://openalex.org/W2792159996,"Tuberculosis places a staggering burden on human health globally. The new World Health Organisation End-TB Strategy has highlighted the urgent need for more effective TB vaccines to improve control of the disease. Protein-based subunit vaccines offer potential as safe and effective generators of protective immunity, and the use of particulate vaccine formulation and delivery by the pulmonary route may enhance local immunogenicity. In this study, novel particulate subunit vaccines were developed utilising biodegradable poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) slow-release particles as carriers for the Mycobacterium tuberculosis lipoprotein MPT83, together with the adjuvants trehalose-dibehenate (TDB) or Monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL). Following delivery by the pulmonary or subcutaneous routes, the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of these vaccines were assessed in a murine model of M. tuberculosis infection. When delivered peripherally, these vaccines induced modest, antigen-specific Th1 and Th17 responses, but strong anti-MPT83 antibody responses. Mucosal delivery of the PLGA(MPT83) vaccine, with or without TDB, increased antigen-specific Th17 responses in the lungs, however, PLGA-encapsulated vaccines did not provide protection against M. tuberculosis challenge. By contrast, peripheral delivery of DDA liposomes containing MPT83 and TDB or MPL, stimulated both Th1 and Th17 responses and generated protection against M. tuberculosis challenge. Therefore, PLGA-formulated vaccines primarily stimulate strong humoral immunity, or Th17 responses if used mucosally, and may be a suitable carrier for vaccines against extracellular pathogens. This study emphasises the critical nature of the vaccine carrier, adjuvant and route of delivery for optimising vaccine efficacy against TB."

Despite their lean phenotype, adult male znt7-KO mice are prone to insulin resistance. We hypothesized that fat partitioning from adipose to nonadipose tissues causes insulin resistance in znt7-KO mice. Here, we used biological and biochemical methods, including fatty acid and oxylipin profiling, EM, immunohistochemistry, quantitative RT-PCR, and Western blot analysis, to identify the underlying mechanism of insulin resistance in znt7-KO mice. We found that insulin resistance in this model was primarily associated with increased intracellular fatty acid levels in the skeletal muscle, which promoted intracellular lipid accumulation and production of bioactive lipid mediators, such as 12,13-dihydroxyoctadecanoic acid (12,13-DiHOME) and 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE). The expression of fatty acid–binding protein 3 (Fabp3) was dramatically up-regulated in the znt7-KO muscle cells accompanied by increased expression of Cd36, Slc27a1, and Slc27a4, the three major fatty acid transporters in the skeletal muscle. We also demonstrated that znt7-KO muscle cells had increased fatty acid oxidative capacity, indicated by enlarged mitochondria and increased mRNA or protein expression of key enzymes involved in the fatty acid mitochondrial shuttle and β-oxidation. We conclude that increased fatty acid uptake in the znt7-KO skeletal muscle is a key factor that contributes to the excessive intracellular lipid deposit and elevated production of bioactive lipid mediators.

In general, Slc30a family members (Slc30a1–10) are involved in sequestration of zinc into intracellular compartments or export of zinc out of the cell when cellular zinc is in excess. In contrast, Slc39a family members (Slc39a1–14) play roles in either zinc uptake from the extracellular space or zinc release from the intracellular stores into the cytoplasm when cellular zinc concentration is low (1Huang L.

We showed that the abnormality in glucose metabolism was attributed to the disruption of insulin metabolism in pancreatic β-cells in znt7-KO mice (4Huang L. Kirschke C.P. Lay Y.A. Levy L.B.

The underlying molecular mechanism by which the znt7-null mutation leads to peripheral insulin resistance in znt7-knockout mice is still unknown. We reported previously that the znt7-null mutation decreased lipid accumulation in mouse adipose tissue (5Tepaamorndech S. Kirschke C.P. Pedersen T.L. Keyes W.R. Newman J.W. Huang L. Zinc transporter 7 deficiency affects lipid synthesis in adipocytes by inhibiting insulin-dependent Akt activation and glucose uptake.FEBS J. 2016; 283 (26524605): 378-39410.1111/febs.13582Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Hence, we hypothesized that insulin resistance in the muscle of znt7-KO mice might be the result of fat partitioning from adipose to nonadipose tissues. According to the ZnT7 protein expression pattern in the skeletal muscle (abundant) and liver (undetectable in hepatocytes), we further hypothesized that the lipid partitioning in the znt7-KO mouse mainly occurred in the skeletal muscle but not the liver. In this study, we used fatty acid and oxylipin profiling, EM, immunohistochemistry, quantitative RT-PCR, and Western blot analysis to probe the underlying mechanism of insulin resistance in the skeletal muscle of znt7-KO mice. Here, we provide evidence that insulin resistance in znt7-KO mice is associated with increased uptake and binding of free fatty acids in the muscle cell. Bioactive lipid mediators were elevated in the skeletal muscle of znt7-KO mice and showed the potential to drive insulin resistance. In addition, we demonstrated that the fatty acid oxidative capacity of znt7-KO muscle cells was increased, evident by the enlarged mitochondria, increased mRNA and protein expression of key enzymes involved in fatty acid mitochondrial shuttle and β-oxidation, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. We previously demonstrated that adult male znt7-KO mice were more sensitive to high fat diet–induced abnormalities in glucose and insulin metabolism than the WT control mice (4Huang L. Kirschke C.P. Lay Y.A. Levy L.B. Lamirande D.E. Zhang P.H. Znt7-null mice are more susceptible to diet-induced glucose intolerance and insulin resistance.J. Biol.

We have also shown that znt7-KO mice gain less body weight than the controls mainly due to reduced body fat accumulation (10Huang L. Yu Y.Y. Kirschke C.P. Gertz E.R. Lloyd K.K. Znt7 (Slc30a7)-deficient mice display reduced body zinc status and body fat accumulation.J. Biol.

Hence, we hypothesized that znt7-KO mice had dysregulation of lipid metabolism and that this genetically predisposed factor might render the znt7-KO mouse sensitive to high fat diet–induced glucose intolerance. We therefore studied a cohort of 18.5-week-old male znt7-KO and age-matched male WT littermates to determine the underlying mechanism of insulin resistance in metabolically relevant tissues, such as the skeletal muscle and liver. znt7-KO mice used in this study were congenic mice with a C57BL/6J (B6) genetic background in which the znt7 allele (129P2) was backcrossed to the B6 strain for at least 12 generations. The KO and WT mice were littermates; therefore, both the znt7-KO and WT mice were genetically identical except for the znt7 allele and its flanking regions on chromosome 3. The study design is laid out in Fig. 1A. Both genotypes of mice were fed a semipurified diet containing 30 mg of zinc/kg of diet starting at 5 weeks of age. Difference in body weight was seen around 9–10 weeks of age and became significant at 13 weeks between the two genotype groups (Fig. 1B). We observed that mice in both znt7-KO and WT groups gained limited weight 1 week after they were singly housed at 11 weeks of age. But the body weight gain resumed from 13 weeks until euthanization at 18.5 weeks (Fig. 1B). Table 1 lists the measurements of body weights, fat pad weights, and organ weights at necrosis. As we expected, when compared with the WT controls, znt7-KO mice accumulated less body fat as measured by individual or total fat pad weights (epididymal, subcutaneous, and retroperitoneal fat pads). When adjusting the body fat (total measured fat pad weights) to the body weight, znt7-KO mice appeared leaner than the WT controls at 18.5 weeks (Table 1), consistent with our previous findings in znt7-KO mice with a mixed B6 and 129P2 genetic background (10Huang L.

The weights of other organs, including the liver, heart, and brain, were not apparently different between the two genotypes (Table 1). Food intake was decreased in the KO group (Fig. 1C). However, when the food intake was adjusted for the body weight gain, the food intake per gram of body weight gain was comparable between the two genotype groups (Fig. 1D), suggesting a similar growth efficiency.Table 1Body and tissue weights in znt7-KO and WT control miceznt7-KO (n = 6)WT (n = 6)p valueaStudent's t test was used for calculation of p values;Body weight (BW)24.75 ± 0.5426.10 ± 0.540.070Fat mass (mg)Epididymal fat201.03 ± 13.22292.25 ± 34.530.016*statistically significant.Femoral subcutaneous fat161.93 ± 10.95236.25 ± 19.010.003*statistically significant.Retroperitoneal fat32.38 ± 5.2563.22 ± 12.270.022*statistically significant.Percentage of total fat pads to BW1.80 ± 0.092.51 ± 0.240.011*statistically significant.Liver (mg)871.55 ± 19.74938.13 ± 44.470.101Percentage of liver to BW3.98 ± 0.043.99 ± 0.190.484Heart (mg)116.55 ± 5.87116.00 ± 5.890.474Brain (mg)378.90 ± 12.30407.85 ± 10.940.055a Student's t test was used for calculation of p values;* statistically significant. Open table in a new tab Overnight fasting plasma triglycerides and cholesterol levels were slightly low in znt7-KO mice compared with the WT controls, whereas overnight fasting glucose and total fatty acid levels were similar between the two genotypes (Table 2). In contrast, an elevated blood glucose level (17%, p < 0.01) was observed in znt7-KO mice compared with the controls after short-term fasting (6 h), suggesting abnormal glucose metabolism in znt7-KO mice. Nevertheless, the increased 6-h fasting glucose level in znt7-KO mice was not accompanied by an elevated blood insulin level (Table 2). The effect of the znt7-KO on the whole-body glucose metabolism was further confirmed by glucose and insulin tolerance tests. As shown in Fig. 2A, znt7-KO mice had a higher blood glucose level than the controls at 120 min (p < 0.05) after a glucose load (Fig. 2A). Plasma insulin levels in znt7-KO mice during glucose tolerance tests were not significantly changed compared with the controls (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, blood glucose levels in znt7-KO mice during insulin tolerance tests were higher than those of the controls, suggesting a resistance to the blood glucose-lowering effect of exogenously administered insulin in znt7-KO mice (Fig. 2C). This resistance was also reflected by the area under the curve glucose measurements of the insulin tolerance test (Fig. 2D). Taken together, our data suggest that znt7-KO mice had impaired glucose tolerance, likely due to insulin resistance.Table 2Blood chemistry parameters in znt7-KO and WT control miceznt7-KO (n = 6)WT (n = 6)p valueaStudent's t test was used for calculation of p values;Blood glucose, 16 h fasting (mg/dl)92.67 ± 3.8487.30 ± 14.690.366Blood glucose, 6 h fasting (mg/dl)217.17 ± 5.68185.50 ± 8.84<0.01*statistically significant.Plasma insulin, 6 h fasting (ng/ml)0.35 ± 0.120.31 ± 0.030.269Plasma triglycerides, 16 h fasting (mg/dl)47.06 ± 1.3151.69 ± 2.17<0.05*statistically significant.Plasma cholesterol, 16 h fasting (mg/dl)71.88 ± 1.6781.88 ± 3.210.05Plasma total fatty acids, 16 h fasting (mm)8.50 ± 2.897.95 ± 2.990.103a Student's t test was used for calculation of p values;* statistically significant. Open table in a new tab The homeostatic control of blood glucose levels is largely accomplished by the skeletal muscle, liver, and adipose tissue in which the muscle takes up and utilizes about 70–80% of daily absorbed glucose (12DeFronzo R.A. Tripathy D. Skeletal muscle insulin resistance is the primary defect in type 2 diabetes.Diabetes Care. 2009; 32 (19875544): S157-S16310.2337/dc09-S302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown that the activity of the insulin signaling pathway and glucose uptake are compromised by znt7 knockdown in adipocytes, leading to a reduction in fat accumulation (5Tepaamorndech S. Kirschke C.P. Pedersen T.L. Keyes W.R. Newman J.W. Huang L. Zinc transporter 7 deficiency affects lipid synthesis in adipocytes by inhibiting insulin-dependent Akt activation and glucose uptake.FEBS J. 2016; 283 (26524605): 378-39410.1111/febs.13582Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesized that fat partitioning from adipose to nonadipose tissues might be the underlying mechanism of insulin resistance observed in znt7-KO mice. Hence, we performed metabolomic profiling of fatty acids in the skeletal muscle and liver from znt7-KO and the control mice. As shown in Fig. 3A, the total fatty acid content in the skeletal muscle of znt7-KO mice was 35% higher than that of the control mice (p < 0.05). The sum of concentrations of saturated (SFA), monounsaturated (MUFA), and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) was elevated in the skeletal muscle of znt7-KO mice compared with that of the controls. The ratio of ω-3 PUFA to ω-6 PUFA was decreased (KO, 0.56 versus WT, 0.66), suggesting an increased risk for insulin resistance in the skeletal muscle of znt7-KO mice. In addition, fatty acid composition analysis indicated that elevated fatty acids were mostly concentrated in the long-chain fatty acid group (Fig. 3C). The relative abundance of C18:1(n-9) to C18:0 was increased in the muscle of znt7-KO mice (p = 0.038), consistent with elevated stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 activity, which has been reported to contribute to abnormal lipid partitioning and insulin resistance (13Hulver M.W. Berggren J.R. Carper M.J. Miyazaki M. Ntambi J.M. Hoffman E.P. Thyfault J.P. Stevens R. Dohm G.L. Houmard J.A. Muoio D.M. Elevated stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 expression in skeletal muscle contributes to abnormal fatty acid partitioning in obese humans.Cell Metab. 2005; 2 (16213227): 251-26110.1016/j.cmet.2005.09.002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Arachidonic acid (C20:4(n-6)), a key inflammatory intermediate in skeletal muscle (14Korotkova M. Lundberg I.E. The skeletal muscle arachidonic acid cascade in health and inflammatory disease.Nat. Rev. Rheumatol. 2014; 10 (24468934): 295-30310.1038/nrrheum.2014.2Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), was also increased by ∼25% in the znt7-KO muscle compared with the controls (p = 0.029) (Fig. 3C). Meanwhile, the anti-inflammatory docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6(n-3)) (15Calder P.C. ω-3 fatty acids and inflammatory processes.Nutrients. 2010; 2 (22254027): 355-37410.3390/nu2030355Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar) was increased by ∼30% in the znt7-KO muscle compared with the controls (p = 0.043). Regardless, the balance of the pro- and anti-inflammatory long-chain fatty acids appeared to be unchanged in the znt7-KO muscle (p = 0.5). In contrast to the changes observed in the znt7-KO muscle, little to no change in the total fatty acid content or composition was observed in the liver of znt7-KO compared with the control mice (Fig. 3, B and D). This discrepancy may be associated with the difference in ZnT7 protein expression levels in the two tissues (Fig. 3, C and D, insets). We showed that ZnT7 was readily detectable in the sarcoplasm of the myofibril, whereas ZnT7 was absent from the hepatocyte. Only the sinusoid endothelial cell in the liver stained positive for ZnT7 (Fig. 3, C and D, insets). To examine whether increased fatty acid content leads to an increased lipid accumulation in the skeletal muscle of znt7-KO mice, we stained the femoral skeletal muscle prepared from znt7-KO and WT mice with Oil Red O, a dye that detects neutral lipids. As shown in Fig. 4A, lipid accumulation was noticeably increased in the myofibrils of znt7-KO mice compared with the controls. This observation was further confirmed by triglyceride quantification in the skeletal muscle of znt7-KO and WT mice. We showed that znt7-KO skeletal muscle contained ∼50% higher triglycerides than the control (Fig. 4B). Together, we conclude that znt7-KO impairs lipid metabolism in the skeletal muscle. Next, we examined whether increased fatty acid concentrations in the skeletal muscle of znt7-KO mice would result in an increased capacity for fatty acid utilization. First, we performed EM of the femoral skeletal muscle isolated from znt7-KO and WT mice. As shown in Fig. 5A, in the WT, the mitochondria (dark and ovoid structures) were localized at the level of the I band and centered around the z-line between the myofibrils (16Ogata T. Yamasaki Y. Ultra-high-resolution scanning electron microscopy of mitochondria and sarcoplasmic reticulum arrangement in human red, white, and intermediate muscle fibers.Anat. Rec. 1997; 248 (9185987): 214-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In contrast, in the znt7-KO muscle, the sarcoplasmic space of the myofibril was inflated with nonuniformly distributed mitochondria. In addition, the size of the mitochondria in the znt7-KO muscle was expanded, covering two or more z-lines along the myofibril (Fig. 5A). High magnification images revealed a high level of lipid accumulation between the mitochondria in the znt7-KO muscle (Fig. 5B). Nevertheless, we did not observe a noticeable internal structure change in the mitochondria of the znt7-KO muscle (Fig. 5B). In addition, mitochondrial DNA contents in the muscle cells between znt7-KO and the WT controls were not different (data not shown). Dysregulation of several factors, such as fatty acid transport, intracellular fatty acid binding, and/or fatty acid oxidation, could increase fatty acid concentrations in the znt7-KO muscle. Thus, we decided to investigate the mRNA expression of genes involved in the fatty acid uptake and oxidation in the skeletal muscle, including Cd36 (fatty acid translocase), Slc27a1 (long-chain fatty acid transport protein 1), Slc27a4, Fabp3 (fatty acid–binding protein 3), Acsl1 (long-chain fatty acid CoA ligase 1), Acacb (acetyl-CoA carboxylase 2), Cpt1b (carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1b), Acadl (long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase), and Hadhb (3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase, β subunit), in differentiated primary myoblasts isolated from skeletal muscles of znt7-KO and WT mice (4Huang L. Kirschke C.P. Lay Y.A. Levy L.B. Lamirande D.E. Zhang P.H. Znt7-null mice are more susceptible to diet-induced glucose intolerance and insulin resistance.J. Biol.

Although primary isolated skeletal muscle cells might not reflect skeletal muscle in vivo, we used these cells to achieve improved results for quantitative PCR, Western blot assay, fatty acid uptake, and ROS measurements. As shown in Fig. 6A, among the genes examined, the mRNA expression of Fabp3, a gene associated with intracellular fatty acid binding, was significantly higher (25-fold) in the znt7-KO primary myotubes than in the WT controls. Up-regulation of Fabp3 in znt7-KO myotubes was also confirmed at the protein level (Fig. 6B). Four genes that are implicated in fatty acid uptake, Cd36, Slc27a1, Slc27a4, and Acsl1, were moderately up-regulated (2.5–5-fold higher in the znt7-KO muscle than in the controls). We further confirmed that the up-regulation of expression of these fatty acid uptake genes in znt7-KO myotubes led to an increase in fatty acid uptake by ∼27% compared with the controls (Fig. 6C). Interestingly, the mRNA expression of Acacb, an enzyme that converts acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA, was also up-regulated in the znt7-KO primary myotubes. Malonyl-CoA is a potent inhibitor of mitochondrial fatty acid uptake through allosteric inhibition of Cpt1 enzymatic activity, a rate-limiting step in fatty acid uptake and oxidation by the mitochondria. Increased mRNA expression of Acacb suggests a negative impact of the znt7-KO on mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation in myotubes even though Acadl and Hadhb were up-regulated in the znt7-KO primary myotubes compared with the controls (Fig. 7, A and B). Taken together, our results suggest that the znt7-null mutation may increase fatty acid uptake and expand the Fabp3-bound fatty acid pool in the skeletal muscle. znt7-KO may also impair fatty acid oxidation in the skeletal muscle. As a result, lipids accumulate in the skeletal muscle of znt7-KO mice.Figure 7.Expression of key enzymes involved in the mitochondrial β-oxidation, bioactive lipid mediator production, and ROS accumulation in primary skeletal myotubes.

We fitted a series of multivariate logistic regression models to examine the association between each CSE component exposure and sexual health outcomes, adjusting for age and sex.There were significant associations between being exposed to each CSE components and the related sexual health outcomes. The strongest one was for identifying effective contraceptives among those exposed to the Sexual and Reproductive Health component (SRH) (OR 4.10; 95%CI[2.93,5.75]). Also, students exposed to the relationships component had 20% higher odds of affirming they could convince their partner to use condoms (OR 1.20; 95%CI[1.05,1.36]).This paper provides evidence of the potential beneficial effects of CSE on attitudes, knowledge, and behaviors regarding sexual and reproductive health among adolescents.

https://openalex.org/W2789536124,"Background Maternal morbidity and mortality is still a major public health issue in low- and middle-income countries such as Cambodia. Improving access to antenatal care (ANC) services for pregnant women has been widely recognized as one of the most effective means of reducing maternal mortality and morbidity. As such, this study examined the barriers for pregnant women living in rural, agricultural villages to accessing ANC based on data collected in the Ratanakiri province, one of the least developed provinces in Cambodia, using a combination of a community-based cross-sectional survey and a geographic information system (GIS). Methods A community-based cross-sectional survey was conducted among 377 mothers with children under the age of two living in 62 villages in the Ratanakiri province, Cambodia, in December 2015. Face-to-face interviews were conducted to ask mothers about their ANC service use, knowledge of ANC, barriers to accessing health facilities, and complications they experienced during the most recent pregnancy. At the same time, GIS data were also collected using a Global Positioning System (GPS) to accurately measure actual travel distance of pregnant women to access health facilities and to examine geographical and environmental barriers in greater detail. Results Only a third of the mothers met the recommendations made by the World Health Organization (WHO) of receiving ANC four times or more (achieved ANC4+), and a quarter of the mothers had never received ANC during their most recent pregnancy. Factors positively associated with achieving ANC4+ were mother’s secondary or higher education (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 5.50, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.74, 17.37), being aware that receiving ANC is recommended (AOR = 2.74, 95% CI: 1.25, 6.00), and knowledge about the recommended frequency for ANC (AOR = 2.26, 95% CI: 7.22). Actual travel distance was negatively associated with achieving ANC4+. Mothers who had to travel 10.0–14.9 km were 68% less likely (AOR = 0.32, 95% CI: 0.10, 0.99), and those who had to travel 15.0 km or longer were 79% less likely (AOR = 0.21, 95% CI: 0.07, 0.62) to have achieved ANC 4+, both compared to those who travelled 5.0 km or less. While most previous studies have used a straight-line to measure distance traveled, this study much more accurately measured the actual distance traveled by using a GIS. As a result, there was a statistically significant discrepancy between actual travel distance and straight-line distance. Conclusions This study revealed promoting factors and barriers for ANC use among pregnant women living in remote, agricultural villages in Cambodia. Furthermore, this study highlights the importance of measuring travel distances accurately to ensure that targeted interventions for ANC are not misguided by straight-line distances. The methodology used in this study can be applied widely to other developing countries, especially in remote areas with limited road networks where there may be a large discrepancy between actual and straight-line distances."

https://openalex.org/W2792295134,"Toxin–antitoxin (TA) loci in bacteria are small genetic modules that regulate various cellular activities, including cell growth and death. The two-gene module encoding a HEPN (higher eukaryotes and prokaryotes nucleotide-binding) domain and a cognate MNT (minimal nucleotidyltransferase) domain have been predicted to represent a novel type II TA system prevalent in archaea and bacteria. However, the neutralization mechanism and cellular targets of the TA family remain unclear.

Here, we report the crystal structure and solution conformation of the SO_3166–SO_3165 pair, representing the first complex structures in this TA family. The structures revealed that SO_3165 and SO_3166 form a tight heterooctamer (at a 2:6 ratio), an organization that is very rare in other TA systems. We also observed that SO_3166 dimerization enables the formation of a deep cleft at the HEPN-domain interface harboring a composite RX4–6H active site that functions as an RNA-cleaving RNase. SO_3165 bound SO_3166 mainly through its two α-helices (α2 and α4), functioning as molecular recognition elements. Moreover, their insertion into the SO_3166 cleft sterically blocked the RX4–6H site or narrowed the cleft to inhibit RNA substrate binding. Structure-based mutagenesis confirmed the important roles of these α-helices in SO_3166 binding and inhibition. Our structure–function analysis provides first insights into the neutralization mechanism of the HEPN–MNT TA family. Toxin–antitoxin (TA) loci in bacteria are small genetic modules that regulate various cellular activities, including cell growth and death. The two-gene module encoding a HEPN (higher eukaryotes and prokaryotes nucleotide-binding) domain and a cognate MNT (minimal nucleotidyltransferase) domain have been predicted to represent a novel type II TA system prevalent in archaea and bacteria.

Six different types of TA systems (types I–VI) have been characterized so far based on the interaction mode of the TA and the molecular nature of the antitoxin (3Page R. Peti W.

In the most well-characterized and abundant type II TA system, an antitoxin can bind directly to a cognate toxin to form a tight protein–protein complex for inactivating toxicity during normal growth. When the expression from TA loci is impaired by stresses, specific ATP-dependent proteases (such as Lon and ClpXP) will be activated to destroy the labile antitoxin by proteolytic cleavage (4Hayes F.

The subsequently released toxin is activated to regulate cell mortality by blocking DNA replication or translation, or by facilitating mRNA degradation. These key cellular processes are associated with many roles in cell physiology, such as biofilm formation and virulence in bacteria (1Gerdes K. Christensen S.K. Løbner-Olesen A.

The MNT (minimal nucleotidyltransferase) domains have been identified as the minimal units of DNA polymerase protein superfamily that are responsible for transferring nucleic acids to an acceptor hydroxyl group in prokaryotes and animal Sacsin proteins (9Aravind L. Koonin E.V. DNA polymerase β-like nucleotidyltransferase superfamily: identification of three new families, classification and evolutionary history.Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27 (10075991): 1609-161810.1093/nar/27.7.1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The two-gene modules encoding a MNT domain and an accompanying HEPN domain have been proposed to represent a novel, nonconventional type II TA system widely distributed in both archaea and bacteria (10Makarova K.S. Wolf Y.I. Koonin E.V. Comprehensive comparative-genomic analysis of type 2 toxin-antitoxin systems and related mobile stress response systems in prokaryotes.Biol. Direct. 2009; 4 (19493340): 1910.1186/1745-6150-4-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The MNT- and an accompanying HEPN-containing protein have been predicted as the toxin and the cognate antitoxin, respectively. However, a genome-wide screen for toxins has identified the HEPN domain function as the toxin in the HEPN–MNT module belonging to a TA system (11Kimelman A. Levy A. Sberro H. Kidron S. Leavitt A. Amitai G. Yoder-Himes D.R. Wurtzel O. Zhu Y. Rubin E.M. Sorek R. A vast collection of microbial genes that are toxic to bacteria.Genome Res. 2012; 22 (22300632): 802-80910.1101/gr.133850.111Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). A subsequent bioinformatics analysis further predicted that the HEPN-domain functions as toxins that are essential components of numerous TA and abortive infection systems in prokaryotes, and are also tightly associated with many restriction–modification (R–M) and CRISPR–Cas systems (12Anantharaman V. Makarova K.S. Burroughs A.M. Koonin E.V. Aravind L. Comprehensive analysis of the HEPN superfamily: identification of novel roles in intra-genomic conflicts, defense, pathogenesis and RNA processing.Biol. Direct. 2013; 8 (25908943, 23768067): 15Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Moreover, most HEPN domains contain a conserved RX4–6H motif (where X is any amino acid and the residue immediately after the conserved R is typically a polar amino acid, and 4–6 indicates the number of amino acids between R and H). As a conserved feature of the HEPN domain, this motif may function as a novel RNase active site, but it is usually lost when fused with an MNT domain. Until now, the neutralization mechanism and cellular targets of HEPN–MNT TA family members remain unknown. Recently, we experimentally characterized SO_3166 and SO_3165 from Shewanella oneidensis as a novel type II TA pair with a critical role in regulating cell motility and conferring plasmid stability (13Yao J. Guo Y. Zeng Z. Liu X. Shi F. Wang X. Identification and characterization of a HEPN-MNT family type II toxin-antitoxin in Shewanella oneidensis.Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2015; 8 (26112399): 961-97310.1111/1751-7915.12294Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). SO_3166 is composed of a single HEPN domain and a conserved RX4–6H catalytic motif. It can function as a toxin with strong inhibition on cell growth in S. oneidensis and Escherichia coli. The toxicity can be neutralized by its cognate antitoxin SO_3165 with a MNT domain, which binds to the promoter of the TA operon and repressed its activity (13Yao J. Guo Y. Zeng Z. Liu X. Shi F. Wang X. Identification and characterization of a HEPN-MNT family type II toxin-antitoxin in Shewanella oneidensis.Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2015; 8 (26112399): 961-97310.1111/1751-7915.12294Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, the inhibition mechanism of SO_3166 toxicity by SO_3165 remains unclear. To this end, we performed structure–function studies on the SO_3166–SO_3165 system and demonstrate how the HEPN toxin (SO_3166) is recognized and inhibited by the MNT antitoxin (SO_3165). The unique structure and the following mutagenesis study revealed one SO_3165 can recognize and inhibit the toxicity of three SO_3166 by sterically blocking its RX4–6H catalytic domain. These findings may provide novel insights into the neutralization mechanism of HEPN–MNT TA family members, and are useful to further understand the function of HEPNs and MNTs in prokaryotes. To evaluate whether toxin SO_3166 can function as a RNase similar to many type II toxins, its RNA cleavage activity against different types of RNAs (mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA) was studied. The abundant ompA mRNA in E. coli was synthesized and used for the in vitro RNA cleavage assay. The ompA mRNA (306 nt, 0.5 μg) substrate can be cleaved into smaller fragments by purified SO_3166 (Fig. S1) after 20 min (∼16.6 μm, Fig. 1A). However, its cleavage capacity is completely inhibited by SO_3165 in this complex, consistent with the previous observation that SO_3166 toxicity could be neutralized by SO_3165 (13Yao J. Guo Y. Zeng Z. Liu X. Shi F. Wang X. Identification and characterization of a HEPN-MNT family type II toxin-antitoxin in Shewanella oneidensis.Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2015; 8 (26112399): 961-97310.1111/1751-7915.12294Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Meanwhile, no RNA cleavage fragments were detected against E. coli total tRNAs (Fig. 1B), or S. oneidensis rRNA (pHGE-SO_3166 overexpressing in S. oneidensis, Fig. 1C). DNA cleavage activities of SO_3166 against different types of DNAs (circular dsDNA, linear dsDNA, and circular ssDNA) were also tested, but no activity was detected in the in vitro DNA cleavage assay (Fig. S2). These in vitro and in vivo results suggest that SO_3166 can function as a RNase by cleaving mRNA rather than tRNA or rRNA. The crystal structure of the SO_3166–SO_3165 complex was solved by the single-wavelength anomalous dispersion method from synchrotron data using selenomethionine (Se-Met)-labeled protein in space group P21212 and was refined to a final R/Rfree factor of 0.26/0.29 at 3.0-Å resolution (Table 1). There are four molecules composed of one SO_3165 binding three SO_3166 in an asymmetric unit (ASU) to form an heterotetramer (Fig. 2A), with overall dimensions of ∼57 × 223 × 54 Å. The residues Met-1–Asn-5 and Asn-128–Ser-139 in SO_3165 (139 residues at full-length), were not observed in the electron density map and not included in the current model, whereas all the residues in the three SO_3166 molecules (133 residues at full-length) could be built into the model (except for the absence of selenomethionine-substituted-1 (Se-Met-1) in SO_3166C). The three SO_3166 molecules are highly similar with a root mean square deviation (r.m.s. deviation) of 0.70–0.72 Å for 131 aligned Cα atoms. The notable differences among them are the variable conformations of the α1–α2 and α4–α5 loops (harboring part of the catalytic RX4–6H motif, discussed below) (Fig. S3). Meanwhile, a tight heterooctamer can be generated by crystal packing with symmetry-related molecules with the organization (SO_3166)2–SO_3165-(SO_3166)2–SO_3165-(SO_3166)2 (Fig. 2B).Table 1Data collection and refinement statisticsData collectionWavelength (Å)0.9788Space groupP21212Unit-cell parametersa = 56.6 Å, b = 224.4 Å, c = 53.3 Å, α = β = γ = 90°Resolution (Å)3.00 (3.08–3.00)aThe values in parentheses indicate the highest resolution shell.Number of unique reflections26,218 (1,904)Completeness (%)99.9 (100)Redundancy7.6 (7.8)Mean I/σ(I)13.93 (3.51)Molecules in asymmetric unit4Rmerge (%)6.5 (64.8)CC1/299.9 (94.9)Structure refinementReflections used in refinement14,273Resolution range (Å)48.15–3.00Rwork/Rfree (%)26.4/29.2Macromolecules4,145Protein residues517Waters0Average B factor ( Å2)Main chain72.95Side chain77.56Clash score8.06Ramachandran plot (%)Most favored95.6Allowed3.8Disallowed0.6R.m.s. deviationsBond lengths (Å)0.003Bond angles (°)0.55a The values in parentheses indicate the highest resolution shell. Open table in a new tab The SO_3166–SO_3165 complex migrated on size exclusion chromatography with a molecular mass of ∼140 kDa compared with its calculated heterotetramer molecular mass of ∼60 kDa (Figs. 2C and Fig. S5). The oligomeric state of the complex in solution was further studied by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). General structural parameters calculated from the SAXS profile using Guinier approximation and indirect Fourier transformation (program GNOM) are shown in Table S3. Experimental SAXS curves after standard preliminary processing are presented in Fig. 2D (curve 1). Independent confirmation of the results above is the ab initio reconstruction of the complex shape in solution by the programs DAMMIN (χ2 = 1.272) and GASBOR (χ2 = 1.446) (Table S3). The results show that the experimental SAXS curves are in agreement with the heterooctamer theoretical curve (curves 2 and 3), and the available heterooctamer crystal structure can be fit into the respective SAXS-derived low resolution envelopes. Moreover, comparison of the theoretical scattering patterns from the heterotetramer crystal structure in the ASU with the experimental SAXS profile showed that the model curve differs considerably, whereas the crystallographic heterooctamer yields good fit to it (χ = 2.6) (Fig. S4). The results suggest the active form of the complex is a heterooctamer that is composed of six SO_3166 molecules binding two SO_3165 molecules in solution. Such antitoxin to toxin oligomerization was mediated entirely by toxin molecules, and the unique organization (toxin–antitoxin = 6:2) has not been previously reported in a TA system. Moreover, further analysis of the recombinant complex at different concentrations (the same as those used in the SAXS experiment) by size exclusion chromatography showed they have almost identical retention time (Fig. S5). Therefore, we can conclude that the SO_3166–SO_3165 complex always exists as a heterooctamer and this form is not concentration dependent in vitro. Considering that the SO_3166–SO_3165 concentration used in the in vitro studies (at the micromolar level) is considerably higher than that in cells, additional studies may be required to confirm the unusual stoichiometry of the complex in vivo. SO_3166 is composed of a five-helix bundle, as found in HEPN superfamily members that all adopt the all α-helical-fold (12Anantharaman V. Makarova K.S. Burroughs A.M. Koonin E.V. Aravind L. Comprehensive analysis of the HEPN superfamily: identification of novel roles in intra-genomic conflicts, defense, pathogenesis and RNA processing.Biol. Direct. 2013; 8 (25908943, 23768067): 15Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Notably, the fused RX4–6H motif (the residues Arg-97–His-102) is located at the end of the α4 helix and in the beginning of the α4–α5 loop (Fig. 3, A and B). The conserved fused RX4–6H motif has been suggested as the primary determinant of a novel RNase active site in the HEPN superfamily (13Yao J. Guo Y. Zeng Z. Liu X. Shi F. Wang X. Identification and characterization of a HEPN-MNT family type II toxin-antitoxin in Shewanella oneidensis.Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2015; 8 (26112399): 961-97310.1111/1751-7915.12294Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This motif is exposed to the solvent (before the antitoxin binding) and may be used to accommodate substrate RNA to trigger the catalysis of RNA cleavage. Moreover, the conformation of the region containing this motif is flexible (Fig. S3), which may be required for substrate-binding or effective catalysis. The DALI search (http://ekhidna.biocenter.helsinki.fi/dali_server) 5Please note that the JBC is not responsible for the long-term archiving and maintenance of this site or any other third party hosted site. revealed that SO_3166 has remarkable similarities with several uncharacterized proteins with a single HEPN-fold composed of five helices, as well as other proteins containing HEPN domains, such as the aminoglycoside NTs. One of the closest structural homologs is HI0074 (PDB ID 1JOG), with a typical HEPN-fold, from Haemophilus influenza, with a DALI Z-score of 12.0 and a r.m.s. deviation of 2.8 Å for 119 Cα atoms (Fig. 3E). Similarly, HI0074 with a single HEPN-domain is also a triangular homodimer harboring an RX4–6H motif (PDB ID 1JOG) (Fig. S6). However, the conformations of the regions containing the RX4–6H motif are remarkably different in the HI0074 and SO_3166 structures (especially the catalytic histidine), indicating they have different substrate-binding specificities (Fig. 3E). Moreover, the large positively charged cavity at the dimer interface formed by two HEPN domains has also been observed in Sacsin (PDB ID 3O10) and kanamycin nucleotidyltransferase (KNTase, PDB ID 1KNY) for the binding of GTP and other nucleotides (14Kozlov G. Denisov A.Y. Girard M. Dicaire M.J. Hamlin J. McPherson P.S. Brais B. Gehring K.

All these structures suggest that dimerization of the HEPN-domain is conserved in its evolution. Two SO_3166 protomers (SO_3166A–SO_3166B) in the ASU assemble as a tight homodimer and the dimerization occurs mainly through the interactions of the α2 helix in both monomers (Fig. 3B). These extensive direct interactions are composed of dozens of hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) and salt bridges between the two subunits (Fig. S6). Another SO_3166 dimer (SO_3166C–SO_3166C′) can be generated by crystallographic symmetry (Fig. 2B). Structural comparisons of these two dimers showed that their overall conformations are highly similar, with a r.m.s. deviation of 1.3 Å for 252 Cα atoms (Fig. S7, A and B). Moreover, they have similar buried dimer surface areas at the dimer interface (with the ration of buried surface area/total surface area of 861 Å2/7,628 Å2 and 1,062 Å2/7,701 Å2, respectively), as well as very similar interacting residues (Fig. S7, C and D). Therefore, the SO_3166A–SO_3166B dimer (also SO_3166B and SO_3165A in the ASU) was used for detailed analysis below, unless otherwise stated. The contacting residues at the dimer interface are highly conserved across the HEPN toxin family (Fig. 3A), supporting the importance of the dimerization of SO_3166 from an evolutionary point of view. Dimerization of SO_3166 enables the formation of a deep cleft mainly composed of the α2, α4, and α3 helices between the two subunits (Fig. 3, B and C). The catalytic RX4–6H domain is located in the base of the cleft, which is formed by the interlocking of the α4 helix and the α4–α5 loop of the two HEPN domain protomers. The cleft is ∼32 Å (long) × 18 Å (deep) × 13 Å (wide at its narrowest point) and the constituent residues are conserved. The width of the cleft may allow the favorable binding of a single-stranded RNA molecule (ssRNA, ∼11 Å width), whereas sterically excluding double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) (Fig. S8), which are consistent with the RNA/DNA cleavage experiment results above (Fig. 1 and Fig. S2). Moreover, inspection of the surface charge distribution of the SO_3166 dimer revealed there are notable positively charged protuberances with large continuous areas in and around the cleft (Fig. 3C). These patches with continuously positive surfaces may function as the wrapping path for the substrate binding. Therefore, the cleft in the SO_3166 dimer may provide a platform for the catalytic process as an active center. Our recent site-directed mutagenesis of SO_3166 revealed that three residues (Arg-97, Asn-98, and His-102) belonging to the RX4–6H motif, as well as six additional residues (Cys-15, His-56, Arg-70, Val-94, Leu-107, and His-118), are critical for the toxicity of SO_3166 (13Yao J. Guo Y. Zeng Z. Liu X. Shi F. Wang X. Identification and characterization of a HEPN-MNT family type II toxin-antitoxin in Shewanella oneidensis.Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2015; 8 (26112399): 961-97310.1111/1751-7915.12294Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Mapping of these residues on SO_3166 showed they are located in the cleft (except Cys-15 and His-118) (Fig. 3D), indicating these residues are closely associated with SO_3166 RNase activity. SO_3165 adopts a mixed α/β-fold, composed of a four-stranded twisted β-sheet (β1–β4) in the middle flanked by four helices (α1–α4) at the sides (Figs. 2A and 4A). The overall structure is well-ordered in the complex. Sucharge analysis of SO_3165 showed there is a positively charged protuberance distributed in helix α1 and around (Fig. 4B). Meanwhile, helices α2 and α4 are covered with dominantly negative charges (Fig. 4B), which mediated SO_3166 binding (discussed below). The solution behavior of purified apo SO_3165 using size exclusion chromatography indicated that the corresponding molecular mass (∼34 kDa) is larger than that of a monomer (∼15.5 kDa) (Fig. 2C and Fig. S5), suggesting a dimer may be formed in the absence of toxin SO_3166. Considering that SO_3165 exists as a monomer in the complex structure, it may be depolymerized to accommodate toxin binding in the inhibition process. A DALI search for globally similar proteins revealed that SO_3165 has remarkable similarities with several nucleotidyl transferases (NTs) from archaea and bacteria, including MNTs with a single MNT domain and aminoglycoside NTs with a fused MNT–HEPN domain. The closest structural homolog is HI0073 (PDB ID 1NO5) with a typical MNT-fold from H. influenza, with a DALI Z-score of 8.1 and a r.m.s. deviation of 2.4 Å for 100 Cα atoms (Fig. 4C). One important difference is the extra α4 helix in SO_3165, which play an important role in SO_3166 binding and inhibition (discussed below). The other difference is the long β1–β2 loop (interrupted by a small helix) in HI0073, which is absent in SO_3165. Meanwhile, no zinc ions were observed in the SO_3165 structure as found in HI0073 (16Lehmann C. Pullalarevu S. Krajewski W. Willis M.A. Galkin A. Howard A. Herzberg O. Structure of HI0073 from Haemophilus influenzae, the nucleotide-binding domain of a two-protein nucleotidyl transferase.Proteins. 2005; 60 (16028221): 807-81110.1002/prot.20586Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The zinc-binding region and surroundings (Asp-46, Asp-48, and Asp-79) is suggested to be of functional importance and corresponds to the magnesium sites of the nucleotide-binding domains in the previously known structures of NTs (16Lehmann C. Pullalarevu S. Krajewski W. Willis M.A. Galkin A. Howard A. Herzberg O. Structure of HI0073 from Haemophilus influenzae, the nucleotide-binding domain of a two-protein nucleotidyl transferase.Proteins. 2005; 60 (16028221): 807-81110.1002/prot.20586Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The structural variations in MNT domains probably reflect their function in the inhibition of distinct toxins. Structural analysis showed that SO_3165 has direct interactions with three SO_3166 molecules simultaneously. The buried surface areas of the three subunits (labeled using the subscripts A–C) at the interface are 565, 786, and 484 Å2, which is up to 7.1, 9.9, and 6.1% of the total surface area (7,971 Å2), respectively. These extensive contacts include 19 H-bonds and salt bridges (Fig. 5), as well as ∼100 van der Waals (VDW) contacts (not shown). Notably, the two helices (α2 and α4) from SO_3165 are oriented toward the RX4–6H domains of the three SO_3166 molecules. These helices contribute to the majority of the hydrogen-bonding network and function as the main molecular recognition elements, thereby stabilizing the heterooctamer. The long α4 helix binds to the two subunits SO_3166A and SO_3166B simultaneously, and insert into the deep cleft of the SO_3166 dimer. The corresponding interacting elements in SO_3166 include the α2 helix (Glu-48, Asp-52, Asn-55, His-56, and Arg-59) in SO_3166A, as well as the α2 helix (Asn-55 and Arg-59), the α2–α3 loop (Pro-66, Gln-67, and Ser-69), and the α4 helix (Arg-97) in SO3166B, through extensive direct interactions (Fig. 5, A and B). The α2 helix of SO_3165 also falls close to the RX4–6H domain in one subunit of the symmetry-related SO_3166 dimer. The corresponding interacting elements in SO_3166 include the α4 helix (Lys-91, Lys-92, and Asn-98), the α2–α3 loop (Arg-70) and the α4–α5 loop (Leu-107) through extensive contacts (Fig. 5C). Moreover, the surfaces of the two helices are predominantly distributed with negative charges (Fig. 4B), which complements the positively charged regions in and around the cleft (Fig. 3C). Further structural analyses showed Rx4–6H motif residues Arg-97, Asn-98, and His-102, as well as Arg-70 and Val-94, are located in the bottom of the cleft and extend to a continuous large area (Fig. 6, A–D). More importantly, these residues, (such as Arg-70 and Arg-97) directly interacting with helices α2 and α4 of SO_3165, are key residues for SO_3166 toxicity. For example, the side chain (NH1 and NH2) groups of Arg-97 of SO_3166B can form a salt bridge with the side chain carboxyl group (OE2) of Glu-117 (3.0 Å). The side chain (NH2) of Arg-70 in SO_3166C can form two salt bridges with the side chain (OD1 and OD2) of Glu-117 (3.7 and 3.2 Å, respectively). Consequently, the α4 helix can insert into the cleft formed by the SO_3166 dimer and may mask the RX4–6H catalytic domain and sterically block access of the substrate (Fig. 6, A and C). On the other side, the α2 helix (as well as the α2–α3 loop) from two SO_3165 molecules can also narrow the cleft formed by the other SO_3166 dimer formed by two symmetry-related molecules (Fig. 6, B and D). This helix may also affect the substrate binding access to the RX4–6H motif. Therefore, under the active octameric status, the complete neutralization of SO_3166 toxicities may require the cooperation of two SO_3165 molecules by their two helices simultaneously. Structure-based truncations of the helices α2 and α4 of SO_3165 were performed to confirm their roles in SO_3166 toxicity inhibition. The truncations including Δα4 (Gln-98–His-11"

We used a force platform and affixed electrogoniometers to measure peak vertical force (PVF), vertical impulse (VI), stance time (ST), and angular range of motion (AROM), from 12 lame client-owned English bulldogs with post-CCLR stifle joint abnormalities. The 12 affected subjects were treated with 4 intra-articular injections of PRP, at 30-day intervals. Ten untreated, sound English bulldogs were used as a reference group. Clinical outcomes were evaluated using a linear mixed effects model. Mean values of PVF, VI, ST, and AROM were improved within the first 3 months post-treatment in the CCLR group, with mean measured changes increasing to maximum 4.56% body weight gain, 1.5% body weight/second, 0.07 seconds, and 6.18 degrees, respectively. The effects declined progressively after the treatment interval, ending at nearly initial levels after 6 months. This study demonstrates that dogs with CCLR treated with intra-articular PRP had improved PVF, VI, ST, and AROM over time; the duration of effect was waning by the end of the post-treatment period."
https://openalex.org/W2791540428,"The sequestosome 1 gene encodes the p62 protein and is the major genetic risk factor associated with Paget's disease of bone. In 2004, p62 was reported to up-regulate osteoclast differentiation by activating the transcription factors Nfatc1 and NF-κB. Here, we characterized the osteoclastogenic potential of murine p62-/--derived cells compared with WT cells. Our data confirmed previous findings indicating that p62 is induced during murine osteoclast differentiation. Surprisingly, an indispensable role for p62 in in vitro osteoclast differentiation was not reproducible because p62-deficient osteoclasts exhibited robust activation of Nfatc1, NF-κB, and osteoclast marker enzymes. Thus, we concluded that in vitro osteoclast differentiation is not negatively influenced by knocking out p62. On the contrary, our results revealed that p62 deficiency accelerates osteoclastogenesis. Differentiation potential, multinucleation status, and soluble receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (sRANKL) sensitivity were significantly elevated in p62-deficient, murine bone marrow-derived stem cells. Moreover, femur ultrastructures visualized by micro-computed tomography revealed pronounced accumulation of adipocytes and trabecular bone material in distal femora of obese p62-/- mice. Increased tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase activity, along with increased trabecular bone and accumulation of adipocytes, was confirmed in both paraffin-embedded decalcified and methyl methacrylate-embedded nondecalcified bones from p62-/- mice. Of note, Paget's disease-like osteolytic lesions and increased levels of the bone turnover markers CTX-I and PINP were also observed in the p62-/- mice. Our results indicate that p62 predominantly suppresses murine in vitro osteoclast differentiation and highlight previously undetected Paget's disease-like phenotypes in p62-/- mice in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2789956993,"Up to 20% of Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC) patients are estimated to have features that overlap with Autoimmune Hepatitis (AIH). Patients with PBC-AIH overlap syndrome (PBC-AIH OS) have been reported to exhibit suboptimal responses to ursodeoxycholic acid therapy, and are more likely to progress to cirrhosis. Anti-double stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) and anti-p53 have been previously suggested to be potential autoantibodies for identifying patients with PBC-AIH OS. In our well defined PBC patient cohorts, a comprehensive assessment of various classical and novel autoantibodies was evaluated for their utility in identifying PBC-AIH OS patients.PBC-AIH OS was classified according to the Paris criteria and PBC as per the European Association for the Study of the Liver guidelines. Biobanked serum samples from 197 patients at the University of Calgary Liver Unit and the University of Alberta were analyzed for classical and novel autoantibodies. Anti-dsDNA was measured by the Crithidia luciliae immunofluorescence (CLIFT) assay (1:20 dilution) and chemiluminescence (CIA: QUANTA Flash®, Inova Diagnostics, San Diego). Anti-p53, anti-Ro52/TRIM21, anti-YB 1, anti-GW182, anti-Ge-1, and anti-Ago 2 were measured by either an addressable laser bead immunoassay (ALBIA) or line immunoassay (LIA). Autoantibodies against MIT3, gp210, sp100, LKM1, SLA, and the novel autoantibodies Hexokinase-1 (HK-1), and Kelch like protein 12 (KLHL-12) were measured using QUANTA Lite® ELISA assays. We applied non-parametric methods to compare the biomarkers frequencies between study groups. We used multivariate adjusted models and AUROC to compare the diagnostic accuracy of the different autoantibodies alone or in combination with serum biochemistry.16 out of 197 PBC patients (8.1%) were classified as PBC-AIH OS. Compared to PBC patients, PBC-AIH OS patients were similar in age (median: 59 vs. 63, P = 0.21) and female predominance (94% vs. 89%, P = 1.00). Anti-dsDNA-by CLIFT (37.5% in PBC-AIH OS vs 9.9% in PBC alone, P <0.01) was the only autoantibody associated with PBC-AIH OS; a finding consistent with previous reports. Significant elevation in serum ALT (62 IU/L in PBC-AIH OS vs 37 IU/L in PBC alone, P < 0.01), and serum IgG (17.6 g/L in OS vs 12.1 g/L in PBC alone, P <0.01) were observed in patients with PBC-AIH OS receiving medical/immunosuppressive therapy. In a multivariate model, positive anti-dsDNA by CLIFT, ALT and IgG were significant predictors of PBC-AIH OS with an area under the receiver operator curve (AUROC) value of 0.84.Consistent with previous findings, the presence of anti-dsDNA by CLIFT is associated with PBC-AIH OS. Contrary to previous reports, anti-p53 was not associated with PBC-AIH OS. Our comprehensive evaluation of various classical and novel autoantibody biomarkers including Ro52/TRIM21, anti-p53, anti-KLHL-12 and anti-HK-1 were not significantly associated with PBC-AIH OS. Our findings highlight the ongoing need for the research and development of new autoantibody biomarkers to aid in the diagnosis of PBC-AIH OS."
https://openalex.org/W2795783555,"The metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is a lethal form of prostate cancer, in which the expression of androgen receptor (AR) is highly heterogeneous. Indeed, lower AR expression and attenuated AR signature activity is shown in CRPC tissues, especially in the subset of neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) and prostate cancer stem-like cells (PCSCs). However, the significance of AR downregulation in androgen insensitivity and de-differentiation of tumor cells in CRPC is poorly understood and much neglected. Our previous study shows that the orphan nuclear receptor TLX (NR2E1), which is upregulated in prostate cancer, plays an oncogenic role in prostate carcinogenesis by suppressing oncogene-induced senescence. In the present study, we further established that TLX exhibited an increased expression in metastatic CRPC. Further analyses showed that overexpression of TLX could confer resistance to androgen deprivation and anti-androgen in androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo, whereas knockdown of endogenous TLX could potentiate the sensitivity to androgen deprivation and anti-androgen in prostate cancer cells. Our study revealed that the TLX-induced resistance to androgen deprivation and anti-androgen was mediated through its direct suppression of AR gene transcription and signaling in both androgen-stimulated and -unstimulated prostate cancer cells. We also characterized that TLX could bind directly to AR promoter and repress AR transcription by recruitment of histone modifiers, including HDAC1, HDAC3, and LSD1. Together, our present study shows, for the first time, that TLX can contribute to androgen insensitivity in CRPC via repression of AR gene transcription and signaling, and also implicates that targeting the druggable TLX may have a potential therapeutic significance in CRPC management, particularly in NEPC and PCSCs."
https://openalex.org/W2615810691,"Compensatory growth (CG) is utilised worldwide in beef production systems as a management approach to reduce feed costs. However the underlying biology regulating the expression of CG remains to be fully elucidated. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of dietary restriction and subsequent re-alimentation induced CG on the global gene expression profile of ruminal epithelial papillae. Holstein Friesian bulls (n = 60) were assigned to one of two groups: restricted feed allowance (RES; n = 30) for 125 days (Period 1) followed by ad libitum access to feed for 55 days (Period 2) or (ii) ad libitum access to feed throughout (ADLIB; n = 30). At the end of each period, 15 animals from each treatment were slaughtered and rumen papillae harvested. mRNA was isolated from all papillae samples collected. cDNA libraries were then prepared and sequenced. Resultant reads were subsequently analysed bioinformatically and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) are defined as having a Benjamini-Hochberg P value of <0.05. During re-alimentation in Period 2, RES animals displayed CG, growing at 1.8 times the rate of their ADLIB contemporary animals in Period 2 (P < 0.001). At the end of Period 1, 64 DEGs were identified between RES and ADLIB, with only one DEG identified at the end of Period 2. When analysed within RES treatment (RES, Period 2 v Period 1), 411 DEGs were evident. Genes identified as differentially expressed in response to both dietary restriction and subsequent CG included those involved in processes such as cellular interactions and transport, protein folding and gene expression, as well as immune response. This study provides an insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the expression of CG in rumen papillae of cattle; however the results suggest that the role of the ruminal epithelium in supporting overall animal CG may have declined by day 55 of re-alimentation."
https://openalex.org/W2792911047,"Members of the Aedes genus of mosquitoes are widely recognized as vectors of viral diseases. Ae.albopictus is its most invasive species, and are known to carry viruses such as Dengue, Chikugunya and Zika. Its emerging importance puts Ae.albopictus on the forefront of genetic interaction and evolution studies. However, a panel of suitable reference genes specific for this insect is as of now undescribed. Nine reference genes, namely ACT, eEF1-γ, eIF2α, PP2A, RPL32, RPS17, PGK1, ILK and STK were evaluated. Expression patterns of the candidate reference genes were observed in a total of seventeen sample types, separated by stage of development and age. Gene stability was inferred from obtained quantification data through three widely cited evaluation algorithms i.e. BestKeeper, geNorm, and NormFinder. No single gene showed a satisfactory degree of stability throughout all developmental stages. Therefore, we propose combinations of PGK and ILK for early embryos; RPL32 and RPS17 for late embryos, all four larval instars, and pupae samples; eEF1-γ with STK for adult males; eEF1-γ with RPS17 for non-blood fed females; and eEF1-γ with eIF2α for both blood-fed females and cell culture. The results from this study should be able to provide a more informed selection of normalizing genes during qPCR in Ae.albopictus."
https://openalex.org/W2793055738,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) causes progressive disability in 1 of every 5,000 boys due to the lack of functional dystrophin protein. Despite much advancement in knowledge about DMD disease presentation and progression—attributable in part to studies using mouse and canine models of the disease–current DMD treatments are not equally effective in all patients. There remains, therefore, a need for translational animal models in which novel treatment targets can be identified and evaluated. Golden Retriever muscular dystrophy (GRMD) is a phenotypically and genetically homologous animal model of DMD. As with DMD, speed of disease progression in GRMD varies substantially. However, unlike DMD, all GRMD dogs possess the same causal mutation; therefore genetic modifiers of phenotypic variation are relatively easier to identify. Furthermore, the GRMD dogs used in this study reside within the same colony, reducing the confounding effects of environment on phenotypic variation. To detect modifiers of disease progression, we developed gene expression profiles using RNA sequencing for 9 dogs: 6 GRMD dogs (3 with faster-progressing and 3 with slower-progressing disease, based on quantitative, objective biomarkers) and 3 control dogs from the same colony. All dogs were evaluated at 2 time points: early disease onset (3 months of age) and the point at which GRMD stabilizes (6 months of age) using quantitative, objective biomarkers identified as robust against the effects of relatedness/inbreeding. Across all comparisons, the most differentially expressed genes fell into 3 categories: myogenesis/muscle regeneration, metabolism, and inflammation. Our findings are largely in concordance with DMD and mouse model studies, reinforcing the utility of GRMD as a translational model. Novel findings include the strong up-regulation of chitinase 3-like 1 (CHI3L1) in faster-progressing GRMD dogs, suggesting previously unexplored mechanisms underlie progression speed in GRMD and DMD. In summary, our findings support the utility of RNA sequencing for evaluating potential biomarkers of GRMD progression speed, and are valuable for identifying new avenues of exploration in DMD research."
https://openalex.org/W2791442363,"Mobility impairment in older persons is associated with brain white matter hyperintensities (WMH), a common finding in magnetic resonance images and one established imaging biomarker of small vessel disease. The contribution of possible microstructural abnormalities within normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) to mobility, however, remains unclear. We used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measures, i.e. fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), radial diffusivity (RD), to assess microstructural changes within supratentorial NAWM and WMH sub-compartments, and to investigate their association with changes in mobility performance, i.e. Tinetti assessment and the 2.5-meters walk time test. We analyzed baseline (N = 86, age ≥75 years) and 4-year (N = 41) follow-up data. Results from cross-sectional analysis on baseline data showed significant correlation between WMH volume and NAWM-FA (r = -0.33, p = 0.002), NAWM-AD (r = 0.32, p = 0.003) and NAWM-RD (r = 0.39, p = 0.0002). Our longitudinal analysis showed that after 4-years, FA and AD decreased and RD increased within NAWM. In regional tract-based analysis decrease in NAWM-FA and increase in NAWM-RD within the genu of the corpus callosum correlated with slower walk time independent of age, gender and WMH burden. In conclusion, global DTI indices of microstructural integrity indicate that significant changes occur in the supratentorial NAWM over four years. The observed changes likely reflect white matter deterioration resulting from aging as well as accrual of cerebrovascular injury associated with small vessel disease. The observed association between mobility scores and regional measures of NAWM microstructural integrity within the corpus callosum suggests that subtle changes within this structure may contribute to mobility impairment."
https://openalex.org/W2793692499,"The intelligent water drop algorithm is a swarm-based metaheuristic algorithm, inspired by the characteristics of water drops in the river and the environmental changes resulting from the action of the flowing river. Since its appearance as an alternative stochastic optimization method, the algorithm has found applications in solving a wide range of combinatorial and functional optimization problems. This paper presents an improved intelligent water drop algorithm for solving multi-depot vehicle routing problems. A simulated annealing algorithm was introduced into the proposed algorithm as a local search metaheuristic to prevent the intelligent water drop algorithm from getting trapped into local minima and also improve its solution quality. In addition, some of the potential problematic issues associated with using simulated annealing that include high computational runtime and exponential calculation of the probability of acceptance criteria, are investigated. The exponential calculation of the probability of acceptance criteria for the simulated annealing based techniques is computationally expensive. Therefore, in order to maximize the performance of the intelligent water drop algorithm using simulated annealing, a better way of calculating the probability of acceptance criteria is considered. The performance of the proposed hybrid algorithm is evaluated by using 33 standard test problems, with the results obtained compared with the solutions offered by four well-known techniques from the subject literature. Experimental results and statistical tests show that the new method possesses outstanding performance in terms of solution quality and runtime consumed. In addition, the proposed algorithm is suitable for solving large-scale problems."

The objective of this study was to evaluate the contribution of jejunal epithelial to CG in cattle through transcriptional profiling following a period of dietary restriction as well as subsequent re-alimentation induced CG. Sixty Holstein Friesian bulls were separated into two groups; RES and ADLIB, with 30 animals in each. RES animals were offered a restricted diet for 125 days (Period 1) followed by ad libitum feeding for 55 days (Period 2). ADLIB animals had ad libitum access to feed across both periods 1 and 2. At the end of each period, 15 animals from each treatment group were slaughtered, jejunal epithelium collected and RNAseq analysis performed. Animals that were previously diet restricted underwent CG, gaining 1.8 times the rate of their non-restricted counterparts. Twenty-four genes were differentially expressed in RES compared to ADLIB animals at the end of Period 1, with only one gene, GSTA1, differentially expressed between the two groups at the end of Period 2. When analysed within treatment (RES, Period 2 v Period 1), 31 genes were differentially expressed between diet restricted and animals undergoing CG. Dietary restriction and subsequent re-alimentation were associated with altered expression of genes involved in digestion and metabolism as well as those involved in cellular division and growth. Compensatory growth was also associated with greater expression of genes involved in cellular protection and detoxification in jejunal epithelium. This study highlights some of the molecular mechanisms regulating the response to dietary restriction and subsequent re-alimentation induced CG in cattle; however the gene expression results suggest that most of the CG in jejunal epithelium had occurred by day 55 of re-alimentation."
https://openalex.org/W2789631796,"The existing protein complex detection methods can be broadly divided into two categories: unsupervised and supervised learning methods. Most of the unsupervised learning methods assume that protein complexes are in dense regions of protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks even though many true complexes are not dense subgraphs. Supervised learning methods utilize the informative properties of known complexes; they often extract features from existing complexes and then use the features to train a classification model. The trained model is used to guide the search process for new complexes. However, insufficient extracted features, noise in the PPI data and the incompleteness of complex data make the classification model imprecise. Consequently, the classification model is not sufficient for guiding the detection of complexes. Therefore, we propose a new robust score function that combines the classification model with local structural information. Based on the score function, we provide a search method that works both forwards and backwards. The results from experiments on six benchmark PPI datasets and three protein complex datasets show that our approach can achieve better performance compared with the state-of-the-art supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised methods for protein complex detection, occasionally significantly outperforming such methods."
https://openalex.org/W2790618209,"The signaling scaffold protein GIT1 is expressed widely throughout the brain, but its function in vivo remains elusive. Mice lacking GIT1 have been proposed as a model for attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, due to alterations in basal locomotor activity as well as paradoxical locomotor suppression by the psychostimulant amphetamine. Since we had previously shown that GIT1-knockout mice have normal locomotor activity, here we examined GIT1-deficient mice for ADHD-like behavior in more detail, and find neither hyperactivity nor amphetamine-induced locomotor suppression. Instead, GIT1-deficient mice exhibit profound learning and memory defects and reduced synaptic structural plasticity, consistent with an intellectual disability phenotype. We conclude that loss of GIT1 alone is insufficient to drive a robust ADHD phenotype in distinct strains of mice. In contrast, multiple learning and memory defects have been observed here and in other studies using distinct GIT1-knockout lines, consistent with a predominant intellectual disability phenotype related to altered synaptic structural plasticity."

Other than defining the cell shape, the cell wall is critical for the interaction with the surrounding environment and the point of contact and interaction with the host surface. In this study, we applied tandem mass spectrometry combined with bioinformatics to investigate cell wall proteome changes in a pir32 null strain. A total of 16 and 25 proteins were identified exclusively in the null mutant strains grown under non-filamentous and filamentous conditions. These proteins included members of the PGA family with various functions, lipase and the protease involved in virulence, superoxide dismutases required for resisting oxidative stress, alongside proteins required for cell wall remodeling and synthesis such as Ssr1, Xog1, Dfg5 and Dcw1. In addition proteins needed for filamentation like Cdc42, Ssu81 and Ucf1, and other virulence proteins such as Als3, Rbt5, and Csa2 were also detected. The detection of these proteins in the mutant and their lack of detection in the wild type can explain the differential phenotypes previously observed."
https://openalex.org/W2792109371,"Aphids are serious pests in crop plants. In an effort to identify plant genes controlling resistance against aphids, we have here studied a protease inhibitor, CI2c in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). The CI2c gene was earlier shown to be upregulated by herbivory of the bird cherry-oat aphid (Rhopalosiphum padi L.) in barley genotypes with moderate resistance against this aphid, but not in susceptible lines. We hypothesized that CI2c contributes to the resistance. To test this idea, cDNA encoding CI2c was overexpressed in barley and bioassays were carried out with R. padi. For comparison, tests were carried out with the green peach aphid (Myzus persicae Sulzer), for which barley is a poor host. The performance of R. padi was not different on the CI2c-overexpressing lines in comparison to controls in test monitoring behavior and fecundity. M. persicae preference was affected as shown in the choice test, this species moved away from control plants, but remained on the CI2c-overexpressing lines. R. padi-induced responses related to defense were repressed in the overexpressing lines as compared to in control plants or the moderately resistant genotypes. A putative susceptibility gene, coding for a β-1,3-glucanase was more strongly induced by aphids in one of the CI2c-overexpressing lines. The results indicate that the CI2c inhibitor in overexpressing lines affects aphid-induced responses by suppressing defense. This is of little consequence to the specialist R.padi, but causes lower non-host resistance towards the generalist M. persicae in barley."

However, CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing of the Wsh/Wsh mouse strain to create an immune-compromised model lacking function of Rag2 and Il2rγ led to unexpected morbidity and mortality. This warranted an investigation to ascertain the cause and predisposing factors associated with the outbreak. Postmortem examination was performed on 15 moribund mice. The main lesions observed in these mice consisted of ascending urogenital tract infections, suppurative otitis media, pneumonia, myocarditis, and meningoencephalomyelitis. As Escherichia coli strains harboring polyketide synthase (pks) genomic island were recently isolated from laboratory mice, the tissue sections from the urogenital tract, heart, and middle ear were subjected to E. coli specific PNA-FISH assay that revealed discrete colonies of E. coli associated with the lesions. Microbiological examination and 16S rRNA sequencing confirmed E. coli-induced infection and septicemia in the affected mice. Further characterization by clb gene analysis and colibactin toxicity assays of the pks+ E. coli revealed colibactin-associated cytotoxicity. Rederivation of the transgenic mice using embryo transfer produced mice with an intestinal flora devoid of pks+ E. coli. Importantly, these barrier-maintained rederived mice have produced multiple litters without adverse health effects. This report is the first to describe acute morbidity and mortality associated with pks+ E. coli urosepsis and meningitis in immunocompromised mice, and highlights the importance of monitoring and exclusion of colibactin-producing pks+ E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W2789880081,"Mosquitoes transmit a number of diseases in animals and humans, including Dengue, Chikungunya and Zika viruses that affect millions of people each year. Controlling the disease-transmitting mosquitoes has proven to be a successful strategy to reduce the viruses transmission. Polyamines are required for the life cycle of the RNA viruses, Chikungunya virus and Zika virus, and a depletion of spermidine and spermine in the host via induction of spermine N-acetyltransferase restricts their replication. Spermine N-acetyltransferase is a key catabolic enzyme in the polyamine pathway, however there is no information of the enzyme identification in any insects. Aliphatic polyamines play a fundamental role in tissue growth and development in organisms. They are acetylated by spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (SAT). In this study we provided a molecular and biochemical identification of SAT from Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. Screening of purified recombinant proteins against polyamines established that aaNAT5b, named previously based on sequence similarity with identified aaNAT1 in insects, is active to spermine and spermidine. A crystal structure was determined and used in molecular docking in this study. Key residues were identified to be involved in spermine binding using molecular docking and simulation. In addition, SAT transcript was down regulated by blood feeding using a real time PCR test. Based on its substrate profile and transcriptional levels after blood feeding, together with previous reports for polyamines required in arboviruses replication, SAT might be potentially used as a target to control arboviruses with human interference."

E. ictaluri is resistant to complement system and macrophage killing, which results in rapid systemic septicemia. However, mechanisms of E. ictaluri stress responses under conditions of host environment are not studied well. Therefore, in this work, we report E. ictaluri stress responses during hydrogen peroxide, low pH, and catfish serum stresses as well as during catfish invasion. E. ictaluri stress responses were characterized by identifying expression of 13 universal stress protein (USP) genes (usp01-usp13) and seven USP-interacting protein genes (groEL, groES, dnaK, grpE, and clpB, grpE, relA). Data indicated that three usp genes (usp05, usp07, and usp13) were highly expressed in all stress conditions. Similarly, E. ictaluri heat shock proteins groEL, groES, dnaK, grpE, and clpB were highly expressed in oxidative stress. Also, E. ictaluri grpE and relA were highly expressed in catfish spleen and head kidney. These findings contribute to our understanding of stress response mechanisms in E. ictaluri stress response, and stress-related proteins that are essential for E. ictaluri could be potential targets for live attenuated vaccine development against ESC."

Adipose tissue surrounding blood vessels may be thermogenically more active in specific areas of the body, releasing substances that regulate vascular metabolism. In humans, the phenotypic characteristics of adipose tissue surrounding the aorta and the cardiovascular disease risk that it might entail remain largely unknown. Here, we compared thermogenesis-related molecular features of human periaortic adipose tissue samples with those of subcutaneous adipose tissue, obtained by sternotomy from 42 patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery. To determine the expression of genes related to energy expenditure and the levels of some adipokines, histological examinations, quantitative PCR, and protein expression measurements in adipocyte precursor cells were performed. Periaortic adipocytes were smaller than those from subcutaneous tissue. Moreover, weight gain induced periaortic adipocyte hypertrophy (r = -0.91, p<0.01). Compared to subcutaneous tissue, adiponectin, FABP4, IL-4 and IL-6 was decreased in periaortic adipocytes, whereas FGF21, UCP-1, PGC-1a, CITED1, Omentin and TFAM (Mitochondrial protein) increased. Upon analyzing patients’ clinical conditions, it emerged that the levels of PGC-1a both in male (r = -0.48 p<0.04) and female (r = -0.61, p<0.05) and TFAM in male (r = -0.72, p<0.0008) and female (r = -0.86, p<0.002) decreased significantly with progressive weight gain. However, no differences were observed in patients with diabetes mellitus 2 or Hyperlipidemia. Adipocytes surrounding the ascending aorta present markers of major thermogenic activity than those in subcutaneous tissue. Nevertheless, this characteristic might change, due to unfavorable metabolic conditions such as obesity, which is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease."
https://openalex.org/W2792070967,"The development of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies through mouse immunization often originates drug candidates that are not cross-reactive to the mouse ortholog. In such cases, and particularly in oncology, drug efficacy studies are performed on human tumor xenografts or with ""surrogate"" anti-mouse ortholog antibodies if targeting tumor host cells. Safety assessment of drug candidate(s) is performed at a later development stage in healthy non-human primates. While the latter remains necessary before a drug advances into human subjects, it precludes evaluation of safety in disease conditions and drug de-risking during early development. Therefore, mouse models that allow concomitant evaluation of drug efficacy and safety are highly desirable. The C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) is an attractive target for tumor-targeted and immuno-oncology therapeutics, with multiple mouse immunization-derived antibodies undergoing clinical trials. Given the pleiotropic role of CXCR4 in cancer biology, we anticipate continuous interest in this target, particularly in the testing of therapeutic combinations for immuno-oncology. Here, we describe the generation and validation of the first mouse knock-in of the whole coding region of human CXCR4. Homozygous human CXCR4 knock-in (hereafter designated as HuCXCR4KI) mice were viable and outwardly healthy, reproduced normally and nursed their young. The expression pattern of human CXCR4 in this model was similar to that of CXCR4 expression in normal human tissues. The human CXCR4 knock-in gene was expressed as a biologically active protein, thereby allowing normal animal development and adequate""homing"" of leukocytes to the bone marrow. To further validate our model, we used an in vivo functional assay of leukocyte mobilization from bone marrow to peripheral blood by blocking CXCR4 signaling. Both an anti-human CXCR4 -specific blocking antibody and the small molecule CXCR4 inhibitor AMD3100 induced increased leukocyte counts in peripheral blood, whereas an anti-mouse CXCR4 -specific blocking antibody had no effect. This new mouse model is useful to evaluate efficacy and safety of anti-human CXCR4 -specific drugs as single agents or in combination therapies, particularly in the oncology, immuno-oncology, wound healing and chronic inflammation therapeutic areas."
https://openalex.org/W2789371197,"In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm-parallel adaptive quantum genetic algorithm-which can rapidly determine the minimum control nodes of arbitrary networks with both control nodes and state nodes. The corresponding network can be fully controlled with the obtained control scheme. We transformed the network controllability issue into a combinational optimization problem based on the Popov-Belevitch-Hautus rank condition. A set of canonical networks and a list of real-world networks were experimented. Comparison results demonstrated that the algorithm was more ideal to optimize the controllability of networks, especially those larger-size networks. We demonstrated subsequently that there were links between the optimal control nodes and some network statistical characteristics. The proposed algorithm provides an effective approach to improve the controllability optimization of large networks or even extra-large networks with hundreds of thousands nodes."
https://openalex.org/W2789730733,"Many mathematical models have investigated the population-level impact of expanding antiretroviral therapy (ART), using different assumptions about HIV disease progression on ART and among ART dropouts. We evaluated the influence of these assumptions on model projections of the number of infections and deaths prevented by expanded ART.A new dynamic model of HIV transmission among men who have sex with men (MSM) was developed, which incorporated each of four alternative assumptions about disease progression used in previous models: (A) ART slows disease progression; (B) ART halts disease progression; (C) ART reverses disease progression by increasing CD4 count; (D) ART reverses disease progression, but disease progresses rapidly once treatment is stopped. The model was independently calibrated to HIV prevalence and ART coverage data from the United States under each progression assumption in turn. New HIV infections and HIV-related deaths averted over 10 years were compared for fixed ART coverage increases.Little absolute difference (<7 percentage points (pp)) in HIV infections averted over 10 years was seen between progression assumptions for the same increases in ART coverage (varied between 33% and 90%) if ART dropouts reinitiated ART at the same rate as ART-naïve MSM. Larger differences in the predicted fraction of HIV-related deaths averted were observed (up to 15pp). However, if ART dropouts could only reinitiate ART at CD4<200 cells/μl, assumption C predicted substantially larger fractions of HIV infections and deaths averted than other assumptions (up to 20pp and 37pp larger, respectively).Different disease progression assumptions on and post-ART interruption did not affect the fraction of HIV infections averted with expanded ART, unless ART dropouts only re-initiated ART at low CD4 counts. Different disease progression assumptions had a larger influence on the fraction of HIV-related deaths averted with expanded ART."
https://openalex.org/W2789327160,"Dopamine (DA) plays a modulatory role in numerous physiological processes such as light adaptation and food intake, and exerts these functions through DA receptors (DARs). This study presents, for the first time, isolation and characterization of the dopamine receptor 2(DA2 receptor) cDNA from the intestinal tissue of Eriocheir sinensis, an economically important freshwater aquaculture species in China. The DA2 receptor cDNA sequence, which was obtained by rapid amplification of cDNA ends, is 2369bp long, encode peptide of 589 amino acid, and is highly homologous to related sequences in crustaceans. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence and the structure of the DA2 indicated that this receptor is a member of the family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), as it contains seven transmembrane domains and other common signatures of GPCRs. RT-PCR showed that the expression of the DA2 receptor gene was distributed in various tissues, and high expression levels were observed in the cranial ganglia and the thoracic ganglia. Further study of the effect of photoperiod on DA2 expression showed that constant darkness induced a significant increase in DA2 expression in the cranial ganglia. Finally, analysis of DA2 receptor expression under different feeding statuses showed that there was significantly greater expression in the hepatopancreas and intestines after feeding than before feeding, but there were no differences in expression between the before feeding and during feeding periods in either tissue. Our results indicate that the DA2 receptor structurally belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors, and that the cranial ganglia are the main tissues in which the DA2 receptor participates in light adaptation during dark hours. In addition, the DA2 receptor in E. sinensis may be involved in the physiological regulation of the hepatopancreas and digestive tract after the ingestion of food. This study provides a foundation for further exploration of the light adaptation and digestive functions of the DA2 receptor in decapods."
https://openalex.org/W2790810891,"In mammals, oleic acid (OA) induces pulmonary edema (PE), which can initiate acute lung injury (ALI) and lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Pulmonary surfactant (PS) plays a key role in a broad range of treatments for ARDS. The aim of the present investigation was to assess changes in the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PC) from choline and determine the effect of exogenous PS on its de novo synthesis in rats with OA-induced PE. Experimental rats were randomized into three groups, including a control group, OA-induced PE group, and OA-induced group treated with exogenous PS (OA-PS). Twenty-four rats were sacrificed 4 h after induction of the OA model, and tissue was examined by light and electron microscopy to assess the severity of ALI using an established scoring system at the end of the experiment. After 15 μCi 3H-choline chloride was injected intravenously, eight rats in each group were sacrificed at 4, 8, and 16 h. The radioactivity of 3H incorporated into total phospholipid (TPL) and desaturated phosphatidylcholine (DSPC) was measured in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissue (LT) using a liquid scintillation counter and was expressed as counts per minute (CPM). Results showed that TPL, DSPC, and the ratio of DSPC/total protein (TP) in lung tissue decreased 4 h after challenge with OA, but the levels recovered after 8 and 16 h. At 8 h after injection, 3H-TPL and 3H-DSPC radioactivity in the lungs reached its peak. Importantly, 3H-DSPC CPM were significantly lower in the PS treatment group (LT: Control: 62327 ± 9108; OA-PE: 97315 ± 10083; OA-PS: 45127 ± 10034, P < 0.05; BALF: Control: 7771 ± 1768; OA-PE: 8097 ± 1799; OA-PE: 3651 ± 1027, P < 0.05). Furthermore, DSPC secretory rate (SR) in the lungs was significantly lower in the PS treatment group at 4 h after injection (Control: 0.014 ± 0.003; OA-PE: 0.011 ± 0.004; OA-PS: 0.023 ± 0.006, P < 0.05). Therefore, we hypothesize that exogenous PS treatments may adversely affect endogenous de novo synthetic and secretory phospholipid pathways via feedback inhibition. This novel finding reveals the specific involvement of exogenous PS in endogenous synthetic and secretory phospholipid pathways during the treatment of ARDS. This information improves our understanding of how PS treatment is beneficial against ARDS and opens new opportunities for expanding its use."
https://openalex.org/W2791845378,"With the exploitation of offshore oil and gas gradually moving to deep water, higher temperature differences and pressure differences are applied to the pipeline system, making the global buckling of the pipeline more serious. For unburied deep-water pipelines, the lateral buckling is the major buckling form. The initial imperfections widely exist in the pipeline system due to manufacture defects or the influence of uneven seabed, and the distribution and geometry features of initial imperfections are random. They can be divided into two kinds based on shape: single-arch imperfections and double-arch imperfections. This paper analyzed the global buckling process of a pipeline with 2 initial imperfections by using a numerical simulation method and revealed how the ratio of the initial imperfection's space length to the imperfection's wavelength and the combination of imperfections affects the buckling process. The results show that a pipeline with 2 initial imperfections may suffer the superposition of global buckling. The growth ratios of buckling displacement, axial force and bending moment in the superposition zone are several times larger than no buckling superposition pipeline. The ratio of the initial imperfection's space length to the imperfection's wavelength decides whether a pipeline suffers buckling superposition. The potential failure point of pipeline exhibiting buckling superposition is as same as the no buckling superposition pipeline, but the failure risk of pipeline exhibiting buckling superposition is much higher. The shape and direction of two nearby imperfections also affects the failure risk of pipeline exhibiting global buckling superposition. The failure risk of pipeline with two double-arch imperfections is higher than pipeline with two single-arch imperfections."
https://openalex.org/W2789393060,"When some individuals are screen-detected before the beginning of the study, but otherwise would have been diagnosed symptomatically during the study, this results in different case-ascertainment probabilities among screened and unscreened participants, referred to here as lead-time-biased case-ascertainment (LTBCA). In fact, this issue can arise even in risk-factor studies nested within a randomized screening trial; even though the screening intervention is randomly allocated to trial arms, there is no randomization to potential risk-factors and uptake of screening can differ by risk-factor strata. Under the assumptions that neither screening nor the risk factor affects underlying incidence and no other forms of bias operate, we simulate and compare the underlying cumulative incidence and that observed in the study due to LTBCA. The example used will be constructed from the randomized Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian cancer screening trial. The derived mathematical model is applied to simulating two nested studies to evaluate the potential for screening bias in observational lung cancer studies. Because of differential screening under plausible assumptions about preclinical incidence and duration, the simulations presented here show that LTBCA due to chest x-ray screening can significantly increase the estimated risk of lung cancer due to smoking by 1% and 50%. Traditional adjustment methods cannot account for this bias, as the influence screening has on observational study estimates involves events outside of the study observation window (enrollment and follow-up) that change eligibility for potential participants, thus biasing case ascertainment."
https://openalex.org/W2794182248,"Mimicry can occur in several contexts, including sexual interactions. In some cases, males mimic females to gain access to potential mates. In contrast, there are relatively few examples of species where females mimic males, and we know very little about what drives these patterns. Two hypotheses have been advanced to explain female mimicry of males. The first is that mimicry is used to reduce harassment of females by males. The second is that mimicry is used to display dominance over other females. In this study, we tested these hypotheses in Brachyrhaphis fishes, wherein females of several species have pigmentation on their anal fin of the same coloration and shape, and in the same location, as the genitalia of males. To test if female mimicry of males reduces male harassment, we experimentally manipulated female pigmentation and observed male preference for females with and without male-like pigmentation. To test the effect that female mimicry of males has on female dominance, we observed how females respond to anal fin pigmentation patterns of companion females. We found that neither of these hypotheses was supported by our data. We conclude that similarities in anal fin pigmentation between male and female Brachyrhaphis fishes is not an adaptation to reduce male harassment or to signal dominance between females. Alternative explanations must exist, including the possibility that these similarities are simply non-adaptive."
