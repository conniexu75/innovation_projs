https://openalex.org/W4281383093,"Repeated emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants with increased fitness underscores the value of rapid detection and characterization of new lineages. We have developed PyR 0 , a hierarchical Bayesian multinomial logistic regression model that infers relative prevalence of all viral lineages across geographic regions, detects lineages increasing in prevalence, and identifies mutations relevant to fitness. Applying PyR 0 to all publicly available SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we identify numerous substitutions that increase fitness, including previously identified spike mutations and many nonspike mutations within the nucleocapsid and nonstructural proteins. PyR 0 forecasts growth of new lineages from their mutational profile, ranks the fitness of lineages as new sequences become available, and prioritizes mutations of biological and public health concern for functional characterization."
https://openalex.org/W4281392549,"Rapid transmission of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron variant has led to record-breaking incidence rates around the world. The Real-time Assessment of Community Transmission-1 (REACT-1) study has tracked SARS-CoV-2 infection in England using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results from self-administered throat and nose swabs from randomly selected participants aged 5 years and older approximately monthly from May 2020 to March 2022. Weighted prevalence in March 2022 was the highest recorded in REACT-1 at 6.37% (N = 109,181), with the Omicron BA.2 variant largely replacing the BA.1 variant. Prevalence was increasing overall, with the greatest increase in those aged 65 to 74 years and 75 years and older. This was associated with increased hospitalizations and deaths, but at much lower levels than in previous waves against a backdrop of high levels of vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W4281296929,"The outbreak of the B.1.1.529 lineage of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (Omicron) has caused an unprecedented number of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases, including pediatric hospital admissions. Policymakers urgently need evidence of vaccine effectiveness in children to balance the costs and benefits of vaccination campaigns, but, to date, the evidence is sparse. Leveraging a population-based cohort in Chile of 490,694 children aged 3-5 years, we estimated the effectiveness of administering a two-dose schedule, 28 days apart, of Sinovac's inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (CoronaVac). We used inverse probability-weighted survival regression models to estimate hazard ratios of symptomatic COVID-19, hospitalization and admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) for children with complete immunization over non-vaccination, accounting for time-varying vaccination exposure and relevant confounders. The study was conducted between 6 December 2021 and 26 February 2022, during the Omicron outbreak in Chile. The estimated vaccine effectiveness was 38.2% (95% confidence interval (CI), 36.5-39.9) against symptomatic COVID-19, 64.6% (95% CI, 49.6-75.2) against hospitalization and 69.0% (95% CI, 18.6-88.2) against ICU admission. The effectiveness against symptomatic COVID-19 was modest; however, protection against severe disease was high. These results support vaccination of children aged 3-5 years to prevent severe illness and associated complications and highlight the importance of maintaining layered protections against SARS-CoV-2 infection."
https://openalex.org/W4281401786,"Abstract Protein–ligand interactions are increasingly profiled at high throughput using affinity selection and massively parallel sequencing. However, these assays do not provide the biophysical parameters that most rigorously quantify molecular interactions. Here we describe a flexible machine learning method, called ProBound, that accurately defines sequence recognition in terms of equilibrium binding constants or kinetic rates. This is achieved using a multi-layered maximum-likelihood framework that models both the molecular interactions and the data generation process. We show that ProBound quantifies transcription factor (TF) behavior with models that predict binding affinity over a range exceeding that of previous resources; captures the impact of DNA modifications and conformational flexibility of multi-TF complexes; and infers specificity directly from in vivo data such as ChIP-seq without peak calling. When coupled with an assay called K D -seq, it determines the absolute affinity of protein–ligand interactions. We also apply ProBound to profile the kinetics of kinase–substrate interactions. ProBound opens new avenues for decoding biological networks and rationally engineering protein–ligand interactions."
https://openalex.org/W4281391087,"Octocorals are major contributors of terpenoid chemical diversity in the ocean. Natural products from other sessile marine animals are primarily biosynthesized by symbiotic microbes rather than by the host. Here, we challenge this long-standing paradigm by describing a monophyletic lineage of animal-encoded terpene cyclases (TCs) ubiquitous in octocorals. We characterized 15 TC enzymes from nine genera, several of which produce precursors of iconic coral-specific terpenoids, such as pseudopterosin, lophotoxin and eleutherobin. X-ray crystallography revealed that coral TCs share conserved active site residues and structural features with bacterial TCs. The identification of coral TCs enabled the targeted identification of the enzyme that constructs the coral-exclusive capnellane scaffold. Several TC genes are colocalized with genes that encode enzymes known to modify terpenes. This work presents an example of biosynthetic capacity in the kingdom Animalia that rivals the chemical complexity generated by plants, unlocking the biotechnological potential of octocorals for biomedical applications."
https://openalex.org/W4281288363,"A key aim in epidemiological neuroscience is identification of markers to assess brain health and monitor therapeutic interventions. Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) is an emerging magnetic resonance imaging technique that measures tissue magnetic susceptibility and has been shown to detect pathological changes in tissue iron, myelin and calcification. We present an open resource of QSM-based imaging measures of multiple brain structures in 35,273 individuals from the UK Biobank prospective epidemiological study. We identify statistically significant associations of 251 phenotypes with magnetic susceptibility that include body iron, disease, diet and alcohol consumption. Genome-wide associations relate magnetic susceptibility to 76 replicating clusters of genetic variants with biological functions involving iron, calcium, myelin and extracellular matrix. These patterns of associations include relationships that are unique to QSM, in particular being complementary to T2* signal decay time measures. These new imaging phenotypes are being integrated into the core UK Biobank measures provided to researchers worldwide, creating the potential to discover new, non-invasive markers of brain health."

https://openalex.org/W4281297277,"N6-methyladenosine (m6A) and its regulatory components play critical roles in various developmental processes in mammals. However, the landscape and function of m6A in early embryos remain unclear owing to limited materials. Here we developed a method of ultralow-input m6A RNA immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing to reveal the transcriptome-wide m6A landscape in mouse oocytes and early embryos and found unique enrichment and dynamics of m6A RNA modifications on maternal and zygotic RNAs, including the transcripts of transposable elements MTA and MERVL. Notably, we found that the maternal protein KIAA1429, a component of the m6A methyltransferase complex, was essential for m6A deposition on maternal mRNAs that undergo decay after zygotic genome activation and MTA transcripts to maintain their stability in oocytes. Interestingly, m6A methyltransferases, especially METTL3, deposited m6A on mRNAs transcribed during zygotic genome activation and ensured their decay after the two-cell stage, including Zscan4 and MERVL. Together, our findings uncover the essential functions of m6A in specific contexts during the maternal-to-zygotic transition, namely ensuring the stability of mRNAs in oocytes and the decay of two-cell-specific transcripts after fertilization."
https://openalex.org/W4281287811,"Diterpenes are major defensive small molecules that enable soft corals to survive without a tough exterior skeleton, and, until now, their biosynthetic origin has remained intractable. Furthermore, biomedical application of these molecules has been hampered by lack of supply. Here, we identify and characterize coral-encoded terpene cyclase genes that produce the eunicellane precursor of eleutherobin and cembrene, representative precursors for the >2,500 terpenes found in octocorals. Related genes are found in all sequenced octocorals and form their own clade, indicating a potential ancient origin concomitant with the split between the hard and soft corals. Eleutherobin biosynthetic genes are colocalized in a single chromosomal region. This demonstrates that, like plants and microbes, animals also harbor defensive biosynthetic gene clusters, supporting a recombinational model to explain why specialized or defensive metabolites are adjacently encoded in the genome. Rather than relying on microbial symbionts, certain corals themselves encode terpene cyclases that produce the eunicellane precursor of defensive terpenes, while the sequences of widespread related cyclase genes indicate a potential ancient origin."
https://openalex.org/W4281293866,"Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are intermediate-sized non-coding RNAs found in all organisms that help translate messenger RNA into protein. Recently, the number of sequenced plant genomes has increased dramatically. The availability of this extensive data greatly accelerates the study of tRNAs on a large scale. Here, 8,768,261 scaffolds/chromosomes containing 229,093 giga-base pairs representing whole-genome sequences of 256 plant species were analyzed to identify tRNA genes. As a result, 331,242 nuclear, 3,216 chloroplast, and 1,467 mitochondrial tRNA genes were identified. The nuclear tRNA genes include 275,134 tRNAs decoding 20 standard amino acids, 1,325 suppressor tRNAs, 6,273 tRNAs with unknown isotypes, 48,475 predicted pseudogenes, and 37,873 tRNAs with introns. Efforts also extended to the creation of PltRNAdb (https://bioinformatics.um6p.ma/PltRNAdb/index.php), a data source for tRNA genes from 256 plant species. PltRNAdb website allows researchers to search, browse, visualize, BLAST, and download predicted tRNA genes. PltRNAdb will help improve our understanding of plant tRNAs and open the door to discovering the unknown regulatory roles of tRNAs in plant genomes."
https://openalex.org/W4281391361,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic have been affecting millions of people worldwide, since the beginning of 2020. COVID-19 can cause a wide range of clinical symptoms, which varies from asymptomatic presentation to severe respiratory insufficiency, exacerbation of immune response, disseminated microthrombosis and multiple organ failure, which may lead to dead. Due to the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2, the development of vaccines to minimize COVID-19 severity in the world population is imperious. One of the employed techniques to produce vaccines against emerging viruses is the synthesis of recombinant proteins, which can be used as immunizing agents. Based on the exposed, the aim of the present study was to verify the systemic and immunological effects of IM administration of recombinant Nucleocapsid protein (NP), derived from SARS-CoV-2 and produced by this research group, in 2 different strains of rats (Rattus norvegicus); Wistar and Lewis. For this purpose, experimental animals received 4 injections of NP, once a week, and were submitted to biochemical and histological analysis. Our results showed that NP inoculations were safe for the animals, which presented no clinical symptoms of worrying side effects, nor laboratorial alterations in the main biochemical and histological parameters, suggesting the absence of toxicity induced by NP. Moreover, NP injections successfully triggered the production of specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies by both Wistar and Lewis rats, showing the sensitization to have been well sufficient for the immunization of these strains of rats. Additionally, we observed the local lung activation of the Bronchus-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (BALT) of rats in the NP groups, suggesting that NP elicits specific lung immune response. Although pre-clinical and clinical studies are still required, our data support the recombinant NP produced by this research group as a potential immunizing agent for massive vaccination, and may represent advantages upon other recombinant proteins, since it seems to induce specific pulmonary protection."
https://openalex.org/W4280588847,"The ATP-dependent ion pump sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) sequesters Ca2+ in the endoplasmic reticulum to establish a reservoir for cell signaling. Because of its central importance in physiology, the activity of this transporter is tightly controlled via direct interactions with tissue-specific regulatory micropeptides that tune SERCA function to match changing physiological conditions. In the heart, the micropeptide phospholamban (PLB) inhibits SERCA, while dwarf open reading frame (DWORF) stimulates SERCA. These competing interactions determine cardiac performance by modulating the amplitude of Ca2+ signals that drive the contraction/relaxation cycle. We hypothesized that the functions of these peptides may relate to their reciprocal preferences for SERCA binding; SERCA binds PLB more avidly at low cytoplasmic [Ca2+] but binds DWORF better when [Ca2+] is high. In the present study, we demonstrated this opposing Ca2+ sensitivity is due to preferential binding of DWORF and PLB to different intermediate states that SERCA samples during the Ca2+ transport cycle. We show PLB binds best to the SERCA E1-ATP state, which prevails at low [Ca2+]. In contrast, DWORF binds most avidly to E1P and E2P states that are more populated when Ca2+ is elevated. Moreover, FRET microscopy revealed dynamic shifts in SERCA-micropeptide binding equilibria during cellular Ca2+ elevations. A computational model showed that DWORF exaggerates changes in PLB-SERCA binding during the cardiac cycle. These results suggest a mechanistic basis for inhibitory versus stimulatory micropeptide function, as well as a new role for DWORF as a modulator of dynamic oscillations of PLB-SERCA regulatory interactions."
https://openalex.org/W4285741267,"Microgreens have been used for raw consumption and are generally viewed as healthy food. This study aimed to optimize the yield parameters, shelf life, sensory evaluation and characterization of total aerobic bacteria (TAB), yeast and mold (Y&M), Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., and Listeria spp. incidence in mungbean (Vigna radiata (L.) Wilczek), lentil (Lens culinaris Medikus subsp. culinaris), and Indian mustard (Brassica juncea (L.) Czern & Coss.) microgreens. In mungbean and lentil, seeding-density of three seed/cm2, while in Indian mustard, eight seed/cm2 were recorded as optimum. The optimal time to harvest mungbean, Indian mustard, and lentil microgreens were found as 7th, 8th, and 9th day after sowing, respectively. Interestingly, seed size was found highly correlated with the overall yield in both mungbeans (r2 = .73) and lentils (r2 = .78), whereas no such relationship has been recorded for Indian mustard microgreens. The target pathogenic bacteria such as Salmonella spp. and Listeria spp. were not detected; while TAB, Y&M, Shigella spp., and E. coli were recorded well within the limit to cause any human illness in the studied microgreens. Washing with double distilled water for two minutes has shown some reduction in the overall microbial load of these microgreens. The results provided evidence that microgreens if grown and stored properly, are generally safe for human consumption. This is the first study from India on the safety of mungbean, lentils, and Indian mustard microgreens."
https://openalex.org/W4280488531,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPARδ) agonists have been shown to exert beneficial effects in liver disease and reduce total bile acid levels. The mechanism(s) whereby PPARδ agonism reduces bile acid levels are, however, unknown, and therefore the aim of the present study was to investigate the molecular pathways responsible for reducing bile acid synthesis in hepatocytes, following treatment with the selective PPARδ agonist, seladelpar. We show that administration of seladelpar to WT mice repressed the liver expression of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase (Cyp7a1), the rate-limiting enzyme for bile acid synthesis, and decreased plasma 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (C4), a freely diffusible metabolite downstream of Cyp7a1. In primary mouse hepatocytes, seladelpar significantly reduced the expression of Cyp7a1 independent of the nuclear bile acid receptor, Farnesoid X receptor. In addition, seladelpar upregulated fibroblast growth factor 21 (Fgf21) in mouse liver, serum, and in cultured hepatocytes. We demonstrate that recombinant Fgf21 protein activated the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway and repressed Cyp7a1 gene expression in primary hepatocytes. The suppressive effect of seladelpar on Cyp7a1 expression was blocked by a JNK inhibitor as well as in the absence of Fgf21, indicating that Fgf21 plays an indispensable role in PPARδ-mediated downregulation of Cyp7a1. Finally, reduction of CYP7A1 expression by seladelpar was confirmed in primary human hepatocytes. In conclusion, we show that seladelpar reduces bile acid synthesis via an FGF21-dependent mechanism that signals at least partially through JNK to repress CYP7A1."
https://openalex.org/W4280651132,"There is substantial evidence for extensive nonvesicular sterol transport in cells. For example, lipid transfer by the steroidogenic acute regulator-related proteins (StarD) containing a StarT domain has been shown to involve several pathways of nonvesicular trafficking. Among the soluble StarT domain-containing proteins, StarD4 is expressed in most tissues and has been shown to be an effective sterol transfer protein. However, it was unclear whether the lipid composition of donor or acceptor membranes played a role in modulating StarD4-mediated transport. Here, we used fluorescence-based assays to demonstrate a phosphatidylinositol phosphate (PIP)-selective mechanism by which StarD4 can preferentially extract sterol from liposome membranes containing certain PIPs (especially, PI(4,5)P2 and to a lesser degree PI(3,5)P2). Monophosphorylated PIPs and other anionic lipids had a smaller effect on sterol transport. This enhancement of transport was less effective when the same PIPs were present in the acceptor membranes. Furthermore, using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we mapped the key interaction sites of StarD4 with PIP-containing membranes and identified residues that are important for this interaction and for accelerated sterol transport activity. We show that StarD4 recognizes membrane-specific PIPs through specific interaction with the geometry of the PIP headgroup as well as the surrounding membrane environment. Finally, we also observed that StarD4 can deform membranes upon longer incubations. Taken together, these results suggest a mechanism by which PIPs modulate cholesterol transfer activity via StarD4."

https://openalex.org/W4281395318,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is the leading joint disease characterized by cartilage destruction and loss of mobility. Accumulating evidence indicates that the incidence and severity of OA increases with diabetes, implicating systemic glucose metabolism in joint health. However, a definitive link between cellular metabolism in articular cartilage and OA pathogenesis is not yet established. Here, we report that in mice surgically induced to develop knee OA through destabilization of medial meniscus (DMM), expression of the main glucose transporter Glut1 is notably reduced in joint cartilage. Inducible deletion of Glut1 specifically in the Prg4-expressing articular cartilage accelerates cartilage loss in DMM-induced OA. Conversely, forced expression of Glut1 protects against cartilage destruction following DMM. Moreover, in mice with type I diabetes, both Glut1 expression and the rate of glycolysis are diminished in the articular cartilage, and the diabetic mice exhibit more severe cartilage destruction than their nondiabetic counterparts following DMM. The results provide proof of concept that boosting glucose metabolism in articular chondrocytes may ameliorate cartilage degeneration in OA."
https://openalex.org/W4281396986,"Supervisor support is crucial for the successful and timely completion of the PhD and the largest contributor to PhD students' overall job satisfaction. The COVID-19 pandemic affected PhD students' life substantially through delayed experiments, missed timelines, running out of funding, change to online team- and supervisor meetings, mandatory working from home, and social confinement.This contribution considers PhD students' satisfaction scores to reflect the extent to which PhD students felt supported by their supervisor during the COVID-19 pandemic so far and aims to investigate to what extent did PhD students' satisfaction with supervisor support changed over time.It uses two longitudinal two cohorts of wave 4 to 5 of the PhD Survey at a Belgian university. These cohorts are representative of two different ways the COVID-19 pandemic might have impacted doctoral research. Cohort 1 (n = 345) includes a pre-COVID measurement (April-May 2019) and a measurement immediately after the start of the abrupt lockdown in April-May 2020. Cohort 2 (n = 349) includes the measurement at the onset of the pandemic in 2020 and after a year with continuously changing containment policies (April-May 2021). The composite measure of satisfaction with supervisor support is based on six items with high internal consistency.No significant net effect of time was revealed. Instead within subject interactions with time showed that in cohort 1, PhD students at the start of their PhD trajectory and PhD students with family responsibilities reported lower supervisor satisfaction scores over time. In cohort 2, PhD students not pursuing academic careers reported lower satisfaction scores over time.In times of crises, special attention needs to be paid to PhD students who are extra susceptible to uncertainties because of their junior status or personal situation, and especially those PhD students for whom doctoral research is not a trajectory to position themselves in academia."

https://openalex.org/W4281384811,"Nearly two decades after the last epidemic caused by a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 quickly spread in 2020 and precipitated an ongoing global public health crisis. Both the continuous accumulation of point mutations, owed to the naturally imposed genomic plasticity of SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary processes, as well as viral spread over time, allow this RNA virus to gain new genetic identities, spawn novel variants and enhance its potential for immune evasion. Here, through an in-depth phylogenetic clustering analysis of upwards of 200,000 whole-genome sequences, we reveal the presence of previously unreported and hitherto unidentified mutations and recombination breakpoints in Variants of Concern (VOC) and Variants of Interest (VOI) from Brazil, India (Beta, Eta and Kappa) and the USA (Beta, Eta and Lambda). Additionally, we identify sites with shared mutations under directional evolution in the SARS-CoV-2 Spike-encoding protein of VOC and VOI, tracing a heretofore-undescribed correlation with viral spread in South America, India and the USA. Our evidence-based analysis provides well-supported evidence of similar pathways of evolution for such mutations in all SARS-CoV-2 variants and sub-lineages. This raises two pivotal points: (i) the co-circulation of variants and sub-lineages in close evolutionary environments, which sheds light onto their trajectories into convergent and directional evolution, and (ii) a linear perspective into the prospective vaccine efficacy against different SARS-CoV-2 strains."
https://openalex.org/W4281390597,"Motivation The outbreak of coronavirus health issues caused by COVID-19(SARS-CoV-2) creates a global threat to public health. Therefore, there is a need for effective remedial measures using existing and approved therapies with proven safety measures has several advantages. Dexamethasone (Pubchem ID: CID0000005743), baricitinib(Pubchem ID: CID44205240), remdesivir (PubchemID: CID121304016) are three generic drugs that have demonstrated in-vitro high antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. The present study aims to widen the search and explore the anti-SARS-CoV-2 properties of these potential drugs while looking for new drug indications with optimised benefits via in-silico research. Method Here, we designed a unique drug-similarity model to repurpose existing drugs against SARS-CoV-2, using the anti-Covid properties of dexamethasone, baricitinib, and remdesivir as references. Known chemical-chemical interactions of reference drugs help extract interactive compounds withimprovedanti-SARS-CoV-2 properties. Here, we calculated the likelihood of these drug compounds treating SARS-CoV-2 related symptoms using chemical-protein interactions between the interactive compounds of the reference drugs and SARS-CoV-2 target genes. In particular, we adopted a two-tier clustering approach to generate a drug similarity model for the final selection of potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug molecules. Tier-1 clustering was based on t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) and aimed to filter and discard outlier drugs. The tier-2 analysis incorporated two cluster analyses performed in parallel using Ordering Points To Identify the Clustering Structure (OPTICS) and Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC). As a result, itidentified clusters of drugs with similar actions. In addition, we carried out a docking study for in-silico validation of top candidate drugs. Result Our drug similarity model highlighted ten drugs, including reference drugs that can act as potential therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2. The docking results suggested that doxorubicin showed the least binding energy compared to reference drugs. Their practical utility as anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs, either individually or in combination, warrants further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W4281392886,"Mental disorders, especially schizophrenia, still pose a great challenge for diagnosis in early stages. Recently, computer-aided diagnosis techniques based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (Rs-fMRI) have been developed to tackle this challenge. In this work, we investigate different decision-level and feature-level fusion schemes for discriminating between schizophrenic and normal subjects. Four types of fMRI features are investigated, namely the regional homogeneity, voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity, fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations and amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations. Data denoising and preprocessing were first applied, followed by the feature extraction module. Four different feature selection algorithms were applied, and the best discriminative features were selected using the algorithm of feature selection via concave minimization (FSV). Support vector machine classifiers were trained and tested on the COBRE dataset formed of 70 schizophrenic subjects and 70 healthy subjects. The decision-level fusion method outperformed the single-feature-type approaches and achieved a 97.85% accuracy, a 98.33% sensitivity, a 96.83% specificity. Moreover, feature-fusion scheme resulted in a 98.57% accuracy, a 99.71% sensitivity, a 97.66% specificity, and an area under the ROC curve of 0.9984. In general, decision-level and feature-level fusion schemes boosted the performance of schizophrenia detectors based on fMRI features."

This study aims to investigate the pandemic impact on pregnancy experience, rates of primary childhood immunisations and the differences in birth outcomes in during 2020 to those of previous years.Self-reported pregnancy experience: 215 expectant mothers (aged 16+) in Wales completed an online survey about their experiences of pregnancy during the pandemic. The qualitative survey data was analysed using codebook thematic analysis. Population-level birth outcomes in Wales: Stillbirths, prematurity, birth weight and Caesarean section births before (2016-2019) and during (2020) the pandemic were compared using anonymised individual-level, population-scale routine data held in the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank. Uptake of the first three scheduled primary childhood immunisations were compared between 2019 and 2020.The pandemic had a negative impact on the mental health of 71% of survey respondents, who reported anxiety, stress and loneliness; this was associated with attending scans without their partner, giving birth alone, and minimal contact with midwives. There was no significant difference in annual outcomes including gestation and birth weight, stillbirths, and Caesarean sections for infants born in 2020 compared to 2016-2019. There was an increase in late term births (≥42 weeks gestation) during the first lockdown (OR: 1.28, p = 0.019) and a decrease in moderate to late preterm births (32-36 weeks gestation) during the second lockdown (OR: 0.74, p = 0.001). Fewer babies were born in 2020 (N = 29,031) compared to 2016-2019 (average N = 32,582). All babies received their immunisations in 2020, but there were minor delays in the timings of immunisations. Those due at 8-weeks were 8% less likely to be on time (within 28-days) and at 16-weeks, they were 19% less likely to be on time.Whilst the pandemic had a negative impact on mothers' experiences of pregnancy. Population-level data suggests that this did not translate to adverse birth outcomes for babies born during the pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W4281959117,"Malignant tumors display profound changes in cellular metabolism, yet how these altered metabolites affect the development and growth of tumors is not fully understood. Here, we used metabolomics to analyze the metabolic profile differences in ovarian cancer and found that citric acid (CA) is the most significantly downregulated metabolite. Recently, CA has been reported to inhibit the growth of a variety of tumor cells, but whether it is involved in pyroptosis of ovarian cancer and its potential molecular mechanisms still remains to be further investigated. Here, we demonstrated that CA inhibits the growth of ovarian cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner. RNA-seq analysis revealed that CA significantly promoted the expression of thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP) and caspase-4 (CASP4). Morphologic examination by transmission electron microscopy indicated that CA-treated ovarian cancer cells exhibited typical pyroptosis characteristics. Further mechanistic analyses showed that CA facilitates pyroptosis via the CASP4/TXNIP-NLRP3-Gesdermin-d (GSDMD) pathway in ovarian cancer. This study elucidated that CA induces ovarian cancer cell death through classical and non-classical pyroptosis pathways, which may be beneficial as an ovarian cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W4280556301,"Retinoid orphan nuclear receptor alpha (RORα) is a member of the orphan nuclear factor family and regulates gene expression by binding to ROR response elements (ROREs). RORα has been identified as a potential tumor suppressor; however, how downregulation of RORα promotes cancer progression is not fully understood. Here, we showed that protein levels of RORα were downregulated during the Snail-, Twist-, or transforming growth factor-β-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). We found that silencing of RORα induced expression of mesenchymal markers in MCF10A cells, accompanied by enhanced cell invasion, migration, and mammosphere formation. Furthermore, ectopic expression of RORα suppressed transforming growth factor-β-induced EMT processes in MCF10A and HMLE cells. These results indicate that downregulation of RORα is crucial for the induction of EMT in mammary epithelial cells. By analyzing gene expression profiles in control and RORα-expressing cells, we also identified Snail, a key regulator of EMT, as a potential target of RORα. We show that RORα expression significantly inhibits Snail transcription in breast cancer cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that RORα bound to the ROREs in promoter region of SNAI1 gene, and using the luciferase reporter assay, we showed that binding to the ROREs was critical for RORα to repress Snail transcription. Finally, rescue experiments substantiated that Snail mediates RORα function in suppressing EMT and mammosphere formation. These results reveal a novel function of RORα in suppressing EMT and identify Snail as a direct target of RORα in mammary epithelial cells."

Case notification rates (CNRs) are readily available, but systematically underestimate true disease burden in neighbourhoods with high diagnostic access barriers. We explored a novel approach, adjusting CNRs for under-notification (P:N ratio) using neighbourhood-level predictors of TB prevalence-to-notification ratios. We analysed data from 1) a citywide routine TB surveillance system including geolocation, confirmatory mycobacteriology, and clinical and demographic characteristics of all registering TB patients in Blantyre, Malawi during 2015-19, and 2) an adult TB prevalence survey done in 2019. In the prevalence survey, consenting adults from randomly selected households in 72 neighbourhoods had symptom-plus-chest X-ray screening, confirmed with sputum smear microscopy, Xpert MTB/Rif and culture. Bayesian multilevel models were used to estimate adjusted neighbourhood prevalence-to-notification ratios, based on summarised posterior draws from fitted adult bacteriologically-confirmed TB CNRs and prevalence. From 2015-19, adult bacteriologically-confirmed CNRs were 131 (479/371,834), 134 (539/415,226), 114 (519/463,707), 56 (283/517,860) and 46 (258/578,377) per 100,000 adults per annum, and 2019 bacteriologically-confirmed prevalence was 215 (29/13,490) per 100,000 adults. Lower educational achievement by household head and neighbourhood distance to TB clinic was negatively associated with CNRs. The mean neighbourhood P:N ratio was 4.49 (95% credible interval [CrI]: 0.98-11.91), consistent with underdiagnosis of TB, and was most pronounced in informal peri-urban neighbourhoods. Here we have demonstrated a method for the identification of neighbourhoods with high levels of under-diagnosis of TB without the requirement for a prevalence survey; this is important since prevalence surveys are expensive and logistically challenging. If confirmed, this approach may support more efficient and effective targeting of intensified TB and HIV case-finding interventions aiming to accelerate elimination of urban TB."
https://openalex.org/W4285742646,"In this age of fierce competitions, customer retention is one of the most important tasks for many companies. Many previous works proposed models to predict customer churn based on various machine learning techniques. In this study, we proposed an advanced churn prediction model using kernel Support Vector Machines (SVM) algorithm for a telecom company. Baseline SVM models were initially built to find out the most suitable kernel types and will be used to make comparison with other approaches. Dimension reduction strategies such as Sequential Forward Selection (SFS) and Sequential Backward Selection (SBS) were applied to the dataset to find out the most important features. Furthermore, resampling techniques to deal with imbalanced data such as Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique Tomek Link (SMOTE Tomek) and Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique ENN (SMOTE ENN) were used on the dataset. Using the above-mentioned techniques, we have obtained better results compared to those obtained from previous works, we achieved an F1-score and accuracy of 99% and 98.9% respectively."
https://openalex.org/W4280633685,"Apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP or abasic) sites are among the most abundant DNA lesions. Numerous proteins within different organisms ranging from bacteria to human have been demonstrated to react with AP sites to form covalent Schiff base DNA-protein cross-links (DPCs). These DPCs are unstable due to their spontaneous hydrolysis, but the half-lives of these cross-links can be as long as several hours. Such long-lived DPCs are extremely toxic due to their large sizes, which physically block DNA replication. Therefore, these adducts must be promptly eradicated to maintain genome integrity. Herein, we used in vitro reconstitution experiments with chemically synthesized, stable, and site-specific Schiff base AP-peptide/protein cross-link analogs to demonstrate for the first time that this type of DPC can be repaired by Escherichia coli (E. coli) long-patch base excision repair. We demonstrated that the repair process requires a minimum of three enzymes and five consecutive steps, including: (1) 5'-DNA strand incision of the DPC by endonuclease IV; (2 to 4) strand-displacement DNA synthesis, removal of the 5'-deoxyribose phosphate-peptide/protein adduct-containing flap, and gap-filling DNA synthesis by DNA polymerase I; and (5) strand ligation by a ligase. We further demonstrated that endonuclease IV plays a major role in incising an AP-peptide cross-link within E. coli cell extracts. We also report that eradicating model AP-protein (11.2-36.1 kDa) DPCs is less efficient than that of an AP-peptide10mer cross-link, supporting the emerging model that proteolysis is likely required for efficient DPC repair."
https://openalex.org/W4280642108,"miRNA-based cellular fate reprogramming offers an opportunity to investigate the mechanisms of long-term gene silencing. To further understand how genes are silenced in a tissue-specific manner, we leveraged our miRNA-based method of reprogramming fibroblasts into cardiomyocytes. Through screening approaches, we identified three proteins that were downregulated during reprogramming of fibroblasts into cardiomyocytes: heterochromatin protein Cbx1, transcriptional activator protein PurB, and transcription factor Sp3. We show that knockdown of Cbx1, PurB, and Sp3 was sufficient to induce cardiomyocyte gene expression in fibroblasts. Similarly, gene editing to ablate Cbx1, PurB, and Sp3 expression induced fibroblasts to convert into cardiomyocytes in vivo. Furthermore, high-throughput DNA sequencing and coimmunoprecipitation experiments indicated that Cbx1, PurB, and Sp3 also bound together as a complex and were necessary to localize nucleosomes to cardiomyocyte genes on the chromosome. Finally, we found that the expression of these genes led to nucleosome modification via H3K27me3 (trimethylated histone-H3 lysine-27) deposition through an interaction with the polycomb repressive PRC2 complex. In summary, we conclude that Cbx1, PurB, and Sp3 control cell fate by actively repressing lineage-specific genes."
https://openalex.org/W4281287065,"Magnetic Resonance images (MRIs) are employed in brain Stereotactic Radiosurgery and Radiotherapy (SRS/SRT) for target and/or critical organ localization and delineation. However, MRIs are inherently distorted, which also impacts the accuracy of the Magnetic Resonance Imaging/Computed Tomography (MRI/CT) co-registration process. In this phantom-based study, geometric distortion is assessed in 3T T2-weighted images (T2WIs), while the efficacy of an MRI distortion correction technique is also evaluated. A homogeneous polymer gel-filled phantom was CT-imaged before being irradiated with 26 4-mm Gamma Knife shots at predefined locations (reference control points). The irradiated phantom was MRI-scanned at 3T, implementing a T2-weighted protocol suitable for SRS/SRT treatment planning. The centers of mass of all shots were identified in the 3D image space by implementing an iterative localization algorithm and served as the evaluated control points for MRI distortion detection. MRIs and CT images were spatially co-registered using a mutual information algorithm. The inverse transformation matrix was applied to the reference control points and compared with the corresponding MRI-identified ones to evaluate the overall spatial accuracy of the MRI/CT dataset. The mean image distortion correction technique was implemented, and resulting MRI-corrected control points were compared against the corresponding reference ones. For the scanning parameters used, increased MRI distortion (&gt;1mm) was detected at areas distant from the MRI isocenter (&gt;5cm), while median radial distortion was 0.76mm. Detected offsets were slightly higher for the MRI/CT dataset (0.92mm median distortion). The mean image distortion correction improves geometric accuracy, but residual distortion cannot be considered negligible (0.51mm median distortion). For all three datasets studied, a statistically significant positive correlation between detected spatial offsets and their distance from the MRI isocenter was revealed. This work contributes towards the wider adoption of 3T imaging in SRS/SRT treatment planning. The presented methodology can be employed in commissioning and quality assurance programmes of corresponding treatment workflows."

Keeping in view the importance of drug interaction possibility, this study was designed to evaluate the effect of ranitidine on pharmacokinetics of amoxicillin in the local population of Karachi, Pakistan. Amoxicillin and ranitidine are the most commonly prescribed drugs to treat duodenal ulcer caused by Helicobacter pylori. The current investigation was carried out as a single center, open label, two phase, single dose, randomized way in cross over manner to evaluate the potential of pharmacokinetic interaction among amoxicillin formulation and ranitidine in adult healthy male volunteers. Post dosing blood samples were collected at multiple time points that are 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 10 hours after administering amoxicillin 250mg capsule with and without ranitidine. For estimation of amoxicillin concentration in plasma, an HPLC method was developed and validated. The solvent system consisted of 0.025M phosphate buffer: acetonitrile (94:6 v/v). C18 column was employed with a flow rate of 1.0 ml/minute and at 230nm. A linear pattern with a correlation coefficient of 0.999 in the concentration ranges of 25μg/mL to 0.097μg/mL for amoxicillin and 25μg/mL to 0.048μg/mL for ranitidine was observed. Amoxicillin retention time was about 8 minutes and ranitidine retention time was around 12 minutes. Amoxicillin levels were computed and the concentrations were applied to calculate the pharmacokinetic parameters. Pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated by Kinetica TM 4.4.1 (Thermo Electron Corp. USA). The analysis of variance (two way) and t test (two one sided) were applied on log transformed pharmacokinetic parameters of amoxicillin. The Tmax was determined between amoxicillin alone and amoxicillin with ranitidine by Friedman test. The 90% confidence interval values for Cmax(calc) (0.687-0.743) and Tmax(calc) (1.148-1.742) for amoxicillin with or without ranitidine were not found within the FDA acceptable limits of 0.8-1.25. Study demonstrated the significant reduction in peak plasma levels of amoxicillin in presence of ranitidine. It is advisable to administer both drugs with time interval to avoid such interactions and increases in the bactericidal efficacy of amoxicillin."
https://openalex.org/W4285744217,"Previous research has demonstrated that adults with comorbid depressive and anxiety disorders are significantly more likely to show pathological use of drugs or alcohol. Few studies, however, have examined associations of this type in children. A better understanding of the relationships between affective disorders and substance experimentation in childhood could help clarify the complex ways in which pathological substance use symptoms develop early in life. The present study included 11,785 children (Mage = 9.9) participating in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study. Depressive and anxiety disorder diagnoses were evaluated as concurrent predictors of experimentation with alcohol and tobacco. A series of linear regressions revealed that children with either depressive or anxiety disorders were significantly more likely to experiment with alcohol or tobacco. However, children with both depressive and anxiety diagnoses were not more likely to experiment than children without a diagnosis. These results suggest that anxiety or depressive diagnoses in childhood may be associated with a greater likelihood of substance experimentation, but severe psychological distress may suppress these effects."
https://openalex.org/W4280577576,"The melanocortin receptor accessory protein 2 (MRAP2) is essential for several physiological functions of the ghrelin receptor growth hormone secretagogue receptor 1a (GHSR1a), including increasing appetite and suppressing insulin secretion. In the absence of MRAP2, GHSR1a displays high constitutive activity and a weak G-protein-mediated response to ghrelin and readily recruits β-arrestin. In the presence of MRAP2, however, G-protein-mediated signaling via GHSR1a is strongly dependent on ghrelin stimulation and the recruitment of β-arrestin is significantly diminished. To better understand how MRAP2 modifies GHSR1a signaling, here we investigated the role of several phosphorylation sites within the C-terminal tail and third intracellular loop of GHSR1a, as well as the mechanism behind MRAP2-mediated inhibition of β-arrestin recruitment. We show that Ser252 and Thr261 in the third intracellular loop of GHSR1a contribute to β-arrestin recruitment, whereas the C-terminal region is not essential for β-arrestin interaction. Additionally, we found that MRAP2 inhibits GHSR1a phosphorylation by blocking the interaction of GRK2 and PKC with the receptor. Taken together, these data suggest that MRAP2 alters GHSR1a signaling by directly impacting the phosphorylation state of the receptor and that the C-terminal tail of GHSR1a prevents rather than contribute to β-arrestin recruitment."
https://openalex.org/W4281383092,"A rapid shrinkage of Daihai Lake was found in recent decades. The present study analyzed the characteristics of Daihai Lake shrinkage and quantified the contribution of climate and human activities. The results of Mann-Kendall- Sneyers test and moving t-test showed that there was an obvious mutation point of lake level in 2006 and the descending speed of Daihai Lake level post-2006 (-0.46m/a) was 3.22 times that of pre-2006 (-0.14m/a). The centroid of Daihai Lake moved 1365.18 m from southwest to northeast during 1989 ~ 2018 with an average speed of 47.08 m/a. The results of Mann-Kendall trend test revealed that the annual evaporation showed a significant downward trend with a rate of approximately -5.33 mm/a, while no significant trend was found in precipitation. Daihai lake water level showed a very weak relationship with evaporation (r = 0.078, p &lt; 0.01) and precipitation (p&gt;0.05) respectively. Daihai Lake was influenced by human activities mainly from land use/ land cover, building reservoirs, pumping groundwater and directly consuming Daihai Lake water by Daihai power plant (DHPP). It was thought-provoking that DHPP began to consume Daihai lake water in 2006, which was consistent with abrupt change of Daihai lake level. The proportion of human impact was fluctuating upward. Human factors were the main factor of lake water reduction in last 10 years and the 5-year average contribution of human activities to Daihai Lake shrinkage was more than 61.99%. More attention and economic support should be given to prevent the continuous shrinkage of Daihai Lake."
https://openalex.org/W4281395093,"Estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer intrinsically confers satisfactory clinical outcomes in response to endocrine therapy. However, a significant proportion of patients with ER+ breast cancer do not respond well to this treatment. Therefore, to evaluate the effects of endocrine therapy, there is a need for identification of novel markers that can be used at the time of diagnosis for predicting clinical outcomes, especially for early-stage and late recurrence. Solute carrier family 20 member 1 (SLC20A1) is a sodium/inorganic phosphate symporter that has been proposed to be a viable prognostic marker for the luminal A and luminal B types of ER+ breast cancer. In the present study, we examined the possible association of SLC20A1 expression with tumor staging, endocrine therapy and chemotherapy in the luminal A and luminal B subtypes of breast cancer. In addition, we analyzed the relationship between SLC20A1 expression and late recurrence in patients with luminal A and luminal B breast cancer following endocrine therapy. We showed that patients with higher levels of SLC20A1 expression (SLC20A1high) exhibited poorer clinical outcomes in those with tumor stage I luminal A breast cancer. In addition, this SLC20A1high subgroup of patients exhibited less responses to endocrine therapy, specifically in those with the luminal A and luminal B subtypes of breast cancer. However, patients with SLC20A1high showed good clinical outcomes following chemotherapy. Patients tested to be in the SLC20A1high group at the time of diagnosis also showed a higher incidence of recurrence compared with those with lower expression levels of SLC20A1, at >15 years for luminal A breast cancer and at 10-15 years for luminal B breast cancer. Therefore, we conclude that SLC20A1high can be used as a prognostic biomarker for predicting the efficacy of endocrine therapy and late recurrence for ER+ breast cancer."

Based on city-level and PM 2.5 data from 280 prefecture-level cities and municipalities in China from 2003 to 2016, we empirically studied the influence of haze on urban innovation and its mechanism. The results show that (1) haze has a significant negative impact on urban innovation, which varies with regions, resource-dependent cities, provincial capital cities, and sub-provincial cities. (2) This result appears to be driven by industrial structure. By influencing the development of the service industry, haze affects the level of urban innovation. (3) In particular, advanced producer services and basic producer services are heterogeneous. Advanced producer services have a stronger impact on innovation, while basic producer services are more sensitive to haze. We used the Instrumental Variable (IV) regression to address endogeneity, the conclusion remains robust."
https://openalex.org/W4281938835,"AGGF1 is an angiogenic factor with G-Patch and FHA domains 1 described by our group. Gain-of-function mutations in AGGF1 cause Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome, whereas somatic loss-of-function mutations cause cancer. Paraspeckles are small membraneless subnuclear structures with a diameter of 0.5-1 μm, and composed of lncRNA NEAT1 as the scaffold and three core RNA-binding proteins NONO, PSPC1, and PSF. Here, we show that AGGF1 is a key regulatory and structural component of paraspeckles that induces paraspeckle formation, forms an outside rim of paraspeckles, wraps around the NONO/PSF/PSPC1/NEAT1 core, and regulates the size and number of paraspeckles. AGGF1-paraspeckles are larger (>1 μm) than conventional paraspeckles. RNA-FISH in combination with immunostaining shows that AGGF1, NONO, and NEAT1_2 co-localize in 20.58% of NEAT1_2-positive paraspeckles. Mechanistically, AGGF1 interacts with NONO, PSF, and HNRNPK, and upregulates NEAT1_2, a longer, 23 kb NEAT1 transcript with a key role in regulation of paraspeckle size and number. RNA-immunoprecipitation shows that AGGF1 interacts with NEAT1, which may be another possible mechanism underlying the formation of AGGF1-paraspeckles. NEAT1_2 knockdown reduces the number and size of AGGF1-paraspeckles. Functionally, AGGF1 regulates alternative RNA splicing as it decreases the exon skipping/inclusion ratio in a CD44 model. AGGF1 is also localized in some nuclear foci without NEAT1 or NONO, suggesting that AGGF1 is an important liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) driver for other types of AGGF1-positive nuclear condensates (referred to as AGGF1-bodies). Our results identify a special type of AGGF1-coated paraspeckles and provide important insights into the formation, structure, and function of paraspeckles."

FMS is suggested to address major caveats of the FMD procedure including its suboptimal repeatability and high-operator dependency. However, the repeatability of FMS has not been thoroughly examined, especially given the plethora of methods claiming to measure PWV. We assessed and compared the intra- and inter-day repeatability of FMS as measured by piezoelectric pressure mechanotransducers placed in the carotid and radial arteries, and brachial artery FMD as measured by echo-tracking. Twenty-four healthy male participants aged 23-75 yr, were examined on three separate days to assess intra and inter-day repeatability. All FMD and FMS examinations were conducted simultaneously by the same researcher complying with standardized guidelines. Repeatability was examined with intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC; >0.80), coefficient of variation (CV; <15%), and limits of agreement (95% LOA). Relative (%) FMD and FMS were scaled for baseline brachial artery diameter and PWV, respectively. Intra- (ICC: 0.72; CV: 136%; 95% LOA: -19.38 to 29.19%) and Inter-day (ICC: 0.69; CV: 145%, 95% LOA: -49.50 to 46.08%) repeatability of %FMS was poor, whereas %FMD demonstrated moderate-to-good intra- (ICC: 0.93; CV: 18%, 95% LOA: -3.02 to 3.75%) and inter-day repeatability (ICC: 0.74; CV: 25%, 95% LOA: -9.16 to 7.04%).

However, only a relatively few studies have addressed the molecular epidemiology of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in this country. The aim of this work was to analyze the genetic structure of drug-resistant (DR) M . tuberculosis population in the Plateau State (central Nigeria), with the results placed in the broader context of West Africa. The study sample included 67 DR M . tuberculosis isolates, recovered from as many TB patients between November 2015 and January 2016, in the Plateau State. The isolates were subjected to spoligotyping and MIRU-VNTR typing. A total of 20 distinct spoligotypes were obtained, split into 3 clusters (n = 50, 74.6%, 2–33 isolates per cluster) and 17 (25.4%) unique patterns. The Cameroon clade was the largest lineage (62.7%) followed by T (28.3%), LAM (3%), and Haarlem (3%) clades. Upon MIRU-VNTR typing, the isolates produced 31 profiles, i.e. 7 clusters (n = 43, 64.2%, 2–17 isolates per cluster) and 24 singletons. A combined spoligotyping and MIRU-VNTR typing analysis showed 20.9% of the cases clustered and estimated the recent transmission rate at 11.9%. In conclusion, two lineages, namely Cameroon, and T accounted for the majority (91%) of cases. No association was observed between the most prevalent Cameroon lineage and drug resistance, including multidrug resistant (MDR) phenotype, or any of the patient demographic characteristics."

Among various rotavirus group A (RVA) strains, the increasingly common genotype G3 (defined by the VP7 gene) has been identified in both humans and animals. Our previous epidemiological surveillance in Bangkok found several unusual non-vaccine-like G3 strains in patients with diarrhea. In this study, we sequenced and characterized the genomes of seven of these G3 strains, which formed combinations with genotypes P[4], P[6], P[9], and P[10] (defined by the VP4 gene). Interestingly, we identified a bat-like RVA strain with the genome constellation G3-P[10]-I3-R3-C3-M3-A9-N3-T3-E3-H6, which has not been previously reported in the literature. The amino acid residues deduced from the nucleotide sequences of our G3 strains differed at the antigenic epitopes to those of the VP7 capsid protein of the G3 strain in RotaTeq vaccine. Although it is not unusual for the segmented genomes of RVA to reassort and give rise to emerging novel strains, the atypical G3 strains identified in this study suggest possible animal-to-human RVA zoonotic spillover even in urban areas."

https://openalex.org/W4281385820,"Background For more than 150 years, war surgery has been at the heart of the humanitarian assistance offered by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in conflict zones around the world. Mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) is increasingly recognized as an integral part of the medical care offered to this highly vulnerable group of patients. This study seeks to identify patient characteristics associated with high distress prior to MHPSS and predictors of improvement following it. Methods Between October 2018 and April 2020, 2,008 weapon-wounded patients received MHPSS in ICRC-supported hospitals in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Mali and Nigeria. The 21-item Depression and Anxiety Scale (DASS21), the Impact of Events Scale Revised (IES-R) and the ICRC functionality scale for Africa were administered before and after the MHPSS response. Logistic regression models were used to measure associations between outcome and exposure variables. Data was initially collected for monitoring purposes and analyzed retrospectively for the sake of this study. Results The main reasons for surgery were firearms (65%), other weapons (13%) and mines (5%). Linear trends were found between increasing number of days between violence and first consultation and decreased likelihood of presenting high levels of anxiety (aOR 0.75, p = 0.014), and stress (aOR 0.78, p = 0.032). Violence committed by military/armed group was associated with increased likelihood of reporting high levels of anxiety (aOR 2.47, p = 0.047). On the IES-R, high scores at baseline were more likely to be found among illiterate patients (aOR 0.08, p = 0.042) and having been wounded by firearms considerably increased the likelihood of reporting high levels of PTSD (aOR 21.34, p = 0.035). Following MHPSS, 92.28% of the patients showed a reduction in symptoms on the DASS21, 93.00% showed a reduction in symptoms on the IES-R and 83.04% showed an improvement on the ICRC Africa functioning scale. On the DASS21, factors negatively associated with improved anxiety included lack of social support (aOR 0.17, p = 0.047) and suffering from a chronic medical/physical condition (aOR 0.40, p = 0.013). Patients with reduced IES-R scores were more likely to have a high level of education (aOR 8.95, p = 0.029) and to have received MHPSS that lasted between 22 and 30 days (aOR 8.73, p = 0.008). Predictors of improved functioning included being 35–44 years of age (aOR 3.74, p = 0.004) and suffering from a severe or chronic medical condition (aOR 1.66, p = 0.044). Conclusions Clinical implications of this study include the increased involvement of family and other caregivers in the MHPSS and longer-term follow-up of patients with severe and/or chronic medical conditions. Further research is needed with regard to joint psychological and physical outcomes, the role of the patient’s education level and the personal styles and techniques used by the counsellors."
https://openalex.org/W4281390469,"Background Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) is an essential cardiac biomarker for diagnosing heart failure and for prognoses in patients with various cardiac diseases. However, measurement requires immunological assays that are not available in every hospital. Recently, a novel BNP kit (Nanopia BNP-A, Sekisui Inc.; BNPn) that uses general-purpose, automated, biochemical analyzers has become commercially available. We assessed how its accuracy and utility compare with those of conventional immunological tests. Methods and results We retrospectively collected 1491 conventional BNP measurements (BNPc), which had been clinically indicated for BNP testing and for which residual samples were still stored in the laboratory. We measured BNP using the novel kit and determined the correlation of BNP levels between the two methods. We also assessed the predictive value of both BNP measurements for major cardiac events (MACEs). The analytical performance of both measuring methods was similar. Log-transformed BNP measured by both methods showed strong correlation (r = 0.92); however, log-transformed BNPn was significantly higher than log-transformed BNPc (p&lt;0.001). BNPc of 200 ng/L was used to stratify patients into two groups. According to the regression formula between the two methods, we determined a cut-off value of BNPn as 250 ng/L. During a median of 15 months of follow-up, 43 MACEs developed. Both BNPc and BNPn were associated with MACEs. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicated that both BNPc and BNPn cut-off values stratified the high-risk group for prognostication. The diagnostic and prognostic utilities were proven even if the lower cut-off values (BNPc = 100 ng/L, BNPn = 130 ng/L) were employed. Conclusions A new BNP measurement using biochemical equipment provides prognostic value similar to that of conventional BNP analysis; thus, it should prove useful in hospitals in which conventional immunological examinations are not available."

In addition, 55 patients were enrolled, through quota sampling, after excluding those with diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar-hyperglycaemic state and patients &lt; 18 years. A self-administrated questionnaire enabled to collect data from health staff and patient data were extracted from the medical records. SPSS-23 was used to analyze the collected data. Chi-square and ANOVA tests assessed the association among variables, these tests were considered statistically significant when p ≤ 0.05. The training on hyperglycaemia control differed ( p = 0.017) between doctors and nurses. The target glycaemic level (140–180 mg/dl) was known by 11.1% of the study participants. Neither the knowledge nor the practice of hyperglycaemia control methods differed among staff ( p &gt; 0.05). The use of sliding scale was prevalent (79.3%) across the ICUs ( p = 0.002). 31.5% of the patients had received different glycaemic control methods, 11.8% were in the targeted blood glucose level. Sliding scale was the method used by doctors and nurses (71.4% and 81.6% respectively). Lack of awareness about hyperglycaemia management methods was prevalent among ICU healthcare staff. Use of obsolete methods was the common practice in the ICUS of the Military Hospital. Target blood glucose for patients were unmet. Development of a local protocol for glycaemic control in all ICUs is needed along with sustained training programs on hyperglycaemia control for ICU healthcare staff."

In order to develop the effective antiviral therapies, it is required to understand the molecular mechanisms of the SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. The main protease, or 3C-like protease (3CL pro ), plays the essential role in the coronavirus replication that makes the enzyme a promising therapeutic target. Viral enzymes are known to be multifunctional. Particularly, 3CL pro of SARS-CoV was shown to induce apoptosis in addition to its main function. In the present study we analyzed the cytotoxicity of active SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro and its inactivated form upon their individual expression in four human cell lines. For this purpose, we constructed a protein biosensor which allows to detect the proteolytic activity of SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro and confirmed the expression of the active protease in all cell lines used. We studied viability and morphology of the cells and found that both active and inactivated enzyme variants induce no cell death in contrast to the homologous 3CL protease of SARS-CoV. These results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro is unlikely contribute to the cytopathic effect observed during viral infection directly."
https://openalex.org/W4285740306,"High-quality general practice has been demonstrated to provide cost-effective, equitable health care and improve health outcomes. Yet there is currently not a set of agreed comprehensive indicators in Australia. We have developed 79 evidence-based indicators and their corresponding 129 measures of high-quality general practice. This study aims to achieve consensus on relevant and feasible indicators and measures for the Australian context.This Delphi consensus study, approved by WSU Human Research Ethics Committee, consists of three rounds of online survey with general practice experts including general practitioners, practice nurses and primary health network staff. The identified indicators and measures are grouped under an attribute framework aligned with the Quadruple Aim, and further grouped under structures, processes and outcomes according to the Donabedian framework. Participants will rate each indicator and measure for relevance and feasibility, and provide comments and recommendations of additional indicators or measures. In the last round, participants will also be asked their views on the implementation of a quality indicator tool. Each indicator and measure will require ≥70% agreement in both relevance and feasibility to achieve consensus. Aggregated ratings will be statistically analysed for response rates, level of agreement, medians, interquartile ranges and group rankings. Qualitative responses will be analysed thematically using a mixed inductive and deductive approach.This protocol will add to the current knowledge of the translation of performance guidelines into quality practice across complex clinical settings and in a variety of different contexts in Australian general practice. The Delphi technique is appropriate to develop consensus between the diverse experts because of its ability to offer anonymity to other participants and minimise bias. Findings will contribute to the design of an assessment tool of high-quality general practice that would enable future primary health care reforms in Australia."
