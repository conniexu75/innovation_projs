https://openalex.org/W2057784785,"Lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1) is a leukocyte cell surface glycoprotein that promotes intercellular adhesion in immunological and inflammatory reactions. It is an αβ complex that is structurally related to receptors for extracellular matrix components, and thus belongs to the integrin family. ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule-1) is a distinct cell surface glycoprotein. Its broad distribution, regulated expression in inflammation, and involvement in LFA-1-dependent cell-cell adhesion have suggested that ICAM-1 may be a ligand for LFA-1. We have purified ICAM-1 and incorporated it into artificial supported lipid membranes. LFA-1+ but not LFA-1- cells bound to ICAM-1 in the artificial membranes, and the binding could be specifically inhibited by anti-ICAM-1 treatment of the membranes or by anti-LFA-1 treatment of the cells. The cell binding to ICAM-1 required metabolic energy production, an intact cytosloeleton, and the presence of Mg2+ and was temperature dependent, characteristics of LFA-1- and ICAM-1-dependent cell-cell adhesion."
https://openalex.org/W2036890038,"A model system for cytokine-induced up-regulation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) expression in chronically infected promonocyte clones was established. The parent promonocyte cell line U937 was chronically infected with HIV-1 and from this line a clone, U1, was derived. U1 showed minimal constitutive expression of HIV-1, but virus expression was markedly up-regulated by a phytohemagglutinin-induced supernatant containing multiple cytokines and by recombinant granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor alone. Recombinant interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-2, interferon-gamma, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha did not up-regulate virus expression. Concomitant with the cytokine-induced up-regulation of HIV-1, expression of membrane-bound IL-1 beta was selectively induced in U1 in the absence of induction of other surface membrane proteins. This cytokine up-regulation of IL-1 beta was not seen in the uninfected parent U937 cell line. These studies have implications for the understanding of the mechanism of progression from a latent or low-level HIV-1 infection to a productive infection with resulting immunosuppression. In addition, this model can be used to delineate the potential mechanisms whereby HIV-1 infection regulates cellular gene expression."

https://openalex.org/W2003798106,"A DNA binding protein (RAP1, previously called SBF-E) has been shown to bind to putative regulatory sites at both yeast mating-type silencers, yet is not the product of genetically identified regulators of the silent loci. Here, we report the purification of RAP1 by DNA affinity chromatography, and the isolation of its gene from a λgt11 genomic library using antibodies raised against the protein. Disruption of the chromosomal copy of this gene is lethal. We show that RAP1 protein also binds in vitro to the upstream activation site (UAS) of MATα and ribosomal protein genes. In addition, we show that two different UAS-associated RAP1 binding sites can substitute in vivo for a silencer binding site. Our results suggest that RAP1 may be a transcriptional regulator that can play a role in either repression or activation of transcription, depending upon the context of its binding site."

https://openalex.org/W1505075493,"The cDNAs encoding the normal human insulin receptor (HIRc) and a receptor that had lysine residue 1018 replaced by alanine (A/K1018) were used to transfect Rat 1 fibroblasts. Lysine 1018 is a critical residue in the ATP binding site of the tyrosine kinase domain in the receptor beta-subunit. Untransfected Rat 1 cells express 1700 endogenous insulin receptors. Expressed HIRc receptors had levels of insulin-stimulable autophosphorylation in vitro comparable to normal receptors, whereas A/K1018 receptors had less than 1% of that activity. Stimulation by insulin of HIRc receptors in situ in intact cells led to phosphorylation of beta-subunit tyrosine residues and activation of tyrosine kinase activity that could be preserved and assayed in vitro after receptor purification. In contrast, A/K1018 receptors showed no such activation, either of autophosphorylation or of kinase activity toward histone. Cells expressing HIRc receptors display enhanced sensitivity to insulin of 2-deoxyglucose transport and glycogen synthase activity. This increased sensitivity was proportional to insulin receptor number at low but not at high levels of receptor expression. A/K1018 receptors were unable to mediate these biologic effects and actually inhibited insulin's ability to stimulate glucose transport and glycogen synthase through the endogenous Rat 1 receptors. Expressed HIRc receptors mediated insulin internalization and degradation, whereas A/K1018 receptors mediated little, if any. Endocytotic uptake of the expressed A/K1018 insulin receptors was also markedly depressed compared to normal receptors. Unlike HIRc receptors, A/K1018 receptors also fail to undergo down-regulation after long (24 h) exposures to high (170 nM) concentrations of insulin. We conclude the following. 1) Normal human insulin receptors expressed in Rat 1 fibroblasts display active tyrosine-specific kinase, normal intracellular itinerary after endocytosis, and normal coupling to insulin's biologic effects. 2) A receptor mutated to alter the ATP binding site in the tyrosine kinase domain had little if any tyrosine kinase activity. 3) This loss of kinase activity was accompanied by a nearly complete lack of both endocytosis and biologic activity."
https://openalex.org/W1546917481,"Bacteriophage T7 gene 5 protein has been purified to apparent homogeneity from cells overexpressing its gene several hundred-fold. Gene 5 protein is a DNA polymerase with low processivity; it dissociates from the primer-template after catalyzing the incorporation of 1-50 nucleotides, depending on the salt concentration. Escherichia coli thioredoxin, a host protein that is tightly associated with the gene 5 protein in phage-infected cells, is not required for this activity. Thioredoxin acts as an accessory protein to bestow processivity on the polymerizing reaction; DNA synthesis catalyzed by the gene 5 protein-thioredoxin complex on a single-stranded DNA template can polymerize thousands of nucleotides without dissociation. Conditions that increase the stability of secondary structures in the template (i.e., low temperature or high ionic strength) decrease the processivity. E. coli single-stranded DNA-binding protein stimulates both the rate of elongation and the processivity of the gene 5 protein-thioredoxin complex."

https://openalex.org/W2013554145,"Repression of the yeast silent mating type loci requires cis-acting sequences located over 1 kb from the regulated promoters. One of these sites, a ""silencer,"" exhibits enhancer-like distance- and orientation-independence. The silencer demonstrates both autonomous replication sequence (ARS) activity and a centromere-like segregation function, suggesting roles for DNA replication and segregation in transcriptional repression. Here we identify three sequences (A, E, and B) involved both in repression and in either ARS or segregation activity. The sequences are functionally redundant: no one is essential for complete transcriptional control, but mutations in any two inactivate the silencer. Surprisingly, elements E and B can each activate transcription from heterologous promoters, and E shows striking homology to several yeast upstream activation sequences. Therefore, sequences individually involved in replication, segregation, and transcriptional activation can, at the silencer, efficiently repress transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2061628918,"Genes involved in the transduction of signals required for normal cell proliferation commonly appear to be subverted in the neoplastic process1. One such group is the highly conserved family of ras genes, which have been detected as transforming genes in a wide variety of naturally occurring tumours. By analogy with other known G proteins2, the p21 proteins encoded by ras genes may act as regulatory proteins in the transduction of signals that lead to DNA synthesis. A major pathway involved in the DNA synthesis induced by growth factors is mediated by phosphatidylinositol turnover: cleavage of phosphoinositides by phospholipase C produces 1,2-diacylglycerol, and inositol phosphates3. The former acts as an essential cofactor for protein kinase C (ref. 4), and inositol-(l,4,5)-triphosphate mobilizes Ca2+ from non-mitochondrial intracellular stores5. We demonstrate a reproducible increase in 1,2-diacylglycerol, in the absence of a detectable increase in inositol phosphates, in transformed cells containing Ha-ras oncogenes and with different membrane targeting signals for the ras p21 protein. These findings suggest that a source other than phosphoinositides exists for the generation of 1,2-diacylglycerol and that the Ha-ras oncogene specifically activates this novel pathway for 1,2-diacylglycerol production."
https://openalex.org/W1641205561,"Type I procollagen was purified from the medium of cultured human fibroblasts incubated with 14C-labeled amino acids, the NH2-terminal propeptides were cleaved with procollagen N-proteinase, and the resulting pC-collagen was isolated by gel filtration chromatography. pC-collagen did not assemble into fibrils or large aggregates even at concentrations of 0.5 mg.ml-1 at 34 degrees C in a physiological buffer. However, cleavage of pC-collagen to collagen with purified C-proteinase (Hojima, Y., (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 15996-16003) generated fibrils that were visible by eye and that were large enough to be separated from solution by centrifugation at 13,000 x g for 4 min. With high concentrations of enzyme, the pC-collagen was completely cleaved in 1 h, and turbidity was near maximal in 3 h, but collagen continued to be incorporated in fibrils for over 10 h. Because the pC-collagen was uniformly labeled with 14C-aminoacids, the concentration of soluble collagen and, therefore, the critical concentration of polymerization were determined directly. The critical concentration was independent of the initial pC-collagen concentration and of the rate of cleavage. The critical concentration decreased with temperature between 29 and 41 degrees C and was 0.12 +/- 0.06 (S.E.) microgram.ml-1 at 41 degrees C. The thermodynamic parameters of assembly were essentially independent of temperature in the range 29 to 41 degrees C. The process was endothermic with a delta H value of +56 kcal.mol-1, but entropy driven with a delta S value of +220 cal.K-1.mol-1. The Gibbs energy change for polymerization was -13 kcal.mol-1 at 37 degrees C. The data demonstrate, for the first time, that type I collagen fibril formation de novo is a classical example of an entropy-driven self-assembly process similar to the polymerization of actin, flagella, and tobacco mosaic virus protein."

https://openalex.org/W1967560742,Left-handed DNA is shown to exist and elicit a biological response in Escherichia coli. A plasmid encoding the gene for a temperature-sensitive Eco RI methylase (MEco RI) was cotransformed with different plasmids containing inserts that had varying capacities to form left-handed helices or cruciforms with a target Eco RI site in the center or at the ends of the inserts. Inhibition of methylation in vivo was found for the stable inserts with the longest left-handed (presumably Z) helices. In vitro methylation with the purified MEco RI agreed with the results in vivo. Supercoil-induced changes in the structure of the primary helix in vitro provided confirmation that left-handed helices were responsible for this behavior. The presence in vivo of left-handed inserts elicits specific deletions and plasmid incompatibilities in certain instances.

https://openalex.org/W1211711083,"The DNA polymerase activity induced after bacteriophage T7 infection of Escherichia coli is found in a complex of two proteins, the T7 gene 5 protein and a host protein, thioredoxin. Gene 5 protein is a DNA polymerase and a 3' to 5' exonuclease. Thioredoxin binds tightly to the gene 5 protein and increases the processivity of polymerization some 1000-fold. Gene 5 protein forms a short-lived complex with the primer-template, poly(dA).oligo(dT), in the absence of Mg2+ and nucleotides. Thioredoxin increases the half-life of the preformed primer-template-polymerase complex from less than a second to approximately 5 min. The dissociation is accelerated by excess single-stranded DNA in an apparent second order reaction, indicating direct transfer of polymerase between DNA fragments. Thioredoxin also reduces the equilibrium dissociation constant, Kd, of the gene 5 protein -poly(dA).oligo(dT) complex 20- to 80-fold. The salt dependence of Kd indicates that thioredoxin stabilizes the primer-template-polymerase complex mainly through additional charge-charge interactions, increasing the estimated number of interactions from 2 to 7. The affinity of gene 5 protein for single-stranded DNA is at least 1000-fold higher than for double-stranded DNA and is little affected by thioredoxin. Under conditions of steady state synthesis the effect of thioredoxin on the polymerization rate is determined by two competing factors, an increase in processivity and a decrease of the dissociation rate of polymerase and replicated template."

https://openalex.org/W2004073738,"We show, using a combination of methods, that contrary to the usual view, lac repressor increases, by more than 100-fold, the initial binding of RNA polymerase to E. coli lac UV5 promoter DNA. Kinetic studies revealed that the repressor acts to block the isomerization step in transcription initiation. When IPTG, a gratuitous inducer, is added, formation of open complex and productive transcription proceed. Because of the large increases in the binding constant, at low polymerase concentrations the presence of lac repressor (and then inducer) actually increases the rate of the first round of productive transcription, thus allowing the system to respond rapidly to the release of repression. This dual role of stabilization of a pretranscriptional complex coupled with blockage of transcription initiation may be a more general model for genetic regulation than that provided by the concept of simple repression."
https://openalex.org/W2006388475,"There is substantial evidence that the haematopoietic microenvironment is crucial to the growth and differentiation of haematopoietic cells. This microenvironment is composed of stromal cells, soluble factors and extracellular matrix (ECM). We have shown that a complex extract of bone marrow ECM can stimulate the growth and differentiation of haematopoietic cells in vitro1. Furthermore, the use of inhibitors2 or stimulators3 of ECM synthesis in long-term marrow culture affects cell proliferation. On a molecular level, however, the interactions between ECM and haematopoietic cells are not well understood. We have investigated the adhesion between specific bone marrow ECM components and haematopoietic cells, and found a protein, 'haemonectin', of relative molecular mass 60,000 in bone marrow ECM which is a lineage- and organ-specific attachment molecule for cells of granulocyte lineage. This specificity distinguishes haemonectin from previously described adhesion proteins which have a wider tissue distribution and cell type specificity."
https://openalex.org/W1481859953,"The GTP-induced dissociation of T alpha from T beta gamma initiates the release of transducin from photolyzed rhodopsin and the subsequent activation of the cGMP phosphodiesterase. In this study, site-specific proteolysis and immunoprecipitation were used to map the domain of T alpha that interacts with T beta gamma. We found that Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease rapidly removes a small fragment from T alpha under native conditions, resulting in the formation of a single 38-kDa polypeptide (T alpha'). Under the same conditions, T beta gamma remains intact. A 4.5-fold decrease in the rate of T alpha cleavage by S. aureus protease was observed in the presence of T beta gamma, suggesting T beta gamma binding blocks the protease-sensitive site on T alpha. Amino acid sequence analysis indicated that T alpha' is derived from the cleavage of T alpha at Glu-21. The ability of T alpha' to interact with and activate the retinal phosphodiesterase is not diminished. However, T alpha' is unable to participate in T beta gamma-dependent activities such as the light-stimulated binding of guanine nucleotides, binding to photoexcited rhodopsin, and ADP-ribosylation catalyzed by pertussis toxin. Moreover, the anti-T alpha monoclonal antibody TF16 was able to precipitate T beta gamma in the presence of T alpha, but not with either T alpha' or T alpha-guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate). We conclude that the amino-terminal region of T alpha participates in T beta gamma interaction and discuss our results with respect to the known structure and function of transducin."
https://openalex.org/W2089082472,"To investigate whether the activated N-ras oncogene of HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells contributes to the expression of the transformed phenotype, we have isolated flat revertants. In two independent revertant lines, an increase in chromosomal ploidy occurred without a concomitant increase in the number of copies of the N-ras transforming allele. Immunoprecipitation confirms that the level of the mutant N-ras p21 gene product in the revertants is correspondingly lower than in HT1080. Analysis of sporadic tumors derived from the revertant cells reveals an increased dosage of the transforming allele. The revertants also retransform after transfection of cloned activated ras oncogenes. These results imply direct participation of an N-ras oncogene in maintaining the transformed phenotype of a human tumor cell line."

https://openalex.org/W1590657000,"The internalization and degradation of insulin was assessed in Chinese hamster ovary cell lines expressing either the wild-type receptor or mutated receptors lacking kinase activity. The mutated receptors included receptors which differed from the wild-type receptor by a single amino acid (substitution of an arginine for lysine at position 1030, a site critical for ATP binding) as well as receptors which had a deletion of 112 amino acids at the carboxyl terminus. Cells expressing mutated receptors lacking kinase activity were found to internalize and degrade insulin at about half the rate of cells expressing wild-type receptors with kinase activity. Moreover, insulin was found incapable of inducing the internalization of the mutated receptors, whereas it could stimulate the internalization of the wild-type receptor. Finally, the constitutive rate of receptor internalization was found to be the same for the mutant and wild-type receptors. These results implicate the intrinsic tyrosine-specific kinase activity of the insulin receptor in the ligand-induced, but not the constitutive, internalization of this receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2076942162,"We examined the role of proteolytic ligand modification in endosomal targeting using vitellogenin (VTG) uptake by Xenopus oocytes as a model system. Non-cleavable VTG is internalized, but does not appear in yolk platelets. We identified two inhibitors of VTG processing into the yolk proteins: the ionophore monensin and pepstatin A, a specific inhibitor of cathepsin D. Pepstatin neither affected ligand binding and internalization, nor inhibited the degradation of nonspecifically incorporated proteins, whereas monensin inhibited all of these processes. Inhibiting VTG processing prevented its deposition into yolk platelets by strongly interfering with endosome-yolk platelet fusion. Monensin treatment resulted in morphologically abnormal endosomes, while pepstatin only inhibited VTG cleavage and the subsequent fusion of endosomes with yolk platelets. Since VTG cleavage is initiated prior to its deposition in platelets, we postulate that ligand proteolysis could be necessary for normal endosomal targeting."
https://openalex.org/W1497290733,"We have previously shown that the gene (speD) for S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase is part of an operon that also contains the gene (speE) for spermidine synthase (Tabor, C. W., Tabor, H., and Xie, Q.-W. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 83, 6040-6044). We have now determined the nucleotide sequence of this operon and have found that speD codes for a polypeptide of Mr = 30,400, which is considerably greater than the subunit size of the purified enzyme. Our studies show that S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase is first formed as a Mr = 30,400 polypeptide and that this proenzyme is then cleaved at the Lys111-Ser112 peptide bond to form a Mr = 12,400 subunit and a Mr = 18,000 subunit. The latter subunit contains the pyruvoyl moiety that we previously showed is required for enzymatic activity. Both subunits are present in the purified enzyme. These conclusions are based on (i) pulse-chase experiments with a strain containing a speD+ plasmid which showed a precursor-product relationship between the proenzyme and the enzyme subunits, (ii) the amino acid sequence of the proenzyme form of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (derived from the nucleotide sequence of the speD gene), and (iii) comparison of this sequence of the proenzyme with the N-terminal amino acid sequences of the two subunits of the purified enzyme reported by Anton and Kutny (Anton, D. L., and Kutny, R. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 2817-2822)."
https://openalex.org/W1606784082,"An Escherichia coli double mutant, sodAsodB, that is deficient in both bacterial superoxide dismutases (Mn superoxide dismutase and iron superoxide dismutase) is unable to grow on minimal medium in the presence of oxygen and exhibits increased sensitivity to paraquat and hydrogen peroxide. Expression of the evolutionarily unrelated eukaryotic CuZn superoxide dismutase in the sodAsodB E. coli mutant results in a wild-type phenotype with respect to aerobic growth on minimal medium and in resistance to paraquat and hydrogen peroxide. This supports the hypothesis that superoxide dismutation is the in vivo function of these proteins. Analysis of the growth of sodAsodB cells containing plasmids encoding partially active CuZn superoxide dismutases, produced by in vitro mutagenesis, shows a correlation between cell growth and enzyme activity. Thus, the sodAsodB strain provides a controlled selection for varying levels of superoxide dismutase activity."
https://openalex.org/W2034307038,"The yeast ribosomal protein gene RPL32 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is of particular interest for two reasons: 1) it is adjacent to another ribosomal protein gene, RP29, whose divergent transcription may be driven from the same control sequences, and 2) it appears that the splicing of its transcript is regulated by the product of the gene, ribosomal protein in L32. RPL32 has been analyzed in detail. It is essential for cell growth. Its sequence predicts L32 to be a protein of 105 amino acids, somewhat basic near the NH2 terminus, rather acidic near the COOH terminus, and homologous to ribosomal protein L30 of mammals. The reading frame has been confirmed by partial NH2-terminal analysis of L32. The nucleotide sequence also predicts an intron of 230 nucleotides, which begins with the unusual sequence GTCAGT and ends 40 nucleotides downstream of the consensus sequence TAC-TAAC. The intron has been confirmed by determination of the sequence of a cDNA clone. Transcription initiates 58 nucleotides upstream of the AUG initiation codon, and the polyadenylation site occurs 100 nucleotides downstream of the termination codon. Regulation of the transcription of ribosomal protein genes has been linked to two related consensus sequences. Analysis of the intergenic region between RP29 and RPL32 reveals three copies of these sequences. A deletion removing all three sequences reduces synthesis of a L32-LacZ fusion protein by more than 90%. Some residual activity, however, remains."
https://openalex.org/W1560372529,"Abstract Glucagon, a peptide hormone which regulates hepatic carbohydrate metabolism, is processed from a larger precursor, proglucagon. The gene encoding proglucagon is expressed at high levels in the A cells of the pancreatic islets and the L cells of the intestine, indicating that specific factors present in these two phenotypically distinct cells direct cell-specific expression. To characterize the factors that mediate glucagon gene transcription, we analyzed the 5'-flanking region of the rat glucagon gene for the existence of cis-acting sequences that promote glucagon gene transcription. A series of fusion genes containing sequentially shortened 5'-flanking sequences of the rat glucagon gene were constructed and fused to the coding sequence of the reporter enzyme chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. Analyses of the transcription of these fusion genes after their transfection into choriocarcinoma cells, fibroblasts, and islet cell lines of different phenotypes indicate that cis-acting DNA elements promote glucagon gene transcription only in islet cell lines. Transcriptional activity was much higher in glucagon compared to insulin-producing islet cell lines with fusion genes containing 249 or more base pairs of glucagon 5'-flanking sequence. Deletion of DNA sequences upstream of -168 abolished the preferential expression in glucagon-producing cell lines, however glucagon-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase fusion genes containing 168 base pairs or more of 5'-flanking sequence remained transcriptionally active, but only in islet cell lines. Fusion genes containing 115 base pairs of glucagon gene 5'-flanking sequences were transcriptionally inactive. These studies indicate that cis-acting DNA sequences present in the 5'-flanking region of the rat glucagon gene mediate islet cell-specific gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1509673785,"Sickle erythrocytes are known to undergo excessive auto-oxidation, resulting in the generation of increased intracellular levels of several species of free radical oxidants. This environment is likely to enhance the accumulation of oxidative lesions by membrane components, although, as yet, this has been shown directly only for the sickle membrane phospholipids. We examined the oxidative status of protein 4.1, a major component of the human erythrocyte protein skeleton. We found that protein 4.1 isolated from sickle erythrocytes bound approximately 4-fold less to protein 4.1-stripped membranes than did the normal protein. The binding defect was inherent in the sickle protein and not in its membrane-binding site(s) since normal protein 4.1 bound to sickle protein 4.1-stripped inside-out vesicles similar to normal protein 4.1-stripped inside-out vesicles. Sickle membranes, in particular spectrin-depleted inside-out vesicles, contained less protein 4.1 than normal membranes. Purified sickle protein 4.1 contained 20-40% high molecular weight aggregated protein (Mr greater than 200,000), whereas the purified normal protein contained approximately 10% high molecular weight protein. The high molecular weight protein was immunoreactive with antibodies to protein 4.1 but not with antibodies to spectrin, ankyrin, band 3, glycophorin, or hemoglobin, suggesting that the high molecular weight protein was cross-linked protein 4.1 and not a complex of protein 4.1 and some other membrane protein(s). Purified sickle protein 4.1 was eluted from an anion-exchange resin at a higher salt concentration than normal protein 4.1. Oxidizing normal protein 4.1 with diamide resulted in an anion-exchange elution pattern similar to the sickle protein, suggesting that oxidation can affect protein surface charge. Activated thiol beads bound one-half as much sickle protein 4.1 as normal protein 4.1 when both were solubilized directly from membranes, demonstrating that thiol oxidation had occurred in vivo. Direct quantification of protein thiols revealed that the sickle protein contained 1-2 mol% fewer cysteines/protein 4.1 monomer than did the normal protein. By amino acid analysis, sickle protein 4.1 was found to contain less methionine and tyrosine than did the normal protein and contained approximately 1 mol% cysteic acid, whereas the normal protein did not contain any cysteic acid. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that sickle protein 4.1 has sustained oxidative damage in vivo. This damage can alter the functional properties of the sickle protein and may be an underlying factor in the myriad of membrane abnormalities reported in sickle erythrocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1548321971,"Abstract The interaction of protein substrates with protease La from Escherichia coli enhances its ability to hydrolyze ATP and peptide bonds. These studies were undertaken to clarify how unfolded proteins allosterically stimulate this ATPase activity. The tetrameric protease can bind four molecules of ATP, which activates proteolysis, or four molecules of ADP, which inhibits enzymatic activity. Protein substrates stimulate binding of the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog [3H] adenyl-5'yl imidodiphosphate, although they do not increase the net binding of [3H]ATP or [3H]ADP. Once bound, ATP is quickly hydrolyzed to ADP, which remains noncovalently associated with protease La even through repeated gel filtrations. Exposure to protein substrates (e.g. denatured bovine serum albumin at 37 degrees C) induces the release of all the bound ADP from the enzyme. Nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs bound to the enzyme were not released by these substrates. Proteins that are not degraded (e.g. native bovine serum albumin) and oligopeptides that only bind to the catalytic site do not induce ADP release. Thus, polypeptide substrates have to interact with an allosteric site to induce this effect. The protein-induced ADP release is inhibited by high concentrations of Mg2+ and is highly temperature-dependent. Protein substrates promoted [3H]ATP binding in the presence of ADP and Mg2+ (i.e. ATP-ADP exchange) and reduced the ability of ADP to inhibit the enzyme's peptidase and ATPase activities. These results indicate that: 1) ADP release is a rate-limiting step in protease La function; 2) bound ADP molecules inhibit protein and ATP hydrolysis in vivo; 3) denatured proteins interact with the enzyme's regulatory site and promote ADP release, ATP binding, and their own hydrolysis."
https://openalex.org/W2398222685,"The glpR gene encoding the repressor for the sn-glycerol 3-phosphate regulon of Escherichia coli was cloned downstream from the strong pL promoter of bacteriophage lambda. This allowed overproduction of the repressor upon thermal induction of a cryptic lambda lysogen harboring the cI857 gene. The repressor was purified 40-fold to homogeneity from an induced strain. The purification scheme utilized polyethyleneimine and ammonium sulfate fractionation, followed by phosphocellulose and DEAE-Sephadex chromatography. Purification was monitored by measuring the binding of radiolabeled inducer (sn-glycerol 3-phosphate) to the repressor. The purified repressor migrated as a single band exhibiting a subunit molecular weight of 30,000 assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The molecular weight of the repressor under nondenaturing conditions was 100,000-130,000 suggesting the repressor is a tetramer under native conditions. Interaction of the repressor with sn-glycerol 3-phosphate was studied using flow dialysis. Scatchard analysis of the data indicated four binding sites/repressor tetramer and a dissociation constant of 31 microM. Interaction of the repressor with DNA was studied using band-shift electrophoresis. The repressor specifically bound DNA fragments containing the control regions for the glpD, glpK, and glpT-A genes. Binding of DNA by the repressor was diminished in the presence of sn-glycerol 3-phosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1503809906,"A critical enzyme in protein breakdown in Escherichia coli is the ATP-hydrolyzing protease La, the lon gene product. In order to clarify the role of ATP in proteolysis, we studied ATP and ADP binding to this enzyme using rapid gel filtration to separate free from bound ligands. In the presence of Mg2+ or Mn2+ and 10 microM ATP, two molecules of ATP were bound to the tetrameric enzyme, while at 100 microM ATP (or higher), four ATP molecules were bound, both at 0 and 37 degrees C. Protease La thus has two high affinity sites (S0.5 less than 10(-7) M) for ATP and two lower affinity sites (S0.5 = 12-15 microM). Binding was reversible. In the absence of a divalent ion, ATP bound to only two sites. However, much lower Mg2+ concentrations (50 microM) were required for maximal ATPase binding than for maximal proteolytic and ATPase activity (2 mM). Decavanadate, which is a potent inhibitor of proteolysis, also blocked ATP binding, but orthovanadate had neither effect. Different ATP analogs bind to these sites in distinct ways. Adenyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate binds to only one high affinity site, while adenyl-5'-yl methylene monophosphonate binds to two. Nevertheless, both non-metabolizable analogs can activate oligopeptide hydrolysis as well as ATP. Although binding of a single nucleotide can activate peptide hydrolysis, occupancy of all four sites appears necessary for maximal protein breakdown. The ATP molecules on all four sites are hydrolyzed rapidly. The Pi is released, but ADP remains on the enzyme. ADP binds to the same four sites, but this process does not require divalent ions. Protease La shows higher affinity for ADP than for ATP. Therefore, in vivo, ADP should inhibit ATP binding and protease La function."

The parasite hexokinase has a lower affinity for glucose than the mammalian enzyme (Km = 431 microM +/- 21 S.D. for the parasite enzyme versus 98 microM +/- 10 for the erythrocyte enzyme), but the Km for ATP and the Vmax for both glucose and ATP are similar. The NADPH-dependent reduction of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) requires the formation of glucose 6-phosphate which in turn is metabolized by the pentose shunt pathway in which NADPH is generated. Using glucose as the substrate, lysates of P. falciparum-infected normal erythrocytes demonstrated enhanced ability to reduce GSSG. The rate of GSSG reduction was proportional both to the parasitemia and the hexokinase activity of the lysates. However, infected glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase-deficient red cell lysates displayed a severely restricted ability to reduce GSSG under the same conditions. In conclusion, P. falciparum-infected red cells contain a parasite-encoded hexokinase with unique properties which initiates the large increase in glucose consumption. In normal infected red cells, reduction of GSSG is also dependent upon hexokinase activity, but in infected glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase-deficient red cells, the absence of this pentose shunt enzyme remains the rate-limiting step in GSSG reduction."
https://openalex.org/W1523268511,"We have placed the PHR1 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae under the transcriptional and translational control of the tac expression cartridge. Under inducing conditions Escherichia coli cells harboring plasmids carrying this construct accumulate approximately 8% of total cellular protein as the Phr1 photolyase. Using a strain devoid of E. coli photolyase activity, we have obtained milligram quantities of the yeast enzyme at greater than 95% purity and have characterized the enzyme. Phr1 photolyase is a monomer in solution with an Mr of 60,000, has a turnover number of 0.7 dimers min-1 molecule-1 in vitro, exhibits absorbance maxima at lambda = 277 and 377 nm, and has a fluorescence excitation maximum at 390 nm and an emission maximum at 475 nm. The near UV absorbance peak is shown to reflect the contributions of two intrinsic chromophores which are noncovalently bound to the enzyme. Spectroscopic, fluorescence, and thin layer chromatographic studies indicate that one of these chromophores is 1,5-reduced FAD rather than 4a,5-reduced FAD as previously proposed (Iwatsuki, N., Joe, C. O., and Werbin, H. (1980) Biochemistry 19, 1172-1176), while the other chromophore has properties similar to the second chromophore of E. coli photolyase. The fact that yeast and E. coli photolyases are similar both with respect to amino acid sequence and chromophore composition provides strong evidence that the enzymes share a common action mechanism which may also be utilized by photolyases from other organisms throughout the phylogenetic tree."
https://openalex.org/W128760725,"A kinetic mechanism is presented for Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase which describes the full time course of the enzymatic reaction over a wide range of substrate and enzyme concentrations at pH 7.2 and 20 degrees C. Specific rate constants were estimated by computer simulation of the full time course of single turnover, burst, and steady-state experiments using both nondeuterated and deuterated NADPH. The mechanism involves the random addition of substrates, but the substrates and enzyme are not at equilibrium prior to the chemical transformation step. The rate-limiting step follows the chemical transformation, and the maximum velocity of the reaction is limited by the release of the product tetrahydrofolate. The full time course of the reaction is markedly affected by the formation of the enzyme-NADPH-tetrahydrofolate abortive complex, but not by the enzyme-NADP-dihydrofolate abortive complex."
https://openalex.org/W1501439526,"Addition of isoproterenol to isolated rat adipocytes prelabeled with [32P]phosphate caused an increase in the phosphorylation and activation of phospholipid methyltransferase. 32P-Labeled phospholipid methyltransferase was recovered by immunoprecipitation and gel electrophoresis. Analysis of 32P-labeled peptides revealed one site of phosphorylation regulated by isoproterenol, and analysis of phosphoamino acids demonstrated that the incorporation of [32P]phosphate was on phosphoserine. Incubation of adipocytes with isoproterenol in the presence of insulin or a phospho-oligosaccharide inhibited the phosphorylation and activation of this enzyme. The inhibitory effect of insulin on the phosphorylation of phospholipid methyltransferase was reversible, and it was mimicked by a phospho-oligosaccharide. The phospho-oligosaccharide was generated by hydrolysis of an isolated glycophospholipid with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C from Staphylococcus aureus. The insulin-like effect of this phospho-oligosaccharide on the phosphorylation of phospholipid methyltransferase was demonstrated in isolated adipocytes, and the effect was abolished by treatment of the phospho-oligosaccharide with 10% NH4OH, nitrous acid, or sodium periodate. These data suggest that in intact adipocytes the effect of insulin to inhibit the phosphorylation/activation of phospholipid methyltransferase is mediated by a phospho-oligosaccharide generated by a phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C."
https://openalex.org/W1515198637,"Using isotopic equilibration with [3H]D-glucose and measurement of D-glucose inhibitable cytochalasin B binding, I show that the erythrocytes of embryonic and newborn rats contain D-glucose transporters. On the basis of cytochalasin B binding and the time course of isotopic exchange, the number of transporters in rat embryonic erythrocytes is only 5% of that in human erythrocytes. Antibodies raised against the human erythrocyte glucose transporter were used as a probe to investigate the structural similarity between transporters. On this basis, the polypeptides of the glucose transporter of human erythrocytes and of embryonic rat erythrocytes are similar but not identical; in addition, certain antibodies showed similar reactivity toward the transporter of rat embryonic erythrocytes and that of rat brain. These antibodies, however, react with brain transporters 5 to 10 times better than with those of skeletal muscle and adipocytes suggesting that insulin responsive tissues may have a different type of glucose transporter. The cellular location of glucose transporters in skeletal muscle, determined by immunofluorescence, is on the plasma membrane or very close to the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1990764206,"We have investigated the function of an E. coli aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase in S. cerevisiae strains that are respiration-deficient because of a mutation or a gene disruption in the nuclear encoded gene for the mitochondrial tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase. Although the yeast mitochondrial and E. coli tyrosine tRNAs differ significantly in sequence, expression of the E. coli tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase from a gene fusion restores respiration. The fusion gene contains a presumptive sequence for mitochondrial import from the mitochondrial tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase gene fused to the E. coli coding region. The fusion protein is incorporated into mitochondria. This incorporation and the rescue of the respiratory defect require the presumptive sequence for mitochondrial import. These experiments suggest a more limited definition of the identify of a tyrosine tRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1604325682,"Abstract A Mr = 110,000 glycoprotein, GP 110, was partially purified using wheat germ agglutinin-Sepharose affinity chromatography from a bile canalicular-enriched membrane fraction denoted N2u of rat liver. This fraction was subjected to preparative sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the Mr = 110,000 polypeptide was excised and used as an immunogen in rabbits. The antisera were found to specifically recognize a Mr = 110,000 polypeptide, named GP 110, in the N2u membrane fraction. In isolated hepatocytes, GP 110 was readily accessible to cell surface iodination catalyzed by lactoperoxidase at 4 degrees C and was judged by immunoprecipitation studies to contain about 2% of total radioactivity incorporated into externally oriented proteins of the cell. Immunoprecipitated GP 110 was shown by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to migrate with an approximate pI of 4.9. Indirect immunofluorescence on frozen liver sections demonstrated that GP 110 was primarily localized in the bile canaliculus. In corroborative studies employing subcellular fractionation, it was found that GP 110 was enriched nearly 19-fold in P2, a plasma membrane fraction primarily derived from the sinusoidal domain, and 44-fold in N2u. In contrast, only low levels of GP 110 were present in endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondrial, cytosolic, and nuclear-enriched fractions of liver. The physiological function of GP 110 is as yet unknown; antisera to it did not immunoprecipitate other known bile canalicular proteins of similar molecular weights. GP 110 was found to be extensively glycosylated relative to other known membrane proteins; approximately 33% of the apparent molecular weight appear to be carbohydrate. In agreement, limited removal of N-linked carbohydrate chains indicated that there are approximately eight chains/GP 110 polypeptide. Neuraminidase treatment of GP 110 resulted in a desialylated Mr = 85,000 polypeptide suggesting that the majority of carbohydrate chains on GP 110 are of the complex type."
https://openalex.org/W1560540551,"Chromatin in the regions between the upstream activator sequence and the 5' ends of the yeast GAL1 and GAL10 genes has been analyzed by DNase I chromosomal footprinting and micrococcal nuclease digestion using the indirect end-labeling approach. Comparison of wild type chromatin digests to naked DNA digests shows that there are specific regions of these upstream sequences which are strongly protected in chromatin. Comparison to chromatin digests from cells disrupted for the positive regulatory gene, GAL4, or the negative regulatory gene, GAL80, and thus lacking GAL4 or GAL80 function, shows that these regions of protection in wild type chromatin are GAL80-dependent but not GAL4-dependent. The protected regions include DNA lying on (GAL10) or near (GAL1) the respective TATA boxes. These protections are present in both noninduced and induced cells. Both DNA strands are equally protected. Upstream of GAL1 there is a second protected region. This protection shows considerable expression and strand dependence. These observations provide the first evidence that the GAL80 function influences chromatin structure and suggest possible mechanisms by which GAL80 modulates the GAL1 and 10 promoters in induced cells. Micrococcal nuclease digests also suggest a role for GAL80 in a distinctive higher order organization of the intergenic region, perhaps involving multiprotein complexes."
https://openalex.org/W1587368969,"Abstract ATP or adenosine (1 mM) added to extracellular buffer abolished both chloroquine- and monensin-dependent accumulation of [125I]iodoinsulin in isolated rat adipocytes. The effects of ATP were not secondary to its conversion to adenosine and were mimicked by beta, gamma-methyleneadenosine 5'-triphosphate. ATP, but not adenosine, partially inhibited the binding of insulin to the cellular receptor. Neither ATP nor adenosine had any significant effect on both internalization of cell-bound insulin and externalization of the internalized hormone. The degradation of cell-bound insulin was reduced to a considerable extent by both 0.1 mM chloroquine and 5 mM ATP, to a lesser degree by 1 mM ATP, and not significantly by 1 or 5 mM adenosine. Physiologically, (a) 1 mM ATP had a strong, while 1 mM adenosine had a mild inhibitory effect on the insulin-stimulated glucose transport without affecting its basal activity, (b) both ATP and adenosine moderately stimulated basal as well as insulin-stimulated glycogen synthase, and (c) ATP, but not adenosine, transiently stimulated basal cAMP phosphodiesterase without affecting the insulin-stimulated enzyme. Phosphodiesterase in cells that had been exposed to ATP for 30 min was refractory to ATP added afresh, but not to insulin. These data suggest that (a) extracellular ATP may block the degradative pathway of insulin processing, (b) adenosine might render the ordinarily irreversible intracellular traffic of insulin reversible or modulate a pathway which is yet to be identified, (c) the previously reported effect of ATP on glycogen synthase may not involve phosphorylation, (d) ATP stimulates cAMP phosphodiesterase by a mechanism which is distinct from that of insulin, and (e) the degradative pathway of insulin processing may not be involved in the physiologic actions of the hormone on glycogen synthase and phosphodiesterase."
https://openalex.org/W1575293997,"Abstract An Escherichia coli virus T1-induced DNA methyltransferase was identified by activity gel analysis in homogenates of infected E. coli DNA-adenine-methylation-deficient strains. Although the Mr of this protein (31,000) is in the same range as that of the E. coli DNA adenine methyltransferase, the two proteins are not closely related; the E. coli dam gene does not hybridize with T1 DNA. Selective conditions for measurement of the T1 activity were developed, and the enzyme was purified to functional homogeneity, as shown by activity analysis in polyacrylamide gels. Requirements for optimal activity of the viral enzyme were determined to be pH 6.9, ionic strengths below 0.1 M KCl, and a temperature between 40 and 43 degrees C. The Km for S-adenosyl-L-methionine is 4.9 microM. The purified T1 DNA methyltransferase is capable of methylating adenine in 5'-GATC-3' sites in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2105100356,"For the first time, the enzyme rhodanese has been proteolytically cleaved to give species that most likely correspond to individual domains. This indicates cleavage can occur in the interdomain tether. Further, the conditions for cleavage show that availability of the susceptible bond(s) depends on conformational changes triggered by oxidative inactivation. Rhodanese, without persulfide sulfur (E), was oxidized consequent to incubation with phenylglyoxal, NADH, or hydrogen peroxide. The oxidized enzyme (Eox) was probed using the proteolytic enzymes endoproteinase glutamate C (V8), trypsin, chymotrypsin, or subtilisin. The proteolytic susceptibility of Eox, formed using hydrogen peroxide, was compared with that of E and the form of the enzyme containing transferred sulfur, ES. ES was totally refractory to proteolysis, while E was only clipped to a small extent by trypsin or V8 and not at all by chymotrypsin or subtilisin. Eox was susceptible to proteolysis by all the proteases used, and, although there were some differences among the proteolytic patterns, there was always a band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis corresponding to Mr = 16,500. This was the only band observed in addition to the parent species (Mr = 33,000) when Eox was digested with chymotrypsin, and conservation of total protein was observed after digestion up to 90 min. No additional species were observable on silver staining, although there was some indication that the band at 16,500 might be a doublet. The results are consistent with the occurrence of a conformational change after oxidation that results in increased exposure and/or flexibility of the interdomain tether which contains residues that meet the specificity requirements of the proteases used."
https://openalex.org/W1573436802,The chromosomal mes 1 mutation appears to elevate the Km of methionine for yeast methionyl-tRNA synthetase. The mutation was cloned on a multicopy plasmid by gap repair of a plasmid bearing the wild type MES1 gene for a fragment corresponding to the mes 1 mutation. DNA sequencing established that the mutation consists of a single conversion of guanine into adenine which results in the replacement of a glycine by an aspartic acid at position 502. This causes the enzyme to be labile and inactive in vitro and to show a requirement for high concentrations of methionine in vivo. The mutation is in the COOH-terminal domain of the mononucleotide binding fold of the yeast enzyme and suggests participation of this region in the binding of the amino acid residue.
https://openalex.org/W1499401784,"Abstract Rat cellular retinol-binding protein II (CRBP II) is a member of a family of cytoplasmic proteins which bind hydrophobic ligands. CRBP II is thought to participate in the intestinal absorption and intracellular metabolism of retinoids. We have previously described the crystallization of a homologous rat intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (I-FABP) isolated from Escherichia coli containing a suitably constructed prokaryotic expression vector (Sacchettini, J. C., Meininger, T. A., Lowe, J. B., Gordon, J. I., and Banaszak, L. J., J. Biol. Chem. 262, 5428-5430). We have now efficiently expressed rat CRBP II in E. coli. The E. coli-derived protein, which does not contain any bound retinoid, has been purified and crystals grown from solutions of polyethylene glycol 4000. Crystals of apo-CRBP II are triclinic, space group P1, a = 36.8 A, b = 64.0 A, c = 30.4 A; alpha = 92.8 degrees, beta = 113.5 degrees, gamma = 90.1 degrees. Each unit cell contains two molecules of the 134-residue apoprotein. X-ray diffraction data suggest that the unit cell parameters of crystalline apo-CRBP II resemble those of I-FABP. Comparison of the tertiary structures of E. coli-derived rat I-FABP and CRBP II should provide insights about how these proteins evolved to bind different hydrophobic ligands."
https://openalex.org/W2333124839,"Enzyme I of the bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate: glycose phosphotransferase system has 2 tryptophan residues/monomer, as determined spectrophotometrically. The tryptophan fluorescence has been investigated with the aid of nanosecond time-resolved techniques. The decay of the fluorescence intensity was analyzed in terms of a biexponential function. The contribution of the emission associated with the shorter decay constant increases from 17-19% at 1 degree C to 43-44% at room temperature. Decay-associated spectra obtained with Enzyme I indicate different spectral distributions associated with the two decay constants. The measurement of tumbling of Enzyme I as a function of temperature revealed a transition of rotational rates between 5 and 15.5 degrees C. Global analysis allowed decomposition of the anisotropy decay into a formulation consistent with monomer and dimer rotational contributions."
https://openalex.org/W1492371545,"Tumor antigen (T-antigen) of simian virus 40 (SV40) has been shown to have a number of regulatory roles in both viral replication and early viral transcription. However, the nature of its role on late viral transcription remains unclear. We have analyzed for the presence of T-antigen on SV40 late viral transcription complexes which exhibit RNA polymerase II extension activity in vitro. Nuclear extract or glycerol gradient-isolated transcription complexes were treated with either polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies, and the amount of extension activity that could be immunoprecipitated was determined. Anti-T antibody derived from hamster ascites as well as the anti-T monoclonal antibodies PAb 102, 109, 416, and 419 all precipitated 12-29% of viral transcription complex activity. Immunoprecipitation resulted in significant enrichment of transcription complex activity relative to bulk minichromosomes, indicating a preferential association of T-antigen with the late viral transcription complex. This is the first direct demonstration of the presence of T-antigen on the SV40 late transcription complex. Furthermore, the immunoprecipitated transcription complexes exhibited a salt dependence of their in vitro extension activity which was distinct from that of the total complex population, indicating that T-antigen is present on a specific subclass of transcription complexes."
https://openalex.org/W1572077236,"The influence of negative supercoiling and of flanking (dC-dG) tracts in either right-handed B- or left-handed Z-structures on the interaction of the Escherichia coli lac repressor was investigated. The operator was embodied within the lac control sequence, which was 95, 59, or 29 base pairs in length. Thus, the (dC-dG) regions (in either B- or Z-conformations) were at different distances from the repressor-binding site. Surprisingly, the presence of the promoter sequence (-59 to -20 relative to the +1 transcription start site) of the lac operator region increases the binding affinity of lactose repressor to the operator at high negative supercoil densities. This influence of the promoter region on the binding was abolished when the flanking (dC-dG) tracts were in the left-handed Z-DNA conformation. In contrast, minimal differences in the binding affinities were observed between plasmids containing shorter operator fragments (59 or 29 base pairs), whether the flanking (dC-dG) tracts were in right-handed B- or left-handed Z-forms. The promoter region may be directly involved in the repressor-operator complex in a previously unrecognized manner or may exert structural influence on the operator region. In general, increasing the amount of negative supercoiling increases the binding affinity and decreases the dissociation rate constants for the three operator-containing fragments, both with and without flanking Z-DNA tracts. Thus, the lac operator region possesses a previously unrecognized structural pliability, as influenced by negative supercoiling and neighboring sequences and/or conformations, which modulates its biological properties."
https://openalex.org/W1540570401,"We have previously reported the identification and characterization of two related human cell surface protein complexes, very common antigens 1 and 2 (VCA-1, VCA-2) (Kantor, R. R. S., Mattes, M. J., Lloyd, K. O., Old, L. J., and Albino, A. P. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 15158-15165). We now report the transfection of DNA sequences encoding the 170-kilodalton heterodimer of VCA-2 from human SK-RC-41 renal cancer cells to B78H1 mouse melanoma cells. B78H1 cells were cotransfected with high molecular weight renal cancer DNA and a plasmid vector containing the neomycin resistance gene. Antibiotic-resistant transfectants were screened for the expression of the 170-kDa heterodimer with mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) J143. Analysis of mAb J143-positive (J143+) transfectants showed that they expressed a 170-kDa heterodimer with an identical molecular weight, isoelectric point, two-dimensional peptide map, and spatial orientation of surface-exposed epitopes to the homologous 170-kDa species seen in human donor cells. The 170-kDa heterodimer in SK-RC-41 cells is associated with a 140-kDa (designated 140(1] polypeptide to form the VCA-2 complex. The 170-kDa complex and the 140(1)-kDa polypeptides are encoded by genes located on different human chromosomes. J143+ transfectants display a molecule of 140 kDa associated with the 170-kDa complex which is biochemically similar, but non-identical, to the human 140(1)-kDa polypeptide on VCA-2. This evidence supports our interpretation that the transfected human 170-kDa heterodimer associates with a murine counterpart of the human 140(1)-kDa polypeptide in J143+ transfectants."
