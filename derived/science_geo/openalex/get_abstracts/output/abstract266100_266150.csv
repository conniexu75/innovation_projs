Small doses produced some increases in response rates and a consistent decline in shocks received. Larger doses produced progressive uncoordination, accompanied by lower response rates and an increase in shocks received."

Pollen of Zea mays appears in each, substantiating previous early records of agriculture in the American Southwest. Prehistoric cultivation extended through at least 2000 years, ending in the late 15th century."

The creative and pragmatic spirit demonstrated by the Chinese government in these reforms has won enthusiastic support of the Chinese people and aroused keen interest of statesmen, economists, and scientists the world over. The four previously established special economic zones, the opening up of 14 coastal cities and Hainan Island to foreign investment, and the smooth settlement of the Hong Kong issue by means of ""one country, two systems"" have brought new splendor to China's reforms. Many people in the press regard the decision of ""one country, two systems"" as the most courageous and fascinating creation of the 20th century."

https://openalex.org/W2002689835,Two representative anabolic steroids caused an increase in the uptake of Î±-aminoisobutyric acid-1-C14 in the levator ani muscle of rats. The distribution ratio between that muscle and the plasma was increased fourfold by the administration of a synthetic anabolic steroid and twofold by administration of testosterone propionate. The determination of this increase may serve as an indicator for the myotrophic effect of anabolic steroids.

Assays were performed on the dwarf crayfish, Cambarellus shufeldti. Thesignificance of these findings is discussed in relation to endocrine regulation of pigmentary effectors in crayfishes."
