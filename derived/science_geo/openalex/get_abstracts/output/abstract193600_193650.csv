We would suggest that this is not an isolated effect but is an example of a widespread non-specific action of high molecular weight polyelectrolytes on many enzymes."

https://openalex.org/W1540787946,"Methods for the detervination of xanthine oxidase (X0) activity include (a) study of the reduction of suitable hydrogen acceptors such as oxygen (l), methylene blue (2), and cytochrome c (3), and (b) study of the disappearence of substrate (4) or the appearance of the end-product, uric acid (5). The manometric procedure has, however, been the method of choice, but is limited in its application to the determination, of liver X0 activity owing to the high rate of oxygen consumption in the absence of substrate. In the method of Axelrod and Elvehjem (1) this endogenous respiration is largely suppressed by incubating the liver homogenate for 40 minutes prior to tipping in xanthine. However, in many experiments a large endogenous respiration is encountered which entails incubation for longer periods before linear oxidation of xanthine substrate is attained. Also, with protein-depleted animals, the method gives some anomalous results, a number of “zero” livers being found. This is attributed to the inhibitory effect of an excess of substrate on the small amount of enzyme already saturated with endogenous substrate. Removal of the endogenous substrate from the homogenate by dialysis gives positive X0 activity in these cases. It has been suggested that the respiration in the endogenous flask could be suppressed by addition of 6-pteridylaldehyde, which specifically inhibits X0, but in tissue homogenates with small X0 activity this inhibitor interferes with other enzyme systems as well (6). Dixon and Elliott (7) have reported that pyrophosphate (PP) inhibits endogenous respiration and has no effect on the reduction of methylene blue by the X0 system. In the course of our studies on the elaboration"

https://openalex.org/W1984176854,"STUDIES of recolonization by fungi and bacteria of soil sterilized, or partially sterilized, by steam or by various fumigants such as formalin, carbon disulphide and chloropicrin have been made by many investigators. A difficulty common to all such investigations has been that of taking samples of the soil in the process of recolonization for plating out and determination of the recolonizing microorganisms. If the soil has been treated in situ in the field, it is necessary to dig profile pits, from the sides of which samples can be taken1. If the soil has been treated in laboratory containers, it may be necessary to sacrifice one container of soil for each series of samples taken, and this makes it impossible to make consecutive observations on the soil in a single container. Furthermore, the disturbance consequent upon removal of soil before taking a sample much increases the likelihood of contamination of the soil samples by adventitious microorganisms. To overcome these difficulties, the ‘soil recolonization tube’, illustrated in Fig. 1, has been designed and found useful in the study of fungal recolonization of sterilized soil. It is proving equally useful for the investigation of soil recolonization by bacteria. By the use of this apparatus, soil samples can be taken with the minimum of labour and of disturbance to the surrounding soil; moreover, successive samples of soil can be taken from a single recolonization tube for an indefinite period, and the succession of recolonizing organisms in space and time can be properly studied."

Dam (personal communication, 1952) has detected such a factor in his experimental work in chickens, and more recently Koller1 described a new factor, deficient in the blood of patients receiving coumarin anticoagulants, and unaffected by vitamin K."

https://openalex.org/W1965659254,"WE have recently found that the decrease of ascorbic acid concentration of rats' adrenals due to epinephrine is smaller in rats to which pituitrin has been administered and in dehydrated rats than in normal rats1. This suggests that the posterior pituitary hormone depresses the adrenal cortical activity. The questions arise, whether the posterior pituitary hormone acts directly on the adrenal or indirectly through the depression of the anterior pituitary secretion, and which fraction of the posterior pituitary hormone, pressor or oxytocic, is responsible for this effect. The present work was undertaken to clarify these points."

https://openalex.org/W2077690264,"IT is generally assumed that bacteria ingested in food or water do not enter the trachea but that all of them pass down the œsophagus. One interesting observation in this respect was made by White and Minett1, who noted that when calves were fed milk containing Mycobacterium tuberculosis primary lesions of tuberculosis were sometimes found in the lungs, indicating that some of the bacteria administered may have been aspirated into the lungs. More direct evidence that this may occur was obtained as a result of some experiments that were designed to trace the route by which Salmonella gallinarum enters the body following its administration to chickens by mouth."
