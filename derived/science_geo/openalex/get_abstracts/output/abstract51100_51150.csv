https://openalex.org/W1541881494,"Since evidence had been published that lysosomes are disrupted by a free radical-like agent produced during the oxidation of NADPH by liver microsomes, the nature of this free radical was investigated. The following data are presented. 1. The oxidation of NADPH by liver microsomes in the presence of ADP and Fe3+ produced a factor with properties of a free radical which caused the lysis of lysosomes. The addition of superoxide dismutase enhanced the lysis. 2. Lysis of lysosomes also was mediated by the oxidation of NADPH by a partially purified NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase. 3. The oxidation of xanthine by xanthine oxidase in the presence of ADP and Fe3+ produced a radical capable of causing lysosomal lysis. Here again superoxide dismutase caused an enhancement of this lysis. 4. It was demonstrated that the superoxide free radical per se was not the agent causing lysis. Evidence is presented that the free radical causing the lysis of the lysosomes is the hydroxyl free radical (OH·). 5. During lysosomal lysis by the OH· radical, peroxidation of the lysosomal lipids was observed as assayed by the formation of malondialdehyde. 6. The mechanisms whereby superoxide and hydroxyl free radicals may be produced and interact with lysosomal membranes are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1598285753,"A method has been described for isolating separately the envelope and thylakoids of chloroplasts. The method makes use of the fact that gentle swelling of intact chloroplasts causes breakage and total detachment of the envelope. The envelope was purified by a sucrose density gradient procedure. The thylakoids and the envelope appeared to be very different in structure. All the activities associated with thylakoids (ferredoxin: NADP+ oxidoreductase, latent Ca2+-dependent ATPase) and the stroma (fructose 1,6-diphosphatase, P-glycolate phosphatase, carbonic anhydrase) were entirely absent in the envelope. NAD(P)H:cytochrome c oxidoreductase activity was found to be negligible in the envelope. Hence, this fraction was essentially free of microsomal and mitochondrial contaminations. Phosphatidylcholine comprised 75% of the total phospholipids and violaxanthin 50% of the total carotenoids in the envelope. Chlorophylls a and b were barely detectable in the envelope. A Mg2+-dependent ATPase, insensitive to N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide was associated with the envelope."

https://openalex.org/W1483260188,"Abstract We have characterized the binding of glyceraldehyde 3phosphate dehydrogenase to isolated human erythrocyte membranes in an effort to establish whether this in vitro association has physiologic significance. At pH 8 and µ = 0.015 m, approximately 2 x 106 glyceraldehyde-3-P dehydrogenase molecules bound reversibly and homogeneously to the inner (but not the outer) membrane surface with an association constant of 1 x 107 m-1. This binding capacity exceeded by roughly 10-fold the cell's glyceraldehyde-3-P dehydrogenase content. Binding diminished with increasing ionic strength and pH, suggesting a strong electrostatic component in the association. Millimolar amounts of certain metabolites also released bound enzyme from the membrane. In contrast, an indifferent strongly basic protein, cytochrome c, lacked specificity in its association with the erythrocyte membrane. That is, binding was relatively weak, occurred at both membrane surfaces, and may have been limited in extent by close packing (i.e. monolayer formation) rather than by a fixed number of binding sites. Cytochrome c showed much stronger association with carboxymethylcellulose than did glyceraldehyde-3-P dehydrogenase, but was more readily eluted from the membrane by electrolytes. Cytochrome c binding to membranes was not altered by any metabolite tested. We hypothesize that a fraction of erythrocyte glyceraldehyde-3-P dehydrogenase may be specifically bound to the inner surface of the membrane in vivo in a fashion which is responsive to metabolic and ionic transients."
https://openalex.org/W1955011237,"Abstract The subunit structures of the transglutaminases from human plasma and platelets have been studied by gel filtration, ultracentrifugation, and chemical cross-linking, both in the presence and absence of the catalytically essential metal ion, Ca2+. The plasma enzyme in the absence of Ca2+ is composed of four subunits and may be designated (a'2b2). This tetrameric structure is similar to that of its zymogen (a2b2), except that the a chains have been proteolytically modified by the activating enzyme, thrombin. Addition of Ca2+ causes a reversible dissociation of the plasma enzyme molecule into a catalytic dimer (a'2) and a noncatalytic dimer (b2). The platelet enzyme with or without Ca2+ exists as a catalytic dimer (a'2) derived by thrombin activation from its two-subunit zymogen (a2). Isolated b2 from plasma enzyme may be combined with platelet enzyme in the absence of Ca2+ to give a four-subunit molecule indistinguishable from the plasma enzyme. This supports earlier evidence that the catalytic chains of plasma zymogen are very similar or identical with those of platelet zymogen. Each of the plasma protransglutaminase a chains contains six —SH groups and no disulfide bonds; each of its b chains has 16 or 17 intramolecular disulfide bonds and no —SH groups. The platelet zymogen contains six —SH groups in each of its a chains. Inactivation of both the plasma and platelet enzymes by iodoacetamide occurs only in the presence of Ca2+ and is a result of selective alkylation of a single cysteine —SH group in only one of the catalytic subunits. This finding is consistent with half-of-the-site reactivity for both of the enzymes. The protransglutaminase from platelets (a2) is activated by thrombin at a significantly faster rate than the zymogen from plasma (a2b2). A proenzyme prepared by combining the isolated b chain dimer from plasma enzyme with the platelet zymogen was found to be activated by thrombin at the same rate as the plasma zymogen."

https://openalex.org/W1599725095,"Abstract NADPH-sulfite reductase (EC 1.8.1.2) from Escherichia coli is a complex hemoflavoprotein, molecular weight 670,000, containing 4 FMN, 4 FAD, 20 to 21 atoms of iron, 14 to 15 labile sulfides, and 3 to 4 molecules of a novel type of heme per enzyme molecule. This heme has been identified as an octacarboxylic iron-tetrahydroporphyrin (Murphy, M. J., Siegel, L. M., Kamin, H., and Rosenthal, D. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 2801). The enzyme catalyzes the stoichiometric conversion of sulfite to sulfide at the expense of 3 NADPH. The Km values for sulfite and NADPH are both 4 to 5 µm. Reduced methyl or benzyl viologens can serve as electron donors for sulfite reduction, but NADH cannot. In addition to sulfite reduction, the enzyme catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of a variety of diaphorase acceptors (cytochrome c, ferricyanide, 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol, menadione, FMN, FAD) as well as NADPH oxidase, NADPH-3-acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide phosphate transhydrogenase, NADPH-nitrite and -hydroxylamine reductase and reduced methyl viologen-NADP+ reductase activities. All NADPH-dependent activities examined were competitively inhibited by NADP+. Agents which react with the heme prosthetic group, i.e. CO, cyanide, and arsenite, inhibit the reductions of sulfite, nitrite, and hydroxylamine (with either NADPH or reduced methyl viologen as electron donor), while all other activities are unaffected. Cyanide and CO binding to and CO dissociation from the enzyme (determined spectrophotometrically) parallel the respective development and relief of inhibition of NADPH-sulfite reductase activity. Development of inhibition requires the presence of reductant (NADPH) as well as inhibitor, in accord with the observation that CO, cyanide, or arsenite can react with reduced, but not oxidized enzyme. Treatment of enzyme with 1 µm p-chloromercuriphenylsulfonate causes the dissociation of virtually all of the FMN while permitting retention of FAD and heme. This treatment inhibits all pyridine nucleotide-dependent reactions of the enzyme except transhydrogenase and FMN reductase. The methyl viologen-sulfite reductase is unaffected. The development of fluorescence due to FMN release parallels the development of the observed inhibitions. The FAD of the FMN-free enzyme is reducible by NADPH, but the heme is not. If exogenous FMN is added, the heme becomes reducible and all NADPH-dependent activities are restored. We have concluded that electron flow from NADPH to sulfite follows the minimum linear sequence: NADPH → FAD → FMN → heme → sulfite In this scheme, FAD serves as the entry port for electrons from NADPH. It can transfer electrons directly to FMN (internal or external) or to pyridine nucleotides and their analogues. The heme is required for electron transfer to sulfite (and nitrite and hydroxylamine). The FMN is required for electron transfer from the reduced FAD to the heme (and hence to acceptors dependent on the heme) or, more directly, to diaphorase-type acceptors and O2. Reduced methyl viologen can donate electrons to both the FMN and heme. The patterns of inhibition by a variety of salts of the NADPH-cytochrome c and reduced methyl viologen-sulfite reductase reactions are consistent with the hypothesis that these two reactions involve independent portions of the enzyme molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1537487968,"Abstract Methionine sulfoximine was found to be an effective inhibitor of γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase. The data indicate that methionine sulfoximine binds to the glutamate site of the enzyme and that, in the presence of ATP and metal ions (Mg2+ or Mn2+), it is converted to methionine sulfoximine phosphate. Of the four stereoisomers of methionine sulfoximine, only l-methionine-S-sulfoximine inhibits the enzyme; this is the same stereoisomer which inhibits glutamine synthetase and which causes convulsions in mice. Chemically synthesized l-methionine sulfoximine phosphate inhibits the enzyme in the presence of Mg2+ or Mn2+. These findings indicate that the mechanism of inhibition of γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase by methionine sulfoximine is similar to that by which this compound was previously shown to inhibit glutamine synthetase. However, methionine sulfoximine phosphate is less tightly bound to γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase than to glutamine synthetase; thus, under certain conditions methionine sulfoximine phosphate can be released from inhibited γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase with restoration of catalytic activity. The findings are in accord with the view that enzyme-bound γ-glutamyl phosphate is an intermediate in the reaction catalyzed by γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase, and that phosphorylation of methionine sulfoximine by the enzyme reflects the phosphorylation step of the normal catalytic reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1575516480,"Abstract Escherichia coli NADPH-sulfite reductase (EC 1.8.1.2), which catalyzes the 6-electron reduction of sulfite to sulfide, is a complex hemoflavoprotein, molecular weight approximately 700,000, which contains 4 FMN, 4 FAD, 20 to 21 atoms of iron, and 14 to 15 labile sulfides, and 3 to 4 molecules of a novel type of heme per enzyme molecule. This complex structure is composed of only two types of polypeptide chain and has the subunit structure α8β4. α and β each have molecular weights of 54,000 to 60,000, α being slightly larger than β. Sulfite reductase can be dissociated in 5 m urea into a hemoprotein and a flavoprotein component, which can be separated by DEAE-cellulose chromatography. The hemoprotein contains iron, labile sulfide, and the novel sulfite reductase heme, but no flavin. It exists as a β monomer in phosphate buffer, and exhibits reduced methyl viologen-sulfite reductase activity, but no NADPH-dependent activities. The flavoprotein contains FAD and FMN, but no iron, labile sulfide, or heme. It exists as an octamer in phosphate buffer, and exhibits an NADPH-cytochrome c reductase activity (as well as NADPH oxidase, transhydrogenase, and a variety of diaphorase-type activities characteristic of the sulfite reductase holoenzyme), but no NADPH- or reduced methyl viologen-sulfite reductase activity. By mixing the isolated hemoprotein and flavoprotein components in appropriate proportions, an NADPH-sulfite reductase activity can be reconstituted in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1504344268,"Abstract Homogenates of pigeon heart, brain, lung, liver, and the formed elements of blood and of monkey brain, liver, spleen, kidney, lung, uterus, heart, and the formed elements of blood contain an enzyme which catalyzes the reduction of the 9-keto group of prostaglandin E to form prostaglandin F. The prostaglandin E 9-ketoreductase in all of these tissues uses NADPH much more effectively than NADH and is found in the cytoplasmic fraction. In monkey liver, there is a second prostaglandin 9-ketoreductase, which is present in the microsomal fraction and uses NADH much more efficiently than NADPH. The activities of the prostaglandin 9-ketoreductases are extremely sensitive to the oxidized cofactors, and in vivo may be regulated by the relative concentrations of reduced and oxidized coenzymes. Such enzyme activities may, in turn, regulate the diverse physiological processes involving these two classes of prostaglandins."

https://openalex.org/W2044739599,The antigen receptor of lymphocytes destined to form antibody appears to have the characteristics of the immunoglobulin produced. Antibody directed against the combining region of this immunoglobulin should interact with the combining region of the cell receptor for the antigen. Purified Lewis rat alloantibody prepared against Brown Norway (BN) rat histocompatibility antigens was used to immunize L x BN F(1) hybrids. The resultant antiserum has anti-receptor activity because (i) it yields precipitin lines in gel diffusion when reacted against the immunizing alloantibody; (ii) it inhibits the hemagglutinin antibody response of Lewis rats to BN histocompatibility antigens; and (iii) it inhibits the local graft-versus-host response of Lewis lymphoid cells against BN antigens. This suggests that antireceptor antibody may inhibit cell-mediated responses as well as antibody responses to histocompatibility antigens and may play a role in the regulation of immune responses to such antigens.

Several minutes are required for this inhibition to take effect, indicating that it is not a step in visual excitation. The activity of the enzyme is sensitive to the concentration of calcium ion in the medium, suggesting that light-induced changes in calcium distribution in the photoreceptor could control guanylate cyclase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1504313580,"Abstract The effect of amino acid starvation on the rate of fatty acid synthesis was examined in stringent (CP 78, rel+) and relaxed (CP 79, rel-) isogenic strains of Escherichia coli (leu-, his-, arg-, thr-, thi-). Rates of incorporation of [U-14C]glucose, [1-14C]acetate, and 3H2O into chloroform-methanol-soluble lipids (g95% phospholipid) were instantly reduced 50 to 60% by leucine starvation of stringent, but not relaxed, cells. That this depressed rate of lipid labeling was not due to leucine starvation-induced diversion of labeled fatty acyls into chloroform-methanol-insoluble form (e.g. lipopolysaccharide, etc.) is indicated by the fact that the rate of labeling from [1-14C]acetate of the lipid extract of saponified cells was decreased to the same extent by leucine deprivation. With leucine-deprived rel+ cells, the rate of [1-14C]acetate incorporation into phosphatidylethanolamine and cardiolipin was more drastically curtailed than into phosphatidylglycerol, while the incorporation pattern in rel- cells (± leucine) was similar to that of nonstarved rel+ cells. An elevated turnover rate of fatty acyl groups due to amino acid starvation cannot account for the decreased rate of lipid labeling by various precursors, since no detectable loss of 14C-activity from fatty acyls labeled during growth or leucine deprivation occurs during subsequent growth or leucine starvation in the presence of unlabeled precursor. Only minor amounts of labeled lipid are secreted by stringent or relaxed cells grown in the presence of [1-14C]acetate; leucine deficiency has no significant effect on the rate of labeling of these extracellular lipids. These results lead to the conclusion that fatty acid synthesis per se is subject to stringent control being partially suppressed, i.e. 50 to 60%, by amino acid starvation in rel+ strains of E. coli. Amino acid starvation of stringent, but not relaxed, strains of E. coli is known to activate ribosomal synthesis of ppGpp and pppGpp. The resultant accumulation of (p)ppGpp appears to mediate stringent control of fatty acid synthesis by blocking the initial committed step of the pathway, i.e. the carboxylation of acetyl-CoA. Of the two catalytic components of the acetyl-CoA carboxylase system, namely biotin carboxylase and carboxyltransferase, only the latter component is inhibited by physiological concentrations (up to 4 mm) of ppGpp. Two carboxyltransferase-catalyzed reactions—(a) carboxyl transfer from malonyl-CoA to the model acceptor, d-biotin methyl ester, and (b) carboxyl carrier protein-dependent malonyl-CoA-[1-14C]acetyl-CoA exchange—are inhibited 50 to 60% at saturating concentrations (1.0 to 1.2 mm) of (p)ppGpp. Inhibition is specific in that GTP, GDP, GMP, ATP, ADP, AMP, and cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate have no effect at comparable concentrations. The binding of Mn2+ by ppGpp was investigated by electron paramagnetic resonance to evaluate the possible metal scavenging effect of the guanosine nucleotide on the metaldependent reactions (i.e. biotin and acetyl-CoA carboxylation) catalyzed by the biotin carboxylase component of acetylCoA carboxylase. Kd values determined at pH 6.8 for the dissociation of Mn2+ from the binary (Mn·ppGpp) and ternary (Mn2·ppGpp) complexes are 1.1 µm and 65 µm, respectively, the former being tighter and the latter an order of magnitude weaker than Mn2+ dissociation from Mn·ATP. Whereas the biotin carboxylase-catalyzed reaction per se (carboxylation of free d-biotin) is not inhibited, 2.5 mm Mn·ppGpp inhibits both acetyl-CoA carboxylation and malonyl-CoA-[1-14C]acetyl-CoA exchange 50 to 60%. These results suggest that stringent control of fatty acid synthesis in E. coli is mediated through the inhibitory action of (p)ppGpp on the carboxyltransferase component of the acetyl-CoA carboxylase system."
https://openalex.org/W1537541495,"Abstract The flavoprotein lactate oxidase (decarboxylating) from Mycobacterium smegmatis catalyzes the formation of two different products from a novel substrate, β-chlorolactate: (a) combined oxidation and decarboxylation to chloroacetate and carbon dioxide (the normal sequence), and (b) intramolecular elimination of the β-chloro group of the substrate to form the keto acid pyruvate. Product composition depends on oxygen. Pyruvate is formed catalytically under anaerobic conditions. Chloroacetate production begins at low levels of oxygen and comprises 70 to 80% of the products at 100% oxygen saturation levels. Oxygen uptake and pyruvate formation are reciprocally related, suggesting a common precursor for the two reaction pathways. The ability of lactate oxidase to catalyze the elimination reaction suggests that catalysis occurs by initial abstraction of the α-hydrogen as a proton, followed by a subsequent 2-electron transfer in oxidation of the substrates. These data are similar to those obtained for reaction of β-chloroamino acid substrates with d- and l-amino acid oxidases (Walsh, C. T., Schonbrunn, A., and Abeles, R. H. (1971) J. Biol. Chem. 246, 6855) and suggest that these three flavoprotein oxidases have similar reaction mechanisms. Evidence for shielding from the solvent of the substratederived α-proton on the enzyme during catalysis was obtained with β-chloro[α-3H]lactate. During the elimination reaction with this substrate in H2O, 30% of the tritium originally present at the carbon was found in the methyl group (β carbon) of the pyruvate formed. The ability of this flavoprotein oxidase to catalyze such direct hydrogen transfer with β-chlorolactate provides indirect evidence for the formation and then the enzyme-catalyzed ketonization of the enol form of pyruvate at the active site during the elimination reaction. When [α-2H]lactate is used as substrate for lactate oxidase a deuterium kinetic isotope effect of 1.7 is noted; when α-3H substrate is used, there is a selection of 3.2 against tritiated substrate molecules, suggesting some transfer of the α-hydrogen is a slow step during catalysis."

https://openalex.org/W1503317729,"1. A procedure is described for separating from preparations of NADH-ubiquinone reductase (Complex I), an NADH dehydrogenase which retains full activity with ferricyanide as acceptor, but which is devoid of rotenone-sensitive NADH-ubiquinone reductase activity. About 50 to 90% of the original NADH-ubiquinone reductase activity is restored by recombination with purified phospholipids in the presence of cholate, and dialysis for at least 10 hours. Reduction of ubiquinone-1 by this preparation is 80 to 90% inhibited by rotenone. 2. After reconstitution with phospholipids, the preparation reacts with ubiquinone-cytochrome c reductase (Complex III) to give rotenone- and antimycin-sensitive NADH-cytochrome c reductase activity. No activity with Complex III is observed with the preparation either before reconstitution or after dialysis without phospholipids. 3. A modification of the separation procedure leads to a preparation of NADH dehydrogenase exhibiting activity with ferricyanide as acceptor. However, after reconstitution with phospholipids, the rates of rotenone-sensitive NADH-ubiquinone reductase obtained are less than 3% of those in Complex I. The properties of the reconstitutively active and inactive NADH dehydrogenase are compared."
https://openalex.org/W1486243224,"The enzymes of fatty acid synthesis from liver and brain in normal and B12-deprived rats were studied. Both total and specific activities of fatty acid synthetase and acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase were 2- to 5-fold greater in B12 deprivation than in the normal state. The presence of excess activators in the B12-deprived rat or an excess inhibitor in the normal rat was not found by serial admixtures of the respective cytosol preparations or by partial purification of the enzymes. Since B12 deficiency is associated with an increase in the tissue concentrations of propionic and methylmalonic acid, the effect of the coenzyme A derivatives of these acids on fatty acid synthetase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity was studied. Propionyl-CoA was a substrate for fatty acid synthetase, while methylmalonyl-CoA markedly inhibited synthetase activity. Methylmalonyl-CoA markedly inhibited acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity. Propionyl-CoA was shown to be a substrate for acetyl-CoA carboxylase, competing with acetyl-CoA, and the product synthesized was methylmalonyl-CoA. Thus, in vitamin B12 deprivation propionyl-CoA competes with acetyl-CoA as substrate providing a mechanism for odd chain fatty acid production, and its product, methylmalonyl-CoA, may function as an inhibitor of the enzymes of fatty acid synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1506358009,"Abstract After cyanogen bromide digestion of human serum albumin, three fragments, A, B, and C, are obtained. Two different types of affinity columns of Sepharose with l-tryptophan were prepared, one with a free carboxyl group and one with a free amino group. Only Fragment C showed affinity to the Sepharose column with the carboxyl group of tryptophan free, while the column having the amino group free did not extract any fragment from the cyanogen bromide digest. Fragments A, B, and C were separated and studied by circular dichroism. Large parts of the native structure are preserved in the fragments. Human serum albumin contains 45 to 50% α helix, and totally about 35% is found in the fragments. Fragment A contains about 42% α helix and about 15 to 22% β structure, B contains 22 to 26% α helix and 9 to 14% β structure, and C contains 28 to 36% α helix and 11 to 32 % β structure, the significance of which is discussed. The binding of l-tryptophan and drugs to the different fragments was studied by circular dichroism and equilibrium dialysis; only Fragments A and C were found to be active. The apparent association constants, Ka, for the binding of l-[14C]tryptophan at pH 9.0 and 10° were 0.16 x 104 m-1 and 0.17 x 104 m-1 for Fragments A and C, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W1528923179,"Abstract Dexamethasone, insulin, and serum induce an additive increase in the activity of tyrosine aminotransferase (l-tyrosine:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase, EC 2.6.1.5) in hepatoma cells in tissue culture. By the criteria of immunotitration, heat stability, and electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels, we have shown previously that all three effectors increase the cellular concentration of the same protein (Gelehrter, T. D., Emanuel, J. R., Spencer, C. J. (1972) J. Biol. Chem. 247, 6197–6203). During the course of these studies however, we observed an apparent isozyme of tyrosine aminotransferase whose activity is not enhanced by these three inducers. This minor, more cathodal form is also a heat-stable, cytoplasmic enzyme which differs from the major anodal form in net charge but not molecular weight. Unlike the anodal form, however, this enzyme can utilize oxalacetate in place of α-ketoglutarate in the transamination of tyrosine, and can transaminate aspartate as well as tyrosine. A similar, heatstable, cathodal form with these same biochemical properties has also been found in cytoplasmic extracts of adult and fetal rat liver. We have used immunologic criteria to characterize further the apparent heterogeneity of hepatic tyrosine aminotransferase. Incubation of extracts of hepatoma cells, and adult, and fetal rat liver with antiserum to purified rat liver soluble tyrosine aminotransferase inactivates only the anodal enzyme; whereas incubation with antiserum to purified pig heart soluble aspartate aminotransferase (l-aspartate:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase, EC 2.6.1.1) inactivates only the cathodal form. Thus, the latter activity presumably represents cytosol aspartate aminotransferase which, because of its broad substrate specificity for aromatic amino acids, was detected as a pseudoisozyme of tyrosine aminotransferase. These observations stress the need for caution in the interpretation of apparent multiple forms of enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1506935690,"Abstract The short term regulation of fatty acid biosynthesis has been studied using primary cultures of human skin fibroblasts. These cells show rapid changes in rates of acetate incorporation into fatty acids depending upon the lipid content of the medium. When cells are incubated in medium containing lipid-deficient fetal calf serum overnight and then are switched to Eagle's minimum essential medium, the rate of acetate incorporation into fatty acids is unaffected. Addition of 5 µm albumin-bound palmitic, stearic, oleic, linoleic, or arachadonic acids to the minimum essential medium results in a 26 to 67% inhibition in the rate of acetate incorporation depending upon the fatty acid used. These results are obtained when cells are incubated with [1-14C]acetate from 0.5 to 10.5 min after addition of fatty acid to the medium. When cells are labeled from 5 to 15 min after addition of fatty acid, there was a greater inhibition of acetate incorporation to 70 to 85%. Several lines of evidence suggest that the site of action of fatty acids is intracellular. The effect of added fatty acids on the intracellular concentration of citrate, long chain acyl-CoA compounds, and free fatty acids were measured in these cells. Long chain acyl-CoA levels and citrate levels of cells incubated in Eagle's minimum essential medium for 10.5 min are 73.3 ± 2.5 pmoles per mg of total cellular protein and 2.1 ± 0.3 nmoles per mg of total cellular protein, respectively. When albumin-bound palmitic acid at a concentration of 2.1 µm is included in the incubation medium the levels of long chain acyl-CoA compounds (69.0 ± 3.0 pmoles per mg of total cellular protein) and of citrate (1.9 ± 0.1 nmoles per mg of total cellular protein) remain unchanged despite inhibition of acetate incorporation into fatty acid by this time. Furthermore, incubation of cells in medium containing albumin-bound palmitic acid results in only slight increases in the intracellular free fatty acid levels compared to cells incubated in fatty acid-free medium. These results suggest that total cellular levels of these metabolites are not directly responsible for regulation of the rate of acetate incorporation into fatty acids."
https://openalex.org/W1571490147,"Abstract Dihydrofolate reductase, isolated from baby hamster kidney cells by affinity chromatography, gave multiple bands on analytical gel electrophoresis and electrofocusing. The number of bands could be reduced to two by forming a complex with the enzyme inhibitor, methotrexate. The two basic enzyme forms, called Form I and Form II, were obtained in large quantities by preparative disc electrophoresis and analyzed for complex formation, aggregation, conformation, composition, catalytic activity, and interconversion. Each form produced stable and electrophoretically distinguishable complexes with substrate, substrate analogues, cofactor, and oxidized cofactor. The complex formation with the cofactors was accompanied by a change in the conformation. Form I and Form II differed in charge, conformation or size, specific activity, and pH optimum. They were not themselves cofactor complexes, nor was one of them a multimer or aggregate of the other. No interconversion could be shown. Analysis of the tryptic and chymotryptic digests of the two forms failed to show a difference in their amino acid sequence, but a small change in the sequence or certain physical or chemical modifications of the protein would not have been detected. We conclude that the multiple bands of dihydrofolate reductase are due to the presence of two closely related enzyme forms which independently produce stable and distinguishable complexes with the substrate, the cofactor, and the oxidized cofactor."
https://openalex.org/W2438340488,"The full time course of reduced coenzyme oxidation by glutamate dehydrogenase has been measured and the data have been compared with computer-simulated progress curves. It is shown that the oxidation of TPNH, at saturating concentrations of α-ketoglutarate and ammonium ion, follows a relatively simple mechanism but must include the formation of an abortive enzyme-TPN-substrate complex. The progress curve for the oxidation of DPNH is multiphasic and reflects the fact that DPNH may bind to a second site, inducing an isomerization of the enzyme which results in inhibition of the reaction. As a consequence of the fact that this isomerization is relatively slow, the kinetic properties using DPNH as coenzyme are dependent upon enzyme concentration. The rate constants for the induced isomerization and the dissociation constants for the abortive complex formation, for the reduced coenzyme binding to the active site, and for DPNH binding to the second site have been determined from fits of computer-calculated simulation curves to the experimental data."
https://openalex.org/W1558099986,"Abstract Components of the hepatic microsomal P-450 hemoprotein electron transfer system (TPNH-cytochrome c reductase and P-450 hemoprotein) and the microsomal cytochrome b5 electron transfer system (DPNH-cytochrome b5 reductase and cytochrome b5) were solubilized using Triton N-101 and glycerol, and separated using DEAE-cellulose chromatography. Microsomal aniline hydroxylase activity was reconstituted when the TPNH-cytochrome c reductase fractions and the P-450 hemoprotein fraction were combined. Cross-activities of the TPNH reductases and P-450 hemoproteins were obtained with preparations from phenobarbital- and 3-methylcholanthrene-treated rats. The reconstituted aniline hydroxylase system resembled the native system with respect to turnover number, reducibility of the P-450 hemoprotein component with TPNH, and inhibition with carbon monoxide, p-chloromercuribenzoate, and vitamin K3, but differed in its ability to react with type I substrates such as ethylmorphine and aminopyrine."
https://openalex.org/W1591257631,"Abstract The maximum velocity of the reaction catalyzed by the pig heart TPN-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase depends on the basic form of an enzymatic group of pK 5.7. This pK is independent of temperature from 10–30° and increases in 20% ethanol, suggesting the ionization of a carboxyl group. The enzyme is inactivated by incubation at pH 7.0 with 1 -cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinoethyl)-carbodiimide either alone or in the presence of glycine ethyl ester, glycinamide, or glycine. Both the dehydrogenase and decarboxylase functions of the enzyme are affected. The addition of manganous ion and isocitrate or α-ketoglutarate to the incubation mixture produces a striking decrease in the inactivation rate, implying that reaction takes place in the active site. The inactive glycinamide enzyme exhibits a decreased ability to bind manganous ion in the presence of isocitrate, which suggests that the integrity of those amino acid residues susceptible to the carbodiimide and glycinamide are important for the binding of the manganous-isocitrate complex by the enzyme. The most probable sites of reaction of the carbodiimide are tyrosine, cysteine, glutamic and aspartic acids. Inactivation is not reversed by hydroxylamine indicating that tyrosine modification is not responsible; and no significant change in the measurable sulfhydryl content is noted upon inactivation. Treatment of the enzyme with the carbodiimide in the presence of [14C]glycine ethyl ester leads to incorporation of 1 mole of radioactive compound per mole of enzyme, concomitant with inactivation. Exhaustive proteolytic digestion of the radioactive protein followed by paper chromatography and electrophoresis led to the identification of γ-glutamylglycine as the product of the modification reaction. It is concluded that a glutamyl residue is essential for the catalytic function of isocitrate dehydrogenase and may lie within the substrate binding site."
https://openalex.org/W1575847670,"Abstract Escherichia coli NADPH-sulfite reductase (EC 1.8.1.2), molecular weight 670,000, contains 4 FAD, 4 FMN, approximately 16 atoms of non-heme iron-acid-labile sulfide, and 3 to 4 molecules of siroheme per enzyme molecule. NADPH interacts with the flavins, while sulfite interacts with the siroheme component. The sulfite reductase-FMN complex exhibits a dissociation constant (Kdiss) of 10 nm at 25°. All four FMN groups appear to be equivalent. The FAD prosthetic group is bound much more tightly than the FMN. The fluorescence of free FMN is largely quenched when the flavin is enzyme-bound. Sulfite reductase freed of g95% of its FMN while retaining g85% of its FAD was prepared by irradiation of enzyme solutions, in phosphate buffer 30% saturated in ammonium sulfate, with a strong fluorescent light. Such FMN-depleted enzyme preparations can bind FMN with a Kdiss identical with that of the native enzyme. By comparing properties of FMN-depleted enzyme, with and without added FMN, with those of native enzyme, the following conclusions were reached: 1. The FAD prosthetic group of sulfite reductase serves as the sole entry port for electrons of NADPH. Thus, the ability of the enzyme to bind pyridine nucleotide (4.0 [14C]-NADP+ per enzyme molecule; Kdiss = 0.1 mm) and to catalyze electron exchange between pyridine nucleotides (NADPH and 3-acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide phosphate) is unaffected by the presence or absence of the FMN prosthetic group. The FAD moiety of FMN-depleted enzyme is reducible by NADPH. The FAD is reduced as rapidly by NADPH (k = 190 s-1) as is the most rapidly reducible flavin component of the native (FMN-containing) enzyme. 2. The FMN prosthetic group is required for transfer of electrons from NADPH, via the FAD, either to enzyme-bound siroheme, and thence to sulfite, or to the exogenous electron acceptor cytochrome c. The majority of electrons which are transferred from NADPH to the diaphorase-type acceptors 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol, ferricyanide, or menadione by sulfite reductase, pass through an FMN-dependent pathway. The Michaelis constant for FMN-dependent reactivation of the NADPH-cytochrome c reductase activity of enzyme from which FMN has been removed either by irradiation or dilution of the enzyme is 8 to 11 nm, a value in good agreement with the Kdiss of the enzyme-FMN complex. Other flavins, including FAD, can substitute for FMN, although FMN exhibited the smallest Km of all flavins tested. The 5'-phosphate group of FMN appears to be quite important for interaction of the flavin with the enzyme as measured by reactivation of enzymatic activity."
https://openalex.org/W1571702663,"Abstract Kinetic studies have been carried out with microsomal preparations from mouse preputial gland tumors that catalyze (a) the reduction of [1-14C]alkyldihydroxyacetone-P and [1-14C]alkyldihydroxyacetone; (b) the dephosphorylation of [1-14C]alkyldihydroxyacetone-P; and (c) the phosphorylation of [1-14C]alkyldihydroxyacetone. Our data demonstrate the existence of a pathway that permits the interconversion of metabolic intermediary ether-lipid products, i.e. alkyldihydroxyacetone-P, alkylglycerol-P, alkyldihydroxyacetone, and alkylglycerol. The labeled substrates used in these experiments, [1-14C]octadecyldihydroxyacetone-P and [1-14C]-octadecyldihydroxyacetone, were chemically synthesized. Alkyldihydroxyacetone-P is reduced to 1-alkyl-sn-glycerol-3-P by a microsomal reductase that is highly specific for NADPH and optimally active at pH 7.0. However, higher levels of NADH can substitute for the NADPH. The apparent Km for the alkyldihydroxyacetone-P reductase is 0.12 mm for NADPH and 3.2 mm for NADH. In contrast, only NADPH is utilized by the reductase that reduces alkyldihydroxyacetone to the alkylglycerol. With the alkyldihydroxyacetone reductase, the apparent Km for NADPH is 0.38 mm. The phosphatase present in the tumor microsomes is maximally inhibited at NaF concentrations greater than 40 mm; less than 4% of the alkyldihydroxyacetone-P was dephosphorylated during a 5-min incubation under these conditions. However, during longer incubation periods at low concentrations of NaF, significant quantities of alkyldihydroxyacetone and alkylglycerol are produced. In the presence of ATP and Mg2+, alkyldihydroxyacetone is phosphorylated to alkyldihydroxyacetone-P by a kinase in the tumor. The apparent Km for ATP was 3.6 mm. The highest specific activity for the alkyldihydroxyacetone kinase was located in the microsomal fraction. These data demonstrate how alkyldihydroxyacetone can re-enter the pathway responsible for the biosynthesis of complex ether lipids."
https://openalex.org/W1501658852,"Abstract Twelve different lipophilic organic cations (tetraethyl-, tetrapropyl-, tetrabutyl-, tetrapentyl-, tetrahexyl-, tetraheptyl-, decyltrimethyl-, cetyltrimethyl-, and benzyltriethylammonium bromides; and dibenzyldimethylammonium chloride, N-1-dodecylnicotinamide chloride, and cetylpyridinium bromide) depressed respiratory control in rat liver mitochondria. Evaluation of mitochondrial responses in terms of linear free energy processes for the six symmetrical tetraalkylammonium bromides indicated that the NADH dehydrogenase receptor site for inhibitor (diminution of control of glutamate respiration) was more lipophilic than the succinate dehydrogenase receptor site (reduction of control of succinate respiration). (Both receptor activities have been located on the mitochondrial inner membrane by other workers.) Prior incubation of intact mitochondria with a tetraalkylammonium halide up to an hour at 30° did not alter the results. Depression of respiratory control by the symmetrical quaternary ammonium halides, e.g. tetrabutylammonium bromide, occurred by two different mechanisms depending upon inhibitor concentrations: (a) inhibition of phosphorylation at low concentrations of the alkyl bromide and (b) uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation at high concentrations of the alkyl bromide. Depression of respiratory control by the nonsymmetrical organic cations occurred by either inhibition of electron transport, action as an inhibitor of phosphorylating oxidation, or as an uncoupler. The mechanism of inhibition was dependent upon the organic structure of these amphipathic molecules."

The chemical structure of this species has been established as the FAD analogue of 7-methyl-8-hydroxy-isoalloxazine. The proposed structure is confirmed by: (a) chemical synthesis of 7-methyl-8-hydroxy-isoalloxazine models and comparison of their spectral and physical properties with those of the natural chromophore, and (b) photochemical degradation of the N(10)-polyhdroxy side chain of the FMN portion of the isolated coenzyme to yield 7-methyl-8-hydroxy-alloxazine. The synthesis of these models is outlined."
https://openalex.org/W1042425268,"Abstract The metabolism of lipid-soluble drugs and chemicals by the endoplasmic reticulum mixed function oxidase in liver slices or hepatic microsomes, the latter in the presence of mitochondria, was stimulated up to 80% by succinate and was inhibited up to 30% by oxalacetate. When the combined organelles were used, maximal effects were obtained at 4 to 5 times more mitochondrial protein than microsomal protein. Combination of mitochondria with microsomes also caused a supra-additive effect on respiration in the presence of succinate, and an enhanced inhibition of respiration when oxalacetate was present. Respiration by the combined organelles, in the presence of levels of cyanide which inhibit mitochondrial respiration 90%, left respiration 5 times higher than mitochondrial and 8 times higher than microsomal respiration in the presence of succinate. The stimulatory effect of succinate occurred even with a large excess of NADPH, and succinate could not support drug metabolism when NADP was used instead of NADPH, indicating that stimulation is not the result of regeneration of NADPH. Stimulation required direct organelle contact; dilution of liver homogenate or containment of the mitochondria in a dialysis sac prevented the succinate effect. Both succinate and oxalacetate were without effect on NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase in media containing mitochondria plus microsomes, indicating that the control is probably after this step. Both effects were observed, even on addition of NADH to the NADPH-supported reaction, suggesting that the regulation is due to either an alteration of the effectiveness of the input of a second electron or an effect other than provision of reducing equivalents. Electron microscopic examination of liver slices indicated that the mitochondrial control may be due to structural stabilization of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane; during drug metabolism by liver slices, the rough endoplasmic reticulum lost its parallel tubular arrangement and appeared as large, ribosome-studded vesicles. The presence of succinate in the medium caused retention of the tubular shape, and the rough endoplasmic reticulum was oriented around the mitochondria. Oxalacetate, on the other hand, facilitated loss of the tubular shape of the rough endoplasmic reticulum."

https://openalex.org/W166977058,"Abstract The activation of NADH- and NADPH-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase-catalyzed reactions appears to be similar for two structurally different compounds, ADP and any of a series of monocarboxylic l-α-amino acids. ADP and l-leucine have identical effects on a large variety of glutamate dehydrogenase-catalyzed reactions. Transient state studies show that l-leucine increases the rate of release of NADPH from an enzyme-NADPH complex in a manner similar to that of ADP. The dissociation constant for the glutamate dehydrogenase-NADPH complex as measured by difference spectroscopy is increased by leucine, indicating that leucine interferes with this mode of NADPH binding. It is shown that the dissociation constant for this leucine complex which interferes with a mode of NADPH binding is equal to the reported dissociation constant for the binary enzyme-leucine complex. The steady state kinetic activation constant which can be obtained by extrapolation to infinitely dilute substrate concentrations is equal to the dissociation constant of the binary enzyme-leucine complex. Since the tight binding of NADPH measured spectroscopically in the 340 nm region appears to be involved in a rate-limiting step, the mechanism of activation of α-keto-glutarate reduction by ADP and monocarboxylic l-α-amino acids may be to weaken this NADPH binding mode. Although kinetic activation data and the binding interactions with NADPH are similar for ADP and l-leucine, each activator enhances the binding of the other and, together, they have a slightly additive activation. Spectroscopic data presented in this paper indicate that the two types of activators have spatially separate binding sites on the enzyme and interact in a positive manner to enhance the binding of each other (i.e. positive cooperativity)."
https://openalex.org/W1486425848,"Abstract Lactating bovine mammary fatty acid synthetase, the enzyme complex that synthesizes fatty acids from a primer, malonyl-CoA, and TPNH, is shown to have a relatively high crotonyl-CoA reductase activity. Throughout purification to homogeneity the ratio of the reductase to the synthetase activities remains constant and the two activities emerge superimposed on gel filtration. Although the investigation showed that the reductase activity of the enzyme is an inherent property of the enzyme, the pH profiles and the rates of recovery of the two activities of the enzyme by preincubation were not the same. Synthetase gave a bell-shaped pH profile with an optimum at pH 6.8 while the reductase reaction showed maximum activity in the range of pH 7 to 8.5. The reductase activity was influenced by preincubation while the synthetase was not. The crotonyl-CoA reductase reaction requires TPNH as electron donor, but at a 20-fold higher concentration DPNH will substitute for TPNH with 50% Vmax. As a result of the presence of the reductase activity crotonyl-CoA substitutes as a primer in fatty acid synthesis as effectively as butyryl-CoA, a primer decidedly better than acetyl-CoA."

https://openalex.org/W1553834756,"Abstract Glucose transport by membrane vesicles isolated from Azotobacter vinelandii is coupled primarily to malate oxidation via a flavin-linked l-malate dehydrogenase. The addition of flavin adenine dinucleotide is required for malate-dependent glucose transport but is not obligatory for malate oxidation. Both NADH and NADPH are oxidized by the vesicles at rates nearly identical with that of malate yet are only 17% as effective in support of the rate of glucose uptake. Succinate and d-lactate are oxidized at 55 and 20% of the malate rate, respectively. Succinate oxidation does not stimulate glucose transport while d-lactate is 18% as effective as l-malate. However, difference spectra reveal that each of these electron donors is able to reduce almost quantitatively all of the cytochrome components of the membrane preparations. These findings indicate that malate dehydrogenase is coupled to glucose transport at a low potential site which is proximal to ubiquinone. Ascorbate-reduced tetramethylphenylenediamine is oxidized more rapidly by the vesicles than malate and is about as effective as malate in support of the glucose transport rate. This artificial reductant is oxidized via a branch of the respiratory system containing cytochrome c that is blocked by 2 µm cynaide but not by 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide. Glucose transport that is dependent on this artificial system is inhibited in a similar fashion. However, malate-dependent transport is blocked by the quinoline compound but not by 2 µm cyanide. This reveals a second site of higher potential in the respiratory chain that is linked to glucose transport."
https://openalex.org/W1517132480,"Abstract Cytochrome b5 of rat liver microsomes is reduced by α-NADH; the extent of reduction is equal to that obtained with β-NADH. With both nucleotides, the rates of reduction of cytochrome b5 are very fast; alternatively, rates of reduction of cytochrome c and dichloroindophenol have been measured. The rates observed with α-NADH are about 10% of the rates observed with β-NADH. Conditions have been established for the measurement of first order kinetic parameters in these reductions: Km of α- and β-NADH are 13.0 and 3.3 µm for cytochrome c reductase activity and 5.1 and 6.7 µm, respectively, for dichloroindophenol reduction. Three lines of evidence suggest that α-NADH and β-NADH may reduce cytochrome c and dichloroindophenol via the same microsomal flavoprotein. (a) There is competition between α- and β-NADH. (b) The relative rates of cytochrome c reduction are diminished equally for α- and β-NADH when the enzyme is inhibited or denatured. (c) The relative rates of reduction of both cytochrome c and dichloroindophenol are increased equally for α- and β-NADH when microsomal cytochrome b5 reductase is enriched. Both α- and β-NADH are electron donors to cytochrome P-450 in microsomes. The initial rates of reduction of cytochrome P-450 by α- and β-NADH are equal (K = 0.126 min-1) and considerably slower than reduction by NADPH. In a second, slower phase of cytochrome P-450 reduction, the rate is somewhat less rapid with α-NADH (K = 0.030 min-1) than with β-NADH (K = 0.042 min-1). Compared to β-NADH and NADPH, α-NADH is a more efficacious donor of electrons for microsomal mixed function oxidation of a methyl sterol intermediate of cholesterol biosynthesis. Furthermore, the substrate-independent rate of oxidation of α-NADH is very slow (10% of β-NADH). To date, only diaphorase-like activities have been reported for oxidation of α-NADH. Although the present report shows clearly that α-NADH may function as an electron donor to microsomal mixed function oxidases, the physiological significance of these findings remains obscure because enzymic reduction of α-NAD+ has not yet been reported."
https://openalex.org/W1637715399,"Abstract Rat kidney cortex mitochondria incubated in an isotonic solution containing sodium chloride, EDTA, and Pi exhibit a hitherto unreported phenomenon. The addition of substrate induces a rapid respiratory rate, accompanied by a marked oxidation of pyridine nucleotides measured by dual wave length spectroscopy. In contrast to the typical response, subsequent addition of ADP induces a slowing of respiration associated with reduction of pyridine nucleotides (reverse acceptor control). The phenomenon will not occur if Mg++, rutamycin, or uncoupling agents are present. However, if an uncoupling agent is added after substrate, the ADP effects on respiration and pyridine nucleotides are mimicked. The marked susceptibility of kidney mitochondria to uncoupling in sodium-containing solutions appears to be closely related to the mechanism of this phenomenon."
https://openalex.org/W1497656698,"Abstract Addition of increasing levels of sodium deoxycholate to fixed quantities of liver microsomes from noninduced mice reveals a sequential release, in three discrete steps, of certain elements of the mixed function oxidase system. Only one of these stages influences aniline and naphthalene oxidase activity, suggesting the possibility that sequential release is related to differentiation of function. The cytochrome P-450 and the NADPH2-dependent cytochrome c reductase (EC 1.6.2.3) components can be separated by ammonium sulfate precipitation and reconstituted to form a system active against naphthalene. The partial removal of sodium deoxycholate from solubilized cytochrome P-450 by the addition of Dowex 1X 2-400 results in a decrease of contaminant cytochrome P-420 with a concomitant increase in the amount of cytochrome P-450, a phenomenon which suggests renaturation of cytochrome P-420 into cytochrome P-450."

https://openalex.org/W1534891359,"Abstract 7α-Hydroxylation of taurodeoxycholic acid was demonstrated by incubation of tauro[24-14C]deoxycholate with rat liver microsomes. Following hydrolysis of the conjugated bile acids, radioactive cholic acid was identified as the major product of the reaction by reverse isotopic dilution, the preparation of methyl cholate and crystallization to constant specific activity. The taurodeoxycholate 7α-hydroxylase system required NADPH and molecular oxygen for activity. The activity was inhibited by CO and the inhibition could be reversed by light, suggesting the involvement of cytochrome P-450. Addition of the 105,000 x g supernatant to the microsomes stimulated 7α-hydroxylation of taurodeoxycholate. Adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (3':5'-AMP) also stimulated the 7α-hydroxylation, however, the amount of the nucleotide present in the supernatant fraction could account for only 30% of its stimulatory activity. The dialysate of the supernatant was fractionated, and the fraction containing fatty acids, but free of 3':5'-AMP, also possessed stimulatory activity. Gasliquid chromatography identified palmitic, stearic, and linoleic acids as the major fatty acids in this fraction. In separate tests, it was found that saturated fatty acids with chain lengths of C12 to C20 stimulated, while long chain unsaturated fatty acids inhibited the 7α-hydroxylation. The inhibition by unsaturated fatty acids could be reversed by saturated fatty acids. The stimulatory effects of 3':5'-AMP and palmitic acid on the 7α-hydroxylase activity were additive when their concentrations were less than that producing maximal stimulation, and the maximal stimulation of the hydroxylase activity by either 3':5'-AMP, palmitate, or the supernatant fraction was comparable. The fatty acid content of the 105,000 x g supernatant was sufficient to account for maximal stimulation."
