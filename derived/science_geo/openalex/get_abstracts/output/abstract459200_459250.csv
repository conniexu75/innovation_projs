https://openalex.org/W2080426384,"From Dust Grains to Planets Almost 900 extrasolar planets have been identified, but we still struggle to understand exactly how planets form. Using data from the Atacama Large Millimeter Array, van der Marel et al. (p. 1199 ; see the Perspective by Armitage ) report a highly asymmetric distribution of millimeter-sized grains surrounding a young star. Modeling suggests that these particles—the material from which planets form—are being trapped within a protoplanetary disk by an anticyclonic vortex. Localized concentration of large grains within a protoplanetary disk is thought to be a step in planet formation."

However, the mechanisms underlying this disease are still largely unknown (see the Perspective by Rauch and Carlezon Jr. ). Ahmari et al. (p. 1234 ) stimulated glutamatergic pathways between the orbitofrontal cortex and the ventromedial striatum and used grooming to assess obsessive compulsive behavior in mice. Repetitive stimulation over days triggered changes in the neuronal responses of the ventromedial striatum. Over time, the behavior of the animals became independent of stimulation and could be prevented by the antidepressant fluoxetine. Burguière et al. (p. 1243 ) investigated the neural basis of obsessive compulsive symptoms in a mutant mouse that showed excessive expression of a conditioned form of grooming."

https://openalex.org/W2070634275,"PTEN Variations The product of the tumor suppressor gene phosphate and tensin homolog on chromosome ten ( PTEN) is a lipid and protein phosphatase that regulates important cellular processes, including growth, survival, and metabolism (see the Perspective by Leslie and Brunton ). Though PTEN is best known for effects on the phosphatidylnositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway, the PTEN protein is also found in the nucleus. Bassi et al. (p. 395 ) found that PTEN's presence in the nucleus was regulated in response to covalent modification of the protein by SUMOylation and phosphorylation. Cells lacking nuclear PTEN showed increased sensitivity to DNA damage and underwent cell death if the PI3K pathway was also inhibited. Hopkins et al. (p. 399 , published online 6 June) discovered an alternative translation start site in human PTEN messenger RNA that allowed expression of a protein, PTEN-Long, with about 170 extra amino acids. The unusual enzyme was released from cells and then taken up into other cells. In a mouse tumor model, uptake of the enzyme inhibited the PI3K pathway and inhibited tumor growth."
https://openalex.org/W2168900088,"This Is the Place Bats, bees, seals, and many seabirds practice central-place foraging, leaving a central home site, such as a hive or a rookery, to forage in a specific territory. Such species also share the challenge of competing for local resources with individuals from separate colonies. Using satellite tags, Wakefield et al. (p. 68 , published online 6 June; see the Perspective by Weimerskirch ) followed over 180 northern gannets to determine potential drivers of foraging territory division. Boundaries among colonial territories arose as a result of competition with individuals from other territories. Individuals from the same colony appeared to share information about foraging sites, presumably contributing to the establishment and maintenance of specific, long-term colonial territories."

However, many clusters are stabilized by organic ligands that create a barrier for charge transfer reactions to create ions. Roy et al. (p. 157 , published online 6 June; see the Perspective by Batail ) now report that chromium, cobalt, and nickel selenide and telluride clusters form materials by charge transfer with C 60 .

https://openalex.org/W2000270075,"Getting Active The P450 cytochromes are a family of enzymes that contain a heme cofactor and catalyze the oxidation of organic substrates, including drugs. Protein partners are required to deliver electrons to P450. Insight into this mechanism has come from studies of bacterial P450cam; however, a lack of structures of redox complexes has hindered understanding. Tripathi et al. (p. 1227 ) describe the high resolution crystal structures of oxidized and reduced P450cam complexed with its redox partner putidaredoxin (Pdx). Pdx favors binding to the more open form of P450cam, which enables establishment of the water-mediated H-bonded network required for proton-coupled electron transfer and O 2 activation."

Carolin et al. (p. 1564 , published online 6 June) present data from a suite of precisely dated stalagmites from Borneo that reveal how the western tropical Pacific region behaved between 100,000 and 15,000 years ago, a period during which many abrupt climate changes occurred in other parts of the world. While the hydroclimate of Borneo changed in response to precessional forcing, it responded only weakly to the forces that produced glacial-interglacial changes in global climate."
https://openalex.org/W2036504531,"DNA damage evokes a complex and highly coordinated DNA damage response (DDR) that is integral to the suppression of genomic instability. Double-strand breaks (DSBs) are considered the most deleterious form damage. Evidence suggests that trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me3) presents a barrier to DSB repair. Also, global levels of histone methylation are clinically predictive for several tumor types. Therefore, demethylation of H3K9 may be an important step in the repair of DSBs. The KDM4 subfamily of demethylases removes H3K9 tri- and dimethylation and contributes to the regulation of cellular differentiation and proliferation; mutation or aberrant expression of KDM4 proteins has been identified in several human tumors. We hypothesize that members of the KDM4 subfamily may be components of the DDR. We found that Kdm4b-enhanced GFP (EGFP) and KDM4D-EGFP were recruited rapidly to DNA damage induced by laser micro-irradiation. Focusing on the clinically relevant Kdm4b, we found that recruitment was dependent on poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 activity as well as Kdm4b demethylase activity. The Kdm4 proteins did not measurably accumulate at γ-irradiation-induced γH2AX foci. Nevertheless, increased levels of Kdm4b were associated with decreased numbers of γH2AX foci 6 h after irradiation as well as increased cell survival. Finally, we found that levels of H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 were decreased at early time points after 2 gray of γ-irradiation. Taken together, these data demonstrate that Kdm4b is a DDR protein and that overexpression of Kdm4b may contribute to the failure of anti-cancer therapy that relies on the induction of DNA damage."
https://openalex.org/W2005470559,"Entangled many-body states are an essential resource for quantum computing and interferometry. Determining the type of entanglement present in a system usually requires access to an exponential number of parameters. We show that in the case of pure multi-particle quantum states, features of the global entanglement can already be extracted from local information alone. This is achieved by associating with any given class of entanglement an entanglement polytope---a geometric object which characterizes the single-particle states compatible with that class. Our results, applicable to systems of arbitrary size and statistics, give rise to local witnesses for global pure-state entanglement, and can be generalized to states affected by low levels of noise."
https://openalex.org/W1976414811,"Dividing the Brain The cerebral cortex of the brain is organized into primary cortical areas, which receive direct inputs from the thalamus, and higher-order cortical areas, which in turn receive inputs from one or more primary cortical areas. Chou et al. (p. 1239 ) investigated the mechanisms underlying the specification of higher-order cortical areas. Input from the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus into the primary visual area (V1) is required to drive the genetic and functional differentiation of a large visual cortical field into primary and higher-order visual areas. Thalamocortical axon input acts on a large visual cortical field. The afferents from the dorsal lateral geniculate are necessary to further refine the cortex into subareas that distinguish V1 from higher processing areas. In the relatively simple model that emerges from these findings, sensory input is essential to distinguish primary and higher-order cortical areas."
https://openalex.org/W2056273927,"Interleukin-34 (IL-34) is highly expressed in brain. IL-34 signaling via its cognate receptor, colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R), is required for the development of microglia. However, the differential expression of IL-34 and the CSF-1R in brain suggests that IL-34 may signal via an alternate receptor. By IL-34 affinity chromatography of solubilized mouse brain membrane followed by mass spectrometric analysis, we identified receptor-type protein-tyrosine phosphatase ζ (PTP-ζ), a cell surface chondroitin sulfate (CS) proteoglycan, as a novel IL-34 receptor. PTP-ζ is primarily expressed on neural progenitors and glial cells and is highly expressed in human glioblastomas. IL-34 selectively bound PTP-ζ in CSF-1R-deficient U251 human glioblastoma cell lysates and inhibited the proliferation, clonogenicity, and motility of U251 cells in a PTP-ζ-dependent manner. These effects were correlated with an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of the previously identified PTP-ζ downstream effectors focal adhesion kinase and paxillin. IL-34 binding to U251 cells was abrogated by chondroitinase ABC treatment, and CS competed with IL-34 for binding to the extracellular domain of PTP-ζ and to the cells, indicating a dependence of binding on PTP-ζ CS moieties. This study identifies an alternate receptor for IL-34 that may mediate its action on novel cellular targets."

In the present study, we used recombinant α-Syn protein (wild type, single point mutants, and the fragment 30–110) to obtain different aggregate species in vitro and evaluated the direct effect of these species on MT polymerization and kinesin-dependent MT gliding in a cell-free system. Our data showed that α-Syn oligomers have a strong influence on kinesin-driven MT motility, whereas seeds of α-Syn significantly inhibited MT assembly, promoted by the axon-specific MAP, Tau. In a cellular system, mild overexpression of an oligomerizing α-Syn variant and, less potently, α-Syn seeds impaired neurite network morphology. This was accompanied by impaired MT stability and reduced presence of kinesin and kinesin-dependent cargoes within neurites. Our results suggest that the MT-kinesin network is the first target of soluble α-Syn aggregates. α-Syn wild type (WTS) and the α-Syn variants E57K (glutamic acid to lysine substitution at amino acid 57 of the α-Syn protein), A30P (alanine to proline substitution at amino acid 30 of the α-Syn protein), and aSyn(30–110) (core part of the α-Syn protein consisting of amino acids 30–110) were used.

Briefly, the pellet obtained in the 50% (v/v) ethanol precipitation step was resuspended in 9 ml/liter of culture of 20 mm Tris, pH 8, and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against the same buffer with a 3.5-kDa cut-off membrane (Spectrum Laboratories Inc., Rancho Dominguez, CA). The sample was applied onto a HiTrap Q HP column (GE Healthcare), equilibrated with 20 mm Tris, pH 8, and eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 500 mm NaCl over 10 column volumes. The collected fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining, and α-Syn-containing fractions were merged. For aSyn(30–110), the flow-through was collected, analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and concentrated with 3-kDa cut-off Amicon concentrators (Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany). All preparations were finally dialyzed against 20 mm ammonium acetate, lyophilized, and stored at −20 °C. The lyophilized samples were resuspended in MT assembly buffer (20 mm PIPES, 80 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm MgCl2, pH 6.8) at a concentration of 400 μm and stored at −20 °C until usage. The purity of α-Syn proteins was 98–100%, as determined by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining (data not shown). 400 μm α-Syn solutions were diluted to 100 μm solutions with MT assembly buffer before aggregation.

Kinesins were expressed in E. coli as fusion proteins with a C-terminal chitin-binding intein tag and purified by binding to chitin beads followed by removal of the intein tag by 50 mm DTT-induced specific self-cleavage (25.Kalchishkova N. Böhm K.J. The role of Kinesin neck linker and neck in velocity regulation.J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 382: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The kinesins were stored in motility buffer (50 mm imidazole, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm DTT, pH 6.8) supplemented with 150 mm NaCl and 1 m glycerol at −80 °C. Microtubule protein (MTP) consisting of 80% tubulin and 20% complete MAP set (MAP1, MAP2, and Tau) was purified from porcine brain homogenates by two cycles of temperature-dependent disassembly (0 °C)/reassembly (37 °C) (26.Shelanski M.L. Gaskin F. Cantor C.R. Microtubule assembly in the absence of added nucleotides.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1973; 70: 765-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar). To obtain pure tubulin, co-purified MAPs were removed by phosphocellulose ion exchange chromatography, according to a previously published protocol (27.Weingarten M.D. Lockwood A.H. Hwo S.Y. Kirschner M.W. A protein factor essential for microtubule assembly.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1975; 72: 1858-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (2201) Google Scholar). MAP2 and Tau were eluted from the phosphocellulose, treated for 5 min at 95 °C (28.Herzog W. Weber K. Fractionation of brain microtubule-associated proteins. Isolation of two different proteins which stimulate tubulin polymerization in vitro.Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 92: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), and separated from denatured material (MAP1 and residual tubulin) by ultracentrifugation (45 min, 40,000 rpm, Beckman Coulter Ti50.2 rotor, Beckman Coulter, Krefeld, Germany). Tau and the high molecular weight MAP2 were separated by passing the clear supernatant through a 100-kDa ultrafilter. All proteins (i.e. MTP, tubulin, MAP2, and Tau) were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until usage. Stabilized MTs were formed by taxol-promoted self-assembly at 37 °C from 2 mg/ml pure tubulin in the MT assembly buffer supplemented with 0.2 mm GTP and 20 μm taxol. MTs were usually prepared at the day of usage at least 30 min prior to an experiment. The purity of kinesins was 75–80%, and the purities of MTP, tubulin, MAP2, and Tau were all 95–98%, as determined by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Cytoskeleton proteins (total amount of 1 μg/spot) were dotted onto nitrocellulose membrane stripes in the order shown in Fig. 1. BSA was used to control for a nonspecific binding of α-Syn. As positive control, 3 μl of 100 μm α-Syn solution were applied. Proteins were allowed to bind to the nitrocellulose for 5 min at room temperature. Unbound proteins were removed by washing three times with a blocking buffer (0.5 g/100 ml BSA, 0.5% Tween 20 in PBS). All further washing steps and antibody dilutions for ligand blot experiments were performed in the blocking buffer. The stripes were incubated in 10 μm solutions of monomeric or multimeric WTS or α-Syn variants overnight at 4 °C. To control for nonspecific binding, one stripe was incubated in the blocking buffer in the absence of α-Syn. Unbound α-Syn was washed out three times. α-Syn binding was detected after incubation with monoclonal mouse anti-α-Syn antibody (1:1000; clone 42, BD Biosciences) for 1 h at room temperature followed by three times washing and incubation with goat anti-mouse antibody labeled with an infrared dye, IRDye 800CW (1:2000; LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE) for 1 h at room temperature. After extensive washing, the stripes were developed on the Odyssey infrared imager using the Odyssey application software version 3.0 (both from LI-COR Biosciences). Densitometry analysis was performed by estimating an integrated intensity value of each spot that is proportional to the amount of dye-labeled antibodies on the membrane using the Odyssey application software. Three independent ligand blots were performed, and mean values of the intensities ± S.D. were calculated. MT assembly was recorded at 37 °C by a Cary 100 spectrophotometer equipped with a temperature-controlled multicell holder (Agilent Technologies, Böblingen, Germany) using 2-mm OS glass cuvettes (Hellma GmbH & Co. KG, Müllheim, Germany). For this, the proteins were adjusted to a total volume of 275 μl in the MT assembly buffer containing 0.5 mm GTP. To analyze the influence of α-Syn on MT polymerization in the presence of MAPs, assembly was performed 1) from MTP (final concentration 1.3 mg/ml) in the presence of 4 μm WTS or α-Syn variants; 2) from pure tubulin (16 μm) with MAP2 (1.6 μm) in the presence of 6.3 μm WTS or α-Syn variants; or 3) from pure tubulin (16 μm) with Tau (2.1 or 2.7 μm) in the presence of 8.7 μm WTS or α-Syn variants. To investigate if there is a dose-dependent effect of WTS on Tau-promoted MT assembly, WTS was added to the assembly reaction (16 μm tubulin and 2.1 μm Tau) at concentrations of 2.18, 4.36, 8.73, and 17.45 μm. As a control, MTs were assembled at the respective conditions in the absence of α-Syn. As a negative control for MT polymerization, MT assembly was performed from purified tubulin (16 μm) with or without α-Syns (6.3 μm) and in the absence of any MAPs. The MT assembly measurements with MAP2 and MTP were performed with an additional cooling step to 10 °C. The rationale for the cooling step was to test for a possible stabilizing effect of α-Syn on established MT in the absence of the α-Syn inhibitory effect on MT polymerization. Measurements of Tau-promoted MT assemblies were performed with an addition of the MT assembly-promoting drug taxol to a final concentration of 10 μm. The rationale for the taxol step in Tau assemblies was to prove that tubulin had not lost its assembling capacity under α-Syn-inhibitory conditions. MT polymerization was measured as the turbidity (A360 nm) of the solution recorded every 4 s at 360 nm over 30–60 min. Data are shown as representative assembly curves and mean assembly levels at 30 min (plateau level, representing the assembly/disassembly steady state) of three independent experiments for each condition. To quantitatively analyze the effect of α-Syns on MT assembly, the turbidity signals after 30 min in each assay were compared with that of the control condition. Gliding assays were performed on glass slides (for principles, see Ref. 29.Böhm K.J. Steinmetzer P. Daniel A. Baum M. Vater W. Unger E. Kinesin-driven microtubule motility in the presence of alkaline-earth metal ions. Indication for a calcium ion-dependent motility.Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1997; 37: 226-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) covered by casein (5 mg/ml). MT were assembled and stabilized as described above. All gliding assays were performed with the KIF5A560 in the motility buffer supplemented with 20 μm taxol. The gliding assay mixture containing KIF5A560 (0.4 mg/ml), stabilized MTs (40 μg/ml), 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm ATP, and 10 μm α-Syn was incubated for 5 min at room temperature prior to transfer onto the casein-coated glass slide. The sample was covered by a coverslip, and MT gliding was observed as described below. The control gliding assay was performed in the absence of α-Syn. MT gliding velocities were measured during observation by following the tracks of individual MTs using the Argus-20 software (Hamamatsu Photonics, Herrsching am Ammersee, Germany). All gliding assays were carried out at 36 °C. The mean gliding velocities were calculated from the gliding velocities of at least 10 MTs in each sample. MT gliding was visualized by video-enhanced differential interference contrast microscopy. All analyses were performed using an Zeiss Axiophot microscope (Carl Zeiss, Munich, Germany) equipped with a Plan-Neofluar ×63/1.25 oil immersion objective (Carl Zeiss), a Chalnicon video camera type C2400-0.1 (Hamamatsu Photonics), and the image processing system Argus-20 (Hamamatsu Photonics), which enables background subtraction and electronic contrast enhancement. MT movement was documented on a digital hard disk recorder (JVC SR-DVM70EU, JVC, Wayne, NJ). Video sequences were digitized using Adobe Photoshop, resulting in image sequences of 30 frames/s. LUHMES cells (gift of Dr. M. Leist, Konstanz, Germany; described in Ref. 30.Scholz D. Pöltl D. Genewsky A. Weng M. Waldmann T. Schildknecht S. Leist M. Rapid, complete and large-scale generation of post-mitotic neurons from the human LUHMES cell line.J. Neurochem. 2011; 119: 957-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified 95% air, 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were cultured in plastic flasks or in plastic plates coated with poly-l-ornithine (50 μg/ml) and fibronectin (1 μg/ml) (both from Sigma-Aldrich) overnight at 37 °C and washed once with PBS prior to seeding the cells. LUHMES cells were maintained and expanded in advanced DMEM/F-12/Glutamax medium supplemented with N2 supplement (both from Invitrogen) and 40 ng/ml FGF2 (R&D Systems, Wiesbaden-Nordenstadt, Germany) in flasks. Cells were split using TrypLE Express (Invitrogen) at 80% confluence. Neuronal differentiation of LUHMES cells was performed for 6 days in 24-well plates (150,000 cells in 500 μl/well) in advanced DMEM/F-12/Glutamax/N2 medium supplemented with 1 μg/ml tetracycline, 1 mm cAMP (both from Sigma-Aldrich), and 2 ng/ml glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (R&D Systems). Lentiviral (LV) constructs encoding for either WTS or the E57K α-Syn variant containing an internal ribosome entry site GFP sequence or LV encoding only an internal ribosome entry site GFP (referred to hereafter as WTS, E57K, and GFP, respectively) were used to infect LUHMES cells. LUHMES cells were predifferentiated for 2 days before infection at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 2 (mild) or 4 (high overexpression). LV infection was performed for 48 h. At day 4 of differentiation, infected cells were either incubated with 250 nm MitoTracker_RedCMXRos (Invitrogen) for mitochondria visualization for 45 min at 37 °C before fixation or directly fixed. Cells were fixed with either 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at 37 °C (for β3-tubulin, α-Syn, Tau, and mitochondria detection) or 100% methanol for 10 min at −20 °C followed by 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at 37 °C (for acetylated tubulin and KIF5 stainings). Cells were stained with rabbit monoclonal anti-β3-tubulin antibody (1:500; clone TUJ1 1-15-79, Covance, Munich, Germany), mouse monoclonal anti-α-Syn antibody (1:250; LB509) or rabbit polyclonal anti-Tau antibody (1:50) (both from Abcam, Cambridge, MA), or mouse monoclonal anti-acetylated tubulin antibody (1:10,000; clone 6-11B-1) or rabbit anti-KIF5 (1:100) (both from Sigma-Aldrich) and were counterstained with DAPI (1 μg/ml). The following secondary antibodies were used: donkey anti-rabbit AlexaFluor546 and donkey anti-mouse AlexaFluor649 (both from Invitrogen). Cells were visualized on a Zeiss AxioVert 200 inverted microscope with the Axiovision Software (Carl Zeiss). Cell death was visualized by the addition of 0.4 g/100 ml trypan blue and was determined as a percentage of trypan blue-positive cells within a total number of cells on a particular image. Network morphology was characterized by the number of neurites crossing three unified random horizontal parallel lines over the image. Acetylated tubulin was quantified by the fluorescence intensities over the picture and normalized to the number of DAPI-positive nuclei in this picture. KIF5 signals within neurites were determined by the mean intensity along the tracing of a single neurite. At least 100 neurites were analyzed for each condition. Distribution of mitochondria in neurites was defined as the number of mitochondria/μm of a neurite length. Colocalization of α-Syn with β3-tubulin and Tau was quantified by the determination of Pearson's overlap coefficient. Each condition was performed in duplicates. Image analyses were performed using ImageJ software version 1.47f (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Ligand blot densitometry data were analyzed by repeated measures analysis of variance with a Dunnett post hoc test separately for α-S"

Occasionally, however, earthquakes along strike-slip faults appear to propagate so that the rupture velocity is faster than shear waves, creating a sort of sonic boom along the fault surface. Passelègue et al. (p. 1208 ) were able to reproduce and measure these so-called supershear ruptures in stick-slip experiments with two pieces of granite under high applied normal stress. Much like during a sonic boom when a plane travels faster than the speed of sound, the ruptures created a shock wave in the form of a Mach cone around the rupture front."

Full-length Bid is cleaved in response to apoptotic stimuli into two fragments, p7 and tBid (p15), that are held together by strong hydrophobic interactions until the complex binds to membranes. The detailed mechanism(s) of fragment separation including tBid binding to membranes and release of the p7 fragment to the cytoplasm remain unclear. Using liposomes or isolated mitochondria with fluorescently labeled proteins at physiological concentrations as in vitro models, we report that the two components of the complex quickly separate upon interaction with a membrane.

The intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of apoptosis converge at the MOM where the Bcl-2 family of proteins plays a pivotal role in the regulation of apoptosis through protein-protein and protein-membrane interactions (3.Leber B.

The Bcl-2 family includes more than 20 members with either pro-apoptotic or anti-apoptotic functions. It is divided into three groups based on function and the presence of conserved Bcl-2 homology (BH) regions. The pro-apoptotic proteins comprise two groups; those with all four homology regions, such as Bax and Bak, and those that contain only the BH3 region (5.Hardwick J.M. Youle R.J. SnapShot.

Mtch2 is a part of the mitochondrial carrier family proteins and has been recently identified as a novel binding partner of tBid on the MOM. Mtch2 anchors in the MOM by six transmembrane helices and is a structural homologue to the mitochondrial inner membrane protein ANT (26.Robinson A.J. Kunji E.R. Gross A.

Cell Res. 2012; 318: 1316-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Unlike other well studied BH3 proteins that are unstructured, Bid shares a similar three-dimensional structural arrangement of its constituent α-helices with the multiregion family members Bcl-XL and Bax (27.Suzuki M.

Thus Bid contains eight α-helices, of which α6 and α7 are central hydrophobic helices necessary for binding to the membrane that are surrounded by the remaining amphipathic helices (21.Chou J.J.

The BH3 region located within α3 is critical for binding to other Bcl-2 family members to regulate apoptosis (19.Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X.

In addition, a BH4 region is present close to the N terminus of Bid (6.Kvansakul M. Yang H. Fairlie W.D. Czabotar P.E. Fischer S.F. Perugini M.A. Huang D.C. Colman P.M.

Andrews D.W. Bid. A Bax-like BH3 protein.Oncogene. 2008; 27: S93-S104Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Additional clues from phylogenomic analysis and other aspects of the mechanism of action strongly suggest that Bid is not a bona fide BH3 protein and may function as a “pseudo-Bax” that is unable to oligomerize efficiently, and permeabilize the MOM itself but that functions to recruit Bax to the membrane and to activate it (for review, see Ref. 35.Billen L.P. Shamas-Din A. Andrews D.W. Bid. A Bax-like BH3 protein.Oncogene. 2008; 27: S93-S104Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Despite the critical role of Bid in apoptosis, the detailed mechanism of the events that follow the cleavage of Bid until it assumes its fully active form at the MOM, including how membrane binding may participate in this process, remains to be understood. To address these questions, we used fluorescence spectroscopy to investigate the mechanism of activation of Bid using a cell-free system with either isolated mitochondria or biomimetic liposomes. We used physiological nanomolar concentrations of recombinant proteins to accurately reflect cellular conditions (36.Polster B.M. Basañez G. Young M. Suzuki M. Fiskum G. Inhibition of Bax-induced cytochrome c release from neural cell and brain mitochondria by dibucaine and propranolol.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 2735-2743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By labeling Bid at selected positions, the individual steps in this process were identified and studied separately. Our results indicate that the activation of cBid begins when binding to membranes triggers the separation of the two cleaved fragments. Then an elaborate conformational change results in the insertion of anchoring helices in the membrane to achieve the fully active form. Furthermore, we show that the conformational change in tBid after binding to the membrane is the specific step that is accelerated by Mtch2 on the MOM. Different variants of recombinant His6-tagged full-length murine Bid were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis and purified as described (15.Dlugosz P.J. Billen L.P. Annis M.G. Zhu W. Zhang Z. Lin J. Leber B. Andrews D.W. Bcl-2 changes conformation to inhibit Bax oligomerization.EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2287-2296Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). All of the Bid proteins used in our studies contain an N-terminal His tag, except tBid, in which the His-tagged p7 fragment was removed. For clarity in the nomenclature, we have omitted the His prefix from the names of the proteins. Wild-type (WT) Bid has two endogenous cysteine residues at positions 30 and 126. Plasmids encoding single cysteine versions of Bid with a cysteine at one of the endogenous positions and a no-cysteine variant were generated through QuikChange mutagenesis (Stratagene). The endogenous cysteine residues in Bid were mutated to serine residues for the no-cysteine variant. Subsequently, Bid plasmids containing a single cysteine at various locations within the protein were generated from the no-cysteine Bid plasmid by using QuikChange mutagenesis. By convention, the Bid variants are identified by the location of the single cysteine residue used for labeling; thus, tBid 126C refers to the tBid fragment of Bid with a single cysteine at position 126. A plasmid was also generated in which all six lysine residues in Bid 126C were replaced with arginine residues (Bid ΔK 126C). All the lysine residues in murine Bid are located in close proximity; therefore, silent mutations were created to excise the coding region for Bid from amino acid Ala-130 to Val-175, and the sequence was replaced with an annealed pair of oligonucleotides containing the desired mutations. All of the Bid proteins contained an N-terminal His tag and were purified using nickel-affinity chromatography (Qiagen) as described (23.Zha J. Weiler S. Oh K.J. Wei M.C. Korsmeyer S.J. Posttranslational N-myristoylation of BID as a molecular switch for targeting mitochondria and apoptosis.Science. 2000; 290: 1761-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). At this stage, purified Bid mutants intended for labeling were dialyzed in storage buffer (10 mm Hepes, 7.3, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol). The protein was labeled with the indicated dyes in the storage buffer in the presence of 0.5% CHAPS for 2–3 h at room temperature with rotation. For labeling, a 10–15-fold molar excess of dye dissolved in DMSO was added to the protein slowly while ensuring that the final DMSO content of the reaction did not exceed 10%. To remove the excess unreacted dye, Bid was subjected to nickel-affinity chromatography and washed with at least 25 ml of wash buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 300 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 0.5% CHAPS). The labeled Bid was then eluted with elution buffer (wash buffer supplemented with 200 mm imidazole). The labeling efficiency of Bid at a given residue was measured by dividing the dye concentration (measured by absorbance) by the protein concentration (measured by Bradford assay). Only if the labeling efficiency was ∼70% or higher was the protein used. Purified unlabeled WT Bid or labeled Bid proteins (2–4 mg/ml) were incubated with 500 units of caspase 8 (Enzo Life Sciences) with a final concentration of 1 unit/μl for ∼40 h at room temperature to generate cBid. The cleavage efficiency was checked by Coomassie Blue staining of an SDS-PAGE gel, and cBid was dialyzed against storage buffer. To generate recombinant tBid, cBid (labeled or otherwise) was subjected to nickel-affinity chromatography, tBid was isolated using 2% (w/v) octylglucoside (Sigma) in the wash buffer to remove tBid from the bound p7 fragment, and the eluent was dialyzed against storage buffer. WT Bax and Bcl-XL were purified as described previously (12.Yethon J.A. Epand R.F. Leber B. Epand R.M. Andrews D.W.

The isolated mitochondria were frozen at 50 mg/ml final protein concentration (Bradford assay) in 10-μl aliquots and stored at −80 °C until use. When ready to use, mitochondria were rapidly thawed and washed in AT/KCl buffer at 1 mg/ml: 300 mm trehalose, 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.7, 80 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) BSA.

Membrane permeabilization assays with liposomes encapsulating ANTS (8-aminonaphthalene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid, disodium salt) and DPX (p-xylene-bis-pyridinium bromide) were carried out as described previously (37.Satsoura D.

Macroautophagy (referred to as autophagy hereafter) is one of the major degradation systems in the cell. A small region of the cytoplasm is first enclosed by the autophagosome, and then degraded when the autophagosome fuses with the lysosome (1.Tooze S.A. Yoshimori T.

The Role of Atg Proteins in Autophagosome Formation.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2011; 27: 107-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (2153) Google Scholar). Autophagy occurs constitutively at basal levels, which is important for turnover of cytoplasmic materials such as proteins and organelles both selectively and non-selectively (3.Levine B. Kroemer G.

The induced autophagy is important for providing amino acids and other factors, which can be used for synthesis of proteins and other metabolites, energy production, and gluconeogenesis under starvation conditions (4.Mizushima N.

Whereas mTORC1 positively regulates protein translation, ribosome biogenesis, and cell size through phosphorylation of S6-kinase (S6K), 4E-BP1, and other substrates, it negatively regulates autophagy through phosphorylation of its putative substrates ULK1 and Atg13, which are part of the most upstream autophagy complex together with FIP200 and Atg101 (15.Mizushima N.

However, recent studies have shown that autophagy can also be regulated by a number of mTORC1-independent pathways or transcriptional factors (9.Kroemer G. Mariño G. Levine B.

Overview of macroautophagy regulation in mammalian cells.Cell Res. 2010; 20: 748-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). For example, AMP-activated protein kinase not only inhibits the mTOR pathway, but also directly phosphorylates and activates ULK1 (18.Mihaylova M.M. Shaw R.J. The AMPK signalling pathway coordinates cell growth, autophagy and metabolism.Nat. Cell Biol. 2011; 13: 1016-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (1980) Google Scholar). Starvation-induced phosphorylation of Bcl-2 by JNK1 releases Beclin 1, which promotes autophagy (19.Wei Y. Pattingre S. Sinha S. Bassik M. Levine B. JNK1-mediated phosphorylation of Bcl-2 regulates starvation-induced autophagy.Mol. Cell. 2008; 30: 678-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). Starvation also activates transcription factor EB (TFEB), an important gene for lysosomal biogenesis, which induces various autophagy-related factors at the transcriptional level (20.Settembre C. Di Malta C. Polito V.A. Garcia Arencibia M.G. Vetrini F. Erdin S. Erdin S.U. Huynh T. Medina D. Colella P. Sardiello M. Rubinsztein D.C. Ballabio A.

Thus, it is uncertain whether mTORC1 is indeed a major regulator of autophagy under physiological conditions in vivo. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that autophagy regulation can vary in different tissues/organs. The roles of individual amino acids and hormones in autophagy have been determined in great detail in the liver using an ex vivo perfusion system (21.Mortimore G.E. Pösö A.R. Intracellular protein catabolism and its control during nutrient deprivation and supply.Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1987; 7: 539-564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, such analyses are not entirely physiological, and have not been extensively performed in other tissues. In neonatal pigs, the differential effects of amino acids and insulin on protein synthesis were examined in vivo using euglycemic clamp methods; insulin has no effect on the rate of protein synthesis in the liver, whereas amino acids do in this organ (22.O'Connor P.M.

Mechanisms involved in the coordinate regulation of mTORC1 by insulin and amino acids.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 8287-8296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). By contrast, insulin can stimulate protein synthesis in skeletal and cardiac muscles, skin, and spleen in neonatal pigs (23.Davis T.A. Fiorotto M.L. Burrin D.G. Reeds P.J. Nguyen H.V. Beckett P.R. Vann R.C. O'Connor P.M. Stimulation of protein synthesis by both insulin and amino acids is unique to skeletal muscle in neonatal pigs.Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 282: E880-E890Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). However, whether autophagy is also regulated differently in different tissues by amino acids and insulin in vivo has not been determined. Thus, it is important to carefully assess the in vivo autophagy regulators. In the present study, we investigated the relative contribution of glucose, insulin, and amino acids to regulation of mTORC1 and autophagy in the liver and muscle in vivo. To administer insulin and amino acids to starved mice, we utilized hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp and intravenous amino acid administration methods, respectively. We found that glucose has no major role in autophagy regulation, and that the effect of insulin on the mTORC1-autophagy pathway is greater in muscle than in the liver, whereas amino acids regulate the mTORC1-autophagy pathway more effectively in the liver than in muscle. C57BL/6J male mice were purchased from Sankyo Labo Service Corporation (Tokyo, Japan) and fed with a standard mouse chow (CRF-1, Charles River, Japan) and water. Most mice used in this study were between 10 and 12 weeks old. For glucose stimulation, d-glucose (WAKO) was injected at a dose of 2.5 g/kg (intraperitoneal). For mTORC1 inhibition, rapamycin (LC Laboratories) was injected twice at a dose of 0.4 mg/kg (intraperitoneal) at 2 h and 16 h before sampling. A similar volume of vehicle was injected as a negative control. For insulin and amino acid administration, mice underwent venous cannulation. On the day before the infusion, a polyethylene catheter was inserted into the right jugular vein under general anesthesia induced by 2,2,2,-tribromoethanol (Avertin®, Sigma). To prevent blood coagulation, the cannula was filled with saline containing heparin (Mochida Pharmaceutical) until the experiment. Insulin and amino acids were administered to conscious mice under non-stressed conditions. All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Tokyo Medical and Dental University (No. 0130093A). Clamp studies were carried out as described previously (25.Kamei N. Tobe K. Suzuki R. Ohsugi M. Watanabe T. Kubota N. Ohtsuka-Kowatari N. Kumagai K. Sakamoto K. Kobayashi M. Yamauchi T. Ueki K.

After starvation for 24 h, a primed continuous infusion of insulin (Humulin R, Lilly) was given (10 or 40 mU/kg/min). The blood glucose concentration was monitored every 5 min, and was maintained at 70–100 mg/dl by administration of 20% d-glucose for 1 h. Blood was sampled via the tail tip at 0, 30, and 60 min for measurement of the blood insulin concentration. For immunoblotting, fresh tissues were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until use. After starvation for 24 h, a primed continuous infusion of an amino acid mixture (Amiparen®, Otsuka Pharmaceutical) was given at various concentrations (9.1, 18.2, and 36.4 mg/kg/min) for 1 h. Somatostatin (Sigma) was infused (7.14 μg/kg/min) simultaneously. Blood was sampled via the tail tip at 0, 30, and 60 min for measurement of plasma insulin and blood glucose levels. For immunoblotting and amino acid assay, fresh tissues were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until use. Plasma insulin was determined using a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit for mouse insulin (Shibayagi). The insulin level during a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp was measured using human insulin as a standard. Mouse tissues were homogenized in 5 volumes of ice-cold 5% sulfosalicylic acid. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, free amino acids in the supernatant were measured using an L8500 amino acid analyzer (Hitachi, Ltd.). Mouse tissues were homogenized in 8 volumes of ice-cold PBS supplemented with 1 mm PMSF, 0.4 mm Na orthovanadate, 0.4 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, and 10 mm Na pyrophosphate. Cells were lysed in a lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 1 mm Na3VO4, and protease inhibitor mixture (complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor, Roche)). The homogenates and cell lysates were centrifuged at 500 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. After quantification of protein concentration by the Bradford method, protein extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Each lane represents a tissue extract from an independent mouse. The amount of protein was quantified using densitometric measurements for each lane with ImageJ software. Antibodies against AKT pS473 (4051), AKT pT308 (9275), AKT (9272), PRAS40 pT246 (2997), S6K1 pT389 (9204), S6 pS235/236 (4856), S6 (2217), 4E-BP1 pS65 (9451), 4E-BP1 (9452), AMPKα pT172 (2535), AMPKα (2532), and ACC pS79 (3661) were purchased from Cell Signaling. Antibodies against α-tubulin (T9026) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Rabbit anti-microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) antibody (NM1) against recombinant rat-LC3B was generated as previously described (27.Quy P.N. Kuma A. Pierre P. Mizushima N. Proteasome-dependent activation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is essential for autophagy suppression and muscle remodeling following denervation.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 1125-1134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). All numerical data represent the mean ± S.E. Statistical comparisons between groups were made using 1-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). To study the physiological modulation of autophagy in vivo, we used a starvation-refeeding system because autophagy is known to be rapidly suppressed by food intake (28.Pfeifer U. Strauss P. Autophagic vacuoles in heart muscle and liver. A comparative morphometric study including circadian variations in meal-fed rats.J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1981; 13: 37-49Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 29.Pfeifer U. Glaumann H. Ballard F.J. Lysosomes: Their role in protein breakdown. Academic Press, London1987: 3-59Google Scholar). C57BL/6J male mice were starved for 24 h, and then refed for 1 h. Feeding increased blood levels of glucose and insulin (Fig. 1A), accompanied by an increase in mTORC1 activity (phosphorylation of S6 kinase, S6, and 4E-BP1) in skeletal muscle and liver (Fig. 1B). The amount of LC3-II, which represents the number of autophagosomes (30.Mizushima N. Yoshimori T. Levine B. Methods in mammalian autophagy research.Cell. 2010; 140: 313-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3531) Google Scholar), decreased in both skeletal muscle and liver during the 1-h refeeding period, confirming that autophagy is suppressed by feeding (Fig. 1B). Phosphorylation of AKT Ser-473 and PRAS40 Thr-246 was also enhanced by feeding in muscle, but not in the liver (Fig. 1B), suggesting that the upstream signaling and/or negative feedback loops are differently activated in muscle and liver. As feeding induced a clear elevation in the blood glucose level, we next determined the role of glucose in autophagy regulation in vivo. Intraperitoneal injection of glucose elevated the blood glucose concentration to a level higher than that of refed mice (Fig. 1A). Insulin secretion was only slightly induced by glucose injection, which may reflect that incretins (intestinal hormones) are important for feeding-induced insulin secretion (31.Nauck M. Stöckmann F. Ebert R. Creutzfeldt W. Reduced incretin effect in type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes.Diabetologia. 1986; 29: 46-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar, 32.Holst J.J. Gromada J. Role of incretin hormones in the regulation of insulin secretion in diabetic and nondiabetic humans.Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; 287: E199-E206Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). After glucose injected in these mice, neither mTORC1 activation nor autophagy suppression was observed in muscle or liver (Fig. 1B). Glucose administration effectively suppressed the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling in muscle; phosphorylation of AMPK and one of its substrates acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) was inhibited by glucose injection as well as by feeding (Fig. 1C). It suggests that glucose was in fact delivered to tissues in vivo. In the liver, both feeding and glucose administration paradoxically activated AMPK by an unknown reason, which may be through an AMP-independent pathway. These results suggest that glucose is not a major regulator of the feeding-induced suppression of autophagy in vivo. Although mTORC1 has been considered to be a master regulator of autophagy, recent studies suggest that there are mTOR-independent regulatory pathways (9.Kroemer G. Mariño G. Levine B. Autophagy and the integrated stress response.Mol. Cell. 2010; 40: 280-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2561) Google Scholar, 17.Mehrpour M. Esclatine A. Beau I. Codogno P. Overview of macroautophagy regulation in mammalian cells.Cell Res. 2010; 20: 748-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). To assess the importance of mTORC1 in autophagy regulation in vivo, we determined the effect of rapamycin, a specific inhibitor of mTOR, in refed mice. Pretreatment with rapamycin abolished feeding-induced phosphorylation of S6K, S6, and 4E-BP1 in both tissues (Fig. 2A). Accordingly, rapamycin treatment inhibited reduction of LC3-II almost completely in the liver (Fig. 2, A and B). Phosphorylation of AKT Ser-473 and Thr-308 were clearly observed in the presence of rapamycin, suggesting that mTOR-S6K-mediated feedback suppression is significant in the liver of refed mice. Rapamycin treatment also suppressed refed-induced LC3-II reduction in muscle of the same animals, but it was partial compared with the vehicle controls. These results confirm that mTOR is indeed a major regulator of autophagy in the liver, and at least partially in muscle. Because it is well known that mTORC1 is regulated by insulin and amino acids, next we determined the effect of insulin on autophagy in vivo. To avoid hypoglycemia and its secondary effects in starved mice, we performed hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp experiments. Using this method, we could maintain constant blood glucose levels within a fasting range, even after insulin administration. When we infused insulin intravenously at 10 mU/kg/min to 24-h starved mice, the blood insulin level increased in a manner similar to that observed in fed mice (Fig. 3A). Infusion of insulin at 40 mU/kg/min increased plasma insulin concentration to a level that was much higher than that of fed mice. In the skeletal muscle of insulin-treated mice (both 10 and 40 mU/kg/min), phosphorylation of AKT, PRAS40, S6K, S6, and 4E-BP1, and reduction of LC3-II, were observed, similar to the changes seen in muscles of fed mice (Fig. 3, B and C). These results suggest that insulin-mTORC1 signaling is sufficient to suppress autophagy induced by food withdrawal. Similarly, phosphorylation of AKT and PRAS40 was observed in the liver of insulin-treated mice. However, even though phosphorylation levels of these molecules were higher than those observed in refed mice, mTORC1 was hardly activated by insulin administration in the liver even at a high dose (40 mU/kg/min) (Fig. 3, B and D). Consistently, LC3-II generation was not significantly inhibited in the liver of these mice (Fig. 3, B and D). These data from the glucose clamp experiments suggest that sensitivity to insulin for autophagy suppression is greater in muscle than in the liver, and that insulin alone can account for feeding-induced autophagy suppression in muscle, but not in the liver. Finally, we determined the effect of amino acids on autophagy suppression in vivo. Intravenous infusion of an amino acid mixture (9.1, 18.2, and 36.4 mg/kg/min) for 1 h successfully elevated the total amino acid concentration both in the liver and muscle (supplemental Figs. S1A and 4A). After amino acid infusion, the level of blood glucose was not changed, but that of insulin was slightly increased (supplemental Fig. S1B). To prevent the endogenous secretion of insulin, somatostatin was simultaneously infused, which suppressed the increase in the blood insulin level during amino acid administration (Fig. 4B). Thus, the effect of these factors could be eliminated in this experiment. Although infusion of amino acids did not activate AKT, it led to activation of mTORC1 only in the liver, but not in muscle; S6K, S6, and 4E-BP1 were phosphorylated only in the liver (Fig. 4, C, D, and E). This effect was opposite to that of insulin. Accordingly, the amount of LC3-II was decreased in the liver but not in muscle (Fig. 4, C, D, and E). Overall, the effect of amino acid administration was similar to that of feeding in the liver. It should be noted that, without the somatostatin treatment, amino acids could partially stimulate mTORC1 even in skeletal muscle (supplemental Fig. S1C). Thus, a small amount of insulin secretion might be able to lead to mTORC1 activation in muscle. These results suggest that sensitivity to amino acids in terms of mTORC1 activation and autophagy suppression is greater in the liver than in muscle, and that amino acids could be the major autophagy regulator in the liver. We have demonstrated that mTORC1 and autophagy are mainly regulated by amino acids in the liver in vivo, whereas they can be regulated by insulin in skeletal muscle. The glucose level does not seem to have a major impact on regulation of mTORC1 and autophagy. The differential roles of insulin and amino acids on mTORC1 and autophagy are generally consistent with those in protein synthesis reported in neonatal pigs; both amino acids and insulin stimulate protein synthesis in the muscle, but only amino acids do in the liver (22.O'Connor P.M. Kimball S.R. Suryawan A. Bush J.A. Nguyen H.V. Jefferson L.S. Davis T.A. Regulation of neonatal liver protein synthesis by insulin and amino acids in pigs.Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol.

Stimulation of protein synthesis by both insulin and amino acids is unique to skeletal muscle in neonatal pigs.Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 282: E880-E890Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). However, we cannot completely rule out any physiological significance of insulin on liver autophagy. In fact, autophagic activity is increased in the liver in streptozotocin-induced type 1 diabetic (insulin-deficient) rodent models (33.Lenk S.E. Bhat D. Blakeney W. Dunn Jr., W.A. Effects of streptozotocin-induced diabetes on rough endoplasmic reticulum and lysosomes of rat liver.Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: E856-E862PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Liu H.Y. Han J. Cao S.Y. Hong T. Zhuo D. Shi J. Liu Z. Cao W. Hepatic autophagy is suppressed in the presence of insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia: inhibition of FoxO1-dependent expression of key autophagy genes by insulin.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 31484-31492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), suggesting that insulin could suppress autophagy in the liver. A possible explanation for this discrepancy is that even though insulin is not critical for acute suppression of autophagy, it could be important for long-term regulation of autophagy, possibly through transcriptional control of some key autophagy genes (34.Liu H.Y. Han J. Cao S.Y. Hong T. Zhuo D. Shi J. Liu Z. Cao W. Hepatic autophagy is suppressed in the presence of insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia: inhibition of FoxO1-dependent expression of key autophagy genes by insulin.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 31484-31492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). How can insulin alone (without amino acid administration) activate mTORC1 and suppress autophagy in the muscle? To be activated, mTORC1 needs to translocate to the lysosomal surface, which is promoted by amino acids and Rag GTPases (13.Zoncu R. Efeyan A. Sabatini D.M. mTOR: from growth signal integration to cancer, diabetes and ageing.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 12: 21-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (3163) Google Scholar, 14.Laplante M. Sabatini D.M. mTOR Signaling in Growth Control and Disease.Cell. 2012; 149: 274-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6136) Google Scholar). One possible mechanism for the amino acid-independent mTORC1 activation in muscle could be that basal levels of intramuscular, but not intrahepatic, amino acids are sufficient for the translocation of mTORC1 to the lysosome even under starvation conditions. We have investigated this possibility by cell fractionation experiments, but did not observe a clear difference in lysosomal localization of the mTORC1 components between the liver and muscle. Another possibility is that insulin signaling may be more profoundly inhibited during starvation in the liver than in muscle, and supplementation of insulin alone may not be enough to activate mTORC1 in the liver. For example, glucagon, one of the major starvation hormones, was shown to reduce mTORC1 activity, which may be high in the liver (35.Kimball S.R. Siegfried B.A. Jefferson L.S. Glucagon represses signaling through the mammalian target of rapamycin in rat liver by activating AMP-activated protein kinase.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54103-54109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 36.Baum J.I. Kimball S.R. Jefferson L.S. Glucagon acts in a dominant manner to repress insulin-induced mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 signaling in perfused rat liver.Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2009; 297: E410-E415Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Future studies will be required to explain the difference between these two organs with regard to mTORC1 regulation. The difference between the liver and muscle in the regulation of the mTORC1-autophagy pathway would be physiologically relevant. In contrast to a highly dynamic change in the blood level of insulin, change in the amino acid level in peripheral blood is small under starvation conditions (37.Palou A. Remesar X. Arola L. Herrera E. Alemany M. Metabolic effects of short term food deprivation in the rat.Horm. Metab. Res. 1981; 13: 326-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, the liver is exceptional, because it receives its blood supply directly from the intestine through the portal vein. The change in the amino acid concentration in plasma from the portal vein is larger than in plasma from the arteries after protein feeding (38.Fafournoux P. Remesy C. Demigne C. Fluxes and membrane transport of amino acids in rat liver under different protein diets.Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: E614-E625PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it would be reasonable to assume that the mTORC1-autophagy pathway is regulated mainly by insulin rather than amino acids in muscle, in which amino acid availability is relatively stable, and by amino acids in the liver, in which amino acid availability is highly changeable. Dependence of autophagy regulation on mTORC1 appears to differ between muscle and liver. Rapamycin completely suppresses the effect of refeeding on autophagy in the liver but not in muscle, even though phosphorylation of mTORC1 substrates was effectively inhibited (Fig. 2), suggesting that an mTORC1-independent pathway plays a significant role in regulation of muscle autophagy. Considering that insulin is the major regulator of muscle autophagy, some signaling pathways other than the mTORC1 pathway may also be important for autophagy regulation downstream of the insulin receptor in muscle. The FoxO3 pathways, which are known to be important for autophagy regulation in muscle (39.Mammucari C. Milan G. Romanello V. Masiero E. Rudolf R. Del Piccolo P. Burden S.J. Di Lisi R. Sandri C.

https://openalex.org/W2058290061,"Explicit comparisons based on the semantic similarity of Gene Ontology terms provide a quantitative way to measure the functional similarity between gene products and are widely applied in large-scale genomic research via integration with other models. Previously, we presented an edge-based method, Relative Specificity Similarity (RSS), which takes the global position of relevant terms into account. However, edge-based semantic similarity metrics are sensitive to the intrinsic structure of GO and simply consider terms at the same level in the ontology to be equally specific nodes, revealing the weaknesses that could be complemented using information content (IC).Here, we used the IC-based nodes to improve RSS and proposed a new method, Hybrid Relative Specificity Similarity (HRSS). HRSS outperformed other methods in distinguishing true protein-protein interactions from false. HRSS values were divided into four different levels of confidence for protein interactions. In addition, HRSS was statistically the best at obtaining the highest average functional similarity among human-mouse orthologs. Both HRSS and the groupwise measure, simGIC, are superior in correlation with sequence and Pfam similarities. Because different measures are best suited for different circumstances, we compared two pairwise strategies, the maximum and the best-match average, in the evaluation. The former was more effective at inferring physical protein-protein interactions, and the latter at estimating the functional conservation of orthologs and analyzing the CESSM datasets. In conclusion, HRSS can be applied to different biological problems by quantifying the functional similarity between gene products. The algorithm HRSS was implemented in the C programming language, which is freely available from http://cmb.bnu.edu.cn/hrss."
https://openalex.org/W2023137063,"Pliosaurids were a long-lived and cosmopolitan group of marine predators that spanned 110 million years and occupied the upper tiers of marine ecosystems from the Middle Jurassic until the early Late Cretaceous. A well-preserved giant pliosaurid skull from the Late Jurassic Kimmeridge Clay Formation of Dorset, United Kingdom, represents a new species, Pliosaurus kevani. This specimen is described in detail, and the taxonomy and systematics of Late Jurassic pliosaurids is revised. We name two additional new species, Pliosaurus carpenteri and Pliosaurus westburyensis, based on previously described relatively complete, well-preserved remains. Most or all Late Jurassic pliosaurids represent a globally distributed monophyletic group (the genus Pliosaurus, excluding ‘Pliosaurus’ andrewsi). Despite its high species diversity, and geographically widespread, temporally extensive occurrence, Pliosaurus shows relatively less morphological and ecological variation than is seen in earlier, multi-genus pliosaurid assemblages such as that of the Middle Jurassic Oxford Clay Formation. It also shows less ecological variation than the pliosaurid-like Cretaceous clade Polycotylidae. Species of Pliosaurus had robust skulls, large body sizes (with skull lengths of 1.7–2.1 metres), and trihedral or subtrihedral teeth suggesting macropredaceous habits. Our data support a trend of decreasing length of the mandibular symphysis through Late Jurassic time, as previously suggested. This may be correlated with increasing adaptation to feeding on large prey. Maximum body size of pliosaurids increased from their first appearance in the Early Jurassic until the Early Cretaceous (skull lengths up to 2360 mm). However, some reduction occurred before their final extinction in the early Late Cretaceous (skull lengths up to 1750 mm)."

Mutations in SUR1 and Kir6.2 that impair channel trafficking to the cell surface lead to loss of channel function and congenital hyperinsulinism. We report that carbamazepine, an anticonvulsant, corrects the trafficking defects of mutant KATP channels previously identified in congenital hyperinsulinism. Strikingly, of the 19 SUR1 mutations examined, only those located in the first transmembrane domain of SUR1 responded to the drug. We show that unlike that reported for several other protein misfolding diseases, carbamazepine did not correct KATP channel trafficking defects by activating autophagy; rather, it directly improved the biogenesis efficiency of mutant channels along the secretory pathway. In addition to its effect on channel trafficking, carbamazepine also inhibited KATP channel activity. Upon subsequent removal of carbamazepine, however, the function of rescued channels was recovered.

The most common causes of the disease are loss-of-function mutations in ABCC8 and KCNJ11, which encode the sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1) 2The abbreviations used are: SUR1sulfonylurea receptor 1CFTRcystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulatorKATPATP-sensitive potassiumKir6.2inwardly rectifying potassium channel 6.2NBDnucleotide binding domainTMDtransmembrane domainERendoplasmic reticulumABCATP-binding cassettetTAtetracycline-inhibited transactivatorm.o.i.multiplicity of infection. and inwardly rectifying potassium channel Kir6.2 subunits of ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels, respectively (2.Dunne M.J.

Mutat. 2006; 27: 220-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In pancreatic β-cells, KATP channels serve as molecular sensors of intracellular ATP/ADP ratios commensurate with glucose metabolism and translate this metabolic signal into changes in β-cell membrane potential to control insulin secretion (5.Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Molecular biology of adenosine triphosphate-sensitive potassium channels.Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 101-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar, 6.Ashcroft F.M.

KATP channels as molecular sensors of cellular metabolism.Nature. 2006; 440: 470-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). When glucose concentrations are low, the ATP/ADP ratio falls, and KATP channels open to keep the β-cell membrane potential hyperpolarized, thus preventing insulin secretion. Failure to open KATP channels due to defects in channel gating and/or expression uncouples β-cell membrane potential from glucose concentrations, resulting in inappropriate insulin secretion in the face of severe hypoglycemia (8.Huopio H.

Although some KATP hyperinsulinism cases are successfully treated with the channel opener diazoxide, in the severe, diffuse form of the disease associated with recessive mutations that prevent channel expression at the cell surface, total or subtotal pancreatectomy is often required (1.Stanley C.A.

Many genetic diseases arise as a result of protein folding and trafficking defects (9.Welch W.J. Role of quality control pathways in human diseases involving protein misfolding.Sem. Cell Dev.

Significant progress has been made in recent years to develop strategies that will correct protein folding and trafficking defects. One clinically promising approach is to identify small molecules that can trigger a cellular response that enhances protein folding capacity or act as specific pharmacological chaperones for the misfolded proteins (for reviews, see Refs. 14.Perlmutter D.H.

In a number of cases, rescued mutant proteins have been shown to be fully or partially functional and thus would be expected to alleviate the disease phenotype. The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) folding mutation ΔF508, the most prevalent mutation underlying cystic fibrosis, is a prominent example (16.Anderson M.P. Welsh M.J.

In most cases, mutant proteins are retained in the ER and rapidly degraded possibly due to folding or assembly defects (28.Crane A. Aguilar-Bryan L.

Sulfonylureas are drugs commonly used to treat type II diabetic patients by binding to the KATP complex and inhibiting channel activity. We have shown previously that these drugs are efficient pharmacological chaperones that correct trafficking defects of a subset of SUR1 mutants (29.Yan F. Lin C.W. Weisiger E. Cartier E.A. Taschenberger G. Shyng S.L. Sulfonylureas correct trafficking defects of ATP-sensitive potassium channels caused by mutations in the sulfonylurea receptor.J. Biol.

Congenital hyperinsulinism associated ABCC8 mutations that cause defective trafficking of ATP-sensitive K+ channels: identification and rescue.Diabetes. 2007; 56: 2339-2348Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Some of the rescued mutants exhibit normal sensitivity to intracellular ATP and MgADP (29.Yan F. Lin C.W. Weisiger E. Cartier E.A. Taschenberger G. Shyng S.L.

Translation of this finding to disease treatment, however, has been hampered by high affinity binding of the most effective chaperone, glibenclamide, to KATP channels and the resulting irreversible inhibitory effect of glibenclamide on channel function. Although a reversible sulfonylurea, tolbutamide, is also effective in correcting KATP channel trafficking defects and can be washed out to recover channel function (29.Yan F. Lin C.W. Weisiger E. Cartier E.A. Taschenberger G. Shyng S.L. Sulfonylureas correct trafficking defects of ATP-sensitive potassium channels caused by mutations in the sulfonylurea receptor.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11096-11105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), this drug has fallen out of favor following the release of the University Group Diabetes Program study, which implicated tolbutamide in increased mortality secondary to cardiovascular events (32.Schwartz T.B.

Oral agents in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus.Am. Fam. Physician. 2001; 63: 1747-1756PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, there is a need to identify additional compounds that can correct KATP channel trafficking defects. SUR1 and CFTR both belong to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter protein superfamily and share structural similarities in the ABC core domain (see Fig. 1A) (34.Higgins C.F. Linton K.J. Structural biology. The xyz of ABC transporters.Science. 2001; 293: 1782-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a number of CFTR proteostasis regulators such as Hsp90 and derlin-1 also play a role in KATP channel regulation (35.Wang F. Olson E.M. Shyng S.L.

We therefore postulate that small molecules effective in rescuing CFTRΔF508 may also correct folding/trafficking defects caused by mutations in SUR1 (39.Sampson H.M. Lam H. Chen P.C. Zhang D. Mottillo C. Mirza M. Qasim K. Shrier A. Shyng S.L. Hanrahan J.W. Thomas D.Y. Compounds that correct F508del-CFTR trafficking can also correct other protein trafficking diseases: an in vitro study using cell lines.Orphanet J. Rare Dis. 2013; 8: 11Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In this study, we focused on a previously identified CFTRΔF508 corrector, carbamazepine (19.Carlile G.W. Robert R. Zhang D. Teske K.A. Luo Y. Hanrahan J.W. Thomas D.Y. Correctors of protein trafficking defects identified by a novel high-throughput screening assay.Chembiochem. 2007; 8: 1012-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), because it is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of epilepsy and bipolar disorder and has an established biosafety profile. In addition, carbamazepine has recently been shown to alleviate liver disease in mice expressing the folding mutant α1-antitrypsin Z (40.Hidvegi T. Ewing M. Hale P. Dippold C. Beckett C. Kemp C. Maurice N. Mukherjee A. Goldbach C. Watkins S. Michalopoulos G. Perlmutter D.H.

Jimenez-Sanchez M. Sarkar S. Rubinsztein D.C. Chemical inducers of autophagy that enhance the clearance of mutant proteins in neurodegenerative diseases.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 11061-11067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) by activating the autophagic pathway. Herein we report that carbamazepine improves the processing and surface expression of a subset of 19 previously identified SUR1 trafficking mutants. Strikingly, of the mutations that were responsive to carbamazepine, all are located in the N-terminal transmembrane domain of SUR1, a domain involved in physical and functional coupling to the pore-forming subunit Kir6.2 (42.Babenko A.P. Bryan J. SUR domains that associate with and gate KATP pores define a novel gatekeeper.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41577-41580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 43.Chan K.W. Zhang H. Logothetis D.E. N-terminal transmembrane domain of the SUR controls trafficking and gating of Kir6 channel subunits.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3833-3843Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Carbamazepine corrected surface expression of mutant channels by enhancing the processing efficiency of newly synthesized SUR1 independently of autophagy. In addition to its corrector effect, carbamazepine inhibited KATP channel activity in isolated membrane patches, suggesting that the drug may interact with the channel complex. This channel inhibition was reversible, and functional recovery of mutant channels rescued to the cell surface could be achieved upon washout of carbamazepine and enhanced by the KATP channel opener diazoxide. In rat insulinoma cells and human β-cells, carbamazepine similarly corrected mutant channel trafficking defects and restored KATP currents. Our findings identify KATP channels as a novel target for carbamazepine and have significant therapeutic implications for a subset of congenital hyperinsulinism patients. SUR1 was tagged with a FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) at the extracellular N terminus (referred to as f-SUR1), and the cDNA was cloned into the pECE vector. We have shown in previous studies that these epitope tags do not affect the trafficking or function of the channels (44.Cartier E.A. Conti L.R. Vandenberg C.A. Shyng S.L.

The f-SUR1 recombinant adenovirus was made using a modified pShuttle plasmid (AdEasy kit, Stratagene) containing a tetracycline-inducible promoter and requires co-infection of a virus carrying the cDNA encoding a tetracycline-inhibited transactivator (tTA) for expression. Recombinant viruses were amplified in HEK293 cells and purified according to the manufacturer's instructions. INS-1 cell clone 832/13 (kindly provided by Dr. Christopher Newgard) was plated in 10-cm plates and cultured for 24 h in RPMI 1640 medium with 11.1 mm d-glucose (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol (47.Hohmeier H.E.

Human islets with 80–95% purity and 80–95% viability were obtained through the Integrated Islets Distribution Program. Islets received were maintained overnight in INS-1 growth medium as described above minus penicillin and streptomycin. m.o.i. calculations assumed 2000 cells per islet equivalent (as defined by the Integrated Islets Distribution Program) (48.Kapturczak M.

The islets were then incubated for an additional 24 h in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% FBS containing either DMSO, glibenclamide, or carbamazepine before being harvested for immunoblotting. For electrophysiological experiments, human islets were dissociated into single or groups of cells by trituration in a solution containing 116 mm NaCl, 5.5 mm d-glucose, 3 mm EGTA, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), pH 7.4. Dissociated cells were spun down and plated on gelatin (0.4%)-coated coverslips at least 3–4 h prior to infection with adenoviruses as described above for INS-1 cells. COSm6 cells (transfected with SUR1 and Kir6.2 cDNAs using FuGENE® 6 according to the manufacturer's instructions), INS-1 cells, or human islets (control or transduced with recombinant adenoviruses) were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100 with CompleteTM protease inhibitors) on ice for 30 min. Cell lysate was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and an aliquot of the supernatant was run on SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was probed with a mouse anti-FLAG (Sigma) monoclonal antibody or a rabbit anti-SUR1 serum raised against a C-terminal peptide of SUR1 (KDSVFASFVRADK) followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Super Signal West Femto, Pierce). Tubulin was also probed and served as a loading control. Transfected COSm6 cells were placed on ice and washed twice with cold PBS. Cells were then incubated with 1 mg/ml EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (sulfosuccinimidyl-2-[biotinamido]ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate; Pierce) in PBS for 30 min on ice for biotinylation of surface proteins. The reaction was terminated by incubating cells with 20 mm glycine in PBS for 10 min on ice followed by three washes with cold PBS. Cells were then lysed immediately in 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer. Cell lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C.

https://openalex.org/W2118523229,"Blue native gel electrophoresis is a popular method for the determination of the oligomeric state of membrane proteins. Studies using this technique have reported that mitochondrial carriers are dimeric (composed of two ∼32-kDa monomers) and, in some cases, can form physiologically relevant associations with other proteins. Here, we have scrutinized the behavior of the yeast mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier AAC3 in blue native gels. We find that the apparent mass of AAC3 varies in a detergent- and lipid-dependent manner (from ∼60 to ∼130 kDa) that is not related to changes in the oligomeric state of the protein, but reflects differences in the associated detergent-lipid micelle and Coomassie Blue G-250 used in this technique. Higher oligomeric state species are only observed under less favorable solubilization conditions, consistent with aggregation of the protein. Calibration with an artificial covalent AAC3 dimer indicates that the mass observed for solubilized AAC3 and other mitochondrial carriers corresponds to a monomer. Size exclusion chromatography of purified AAC3 in dodecyl maltoside under blue native gel-like conditions shows that the mass of the monomer is ∼120 kDa, but appears smaller on gels (∼60 kDa) due to the unusually high amount of bound negatively charged dye, which increases the electrophoretic mobility of the protein-detergent-dye micelle complex. Our results show that bound lipid, detergent, and Coomassie stain alter the behavior of mitochondrial carriers on gels, which is likely to be true for other small membrane proteins where the associated lipid-detergent micelle is large when compared with the mass of the protein."

Here, we determined the effects of Hetα1KO on the expression and physiology of GABAARs in the mouse cortex. We found that Hetα1KO caused modest reductions in the total and surface expression of the β2 subunit but did not alter β1 or β3 subunit expression, results consistent with a small reduction of GABAARs. Cortices partially compensated for Hetα1KO by increasing the fraction of residual α1 subunit on the cell surface and by increasing total and surface expression of α3, but not α2, subunits. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that Hetα1KO increased the fraction of α1 subunits, and decreased the fraction of α3 subunits, that associated in hybrid α1α3βγ receptors. Patch clamp electrophysiology studies showed that Hetα1KO layer VI cortical neurons exhibited reduced inhibitory postsynaptic current peak amplitudes, prolonged current rise and decay times, and altered responses to benzodiazepine agonists. Finally, application of inhibitors of dynamin-mediated endocytosis revealed that Hetα1KO reduced base-line GABAAR endocytosis, an effect that probably contributes to the observed changes in GABAAR expression. These findings demonstrate that Hetα1KO exerts two principle disinhibitory effects on cortical GABAAR-mediated inhibitory neurotransmission: 1) a modest reduction of GABAAR number and 2) a partial compensation with GABAAR isoforms that possess physiological properties different from those of the otherwise predominant α1βγ GABAARs.Background: Heterozygous GABRA1 deletion causes absence epilepsy.Results: The deletion modestly decreased cortical GABAA receptor number but also reduced the rate of receptor endocytosis and thus partially compensated for the deletion by increasing the expression of different receptor isoforms.Conclusion: Heterozygous GABRA1 deletion caused novel alterations in cortical GABAA receptor expression and physiology.Significance: These findings reveal mechanisms of cortical disinhibition in absence epilepsy.

https://openalex.org/W1966762483,"RGM Proteins Members of the repulsive guidance molecule (RGM) family of proteins can be secreted or reside on the surface of cells where they bind to the cell surface receptor, neogenin. The RGM proteins are named for their role in axon guidance for developing neurons, but their function is also linked to a range of human diseases, including inflammation, multiple sclerosis, and cancer. Bell et al. (p. 77 ) solved the crystal structures of the external portions of the RGMB protein with portions of neogenin. The structures revealed interactions of dimers of RGMB with neogenin in which ligand binding induced conformational changes that may initiate intracellular signaling from the receptor. RGM proteins contain a site of autocatalytic cleavage that affects secretion of the proteins, and some disease-associated mutations in RGM proteins were clustered at this site."
https://openalex.org/W2080095784,"For the pending National Claims Database in Japan, researchers will not have access to death information in the enrollment files. We developed and evaluated a claims-based definition of death.We used healthcare claims and enrollment data between January 2005 and August 2009 for 195,193 beneficiaries aged 20 to 74 in 3 private health insurance unions. We developed claims-based definitions of death using discharge or disease status and Charlson comorbidity index (CCI). We calculated sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive values (PPVs) using the enrollment data as a gold standard in the overall population and subgroups divided by demographic and other factors. We also assessed bias and precision in two example studies where an outcome was death. The definition based on the combination of discharge/disease status and CCI provided moderate sensitivity (around 60%) and high specificity (99.99%) and high PPVs (94.8%). In most subgroups, sensitivity of the preferred definition was also around 60% but varied from 28 to 91%. In an example study comparing death rates between two anticancer drug classes, the claims-based definition provided valid and precise hazard ratios (HRs). In another example study comparing two classes of anti-depressants, the HR with the claims-based definition was biased and had lower precision than that with the gold standard definition.The claims-based definitions of death developed in this study had high specificity and PPVs while sensitivity was around 60%. The definitions will be useful in future studies when used with attention to the possible fluctuation of sensitivity in some subpopulations."

https://openalex.org/W2000067057,"Regulation of transcriptionally active nuclear β-catenin during the Wnt-on phase is crucial to ensure controlled induction of Wnt target genes. Several ubiquitin E3 ligases are known to regulate cytosolic β-catenin during the Wnt-off phase, but little is known about the fate of active nuclear β-catenin in the Wnt-on phase. We now describe ubiquitination of active β-catenin in the Wnt-on phase by a RING finger ubiquitin E3 ligase, Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (c-Cbl) in endothelial cells. c-Cbl binds preferentially to nuclearly active β-catenin in the Wnt-on phase via the armadillo repeat region. Wild-type c-Cbl suppresses and E3 ligase-deficient c-Cbl-70Z increases Wnt signaling. Wnt induces nuclear translocation of c-Cbl where it ubiquitinates nuclear β-catenin. Deletion of the c-Cbl UBA domain abrogates its dimerization, binding to β-catenin, Wnt-induced c-Cbl nuclear translocation, and ubiquitination of nuclear β-catenin. c-Cbl activity inhibits pro-angiogenic Wnt targets IL-8 and VEGF levels and angiogenesis in a β-catenin-dependent manner. This study defines for the first time c-Cbl as a ubiquitin E3 ligase that targets nuclearly active β-catenin in the Wnt-on phase and uncovers a novel layer of regulation of Wnt signaling."

https://openalex.org/W2032960995,"Although Parkinson disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, available animal models do not exhibit irreversible neurodegeneration, and this is a major obstacle in finding out an effective drug against this disease. Here we delineate a new irreversible model to study PD pathogenesis. The model is based on simple castration of young male mice. Levels of inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS), glial markers (glial fibrillary acidic protein and CD11b), and α-synuclein were higher in nigra of castrated male mice than normal male mice. On the other hand, after castration, the level of glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) markedly decreased in the nigra of male mice. Accordingly, castration also induced the loss of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons in the nigra and decrease in tyrosine hydroxylase-positive fibers and neurotransmitters in the striatum. Reversal of nigrostriatal pathologies in castrated male mice by subcutaneous implantation of 5α-dihydrotestosterone pellets validates an important role of male sex hormone in castration-induced nigrostriatal pathology. Interestingly, castration was unable to cause glial activation, decrease nigral GDNF, augment the death of nigral dopaminergic neurons, induce the loss of striatal fibers, and impair neurotransmitters in iNOS(-/-) male mice. Furthermore, we demonstrate that iNOS-derived NO is responsible for decreased expression of GDNF in activated astrocytes. Together, our results suggest that castration induces nigrostriatal pathologies via iNOS-mediated decrease in GDNF. These results are important because castrated young male mice may be used as a simple, toxin-free, and nontransgenic animal model to study PD-related nigrostriatal pathologies, paving the way for easy drug screening against PD."
https://openalex.org/W2025910005,"The present study was performed to investigate the associations between eye-blink behaviors and various other factors in primates. We video-recorded 141 individuals across 71 primate species and analyzed the blink rate, blink duration, and ""isolated"" blink ratio (i.e., blinks without eye or head movement) in relation to activity rhythms, habitat types, group size, and body size factors. The results showed close relationships between three types of eye-blink measures and body size factors. All of these measures increased as a function of body weight. In addition, diurnal primates showed more blinks than nocturnal species even after controlling for body size factors. The most important findings were the relationships between eye-blink behaviors and social factors, e.g., group size. Among diurnal primates, only the blink rate was significantly correlated even after controlling for body size factors. The blink rate increased as the group size increased. Enlargement of the neocortex is strongly correlated with group size in primate species and considered strong evidence for the social brain hypothesis. Our results suggest that spontaneous eye-blinks have acquired a role in social communication, similar to grooming, to adapt to complex social living during primate evolution."

This ability is retained for line drawings, demonstrating that critical information is concentrated at object boundaries. Information theoretic studies argue for further concentration at points of maximum curvature, or corners, on such boundaries [1]-[3] suggesting that the relative positions of such corners might be important in defining shape. In this study we use patterns subtly deformed from circular, by a sinusoidal modulation of radius, in order to measure threshold sensitivity to shape change. By examining the ability of observers to discriminate between patterns of different frequency and/or number of cycles of modulation in a 2x2 forced choice task we were able to show, psychophysically, that difference in a single cue, the periodicity of the corners (specifically the polar angle between two points of maximum curvature) was sufficient to allow discrimination of two patterns near their thresholds for detection. We conclude that patterns could be considered as labelled for this measure. These results suggest that a small number of such labels might be sufficient to identify an object."

In this study, we examined the role of the downstream Ca2+ target calcineurin on NF-κB translocation. Freshly isolated mouse acinar cells were infected for 24 h with an adenovirus expressing an NF-κB luciferase reporter. The bile acid taurolithocholic acid-3-sulfate caused NF-κB activation at concentrations (500 μm) that were associated with cell injury.

https://openalex.org/W2008596564,"Upregulation of the proto-oncogene Twist1 is highly correlated with acquired drug resistance and poor prognosis in human cancers. Altered expression of this multifunctional transcription factor is also associated with inherited skeletal malformations. The mammalian Twist1 3′UTRs are highly conserved and contain a number of potential regulatory elements including miRNA target sites. We analyzed the translational regulation of TWIST1 using luciferase reporter assays in a variety of cell lines. Among several miRNAs tested, miR-145a-5p, miR-151-5p and a combination of miR-145a-5p + miR-151-5p and miR-151-5p + miR-337-3p were able to significantly repress Twist1 translation. This phenomena was confirmed with both exogenous and endogenous miRNAs and was dependent on the presence of the predicted target sites in the 3′UTR. Furthermore, the repression was sensitive to LNA-modified miRNA antagonists and resulted in decreased migratory potential of murine embryonic fibroblast cells. Understanding the in vivo mechanisms of this oncogene's regulation might open up a possibility for therapeutic interference by gene specific cancer therapies."
https://openalex.org/W1974117309,"Background Acute kidney injury (AKI) requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT) in critically ill patients results in a high hospital mortality. Outcome prediction in this selected high-risk collective is challenging due to the lack of appropriate biomarkers. The aim of this study was to identify outcome-specific biomarkers in this patient population. Methodology/Principal Findings Serum samples were collected from 101 critically ill patients with AKI at the initiation of RRT in intensive care units (ICUs) of a tertiary care university hospital between August 2008 and March 2011. Measurements of serum levels of cystatin C (CysC), neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, and interleukin-18 (IL-18) were performed. The primary outcome measure was hospital mortality. The observed overall mortality rate was 56.4% (57/101). Multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that the serum IL-18 and CysC concentrations and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation III (ACPACHE III) scores determined on the first day of RRT were independent predictors of hospital mortality. The APACHE III score had the best discriminatory power (0.872±0.041, p<0.001), whereas serum IL-18 had the best Youden index (0.65) and the highest correctness of prediction (83%). Cumulative survival rates at 6-month follow-up following hospital discharge differed significantly (p<0.001) for serum IL-18 <1786 pg/ml vs. ≥1786 pg/ml in these critically ill patients. Conclusions In this study, we confirmed the grave prognosis for critically ill patients at the commencement of RRT and found a strong correlation between serum IL-18 and the hospital mortality of ICU patients with dialysis-dependent AKI. In addition, we demonstrated that the APACHE III score has the best discriminative power for predicting hospital mortality in these critically ill patients."

Cleavage liberates intracellularly sequestered GLUT4 glucose transporters for translocation to the cell surface. To test the role of this regulation in muscle, we used mice with muscle-specific transgenic expression of a truncated TUG fragment, UBX-Cter. This fragment causes GLUT4 translocation in unstimulated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. We predicted that transgenic mice would have GLUT4 translocation in muscle during fasting. UBX-Cter expression caused depletion of PIST (PDZ domain protein interacting specifically with TC10), which transmits an insulin signal to TUG. Whereas insulin stimulated TUG proteolysis in control muscles, proteolysis was constitutive in transgenic muscles. Fasting transgenic mice had decreased plasma glucose and insulin concentrations compared with controls. Whole-body glucose turnover was increased during fasting but not during hyperinsulinemic clamp studies. In muscles with the greatest UBX-Cter expression, 2-deoxyglucose uptake during fasting was similar to that in control muscles during hyperinsulinemic clamp studies. Fasting transgenic mice had increased muscle glycogen, and GLUT4 targeting to T-tubule fractions was increased 5.7-fold. Whole-body oxygen consumption (VO2), carbon dioxide production (VCO2), and energy expenditure were increased by 12–13%. After 3 weeks on a high fat diet, the decreased fasting plasma glucose in transgenic mice compared with controls was more marked, and increased glucose turnover was not observed; the transgenic mice continued to have an increased metabolic rate. We conclude that insulin stimulates TUG proteolysis to translocate GLUT4 in muscle, that this pathway impacts systemic glucose homeostasis and energy metabolism, and that the effects of activating this pathway are maintained during high fat diet-induced insulin resistance in mice.Background: Insulin stimulates endoproteolytic cleavage of TUG proteins to promote glucose uptake in cultured adipocytes, but the role of this pathway in muscle is uncharacterized.Results: Transgenic mice with constitutive and unregulated TUG cleavage in muscle had increased whole-body and muscle-specific glucose uptake during fasting.Conclusion: Insulin acts through TUG to control glucose uptake in muscle.Significance: Understanding insulin action will elucidate diabetes pathogenesis.

However, the trafficking pathways and biochemical mechanisms that regulate GLUT4 targeting remain poorly understood. Our previous data support a model in which insulin acts to relieve a negative regulator of glucose uptake. In unstimulated cells, GLUT4 accumulates in intracellular vesicles termed “GLUT4 storage vesicles” (GSVs), which sequester the transporters away from the cell surface (9.Rubin B.R. Bogan J.S. Intracellular retention and insulin-stimulated mobilization of GLUT4 glucose transporters.Vitam. Horm. 2009; 80: 155-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 10.Bogan J.S. Kandror K.V. Biogenesis and regulation of insulin-responsive vesicles containing GLUT4.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2010; 22: 506-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Best described in adipocytes, GSVs lack endosome and Golgi marker proteins and are mobilized acutely by insulin stimulation. We identified TUG as a GLUT4-regulating protein and proposed that it traps GSVs intracellularly in unstimulated adipocytes (11.Bogan J.S. Hendon N. McKee A.E. Tsao T.S. Lodish H.F. Functional cloning of TUG as a regulator of GLUT4 glucose transporter trafficking.Nature. 2003; 425: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Insulin releases these vesicles from TUG to promote GLUT4 translocation. Data from 3T3-L1 adipocytes show that this mechanism is a major site of insulin action to regulate GLUT4 trafficking and glucose uptake (12.Yu C. Cresswell J. Löffler M.G. Bogan J.S.

During continuous insulin exposure, GLUT4 is carried to the surface in vesicles distinct from those mobilized by acute insulin stimulation, and the GSV compartment is bypassed (13.Xu Y. Rubin B.R.

Molecular basis of insulin-responsive GLUT4 trafficking systems revealed by single molecule imaging.Traffic. 2011; 12: 1805-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The model described above is based primarily on work in cultured cells, and until now its relevance in skeletal muscle in vivo has not been tested. Insulin stimulates the dissociation of TUG-GLUT4 complexes in muscle as in fat (26.Schertzer J.D. Antonescu C.N. Bilan P.J. Jain S. Huang X. Liu Z. Bonen A. Klip A. A transgenic mouse model to study glucose transporter 4myc regulation in skeletal muscle.Endocrinology. 2009; 150: 1935-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Moreover, TUG and GLUT4 abundances correlate across diverse muscle types possibly because TUG controls the stability as well as targeting of GLUT4 proteins (12.Yu C. Cresswell J. Löffler M.G. Bogan J.S. The glucose transporter 4-regulating protein TUG is essential for highly insulin-responsive glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.J. Biol.

Physiol. 2011; 111: 1106-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Here, we studied the role of TUG to control GLUT4 localization and glucose uptake in muscle. We used a skeletal muscle-specific promoter to express a dominant negative fragment of TUG, UBX-Cter, in transgenic mice. This truncated protein inhibits the ability of endogenous intact TUG protein to sequester GLUT4 at the Golgi matrix. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, the UBX-Cter protein causes GLUT4 translocation and glucose uptake in the absence of insulin stimulation, mimicking the effects of insulin or of TUG RNAi (12.Yu C. Cresswell J. Löffler M.G. Bogan J.S. The glucose transporter 4-regulating protein TUG is essential for highly insulin-responsive glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 7710-7722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Data herein show that UBX-Cter similarly caused GLUT4 translocation and glucose uptake in muscle during the fasting state in vivo. Intriguingly, expression of UBX-Cter caused depletion of PIST and mimicked insulin action to stimulate endoproteolysis of the endogenous TUG protein in muscle. The transgenic mice had increases in both whole-body glucose turnover and overall metabolic rate. Finally, aspects of this phenotype were maintained in the setting of high fat diet (HFD)-induced insulin resistance in mice. Together with previous work, our data support the idea that similar mechanisms control GLUT4 in muscle and adipose and identify a critical node for the control of whole-body glucose homeostasis. Transgenic mTUGUBX-Cter mice were generated by cloning the cDNA sequence for a truncated murine TUG protein, UBX-Cter (residues 377–550), after a 1.3-kb segment derived from the mouse muscle creatine kinase promoter (−1256MCK-3Emut) (28.Jaynes J.B.

Following the coding sequence, a 2.2-kb segment of the human growth hormone gene was used to provide splice sites and polyadenylation and termination signals. The transgene was microinjected into SJL × C57BL/6 F2 fertilized oocytes, which were implanted in pseudopregnant females. Founder pups were identified by PCR of tail biopsies for a 171-bp segment of the human growth hormone sequence. Of 12 transgenic lines obtained, three were selected for further analysis. Preliminary analyses indicated that the phenotype was most robust in the line with greatest expression of the transgene, and this line was backcrossed at least 10 generations onto C57BL/6 (The Jackson Laboratory) and used in the heterozygous state for all analyses presented here. Male mice were used to avoid confounding effects of estrous cycles, and controls were age-matched, wild type mice (usually nontransgenic littermates). Mice were maintained in the Yale Animal Resources Center on a standard 12-h light/12-h dark cycle and were given ad libitum access to chow (Harlan-Teklad 2018, 5% calories from fat) and water unless otherwise stated. For studies using an HFD, mice were fed Harlan-Teklad TD93075 (55% calories from fat) for 3 weeks prior to experiments. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees at Yale University and the University of Michigan approved all procedures. For genotyping, DNA was extracted from ear punch or tail biopsies using a DNeasy kit (Qiagen). Both human growth hormone and transgene insertion site-specific primers were used for PCR. Tissues were collected from isoflurane-anesthetized mice after cervical dislocation, frozen in liquid N2, and stored at −80 °C until further analysis. For blood glucose measurements, plasma was collected in EDTA and analyzed using a Beckman Glucose Analyzer II (Beckman Coulter). Plasma insulin was measured in duplicate using an ultrasensitive ELISA (ALPCO Diagnostics). Plasma lactate was measured in duplicate using a lactate kit (Trinity Biotech, Wicklow, Ireland). All other plasma and serum analyses were done on a Roche Applied Science COBAS Mira Plus automated chemistry analyzer. Tissue glycogen was determined using a glycogen assay kit (Biovision, Mountain View, CA). To measure glucose turnover and uptake in the fasting state, we omitted the insulin infusion during our standard glucose-insulin clamp protocol (32.Jurczak M.J. Lee A.H. Jornayvaz F.R. Lee H.Y.

Mice with an indwelling catheter in the right jugular vein were fasted overnight, and then 3-[3H]glucose (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was infused at 0.05 μCi/min for 120 min to determine basal glucose turnover. Next, to measure muscle-specific glucose uptake, 10 μCi of 2-deoxy-d-[1-14C]glucose (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was infused over 20 min. No insulin was infused, and care was taken to minimize the increase in plasma glucose, which would stimulate secretion of endogenous insulin. Blood samples were drawn by tail vein at 2, 5, 15, 25, 35, 45, and 55 min after the initiation of this 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2DOG) infusion. At study completion, mice were anesthetized with an intravenous pentobarbital sodium injection (150 mg/kg).

Mice were fasted for 4–6 h or overnight as specified and then treated by intraperitoneal injection of insulin (8 units/kg) and glucose (1 g/kg) or an equivalent volume (0.3 ml) of phosphate-buffered saline. After 30 min, mice were anesthetized and sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Tissues were excised, snap frozen in liquid N2, and stored at −80 °C. Tissues were homogenized in ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (37.Bogan J.S. McKee A.E. Lodish H.F.

https://openalex.org/W2150370326,"In osteoclasts, Src controls podosome organization and bone degradation, which leads to an osteopetrotic phenotype in src(-/-) mice. Since this phenotype was even more severe in src(-/-)hck(-/-) mice, we examined the individual contribution of Hck in bone homeostasis. Compared to wt mice, hck(-/-) mice exhibited an osteopetrotic phenotype characterized by an increased density of trabecular bone and decreased bone degradation, although osteoclastogenesis was not impaired. Podosome organization and matrix degradation were found to be defective in hck(-/-) osteoclast precursors (preosteoclast) but were normal in mature hck(-/-) osteoclasts, probably through compensation by Src, which was specifically overexpressed in mature osteoclasts. As a consequence of podosome defects, the 3-dimensional migration of hck(-/-) preosteoclasts was strongly affected in vitro. In vivo, this translated by altered bone homing of preosteoclasts in hck(-/-) mice: in metatarsals of 1-wk-old mice, when bone formation strongly depends on the recruitment of these cells, reduced numbers of osteoclasts and abnormal developing trabecular bone were observed. This phenotype was still detectable in adults. In summmary, Hck is one of the very few effectors of preosteoclast recruitment described to date and thereby plays a critical role in bone remodeling."

Here we demonstrate that canonical microRNAs (miRNAs) are required for Treg function because mice with DGCR8-deficient Treg cells spontaneously develop a scurfy-like disease. Using genetic lineage marking we show that absence of miRNAs leads to reduced FoxP3 expression in Treg cells in vivo. In vitro culture of purified DGCR8-deficient Treg leads to a loss of FoxP3 expression. We conclude that canonical miRNAs are essential to maintain stable FoxP3 expression and Treg function. Thus, signals interfering with miRNA homeostasis might contribute to autoimmune diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2082779210,"Using brain surgery, specific areas in the brain can be stimulated with electrical impulses to reversibly change their activity and alleviate symptoms related to mental illnesses. This so-called deep brain stimulation and other methodological advances that even more selectively activate specific groups of neurons can give us clues as to what neural circuitry is involved in a particular mental disorder and whether therapeutic activation of these brain areas and neurons may be effective. In 'Bedside to Bench', Eric Nestler discusses two trials of individuals with anorexia nervosa in which deep brain stimulation of different brain areas resulted in improvement of behavioral domains associated with the syndrome. The results and potential of this technique in animals and humans may bring us closer to understanding the neurobiology of anorexia nervosa, which still remains a mystery and poses a challenge for treatment. In 'Bench to Bedside', Jennifer Warner-Schmidt peruses recent findings that uncover the functional connectivity of brain regions involved in depression and how activation of cortical regions can result in antidepressant effects that can compensate for the malfunction of other brain circuits that results in depression."

There are now proposed revisions under consideration that will provide additional protection for study participants as well as increased clarity regarding the responsibilities of those conducting the research. Making these changes is important in a complex environment where what is ethical is not always self-evident."

https://openalex.org/W2003520403,"α1-Protease inhibitor Portland (α1PDX) is an engineered serpin family inhibitor of the proprotein convertase (PC), furin, that exhibits high specificity but limited selectivity for inhibiting furin over other PC family proteases. Here, we characterize serpin B8, a natural inhibitor of furin, together with α1PDX-serpin B8 and furin-PC chimeras to identify determinants of serpin specificity and selectivity for furin inhibition. Replacing reactive center loop (RCL) sequences of α1PDX with those of serpin B8 demonstrated that both the P4-P1 RXXR recognition sequence as well as the P1'-P5' sequence are critical determinants of serpin specificity for furin. Alignments of PC catalytic domains revealed four variable active-site loops whose role in furin reactivity with serpin B8 was tested by engineering furin-PC loop chimeras. The furin(298-300) loop but not the other loops differentially affected furin reactivity with serpin B8 and α1PDX in a manner that depended on the serpin RCL-primed sequence. Modeling of the serpin B8-furin Michaelis complex identified serpin exosites in strand 3C close to the 298-300 loop whose substitution in α1PDX differentially affected furin reactivity depending on the furin loop and serpin RCL-primed sequences. These studies demonstrate that RCL-primed residues, strand 3C exosites, and the furin(298-300) loop are critical determinants of serpin reactivity with furin, which may be exploited in the design of specific and selective α1PDX inhibitors of PCs."
https://openalex.org/W2023177531,"The HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) gp41 plays a crucial role in the viral fusion process. The peptides derived from the C-terminal heptad repeat (CHR) of gp41 are potent HIV fusion inhibitors. However, the activity of these anti-HIV-1 peptides in vivo may be attenuated by their induction of anti-gp41 antibodies. Thus, it is essential to identify antiviral peptides or proteins with low, or no, immunogenicity to humans. Here, we found that the C-terminal fragment (aa 462–521) of the human POB1 (the partner of RalBP1), designated C60, is an HIV-1 fusion inhibitor. It bound to N36, the peptide derived from the N-terminal heptad repeat (NHR) of gp41, and to the six-helix bundle (6-HB) formed by N36 and C34, a CHR-peptide, but it did not bind to C34. Unlike the CHR-peptides, C60 did not block gp41 6-HB formation. Rather, results suggest that C60 inhibits HIV-1 fusion by binding to the 6-HB, in particular, the residues in the gp41 NHR domain that are exposed on the surface of 6-HB. Since 6-HB plays a crucial role in the late stage of fusion between the viral envelope and endosomal membrane during the endocytic process of HIV-1, C60 may serve as a host restriction factor to suppress HIV-1 entry into CD4+ T lymphocytes. Taken together, it can be concluded from these results that C60 can be used as a lead for the development of anti-HIV-1 therapeutics or microbicides for the treatment and prevention of HIV-1 infection, as well as a molecular probe to study the fusogenic mechanism of HIV-1."
