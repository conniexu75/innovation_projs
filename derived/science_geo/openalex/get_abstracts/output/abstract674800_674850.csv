https://openalex.org/W3164002264,"BNT162b2, a nucleoside-modified mRNA formulated in lipid nanoparticles that encodes the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S) stabilized in its prefusion conformation, has demonstrated 95% efficacy in preventing COVID-191. Here we extend a previous phase-I/II trial report2 by presenting data on the immune response induced by BNT162b2 prime-boost vaccination from an additional phase-I/II trial in healthy adults (18-55 years old). BNT162b2 elicited strong antibody responses: at one week after the boost, SARS-CoV-2 serum geometric mean 50% neutralizing titres were up to 3.3-fold above those observed in samples from individuals who had recovered from COVID-19. Sera elicited by BNT162b2 neutralized 22 pseudoviruses bearing the S of different SARS-CoV-2 variants. Most participants had a strong response of IFNγ+ or IL-2+ CD8+ and CD4+ T helper type 1 cells, which was detectable throughout the full observation period of nine weeks following the boost. Using peptide-MHC multimer technology, we identified several BNT162b2-induced epitopes that were presented by frequent MHC alleles and conserved in mutant strains. One week after the boost, epitope-specific CD8+ T cells of the early-differentiated effector-memory phenotype comprised 0.02-2.92% of total circulating CD8+ T cells and were detectable (0.01-0.28%) eight weeks later. In summary, BNT162b2 elicits an adaptive humoral and poly-specific cellular immune response against epitopes that are conserved in a broad range of variants, at well-tolerated doses."

Experimental reports, however, remain scarce because of the requirement of a layered polar crystal. Here, we demonstrate a rational design approach to engineering 2D ferroelectrics from a non-ferroelectric parent compound via employing van der Waals assembly. Parallel-stacked bilayer boron nitride is shown to exhibit out-of-plane electric polarization that reverses depending on the stacking order. The polarization switching is probed via the resistance of an adjacently-stacked graphene sheet. Furthermore, twisting the boron nitride sheets by a small-angle changes the dynamics of switching due to the formation of moir\'e ferroelectricity with staggered polarization. The ferroelectricity persists to room temperature while keeping the high mobility of graphene, paving the way for potential ultrathin nonvolatile memory applications."
https://openalex.org/W3163970933,"We present a global atlas of 4,728 metagenomic samples from mass-transit systems in 60 cities over 3 years, representing the first systematic, worldwide catalog of the urban microbial ecosystem. This atlas provides an annotated, geospatial profile of microbial strains, functional characteristics, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) markers, and genetic elements, including 10,928 viruses, 1,302 bacteria, 2 archaea, and 838,532 CRISPR arrays not found in reference databases. We identified 4,246 known species of urban microorganisms and a consistent set of 31 species found in 97% of samples that were distinct from human commensal organisms. Profiles of AMR genes varied widely in type and density across cities. Cities showed distinct microbial taxonomic signatures that were driven by climate and geographic differences. These results constitute a high-resolution global metagenomic atlas that enables discovery of organisms and genes, highlights potential public health and forensic applications, and provides a culture-independent view of AMR burden in cities."
https://openalex.org/W3164567439,"Organismal evolution of the 3D genome The conformation of chromosomes within the nucleus can reflect a cell's type or state. However, studies of the conservation and evolutionary history of the mechanisms regulating genome structure across species are lacking. Hoencamp et al. mapped three-dimensional (3D) genome organization in 24 eukaryote species, including animals, fungi, and plants. At interphase, species' telomeres and centromeres either clustered across chromosomes or oriented in a polarized state maintaining individual chromosomal territories within the cell, a difference attributed to condensin II. An experimental loss of condensin II in human cells promotes the formation of centromere clusters but has no effect on loop or compartment formation. Whether the structure of the 3D genome varies across species may thus depend on whether they carry a functional condensin II gene. Science , abe2218, this issue p. 984"

The impact is so widespread that it has been suggested that only climate change reversal can save coral reefs globally. Donovan et al. looked at the interaction between local conditions and coral reef health and found that poor conditions magnify climate impacts (see the Perspective by Knowlton). Furthermore, reefs where human stressors such as overfishing or pollution were minimized fared better. Such results suggest that caring for reefs locally may help them to persist in our warming world. Science , abd9464, this issue p. 977 ; see also abi7286, p. 908"

Here we use a superconducting quantum interference device to image stray magnetic fields in one such system composed of twisted bilayer graphene aligned to hexagonal boron nitride. We find a magnetization of several Bohr magnetons per charge carrier, demonstrating that the magnetism is primarily orbital in nature. Our measurements reveal a large change in the magnetization as the chemical potential is swept across the quantum anomalous Hall gap consistent with the expected contribution of chiral edge states to the magnetization of an orbital Chern insulator. Mapping the spatial evolution of field-driven magnetic reversal, we find a series of reproducible micron scale domains whose boundaries host chiral edge states."

https://openalex.org/W3164537373,"Defects are essential to engineering the properties of functional materials ranging from semiconductors and superconductors to ferroics. Whereas point defects have been widely exploited, dislocations are commonly viewed as problematic for functional materials and not as a microstructural tool. We developed a method for mechanically imprinting dislocation networks that favorably skew the domain structure in bulk ferroelectrics and thereby tame the large switching polarization and make it available for functional harvesting. The resulting microstructure yields a strong mechanical restoring force to revert electric field-induced domain wall displacement on the macroscopic level and high pinning force on the local level. This induces a giant increase of the dielectric and electromechanical response at intermediate electric fields in barium titanate [electric field-dependent permittivity (ε33) ≈ 5800 and large-signal piezoelectric coefficient (d33*) ≈ 1890 picometers/volt]. Dislocation-based anisotropy delivers a different suite of tools with which to tailor functional materials."

We examined the MC4R coding sequence in 5,724 participants from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, functionally characterized all nonsynonymous MC4R variants and examined their association with anthropometric phenotypes from childhood to early adulthood. The frequency of heterozygous loss-of-function (LoF) mutations in MC4R was ~1 in 337 (0.30%), considerably higher than previous estimates. At age 18 years, mean differences in body weight, body mass index and fat mass between carriers and noncarriers of LoF mutations were 17.76 kg (95% CI 9.41, 26.10), 4.84 kg m-2 (95% CI 2.19, 7.49) and 14.78 kg (95% CI 8.56, 20.99), respectively. MC4R LoF mutations may be more common than previously reported and carriers of such variants may enter adult life with a substantial burden of excess adiposity."
https://openalex.org/W3164647903,"Coding for space in the mammalian brain Nearly all mammals navigate over large spatial scales in environments that span hundreds of meters to many kilometers. However, very little is known about the neural representations that underlie the coding of such large spaces. Eliav et al. recorded from place cells in the hippocampus of bats as they flew back and forth on an extremely long track (see the Perspective by Wood and Dudchenko). Many place cells had multiple place fields within this large environment. The place field sizes ranged from less than 1 meter up to 32 meters, and the sizes of the different place fields of an individual cell varied as much as 20-fold. Studying animals under naturalistic conditions can reveal new coding principles for the representation of their environment in the brain.

Shepertycky et al. designed a device that can harvest mechanical energy from a natural walking gait and convert it to useable electrical energy while also reducing the metabolic energy consumption of the user (see the Perspective by Riemer et al. ).

https://openalex.org/W3164631219,"Background and aims This online cross-sectional study investigated the severity of depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms among university students and determined the association between various factors and the levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic after the movement control order (MCO) was lifted. Methods A total of 316 participants were administered a self-report questionnaire that collected data on sociodemographic attributes, personal characteristics, COVID-19-related stressors, religious coping, and clinical characteristics. In addition, the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) and the 21-item Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) were administered. Results Regarding depression, 15.5%, 11.7%, and 9.2% of the participants reported mild, moderate, and severe to extremely severe depression, respectively. For anxiety, 7.0%, 16.5%, and 13.2% of the respondents had mild, moderate, and severe to extremely severe anxiety, respectively. Moreover, 26.3% of participants had mild stress, 9.5% had moderate stress, and 6.6% had severe to extremely severe stress. The multiple linear regression model revealed that frustration because of loss of daily routine and study disruption and having preexisting medical, depressive, and anxiety disorders were associated with elevated depressive symptoms, while a greater degree of family and friends social support was associated with less depressive symptoms after adjusting for age, gender, and marital status. It was also found that frustration because of study disruption and having preexisting medical, depressive, and anxiety disorders were associated with elevated anxiety symptoms, while being enrolled in medicine-based courses and having a greater degree of family support were factors associated with less anxiety symptoms after adjusting for age, gender, and marital status. Conclusion There is a need to conduct a longitudinal study in the future to confirm the causal relationship between the significant predictive factors and depression and anxiety identified in this study, and maintenance of a persistent flow of academic activities and social interaction may be of utmost importance to safeguard the mental wellbeing of university students."

Seabirds that forage and breed across oceans globally have been recognized as sentinels of ocean health. Sydeman et al. looked across seabird species of both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres and found varying patterns. Northern Hemisphere species exhibited greater signs of stress and reduced breeding success, indicative of low fish resources. Southern Hemisphere species showed less impact on reproductive output, suggesting that the fish populations there have thus far been less disturbed. The differences across hemispheres indicate different strategies for conservation, with active recovery needed in the north and enhanced protection in the south. Science , abf1772, this issue p. 980"
https://openalex.org/W3164768127,"Searching for factors to improve knockin efficiency for therapeutic applications, biotechnology, and generation of non-human primate models of disease, we found that the strand exchange protein RAD51 can significantly increase Cas9-mediated homozygous knockin in mouse embryos through an interhomolog repair (IHR) mechanism. IHR is a hallmark of meiosis but only occurs at low frequencies in somatic cells, and its occurrence in zygotes is controversial. Using multiple approaches, we provide evidence for an endogenous IHR mechanism in the early embryo that can be enhanced by RAD51. This process can be harnessed to generate homozygotes from wild-type zygotes using exogenous donors and to convert heterozygous alleles into homozygous alleles without exogenous templates. Furthermore, we identify additional IHR-promoting factors and describe features of IHR events. Together, our findings show conclusive evidence for IHR in mouse embryos and describe an efficient method for enhanced gene conversion."
https://openalex.org/W3165012325,"Social support seems to enhance wellbeing and health in many populations. Conversely, poor social support and loneliness are a social determinant of poor health outcomes and can adversely affect physical, emotional, and mental well-being. Social support is especially important in traumatic grief. However, the ways in which grieving individuals interpret and define social support is not well understood, and little is known about what specific behaviours are perceived as helpful. Using qualitative description and content analysis, this study assessed bereaved individuals’ satisfaction of social support in traumatic grief, using four categories of social support as a framework. Findings suggest inadequate satisfaction from professional, familial, and community support. Pets emerged with the most satisfactory ratings. Further, findings suggest that emotional support is the most desired type of support following traumatic loss. Implications for supporting bereaved individuals within and beyond the context of the COVID-19 pandemic are discussed."

The aim of the study was to identify changes and relationship with socio-demographic parameters. An online survey was administered to 1383 subjects (1007 females and 307 males) working in the University of Florence, Italy. Three validated questionnaires were used for the survey: the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire, the Med Diet Score and the Psychological General Well-Being Index-A. All the subjects were asked to complete the questionnaires twice, in order to attain a picture of the habits before and a later time point during confinement. Our results show that work-related physical activity was decreased, along with an increase in sedentary behaviour (from 07:22±03:20 to 08:49±03:41 h:min; p&lt;0.001, ES = 0.38), whereas recreational physical activity was increased (vigorous exercise varied from 568.5 ± 838.6 to 833.7 ± 1263.0 METs; p&lt;0.002, ES = 0.25). Eating habits changed according to the place where meals were eaten, with an increased habit for breakfast and snacks and a slight increase in alcohol consumption. Psychological well-being decreased (Index from 21.4±3.9 to 18.0±5.3; p&lt;0.001, ES = 0.723), especially in terms of vitality and positive thinking. The socio-demographic variables affecting these variations were mostly represented by age, gender and working conditions: young age and self-employment conditions can be considered factors for the changes in daily habits induced by confinement that may affect psychological well-being."

Elucidating the nature of this QCP is, however, tricky. Worasaran et al. set out to do just that in a prototypical iron-based superconductor, barium iron arsenide. By applying strain to their samples, the researchers found power-law behaviors that are characteristic of nematic quantum criticality. The associated quantum fluctuations were present over a large portion of the phase diagram. This method may be useful in studying quantum criticality in other material systems.

https://openalex.org/W3164237736,"Binding of antibodies to their receptors is a core component of the innate immune system. Understanding the precise interactions between antibodies and their Fc receptors has led to the engineering of novel mAb biotherapeutics with tailored biological activities. One of the most significant findings is that afucosylated monoclonal antibodies demonstrate increased affinity toward the receptor FcγRIIIa, with a commensurate increase in antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Crystal structure analysis has led to the hypothesis that afucosylation in the Fc region results in reduced steric hindrance between antibody–receptor intermolecular glycan interactions, enhancing receptor affinity; however, solution-phase data have yet to corroborate this hypothesis. In addition, recent work has shown that the fragment antigen-binding (Fab) region may directly interact with Fc receptors; however, the biological consequences of these interactions remain unclear. By probing differences in solvent accessibility between native and afucosylated immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) using hydroxyl radical footprinting–MS, we provide the first solution-phase evidence that an IgG1 bearing an afucosylated Fc region appears to require fewer conformational changes for FcγRIIIa binding. In addition, we performed extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to understand the molecular mechanism behind the effects of afucosylation. The combination of these techniques provides molecular insight into the steric hindrance from the core Fc fucose in IgG1 and corroborates previously proposed Fab–receptor interactions. Furthermore, MD-guided rational mutagenesis enabled us to demonstrate that Fab–receptor interactions directly contribute to the modulation of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity activity.

Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are the fastest growing class of biotherapeutic agents, many of which are of the human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) isotype (1Jefferis R. Isotype and glycoform selection for antibody therapeutics.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2012; 526: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 2Satoh M. Iida S. Shitara K.

Levine H.L. The therapeutic monoclonal antibody market.MAbs. 2015; 7: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). The IgG1 antibody structure consists of two homodimeric heavy chain (HC)–light chain (LC) pairs that are linked together in a parallel fashion with both noncovalent interactions and disulfide linkages (reviewed in (4Chan A.C. Carter P.J. Therapeutic antibodies for autoimmunity and inflammation.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2010; 10: 301-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar)). The IgG structure consists of the fragment antigen-binding (Fab) domain and the Fc receptor–binding region (Fc), both of which contain discrete structural features. One of the most important structural features of the Fc region for an mAb is the conserved post-translational modification of the N-glycosylation site at asparagine 297 (N297, EU numbering) (5Mizuochi T. Taniguchi T. Shimizu A. Kobata A. Structural and numerical variations of the carbohydrate moiety of immunoglobulin G.J. Immunol. 1982; 129: 2016-2020PubMed Google Scholar). This N-linked glycan typically consists of a complex-type oligosaccharide, with a GlcNAc core, and varying degrees of sugar extensions made up of fucose (Fuc), mannose, galactose, and sialic acid (6Jefferis R. Glycosylation of natural and recombinant antibody molecules.Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2005; 564: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It has been shown that N-linked glycans are required for Fc receptor–facilitated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) (7Raju T.S. Terminal sugars of Fc glycans influence antibody effector functions of IgGs.Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2008; 20: 471-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) and afucosylated antibodies display an increase in ADCC activity via an increase in affinity to FcγRIIIa (8Shields R.L. Lai J. Keck R. O'Connell L.Y. Hong K. Meng Y.G. Weikert S.H. Presta L.G.

Chem. 2002; 277: 26733-26740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1259) Google Scholar). ADCC can be either favorable or unfavorable for biotherapeutic mAbs depending on the desired mechanism of action (9Rajasekaran N. Chester C. Yonezawa A. Zhao X. Kohrt H.E.

Bypassing glycosylation: Engineering aglycosylated full-length IgG antibodies for human therapy.Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2011; 22: 858-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar); therefore, understanding the role of the N-linked glycan on effector function is critical for therapeutic design of mAbs. Before the acquisition of structural data, there was little understanding of the clustering event for the Fcγ receptor that occurs during effector function. Woof and Burton (11Woof J.M. Burton D.R. Human antibody-Fc receptor interactions illuminated by crystal structures.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 89-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) postulated the possible structural scenarios that would lead to the clustering event required for ADCC. They noted that the positioning of the receptor’s binding site at the CH2 domain would require the antibody to adopt a “bent” conformation with a dimerization of the Fc domain to enable engagement between the target and effector cell and facilitate a clustering synapse. Their pictorial representation depicts bivalent antigen binding on the cell surface, with no comparison to monovalent binding. This difference in binding may be of significance because cell-surface antigen expression and copy number viability have shown to be associated with ADCC efficiency (12Tang Y. Lou J. Alpaugh R.K. Robinson M.K. Marks J.D. Weiner L.M. Regulation of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity by IgG intrinsic and apparent affinity for target antigen.J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 2815-2823Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Structural analysis has since shown that truncation of the IgG1 to the Fc-only region retains binding to FcγRIIIa. A crystal structure of this complex has been solved (13Sondermann P. Huber R. Oosthuizen V. Jacob U.

While intermolecular glycan interactions between both proteins were observed, these interactions did not appear to be required for binding (15Ferrara C. Grau S. Jager C. Sondermann P. Brunker P. Waldhauer I. Hennig M. Ruf A. Rufer A.C. Stihle M. Umana P. Benz J.

More recent work by Subedi et al., has shed insight on the role of the CE` loop, hypothesizing that N297 glycosylation restricts CH2 domain conformation, thereby preorganizing the binding site in an orientation that is preferred for receptor binding (17Subedi G.P.

Barb A.W. The structural role of antibody N-glycosylation in receptor interactions.Structure. 2015; 23: 1573-1583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). It has since been shown that site-directed mutagenesis in the CH2 domain could modulate effector function activity regardless of the glycan (19Moore G.L. Chen H. Karki S. Lazar G.A.

Engineered antibody Fc variants with enhanced effector function.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 4005-4010Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar), indicating that both Fc polypeptide–mediated and glycan-mediated interactions can influence Fc-receptor biology. Through further crystal structure analysis, Ferrara et al. (15Ferrara C. Grau S. Jager C. Sondermann P. Brunker P. Waldhauer I. Hennig M. Ruf A. Rufer A.C. Stihle M. Umana P. Benz J. Unique carbohydrate-carbohydrate interactions are required for high affinity binding between FcgammaRIII and antibodies lacking core fucose.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2011; 108: 12669-12674Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar) eloquently described a hypothesis for the role of fucosylation on the molecular interactions that appear to contribute to the difference in binding affinity toward FcγRIIIa. Comparison of the fucosylated (native) versus afucosylated Fc crystal structures revealed that an N-linked glycan on FcγRIIIa (N162) is oriented toward N-linked core Fuc on the antibody, thereby requiring a large conformational change to accommodate glycan-mediated binding. Thus, the current hypothesis proposes that steric hindrance caused by the Fc-region core Fuc is responsible for weakening the glycan-mediated interactions, leading to a significant decrease in affinity. In addition to static-phase information gained from crystallography, there has been extensive effort to understand antibody–FcγRIIIa solution-phase interactions. Both hydrogen–deuterium exchange (HDX) and the emerging technology of hydroxyl radical footprint (HRF)-MS have been used to study the IgG1–FcγRIIIa interaction. Both technologies revealed conformational changes in the Fc region outside CE` loop upon binding to the receptor (22Houde D. Peng Y. Berkowitz S.A. Engen J.R.

Proteomics. 2010; 9: 1716-1728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 23Shi L. Liu T. Gross M.L. Huang Y.

In addition, both technologies provided structural evidence of potential interactions between the Fab and receptor; however, there was conflicting evidence between the two different HDX studies, and neither study investigated the role of afucosylation on FcγRIIIa binding directly. More recently, Yogo et al. (24Yogo R. Yamaguchi Y. Watanabe H. Yagi H. Satoh T. Nakanishi M. Onitsuka M. Omasa T. Shimada M. Maruno T. Torisu T. Watanabe S. Higo D. Uchihashi T. Yanaka S. et al.The Fab portion of immunoglobulin G contributes to its binding to Fcgamma receptor III.Sci. Rep. 2019; 9: 11957Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) used a combination of atomic force microscopy and HDX to probe Fab–FcγRIII interactions, leading to the suggestion that the Fab may stabilize the clustering event at the cell surface. However, the extent that these interactions contribute to the binding of FcγRIII and the biological role (if any) on ADCC, remains unknown. HDX is a well-established technology for elucidating protein dynamics and protein–protein interactions; however, HRF is an emerging technology for these applications (25Zhang Y. Wecksler A.T. Molina P. Deperalta G. Gross M.L. Mapping the binding interface of VEGF and a monoclonal antibody Fab-1 fragment with fast photochemical oxidation of proteins (FPOP) and mass spectrometry.J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2017; 28: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 26Zhang H. Cui W. Gross M.L. Mass spectrometry for the biophysical characterization of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies.FEBS Lett. 2014; 588: 308-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Unlike HDX, which utilizes deuterium uptake to provide information on the protein amide backbone, HRF utilizes the diffusion of hydroxyl radicals to oxidize amino acid side chains in a protein. In this study, we utilize fast photochemical oxidation of proteins to generate the hydroxyl radicals (27Chen J. Rempel D.L. Gau B.C. Gross M.L. Fast photochemical oxidation of proteins and mass spectrometry follow submillisecond protein folding at the amino-acid level.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2012; 134: 18724-18731Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Hydroxyl radicals are similar in both the size and polarity to those of aqueous water, which enables diffusion to solvent-exposed regions for protein labeling. The extent of protein modification is a function of both solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) and the intrinsic reactivity of the labeled amino acid side chain. Indeed, previous data have shown that a quantitative correlation between HRF data and the protein regional SASA can be achieved (28Charvatova O. Foley B.L. Bern M.W. Sharp J.S. Orlando R. Woods R.J. Quantifying protein interface footprinting by hydroxyl radical oxidation and molecular dynamics simulation: Application to galectin-1.J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2008; 19: 1692-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 29Xie B. Sood A. Woods R.J. Sharp J.S. Quantitative protein topography measurements by high resolution hydroxyl radical protein footprinting enable accurate molecular model selection.Sci. Rep. 2017; 7: 4552Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, because side-chain reactivity is also a major factor, HRF is best used in a direct comparative analysis in which the amino acid sequence of the region of interest remains unchanged (e.g., fucosylated versus afucosylated, receptor-bound versus unbound). Our current solution-phase studies attempt to expand our understanding of fucosylation on the molecular mechanism of FcγRIIIa binding. We utilize HRF to probe the solvent accessibility difference in the native (fucosylated) versus afucosylated IgG1 and assess how these structural differences are reflected in the receptor-bound states. In addition, we used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to determine the difference in molecular interactions in the absence of Fuc for the bound IgG1 structure. The corroborative data between HRF and MD enabled rational mutagenesis to probe the role for the Fab on receptor binding and ADCC activity. This work is the first to provide solution-phase data that corroborate the steric hindrance hypothesis, to show the in silico molecular detail of IgG1–receptor interactions and demonstrate that Fab–receptor interactions can modulate ADCC activity. Crystal structure analysis has shown that the N-linked glycan is significantly perturbed by 2.6 Å when in its native, fucosylated state; however, the overall alignment of the native versus afucosylated Fc–receptor complex structures (3SGK and 3SGJ) results in a modest RMSD = 0.414 (PyMOL alignment) (15Ferrara C. Grau S. Jager C. Sondermann P. Brunker P. Waldhauer I. Hennig M. Ruf A. Rufer A.C. Stihle M. Umana P. Benz J. Unique carbohydrate-carbohydrate interactions are required for high affinity binding between FcgammaRIII and antibodies lacking core fucose.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2011; 108: 12669-12674Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). This suggests that the perturbation required to accommodate the Fuc sugar has little impact on the overall Fc region conformation in the bound state. However, the effect of Fuc on IgG structure in the unbound state remains unknown. To this end, we were first interested in determining if HRF could detect solvent accessibility differences after the removal of Fuc from the native glycan population. This required generation of a native and afucosylated IgG1 with identical glycan heterogeneity to eliminate the potential for confounding HRF data interpretation. Using a native and Fuc -transferase KO Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines, we obtained the native and afucosylated IgG molecules, respectively, with nearly identical glycan heterogeneity (Fig. S1A). We performed additional product quality assessment to ensure similar levels and/or distribution of product-related variants (e.g., aggregation, charge variants) and observed no significant differences (data not shown). These data indicate that both the primary sequence and the primary post-translational modification for these IgG1 molecules were nearly identical, and thus, our HRF data should reflect SASA differences of the IgG1 molecules that result from the Fuc glycan. HRF analysis provides information on the SASA of peptides based on their susceptibility for oxidation. Therefore, differences observed in the oxidative footprints (the collection of peptides and their respective oxidation levels) of the unbound native and afucosylated IgG1 molecules represent changes in the protein structure because of the presence or absence of the core Fuc. While the oxidative footprints are nearly identical for both populations of molecules (Fig. S1B), indicating that the Fuc does not induce gross structural changes in the IgG1, there are distinct differences between the two molecules in the Fab and Fc regions (Fig. 1A). Specifically, the afucosylated IgG1 displays a significant increase in SASA for one tryptic peptide in the LC variable region (residue 61–102, sequential numbering for all HRF data) and a significant decrease in SASA in two tryptic peptides in the Fc region (254–260 and 422–444). Both of the tryptic peptides in the Fc region are distal from the FcγRIIIa binding site and contain residues known to interact with the neonatal Fc receptor (30Burmeister W.P. Huber A.H. Bjorkman P.J. Crystal structure of the complex of rat neonatal Fc receptor with Fc.Nature. 1994; 372: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). These data suggest that afucosylation results in distal changes and a more compact Fc region. HRF is an ideal tool for determining the binding interfaces between two molecules by comparing the oxidative footprints of the unbound and bound states. Peptides that demonstrate reduced SASA in the bound state relative to the unbound states provide evidence of the binding interface (25Zhang Y. Wecksler A.T. Molina P. Deperalta G. Gross M.L. Mapping the binding interface of VEGF and a monoclonal antibody Fab-1 fragment with fast photochemical oxidation of proteins (FPOP) and mass spectrometry.J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2017; 28: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 31Yan Y. Chen G. Wei H. Huang R.Y. Mo J. Rempel D.L. Tymiak A.A. Gross M.L.

Chance M.R. Future directions of structural mass spectrometry using hydroxyl radical footprinting.J. Mass Spectrom. 2010; 45: 1373-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Thus, we utilized HRF to analyze the solvent accessibility differences in the unbound versus FcγRIIIa-bound states for both the native and afucosylated IgG1 molecules to determine if there are differences in the IgG1–receptor interactions because of the removal of Fuc. The receptor-bound oxidative footprints of the IgG1 show that there are only a few regions on the protein that display reduced SASA (Fig. S1, C and D). The most interesting observation is that the same 2 Fc-region tryptic peptides that showed differences in the unbound states (residues 254–260 and 422–444) also display differences upon FcγRIIIa binding, but only when the Fc region contains Fuc (Fig. 1B, peptides highlighted in green and blue). In the absence of Fuc, there are no significant changes in these Fc-region tryptic peptides upon FcγRIIIa binding (Fig. 1C). Notably, these peptides appear to have similar SASA in both the native and afucosylated Fc regions when comparing receptor-bound states. Taken together, these observations provide two significant insights into the role of Fuc on receptor binding: (1) Fc regions with glycans lacking the Fuc appear to require minimal structural changes to accommodate receptor binding; (2) the Fc regions, irrespective of core Fuc, end up in highly similar conformations once in the receptor-bound state. The former observation is consistent with structural hindrance hypothesis, and the latter is consistent with the calculated SASA for the two Fc peptides in the crystal structures (Fig. S2). The HRF data also indicate that regardless of the Fuc, there is a Fab peptide in the CH1 region (residues 153–215) that exhibits significantly reduced solvent accessibility in the bound state (Fig. 1, B and C, peptide highlighted in orange). This peptide is in the same region of the IgG that was previously observed to have changes by Houde et al. (22Houde D. Peng Y. Berkowitz S.A. Engen J.R. Post-translational modifications differentially affect IgG1 conformation and receptor binding.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2010; 9: 1716-1728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) using HDX and by Shi et al. (23Shi L. Liu T. Gross M.L. Huang Y.

Therefore, we further investigate the role of this CH1 peptide in subsequent studies described in the MD simulations reveal insight into IgG1–FcγRIIIa molecular interactions section below. The HRF data for the receptor are nearly identical when bound to either the native or afucosylated IgG1, indicating that the decrease in the solvent accessibility appears to be independent of the IgG1 core Fc Fuc (Fig. 2). Specifically, we could distinguish eight tryptic peptides of the receptor, representing ∼80% of the receptor sequence coverage. Seven of the peptides showed reduced SASA in the bound state, albeit the modification levels were too low for two peptides to indicate statistical significance. The interactions for peptides containing residues 71 to 97 and 132 to 143 are consistent with the crystal structures (13Sondermann P. Huber R. Oosthuizen V. Jacob U. The 3.2-A crystal structure of the human IgG1 Fc fragment-Fc gammaRIII complex.Nature. 2000; 406: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 15Ferrara C. Grau S. Jager C. Sondermann P.

A. 2011; 108: 12669-12674Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar) and previously HRF data (23Shi L. Liu T. Gross M.L. Huang Y. Recognition of human IgG1 by Fcγ receptors: Structural insights from hydrogen–deuterium exchange and fast photochemical oxidation of proteins coupled with mass spectrometry.Biochemistry. 2019; 58: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The peptide containing the N-linked glycan at N162 does not appear to change upon binding (Fig. 2, red peptide). This is consistent with the idea that polypeptides on the receptor do not play a major role in binding affinity and thus reduced SASA would not be expected. However, the second N-linked glycan at N45 (orange) that is not involved in binding does display similar levels of reduced SASA in both complexes. This likely reflects distal conformation changes in the receptor that occur simply from IgG binding, independent of the Fc fucosylation. The fact that changes in solvent accessibility for nearly all of the FcγRIIIa peptides in the bound state are independent of the IgG1 core Fc Fuc suggests that the receptor does not structurally accommodate the IgG1 fucosylation. Rather, the native IgG1 Fc region undergoes conformational structural changes to accommodate receptor binding. Using published crystal structures, we generated two virtual molecules of the receptor-bound IgG1 with (PDB: 3SGJ) and without (PDB: 3SGK) the core Fuc. The full-length IgG1 structures were constructed by covalently attaching the Fab homology models to the Fc domains and modifying the relative positions of the Fab and Fc domains such that the canonical Y-shape conformation was obtained (see Experimental procedures). The IgG1 molecules were constructed with an N297 G0 glycan (shown in pink in Fig. 2B), and the receptor was constructed with N45 and N162 glycans consistent with the PDB files (shown in Fig. 2B as orange and red, respectively). Extensive MD simulations were performed to generate a total of 6 μs trajectories for each structure. Figure 3A shows the full-length fucosylated IgG1–FcγRIIIa complex used for the MD simulations. Figure 3, B and C provide an expanded view of the intermolecular glycan interactions between the IgG1 (cyan and yellow spheres) and the receptor (red spheres) for the fucosylated and afucosylated complexes, respectively. Because the receptor binds the Fc region of the IgG1 asymmetrically, we have separately denoted the two Fc chains as Fc1 and Fc2 and their corresponding Fab domains as Fab1 and Fab2. For simplicity, we denote Fc1 as the HC containing the core Fuc (magenta) that is in direct proximity to the receptor glycans (Fig. 3B). To understand the role of the core Fuc on the intermolecular glycan interactions, we first calculated the probability distribution of the minimum distance between the glycans in the two bound forms (Fig. S3). We observed that the presence of Fuc significantly increases the average distance within the intermolecular glycan interactions. As seen in Figure 3B, the Fc1 Fuc (magenta) is positioned directly between the rest of the Fc1 glycans (cyan spheres) and the receptor glycans (red spheres). This is the site of the hypothesized steric hindrance, which likely results in the increase in average distances between the glycans. Figure 3C visually depicts a more compact intermolecular glycan interface in the absence of Fuc, consistent with afucosylated data in Fig. S3. To best visualize the difference of intermolecular interactions within the two complexes, all of the polypeptide and glycan interactions between the two proteins were plotted on a 2D contour map (Fig. 4A). To distinguish which polypeptide chains are interacting with the receptor, the contour map is divided into the Fab1/Fc1 and Fab2/Fc2 for the fucosylated and afucosylated IgG–receptor"

Many are not ready to have conversations about end-of-life, and decision-making is left to their families and professionals when they no longer have capacity. Carers may benefit from further support with decision-making. To develop this support, it is important to understand the decision-making process.Explore with family carers and people living with dementia the decision-making process and factors that influence decision-making in dementia end of life care, to produce a model of decision-making in the context of dementia end-of-life care.Semi-structured interviews with 21 family carers and 11 people with dementia in England (2018-2019) from memory clinics, general practice and carer organisations. Interviews were analysed using thematic analysis and findings were mapped onto the Interprofessional Shared Decision Making model, refined to produce a modified model of decision-making in dementia.Participants described five key decisions towards the end-of-life as examples of decision making. We used these experiences to produce a modified model of decision-making in dementia end-of-life-care. The model considers the contextual factors that influence the decision-making process, including: personal preferences; advance care planning and Lasting Power of Attorney; capacity and health and wellbeing of the person with dementia; support from others and clarity of roles. The decision-making process consists of seven inter-linked stages: 1) identifying the decision maker or team; 2) sharing and exchanging information; 3) clarifying values and preferences; 4) managing and considering emotions; 5) considering the feasibility of options; 6) balancing preferred choice and the actual choice; and 7) implementation and reflecting on outcomes.The modified model breaks down the decision-making process and attempts to simplify the process while capturing the subtle nuances of decision making. It provides a framework for conversations and supporting decisions by carers."

However, only results from animal experiments have been available, and the suppressive effects of Brazilian propolis on disease activity in humans with RA remain unknown. The purpose of this study was to clinically validate how Brazilian propolis intake changes disease activity in RA patients.This study was conducted as a multicenter, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study of 80 women with RA (median age, 61.5 years; interquartile range, 56.0 to 67.3 years) showing moderate disease activity on Disease Activity Score in 28 joints using erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR). Test tablets containing Brazilian propolis were used in Group P (40 patients), and Brazilian propolis-free placebo tablets were used as control in Group C (40 patients). Group P received 5 tablets of propolis (508.5 mg of propolis) daily, and Group C received 5 tablets of placebo daily. The intervention lasted 24 weeks, with change in DAS28-ESR set as the primary endpoint. As secondary endpoints, other disease activity assessment (DAS28 using C-reactive protein, simplified disease activity index, clinical disease activity index), ultrasonographic evaluation of synovitis, activities of daily living, quality of life, changes in cytokine levels, and adverse events over the course of the study were also assessed. Data were statistically analyzed by analysis of covariance.No significant differences in the primary endpoint were identified between groups (Group P vs Group C, effect: 0.14, 95% confidence interval: -0.21 to 0.49, p = 0.427). Likewise, no significant differences were seen between groups for any secondary endpoints.

For this purpose, we performed molecular docking using computational biology techniques on several SARS-CoV-2 proteins that are responsible for its pathogenicity against N-acetyl-D-glucosamine. A similar molecular dynamics analysis has been carried out on both SARS-CoV-2 and anti- Staphylococcus aureus neutralizing antibodies to establish the potential of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine which likely induces the immune response against the virus. The results of molecular dynamic analysis have confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (PDB: 6M0J), RNA-binding domain of nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (PDB: 6WKP), refusion SARS-CoV-2 S ectodomain trimer (PDB: 6X79), and main protease 3clpro at room temperature (PDB: 7JVZ) could bind with N-acetyl-D-glucosamine that these proteins play an important role in SARS-CoV-2’s infection and evade the immune system. Moreover, our molecular docking analysis has supported a strong protein-ligand interaction of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine with these selected proteins. Furthermore, computational analysis against the D614G mutant of the virus has shown that N-acetyl-D-glucosamine affinity and its binding potential were not affected by the mutations occurring in the virus’ receptor binding domain. The analysis on the affinity of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine towards human antibodies has shown that it could potentially bind to both SARS-CoV-2 proteins and antibodies based on our predictive modelling work.

We also assessed risk factors associated with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. We conducted a cross-sectional study using data from MedicineInsight, a national database of general practice electronic health records, from 1 July 2017 to 30 June 2019. The prevalence of IBD was calculated and stratified by sociodemographic characteristics. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to assess risk factors associated with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The study comprised 2,428,461 regular patients from 481 practices. The estimated crude prevalence of IBD was 653 per 100,000 patients; Crohn's disease was 306 per 100,000 and ulcerative colitis was 334 per 100,000. Males were independently associated with a lower risk of Crohn's disease (OR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.81, 0.90) but a greater risk of ulcerative colitis (OR: 1.12; 95% CI: 1.06, 1.17) than females. Compared to non-smokers, patients who were current smokers were associated with a greater risk of Crohn's disease (OR: 1.13; 95% CI: 1.04, 1.23) but a lower risk of ulcerative colitis (OR: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.47, 0.57).

All 500 records were considered and the selection was based on participants' consenting to the study and their strict adherence to ART without absconding. The incidence of NCDs was determined and generalized estimating equations (GEE) were used to estimate the association between NCDs and the selected risk factors.Data collected at the study's baseline (2010) showed that the most prevalent NCD was hypertension, found in (18/203) 8.9% of the study participants, followed by diabetes (6.9%), then followed by cardiovascular diseases (CVD) (3.9%), and the least common NCD was cancer (1.9%). Incidences of all of these NCDs showed an increasing trend as the time of follow-up progressed. The factors found to be significantly associated with the development of NCDs were gender (p = 0.002) and follow-up time (p<0.001). Geographical location was a significant risk factor as urban patients were more likely to develop hypertension as compared to the peri-urban patients (p = 0.001).NCDs and HIV comorbidity is common with women more likely than males to develop NCDs as they advance in age. There is need to devise targeted intervention approach to the respective NCDs and risk factors since they affect differently in relation to the demographic details of the participants.This paper recommends a multi-stakeholder approach to the management of NCDs, with researchers, clinicians and the government and its various arms taking a leading role."
https://openalex.org/W3164977201,"In recent years, the rapid development of deep neural networks has made great progress in automatic organ segmentation from abdominal CT scans. However, automatic segmentation for small organs (e.g., the pancreas) is still a challenging task. As an inconspicuous and small organ in the abdomen, the pancreas has a high degree of anatomical variability and is indistinguishable from the surrounding organs and tissues, which usually leads to a very vague boundary. Therefore, the accuracy of pancreatic segmentation is sometimes below satisfaction. In this paper, we propose a 2.5D U-net with an attention mechanism. The proposed network includes 2D convolutional layers and 3D convolutional layers, which means that it requires less computational resources than 3D segmentation models while it can capture more spatial information along the third dimension than 2D segmentation models. Then We use a cascaded framework to increase the accuracy of segmentation results. We evaluate our network on the NIH pancreas dataset and measure the segmentation accuracy by the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC). Experimental results demonstrate a better performance compared with state-of-the-art methods."

Previous studies have shown that Herb-partitioned moxibustion treating (at Qihai (CV 6) and Tianshu (ST 25)) prevented the excessive activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and repaired damaged colonic mucosa in Crohn's disease. However, the mechanism by which Herb-partitioned moxibustion (at CV 6 and ST 25) regulates NLRP3 remains unclear. In this study, we treated Crohn's disease rats with herb-partitioned moxibustion (at CV 6 and ST 25) to investigate the mechanism by which Herb-partitioned moxibustion regulates the colonic NLRP3 inflammasome by observing colon length, the colon macroscopic damage indexes, and the expression of ATP, P2X7R, Pannexin-1, NF-κBp65, NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1, IL-1β and IL-18 in the colon in Crohn's disease. Here, this study shows that herb-partitioned moxibustion (at CV 6 and ST 25) can reduce colon macroscopic damage indexes and colon histopathological scores, alleviate colon shortening and block the abnormal activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by inhibiting the ATP content and the expression of P2X7R, Pannexin-1 and NF-κBp65, thereby reducing the release of the downstream inflammatory cytokine IL-1β and ultimately suppressing colonic inflammation in Crohn's disease rats. This study for the first time identifies the mechanism by which herb-partitioned moxibustion (at CV 6 and ST 25) may inhibit the abnormal activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by inhibiting the P2X7R-Pannexin-1 signaling pathway in Crohn's disease rats."

Hervás and coworkers recently determined the structure of the Orb2 fibril core, which is located in the Gln/His-domain, using cryo-EM (6Hervás R. Murzin A.G. Si K. Implications of the Orb2 amyloid structure in Huntington’s disease.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2020; 21: 6910Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar). The domain structure of Orb2 that combines low-complexity sequences with RNA-binding domains (RBDs) is reminiscent of a whole class of RNA-binding proteins, such as fused in sarcoma (FUS), that are able to undergo liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) (10King O.D.

LLPS is often of functional relevance e.g., for RNA processing in the case of (stress) granules (13Lin Y. Protter D.S.W. Rosen M.K. Parker R.

Additionally, other Gln-rich proteins such as huntingtin exon-1 (HTTex1) or Whi3 have been reported to undergo LLPS (16Peskett T.R. Rau F. O’Driscoll J. Patani R. Lowe A.R. Saibil H.R.

Cell. 2015; 60: 220-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). When observed via light microcopy, LLPS manifests as droplet or puncta formation. These droplets, while relatively fluid at first, can mature over time, which results in the decreased ability to fuse with other droplets and low fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) (18Halfmann R. A glass menagerie of low complexity sequences.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2016; 38: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 19Banani S.F. Lee H.O. Hyman A.A. Rosen M.K. Biomolecular condensates: Organizers of cellular biochemistry.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2017; 18: 285-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1527) Google Scholar). Structurally, this maturation is caused by reduced protein diffusion in the droplet phase, which becomes a rigid protein glass. These mature droplets can in cases such as FUS mutants or HTTex1 be the nucleation point of cross-β fibril formation (16Peskett T.R. Rau F. O’Driscoll J. Patani R. Lowe A.R. Saibil H.R.

Taken together, these findings suggest that Orb2 could also undergo phase separation, which could have a potential role for its function, or its aggregation into cross-β fibrils, or both. In the following, we answer the question of whether or not Orb2 can undergo phase separation by demonstrating that it indeed can. Further, we characterize droplet maturation and fibril formation of different Orb2 fragments to understand the relationship between Orb2 droplet and fibril formation. To determine if Orb2 can phase separate in vitro, we studied full-length Orb2B and Orb2A and Orb2B fragments without the C-terminal RBD, which we refer to as ΔRBD constructs (Fig. 1A). We did not study full-length Orb2A because it does not require its RBD for proper function in vivo (3Krüttner S. Stepien B. Noordermeer J.N. Mommaas M.A. Mechtler K. Dickson B.J. Keleman K. Drosophila CPEB Orb2A mediates memory independent of its RNA-binding domain.Neuron. 2012; 76: 383-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and because we were not able to make it in large quantities. Sequence analysis using the database-based FuzPred algorithm (21Hardenberg M. Horvath A. Ambrus V. Fuxreiter M. Vendruscolo M. Widespread occurrence of the droplet state of proteins in the human proteome.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2020; 117: 33254-33262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed a high propensity for phase separation (pLLPS) for the N-termini of Orb2A and Orb2B until about the beginning of the RBD (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, the N-terminal residues unique to Orb2A showed a lower pLLPS than the corresponding residues in Orb2B. This propensity does not seem to be driven by charge separation as the charge density plots in Figure S1 indicate. To test if Orb2 can undergo phase separation, we started in conditions that favored a stable monomeric state, namely 100 mM KCl, 1 M urea, 10 mM HEPES, 0.05% v/v β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.6, here referred to as HEPES–salt–urea buffer (HSU buffer). When left in HSU buffer, Orb2 monomers did not phase separate or form aggregates. To introduce droplet formation, we exchanged each Orb2 construct from HSU buffer into H buffer (10 mM HEPES, 0.03% v/v NaN3 and 0.05% v/v β-mercaptoethanol, pH 6.5). Immediately upon exchange, the solutions became visibly turbid (Fig. 2A). To further confirm that Orb2B, Orb2BΔRBD, and Orb2AΔRBD underwent droplet formation, we used differential interference contrast (DIC) and fluorescence microscopy of Oregon Green 488 labeled protein (Fig. 2B). Round protein droplets were visible for all constructs immediately after buffer exchange. We found these droplets to be predominantly in solution and did not observe any wetting of the glass slide in contrast to many other protein droplets. The average diameters of Orb2BΔRBD, Orb2AΔRBD, and Orb2B droplets were 1.3 ± 1.0 μm, 2.2 ± 1.1 μm, and 1.8 ± 1.4 μm, respectively (see Fig. S2). Morphological analysis (22Takashimizu Y. Iiyoshi M. New parameter of roundness R: Circularity corrected by aspect ratio.Prog. Earth Planet. Sci. 2016; 3: 2Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar) showed that the droplets had a high degree of roundness of 0.7–0.9. Besides H-buffer (i.e., low ionic strength), we found that both 10% PEG 8000 and polyA at a 1:10 RNA:protein m/m ratio were able to induce Orb2 droplet formation (see Fig. S3) when added to HSU buffer. Again, Orb2BΔRBD droplets are significantly smaller under these conditions. Many protein droplets mature over time, undergoing a transition from a state in which proteins freely diffuse inside the droplet to a state with little to no protein diffusion (glass transition) (23Babinchak W.M. Surewicz W.K. Liquid–liquid phase separation and its mechanistic role in pathological protein aggregation.J. Mol. Biol. 2020; 432: 1910-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To characterize protein diffusion inside droplets, we measured FRAP. We bleached the center of Oregon Green 488 labeled Orb2 droplets using an argon laser and monitored the recovery by confocal microscopy for 5 min afterward. To our surprise, none of the Orb2 constructs showed any degree of recovery, even though FRAP experiments were performed within 1 min of droplet formation. These results indicate that Orb2 is static within droplets almost immediately after undergoing phase separation (Fig. 3). To further confirm these results, we did four consecutive 10 min FRAP experiments on the same cluster of Orb2B droplets. The first had still not recovered after the last experiment ended (Fig. S4). In addition, we found several clusters of Orb2B droplets with overlap between individual droplet boundaries (Figs. 3 and S4). For many other proteins, this stage typically marks the beginning of a droplet fusion event. None of the droplets with overlapping boundaries completed the fusion process. These results support that Orb2B becomes static within droplets relatively quickly after phase separation. As a positive control, we used a N-terminally 6xHis and GFP-tagged FUS construct (His-GFP-FUS) for which we measured about 50% recovery in fluorescence after 22 s, similar to FRAP experiments on FUS droplet reported previously (20Patel A. Lee H.O. Jawerth L. Maharana S. Jahnel M. Hein M.Y. Stoynov S. Mahamid J. Saha S. Franzmann T.M. Pozniakovski A. Poser I. Maghelli N. Royer L.A. Weigert M. et al.A liquid-to-solid phase transition of the ALS protein FUS accelerated by disease mutation.Cell. 2015; 162: 1066-1077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar). For some proteins, droplet maturation is followed by cross-β fibril formation (18Halfmann R. A glass menagerie of low complexity sequences.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2016; 38: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To test how Orb2 droplets evolve and if they eventually result in cross-β fibrils, we monitored Orb2 droplets over time using fluorescence microscopy, electron microscopy (EM), and Thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence. Fluorescence microscopy and EM images of Orb2BΔRBD, Orb2AΔRBD, and Orb2B in H buffer are shown in Figure 4. In the case of Orb2BΔRBD, the initial droplets formed halos at 12 h in our fluorescence images, which coincided with unbundled fibrils radiating out from a dark center as seen by EM. Similarly, Orb2AΔRBD droplets turned into small fibrils and droplets at 12 h. At 48 h, we observed large objects in fluorescence microscopy, which coincided with thick, bundled fibrils in our EM images. In contrast, Orb2B droplets never progressed to form fibrils, but formed larger objects that were composed of merged droplets similar to those shown in Figure 3. We attributed the disappearance of Orb2BΔRBD and Orb2AΔRBD droplets over several hours to the maturation of these droplets into cross-β fibrils (Fig. 4). When examined using EM, Orb2BΔRBD fibrils were mostly unbundled, occasionally radiating out from a common center, presumably a droplet. In contrast, Orb2AΔRBD fibrils were highly bundled. As can be seen from Figure S5, both fibril types did not show any fine structure or twist at higher magnification and had an average diameter of about 18 nm. As an additional measure of droplet to fibril transition, we measured ThT fluorescence and OD600 kinetics for each Orb2 construct in both HSU and H buffer (Fig. 5). We did not observe any increase in ThT fluorescence in HSU buffer for any of the constructs. In H buffer, Orb2BΔRBD and Orb2AΔRBD showed an increase in fluorescence in a sigmoidal shaped curve typical for cross-β fibril formation. In contrast, Orb2B showed only a negligible increase in fluoresce in H-buffer compared with HSU buffer possibly due to light scattering from droplets. The OD600 curves of Orb2BΔRBD and Orb2AΔRBD decreased in the first 20 h and increased for Orb2AΔRBD after about 25–40 h. Only a slight increase for Orb2BΔRBD was observed after about 60 h. This initial decrease is compatible with the disappearance of Orb2BΔRBD and Orb2AΔRBD droplets. The later increase in scattering for Orb2AΔRBD correlates with the appearance of large, highly bundled fibrils as seen in our EM images that will scatter light much more than the unbundled Orb2BΔRBD fibrils seen by EM. The OD of Orb2B stayed constant during our measurements consistent with the formation of relatively stable droplets. Phase separation of Orb2BΔRBD and Orb2AΔRBD ultimately led to the formation of cross-β fibrils. Next we asked, how does the structure of these fibrils compare with the cryo-EM structure of Orb2 fibrils purified from Drosophila brain (6Hervás R. Murzin A.G. Si K. Implications of the Orb2 amyloid structure in Huntington’s disease.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2020; 21: 6910Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar) and the structure of recombinant Orb2A1−88 fibrils we investigated previously (8Cervantes S.A. Bajakian T.H. Soria M.A. Falk A.S. Service R.J. Langen R. Siemer A.B. Identification and structural characterization of the N-terminal amyloid core of Orb2 isoform A.Sci. Rep. 2016; 6: 38265Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar)? To answer this question, we expressed and purified U-13C -15N labeled Orb2BΔRBD and Orb2AΔRBD. We then prepared fibrils via phase separation for solid-state NMR measurements. One-dimensional 13C spectra of these fibrils are shown in Figure 6. Cross-polarization (CP) spectra detect static protein domains that in the case of cross-β fibrils often coincide with the fibril core. Refocused INEPT spectra, in contrast, are sensitive to dynamic protein regions that are often framing the static fibril core. As seen from the spectra, both Orb2BΔRBD and Orb2AΔRBD fibrils have static and dynamic domains. The aliphatic region of the CP spectra of these two fibril types overlaps relatively well indicating that both fibrils have similar structure. Both CP spectra also show His side chain resonances compatible with a His-rich fibril core. However, the small differences between the spectra indicate that their fibril core structures are not exactly the same. The more intense INEPT spectrum of Orb2BΔRBD indicates that these fibrils have larger dynamic domains. To learn more about the amino acid residues found in the fibril core, we recorded CP-based, 2D 13C -13C DREAM (Fig. 7) spectra that highlight the most immobile residues in the fibrils, which often coincide with its core (8Cervantes S.A. Bajakian T.H. Soria M.A. Falk A.S. Service R.J. Langen R. Siemer A.B. Identification and structural characterization of the N-terminal amyloid core of Orb2 isoform A.Sci.

Advances in studying protein disorder with solid-state NMR.Solid State Nucl. Magn. Reson. 2020; 106: 101643Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). These spectra allowed us to identify the amino acid residue composition of the core, which included Ala, Asn, Gln, His, Ile, Ser, Pro, Thr, and Val. To evaluate how the structure of these fibrils compared with those extracted from Drosophila by Hervás and coworkers, we predicted the NMR chemical shifts of Orb2B residues 178–204 of their cryo-EM structure (i.e., all but the first and last two residues from PDB access code 6VPS) using the program SHIFTX2 (26Han B. Liu Y. Ginzinger S.W. Wishart D.S. SHIFTX2: Significantly improved protein chemical shift prediction.J. Biomol. NMR. 2011; 50: 43Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar) and projected the expected cross-peaks onto our spectra. As can be seen from Figure 7, the predicted Gln Cα-Cβ, Cα-Cγ, and His Cα-Cβ peaks overlap well with the broad peak at about 55 and 32 ppm. In addition, the predicted cross-peak of L198, in the center of the Orb2 core, overlapped perfectly with the Ile Cα-Cβ and Cα-Cγ signals identified in our spectrum. Overall, these data suggest that the Orb2 fibril core determined by cryo-EM is also present in our fibrils. In addition, we identified many intense signals from residues that are not part of the Gln/His-rich core, namely Ala, Asn, Ile, Pro, Thr, and Val. The chemical shift of these resonances is generally compatible with an extended β-sheet conformation. The 2D DREAM spectra confirm that the two fibrils give spectra that are very similar, indicating a similar core structure. Nevertheless, we were able to identify few additional cross-peaks in the DREAM spectrum of Orb2AΔRBD that could not be seen in Orb2BΔRBD. These resonances are highlighted with arrows in Figure 7 and come from Thr, Val, and Ile residues. Interestingly, these resonances do not clearly point to an additional fibril core located at the N-terminal region unique to Orb2AΔRBD as could be expected, because Thr is not found in this N-terminus. We are currently working on the site-specific assignment of these samples to determine the location and structure of the additional static domains and their differences. How do the Gln resonances in our Orb2 fibrils spectra compare with Gln resonances found in spectra of HTTex1 and Sup35p, two proteins that form fibrils with a Gln-rich core? Figure S6A shows the overlay of 2D 13C -13C spectra of Orb2BΔRBD and HTTex1(Q25) fibrils, both of which were formed through phase separation. This overlay shows that the Gln peaks in Orb2BΔRBD do not correspond well to any of the two major Gln peaks (i.e., Gln A and Gln B) in the HTTex1 fibril spectra (27Isas J.M. Langen R. Siemer A.B.

Orb2BΔRBD ′s Cα and Cβ chemical shift is compatible with an extended conformation and in between the shifts observed for Gln A and Gln B in HTTex1. Its side chain Cδ shift is significantly higher than what has been observed for Gln A and GlnB in HTTex1 and compatible with the minor Gln population in HTTex1 termed Gln C. This analysis suggests that the Gln conformations in the cross-β cores of Orb2 and HTTex1 are different. We also compared the Gln resonance assigned in the Q-rich fibril core of Sup35p (33Schütz A.K. Habenstein B. Luckgei N. Bousset L. Sourigues Y. Nielsen A.B. Melki R. Böckmann A. Meier B.H. Solid-state NMR sequential assignments of the amyloid core of full-length Sup35p.Biomol. NMR Assignments. 2014; 8: 349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) with our spectra (Fig. S6B). Many of the Gln Cα-Cβ and Cα-Cγ assignments fit well into the broad Gln resonance observed for Orb2BΔRBD suggesting that they have a similar structure. In the present study, we show that Orb2 can phase separate into droplets that quickly mature and transition into cross-β fibrils in the absence of the C-terminal RBD. Because Orb2 has a domain structure similar to other RNA-binding proteins that phase separate, droplet formation of Orb2 was predicted to occur (10King O.D. Gitler A.D. Shorter J. The tip of the iceberg: RNA-binding proteins with prion-like domains in neurodegenerative disease.Brain Res. 2012; 1462: 61-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). However, Majumdar and coworkers showed that intracellular Orb2A puncta showed little mobility when assessed using FRAP assays suggesting that these were self-assembled oligomers rather than droplets (4Majumdar A. Cesario W.C. White-Grindley E. Jiang H. Ren F. Khan M.R. Li L. Choi E.M.-L. Kannan K. Guo F. Unruh J. Slaughter B. Si K.

We reconcile these two views by showing that Orb2 phase separation does occur. In contrast to other proteins that undergo slow maturation from more liquid to more glass-like droplets with little to no protein mobility, the Orb2 droplets we describe either never go through a liquid phase or this state is so short-lived that we were not able to detect it. In this sense, Orb2 droplets are similar to those formed by the nuclear pore complex protein nucleoporin (34Schmidt M. Rohou A. Lasker K. Yadav J.K. Schiene-Fischer C. Fändrich M. Grigorieff N.

Participants were asked to express their level of agreement with the early-release of hypothetical prisoners. Results showed participants to be less favourable to the early-release of Black compared to White prisoners, when they had committed a stereotypically Black crime. As expected, the congruency between the crime stereotypicality and the colour of the prisoner’s skin did not emerge for White prisoners. Moreover, the difference between the agreement with the release of the Black vs. the White prisoner when both committed a stereotypically Black crime was higher as the level of endorsement of Meritocracy increased. Contrastingly, Anti-egalitarianism only predicted an overall disagreement with prisoners’ early-release. This paper highlights the cumulative explanation by different levels of analysis of this current problem and implications for the development of the public opinion on penal subjects."
https://openalex.org/W3165062089,"Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a bacterial pathogen which is a leading cause of neonatal infection. Currently, there are limited GBS data available from the Indonesian population. In this study, GBS colonization, serotype distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility profile of isolates were investigated among pregnant women in Jakarta, Indonesia. Demographics data, clinical characteristics and vaginal swabs were collected from 177 pregnant women (mean aged: 28.7 years old) at 29-40 weeks of gestation. Bacterial culture identification tests and latex agglutination were performed for GBS. Serotyping was done by conventional multiplex PCR and antibiotic susceptibility testing by broth microdilution. GBS colonization was found in 53 (30%) pregnant women. Serotype II was the most common serotype (30%) followed by serotype III (23%), Ia and IV (13% each), VI (8%), Ib and V (6% each), and one non-typeable strain. All isolates were susceptible to vancomycin, penicillin, ampicillin, cefotaxime, daptomycin and linezolid. The majority of GBS were resistant to tetracycline (89%) followed by clindamycin (21%), erythromycin (19%), and levofloxacin (6%). The serotype III was more resistant to erythromycin, clindamycin, and levofloxacin and these isolates were more likely to be multidrug resistant (6 out of 10) compared to other serotypes. This report provides demographics of GBS colonization and isolate characterization in pregnant women in Indonesia. The results may facilitate preventive strategies to reduce neonatal GBS infection and improve its treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3165840630,"Undiagnosed hypertension is defined as individuals who were hypertensive but did not report having been told by a health professional that they have hypertension. It is an important risk factor for development of chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality. Despite those problems and benefits of finding individuals with undiagnosed hypertension to prevent its outcomes, no enough investigations have been done regarding the prevalence and associated factors of undiagnosed hypertension. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of undiagnosed hypertension and its associated factors among bank workers in Ethiopia.An institutional based cross-sectional study was held at Bahir Dar city bank workers. The simple random sampling technique was used to select the study participants. Self-administered structured questionnaire and physical measurement were used to collect data. The data were entered into EPI data 3.1 versions and exported to SPSS version 23.0 statistical software for further analysis. In order to decide the association between independent and dependent variables; multivariate logistic regression analysis was implemented. A P-value of < 0.05 was used as the criterion for statistical significance and OR with 95% confidence interval was used to indicate the strength of association.In this study from a total of 524 participants 513 were completed the questionnaire correctly, which gives a response rate of 97.9%. The overall prevalence of undiagnosed hypertension among bank workers was 24.8% with (95% CI 21.1-28.5). Multivariate logistic regression revealed that age 35-44 [AOR = 2.56, 95% CI: (1.60-4.09)], being male [AOR = 3.61, 95% CI: (1.84-7.05)], having moderate knowledge [AOR = 3.81, 95% CI: (2.29-6.34)], having poor knowledge [AOR = 6.19, 95% CI: (3.07-)12.48], and being physically inactivity [AOR = 2.91, 95% CI: (1.26-6.76)] were variables significantly associated with undiagnosed hypertension.The prevalence of undiagnosed hypertension among bank workers in Bahir Dar city was found to be high. An age group of 35-44 years, being male, having moderate and poor knowledge and being physically inactivity was the variables that were significantly associated with undiagnosed hypertension. Therefore, creating awareness, frequent screening and implementation of an appropriate intervention for this vulnerable group is important."
https://openalex.org/W3164253487,"Venous malformations (VMs) are slow-flow malformations of the venous vasculature and are the most common type of vascular malformation with a prevalence of 1%. Germline and somatic mutations have been shown to contribute to VM pathogenesis, but how these mutations affect VM pathobiology is not well understood. The goal of this study was to characterize VM endothelial and mural cell expression by performing a comprehensive expression analysis of VM vasculature. VM specimens (n = 16) were stained for pan-endothelial, arterial, venous, and endothelial progenitor cell proteins; proliferation was assessed with KI67. Endothelial cells in the VM vessels were abnormally orientated and improperly specified, as seen by the misexpression of both arterial and endothelial cell progenitor proteins not observed in control vessels. Consistent with arterialization of the endothelial cells, VM vessels were often surrounded by multiple layers of disorganized mural cells. VM endothelium also had a significant increase in proliferative endothelial cells, which may contribute to the dilated channels seen in VMs. Together the expression analysis indicates that the VM endothelium is misspecified and hyperproliferative, suggesting that VMs are biologically active lesions, consistent with clinical observations of VM progression over time."
https://openalex.org/W3164839672,"Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is a multidrug-resistant bacterium with no precise clinical treatment. This bacterium can be a vital cause for death and different organ failures in immune-compromised, immune-competent, and long-time hospitalized patients. Extensive quorum sensing capability has become a challenge to develop new drugs against this pathogen. Moreover, the organism possesses about 789 proteins which function, structure, and pathogenesis remain obscured. In this piece of work, we tried to enlighten the aforementioned sectors using highly reliable bioinformatics tools validated by the scientific community. At first, the whole proteome sequence of the organism was retrieved and stored. Then we separated the hypothetical proteins and searched for the conserved domain with a high confidence level and multi-server validation, which resulted in 24 such proteins. Furthermore, all of their physical and chemical characterizations were performed, such as theoretical isoelectric point, molecular weight, GRAVY value, and many more. Besides, the subcellular localization, protein-protein interactions, functional motifs, 3D structures, antigenicity, and virulence factors were also evaluated. As an extension of this work, 'RTFAMSSER' and 'PAAPQPSAS' were predicted as potential T and B cell epitopes, respectively. We hope our findings will help in better understating the pathogenesis and smoothen the way to the cure."
https://openalex.org/W3165025831,Diaphanous related formins are highly conserved proteins regulated by Rho-GTPases that act as actin nucleation and assembly factors. Here we report the functional characterization of a non-inherited heterozygous FMNL2 p.L136P mutation carried by a patient who presented with severe very early onset inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We found that the FMNL2 L136P protein displayed subcellular mislocalization and deregulated protein autoinhibition indicating gain-of-function mechanism. Expression of FMNL2 L136P impaired cell spreading as well as filopodia formation. THP-1 macrophages expressing FMNL2 L136P revealed dysregulated podosome formation and a defect in matrix degradation. Our data indicate that the L136P mutation affects cellular actin dynamics in fibroblasts and immune cells such as macrophages.
https://openalex.org/W3165798725,"LSCI technique provides experimental data which can be considered in the context of spatial blood flow coherency. Analysis of vascular tone oscillations gives additional information to ensure a better understanding of the mechanisms affecting microvascular physiology. The oscillations with different frequencies are due to different physiological mechanisms. The reasons for the generation of peripheral blood flow oscillations in the 0.14-0.6 Hz frequency band are as follows: cardio-respiratory interactions, pressure variations in the venous part of the circulatory system, and the effect of the sympathetic nervous system on the vascular tone. Earlier, we described the spatial heterogeneity of around 0.3 Hz oscillations and this motivated us to continue the research to find the conditions for the occurrence of spatial phase synchronization. For this purpose, a number of physiological tests (controlled respiration, breath holder, and venous occlusion tests) which influence the blood flow oscillations of 0.14-0.6 Hz were considered, an appropriate measurement system and the required data processing algorithms were developed. At spontaneous respiration, the oscillations with frequencies around 0.3 Hz were stochastic, whereas all the performed tests induced an increase in spatial coherence. The protocols and methods proposed here can help to clarify whether the heterogeneity of respiratory-related blood flow oscillations exists on the skin surface."
https://openalex.org/W3164137141,"Specific personality traits may affect the ability of nurses to deal with patient death. The relationship between personality and death coping self-efficacy (DCS) has rarely been investigated in the palliative care setting. In this study, we explored the associations between different personality profiles and DCS in clinical nurses from general wards and ICU.A cross-sectional survey of 572 Chinese nurses was conducted between August and September 2020, by way of a self-administered questionnaire.Among the Big Five Personality Traits, in nurses the score was highest for conscientiousness and lowest for neuroticism. With regard to DCS, nurses scored highly on the intention of hospice care. The Big Five Personality Traits were found to explain 20.2% of the overall variation in DCS. Openness, agreeableness and conscientiousness were significantly associated with DCS in nurses.Nursing managers should pay attention to differences in personality characteristics and provide personalized and targeted nursing education. This should improve nurses' DCS, enrich their professional development and promote high quality palliative care for patients and their families."
https://openalex.org/W3164947657,"In this randomized controlled trial on four commercial grazing dairy farms, we investigated whether pegbovigrastim (PEG) treatment affects clinical mastitis (CM) and uterine disease (i.e. retained placenta (RP), metritis and endometritis) occurrence during a full lactation. The association of prepartum body condition score and prepartum non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) concentration with disease occurrence was also evaluated. Holstein cows were randomly assigned to one of two treatments: first PEG dose approximately 7 d before the expected calving date and a second dose within 24 h after calving (PEG) compared to untreated controls (Control). In total, 2,153 animals were included in the study: 733 primiparous cows (Control = 391, PEG = 342) and 1420 multiparous cows (Control = 723, PEG = 697). Treatment effects were evaluated with generalized linear mixed models and Cox's proportional hazard models. Treatment with PEG reduced the occurrence of a first case of CM during the first 30 days in milk (DIM) by 24.6% and reduced the hazard of a first case and the rate of total cases of CM during the full lactation. All PEG treatment effects were independent of parity. Prepartum body condition score interacted with PEG treatment: in over-conditioned cows, PEG reduced the occurrence of a first case of CM during the first 30 DIM by 49.5%. The hazard analysis of a first case of CM during the full lactation suggested that the preventive effect of PEG disappeared with increasing DIM. Treatment with PEG did not affect the occurrence of RP or metritis. Pegbovigrastim treated cows with metritis subsequently showed a reduced occurrence of endometritis compared to control cows with metritis. Pegbovigrastim reduces the occurrence of CM particularly in cows at risk of elevated lipid mobilization, and PEG ameliorates the uterine healing process in cows that experienced metritis."

However, improved tools to distinguish between low-risk and high-risk cancer are needed in order to select the appropriate treatment.To investigate the diagnostic potential of signal fractions estimated from a two-component model using combined T2- and diffusion-weighted imaging (T2-DWI).62 patients with prostate cancer and 14 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) underwent combined T2-DWI (TE = 55 and 73 ms, b-values = 50 and 700 s/mm2) following clinical suspicion of cancer, providing a set of 4 measurements per voxel. Cancer was confirmed in post-MRI biopsy, and regions of interest (ROIs) were delineated based on radiology reporting. Signal fractions of the slow component (SFslow) of the proposed two-component model were calculated from a model fit with 2 free parameters, and compared to conventional bi- and mono-exponential apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) models.All three models showed a significant difference (p<0.0001) between peripheral zone (PZ) tumor and normal tissue ROIs, but not between non-PZ tumor and BPH ROIs. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve distinguishing tumor from prostate voxels was 0.956, 0.949 and 0.949 for the two-component, bi-exponential and mono-exponential models, respectively. The corresponding Spearman correlation coefficients between tumor values and Gleason Grade Group were fair (0.370, 0.499 and -0.490), but not significant.Signal fraction estimates from a two-component model based on combined T2-DWI can differentiate between tumor and normal prostate tissue and show potential for prostate cancer diagnosis. The model performed similarly to conventional diffusion models."

Eurostat, World Bank and the World Economic Forum data for 2015–2019 were used for the purpose of the research. The research was divided into three stages, i.e. assessment of economic development on the basis of a synthetic ratio of economic anchor development, for which a relative benchmark method based on spatial median (so-called L1 median or Weber point) was used, identification of conditions for the development of entrepreneurial capacity and statistical analysis showing the correlation between economic anchor measures and selected factors of the 3SI countries economic development. Our study found that the entrepreneurial capacity of the 3SI countries in 2015–2019 was determined by nine characteristics, belonging to six areas, i.e. local economy, demographic situation, social situation, trade exchange, innovation and tourism economy. The entrepreneurial potential of the 3SI countries was spatially diversified, and its development was determined, among others, by the entrepreneurial activity of residents (entrepreneurship index) and the conditions for running a business."
https://openalex.org/W3165234296,"Emergency Department (ED)-based HIV counseling and testing (HCT) has had a significant impact on improving rates of HIV diagnosis and linkage to care. Unfortunately, expansion of this strategy to low- and middle-income countries has been limited. Successful implementation of ED-based HCT is dependent on patient and provider acceptance of the intervention, and their attitudes and pre-existing biases towards the disease. This study sought to develop validated survey instruments to assess attitudes towards ED-based HCT.This cross-sectional study surveyed patients and providers in three EDs in the Eastern Cape province, South Africa. A convenience sample of patients and providers in the ED were surveyed. Exploratory factor analysis was conducted using questions on attitudes to HIV testing to develop validated survey instruments. An ANOVA test assessed variance in attitudes towards HCT based on demographic variables collected.A total of 104 patient and 132 provider surveys were completed. Exploratory factor analysis resulted in a 17- and 7-question attitudes survey for patients and providers, respectively. Overall, 92.3% of patients and 70.7% of providers supported ED-based HCT, however, both groups displayed only mildly positive attitudes. Questions representing 'confidentiality' and 'stigma around HIV testing' had the least positive influence on patients' overall attitudes. Questions representing 'comfort with HIV testing' had the least positive influence on providers' overall attitudes.Our study demonstrated ED patients and providers are generally supportive of ED-based HCT. A validated survey instrument was able to provide a standardized approach to identify barriers to HCT implementation in an ED setting, across contexts. For successful implementation, behavioral interventions must focus on strengthening patient beliefs around confidentiality and the consent process, and providers' comfort levels with providing HIV testing services in the ED."
https://openalex.org/W3165285988,"How reduced femoral neck anteversion alters the distribution of pressure and contact area in Hip Resurfacing Arthroplasty (HRA) remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to quantitatively describe the biomechanical implication of different femoral neck version angles on HRA using a finite element analysis.A total of sixty models were constructed to assess the effect of different femoral neck version angles on three different functional loads: 0°of hip flexion, 45°of hip flexion, and 90° of hip flexion. Femoral version was varied between 30° of anteversion to 30° of retroversion. All models were tested with the acetabular cup in four different positions: (1) 40°/15° (inclination/version), (2) 40°/25°, (3) 50°/15°, and (4) 50°/25°. Differences in range of motion due to presence of impingement, joint contact pressure, and joint contact area with different femoral versions and acetabular cup positions were calculated.Impingement was found to be most significant with the femur in 30° of retroversion, regardless of acetabular cup position. Anterior hip impingement occurred earlier during hip flexion as the femur was progressively retroverted. Impingement was reduced in all models by increasing acetabular cup inclination and anteversion, yet this consequentially led to higher contact pressures. At 90° of hip flexion, contact pressures and contact areas were inversely related and showed most notable change with 30° of femoral retroversion. In this model, the contact area migrated towards the anterior implant-bone interface along the femoral neck.Femoral retroversion in HRA influences impingement and increases joint contact pressure most when the hip is loaded in flexion. Increasing acetabular inclination decreases the area of impingement but doing so causes a reciprocal increase in joint contact pressure. It may be advisable to study femoral neck version pre-operatively to better choose hip resurfacing arthroplasty candidates."

https://openalex.org/W3164223983,"Turkey ranks second in watermelon (Citrullus lunatus L.) production globally and the highest production is witnessed for Çukurova plains the country. Although watermelon is extensively cultivated in the Çukurova region, studies on optimum nitrogen (N) and boron (B) doses for watermelon cultivation are quite limited. This study, evaluated the impact of increasing N (0, 90, 180 and 270 kg ha-1) and B (0 and 2 kg ha-1 B) doses on nutrient uptake in rind (exocarp) and flesh (endocarp) of watermelon fruit. Grafted watermelon variety 'Starburst', widely cultivated in the region was used as experimental material. The concentrations of different macro and micronutrients were analyzed from fruit rind and flesh. Individual and interactive effect of N and B doses significantly altered macro and micronutrients' uptake in rind and flesh. Higher amounts of macro and micronutrients were accumulated in rind than flesh. Nutrients' uptake was increased with increasing N doses, whereas B had limited impact. The accumulated nutrients were within the safe limits for human consumption. The N concentrations of rind and flesh increased with increasing N dose. Similarly, B concentration in rind and flesh and N concentration in rind significantly increased, while N concentration in flesh decreased with B application. It was concluded that 270 kg ha-1 N and 2 kg ha-1 B are optimum for better nutrient uptake in watermelon fruit. Thus, these doses must be used for watermelon cultivation in Çukurova plains of the country."

Standard LASIK treatment parameters were used for the experiment. After LASIK flap creation, the corneal stromal roughness was assessed using a JPK NanoWizard II® AFM in contact mode immersed in liquid. Olympus OMCL-RC800PSA commercial silicon nitride cantilever tips were used. Surface measurements were made in 10 regions of the central cornea of each sample measuring 20 x 20 microns, at 512 x 512 point resolution. Roughness was measured using the root-mean-square (RMS) value within the given regions.Measurements from 30 regions of the 3 eyes (10 measurements per eye) in the Intralase (FS1) group, and 30 regions of the 3 eyes (10 measurements per eye) in the VisuMax (FS2) group were analyzed. There was a statistically significant difference in mean ± standard deviation RMS values between the FS1 and the FS2 groups (360 ± 120 versus 230 ± 100 nm respectively; P< 0.00001).This AFM study indicates that the surface of the stromal bed after LASIK flap creation is smoother in the FS2 group than the FS1 group."

But because of the surge of cases in India that began in late March, the company stopped exporting doses. The COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) Facility, a nonprofit set up to purchase and distribute vaccines equitably, found itself short of 90 million doses it had hoped to deliver by the end of May to low- and middle-income countries. Some say the Indian government could have avoided this dilemma had it prepurchased vaccines from many companies, as several countries did, and did not rely so heavily on Serum for its domestic needs. Adar Poonawalla, CEO of the family-owned business, urges other companies to supply COVAX with their own authorized products. Serum has recently increased capacity, but the company now says it may not export until the end of the year, further complicating efforts for COVAX and the world at large."
