https://openalex.org/W2029195137,"An algorithm was developed which facilitates the search for similarities between newly determined amino acid sequences and sequences already available in databases. Because of the algorithm's efficiency on many microcomputers, sensitive protein database searches may now become a routine procedure for molecular biologists. The method efficiently identifies regions of similar sequence and then scores the aligned identical and differing residues in those regions by means of an amino acid replacability matrix. This matrix increases sensitivity by giving high scores to those amino acid replacements which occur frequently in evolution. The algorithm has been implemented in a computer program designed to search protein databases very rapidly. For example, comparison of a 200-amino-acid sequence to the 500,000 residues in the National Biomedical Research Foundation library would take less than 2 minutes on a minicomputer, and less than 10 minutes on a microcomputer (IBM PC)."

https://openalex.org/W1990719254,"A population genetic survey of over 200 structural loci previously revealed that the South African cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus jubatus) has an extreme paucity of genetic variability, probably as a consequence of a severe population bottleneck in its recent past. The genetic monomorphism of the species is here extended to the major histocompatibility complex, since 14 reciprocal skin grafts between unrelated cheetahs were accepted. The apparent consequences of such genetic uniformity to the species include (i) great difficulty in captive breeding, (ii) a high degree of juvenile mortality in captivity and in the wild, and (iii) a high frequency of spermatozoal abnormalities in ejaculates. The species vulnerability of the cheetah was demonstrated by an epizootic of coronavirus-associated feline infectious peritonitis in an Oregon breeding colony in 1983. Exposure and spread of the coronavirus, which has a very low morbidity in domestic cats (approximately 1 percent), has decimated a heretofore productive and healthy captive population. The extreme genetic monomorphism, especially at the major histocompatibility complex, and the apparent hypersensitivity of the cheetah to a viral pathogen may be related, and provide a biological basis for understanding the adaptive significance of abundant genetic variation in outbred mammalian species."

https://openalex.org/W2046731801,"Discrete receptor sites for calcitonin (CT) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) were found in the nervous system and in peripheral tissues. Each peptide was capable of cross-reacting with the specific receptor of the other. In contrast to CT receptors, CGRP receptors were not linked to adenylate cyclase. However, CGRP could stimulate adenylate cyclase in CT target tissues apparently by interacting with CT receptors. The relative abilities of CGRP and mammalian CT to inhibit CT binding suggest that CGRP could serve as an endogenous ligand for CT receptors in the central nervous system."

https://openalex.org/W1515230561,"Abstract Previous studies indicated that enrichment of the GlcNAc beta 1----6Man alpha 1---- group with concomitant decrease of the GlcNAc beta 1----4Man alpha 1---- group occurs in the complex-type asparagine-linked sugar chains of the membrane glycoproteins of baby hamster kidney cells transformed by polyoma virus. The enzymatic basis of the chemical change is reported in this paper. By using oligosaccharides isolated from the urine of patients with a variety of exoglycosidase deficiencies, beta-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases in the cell homogenate were successfully assayed separately. Both baby hamster kidney cells and their polyoma transformants contain beta-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases I, II, IV, V, and VI, but not beta-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III. The beta-N-acetylglucosamine residue added by each beta-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GnT) is shown below. (formula see text) Comparative studies of the specific activities of the five beta-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases in the two cell lines revealed that the value of beta-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V in the polyoma transformant was twice of that in the normal cells, while those of the other four transferases in the two cell lines were not significantly different. Therefore the increase in beta-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V may be the direct cause of the changes found in the sugar chains of surface glycoproteins in baby hamster kidney cells transformed by polyoma virus."
https://openalex.org/W1819850013,"The purified carbon monoxide dehydrogenase from Clostridium thermoaceticum is the only protein required to catalyze an exchange reaction between carbon monoxide and the carbonyl group of acetyl-CoA. This exchange requires that the CO dehydrogenase bind the methyl, the carbonyl, and the CoA groups of acetyl-CoA, then equilibrate the carbonyl with CO in the solution and re-form acetyl-CoA. CoA is not necessary for the exchange and, in fact, inhibits the reaction. These studies support the view that CO dehydrogenase is the condensing enzyme that forms acetyl-CoA from its component parts. Carbon dioxide also exchanges with the C-1 of acetyl-CoA, but at a much lower rate than does CO. At 50 degrees C and pH 5.3, the optimal pH, the turnover number is 70 mol of CO exchanged per min/mol of enzyme. Low potential electron carriers are stimulatory. The Km app for stimulation by ferredoxin is 50-fold less than the value for flavodoxin. Neither ATP or Pi stimulate the exchange. The EPR spectrum of the CO-reacted enzyme is markedly changed by binding of CoA or acetyl-CoA. Arginine residues of the CO dehydrogenase appear to be involved in the active site, possibly by binding acetyl-CoA. Mersalyl acid, methyl iodide, 5,5-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoate), and sodium dithionite inhibit the exchange reaction. A scheme is presented to account for the role of CO dehydrogenase in the exchange reaction and in the synthesis of acetate."

https://openalex.org/W2053289621,Guinea pigs were vaccinated with truncated herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) glycoprotein D produced in the genetically engineered mammalian cell line gD10.2. Vaccinated animals formed antibodies that neutralized both HSV-1 and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) in an in vitro neutralization assay. Vaccinated animals were challenged with HSV-2 by intravaginal infection. Animals that received the immunogen in Freund's complete adjuvant were completely protected from the clinical manifestations of genital HSV-2 infection. Animals that received the immunogen incorporated in alum adjuvants were partly protected from clinical disease; the infections that did develop were significantly less severe than those that occurred in control animals injected with adjuvant alone. The results demonstrate that immunization with a purified viral protein can provide significant protection against primary genital infection by HSV-2 in guinea pigs.
https://openalex.org/W1486875089,"The globular domain of type IV collagen from bovine glomerular basement membrane was solubilized by collagenase digestion. Components of this domain include several monomer-size and structurally related dimer-size polypeptides. The monomer-size polypeptides were resolved into three fractions (M1, M2, and M3) with slightly different mobilities upon sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (nonreduced Mr = 24,500-28,300). Chemical and immunochemical studies indicate that each is a distinct component. M2 is reactive with antibodies from patients with Goodpasture syndrome. The molecular weight by sedimentation equilibrium was 32,000 for M2 and 28,000 for M1. The dimers were characterized as two classes, D1 and D2. D1 consists of two sets of nonreactive components (D1a-d and D1a,c) whereas D2 contains one set of four components (D2a-d), each of which is reactive with Goodpasture sera. Chemical and immunochemical studies indicate that a monomer-dimer relationship exists between M1 and D1 and between M2 and D2. The origin of M3 remains undetermined. Rabbit antibodies to type IV collagen alpha chains react with M1 and M2, and antibodies to M1 and M2 react with type IV collagen alpha chains, which provides additional evidence for the localization of the Goodpasture antigen to one of the chains of type IV collagen."
https://openalex.org/W2038949418,"Light is produced by recombinant Escherichia coli that contain lux genes cloned from the marine bacterium Vibrio fischeri. The bioluminescence phenotype requires genes for regulatory and biochemical functions, the latter encoded by five lux genes contained in a single operon. These lux genes were disconnected from their native promoter and inserted into the transposon mini-Mu. The resulting transposon, mini-Mulux, could induce mutations by insertional inactivation of a target gene, and the lux DNA was oriented to align target gene transcription with that of the lux genes. Genes in Escherichia coli and Vibrio parahaemolyticus were mutagenized, and mutants containing transposon-generated lux gene fusions produced light as a function of target gene transcription. Light production offers a simple, sensitive, in vivo indicator of gene expression."

https://openalex.org/W1493985344,"The effect of beta-adrenergic stimulation on sarcolemmal protein phosphorylation was examined in intact ventricular myocardium. Isolated guinea pig ventricles were perfused via the coronary arteries with 32Pi after which membrane vesicles enriched 3-5-fold in sarcolemma were isolated by differential centrifugation followed by sucrose gradient centrifugation. Perfusion of hearts with isoproterenol stimulated 32P incorporation into a protein of apparent molecular weight of 15,000, which copurified with sarcolemmal vesicles. The increase in 32P incorporation was rapid in onset and elevated 2.5-3.0-fold after 30-45 s exposure of hearts to 100 nM isoproterenol. A positive correlation was found between stimulation of phosphorylation of the 15-kDa protein and the increase in the maximal rate of developed tension in intact ventricles after administration of isoproterenol. Phosphorylated phospholamban (most likely present as a contaminant) was also identified in the same sarcolemmal preparations. However, phospholamban and the 15-kDa sarcolemmal substrate were different proteins. Boiling of the membrane samples in sodium dodecyl sulfate prior to electrophoresis dissociated the high Mr form of phospholamban into the form of lower Mr but did not alter the mobility of the 15-kDa protein in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. The 15-kDa protein did not undergo the electrophoretic mobility shift that is characteristic of phospholamban after cAMP-dependent phosphorylation nor did it cross-react with a highly specific phospholamban antibody. In vitro phosphorylation experiments conducted with the unmasking agent Triton X-100 suggested that the 15-kDa protein was localized to the cytoplasmic surfaces of sarcolemmal vesicles. These results demonstrate phosphorylation of a sarcolemmal protein, distinct from phospholamban, in response to beta-adrenergic stimulation of the heart. Phosphorylation of the sarcolemmal 15-kDa protein may play a role in mediating the effects of beta-adrenergic agonists on cardiac contractile force."
https://openalex.org/W1605931688,"Human high density lipoprotein (HDL), devoid of apolipoproteins E or B, binds with high affinity and specificity to cultured cells derived from several tissues. In order to investigate the ligand specificity of the putative receptor, we have performed competitive inhibition studies to identify the components of high density lipoprotein that bind to cell surfaces of rat adrenal cortical cells and human skin fibroblasts. Radiolabeled HDL3 was displaced with unlabeled apolipoprotein-dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine recombinant particles containing AI, AII, CIII-1, and E apolipoproteins, but not by dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine complexed to albumin or by low density lipoprotein. Because exchange may readily occur between apolipoproteins in HDL and in recombinants this observation may not be truly representative of ligand competition. Further experiments using Fab fragments prepared from pure IgG to each apolipoprotein showed that binding of radioiodinated HDL to cells was suppressed following preincubation of HDL with Fab fragments raised against apolipoproteins AI or AII but not against apolipoproteins E or CIII-1 or albumin. In additional studies with apolipoprotein recombinants specific saturable binding was demonstrated between apo-AI or -AII recombinants and adrenocortical cells whereas binding of apo-CIII-2 was characterized by a large nonsaturable component which almost equaled the specific binding. The data, therefore, provide evidence for the involvement of the two major apolipoproteins (AI and AII) in HDL recognition by cellular receptors."

Part of this open reading frame has been fused to the lacZ gene and expressed in Escherichia coli.

In addition to containing the gag, pol, and env genes of the chronic leukemia viruses, the genome of HTLV-I contains a long open reading frame (LOR) located between the 3' end of the envelope gene and the 3' long terminal repeat sequence (LTR). It has been suggested that a protein of 42 kilodaltons that is encoded by the LOR region may participate in both trans-acting transcriptional regulation of the viral LTR as well as in the transforming properties of HTLV-I. It is reported here that a significant fraction of the 42-kilodalton HTLV LOR product is located in the nucleus of HTLV-I-infected transformed lymphocytes, a finding that is consistent with its proposed functions."
https://openalex.org/W1516090436,"The azidyl radical is formed during the oxidation of sodium azide by the catalase/hydrogen peroxide system, as detected by the ESR spin-trapping technique. The oxidation of azide by horseradish peroxidase, chloroperoxidase, lactoperoxidase, and myeloperoxidase also forms azidyl radical. It is suggested that the evolution of nitrogen gas and nitrogen oxides reported in the azide/catalase/hydrogen peroxide system results from reactions of the azidyl radical. The azide/horseradish peroxidase/hydrogen peroxide system consumes oxygen, and this oxygen uptake is inhibited by the spin trap 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide, presumably due to the competition with oxygen for the azidyl radical. Although azide is used routinely as an inhibitor of myeloperoxidase and catalase, some consideration should be given to the biochemical consequences of the formation of the highly reactive azidyl radical by the peroxidase activity of these enzymes."

Results described in this report identify a region of the viral genome that is required for oncogenicity in owl monkeys (Aotus trivirgatus); this region is not required for replication of the virus. This is believed to be the first such genomic region identified in a herpesvirus system."
https://openalex.org/W2024667058,"Fifty of 75 serum samples collected in the West Nile district of Uganda between August 1972 and July 1973 contained antibodies reactive with human T-cell leukemia (lymphotropic) virus type 3 (HTLV-III; mean titer, 601), while 12 of 75 samples were positive in a similar test for HTLV type 1 (HTLV-1) antibodies (mean titer, 236). The samples were screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and positive results were confirmed by a newly developed unlabeled antibody-peroxidase procedure with enhanced sensitivity for detection of antibody binding to immunoblots of HTLV-III antigen, demonstrating antibodies to proteins with molecular weights of 24,000, 41,000, and 76,000 in nearly all positive samples. Analysis of titration data indicated enhanced titers of antibody against HTLV-III and HTLV-I when coinfection occurred. The high prevalence and relatively low titers [compared to serum from patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)] of antibodies recognizing HTLV-III proteins in sera from this population at a time that may predate or coincide with the appearance or spread of the AIDS agent (HTLV-III) suggest that the virus detected may have been a predecessor of HTLV-III or is HTLV-III itself but existing in a population acclimated to its presence. It further suggests an African origin of HTLV-III."

The efficacy of several of these compounds has been demonstrated in rigorously controlled trials. Advances in molecular virology have led to the identification of biochemically defined, virus-specific functions that serve as appropriate targets for the future development of antiviral compounds. Clinical investigators and practicing physicians are now confronting questions previously raised with the use of antibacterial antibiotics. These questions concern appropriate routes of administration for antiviral compounds, optimal dosage regimens, risks of long-term prophylaxis, and the emergence of resistant organisms."
https://openalex.org/W1602506816,"The gastric H,K-ATPase is an active transport protein that is responsible for the maintenance of a large pH gradient across the secretory canaliculus of the mammalian parietal cell. Acid secretion across these epithelial cell membranes is coupled to the potassium-stimulated hydrolysis of ATP catalyzed by H,K-ATPase, but the mechanism of coupling between ion transport and ATP hydrolysis is unknown. In order to investigate the enzymatic mechanism of this coupling, a peptide derived from the ATP binding site of H,K-ATPase has been purified and its amino acid sequence has been determined. The peptide was identified by the incorporation of a fluorescent probe, fluorescein 5'-isothiocyanate (FITC), into the active site before trypsin digestion of the protein. The labeling of the enzyme by FITC was associated with the irreversible inhibition of enzymatic activity, and both the labeling of the tryptic peptide and inhibition of activity were prevented when the reaction was performed in the presence of ATP. At 100% inhibition of activity, 3.5 +/- 1.6 nmol of FITC were incorporated per mg of protein. The amino acid sequence of the active site peptide is His-Val-Leu-Val-Met-Lys-Gly-Ala-Pro-Glu-Gln-Leu-Ser-Ile-Arg, and FITC reacts with the lysine. This sequence is very similar to sequences of fluorescein-labeled peptides from the ATP binding sites of Na,K-ATPase and Ca2+-ATPase, and suggests that the active site structures of these ion transport ATPases are similar."

https://openalex.org/W1546013835,"The sn-1,2-diacylglycerol kinase structural gene from Escherichia coli was demonstrated to be the dgkA locus previously sequenced (Lightner, V. A., Bell, R. M., and Modrich, P. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 10856-10861). The dgkA gene product was shown by maxicell analysis to be an Mr = 14,000 membrane-bound protein. When dgkA was placed on a hybrid plasmid under control of the lambda pL promoter, a 100-fold overproduction of diacylglycerol kinase activity was obtained. Diacylglycerol kinase was solubilized from membranes with 2-propanol/heptane/trifluoroacetic acid and purified to near homogeneity by high performance liquid chromatography. Activity was reconstituted in a mixed micellar assay containing beta-octylglucoside, cardiolipin, and sn-1,2-dioleoylglycerol. Amino acid analysis, partial NH2-terminal analysis and COOH-terminal analysis permitted alignment of the polypeptide on the sequenced gene. The data establish that dgkA is the structural gene for the diacylglycerol kinase and establish the primary structure of the enzyme of 122 residues, 13,245 daltons. Secondary structure analysis predicted a protein conformation consisting of three transmembrane alpha-helical segments, an amphipathic helix, and an alpha-helix. Taken together, the predicted helical segments comprise more than 75% of the polypeptide."

Viral Harvey ras p21, cloned into Escherichia coli HB101 lambda/pRAS1, has been purified to homogeneity by a three-step procedure. The purified E. coli p21 can be bound by a monoclonal antibody to viral Harvey ras p21 and has an amino acid composition consistent with that predicted from its DNA sequence. Purified E. coli p21 has been shown by HPLC analysis on an ion-exchange column to contain near stoichiometric amounts of GDP. This noncovalently associated GDP is seen in the UV absorption spectrum of the purified protein. The noncovalently associated GDP acts as a competitive inhibitor of the interaction of added guanine nucleotides with p21."
https://openalex.org/W1496647547,"A RNA was identified in the anaerobic, parasitic protozoan Trichomonas vaginalis. Electron microscopic evidence indicated linear double-stranded structure 1.5 micron in length, with no apparent hairpins or loops. Boiling in 30% dimethyl sulfoxide denatured it into single strands of 1.5 micron and shorter fragments. It consists of 23.4% G, 23.4% C, 23.0% A, and 30.3% U and melts at a transition temperature of 81.7 degrees C in 75 mM NaCl and 7.5 mM sodium citrate, pH 7.0, with 7-15% hyperchromicity. The 32P-labeled double-stranded RNA hybridized specifically with T. vaginalis DNA fragments in a single DNA band from EcoRI digest and two DNA bands from HindIII digest. Of the 33 different strains or isolates of T. vaginalis examined, all contained this double-stranded RNA. However, the only two metronidazole-resistant T. vaginalis strains examined thus far (IR78 and 85) contained no detectable double-stranded RNA, although the corresponding DNA sequence was present. DNA fragments of Escherichia coli and Giardia lamblia did not hybridize with the double-stranded RNA. But DNA fragments of a metronidazole-sensitive Tritrichomonas foetus hybridized specifically with the double-stranded RNA, even though this organism does not contain the double-stranded RNA itself."

https://openalex.org/W2117785188,"To examine the role of divalent cations in the generation of superoxide anion (O2-) by the NADPH oxidase system of phagocytic cells, membrane-rich fractions were prepared from human neutrophils and monocytes. O2- generation by the fractions in sucrose was enhanced by addition of Ca2+ or Mg2+. EDTA inhibited most of the O2- generation; Ca2+ or Mg2+ reversed the inhibition. Zn2+, Mn2+, or Cu2+ completely inhibited O2- production. Neutrophil membrane fraction solubilized with Triton X-100, then passed through a chelating column, lost 80% of its oxidase activity; the loss could be reversed by addition of Ca2+ or Mg2+. Addition of 0.3 mM Ca2+ or Mg2+ protected against thermal instability of the enzyme. Kinetic analysis of the neutrophil oxidase activity as a function of NADPH and Ca2+ or Mg2+ concentrations showed that cation did not interact with NADPH in solution or affect the binding of NADPH to the oxidase; rather, cation bound directly to the oxidase, or to some associated regulatory component, to activate the enzyme. For the neutrophil oxidase, the Km for NADPH was 51 +/- 6 (S.D.) microM. Hyperbolic saturation was observed with Ca2+ and Mg2+, and the Kd values were 1.9 +/- 0.3 and 2.9 +/- 0.3 microM, respectively, suggesting that the oxidase, or some associated component, has a relatively high-affinity binding site for Ca2+ and Mg2+."
https://openalex.org/W1568687764,"Abstract Beef heart cytochrome c oxidase has been depleted of subunit III by treatment with chymotrypsin. The removal of subunit III has been evaluated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and gel fluorography of preparations of the oxidase labeled with [14C]dicyclohexylcarbodiimide prior to proteolysis. Removal of subunit III resulted in a perturbation of the visible spectrum of reduced cytochrome oxidase. Subunit III-depleted oxidase is spectroscopically very similar to the oxidase from Paracoccus denitrificans. When reconstituted into liposomes, the depleted enzyme still pumped protons in response to a pulse of reduced cytochrome c. The H+/e- stoichiometry averaged 0.5. Redox-linked proton translocation could be observed only when respiratory control ratios were higher than 3 and the reductant pulse was of a magnitude that allowed for no more than 5 turnovers of the oxidase."
https://openalex.org/W1554250461,"Abstract The enzymatic activity underlying the respiratory burst in human neutrophils was examined in a subcellular fraction with high specific activity and shown to be a membrane-associated complex of a flavoprotein, ubiquinone-10, and cytochrome b559 in an approximate 1.3:1:2 molar ratio. Study of the redox poise of these electron carriers indicated that electron flow in the intact complex from unstimulated cells proceeded: NADPH----E-FAD----ubiquinone-10. Similar studies on the complex prepared from stimulated neutrophils indicated that electron flow proceeded: NADPH----E-FAD----ubiquinone-10----cytochrome b559----oxygen. The active enzyme complex was inhibited by p-chloromercuribenzoate. Inhibition persisted after removal of excess inhibitor, was reversed by dithiothreitol, and could be blocked by prior addition of substrate (NADPH). Inhibition of the active oxidase complex by p-chloromercuribenzoate also inhibited electron flow from NADPH to all purported electron carriers in the chain (i.e. E-FAD, ubiquinone-10, and cytochrome b559). We conclude that activation of the oxidase enzyme complex in the intact neutrophil resulted in linkage of electron carrier function between endogenous ubiquinone-10 and cytochrome b559 and was without demonstrable effect on proximal electron flow. The p-chloromercuribenzoate sensitive site(s) proximal to the initial electron acceptor (E-FAD) did not appear to be altered by the cellular activation process."
https://openalex.org/W1597506391,"The existence of a proton pump associated with bovine cytochrome c oxidase (EC 1.9.3.1) has over the last few years been a matter of considerable dispute. In an attempt to resolve some of the problems with the measuring system we have synthesized fluorescein-phosphatidylethanolamine which when reconstituted with cytochrome c oxidase into phospholipid vesicles provided a reliable indicator of the intravesicular pH. It was observed that cytochrome c oxidase catalyzed the abstraction of almost 2 protons from the intravesicular medium/molecule of ferrocytochrome c oxidized. In parallel experiments whereby the extravesicular pH was measured with an electrode it was found that the enzyme appeared to be responsible for the appearance of almost 1.0 proton/molecule of ferrocytochrome c oxidized. Taken together these data unequivocally demonstrate that cytochrome c oxidase behaves as a proton pump. Furthermore, the other proton which was abstracted is believed to be used for the process of the reduction of oxygen. Similar experiments were performed with a cytochrome c oxidase preparation which was devoid of subunit III. Under these circumstances the enzyme appeared to be unable to translocate protons across the vesicular membrane but was competent to abstract protons from the intravesicular medium for the reduction of oxygen."
https://openalex.org/W1589528109,"It has been suggested that calcineurin, a calmodulin-stimulated phosphatase, may exist in different metal ion-dependent conformational states (Pallen, C.J., and Wang, J. H. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 6134-6141). Evidence in favor of this hypothesis comes from studies involving a monoclonal antibody, VA1, which is specific for the small (beta) subunit of calcineurin. This antibody inhibits Ni2+-stimulated but not Mn2+-stimulated phosphatase activity against p-nitrophenyl phosphate and phosphorylase kinase. Inhibition is not due to competition of the antibody with substrate or to interference with metal ion binding to the enzyme. Complex formation between the antibody and calcineurin can be demonstrated either in the presence of Mn2+ or Ni2+ or in the absence of metal ion activators. These results indicate that the active conformational states of calcineurin are metal ion dependent, that the monoclonal antibody VA1 affects the Ni2+-induced conformational change of the enzyme, and that the beta subunit of calcineurin plays a critical role in the expression of Ni2+-stimulated phosphatase activity."

In the studies reported here a combined cloning and expression system was used to identify HTLV-III encoded peptides that react immunologically with antibodies in sera from AIDS patients. Cloned HTLV-III DNA was sheared into approximately 500-base-pair fragments and inserted into an ""open reading frame"" expression vector, pMR100. The inserted DNA was expressed in Escherichia coli transformants as a polypeptide fused to the lambda CI protein at its amino terminus and to beta-galactosidase at its carboxyl terminus. Sera from AIDS patients containing antibodies to HTLV-III were then used to screen for immunoreactive fusion proteins. Twenty clones, each specifying a fusion protein strongly reactive with AIDS serum, were identified. DNA sequence analysis indicated that the HTLV-III fragments were derived from the open reading frame DNA segments corresponding to the gag and pol gene coding regions and also the large open reading frame region (env-lor) located near the 3' end of the viral genome."

https://openalex.org/W1578745080,"The meiotic maturation of Xenopus laevis oocytes is induced in vitro by progesterone which interacts at the cell surface level. A cell-free membrane preparation (P-10,000) incorporated 32P from [gamma-32P]ATP, mostly into two proteins, Mr approximately 56,000 and approximately 48,000 (as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis). Progesterone, added in vitro, specifically inhibited the phosphorylation of the Mr approximately 48,000 protein (named p48). Half-maximal inhibition of p48 phosphorylation occurred with progesterone approximately 8 microM, in good correlation with hormone concentration inducing oocyte maturation. The effect was not due to stimulation of protein phosphatase activity. The potent maturation inducers testosterone and deoxycorticosterone also inhibited p48 phosphorylation, whereas biologically inactive steroids or cholesterol did not. p48 phosphorylation was not affected by cAMP, cGMP, polyamines, calmodulin, and phospholipids + diolein. EGTA had a stimulatory effect which was reversed by added Ca2+. The inhibitory effects of progesterone and Ca2+ were additive, suggesting two distinct sites of action. Phospho-p48 was not detected in yolk platelets, microsomes, and cytosol of oocytes. Contrary to p48 itself, the p48 kinase activity was loosely associated with P-10,000. Progesterone inhibited p48 phosphorylation produced by either cytosol or exogenous pure catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Conversely, phosphorylation of casein and histones by protein kinase activity present in P-10,000 was not modified by progesterone. It is then suggested that progesterone regulates p48 phosphorylation by affecting the protein substrate in the membrane, rather than by inhibiting the protein kinase enzyme itself. The data demonstrate a direct effect (not mediated by change of protein synthesis) of steroids on p48 phosphorylation in the plasma membrane, and they suggest that this protein could be implicated in the initial action of progesterone on oocyte maturation."
https://openalex.org/W1591981527,"A two-stage assay was used to study the effect of organic solvents on the activation of and the catalysis by chloroplast fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. Irrespective of chemical structure, all the organic solvents tested had a dual effect on the enzyme. In the activation they stimulated and inhibited at low and high concentrations, respectively, in a process that required dithiothreitol, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, and Ca2+. Conversely, organic solvents inhibited catalysis. The enhancement in fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase activity did not arise from a change in the molecular weight of the enzyme and correlated positively with the hydrophobic character of the organic solvent. In the presence of 2-propanol, all the activation constants for modulators (fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, a2+, thioredoxin-f) were lower than in a strictly aqueous medium. Monothiols were also functional in the activation of chloroplast fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, although they were less effective than dithiols. Sulfhydryl compounds decreased the concentration of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate required for the activation of the enzyme, and 2-propanol lowered this requirement further. Arrhenius plots were nonlinear for the enzyme activation and linear for the hydrolytic step. The anomalous temperature dependence of the chloroplast fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase activation was indicative of a cooperative process. The data obtained in this study indicate that the concerted activation of chloroplast fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase is favored in a medium less polar than water."

https://openalex.org/W1528227229,"A segment of the coding sequence of the Abelson murine leukemia virus transforming gene (v-abl) has been inserted into a plasmid vector that allows its efficient and regulated expression in Escherichia coli. The product of the v-abl-derived coding sequence, designated p60v-abl, accumulated to a level of approximately 10% of total E. coli protein. A procedure is described for the isolation of p60v-abl from E. coli that yields about 50 micrograms of p60v-abl/g wet weight of E. coli. p60v-abl was capable of autophosphorylation and phosphorylating certain E. coli proteins specifically at tyrosine residues. The E. coli-expressed p60v-abl specifically phosphorylated tyrosine residues on casein and angiotensin II. The Km and Vmax values for ATP, casein, and angiotensin II in the p60v-abl kinase reaction have been determined and compared to values reported for other tyrosine-specific kinases. The expression system and isolation procedure described here permit the preparation of functional p60v-abl in quantities sufficient for detailed physical and biochemical characterization and examination of its biological action(s)."
https://openalex.org/W2115012525,"Treatment of isolated rat adipocytes with adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) caused a 1.5-fold increase in phospholipid methyltransferase activity within 5 min. This effect of ACTH was concentration-dependent with maximal activation at 2 milliunits/ml ACTH, and was reproduced by dibutyryl cyclic AMP. ACTH (2 milliunits/ml) caused an increase in the Vmax value of phospholipid methyltransferase without changing the Km for S-adenosyl-L-methionine. Insulin caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of both control and ACTH-stimulated phospholipid methyltransferase. Half-maximal inhibition by insulin was demonstrated with 5 microunits/ml insulin in control cells and with 25 microunits/ml insulin in ACTH-stimulated cells. The rapid and sensitive activation of adipocyte phospholipid methyltransferase by ACTH and inhibition by insulin are consistent with a role for this pathway in the hormonal response of the adipocyte."
https://openalex.org/W1492269902,We have measured the magnetic circular dichroism of cytochrome c peroxidase and some of its derivatives from 250-350 nm. Comparison of the changes observed on conversion to the catalytic intermediate (cytochrome c peroxidase-I) with spectra obtained from horseradish peroxidase and its derivatives and model compounds of protoheme leads us to the conclusion that the observed changes in the magnetic circular dichroism spectra reflect conversion of the heme to the ferryl state. No evidence was found for modification of tryptophan in cytochrome c peroxidase-I.
https://openalex.org/W1506154031,"IS50R is a transposable genetic element that serves as the right inverted repeat of the transposon Tn5. Earlier work has shown that IS50R encodes at least two proteins (called P1 and P2) involved in transposition. In this paper, we describe the localization properties of the proteins encoded on this repeat. Strains were constructed that overproduced either these two proteins or hybrids between beta-galactosidase and the IS50R proteins. An antiserum was raised against the hybrid proteins, and this was used to study the localization of P1 and P2. Based on studies in maxicells as well as in growing cells, we show that P1 and P2 are localized differently in the cell. P2 is a cytoplasmic protein, while P1 largely fractionates with the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1533763933,"We have studied the effect of sodium n-butyrate on the expression of specific genes. For this purpose, tk-ts13 cells (a thymidine kinase-deficient mutant originating from Syrian hamster cells) were microinjected or transfected with pC2, a plasmid containing the entire SV40 genome and the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene (HSV-TK), cloned in pBR322. As a measure of the expression of these two genes, one of which is spliced (SV40) and the other one (HSV-TK) which is not, we have taken the protein levels (amount of T antigen for SV40 and incorporation of [3H]thymidine for HSV-TK) and the levels of RNA (by dot blot hybridization). The expression of the microinjected genes was inhibited when tk-ts13 cells were exposed to butyrate, actinomycin D, cycloheximide, and mitomycin C, but not when the cells were treated with insulin or dexamethasone. Further studies showed that a decrease in the percentage of T-positive cells occurs at lower concentrations of butyrate than a decrease in the levels of specific mRNA. In tk-ts13 cells transfected with pC2 and treated with butyrate at a concentration of 3 mM, SV40 mRNA levels are not decreased but the percentage of T-positive cells is decreased 50%. At 5 mM, the amount of T antigen/cell is decreased a further 40%. These results indicate that butyrate may have at least two sites of action, one at the level of mRNA amount and a second at the level of protein amount. In addition, our studies show that the use of microinjected or transfected genes offers certain unique possibilities for studies on the effects of environmental manipulations on gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1509800276,"Although the adenylate cyclase of Dictyostelium discoideum cannot be activated by its cAMP agonist in vitro, its in vivo activation can be demonstrated by rapidly breaking and assaying the cells, over 10-fold higher activity being observed for stimulated cells than for basal cells. We report here that when basal cells are broken in the presence of labeled ATP and then rapidly assayed, they display 8-fold more adenylate cyclase activity than cells broken in the presence of unlabeled ATP. This suggests that a significant amount of the enzyme in extracts of basal cells is sequestered within vesicles that can be loaded with substrate at the time of cell lysis, but then rapidly seal. In contrast to the results obtained with basal cells, when cells activated in vivo are broken in the presence of labeled ATP, there is less than 2-fold increase in adenylate cyclase activity. Thus, a much smaller percentage of the observed adenylate cyclase activity of stimulated cells appears to be due to sequestered enzyme than of basal cells. Two models are discussed that account for these observations. One model envisions that roughly equal populations of sequestered and nonsequestered enzyme are produced upon breakage of both basal and activated cells, but that sequestered enzyme in basal extracts becomes uniquely activated in vitro. The other model proposes that the differences in observed activity are due directly to differences in sequestration. According to this latter model, nearly all of the -fold activation previously observed for the D. discoideum adenylate cyclase can be accounted for by a change in sequestration of the enzyme rather than by an intrinsic alteration in the enzyme per se. It therefore suggests a novel mode of regulation whereby an enzyme may be packaged within vesicles and its activity controlled by modulating the permeability of the vesicles to its substrate or effectors."
