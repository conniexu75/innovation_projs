This communication reports the finding that a chemical family hitherto unexplored in this respect, namely, the arylacethydroxamic acids, includes several substances endowed with considerable anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties, and also a remarkably low degree of toxicity. A particularly interesting compound in this series was 4-butoxy-3-methyl-phenylacethydroxamic acid (I). In a comparative investigation with known antiphlogistic compounds, using the Benitz and Hall carrageenin-induced abscess test in rats2, compound (I), in exactly the same dose, proved only slightly less active (c. half) than phenylbutazone (l,2-diphenyl-3,5-diketo-4-butylpyrazolidine), definitely more active than ‘Ibufenac’ (p-isobutylphenylacetic acid), and considerably more so than aspirin. The activity shown by compound (I) at the high dosage of 1 g/kg was as intense as that of the maximum tolerated dose of phenylbutazone (400 mg/kg) and considerably more so than that (10 mg/kg) of ‘Indomethacin’ (1-p-chlorobenzoyl-5-methoxyindolyl-3-acetic acid), which is the most efficient non-steroid antiphlogistic substance known so far. Compound (I) was also strongly active in the carrageenin-induced granuloma test in rats, whereas phenylbutazone and aspirin are known to behave poorly in this type of assay3."

https://openalex.org/W2050862952,"PERCEPTUAL fusion of intermittent random noise stimuli at critical frequencies in man was first reported by Miller1 and Miller and Taylor2, and confirmed by Symmes, Chapman and Halstead3. The process is analogous to visual flicker fusion. The critical interruption rate at which fusion occurs is termed the “auditory flutter fusion threshold”."

https://openalex.org/W2094368187,"Young and George1 report that, in their immunoassay system utilizing resin separation, the addition of human growth hormone (HGH) to fasting human serum causes a decrease in ‘percentage antibody-bound’ of iodine-131 labelled insulin, and they infer that HGH releases free insulin from a serum protein-bound form. We have been unable to confirm this phenomenon in a double-antibody immunoassay system2,3."

https://openalex.org/W2033938201,"THE procedure described by Hunter and Greenwood1 with some minor modifications has been used in this laboratory for small-scale preparation of iodine-131-labelled insulin. About 1.2 mc. iodine-131 from Kjeller is used in a volume of less than 0.025 ml. for the labelling of 5 µg of purified insulin. The iodination efficiency is usually in the region of 60–80 per cent, giving a specific activity of about 150 µc. iodine-131 per µg insulin."
https://openalex.org/W2041660046,"MACKWOETH1 has presented evidence suggesting that if lists of, for example, letters or digits are presented audi-torially for immediate recall, fast presentation is more advantageous than slow. The converse has generally been found true for visual presentation2–4. It has been hypothesized by Mackworth that subjects might use a short-lasting auditory memory after-image for recall purposes, this image probably persisting for longer than the visual memory after-image. It might then be that fast presentation-rates of auditory material facilitate recall because more of the list is still available in image-form after a fast presentation than after a slow presentation."

https://openalex.org/W2013857350,"Rubus geoides from the southern hemisphere is a creeping form of bramble with simple, glossy leaves and hermaphrodite flowers. It occurs in Patagonia and in the Falkland Islands, where it is harvested locally for the red raspberry-like fruits. This species can be considered to be the southern equivalent of the northern hemisphere circumpolar species of creeping diploid Rubus arcticus. R. geoides was considered of possible interest for raspberry and blackberry breeding in Scotland because of its hardiness, lack of thorns, and its ability to produce fruits under windy and extreme climatic conditions. Plants raised from seeds received from Patagonia have grown well both indoors and outdoors in the east of Scotland, although its leaves are subject to mildew when kept in a poorly ventilated glasshouse and its flowering has been sparse."

The reduction in the maximum oxygen intake at the 7,500 ft. altitude of Mexico City, where the 1968 Olympic Games are to be held, is expected to be 8 per cent following the trend of experiments made in the Himalayas1. From this result it has been predicted that the times for the running events at Mexico City would be 8 per cent longer than the expected sea-level times2 except for the shorter events where the oxygen requirement could be covered anaerobically."
