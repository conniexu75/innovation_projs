https://openalex.org/W2028664820,"Here we describe an ultra-low-cost origami-based approach for large-scale manufacturing of microscopes, specifically demonstrating brightfield, darkfield, and fluorescence microscopes. Merging principles of optical design with origami enables high-volume fabrication of microscopes from 2D media. Flexure mechanisms created via folding enable a flat compact design. Structural loops in folded paper provide kinematic constraints as a means for passive self-alignment. This light, rugged instrument can survive harsh field conditions while providing a diversity of imaging capabilities, thus serving wide-ranging applications for cost-effective, portable microscopes in science and education."
https://openalex.org/W2091613095,"An increasing population of dementia patients produces substantial societal impacts. We assessed the prevalence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and all-cause dementia, including very mild dementia (VMD), in Taiwan. In a nationwide population-based cross-sectional survey, participants were selected by computerized random sampling from all 19 Taiwan counties and were enrolled between December 2011 and March 2013. Cases were identified through in-person interviews based on the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association clinical criteria. Demographic data and histories involving mental status and function in daily living were collected. The principal objective assessments were the Taiwanese Mental Status Examination and Clinical Dementia Rating. In all, 10,432 people aged 65 years or older (mean age 76.2 ± 6.7, 52.3% women) were interviewed. The age-adjusted prevalence of all-cause dementia was 8.04% (95% CI 7.47-8.61), including a 3.25% (95% CI 2.89-3.61) prevalence of VMD; that of MCI was 18.76% (95% CI 17.91-19.61). Women had a higher prevalence than men of both all-cause dementia (9.71% vs. 6.36%) and MCI (21.63% vs. 15.57%). MCI affects a considerable portion of the population aged 65 and above in Taiwan. The inclusion of VMD yields dementia prevalence rates higher than those previously reported from Taiwan. Old age, female gender, and a low educational level are significant associated factors."
https://openalex.org/W2087728211,"Charitable giving in 2013 exceeded $300 billion, but why do we respond to some life-saving causes while ignoring others? In our first two studies, we demonstrated that valuation of lives is associated with affective feelings (self-reported and psychophysiological) and that a decline in compassion may begin with the second endangered life. In Study 3, this fading of compassion was reversed by describing multiple lives in a more unitary fashion. Study 4 extended our findings to loss-frame scenarios. Our capacity to feel sympathy for people in need appears limited, and this form of compassion fatigue can lead to apathy and inaction, consistent with what is seen repeatedly in response to many large-scale human and environmental catastrophes."
https://openalex.org/W2003301452,"The induction of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β is associated with the progression of human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1) disease or AIDS. Unlike most inflammatory cytokines that are regulated by NF-κB at the transcriptional level, production of mature IL-1β also depends on inflammasome activation. The mechanism by which HIV-1 induces pro-IL-1β expression and activates inflammasomes to cleave pro-IL-1β into its bioactive form is not clearly defined. We report here that HIV-1 infection in human monocytes efficiently induced IL-1β expression and inflammasome activation. Toll-like receptor 8 (TLR8) was required for inducing pro-IL-1β expression, whereas the NLRP3 inflammasome was required for IL-1β maturation and release. Furthermore, the lysosomal protease cathepsin B and HIV-1 induced production of reactive oxygen species were critical for HIV-induced inflammasome activation and IL-1β production. HIV-1 entry, reverse transcription, and integration were all required for both pro-IL-1β expression and inflammasome activation. Finally, we show that HIV-1-derived RNA was sufficient to induce both pro-IL-1β expression and inflammasome activation. We conclude that HIV-1 infection induced the expression of pro-IL-1β via TLR8-mediated mechanisms and activated caspase-1 through the NLRP3 inflammasome to cleave pro-IL-1β into bioactive IL-1β. These findings help to elucidate mechanisms of HIV-1 disease progression and identify novel targets for treating HIV-1 induced inflammation and immune activation."
https://openalex.org/W2149433660,"Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is the causative agent of adult T-cell leukemia and HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis. The HTLV-1 transactivator protein Tax controls many critical cellular pathways, including host cell DNA damage response mechanisms, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis. Extracellular vesicles called exosomes play critical roles during pathogenic viral infections as delivery vehicles for host and viral components, including proteins, mRNA, and microRNA. We hypothesized that exosomes derived from HTLV-1-infected cells contain unique host and viral proteins that may contribute to HTLV-1-induced pathogenesis. We found exosomes derived from infected cells to contain Tax protein and proinflammatory mediators as well as viral mRNA transcripts, including Tax, HBZ, and Env. Furthermore, we observed that exosomes released from HTLV-1-infected Tax-expressing cells contributed to enhanced survival of exosome-recipient cells when treated with Fas antibody. This survival was cFLIP-dependent, with Tax showing induction of NF-κB in exosome-recipient cells. Finally, IL-2-dependent CTLL-2 cells that received Tax-containing exosomes were protected from apoptosis through activation of AKT. Similar experiments with primary cultures showed protection and survival of peripheral blood mononuclear cells even in the absence of phytohemagglutinin/IL-2. Surviving cells contained more phosphorylated Rb, consistent with the role of Tax in regulation of the cell cycle. Collectively, these results suggest that exosomes may play an important role in extracellular delivery of functional HTLV-1 proteins and mRNA to recipient cells.

First described in 1983 by Harding et al. (45.Harding C. Heuser J. Stahl P. Receptor-mediated endocytosis of transferrin and recycling of the transferrin receptor in rat reticulocytes.J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 329-339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), exosomes are nanovesicles between 30 and 120 nm in diameter and shed by a variety of different cell types, including those of hematological origin, such as B-cells, T-cells, dendritic cells, and non-hematological origin, such as epithelial cells, neuronal cells, and tumor-derived cells. Exosomes have been isolated from more complex physiological fluids, including saliva, urine, blood, and breast milk, where much effort has been dedicated to investigating the diagnostic potential of these vesicles as biomarkers (33.Ohno S.

Human saliva, plasma and breast milk exosomes contain RNA: uptake by macrophages.J. Transl. Med. 2011; 9: 9Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Importantly, heterogeneous populations of exosomes have been identified in various biofluid samples including seminal fluid and urine, potentially as a result of exosome production by various cell types. Depending upon the source, the exosome populations have been shown to range in size as well as protein content (38.Dear J.W. Street J.M. Bailey M.A. Urinary exosomes: a reservoir for biomarker discovery and potential mediators of intrarenal signalling.Proteomics. 2013; 13: 1572-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 39.Poliakov A.

Structural heterogeneity and protein composition of exosome-like vesicles (prostasomes) in human semen.Prostate. 2009; 69: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Heterogeneous populations of exosomes have also been identified from cancerous cell types, including colon cancer (40.Tauro B.J. Greening D.W. Mathias R.A. Mathivanan S. Ji H. Simpson R.J. Two distinct populations of exosomes are released from LIM1863 colon carcinoma cell-derived organoids.Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2013; 12: 587-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Exosome formation occurs via inward budding of endosomal membranes, which causes the accumulation of intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) within multivesicular bodies. These multivesicular bodies shuttle cargo either to lysosomes or to the plasma membrane, where the contents are exocytosed (41.Mathivanan S. Ji H. Simpson R.J. Exosomes: extracellular organelles important in intercellular communication.J. Proteomics. 2010; 73: 1907-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (1393) Google Scholar). In contrast, cells release other types of membrane vesicles, including apoptotic blebs and microparticles, which bud directly from the plasma membrane and represent a heterogeneous mixture of vesicles ranging in size from 100 to 1000 nm (42.Simpson R.J. Jensen S.S. Lim J.W. Proteomic profiling of exosomes: current perspectives.Proteomics. 2008; 8: 4083-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). In addition to the difference in size between exosomes and apoptotic blebs, several additional factors exist when distinguishing exosomes from apoptotic blebs. These include morphological traits of apoptotic blebs, which are denser, floating at a higher density on sucrose gradients, and do not appear cup-shaped under transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Furthermore, the apoptotic vesicles include very high levels of histones compared with levels seen in exosomes (43.Thery C. Amigorena S. Raposo G. Clayton A. Isolation and characterization of exosomes from cell culture supernatants and biological fluids.Curr. Protoc. Cell Biol. 2006; (Chapter 3, Unit 3.22)Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because exosomes are generated through invagination of late endosomes, these vesicles incorporate a variety of host components, including Alix and TSG101, as well as proteins involved in membrane trafficking (Rabs and annexins), tetraspanins (CD63, CD81, and CD9), heat-shock proteins (HSP60, HSP70, and HSP90), and cytoskeletal components (actin); all of these proteins have been considered as consensus markers for exosomes (25.Pant S. Hilton H. Burczynski M.E. The multifaceted exosome: biogenesis, role in normal and aberrant cellular function, and frontiers for pharmacological and biomarker opportunities.Biochem. Pharmacol. 2012; 83: 1484-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 42.Simpson R.J. Jensen S.S. Lim J.W. Proteomic profiling of exosomes: current perspectives.Proteomics. 2008; 8: 4083-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Morphologically, exosomes have been shown to appear cup-shaped when visualized using TEM analysis (44.György B. Szabó T.G. Pásztói M. Pál Z. Misják P. Aradi B. László V. Pállinger E. Pap E. Kittel A. Nagy G. Falus A. Buzás E.I. Membrane vesicles, current state-of-the-art: emerging role of extracellular vesicles.Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2011; 68: 2667-2688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar). Currently, it is accepted that recipient cell uptake of exosomes is dependent, in part, upon ligand-receptor recognition, followed either by direct fusion of exosome and recipient cell plasma membranes or by endocytic processes involving dynamin2 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) (45.Harding C. Heuser J. Stahl P. Receptor-mediated endocytosis of transferrin and recycling of the transferrin receptor in rat reticulocytes.J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 329-339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 46.Wurdinger T. Gatson N.N. Balaj L. Kaur B. Breakefield X.O. Pegtel D.M. Extracellular vesicles and their convergence with viral pathways.Adv. Virol. 2012; 2012: 767694Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). It has also been demonstrated that exosomes secreted from uninfected cells contain nucleic acids, including cellular mRNA and miRNA as well as functional proteins. However, infection can alter the levels and profiles of these cargo molecules contained in exosomes (47.Vlassov A.V. Magdaleno S. Setterquist R. Conrad R. Exosomes: current knowledge of their composition, biological functions, and diagnostic and therapeutic potentials.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1820: 940-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar). With regard to viral infection, exosomes aid in the transfer of hepatitis C virus viral RNA from infected to uninfected plasmacytoid dendritic cells, inducing the production of type I IFN (48.Dreux M. Garaigorta U. Boyd B. Décembre E. Chung J. Whitten-Bauer C. Wieland S. Chisari F.V. Short-range exosomal transfer of viral RNA from infected cells to plasmacytoid dendritic cells triggers innate immunity.Cell Host Microbe. 2012; 12: 558-570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Furthermore, HIV-1 Gag and p17 are incorporated into exosomes released from these infected cells (49.Columba Cabezas S. Federico M. Sequences within RNA coding for HIV-1 Gag p17 are efficiently targeted to exosomes.Cell Microbiol. 2013; 15: 412-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Regarding exosome-mediated transfer of miRNA, exosomes have been shown to deliver functional miRNA from infected donor cells to uninfected recipient cells during infection by the oncogenic Epstein-Barr virus (32.Pegtel D.M. Cosmopoulos K. Thorley-Lawson D.A. van Eijndhoven M.A. Hopmans E.S. Lindenberg J.L. de Gruijl T.D. Würdinger T. Middeldorp J.M. Functional delivery of viral miRNAs via exosomes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 6328-6333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). Exosome-mediated transfer of miRNAs has been implicated in HIV-associated neuronal disorders (50.Hu G. Yao H. Chaudhuri A.D. Duan M. Yelamanchili S.V. Wen H. Cheney P.D. Fox H.S. Buch S. Exosome-mediated shuttling of microRNA-29 regulates HIV Tat and morphine-mediated neuronal dysfunction.Cell Death Dis. 2012; 3: e381Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and delivery of functional proteins to recipient cells has been shown in HIV-1-infected macrophages. Release of HIV-1 Nef within exosomes, onto B cells, may aid in viral immune evasion (51.Xu W. Santini P.A. Sullivan J.S. He B. Shan M. Ball S.C. Dyer W.B. Ketas T.J. Chadburn A. Cohen-Gould L.

To date, there are no studies describing a role of exosomes in HTLV-1 infection. It has been shown that soluble Tax can be taken up by recipient cells, whereas soluble Tax treatment of uninfected cells induces TNF-α gene expression and enhances the proliferation of phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes (18.Kinjo T.

We reasoned that in order to be functional in circulation in bodily fluids, a more stable form of Tax may be present outside of a cell. Along these lines, we aimed to investigate whether Tax could exist in an extracellular vesicle, such as an exosome, secreted from HTLV-1-infected cells and thus contribute to viral pathogenesis. We hypothesized that HTLV-1-infected T-cells produce exosomes, and these vesicles may contain unique molecules, including host and viral proteins. Herein we describe the characterization of exosomes secreted from uninfected and HTLV-1-infected T-cells. These exosomes displayed similar characteristics to the standard exosomes, demonstrating typical phenotypic and morphologic features. We also examined the proteomic profile of the exosomes and determined that exosomes from the HTLV-1-infected cells contain proinflammatory mediators as well as Tax protein. The HTLV-1 mRNA transcripts for env, tax, and hbz were also present within them. When we evaluated the functional significance of treating naive recipient T-cells with exosomes secreted from HTLV-1 infected cells, we determined that the exosomes were capable of inducing transcription in the recipient cells, which may contribute to an enhanced survival under stress conditions. Therefore, our data implicate a role for Tax-containing exosomes in the protection of recipient cells from apoptosis. Collectively, our results implicate exosomes as an important means of extracellular delivery of functional HTLV-1 proteins to uninfected recipient cells.

DR is a silent disease that may go unnoticed until it is too late for effective treatment. Therefore, early detection could improve the chances of therapeutic interventions that would alleviate its effects.Graded fundus photography and systemic data from 3443 ACCORD-Eye Study participants were used to estimate Random Forest (RF) and logistic regression classifiers. We studied the impact of sample size on classifier performance and the possibility of using RF generated class conditional probabilities as metrics describing DR risk. RF measures of variable importance are used to detect factors that affect classification performance.Both types of data were informative when discriminating participants with or without DR. RF based models produced much higher classification accuracy than those based on logistic regression. Combining both types of data did not increase accuracy but did increase statistical discrimination of healthy participants who subsequently did or did not have DR events during four years of follow-up. RF variable importance criteria revealed that microaneurysms counts in both eyes seemed to play the most important role in discrimination among the graded fundus variables, while the number of medicines and diabetes duration were the most relevant among the systemic variables.We have introduced RF methods to DR classification analyses based on fundus photography data. In addition, we propose an approach to DR risk assessment based on metrics derived from graded fundus photography and systemic data. Our results suggest that RF methods could be a valuable tool to diagnose DR diagnosis and evaluate its progression."

https://openalex.org/W2002230639,"Death receptor 5 (DR5) is a death domain-containing transmembrane receptor that triggers cell death upon binding to its ligand, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), and a combination of TRAIL and agents that increase the expression of DR5 is expected to be a novel anticancer therapy. In this report, we demonstrate that the stress response gene ATF3 is required for endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated DR5 induction upon zerumbone (ZER) and celecoxib (CCB) in human p53-deficient colorectal cancer cells. Both agents activated PERK-eIF2α kinases and induced the expression of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4)-CCAAT enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) homologous protein, which were remarkably suppressed by reactive oxygen species scavengers. In the absence of ATF3, the induction of DR5 mRNA and protein was abrogated significantly, and this was associated with reduced cell death by cotreatment of TRAIL with ZER or CCB. By contrast, exogenous expression of ATF3 caused a more rapid and elevated expression of DR5, resulting in enhanced sensitivity to apoptotic cell death by TRAIL/ZER or TRAIL/CCB. A reporter assay demonstrated that at least two ATF/cAMP response element motifs as well as C/EBP homologous protein motif at the proximal region of the human DR5 gene promoter were required for ZER-induced DR5 gene transcription. Taken together, our results provide novel insights into the role of ATF3 as an essential transcription factor for p53-independent DR5 induction upon both ZER and CCB treatment, and this may be a useful biomarker for TRAIL-based anticancer therapy."

Therefore, effective inhibition of this pathway could provide a novel method to treat HCC. The purposed of this study was to determine whether FH535, which was previously shown to block the β-catenin pathway, could inhibit β-catenin activation of target genes and inhibit proliferation of Liver Cancer Stem Cells (LCSC) and HCC cell lines. Using β-catenin responsive reporter genes, our data indicates that FH535 can inhibit target gene activation by endogenous and exogenously expressed β-catenin, including the constitutively active form of β-catenin that contains a Serine37Alanine mutation. Our data also indicate that proliferation of LCSC and HCC lines is inhibited by FH535 in a dose-dependent manner, and that this correlates with a decrease in the percentage of cells in S phase. Finally, we also show that expression of two well-characterized targets of β-catenin, Cyclin D1 and Survivin, is reduced by FH535. Taken together, this data indicates that FH535 has potential therapeutic value in treatment of liver cancer. Importantly, these results suggest that this therapy may be effective at several levels by targeting both HCC and LCSC."
https://openalex.org/W1990024460,"Fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4) is an adipogenic protein and is implicated in atherosclerosis, insulin resistance, and cancer. In endothelial cells, FABP4 is induced by VEGFA, and inhibition of FABP4 blocks most of the VEGFA effects. We investigated the DLL4-NOTCH-dependent regulation of FABP4 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells by gene/protein expression and interaction analyses following inhibitor treatment and RNA interference. We found that FABP4 is directly induced by NOTCH. Stimulation of NOTCH signaling with human recombinant DLL4 led to FABP4 induction, independently of VEGFA. FABP4 induction by VEGFA was reduced by blockade of DLL4 binding to NOTCH or inhibition of NOTCH signal transduction. Chromatin immunoprecipitation of the NOTCH intracellular domain showed increased binding to two specific regions in the FABP4 promoter. The induction of FABP4 gene expression was dependent on the transcription factor FOXO1, which was essential for basal expression of FABP4, and FABP4 up-regulation following stimulation of the VEGFA and/or the NOTCH pathway. Thus, we show that the DLL4-NOTCH pathway mediates endothelial FABP4 expression. This indicates that induction of the angiogenesis-restricting DLL4-NOTCH can have pro-angiogenic effects via this pathway. It also provides a link between DLL4-NOTCH and FOXO1-mediated regulation of endothelial gene transcription, and it shows that DLL4-NOTCH is a nodal point in the integration of pro-angiogenic and metabolic signaling in endothelial cells. This may be crucial for angiogenesis in the tumor environment."
https://openalex.org/W2084766332,"Using gene expression data to enhance our knowledge of control networks relevant to cancer biology and therapy is a challenging but urgent task. Based on the premise that genes that are expressed together in a variety of cell types are likely to functions together, we derived mutually correlated genes that function together in various processes in epithelial-like tumor cells. Expression-correlated genes were derived from data for the NCI-60 human tumor cell lines, as well as data from the Broad Institute’s CCLE cell lines. NCI-60 cell lines that selectively expressed a mutually correlated subset of tight junction genes served as a signature for epithelial-like cancer cells. Those signature cell lines served as a seed to derive other correlated genes, many of which had various other epithelial-related functions. Literature survey yielded molecular interaction and function information about those genes, from which molecular interaction maps were assembled. Many of the genes had epithelial functions unrelated to tight junctions, demonstrating that new function categories were elicited. The most highly correlated genes were implicated in the following epithelial functions: interactions at tight junctions (CLDN7, CLDN4, CLDN3, MARVELD3, MARVELD2, TJP3, CGN, CRB3, LLGL2, EPCAM, LNX1); interactions at adherens junctions (CDH1, ADAP1, CAMSAP3); interactions at desmosomes (PPL, PKP3, JUP); transcription regulation of cell-cell junction complexes (GRHL1 and 2); epithelial RNA splicing regulators (ESRP1 and 2); epithelial vesicle traffic (RAB25, EPN3, GRHL2, EHF, ADAP1, MYO5B); epithelial Ca(+2) signaling (ATP2C2, S100A14, BSPRY); terminal differentiation of epithelial cells (OVOL1 and 2, ST14, PRSS8, SPINT1 and 2); maintenance of apico-basal polarity (RAB25, LLGL2, EPN3).

However, they require extensive in vitro cell-conditioning in bioreactor before implantation. Here, the propensity of non-preconditioned decellularized heart valves to spontaneous in body self-regeneration was investigated in a large animal model. Decellularized porcine aortic valves were evaluated for right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) reconstruction in Vietnamese Pigs (n = 11) with 6 (n = 5) and 15 (n = 6) follow-up months. Repositioned native valves (n = 2 for each time) were considered as control. Tissue and cell components from explanted valves were investigated by histology, immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, and gene expression. Most substitutes constantly demonstrated in vivo adequate hemodynamic performances and ex vivo progressive repopulation during the 15 implantation months without signs of calcifications, fibrosis and/or thrombosis, as revealed by histological, immunohistochemical, ultrastructural, metabolic and transcriptomic profiles. Colonizing cells displayed native-like phenotypes and actively synthesized novel extracellular matrix elements, as collagen and elastin fibers. New mature blood vessels, i.e. capillaries and vasa vasorum, were identified in repopulated valves especially in the medial and adventitial tunicae of regenerated arterial walls. Such findings correlated to the up-regulated vascular gene transcription. Neoinnervation hallmarks were appreciated at histological and ultrastructural levels. Macrophage populations with reparative M2 phenotype were highly represented in repopulated valves. Indeed, no aspects of adverse/immune reaction were revealed in immunohistochemical and transcriptomic patterns. Among differentiated elements, several cells were identified expressing typical stem cell markers of embryonic, hematopoietic, neural and mesenchymal lineages in significantly higher number and specific topographic distribution in respect to control valves. Following the longest follow-up ever realized in preclinical models, non-preconditioned decellularized allogeneic valves offer suitable microenvironment for in vivo cell homing and tissue remodeling. Manufactured with simple, timesaving and cost-effective procedures, these promising valve replacements hold promise to become an effective alternative, especially for pediatric patients."

This spatio-temporal expression of OsDREB1b is preceded by the change in chromatin structure at the promoter and the upstream region for gene activation. The promoter and the upstream region of OsDREB1b genes appear to be arranged into a nucleosome array. Nucleosome mapping of ∼ 700 bp upstream region of OsDREB1b shows two positioned nucleosomes between -610 to -258 and a weakly positioned nucleosome at the core promoter and the TSS. Upon cold stress, there is a significant change in the nucleosome arrangement at the upstream region with increase in DNaseI hypersensitivity or MNase digestion in the vicinity of cis elements and TATA box at the core promoter. ChIP assays shows hyper-acetylation of histone H3K9 throughout the locus whereas region specific increase was observed in H3K14ac and H3K27ac. Moreover, there is an enrichment of RNA PolII occupancy at the promoter region during transcription activation. There is no significant change in the H3 occupancy in OsDREB1b locus negating the possibility of nucleosome loss during cold stress. Interestingly, cold induced enhanced transcript level of OsDREB1b as well as histone H3 acetylation at the upstream region was found to diminish when stressed plants were returned to normal temperature. The result indicates absolute necessity of changes in chromatin conformation for the transcription up-regulation of OsDREB1b gene in response to cold stress. The combined results show the existence of closed chromatin conformation at the upstream and promoter region of OsDREB1b in the transcription ""off"" state. During cold stress, changes in region specific histone modification marks promote the alteration of chromatin structure to facilitate the binding of transcription machinery for proper gene expression."

The aim of the present study was to find miRNA expression profiles in whole blood that were prognostic for overall survival (OS) in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) treated with cetuximab and irinotecan. Methods From 138 patients with mCRC in 3rd line therapy with cetuximab and irinotecan in a prospective phase II study, 738 pretreatment miRNAs were isolated and profiled from whole blood using the TaqMan MicroRNA Array v2.0. Mutation status of KRAS, BRAF, and PI3KCA was known. Results After Bonferroni adjustment, 6 miRNAs: (miR-345, miR-143, miR-34a*, miR-628-5p, miR-886-3p and miR-324-3p), were found associated with short OS. miR-345 was the strongest prognostic miRNA, significant in the full cohort and in the non-KRAS mutant population. miR-345, as a continuous variable in the full cohort, resulted in a hazard ratio (HR) of 2.38 per IQR (CI 95%: 1.8–3.1, P-value = 2.86e−07, Bonferroni adjusted, univariable analysis) and a HR = 1.75 per IQR (CI 95%: 1.24–2.48, P-Wald = 1.45e-03) in the multivariable analysis adjusted for gender, age, KRAS, PI3KCA and performance status. miR-345 was prognostic in progression-free survival (PFS) with a HR = 1.63 per IQR (CI 95%: 1.25–2.114, P-Wald = 2.92e-4) in the multivariable analysis. In addition, high miR-345 expression was associated with lack of response to treatment with cetuximab and irinotecan. Conclusion We identified miR-345 in whole blood as a potential biomarker for clinical outcome. MiR-345 was a single prognostic biomarker for both OS and PFS in all patients and also in the non-KRAS mutant population."

Serial dilutions of a broth culture of Staphylococcus aureus, as a representative nosocomial pathogen, were then used to determine if a given meter's ATP readings correlated with the actual CFUs. Next, various types of disinfectant chemistries were tested for their potential to interfere with the standard ATP readings.All four ATP meters tested herein demonstrated acceptable linearity and repeatability in their readings. However, there were significant differences in their sensitivity to detect the levels of viable microorganisms on experimentally contaminated surfaces. Further, most disinfectant chemistries tested here quenched the ATP readings variably in different ATP meters evaluated.Apart from their limited sensitivity in detecting low levels of microbial contamination, the ATP meters tested were also prone to interference by different disinfectant chemistries."
https://openalex.org/W2064948153,"The Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis encodes three diadenylate cyclases that synthesize the essential signaling nucleotide cyclic di-AMP. The activities of the vegetative enzymes DisA and CdaA are controlled by protein-protein interactions with their conserved partner proteins. Here, we have analyzed the regulation of the unique sporulation-specific diadenylate cyclase CdaS. Very low expression of CdaS as the single diadenylate cyclase resulted in the appearance of spontaneous suppressor mutations. Several of these mutations in the cdaS gene affected the N-terminal domain of CdaS. The corresponding CdaS mutant proteins exhibited a significantly increased enzymatic activity. The N-terminal domain of CdaS consists of two α-helices and is attached to the C-terminal catalytically active diadenylate cyclase (DAC) domain. Deletion of the first or both helices resulted also in strongly increased activity indicating that the N-terminal domain serves to limit the enzyme activity of the DAC domain. The structure of YojJ, a protein highly similar to CdaS, indicates that the protein forms hexamers that are incompatible with enzymatic activity of the DAC domains. In contrast, the mutations and the deletions of the N-terminal domain result in conformational changes that lead to highly increased enzymatic activity. Although the full-length CdaS protein was found to form hexamers, a truncated version with a deletion of the first N-terminal helix formed dimers with high enzyme activity. To assess the role of CdaS in sporulation, we assayed the germination of wild type and cdaS mutant spores. The results indicate that cyclic di-AMP formed by CdaS is required for efficient germination."

Intra-familial transmission of hepatitis B virus (HBV) could be the reason for the familial clustering of HBsAg carriers. Additionally, genetic and gender factors have been reported to be involved. We conducted a three-stage genome-wide association study to identify genetic factors associated with chronic HBV susceptibility. A total of 1,065 male controls and 1,623 male HBsAg carriers were included. The whole-genome genotyping was done on Illumina HumanHap550 beadchips in 304 healthy controls and HumanHap610 beadchips in 321 cases. We found that rs9277535 (HLA-DPB1, P = 4.87×10−14), rs9276370 (HLA-DQA2, P = 1.9×10−12), rs7756516 and rs7453920 (HLA-DQB2, P = 1.48×10−11 and P = 6.66×10−15 respectively) were significantly associated with persistent HBV infection. A novel SNP rs9366816 near HLA-DPA3 also showed significant association (P = 2.58×10−10). The “T-T-G-G-T” haplotype of the five SNPs further signified their association with the disease (P = 1.48×10−12; OR = 1.49). The “T-T” haplotype composed of rs7756516 and rs9276370 was more prevalent in severe disease subgroups and associated with non-sustained therapeutic response (P = 0.0262). The “G-C” haplotype was associated with sustained therapeutic response (P = 0.0132; OR = 2.49). We confirmed that HLA-DPB1, HLA-DQA2 and HLA-DQB2 loci were associated with persistent HBV infection in male Taiwan Han-Chinese.

https://openalex.org/W2031864896,"The p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75(NTR)) mediates the death of specific populations of neurons during the development of the nervous system or after cellular injury. The receptor has also been implicated as a contributor to neurodegeneration caused by numerous pathological conditions. Because many of these conditions are associated with increases in reactive oxygen species, we investigated whether p75(NTR) has a role in neurodegeneration in response to oxidative stress. Here we demonstrate that p75(NTR) signaling is activated by 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE), a lipid peroxidation product generated naturally during oxidative stress. Exposure of sympathetic neurons to HNE resulted in neurite degeneration and apoptosis. However, these effects were reduced markedly in neurons from p75(NTR-/-) mice. The neurodegenerative effects of HNE were not associated with production of neurotrophins and were unaffected by pretreatment with a receptor-blocking antibody, suggesting that oxidative stress activates p75(NTR) via a ligand-independent mechanism. Previous studies have established that proteolysis of p75(NTR) by the metalloprotease TNFα-converting enzyme and γ-secretase is necessary for p75(NTR)-mediated apoptotic signaling. Exposure of sympathetic neurons to HNE resulted in metalloprotease- and γ-secretase-dependent cleavage of p75(NTR). Pharmacological blockade of p75(NTR) proteolysis protected sympathetic neurons from HNE-induced neurite degeneration and apoptosis, suggesting that cleavage of p75(NTR) is necessary for oxidant-induced neurodegeneration. In vivo, p75(NTR-/-) mice exhibited resistance to axonal degeneration associated with oxidative injury following administration of the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine. Together, these data suggest a novel mechanism linking oxidative stress to ligand-independent cleavage of p75(NTR), resulting in axonal fragmentation and neuronal death."
https://openalex.org/W2002699036,"Transcription elongation has been recognized as a rate-limiting step for the expression of signal-inducible genes. Through recruitment of positive transcription elongation factor P-TEFb, the bromodomain-containing protein BRD4 plays critical roles in regulating the transcription elongation of a vast array of inducible genes that are important for multiple cellular processes. The diverse biological roles of BRD4 have been proposed to rely on its functional transition between chromatin targeting and transcription regulation. The signaling pathways and the molecular mechanism for regulating this transition process, however, are largely unknown. Here, we report a novel role of phosphorylated Ser(10) of histone H3 (H3S10ph) in governing the functional transition of BRD4. We identified that the acetylated lysines 5 and 8 of nucleosomal histone H4 (H4K5ac/K8ac) is the BRD4 binding site, and the protein phosphatase PP1α and class I histone deacetylase (HDAC1/2/3) signaling pathways are essential for the stress-induced BRD4 release from chromatin. In the unstressed state, phosphorylated H3S10 prevents the deacetylation of nucleosomal H4K5ac/K8ac by HDAC1/2/3, thereby locking up the majority of BRD4 onto chromatin. Upon stress, PP1α-mediated dephosphorylation of H3S10ph allows the deacetylation of nucleosomal H4K5ac/K8ac by HDAC1/2/3, thereby leading to the release of chromatin-bound BRD4 for subsequent recruitment of P-TEFb to enhance the expression of inducible genes. Therefore, our study revealed a novel mechanism that the histone cross-talk between H3S10ph and H4K5ac/K8ac connects PP1α and HDACs to govern the functional transition of BRD4. Combined with previous studies on the regulation of P-TEFb activation, the intricate signaling network for the tight control of transcription elongation is established."
https://openalex.org/W1977066489,"Toxoplasma gondii is a common protozoan parasite that infects warm-blooded animals throughout the world, including mice and humans. During infection, both, the parasite and the host, utilize various mechanisms to maximize their own reproductive success. Mice and humans are both the intermediate hosts for Toxoplasma gondii, which forms specialized vacuoles containing reproductive cysts in the formers' tissue. As half of the human population is infected, developing a disease called toxoplasmosis, along with an ever-growing number of couples suffering with idiopathic infertility, it is therefore surprising that there is a lack of research on how Toxoplasma gondii can alter reproductive parameters. In this study, a detailed histometric screening of the testicular function along with the levels of the pituitary luteinizing hormone (LH) were analysed in infected mice. Data on relative testis and epididymis weight, and sperm count were also collected. Based on the results obtained, the level of LH in the urine of Toxoplasma gondii infected mice was lower compared to the control. In direct correlation with the hormone level, testicular function and sperm production was also significantly lower in Toxoplasma gondii positive group using sperm count and histometric analysis as a marker. Not only were the number of leptotene primary spermatocytes and spermatids lowered, but the number of Sertoli cells and the tubule diameter were elevated. In parallel, a pilot epigenetic study on global testicular methylation, and specific methylation of Crem, Creb1 and Hspa1genes essential for successfully ongoing spermatogenesis was performed. Global methylation was elevated in Toxoplasma infected mice, and differences in the DNA methylation of selected genes were detected between the Toxoplasma positive and control group. These findings demonstrate a direct relation between Toxoplasma gondii infection and the decrease of male reproductive fitness in mice, which may contribute to an increase of idiopathic infertility in humans."
https://openalex.org/W1975921824,"A new nematode species, Bursaphelenchus sycophilus n. sp. is described. The species was found in syconia of a fig species, Ficus variegata during a field survey of fig-associated nematodes in Japan. Because it has a well-developed stylet and pharyngeal glands, the species is considered an obligate plant parasite, and is easily distinguished from all other fungal-feeding species in the genus based upon these characters. Although B. sycophilus n. sp. shares an important typological character, male spicule possessing a strongly recurved condylus, with the “B. eremus group” and the “B. leoni group” of the genus, it was inferred to be monophyletic with the “B. fungivorus group”. The uniquely shaped stylet and well-developed pharyngeal glands is reminiscent of the fig-floret parasitic but paraphyletic assemblage of “Schistonchus”. Thus, these morphological characters appear to be an extreme example of convergent evolution in the nematode family, Aphelenchoididae, inside figs. Other characters shared by the new species and its close relatives, i.e., lack of ventral P1 male genital papilla, female vulval flap, and papilla-shaped P4 genital papillae in males, corroborate the molecular phylogenetic inference. The unique biological character of obligate plant parasitism and highly derived appearance of the ingestive organs of Bursaphelenchus sycophilus n. sp. expands our knowledge of the potential morphological, physiological and developmental plasticity of the genus Bursaphelenchus."
https://openalex.org/W1983897461,"Excessive opening of undocked Cx26 hemichannels in the plasma membrane is associated with disease pathogenesis in keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness (KID) syndrome. Thus far, excessive opening of KID mutant hemichannels has been attributed, almost solely, to aberrant inhibition by extracellular Ca(2+). This study presents two new possible contributing factors, pH and Zn(2+). Plasma pH levels and micromolar concentrations of Zn(2+) inhibit WT Cx26 hemichannels. However, A40V KID mutant hemichannels show substantially reduced inhibition by these factors. Using excised patches, acidification was shown to be effective from either side of the membrane, suggesting a protonation site accessible to H(+) flux through the pore. Sensitivity to pH was not dependent on extracellular aminosulfonate pH buffers. Single channel recordings showed that acidification did not affect unitary conductance or block the hemichannel but rather promoted gating to the closed state with transitions characteristic of the intrinsic loop gating mechanism. Examination of two nearby KID mutants in the E1 domain, G45E and D50N, showed no changes in modulation by pH or Zn(2+). N-bromo-succinimide, but not thiol-specific reagents, attenuated both pH and Zn(2+) responses. Individually mutating each of the five His residues in WT Cx26 did not reveal a key His residue that conferred sensitivity to pH or Zn(2+). From these data and the crystal structure of Cx26 that suggests that Ala-40 contributes to an intrasubunit hydrophobic core, the principal effect of the A40V mutation is probably a perturbation in structure that affects loop gating, thereby affecting multiple factors that act to close Cx26 hemichannels via this gating mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2066416949,"Fourteen saxicolous lichens from trans-Himalayan Ladakh region were identified by morpho-anatomical and chemical characteristics. The n-hexane, methanol and water extracts of the lichens were evaluated for their antioxidant capacities. The lichen extracts showing high antioxidant capacities and rich phenolic content were further investigated to determine their cytotoxic activity on human HepG2 and RKO carcinoma cell lines. The ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), 2,2′-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS), 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and nitric oxide (NO) radical scavenging capacities and β-carotene-linoleic acid bleaching property exhibited analogous results where the lichen extracts showed high antioxidant action. The lichen extracts were also found to possess good amount of total proanthocyanidin, flavonoid and polyphenol. The methanolic extract of Lobothallia alphoplaca exhibited highest FRAP value. Methanolic extract of Xanthoparmelia stenophylla showed the highest ABTS radical scavenging capacity. The n-hexane extract of Rhizoplaca chrysoleuca exhibited highest DPPH radical scavenging capacity. Highest antioxidant capacity in terms of β-carotene linoleic acid bleaching property was observed in the water extract of Xanthoria elegans. Similarly, Melanelia disjuncta water extract showed highest NO scavenging capacity. Among n-hexane, methanol and water extracts of all lichens, the methanolic extract of Xanthoparmelia mexicana showed highest total proanthocyanidin, flavonoid and polyphenol content. From cytotoxic assay, it was observed that the methanolic extracts of L. alphoplaca and M. disjuncta were exhibiting high cytotoxic effects against cancer cell growth. Similarly, the water extract of Dermatocarpon vellereum, Umbilicaria vellea, X. elegans and M. disjuncta and the methanolic extract of M. disjuncta and X. stenophylla were found to possess high antioxidant capacities and were non-toxic and may be used as natural antioxidants for stress related problems. Our studies go on to prove that the unique trans-Himalayan lichens are a hitherto untapped bioresource with immense potential for discovery of new chemical entities, and this biodiversity needs to be tapped sustainably."
https://openalex.org/W1965788640,"Wild and domestic ruminants are susceptible to Bluetongue virus (BTV) infection. Three BTV serotypes (BTV-4, BTV-1 and BTV-8) have been detected in Spain in the last decade. Even though control strategies have been applied to livestock, BTV circulation has been frequently detected in wild ruminant populations in Spain. The aim of the present study is to assess the role for wild ruminants in maintaining BTV after the vaccination programs in livestock in mainland Spain. A total of 931 out 1,914 (48.6%) serum samples, collected from eight different wild ruminant species between 2006 and 2011, were BTV positive by ELISA. In order to detect specific antibodies against BTV-1, BTV-4 and BTV-8, positive sera were also tested by serumneutralisation test (SNT). From the ELISA positive samples that could be tested by SNT (687 out of 931), 292 (42.5%) showed neutralising antibodies against one or two BTV serotypes. For each BTV serotype, the number of outbreaks in livestock (11,857 outbreaks in total) was modelled with pure autoregressive models and the resulting smoothed values, representing the predicted number of BTV outbreaks in livestock at municipality level, were positively correlated with BTV persistence in wild species. The strength of this relationship significantly decreased as red deer (Cervus elaphus) population abundance increased. In addition, BTV RNA was detected by real time RT-PCR in 32 out of 311 (10.3%) spleen samples from seropositive animals. Although BT outbreaks in livestock have decreased substantially after vaccination campaigns, our results indicated that wild ruminants have been exposed to BTV in territories where outbreaks in domestic animals occurred. The detection of BTV RNA and spatial association between BT outbreaks in livestock and BTV rates in red deer are consistent with the hypothesis of virus circulation and BTV maintenance within Iberian wild ruminant populations."
https://openalex.org/W2022706455,"Marine megafauna tend to migrate vast distances, often crossing national borders and pose a significant challenge to managers. This challenge is particularly acute in the Pacific, which contains numerous small island nations and thousands of kilometers of continental margins. The green sea turtle, Chelonia mydas, is one such megafauna that is endangered in Pacific waters due to the overexploitation of eggs and adults for human consumption. Data from long-term tagging programs in Queensland (Australia) and New Caledonia were analysed to investigate the migrations by C. mydas across the Coral Sea between their nesting site and their feeding grounds. A review of data collected over the last 50 years by different projects identified multiple migrations of C. mydas to and from New Caledonia (n = 97) and indicate that turtles foraging in New Caledonia nest in the Great Barrier Reef (Australia) and vice versa. Several explanations exist for turtles exhibiting this energetically costly movement pattern from breeding to distant foraging grounds (1200–2680 km away) despite viable foraging habitat being available in the local vicinity. These include hatchling drift, oceanic movements and food abundance predictability. Most of the tag recoveries in New Caledonia belonged to females from the south Great Barrier Reef genetic stock. Some females (n = 2) even showed fidelity to foraging sites located 1200 km away from the nesting site located in New Caledonia. This study also reveals previously unknown migrations pathways of turtles within the Coral Sea."
https://openalex.org/W2085999738,"The alpha toxin of Staphylococcus aureus is a pore forming toxin that penetrates host cell membranes causing osmotic swelling, rupture, lysis and subsequently cell death. Haemolysin alpha is toxic to a wide range of different mammalian cells; i.e., neurotoxic, dermonecrotic, haemolytic, and it can cause lethality in a wide variety of animals. In this study, the in vitro alpha toxin production of 648 previously genotyped isolates of S. aureus was measured quantitatively using antibody microarrays. Isolates originated from medical and veterinary settings and were selected in order to represent diverse clonal complexes and defined clinical conditions. Generally, the production of alpha toxin in vitro is related to the clonal complex affiliation. For clonal complexes CC22, CC30, CC45, CC479, CC705 and others, invariably no alpha toxin production was noted under the given in vitro conditions, while others, such as CC1, CC5, CC8, CC15 or CC96 secreted variable or high levels of alpha toxin. There was no correlation between alpha toxin yield and clinical course of the disease, or between alpha toxin yield and host species."
https://openalex.org/W2012322568,"Previous studies in our laboratory showed that N-acetylcysteine supplementation or aerobic training reduced oxidative stress and the progression of diabetic nephropathy in rats. The P2X(7 receptor is up-regulated in pathological conditions, such as diabetes mellitus. This up-regulation is related to oxidative stress and induces tissue apoptosis or necrosis. The aim of the present study is to assess the role of P2X(7) receptor in the kidneys of diabetic rats submitted to aerobic training or N-acetylcysteine supplementation. Diabetes was induced in male Wistar rats by streptozotocin (60 mg/kg, i.v.) and the training was done on a treadmill; N-acetylcysteine was given in the drinking water (600 mg/L). By confocal microscopy, as compared to control, the kidneys of diabetic rats showed increased P2 × 7 receptor expression and a higher activation in response to 2'(3')-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl) adenosine5'-triphosphate (specific agonist) and adenosine triphosphate (nonspecific agonist) (all p<0.05). All these alterations were reduced in diabetic rats treated with N-acetylcysteine, exercise or both. We also observed measured proteinuria and albuminuria (early marker of diabetic nephropathy) in DM groups. Lipoperoxidation was strongly correlated with P2X(7) receptor expression, which was also correlated to NO•, thus associating this receptor to oxidative stress and kidney lesion. We suggest that P2X(7) receptor inhibition associated with the maintenance of redox homeostasis could be useful as coadjuvant treatment to delay the progression of diabetic nephropathy."
https://openalex.org/W1992605896,"Precise genome modification is essential for the molecular dissection of Candida albicans, and is yielding invaluable information about the roles of specific gene functions in this major fungal pathogen of humans. C. albicans is naturally diploid, unable to undergo meiosis, and utilizes a non-canonical genetic code. Hence, specialized tools have had to be developed for gene disruption in C. albicans that permit the deletion of both target alleles, and in some cases, the recycling of the Candida-specific selectable markers. Previously, we developed a tool based on the Cre recombinase, which recycles markers in C. albicans with 90-100% efficiency via site-specific recombination between loxP sites. Ironically, the utility of this system was hampered by the extreme efficiency of Cre, which prevented the construction in Escherichia coli of stable disruption cassettes carrying a methionine-regulatable CaMET3p-cre gene flanked by loxP sites. Therefore, we have significantly enhanced this system by engineering new Clox cassettes that carry a synthetic, intron-containing cre gene. The Clox kit facilitates efficient transformation and marker recycling, thereby simplifying and accelerating the process of gene disruption in C. albicans. Indeed, homozygous mutants can be generated and their markers resolved within two weeks. The Clox kit facilitates strategies involving single marker recycling or multi-marker gene disruption. Furthermore, it includes the dominant NAT1 marker, as well as URA3, HIS1 and ARG4 cassettes, thereby permitting the manipulation of clinical isolates as well as genetically marked strains of C. albicans. The accelerated gene disruption strategies afforded by this new Clox system are likely to have a profound impact on the speed with which C. albicans pathobiology can be dissected."
https://openalex.org/W1999073504,"Shuang-huang-lian injection (SHLI) is a famous Chinese patent medicine, which has been wildly used in clinic for the treatment of acute respiratory tract infection, pneumonia, influenza, etc. The existing randomized controlled trial (RCT) studies suggested that SHLI could afford a certain anti-febrile action. However, seldom does research concern the pharmacological mechanisms of SHLI. In the current study, we explored plasma metabolomic profiling technique and selected potential metabolic markers to reveal the antipyretic mechanism of SHLI on yeast-induced pyrexia rat model using UPLC-Q-TOF/MS coupled with multivariate statistical analysis and pattern recognition techniques. We discovered a significant perturbance of metabolic profile in the plasma of fever rats and obvious reversion in SHLI-administered rats. Eight potential biomarkers, i.e. 1) 3-hydeoxybutyric acid, 2) leucine, 3) 16∶0 LPC, 4) allocholic acid, 5) vitamin B2, 6) Cys-Lys-His, 7) 18∶2 LPC, and 8) 3-hydroxychola-7, 22-dien-24-oic acid, were screened out by OPLS-DA approach. Five potential perturbed metabolic pathways, i.e. 1) valine, leucine, and isoleucine biosynthesis, 2) glycerophospholipid metabolism, 3) ketone bodies synthesis and degradation, 4) bile acid biosynthesis, and 5) riboflavin metabolism, were revealed to relate to the antipyretic mechanisms of SHLI. Overall, we investigated antipyretic mechanisms of SHLI at metabolomic level for the first time, and the obtained results highlights the necessity of adopting metabolomics as a reliable tool for understanding the holism and synergism of Chinese patent drug."
https://openalex.org/W2020730431,"The hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFα) are the critical factors that couple angiogenesis and osteogenesis by activating transcription of VEGF in osteoblasts. Mice lacking von Hippel–Lindau gene (Vhl), thus overexpressing HIFα in osteoblasts develop extremely dense and highly vascularized long bones. Here we provide evidence that osteoblasts lacking Vhl overexpress and secrete high levels of VEGF, which subsequently promotes the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) by promoting expression of Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in BMSC. Conditioned medium from osteoblasts Vhl (CM-CRE) promoted the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of BMSC, in comparison with conditioned medium derived from normal osteoblasts (CM-GFP). Recombinant VEGF stimulated the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of BMSC culturing in CM-GFP. By contrast, VEGF-neutralizing antibody inhibited the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of BMSC culturing in CM-CRE. Treatment with a HO-1 inhibitor, SnPP, significantly inhibited VEGF-induced BMSC proliferation and osteogenic differentiation. On the contrary, activation of HO-1 with CoPP reversed the suppressing of VEGF-antibody on the proliferation and osteogesis of BMSC culturing in CM-CRE. These studies suggest that osteoblasts promote the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of BMCS by VEGF/HO-1 pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2027537257,"Ion channels are an attractive class of drug targets, but progress in developing inhibitors for therapeutic use has been limited largely due to challenges in identifying subtype selective small molecules.

Importantly, these peptides often bind to hyper-variable extracellular loops, creating the potential for subtype selectivity rarely achieved with small molecules. We have engineered scorpion venom peptides and incorporated them in fusion proteins to generate highly potent and selective Kv1.3 inhibitors with long in vivo half-lives.

Our results support an emerging approach to generating subtype selective therapeutic ion channel inhibitors. Ion channels are integral membrane proteins that, through generation of electric currents, regulate diverse cellular functions in excitable tissues such as the heart and central nervous system as well as non-excitable tissue such as lymphocytes, and they are targets for many marketed drugs (1.Overington J.P. Al-Lazikani B. Hopkins A.L. How many drug targets are there?.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2006; 5: 993-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (2780) Google Scholar). However, many ion channel drugs are relatively non-selective, often exhibit dose-limiting side effects, and are rarely 100% effective, and there remains a clear need for second generation ion channel drugs with greater selectivity, fewer side effects, and improved efficacy. Unfortunately, the identification of highly selective, second generation, drugs has been challenging, largely due to the fact that the transmembrane regions of ion channels targeted by small molecules are highly conserved among different sub-types (2.Ragsdale D.S. McPhee J.C. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Common molecular determinants of local anesthetic, antiarrhythmic, and anticonvulsant block of voltage-gated Na+ channels.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

With considerable effort failing to yield target selectivity, alternative approaches including the use of new classes of molecules need to be explored. There has been an increasing interest in the use of venom-derived peptides as therapeutics (3.Doggrell S.A. Intrathecal ziconotide for refractory pain.Expert. Opin. Investig.

More importantly, these peptides often bind to the poorly conserved extracellular loops of ion channels, offering the potential for significant subtype selectivity. Venom peptides, however, do not usually possess all the necessary properties for successful pharmaceutical development. Their potency and selectivity for the therapeutic target may not be optimal, and their plasma half-lives may not be sufficient for therapeutic applications.

Our efforts resulted in the identification of several highly potent, selective, long plasma half-life Kv1.3 blocking fusion proteins that may be useful in the treatment of autoimmune diseases. This approach may also be applicable to targeting other ion channels with therapeutic potential. Full-length Kv channel cDNA clones, all of human origin unless otherwise stated, with accession number in parentheses, were generated using Janssen's GENEWRITER™ proprietary gene assembly technology as previously described (22.Evans G.A.

Human chimeric channel constructs were generated for higher cell surface expression levels: Kv1.3 E3 chimera was assembled with Kv1.5 amino acids 1–455 and 496–613 and Kv1.3 E3 loop amino acids 456–495; Kv1.1 E3 chimera was assembled with His-tag amino acids 1–9, HRV3C site 10–17, Kv1.5 amino acids 18–472 and 513–630, and Kv1.1 E3 loop amino acids 473–512; Kv1.3 chimera was assembled with Kv1.5 amino acids 1–250 and 497–593 and Kv1.3 amino acids 251–496; Kv1.1 chimera was assembled with Kv1.5 amino acids 1–250 and 492–588 and Kv1.1 amino acids 251–491. Kv channel constructs were cloned into a CMV promoter driven mammalian expression vector and either transiently or stably expressed in HEK or CHO cells. Kv constructs were also cloned into pcDNA4/TO and stably expressed in CHO-TREx cells (Invitrogen) to generate cell lines that expressed human potassium channels in a tetracycline-inducible manner. For electrophysiological experiments, cells were co-transfected with truncated CD4 (pMACs 4.1, Miltenyi Biotech). All cell culture reagents were obtained from Invitrogen. CHO cells transiently expressing Kv1.4, Kv1.6, or Kv1.7 were purchased from Chantest (Cleveland, OH). HEK 293-E cells were transfected with plasmid DNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) or Max transfection reagent. Peptide-Fc fusion proteins were purified from day 4 culture supernatants using Protein A-Sepharose 4FF resin or an AKTA XpressTM chromatography system (GE Healthcare). His-tagged peptide fusions were purified on a HisTrap column. Protein concentrations were determined by absorbance at 280 and 310 nm on a BioTek SynergyHTTM spectrophotometer. If necessary, the purified proteins were concentrated with a 10,000 molecular weight cutoff centrifugal concentrator (Millipore). The quality of the purified proteins was assessed by SDS-PAGE and analytical size exclusion HPLC (Dionex HPLC system). Endotoxin levels were measured using a limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) assay. Peptide synthesis was performed on Fmoc-Lys(Boc)-Wang (Boc, t-butoxycarbonyl) resin 0.47 mmol/g substitution (Peptides International) via solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) using an ABI Model 433A automated peptide synthesizer. The standard 0.1-mmol-scale FastMoc MonPrevPeak protocols were used for HBTU/HOBt/DIEA (N,N-diisopropylethylamine/2-(1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate/hydroxybenzotriazole) activation. Pseudoproline dipeptide Fmoc-Ile-Ser(ΨMeMepro)-OH (Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; Novabiochem) was incorporated at the position shown in bold and underlined in the sequence GVPINVKCKISRQCIEPCKDAGMRFGKCMNGKCHCTPK resin. The amino acid side-chain functionality was protected as follows: Arg(Pmc), Asn(Trt), Asp(OtBu), Cys(Trt), Glu(OtBu), Gln(Trt), Lys(Boc), Ser(tBu), and Thr(tBu) (Boc, t-butoxycarbonyl) (where Pmc is 2,2,5,7,8-pentamethyl-chroman-6-sulfonyl chloride and Trt is triphenylmethyl). Peptide was cleaved from the resin with TFA buffer (1.5 g of phenol in 4 ml of 1,2 ethanedithiol, 1 ml of thioanisole, 1 ml of water, and 1 ml of triisopropylsilane) and precipitated with precooled ethyl ether. The peptide was oxidized at 100 μg/ml in 0.1 m Tris-HCL, 1 m guanidine-HCL, 1 mm EDTA, 3 mm reduced glutathione, and 0.3 mm oxidized glutathione, and the reaction was stopped by reducing the pH to 3.9 with glacial acetic acid. The peptide was lyophilized, purified by Vydac C-18 RP-HPLC, and analyzed with RP-HPLC, capillary electrophoresis, and LC/MC on purity and molecular mass. HEK 293F cells (Invitrogen) stably transfected with chimeric Kv channel expression constructs were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 600 μg/ml Geneticin (all reagents from Invitrogen). Kv-transfected cells at 2 × 105 cells/well in 96-well V bottom polypropylene plates (Costar) were treated with venom peptide fusion samples in spent Freestyle 293 media or in PBS supplemented with 2% FBS (FACS buffer) at 4 °C for 1 h. Cells were then washed with FACS buffer and incubated with either Cy5-conjugated goat anti-human Fc Fab′2 (Jackson ImmunoResearch Inc.) or a 1:200 mixture of biotinylated goat anti-human albumin (Abcam) and streptavidin-phycoerythrin. Cells after staining were washed with FACS buffer, fixed with CytofixTM fixation buffer (BD Biosciences), and acquired with the FACSArray flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Data were analyzed in FlowJo software (Treestar), and geometric mean fluorescence intensities of cell-bound peptide fusions were compared with Odk2-Fc or KV261-HSA-23 and reported as % parent. Binding of peptides or peptide fusion proteins to cells transfected with chimeric Kv1.3 was performed as described in the previous section followed by 1 h of incubation with agitoxin-2-Cys-6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine (10 nm, Alomone). Cells were then washed with FACS buffer and acquired for analysis as described in the previous section. For Ki calculations, the KD value for agitoxin-2-Cys-6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine was determined to be 0.2 nm by whole cell manual patch-clamp electrophysiology (data not shown; see also Ref. 24.Triggle D.J.

Human PBMCs were obtained from AllCells LLC or purified from healthy donor blood by Ficoll-Paque (GE Healthcare) density centrifugation. Purified PBMCs were plated in 96-well culture plates at 1 × 106 cells/well in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FBS and incubated overnight with Kv1.3 blockers. Cytokines in overnight PBMC culture supernatants were detected with TH1/TH2 10-plex human cytokine kit (Meso Scale Discovery). Cells for use in electrophysiological assays were plated at low density onto glass coverslips 24 h before recording and maintained in appropriate media. On the day of the experiment, glass coverslips were placed in a bath on the stage of an inverted microscope and perfused (∼1 ml/min) with an extracellular solution of the following composition: 137 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 5.4 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4. Pipettes were filled with an intracellular solution of the following composition: 40 mm KCl, 100 mm KF, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3 to 7.4, and had a resistance of 2–4 megaohms. All recordings were made at room temperature (22–24 °C) using a Multiclamp 700A amplifier and pClamp 9 software (Axon Instruments). Transiently transfected CHO cells were identified using anti-CD4-coated beads (Dynabeads, Invitrogen). Outward potassium currents were measured using the whole-cell configuration of the patch clamp technique at a test potential of 20–40 mV from a holding potential of −80 mV. Current records were acquired at 2–5 KHz and filtered at 1–2 KHz. Uncompensated series resistance was typically <10 megaohms, and 80% series resistance compensation was routinely applied. Currents were elicited once every 20s and were allowed to stabilize for 5–10 min before recording. Compounds were applied using an SF-77B Fast-Step Perfusion device (Warner Instruments). 1–4 concentrations of compound were tested per cell. Chimeric Kv channel expressing HEK293F cells were plated at 10,000 cells per well into poly-lysine-coated 384-well microtiter plates (BD Biosciences). Cell plates were washed with assay buffer (130 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 5 mm glucose) using a Biotek EL405. Cells were stained for 30 min with FluxOR dye (Invitrogen) in assay buffer plus 2 mm probenecid at room temperature in the dark. The dye was then washed off with assay buffer. Thallium dye fluorescence in response to the addition of stimulus buffer was monitored in the presence or absence of test compounds using a FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices). The stimulus buffer contained 180 mm HEPES, 90 mm KOH, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm glucose, 1 mm Tl2SO4. The fluorescence change was measured 20 s after adding the stimulation buffer. Data were normalized to the average responses of control wells (n = 16 each of 10 nm Stichodactyla toxin peptide (ShK) for full inhibition controls and buffer-only for zero inhibition controls). Controls and standards were prepared in normal plasma (Bioreclamation). Concentrations of intact peptide-Fc fusion proteins in plasma were determined using direct binding assays as described above. The Fc portion of fusion proteins in plasma was detected by ELISA. Goat anti-human Fc polyclonal capture antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Inc.) was immobilized onto 96-well plates (Nunc), and HRP-conjugated donkey anti-human Fc polyclonal antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Inc.) was used to detect the captured Fc proteins using BM chemiluminescent substrate (Roche Applied Science) and an Envision plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Plasma concentrations of HSA, KV261 peptide, or KV261-HSA fusions were also measured in chemiluminescent ELISA assays. KV261 in plasma was measured using 384-well plates (Nunc) coated with anti-KV261 rabbit polyclonal capture antibody and detected with a 1:1000 mixture of biotinylated rabbit anti-261peptide polyclonal antibody and HRP-conjugated streptavidin (Roche Applied Science). HSA in plasma was measured using 384-well streptavidin-coated plates (Nunc) with biotinylated mouse anti-human albumin monoclonal capture antibody (Abcam) and detected with HRP-conjugated sheep anti-human albumin polyclonal antibody (Abcam). Minipig plasma samples used HRP-conjugated anti-penta-His (Qiagen) to detect the His tag on the C terminus of the fusion protein. All assays used chemiluminescent substrate (Roche Applied Science) and an Envision plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Heparinized blood from Yucatan swine or human donors was diluted with an equal volume of IMDM medium supplemented with 2% normal human A/B serum (Valley Biomedical Products & Service Inc.) and stimulated with 10 μm thapsigargin (Alomone) for 20 h. IL-17A levels in culture supernatants were measured in electrochemiluminescent immunoassays using a MA6000 plate reader (Meso Scale Discovery). Pig IL-17A was captured and detected with specific antibodies (Bethyl Laboratories), and purified porcine IL-17A was used as a standard. Human IL-17A was detected with an IL-17A MSD kit (Meso Scale Discovery). Measurement of IL-17A blocking effects by peptides, fusion proteins, or cyclosporine A was performed by preincubation of blood with compounds for 1 h before thapsigargin stimulation. Pharmacokinetic studies in rats were performed at the animal facility of Janssen R&D, San Diego, and the animal work was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Janssen R&D. Sprague-Dawley rats were dosed with KV261-Fc (3.0 mg/Kg) or KV261-HSA-34 (2.3 mg/Kg) by intravenous bolus, and blood samples were collected at time points up to 4 days. Compound plasma levels were analyzed in ELISA- and FACS-based assays to detect specifically the intact fusion proteins, the fusion partners, and the KV261 peptide as described in previous sections. Animal work on minipigs was performed by Comparative Biosciences, Inc. (Sunnyvale, CA) and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Comparative Biosciences. Pharmacokinetics of KV261-HSA-34 in Yucatan minipigs was tested after intravenous administration of the fusion protein at 2.3 mg/Kg, and blood samples were collected at time points up to day 56. KV261-HSA-34 plasma levels were measured in ELISA assays to specifically detect the intact fusion protein, the fusion partner, and the KV261 peptide as described in previous sections. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using Phoenix WinNonlin pharmacokinetic modeling software program (Certara). Heparinized blood (3 ml/animal) was collected from minipigs either untreated (n = 1) or injected with fusion protein (n = 4). Each blood sample was treated with 10 μm thapsigargin alone or thapsigargin plus 1 μm KV261. IL-17A concentrations were measured as described above. Inhibition of IL-17A production by exogenous KV261 was calculated as follows. % Inhibition by exogenous KV261 = ((thapsigargin IL-17A) - thapsigargin + 1 μM KV261 (IL-17A)/thapsigargin (IL−17A))×100(Eq. 1) A low % inhibition by exogenous KV261 for a given sample indicated all or the majority of Kv1.3-dependent IL-17A production was blocked by the injected fusion protein and was evidence of target engagement. Female Yucatan miniature swine, Sus scrofa domestica (Sinclair BioResources, LLC; Columbia, MO), at 3–7 months old weighing 12–35 kg were used in delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) studies. Studies were performed by Comparative Biosciences and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Comparative Biosciences. Keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) (Sigma) at 10 mg/ml was emulsified with incomplete Freund's adjuvant (BD Biosciences) at a 1:1 volume ratio. On day 0 animals were immunized by subcutaneous injection of 1 ml of KLH/incomplete Freund's adjuvant emulsion per site at ∼5 sites on the caudal aspect of the hind legs. Unimmunized control pigs were injected with PBS/incomplete Freund's adjuvant emulsion following the same procedures. On day 7, all animals were challenged by intradermal injection on the flanks with KLH at 10, 5, 2.5, and 1.25 mg/ml and PBS negative control, 0.1 ml per injection, and 2 injections per dose level. KV261-HSA-34 at 2.3 mg/ml and PBS vehicle control were dosed intravenously in a blinded fashion at 1 ml/kg on day −1 and day 6.

Cyclosporine A (Sandimmune) was dosed subcutaneously at 10 mg/ml and 1 ml/kg, twice daily from day −1 through day 8. The dosing regimens of KV261-HSA-34 and cyclosporine A used in this study blocked thapsigargin-induced IL-17A in minipig blood in preliminary experiments (data not shown). Induration at the challenge sites was measured at day 6 before antigen challenge and 1 and 2 days after challenge. Blood was collected at preimmunization and at 2 days post challenge for pharmacodynamic and bioanalytical tests. Necropsy was performed 2 days after the challenge. Skin biopsies at the challenge sites, draining inguinal nodes, and blood samples were collected at necropsy. Skin biopsies were fixed and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for histopathology evaluation. Skin sections were examined microscopically to assess inflammation scores based on the extent of inflammatory cell infiltration as well as ulceration and hyperkeratosis at the epidermis. Single cell suspensions were prepared from draining inguinal nodes, and cell numbers were counted with a hemocytometer. KLH-specific antibody titers in plasma were measured with ELISA. Values are reported as the means ± S.E. of the mean. Concentration-response data were fitted by non-linear regression (Graph Pad Prism, Version 4.0) using a four-parameter general logistic equation. Student's t test was performed on results from the draining lymph node cellularity data using PRISM (GraphPad). Concentrations of unknowns from quantitative immunoassays were determined from regression analysis of acquired raw data performed using SoftMaxPro (Molecular Devices).

https://openalex.org/W2092199204,"A pathogenic V67M mutation occurs at the E11 helical position within the heme pockets of variant human fetal and adult hemoglobins (Hb). Subsequent post-translational modification of Met to Asp was reported in γ subunits of human fetal Hb Toms River (γ67(E11)Val → Met) and β subunits of adult Hb (HbA) Bristol-Alesha (β67(E11)Val → Met) that were associated with hemolytic anemia. Using kinetic, proteomic, and crystal structural analysis, we were able to show that the Met → Asp transformation involves heme cycling through its oxoferryl state in the recombinant versions of both proteins. The conversion to Met and Asp enhanced the spontaneous autoxidation of the mutants relative to wild-type HbA and human fetal Hb, and the levels of Asp were elevated with increasing levels of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Using H2(18)O2, we verified incorporation of (18)O into the Asp carboxyl side chain confirming the role of H2O2 in the oxidation of the Met side chain. Under similar experimental conditions, there was no conversion to Asp at the αMet(E11) position in the corresponding HbA Evans (α62(E11)Val → Met). The crystal structures of the three recombinant Met(E11) mutants revealed similar thioether side chain orientations. However, as in the solution experiments, autoxidation of the Hb mutant crystals leads to electron density maps indicative of Asp(E11) formation in β subunits but not in α subunits. This novel post-translational modification highlights the nonequivalence of human Hb α, β, and γ subunits with respect to redox reactivity and may have direct implications to α/β hemoglobinopathies and design of oxidatively stable Hb-based oxygen therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2321860368,"Cyclophilin (Cyp) allergens are considered pan-allergens due to frequently reported cross-reactivity. In addition to well studied fungal Cyps, a number of plant Cyps were identified as allergens (e.g. Bet v 7 from birch pollen, Cat r 1 from periwinkle pollen). However, there are conflicting data regarding their antigenic/allergenic cross-reactivity, with no plant Cyp allergen structures available for comparison. Because amino acid residues are fairly conserved between plant and fungal Cyps, it is particularly interesting to check whether they can cross-react. Cat r 1 was identified by immunoblotting using allergic patients' sera followed by N-terminal sequencing. Cat r 1 (∼ 91% sequence identity to Bet v 7) was cloned from a cDNA library and expressed in Escherichia coli. Recombinant Cat r 1 was utilized to confirm peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans-isomerase (PPIase) activity by a PPIase assay and the allergenic property by an IgE-specific immunoblotting and rat basophil leukemia cell (RBL-SX38) mediator release assay. Inhibition-ELISA showed cross-reactive binding of serum IgE from Cat r 1-allergic individuals to fungal allergenic Cyps Asp f 11 and Mala s 6. The molecular structure of Cat r 1 was determined by NMR spectroscopy. The antigenic surface was examined in relation to its plant, animal, and fungal homologues. The structure revealed a typical cyclophilin fold consisting of a compact β-barrel made up of seven anti-parallel β-strands along with two surrounding α-helices. This is the first structure of an allergenic plant Cyp revealing high conservation of the antigenic surface particularly near the PPIase active site, which supports the pronounced cross-reactivity among Cyps from various sources."
https://openalex.org/W2114570352,"Cognitive dysfunction is central to the schizophrenia phenotype. Genetic and functional studies have implicated Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia 1 (DISC1), a leading candidate gene for schizophrenia and related psychiatric conditions, in cognitive function. Altered expression of DISC1 and DISC1-interactors has been identified in schizophrenia. Dysregulated expression of DISC1-interactome genes might, therefore, contribute to schizophrenia susceptibility via disruption of molecular systems required for normal cognitive function. Here, the blood RNA expression levels of DISC1 and DISC1-interacting proteins were measured in 63 control subjects. Cognitive function was assessed using neuropsychiatric tests and functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to assess the activity of prefrontal cortical regions during the N-back working memory task, which is abnormal in schizophrenia. Pairwise correlations between gene expression levels and the relationship between gene expression levels and cognitive function and N-back-elicited brain activity were assessed. Finally, the expression levels of DISC1, AKAP9, FEZ1, NDEL1 and PCM1 were compared between 63 controls and 69 schizophrenic subjects. We found that DISC1-interactome genes showed correlated expression in the blood of healthy individuals. The expression levels of several interactome members were correlated with cognitive performance and N-back-elicited activity in the prefrontal cortex. In addition, DISC1 and NDEL1 showed decreased expression in schizophrenic subjects compared to healthy controls. Our findings highlight the importance of the coordinated expression of DISC1-interactome genes for normal cognitive function and suggest that dysregulated DISC1 and NDEL1 expression might, in part, contribute to susceptibility for schizophrenia via disruption of prefrontal cortex-dependent cognitive functions."
https://openalex.org/W2059513494,"Carotid artery occlusive disease gradually develops over time, eventually leading to cerebral infarction and high mortality rate. Animal models replicating cerebral infarction resulting from carotid artery occlusive disease have thus been developed to test potential novel treatments, which could be subsequently administered clinically.Adult C57BL/6J male mice were subjected to ameroid constrictor (AC) placement to gradually narrow the bilateral common carotid arteries. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured at several time points. At 7 and 28 days post-operation, post-mortem brain samples were analyzed for ischemic changes.The mortality rate was 58.8% at 28 days post-operation. Surviving mice with AC showed continuous reduction of CBF by up to 70% of the baseline level at 28 days. Most of the mice (75%) showed multiple cerebral infarctions in the gray and white matter. Non-surviving mice showed critical CBF reduction below 20-30% of the baseline level before death.The application of the AC on the bilateral common carotid arteries in mice could offer a reliable model of severe cerebrovascular insufficiency due to carotid artery occlusive disease and may thus be useful in exploring pharmacological intervention in stroke through monitoring survival rate, infarct formation, and CBF profile."
https://openalex.org/W2080423177,"β-cell mass in the pancreas increases significantly during pregnancy as an adaptation to maternal insulin resistance. Lineage tracing studies in rodents have presented conflicting evidence on the role of cell duplication in the formation of new β-cells during gestation, while recent human data suggest that new islets are a major contributor to increased β-cell mass in pregnancy. Here, we aim to: 1) determine whether a non-β-cell source contributes to the appearance of new β-cells during pregnancy and 2) investigate whether recapitulation of the embryonic developmental pathway involving high expression of neurogenin 3 (Ngn3) plays a role in the up-regulation of β-cell mass during pregnancy. Using a mouse β-cell lineage-tracing model, which labels insulin-producing β-cells with red fluorescent protein (RFP), we found that the percentage of labeled β-cells dropped from 97% prior to pregnancy to 87% at mid-pregnancy. This suggests contribution of a non-β-cell source to the increase in total β-cell numbers during pregnancy. In addition, we observed a population of hormone-negative, Ngn3-positive cells in islets of both non-pregnant and pregnant mice, and this population dropped from 12% of all islets cells in the non-pregnant mice to 5% by day 8 of pregnancy. Concomitantly, a decrease in expression of Ngn3 and changes in its upstream regulatory network (Sox9 and Hes-1) as well as downstream targets (NeuroD, Nkx2.2, Rfx6 and IA1) were also observed during pregnancy. Our results show that duplication of pre-existing β-cells is not the sole source of new β-cells during pregnancy and that Ngn3 may be involved in this process."
https://openalex.org/W2026870658,"Recent years have witnessed a growing interest in developing methods for 3D face recognition. However, 3D scans often suffer from the problems of missing parts, large facial expressions, and occlusions. To be useful in real-world applications, a 3D face recognition approach should be able to handle these challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel general approach to deal with the 3D face recognition problem by making use of multiple keypoint descriptors (MKD) and the sparse representation-based classification (SRC). We call the proposed method 3DMKDSRC for short. Specifically, with 3DMKDSRC, each 3D face scan is represented as a set of descriptor vectors extracted from keypoints by meshSIFT. Descriptor vectors of gallery samples form the gallery dictionary. Given a probe 3D face scan, its descriptors are extracted at first and then its identity can be determined by using a multitask SRC. The proposed 3DMKDSRC approach does not require the pre-alignment between two face scans and is quite robust to the problems of missing data, occlusions and expressions. Its superiority over the other leading 3D face recognition schemes has been corroborated by extensive experiments conducted on three benchmark databases, Bosphorus, GavabDB, and FRGC2.0. The Matlab source code for 3DMKDSRC and the related evaluation results are publicly available at http://sse.tongji.edu.cn/linzhang/3dmkdsrcface/3dmkdsrc.htm."
https://openalex.org/W2068003956,"It is known that humans tend to misjudge the kinematics of a target rolling down an inclined plane. Because visuomotor responses are often more accurate and less prone to perceptual illusions than cognitive judgments, we asked the question of how rolling motion is extrapolated for manual interception or drawing tasks. In three experiments a ball rolled down an incline with kinematics that differed as a function of the starting position (4 different positions) and slope (30°, 45° or 60°). In Experiment 1, participants had to punch the ball as it fell off the incline. In Experiment 2, the ball rolled down the incline but was stopped at the end; participants were asked to imagine that the ball kept moving and to punch it. In Experiment 3, the ball rolled down the incline and was stopped at the end; participants were asked to draw with the hand in air the trajectory that would be described by the ball if it kept moving. We found that performance was most accurate when motion of the ball was visible until interception and haptic feedback of hand-ball contact was available (Experiment 1). However, even when participants punched an imaginary moving ball (Experiment 2) or drew in air the imaginary trajectory (Experiment 3), they were able to extrapolate to some extent global aspects of the target motion, including its path, speed and arrival time. We argue that the path and kinematics of a ball rolling down an incline can be extrapolated surprisingly well by the brain using both visual information and internal models of target motion."
https://openalex.org/W2064598880,"The heartbeat arises rhythmically in the sino-atrial node (SAN) and then spreads regularly throughout the heart. The molecular mechanism underlying SAN rhythm has been attributed by recent studies to the interplay between two clocks, one involving the hyperpolarization activated cation current If (the membrane clock), and the second attributable to activation of the electrogenic NaCa exchanger by spontaneous sarcoplasmic releases of calcium (the calcium clock). Both mechanisms contain, in principle, sources of beat-to-beat cycle length variability, which can determine the intrinsic variability of SAN firing and, in turn, contribute to the heart rate variability. In this work we have recorded long sequences of action potentials from patch clamped guinea pig SAN cells (SANCs) perfused, in turn, with normal Tyrode solution, with the If inhibitor ivabradine (3 µM), then back to normal Tyrode, and again with the ryanodine channels inhibitor ryanodine (3 µM). We have found that, together with the expected increase in beating cycle length (+25%), the application of ivabradine brought about a significant and dramatic increase in beat-to-beat cycle length variability (+50%). Despite the similar effect on firing rate, ryanodine did not modify significantly beat-to-beat cycle length variability. Acetylcholine was also applied and led to a 131% increase of beating cycle length, with only a 70% increase in beat-to-beat cycle length variability. We conclude that the main source of inter-beat variability of SANCs firing rate is related to the mechanism of the calcium clock, whereas the membrane clock seems to act in stabilizing rate. Accordingly, when the membrane clock is silenced by application of ivabradine, stochastic variations of the calcium clock are free to make SANCs beating rhythm more variable."
https://openalex.org/W1974997742,"Anti-EGFR therapy is commonly used to treat colorectal cancer (CRC), although only a subset of patients benefit from the treatment. While KRAS mutation predicts non-responsiveness, positive predictive markers are not in clinical practice. We previously showed that immunohistochemistry (IHC)-guided EGFR gene copy number (GCN) analysis may identify CRC patients benefiting from anti-EGFR treatment. Here we tested the predictive value of such analysis in chemorefractory metastatic CRC, elucidated EGFR GCN heterogeneity within the tumors, and evaluated the association between EGFR GCN, KRAS status, and anti-EGFR antibody response in CRC cell lines. The chemorefractory patient cohort consisted of 54 KRAS wild-type (WT) metastatic CRC patients. EGFR GCN status was analyzed by silver in situ hybridization using a cut-off value of 4.0 EGFR gene copies/cell. KRAS-WT and KRAS mutant CRC cell lines with different EGFR GCN were used in in vitro studies. The chemorefractory CRC tumors with EGFR GCN increase (≥4.0) responded better to anti-EGFR therapy than EGFR GCN (<4.0) tumors (clinical benefit, P = 0.0004; PFS, HR = 0.23, 95% CI 0.12-0.46). EGFR GCN counted using EGFR IHC guidance was significantly higher than the value from randomly selected areas verifying intratumoral EGFR GCN heterogeneity. In CRC cell lines, EGFR GCN correlated with EGFR expression. Best anti-EGFR response was seen with KRAS-WT, EGFR GCN = 4 cells and poorest response with KRAS-WT, EGFR GCN = 2 cells. Anti-EGFR response was associated with AKT and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, which was effectively inhibited only in cells with KRAS-WT and increased EGFR GCN. In conclusion, IHC-guided EGFR GCN is a promising predictor of anti-EGFR treatment efficacy in chemorefractory CRC."
https://openalex.org/W2092748971,"Abundant, sustained expression of prosurvival Mcl-1 is an important determinant of viability and drug resistance in cancer cells. The Mcl-1 protein contains PEST sequences (enriched in proline, glutamic acid, serine, and threonine) and is normally subject to rapid turnover via multiple different pathways. One of these pathways involves a phosphodegron in the PEST region, where Thr-163 phosphorylation primes for Ser-159 phosphorylation by glycogen synthase kinase-3. Turnover via this phosphodegron-targeted pathway is reduced in Mcl-1-overexpressing BL41-3 Burkitt lymphoma and other cancer cells; turnover is further slowed in the presence of phorbol ester-induced ERK activation, resulting in Mcl-1 stabilization and an exacerbation of chemoresistance. The present studies focused on Mcl-1 dephosphorylation, which was also found to profoundly influence turnover. Exposure of BL41-3 cells to an inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), okadaic acid, resulted in a rapid increase in phosphorylation at Thr-163 and Ser-159, along with a precipitous decrease in Mcl-1 expression. The decline in Mcl-1 expression preceded the appearance of cell death markers and was not slowed in the presence of phorbol ester. Upon exposure to calyculin A, which also potently inhibits PP2A, versus tautomycin, which does not, only the former increased Thr-163/Ser-159 phosphorylation and decreased Mcl-1 expression. Mcl-1 co-immunoprecipitated with PP2A upon transfection into CHO cells, and PP2A/Aα knockdown recapitulated the increase in Mcl-1 phosphorylation and decrease in expression. In sum, inhibition of PP2A prevents Mcl-1 dephosphorylation and results in rapid loss of this prosurvival protein in chemoresistant cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W1968957568,"Recently published studies have elucidated alterations of mitochondrial oxidative metabolism during ageing. The intention of the present study was to evaluate the impact of ageing on cardiac high-energy phosphate metabolism and cardiac function in healthy humans. 31-phosphorus 2-dimensional chemical shift imaging (31P 2D CSI) and echocardiography were performed in 196 healthy male volunteers divided into groups of 20 to 40 years (I, n = 43), 40 to 60 years (II, n = 123) and >60 years (III, n = 27) of age. Left ventricular PCr/β-ATP ratio, myocardial mass (MM), ejection fraction and E/A ratio were assessed. Mean PCr/β-ATP ratios were significantly different among the three groups of volunteers (I, 2.10±0.37; II, 1.77±0.37; III, 1.45±0.28; all p<0.001). PCr/β-ATP ratios were inversely related to age (r2 = −0.25; p<0.001) with a decrease from 2.65 by 0.02 per year of ageing. PCr/β-ATP ratios further correlated with MM (r = −0.371; p<0.001) and E/A ratios (r = 0.213; p<0.02). Moreover, E/A ratios (r = −0.502, p<0.001), MM (r = 0.304, p<0.001), glucose-levels (r = 0.157, p<0.05) and systolic blood pressure (r = 0.224, p<0.005) showed significant correlations with age. The ejection fraction did not significantly differ between the groups. This study shows that cardiac PCr/β-ATP ratios decrease moderately with age indicating an impairment of mitochondrial oxidative metabolism due to age. Furthermore, MM increases, and E/A ratio decreases with age. Both correlate with left-ventricular PCr/β-ATP ratios. The findings of the present study confirm numerous experimental studies showing an impairment of cardiac mitochondrial function with age."
https://openalex.org/W2003440253,"Rationale Growth arrest DNA damage inducible alpha (GADD45a) is a stress-induced gene we have shown to participate in the pathophysiology of ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) via regulation of mechanical stress-induced Akt ubiquitination and phosphorylation. The regulation of GADD45a expression by mechanical stress and its relationship with acute lung injury (ALI) susceptibility and severity, however, remains unknown. Objectives We examined mechanical stress-dependent regulatory elements (MSRE) in the GADD45a promoter and the contribution of promoter polymorphisms in GADD45a expression and ALI susceptibility. Methods and Results Initial studies in GADD45a knockout and heterozygous mice confirmed the relationship of GADD45a gene dose to VILI severity. Human lung endothelial cells (EC) transfected with a luciferase vector containing the full length GADD45a promoter sequence (−771 to +223) demonstrated a >4 fold increase in GADD45a expression in response to 18% cyclic stretch (CS, 4 h) compared to static controls while specific promoter regions harboring CS-dependent MSRE were identified using vectors containing serial deletion constructs of the GADD45a promoter. In silico analyses of GADD45a promoter region (−371 to −133) revealed a potential binding site for specificity protein 1 (SP1), a finding supported by confirmed SP1 binding with the GADD45a promoter and by the significant attenuation of CS-dependent GADD45a promoter activity in response to SP1 silencing. Separately, case-control association studies revealed a significant association of a GADD45a promoter SNP at −589 (rs581000, G>C) with reduced ALI susceptibility. Subsequently, we found allelic variation of this SNP is associated with both differential GADD45a expression in mechanically stressed EC (18% CS, 4 h) and differential binding site of interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) at this site. Conclusion These results strongly support a functional role for GADD45a in ALI/VILI and identify a specific gene variant that confers risk for ALI."
https://openalex.org/W2138440979,"To evaluate in anti-HCV-positive patients the clinical impact of the rs35761398 variant of the CNR2 gene leading to the substitution of Gln (Q) of codon 63 of the cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2) with Arg (R).253 consecutive anti-HCV-/HCV-RNA-positive patients were enrolled, of whom 53 were HCV carriers with persistently normal ALT (PNALT group) and 200 had a history of steadily abnormal serum ALT values (abnormal ALT group). All patients were naive for antiviral therapy and were screened for the CNR2 rs35761398 polymorphism by a TaqMan assay.Subjects in the PNALT group, compared with those in the abnormal ALT group were older (58.5±12 vs. 50.7±12.4 years, p = 0.001), more frequently female (66% vs. 42%, p = 0.003), with lower body mass index (BMI) (24.5±3.1 vs. 26.6±4.6, p = 0.003), and more frequently with HCV genotype 2 (43.1% vs 17.7%, p = 0.0002) and CB2-63 QQ variant (34% vs. 11%, p = 0.0001). Considering all 253 patients, no difference in the demographic, biochemical, or virological data was observed between patients in the different CB2-63 variants. The logistic regression analysis identified CB2-63 QQ, HCV genotype 2, older age and lower BMI as independent predictors of PNALT (p<0.00001).The CB2-63 QQ variant in HCV patients was independently associated with the PNALT status."
https://openalex.org/W1972719947,"We propose a method for finding metabolic parameters of cells, organs and whole organisms, which is based on the earlier discovered general growth law. Based on the obtained results and analysis of available biological models, we propose a general framework for modeling biological phenomena and discuss how it can be used in Virtual Liver Network project. The foundational idea of the study is that growth of cells, organs, systems and whole organisms, besides biomolecular machinery, is influenced by biophysical mechanisms acting at different scale levels. In particular, the general growth law uniquely defines distribution of nutritional resources between maintenance needs and biomass synthesis at each phase of growth and at each scale level. We exemplify the approach considering metabolic properties of growing human and dog livers and liver transplants. A procedure for verification of obtained results has been introduced too. We found that two examined dogs have high metabolic rates consuming about 0.62 and 1 gram of nutrients per cubic centimeter of liver per day, and verified this using the proposed verification procedure. We also evaluated consumption rate of nutrients in human livers, determining it to be about 0.088 gram of nutrients per cubic centimeter of liver per day for males, and about 0.098 for females. This noticeable difference can be explained by evolutionary development, which required females to have greater liver processing capacity to support pregnancy. We also found how much nutrients go to biomass synthesis and maintenance at each phase of liver and liver transplant growth. Obtained results demonstrate that the proposed approach can be used for finding metabolic characteristics of cells, organs, and whole organisms, which can further serve as important inputs and constraints for many applications in biology (such as protein expression), biotechnology (synthesis of substances), and medicine."
https://openalex.org/W2021457782,"We report an experimental test of the hypothesis that contrasting traditions will persist for longer, maintaining cultural differences between otherwise similar groups, under conditions of uncertainty about payoffs from individual learning. We studied the persistence of two alternative, experimentally-introduced, task solutions in chains of human participants. In some chains, participants were led to believe that final payoffs would be difficult to predict for an innovative solution, and in others, participants were aware that their final payoff would be directly linked to their immediate solution. Although the difference between the conditions was illusory (only participants’ impressions were manipulated, not actual payoffs) clear differences were found between the conditions. Consistent with predictions, in the chains that were less certain about final payoffs, the distinctive variants endured over several replacement “generations” of participants. In contrast, in the other chains, the influence of the experimentally-introduced solutions was rapidly diluted by participants’ exploration of alternative approaches. The finding provides support for the notion that rates of cultural change are likely to be slower for behaviors for which the relationship between performance and payoff may be hard to predict."
https://openalex.org/W2047678639,"Objective The present study evaluated the reliability and concurrent validity of the new Tanaka B Intelligence Scale, which is an intelligence test that can be administered on groups within a short period of time. Methods The new Tanaka B Intelligence Scale and Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Third Edition were administered to 81 subjects (mean age ± SD 15.2±0.7 years) residing in a juvenile detention home; reliability was assessed using Cronbach’s alpha coefficient, and concurrent validity was assessed using the one-way analysis of variance intraclass correlation coefficient. Moreover, receiver operating characteristic analysis for screening for individuals who have a deficit in intellectual function (an FIQ<70) was performed. In addition, stratum-specific likelihood ratios for detection of intellectual disability were calculated. Results The Cronbach’s alpha for the new Tanaka B Intelligence Scale IQ (BIQ) was 0.86, and the intraclass correlation coefficient with FIQ was 0.83. Receiver operating characteristic analysis demonstrated an area under the curve of 0.89 (95% CI: 0.85–0.96). In addition, the stratum-specific likelihood ratio for the BIQ≤65 stratum was 13.8 (95% CI: 3.9–48.9), and the stratum-specific likelihood ratio for the BIQ≥76 stratum was 0.1 (95% CI: 0.03–0.4). Thus, intellectual disability could be ruled out or determined. Conclusion The present results demonstrated that the new Tanaka B Intelligence Scale score had high reliability and concurrent validity with the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Third Edition score. Moreover, the post-test probability for the BIQ could be calculated when screening for individuals who have a deficit in intellectual function. The new Tanaka B Intelligence Test is convenient and can be administered within a variety of settings. This enables evaluation of intellectual development even in settings where performing intelligence tests have previously been difficult."
https://openalex.org/W2069404403,"Online social networks such as Facebook, Twitter and Gowalla allow people to communicate and interact across borders. In past years online social networks have become increasingly important for studying the behavior of individuals, group formation, and the emergence of online societies. Here we focus on the characterization of the average growth of online social networks and try to understand which are possible processes behind seemingly long-range temporal correlated collective behavior. In agreement with recent findings, but in contrast to Gibrat's law of proportionate growth, we find scaling in the average growth rate and its standard deviation. In contrast, Renren and Twitter deviate, however, in certain important aspects significantly from those found in many social and economic systems. Whereas independent methods suggest no significance for temporally long-range correlated behavior for Renren and Twitter, a scaling analysis of the standard deviation does suggest long-range temporal correlated growth in Gowalla. However, we demonstrate that seemingly long-range temporal correlations in the growth of online social networks, such as in Gowalla, can be explained by a decomposition into temporally and spatially independent growth processes with a large variety of entry rates. Our analysis thus suggests that temporally or spatially correlated behavior does not play a major role in the growth of online social networks."
https://openalex.org/W2062833675,"In the event of a wide area release and contamination of a biological agent in an outdoor environment and to building exteriors, decontamination is likely to consume the Nation's remediation capacity, requiring years to cleanup, and leading to incalculable economic losses. This is in part due to scant body of efficacy data on surface areas larger than those studied in a typical laboratory (5×10-cm), resulting in low confidence for operational considerations in sampling and quantitative measurements of prospective technologies recruited in effective cleanup and restoration response. In addition to well-documented fumigation-based cleanup efforts, agencies responsible for mitigation of contaminated sites are exploring alternative methods for decontamination including combinations of disposal of contaminated items, source reduction by vacuuming, mechanical scrubbing, and low-technology alternatives such as pH-adjusted bleach pressure wash. If proven effective, a pressure wash-based removal of Bacillus anthracis spores from building surfaces with readily available equipment will significantly increase the readiness of Federal agencies to meet the daunting challenge of restoration and cleanup effort following a wide-area biological release. In this inter-agency study, the efficacy of commercial-of-the-shelf sporicidal disinfectants applied using backpack sprayers was evaluated in decontamination of spores on the surfaces of medium-sized (∼1.2 m2) panels of steel, pressure-treated (PT) lumber, and brick veneer. Of the three disinfectants, pH-amended bleach, Peridox, and CASCAD evaluated; CASCAD was found to be the most effective in decontamination of spores from all three panel surface types."
https://openalex.org/W1974630816,"The Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) is the northward flow of surface water to subpolar latitudes where deepwater is formed, balanced by southward abyssal flow and upwelling in the vicinity of the Southern Ocean. It is generally accepted that AMOC flow oscillates with a period of 60-80 years, creating a regular variation in North Atlantic sea surface temperature known as the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO). This article attempts to answer two questions: how is the AMOC driven and why does it oscillate? Using methods commonly employed by chemical engineers for analyzing processes involving flowing liquids, apparently not previously applied to trying to understand the AMOC, an equation is developed for AMOC flow as a function of the meridional density gradient or the corresponding temperature gradient. The equation is based on the similarity between the AMOC and an industrial thermosyphon loop cooler, which circulates a heat transfer liquid without using a mechanical pump. Extending this equation with an analogy between the flow of heat and electricity explains why the AMOC flow oscillates and what determines its period. Calculated values for AMOC flow and AMO oscillation period are in good agreement with measured values."
