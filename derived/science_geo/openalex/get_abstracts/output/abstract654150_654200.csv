https://openalex.org/W3022315945,"The primary structural component of the bacterial cell wall is peptidoglycan, which is essential for viability and the synthesis of which is the target for crucial antibiotics1,2. Peptidoglycan is a single macromolecule made of glycan chains crosslinked by peptide side branches that surrounds the cell, acting as a constraint to internal turgor1,3. In Gram-positive bacteria, peptidoglycan is tens of nanometres thick, generally portrayed as a homogeneous structure that provides mechanical strength4-6. Here we applied atomic force microscopy7-12 to interrogate the morphologically distinct Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis species, using live cells and purified peptidoglycan. The mature surface of live cells is characterized by a landscape of large (up to 60 nm in diameter), deep (up to 23 nm) pores constituting a disordered gel of peptidoglycan. The inner peptidoglycan surface, consisting of more nascent material, is much denser, with glycan strand spacing typically less than 7 nm. The inner surface architecture is location dependent; the cylinder of B. subtilis has dense circumferential orientation, while in S. aureus and division septa for both species, peptidoglycan is dense but randomly oriented. Revealing the molecular architecture of the cell envelope frames our understanding of its mechanical properties and role as the environmental interface13,14, providing information complementary to traditional structural biology approaches."
https://openalex.org/W3035264273,"The Japanese government instituted countermeasures against COVID-19, a pneumonia caused by the new coronavirus, in January 2020. Seeking “people’s behavioral changes,” in which the government called on the public to take precautionary measures or exercise self-restraint, was one of the important strategies. The purpose of this study is to investigate how and from when Japanese citizens have changed their precautionary behavior under circumstances in which the government has only requested their cooperation. This study uses micro data from a cross-sectional survey conducted on an online platform of an online research company, based on quota sampling that is representative of the Japanese population. By the end of March 2020, a total of 11,342 respondents, aged from 20 to 64 years, were recruited. About 85 percent reported practising the social distancing measures recommended by the government including more females than males and more older than younger participants. Frequent handwashing is conducted by 86 percent of all participants, 92 percent of female, and 87.9 percent of over-40 participants. The most important event influencing these precautionary actions was the infection aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which occurred in early February 2020 (23 percent). Information from the central and local governments, received by 60 percent of the participants, was deemed trustworthy by 50 percent. However, the results also showed that about 20 percent of the participants were reluctant to implement proper prevention measures. The statistical analysis indicated that the typical characteristics of those people were male, younger (under 30 years old), unmarried, from lower-income households, a drinking or smoking habit, and a higher extraversion score. To prevent the spread of infection in Japan, it is imperative to address these individuals and encourage their behavioural changes using various means to reach and influence them."
https://openalex.org/W3033644139,"Neurons are often considered specialized functional units that encode a single variable. However, many neurons are observed to respond to a mix of disparate sensory, cognitive, and behavioral variables. For such representations, information is distributed across multiple neurons. Here we find this distributed code in the dentate gyrus and CA1 subregions of the hippocampus. Using calcium imaging in freely moving mice, we decoded an animal's position, direction of motion, and speed from the activity of hundreds of cells. The response properties of individual neurons were only partially predictive of their importance for encoding position. Non-place cells encoded position and contributed to position encoding when combined with other cells. Indeed, disrupting the correlations between neural activities decreased decoding performance, mostly in CA1. Our analysis indicates that population methods rather than classical analyses based on single-cell response properties may more accurately characterize the neural code in the hippocampus."
https://openalex.org/W3020959435,"Tissue sculpting during development has been attributed mainly to cellular events through processes such as convergent extension or apical constriction1,2. However, recent work has revealed roles for basement membrane remodelling in global tissue morphogenesis3-5. Upon implantation, the epiblast and extraembryonic ectoderm of the mouse embryo become enveloped by a basement membrane. Signalling between the basement membrane and these tissues is critical for cell polarization and the ensuing morphogenesis6,7. However, the mechanical role of the basement membrane in post-implantation embryogenesis remains unknown. Here we demonstrate the importance of spatiotemporally regulated basement membrane remodelling during early embryonic development. Specifically, we show that Nodal signalling directs the generation and dynamic distribution of perforations in the basement membrane by regulating the expression of matrix metalloproteinases. This basement membrane remodelling facilitates embryo growth before gastrulation. The establishment of the anterior-posterior axis8,9 further regulates basement membrane remodelling by localizing Nodal signalling-and therefore the activity of matrix metalloproteinases and basement membrane perforations-to the posterior side of the embryo. Perforations on the posterior side are essential for primitive-streak extension during gastrulation by rendering the basement membrane of the prospective primitive streak more prone to breaching. Thus spatiotemporally regulated basement membrane remodelling contributes to the coordination of embryo growth, morphogenesis and gastrulation."
https://openalex.org/W3035442710,"Electroencephalography (EEG) datasets are often small and high dimensional, owing to cumbersome recording processes. In these conditions, powerful machine learning techniques are essential to deal with the large amount of information and overcome the curse of dimensionality. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have achieved promising performance in EEG-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) applications, but they involve computationally intensive training algorithms and hyperparameter optimization methods. Thus, an awareness of the quality-cost trade-off, although usually overlooked, is highly beneficial. In this paper, we apply a hyperparameter optimization procedure based on Genetic Algorithms to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Feed-Forward Neural Networks (FFNNs), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), all of them purposely shallow. We compare their relative quality and energy-time cost, but we also analyze the variability in the structural complexity of networks of the same type with similar accuracies. The experimental results show that the optimization procedure improves accuracy in all models, and that CNN models with only one hidden convolutional layer can equal or slightly outperform a 6-layer Deep Belief Network. FFNN and RNN were not able to reach the same quality, although the cost was significantly lower. The results also highlight the fact that size within the same type of network is not necessarily correlated with accuracy, as smaller models can and do match, or even surpass, bigger ones in performance. In this regard, overfitting is likely a contributing factor since deep learning approaches struggle with limited training examples."
https://openalex.org/W3033155268,"Objectives The primary objective of the present study was to compare the prevalence and patterns of second-hand smoke (SHS) exposure in the home, workplace, public places, and at all three places amongst the non-smoker respondents between the two rounds of Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS) in India. The secondary objectives were to assess the differences in various factors associated with SHS exposure among non-smokers. Study design This secondary data analysis incorporated data generated from the previous two rounds of the cross-sectional, nationally representative GATS India, which covered 69,296 and 74,037 individuals aged 15 years and above. Exposure to the SHS at home, workplace, and public places amongst the non-smokers were the primary outcome variables. Standard definitions of the surveys were used. Results The overall weighted prevalence of exposure to SHS amongst the non-smokers inside the home and public places reduced. In contrast, the prevalence in the workplace increased marginally in round II compared to I. The proportion of adults who were exposed to SHS at all three places did not change much in two rounds of surveys. A decrease in the knowledge of the respondents exposed to SHS at home and public places was observed about the harmful effects of smoking in round II. Age, gender, occupation, place, and region of respondents were found to be significant determinants of SHS exposure at all the three places on multinomial logistic regression analysis. Conclusions The study calls for focused interventions in India and stringent implementation of anti-tobacco legislation, especially in the workplaces for reducing the exposure to SHS amongst the non-smokers and to produce encouraging and motivating results by next round of the survey."

https://openalex.org/W3034065854,"Despite recent advances in clinical treatment, pancreatic cancer remains a highly lethal malignancy. In order to improve the survival rate of patients with pancreatic cancer, the development of non-invasive diagnostic methods using effective biomarkers is urgently needed. Here, we developed a highly sensitive method to detect DNA methylation in cell-free (cf)DNA samples based on the enrichment of methyl-CpG binding (MBD) protein coupled with a digital PCR method (MBD–ddPCR). Five DNA methylation markers for the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer were identified through DNA methylation microarray analysis in 37 pancreatic cancers. The sensitivity and specificity of the five markers were validated in another independent cohort of pancreatic cancers (100% and 100%, respectively; n = 46) as well as in The Cancer Genome Atlas data set (96% and 90%, respectively; n = 137). MBD–ddPCR analysis revealed that DNA methylation in at least one of the five markers was detected in 23 (49%) samples of cfDNA from 47 patients with pancreatic cancer. Further, a combination of DNA methylation markers and the KRAS mutation status improved the diagnostic capability of this method (sensitivity and specificity, 68% and 86%, respectively). Genome-wide MBD-sequencing analysis in cancer tissues and corresponding cfDNA revealed that more than 80% of methylated regions were overlapping; DNA methylation profiles of cancerous tissues and cfDNA significantly correlated with each other (R = 0.97). Our data indicate that newly developed MBD–ddPCR is a sensitive method to detect cfDNA methylation and that using five marker genes plus KRAS mutations may be useful for the detection of pancreatic cancers."
https://openalex.org/W3033712398,"Abstract Proteasome inhibitors have provided a significant advance in the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM). Consequently, there is increasing interest in developing strategies to target E3 ligases, de-ubiquitinases, and/or ubiquitin receptors within the ubiquitin proteasome pathway, with an aim to achieve more specificity and reduced side-effects. Previous studies have shown a role for the E3 ligase HUWE1 in modulating c-MYC, an oncogene frequently dysregulated in MM. Here we investigated HUWE1 in MM. We identified elevated expression of HUWE1 in MM compared with normal cells. Small molecule-mediated inhibition of HUWE1 resulted in growth arrest of MM cell lines without significantly effecting the growth of normal bone marrow cells, suggesting a favorable therapeutic index. Studies using a HUWE1 knockdown model showed similar growth inhibition. HUWE1 expression positively correlated with MYC expression in MM bone marrow cells and correspondingly, genetic knockdown and biochemical inhibition of HUWE1 reduced MYC expression in MM cell lines. Proteomic identification of HUWE1 substrates revealed a strong association of HUWE1 with metabolic processes in MM cells. Intracellular glutamine levels are decreased in the absence of HUWE1 and may contribute to MYC degradation. Finally, HUWE1 depletion in combination with lenalidomide resulted in synergistic anti-MM activity in both in vitro and in vivo models. Taken together, our data demonstrate an important role of HUWE1 in MM cell growth and provides preclinical rationale for therapeutic strategies targeting HUWE1 in MM."
https://openalex.org/W3033798608,"The current distribution area of the two sympatric oaks Quercus petraea and Q. robur covers most of temperate Western Europe. Depending on their geographic location, populations of these trees are exposed to different climate constraints, to which they are adapted. Comparing the performances of trees from contrasting populations provides the insight into their expected resilience to future climate change required for forest management. In this study, the descendants of 24 Q. petraea and two Q. robur provenances selected from sites throughout Europe were grown for 20 years in three common gardens with contrasting climates. The 2420 sampled trees allowed the assessments of the relationship between radial growth and climate. An analysis of 15-year chronologies of ring widths, with different combinations of climate variables, revealed different response patterns between provenances and between common gardens. As expected, provenances originating from sites with wet summers displayed the strongest responses to summer drought, particularly in the driest common garden. All provenances displayed positive significant relationships between the temperature of the previous winter and radial growth when grown in the common garden experiencing the mildest winter temperatures. Only eastern provenances from continental cold climates also clearly expressed this limitation of growth by cold winter temperatures in the other two common gardens. However, ecological distance, calculated on the basis of differences in climate between the site of origin and the common garden, was not clearly related to the radial growth responses of the provenances. This suggests that the gradient of genetic variability among the selected provenances was not strictly structured according to climate gradients. Based on these results, we provide guidelines for forest managers for the assisted migration of Quercus petraea and Q. robur provenances."
https://openalex.org/W3035631531,"Recurrent outbreaks of the influenza virus continue to pose a serious health threat all over the world. The role of mass media becomes increasingly important in modeling infectious disease transmission dynamics since it can provide public health information that influences risk perception and health behaviors. Motivated by the recent 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic outbreak in South Korea, a mathematical model has been developed. In this work, a previous influenza transmission model is modified by incorporating two distinct media effect terms in the transmission rate function; (1) a theory-based media effect term is defined as a function of the number of infected people and its rage of change and (2) a data-based media effect term employs the real-world media coverage data during the same period of the 2009 influenza outbreak. The transmission rate and the media parameters are estimated through the least-squares fitting of the influenza model with two media effect terms to the 2009 H1N1 cumulative number of confirmed cases. The impacts of media effect terms are investigated in terms of incidence and cumulative incidence. Our results highlight that the theory-based and data-based media effect terms have almost the same influence on the influenza dynamics under the parameters obtained in this study. Numerical simulations suggest that the media can have a positive influence on influenza dynamics; more media coverage leads to a reduced peak size and final epidemic size of influenza."
https://openalex.org/W3035702099,"The NAC gene family is one of the important plant-specific transcription factor families involved in variety of physiological processes. It has been found in several plant species; however, little is known about the gene family in ginseng, Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer. Here we report identification and systematic analysis of this gene family in ginseng. A total of 89 NAC genes, designated PgNAC01 to PgNAC89, are identified. These genes are alternatively spliced into 251 transcripts at fruiting stage of a four-year-old ginseng plant. The genes of this gene family have five conserved motifs and are clustered into 11 subfamilies, all of which are shared with the genes of the NAC gene families identified in the dicot and monocot model plant species, Arabidopsis and rice. This result indicates that the PgNAC gene family is an ancient and evolutionarily inactive gene family. Gene ontology (GO) analysis shows that the functions of the PgNAC gene family have been substantially differentiated; nevertheless, over 86% the PgNAC transcripts remain functionally correlated. Finally, five of the PgNAC genes, PgNAC05-2, PgNAC41-2, PgNAC48, PgNAC56-1, and PgNAC59, are identified to be involved in plant response to cold stress, suggesting that this gene family plays roles in response to cold stress in ginseng. These results, therefore, provide new insights into functional differentiation and evolution of a gene family in plants and gene resources necessary to comprehensively determine the functions of the PgNAC gene family in response to cold and other abiotic stresses in ginseng."
https://openalex.org/W3033490175,"Mast cells (MCs) are the initial responders of innate immunity and their degranulation contribute to various etiologies. While the abundance of MCs in the choroid implies their fundamental importance in the eye, little is known about the significance of MCs and their degranulation in choroid. The cause of geographic atrophy (GA), a progressive dry form of age-related macular degeneration is elusive and there is currently no therapy for this blinding disorder. Here we demonstrate in both human GA and a rat model for GA, that MC degranulation and MC-derived tryptase are central to disease progression. Retinal pigment epithelium degeneration followed by retinal and choroidal thinning, characteristic phenotypes of GA, were driven by continuous choroidal MC stimulation and activation in a slow release fashion in the rat. Genetic manipulation of MCs, pharmacological intervention targeting MC degranulation with ketotifen fumarate or inhibition of MC-derived tryptase with APC 366 prevented all of GA-like phenotypes following MC degranulation in the rat model. Our results demonstrate the fundamental role of choroidal MC involvement in GA disease etiology, and will provide new opportunities for understanding GA pathology and identifying novel therapies targeting MCs."
https://openalex.org/W3034390832,"The text clustering is considered as one of the most effective text document analysis methods, which is applied to cluster documents as a consequence of the expanded big data and online information. Based on the review of the related work of the text clustering algorithms, these algorithms achieved reasonable clustering results for some datasets, while they failed on a wide variety of benchmark datasets. Furthermore, the performance of these algorithms was not robust due to the inefficient balance between the exploitation and exploration capabilities of the clustering algorithm. Accordingly, this research proposes a Memetic Differential Evolution algorithm (MDETC) to solve the text clustering problem, which aims to address the effect of the hybridization between the differential evolution (DE) mutation strategy with the memetic algorithm (MA). This hybridization intends to enhance the quality of text clustering and improve the exploitation and exploration capabilities of the algorithm. Our experimental results based on six standard text clustering benchmark datasets (i.e. the Laboratory of Computational Intelligence (LABIC)) have shown that the MDETC algorithm outperformed other compared clustering algorithms based on AUC metric, F-measure, and the statistical analysis. Furthermore, the MDETC is compared with the state of art text clustering algorithms and obtained almost the best results for the standard benchmark datasets."
https://openalex.org/W3032917994,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa exhibits a high requirement for iron, which it can acquire via several mechanisms, including the acquisition and utilization of heme. The P. aeruginosa genome encodes two heme uptake systems, the heme assimilation system (Has) and the Pseudomonas heme utilization (Phu) system. Extracellular heme is sensed via the Has system, which encodes an extracytoplasmic function (ECF) σ factor system. Previous studies have shown that the transfer of heme from the extracellular hemophore HasAp to the outer membrane receptor HasR is required for activation of the σ factor HasI and upregulation of has operon expression. Here, employing site-directed mutagenesis, allelic exchange, quantitative PCR analyses, immunoblotting, and 13C-heme uptake experiments, we delineated the differential contributions of the extracellular FRAP/PNPNL loop residue His-624 in HasR and of His-221 in its N-terminal plug domain required for heme capture to heme transport and signaling, respectively. Specifically, we show that substitution of the N-terminal plug His-221 disrupts both signaling and transport, leading to dysregulation of both the Has and Phu uptake systems. Our results are consistent with a model wherein heme release from HasAp to the N-terminal plug of HasR is required to initiate signaling, whereas His-624 is required for simultaneously closing off the heme transport channel from the extracellular medium and triggering heme transport.

Iron is an essential micronutrient that is required for the survival and virulence of almost all bacterial pathogens.

The P. aeruginosa Has system senses heme through the interaction of a secreted extracellular hemophore, HasAp, which scavenges and releases heme to the outer membrane receptor HasR (Fig. 1A). Capture of the heme by the N-terminal plug domain of HasR results in inactivation of the anti-σ factor HasS and release of the σ factor HasI. HasI then binds to the hasR promoter, recruits the core RNA polymerase, and upregulates transcription of the has operon (Fig. 1A). Simultaneously, heme released to HasR is transported through the receptor by the TonB-dependent coupling of the proton-motive force of the cytoplasmic membrane. The Has system does not encode a periplasmic transport system, so heme is sequestered and translocated to the cytoplasm by the PhuT-PhuUV periplasmic ATP-dependent binding cassette (ABC) transport system (Fig. 1A). Within the cytoplasm, heme is trafficked to the iron-dependent heme oxygenase (HemO) by the cytoplasmic heme-binding protein PhuS. HemO catalyzes the oxidative cleavage of heme to release CO, iron, and the heme metabolites biliverdin IXβ (BVIXβ) and IXδ (BVIXδ) (18Ratliff M. Zhu W. Deshmukh R. Wilks A. Stojiljkovic I.

We have further shown the P. aeruginosa Has and Phu systems have nonredundant roles, where the Has system is primarily required for sensing, whereas the Phu system is the major transporter (9Smith A.D. Wilks A. Differential contributions of the outer membrane receptors PhuR and HasR to heme acquisition in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.J. Biol.

The significance of heme sensing and uptake to P. aeruginosa pathogenesis is evident in the fact that clinical isolates from patients with chronic lung infection adapt to utilize heme while decreasing their ability to biosynthesize pyoverdine (21Nguyen A.T. O'Neill M.J. Watts A.M. Robson C.L. Lamont I.L. Wilks A. Oglesby-Sherrouse A.G. Adaptation of iron homeostasis pathways by a Pseudomonas aeruginosa pyoverdine mutant in the cystic fibrosis lung.J. Bacteriol. 2014; 196 (24727222): 2265-227610.1128/JB.01491-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In an attempt to dissect the mechanism of heme signaling and transport by the P. aeruginosa Has system, we have employed site-directed mutagenesis, allelic exchange, quantitative PCR (qPCR), immunoblotting, and 13C-heme uptake studies to determine the contributions of the heme coordinating ligands of HasR (Fig. 1). Previous studies employing similar approaches with variants of the extracellular hemophore HasAp showed heme release to HasR is required to activate the cell surface signaling cascade (20Dent A.T. Mourino S. Huang W. Wilks A. Post-transcriptional regulation of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa heme assimilation system (Has) fine-tunes extracellular heme sensing.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294 (30593511): 2771-278510.1074/jbc.RA118.006185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The P. aeruginosa HasR protein has significant sequence identity (50%) to that of S. marcescens. The S. marcescens HasAs-HasR structure revealed His-603 of the FRAP/PNPNL loop (so called for the conserved amino acid motifs in the heme receptors) and His-189 of the N-terminal plug as the heme coordinating residues of HasR (Fig. 1B). Following heme release and dissociation of HasAp, heme coordination through His-603 was proposed to close off the extracellular milieu from the HasR heme transport channel. Despite structural determination of the HasAs-HasR complex, the molecular mechanism of heme signaling and transport has remained elusive. Here, we show the corresponding FRAP/PNPNL loop residue in P. aeruginosa HasAp His-624 is required for heme transport (Fig. 1B). In contrast, the N-terminal plug His-221 is critical for both heme signaling and transport. Based on the HasAs-HasR structure, Ile-671, located on extracellular loop L8, was proposed to prevent heme backsliding to HasAp. We further show that the corresponding Ile-694 in P. aeruginosa HasR is also essential for heme transport (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, heme bound to HasAp is not accessible to the Phu system, as shown by the significant growth defect in the transport-deficient HasR mutants when supplemented with holo-HasAp rather than heme. Interestingly, the N-terminal plug hasRH221R strain, which is unable to either activate the CSS cascade or transport heme, revealed a global dysregulation in both the Has and Phu system, indicating a direct or indirect link between the ECF σ factor HasI and the Phu heme uptake system. The expression profiles of the hasR allelic strains were first analyzed under iron-depleted conditions. The hasR variant strains all show a growth profile similar to that of PAO1 WT (Fig. 2A). For the hasR loop mutant strains, the hasR mRNA levels at each time point were all within 2-fold of the parent PAO1 strain, with negligible differences in protein expression (Fig. 3, A and B, and Fig. S1A). The data confirm the HasR loop variants are folded and stable. Similarly, the hasAp mRNA and protein levels for the hasR loop variants were very similar to those in the PAO1 WT strain (Fig. 3, C and D, and Fig. S1B). In contrast to the hasR loop variants, the N-terminal plug hasRH221R strain showed a significant increase in HasR protein at the later time points (Fig. 3B and Fig. S1A). To confirm that the expression of the Phu system was not compromised in the hasR variant strains, we analyzed the mRNA and protein levels by qPCR and Western blotting, respectively. The loop hasRH624A, H624Y, and I694G variants showed mRNA and protein profiles similar to that of the PAO1 WT strain (Fig. 4). Interestingly, the relative mRNA levels of phuR in the hasRH221R strain revealed a significant increase over the PAO1 WT (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, this increase in relative mRNA levels translated to protein expression (Fig. 4B). Overall, the data suggest that the hasRH221R variant, even under low-iron conditions, has a phenotype distinct from that of the hasR loop variants.Figure 3Relative HasR and HasAp mRNA and protein levels for the hasR allelic strains under iron-depleted conditions.

All of the mutant strains were competent to utilize free heme as an iron source compared with the growth rates in iron-depleted media (Fig. 2A). However, when heme was supplied in the form of holo-HasAp, a significant inhibition in growth was observed for all of the variant strains compared with that of PAO1 WT (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that heme, but not heme complexed to HasAp, is accessible to the hasR variant strains via the Phu heme uptake system. qPCR analysis of phuR on heme supplementation showed that the relative mRNA levels of the hasR loop variants are similar to that of PAO1 WT at all time points (Fig. S2). However, the relative mRNA levels in the hasRH221R variant are 10-fold higher than those of PAO1 at all time points, consistent with the profile under iron-depleted conditions. The PhuR protein levels for PAO1 WT and all of the hasR variant strains follow a similar profile, where the protein is induced at 2 h, followed by a decrease at 4 h and a subsequent increase again at 6 h. This pattern of expression we interpret as a shock response on the addition of free heme, as we do not observe this effect when heme is complexed to HasAp. However, despite statistically significant differences in protein expression levels, as determined by Western blotting, it is clear that all of the hasR variant strains express PhuR protein within 2-fold of the level observed for PAO1 WT (Fig. S2, B and C). The ability of the hasR variant strains to utilize heme but not holo-HasAp was confirmed by isotopically labeled 13C-heme uptake and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) experiments. Supernatants were collected 4 h following supplementation of PAO1 WT or the hasR allelic strains with either 13C-heme or 13C-heme-HasAp. The resulting BVIX metabolites were extracted and quantified by LC-MS/MS. When supplemented with 13C-heme, the hasR variant strains were all capable of taking up and degrading heme, as judged by the similar levels of 13C-BVIXβ and 13C-BVIXδ compared that of PAO1 WT (Fig. 5A). Consistent with the ability to utilize exogenously added 13C-heme, ICP-MS analysis confirmed the intracellular iron content of the hasR variant strains is similar to that of PAO1 WT (Fig. 5B). Taken together, the data suggest that in the absence of a functional Has system, free heme is readily acquired by the major transporter PhuR. In contrast, the hasR variant strains were unable to utilize the 13C-heme–HasAp complex as an iron source, as indicated by the lack of 13C-BVIXβ and BVIXδ metabolites (Fig. 6A). Concomitant with the decreased ability to utilize extracellular heme, we see a slight but significant increase in endogenously derived BVIX (12C-heme) metabolites. Such redistribution of endogenous heme iron is consistent with the lower growth rate and dysregulation of iron homeostasis (Fig. 2B). The inability to utilize heme bound to HasAp was further confirmed on measurement of the intracellular iron levels by ICP-MS (Fig. 6B). The hasR variant strains all showed decreased intracellular iron content, which is particularly noticeable for the H221R N-terminal plug mutant. Analysis of phuR mRNA levels in the hasR loop variants are within 2-fold of those for PAO1 WT (Fig. S3). Western blotting further confirmed protein levels mirror those of PAO1 (Fig. S3, B and C). However, as can be seen from the qPCR analysis, the relative mRNA levels for all time points are significantly higher for the hasRH221R plug variant (Fig. S3). This difference is not solely because of the decreased iron levels, as iron depletion is also observed for the hasR loop variants (Fig. 6B). Furthermore, we observed a similar mRNA profile for the hasR variant strains in cultures supplemented with heme, where the intracellular iron levels were identical to that of PAO1 WT (Fig. 4B). However, the increase in mRNA levels when supplemented with holo-HasAp is not reflected in significant changes in protein levels (Fig. S3). Taken together, the data clearly show heme bound to HasAp, in the absence of a functional HasR transporter, is not accessible to PhuR. This is consistent with previous studies in which we have shown the Has and Phu systems have distinct nonredundant roles in heme signaling and transport, respectively (9Smith A.D. Wilks A. Differential contributions of the outer membrane receptors PhuR and HasR to heme acquisition in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.J. Biol.

We next sought to determine the contributions of the extracellular loop and N-terminal plug residues on activation of the CSS cascade. HasI-dependent transcriptional activation of hasR and hasAp following supplementation with heme or holo-HasAp was monitored over time by qPCR analysis and Western blotting. As previously reported for supplementation of PAO1 WT with 1 μm heme, following an initial decrease in mRNA, we observed an increase in hasR mRNA levels over time as extracellular HasAp levels accumulate (Fig. 7A). The hasAp mRNA profiles mirror those of hasR; however, as previously reported, the relative mRNA levels are greater than those of hasR because of increased mRNA stability following processing of the hasRAp transcript (Fig. 7B) (20Dent A.T.

The increase in relative mRNA levels on addition of heme suggests that despite an inability to transport heme, they retain the ability to activate the CSS cascade (Fig. 7). In contrast, the hasRH221R strain showed no heme-dependent transcriptional activation of hasR and hasAp (Fig. 7). This lack of transcriptional activation is not solely the result of decreased HasAp levels in the extracellular medium, as we observed significant protein levels by Western blotting (Fig. 8). Previous studies from our laboratory have shown hasAp is subject to positive posttranscriptional regulation by the heme metabolites BVIXβ and/or BVIXδ (19Mourino S. Giardina B.J. Reyes-Caballero H. Wilks A. Metabolite-driven regulation of heme uptake by the biliverdin IXbeta/delta-selective heme oxygenase (HemO) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.J. Biol.

Therefore, the discrepancy between mRNA and protein levels can be rationalized by the fact that heme actively taken up by the Phu system is further metabolized to BVIXβ and BVIXδ. We further analyzed the transcriptional activation of the has operon on supplementation with a fixed concentration of holo-HasAp. In these studies, we utilized a previously characterized functional but truncated HasAp to distinguish, by Wes analysis, the supplemented holo-HasAp from the endogenously produced protein (19Mourino S. Giardina B.J. Reyes-Caballero H. Wilks A. Metabolite-driven regulation of heme uptake by the biliverdin IXbeta/delta-selective heme oxygenase (HemO) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.J. Biol.

In contrast to the lag on addition of heme (∼4 h; Fig. 7), addition of holo-HasAp to PAO1 immediately activates transcription from the hasR promoter (Fig. 9A). For PAO1 WT, transcriptional activation peaks at the earlier 2-h time point and is maintained over 6 h. In contrast, the hasR loop variants show decreased transcriptional activation at the early time points. The lag in transcriptional activation for the loop variants is further manifested at the protein level, where significantly higher HasR expression is observed for PAO1 WT at the earlier time points (Fig. 10A). Whereas the hasAp mRNA levels for the hasR loop variants follow a trend similar to those of hasR (Fig. 9B), we do not detect any endogenous HasAp protein (Fig. 10B). This lack of protein expression can be rationalized by the inability of the hasR loop variants to take up heme, leading to lower intracellular BVIX levels (Fig. 6A) and decreased HasAp translational efficiency. For the N-terminal plug hasRH221R strain, we observed no transcriptional activation of the hasR operon, as shown by"
https://openalex.org/W3034197892,"With the emergence of zoonoses such as Ebola, many medical educators, have recommended the need for providing Interprofessional Education (IPE) as a pedagogical tool for familiarizing medical (MD) students with the framework of One Health (OH). This is important as students need to understand, the wider impacts of animal and environmental health factors on human health. IPE initiatives which typically incorporate the principles of OH, can provide MD and veterinary (DVM) students with a greater awareness of the role that animal diseases and climate change have on global health. However, negative attitudes to IPE have been reported as a key limitation to IPE implementation. The purpose of this paper is to examine the differences in readiness for interprofessional learning of medical and other allied human health professional students, including veterinarians and students undertaking dual degrees in combination with a Master of Public Health (MPH). Reflecting on Role Theory (RT) and Social Identity Theory (SIT), the paper aims to contribute to the understanding of differences in perceptions that exist between different types of health professionals.Students at a medical University enrolled in MD, DVM, DVM MPH and MD MPH programs, were invited to complete the standardized Readiness for Interprofessional Learning Scale (RIPLS), which consists of 19 Likert scale items measuring concepts relating to teamwork, professional identity and roles and responsibilities. A total of 364 students across the four programs took part. Descriptive and inferential statistical analyses were performed to assess differences between the programmes.Results indicate that MD students score lower on the different RIPLS items compared to DVM, MD MPH and DVM MPH students. DVM and DVM MPH students are generally more positive about the need for teamwork, while MD MPH and DVM MPH students have a stronger positive identity about the need for IPE.The findings drawn from this study suggests that the MD students keep on seeing themselves as a separate group of health professionals in their own right. In order to guarantee an increased level of understanding on issues relating to the human-animal-environmental spectrum, medical curricula might benefit from the incorporation of shared learning and teamwork, as occurs within the MPH, enabling students to appreciate the value of interprofessional collaboration to their future practice. This is especially important during a time at which human-animal-environmental issues are affecting social and economic life worldwide."
https://openalex.org/W3035064241,"Background While both food insecurity and depression have been reported to be closely related to sex and marital status, the impact of sex and marital status on the prevalence of perceived depression in association with food security status has not been evaluated. Materials & methods We performed a nationwide population study using data for 19,866 adults obtained from the 2012–2015 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys. Household food insecurity status was evaluated using the 18-item Food Security Survey Module. Perceived depression was measured using one item questionnaire or the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). We cross-sectionally analyzed associations between perceived depression and variables, including socio-demographic factors and food security status. The prevalence of perceived depression was compared according to sex, marital status, and food security status. We applied survey sampling weights in all analyses. Results The overall prevalence of perceived depression was 10.5%. Prevalence rates of perceived depression in the high food security group, marginal food security group, low food security group, and very low food security group were 8.9%, 13.6%, 19.7%, and 35.0%, respectively (P < 0.001). Of total participants, 1.8% were categorized as having both perceived depression and food insecurity. After adjusting for confounding covariates, female sex (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]; 2.37), never married (aOR; 1.37), divorced/widowed/separated (aOR; 1.50), low food security (aOR; 1.72), and very low food security (aOR; 3.65) were associated with increased risk of perceived depression. Men with very low food security and divorced/widowed/separated status were most likely to have perceived depression (53.2%), followed by women with very low food security and divorced/widowed/separated status (48.7%), women with very low food security and married status (42.0%), and women with low food security and divorced/widowed/separated status (33.3%). Conclusions Female sex and marital status of divorced/widowed/separated were strongly associated with perceived depression. These two factors and food insecurity synergistically contributed to perceived depression."

It also affects pregnancy outcomes by improving the quality of health care in this period. The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate the psychometric properties of maternal health literacy inventory in pregnancy (MHELIP).This sequential, exploratory and mixed study was carried out in two parts (qualitative study and psychometric evaluation of the tool) in Tehran in 2016-18. The first part involved a qualitative content analysis with a traditional approach using in-depth, semi-structured and personal interviews with 19 eligible pregnant women. Then, the pool of items extracted from the qualitative part was completed by reviewing the existing literature and tools. In the second part, the overlapping items were summarized and the tool was validated. In order to evaluate the construct validity, a cross-sectional study was conducted with the participation of 320 pregnant women. Data analysis was performed by SPSS-19 software using exploratory factor analysis and reliability tests (Cronbach's alpha and ICC).Findings of qualitative part produced a pool of 120 items that reached to 124 items after reviewing the literature. After confirming face and content validity by calculating CVI and CVR for each item, 53 items remained in the pool. Finally, the results of exploratory factor analysis confirmed a tool with 48 items in four factors, explaining 46.49% of the variance of total variables of the tool. Reliability of the tool was approved by Cronbach's alpha = 0.94 and test-retest with 2-weeks intervals, indicating an appropriate stability for the scale (ICC = 0.96). Finally, the tool was finalized with 48 items in 4 dimensions, including ""Maternal Health Knowledge"", ""Maternal Health Information Search"", ""Maternal Health Information Assessment"" and ""Maternal Health Decision Making and Behavior"".The designed tool is a multidimensional, reliable and validated scale for assessing maternal health literacy during pregnancy. This tool can be used to evaluate different aspects of maternal health literacy in pregnant women, which was prepared based on their experiences during a qualitative study."
https://openalex.org/W3034543542,"Background Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is increasingly recognized as an important cause of illness in adults; however, data on RSV disease and economic burden in this age group remain limited. We aimed to provide comprehensive estimates of RSV disease burden among adults aged ≥18 years. Methods During 2012–2015, population-based, active surveillance of acute respiratory infection (ARI) hospitalizations enabled estimation of the seasonal incidence of RSV hospitalizations and direct health costs in adults aged ≥18 years in Auckland, New Zealand. Results Of 4,600 ARI hospitalizations tested for RSV, 348 (7.6%) were RSV positive. The median (interquartile range) length of hospital stay for RSV positive patients was 4 (2–6) days. The seasonal incidence rate (IR) of RSV hospitalizations, corrected for non-testing, was 23.6 (95% confidence intervals [CI] 21.0–26.1) per 100,000 adults aged ≥18 years. Hospitalization risk increased with age with the highest incidence among adults aged ≥80 years (IR 190.8 per 100,000, 95% CI 137.6–244.0). Being of Māori or Pacific ethnicity or living in a neighborhood with low socioeconomic status (SES) were independently associated with increased RSV hospitalization rates. We estimate RSV-associated hospitalizations among adults aged ≥18 years to cost on average NZD $4,758 per event. Conclusions RSV infection is associated with considerable disease and economic cost in adults. RSV disproportionally affects adult sub-groups defined by age, ethnicity, and neighborhood SES. An effective RSV vaccine or RSV treatment may offer benefits for older adults."
https://openalex.org/W3034310132,"Colour is an important signal that flowering plants use to attract insect pollinators like bees. Previous research in Germany has shown that nectar volume is higher for flower colours that are innately preferred by European bees, suggesting an important link between colour signals, bee preferences and floral rewards. In Australia, flower colour signals have evolved in parallel to the Northern hemisphere to enable easy discrimination and detection by the phylogenetically ancient trichromatic visual system of bees, and native Australian bees also possess similar innate colour preferences to European bees. We measured 59 spectral signatures from flowers present at two preserved native habitats in South Eastern Australia and tested whether there were any significant differences in the frequency of flowers presenting higher nectar rewards depending upon the colour category of the flower signals, as perceived by bees. We also tested if there was a significant correlation between chromatic contrast and the frequency of flowers presenting higher nectar rewards. For the entire sample, and for subsets excluding species in the Asteraceae and Orchidaceae, we found no significant difference among colour categories in the frequency of high nectar reward. This suggests that whilst such relationships between flower colour signals and nectar volume rewards have been observed at a field site in Germany, the effect is likely to be specific at a community level rather than a broad general principle that has resulted in the common signalling of bee flower colours around the world."
https://openalex.org/W3035752442,"Antibiotic exposure can lead to unintended outcomes, including drug-drug interactions, adverse drug events, and healthcare-associated infections like Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). Improving antibiotic use is critical to reduce an individual's CDI risk. Antibiotic stewardship initiatives can reduce inappropriate antibiotic prescribing (e.g., unnecessary antibiotic prescribing, inappropriate antibiotic selection), impacting both hospital (healthcare)-onset (HO)-CDI and community-associated (CA)-CDI. Previous computational and mathematical modeling studies have demonstrated a reduction in CDI incidence associated with antibiotic stewardship initiatives in hospital settings. Although the impact of antibiotic stewardship initiatives in long-term care facilities (LTCFs), including nursing homes, and in outpatient settings have been documented, the effects of specific interventions on CDI incidence are not well understood. We examined the relative effectiveness of antibiotic stewardship interventions on CDI incidence using a geospatially explicit agent-based model of a regional healthcare network in North Carolina. We simulated reductions in unnecessary antibiotic prescribing and inappropriate antibiotic selection with intervention scenarios at individual and network healthcare facilities, including short-term acute care hospitals (STACHs), nursing homes, and outpatient locations. Modeled antibiotic prescription rates were calculated using patient-level data on antibiotic length of therapy for the 10 modeled network STACHs. By simulating a 30% reduction in antibiotics prescribed across all inpatient and outpatient locations, we found the greatest reductions on network CDI incidence among tested scenarios, namely a 17% decrease in HO-CDI incidence and 7% decrease in CA-CDI. Among intervention scenarios of reducing inappropriate antibiotic selection, we found a greater impact on network CDI incidence when modeling this reduction in nursing homes alone compared to the same intervention in STACHs alone. These results support the potential importance of LTCF and outpatient antibiotic stewardship efforts on network CDI burden and add to the evidence that a coordinated approach to antibiotic stewardship across multiple facilities, including inpatient and outpatient settings, within a regional healthcare network could be an effective strategy to reduce network CDI burden."
https://openalex.org/W3033870227,"This study investigated the effects of oral administration of β-glucan 1,3 (pharmaceutical grade 10%) on growth performance and carcass traits in two breeds of weanling rabbits adapted to survive in Egypt, New Zealand White (NZW) and Animal Production Research Institute (APRI) rabbits, with special attention to relative mRNA expression of interleukins and antioxidant enzyme genes, biochemical, and histological alterations. Oral administration of β-glucan with doses 0.25 and 0.5 ml per one-liter of drinking water significantly accelerated body weight gain (BWG) in both rabbits' breeds, reduced total feed consumption (FC), and reduced feed conversion ratio (FCR), especially the 0.5 ml per one-liter dose in both rabbit breeds. There are remarkable differences in all the growth performance traits due to breed effect. The interaction effect between β-glucan and breed significantly improved BWG, FC, and FCR. There were non-significant differences in all carcass traits studied due to oral administration of β-glucan with both doses, except in dressing percentages. The highest of the dressing percentages were observed at doses 0.25 ml per one-liter (51%) and 0.5 ml per one-liter (52%) compared with control (50%). Our findings show significant variations in the final BW, total daily gain, feed consumption, and total feed conversion ratio between NZW and APRI rabbits. Absence of significant differences in the hot carcass weight and dressing percentage between the genetic groups had been reported in this study. Supplementing NZW and APRI rabbits with β-glucan increased blood total protein and globulin. The duodenal villi dimensions, splenic lymphoid diameter, muscular fiber diameter, and muscular glycogen areas were significantly increased by β-glucan administration. Expression of intestinal interleukin-18 (IL-18) in NZW rabbits treated with 0.25 and 0.5 doses of β-glucan was significantly upregulated and enhanced the immune response. β-glucan upregulated the expression of intestinal occludin mRNA particularly at dose 0.5 β-glucan as well as upregulated intestinal superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) and glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPx1), which modulates anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. In conclusion, oral administration of β-glucan at a dose of 0.25 or 0.5 ml per one-liter drinking water provided beneficial effects in the growth performance and health status of rabbits."
https://openalex.org/W3034268461,"Statistical inference in the form of hypothesis tests and confidence intervals often assumes that the underlying distribution is normal. Similarly, many signal processing techniques rely on the assumption that a stationary time series is normal. As a result, a number of tests have been proposed in the literature for detecting departures from normality. In this article we develop a novel approach to the problem of testing normality by constructing a statistical test based on the Edgeworth expansion, which approximates a probability distribution in terms of its cumulants. By modifying one term of the expansion, we define a test statistic which includes information on the first four moments. We perform a comparison of the proposed test with existing tests for normality by analyzing different platykurtic and leptokurtic distributions including generalized Gaussian, mixed Gaussian, α-stable and Student’s t distributions. We show for some considered sample sizes that the proposed test is superior in terms of power for the platykurtic distributions whereas for the leptokurtic ones it is close to the best tests like those of D’Agostino-Pearson, Jarque-Bera and Shapiro-Wilk. Finally, we study two real data examples which illustrate the efficacy of the proposed test."
https://openalex.org/W3035106966,"Objectives Larval indices have been used for Ae. albopictus surveillance for many years, while there is limited use in assessing dengue transmission risk and adult mosquito emergence. This study is aimed to explore the relationships between larval indices and the Ae. albopictus density captured by BG-mosquito trap (BG-trap) method, with considering the meteorological factors. Methods Data on larval density, adult mosquito density and meteorology factors were collected in an entomological survey carried out in Quzhou City, Zhejiang Province of China in 2018. The Spearman’s rank correlation and Pearson correlation were used for the analysis on the correlation of density indices. Generalized additive models were established to analyze the influencing factors of mosquito density. Results Breteau index (BI), House index (HI) and Container index (CI) were highly correlated with each other (r>0.7, p<0.05). The Ae. albopictus density was significantly correlated with CI (rs = 0.260, p<0.05), CI pre one week (rs = 0.259, p<0.05), and CI pre three weeks (rs = 0.329, p<0.05). BI was correlated with female Ae. albopictus density pre 4 weeks (r = -0.299, p<0.05). Female Ae. albopictus density was correlated with CI pre 3 weeks (rs = 0.303, p<0.05). The influencing factors of BI were average wind speed pre 1 week, average temperature and female Ae. albopictus density pre 4 weeks. The influencing factors of CI were average humidity pre 3 weeks and average temperature. The influencing factors of HI were average temperature and precipitation pre 4 weeks. The influencing factor of Ae. albopictus density and female Ae. albopictus density was temperature. Conclusions The adult Ae. albopictus density had low correlation with certain larval indices. Some of the meteorology factors played significant roles in the density of adult Ae. albopictus and larva with or without a time lag."
https://openalex.org/W3035241525,"High grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) is the most common and deadly type of ovarian cancer, largely due to difficulties in early diagnosis and rapid metastasis throughout the peritoneal cavity. Previous studies have shown that expression of Notch3 correlates with worse prognosis and increased tumorigenic cell behaviors in HGSC. We investigated the mechanistic role of Notch3 in a model of metastatic ovarian cancer using the murine ovarian surface epithelial cell line, ID8 IP2. Notch3 was activated in ID8 IP2 cells via expression of the Notch3 intracellular domain (Notch3IC). Notch3IC ID8 IP2 cells injected intraperitoneally caused accelerated ascites and reduced survival compared to control ID8 IP2, particularly in early stages of disease. We interrogated downstream targets of Notch3IC in ID8 IP2 cells by RNA sequencing and found significant induction of genes that encode adhesion and extracellular matrix proteins. Notch3IC ID8 IP2 showed increased expression of ITGA1 mRNA and cell-surface protein. Notch3IC-mediated increase of ITGA1 was also seen in two human ovarian cancer cells. Notch3IC ID8 IP2 cells showed increased adhesion to collagens I and IV in vitro. We propose that Notch3 activation in ovarian cancer cells causes increased adherence to collagen-rich peritoneal surfaces. Thus, the correlation between increased Notch3 signaling and poor prognosis may be influenced by increased metastasis of HGSC via increased adherence of disseminating cells to new metastatic sites in the peritoneum."
https://openalex.org/W3035253817,"Background Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is one of the leading causes of healthcare utilisation and death worldwide. Treatment according to evidence-based clinical guidelines can reduce mortality, antibiotic exposure and length of hospital stay related to CAP. Local problem Several studies, including a pilot study from one of our sites, indicate that physicians show a low grade of guideline adherence when managing patients with CAP. Methods To improve the guideline-based treatment of patients with CAP admitted to hospital, we designed a quality improvement study. Four process indicators were combined in a CAP care bundle: chest X-ray, CURB-65 severity score, lower respiratory tract samples and antibiotics within 8 hours from admission. After a 4-month baseline period, we applied multiple interventions at three hospitals during 8 months. Progression in our process indicators was measured continuously and compared with a control site without interventions. After the 8-month intervention period, we continued with a 4-month follow-up period to assess the sustainability of the improvements. Results The care bundle utilisation rate within 8 hours increased from 11% at baseline to 41% in the follow-up period at the intervention sites, whereas it remained below 3% at the control site. The most considerable improvements have been observed regarding documentation of CURB-65 (34% at baseline, 68% at follow-up) and the collection of lower respiratory tract samples (43% at baseline, 63% at follow-up). Conclusion Our study has demonstrated poor adherence to CAP guidelines at all sites at baseline. After implementing multiple tailored interventions, guideline adherence increased substantially. In conclusion, we recommend that CAP guidelines should be actively adapted in order to be followed in a daily routine."
https://openalex.org/W3035102193,"Christmas and New Year's holidays are risk factors for hospitalization, but the causes of this ""holiday effect"" are uncertain. In particular, clinical complexity (CC) has never been assessed in this setting. We therefore sought to determine whether patients admitted to the hospital during the December holiday period had greater CC compared to those admitted during a contiguous non-holiday period.This is a prospective, longitudinal study conducted in an academic ward of internal medicine in 2017-2019. Overall, 227 consecutive adult patients were enrolled, including 106 cases (mean age 79.4±12.8 years, 55 females; 15 December-15 January) and 121 controls (mean age 74.3±16.6 years, 56 females; 16 January-16 February). Demographic characteristics, CC, length of stay, and early mortality rate were assessed. Logistic regression analyses for the evaluation of independent correlates of being a holiday case were computed.Cases displayed greater CC (17.7±5.5 vs 15.2±5.9; p = 0.001), with greater impact of socioeconomic (3.51±1.7 vs 2.9±1.7; p = 0.012) and behavioral (2.36±1.6 vs 1.9±1.8; p = 0.01) CC components. Cases were also significantly frailer according to the Edmonton Frail Scale (8.0±2.8 vs 6.4±3.1; p<0.001), whilst having similar disease burden, as measured by the CIRS comorbidity index. Age (OR 1.02; p = 0.039), low income (OR 1.97, 95% CI 1.10-3.55; p = 0.023), and total CC (OR 1.06; p = 0.014) independently correlated with the cases. Also, cases showed a longer length of stay (median 15.5 vs 11 days; p = 0.0016) and higher in-hospital (12 vs 4 events; p = 0.021) and 30-day (14 vs 6 events; p = 0.035) mortality.Patients hospitalized during the December holiday period had worse health outcomes, and this could be attributable to the grater CC, especially related to socioeconomic (social deprivation, low income) and behavioral factors (inappropriate diet). The evaluation of all CC components could potentially represent a useful tool for a more rational resource allocation over this time of the year."
https://openalex.org/W3034291127,"Creating a secure and comfortable linkage between the residual limb and prosthetic socket in persons with lower limb amputation is a critical factor for successful rehabilitation, including ambulation and other activities of daily living. Unwanted rotation within the socket can be a clinical problem for prosthesis users. One way of addressing issues experienced with transverse plane control of the socket may be through increased friction interface forces. It has been proposed that friction at the residual limb/socket interface may be increased by adding texture to interface components. Three-dimensional (3D) printing may be used to fabricate sockets with texture patterns added to the inner socket surface. Hence, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of socket texturing on transverse plane rotation of the socket on a mock residual limb under two suspension conditions: passive suction and active vacuum. To conduct this study, we developed a mechanical testing protocol as no standardized tests currently exist to assess prosthetic sockets. Sockets with 14 different texture patterns were fabricated using the Squirt-Shape™ 3D printer. Textured sockets were compared to an Original Squirt-Shape (OSS) socket and a smooth thermoformed socket. Sockets were fitted with a mock residual limb and bi-axially loaded to 350 N compression with simultaneous rotation (2.5°, 5° and 7.5°) using a custom rotation assembly attached to a uniaxial hydraulic material testing system. There was a statistically significant three-way interaction between suspension, angle and texture (p < 0.0005). Torques between textured and reference sockets, for all rotation angles and both suspension conditions, were significantly different (p < 0.0005). Using newly developed testing protocols, it was demonstrated that some texture patterns significantly increased torque (i.e., resistance against unwanted rotation) in the transverse plane compared to both OSS and smooth sockets, especially for passive suction. Rotation testing of sockets may provide insight into socket design to improve suspension in the transverse plane."
https://openalex.org/W3034971489,"Gene Ontology is used extensively in scientific knowledgebases and repositories to organize a wealth of biological information. However, interpreting annotations derived from differential gene lists is often difficult without manually sorting into higher-order categories. To address these issues, we present GOcats, a novel tool that organizes the Gene Ontology (GO) into subgraphs representing user-defined concepts, while ensuring that all appropriate relations are congruent with respect to scoping semantics. We tested GOcats performance using subcellular location categories to mine annotations from GO-utilizing knowledgebases and evaluated their accuracy against immunohistochemistry datasets in the Human Protein Atlas (HPA). In comparison to term categorizations generated from UniProt’s controlled vocabulary and from GO slims via OWLTools’ Map2Slim, GOcats outperformed these methods in its ability to mimic human-categorized GO term sets. Unlike the other methods, GOcats relies only on an input of basic keywords from the user (e.g. biologist), not a manually compiled or static set of top-level GO terms. Additionally, by identifying and properly defining relations with respect to semantic scope, GOcats can utilize the traditionally problematic relation, has_part, without encountering erroneous term mapping. We applied GOcats in the comparison of HPA-sourced knowledgebase annotations to experimentally-derived annotations provided by HPA directly. During the comparison, GOcats improved correspondence between the annotation sources by adjusting semantic granularity. GOcats enables the creation of custom, GO slim-like filters to map fine-grained gene annotations from gene annotation files to general subcellular compartments without needing to hand-select a set of GO terms for categorization. Moreover, GOcats can customize the level of semantic specificity for annotation categories. Furthermore, GOcats enables a safe and more comprehensive semantic scoping utilization of go-core, allowing for a more complete utilization of information available in GO. Together, these improvements can impact a variety of GO knowledgebase data mining use-cases as well as knowledgebase curation and quality control."
https://openalex.org/W2948377558,"A number of instruments for identifying mental health problems in children are available, but there is limited knowledge about how to successfully implement their use in routine practice. The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) is an instrument with sound psychometric properties. Because using multi-informant SDQs when assessing young children has been emphasized, parent- and preschool teacher reports on the SDQ were introduced at Child Health Clinics in a Swedish municipality. This paper aimed to describe a facilitation programme developed to support the introduction of SDQ in clinical practice and evaluate how nurses perceived the facilitation strategies used. Moreover, the dose (delivery) and reach (response rate and population coverage) of the questionnaires were assessed.The mixed-methods process evaluation was guided by Moore et al.'s framework. Process data were excerpted from monitoring data, the trial database, research group documents, study materials, group interviews with nurses, and a survey on nurses' opinions and experiences of the screening method and the implementation process. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and qualitative content analysis.Facilitation strategies used included: educational meetings, educational outreach visits, newsletters, facilitative administrative support, and adaptations made in procedures and materials when required. Although nurses described a variety of barriers at the organisational and individual level, they were in favour of using the SDQ in clinical practice and emphasised the importance of the facilitation strategies used for its implementation. While dose levels (77-91%) indicated that nurses essentially delivered the intervention as intended, parental response rates remained between 54 and 63% and population coverage at around 50%, throughout the intervention period.The facilitation program was perceived to support the implementation of the SDQ at the yearly check-ups in the child healthcare setting, but further efforts are required to reach all families."
https://openalex.org/W3033486467,"This study evaluated the impact of combined exercise training on the development of cardiovascular and neuroimmune complications induced by fructose consumption (10% in the drinking water) in hypertensive rats (SHR). After weaning, SHR were divided into 3 groups: SHR (H), SHR+fructose (HF) and SHR+fructose+combined exercise training (treadmill+ladder, 40-60% of maximum capacity) (HFTC). Metabolic, hemodynamic, autonomic, inflammatory and oxidative stress parameters were evaluated in the subgroups (n = 6 group/time) at 7, 15, 30 and 60 days of protocol. Fructose consumption (H vs. HF groups) decreased spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity and total variance of pulse interval at day 7 (7 to 60); increased IL-6 and TNFα in the heart (at day 15, 30 and 60) and NADPH oxidase activity and cardiac lipoperoxidation (LPO) (day 60); increased white adipose tissue weight, reduced insulin sensitivity and increased triglycerides (day 60); induced an additional increase in mean arterial pressure (MAP) (days 30 and 60). Combined exercise training prevented such dysfunctions and sustained increased cardiac IL-10 (day 7) and glutathione redox balance (GSH/GSSG) for the entire protocol. In conclusion, combined exercise training performed simultaneously with exacerbated fructose consumption prevented early cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction, probably trigging positive changes in inflammation and oxidative stress, resulting in a better cardiometabolic profile in rats genetically predisposed to hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W3033647887,"Octopus laqueus is a small tropical octopus found in Okinawa, Japan and the greater Indo-Pacific. Octopus are often viewed as solitary animals but O. laqueus live in close proximity in the wild, and will potentially encounter one another on a regular basis, raising the possibility of social tolerance. Adopting shared den occupancy in aquaria as a potential measure of social tolerance in O. laqueus, we studied the animals’ preference for shared dens over solitude. We characterized dependence of sharing preference on sex, den availability and den occupancy density. We designed two simple social tolerance assays in aquaria with a total of 45 daily measurements: (i) Pots Equal, with equal numbers of octopuses and dens and (ii) Pots Limited, with a 3:1 ratio of octopuses to dens. We found that O. laqueus will socially tolerate other individuals by sharing tanks and dens and with typically no loss to cannibalism or escape. However, animals also exhibit significant levels of social repulsion, and individuals often chose a solitary den when given the option. The patterns of den occupancy are observed to be consistent with a maximum entropy model that balances seeking shelter against avoiding other animals. The model accurately captures and predicts the data and can be generalized to other organisms and their social interactions. Overall, in O. laqueus the preference for a den is stronger than the preference to be solitary. The animals are tolerant of others with a mixture of sizes in the tank and even in a den, a reported first for octopuses outside mating. The relaxed disposition and social tolerance of O. laqueus make it a promising species to work with in the lab to explore social and potentially other behaviors in octopuses."
https://openalex.org/W3033806850,"Background Patients with diabetes mellitus are at an increased risk for adverse clinical events following percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI). However, the clinical impact of diabetes mellitus (DM) on second-generation drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation is not well-known. The aim of the current analysis was to examine the clinical impact of DM on clinical outcomes and the time sequence of associated risks in patients treated with second-generation DES. Methods Using patient-level data from two stent-specific, all-comer, prospective DES registries, we evaluated 1,913 patients who underwent PCI with second-generation DES between Feb 2009 and Dec 2013. The primary outcomes assessed were two-year major cardiac adverse events (MACE), composite endpoints of death from any cause, myocardial infarction (MI), and any repeat revascularization. We classified 0–1 year as the early period and 1–2 years as the late period. Landmark analyses were performed according to diabetes mellitus status. Results There were 1,913 patients with 2,614 lesions included in the pooled dataset. The median duration of clinical follow-up in the overall population was 2.0 years (interquartile range 1.9–2.1). Patients with DM had more cardiovascular risk factors than patients without DM. In multivariate analyses, the presence of DM and renal failure were strong predictors of MACE and target-vessel revascularization (TVR). After inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) analyses, patients with DM had significantly increased rates of 2-year MACE (HR 2.07, 95% CI; 1.50–2.86; P <0.001). In landmark analyses, patients with DM had significantly higher rates of MACE in the early period (0–1 year) (HR 3.04, 95% CI; 1.97–4.68; P < 0.001) after IPTW adjustment, but these findings or trends were not observed in the late period (1–2 year) (HR 1.24, 95% CI; 0.74–2.07; P = 0.41). Conclusions In the second-generation DES era, the clinical impact of DM significantly increased the 2-year event rate of MACE, mainly caused by clinical events in the early period (0–1 year). Careful observation of patients with DM is advised in the early period following PCI with second-generation DES."
https://openalex.org/W3035742543,"Approximately 20% of breast cancers are HER2-positive. Trastuzumab has improved patient outcomes significantly for these cancers. However, acquired resistance remains a major hurdle in the clinical management of these patients. Therefore, identifying molecular changes that cause trastuzumab resistance is worthwhile. STAT6 is a transcription factor that regulates a variety of genes involved in cell cycle regulation, growth inhibition, and apoptosis. STAT6 expression is lost in approximately 3% of breast cancers, but little work has been done in the context of trastuzumab resistance in breast cancer. In isogenic cell line pairs, we observed that trastuzumab-resistant cells expressed significantly lower levels of STAT6 compared to trastuzumab-sensitive cells. Therefore, in order to study the consequences of STAT6 loss in HER2+ breast cancer, we knocked out both alleles of the STAT6 gene using somatic cell gene targeting. Interestingly, loss of STAT6 resulted in anchorage-independent growth and changes in several genes involved in epithelial to mesenchymal transition. This study suggests that STAT6 may play a role in the pathophysiology of HER2+ human breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3033812503,"Objective To evaluate the change of the risk of bias (RoB) of acupuncture randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in the past five decades. Methods Multiple databases were searched. We included RCTs identified from systematic reviews (SRs) on acupuncture. General characteristics and RoB judgment for each domain were extracted. The proportions of RCTs at high and unclear RoB were calculated and the changes were examined by the Mann-Kendall test. Results We included 368 SRs including 4 715 RCTs. The rates of RCTs at unclear RoB were the highest in allocation concealment (63%), and at the lowest in incomplete outcome data (35%); in the last five decades, statistically significant reductions were found for random sequence generation (P < 0.001) and selective reporting (P = 0.01), and increases for blinding of participants and personnel (P < 0.001), blinding of outcome assessment (P < 0.001) and incomplete outcome data (P = 0.04). For the proportions of RCTs at high RoB, blinding of participants and personnel (47%) and blinding of outcome assessment (35%) were the poorest domains; there were no significant differences in changes for all domains. Conclusions Although improvements concerning unclear risk were observed for random sequence generation and selective reporting, major issues remain for allocation concealment and blinding. It is imperative to use valid randomization, specify how it is conducted, and try to test for selection bias and the success of masking by using the Berger Exner test."
https://openalex.org/W3035637771,"To overcome organ shortage, expanded criteria donors, including elderly deceased donors (DDs), should be considered. We analyzed outcomes of kidney transplantation (KT) from elderly DDs in a nationwide study. In total, data of 1049 KTs from DDs using the database of Korean Organ Transplantation Registry (KOTRY) were retrospectively analyzed based on the age of DDs: age ≥60 years vs. <60 years. Clinical information, graft status, and adverse events were reviewed in DDs and recipients. The mean age of the 1006 DDs was 51.04±10.54 years, and 21.5% of donors were aged ≥60 years. Elderly DDs had a significantly higher prevalence of diabetes and hypertension and higher Kidney Donor Risk Index (KDRI) and Kidney Donor Profile Index (KDPI). The mean age of the recipients was 47.45±14.87 years. Patients who received KT from elderly DDs were significantly older (53.12±15.14 vs. 45.88±14.41, P<0.001) and had a higher rate of diabetes (41.9 vs. 24.4%, P<0.001). Graft outcomes were not significantly different. Renal function was similar between the groups at the time of discharge and at 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years after KT. The rate of delayed graft function (DGF) was not significantly different. Risk factors of DGF were significantly different in DDs aged ≥60 years and <60 years. In the multivariable model, male sex (odds ratio: 3.99, 95% confidence interval: 1.42–11.22; P = 0.009) and KDRI (12.17, 2.23–66.34; P = 0.004) were significant risk factors for DGF in DDs aged ≥60 years. In DDs aged <60 years, thymoglobulin induction (2.62, 1.53–4.48; P<0.001) and continuous renal replacement therapy (3.47, 1.52–7.96; P = 0.003) were significant factors. Our data indicated that graft outcomes, including renal function and DGF, were similar for elderly DDs and DDs aged <60 years. Elderly DDs might be considered tolerable donors for KT, with active preoperative surveillance."

https://openalex.org/W3033512944,"Three-dimensional polydimethylsiloxane platforms were developed to mimic the extracellular matrix with blood vessels by having scaffolds with micropatterns, porous membrane and trenches. Precisely controlled physical dimensions, layouts, and topography as well as different surface chemical treatments were applied to study their influences on nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell (10–15 μm in diameter) migration in mimicked platforms over 15-hour of time-lapse imaging. By placing the pores at different distance from the edges of the trenches, pores with different trench sidewall exposures and effective sizes were generated. Pores right next to the trench sidewalls showed the highest cell traversing probability, most likely related to the larger surface contact area with cells along the sidewalls. Straight grating oriented perpendicular to trenches below the top layer increased cell traversing probability. Pore shape as well as pore size influenced the cell traversing probability and cells could not traverse through pores that were 6 μm or less in diameter, which is much smaller than the cell size. Trench depth of 15 μm could induce more cells to traverse through the porous membrane, while shallower trenches impeded cell traversing and longer time was needed for cells to traverse because 3 and 6 μm deep trenches were much smaller than cell size which required large cell deformation. Hydrophobic surface coating on the top layer and fibronectin in pores and trenches increased the cell traversing probability and reduced the pore size that cells could traverse from 8 to 6 μm, which indicated that cells could have larger deformation with certain surface coatings."
https://openalex.org/W3033117041,"Climate change, nutrition, poverty and medical drugs are widely discussed and pressing issues in science, policy and society. Despite these issues being of great importance for the quality of our lives it remains unclear how well people understand them. Specifically, do particular demographic and socioeconomic factors explain variation in public understanding of these four concepts? To what extent are people’s changes in understanding associated with changes in their behaviour? Do people judge scientific practices relying on the more descriptive concepts of climate change and effective medical drugs to be more objective (less controversial) than practices relying on the more value-laden concepts of poverty and healthy nutrition? To address these questions, an experimental survey and regression analyses are conducted using data collected from about one thousand participants across different continents. The study finds that public understanding of science is generally low. A smaller proportion of people were able to correctly identify the common explanation accepted internationally among the scientific community for climate change and effectiveness of medical drugs (42% and 43% of participants in the study, respectively) than for poverty and healthy nutrition (61% and 65% of participants, respectively). Older age and political non-conservativeness were the strongest predictors of correctly understanding these four concepts. Greater levels of education and political non-conservativeness were in turn the strongest predictors of people’s reported changes in their behaviour based on their improved understanding of these concepts. Because climate change is among the least understood scientific concepts but is arguably the greatest challenge of our time, better efforts are needed to improve how media, awareness campaigns and education systems mediate information on the topic in order to tackle the large knowledge deficits that constrain behavioural change."
https://openalex.org/W3033524291,"Objectives To examine the effect of weekend admission on short and long-term morbidity and mortality, for patients admitted to intensive care after suffering a cerebrovascular accident (stroke). Design, setting, and participants A hospital-wide, retrospective cohort study of 3,729 adult stroke patients admitted to the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Centre (BIDMC) intensive care unit (ICU) between 2001 and 2012, using the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database. Primary outcome measures Primary outcome measures were ICU length-of-stay and mortality, hospital length-of-stay and mortality, proportions of patients discharged home after admission, and 6-month mortality. Results Overall, 23% of BIDMC ICU stroke admissions occurred over the weekend. Those admitted over the weekend were likelier to have suffered haemorrhagic stroke than those admitted during the week (60.6% vs 47.9%). Those admitted on the weekend were younger, and likelier to be male and unmarried, with similar ethnic representation. The OASIS severity of illness (32.5 vs. 32) and lowest day-one GCS (12.6 vs. 12.9) were similar between groups. Unadjusted ICU-mortality was significantly higher for patients admitted over the weekend (OR 1.32, CI 1.08–1.61), but when adjusted for type of stroke, became non-significant (OR 1.17, CI 0.95–1.44). In-hospital mortality was significantly higher for patients admitted to ICU over the weekend in both unadjusted (OR 1.45, CI 1.22–1.73) and adjusted (OR 1.31, CI 1.09–1.58) analyses. There was no significant difference in ICU or hospital length of stay. While patients admitted on the weekend appeared less likely to be discharged back to home and more at risk of 6-month mortality compared to weekday admissions, results were non-significant. Conclusions The effect of weekend ICU-admission for stroke patients appears to be significant for in-hospital mortality. There were no significant differences in adjusted ICU-mortality, ICU or hospital length-of-stay, or longer-term morbidity and mortality measures."
https://openalex.org/W3033733091,"Abdominal spacers are useful for maintaining the distance between the target tumors and surrounding tissues, such as the gastrointestinal tract, in patients treated with carbon ion radiotherapy. Surgical intervention to remove the spacers is sometimes necessary because of abdominal infections triggered by long-term spacer placement or intestinal perforation. Therefore, spacers that do not require surgical removal and provide effective drainage against abdominal infections are urgently needed. This study aimed to develop a spacer that could be removed non-surgically and one that provides the therapeutic effect of drainage in patients who receive carbon ion radiotherapy for abdominal tumors. A novel fan-shaped spacer was constructed from a film drain that was folded along the trigger line. Simple withdrawal of the trigger line caused the film drain to fold and the holding lines to become free. We performed laparoscopy-assisted insertion with pneumoperitoneum and blind removal of the spacer fourteen times using a porcine model. Saline in the abdominal cavity was effectively aspirated using the spacer. Our novel fan-shaped spacer could be removed safely without surgery and was able to drain fluid effectively from the abdominal cavity."

However, missing data is a common problem in data analysis. Although several scholars have developed techniques to conduct DEA with missing data, these techniques have some disadvantages. A multi-criteria evaluation approach is proposed to measure the efficiency of decision making units (DMUs) with missing data. In this approach, analysts first estimate the upper and lower bounds of DMUs' efficiency using the proposed I-addIDEA-U models (interval additive integer-valued DEA models with undesirable outputs) that can be applied to address integer-valued variables and undesirable outputs. Then, DMUs' ""relative"" efficiency is evaluated using the proposed ""Halo + Hot deck"" DEA method (if there is no correlation between variables) or regression DEA techniques (if there is a correlation between variables). Finally, the multi-index comprehensive evaluation method is applied to determine which scenario (the lower bound of efficiency, the ""relative"" efficiency, or the upper bound of efficiency) should be selected. With a case study, it is shown that the proposed multi-criteria evaluation approach is more effective than traditional approaches such as the mean imputation DEA method, the deletion DEA method, and the dummy entries DEA method."
https://openalex.org/W3034294162,"Having secrets is incredibly common. However, secrecy has only recently started to receive more attention in research. What has largely been neglected so far are the consequences of secret-sharing for the relationship between sharer and receiver. In this project, we aim to fill this gap. Previous research has shown that closeness can make secret-sharing more likely. Building on research from the self-disclosure and relationship literature, we experimentally investigate whether secret-sharing might in turn increase perceptions of closeness. In addition, we test the valence of the secrets shared as potential driver of the hypothesized effect, as negative secrets might signal a high level of trust, but might also present a burden to the receiver. To provide a holistic picture, we build on a variety of methods to investigate three perspectives: Study 1 focuses on the receiver and tests whether another person sharing secrets (vs. nonconfidential information) decreases distance in the eyes of the receiver. Study 2 investigates lay theories and tests how an observer perceives the relationship between two people who share secrets (vs. nonconfidential information). Study 3 tests whether these lay theories about sharing secrets are predictive of behavior, and how a sharer might choose secrets of negative or positive valence to decrease perceived distance on the receiver's side. Our results will contribute to the understanding of how sharing secrets affects the way individuals think about each other, how close they feel to each other, and how they interact with each other."
https://openalex.org/W3034533703,"The goal of the study was to assess whether tonic immobility (TI)-induced stress reactions in laying hens can be reduced by probiotic supplementation and if the changes in body surface temperature, as a stress indicator, are genetically dependent and can be detected using infrared thermography (IRT). Seventy-one white and 70 brown hens were used. Hens were randomly assigned to three treatments at 1-day-old: beak trimmed and fed a regular diet; non-beak trimmed and fed a regular diet; and non-beak trimmed and fed a diet supplemented with probiotics, Bacillus subtilis. At 40 weeks of age, hens were tested for TI reactions. Eye and face temperatures were measured with IRT immediately before and after TI testing. Results revealed that the probiotic supplementation did not affect hens' stress responses to TI testing; the left and right eye temperatures increased by 0.26s°C and 0.15°C, respectively, while right face temperature tended to increase following TI testing. However, the right eye (32.60°C for white, and 32.35°C for brown) and face (39.51°C for white, and 39.36°C for brown) temperatures differed significantly among genetic lines. There was a positive correlation between TI duration and the changes of the left and right eye temperatures after TI testing in white hens. Based on these results, hens experienced TI-induced surface temperature changes that were detectable using IRT. White hens experienced greater stress reactions in response to TI than brown hens. However, supplementation with Bacillus subtilis did not attenuate hens' reaction to TI testing."
https://openalex.org/W3034311794,"This article employs computer-assisted methods to analyse references to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people(s) and issues in a newspaper corpus about diabetes. The objectives are to identify both the frequency and quality of social representation. The dataset consisted of 694 items from 12 Australian newspapers in a five-year period (2013–2017). The quantitative analysis focused on frequency (raw/normalised) and range (number/percentage of texts). The qualitative analysis focused on the identification of semantic prosody (co-occurrence with negative/positive words and phrases) and on selective social actor analysis. The qualitative analysis also compared choices made by the press to language practices recommended in relevant reporting guidelines. Key results include that references to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people(s) or matters appear to be extremely rare. In addition, newspapers’ language choices only partially align with guidelines. References that do occur can be classified into four categories: a) references to [groups of] people and other references to identity; b) names of services, institutions, professions, roles etc; c) non-human nouns related to health; d) non-human nouns related to culture. Qualitative analysis of the word COMMUNITY suggests that newspapers for the most part do recognise the existence of different communities at a national level. However, analysis of all references to [groups of] people shows that the vast majority occur in contexts to do with negativity, therefore having a negative semantic prosody. More specifically, there is a strong association with mentions of a higher risk, likelihood, or incidence of having or developing diabetes (or complications/effects). In sum, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people(s) and issues lack in visibility in Australian diabetes coverage, and are associated with deficit framing, which can be disempowering. To change the discourse would require both an increased visibility as well as changing the deficit lens."

Accurate prediction of exam volumes, workflow surges and, most notably, patient delay and wait times are known to have significant impact on quality of care and patient satisfaction. The main objective of this work was to investigate the choice of different operational features to achieve (1) more accurate and concise process models and (2) more effective interventions. To exclude process modelling bias, data from four different workflows was considered, including a mix of walk-in, scheduled, and hybrid facilities. A total of 84 features were computed, based on previous literature and our independent work, all derivable from a typical Hospital Information System. The features were categorized by five subgroups: congestion, customer, resource, task and time features. Two models were used in the feature selection process: linear regression and random forest. Independent of workflow and the model used for selection, it was determined that congestion feature sets lead to models most predictive for operational processes, with a smaller number of predictors."
https://openalex.org/W3035309778,"Background The first case of HIV infection in Sri Lanka was reported in 1987 and at the end of 2018 there were 3500 people living with HIV. There have been commendable efforts made towards the detection, treatment, and prevention of HIV in the country. Even though the genetic diversity of HIV has been shown to affect the parameters ranging from detection to vaccine development, there is no data available with respect to the molecular epidemiology of HIV-1 in Sri Lanka. Methods In this report we have performed the ancillary analysis of pol gene region sequences (n = 85) obtained primarily for the purpose of HIV-1 drug resistance genotyping. Briefly, dried blood spot specimens (DBS) collected from HIV-1 infected individuals between December 2015 and August 2018 were subjected to pol gene amplification and sequencing. These pol gene sequences were used to interpret the drug resistance mutation profiles. Further, sequences were subjected to HIV-1 subtyping using REGA 3.0, COMET, jPHMM and, RIP online subtyping tools. Moreover, Bayesian phylogenetic analysis was employed to estimate the evolutionary history of HIV-1 subtype C in Sri Lanka. Results Our analysis revealed that the majority (51.8%) of pol gene sequences were subtype C. Other than subtype C, there were sequences categorized as subtypes A1, B, D and G. In addition to pure subtypes there were sequences which were observed to be circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) and a few of the recombinants were identified as potential unique recombinants (URFs). We also observed the presence of drug resistance mutations in 56 (65.9%) out of 85 sequences. Estimates of the Bayesian evolutionary analysis suggested that the HIV-1 subtype C was introduced to Sri Lanka during the early 1970s (1972.8). Conclusion The findings presented here indicate the presence of multiple HIV-1 subtypes and the prevalence of drug resistance mutations in Sri Lanka. The majority of the sequences were subtype C, having their most recent common ancestor traced back to the early 1970s. Continuous molecular surveillance of HIV-1 molecular epidemiology will be crucial to keep track of drug resistance, genetic diversity, and evolutionary history of HIV-1 in Sri Lanka."
https://openalex.org/W3035639728,"Hummingbirds are essential pollinators in many ecosystems, making their conservation critical. As is the case with many species, hummingbirds are now facing a variety of challenges resulting from anthropogenic changes. As populations shift and species interactions change, disease is likely to pose a significant threat. There is a basic understanding of which pathogens currently affect a variety of hummingbird species, however there is a paucity of information about their immune systems capacity to kill pathogens and what specific factors may affect immunity. The objective of this study was to gain a basic understanding of the effect of age, sex, and molt on the constitutive innate immunity of hummingbirds. An in vitro assay was used to assess the microbiocidal capacity of the whole blood of Anna’s Hummingbirds (Calypte anna) against three different microbes: Escherichia coli (E. coli), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Candida albicans (C. albicans). The effect of age, sex and molt on anti-microbial capacity varied based on the microbe type. After-hatch-year birds tended to have better anti-microbial capacity compared to hatch-year birds. Male birds had higher anti-microbial activity than female birds, although this was not observed against C. albicans. Molting birds had a weaker antimicrobial activity against E. coli and S. aureus than birds that were not molting. These results represent an important first step towards defining the parameters of constitutive innate immunity of Anna’s Hummingbirds as well as providing important knowledge about factors that should be considered when evaluating the health of wild populations."
https://openalex.org/W3035659384,"Social cognition is dependent on the ability to extract information from human stimuli. Of those, patterns of biological motion (BM) and in particular walking patterns of other humans, are prime examples. Although most often tested in isolation, BM outside the laboratory is often associated with multisensory cues (i.e. we often hear and see someone walking) and there is evidence that vision-based judgments of BM stimuli are systematically influenced by motor signals. Furthermore, cross-modal visuo-tactile mechanisms have been shown to influence perception of bodily stimuli. Based on these observations, we here investigated if somatosensory inputs would affect visual BM perception. In two experiments, we asked healthy participants to perform a speed discrimination task on two point light walkers (PLW) presented one after the other. In the first experiment, we quantified somatosensory-visual interactions by presenting PLW together with tactile stimuli either on the participants’ forearms or feet soles. In the second experiment, we assessed the specificity of these interactions by presenting tactile stimuli either synchronously or asynchronously with upright or inverted PLW. Our results confirm that somatosensory input in the form of tactile foot stimulation influences visual BM perception. When presented with a seen walker’s footsteps, additional tactile cues enhanced sensitivity on a speed discrimination task, but only if the tactile stimuli were presented on the relevant body-part (under the feet) and when the tactile stimuli were presented synchronously with the seen footsteps of the PLW, whether upright or inverted. Based on these findings we discuss potential mechanisms of somatosensory-visual interactions in BM perception."
