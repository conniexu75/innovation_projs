We investigate permeation through micrometer-thick laminates prepared by means of vacuum filtration of graphene oxide suspensions. The laminates are vacuum-tight in the dry state but, if immersed in water, act as molecular sieves, blocking all solutes with hydrated radii larger than 4.5 angstroms. Smaller ions permeate through the membranes at rates thousands of times faster than what is expected for simple diffusion. We believe that this behavior is caused by a network of nanocapillaries that open up in the hydrated state and accept only species that fit in. The anomalously fast permeation is attributed to a capillary-like high pressure acting on ions inside graphene capillaries."
https://openalex.org/W1966549856,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common form of liver disease. To elucidate the molecular basis of NAFLD, we performed an exome-wide association study of liver fat content. Three variants were associated with higher liver fat levels at the exome-wide significance level of 3.6 × 10(-7): two in PNPLA3, an established locus for NAFLD, and one (encoding p.Glu167Lys) in TM6SF2, a gene of unknown function. The TM6SF2 variant encoding p.Glu167Lys was also associated with higher circulating levels of alanine transaminase, a marker of liver injury, and with lower levels of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), triglycerides and alkaline phosphatase in 3 independent populations (n > 80,000). When recombinant protein was expressed in cultured hepatocytes, 50% less Glu167Lys TM6SF2 protein was produced relative to wild-type TM6SF2. Adeno-associated virus-mediated short hairpin RNA knockdown of Tm6sf2 in mice increased liver triglyceride content by threefold and decreased very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion by 50%. Taken together, these data indicate that TM6SF2 activity is required for normal VLDL secretion and that impaired TM6SF2 function causally contributes to NAFLD."
https://openalex.org/W2147733682,"Zook et al. describe methods for integrating genome variants from five sequencing technologies to characterize the first benchmark sample that can be used to understand accuracy of human whole-genome and targeted sequencing. Clinical adoption of human genome sequencing requires methods that output genotypes with known accuracy at millions or billions of positions across a genome. Because of substantial discordance among calls made by existing sequencing methods and algorithms, there is a need for a highly accurate set of genotypes across a genome that can be used as a benchmark. Here we present methods to make high-confidence, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), indel and homozygous reference genotype calls for NA12878, the pilot genome for the Genome in a Bottle Consortium. We minimize bias toward any method by integrating and arbitrating between 14 data sets from five sequencing technologies, seven read mappers and three variant callers. We identify regions for which no confident genotype call could be made, and classify them into different categories based on reasons for uncertainty. Our genotype calls are publicly available on the Genome Comparison and Analytic Testing website to enable real-time benchmarking of any method."
https://openalex.org/W2167028666,"An amphiphile vaccine consisting of a peptide antigen or adjuvant cargo linked to a lipophilic tail is shown to have improved potency and safety in mice by targeting the lymph nodes. Vaccines based on purified peptides, proteins or polysaccharides, together with molecular adjuvants designed to boost the immune response, are potentially safer and easier to manufacture than the alternatives. Generally however, such 'subunit' vaccines elicit weaker immune responses than those using live attenuated pathogens. Darrell Irvine and colleagues demonstrate a simple chemical strategy for the molecular targeting of subunit vaccines to lymphoid organs following parenteral injection. They designed an amphiphilic vaccine consisting of a peptide antigen or adjuvant cargo linked to a lipophilic tail. The resulting CpG-DNA/peptide amph-vaccine showed substantially increased anti-tumour efficacy with reduced toxicity compared to the parent compounds. In cancer patients, visual identification of sentinel lymph nodes (LNs) is achieved by the injection of dyes that bind avidly to endogenous albumin, targeting these compounds to LNs, where they are efficiently filtered by resident phagocytes1,2. Here we translate this ‘albumin hitchhiking’ approach to molecular vaccines, through the synthesis of amphiphiles (amph-vaccines) comprising an antigen or adjuvant cargo linked to a lipophilic albumin-binding tail by a solubility-promoting polar polymer chain. Administration of structurally optimized CpG-DNA/peptide amph-vaccines in mice resulted in marked increases in LN accumulation and decreased systemic dissemination relative to their parent compounds, leading to 30-fold increases in T-cell priming and enhanced anti-tumour efficacy while greatly reducing systemic toxicity. Amph-vaccines provide a simple, broadly applicable strategy to simultaneously increase the potency and safety of subunit vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W2018546748,"Natural gas (NG) is a potential “bridge fuel” during transition to a decarbonized energy system: It emits less carbon dioxide during combustion than other fossil fuels and can be used in many industries. However, because of the high global warming potential of methane (CH4, the major component of NG), climate benefits from NG use depend on system leakage rates. Some recent estimates of leakage have challenged the benefits of switching from coal to NG, a large near-term greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction opportunity (1–3). Also, global atmospheric CH4 concentrations are on the rise, with the causes still poorly understood (4)."
https://openalex.org/W1967646152,"Cognitive function is tightly related to metabolic state, but the locus of this control is not well understood. Synapses are thought to present large ATP demands; however, it is unclear how fuel availability and electrical activity impact synaptic ATP levels and how ATP availability controls synaptic function. We developed a quantitative genetically encoded optical reporter of presynaptic ATP, Syn-ATP, and find that electrical activity imposes large metabolic demands that are met via activity-driven control of both glycolysis and mitochondrial function. We discovered that the primary source of activity-driven metabolic demand is the synaptic vesicle cycle. In metabolically intact synapses, activity-driven ATP synthesis is well matched to the energetic needs of synaptic function, which, at steady state, results in ∼10(6) free ATPs per nerve terminal. Despite this large reservoir of ATP, we find that several key aspects of presynaptic function are severely impaired following even brief interruptions in activity-stimulated ATP synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2138514622,"The elderly often suffer from progressive muscle weakness and regenerative failure. We demonstrate that muscle regeneration is impaired with aging owing in part to a cell-autonomous functional decline in skeletal muscle stem cells (MuSCs). Two-thirds of MuSCs from aged mice are intrinsically defective relative to MuSCs from young mice, with reduced capacity to repair myofibers and repopulate the stem cell reservoir in vivo following transplantation. This deficiency is correlated with a higher incidence of cells that express senescence markers and is due to elevated activity of the p38α and p38β mitogen-activated kinase pathway. We show that these limitations cannot be overcome by transplantation into the microenvironment of young recipient muscles. In contrast, subjecting the MuSC population from aged mice to transient inhibition of p38α and p38β in conjunction with culture on soft hydrogel substrates rapidly expands the residual functional MuSC population from aged mice, rejuvenating its potential for regeneration and serial transplantation as well as strengthening of damaged muscles of aged mice. These findings reveal a synergy between biophysical and biochemical cues that provides a paradigm for a localized autologous muscle stem cell therapy for the elderly."
https://openalex.org/W1997488333,"Complex systems are characterized by many independent components whose low-level actions produce collective high-level results. Predicting high-level results given low-level rules is a key open challenge; the inverse problem, finding low-level rules that give specific outcomes, is in general still less understood. We present a multi-agent construction system inspired by mound-building termites, solving such an inverse problem. A user specifies a desired structure, and the system automatically generates low-level rules for independent climbing robots that guarantee production of that structure. Robots use only local sensing and coordinate their activity via the shared environment. We demonstrate the approach via a physical realization with three autonomous climbing robots limited to onboard sensing. This work advances the aim of engineering complex systems that achieve specific human-designed goals."
https://openalex.org/W2047023360,"Global temperature increases affect the water cycle over land, but the nature of these changes remains difficult to predict. A key conceptual problem is to distinguish between droughts, which are transient regional extreme phenomena typically defined as departures from a local climatological norm that is presumed known, and the normal or background dryness itself. This background dryness depends on precipitation, but also on how fast water would evaporate. As the planet warms, global average rainfall increases, but so does evaporation. What is the likely net impact on average aridity?"
https://openalex.org/W2059165104,"Skeletal muscle aging results in a gradual loss of skeletal muscle mass, skeletal muscle function and regenerative capacity, which can lead to sarcopenia and increased mortality. Although the mechanisms underlying sarcopenia remain unclear, the skeletal muscle stem cell, or satellite cell, is required for muscle regeneration. Therefore, identification of signaling pathways affecting satellite cell function during aging may provide insights into therapeutic targets for combating sarcopenia. Here, we show that a cell-autonomous loss in self-renewal occurs via alterations in fibroblast growth factor receptor-1, p38α and p38β mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling in satellite cells from aged mice. We further demonstrate that pharmacological manipulation of these pathways can ameliorate age-associated self-renewal defects. Thus, our data highlight an age-associated deregulation of a satellite cell homeostatic network and reveal potential therapeutic opportunities for the treatment of progressive muscle wasting."
https://openalex.org/W2042423362,"Long-term in vivo imaging of Confetti-labelled Lgr5-expressing intestinal stem cells shows that a dynamically heterogeneous cell population is able to function long-term as an equipotent stem-cell pool. Inducible genetic labelling studies have previously shown that maintenance of the intestinal epithelium relies upon neutral competition between dividing stem cells. Jacco van Rheenen and colleagues used long-term in vivo imaging of Lgr5-expressing intestinal stem cells and confetti double-labelled intestinal crypt cells to achieve the first real-time observation of intestinal crypt stem cells undergoing proliferation, clonal expansion and neutral drift. Using this approach, the authors found that a dynamically heterogeneous cell population is able to function long-term as a single-stem-cell pool. The rapid turnover of the mammalian intestinal epithelium is supported by stem cells located around the base of the crypt1. In addition to the Lgr5 marker, intestinal stem cells have been associated with other markers that are expressed heterogeneously within the crypt base region1,2,3,4,5,6. Previous quantitative clonal fate analyses have led to the proposal that homeostasis occurs as the consequence of neutral competition between dividing stem cells7,8,9. However, the short-term behaviour of individual Lgr5+ cells positioned at different locations within the crypt base compartment has not been resolved. Here we establish the short-term dynamics of intestinal stem cells using the novel approach of continuous intravital imaging of Lgr5-Confetti mice. We find that Lgr5+ cells in the upper part of the niche (termed ‘border cells’) can be passively displaced into the transit-amplifying domain, after the division of proximate cells, implying that the determination of stem-cell fate can be uncoupled from division. Through quantitative analysis of individual clonal lineages, we show that stem cells at the crypt base, termed ‘central cells’, experience a survival advantage over border stem cells. However, through the transfer of stem cells between the border and central regions, all Lgr5+ cells are endowed with long-term self-renewal potential. These findings establish a novel paradigm for stem-cell maintenance in which a dynamically heterogeneous cell population is able to function long term as a single stem-cell pool."

All tissues of the body originate from the pluripotent epiblast (EPI), a ball of cells positioned in the inner cell mass (ICM) of the blastocyst, whose identity is established during the first 4 days of development. During this time, the fertilized egg undergoes cleavage divisions that progressively generate three cell types. A first wave of asymmetric division at the 8–16 cell transition separates outside cells, precursors of the extra-embryonic tophectoderm (TE), from inside cells destined to be predominantly EPI (Krupa et al., 2014Krupa M. Mazur E. Szczepańska K. Filimonow K. Maleszewski M. Suwińska A.

Asymmetric divisions in the next cleavage rounds generate inside cells predominantly destined to become another extra-embryonic tissue, primitive endoderm (PE). When the blastocyst cavity forms, the EPI and PE are initially mixed (Chazaud et al., 2006Chazaud C. Yamanaka Y. Pawson T. Rossant J.

Distinct sequential cell behaviours direct primitive endoderm formation in the mouse blastocyst.Development. 2008; 135: 3081-3091Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). The mature blastocyst is then ready to implant, and after hatching out of zona pellucida, it adheres to the uterine wall, allowing the TE to invade. This induces decidualization of the uterine stroma, burying the embryo within the maternal tissues (Dey et al., 2004Dey S.K. Lim H. Das S.K. Reese J. Paria B.C. Daikoku T. Wang H. Molecular cues to implantation.Endocr. Rev. 2004; 25: 341-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). Cell proliferation and morphogenesis are initiated as the embryo implants to increase the size and to shape the tissues of the fetus. The pre- to postimplantation transition is critical because the ensuing morphogenesis lays the foundation for the developing body to ensure developmental success. This transformation is dynamic, associated with intensive growth, and changes in the shape and topology of tissues. As a result, the initially amorphous EPI transforms into a polarized cup-shaped epithelium positioned at the distal part of the conceptus. The TE-derived extra-embryonic ectoderm (ExE) becomes positioned at the proximal part. Both EPI and ExE tissues become enveloped by PE-derived visceral endoderm (VE). The ExE and the VE will provide support for the growth of the EPI and signals for the emergence of the body plan (Tam and Loebel, 2007Tam P.P. Loebel D.A. Gene function in mouse embryogenesis: get set for gastrulation.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2007; 8: 368-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). In contrast to our broader understanding of the stream of events before implantation, the transition from the blastocyst into an elongated cup-like structure, the egg cylinder, remains largely unknown. This is because this morphogenesis takes place as the embryo implants and, consequently, becomes inaccessible for direct viewing and manipulations. Here, we wished to uncover the hidden sequence of events that transforms the EPI of the blastocyst into a polarized columnar epithelium within which the proamniotic cavity emerges to establish the tube of the egg cylinder. Tubes are common units of various organs that permit a variety of functions, including gas, fluid, and ion exchange. Tubes can be formed from polarized epithelium through the wrapping of epithelial sheets, as during neural tube formation (Colas and Schoenwolf, 2001Colas J.F. Schoenwolf G.C. Towards a cellular and molecular understanding of neurulation.Dev. Dyn. 2001; 221: 117-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), or can be extended by budding from pre-existing tubes or sheets, as during embryonic kidney development (Hogan and Kolodziej, 2002Hogan B.L. Kolodziej P.A. Organogenesis: molecular mechanisms of tubulogenesis.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 513-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Depending on the dynamics of polarization, groups of cells can use two mechanisms to establish the lumen of the tube de novo: either through hollowing or by cavitation (Lubarsky and Krasnow, 2003Lubarsky B. Krasnow M.A. Tube morphogenesis: making and shaping biological tubes.Cell. 2003; 112: 19-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Hollowing, for example in the Caenorhabditis elegans gut formation, requires that cells become uniformly polarized to generate a lumen following the separation of their apical membranes (Leung et al., 1999Leung B. Hermann G.J. Priess J.R. Organogenesis of the Caenorhabditis elegans intestine.Dev. Biol. 1999; 216: 114-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The cavitation of embryoid bodies (EBs) formed from aggregates of ES cells or embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells is mediated by apoptosis and has become the textbook model for formation of the proamniotic cavity of the egg cylinder in the development of the mouse embryo (Coucouvanis and Martin, 1995Coucouvanis E. Martin G.R. Signals for death and survival: a two-step mechanism for cavitation in the vertebrate embryo.Cell. 1995; 83: 279-287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, Wolpert, 2011Wolpert L. Principles of Development. Oxford University Press, New York2011Google Scholar). In this model, it is proposed that shortly after implantation, at embryonic day 5 (E5.0), the EPI is a solid bud surrounded by the PE-derived VE. The VE is proposed to be the source of a signal for programmed cell death in the EPI. A second signal for survival is proposed to be provided only to cells in direct contact with the surrounding basal membrane. As a result, the EPI cells in the core would undergo apoptosis to make space for the proamniotic cavity, whereas the cells contacting the basal membrane differentiate into a polarized epithelium. Thus, in the current model, it is programmed cell death that initiates the morphogenesis of the embryo at implantation stages. While EBs present a valuable model system that recapitulates many events in the formation of the embryonic tissues, they comprise many more cells and clearly lack the organization of the blastocyst with its three distinct cell types. We therefore sought to determine the morphogenetic steps of the pre- to postimplantation EPI transition in a system more akin to the development of the embryo. To achieve this, we turned to our recently established in vitro culture (IVC) system that permits the visualization of development of the EPI and its surrounding tissues through the implantation stages (Morris et al., 2012aMorris S.A. Grewal S. Barrios F. Patankar S.N. Strauss B. Buttery L. Alexander M. Shakesheff K.M. Zernicka-Goetz M. Dynamics of anterior-posterior axis formation in the developing mouse embryo.Nat. Commun. 2012; 3: 673Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The results that we present here, which are supported by a parallel analysis of embryos recovered from the mother, are strikingly different from the current concept of the pre- to postimplantation morphogenetic events. We show that the VE is not a source of apoptotic signal and that cell death is not required for the formation of the proamniotic cavity and therefore emergence of the egg cylinder. Instead, we find that, in embryos developing both in vivo and in vitro, the EPI becomes organized into a rosette-like structure of highly polarized cells and a central lumen is then formed through hollowing of their apical membranes. This is orchestrated by polarization cues from the basal membrane transmitted through β1-integrin receptors. Finally, we show that the individual or small groups of ES cells can be induced to undertake a similar process of self-organization into rosettes following their in vitro culture suspended in gels of extracellular matrix proteins. Together, our findings have uncovered a previously hidden sequence of morphogenic events and lead us to propose a complete revision of the model for the blastocyst to egg cylinder transition. The current model of the peri-implantation morphogenesis proposes that the hollow tube of the egg cylinder is formed as a consequence of apoptosis in the core of the EPI (Coucouvanis and Martin, 1995Coucouvanis E. Martin G.R. Signals for death and survival: a two-step mechanism for cavitation in the vertebrate embryo.Cell. 1995; 83: 279-287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, Wolpert, 2011Wolpert L. Principles of Development. Oxford University Press, New York2011Google Scholar). This model originally arose following observations of programmed cell death of the inner cells of EBs, leading to cavity formation. The finding that only a minority of embryos recovered from mothers at E5.0–E5.5 had apoptotic cells in the nascent cavity was then suggested to be the result of the rapid elimination of dying cells by efferocytosis (Coucouvanis and Martin, 1995Coucouvanis E. Martin G.R. Signals for death and survival: a two-step mechanism for cavitation in the vertebrate embryo.Cell. 1995; 83: 279-287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, Vandivier et al., 2006Vandivier R.W.

Burying the dead: the impact of failed apoptotic cell removal (efferocytosis) on chronic inflammatory lung disease.Chest. 2006; 129: 1673-1682Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it could be that, although cell death is important to form cavities in EBs, it might be less so in the developing embryo. To address this required examining apoptosis in embryos as the cavity is in the process of being formed. This required a better way of modeling the time course of peri-implantation development to guide us to examine specific events in implanting embryos recovered from mothers representative of particular time frames. To this end, we turned to an in vitro culture (IVC) system that we have recently shown can capture the dynamics of embryo development through the peri-implantation stages (Morris et al., 2012aMorris S.A. Grewal S. Barrios F. Patankar S.N. Strauss B. Buttery L. Alexander M. Shakesheff K.M. Zernicka-Goetz M. Dynamics of anterior-posterior axis formation in the developing mouse embryo.Nat. Commun. 2012; 3: 673Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We modified this system to enable the development of zona-freed blastocysts seeded directly onto ibiTreat microscopy-grade plastic microplates in order to facilitate time-lapse observations of development. Blastocysts were plated in the previously described medium (IVC1) (Morris et al., 2012aMorris S.A. Grewal S. Barrios F. Patankar S.N. Strauss B. Buttery L. Alexander M. Shakesheff K.M. Zernicka-Goetz M. Dynamics of anterior-posterior axis formation in the developing mouse embryo.Nat. Commun. 2012; 3: 673Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), but once they had attached, we changed to a modified medium (IVC2) in which we substituted human cord serum with KnockOut Serum Replacement (KSR; GIBCO) and also added β-estradiol, progesterone, N-acetyl-L-cysteine, and ITS-X (Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium-Ethanolamine) as supplements (see Experimental Procedures). Embryos developed in this modified system with comparable efficiencies to our earlier study (Morris et al., 2012aMorris S.A. Grewal S. Barrios F. Patankar S.N. Strauss B. Buttery L. Alexander M. Shakesheff K.M. Zernicka-Goetz M. Dynamics of anterior-posterior axis formation in the developing mouse embryo.Nat. Commun. 2012; 3: 673Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), but their development was more easily recorded by confocal microscopy, as they were grown on optical-grade plastic. Filming of blastocyst development showed that TE cells first spread over the culture surface, whereupon the EPI then began to proliferate, and morphogenesis of the egg cylinder was successfully initiated in a manner similar to that we previously described (Morris et al., 2012aMorris S.A. Grewal S. Barrios F. Patankar S.N. Strauss B. Buttery L. Alexander M. Shakesheff K.M. Zernicka-Goetz M. Dynamics of anterior-posterior axis formation in the developing mouse embryo.Nat. Commun. 2012; 3: 673Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Thus, this culture system provided us with an experimental model in which we could directly determine the earliest morphogenetic events of egg cylinder formation that was far more akin to embryonic development in vivo than the model offered by EBs. We then used confocal time-lapse microscopy to record directly the morphogenesis of cultured embryos as they transit from the blastocyst into egg cylinder. To visualize dying cells, we cultured embryos derived from a transgenic line expressing a membrane-associated red fluorescent marker (Muzumdar et al., 2007Muzumdar M.D. Tasic B. Miyamichi K. Li L. Luo L. A global double-fluorescent Cre reporter mouse.Genesis. 2007; 45: 593-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (2258) Google Scholar) in the presence of SYTOX, a green fluorescent reporter of cell death (Life Technologies). We observed SYTOX-positive cells in different areas as the egg cylinder first emerged and then elongated, but they were never concentrated at the site of the nascent proamniotic cavity (Figures 1A and S1A and Movies S1 and S2). In order to check whether this is also the case when embryos develop in vivo, within the mother, we isolated embryos at successive implantation stages and examined the distribution of apoptotic cells through two different methods: cleaved caspase-3 and TUNEL assays. We found that embryos recovered from mothers at E5.0–E5.5 had apoptotic cells that were distributed in all lineages and not exclusively at the center of the EPI. Moreover, we could find no evidence of apoptotic cells in a large number of morphologically normal embryos (Figures 1B, 1C, S1B, and S1D).Figure S1Cell Death during the Peri-Implantation Stages of Development, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Still images of time-lapse recording of emerging egg-cylinder in vitro.

To functionally test whether apoptosis is required for the formation of the proamniotic cavity, we examined the development of p53-deficient embryos in which there is no p53-dependent apoptosis (Donehower, 1996Donehower L.A. The p53-deficient mouse: a model for basic and applied cancer studies.Semin. Cancer Biol. 1996; 7: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). We derived embryos from p53 heterozygous intercrosses and examined them for cleaved caspase-3-positive cells. Whereas there were variable numbers of apoptotic cells in wild-type and heterozygous embryos, such cells were completely absent from homozygous mutant p53 embryos (Figure 1D). In spite of this, the homozygous p53 mutants were morphologically indistinguishable from their wild-type and heterozygous littermates (Figures 1D and 1E). Thus, the apoptotic pathway that can be alleviated by absence of p53 appears not to be important for the morphogenesis of the egg cylinder. Because the finding that a p53 null background has no consequence for cavitation does not categorically rule out the involvement of cell death mediated by other pathways, we carried out further test of a requirement for apoptosis at this developmental stage by allowing wild-type embryos to develop in vitro in the presence of caspase-3 inhibitor. These embryos formed proamniotic cavities similar to DMSO-treated controls (Figure S1C). Thus, whether we prevent apoptosis as a result of the p53 mutation or by pharmacological treatment, the egg cylinder forms normally, strongly suggesting that cell death is not required for this process. This supports the finding of no association of cell death with the region of cavity formation. We therefore conclude that, in contrast to the current model and to what has been found in EBs, apoptosis is not essential for the formation of the proamniotic cavity, suggesting that an alternative mechanism drives morphogenesis at this stage. To understand exactly how the egg cylinder forms, we first focused upon the organization of the EPI at the onset of implantation. Using embryos derived from the CAG-GFP line that exhibits expression of GFP in the membrane (Rhee et al., 2006Rhee J.M. Pirity M.K. Lackan C.S. Long J.Z. Kondoh G. Takeda J. Hadjantonakis A.K. In vivo imaging and differential localization of lipid-modified GFP-variant fusions in embryonic stem cells and mice.Genesis. 2006; 44: 202-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), we found that, before implantation (E4.0–E4.5), the EPI comprised round-shaped cells. As the embryo proceeded through the implantation (late E4.5–E4.75 to E4.75–E5.0), these EPI cells became wedge shaped, with their thinner parts clustering to give a rosette-like structure (Figure 2A). In embryos that have developed and hatched in utero, rosettes first appear at the late E4.5 blastocyst stage. The proportion of rosette-containing embryos then steadily increases over the next 24 hf of peri-implantation development (Figures 2B, S2A, and S2B). Such rosettes also developed in the EPI of CAG-GFP embryos cultured in vitro (Figures 2A, 2C, and 2D). As the embryo transformed into an egg cylinder, we observed a single cavity emerging at the center of the rosette (Figure 2C and Movie S3). This contrasts to the multiple cavities that appear initially at the periphery and never at the center of EBs (Coucouvanis and Martin, 1995Coucouvanis E. Martin G.R. Signals for death and survival: a two-step mechanism for cavitation in the vertebrate embryo.Cell. 1995; 83: 279-287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Importantly, we found that embryos that failed to rearrange their EPI cells into this characteristic rosette structure remained disorganized and failed to form proper egg cylinders (Figures 2D and 2E). These results indicate that the first major morphogenetic step in the transition of the EPI from pre- to postimplantation stages is its progressive reorganization from a relatively simple ball of cells to a more complex rosette-like structure that is built of polarized cells. Our results suggest that this structure is a prerequisite for proper embryonic development and acts as the foundation and organizing center of the nascent egg cylinder.Figure S2EPI Organizes as a Rosette in Peri-Implantation Embryos with Blastocyst Morphology, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A and B) Optical Z-section series of immunofluorescence confocal images of late E4.5 (A) and E4.75 embryos (B).

Nanog or Oct4 positive EPI cells (white) are organized as a rosette (yellow lined panels). F-actin is labeled by phalloidin (red), the nuclei are counterstained with DAPI (blue). Scale bars = 10 μm. Prior to implantation, the EPI comprises nonpolarized cells that become polarized during egg cylinder formation. Understanding of precisely when epithelial polarity is established in the EPI has been elusive. To address this, we followed the establishment of the apical domain marked by aPKC during epithelialization of the EPI. Expression of aPKC was not detectable in the EPI cells prior to implantation (E4.5). Then, as embryonic development progressed into the peri-implantation stages, aPKC began to accumulate centrally in the EPI together with F-actin (Figure 3A, yellow arrow). Par6 staining also confirmed that cells were becoming polarized at this stage (Figures S3A and S3B). At this time, the EPI cells rearranged into rosettes, with their apical domains clustered toward the center (Figure 3A, yellow arrowhead). As this is happening, embryos still retain blastocyst morphology and all cell lineages are polarized. Thus, the apical domains of the TE and PE face the “outside” environment and the blastocyst cavity, respectively (Figure 3A, white arrows). The apical domains of EPI cells lay within the body of the EPI, and in some cases, it was possible to detect a small lumenal space between the apical membranes. This appeared to be the precursor of the larger proamniotic cavity of later stages (Figure 3A, yellow arrowhead).Figure S3Polarization of the EPI during the Peri-Implantation Stages of Development, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A and B) (A) Par6 staining (green) reveals the establishment of the apical domain in EPI cells of the late E4.5 embryo, prior to lumen formation at E5.5 (B); EPI is labeled by Oct4 (white), phalloidin (red), nuclei are counterstained with DAPI.

Scale bars = 10 μm. We noted that the formation of the earliest polarized rosettes in late E4.5 embryos marked the onset of proliferation of the EPI. These early rosettes were built of an average of 12–13 cells (Figure S2). The cell number doubled around E4.75 and again around E5.0 (Figure 3B). Thus, cell number steadily increases as the embryonic development progresses through the peri-implantation stages marking the onset of cell proliferation and growth that follows the cleavage divisions of pre-implantation development. To examine whether the shape change required for rosette formation was a consequence of specific cytoskeletal events, we examined the distribution of the phosphorylated myosin II regulatory chain. We found that myosin II regulatory chain was phosphorylated at the apical tip of the cells, where it colocalized with F-actin (Figure 3C, arrow). This would suggest that myosin II motors crosslink the actin filaments and generate contractile forces at this site. However, contractility of the actomyosin network can only affect cell shape if it is mechanically linked to the cell surface (Martin, 2010Martin A.C. Pulsation and stabilization: contractile forces that underlie morphogenesis.Dev. Biol. 2010; 341: 114-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). This link is achieved in epithelial cells primarily by adherens junctions, where the cadherin-catenin complex is bound to the actin cytoskeleton. Thus, we examined the distribution of E-cadherin (E-cad), the only classical cadherin that is expressed in the EPI before gastrulation (Stemmler, 2008Stemmler M.P. Cadherins in development and cancer.Mol. Biosyst. 2008; 4: 835-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). We found that, whereas in pre-implantation embryos E-cad is ubiquitously distributed on the cell membrane (Figure 3D, arrow), in implanting embryos, E-cad and F-actin were localized on the apical site of the wedge-shaped cells (Figure 3D, arrowheads). Together, these results suggest that the changes in cell shape associated with EPI polarization are mediated by actomyosin-mediated constriction coupled to apical localization of the adherens junctions. The trafficking of newly synthesized proteins from the trans-Golgi network is also essential for cell polarization, and consequently polarized epithelia show a subapical localization of Golgi apparatus and basal localization of the nucleus (Bryant and Mostov, 2008Bryant D.M. Mostov K.E. From cells to organs: building polarized tissue.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 887-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). In accord with this, we found that, whereas in pre-implantation embryos, the Golgi apparatus appeared to be distributed randomly in the cytoplasm, it became localized in the subapical region as EPI cells accumulated apical F-actin and became polarized (Figure 3E, arrowheads). At this time, the nucleus also became basally localized and the cells acquired a typical epithelial morphology (Figure 3E, arrows). We then considered the mechanism beh"

All RNA interference pathways use small single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) molecules that guide proteins of the Argonaute (Ago) family to complementary ssRNA targets: RNA-guided RNA interference. The role of prokaryotic Ago variants has remained elusive, although bioinformatics analysis has suggested their involvement in host defence. Here we demonstrate that Ago of the bacterium Thermus thermophilus (TtAgo) acts as a barrier for the uptake and propagation of foreign DNA. In vivo, TtAgo is loaded with 5'-phosphorylated DNA guides, 13-25 nucleotides in length, that are mostly plasmid derived and have a strong bias for a 5'-end deoxycytidine. These small interfering DNAs guide TtAgo to cleave complementary DNA strands. Hence, despite structural homology to its eukaryotic counterparts, TtAgo functions in host defence by DNA-guided DNA interference."

Here, we derive mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) deleted in all three Tet genes and examine their capacity for reprogramming into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). We show that Tet-deficient MEFs cannot be reprogrammed because of a block in the mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) step. Reprogramming of MEFs deficient in TDG is similarly impaired. The block in reprogramming is caused at least in part by defective activation of key miRNAs, which depends on oxidative demethylation promoted by Tet and TDG. Reintroduction of either the affected miRNAs or catalytically active Tet and TDG restores reprogramming in the knockout MEFs.

These findings provide mechanistic insight into the role of epigenetic barriers in cell-lineage conversion. Pluripotent cells, such as those in early embryos, proliferate and differentiate into distinctive cell lineages. Lineage commitment is established and maintained in development by epigenetic programming of gene-expression profiles, in which DNA methylation plays a prominent role (Goll and Bestor, 2005Goll M.G. Bestor T.H. Eukaryotic cytosine methyltransferases.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 481-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1601) Google Scholar, Jaenisch and Bird, 2003Jaenisch R. Bird A. Epigenetic regulation of gene expression: how the genome integrates intrinsic and environmental signals.Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (4663) Google Scholar). DNA methylation patterns are faithfully propagated in cells undergoing mitosis. Early embryonic genes, such as the pluripotency genes Oct4 and Nanog, undergo silencing and de novo DNA methylation in their promoter and enhancer regions during cell differentiation and maintain their hypermethylated states in differentiated somatic cells (Epsztejn-Litman et al., 2008Epsztejn-Litman S.

The developmental and cell-differentiation processes therefore entail dynamic regulation of genomic methylation accompanied by gene-expression changes. Lineage commitment can be reversed in vivo and in vitro through natural and experimental reprogramming such as nuclear transfer of a somatic nucleus into an enucleated oocyte and factor-induced conversion of somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Because each cell identity is supposedly defined by a unique methylation profile that underpins its lineage commitment and serves as a barrier between different cell types, methylation reprogramming is a mechanistically vital process underlying cell-type switch. For example, demethylation of pluripotency genes is a hallmark of somatic-cell reprogramming into a pluripotent state (Gurdon and Melton, 2008Gurdon J.B. Melton D.A. Nuclear reprogramming in cells.Science. 2008; 322: 1811-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006Takahashi K. Yamanaka S.

Transcriptional activation of epigenetically silenced genes thus necessitates the demethylation of critical regulatory elements in DNA during experimental reprogramming. The Tet family of DNA dioxygenases catalyzes oxidation of methylcytosines to hydroxymethylcytosines (5hmC), formylcytosines (5fC), and carboxylcytosines (5caC) (He et al., 2011He Y.F. Li B.Z. Li Z.

An active mode of DNA demethylation has been proposed to encompass Tet-mediated oxidation of methylcytosines and excision of the higher oxidation products by DNA glycosylase TDG (He et al., 2011He Y.F.

However, the possibility of replication-associated passive dilution of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and its oxidation products (Inoue and Zhang, 2011Inoue A. Zhang Y.

Whereas overexpression of Tet1 and Tet2 has been shown to promote iPSC formation through the reactivation of silenced pluripotency genes (Bagci and Fisher, 2013Bagci H. Fisher A.G.

In this study, we generated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) deleted of components of the putative active DNA demethylation pathway and tested these MEFs for iPSC induction and the reactivation of genes critical for cellular reprogramming. We demonstrate here that demethylation promoted by Tet and TDG is directly involved and essential in the reactivation of miRNAs that enables a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition to initiate the reprogramming process. Although Tet1 and Tet2 have been shown to facilitate cell reprogramming (Costa et al., 2013Costa Y. Ding J. Theunissen T.W. Faiola F. Hore T.A. Shliaha P.V. Fidalgo M. Saunders A. Lawrence M.

Shih A. et al.Early-stage epigenetic modification during somatic cell reprogramming by Parp1 and Tet2.Nature. 2012; 488: 652-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), it remains unclear whether Tet-mediated DNA oxidation is essential for this process. To assess the functional importance of Tet enzymes, we generated mouse embryonic fibroblasts from embryonic stems cells (ESCs) deficient in Tet genes for the generation of iPSCs (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures available online). ESCs lacking all three Tet genes seemed normal in self-renewal and pluripotency (Figure S1). MEFs generated from chimeric embryos with blastocyst injection of these ESCs proliferated at a similar rate as wild-type control MEFs and those isolated from homozygous embryos resulting from heterozygous mating (Figure S2A). Considering the dynamic expression of three Tet genes during iPSC generation (Figure S2B), we determined and compared the reprogramming efficiency among MEFs deficient in a single Tet gene and in combinations, using the three-factor (Oct4, Sox2, and Klf4) induction system (Figure S2C). MEFs with Tet1 deletion had slightly increased reprogramming efficiency as described (Chen et al., 2013Chen J. Guo L. Zhang L. Wu H. Yang J. Liu H. Wang X. Hu X. Gu T. Zhou Z. et al.Vitamin C modulates TET1 function during somatic cell reprogramming.Nat. Genet. 2013; 45: 1504-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), and inactivation of Tet3 had little effect, based on the comparison of alkaline phosphatase (AP)-positive colony numbers (Figure 1A). Although inactivation of Tet2 reduced the reprogramming by ∼70%, AP-positive colonies could still appear. In addition, MEFs from Tet1,Tet2 and Tet1,Tet3 double knockouts also generated numerous colonies and SSEA1-positive cells. Strikingly, inactivation of all three Tet genes completely abolished the reprogramming potential of MEFs as evidenced by the failure to obtain AP- (Figure 1A) and SSEA1-positve cells (Figure 1B). The resistance of triple knockout (TKO) MEFs to reprogramming was further validated using high-performance engineered factors (Wang et al., 2011Wang Y. Chen J. Hu J.L. Wei X.X. Qin D. Gao J. Zhang L. Jiang J. Li J.S. Liu J. et al.Reprogramming of mouse and human somatic cells by high-performance engineered factors.EMBO Rep. 2011; 12: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) in the presence of c-Myc and improved medium (Chen et al., 2011Chen J. Liu J. Chen Y. Yang J. Chen J. Liu H. Zhao X. Mo K. Song H. Guo L. et al.Rational optimization of reprogramming culture conditions for the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells with ultra-high efficiency and fast kinetics.Cell Res. 2011; 21: 884-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar; Figure S2D). The reprogramming deficiency of TKO MEFs could not be ascribed to inherent genomic or epigenomic alterations potentially arisen from the constitutive Tet deletion, because AP-positive colonies also did not appear upon the acute deletion of Tet2 from the Tet1,Tet3 double knockout (DKO) MEFs or the acute deletion of Tet3 from Tet1,Tet2 DKO MEFs by the Cre recombinase expression (Figure 1C). Moreover, Tet TKO MEFs could be rescued for reprogramming in latter experiments. These observations indicate that the Tet enzymes are indispensable for factor-driven reprogramming of somatic cells. Factor-driven reprogramming is a multistep process initiated by mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) as an essential event for MEFs to be successfully reprogrammed into iPSCs (Li et al., 2010Li R. Liang J. Ni S. Zhou T. Qing X. Li H. He W. Chen J. Li F.

Functional genomics reveals a BMP-driven mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition in the initiation of somatic cell reprogramming.Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 7: 64-77Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). The fact that AP and SSEA1, markers of early reprogramming, were not induced in TKO MEFs suggested an early reprogramming defect. Indeed, Tet TKO MEFs showed no sign of epithelium-like morphological shift, whereas wild-type, single, or double knockout MEFs exhibited an obvious MET, starting from day 4 after transduction of the Oct4, Sox2, and Klf4 (OSK) reprogramming factors (Figures 2A and S2C). The MET process in TKO MEFs could be rescued by ectopic expression of the wild-type catalytic domain, but not the inactive form of Tet2 (Figure 2B). E-cadherin (Cdh1), EpCAM, and occludin (Ocln) are components of epithelial cell junctions, and without their expression, cells are unable to form colonies. Snail, Slug, Zeb1, and Zeb2 are transcription factors that promote the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and maintain the mesenchymal phenotype by directly repressing epithelial gene expression (Thiery et al., 2009Thiery J.P. Acloque H. Huang R.Y. Nieto M.A. Epithelial-mesenchymal transitions in development and disease.Cell. 2009; 139: 871-890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7557) Google Scholar). Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis confirmed persistent expression of the mesenchymal markers Snail, Slug, Zeb1, and Zeb2 and lack of activation of the epithelial markers Cdh1, EpCAM, and Ocln in Tet-deficient MEFs (Figure 2C), indicating a resistance to MET at the molecular level. The reprogramming capacity of the TKO MEFs appeared to be fully restored by ectopic expression of the catalytic domain from any of the Tet proteins (Figure 2D). Our data suggest that Tet-deficient MEFs fail to initiate the MET process due to their inability to downregulate the key mesenchymal regulators and that MET depends on the catalytic function of Tet enzymes. The miR-200 s, miR-200a, miR-200b, miR-200c, miR-141, and miR-429 are causatively involved in both cancer metastasis and experimental cell reprogramming by modulating the expression of transcription factors such as Zeb1 and Zeb2 that repress epithelial markers including E-cadherin (Gregory et al., 2008Gregory P.A.

USA. 2013; 110: 2858-2863Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). We confirmed that all five members of the miR-200 family were substantially upregulated in MEFs undergoing reprogramming (Figure 3A). Interestingly, the expression of miR-200 family was diminishing in Tet-deficient MEFs, most severely in TKO cells (Figure 3B). Remarkably, ectopic expression of miR-200c in the TKO MEFs restored the MET process as evident in the cell morphology, formation of colonies, and epithelial marker expression (Figures 3C and 3D). In fact, each of the three miR-200 members tested, but not the two independent miR-200c mutants containing base changes in the miRNA seed region, enabled a marked rescue in terms of AP-positive colony and SSEA-positive cell numbers (Figures 3E and 3F). Combination of the five members led to a rescue of up to 80% of the reprogramming efficiency of the wild-type MEFs (Figure 3F). Importantly, iPSC lines could be established from the TKO MEFs upon miR-200 rescue. These iPSCs displayed the typical ESC morphology (Figures 3G and 3H) and expressed endogenous pluripotency genes at similar levels as in ESCs (Figure 3I). When injected into mouse blastocysts, they contributed to the generation of chimeric embryos (Figure 3J) and to the germline in embryonic gonads (Figure 3K). To investigate whether the failure in MET is indeed the major reason for reprogramming deficiency of TKO MEFs, we derived two types of epithelium-like cells, keratinocytes and neural progenitor cells (NPCs), and examined their reprogramming in the absence of Tets. As indicated in the AP colony-formation assay, neonatal keratinocytes [Tet1−/− Tet2−/− Tet3 f/−] could be reprogrammed efficiently upon conditional deletion of the only functional Tet3 allele (Figures S3A–S3D). NPCs derived from TKO ESCs also underwent efficient programming (Figures S3E–S3H). Moreover, inactivation of floxed Tet2, in [Tet1−/− Tet2 f/f Tet3−/−] MEFs at a stage (days 4–6) subsequent to the MET did not seem to have any effect whereas earlier inactivation led to no AP-positive colonies (Figures S3I–S3K). These results demonstrate that the expression of the miR-200 family that is critical for the MET relies on Tet enzymes and that the inability of the Tet-deficient MEFs to be reprogrammed can be primarily attributed to a failure to activate their expression and initiate MET. Having revealed the lack of miRNA reactivation as a major cause for blocking MET in Tet-deficient MEFs, we reasoned that persistent epigenetic silencing might have rendered these somatic cells unresponsive to reprogramming. The miR-200 family has two clusters in the mouse genome, with miR-200b, miR-200a, and miR-429 sharing one transcript and miR-200c and miR-141 sharing another (Figure 4A). In order to analyze the dynamics of DNA methylation during reprogramming, we sorted SSEA1-positive cells (1%–10% of the total population) at reprogramming days 3–9, which are considered a population poised to become iPSCs (Polo et al., 2012Polo J.M. Anderssen E. Walsh R.M. Schwarz B.A. Nefzger C.M. Lim S.M. Borkent M. Apostolou E. Alaei S. Cloutier J. et al.A molecular roadmap of reprogramming somatic cells into iPS cells.Cell. 2012; 151: 1617-1632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). In wild-type MEFs under reprogramming, the putative promoter loci (or 5′ region) of miR-200b and miR-200c and other examined loci within the gene body registered a dynamic reprogramming of DNA modifications as reflected in the results of the GlucMS-qPCR assay that quantifies 5mC and 5hmC at selected CCGG sites (Figure 4B; data not shown). The hypermethylation state decreases gradually, in parallel with the appearance of 5hmC, which peaked around day 5. Detailed bisulfite sequencing analysis in the 5′ regions of both clusters revealed hypermethylation in MEFs at the start (day 0), hypomethylation in iPSCs, and intermediate levels at days 3–7 (Figure 4C). Because conventional bisulfite sequencing cannot distinguish 5hmC from 5mC, we applied Tet-assisted bisulfite sequencing (Yu et al., 2012bYu M. Hon G.C. Szulwach K.E. Song C.X. Zhang L. Kim A. Li X. Dai Q. Shen Y. Park B. et al.Base-resolution analysis of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in the mammalian genome.Cell. 2012; 149: 1368-1380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar) to analyze the occurrence of 5hmC. Strikingly, the 5hmC levels in day 5 MEFs undergoing reprogramming reached 18.7% and 9.7%, respectively, in the 5′ regions (Figure 4D). Most importantly, Tet triple knockout abolished 5hmC formation with Tet2 knockout (KO) having the greatest effect among the three individual knockouts (Figure 4E). As a consequence of failed hydroxylation, hypermethylation as exemplified by the 5′ region of miR-200c was still retained in TKO cells by day 10 (Figure 4F). In order to gain a global view of the dynamics of methylcytosine and hydroxymethylcytosine during reprogramming, we performed reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) and Tet-assisted-RRBS (TA-RRBS) of cellular DNA at reprogramming days 0 and 5. A marked increase in 5hmC was noticed in various genomic regions in the initial days, accompanying the decrease in 5mC (Figures S4A and S4B). An inverse correlation between 5hmC and 5mC was also seen among promoters (Figure S4C). Gene Ontology analysis indicated that the most-enriched promoters were associated with cell adhesion (Figure S4D), consistent with the idea that MET-related genes are a group of targets for Tet-catalyzed hydroxylation during the early phase of reprogramming. Among the enriched targets subject to methylation reprogramming were the miR-200 clusters (Figure S4E). Despite the fact that the Oct4 locus also gained 5hmC (Figure S4E), the combined level of 5mC and 5hmC did not seem to decline and its expression was lacking in the early phase of reprogramming as shown in latter experiments. A further functional validation of Tet enzymes in the epigenetic regulation of miRNAs was provided by the observation that ectopic expression of the Tet2 catalytic domain restored the 5hmC level in the 5′ regions of the two clusters in the TKO MEFs (Figure 4G) and resulted in upregulation of the miRNAs, albeit to a lesser degree than in the wild-type MEFs (Figure 4H). Taken together, these data demonstrate that Tet-dependent 5mC hydroxylation demethylates and reactivates MET-promoting miRNAs in reprogramming MEFs. DNA hydroxylation in reprogramming MEFs can have several ramifications for epigenetic regulation. Apart from the possibility of 5hmC serving as a stable mark, which is unlikely the major function of 5hmC predicated on its transitory occurrence, DNA demethylation may happen in part by hydroxylation, followed by passive dilution or further conversion to 5fC and5caC (He et al., 2011He Y.F.

TDG is implicated in DNA demethylation initiated by Tet enzymes due to its ability to recognize and excise the higher oxidation products 5fC and 5caC (He et al., 2011He Y.F. Li B.Z. Li Z. Liu P. Wang Y. Tang Q. Ding J. Jia Y. Chen Z.

Chem. 2011; 286: 35334-35338Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar), although the biological significance of the Tet-TDG functional connection has not been fully evaluated. We further extended our findings of the coupling between Tet and TDG by demonstrating their interdependency in the activation of a methylated reporter gene (Figure S5A). In order to explore the potential involvement of Tet-catalyzed higher oxidation in cell reprogramming, we established inducible Tdg knockout MEFs from embryos carrying a floxed and a null allele and tested them for iPSC induction. The Cre-mediated deletion of Tdg did not affect the proliferation of MEFs (Figure S5B). Upon transduction with Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and Cre recombinase, the control MEFs with a wild-type Tdg allele in addition to a floxed allele showed a normal reprogramming capacity. However, MEFs carrying a null allele together with a floxed allele did not result in any iPSCs positive for AP and SSEA1 (Figures 5A and 5B ). Re-expression of wild-type TDG, but not the catalytic mutant (N151A; Figure S5C), restored full reprogramming capacity (Figure 5). Similar to the Tet TKO MEFs, TDG-null MEFs did not initiate the MET as judged by morphology and mesenchymal/epithelial marker expression (Figures 6A and 6B ). Likewise, the blockage of MET initiation in Tdg-deficient MEFs could be ascribed to the failed activation of regulatory miRNAs (Figure 6C), and the MET resumed upon forced expression of miR-200c, but not Tet2C (Figure 6D). As evidenced by the formation of AP-positive colonies, robust reprogramming proceeded in the absence of TDG upon rescue with miR-200c or other two miRNAs, miR-200b and miR-429, with an efficiency of above 30% of the Tdg-proficient wild-type cells (Figure 6E). iPSC lines could be established from rescued Tdg KO MEFs (Figure 6F), and they were pluripotent as demonstrated by the generation of high-grade chimeric mice (Figure 6G). Contrary to the drastic effect on MEFs, Tdg deletion did not prevent keratinocyte and NPCs from reprogramming (Figures S6A–S6D). Cre-mediated late deletion from Tdg-floxed MEFs did not seem to impair the generation of AP-positive colonies whereas early deletion prior to MET led to no single colony (Figures S6E and S6F). The data above led us to conclude that the TDG is required for MET by contributing to the reactivation of the critical miRNA genes in the early phase of reprogramming. Because the epigenetic regulation, MET, and iPSC formation in TDG-null MEFs all depend on the catalytic activity of TDG, we infer that the formation and excision of 5fC and 5caC are likely a critical step that at least partially contributes to the demethylation process. In order to dissect the demethylation pathway underlying miRNA reactivation, we attempted to detect the higher oxidation derivatives of 5mC in reprogramming MEFs. We took advantage of the observation that 5fC/5caC modifications, but not 5mC and 5hmC, block MspI (CCGG) restriction digestion (He et al., 2011He Y.F. Li B.Z. Li Z. Liu P. Wang Y. Tang Q. Ding J.

Whereas TDG-proficient intermediate cells and unrescued TDG-deficient cells lacked detectable 5fC/5caC, these modified species were readily detected in TDG-deficient cells rescued for reprogramming with ectopic miR-200c (Figure 7A). The abundance of 5fC/5caC varied among different loci, with the highest level detected in the 5′ region of miR-429. Like those of miR-200b and miR-200c (Figures 4C and 4D), the 5′ region of miR-429 also exhibited hypermethylation in starting MEFs (Figure 7B) and methylation reduction while gaining 5hmC in reprogramming intermediates and iPSCs (Figure 7C). In order to provide independent validation for 5fC/5caC deposition, we used a method for base-resolution profiling, termed methylation-assisted bisulfite sequencing (MAB-seq). The miR-429 region was selected due to the relative abundance of 5fC/5caC found at a CpG site in Tdg-null reprogramming cells (Figure 7A). MAB sequencing revealed a considerable amount (∼19%) of 5fC and 5caC in TDG-null cells undergoing reprogramming upon miRNA rescue (Figure 7D). No 5fC/5caC was detected in corresponding TDG-proficient intermediate cells or control MEFs harboring an intact wild-type or a floxed Tdg allele. As the total level of 5fC, 5caC, and unmodified cytosines (C) in this region determined by conventional bisulfite profiling was 64.6%, C could be inferred to account for 45.9%. Compared to the high levels of combined 5mC and 5hmC in MEFs (around 80%; Figures 7B–7D), Tet"

Large oil spills, such as the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) disaster that occurred in 2010 in the Gulf of Mexico, could severely affect fish at impacted spawning sites. The physiological mechanisms underlying such potential cardiotoxic effects remain unclear. Here, we show that crude oil samples collected from the DWH spill prolonged the action potential of isolated cardiomyocytes from juvenile bluefin and yellowfin tunas, through the blocking of the delayed rectifier potassium current (I(Kr)). Crude oil exposure also decreased calcium current (I(Ca)) and calcium cycling, which disrupted excitation-contraction coupling in cardiomyocytes.

The genetic heterogeneity within ASD is striking, with even the most frequent causes responsible for only 1% of cases at the most. Even with the recent developments in next-generation sequencing, for the large majority of cases no molecular diagnosis can be established. Here, we report ten patients with ASD and other shared clinical characteristics, including intellectual disability and facial dysmorphisms caused by a mutation in ADNP, a transcription factor involved in the SWI/SNF remodeling complex.

Platelets generated from megakaryocyte (MK) precursors are vital for the treatment of many hematological diseases and traumas. Currently, platelets can only be obtained through blood donation. Fresh single-donor platelets have a short shelf life and must be maintained with plasma at 20°C –24°C; they readily lose clotting activity when pooled from multiple donors and frozen or warmed to 37°C (Bergmeier et al., 2003Bergmeier W.

Moreover, repeated transfusion induces the production of antibodies against allogenic human leukocyte antigen (HLA) or human platelet antigen (HPA) on the transfused platelets (Schiffer, 2001Schiffer C.A. Diagnosis and management of refractoriness to platelet transfusion.Blood Rev. 2001; 15: 175-180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), which renders the patient unresponsive to platelet transfusion therapy. These supply logistics and practical limitations represent barriers to the widespread application of platelets as a resource for patients. In that context, human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) (Takahashi et al., 2007Takahashi K. Tanabe K. Ohnuki M. Narita M. Ichisaka T. Tomoda K. Yamanaka S. Induction of pluripotent stem cells from adult human fibroblasts by defined factors.Cell. 2007; 131: 861-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14964) Google Scholar) could represent a potent alternative source of platelet production. Because platelets do not contain nuclei, gamma irradiation before transfusion could be used to eliminate any residual contaminating hiPSCs and their derivatives, reducing the risk of tumorigenesis. Thus, the application of iPSC-based technology could potentially yield a consistent supply of HLA- and/or HPA-matched or even autologous platelets in a way that would address some of the major roadblocks in the current clinical approaches to platelet-based therapy. Our group and another recently demonstrated that hiPSCs derived from human skin fibroblasts or blood cells or from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) can be used to generate platelets in vitro and that these platelets appeared to function normally when transfused into mouse models (Takayama et al., 2010Takayama N.

Platelets generated from human embryonic stem cells are functional in vitro and in the microcirculation of living mice.Cell Res. 2011; 21: 530-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, the yield of platelets was still far below what would be required to generate even 1 u of platelet concentrate for patient transfusion. Recent studies have shown that self-replicating MK progenitors can be directly generated from murine hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) within bone marrow (BM) in vivo (Yamamoto et al., 2013Yamamoto R. Morita Y. Ooehara J. Hamanaka S. Onodera M. Rudolph K.L. Ema H. Nakauchi H. Clonal analysis unveils self-renewing lineage-restricted progenitors generated directly from hematopoietic stem cells.Cell. 2013; 154: 1112-1126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), but there was no evident way to sustain long-term self-replication of MK progenitors in vitro. We previously showed that the activation of c-MYC to a restricted level below that associated with senescence and apoptosis induction appears to lead to an increase in platelet generation (Takayama et al., 2010Takayama N. Nishimura S. Nakamura S. Shimizu T. Ohnishi R. Endo H. Yamaguchi T. Otsu M. Nishimura K.

Med. 2010; 207: 2817-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that co-overexpression of c-MYC and BMI1, a polycomb complex component that represses the INK4A/ARF gene locus (Oguro et al., 2006Oguro H. Iwama A. Morita Y. Kamijo T. van Lohuizen M. Nakauchi H. Differential impact of Ink4a and Arf on hematopoietic stem cells and their bone marrow microenvironment in Bmi1-deficient mice.J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203: 2247-2253Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), enables megakaryocytic cell lines (MKCLs) derived from hiPSCs or hESCs to grow continuously for up to 2 months. A destabilization domain (DD) vector system (Banaszynski et al., 2006Banaszynski L.A. Chen L.C. Maynard-Smith L.A. Ooi A.G. Wandless T.J. A rapid, reversible, and tunable method to regulate protein function in living cells using synthetic small molecules.Cell. 2006; 126: 995-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar) enabled us to control exogenous c-MYC within the appropriate range, leading to successful induction of MKCLs. The addition of BCL-XL made it possible to obtain immortalized MKCLs (imMKCLs) that can be grown for more than 5 months and thus function as candidate cell banks. When the expression of c-MYC, BMI1, and BCL-XL is turned off, imMKCLs produce functional CD42b (glycoprotein Ib α [GPIbα] and receptor for von Willebrand factor [vWF])+ platelet particles. The expression of CD42b on platelets is required for the initiation of clotting (Ware et al., 2000Ware J. Russell S. Ruggeri Z.M.

USA. 2000; 97: 2803-2808Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) and bacterial clearance in vivo (Wong et al., 2013Wong C.H. Jenne C.N. Petri B. Chrobok N.L. Kubes P.

Although previous studies have reported that CMK, Meg01, and K562 cells, three well-known MK lineage leukemia cell lines, can become polyploid and release CD41a+ particles in the presence of agonist stimulation, they do not provide a suitable source for a platelet supply because the particles are CD42b− (Isakari et al., 2009Isakari Y.

In this report, we describe a strategy that involves MKCLs with long-term self-renewal capacity and the potential to provide an inexhaustible supply of CD42b+ platelets; in that respect, they resemble endogenous self-replicating MK progenitors identified in vivo (Yamamoto et al., 2013Yamamoto R. Morita Y. Ooehara J. Hamanaka S. Onodera M. Rudolph K.L. Ema H. Nakauchi H. Clonal analysis unveils self-renewing lineage-restricted progenitors generated directly from hematopoietic stem cells.Cell. 2013; 154: 1112-1126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Clinical application of this technology could provide a plentiful supply of platelets from suitably screened and selected imMKCL clones to serve as cell bank stocks with minimal risk of adverse side effects. We previously showed that, when expressed at an appropriate level, c-MYC acts as a growth mediator in normal megakaryopoiesis and thrombopoiesis from hESCs or hiPSCs, whereas excessive c-MYC expression in hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) induces the activation of the INK4A and ARF pathways, leading to senescence and apoptosis (Takayama et al., 2010Takayama N. Nishimura S. Nakamura S. Shimizu T. Ohnishi R. Endo H. Yamaguchi T. Otsu M. Nishimura K. Nakanishi M. et al.Transient activation of c-MYC expression is critical for efficient platelet generation from human induced pluripotent stem cells.J. Exp. Med. 2010; 207: 2817-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that c-MYC activation might contribute to self-replication at the MK progenitor stage. When we assessed the effects of c-MYC overexpression alone, BMI1 overexpression alone, c-MYC overexpression plus p53 knockdown, c-MYC plus BCL-XL overexpression, and c-MYC plus BMI1 overexpression in CD34+CD43+-containing HPCs derived from the KhES-3 hESC line, we found that c-MYC overexpression alone or the combination of c-MYC and BMI1 overexpression increased numbers of large cells expressing megakaryocytic CD41a+CD42a (GPIX)+CD42b+CD9+ markers over a 2-week period (Figures 1A–1C; Figure S1A available online). With c-MYC and BMI1 overexpression (Figure 1C, orange triangles) or c-MYC overexpression and INK4A/ARF knockdown (Figure 1C, blue triangles), but none of the other aforementioned conditions, proliferation of this cell population was maintained at an exponential level for 2 months (MK progenitor cell line; Figure 1C, orange triangles) and was dependent upon the presence of thrombopoietin (TPO) with the help of stem cell factor (SCF). This suggests that the effect of BMI1 may be to at least inhibit INK4A/ARF-dependent senescence and apoptosis during the initiation of self-replication, as confirmed by quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis, which revealed BMI1 represses c-MYC-induced the upregulation of INK4A/ARF (Figure S1B). The CD41a+ MKCLs derived from hESCs showed monoblastic morphology with basophilic cytoplasm (Figure 1D) and generated aberrant platelet-like particles expressing normal levels of CD41a but reduced levels of CD42b (Figure S1C). This is consistent with the requirement for the downregulation of c-MYC for maturation of MKs (Takayama et al., 2010Takayama N. Nishimura S. Nakamura S. Shimizu T. Ohnishi R. Endo H. Yamaguchi T. Otsu M. Nishimura K. Nakanishi M. et al.Transient activation of c-MYC expression is critical for efficient platelet generation from human induced pluripotent stem cells.J. Exp. Med. 2010; 207: 2817-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Our ability to induce MKCLs with c-MYC and BMI1 overexpression and then grow the cells for more than 2 weeks varied among individual PSC clones (data not shown). Therefore, we suspected that individual PSC clones require different levels of c-MYC. When we prepared an inducible all-in-one vector harboring c-MYC and BMI1 (Ohmine et al., 2001Ohmine K. Ota J. Ueda M. Ueno S. Yoshida K. Yamashita Y. Kirito K. Imagawa S. Nakamura Y. Saito K. et al.Characterization of stage progression in chronic myeloid leukemia by DNA microarray with purified hematopoietic stem cells.Oncogene. 2001; 20: 8249-8257Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) (Figure S1D), we obtained clearer evidence that c-MYC levels are crucial for the sustained growth of MKCL, given that we saw different results with c-MYC-2A-BMI1 and BMI1-2A-c-MYC gene sequences in this vector (Figures S1E and S1F). Furthermore, to confirm the hypothesis that, in some individual PSC clones, the effective c-MYC expression level may be restricted to a specific range (Figure 1E), we used a vector tagged with a DD (Banaszynski et al., 2006Banaszynski L.A. Chen L.C. Maynard-Smith L.A. Ooi A.G. Wandless T.J. A rapid, reversible, and tunable method to regulate protein function in living cells using synthetic small molecules.Cell. 2006; 126: 995-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar) in order to reduce the level of c-MYC protein (Figure 1F). This system regulates protein stability, and thus the level of c-MYC expression, in a manner that depends on the Shield1 concentration (NIH 3T3 cells in Figure S1G). When we used this DD-tagged vector system to establish iPSC (692D2)-derived MKCLs, we found that 692D2 iPSCs showed no self-replication when transduced with c-MYC-2A-BMI1 overexpression without a DD tag, but transduction of the DD tag vector without the addition of Shield1 allowed clone 692D2 to grow for up to 50 days in culture (Figure 1G). This self-replication was inhibited by 100 or 1,000 nM Shield1 (Figure 2Ai), suggesting the total c-MYC level most likely blocked stable self-replication. This result was not due to nonspecific cell toxicity (Figure S2A) or activation of the INK4A/ARF gene locus by the high level of c-MYC, given that levels of p14 and p16 mRNA (derived INK4A/ARF locus gene) did not differ in the presence or absence of 1,000 nM Shield1 (Figure S2B). Given that BMI1, which is also overexpressed in our system, represses the INK4A/ARF gene locus, the mechanism underlying the MYC-dependent failure of continuous self-replication was unclear. However, the well-known involvement of c-MYC in caspase-dependent apoptosis (Juin et al., 2002Juin P. Hunt A. Littlewood T. Griffiths B. Swigart L.B. Korsmeyer S.

Biol. 2002; 22: 6158-6169Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) prompted us to assess caspase activity in the MKCL clone. Caspase assays revealed that the activation of caspases 3 and 7 in DD self-replicable MKCLs derived from iPSC clone 692D2 was 2-fold higher in the presence of 1,000 nM Shield1 than in its absence. This increased caspase activation was also associated with reduced cell viability (Figures 2Ai and 2Aii), confirming that restricting caspase activation may be key to successfully establishing expandable MKCLs (Figure S2B). Notably, caspase activation in the absence of Shield1 was still 12.2× higher than in Jurkat cells (Figure 2Aii). Some apoptotic events are transcriptionally determined (Chen et al., 2007Chen C. Fuhrken P.G. Huang L.T. Apostolidis P. Wang M. Paredes C.J. Miller W.M. Papoutsakis E.T.

Cakouros D. Transcriptional control of the core cell-death machinery.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 193-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Therefore, to further address the mechanism by which excessive c-MYC represses self-replication and induces apoptosis, we carried out a microarray analysis with iPSC-derived MKCLs treated with or without 1,000 nM Shield1. Gene ontology classification of genes differentially expressed in the presence and absence of Shield1 indicated a correlation between higher levels of c-MYC (1,000 nM Shield1) and the expression of the proapoptotic factors BMF and BBC3 (PUMA), which can contribute to the release of cytochrome-c from mitochondria via mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization. High levels of c-MYC also influenced cell-cycle-related genes, increasing the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKN1B, p27, and Kip1), which could arrest MKCL growth. These changes were also confirmed by qPCR analysis (Figures S2C and S2D). Thus, high c-MYC expression can lead to caspase-dependent MKCL apoptosis (Figure 2A), despite the suppression of the INK4A/ARF pathway by BMI1 (Figure S2B). These data again indicate that alternative apoptosis pathways, as well as the INK4A/ARF pathways, are independently induced by excessive c-MYC in individual PSC-derived MKCL clones. We noticed that MKCLs obtained from either ESC clone KhES3 or iPSC clone 692D2 with c-MYC plus BMI1 (Figure 2B, bottom line) exhibited limited growth potential and discontinuous cell growth that ceased at about 60 days, potentially reflecting an increase in caspase activation (692D2 cell growth in Figure 2C; KhES3 cell growth in Figure 2D; 0 nM Shield1for 692D2 in Figure 2Ai and KhES-3 in Figure S2E). Thus, it appears that the expression of c-MYC and BMI1 alone are not suitable for generation of an immortalized cell line. We therefore sought to examine the effect of BCL-XL on days 14–21 after transduction of c-MYC plus BMI1 (Figure 2B). We found that BCL-XL overexpression induced exponential growth of CD41a+ cells derived from either 692D2 or KhES3 cells. This growth persisted for over 5 months, and we therefore deemed these cells to be self-renewing imMKCLs (Figures 2C and 2D for 692D2 [imMKCL clone 1, Cl-1], and Figure 2D for KhES-3 ESCs [Cl-2]; yellow circles). These two imMKCLs also showed comparable growth after cryopreservation (Figure 2E) as well as somewhat larger cell size and expression of CD41a, CD42a, CD42b, and CD9 (Figure S2F). Growth of these imMKCLs was sustained even with higher c-MYC expression in the presence of 100 or 1,000 nM Shield1 (Figures S2G–S2I), and the cells exhibited comparatively low levels of caspase 3 and 7 activation, similar to that of Jurkat cells (Figure S2I). To further validate the function of BCL-XL in caspase regulation, we tested the effect of the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD FMK on proliferation. Caspase inhibition increased proliferation about 21-fold, whereas BCL-XL expression elicited a 64-fold increase. In contrast, the vehicle control (DMSO) enhanced apoptosis (Figures S3A–S3C). Altogether, these findings again confirm that BCL-XL inhibits apoptosis through caspase 3 and 7 inactivation and that c-MYC, BMI1, and BCL-XL are all required for the induction of imMKCLs from PSC clones. In addition, because it is well known that activation of p53 and p21 is also associated with c-MYC-dependent apoptosis (Hotti et al., 2000Hotti A. Järvinen K. Siivola P. Hölttä E. Caspases and mitochondria in c-Myc-induced apoptosis: identification of ATM as a new target of caspases.Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2354-2362Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), we assessed the effect of inhibiting p53 on cell growth with imMKCL Cl-1. Our results show no involvement of p53 in cells expressing c-MYC, BMI1, and BCL-XL (Figure 2F), and a similar result was obtained with KhES-3-imMKCL (Cl-2; data not shown). Next, we asked whether the simultaneous overexpression of c-MYC, BMI1, and BCL-XL was more suitable for establishing imMKCLs than overexpression of c-MYC plus BMI1 followed by later expression of BCL-XL. To address that question, we used four individual PSC clones to compare two protocols: simultaneous overexpression of all three genes or overexpression of c-MYC and BMI1 followed by BCL-XL 14–21 days later, counting from the HPC stage (days 28–35 from the hESC or iPSC stage; Figure 2B, top). Simultaneous addition of all three genes promoted maximal proliferation for only up to 40–50 days, whereas stepwise addition of c-MYC and BMI1 followed by BCL-XL consistently showed more sustained proliferation with all clones examined (Figure S3D–S3G). One potential caveat to this approach is that long-term cultivation might lead to imMKCLs becoming oncogenic. Interestingly, after cultivation for 5 months, two of three imMKCLs, Cl-1 and Cl-2 but not Cl-7, consistently showed a specific karyotypic abnormality: chromosomal translocation that included chromosome +1 or −5 (Figure S4A). When these two clones were separately infused into immunodeficient mice, one (n = 5) displayed leukemogenesis contributing to early death, but the other did not (Figure S4B). These results highlight the importance of transplantation studies with imMKCLs for clone selection. Interestingly, Cl-7 exhibited no karyotypic abnormality (Figure S4A) and consistently showed no abnormalities in transplantation studies (up to 16 weeks; Figure S4B). Therefore, we suggest that combined analysis, including both karyotypic examination and transplantation of individual imMKCL clones, would be useful for selecting imMKCLs as cell bank stock candidates. The GPIb-V-IX complex, particularly CD42b (GPIbα), on platelets is a key binding site for vWF and is required for the initial adhesion of platelets to an injured vessel wall (Ware et al., 2000Ware J. Russell S. Ruggeri Z.M. Generation and rescue of a murine model of platelet dysfunction: the Bernard-Soulier syndrome.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97: 2803-2808Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) as well as normal circulation after transfusion (Leytin et al., 2004Leytin V. Allen D.J. Gwozdz A. Garvey B. Freedman J. Role of platelet surface glycoprotein Ibalpha and P-selectin in the clearance of transfused platelet concentrates.Transfusion. 2004; 44: 1487-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Platelets lacking CD42b expression are quickly cleared from the circulation in vivo, leading to insufficient numbers of circulating platelets after transfusion (Nishikii et al., 2008Nishikii H. Eto K. Tamura N. Hattori K. Heissig B. Kanaji T. Sawaguchi A. Goto S. Ware J. Nakauchi H. Metalloproteinase regulation improves in vitro generation of efficacious platelets from mouse embryonic stem cells.J. Exp. Med. 2008; 205: 1917-1927Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Assuming that the downregulation of c-MYC would be required for the generation of CD42b+ platelets (Takayama et al., 2010Takayama N. Nishimura S. Nakamura S. Shimizu T. Ohnishi R. Endo H. Yamaguchi T. Otsu M. Nishimura K. Nakanishi M. et al.Transient activation of c-MYC expression is critical for efficient platelet generation from human induced pluripotent stem cells.J. Exp. Med. 2010; 207: 2817-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), we turned off the expression of all three inducers (c-MYC, BMI1, and BCL-XL). Five days after these genes were turned off under serum-free conditions (Figure 3A), the iPSC-derived imMKCLs had changed to exhibit MK polyploidization (Figure 3B; on, 5.5% [left]; off, 20.2% [right]) as well as proplatelet formation (Figure 3C and Movie S1) with increased CD42b expression. This is exemplified by the two imMKCL clones in Figure 3D. Along with those changes, after turning off the expression of the exogenous inducing genes, both endogenous and exogenous c-MYC, BMI1, and BCL-XL expression declined (Figure S5A), and transcription factors associated with MK maturation, GATA1, FOG1, NFE2, and β1-tubulin increased to levels comparable to or higher than those seen in cord blood (CB)-derived MKs (Figure 3E). Turning c-MYC, BMI1, and BCL-XL off with a doxycycline-regulated system increased the CD42b+ platelet yield from imMKCLs and upregulated CD42b expression in CD41a+ platelets (Figures 4A and 4B), in comparison to maintaining the overexpression of the three factors or BCL-XL alone (Figure S5B). In addition, whereas imMKCLs generated significant numbers of CD41a+CD42b+ particles that closely resembled endogenous platelets, the well-known MKCLs Meg01, CMK, and K562, produced mostly CD41a+, but CD42b−, platelet-like particles (Figure S5C). We estimated production to be three CD42b+ platelets per Cl-2 imMKCL-MK and 10 platelets per Cl-7 imMKCL-MK after the induction of differentiation (5 days after exogenous expression was turned off; Figure S5D) under serum-free conditions, which is a suitable level for clinical application. In a 10-cm dish scale (10 ml), 4 × 106 and 2 × 106 platelets per ml were obtained from imMKCL Cl-7 and Cl-2, respectively (Figure 4C). Therefore, our proposed system could theoretically yield 1011 platelets (equivalent to one transfusion) within 5 days with 25–50 l medium. Characterization of platelet yields using flow cytometry revealed that the expression levels of platelet-functional molecules, including CD42b, CD61 (β3 integrin), protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1; thrombin receptor), CD49b (α2 integrin), and CD29 (β1 integrin), were mostly comparable to those seen in fresh human peripheral blood (PB)-derived platelets and higher than in human endogenous pooled platelets, although the expression of GPVI (GP6) was a little weaker than it was in fresh PB (Figure 4D), possibly because of receptor shedding at 37°C (Gardiner et al., 2012Gardiner E.E. Al-Tamimi M. Andrews R.K. Berndt M.C. Platelet receptor shedding.Methods Mol. Biol. 2012; 788: 321-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). At the ultrastructural level, transmission electron microscopy revealed frequent generation of platelets through cytoplasmic fragmentation (Figure S6A) and proplatelets in the culture dish (Figure 3C and Movie S1). Individual imMKCL-derived platelets showed normal microtubules but fewer granules when compared to fresh human donor platelets (Figure 5A and S6A). To explore the functionality of imMKCL-derived platelets, we used flow cytometry to examine integrin αIIβ3 activation (inside-out signaling) or platelet aggregation after stimulation with platelet agonists (De Cuyper et al., 2013De Cuyper I.M. Meinders M. van de Vijver E. de Korte D. Porcelijn L. de Haas M. Eble J.A. Seeger K. Rutella S. Pagliara D. et al.A novel flow cytometry-based platelet aggregation assay.Blood. 2013; 121: e70-e80Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Agonist stimulation increased PAC-1 binding mean fluorescent intensity, given that this antibody binds to the activated form of αIIbβ3 integrin (Figures 5B and 5C) as well as platelet aggregation (Figure 5D), clot retraction (Figure 5E), actin cytoskeletal changes (Figure S6B), and vWF or ADP secretion (Figure S6C). Collectively, most in vitro functional parameters indicated that imMKCL platelets gave less robust responses than fresh human platelets, but, comparison to pooled human endogenous platelets (Figures 5C and 5D) or iPSC-derived platelets generated with a direct differentiation method (data not shown; Takayama et al., 2010Takayama N. Nishimura S. Nakamura S. Shimizu T. Ohnishi R. Endo H. Yamaguchi T. Otsu M. Nishimura K.

We also used an ex vivo flow chamber system within which human vWF (10 μg/ml) was immobilized and a shear rate of 1,600 s−1 was applied. imMKCL platelets showed 62.3% (Cl-2) and 75.8% (Cl-7) of the CD42b-dependent binding of fresh human platelets, and human CD42b blocking antibody reversed this adhesion (Figure 5F).

https://openalex.org/W2112114816,"Zoonotic infectious diseases such as influenza continue to pose a grave threat to human health. However, the factors that mediate the emergence of RNA viruses such as influenza A virus (IAV) are still incompletely understood. Phylogenetic inference is crucial to reconstructing the origins and tracing the flow of IAV within and between hosts. Here we show that explicitly allowing IAV host lineages to have independent rates of molecular evolution is necessary for reliable phylogenetic inference of IAV and that methods that do not do so, including 'relaxed' molecular clock models, can be positively misleading. A phylogenomic analysis using a host-specific local clock model recovers extremely consistent evolutionary histories across all genomic segments and demonstrates that the equine H7N7 lineage is a sister clade to strains from birds--as well as those from humans, swine and the equine H3N8 lineage--sharing an ancestor with them in the mid to late 1800s. Moreover, major western and eastern hemisphere avian influenza lineages inferred for each gene coalesce in the late 1800s. On the basis of these phylogenies and the synchrony of these key nodes, we infer that the internal genes of avian influenza virus (AIV) underwent a global selective sweep beginning in the late 1800s, a process that continued throughout the twentieth century and up to the present. The resulting western hemispheric AIV lineage subsequently contributed most of the genomic segments to the 1918 pandemic virus and, independently, the 1963 equine H3N8 panzootic lineage. This approach provides a clear resolution of evolutionary patterns and processes in IAV, including the flow of viral genes and genomes within and between host lineages."

The identification of a selective small-molecule inhibitor of the USP1–UAF1 deubiquitination complex reveals a role for deubiquitination in regulating the DNA damage response. Protein ubiquitination and deubiquitination are central to the control of a large number of cellular pathways and signaling networks in eukaryotes. Although the essential roles of ubiquitination have been established in the eukaryotic DNA damage response, the deubiquitination process remains poorly defined. Chemical probes that perturb the activity of deubiquitinases (DUBs) are needed to characterize the cellular function of deubiquitination. Here we report ML323 (2), a highly potent inhibitor of the USP1–UAF1 deubiquitinase complex with excellent selectivity against human DUBs, deSUMOylase, deneddylase and unrelated proteases. Using ML323, we interrogated deubiquitination in the cellular response to UV- and cisplatin-induced DNA damage and revealed new insights into the requirement of deubiquitination in the DNA translesion synthesis and Fanconi anemia pathways. Moreover, ML323 potentiates cisplatin cytotoxicity in non–small cell lung cancer and osteosarcoma cells. Our findings point to USP1–UAF1 as a key regulator of the DNA damage response and a target for overcoming resistance to the platinum-based anticancer drugs."

GPR56 encodes a heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein)-coupled receptor required for normal cortical development and is expressed in cortical progenitor cells. GPR56 expression levels regulate progenitor proliferation. GPR56 splice forms are highly variable between mice and humans, and the regulatory element of gyrencephalic mammals directs restricted lateral cortical expression.

Microinjection of MECP2-targeting TALEN plasmids into rhesus and cynomolgus zygotes leads to effective gene editing of MECP2 with no detected off-target mutagenesis. Male rhesus (2) and cynomolgous (1) fetuses carrying MECP2 mutations in various tissues including testes were miscarried during midgestation, consistent with RTT-linked male embryonic lethality in humans. One live delivery of a female cynomolgus monkey occurred after 162 days of gestation, with abundant MECP2 mutations in peripheral tissues.

Intrasciatic nerve injection of adeno-associated viruses encoding an excitatory opsin enabled light-inducible stimulation of acute pain, place aversion and optogenetically mediated reductions in withdrawal thresholds to mechanical and thermal stimuli. In contrast, viral delivery of an inhibitory opsin enabled light-inducible inhibition of acute pain perception, and reversed mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia in a model of neuropathic pain. Light was delivered transdermally, allowing these behaviors to be induced in freely moving animals.

https://openalex.org/W2077173342,"The transcription start sites used during the maternal to zygotic transition in zebrafish are mapped, revealing that the transition is characterized by a switch between two different sequence signs to guide transcription initiation, which often co-exist in core promoters. The maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT) during vertebrate embryogenesis represents a dramatic change of the transcriptome, when the zygotic genome is activated and maternal transcripts are degraded. This study maps the transcription start sites used during MZT in zebrafish at nucleotide resolution, and shows that the transition from maternal to zygotic transcriptome is characterized by a switch between two different promoter sequence signals. The position at which RNA transcription starts is determined by an A/T-rich motif at the maternal stage and by fundamentally different codes in the zygote. The two transcription start sites often coexist — and may even overlap — in core promoters and are differentially utilized at promoters active in both oocyte and embryo. A core promoter is a stretch of DNA surrounding the transcription start site (TSS) that integrates regulatory inputs1 and recruits general transcription factors to initiate transcription2. The nature and causative relationship of the DNA sequence and chromatin signals that govern the selection of most TSSs by RNA polymerase II remain unresolved. Maternal to zygotic transition represents the most marked change of the transcriptome repertoire in the vertebrate life cycle3,4,5,6. Early embryonic development in zebrafish is characterized by a series of transcriptionally silent cell cycles regulated by inherited maternal gene products: zygotic genome activation commences at the tenth cell cycle, marking the mid-blastula transition7. This transition provides a unique opportunity to study the rules of TSS selection and the hierarchy of events linking transcription initiation with key chromatin modifications. We analysed TSS usage during zebrafish early embryonic development at high resolution using cap analysis of gene expression8, and determined the positions of H3K4me3-marked promoter-associated nucleosomes9. Here we show that the transition from the maternal to zygotic transcriptome is characterized by a switch between two fundamentally different modes of defining transcription initiation, which drive the dynamic change of TSS usage and promoter shape. A maternal-specific TSS selection, which requires an A/T-rich (W-box) motif, is replaced with a zygotic TSS selection grammar characterized by broader patterns of dinucleotide enrichments, precisely aligned with the first downstream (+1) nucleosome. The developmental dynamics of the H3K4me3-marked nucleosomes reveal their DNA-sequence-associated positioning at promoters before zygotic transcription and subsequent transcription-independent adjustment to the final position downstream of the zygotic TSS. The two TSS-defining grammars coexist, often physically overlapping, in core promoters of constitutively expressed genes to enable their expression in the two regulatory environments. The dissection of overlapping core promoter determinants represents a framework for future studies of promoter structure and function across different regulatory contexts."

The bundle makes minimal protein contacts between helices, but is stabilized by anchoring to the semi-clathrate water monolayers through backbone carbonyl groups in the protein interior.

Here we show that granule cells indeed provide such a temporal basis and that it is well-matched to the temporal structure of self-generated sensory inputs, allowing rapid and accurate sensory cancellation and explaining paradoxical features of negative images.

It is, however, widely accepted that single-marker-based analyses have limited power to identify the genetic basis of a given trait, as, for example, many loci will fail to reach stringent genome-wide significance threshold, despite the fact that they may be genuinely associated with the trait. Triggered by statistical approaches for the analysis of gene expression and protein-protein interaction, gene set-based analytical methods have recently become available. These methods aim at identifying biologically meaningful sets of genes associated with a certain trait, rather than focusing on a single GWAS gene locus (Wang et al., 2010Wang K. Li M. Hakonarson H.

We performed genome-wide gene set enrichment analyses of WM performance in multiple independent data sets of young and aged cognitively healthy subjects. In a large case-control sample, we also performed genome-wide gene set enrichment analyses of the risk for schizophrenia. We show that the voltage-gated cation channel activity gene set, consisting of genes related to neuronal excitability, is robustly linked to WM performance across ages and to schizophrenia. In addition, this gene set is associated to WM-related activity in brain regions known for their involvement in psychiatric disease. After genome-wide calculation of p values for association with WM performance (n-back task, see Experimental Procedures) under the additive genetic model in 905 individuals, we ran gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using MAGENTA (Segrè et al., 2010Segrè A.V.

DIAGRAM ConsortiumMAGIC investigatorsCommon inherited variation in mitochondrial genes is not enriched for associations with type 2 diabetes or related glycemic traits.PLoS Genet. 2010; 6: 6Crossref Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Q-Q plotting indicated that the statistical power of the sample was sufficient to detect loci reaching genome-wide significance (p < 5 × 10−8) (Figure S1A available online). Five SNPs exceeded genome-wide significance (Figure 1). Four SNPs (rs711159, rs2049590, rs7300145, and rs10861993) mapped to chromosome 12 and spanned PAWR, which encodes a neuronally expressed transcriptional regulator. One SNP (rs12028754) mapped to chromosome 1, specifically to an intron of OLFM3, which encodes olfactomedin 3 (alias noelin 3). This protein is known to interact with the AMPA receptor complex. Among the 1,411 database-derived gene sets that served as input, MAGENTA identified multiple testing-corrected significant enrichment (PFDR < 0.05) for two gene sets: “voltage-gated cation channel activity” (Gene Ontology ID [GO]:0022843) and “transport of glucose and other sugars, bile salts and organic acids, metal ions, and amine compounds” (gene set database: Reactome; Pnominal = 9.9 × 10−5 and 9.9 × 10−5, respectively; see Table 1). The contribution to the overall significance of the gene sets was balanced across significant gene set SNPs (Figure 2; Table S1). No additional gene set withstood false-discovery rate (FDR) correction for testing 1,411 gene sets.Table 1Pathway Associations in Four GWAS Data Sets of Cognitively Healthy AdultsDatabaseGene SetNumber of Significant GenesDiscovery Sample (n = 905)Replication Sample (n = 746)Zurich Sample (n = 410)AgeCoDe Sample (n = 763)PnominalPFDRPnominalPFDRPnominalPnominalGOVoltage-gated cation channel activity289.90 × 10−53.19 × 10−2aSignificance after genome-wide correction.9.90 × 10−51.28 × 10−2aSignificance after genome-wide correction.2.00 × 10−31.68 × 10−2REACTOMETransport of glucose and other sugars, bile salts and organic acids, metal ions and amine compounds359.90 × 10−53.10 × 10−2aSignificance after genome-wide correction.1.90 × 10−15.65 × 10−11.48 × 10−12.08 × 10−1GOVoltage-gated channel activity281.00 × 10−49.10 × 10−29.90 × 10−51.85 × 10−2aSignificance after genome-wide correction.6.20 × 10−31.11 × 10−2GOMetal ion transmembrane transporter activity513.00 × 10−45.69 × 10−21.80 × 10−31.45 × 10−19.00 × 10−42.20 × 10−2KEGGArrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy297.00 × 10−47.64 × 10−25.35 × 10−24.23 × 10−12.90 × 10−22.99 × 10−1GOCation channel activity401.40 × 10−31.71 × 10−19.90 × 10−51.28 × 10−2aSignificance after genome-wide correction.9.40 × 10−32.50 × 10−2GOCalcium channel activity151.70 × 10−31.64 × 10−14.06 × 10−25.72 × 10−18.67 × 10−26.12 × 10−1REACTOMESignaling by Rho GTPases362.20 × 10−31.59 × 10−12.30 × 10−31.23 × 10−11.00 × 10−33.98 × 10−2GOGated channel activity392.40 × 10−32.00 × 10−11.00 × 10−31.22 × 10−11.53 × 10−21.90 × 10−3GOTransmembrane receptor protein kinase activity212.50 × 10−32.09 × 10−13.95 × 10−19.11 × 10−11.79 × 10−23.01 × 10−1GOIon channel activity452.80 × 10−32.46 × 10−17.00 × 10−49.30 × 10−25.64 × 10−22.31 × 10−2REACTOMESignaling by robo receptor143.10 × 10−31.73 × 10−15.49 × 10−22.98 × 10−11.18 × 10−12.06 × 10−1KEGGDilated cardiomyopathy313.40 × 10−31.39 × 10−13.03 × 10−24.95 × 10−12.51 × 10−22.45 × 10−1GOCalmodulin binding123.40 × 10−31.72 × 10−19.37 × 10−19.76 × 10−14.74 × 10−13.03 × 10−1KEGGAdherens junction283.80 × 10−31.08 × 10−12.09 × 10−16.27 × 10−12.31 × 10−16.32 × 10−1REACTOMEIntegrin cell surface interactions294.00 × 10−32.18 × 10−18.40 × 10−23.96 × 10−13.92 × 10−12.99 × 10−2GOLamellipodium124.00 × 10−31.83 × 10−11.99 × 10−18.58× 10−11.06 × 10−11.86 × 10−1REACTOMERegulation of IFNA signaling64.30 × 10−31.83 × 10−16.34 × 10−17.61 × 10−11.63 × 10−13.92 × 10−1REACTOMETransport of inorganic cations/anions and amino acids/oligopeptides314.80 × 10−32.76 × 10−18.08 × 10−23.97 × 10−19.92 × 10−21.97 × 10−1REACTOMECell surface interactions at the vascular wall295.00 × 10−32.73 × 10−16.33 × 10−18.10 × 10−14.16 × 10−14.06 × 10−2GOCell cortex part125.10 × 10−31.93 × 10−11.08 × 10−16.99 × 10−11.96 × 10−11.98 × 10−1GOLeading edge186.70 × 10−32.30 × 10−13.46 × 10−19.70 × 10−13.11 × 10−11.22 × 10−1GOProtein tyrosine kinase activity236.90 × 10−32.33 × 10−13.82 × 10−19.02 × 10−11.45 × 10−12.18 × 10−1GOCortical cytoskeleton107.60 × 10−32.41 × 10−11.78 × 10−18.19 × 10−13.35 × 10−13.40 × 10−1REACTOMEL1cam interactions288.60 × 10−33.08 × 10−12.33 × 10−22.25 × 10−16.30 × 10−31.80 × 10−3Pnominal, uncorrected values; PFDR, genome-wide corrected values (FDR).a Significance after genome-wide correction.

A second independent gene set analysis on the identical phenotype (n-back task) was performed in 746 individuals by using the same MAGENTA settings as in the discovery sample. Among the 1,411 database-derived gene sets tested, the voltage-gated cation channel activity gene set (GO:0022843) was the best hit, showing significant enrichment at a genome-wide FDR-corrected level (Pnominal = 9.9 × 10−5, PFDR = 1.28 × 10−2). Furthermore, the cation channel activity gene set and the voltage-gated channel activity gene set, two gene sets highly overlapping with GO:0022843 (59% and 90% overlap, respectively), also showed significant enrichment in the replication sample (PFDR = 1.28 × 10−2 and 1.85 × 10−2, respectively; see Table 1). To assess whether the identified gene set is detected independently of the algorithm used, we used different gene set analysis tools in the combined discovery and replication samples (n = 1,651), for which the identical cognitive task served as phenotype. GSA-SNP is a gene set tool that uses SNP p values as input and identifies pathways in a competitive way (Nam et al., 2010Nam D. Kim J. Kim S.Y. Kim S. GSA-SNP: a general approach for gene set analysis of polymorphisms.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: W749-W754Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Importantly, GSA-SNP offers the option to set the kth (k = 2, 3, 4, or 5) best p value as proxy for the respective gene instead of using only the best p value. We ran four analyses, and for each option the voltage-gated cation channel activity gene set (GO:0022843) showed a highly significant enrichment score, with FDR-corrected p values ranging between PFDR = 1 × 10−8 and PFDR = 4 × 10−8. INRICH (Lee et al., 2012Lee P.H. O’Dushlaine C. Thomas B. Purcell S.M. INRICH: interval-based enrichment analysis for genome-wide association studies.Bioinformatics. 2012; 28: 1797-1799Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), another gene set tool, implements a permutation-based algorithm to correct for possible biases induced by marker density, linkage disequilibrium (LD) structure, and gene size. Of 449 independent intervals that contained the best genome-wide association signals, nine intervals overlapped with the 66 target genes of GO:0022843. Subsequent permutation analysis (100,000 permutations) showed significant enrichment for GO:0022384 (Pempirical = 0.018). We also performed additional genome-wide analyses and subsequent GSEA for non-WM phenotypes, such as performance in the 0-back task (related to attentional processes), picture and verbal delayed free recall (related to episodic memory), and delayed free recall for positive and negative pictures (related to emotional memory, see Experimental Procedures). GO:0022843 did not show any enrichment for these phenotypes (all Pnominal > 0.05). In an independent sample of Swiss young adults (n = 410), we performed GSEA on another WM-related phenotype (digit span forward). Despite the smaller sample size, we detected significant enrichment of the voltage-gated cation channel activity gene set (GO:0022843) (Pnominal = 2.0 × 10−3; see Table 1). This sample of cognitively healthy elderly individuals (n = 763) was included to study whether the observed association of the voltage-gated cation channel activity gene set with cognitive performance depends on age. In analogy to the discovery and replication samples, we used MAGENTA to calculate gene set enrichment for immediate verbal free recall performance. WM capacity is one of the cognitive components necessary to perform this task, which also includes a learning component across trials. The voltage-gated cation channel activity gene set showed significant enrichment (Pnominal = 1.68 × 10−2; see Table 1). No gene set was significant at an FDR-corrected level of significance (all PFDR > 0.05). Because WM deficits are commonly observed in schizophrenia, we investigated whether GSEA would identify the voltage-gated cation channel activity gene set as related to the risk for schizophrenia. p values of 9.8 million autosomal SNPs from a publicly available meta-analysis (Sweden 1-6 case-control study with the 2011 Psychiatric GWAS Consortium [PGC] SCZ report [Ripke et al., 2011Ripke S.

MAGENTA was run with the identical parameters as before, except for the annotation, which was done with genome build NCBI36 (hg18). In this data set of patients with schizophrenia, we observed a robust replication of the voltage-gated cation channel activity gene set, both on a nominal and a genome-wide FDR-corrected level of significance (Pnominal = 9.9 × 10−5;; PFDR = 1.48 × 10−2; see Table S2). In an additional experiment, conducted in a subgroup (n = 707) of the replication sample, fMRI was used to identify gene set-independent and gene set-dependent differences in brain activity related to WM (i.e., n-back task, see Experimental Procedures). Independently of genotype, we detected highly robust task-related activations in the premotor cortex, prefrontal cortex, frontal poles, parietal cortex, cerebellum, thalamus, and insula (Figures 3A and 3B ; Table S3) being consistent with meta-analyses of fMRI studies using the n-back task (Owen et al., 2005Owen A.M.

Neurosci. 2003; 3: 255-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (1448) Google Scholar). To capture the multiallelic effect of GO:0022843 on brain activity related to WM, PLINK was used to generate an individual multilocus genetic score. The score comprises 29 SNPs from an equal number of the significant genes from the voltage-gated cation channel activity gene set (see Table S4). As in the GSEA, genes were represented by one SNP. SNPs were not intercorrelated. The genetic score of individuals carrying none of the reference alleles was set equal to 0, which corresponds to the lowest possible score value. Homozygosity for the reference allele (i.e., minor) was given a value of 2; heterozygous state was given a value of 1. The score was then weighted by the direction of effect (see the Experimental Procedures section for a detailed description). Genetic score-dependent analysis revealed a family-wise error (FWE) multiple comparison-corrected positive correlation between genetic score values and a large activity cluster in the superior parietal and supramarginal cortices (peak activation at [−16.5, −66, 52]; t = 5.04; Puncorrected = 5.9 × 10−7, Pwhole-brain-FWE-corrected = 0.0063, Figure 4A; Table 2; genotype-independent task-related activation at this coordinate t = 43.50) as well as a positive correlation with activity in the right cerebellum (peak activation at [13.75, −55, −48]; t = 4.55; Puncorrected = 6.31 × 10−6, Pwhole-brain-FWE-corrected = 0.049, Figure 4B; genotype-independent task-related activation at this coordinate t = 18). At a lower statistical threshold (Puncorrected < 0.001), 768 voxels showed positive correlation with the multilocus genetic score (Table S5). No voxel correlated with the genetic score in the opposite direction at an FWE-corrected level.Table 2Genetic Score-Dependent ActivationNumber of ClusterMaximum t Value within ClusterRegional Correspondence of the MaximumMNI Coordinates at MaximumNumber of Voxelsxyz15.041ctx-lh-superiorparietal (51%), ctx-lh-precuneus (2%)−16.5−66522024.9071ctx-lh-supramarginal (28%), ctx-lh-superiorparietal (19%), ctx-lh-postcentral (10%)−41.25−38.548934.6694ctx-rh-superiorparietal (4%), ctx-rh-precuneus (2%)16.5−60.548144.5526Right-cerebellum-cortex (81%), right-cerebellum-white-matter, (19%), lobule IX (51%)aThe anatomical location of the voxel has been determined by using a probabilistic atlas of the cerebellum as implemented in the SPM anatomy toolbox (Diedrichsen, 2006).13.75−55−481Voxels demonstrating a positive correlation with the genetic score of 29 polymorphic positions (Pwhole-brain-FWE-corrected < 0.05).

We conducted a mediator analysis (Preacher and Hayes, 2008Preacher K.J. Hayes A.F. Asymptotic and resampling strategies for assessing and comparing indirect effects in multiple mediator models.Behav.

The correlation between the genetic score and WM performance was significant (r = 0.43, p = 3.9 × 10−31). The magnitude of this effect size is due to the nature of the multilocus genetic score, which represents the total load with alleles selected a priori for their significant association with WM performance. The correlation between the genetic score and WM performance was slightly, albeit significantly, mediated by activity in the left superior parietal and supramarginal cortices [−16.5, −66, 52] (r = 0.017, p < 0.005). We did not observe a significant mediation effect of activity in the right cerebellum [13.75, −55, −48] (r = 0.007, p > 0.1; see also Experimental Procedures and Figure S2). To examine whether our imaging genetic findings were specific to the WM task, we also analyzed the correlation between genetic score values and activity during an episodic memory task (subsequent memory analysis, Dm, see Experimental Procedures). We did not observe any FWE-corrected correlations. In order to confirm that the fMRI results were not driven by structural changes related to the gene set, we performed a voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis of relative gray matter volume (after correction for individual brain size). We did not observe a significant effect of the genetic score on gray matter volume either at a whole-brain or at a small volume-corrected significance threshold. Small volume correction was applied for all regions and clusters showing significant, (1) score-independent or (2) score-dependent activations in the WM task. We also used psychophysiological interaction (PPI) as described previously (Rasch et al., 2009Rasch B. Spalek K. Buholzer S. Luechinger R. Boesiger P. Papassotiropoulos A. de Quervain D.J. A genetic variation of the noradrenergic system is related to differential amygdala activation during encoding of emotional memories.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 19191-19196Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) to analyze the functional connectivity between a seed region and all other areas of the brain. Seed regions were (1) the superior parietal cortex and (2) the cerebellum. The resulting connectivity maps were then associated with the genetic score. In both analyses, connectivity did not significantly correlate with genetic score values at a whole-brain-corrected level. To further investigate the score-independent relation of brain activity and WM performance, we conducted a regression analysis in the fMRI sample. Whole-brain analysis revealed that only one activity cluster (MNI coordinates at maximum: −19.25, −66, 52; Table S6) was associated significantly with WM performance at a whole-brain-corrected threshold (t = 5.2, Pwhole-brain-FWE-corrected < 0.05). The correlation was positive. Importantly, this activity cluster was located in the left superior parietal cortex, the same region that also showed significant gene score-dependent activations. No voxels correlated negatively with performance at an FWE-corrected level. Use of a liberal significance threshold (Puncorrected < 0.001) revealed the existence of several activation clusters correlating with WM performance in both directions (Table S6). We detected a robust association of the voltage-gated cation channel activity gene set (GO:0022843) with WM and WM-dependent traits in both young and elderly cognitively healthy individuals in four independent samples. Despite substantial methodological differences between gene set enrichment tools (e.g., statistical power and control for type I error), we could also demonstrate that the association of the voltage-gated cation channel activity gene set with WM is significant independently of the applied algorithm. This finding is compatible with the physiological role of voltage-gated cation channel activity: voltage-gated ion channels, and particularly cation channels, are the major determinants of the active electrical properties of neurons, such as excitability (Llinás, 1988Llinás R.R. The intrinsic electrophysiological properties of mammalian neurons: insights into central nervous system function.Science. 1988; 242: 1654-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar), which are crucial for the proper function of the WM network (Goldman-Rakic, 1996Goldman-Rakic P.S. Regional and cellular fractionation of working memory.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1996; 93: 13473-13480Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). In accordance with our findings, single variation in genes of the voltage-gated cation channel activity gene set, such as KCNH2, KCNB2, and CACNA1C, has been recently associated with WM performance (Cirulli et al., 2010Cirulli E.T.

https://openalex.org/W1965244636,"Chronic inflammation is an established risk factor for the onset of cancer, and the inflammatory cytokine IL-6 has a role in tumorigenesis by enhancing proliferation and hindering apoptosis. As factors stimulating proliferation also downregulate p53 expression by enhancing ribosome biogenesis, we hypothesized that IL-6 may cause similar changes in inflamed tissues, thus activating a mechanism that favors neoplastic transformation. Here, we showed that IL-6 downregulated the expression and activity of p53 in transformed and untransformed human cell lines. This was the consequence of IL-6-dependent stimulation of c-MYC mRNA translation, which was responsible for the upregulation of rRNA transcription. The enhanced rRNA transcription stimulated the MDM2-mediated proteasomal degradation of p53, by reducing the availability of ribosome proteins for MDM2 binding. The p53 downregulation induced the acquisition of cellular phenotypic changes characteristic of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, such as a reduced level of E-cadherin expression, increased cell invasiveness and a decreased response to cytotoxic stresses. We found that these changes also occurred in colon epithelial cells of patients with ulcerative colitis, a very representative example of chronic inflammation at high risk for tumor development. Histochemical and immunohistochemical analysis of colon biopsy samples showed an upregulation of ribosome biogenesis, a reduced expression of p53, together with a focal reduction or absence of E-cadherin expression in chronic colitis in comparison with normal mucosa samples. These changes disappeared after treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs. Taken together, the present results highlight a new mechanism that may link chronic inflammation to cancer, based on p53 downregulation, which is activated by the enhancement of rRNA transcription upon IL-6 exposure."
https://openalex.org/W2060022144,"Somatic mutations or deletions of TP53 and PTEN in ductal carcinoma in situ lesions have been implicated in progression to invasive ductal carcinomas. A recent molecular and mutational analysis of breast cancers revealed that inactivation of tumor suppressors, p53 and PTEN, are strongly associated with triple negative breast cancer. In addition, these tumor suppressors have important roles in regulating self-renewal in normal and malignant stem cells. To investigate their role in breast carcinogenesis, we knocked down these genes in human mammary cells and in non-transformed MCF10A cells. p53 and PTEN knockdown synergized to activate pro-inflammatory interleukin-6 (IL6)/Stat3/nuclear factor κB signaling. This resulted in generation of highly metastatic epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition-like cancer stem cells resulting in tumors whose gene expression profile mimicked that found in basal/claudin-low molecular subtype within the triple negative breast tumors. Constitutive activation of this loop in transformed cells was dependent on proteolytic degradation of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) resulting in low levels of this protein in basal/claudin-low cell lines and primary tumors. In non-transformed cells, transient activation of the IL6 inflammatory loop induced SOCS3 expression leading to pathway inactivation. In transformed cells, enforced expression of SOCS3 or interfering with IL6 pathway via IL6R blockade inhibited tumor growth and metastasis in mouse xenograft models. Furthermore, circulating tumor cells were significantly reduced in tumor-bearing animals when treated with anti-IL6R antibodies. These studies uncover important connections between inflammation and carcinogenesis and suggest that blocking pro-inflammatory cytokines may be utilized as an attractive strategy to target triple negative breast tumors, which currently lacks molecularly targeted therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2165702516,"Eukaryotic initiation factor 2B (eIF2B) is the guanine nucleotide exchange factor for eIF2 and a critical regulator of protein synthesis, (e.g., as part of the integrated stress response). Certain mutations in the EIF2B genes cause leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter (VWM), an often serious neurological disorder. Comprising 5 subunits, α–ε (eIF2Bε being the catalytic one), eIF2B has always been considered an αβγδε heteropentamer. We have analyzed the subunit interactions within mammalian eIF2B by using a combination of mass spectrometry and in vivo studies of overexpressed complexes to gain further insight into the subunit arrangement of the complex. Our data reveal that eIF2B is actually decameric, a dimer of eIF2B(βγδε) tetramers stabilized by 2 copies of eIF2Bα. We also demonstrate a pivotal role for eIF2Bδ in the formation of eIF2B(βγδε) tetramers. eIF2B(αβγδε)2 decamers show greater binding to eIF2 than to eIF2B(βγδε) tetramers, which may underlie the increased activity of the former. We examined the levels of eIF2B subunits in a panel of different mouse tissues and identified different levels of eIF2B subunits, particularly eIF2Bα, which implies heterogeneity in the cellular proportions of eIF2B(αβγδε) and eIF2B(βγδε) complexes, with important implications for the regulation of translation in individual cell types.—Wortham, N. C., Martinez, M., Gordiyenko, Y., Robinson, C. V., Proud, C. G. Analysis of the subunit organization of the eIF2B complex reveals new insights into its structure and regulation.

https://openalex.org/W2162568227,"Formation of Bacillus subtilis biofilms, consisting of cells encapsulated within an extracellular matrix of exopolysaccharide and protein, requires the polyamine spermidine. A recent study reported that (1) related polyamine norspermidine is synthesized by B. subtilis using the equivalent of the Vibrio cholerae biosynthetic pathway, (2) exogenous norspermidine at 25 μM prevents B. subtilis biofilm formation, (3) endogenous norspermidine is present in biofilms at 50–80 μM, and (4) norspermidine prevents biofilm formation by condensing biofilm exopolysaccharide. In contrast, we find that, at concentrations up to 200 μM, exogenous norspermidine promotes biofilm formation. We find that norspermidine is absent in wild-type B. subtilis biofilms at all stages, and higher concentrations of exogenous norspermidine eventually inhibit planktonic growth and biofilm formation in an exopolysaccharide-independent manner. Moreover, orthologs of the V. cholerae norspermidine biosynthetic pathway are absent from B. subtilis, confirming that norspermidine is not physiologically relevant to biofilm function in this species."
https://openalex.org/W1992428015,"Nonribosomal peptide synthetases are versatile engines of bioactive natural product biosynthesis that function according to the multiple carrier thiotemplate mechanism. C-terminal thioesterase (TE) domains of these giant modular proteins typically catalyze product release by hydrolysis or macrocyclization. We now report an unprecedented, dual-function TE that is involved in the biosynthesis of nocardicin A, which is the paradigm monocyclic β-lactam antibiotic. Contrary to our expectation, a stereodefined series of potential peptide substrates for the nocardicin TE domain failed to undergo hydrolysis. The stringent discrimination against peptide intermediates was overcome by prior monocyclic β-lactam formation at an L-seryl site. Kinetic data are interpreted such that the TE domain acts as a gatekeeper to hold the assembling peptide on an upstream domain until β-lactam formation takes place and then rapidly catalyzes epimerization, which has not been observed previously as a TE catalytic function, and thioesterase cleavage to discharge a fully fledged pentapeptide β-lactam harboring nocardicin G, the universal precursor of the nocardicins."
https://openalex.org/W2028691804,"Aberrant cell surface sialylation patterns have been shown to correlate with tumor progression and metastasis. However, the role of sialylation regulation of cancer multidrug resistance (MDR) remains poorly understood. This study investigated sialylation in modification on MDR in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Using mass spectrometry (MS) analysis, the composition profiling of sialylated N-glycans differed in three pairs of AML cell lines. Real-time PCR showed the differential expressional profiles of 20 sialyltransferase (ST) genes in the both AML cell lines and bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs) of AML patients. The expression levels of ST3GAL5 and ST8SIA4 were detected, which were overexpressed in HL60 and HL60/adriamycin-resistant (ADR) cells. The altered levels of ST3GAL5 and ST8SIA4 were found in close association with the MDR phenotype changing of HL60 and HL60/ADR cells both in vitro and in vivo. Further data demonstrated that manipulation of these two genes' expression modulated the activity of phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway and its downstream target thus regulated the proportionally mutative expression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and MDR-related protein 1 (MRP1), both of which are known to be involved in MDR. Blocking the PI3K/Akt pathway by its specific inhibitor LY294002 or by Akt small interfering RNA resulted in the reduced chemosensitivity of HL60/ADR cells. Therefore, this study indicated that sialylation involved in the development of MDR of AML cells probably through ST3GAL5 or ST8SIA4 regulating the activity of PI3K/Akt signaling and the expression of P-gp and MRP1."

https://openalex.org/W2012086249,"High expression of Ankyrin Repeat Domain 1 (ANKRD1) in ovarian carcinoma is associated with poor survival, and in ovarian cancer cell lines is associated with platinum resistance. Importantly, decreasing ANKRD1 expression using siRNA increases cisplatin sensitivity. In this study, we investigated possible mechanisms underlying the association of ANKRD1 with cisplatin response. We first demonstrated that cisplatin-induced apoptosis in ovarian cancer cell lines was associated with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, evidenced by induction of Glucose-Regulated Protein 78 (GRP78), growth arrest- and DNA damage-inducible gene 153 (GADD153) and increased intracellular Ca2+ release. The level of sensitivity to cisplatin-induced apoptosis was associated with ANKRD1 protein levels and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage. COLO 316 ovarian cancer cells, which express high ANKRD1 levels, were relatively resistant to cisplatin, and ER stress-induced apoptosis, whereas OAW42 and PEO14 cells, which express lower ANKRD1 levels, are more sensitive to ER stress-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, we show that overexpression of ANKRD1 attenuated cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity, and conversely siRNA knockdown of ANKRD1 sensitized ovarian cancer cells to cisplatin and ER stress-induced apoptosis associated with induction of GADD153, and downregulation of BCL2 and BCL-XL. Taken together, these results suggest that ANKRD1 has a significant role in the regulation of apoptosis in human ovarian cancer cells, and is a potential molecular target to enhance sensitivity of ovarian cancer to chemotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2058347587,"Recent studies suggest that physiological and tumorigenic proliferation of mammalian cells is controlled by multiple cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) largely in tissue-specific manners. We and others previously demonstrated that adult mice deficient for the Cyclin D partner CDK4 (Cdk4(-/-) mice) exhibit hypoplasia in the pituitary and pancreatic islet due to primary postnatal defects in proliferation. Intriguingly, those neuroendocrine tissues affected in Cdk4(-/-) mice are the primary targets of tumorigenesis in the syndrome of multiple endocrine neoplasia type-1 (MEN1). Mice with heterozygous disruption of the tumor suppressor Men1 gene (Men1(+/-)) develop tumors in the pituitary, pancreatic islets and other neuroendocrine tissues, which is analogous to humans with MEN1 mutations. To explore the genetic interactions between loss of Men1 and activation of CDKs, we examined the impact of Cdk4 or Cdk2 disruption on tumorigenesis in Men1(+/-) mice. A majority of Men1(+/-) mice with wild-type CDKs developed pituitary and islet tumors by 15 months of age. Strikingly, Men1(+/-); Cdk4(-/-) mice did not develop any tumors, and their islets and pituitaries remained hypoplastic with decreased proliferation. In contrast, Men1(+/-); Cdk2(-/-) mice showed pituitary and islet tumorigenesis comparable to those in Men1(+/-) mice. Pituitaries of Men1(+/-); Cdk4(-/-) mice showed no signs of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in the Men1 locus, whereas tumors in Men1(+/-) mice and Men1(+/-); Cdk2(-/-) mice exhibited LOH. Consistently, CDK4 knockdown in INS-1 insulinoma cells inhibited glucose-stimulated cell cycle progression with a significant decrease in phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (RB) at specific sites including Ser780. CDK2 knockdown had minimum effects on RB phosphorylation and cell cycle progression. These data suggest that CDK4 is a critical downstream target of MEN1-dependent tumor suppression and is required for tumorigenic proliferation in the pituitary and pancreatic islet, whereas CDK2 is dispensable for tumorigenesis in these neuroendocrine cell types."
https://openalex.org/W2119141156,"Accumulation of the homocysteine (Hcy) precursor S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) may cause cellular hypomethylation in the setting of hyperhomocysteinemia because of cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) deficiency, an inborn error of metabolism. To test this hypothesis, DNA and protein arginine methylation status were assessed in liver, brain, heart, and kidney obtained from a previously described mouse model of CBS deficiency. Metabolite levels in tissues and serum were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography or liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. Global DNA and protein arginine methylation status were evaluated as the contents of 5-methyldeoxycytidine in DNA and of methylarginines in proteins, respectively. In addition, histone arginine methylation was assessed by Western blotting. CBS-deficient mice exhibited increased (>6-fold) Hcy and AdoHcy levels in all tissues examined compared with control levels. In addition, global DNA methylation status was not affected, but global protein arginine methylation status was decreased (10-35%) in liver and brain. Moreover, asymmetric dimethylation of arginine 3 on histone H4 (H4R3me2a) content was markedly decreased in liver, and no differences were observed for the other histone arginine methylation marks examined. Our results show that CBS-deficient mice present severe accumulation of tissue Hcy and AdoHcy, protein arginine hypomethylation in liver and brain, and decreased H4R3me2a content in liver. Therefore, protein arginine hypomethylation arises as a potential player in the pathophysiology of CBS deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2164531289,"Phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) regulates phospholipid transport in the circulation and is highly expressed within the lung epithelium, where it is secreted into the alveolar space. Since PLTP expression is increased in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), this study aimed to determine how PLTP affects lung signaling and inflammation. Despite its increased expression, PLTP activity decreased by 80% in COPD bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) due to serine protease cleavage, primarily by cathepsin G. Likewise, PLTP BALF activity levels decreased by 20 and 40% in smoke-exposed mice and in the media of smoke-treated small airway epithelial (SAE) cells, respectively. To assess how PLTP affected inflammatory responses in a lung injury model, PLTP siRNA or recombinant protein was administered to the lungs of mice prior to LPS challenge. Silencing PLTP at baseline caused a 68% increase in inflammatory cell infiltration, a 120 and 340% increase in ERK and NF-κB activation, and increased MMP-9, IL1β and IFN-γ levels after LPS treatment by 39, 140, and 190%, respectively. Conversely, PLTP protein administration countered these effects in this model. Thus, these findings establish a novel anti-inflammatory function of PLTP in the lung and suggest that proteolytic cleavage of PLTP by cathepsin G may enhance the injurious inflammatory responses that occur in COPD.—Brehm, A., Geraghty, P., Campos, M., Garcia-Arcos, I., Dabo, A.

https://openalex.org/W2000270131,"The S100 protein family represents the largest subgroup of calcium binding EF-hand type proteins. These proteins have been reported to be involved in a wide range of biological functions that are related to normal cell development and tumorigenesis. S100A14 is a recently identified member of the S100 protein family and differentially expressed in a number of different human malignancies. However, the transcriptional regulation of S100A14 and its role in breast cancer needs to be further investigated. Here, we determined that 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) up-regulated the expression of KLF4 and facilitated its binding directly to two conserved GC-rich DNA segments within the S100A14 promoter, which is essential for the transactivation of KLF4 induced S100A14 expression. Furthermore, stable silencing of KLF4 significantly suppressed breast cancer cell migration induced by TPA. Collectively, these results offer insights into the fact that TPA provokes cell motility through regulating the expression and function of S100A14 in a KLF4-dependent manner."

https://openalex.org/W2071187780,"Chromosome ends are protected by telomeres that prevent DNA damage response and degradation. Telomerase expression extends telomeres and inhibits DNA damage response. Telomeres are also maintained by the recombination-based alternative lengthening pathway. Telomerase is believed to be the sole mechanism for telomere maintenance in the epidermis. We show that basal cells in the epidermis maintain telomeres both by telomerase and alternative lengthening of telomere (ALT) mechanisms in vivo. ALT was detected in epidermal stem cells in Terc−/− mice, and normal human epidermal keratinocytes are also ALT-positive. The ALT pathway is suppressed in primary, but not metastatic, epidermal squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) in Terc+/+ mice. The ALT pathway is expressed in stem cells and basal cells in epidermal SCC in Terc−/− mice, and in some telomerase-positive human SCC lines. Telomeres shorten markedly in stem cells and basal cells in epidermal SCC in vivo. Telomere shortening is associated with telomeric DNA damage response and apoptosis in stem cells and basal cells. Stem cells were transformed in both primary and metastatic epidermal SCC. Genetic ablation of this small cell population resulted in significant tumor regression in vivo. We concluded that alternative lengthening of telomeres is important in epidermal homeostasis and tumorigenesis in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2078973526,"Interferon regulatory factor (IRF) family members have been implicated as critical transcription factors that function in immune responses, hematopoietic differentiation, and cell growth regulation. Activation of IRF5 results in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα, IL6, and IL12, as well as type I interferons. In this study, we demonstrate that HIV-2 Vpx interacts with IRF5, and Vpx inhibits IRF5-mediated transactivation. Expression of Vpx in THP-1 cells reduced mRNA levels and protein production of Toll-like receptor-dependent IL6, IL12p40, and TNFα induced by lipopolysaccharide, R848, and ODN2216. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays show that Vpx expression results in decreased promoter binding activity of IRF5.

https://openalex.org/W2058963590,"The mouse is extensively used to model human folate metabolism and therapeutic outcomes with antifolates. However, the folylpoly-γ-glutamate synthetase (fpgs) gene, whose product determines folate/antifolate intracellular retention and antifolate antitumor activity, displays a pronounced species difference. The human gene uses only a single promoter, whereas the mouse uses two: P2, akin to the human promoter, at low levels in most tissues; and P1, an upstream promoter used extensively in liver and kidney. We deleted the mouse P1 promoter through homologous recombination to study the dual-promoter mouse system and to create a mouse with a humanized fpgs gene structure. Despite the loss of the predominant fpgs mRNA species in liver and kidney (representing 95 and 75% of fpgs transcripts in these tissues, respectively), P1-knockout mice developed and reproduced normally. The survival of these mice was explained by increased P2 transcription due to relief of transcriptional interference, by a 3-fold more efficient translation of P2-derived than P1-derived transcripts, and by 2-fold higher stability of P2-derived FPGS. In combination, all 3 effects reinstated FPGS function, even in liver. By eliminating mouse P1, we created a mouse model that mimicked the human housekeeping pattern of fpgs gene expression."
