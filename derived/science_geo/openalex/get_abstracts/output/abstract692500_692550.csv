https://openalex.org/W4224816971,"The rapid emergence of the B.1.1.529 (Omicron) variant of SARS-CoV-2 led to a global resurgence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Israeli authorities approved a fourth COVID-19 vaccine dose (second booster) for individuals aged 60 years and over who had received a first booster dose 4 or more months earlier. Evidence for the effectiveness of a second booster dose in reducing hospitalizations and mortality due to COVID-19 is warranted. This retrospective cohort study included all members of Clalit Health Services who were aged 60–100 years and who were eligible for the second booster on 3 January 2022. Hospitalizations and mortality due to COVID-19 in participants who received the second booster were compared with those for participants who received one booster dose. Cox proportional hazards regression models with time-dependent covariates were used to estimate the association between the second booster and hospitalization and death due to COVID-19 while adjusting for demographic factors and coexisting illnesses. A total of 563,465 participants met the eligibility criteria. Of those, 328,597 (58%) received a second booster dose during the 40 day study period. Hospitalization due to COVID-19 occurred in 270 of the second-booster recipients and in 550 participants who received one booster dose (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.36; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.31–0.43). Death due to COVID-19 occurred in 92 second-booster recipients and in 232 participants who received one booster dose (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.22; 95% CI: 0.17–0.28). This study demonstrates a substantial reduction in hospitalizations and deaths due to COVID-19 conferred by a second booster in Israeli adults aged 60 years and over. A retrospective analysis of data from a large healthcare insurance provider in Israel shows that a second booster shot (fourth dose) of BNT162b2 in people aged 60 years and over results in a substantial reduction in hospitalizations and deaths due to COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W4225746601,"Abstract Artificial intelligence (AI) can predict the presence of molecular alterations directly from routine histopathology slides. However, training robust AI systems requires large datasets for which data collection faces practical, ethical and legal obstacles. These obstacles could be overcome with swarm learning (SL), in which partners jointly train AI models while avoiding data transfer and monopolistic data governance. Here, we demonstrate the successful use of SL in large, multicentric datasets of gigapixel histopathology images from over 5,000 patients. We show that AI models trained using SL can predict BRAF mutational status and microsatellite instability directly from hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E)-stained pathology slides of colorectal cancer. We trained AI models on three patient cohorts from Northern Ireland, Germany and the United States, and validated the prediction performance in two independent datasets from the United Kingdom. Our data show that SL-trained AI models outperform most locally trained models, and perform on par with models that are trained on the merged datasets. In addition, we show that SL-based AI models are data efficient. In the future, SL can be used to train distributed AI models for any histopathology image analysis task, eliminating the need for data transfer."

https://openalex.org/W4224837766,"The low photostability of fluorescent proteins is a limiting factor in many applications of fluorescence microscopy. Here we present StayGold, a green fluorescent protein (GFP) derived from the jellyfish Cytaeis uchidae. StayGold is over one order of magnitude more photostable than any currently available fluorescent protein and has a cellular brightness similar to mNeonGreen. We used StayGold to image the dynamics of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) with high spatiotemporal resolution over several minutes using structured illumination microscopy (SIM) and observed substantially less photobleaching than with a GFP variant optimized for stability in the ER. Using StayGold fusions and SIM, we also imaged the dynamics of mitochondrial fusion and fission and mapped the viral spike proteins in fixed cells infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. As StayGold is a dimer, we created a tandem dimer version that allowed us to observe the dynamics of microtubules and the excitatory post-synaptic density in neurons. StayGold will substantially reduce the limitations imposed by photobleaching, especially in live cell or volumetric imaging."

However, the impact of digital remote monitoring systems in this setting has not been evaluated. Here, we report the results of a phase 3 trial (CAPRI, NCT02828462) to assess the impact of a nurse navigator-led program on treatment delivery for patients with metastatic cancer. Patients receiving approved oral anticancer agents were randomized (1:1) to an intervention combining a nurse navigator-led follow-up system and a web portal–smartphone application on top of usual care, or to usual symptom monitoring at the discretion of the treating oncologist, for a duration of 6 months. The primary objective included optimization of the treatment dose. Secondary objectives were grade ≥3 toxicities, patient experience, rates and duration of hospitalization, response and survival, and quality of life. In 559 evaluable patients the relative dose intensity was higher in the experimental arm (93.4% versus 89.4%, P = 0.04). The intervention improved the patient experience (Patient Assessment of Chronic Illness Care score, 2.94 versus 2.67, P = 0.01), reduced the days of hospitalization (2.82 versus 4.44 days, P = 0.02), and decreased treatment-related grade ≥3 toxicities (27.6% versus 36.9%, P = 0.02). These findings show that patient-centered care through remote monitoring of symptoms and treatment may improve patient outcomes and experience. The phase 3 CAPRI clinical trial evaluating the impact of a digital nurse navigator-led system in patients receiving oral anticancer treatment shows that remote monitoring using a smartphone app results in an improved patient care experience and optimizes healthcare resources."
https://openalex.org/W4224315257,"HOXB13, a homeodomain transcription factor, critically regulates androgen receptor (AR) activities and androgen-dependent prostate cancer (PCa) growth. However, its functions in AR-independent contexts remain elusive. Here we report HOXB13 interaction with histone deacetylase HDAC3, which is disrupted by the HOXB13 G84E mutation that has been associated with early-onset PCa. Independently of AR, HOXB13 recruits HDAC3 to lipogenic enhancers to catalyze histone deacetylation and suppress lipogenic regulators such as fatty acid synthase. Analysis of human tissues reveals that the HOXB13 gene is hypermethylated and downregulated in approximately 30% of metastatic castration-resistant PCa. HOXB13 loss or G84E mutation leads to lipid accumulation in PCa cells, thereby promoting cell motility and xenograft tumor metastasis, which is mitigated by pharmaceutical inhibition of fatty acid synthase. In summary, we present evidence that HOXB13 recruits HDAC3 to suppress de novo lipogenesis and inhibit tumor metastasis and that lipogenic pathway inhibitors may be useful to treat HOXB13-low PCa. HOXB13 suppresses a lipogenic transcriptional program in prostate cancer (PCa) through HDAC3 recruitment to enhancers. Loss of HOXB13 leads to lipid accumulation in PCa cells, promoting cell motility in vitro and xenograft tumor metastasis in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W4224862689,"It is currently unclear how the shift towards virtual care during the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic may have impacted chronic disease management at a population level. The goals of our study were to provide a description of the levels of use of virtual care services relative to in-person care in patients with chronic disease across Ontario, Canada and to describe levels of healthcare utilization in low versus high virtual care users.We used linked health administrative data to conduct a population-based, repeated cross-sectional study of all ambulatory patient visits in Ontario, Canada (January 1, 2018 to January 16, 2021). Further stratifications were also completed to examine patients with COPD, heart failure, asthma, hypertension, diabetes, mental illness, and angina. Patients were classified as low (max 1 virtual care visit) vs. high virtual care users. A time-series analysis was done using interventional autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) modelling on weekly hospitalizations, outpatient visits, and diagnostic tests.The use of virtual care increased across all chronic disease patient populations. Virtual care constituted at least half of the total care in all conditions. Both low and high virtual care user groups experienced a statistically significant reduction in hospitalizations and laboratory testing at the start of the pandemic. Hospitalization volumes increased again only among the high users, while testing increased in both groups. Outpatient visits among high users remained unaffected by the pandemic but dropped in low users.The decrease of in-person care during the pandemic was accompanied by an increase in virtual care, which ultimately allowed patients with chronic disease to return to the same visit rate as they had before the onset of the pandemic. Virtual care was adopted across various chronic conditions, but the relative adoption of virtual care varied by condition with highest rates seen in mental health."
https://openalex.org/W4224313132,"A decline in skeletal muscle mass and low muscular strength are prognostic factors in advanced human cancers. Here we found that breast cancer suppressed O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) protein modification in muscle through extracellular-vesicle-encapsulated miR-122, which targets O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT). Mechanistically, O-GlcNAcylation of ryanodine receptor 1 (RYR1) competed with NEK10-mediated phosphorylation and increased K48-linked ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation; the miR-122-mediated decrease in OGT resulted in increased RYR1 abundance. We further found that muscular protein O-GlcNAcylation was regulated by hypoxia and lactate through HIF1A-dependent OGT promoter activation and was elevated after exercise. Suppressed O-GlcNAcylation in the setting of cancer, through increasing RYR1, led to higher cytosolic Ca2+ and calpain protease activation, which triggered cleavage of desmin filaments and myofibrillar destruction. This was associated with reduced skeletal muscle mass and contractility in tumour-bearing mice. Our findings link O-GlcNAcylation to muscular protein homoeostasis and contractility and reveal a mechanism of cancer-associated muscle dysregulation."
https://openalex.org/W4224675640,"Cancer is the leading cause of death in dogs, yet there are no established screening paradigms for early detection. Liquid biopsy methods that interrogate cancer-derived genomic alterations in cell-free DNA in blood are being adopted for multi-cancer early detection in human medicine and are now available for veterinary use. The CANcer Detection in Dogs (CANDiD) study is an international, multi-center clinical study designed to validate the performance of a novel multi-cancer early detection “liquid biopsy” test developed for noninvasive detection and characterization of cancer in dogs using next-generation sequencing (NGS) of blood-derived DNA; study results are reported here. In total, 1,358 cancer-diagnosed and presumably cancer-free dogs were enrolled in the study, representing the range of breeds, weights, ages, and cancer types seen in routine clinical practice; 1,100 subjects met inclusion criteria for analysis and were used in the validation of the test. Overall, the liquid biopsy test demonstrated a 54.7% (95% CI: 49.3–60.0%) sensitivity and a 98.5% (95% CI: 97.0–99.3%) specificity. For three of the most aggressive canine cancers (lymphoma, hemangiosarcoma, osteosarcoma), the detection rate was 85.4% (95% CI: 78.4–90.9%); and for eight of the most common canine cancers (lymphoma, hemangiosarcoma, osteosarcoma, soft tissue sarcoma, mast cell tumor, mammary gland carcinoma, anal sac adenocarcinoma, malignant melanoma), the detection rate was 61.9% (95% CI: 55.3–68.1%). The test detected cancer signal in patients representing 30 distinct cancer types and provided a Cancer Signal Origin prediction for a subset of patients with hematological malignancies. Furthermore, the test accurately detected cancer signal in four presumably cancer-free subjects before the onset of clinical signs, further supporting the utility of liquid biopsy as an early detection test. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that NGS-based liquid biopsy can offer a novel option for noninvasive multi-cancer detection in dogs."

https://openalex.org/W4224861406,"Floods are among the devastating types of disasters in terms of human life, social and financial losses. Authoritative data from flood gauges are scarce in arid regions because of the specific type of dry climate that dysfunctions these measuring devices. Hence, social media data could be a useful tool in this case, where a wealth of information is available online. This study investigates the reliability of flood related data quality collected from social media, particularly for an arid region where the usage of flow gauges is limited. The data (text, images and videos) of social media, related to a flood event, was analyzed using the Machine Learning approach. For this reason, digital data (758 images and 1413 video frames) was converted into numeric values through ResNet50 model using the VGG-16 architecture. Numeric data of images, videos and text was further classified using different Machine Learning algorithms. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve and area under curve (AUC) methods were used to evaluate and compare the performance of the developed machine learning algorithms. This novel approach of studying the quality of social media data could be a reliable alternative in the absence of real-time flow gauges data. A flash flood that occurred in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) from March 7-11, 2016 was selected as the focus of this study. Random forest showed the highest accuracy of 80.18% among the five other classifiers for images and videos. Precipitation/rainfall data were used to validate social media data, which showed a significant relationship between rainfall and the number of posts. The validity of the machine learning models was assessed using the area under the curve, precision-recall curve, root mean square error, and kappa statistics to confirm the validity and accuracy of the model. The data quality of YouTube videos was found to have the highest accuracy followed by Facebook, Flickr, Twitter, and Instagram. These results showed that social media data could be used when gauge data is unavailable."
https://openalex.org/W4224936469,"The disassembly of integrin-containing focal adhesions (FAs) at mitotic entry is essential for cell rounding, mitotic retraction fibre formation, bipolar spindle positioning and chromosome segregation. The mechanism that drives FA disassembly at mitotic entry is unknown. Here, we show that the CDK1-cyclin B1 complex phosphorylates the integrin activator kindlin, which results in the recruitment of the cullin 9-FBXL10 ubiquitin ligase complex that mediates kindlin ubiquitination and degradation. This molecular pathway is essential for FA disassembly and cell rounding, as phospho-inhibitory mutations of the CDK1 motif prevent kindlin degradation, FA disassembly and mitotic cell rounding. Conversely, phospho-mimetic mutations promote kindlin degradation in interphase, accelerate mitotic cell rounding and impair mitotic retraction fibre formation. Despite the opposing effects on kindlin stability, both types of mutations cause severe mitotic spindle defects, apoptosis and aneuploidy. Thus, the exquisite regulation of kindlin levels at mitotic entry is essential for cells to progress accurately through mitosis."
https://openalex.org/W4224993507,"This paper demonstrates the application of hybrid energy system (HES) that comprises of photovoltaic (PV) array, battery storage system (BSS) and stand-by diesel generator (DGen) to mitigate the problem of load shedding. The main work involves techno-economic modelling to optimize the size of HES such that the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) is minimized. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to determine the optimum size of the components (PV, BSS). Simulations are performed in MATLAB using real dataset of irradiance, temperature and load shedding schedule of the small residential community situated in the city of Quetta, Pakistan. The LCOE for the HES system under study is 8.32 cents/kWh-which is lower than the conventional load shedding solution, namely the uninterruptable power supply (UPS) (13.06 cents/kWh) and diesel and generator system (29.19 cents/kWh). In fact, the LCOE of the HRES is lower than the grid electricity price of Pakistan (9.3 cents/kWh). Besides that, the HES alleviates the grid burden by 47.9% and 13.1% compared to the solution using the UPS and generator, respectively. The outcomes of the study suggests that HES is able to improve reliability and availability of electric power for regions that is affected by the load shedding issue."
https://openalex.org/W4224285548,"The protease SPRTN degrades DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs) that threaten genome stability. SPRTN has been connected to the ubiquitin-directed protein unfoldase p97 (also called VCP or Cdc48), but a functional cooperation has not been demonstrated directly. Here, we biochemically reconstituted p97-assisted proteolysis with purified proteins and showed that p97 targets ubiquitin-modified DPCs and unfolds them to prepare them for proteolysis by SPRTN. We demonstrate that purified SPRTN alone was unable to degrade a tightly-folded Eos fluorescent reporter protein even when Eos was crosslinked to DNA (Eos-DPC). However, when present, p97 unfolded poly-ubiquitinated Eos-DPC in a manner requiring its ubiquitin adapter, Ufd1-Npl4. Notably, we show that, in cooperation with p97 and Ufd1-Npl4, SPRTN proteolyzed unfolded Eos-DPC, which relied on recognition of the DNA-crosslink by SPRTN. In a simplified unfolding assay, we further demonstrate that p97, while unfolding a protein substrate, can surmount the obstacle of a DNA crosslink site in the substrate. Thus, our data demonstrate that p97, in conjunction with Ufd1-Npl4, assists SPRTN-mediated proteolysis of tightly-folded proteins crosslinked to DNA, even threading bulky protein-DNA adducts. These findings will be relevant for understanding how cells handle DPCs to ensure genome stability and for designing strategies that target p97 in combination cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W4224833259,"Chromogranin A (CgA) and its fragment vasostatin I (VS-I) are secreted in the blood by endocrine/neuroendocrine cells and regulate stress responses. Their involvement in Coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) has not been investigated.CgA and VS-I plasma concentrations were measured at hospital admission from March to May 2020 in 190 patients. 40 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers served as controls. CgA and VS-I levels relationship with demographics, comorbidities and disease severity was assessed through Mann Whitney U test or Spearman correlation test. Cox regression analysis and Kaplan Meier survival curves were performed to investigate the impact of the CgA and VS-I levels on in-hospital mortality.Median CgA and VS-I levels were higher in patients than in healthy controls (CgA: 0.558 nM [interquartile range, IQR 0.358-1.046] vs 0.368 nM [IQR 0.288-0.490] respectively, p = 0.0017; VS-I: 0.357 nM [IQR 0.196-0.465] vs 0.144 nM [0.144-0.156] respectively, p<0.0001). Concentration of CgA, but not of VS-I, significantly increased in patients who died (n = 47) than in survivors (n = 143) (median 0.948 nM [IQR 0.514-1.754] vs 0.507 nM [IQR 0.343-0.785], p = 0.00026). Levels of CgA were independent predictors of in-hospital mortality (hazard ratio 1.28 [95% confidence interval 1.077-1.522], p = 0.005) when adjusted for age, number of comorbidities, respiratory insufficiency degree, C-reactive protein levels and time from symptom onset to sampling. Kaplan Meier curves revealed a significantly increased mortality rate in patients with CgA levels above 0.558 nM (median value, log rank test, p = 0.001).Plasma CgA levels increase in COVID-19 patients and represent an early independent predictor of mortality."
https://openalex.org/W4225947488,"Interleukin-4 (IL-4) is a signature cytokine pivotal in Type 2 helper T cell (Th2) immune response, particularly in allergy and hypersensitivity. Interestingly, IL-4 increases endogenous levels of prostaglandin D2 (PGD2 ) and its metabolites, Δ12 -prostaglandin J2 (Δ12 -PGJ2 ) and 15-deoxy-Δ12,14 -prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2 ), collectively called cyclopentenone PGs (CyPGs). However, the therapeutic role of IL-4 in hematologic malignancies remains unclear. Here, we employed a murine model of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), where human MLL-AF9 fusion oncoprotein was expressed in hematopoietic progenitor cells, to test the effect of IL-4 treatment in vivo. Daily intraperitoneal treatment with IL-4 at 60 µg/kg/d significantly alleviated the severity of AML, as seen by decreased leukemia-initiating cells (LICs). The effect of IL-4 was mediated, in part, by the enhanced expression of hematopoietic- PGD2 synthase (H-PGDS) to effect endogenous production of CyPGs, through autocrine and paracrine signaling mechanisms. Similar results were seen with patient-derived AML cells cultured ex vivo with IL-4. Use of GW9662, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) antagonist, suggested endogenous CyPGs-PPARγ axis mediated p53-dependent apoptosis of LICs by IL-4. Taken together, our results reveal a beneficial role of IL-4 treatment in AML suggesting a potential therapeutic regimen worthy of clinical trials in patients with AML."
https://openalex.org/W4224442019,"Objective This study aimed to analyze the morphokinetic behaviour between conventional IVF and ICSI, in cycles with preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidies (PGT-A). Materials A randomized controlled trial (NCT03708991) was conducted in a private fertility center. Thirty couples with non-male factor infertility were recruited between November 2018 and April 2019. A total of 568 sibling cumulus oocyte complexes were randomly inseminated with conventional IVF and ICSI and cultured in an Embryoscope time-lapse system. The morphokinetic behaviour of IVF/ICSI sibling oocytes was analysed as primary endpoint. As secondary endpoints, morphokinetic parameters that predict blastocysts that will be biopsied, the day of biopsy, gender and euploid outcome was assessed. Results When comparing IVF to ICSI, only the time to reach the 2-cell stage (t2) was significantly delayed for IVF embryos: OR: 1.282 [1.020–1.612], p = 0.033. After standardizing for tPNf (ct parameters), only Blast(tStartBlastulation-t2) remained significant: OR: 0.803 [0.648–0.994], p = 0.044. For the analysis of zygotes that will be biopsied on day 5/6 versus zygotes without biopsy, only early morphokinetic parameters were considered. All parameters were different in the multivariate model: ct2: OR: 0.840 [0.709–0.996], p = 0.045; ct6: OR: 0.943 [0.890–0.998], p = 0.043; cc2(t3-t2): OR: 1.148 [1.044–1.263], p = 0.004; cc3(t5-t3): OR: 1.177 [1.107–1.251], p&lt;0.0001. When comparing the development between blastocysts biopsied on day 5 versus day 6, only three morphokinetic parameters were significant: cc2(t3-t2): OR: 1.394 [1.010–1.926], p = 0.044; ctBlastocyst: OR: 0.613 [0.489–0.768], p&lt;0.0001 and ctExpandedBlastocyst: OR: 0.913 [0.868–0.960], p = 0.0004. Multivariate analysis of gender and ploidy did not reveal differences in morphokinetic behaviour. Conclusion Minor morphokinetic differences are observed between IVF and ICSI. Early in the development, distinct cleavage patterns are observed between embryos that will be biopsied or not."

Several factors have been shown to regulate the activity of these receptors, including membrane potential and the concentration of sodium ions. Whether voltage and sodium regulate the activity of serotonergic receptors is unknown. Here, we used Xenopus oocytes as an expression system to examine the effects of voltage and of sodium ions on the potency of one subtype of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) receptor, the 5-HT1A receptor. We found that the potency of 5-HT in activating the receptor is voltage dependent and that it is higher at resting potential than under depolarized conditions. Furthermore, we found that removal of extracellular Na+ resulted in a decrease of 5-HT potency toward the 5-HT1A receptor and that a conserved aspartate in transmembrane domain 2 is crucial for this effect. Our results suggest that this allosteric effect of Na+ does not underlie the voltage dependence of this receptor. We propose that the characterization of modulatory factors that regulate this receptor may contribute to our future understanding of various physiological functions mediated by serotonergic transmission.

G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs), the largest protein family in the body, are of great physiological and pharmacological importance. Binding of an external agonist promotes coupling of the GPCR to its cognate G protein, and this, in turn, induces downstream signaling. Several factors have been proposed to regulate the affinity and activity of these receptors, including allosteric modulators (1May L.T. Leach K. Sexton P.M. Christopoulos A.

Bezanilla F. Depolarization induces a conformational change in the binding site region of the M 2 muscarinic receptor.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2012; 109: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Specifically, a conserved tyrosine lid above the orthosteric binding site (17Barchad-Avitzur O. Priest M.F. Dekel N. Bezanilla F.

It was further suggested that the allosteric binding site is involved in this process as well (16Dekel N. Priest M.F. Parnas H. Parnas I. Bezanilla F.

The allosteric site regulates the voltage sensitivity of muscarinic receptors.Cell Signal. 2018; 42: 114-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Furthermore, for this receptor, research postulates that the G protein–coupling site may also have a role in determining the voltage dependence (19Ben-Chaim Y. Broide C. Parnas H.

In addition, it is quite well established that Na+ has an allosteric effect on family A GPCRs. Studies suggest that Na+ modulates the affinity and activity of several GPCRs, including dopaminergic, adrenergic, and adenosine receptors (21Neve K.A.

More recently, a link between the modulatory effects of membrane potential and Na+ has been suggested based on modeling approaches (26Vickery O.N. Machtens J.-P. Zachariae U. Membrane potentials regulating GPCRs: Insights from experiments and molecular dynamics simulations.Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2016; 30: 44-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 27Vickery O.N.

Experimental evidence for the existence of such a link is still lacking. Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) is a neurotransmitter involved in many physiological functions, in both the central nervous system and the periphery (28Nichols D.E. Nichols C.D. Serotonin receptors.Chem. Rev. 2008; 108: 1614-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar, 29Sharp T. Barnes N.M.

Rahimian R. The role of serotonin in memory: Interactions with neurotransmitters and downstream signaling.Exp.

Serotonin receptors.Chem. Rev. 2008; 108: 1614-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). All 5-HT receptors, except the 5-HT3 receptor (which forms a ligand-gated ion channel), are GPCRs. 5-HT receptors mediate numerous signal transduction processes (31Raymond J.R. Mukhin Y.V. Gelasco A.

Central 5-HT receptors and their function; present and future.Neuropharmacology. 2020; 177: 108155Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 33Švob Štrac D. Pivac N. Mück-Šeler D. The serotonergic system and cognitive function.Translational Neurosci. 2016; 7: 35-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In this study, we focused on the 5-HT1A receptor. Binding of 5-HT (or other agonists) to the 5-HT1A receptor leads to activation of Gi/o-protein mediated signaling, which normally causes cell hyperpolarization and an inhibition of action potential firing (34Carhart-Harris R.L. Nutt D.J. Serotonin and brain function: A tale of two receptors.J. Psychopharmacol. 2017; 31: 1091-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The 5-HT1A receptor is highly expressed on serotonergic neurons in the dorsal and median raphe nuclei, where it functions as a presynaptic autoreceptor that modulates the release of 5-HT (35Lanfumey L. Hamon M. Central 5-HT1A receptors: Regional distribution and functional characteristics.Nucl. Med. Biol. 2000; 27: 429-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). 5-HT1A receptors are also expressed postsynaptically in many brain regions including the hippocampus and cortex (36Varnäs K. Halldin C. Hall H. Autoradiographic distribution of serotonin transporters and receptor subtypes in human brain.Hum. Brain Mapp. 2004; 22: 246-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Although the 5-HT1A receptor has been studied extensively, its voltage and Na+ dependences have not yet been investigated. In the current study, we investigate these modulatory effects using Xenopus oocytes as an expression system. To study the voltage dependence of the 5-HT1A receptor, Xenopus oocytes were injected with circular RNAs (cRNA)s of proteins involved in the pathway leading to activation of K+ currents by the receptor via βγ subunits of the G-proteins: 5-HT1A receptor, the two subunits of the G protein–activated inward-rectifying K+ (GIRK) channel (GIRK1 and GIRK2), and the Gαi3 subunit (4Ben-Chaim Y. Tour O. Dascal N. Parnas I. Parnas H. The M2 muscarinic G-protein-coupled receptor is voltage-sensitive.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22482-22491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 37Peleg S. Varon D. Ivanina T. Dessauer C.W. Dascal N. Gαi controls the gating of the G protein-activated K+ channel, GIRK.Neuron. 2002; 33: 87-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). We first verified that 5-HT does not exert a receptor-independent effect on the GIRK channels. To do so, we measured the effect of 5-HT on oocytes expressing the GIRK channel but not the receptor. Fig. S1 shows that 5-HT does not affect the GIRK channel directly, thus enabling us to use the 5-HT-induced GIRK currents as a measure for receptor activation. Next, the dependence of the 5-HT-induced K+ current (I5-HT) on 5-HT concentration (dose response [DR]) was measured at two holding potentials: –80 mV and +40 mV. Figure 1, A and B depicts the basic experimental protocol for three 5-HT concentrations. The oocyte was voltage clamped to either –80 mV (Fig. 1A) or +40 mV (Fig. 1B), in a low K+ (2 mM K+) solution, ND96 (see the Experimental procedures section). Basal GIRK current (IK) was developed upon replacement of the ND96 by the 24 mM K+ solution. Then, three concentrations of 5-HT were applied sequentially, giving rise to I5-HT. I5-HT was terminated upon washout of 5-HT. Employing this basic experimental protocol, full DR curves at the two holding potentials were constructed. For each holding potential, I5-HT (i.e., the current evoked by 5-HT above the basal IK at any particular 5-HT concentration) was normalized to I5-HT obtained at a saturating concentration of 5-HT (5 μM; higher 5-HT concentration did not evoke higher GIRK currents) at the same holding potential. This enabled us to compensate for the intrinsically different GIRK currents obtained at the two holding potentials of –80 mV and +40 mV in a single oocyte and to compare between oocytes. Figure 1C depicts the cumulative results from eight batches of oocytes. The results are both from oocytes where data were obtained from one of the holding potentials and recordings where the same oocyte was subjected to both holding potentials. The results of the latter (shown in Fig. S2) were not different from the cumulative results. The results suggest that membrane potential affects the apparent affinity of 5-HT toward the 5-HT1A receptor. Specifically, depolarization decreases the potency of this ligand in activating the 5-HT1A receptor by more than 20-fold. The EC50 was 3.8 nM at −80 mV and 85.3 nM at +40 mV. Voltage dependence of GPCRs has been shown to be agonist dependent. Namely, while the potency of one agonist may decrease upon depolarization, the potency of others may not be voltage dependent or even increase when the membrane potential is depolarized (5Navarro-Polanco R.A. Galindo E.G.M. Ferrer-Villada T. Arias M. Rigby J.R. Sánchez-Chapula J.A. Tristani-Firouzi M. Conformational changes in the M2 muscarinic receptor induced by membrane voltage and agonist binding.J.

Voltage-sensitivity at the human dopamine D2S receptor is agonist-specific.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 377: 1216-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The 5-HT1A receptor is a target for a variety of therapeutically relevant drugs. As the potency of these drugs may be affected by membrane potential, we sought to investigate the voltage dependence of the activation of this receptor by two agonists that are used pharmaceutically. We first used buspirone, which is an agonist to the 5-HT1A receptor that is widely used as an anxiolytic drug (38Robinson D.S. Alms D.R. Shrotriya R.C. Messina M. Wickramaratne P. Serotonergic anxiolytics and treatment of depression.Psychopathology. 1989; 22: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 39Akimova E. Lanzenberger R. Kasper S. The serotonin-1A receptor in anxiety disorders.Biol. Psychiatry. 2009; 66: 627-635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). This ligand was reported to act either as a full agonist or as a partial agonist for the 5-HT1A receptor (40Loane C. Politis M. Buspirone: What is it all about?.Brain Res. 2012; 1461: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 41Peroutka S.J. 5-Hydroxytryptamine receptor subtypes: Molecular, biochemical and physiological characterization.Trends Neurosci. 1988; 11: 496-500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). In our experiential system, buspirone acts as a partial agonist; the maximal response evoked by buspirone (10 μM) was ∼42% of the maximal response produced by 5-HT. Similar maximal activation was observed at both holding potentials, suggesting that voltage does not affect the efficacy of this ligand in activating the receptor (Fig. S3A). The DR curves, obtained under two membrane potentials as described previously, are depicted in Figure 2A. In contrast to the activation by 5-HT, the potency of buspirone was not voltage dependent. The EC50 values obtained for the two membrane potentials were not significantly different (277.8 nM at −80 mV and 313.7 at +40 mV). Similarly, we examined the voltage dependence of another anxiolytic drug, tandospirone. As reported before (42Barradell L.B. Fitton A. Tandospirone.CNS Drugs. 1996; 5: 147-153Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 43Hamik A. Oksenberg D. Fischette C. An alysis of tandospirone (SM-3997) interactions with neurotransmitter receptor binding sites.Biol. Psychiatry. 1990; 28: 99-109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), we found that tandospirone acts as a partial agonist; it evokes a maximal response that is ∼55% of the maximal response evoked by 5-HT at the same oocytes. The maximal response was similar at both holding potentials, suggesting that voltage does not affect the efficacy of this agonist in activating the receptor (Fig. S3B). The DR curves obtained using this ligand are depicted in Figure 2B. Our results suggest that this ligand activates the receptor in a voltage-dependent manner, although its voltage dependence was weaker than that of 5-HT. The EC50 value at −80 mV (194 nM) was approximately five times lower than the one obtained at +40 mV (937.9 nM). A known allosteric modulator of class A GPCRs is Na+ ions (24Katritch V. Fenalti G. Abola E.E. Roth B.L. Cherezov V. Stevens R.C. Allosteric sodium in class A GPCR signaling.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2014; 39: 233-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). For several family A GPCRs, it was shown that Na+ allosterically regulates the binding of agonists. Furthermore, theoretical studies have proposed that movement of Na+ from its binding site may be the source of the charge movement–associated currents in these receptors and thereby may underlie their voltage dependence (26Vickery O.N. Machtens J.-P. Zachariae U. Membrane potentials regulating GPCRs: Insights from experiments and molecular dynamics simulations.Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2016; 30: 44-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 27Vickery O.N. Machtens J.-P. Tamburrino G. Seeliger D. Zachariae U. Structural mechanisms of voltage sensing in G protein-coupled receptors.Structure. 2016; 24: 997-1007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Experimental evidence regarding the effect of Na+ on the 5-HT1A receptor function is still lacking, to the best of our knowledge. Thus, to investigate whether extracellular Na+ ([Na+]o) underlies the voltage dependence of the activation of the 5-HT1A receptor by 5-HT, we first explored whether Na+ modifies 5-HT1A receptor activation. To this end, we repeated the experiments described previously in Na+-free solution (Na+ was replaced by the large ion N-methyl-d-glucamine; see the Experimental procedures section; to ensure full removal of Na+ from the extracellular solution, the oocyte was bathed in Na+-free solution for at least 5 min prior to the recording). We have previously shown that removal of extracellular Na+ does not affect the GIRK currents themselves (44Friedman S. Tauber M. Ben-chaim Y. Sodium ions allosterically modulate the M2 muscarinic receptor.Sci.Rep. 2020; 10: 11177Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), and therefore, receptor-activated GIRK currents may be used in order to study the effect of Na+ on 5-HT1A receptor activation. The results of these experiments are depicted in Figure 3. As illustrated, the removal of Na+ from the extracellular solution did not affect the maximal current of the receptor in our experimental system (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, the basal GIRK current measured from the oocytes that were used in this experiment did not differ from the basal currents measured in the experiments described in Figure 1, indicating that the expression levels were similar at both groups of oocytes (Fig. 3B). Constructing DR curves revealed an allosteric effect of Na+ on the potency of 5-HT in activating the 5-HT1A receptor. Comparing the DR curve obtained under these conditions with the DR curve obtained at 72 mM Na+ (Fig. 3C), we found that removal of Na+ affected the potency of 5-HT in activating the receptor. Specifically, 5-HT showed lower potency in activating the 5-HT1A receptor at Na+-free solution (red) in comparison to the potency at 72 mM Na+ (black; the EC50 was 23.03 nM at Na+-free conditions, in comparison to 3.8 nM in 72 mM Na+, taken from the data of Fig. 1C). It is interesting to note that while this observation is in line with our recent finding concerning the M2R, where the removal of Na+ decreased the affinity of acetylcholine toward the receptor (44Friedman S. Tauber M. Ben-chaim Y. Sodium ions allosterically modulate the M2 muscarinic receptor.Sci.Rep. 2020; 10: 11177Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), this observation is not consistent with results from other GPCRs, where the removal of Na+ increases the affinity of the receptor (22Massink A. Gutiérrez-de-Terán H. Lenselink E.B. Ortiz Zacarías N.V. Xia L. Heitman L.H. Katritch V. Stevens R.C. IJzerman A.P. Sodium ion binding pocket mutations and adenosine A2A receptor function.Mol.

Several structural studies suggested that Na+ acts via binding at a specific binding site within the helical bundle. These and other functional studies implicated a conserved aspartate residue in transmembrane domain II (Asp2.50) as being involved in the allosteric effect of Na+ on class A GPCRs. Mutating this residue to an uncharged residue results in the abolishment of the Na+ dependence in other GPCRs (45Wilson M.H. Highfield H.A. Limbird L.E.

Pivotal role for aspartate-80 in the regulation of dopamine D2 receptor affinity for drugs and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase.Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 39: 733-739PubMed Google Scholar). To validate the role of this residue, Asp82 in the 5-HT1A receptor, in Na+ binding, we mutated it to asparagine (Asp82Asn) and repeated the experiments described previously. Figure 3D depicts the results, demonstrating that while the potency of the Asp82Asn mutant was lower than that of the wildtype 5-HT1A receptor, the Na+ dependence of the potency of the ligand was diminished. The two EC50 values (163.9 nM in 72 mM Na+ and 226.5 nM in Na+-free solution) were not significantly different. These results suggest that Asp 2.50 indeed plays a role in the allosteric effect of Na+ on 5-HT1A receptor function. To further investigate whether the allosteric effect of Na+ indeed underlies the voltage dependence of the 5-HT1A receptor, we measured the potency of 5-HT in activating the 5-HT1A receptor in Na+-free solution at +40 mV as well. The results (Fig. 4A) indicate that the removal of Na+ did not abolish the voltage dependence of 5-HT potency (black and red symbols and solid line represent data obtained at Na+-free solution at −80 mV and +40 mV, respectively; the dashed black and red lines represent the data obtained at the respective membrane potentials at 72 mM Na+). However, it did affect the potency in a voltage-dependent manner. Namely, while it had a pronounced effect on DR curve obtained at −80 mV (approximately sixfold increase in EC50 value, see aforementioned), it had a less robust effect on the potency of 5-HT at +40 mV (EC50 = 170.9 nM, less than twofold decrease in EC50 in comparison to the EC50 obtained at 72 mM Na+). These results suggest that the voltage dependence of 5-HT potency toward the 5-HT1A receptor is not determined solely by Na+ sensitivity of this receptor. To further test this conclusion, we examined the effect of the Asp82Asn mutant on the voltage dependence of the receptor. Previous studies concerning the M2R showed that although this mutation diminished the charge movement–associated currents in this receptor (5Navarro-Polanco R.A. Galindo E.G.M. Ferrer-Villada T.

https://openalex.org/W4224247351,"Organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1) is a membrane transporter that affects hepatic uptake of cationic and weakly basic drugs. OCT1 transports structurally highly diverse substrates. The mechanisms conferring this polyspecificity are unknown. Here, we analyzed differences in transport kinetics between human and mouse OCT1 orthologs to identify amino acids that contribute to the polyspecificity of OCT1. Following stable transfection of HEK293 cells, we observed more than twofold differences in the transport kinetics of 22 out of 28 tested substrates. We found that the β2-adrenergic drug fenoterol was transported with eightfold higher affinity but at ninefold lower capacity by human OCT1. In contrast, the anticholinergic drug trospium was transported with 11-fold higher affinity but at ninefold lower capacity by mouse Oct1. Using human-mouse chimeric constructs and site-directed mutagenesis, we identified nonconserved amino acids Cys36 and Phe32 as responsible for the species-specific differences in fenoterol and trospium uptake. Substitution of Cys36 (human) to Tyr36 (mouse) caused a reversal of the affinity and capacity of fenoterol but not trospium uptake. Substitution of Phe32 to Leu32 caused reversal of trospium but not fenoterol uptake kinetics. Comparison of the uptake of structurally similar β2-adrenergics and molecular docking analyses indicated the second phenol ring, 3.3 to 4.8 Å from the protonated amino group, as essential for the affinity for fenoterol conferred by Cys36. This is the first study to report single amino acids as determinants of OCT1 polyspecificity. Our findings suggest that structure-function data of OCT1 is not directly transferrable between substrates or species."
https://openalex.org/W4224440673,"In recent decades, educators have pushed to implementing active learning techniques that can advance students' competences. Universities are increasingly required to develop knowledge measured in terms of grades (hard skills) and inter-personal, social, and communication abilities (soft skills). Nevertheless, within the field of active learning, educators often focus on how these techniques can improve students' hard skills and their satisfaction. Few have analysed whether and how these techniques might improve students' soft skills. Moreover, among these few studies, the majority has analysed hard and soft skills separately, measuring whether different active learning techniques may or may not improve them. Virtually no one has studied whether students' hard and soft skills can converge or diverge in an active learning format. This study allows us to understand the relations between these two sets of variables, for example, whether an improvement (or deterioration) in the hard skills corresponds to an improvement (or deterioration) in the soft skills, and vice versa.In our experiment, we analyse the impact of a specific active learning format, such as the Flipped Classroom (FC), on both students' hard and soft skills, by comparing it with a traditional class integrated with other active learning techniques, such as presentations, debates, and teamwork activities. First, we use Pearson correlations to measure the relation between students' hard skills, understood in terms of grades, and a set of soft skills, such as critical thinking, self-efficacy, teamwork, and perception of learning. Second, we use canonical correlations to analyse whether hard and soft skills converge or diverge in an FC format, in comparison with a traditional teaching format integrated with the other active learning techniques.Our main finding is that the FC per se neither improves nor worsens students' performance in terms of hard and soft skills."
https://openalex.org/W4224499200,"One of the key components that affects soil productiveness, plant growth, and crop quality is fertilization. The effect of fertilizer, both organic and chemical, on the extremely acidic (pH 4.10) sandy loam soil chemical properties, yield, and quality of white mugwort grown were evaluated in this study. The field experiment arranged in a randomized complete block design, with four replications was conducted in Prachin Buri province, Thailand. There were six treatments, no fertilization (control), chemical fertilizer (25-7-7 + 46-0-0) applied at 187.50 (66.56 N:6.77 P2O5:6.77 K2O kg ha-1) kg ha-1 and applied at 375.00 (133.12 N:13.13 P2O5:13.13 K2O kg ha-1) kg ha-1, chicken manure applied at 3.36, 6.72, and 10.08 t ha-1. After harvesting, application of chicken manure tended to increase soil organic matter compared to the control, however, the application of chemical fertilizer did not show the same effect. The fresh weight of white mugwort increased with the rise in both fertilizer levels. Chicken manure application at 10.08 t ha-1 produced the highest fresh weight at all times. The level of accumulated nitrate was significantly greater when fertilizer rates increased. In addition, the total phenolic content of the white mugwort fertilized with chicken manure was higher than that fertilized with chemical fertilizer. However, there was no association between the DPPH radical scavenging capacity at harvesting times and different fertilization. Based on the results, chicken manure applied at 10.08 t ha-1 gave the best yield and higher total phenolic content of white mugwort, which was probably due to the improved soil organic matter."
https://openalex.org/W4224640172,"Use of equipment-free, ""manual"" blood cultures is still widespread in low-resource settings, as requirements for implementation of automated systems are often not met. Quality of manual blood culture bottles currently on the market, however, is usually unknown. An acceptable quality in terms of yield and speed of growth can be ensured by evaluating the bottles using simulated blood cultures. In these experiments, bottles from different systems are inoculated in parallel with blood and a known quantity of bacteria. Based on literature review and personal experiences, we propose a short and practical protocol for an efficient evaluation of manual blood culture bottles, aimed at research or reference laboratories in low-resource settings. Recommendations include: (1) practical equivalence of horse blood and human blood; (2) a diverse selection of 10 to 20 micro-organisms to be tested (both slow- and fast-growing reference organisms); (3) evaluation of both adult and pediatric bottle formulations and blood volumes; (4) a minimum sample size of 120 bottles per bottle type; (5) a formal assessment of usability. Different testing scenarios for increasing levels of reliability are provided, along with practical tools such as worksheets and surveys that can be used by laboratories wishing to evaluate manual blood culture bottles."
https://openalex.org/W4224945149,"RAB28 is a farnesylated, ciliary G-protein. Patient variants in RAB28 are causative of autosomal recessive cone-rod dystrophy (CRD), an inherited human blindness. In rodent and zebrafish models, the absence of Rab28 results in diminished dawn, photoreceptor, outer segment phagocytosis (OSP). Here, we demonstrate that Rab28 is also required for dusk peaks of OSP, but not for basal OSP levels. This study further elucidated the molecular mechanisms by which Rab28 controls OSP and inherited blindness. Proteomic profiling identified factors whose expression in the eye or whose expression at dawn and dusk peaks of OSP is dysregulated by loss of Rab28. Notably, transgenic overexpression of Rab28, solely in zebrafish cones, rescues the OSP defect in rab28 KO fish, suggesting rab28 gene replacement in cone photoreceptors is sufficient to regulate Rab28-OSP. Rab28 loss also perturbs function of the visual cycle as retinoid levels of 11-cRAL, 11cRP, and atRP are significantly reduced in larval and adult rab28 KO retinae (p < .05). These data give further understanding on the molecular mechanisms of RAB28-associated CRD, highlighting roles of Rab28 in both peaks of OSP, in vitamin A metabolism and in retinoid recycling."

In this study, we examined the ocular proteome to identify protein biomarkers with altered expression levels in women diagnosed with breast cancer. Tear samples were collected from 273 participants using Schirmer strip collection methods. Following protein elution, proteome wide trypsin digestion with Liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used to identify potential protein biomarkers with altered expression levels in breast cancer patients. Selected biomarkers were further validated by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A total of 102 individual tear samples (51 breast cancer, 51 control) were analyzed by LC-MS/MS which identified 301 proteins. Spectral intensities between the groups were compared and 14 significant proteins (p-value &lt;0.05) were identified as potential biomarkers in breast cancer patients. Three biomarkers, S100A8 (p-value = 0.0069, 7.8-fold increase), S100A9 (p-value = 0.0048, 10.2-fold increase), and Galectin-3 binding protein (p-value = 0.01, 3.0-fold increase) with an increased expression in breast cancer patients were selected for validation using ELISA. Validation by ELISA was conducted using 171 individual tear samples (75 Breast Cancer and 96 Control). Similar to the observed LC-MS/MS results, S100A8 (p-value &lt;0.0001) and S100A9 (p-value &lt;0.0001) showed significantly higher expression in breast cancer patients. However, galectin-3 binding protein had increased expression in the control group. Our results provide further support for using tear proteins to detect non-ocular systemic diseases such as breast cancer. Our work provides crucial details to support the continued evaluation of tear samples in the screening and diagnosis of breast cancer and paves the way for future evaluation of the tear proteome for screening and diagnosis of systemic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W4226329237,"The cytokine-inducible SH2 domain containing protein (CISH) is the founding member of the suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) family of negative feedback regulators and has been shown to be a physiological regulator of signaling in immune cells. This study sought to investigate novel functions for CISH outside of the immune system. Mice deficient in CISH were generated and analyzed using a range of metabolic and other parameters, including in response to a high fat diet and leptin administration. CISH knockout mice possessed decreased body fat and showed resistance to diet-induced obesity. This was associated with reduced food intake, but unaltered energy expenditure and microbiota composition. CISH ablation resulted in reduced basal expression of the orexigenic Agrp gene in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) region of the brain. Cish was basally expressed in the ARC, with evidence of co-expression with the leptin receptor (Lepr) gene in Agrp-positive neurons. CISH-deficient mice also showed enhanced leptin responsiveness, although Cish expression was not itself modulated by leptin. CISH-deficient mice additionally exhibited improved insulin sensitivity on a high-fat diet, but not glucose tolerance despite reduced body weight. These data identify CISH as an important regulator of homeostasis through impacts on appetite control, mediated at least in part by negative regulation of the anorexigenic effects of leptin, and impacts on glucose metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W4224518774,"Numerical modeling of the migration of three-phase immiscible fluid flow in variably saturated zones is challenging due to the different behavior of the system between unsaturated and saturated zones. This behavior results in the use of different numerical methods for the numerical simulation of the fluid flow depending on whether it is in the unsaturated or saturated zones. This paper shows that using a high-resolution shock-capturing conservative method to resolve the nonlinear governing coupled partial differential equations of a three-phase immiscible fluid flow allows the numerical simulation of the system through both zones providing a unitary vision (and resolution) of the migration of an immiscible contaminant problem within a porous medium. In particular, using different initial scenarios (including impermeable ""lenses"" in heterogeneous aquifers), three-dimensional numerical simulation results are presented on the temporal evolution of the contaminant migration following the saturation profiles of the three-phases fluids flow in variably saturated zones. It is considered either light nonaqueous phase liquid with a density less than the water, or dense nonaqueous phase liquid, which has densities greater than the water initially released in unsaturated dry soil. Our study shows that the fate of the migration of immiscible contaminants in variably saturated zones can be accurately described, using a unique mathematical conservative model, with different evolution depending on the value of the system's physical parameters, including the contaminant density, and accurately tracking the evolution of the sharp (shock) contaminant front."
https://openalex.org/W4224861933,"Increasing evidence associates apathy with worsening in cognitive performance and greater risk of dementia, in both clinical and healthy older populations. In older adults with neurocognitive disorders, apathy has also been related to specific fronto-subcortical structural abnormalities, thus differentiating apathy and major depressive disorder. Yet, the neural mechanisms associated with apathy in healthy older adults are still unclear. In the present study, we investigated the frontal cortical response during a dual-task walking paradigm in forty-one healthy older adults with and without apathy symptoms, controlling for depressive symptoms. The dual-task walking paradigm included a single cognitive task (2-back), a single motor task (walking), and a dual-task condition (2-back whilst walking). The cortical response was measured by means of functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS). The results revealed that participants with apathy symptoms showed greater activation of subregions of the prefrontal cortex and of the premotor cortex compared to healthy controls during the single cognitive component of the dual-task paradigm, whilst cognitive performance was equivalent between groups. Moreover, increased cortical response during the cognitive task was associated with higher odds of exhibiting apathy symptoms, independently of depressive symptoms. These findings suggest that apathy may be related to differential brain activation patterns in healthy older individuals and are in line with previous evidence of the distinctiveness between apathy and depression. Future research may explore the long-term effects of apathy on the cortical response in healthy older adults."
https://openalex.org/W4226119494,"Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a leading cause of childhood blindness associated with retinal vaso-obliteration in phase 1 and pathological neovascularization (NV) in phase 2; however, effective and safe treatments for ROP definitive treatment are yet to be determined. Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy mainly focuses on reducing abnormal NV in phase 2 but with high risks of late recurrence and systemic side effects. Previous studies have established that the severity of vaso-obliteration in phase 1 largely influences subsequent stages, suggesting that prevention of vessels loss may be a potential therapeutic target for ROP. Herein, the therapeutic potential and safety of early Elabela intervention treatment in treating phase 1 ROP and the possible underlying mechanisms were investigated using an oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) mouse model. It was observed that intraperitoneal injection of Elabela remarkably reduced the avascular retinal area and increased the vascular density in phase 1 of OIR mice. Further investigation revealed that mitochondrion-dependent ferroptosis was involved in oxidative stress-mediated vascular protection loss in phase 1 OIR. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Elabela could rescue mitochondria-dependent ferroptosis via mediating the xCT/GPX4 axis. Collectively, our study revealed that ferroptosis may play a significant role in early ROP, while Elabela may be a safe and promising strategy for the early intervention of ROP."

Due to the rapidly evolving nature of the pandemic, a multipronged strategy was implemented to widely disseminate the COVID-19 Survey and capture data using both the online platform and mailings.We limited the findings of this paper to the initial phase of survey dissemination which began in May 2020. A total of 729,625 eligible MVP Veterans were invited to complete version 1 of the COVID-19 Survey. As of October 31, 2020, 58,159 surveys have been returned. The mean and standard deviation (SD) age of responders was 71 (11) years, 8.6% were female, 8.2% were Black, 5.6% were Hispanic, and 446 (0.8%) self-reported a COVID-19 diagnosis. Over 90% of responders reported wearing masks, practicing social distancing, and frequent hand washing.The MVP COVID-19 Survey provides a systematic collection of data regarding COVID-19 behaviors among Veterans and represents one of the first large-scale, national surveillance efforts of COVID-19 in the Veteran population.

https://openalex.org/W4224433802,"Informed antibiotic prescription offers a practical solution to antibiotic resistance problem. With the increasing affordability of different sequencing technologies, molecular-based resistance prediction would direct proper antibiotic selection and preserve available agents. Amikacin is a broad-spectrum aminoglycoside exhibiting higher clinical efficacy and less resistance rates in Ps . aeruginosa due to its structural nature and its ability to achieve higher serum concentrations at lower therapeutic doses. This study examines the predictive potential of molecular markers underlying amikacin susceptibility phenotypes in order to provide improved diagnostic panels. Using a predictive model, genes and variants underlying amikacin resistance have been statistically and functionally explored in a large comprehensive and diverse set of Ps . aeruginosa completely sequenced genomes. Different genes and variants have been examined for their predictive potential and functional correlation to amikacin susceptibility phenotypes. Three predictive sets of molecular markers have been identified and can be used in a complementary manner, offering promising molecular diagnostics. arm R, nal C, nal D, mex R, mex Z, amp R, rmt D, nal DSer32Asn, fus A1Y552C, fus A1D588G, arn AA170T, and arn DG206C have been identified as the best amikacin resistance predictors in Ps . aeruginosa while fao AT385A, nuo GA890T, nuo GA574T, lpt AT55A, lpt AR62S, pst BR87C, gid BE126G, gid BQ28K, amg SE108Q, and rpl YQ41L have been identified as the best amikacin susceptibility predictors. Combining different measures of predictive performance together with further functional analysis can help design new and more informative molecular diagnostic panels. This would greatly inform and direct point of care diagnosis and prescription, which would consequently preserve amikacin functionality and usefulness."

Polyphosphates represent another type of polyanions, which in their linear form are known to enhance the fibrin stabilizing effects of DNA and histones. However, in vivo polyphosphates are also present in the form of nanoparticles (PolyP-NP), the interference of which with the fibrin/NET matrix is poorly characterized.To compare the effects of linear and nanoparticulate polyphosphates, and their combinations with relevant NET components (DNA, histone H3) on fibrin formation, structure, and lysis in in vitro assays focusing on histone-polyphosphate interactions.Transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering for stability of the PolyP-NP preparations. Turbidimetry for kinetics of fibrinogen clotting by thrombin and fibrin dissolution by tissue-type plasminogen activator/plasminogen. Scanning electron microscopy for fibrin structure. Surface plasmon resonance for strength of histone-PolyP interactions.Both linear PolyP and PolyP-NP accelerated the fibrin formation and slowed down its dissolution and these effects were strongly dependent on the number of individual PolyP particles and not on their size. Addition of DNA did not modify significantly the PolyP-NP effects on fibrin formation and lysis. Both linear and nanoparticulate PolyP counteracted the effect of histone in the acceleration of fibrinogen clotting by thrombin. PolyP-NP, but not linear PolyP enhanced the prolongation of lysis time in fibrin containing histone and caused more pronounced thickening of the fibrin fibers than the linear form. Finally, PolyP-NP bound weaker to histone than the linear form.The interaction of PolyP with histone was a stronger modulator of fibrin formation and lysis than its interaction with DNA. In addition, the PolyP nanoparticles enhanced the thrombus stabilizing effects of histone more effectively than linear PolyP."
https://openalex.org/W4224706212,"The present study aimed to investigate the effects of degraded speech perception and binaural unmasking using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Normal hearing listeners were tested when attending to unprocessed or vocoded speech, presented to the left ear at two speech-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Additionally, by comparing monaural versus diotic masker noise, we measured binaural unmasking. Our primary research question was whether the prefrontal cortex and temporal cortex responded differently to varying listening configurations. Our a priori regions of interest (ROIs) were located at the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and auditory cortex (AC). The left DLPFC has been reported to be involved in attentional processes when listening to degraded speech and in spatial hearing processing, while the AC has been reported to be sensitive to speech intelligibility. Comparisons of cortical activity between these two ROIs revealed significantly different fNIRS response patterns. Further, we showed a significant and positive correlation between self-reported task difficulty levels and fNIRS responses in the DLPFC, with a negative but non-significant correlation for the left AC, suggesting that the two ROIs played different roles in effortful speech perception. Our secondary question was whether activity within three sub-regions of the lateral PFC (LPFC) including the DLPFC was differentially affected by varying speech-noise configurations. We found significant effects of spectral degradation and SNR, and significant differences in fNIRS response amplitudes between the three regions, but no significant interaction between ROI and speech type, or between ROI and SNR. When attending to speech with monaural and diotic noises, participants reported the latter conditions being easier; however, no significant main effect of masker condition on cortical activity was observed. For cortical responses in the LPFC, a significant interaction between SNR and masker condition was observed. These findings suggest that binaural unmasking affects cortical activity through improving speech reception threshold in noise, rather than by reducing effort exerted."
https://openalex.org/W4224937788,"Thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP), also known as Vitamin-D upregulated protein-1 (VDUP-1), interacts with thioredoxin to regulate redox responses and participates in diverse disorders including metabolic, cardiovascular, inflammatory and malignant diseases. Psoriasis is characterized by chronic skin inflammation and an aberrant pattern of keratinocyte differentiation. Clinically, psoriasis is associated with various cardiometabolic comorbidities but studies on TXNIP's biological role in skin disorders are limited. In this study, we investigated TXNIP expression in psoriasis and its regulation in normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs), and then explored how TXNIP regulated skin keratinocyte differentiation to determine its role in psoriasis pathogenesis. Our immunohistochemical study demonstrated extensive TXNIP expression in the upper and lower epidermis of psoriasis compared to predominant TXNIP expression in the basal layer of normal skin. 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 suppressed but TGF-α and EGF enhanced TXNIP expression in NHEKs. An inducer of keratinocyte differentiation, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), also diminished TXNIP expression, which was reversed by PKC-δ knockdown. TXNIP knockdown reduced PMA-induced involucrin and transglutaminse-1 expression, and increased p63 expression in NHEKs but did not significantly affect cell proliferation. H2 O2 -induced ROS production and EGFR phosphorylation decreased in NHEKs with TXNIP knockdown. Furthermore, PMA-induced PKC-δ phosphorylation, TGF-α, and EGF-triggered EGFR phosphorylation were attenuated by TXNIP knockdown. Our results unraveled the regulation and function of TXNIP expression in skin keratinocytes and the cross-regulation between TXNIP and EGFR signaling. These findings imply a role of TXNIP in psoriasis and provide insight into the possible impact of TXNIP regulators on the skin or psoriasis."

In this connection, criteria of movement safety assessment must be established for manned, unmanned, and autonomous vehicles, bearing in mind the specifics of each transport mode. Distance is one of the basic criteria. In sea transport these include the closest point of approach and ship's domain understood as an area that should remain free of other objects. The authors examine the relationship between the declared domain and the actually maintained effective domain in a restricted area. They define the coefficient describing this relationship for different ship's relative bearings in the form of a mathematical function. The formulated relationship allows determining an effective passing distance based on the declared, i.e., assumed passing distance. The determined relationship also enables identification of the declarative domain based on the effective one. These relationships may be used in decision support systems of manned ships, in remote ship control centres and decision-making systems of autonomous ships for the assessment of ship movement safety, planning collision avoidance manoeuvres and generation of safe trajectories."

Although recent work has focused on establishing the first use of copper in the western Great Lakes region, little attention has been paid to determining the age ranges of subsequent copper using groups or to the identification of broader trends in copper use during the Archaic Period (10,000-3000 RCYBP). Here we address this issue by applying Bayesian modeling to a comprehensive suite of 76 radiocarbon dates directly associated with copper use. Our results identified two distinct peaks in copper usage, ca. 5500 cal BP and ca. 3300 cal BP. Age ranges for the three Archaic Period traditions and practices associated with copper use of the western Great Lakes are revised using modern calibration curves. Bayesian revisions of age ranges from sites where copper tools and/or production debris have been found provide insight into the historical relationships between, and cultural interactions among, these early copper using groups. This study provides an updated, refined chronology based on the most recent calibration curve (IntCal20) for the varied cultural contexts of copper use across the western Great Lakes."

Hybridization increased with the entrance of the Africanized bee in Nicaragua in 1984. Rustic beekeeping activities and numerous feral swarms define the genetic pattern, reflected in phenotypic heterogeneity and remarkable differences in the behaviour of the bee colonies, especially the nest defence. Due to these facts, the question emerge about the degree of Africanization of honeybee colonies in Nicaragua. In this study, we identified Africanized honeybee colonies based on the single character ""mean forewing length"" and we corroborated our results by determining mitotypes using mtDNA analysis. Morphometric and genetic approaches were realized in three different geographical zones of Nicaragua and related to beehive characteristics and management. Worker bee samples were taken from the inside of 146 hives from 26 apiaries. Abdominal colour as phenotypic character was the first examination, followed by measurement of 1460 right forewings to determine corresponding probability of Africanization. More than 60% of the beehives showed phenotypic heterogeneity and mean forewing length of 8.74 mm (SD 0.16 mm) indicated a high degree of Africanization. Those results provided a selection of 96 worker bees to perform PCR of two worker bees per hive. For mitochondrial DNA analysis 14 samples from sentinel apiaries were added. Three from 61 beehives presented bees with different mtDNA. Throughout, three mitotypes of the African (A) lineage were detected; one mitotype is still unidentified. Mitotype A1 A. mellifera iberiensis was represented by 88 bees and mitotype A4 A. mellifera scutellata by 21 bees. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed the PCR findings. No associations were found between mitotypes, forewing length, beehive characteristics and management. A high degree of Africanization in A. mellifera colonies represented by two predominating mitotypes from the A lineage, prevail in Neotropical Nicaragua, with mitotype A4 predominating at higher altitudes."

In recent years however, synchrotron radiation-based micro-computed tomography (SRμCT) has become a tool for extending the imaging of two-dimensional thin sections into three-dimensional imaging of tissue blocks, enabling so-called virtual histology with arbitrary clipping planes, volumetric rendering and automatic segmentation. In this study, we present a thorough characterization of human carotid plaques after endarterectomy of patients with stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), investigating several different pathologic structures using both SRμCT and histology. Phase-contrast SRμCT was performed with two different magnifications (voxel sizes 6.5 μm and 0.65 μm, respectively), and histology was performed with multiple different stainings (Alpha-actin, Glycophorin A, von Kossa, Movat, CD68). The 0.65 μm high-resolution SRμCT was performed on selected areas with plaque typical relevant morphology, identified on the 6.5 μm low-resolution SRμCT. The tomography datasets were reconstructed with additional 3D volume rendering and compared to histology. In total, nine different regions with typical pathologic structures were identified and imaged with high-resolution SRμCT. The results show many characteristics typical for advanced atherosclerotic plaques, clinically relevant, namely ruptures with thrombosis, neo-vascularization, inflammatory infiltrates in shoulder regions, lipid rich necrotic cores (LRNC), thin fibrous cap, calcifications, lumen irregularities, and changes in vessel wall structures such as the internal elastic membrane. This method’s non-destructive nature renders details of micro-structures with an excellent visual likeness to histology, with the additional strength of multiplanar and 3D visualization and the possibility of multiple re-scans."

First, scale development studies in four samples, including a field site and MBA courses with students employed full time, show that perceived evidence use can be measured reliably and is distinct from other leadership measures. Second, a cross-sectional study of 308 employees in 18 aged care homes demonstrates a positive relationship between employee perceptions of managerial evidence use and commonly used measures of leader member exchange, trust in supervisor, work-based learning, and organizational performance ratings, and a negative relationship with employee distress. These results suggest implications for leadership and management practices in contemporary, information-rich environments and novel insights into how employees can be affected by managerial evidence use."

While the full extent of modified substrates that comprise the ""PTM-ome"" are slowly emerging, how the upstream enzymes catalyzing these processes are regulated themselves is not well understood, particularly in the context of neurodegeneration. Here, we describe the reciprocal regulation of a kinase, the microtubule affinity-regulating kinase 2 (MARK2), and an acetyltransferase, CREB-binding protein (CBP), two enzymes known to extensively modify tau proteins in the progression of Alzheimer's disease. We found that MARK2 negatively regulates CBP and, conversely, CBP directly acetylates and inhibits MARK2 kinase activity. These findings highlight a reciprocal negative feedback loop between a kinase and an acetyltransferase, which has implications for how PTM interplay is coordinated on substrates including tau. Our study suggests that PTM profiles occur through the posttranslational control of the master PTM remodeling enzymes themselves."

Non-pulmonary vein (non-PV) trigger ablation is one of the promising strategies beyond PVI and has been shown to be effective in refractory/persistent AF cases. To make non-PV trigger ablation more standardized, it is essential to develop a simple method to localize the origin of non-PV triggers.We retrospectively analyzed 37 non-PV triggers in 751 ablation sessions for symptomatic AF from January 2017 to December 2020. Regarding non-PV triggers, intra-atrial activation interval from the earliest in right atrium (RA) to proximal coronary sinus (CS) (RA-CSp) and that from the earliest in RA to distal CS (RA-CSd) obtained by a basically-positioned duodecapolar RA-CS catheter were compared among 3 originating non-PV areas [RA, atrial septum (SEP) and left atrium (LA)].RA-CSp of RA non-PV trigger (56.4 ± 23.4 ms) was significantly longer than that of SEP non-PV (14.8 ± 25.6 ms, p = 0.019) and LA non-PV (-24.9 ± 27.9 ms, p = 0.0004). RA-CSd of RA non-PV (75.9 ± 32.1 ms) was significantly longer than that of SEP non-PV (34.2 ± 32.6 ms, p = 0.040) and LA non-PV (-13.3 ± 41.2 ms, p = 0.0008). RA-CSp and RA-CSd of SEP non-PV were significantly longer than those of LA non-PV (p = 0.022 and p = 0.016, respectively).

Phage-derived endolysins efficiently kill gram-positive bacteria including multi-drug resistant strains, making them attractive therapeutic candidates. The current study assessed the therapeutic potential of the novel endolysin PlyAZ3aT in an infant rat model of ceftriaxone-resistant pneumococcal meningitis.Efficacy of PlyAZ3aT was assessed in a randomized, blinded and controlled experimental study in infant Wistar rats. Meningitis was induced by intracisternal infection with 5 x 107 CFU/ml of a ceftriaxone-resistant clinical strain of S. pneumoniae, serotype 19A. Seventeen hours post infection (hpi), animals were randomized into 3 treatment groups and received either (i) placebo (phosphate buffered saline [PBS], n = 8), (ii) 50 mg/kg vancomycin (n = 10) or (iii) 400 mg/kg PlyAZ3aT (n = 8) via intraperitoneal injection. Treatments were repeated after 12 h. Survival at 42 hpi was the primary outcome; bacterial loads in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood were secondary outcomes. Additionally, pharmacokinetics of PlyAZ3aT in serum and CSF was assessed.PlyAZ3aT did not improve survival compared to PBS, while survival for vancomycin treated animals was 70% which is a significant improvement when compared to PBS or PlyAZ3aT (p<0.05 each). PlyAZ3aT was not able to control the infection, reflected by the inability to reduce bacterial loads in the CSF, whereas Vancomycin sterilized the CSF and within 25 h. Pharmacokinetic studies indicated that PlyAZ3aT did not cross the blood brain barrier (BBB). In support, PlyAZ3aT showed a peak concentration of 785 μg/ml in serum 2 h after intraperitoneal injection but could not be detected in CSF.In experimental pneumococcal meningitis, PlyAZ3aT failed to cure the infection due to an inability to reach the CSF.

However, there is a lack of local studies on the contributing factors of delayed presentation of TB patients in Malaysia. This study aims to establish a social epidemiology framework by analysing social factors including socio-epidemiological, socio-cultural, and health-seeking behaviours associated with the delay in seeking TB treatment among patients in Selangor, Malaysia. A sequential exploratory mixed-method study design that combines qualitative and quantitative research methods will be employed. This study will recruit adult patients who have been diagnosed with TB using chest X-ray and sputum smear microscopy. Four districts with the highest recorded cases in the state of Selangor will be selected as study locations. The qualitative study will involve a Focus Group Discussion (FGD) to explore six components, namely demographic, socio-cultural, health-seeking behaviours, social support and resources, previous knowledge and experience with illness, and treatment pathway. Meanwhile, the quantitative study will incorporate a structured survey that will be developed based on the themes identified in the qualitative phase and a review of several studies in the literature. Several quality control measures will be taken while ensuring that the survey questionnaires are anonymised and participants’ confidentiality is maintained. The data obtained from both qualitative and quantitative approaches will be combined to provide a more robust assessment of the study. Given that this study will focus on districts with high recorded cases of TB in Selangor, the findings might assist to address TB-related issues such as the increasing incidence and mortality rates, which are mainly attributed to the delayed presentation of TB patients to healthcare facilities."

Unfortunately, Acropora corals have suffered a severe decline in the last 50 years thus prompting the development of many restoration practices, such as coral nurseries, to increase the abundance of these species. However, many coral nursery designs require constant visits and maintenance limiting restoration to more convenient sites. Additionally, most studies lack the details required for practitioners to make informed decisions about replicating nursery designs. Two line nurseries were monitored for three years in The Bahamas to assess the survival of corals, Acropora cervicornis and Acropora palmata, as well as evaluate the durability and cost effectiveness of the nursery design. Survivorship ranged from 70 to 97% with one location experiencing significantly higher survivorship. The initial year build-out cost was high for a nursery, $22.97 per coral, but each nursery was comprised of specific materials that could withstand high storm conditions. Some unique aspects of the design included the use of longline clips and large-diameter monofilament lines which allowed for easier adjustments and more vigorous cleaning. The design proved to be very durable with materials showing a life expectancy of five years or more. Additionally, the design was able to withstand multiple hurricanes and winter storm conditions with little to no damage. Only two maintenance visits a year were required reducing costs after construction. After three years, this nursery design showed promising durability of materials and survivorship of both Acropora cervicornis and Acropora palmata despite being serviced just twice a year."

In this study, Tetragenococcus halophilus No. 1 in miso was found to possess salient immunomodulatory functions. Recently, we also demonstrated its effect on boosting immunological robustness. Although the consumption of miso is suggested to affect health over generations, such a long-term experiment has not been conducted until now. Thus, we evaluated the effects of miso-derived T. halophilus No. 1 over generations on the immune system of mice. As the generations increase, the proportion of germinal center B cells tends to increase. Furthermore, we found that CD4+ T cells expressing CD69, an activation marker, were increased in the third generation of mice. In addition, the proportion of follicular helper T cells and regulatory T cells tended to increase. Among the subsets of CD4+ T cells in the fourth generation, effector T cells and effector memory T cells tended to increase. In contrast, central memory T cells and naive T cells decreased. Moreover, autoimmunity was suppressed by long-term administration of T. halophilus No. 1. Based on these findings, we believe that the long-term administration of T. halophilus No. 1 over generations promotes immune activation and tolerance and enhances immunological robustness."

In this paper, a rigorous elastic-plastic solution of cavity contraction is proposed using a non-associated Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion to provide the optimal thickness of the frozen soil wall for excavation using artificial ground freezing technology, considering an interaction between the frozen soil wall and the surrounding soil/rock. After validation of a case study on a deep mine shaft against a numerical simulation, a thorough parametric study investigates the variation in the optimal thickness with the soil properties and initial stress conditions, as well as the effects of interaction and the critical condition. Compared to the existing solution, the proposed optimal thickness of the frozen soil wall is shown to contribute to both the design and cost-effectiveness in practical engineering, including tunneling and mine shaft construction."
