https://openalex.org/W1965583590,"To control agonist-induced nuclear translocation of transcription factor κB (NF-κB) in intact cells, cell-permeable synthetic peptides were devised. Their import into intact cells was dependent on a hydrophobic region selected from the signal peptide sequences and was verified by their inaccessibility to extracellular proteases and by confocal laser scanning microscopy. When a cell-permeable peptide carried a functional cargo representing the nuclear localization sequence of NF-κB p50, it inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner nuclear translocation of NF-κB in cultured endothelial and monocytic cells stimulated with lipopolysaccharide or tumor necrosis factor-α. Synthetic peptide analogues with deleted hydrophobic cell membrane-permeable motif or with a mutated nuclear localization sequence were inactive. Cell membrane-permeable peptides were not cytotoxic within the concentration range used in these experiments. These results suggest that cell-permeable synthetic peptides carrying a functional cargo can be applied to control signal transduction-dependent subcellular traffic of transcription factors mediating the cellular responses to different agonists. Moreover, this approach can be used to study other intracellular processes involving proteins with functionally distinct domains.

https://openalex.org/W1977497608,"Previous studies demonstrated that tissue plasminogen activator-induced fibrinolysis in vitro is retarded in the presence of prothrombin (II) activation and that the anticoagulant-activated protein C appears profibrinolytic by preventing the formation of thrombin (IIa)-like activity during fibrinolysis. To disclose the molecular connection between the generation of IIa and the inhibition of fibrinolysis, a lysis assay that is sensitive to the antifibrinolytic effect of II activation was developed and was used to purify a 60-kDa single-chain protein from human plasma. Because the lysis of a clot, produced from purified components, is retarded when this protein is present and when II activation occurs in situ, the protein was named TAFI (thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor). TAFI is cleaved by IIa yielding 35-, 25-, and 14-kDa products. Amino-terminal sequence analyses identified TAFI as a precursor of a plasma carboxypeptidase B (CPB). Formation of the 35-kDa product correlates with both prolongation of lysis time and CPB-like activity. Prolongation of lysis time saturates at about 125 nM TAFI. Activated TAFI inhibits the activation of Glu-plasminogen but does not prolong the lysis of clots formed in the presence of Lys-plasminogen. 2-Guanidinoethylmercaptosuccinic acid, a competitive inhibitor of CPB, completely inhibits prolongation of lysis by activated TAFI in a purified system and the prolongation induced by II activation in barium-adsorbed plasma. This suggests that TAFI accounts for the antifibrinolytic effect that accompanies prothrombin activation and that activated protein C appears profibrinolytic by attenuating TAFI activation.

This suggests that TAFI accounts for the antifibrinolytic effect that accompanies prothrombin activation and that activated protein C appears profibrinolytic by attenuating TAFI activation. The activation of II to IIa in vivo is catalyzed by prothrombinase, a tetrameric complex consisting of the serine protease factor Xa (FXa),1 1The abbreviations used are: FXaFVa, FX, FV, factors Xa, Va, X, and V, respectivelyPgnplasminogent-PAtissue-type plasminogen activatorATantithrombinAPCactivated protein CTAFIthrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitorCPBcarboxypeptidase BGEMSA2-guanidinoethylmercaptosuccinic acidDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumPC/PSphosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylserineBAPbarium-adsorbed plasmaPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisLt+FXalysis time with FXaLt-FXalysis time without FXaεACAepsilon-amino caproic acid. a negatively charged phospholipid surface, calcium ion and the cofactor factor Va (FVa)(4Mann K.G. Nesheim M.E. Church W.R. Haley P. Krishnaswamy S. Blood. 1990; 76: 1-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In response to injury, IIa catalyzes the cleavage of fibrinopeptides A and B from fibrinogen, forming fibrin monomers which spontaneously polymerize to form the insoluble fibrin network of a blood clot and prevent the catastrophic loss of blood(5Mann K.G. Jenny R.J. Krishnaswamy S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 915-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). The fibrinolytic cascade works in opposition to the coagulation cascade and is responsible for the removal of a fibrin clot. Plasmin is the terminal protease formed by the fibrinolytic cascade and is formed by the activation of plasminogen by tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA). Plasmin catalyzes the cleavage of fibrin to produce soluble fibrin degradation products thereby removing a fibrin clot(6Bachmann F. Verstraete M. Vermylen J. Lijnen R. Arnout J. Thrombosis and Haemostasis. Leuven University Press, Leuven, Belgium1987: 227-265Google Scholar, 7Gaffney P.J. Fibrinolysis. 1993; 7: 2-8Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Both coagulation and fibrinolysis are in part regulated by the specific inhibitors antithrombin III (AT-III) and α2-antiplasmin, respectively(8Damus P.S. Rosenberg R.D. Methods Enzymol. 1976; 45: 653-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 9Wiman B. Collen D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 84: 573-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Both activation and inhibition of each cascade regulate and maintain a proper balance between fibrin formation and its dissolution(5Mann K.G. Jenny R.J. Krishnaswamy S. Annu. Rev.

Activated protein C (APC) is generated by cleavage of the precursor, protein C, a reaction catalyzed by IIa in complex with thrombomodulin (10Esmon N.L. Owen W.G. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 859-864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). APC can down-regulate II activation by catalyzing the proteolytic inactivation of the essential cofactor in prothrombinase, FVa(11Walker F.J. Fay P.J. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2561-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Protein S, a cofactor for this reaction, is responsible for the species specificity of the anticoagulant activity of APC(12Weinstein R.E. Walker F.J. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 1993; 19: 368-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). APC, however, also appears to up-regulate fibrinolysis(1Bajzar L. Nesheim M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8608-8616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Bajzar L. Fredenburgh J.C. Nesheim M. J. Biol.

Biol. 1990; 281: 235-243Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown that this effect is not due to a direct profibrinolytic effect of APC but rather an indirect effect expressed through inhibition of II activation(1Bajzar L. Nesheim M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8608-8616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This explains why others have observed that the profibrinolytic effect of APC appears to be potentiated by protein S in a species-specific manner(17Weinstein R.E. Walker F.J. Thromb. Res. 1991; 63: 123-131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Our data also indicated that II activation, when it occurs during fibrinolysis and yields either IIa or meizothrombin, is antifibrinolytic(2Cote H.C.F. Stevens W.K. Bajzar L. Banfield D.K. Nesheim M.E. MacGillivray R.T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11374-11380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Those studies also suggested that some preparations of plasminogen contain a contaminant required to reproduce, in a system of defined components, the profibrinolytic effect of APC which is always observed in plasma(1Bajzar L. Nesheim M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8608-8616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Those studies, however, did not provide a molecular explanation for the inhibition of fibrinolysis by II activation during fibrinolysis. This work was undertaken to characterize further the mechanism by which II activation during fibrinolysis prolongs the lysis time of a clot. This was accomplished by producing a turbidometric lysis assay that is both sensitive to a component in plasma which is thrombin-activated and inhibits fibrinolysis (TAFI) and is buffered with respect to the inhibitors AT-III and α2-antiplasmin. Using this assay, we purified a 60-kDa zymogen from plasma which, when activated by IIa, yields an enzyme with carboxypeptidase B (CPB)-like activity. The generation of this activity correlates with a prolongation in lysis time and inhibition of Glu·Pgn activation. Inhibition of IIa generation by APC thus attenuates activation of TAFI and thereby links the profibrinolytic effect of APC to its anticoagulant activity. The recombinant t-PA, Activase, was generously provided by Dr. Gordon Vehar of Genentech (South San Francisco, CA). The lyophilized powder was dissolved in water to a final concentration of 1.0 mg/ml and working stock solutions were prepared as described previously(1Bajzar L. Nesheim M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8608-8616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Porcine CPB was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim (Laval, PQ) as a lyophilized powder that was dissolved in water to 5.0 mg/ml and stored in 20-μl aliquots at −20°C. 2-Guanidinoethylmercaptosuccinic acid (GEMSA), a specific CPB inhibitor, was purchased from Calbiochem. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, nutrient mixture F-12 (1:1) (DMEM/F-12), Opti-Mem, newborn calf serum, and G418 (Geneticin) were purchased from Life Technologies Inc., and methotrexate was purchased from David Bull Laboratories (Vaudreuil, PQ). Phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylserine vesicles (PC/PS, 3:1) were prepared according to the method of Barenholz et al.(18Barenholz Y. Gibbes D. Litman B.J. Goll J. Thompson T.E. Carlson F.D. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 2806-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar) as described by Bloom et al.(19Bloom J.W. Nesheim M.E. Mann K.G. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 4419-4425Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). II and factor X (FX) were purified as described previously(13Bajzar L. Fredenburgh J.C. Nesheim M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16948-16954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). IIa was prepared from II and isolated by a modification of the procedure of Lundblad et al.(20Lundblad R.L. Kingdon H.S. Mann K.G. Methods Enzymol. 1976; 45: 156-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) as described previously(21Mann K.G. Elion J. Butkowski R.J. Downing M. Nesheim M.E. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 286-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). FXa was prepared from FX utilizing the FX activator purified from Russell's viper venom and isolated as described by Krishnaswamy et al.(22Krishnaswamy S. Church W.R. Nesheim M.E. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3291-3299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein C was purified and activated as described previously(13Bajzar L. Fredenburgh J.C. Nesheim M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16948-16954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Factor V (FV) was purified by immunoaffinity chromatography according to the method of Nesheim et al.(23Nesheim M.E. Katzmann J.A. Tracy P.B. Mann K.G. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 249-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). A concentrate of AT-III was kindly provided by Alpha Therapeutics (Los Angeles, CA) and was subjected to affinity chromatography on immobilized heparin as described by Damus and Rosenberg (8Damus P.S. Rosenberg R.D. Methods Enzymol. 1976; 45: 653-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) with the modifications of Nesheim(24Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 245: 14708-14717Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Fibrinogen, >95% clottable, was isolated by the procedure of Straughn and Wagner (25Straughn W. Wagner R.H. Thromb. Diath. Haemorrh. 1966; 16: 198-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and subsequently passed over Lys-Sepharose to remove traces of plasminogen. Glu-plasminogen (Glu·Pgn) was isolated by Lys-Sepharose chromatography, as described previously(26Nesheim M. Fredenburgh J.C. Larsen G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21541-21548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glu·Pgn was coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose CL-4B (Sigma) by a modification of the procedure described by Cuatrecasas(27Cuatrecasas P. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 3059-3065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, Sepharose CL-4B (Pharmacia) (5 ml) was washed at 22°C with 50 ml of both H2O and 2.0 M Na2CO3 under vacuum. The cake of washed Sepharose CL-4B was then activated with 0.5 g of CNBr (0.5 g of CNBr dissolved in 0.5 ml of acetonitrile) for 1.0 min at 22°C and then washed with 100 ml each of ice-cold 0.1 M NaHCO3, H2O, and 0.1 M sodium citrate, pH 6.5, in succession. Five ml of 10 mg/ml Glu·Pgn in 0.1 M sodium citrate, pH 6.5, was then incubated with the activated resin at 4°C for 24 h and for a further 24 h after the addition of 1.0 ml of 1.0 M Tris, pH 8.0. This resulted in a 98% coupling efficiency producing 5.0 ml of a 9.8 mg/ml Pgn-Sepharose resin. Lys-plasminogen (Lys·Pgn) was prepared as described by Nesheim et al.(26Nesheim M. Fredenburgh J.C. Larsen G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21541-21548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by incubation of Glu·Pgn (33 μM) with plasmin (0.1 μM) in 6.2 ml of 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, and 10.0 mM εACA. The reaction was stopped after 2.0 h by passing the mixture over benzamidine-Sepharose, and the flow-through was incubated for 2.0 h at 22°C with 1.0 μM valyl-phenyl-alanyl-lysyl chloromethyl ketone (Calbiochem). Lys·Pgn was precipitated with 80% (NH4)2SO4. The pellet was dissolved in 50% glycerol/H2O and stored at −20°C. The Lys·Pgn preparation contained no Glu·Pgn as assessed by acid-urea gel electrophoresis(28Panyim S. Chalkley R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1969; 130: 337-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1969) Google Scholar). Plasmin was prepared by adding 10.0 ml of Lys-Sepharose to 20 ml of 1.0 mg/ml Glu·Pgn and 50 units/ml human urine urokinase (Calbiochem) in 20 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, pH 8.0 (TBS) and incubating with gentle agitation at 37°C for 1.0 h. The resin was then poured into a column; after washing with 70 ml of TBS, plasmin and residual plasminogen were eluted with 20 mM εACA in TBS, collecting 1.0-ml fractions at 22°C. Protein containing fractions, identified by absorbance at 280 nm, were pooled and passed over a 2.0-ml p-aminobenzamidine Sepharose 6B (Sigma) column in order to separate plasminogen from plasmin. The column was washed with TBS, collecting 1.0-ml fractions at 22°C until the A280 was less than 0.01. Plasmin was then eluted with 20 mM benzamidine in TBS, collecting 1.0-ml fractions. Protein-containing fractions were identified using the BCA assay (Pierce Chemical Co.). Appropriate fractions were pooled (8.0 ml), and plasmin was precipitated by dialysis against 250 ml of ammonium sulfate at 80% saturation with one change overnight at 4°C. After centrifugation (13,000 × g, 5 min, 22°C) of the retentate, the pellet was dissolved in 50% glycerol/water and stored at −20°C until use. From this procedure 400 μl of 17.1 mg/ml plasmin was isolated, amounting to a 34% recovery of 100% active plasmin as determined by active site titration with p-nitrophenylguanidinobenzoate(29Smith R.A.G. Biochem. J. 1986; 239: 477-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The cDNA for α2-antiplasmin in the expression vector pPAB (30Busby S.J. Mulvihill E. Rao D. Kumar A.A. Lioubin P. Heipel M. Sprecher C. Halfpap L. Prunkard D. Gambee J. Foster D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15286-15292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was a kind gift of Sharon Busby of Zymogenetics (Seattle, WA). The expression vector pNUT and baby hamster kidney cells were provided by Dr. Ross MacGillivray of University of British Columbia. Baby hamster kidney cells were cotransfected with pPAB, containing the antiplasmin insert, and pNUT using Ca2PO4 coprecipitation technique(27Cuatrecasas P. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 3059-3065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6490) Google Scholar). The DNA (10 μg of each vector) was precipitated at pH 6.95 and added to the cells and incubated for 4 h. Cells were allowed to recover overnight in DMEM/F-12, supplemented with 5% newborn calf serum. Positive clones were selected in DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 5% newborn calf serum, 440 μM methotrexate, and 400 μg/ml G418. Positive clones were screened for antiplasmin production by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using goat polyclonal capture antibody GA2AP-1IG (Affinity Biologicals, Hamilton, ON) and detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated monoclonal murine antibody (Dr. A. R. Giles, Queen's University, Kingston, ON). One clone (25 μg of antiplasmin/ml of medium/24 h from confluent cells on 10-cm2 wells) was used for roller bottle production of antiplasmin. Antiplasmin was routinely isolated from 24-h conditioned medium from two roller bottles, each containing 150 ml of Opti-Mem supplemented with 80 μM ZnCl2, 220 μM methotrexate, and 200 μg/ml G418. Conditioned medium was diluted 1/3 with 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4 (HB) and passed over a 10-ml Q-Sepharose (Pharmacia) column. The column was washed with 5 column volumes of HB, and antiplasmin was eluted with 0.2 M NaCl in HB. Appropriate fractions were pooled and diluted 1/4 and passed over a 1.0-ml DEAE fast flow (Pharmacia) column at 22°C. The column was washed with 20 ml of HB, and the antiplasmin was eluted with 0.15 M NaCl in HB. Five mg of antiplasmin is typically recovered by this procedure, and the antiplasmin inhibits active site titrated plasmin with a 1:1 stoichiometry. A concentrated stock solution (fibrinogen solution) was produced containing 15.4 μM fibrinogen, 4.2 μM Glu·Pgn, 1.8 μM α2-antiplasmin, 52.6 μM PC/PS vesicles, 44 nM FV, 3.65 μM II, and 5.0 μM AT-III in 20 mM HEPES, 0.15 M NaCl, pH 7.4 (HBS). The assay was performed by adding 40 μl of the fibrinogen solution to 160 μl of assay sample or purified TAFI. Two clots were produced for each sample by pipetting 95 μl of each assay mixture into wells containing 2.0-μl aliquots of IIa (6.0 nM, final), Ca2+ (10 mM, final) and t-PA (441 pM, final) and either buffer or FXa (100 pM, final). Turbidity at 405 nm was then monitored at 2.5-min intervals in a microtiter plate reader thermostatted at 37°C. Lysis time, defined as the time to achieve a 50% reduction of the maximum turbidity, for each clot was determined from the plot of A405versus time. Relative prolongation was then defined as the lysis time determined for clots produced in the presence of FXa relative to the lysis time determined for clots produced in the absence of FXa. Two units of fresh frozen plasma (500 ml), obtained from the Canadian Red Cross (Kingston General Hospital, ON) anticoagulated with acid citrate dextrose, were thawed at 37°C for 0.5 h. The plasma was brought to 80 mM BaCl2 by dropwise addition of 1.0 M BaCl2 with continuous stirring at 4°C. Barium citrate and adsorbed vitamin K-dependent proteins were pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C (these conditions were used in all subsequent centrifugation steps). An aliquot (10 ml) of the supernatant was removed and dialyzed against 2.0 liters of HBS with four changes, for not less than 2.0 h/change, at 4°C to produce barium-adsorbed plasma (BAP). To remove remaining Ba2+ ion, solid (NH4)2SO4 was added directly to the remaining portion of the supernatant to a concentration of 10% saturation. The mixture was stirred for 0.5 h at 4°C, BaSO4 was pelleted by centrifugation, and the supernatant was recovered. The supernatant was brought to 45% saturation (NH4)2SO4 and stirred for 0.5 h at 4°C. Following precipitation and centrifugation, the pellet was discarded, and the supernatant was brought to 70% (NH4)2SO4, stirred for 0.5 h at 4°C, and centrifuged. The resulting pellet was dissolved in 150 ml of HB and dialyzed against 4.0 liters of the same buffer at 4°C with four changes and minimally 2.0 h between changes. Following dialysis the retentate was passed over a 450-ml Q-Sepharose column (5.5 × 19 cm) at 22°C which had been washed with 0.5 M NaCl, HB, and then equilibrated in HB. The eluate during the load was collected into a beaker, and the column then was washed with 600 ml of HB, collecting 10.0-ml fractions. TAFI eluted in a 0-0.2 M NaCl, linear gradient in HB (600 ml/side). The fractions containing activity were pooled, and the sample was concentrated 5-fold using an Amicon concentrator with a PY-10 membrane (Amicon, Oakville, ON). The 15.0-ml concentrate (approximately 100 mg/ml) was then subjected to gel filtration on three columns linked in tandem (2.5 × 102 cm) containing AcA-54 equilibrated in HBS. The column was developed at 4°C with HBS at a flow rate of 0.42 ml/min, collecting 4.4 ml/fraction. Fractions containing activity were pooled and subjected to affinity chromatography at room temperature on a 5.0-ml Pgn-Sepharose CL-4B (9.8 mg/ml resin) column equilibrated in HBS. After washing with 5 column volumes of HBS and then a similar volume of HB, TAFI was eluted with 50 mM εACA, 0.01% Tween 80, HB. Since εACA is antifibrinolytic, these fractions could not be assayed. Therefore, εACA was separated from TAFI by passing the pooled εACA eluate over a 1.0-ml DEAE fast flow column equilibrated in HB and washing with 40 ml of HB. TAFI was then eluted with 0.2 M NaCl, HB. Peak fractions were pooled and stored at 4°C, and subsequent experiments were performed within 48 h of isolation. Microamino acid sequence analyses were performed by the Core Facility for Protein/DNA Chemistry at Queen's University. Sequences were determined following electroblotting of bands, resolved by SDS-PAGE, to polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore, Bedford, MA)(32Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using an Applied Biosystems model 475A amino acid analyzer with on-line phenylthiohydantoin analysis and reverse-phase separation on a C18 column. Quantitative amino acid analysis was performed by HSC Biotechnology Service Centre (Toronto, ON). To determine the extinction coefficient of TAFI, duplicate samples of known A280, containing norleucine as an internal standard, were subjected to hydrolysis with 6.0 N HCl followed by derivatization with phenylisothiocyanate. Separation and quantitation of the derivatized amino acids were accomplished using the Picotag processing method and using absorbance at 254 nm, respectively. The ε280,1.001cm, using the peptide molecular weight of 48,442(3Eaton D.L. Malloy B.E. Tsai S.P. Henzel W. Drayna D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21833-21838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is 26.4 ± 3.6, and this value was used to calculate all concentrations for TAFI. (The molar extinction coefficient is 1.28 × 105M−1 cm−1, which is 1.44-fold greater than that calculated from the tyrosine and tryptophan content(33Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (3003) Google Scholar).) Glu·Pgn and TAFI were iodinated with 125I using IODO-BEADS (Pierce Chemical Co.). IODO-BEADS were first washed with 1.0 ml of TBS; 500 μl of TBS and 1.0 mCi of Na125I (ICN, Mississauga, ON) were added and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. The solution was then removed and added directly to another tube containing Glu·Pgn (2.0 mg/ml) in 500 μl of TBS, and incubation was carried out for 10 min at room temperature. The reaction was quenched by the addition of 10 μl of 1.0 M sodium metabisulfite, and unincorporated 125I was removed by gel filtration on a 10.0-ml Sephadex G-25 column (Pharmacia). The final concentration of 125I-plasminogen was 0.89 mg/ml, and the specific radioactivity was 4.5 cpm/ng. Iodination of TAFI was performed identically except the buffer was HBS and the final concentration was 0.064 mg/ml with a specific radioactivity of 234 cpm/ng. The reaction was carried out in a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube containing 100 μl of TAFI (0.145 mg/ml, 90 μl of 0.153 mg/ml TAFI plus 10.0 μl of 0.064 mg/ml I125-TAFI) in HBS. CaCl2 (1.0 M) was added to a final concentration of 10 mM. A 10-μl aliquot was removed for the zero time point, and the remaining 100 μl was brought to 545 nM IIa by the addition of 9.0 μl of 6.0 μM IIa. The reaction mixture was then incubated at 37°C, and at various times a 10.0-μl aliquot was removed and immediately prepared for SDS-PAGE. Preparation for electrophoresis included the addition of 10.0 μl of HBS and 5.0 μl of a solution consisting of 25% glycerol, bromphenol blue, 5% SDS, 75 mM EDTA, pH 7.4, and heating the mixture for 3.0 min at 90°C. Approximately 1.5 μg of TAFI and 15,000 cpm were loaded per well and run under the conditions of Neville (34Neville Jr., D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 6328-6334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) on a 5-15% gradient minigel (Hoefer, model SE250, Technical Marketing, Ottawa, ON). The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue, destained, dried in Biowrap (BioDesign Inc., Carmel, NY), and subjected to autoradiography using Kodak XAR-5 x-ray film overnight at −70°C. Densitometry was performed using an LKB-2202 densitometer (Pharmacia). The effect of preincubation of TAFI with IIa on lysis time in the presence and absence of FXa and on the rate of hydrolysis of hippuryl-Arg was determined. Incubation of 3.14 μM TAFI with 545 nM IIa in 10.0 mM Ca2+, HBS was carried out in a final volume of 33 μl for various periods of time (0-2.0 h) at 37°C. For each incubation time point a clot was produced by the addition of the fibrinogen solution to wells in which a 1.25-μl aliquot of the TAFI activation medium had been placed, giving a final concentration of 40 nM TAFI and 6.8 nM IIa. Included also in the wells were Ca2+ (10.0 mM, final) and t-PA (441 pM, final) plus or minus FXa. Simultaneously, an aliquot (30 μl) of the TAFI activation medium was removed and added to 1.0 ml of 0.1 mM hippuryl-Arg in 25 mM Tris, 0.1 M NaCl, pH 7.65, and absorbance at 254 nm was monitored over time in a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 4b spectrophotometer(35Folk J.E. Piez K.A. Carroll W.R. Gladner J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 2272-2277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fibrinogen solution diluted 1/5 or a solution of BAP, diluted 1/3 with HBS plus PC/PS vesicles (10.0 μM, final) and II (0.73 μM), were supplemented with GEMSA at various concentrations ranging from zero to 2.0 mM. The correlation between lysis time obtained in the absence and presence of FXa (100 pM) and the time of incubation of TAFI with IIa was determined. Lysis times of clots prepared from 95-μl aliquots (see under “Lysis Assay”) in the presence and absence of FXa (i.e. plus or minus II activation) were determined for each of the GEMSA concentrations. These experiments thus constituted an evaluation of the effect of GEMSA on TAFI-mediated prolongation of lysis. In a similar series of experiments, fibrinogen solution, diluted 1/5, supplemented with GEMSA at various concentrations, and porcine CPB (7.4 nM, final), was used in place of TAFI, and lysis times were determined in the absence of FXa. These experiments were performed to evaluate the effect of GEMSA on the porcine CPB-mediated prolongation of lysis. To investigate the activation of TAFI in a fibrin clot during fibrinolysis, two sets of 12 identical clots were formed from fibrinogen solution containing 110 nM125I-TAFI, in the presence of IIa (6.0 nM, final), Ca2+ (10.0 mM, final) and t-PA (441 pM, final) in the wells of a microtiter plate. One set was formed in the presence of FXa (100 pM) and one set in its absence. At various times a fibrin clot from each series was solubilized by the addition of 100 μl of 0.2 M acetic acid, thereby quenching all reactions. Once the clot was solubilized, 55 μl of a solution composed of 5% SDS, 20% mercaptoethanol, 50 mM EDTA, 20% glycerol/H2O containing bromphenol blue, and 40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, was added, and the solution was heated for 5 min at 90°C. One clot from each series was allowed to lyse completely, and the turbidity profile from these clots was used to determine lysis times. After lysis, this clot was similarly prepared for SDS-PAGE. The samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE; the resulting gel was stained, destained, and dried, and an autoradiogram was produced. To determine the effect of Lys·Pgn on TAFI-induced prolongation of lysis time, two fibrinogen solutions were produced, each identical, except one contained 0.86 μM Glu·Pgn and the other 0.90 μM Lys·Pgn. From each stock solution, six 200-μl samples were produced to which various concentrations of TAFI were added, such that the final concentrations ranged from 0 to 31 nM for each group of six. Clots (100 μl) then were formed in the presence and absence of FXa (see under “Lysis Assay”), and lysis times were determined. Two series of identical clots were formed from fibrinogen solution containing 140 nM TAFI and 0.47 μM"

https://openalex.org/W1592900851,"Regional fat distribution is an important determinant of insulin resistance in obesity. In the current study, the relationship between skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity, mid-thigh muscle composition, and the metabolic profile of muscle was investigated. Muscle composition was assessed by computed tomography of the mid-thigh, and by activities of marker enzymes of aerobic-oxidative and glycolytic pathways and muscle fiber typing using biopsies of the vastus lateralis muscle. Muscle with reduced Hounsfield attenuation on computed tomography scans was increased in proportion to obesity, and was strongly related to insulin resistance, reduced muscle oxidative capacity, and increased anaerobic and glycolytic capacities by muscle. These findings suggest that as part of its expression of insulin resistance, skeletal muscle of obese individuals is also poorly equipped for substrate oxidation and manifests increased storage of fat."

Such ligand-activated signal transduction pathways involve activation of receptor-tyrosine kinases, which initiates a series of phosphorylation events that activate a cascade of serine/threonine kinases converging on the MAP kinase (also called extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)) isoforms, ERK1 and ERK2 (7Alema S.

Cell. 1993; 75: 487-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). This inactivation is mediated, in part, by dephosphorylation of MAP kinases by dual specificity phosphatases called MAP kinase phosphatases (MKPs) that dephosphorylate both the threonine and tyrosine residues phosphorylated by MEK (13Sun H.

PC12 cells originate from a rat pheochromocytoma and retain many features of neural crest-derived cells, most notably the ability to undergo neuronal differentiation upon stimulation by NGF (28Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Adv. Cell. Neurobiol. 1982; 3: 373-414Crossref Google Scholar). Transfection with activated forms of the oncogenes ras, raf-1, and src into PC12 cells is sufficient for differentiation in the absence of NGF stimulation(6Wood K.W. Sarnecki C. Roberts T.M.

As each of these genes has been shown to converge on MAP kinase activation, this implies that components of the MAP kinase cascade are required for neuronal differentiation. More recently it has been shown that the activation of MAP kinase kinase is required and sufficient for PC12 cell differentiation(3Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1845) Google Scholar). Despite our understanding of MAP kinase activation in neuronal differentiation, we know relatively little about MAP kinase inactivation. Initial studies presented here characterize a family of MKPs expressed in PC12 cells.We report the cloning of a novel MKP, MKP-2, that is highly expressed in PC12 cells. MKP-2 mRNA is expressed at moderate levels in nearly all tissues and cells and encodes a phosphatase that inactivates MAP kinase in vitro and MAP kinase-dependent gene transcription in vivo. Its distribution in the central nervous system and regulation in the hippocampus suggest a potential role for this phosphatase in neuronal signaling pathways.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsRestriction and modification enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), Boehringer Mannheim, and Promega. Superscript reverse transcriptase was from Life Technologies, Inc.; Taq DNA polymerase from Perkin-Elmer and Sequenase from U. S. Biochemical Corp.

The 5′ primer was a degenerate primer corresponding to the conserved YDQGGP sequence (5′-TA(T/C)-GA(T/C)-CA(A/G)-GG(G/A/T/C)-GG(G/A/T/C)-CC-3′), while the 3′ primer was specific for MKP-2 (5′-ATGAAGAAACGGGTGCGG-3′) corresponding to MKKRVR sequence (Fig. 1B and 2). This set of primers generated a 336-bp cDNA fragment corresponding to nucleotides 628-963 (Fig. 1B). The PCR reaction consisted of 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 15 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, and 0.5 μg of each primer pair. PCR was allowed to proceed for 30 cycles. Each cycle consisted of 1 min at 94°C, 1 min at 55°C, and 1 min at 72°C in a thermocycler (Perkin-Elmer Cetus). The PCR products were purified and subcloned into pBluescript (SK-) (Stratagene) using restriction enzymes engineered at the ends of each of the primers.Figure 1:Restriction map and sequence of MKP-2 cDNA.

The library was plated onto 20 LB plates and allowed to grow at 42°C to a concentration of 50,000 recombinants/plate. The plaques were then transferred onto nitrocellulose filters in duplicate. The filters were soaked in prehybridization/hybridization buffer (6 × SSC, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 1% SDS, 0.01 M EDTA, 50% formamide, 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA) at 42°C for 1-2 h with gentle agitation. Random primed probe was made as described in the Boehringer Mannheim kit. One to two million cpm/ml of boiled MKP-2 specific probe was added directly to the prehybridization/hybridization mix, and hybridization was allowed to proceed at 42°C for 24 h. The filters were washed in 2 × SSC and 1% SDS for 2 h at 65°C with frequent changes in the wash solution. The final wash was in 1 × SSC and 1% SDS after which the filters were air dried and put on film. After the tertiary screen, three positive plaques were obtained. Phage DNA was isolated by standard methods and digested with EcoRI to release the insert. The inserts obtained were cloned into pBluescript (SK-) and subjected to restriction enzyme mapping and sequencing.SequencingMKP-2 cDNA inserts obtained were sequenced on both strands by the method of Sanger (31Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52363) Google Scholar) using Sequenase reagents (U.S. Biochemical Corp.) according to the protocol suggested by the manufacturer. Multiple internal primers were made to allow sequencing of the complete 800-bp insert. The 4-kb insert was also sequenced using multiple internal primers on both strands through the termination codon and partially into the 3′-untranslated region. Sequences proximal to the polyadenylation signal were also obtained as shown (Fig. 1B).Cell Culture and Drug TreatmentsPC12-GR5 cells (courtesy of Rae Nishi, OHSU, Portland, OR) were grown at 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal calf serum, 10% horse serum, and L-glutamine. Prior to drug treatments, the cells were serum-starved for 24 h with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing no serum and treated with either 100 ng/ml NGF or 20 ng/ml EGF for the indicated times.RNA IsolationTotal cellular RNA was isolated using RNAzol™ B (Biotecx Lab, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, cells were grown to 30-50% confluency in a 100-mm plate, rinsed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and scraped into 1 ml of RNAzol B. After vortexing, 0.1 ml of chloroform was added and incubated on ice for 15 min. The suspension was centrifuged, and the RNA was precipitated from the upper aqueous layer with an equal volume of isopropyl alcohol. After pelleting, the RNA was resuspended in water, quantitated at A260, and used directly for reverse transcriptase PCR or Northern analysis.Northern Blot AnalysisTen μg of total RNA was electrophoresed through a 1.2% agarose formaldehyde gel and transferred onto Magna NT filter (MSI, Westboro, MA) using standard methodology in 6 × SSC. Filters were prehybridized in 3 ml of hybridization buffer (5% SDS, 400 mM NaPO4 pH 7.2, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50% formamide) at 65°C for 4 h in a rotating hybridization oven. 2-5 × 107 cpm/ml of the antisense riboprobe was then directly added to the hybridization buffer, and hybridization was allowed to proceed for 24 h. The next day, filters were initially washed in 1 × SSC at room temperature for 15 min and then washed in (0.05 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, 5 mM EDTA, pH 8) at 70°C for 3-4 h. Filters were autoradiographed at −70°C on Kodac XAR-5 film using Dupont intensifying screens. Quantitations were performed using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager 445 SF, and all signals were normalized to the 18 S and cyclophilin signals respectively.Riboprobe SynthesisThe 336-bp cDNA fragment generated by using the specific MKP-2 primer (described under “Reverse Transcriptase PCR Amplification”) was subcloned in pBluescript (SK-) and was used to synthesize antisense riboprobes by linearizing the plasmid with SalI that was engineered into the 5′ primer. Full-length MKP-1 cDNA (kindly provided by Nicholas Tonks, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY) was subcloned into pBluescript (SK-) and then linearized with BamHI to generate a 1.9-kb MKP-1 riboprobe. Rat cyclophilin (pSP65 1B15) and 18 S ribosomal RNA (18SpSP65) plasmids (kindly provided by James Douglass, Vollum Institute, Portland, OR) were linearized using PstI and HindIII respectively to generate linear antisense riboprobes. Antisense riboprobes were synthesized as described previously(32Misra-Press A. Cooke N.E. Liebhaber S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23220-23229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 μg of template DNA was incubated in transcription reaction mix (40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 6 mM MgCl2, 2 mM spermidine, 10 mM NaCl, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 20 units of RNasin, 0.5 mM each of rATP, GTP, and CTP, 12 μM rUTP, 50 μM [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol), and 15 units of the appropriate RNA polymerase) at 37°C for 60 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 units of RNase-free DNase and incubated at 37°C for 15 min. 25 mM EDTA was then added, samples were phenol-chloroform extracted and ethanol-precipitated. Antisense riboprobes were resuspended in water at a concentration of 1-2 × 106 cpm/μl.In Situ HybridizationMale Sprague-Dawley rats (200-300 g) were anesthetized and perfused with 1000 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde in borate buffer, pH 9.5, at 4°C (fixation buffer). Brains were dissected and incubated in fixation buffer for 8 h and then incubated overnight in fixation buffer with 10% sucrose. Brains were sectioned serially into five series of 30-μm slices with a sliding microtome. Sections were prepared and hybridized as described previously(33Arriza J.L. Stoler M.H. Angerer R.C. Neuron. 1988; 1: 887-900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). The 336-bp MKP-2 specific cDNA fragment was used to synthesize antisense and sense riboprobes. Sections were hybridized with 35S-labeled riboprobes (107 cpm/ml) in 66% formamide, 0.26 M NaCl, 1.32 × Denhardt's solution, 13.2 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 1.32 mM EDTA, 13.2% dextran sulfate, pH 8.0, at 65°C for 24 h. Slides were washed in 4 × SSC, digested with RNase A (20 μg/ml for 30 min at 37°C), and then rinsed in a stringent wash containing 0.1 × SSC at 65°C for 30 min. Sections were dehydrated, dipped in NTB-2 emulsion (Kodak), and developed after 21 days. Light- and darkfield photomicrographs were taken with a Dialux 22 EB at 32× magnification.In Vitro Transcription and Translation ReactionsFull-length MKP-1 and MKP-2 cDNAs were used in a coupled in vitro transcription and translation reaction using TNT™ coupled reticulocute lysate system (Promega) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 1 μg of circular DNA was incubated with 27.5 μl of TNT rabbit reticulocyte lysate, 2 μl of TNT reaction buffer, 1 μl of T7 RNA polymerase, 1 μl of 1 mM amino acid mix minus cysteine, 2 μl of [35S]cysteine (1075 Ci/mmol at 11 mCi/ml), and 1 μl of RNAsin at 40 units/μl in a final volume of 50 μl. The reaction was incubated at 30°C for 1-2 h. The synthesized proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by autoradiography.PC12 Transfection AssaysPC12 cells were grown to approximately 60% confluence prior to transfection. For transient transfection experiments, 3 μg of 5 × Gal4-E1B luciferase and 3 μg of cytomegalovirus (CMV) Gal4-Elk1 transactivation domain2 2Roberson, M. S., Misra-Press, A., Laurance, M. E., Stork, P. J. S., and Maurer, R. A. (1995) Mol. Cell. Biol., in press. were used in combination with either 6 μg of Rous sarcoma virus promoter coupled to globin (control) or constitutively active form of Raf kinase (Raf BxB) (34Bruder J.T. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 545-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) and 30 μg of either pCDNA3 (Invitrogen, Inc.) containing the CMV promoter, CMV MKP-1, or CMV MKP-2. Cells were transfected by calcium phosphate-mediated DNA transfer as described previously(35Howley P.M. Sarver N. Law M.F. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 387-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were prepared 20-24 h following transfection, and luciferase activity was determined as described previously(36Luehrsen K.R. Wet J.R.d. Walbot V. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 216: 397-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar).Western Blotting of PC12 ProteinsPC12 cells were lysed in 200 μl of a 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (25 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 mM vanadate). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford(37Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213510) Google Scholar). One hundred μg of total protein was resolved on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto Immobilon P membrane. The membranes were probed with an MKP-1 antibody (diluted at 1:2000) (Santa Cruz Biotech., Inc.). A horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was used to allow detection of the appropriate bands using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Corp.).Bacterial Expression of MKP-2The catalytic domain of MKP-2 encoded within a carboxyl-terminal 690-bp fragment (C-MKP-2), extending from amino acids 163-393, was subcloned into the PET 23b vector (Novagen) using specific PCR oligonucleotides. This vector provides an amino-terminal epitope tag derived from the T7 capsid protein (T7 tag) that can be detected using specific antibodies (T7 antibody, Novagen). The frame of the resultant cDNA was confirmed by sequencing. This plasmid and the vector alone were used to transform BL21 bacteria (Novagen). A protein of the expected size (28 kDa) was induced upon incubation with 0.4 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside and was detected using anti-T7 capsid antibodies. Prior to phosphatase assays, bacterial extracts were prepared in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mM EDTA) and sonicated. Insoluble debris was pelleted and the supernatant assayed directly.ERK2 Dephosphorylation AssayActivated ERK2 was prepared by incubating 10 ng of recombinant ERK2 (kindly provided by Dr. Edwin Krebs, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington) with 0.1 μg of active MAP kinase kinase (MEK) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) in 1 × MEK buffer (25 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 50 μM [γ-32P]ATP) at 30°C for 30 min. The activation of ERK2 was confirmed by Western blot analysis using an antibody directed against phosphotyrosine(30Druker B. Okuda K. Matulonis U. Salgia R. Roberts T. Griffin J.D. Blood. 1992; 79: 2215-2220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ten ng of activated ERK2 was incubated with 10 μg of bacterial lystates from MKP-2 expressing and nonexpressing cells in 1 × phosphatase buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM dithiothreitol) for 15 min at 30°C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of an equal volume of 2 × Laemmli sample buffer, and the samples were separated by 13% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The dephosphorylation of ERK2 was confirmed by Western blotting with the phosphotyrosine antibody using enhanced chemiluminescence for detection of the signal.Phosphotyrosine Phosphatase AssayThe synthetic peptide Raytide (Oncogene Sciences) was phosphorylated on a unique tyrosine using Src tyrosine kinase activity immunoprecipitated from C3H10T1/2 cells (kindly provided by Sally Parsons, University of Virginia) as described(38Stork P. Misra-Press A. Pan M.-G. Methods Neurosci. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar). Bacterial extracts containing 10-60 μg of bacterial proteins were incubated at 30°C for 30 min with labeled peptide (104 cpm) in 100 μl of 1 × phosphatase buffer (described above). Additional reagents (10 μM vanadate, 20 nM microcystin-leucine-arginine, and 1 μM okadaic acid) were added without prior incubation. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 0.75 ml of stop solution (2 mM NaHP04, 90 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 0.9 M HCl, 4% (v/v) Norit A). Following brief centrifugation, 400 μl of the supernatant was added to 2.5 ml of scintillant, and the released counts from phosphatase activity were measured on a scintillation counter. All phosphatase assays were performed in duplicate.RESULTSPC12 Cells Express Multiple MKPs: Identification and Cloning of a Novel MKPTo identify potential MKPs that are expressed in PC12 cells, a screening strategy involving reverse transcriptase PCR amplification was employed. Alignment of the sequences of the known members of the MKP family (human PAC-1, mouse PAC-1, mouse 3CH134, and VH1) showed areas of high sequence homology particularly surrounding the catalytic core consensus site (HCXAGXXR, where X is any amino acid) (Ref. 23Rohan P.J. Davis P. Moskaluk C.A. Kearns M. Krutzch H. Siebenlist U. Kelly K. Science. 1993; 259: 1763-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar and Fig. 2). Degenerate primers were designed to the conserved amino acid sequence WFNEAI (5′ primer) and the conserved amino acid sequence NFSFMG (3′ primer) surrounding the catalytic core site (Fig. 2). Reverse transcriptase PCR on total RNA from PC12 cells with these two degenerate primers revealed the e"
https://openalex.org/W2010217335,"Initiation factor 4E (eIF-4E) binds to the m7GTP-containing cap of eukaryotic mRNA and facilitates the entry of mRNA into the initiation cycle of protein synthesis. eIF-4E is a phosphoprotein, and the phosphorylated form binds to mRNA caps 3-4-fold more tightly than the nonphosphorylated form. A previous study indicated that the major phosphorylation site was Ser-53 (Rychlik, W., Russ, M. A., and Rhoads, R. E. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 10434-10437). In the present study, we synthesized the phosphopeptide expected to result from tryptic digestion of eIF-4E, O-phosphoseryllysine. Surprisingly, the tryptic and synthetic phosphopeptides did not comigrate electrophoretically. Accordingly, we redetermined the phosphorylation site by isolating a chymotryptic phosphopeptide on reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. The peptide was sequenced by Edman degradation and corresponded to 198QSHADTATKSGSTTKNRF215. The site of phosphorylation was determined to be Ser-209 by four methods: the increase in the ratio of dehydroalanine to serine derivatives during Edman degradation, the release of 32P, the further digestion of the chymotryptic phosphopeptide with trypsin, Glu-C, and Asp-N, and site-directed mutagenesis of eIF-4E cDNA. The S209A variant was not phosphorylated in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system, whereas the wild-type, S53A, and S207A variants were. This site falls within the consensus sequence for phosphorylation by protein kinase C."
https://openalex.org/W2062494005,"The c-cbl protooncogene product (c-Cbl) is a 120-kDa protein that has been shown to bind to the Src homology 3 domains of various proteins, suggesting its involvement in signal transduction pathways. We identified one of the most prominent tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in Fcγ receptor (FcγR)-stimulated macrophages to be c-Cbl. Tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl occurred within 20 s after stimulation and reached maximum levels within 3-5 min. c-Cbl was also tyrosine-phosphorylated in epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor-overexpressing cells upon EGF stimulation, in macrophages in response to CSF-1 treatment, and in v-src transformed cells. Furthermore, we found that c-Cbl associated with these kinases in vivo. In vitro, c-Cbl bound to the Src homology 3 domains of Src, Fyn, and Lyn in both unstimulated and FcγR-stimulated macrophages. Examination of cells by immunofluorescence revealed that c-Cbl is diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm in both unstimulated macrophages and EGF receptor-overexpressing cells and translocated to a more specific compartment of the cell, consistent with the trans-Golgi region, following FcγR clustering and EGF stimulation, respectively. These results suggest that c-Cbl is involved in the signaling pathways utilized by different types of tyrosine kinases.

These results suggest that c-Cbl is involved in the signaling pathways utilized by different types of tyrosine kinases. The c-cbl protooncogene product (c-Cbl) was first identified as the cellular homologue of the viral transforming protein of the murine Cas NS-1 retrovirus(1Langdon W.Y. Hartley J.W. Kinken S.P.

Oncogene. 1991; 6: 653-657PubMed Google Scholar). This retrovirus induces pre-B cell lymphomas and myeloid leukemia in infected newborn and adult mice and transforms different fibroblast cell lines(1Langdon W.Y. Hartley J.W. Kinken S.P.

Oncogene. 1991; 6: 653-657PubMed Google Scholar). The v-cbl oncogene product (v-Cbl) represents a truncated form of its cellular homologue containing only the N-terminal 355 amino acids of c-Cbl. Structurally it possesses a potential nuclear localization signal, and in subcellular fractionation analysis it has been reported to localize to both nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions (3Blake T.J. Heath K.G. Langdon W.Y. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2017-2026Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The protooncogene product, c-Cbl, is a 120-kDa protein that contains additional structural features including a high proportion of basic amino acids, a putative leucine zipper at the C terminus, and a zinc finger-like motif, indicating that it may act as a transcription factor(2Blake T.J. Shapiro M. Morse III, H.C. Langdon W.Y. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 653-657PubMed Google Scholar). However, unlike v-Cbl, c-Cbl has been exclusively localized to the cytoplasm, and immunohistochemical studies suggest that it may be associated with the cytoskeleton(3Blake T.J. Heath K.G. Langdon W.Y. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2017-2026Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar).

We report here that c-Cbl becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to the activation of different tyrosine kinase signaling pathways including stimulation by antibody clustering of the FcγII/III receptors in murine macrophages, mitogen stimulation of fibroblasts and macrophages by the growth factors EGF and CSF-1, respectively, and v-src transformation in fibroblasts. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that FcγR clustering and EGF stimulation also induce the translocation of c-Cbl from its diffuse and reticular cytoplasmic localization in unstimulated cells to a more specific region of the cell, consistent with the trans-Golgi region. Overall, these results suggest the possibility that c-Cbl is recruited in the signal transduction pathways utilized by a variety of tyrosine kinases. To prepare peritoneal macrophages, CD-1 mice received intraperitoneal injections of thioglycolate broth as previously reported(5Greenberg S. Chang P. Silverstein S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3897-3902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Three days following these injections peritoneal exudate cells were isolated by washing the peritoneal cavity with phosphate-buffered saline. More than 90% of the cells were macrophages(5Greenberg S. Chang P. Silverstein S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3897-3902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The murine macrophage cell line P388D1 (American Type Culture Collection, Bethesda, MD, TIB63) was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (Sigma). HER14 cells, an NIH 3T3 stable cell line overexpressing the human EGF receptor (EGFR), were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated calf serum. NIH 3T3 cells overexpressing c-src (c-src 3T3 cells) and Balb/c3T3 cells transformed by v-src (SRD cells) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 5% calf serum. Anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, clone 4G10, and anti-CSF-1 receptor (CSF-1R) antibody were obtained from UBI (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-murine FcγRII/III monoclonal antibody (2.4G2) was purchased from PharMingen (San Diego, CA). F(ab′)2 fragments of goat anti-rat IgG were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc. (West Grove, PA). Rabbit polyclonal anti-c-Cbl antibody (C-15) and anti-EGFR antibody were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). FcγR clustering in peritoneal macrophages and the macrophage cell line P388D1 cells was performed as previously reported(5Greenberg S. Chang P. Silverstein S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3897-3902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were pelleted at 14,000 × g and lysed in ice-cold TNE lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mM Na3VO4, 10 mM NaF, and 20 μg/ml aprotinin). In some experiments, P388D1 cells were stimulated with CSF-1 (25 nM) for 30 s at room temperature and lysed with TNE buffer. HER14 cells were stimulated with EGF (275 ng/ml) for 5 min at 37°C and lysed with HNTG buffer (30 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 mM Na3VO4, 10 mM NaF, and 20 μg/ml aprotinin) as previously reported(6Rozakis-Adcock M. Fernley R. Wade J. Pawson T. Bowtell D. Nature. 1993; 363: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). SRD cells were lysed with either TNE buffer or CHAPS buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 8 mM CHAPS, 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM Na3VO4, 10 mM NaF, and 20 μg/ml aprotinin). Western blotting was performed using ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Corp.) according to the conditions recommended by the supplier. For immunoprecipitation of c-Cbl, cell lysates were precleared with protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) for 1 h and then incubated with 1 μg of anti-c-Cbl antibody for 1 h. Immune complexes were recovered with protein A-Sepharose and extensively washed 3 times with TNE buffer. The protein was eluted by boiling in 1 × sample buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.9, 2 mM EDTA, 3% SDS, 3.75% glycerol, and 180 mM β-mercaptoethanol) for 2 min. Two hundred μg of the cell lysate prepared in TNE buffer was precleared by incubating with GST protein non-covalently bound to glutathione-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) for 2 h at 4°C. After removing the GST-Sepharose beads by centrifugation, the supernatants were incubated with 15 μg of the GST-SH3 fusion proteins and 40 μl of a 1:1 slurry of glutathione-Sepharose for 1 h at 4°C. Cellular proteins bound to the GST-SH3 fusion proteins were washed 3 times with lysis buffer and eluted by boiling in 1 × sample buffer for 2 min. For immunofluorescence analysis, cells were plated on glass coverslips and cultured overnight at 37°C. After the indicated treatments, cells were fixed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature and stained with anti-c-Cbl antibody following the method previously reported(7Horne W.C. Neff L. Chatterjee D. Lomri A. Levy J.B. Baron R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1003-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Microscopy was performed using a confocal microscope (model MRC 600, Bio-Rad) with krypton/argon lasers. Fig. 1 indicates that stimulation of the FcγR by antibody clustering in peritoneal macrophages (A) and the murine macrophage cell line P388D1, which is known to have FcγR (B), induced tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins, which is consistent with previous reports(5Greenberg S. Chang P. Silverstein S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3897-3902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of the majority of these proteins was apparent within 20 s after the addition of the secondary antibody, reached a maximum level within 3-5 min, and significantly diminished by 30 min (Fig. 1A). Due to the appearance of a 120-kDa protein that was rapidly tyrosine-phosphorylated upon FcγR stimulation, we determined whether the c-Cbl protein became tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to FcγR stimulation of macrophages. c-Cbl was immunoprecipitated from unstimulated and stimulated peritoneal macrophages, and the immunoprecipitated material was analyzed by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 1C (Anti-PY blot), FcγR clustering rapidly induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl. This increase in tyrosine phosphorylation was not due to changes in the level of the c-Cbl protein upon FcγR stimulation (Fig. 1C; Anti-Cbl blot). Similar results were obtained in FcγR-stimulated P388D1 cells (data not shown). Members of the Src family of tyrosine kinases are activated upon signaling via Fc receptors (8Eiseman E. Bolen J.B.

Since c-Cbl has been shown to bind to the SH3 domain of Nck(4Rivero-Lezcano O.M. Sameshima J.H. Marcilla A. Robbins K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17363-17366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we then determined whether the c-Cbl protein was able to bind to the SH3 domain of different Src family members. The SH3 domains of Src, Fyn, and Lyn were expressed as GST fusion proteins and purified by glutathione-Sepharose chromatography. Lysates prepared from unstimulated P388D1 cells or FcγR-stimulated cells were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads containing either GST alone or the GST-Src-SH3, GST-Fyn-SH3, or GST-Lyn-SH3 fusion proteins. Cellular proteins bound to the different GST fusion proteins were fractionated by 8% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-c-Cbl antibody. Anti-c-Cbl antibody reacted with a Src, Fyn, and Lyn SH3-binding protein in both unstimulated and stimulated cells (Fig. 2B). In both unstimulated and FcγR-stimulated cells, the GST fusion proteins containing the Src, Fyn, and Lyn SH3 domains bound to a 120-kDa protein that reacted with anti-c-Cbl antibody on Western blots (Fig. 2B). Even though FcγR stimulation led to enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl over the low, basal level of phosphorylation observed in unstimulated cells (Fig. 2A), binding of c-Cbl to the SH3 domains of Src, Fyn, and Lyn appeared to be similar in unstimulated or stimulated cells. These results suggest that binding of c-Cbl to the SH3 domains is not dependent on the tyrosine phosphorylation induced by FcγR stimulation. We then examined whether tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl was specific to FcγR-mediated signaling or whether it could also be induced in other tyrosine kinase signaling pathways. We first tested the ability of c-Cbl to become tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to stimulation of growth factor receptors that possess intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. For this purpose, a cell line, HER14, that expresses high levels of the EGFR was stimulated with EGF, and the macrophage cell line, P388D1, was stimulated with CSF-1. In total cell lysates (TCL), increased tyrosine phosphorylation of a protein with an electrophoretic mobility similar to c-Cbl was observed in response to both EGF and CSF-1 stimulation (Fig. 3, A and B). c-Cbl was then immunoprecipitated from cell lysates of unstimulated and stimulated cells and immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody as before. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, both EGF and CSF-1 induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of immunoprecipitated c-Cbl in HER14 and P388D1 cells, respectively (anti-PY blot). The increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl in EGF and CSF-1-stimulated cells was not due to an increase in the amount of protein in the stimulated cells (Fig. 3, A and B, anti-Cbl blot). Hence, tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl is induced not only after FcγR clustering but also in the signal transduction pathways of various receptor-type tyrosine kinases. We next determined whether the non-receptor tyrosine kinase, Src, induces tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl. As shown in Fig. 3C (anti-PY), c-Cbl does not appear to be tyrosine-phosphorylated in lung fibroblasts that possess endogenous c-Src or in NIH3T3 cells that overexpress the c-Src protein. In contrast, c-Cbl is heavily tyrosine-phosphorylated in v-src-transformed fibroblasts (SRD cells). The level of c-Cbl does not, however, appear to differ in the three types of cultures examined (Fig. 3C, anti-Cbl). Therefore, c-Cbl appears to be tyrosine-phosphorylated by activated non-receptor tyrosine kinases such as the viral Src protein. We then examined the physical association of c-Cbl with various tyrosine kinases. EGFR was immunoprecipitated from HER14 lysates with or without EGF stimulation and immunoblotted with anti-c-Cbl antibody. As shown in Fig. 4A, c-Cbl co-immunoprecipitated with EGFR in stimulated HER14 cells but not in unstimulated cells (Fig. 4A, anti-Cbl). c-Cbl was also physically associated with CSF-1R in P388D1 cells, and the association was enhanced by stimulating the cells with CSF-1 (Fig. 4B, anti-c-Cbl). In both experiments, the amount of the immunoprecipitated receptors did not change upon stimulation with the appropriate ligand (Fig. 4, A and B, anti-EGFR and anti-CSF-1R, respectively). c-Cbl was co-immunoprecipitated with v-Src in SRD cells when cells were lysed in CHAPS buffer (Fig. 4C, C), but the co-immunoprecipitation was not observed when cells were lysed in TNE buffer (Fig. 4C, N). Co-immunoprecipitation of c-Cbl with Src, Fyn, Lyn, or Syk was not observed in macrophages with or without FcγR stimulation (data not shown). Finally, we determined whether the subcellular localization of c-Cbl was altered after stimulation of the different receptors described in the above studies. Utilizing immunocytochemical techniques with anti-c-Cbl antibody in conjunction with confocal microscopy, diffuse staining in the cytoplasm was observed in unstimulated macrophages and in HER14 cells (Fig. 5, A and C, respectively). Whether we stimulated macrophages by antibody clustering of the FcγR or HER14 cells by EGF treatment, c-Cbl was found to translocate similarly upon stimulation and to concentrate in a more specific region in the Golgi area of the cell (Fig. 5, B and D, arrows). In both P388D1 cells and HER14 cells, the translocation began at 3 min after stimulation (data not shown) and was complete after 30 min (Fig. 5, B and D). These results suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl resulting from various types of stimulation similarly alters its subcellular localization. In this report we identify a protein, c-Cbl, that becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to a variety of tyrosine kinase signaling events, including activation of receptors that possess intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity (EGFR and CSF-1R), activation of receptors that recruit cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases (FcγR), and intracellular tyrosine kinases that are constitutively activated (v-Src). In macrophages, rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl was observed in response to FcγR stimulation. Though Fc receptors have no intrinsic tyrosine kinase or tyrosine phosphatase activity, two classes of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases, the Src family and the Syk/ZAP70 family, have been shown to be implicated in signaling via Fc receptors (for review see Ref. 10Ravetch J.V. Cell. 1994; 78: 553-560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). With respect to the Src family, it has been reported that Fc receptor stimulation activates Src family tyrosine kinases in various cell systems(8Eiseman E. Bolen J.B. Nature. 1992; 355: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 9Ghazizadeh S. Bolen J.B. Fleit H.B. J. Biol.

In this study, we report that c-Cbl is able to bind to the SH3 domains of Src, Fyn, and Lyn at least in vitro in both unstimulated and stimulated cells via an association that may be related to the presence of a proline-rich domain in the C terminus of c-Cbl(2Blake T.J. Shapiro M. Morse III, H.C. Langdon W.Y. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 653-657PubMed Google Scholar). In spite of the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl in FcγR-stimulated macrophages and the in vitro binding of c-Cbl to the SH3 domains of Src family tyrosine kinases, we failed to demonstrate the physical association of c-Cbl with Src, Fyn, or Lyn in FcγR-stimulated macrophages. In addition we could not demonstrate the physical association of c-Cbl with Syk. This may either be due to an unstable or very transient association of the kinases tested with c-Cbl in vivo or to the involvement of other kinases in the tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl. In contrast, when tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl was induced by EGF stimulation of fibroblasts overexpressing EGFR and by CSF-1 stimulation of macrophages, co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that c-Cbl was physically associated with activated EGFR and CSF-1R. Since the EGFR and CSF-1R possess intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity(12Carpenter G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 881-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar), our results indicate that tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl is induced in the signaling pathways utilized by receptor-type tyrosine kinases as well. Because c-Cbl has no putative binding sites for activated tyrosine kinase receptors such as SH2 domains(2Blake T.J. Shapiro M. Morse III, H.C. Langdon W.Y. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 653-657PubMed Google Scholar, 13Cantley L.C. Auger K.R. Carpenter C. Duckworth B. Graziani A. Kapeller R. Soltoff S. Cell. 1991; 64: 281-302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2187) Google Scholar), association of c-Cbl to the receptors may occur indirectly via adaptor molecules such as Grb2, Nck, and c-Crk, which are known to bind to activated EGFR (14Egan S.E.

Hu P. Skolnik E.Y. Ulrich A. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5824-5833Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), and, for Nck, to also bind to c-Cbl(4Rivero-Lezcano O.M. Sameshima J.H. Marcilla A. Robbins K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17363-17366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fibroblasts transformed by the v-src oncogene also displayed enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl, and under certain lysis conditions, the v-Src and c-Cbl proteins associated in vivo. On the other hand, c-Cbl was not markedly tyrosine-phosphorylated in normal lung fibroblasts and in a 3T3 cell line that was engineered to overexpress the c-Src protein. Enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl may reflect the fact that the Src protein in v-src-transformed fibroblasts has a higher tyrosine kinase activity than the Src protein in c-src-overexpressing fibroblasts(19Jove R. Hanafusa H. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1987; 3: 31-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Therefore, tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl may depend on Src kinase activation. Immunofluorescence analysis has revealed that c-Cbl was localized in the cytoplasm and showed a diffuse and/or reticular pattern in unstimulated macrophages or HER14 cells. FcγR stimulation of macrophages and EGF stimulation of HER14 cells both induced the translocation of c-Cbl to a somewhat more restricted area of the cell, which, at least morphologically, is reminiscent of the trans-Golgi region. These results suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl induced by various types of stimulation is associated with a change in the subcellular localization of c-Cbl. Although c-Cbl has putative motifs that have been identified in transcription factors and v-Cbl has been reported to have nuclear as well as cytoplasmic localization(2Blake T.J. Shapiro M. Morse III, H.C. Langdon W.Y. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 653-657PubMed Google Scholar, 3Blake T.J. Heath K.G. Langdon W.Y. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2017-2026Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), we have not been able to detect c-Cbl in the nucleus of cells before or after stimulation with different agents. It is interesting to point out that v-Cbl, which localizes in the nucleus, lacks the C-terminal region of c-Cbl, which contains a proline-rich sequence that could be responsible for binding to SH3-containing proteins such as Nck (2Blake T.J. Shapiro M. Morse III, H.C. Langdon W.Y. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 653-657PubMed Google Scholar, 4Rivero-Lezcano O.M. Sameshima J.H. Marcilla A. Robbins K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17363-17366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and, as shown here, members of the Src family. It is therefore possible that the proline-rich domain of c-Cbl associates with the SH3-containing molecules such as Src family tyrosine kinases, adaptor molecules, or cytoskeletal proteins such as α-spectrin, resulting in the retention of the c-Cbl protein in the cytoplasm. Further studies will be required to clarify the physiological role of the tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl in the subcellular localization of the protein as well as its function. While this report was being prepared, tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl has also been reported in Jurkat cells activated via the T cell receptor(20Donovan J.A. Wange R.L. Langdon W.Y. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22921-22924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to what we show here for Src family members, these investigators also showed that c-Cbl associates with the SH3 domains of Grb2, at least in vitro. More recently, it was reported that the expression of v-abl induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl and that Abl and Cbl associated in vivo(21Andoniou C.E. Thien C.B.F. Langdon W.Y. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4515-4523Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Hence, c-Cbl is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to FcγR clustering and CSF-1 binding in macrophages, to EGF binding in HER14 cells, and to v-src and v-abl transformation, as well as in response to T cell receptor activation. For FcγR and EGFR stimulation, this is associated with the translocation of c-Cbl to the central region of the cell, in the trans-Golgi area. The fact that c-Cbl is tyrosine-phosphorylated and translocated in response to different agents may indicate that this protein is involved in a general cellular phenomenon, which follows activation of signal transduction pathways by various types of tyrosine kinases. Further study will be necessary to identify the putative biological role of c-Cbl in tyrosine kinase-mediated cell signaling. We thank Dr. J. S. Brugge for providing the GST-SH3 fusion proteins and the SRD cell line. We also thank Dr. J. Schlessinger for his generous gift of HER14 cells, Dr. D.

Replacement of the secretin receptor amino terminus with that of the VIP receptor resulted in biological responsiveness typical of the VIP receptor (EC50 = 120 nM for secretin, 1.7 nM for VIP). The converse was not true, with this domain of the secretin receptor not able to provide the same response when incorporated into the VIP receptor (EC50 = 50 nM for VIP, 30 nM for secretin). The addition of both the first loop and the amino terminus of the secretin receptor was effective in yielding a secretin receptor-like response (EC50 = 2.0 nM for secretin, 47 nM for VIP). All chimeric constructs expressing selectivity for secretin-stimulated activity bound this hormone with high affinity (IC50 = 0.2-2.2 nM); however, there was divergence between VIP binding and biological activity.

The MMP family consists of matrix-degrading proteinases that share sequence identity (~32-49% at the amino acid level) and common structural domains. In general, these enzymes are secreted as zymogens which are activated within the extracellular space. Catalytic activity is dependent on coordination of zinc and is specifically inhibited by the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases(3Birkedal-Hansen H. Moore W.G.I. Bodden M.K. Windsor L.J.

As a whole, they are able to cleave all extracellular matrix components. Fibroblast-derived interstitial collagenase, neutrophil collagenase, and a recently described collagenase (12Freije J.M.

There are two gelatinase/type IV collagenases of 72 kDa (gelatinase A) and 92 kDa (gelatinase B). The stromelysins and matrilysin have a broad spectrum of susceptible substrates including all basement membrane components. Recently, a 66-kDa membrane-type metalloproteinase has been described that has the capacity to activate other MMPs(13Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A. Yamamoto E. Seiki M. Nature. 1994; 370: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2361) Google Scholar). Macrophage elastase activity was detected in mouse peritoneal macrophage conditioned media in 1975(14Werb Z. Gordon S. J. Exp. Med. 1975; 142: 361-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), and a 22-kDa protein responsible for this activity was isolated in 1981(15Banda M.J. Werb Z. Biochem.

Cloning and expression of these cDNAs demonstrated that macrophage elastase is a distinct member of the metalloproteinase gene family with potent elastolytic activity and a broad substrate specificity similar to the stromelysins. HME mRNA and protein are expressed in human alveolar macrophages derived from cigarette smokers. Given the abundance of macrophages in the lower airways, we have targeted the HME gene as a potential candidate in the pathogenesis of pulmonary emphysema. Similar to other MMPs, macrophage elastase activity is most likely regulated both at the transcriptional (1Matrisian L.M.

Activation of the secreted proenzyme within the extracellular space and inhibition by tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases represent post-translational regulation. Macrophage elastase mRNA and protein are up-regulated by endotoxin and inhibited by glucocorticoids(16Shapiro S.D. Griffin G.L. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Welgus H.G. Senior R.M.

To begin to understand the basis for expression of HME in normal and pathologic states, the aim of this study was to characterize the structure and function of the gene for human macrophage metalloelastase. 250,000 plaques from a human genomic (leukocyte) library constructed in EMBL3 were screened using full-length MME cDNA as the probe. We isolated the most strongly hybridizing duplicate-positive clone to homogeneity. Phage DNA was purified, and the insert was released with XhoI and cut to completion with several restriction enzymes. Digested DNA was transferred to GeneScreen Plus (Dupont NEN), and Southern hybridization was performed using MME cDNA as the probe. Two strongly hybridizing EcoRI fragments of 6 kb and 2.4 kb were subcloned into pUC 9 and sequenced on both strands using the dideoxy chain termination method of Sanger and cloned T7 DNA polymerase (Sequenase 2, U. S. Biochemical Corp.). DNA sequences were compiled with the Geneworks program (IntelliGenetics, Inc.). These fragments contained 3 kb of the 5′-flanking region as well as exons 1 through 5. To obtain the remainder of the HME gene as well as closely related genes, a human genomic library constructed in the P1 bacteriophage was screened (Genomes Systems Inc., St. Louis, MO). This library, which contains inserts averaging 85 kb in length, was screened by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using oligonucleotide primers between exon 3 and exon 4. A single clone containing the entire HME gene was isolated and DNA was prepared(20Smoller D.A. Petrov D. Hartl D.L. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1991; 100: 487-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). PCR products between consecutive exons were subcloned and intron-exon borders were obtained by sequencing. Southern hybridization was performed to map linked genes as described below. To localize the chromosomal locus encoding the HME gene, a genomic probe (6 kb) was labeled by nick translation with biotin-11-dUTP and used for fluorescence in situ hybridization as described by Zimonjic et al.(21Zimonjic D.B. Popescu N.C. Matsui T. Ito M. Chihara K. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1994; 65: 184-185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Popescu et al.(22Popescu N.C. Zimonjic D.B. Hatch C. Bonner W. Genomics. 1994; 20: 333-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Chromosomes obtained from methotrexate-synchronized normal peripheral leukocyte cultures were pretreated with RNase, denatured for 2 min at 70°C in 2 × SSC, 70% (v/v) formamide, and hybridized with the DNA probe (200 ng) in 2 × SSC, 50% (v/v) formamide, 10% (w/v) dextran sulfate, 2 × Denhardt's solution, 1% Tween 20 (v/v), and 50 μg of human Cot-1 DNA (Life Technologies, Inc.) probe for 18 h at 37°C. Posthybridization washing was in 2 × SSC, 50% formamide at 42°C (3 × 6 min each) followed by 0.1 × SSC at 60°C (3 × 6 min each). Biotin-labeled DNA was detected by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated avidin DCS and antiavidin antibodies (Vector Laboratories). Chromosomes were counterstained with propidium iodide and examined with an Olympus BH2 epifluorescence microscope. Digital image acquisition and analysis as well as posthybridization chromosome banding have been described in detail elsewhere(21Zimonjic D.B. Popescu N.C. Matsui T. Ito M. Chihara K. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1994; 65: 184-185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Popescu N.C. Zimonjic D.B. Hatch C. Bonner W. Genomics. 1994; 20: 333-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). High molecular weight genomic DNA samples from four different lymphoblastoid cell lines (CGM, MKH, KH18, and JB18) were prepared in low melting point agarose as described(23Carle G.F. Olson M.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 5647-5664Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar, 24Vollrath B. Davis R.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 7865-7876Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Restriction digests were performed by incubating a cell plug with 100 units (~10 units/μg of DNA) of the following restriction enzymes; BssHII, EagI, SacII, SfiI, SmaI, XhoI, NaeI, MluI, and ClaI. Restriction fragments were separated in a 1% agarose gel using a contour-clamped, homogeneous electric field (CHEF DR2, Bio-Rad) apparatus(24Vollrath B. Davis R.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 7865-7876Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Electrophoresis conditions included a 6 V/cm (160 V) field strength, 0.5 × TBE buffer at 12°C, and 20-24-h running times. A linear ramped switch interval that started at 20 s and ended at 40 s resolved fragments between 50 and 200 kb, and intervals between 35 and 70 s resolved bands between 400 and 800 kb. DNA fragments were depurinated in 0.25 N HCl and transferred to reinforced nitrocellulose (Nitroplus 2000, 0.45 μm; Micron Separations, Westboro, MA) using an ammmonium acetate procedure (25Smith C.L. Summers M.O. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 109: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar) and routine blotting techniques(26Southern E. Methods in Enzymology. 1979; 68: 152-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Filters were baked (80°C for 2 h) and then hybridized to 32P-labeled probes (macrophage metalloelastase, stromelysin-1, and interstitial collagenase full-length cDNA probes) in a hybridization mixture containing 40% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, 4 × SSC, 1 × Denhardt's solution, and 10 μg/ml sheared salmon sperm DNA. Blots were washed twice in 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature and twice in 0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 50°C. Autoradiograms were developed between 1 and 7 days. Filters were stripped of a probe by incubation in 0.1% SDS at 80°C. Fragment sizes were determined by comparison to concatemers of λ phage DNA and the electrophoretic karyotype of Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain AB1380(23Carle G.F. Olson M.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 5647-5664Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). The junctions between exons 1-5 and introns 1-4 were determined by sequencing the entire region using the clone derived from the EMBL3 genomic library. To determine the organization of exons 6-10 and introns 5-9, we amplified fragments spanning consecutive exons by the polymerase chain reaction and sequenced the exons and intron-exon junctions. Oligonucleotides used for PCR were selected based on HME cDNA sequence. PCR conditions included ~100 ng of P1 DNA, 250 μM dNTP, 20 pmol of each oligonucleotide primer, and 2.5 units of KlenTaq-LA in a buffer of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.2, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 16 mM (NH4)2SO4, 150 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. The PCR amplification reactions consisted of a 20-s denaturation at 99°C, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 99°C for 1 s, annealing at 55°C for 30 s, and extension at 72°C for 1 min 30 s. Amplified introns were sized by agarose gel electrophoresis that included DNA (base pair) standards. Each PCR fragment was gel-purified (Bioclean kit, U.S. Biochemical Corp.), subcloned in pNOT (5′Prime-3′Prime, Boulder, CO), and sequenced. These sequences were compared with human HME cDNA sequences to identify exonic sequences and intron-exon boundaries. Primer extension was used to determine the transcription start site of the human macrophage elastase gene. A synthetic antisense oligonucleotide primer (CTCCAGAAGCAGTGGCCTGCAGGAGCAGTA) located in exon 1 downstream of the ATG was end-labeled with [γ-32P] ATP (Amersham International, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). Human placenta poly(A+) RNA (10 μg) (Clontech) was primed for 2 h at 55°C and reverse-transcribed with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (10 units) (Promega) for 90 min at 42°C. The primer-extended product was then digested with 500 ng of DNase-free RNase A for 30 min at 37°C. Ammonium acetate was added to a final concentration of 2 M, and the sample was extracted with phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and precipitated with ethanol. Following lyophilization, the sample was dissolved in sterile water, and the primer-extended product was analyzed on a 6% polyacrylamide, 8 M urea gel in parallel with an HME genomic subclone sequenced with the same primer and a 32P-labeled DNA ladder obtained by digestion of plasmid ϕX174 with HinfI. A Northern blot containing equal amounts (2 μg) of poly(A)+ RNA from various normal human tissues was obtained from Clontech. Northern blot analysis of RNA was performed under high stringency conditions as described previously (16Shapiro S.D. Griffin G.L. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Welgus H.G. Senior R.M.

Chem. 1993; 268: 23824-23829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using full-length HME cDNA as the probe. In situ hybridization was performed as described in detail by Prosser et al.(27Saarialho-Kere U.K. Pentland A.P. Birkedal-Hansen H. Parks W.C. Welgus H.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 28Prosser I.W. Stenmark K.R. Suthar M. Crouch E.C. Mecham R.P. Parks W.C. Am. J. Pathol. 1989; 135: 1073-1088PubMed Google Scholar). cRNA probes were generated using a 400-bp HME cDNA fragment (bp 1-400) subcloned into pGEM7(+) and linearized to generate both sense and antisense strands. The cDNAs were then transcribed in the presence of [α-35S]UTP with T7 or SP6 polymerase (Promega). Tissue sections of term human placenta (5 μm) were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, and digested with proteinase K. Sections were then rinsed in 0.1 M triethanolamine, acetylated in 0.25% acetic anhydride, and dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol solutions. The sections were covered with 25-50 μl of hybridization buffer containing 2 × 104 cpm/μl of 35S-labeled RNA probe. Sections were incubated at 55°C for 18 h in a humidified chamber. After hybridization, unhybridized cRNA probe was removed by digestion with RNase A, and slides were washed under stringent conditions. Slides were hand-dipped in Kodak NT/B2 emulsion, followed by autoradiographic exposure for 2 weeks, after which time the photographic emulsion was developed and stained with hematoxylin-eosin. Immunohistochemical staining was performed on the term placenta specimens described above using the immunoperoxidase staining technique (Vectastain ABC Kit; Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The primary antibody for HME represents affinity-purified antisera directed against a peptide previously demonstrated to be specific for HME (17Shapiro S.D. Kobayashi D.K. Ley T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23824-23829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) used in a 1:1000 dilution. Macrophages were identified using anti-CD68 antiserum at a dilution of 1:2000. The incubation time for the primary and secondary antibody was 30 min each at room temperature. Slides were counterstained with hematoxylin. Controls were performed with nonimmune rabbit serum. The HME 5′flanking sequence (HindIII-XhoI fragment, −2,750 to +41) was subcloned upstream of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene in the pCAT vector. Control constructs included pBLCAT2, a CAT construct driven by the HSV thymidine kinase promoter, and a promoter-less CAT construct, pSKCAT. In addition, cells were cotransfected with the HSVtk-β-galactosidase plasmid which was used as an internal control for transfection efficiency. Murine macrophage P388D1 cells, cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, were used to assess expression in macrophages and LPS responsiveness. These cells express murine macrophage elastase basally with up-regulation of murine macrophage elastase in response to LPS, similar to human macrophages and HME. In addition, unlike human mononuclear phagocyte cell lines, these cells do not require differentiation with phorbol esters or other agents, which complicate interpretation of results. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells, cultured in endothelial basic medium (with 30% human serum), were also used for transient transfection experiments. Transient transfections were performed with 10 μg of each plasmid (1 μg of HSVtk-β-galactosidase) on subconfluent cultures using lipofectamine as described by the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.). The transfection medium was changed after 6 h of incubation and replaced with fresh medium ± LPS. After a total of 24 h, the cell extracts were normalized for β-galactosidase activity, and CAT activity was determined by incubation of cell extracts with [14C]chloramphenicol. Acetylated and nonacetylated forms were separated by thin layer chromatography followed by autoradiography and scintillation counting. To characterize the HME gene, two EcoRI fragments obtained from screening a human genomic DNA library constructed in EMBL3 were subcloned and sequenced on both strands in their entirety. This allowed us to identify exons 1-5 of HME. To complete the 3′ portion of the gene, a P1 clone of ~85 kb containing the entire HME gene was isolated. The polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify fragments between consecutive exons. These fragments were subcloned and used to determine exon sequence, intron-exon borders, and intron sizes. Exons 6-10 and introns 5-9 were identified by this strategy. Overall, the HME gene spans 13 kb and contains 10 exons and 9 introns (Fig. 1 and). Exon sizes range from 92 bp (exon 9) to 247 bp (exon 2), and introns range from 100 bp (intron 3) to 2,600 bp (intron 8). The intron-exon junctions, determined by comparing HME genomic and HME cDNA sequences, conformed to the GT/AG rule for splice junctions (Table I)(29Breathnach R. Chambon P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 349-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (3283) Google Scholar). Exon nucleotide sequences did not differ from the previously reported cDNA sequence(17Shapiro S.D. Kobayashi D.K. Ley T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23824-23829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Gene for HME Is Located on Chromosome 11q22.2-22.3 by Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization (FISH)-In normal human prometaphase and metaphase chromosomes hybridized with a biotinylated HME probe, a specific fluorescent signal was detected in 127 (84.67%) of 150 randomly selected spreads with low nonspecific fluorescein isothiocyanate background. Hybridization signal consisting of two symmetrical fluorescent spots on both chromatids at the long arm of at least one chromosome 11 was observed in 93 (62%) of the analyzed chromosome spreads (Fig. 2A). In 33 metaphases (22%), both chromosomes 11 displayed doublets. Such a signal was not observed on other chromosomes. The position of symmetrical doublets was determined by on-screen analysis of enlarged digital images of 28 chromosomes from 25 well-banded metaphases (Fig. 2B) with minimal chromosome overlapping. Direct image comparisons of labeled and G-banded spreads as well as of pter-signal-qter ratios for each of the labeled chromosomes, allowed the localization of the HME gene locus to chromosome region 11q22.2-22.3.Table IExon and intron organization of HME geneTable IExon and intron organization of HME geneFigure 2:Localization by fluorescence in situ hybridization of the HME gene to human chromosome 11q22.2-22.3.

Genomics. 1992; 16: 289-291Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar), we performed pulsed-field gel electrophoresis on samples of high molecular weight genomic DNA. Genomic DNA was derived from four different lymphoblastoid cell lines digested with rare cutting restriction enzymes. Restriction fragments were transferred to Nitroplus and hybridized with full-length cDNAs of HME, stromelysin 1, and interstitial collagenase. Results, summarized in Table II, show interstitial collagenase hybridized to different fragments for all restriction digests except for MluI, where all probes hybridized to a large nonresolved fragment located in the compression zone of >1,000 kb. HME and stromelysin 1, on the other hand, hybridized with the same fragments for nearly all of the digests performed with the exception of ClaI. The smallest band that both HME and stromelysin 1 hybridized with was 62 kb, suggesting that these genes are located within 62 kb of each other. To confirm linkage of HME to stromelysin-1, we performed Southern hybridization on restriction digests of the P1 genomic clone containing HME (data not shown). Both HME and stromelysin 1 probes hybridized to the P1 clone, but to different restriction fragments within the resolved area of the gel. Interstitial collagenase and stromelysin 2-specific probes did not hybridize with the P1 DNA restriction digests.Table IISize of hybridizing fragments with pulsed field gel electrophoresis Primer extension analysis was performed to determine the initiation site of transcription. Human placenta was used as the source of poly (A+) RNA, and a 30-bp antisense oligonucleotide complementary to nucleotides 59 to 88 in the first exon was radiolabeled and used to prime cDNA synthesis (Fig. 3). Alignment of the extended product with HME genomic DNA sequenced with the same primer was performed on a denaturing gel. Length of the extended product indicated that transcription of HME RNA initiates 41 bases upstream from the translation initiation site. The transcription initiation site is in a pyrimidine-rich region, a common feature of the cap site sequence(29Breathnach R. Chambon P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 349-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (3283) Google Scholar). 1.2 kb of the 5′-flanking region of the HME gene was sequenced on both strands, and potential cis-acting regulatory elements were identified (Fig. 4). A putative TATA box was identified, ending 29 bp upstream from the transcription initiation site. This is within the predicted distance relative to the site of transcription initiation (31Bucher P. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 563-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar) and provides confirmation that our cap site is correctly identified at position +1. Of note, TATA boxes have been found in several other MMP genes(32Gaire M. Magbanua Z. McDonnell S. McNeil L. Lovett D.H. Matrisian L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2032-2040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), including mouse macrophage elastase (MME) (not shown). No canonical CAAT element was found for HME as is the case for all MMP genes to date. Major potential cis-acting elements identified within the 5′-flanking region include an AP-1 site (−74 bp) (18Angel P. Baumann I. Stein B. Delois H. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2256-2266Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar) and a PEA3 binding site (−335 bp)(33Gutman A. Wasylyk B. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2241-2246Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). These elements have also been identified in other MMP genes(32Gaire M. Magbanua Z. McDonnell S. McNeil L. Lovett D.H. Matrisian L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2032-2040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The AP-1 site recognizes a protein complex encoded by members of the fos and jun oncogene family. The PEA3 binding site interacts with the products of the ets gene family. Both AP-1 and PEA3 have been found in other genes to act synergistically and confer responsiveness to phorbol esters and a variety of cytokines, growth factors, and oncogenes. Other potential cis-acting elements include LBP-1 and TRF. These elements have previously been found in viral promoters. The function"
https://openalex.org/W1984282611,"Ran/TC4 is a member of the Ras superfamily of GTPases. It is unusual in being predominantly nuclear and because it possesses an acidic -DEDDDL sequence instead of a consensus prenylation domain at the C terminus. Ran is required for nuclear protein import and cell cycle progression, and has been implicated in mRNA processing and export and DNA replication. The inhibition of cell cycle progression by a dominant gain-of-function mutant of Ran has been shown to be abrogated by removal of the -DEDDDL sequence, suggesting that this domain is essential for Ran function. We demonstrate here that the -DEDDDL sequence stabilizes GDP binding to Ran, and that the domain is required for high affinity interaction with a Ran-binding protein, HTF9A/RanBP1. HTF9A functions as a co-stimulator of Ran-GAP (GTPase activating protein) activity on wild-type Ran, but in the absence of the acidic C terminus of Ran, HTF9A behaves as a Ran-GAP inhibitor. An antibody directed against the C-terminal region preferentially recognizes the GTP-bound form of Ran, suggesting that this domain undergoes a nucleotide-dependent conformational change. The results suggest that the acidic C-terminal domain is important in modulating the interaction of Ran with regulatory factors, and implicate Ran-binding proteins in mediating the effects of Ran on cell cycle progression."
https://openalex.org/W2017776273,"We measured gluconeogenesis (GNG) in rats by mass isotopomer distribution analysis, which allows enrichment of the true biosynthetic precursor pool (hepatic cytosolic triose phosphates) to be determined. Fractional GNG from infused [3-13C]lactate, [1-13C]lactate, and [2-13C]glycerol was 88 ± 2, 89 ± 3, and 87 ± 2%, respectively, after 48 h of fasting. [2-13C]Glycerol was the most efficient label and allowed measurement of rate of appearance of intrahepatic triose phosphate (Ra triose-P), by dilution. IV fructose (10-15 mg/kg/min) increased absolute GNG by 81-147%. Ra triose-P increased proportionately, but endogenous Ra triose-P was almost completely suppressed, suggesting feedback control. Interestingly, 15-17% of fructose was directly converted to glucose without entering hepatic triose-P. IV glucose reduced GNG and Ra triose-P. 24-h fasting reduced hepatic glucose production by half, but absolute GNG was unchanged due to increased fractional GNG (51-87%). Reduced hepatic glucose production was entirely due to decreased glycogen input, from 7.3 ± 1.8 to 1.1 ± 0.2 mg/kg/min. Ra triose-P fell during fasting, but efficiency of triose-P disposal into GNG increased, maintaining GNG constant. Secreted glucuronyl conjugates and plasma glucose results correlated closely. In summary, GNG and intrahepatic triose-P flux can be measured by mass isotopomer distribution analysis with [2-13C]glycerol. We measured gluconeogenesis (GNG) in rats by mass isotopomer distribution analysis, which allows enrichment of the true biosynthetic precursor pool (hepatic cytosolic triose phosphates) to be determined. Fractional GNG from infused [3-13C]lactate, [1-13C]lactate, and [2-13C]glycerol was 88 ± 2, 89 ± 3, and 87 ± 2%, respectively, after 48 h of fasting.

E1 catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvic acid and reductive acetylation of lipoic acid residues of dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase (E2). E2 transfers acetyl moieties to CoA, and lipoic residues are reoxidized by dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (E3) with the formation of NADH. Mammalian E1 is a tetramer (α2β2) with molecular mass of 154 kDa(1Reed L.J. Accts. Chem. Res. 1974; 7: 40-46Crossref Scopus (648) Google Scholar, 2Patel M.S. Roche T.E. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 3224-3233Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). It has two active sites(3Khailova L.S. Korotchkina L.G. Biochem. Int. 1982; 5: 525-532Google Scholar), that are most probably composed of amino acid residues from both E1α and E1β subunits(4Robinson B.H. Chun K. FEBS Lett. 1993; 328: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 5Korotchkina L.G. Tucker M.M. Thekkumkara T.J. Madhusudhan K.T. Pons G. Kim H. Patel M.S. Protein Express. Purif. 1995; 6: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Several active site residues (cysteine, tryptophan, arginine, lysine, and histidine) have been found to take part in active site formation(6Khailova L.S. Korotchkina L.G. Severin S.E. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 573: 36-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 7Stepp L.R. Reed L.J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 7187-7191Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Three of these amino acid residues were identified in bovine E1: namely, the Cys-62 equivalent of human α-subunit(8Ali M.S. Roche T.E. Patel M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22353-22356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Trp-135 of the human β-subunit,2 2M. S. Ali, B. C. Shenoy, D. Eswaran, L. A. Andersson, T. E. Roche, and M. S. Patel, unpublished data. and Arg-239 of the human β-subunit.3 3D. Eswaran, M. S. Ali, B. C. Shenoy, L. G. Korotchkina, T. E. Roche, and M. S. Patel, unpublished data. E1 is regulated in the PDC by phosphorylation-dephosphorylation carried out by specific regulatory enzymes: E1-kinase and phospho-E1-phosphatase, respectively(9Linn T.C. Pettit F.H. Reed L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1969; 62: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 10Linn T.C. Pettit F.H. Hucho F. Reed L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1969; 62: 227-234Crossref Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Three serine residues were shown to be phosphorylated and designated site 1 (Ser-264), site 2 (Ser-271), and site 3 (Ser-203) because of the extent and the rate of phosphorylation(11Yeaman S.J. Hutcheson E.T. Roche T.E. Pettit F.H. Brown J.R. Reed L.J. Watson D.C. Dixon G.H. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 2364-2370Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of site 1 was correlated with major inactivation of the enzyme; and half-of-the-site reactivity was exhibited as phosphorylation of only one serine residue of one of the two α-subunits was sufficient for complete inactivation of the enzyme(11Yeaman S.J. Hutcheson E.T. Roche T.E. Pettit F.H. Brown J.R. Reed L.J. Watson D.C. Dixon G.H. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 2364-2370Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The roles of sites 2 and 3 remain to be determined. The mechanism of inactivation is also not well understood. It was found that phosphorylation of bovine E1 inhibited all partial reactions leading to formation of 2-hydroxyethylidene-thiamin pyrophosphate (HETPP)(12Walsh D.A. Cooper R.H. Denton R.M. Bridges B.J. Randle P.J. Biochem. J. 1976; 157: 41-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Spectral studies on pigeon breast muscle E1 showed that phosphorylated E1 was able to bind thiamin pyrophosphate (TPP) (with less affinity) and was able to interact with HETPP, but could not bind the substrate pyruvate(13Korotchkina L.G. Khailova L.S. Severin S.E. Biokhimiya. 1993; 58: 1503-1512PubMed Google Scholar).We recently coexpressed the mature forms of human E1α and E1β subunits in Escherichia coli M15 cells, and recombinant human E1 was purified using affinity chromatography (5Korotchkina L.G. Tucker M.M. Thekkumkara T.J. Madhusudhan K.T. Pons G. Kim H. Patel M.S. Protein Express. Purif. 1995; 6: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This coexpression system has permitted a study of the regulation of E1 by phosphorylation through the use of site-directed mutagenesis. This paper describes a study of mutants of the three phosphorylation sites. All three sites were found to be phosphorylated by the E1-kinase bound to the E2, independent of the other two sites with concomitant inactivation of the enzyme and were dephosphorylated by the phospho-E1-phosphatase with resulting reactivation of E1. Replacement of serine by alanine at site 1 resulted in a reduction in specific activity of native E1.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsRestriction and modification enzymes were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Ni-nitrilotriacetic-agarose (Ni-NTA-agarose) was obtained from Qiagen. pQE-9 and E. coli M15 cells were kindly provided to us by Dr. Stuart F. J. Le Grice of Case Western Reserve University, and pQE-6HE11α, pQE-3-E1β, and pQE-9-6HE1α/E1β were recently constructed in this laboratory(5Korotchkina L.G. Tucker M.M. Thekkumkara T.J. Madhusudhan K.T. Pons G. Kim H. Patel M.S. Protein Express. Purif. 1995; 6: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Recombinant human dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (E3) was expressed using a pQE-9-6HE3 expression vector in E. coli M15 and purified in this laboratory.4 4T.-C. Liu, L. G. Korotchkina, S. Hyatt, N. N. Vettakkorumakankav, and M. S. Patel, unpublished data. Bovine kidney E1, the dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase-protein X-E1 kinase (E2-X-kinase) subcomplex, and the phospho-E1-phosphatase were a generous gift of Dr. Thomas E. Roche of Kansas State University. Recombinant E1-kinase was kindly provided by Dr. Robert Harris of Indiana University. Bovine heart E2-X-kinase was purified by a modified method (14Stanley C.J. Perham R.N. Biochem. J. 1980; 191: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). [γ-32P]ATP (25-50 Ci/mmol) was purchased from ICN.Site-directed MutagenesisSite-directed mutagenesis was carried out by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The mutations in the E1α cDNA of the site 1-MS1 (S264A), site 2-MS2 (S271A), or site 3-MS3 (S203A) were made by a two-stage procedure (15Landt O. Grunert H.P. Hann U. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 96: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar) using pQE-9-6HE1α, single mutagenic primer (MS1, MS2, or MS3) and two primers for 5′ and 3′ ends including BamHI sites preceding the first codon and after the stop codon of E1α sequence. The amplified, mutated E1α cDNA was digested with BamHI and ligated to pQE-9 (enabling polyhistidine extension at the NH2 terminus of the recombinant protein) yielding pQE-9-6HE1α-MS1 (MS2 or MS3). For construction of a coexpression vector pQE-9-6HE1α-MS1/E1β, pQE-9-6HE1α-MS1 was digested with SalI and PvuI to remove the promoter region and E1α cDNA, and ligated with fragment of pQE-3-E1β digested with XhoI and PvuI, having the E1β sequence (Fig. 1). In the same way pQE-9-6HE1α-MS2/E1β and pQE-9-6HE1α-MS3/E1β were constructed. For construction of pQE-9-6HE1α-MS1,2/E1β (with mutations at sites 1 and 2), pQE-9-6HE1α-MS1 was used as a template for PCR with a mutagenic primer-MS2, and a coexpression vector was constructed as described above. For construction of pQE-9-6H-E1α-MS1,3/E1β (with mutations at sites 1 and 3), pQE-9-6HE1α-MS1/E1β and pQE-9-6HE1α-MS3/E1β were digested with XhoI and BglII and fragments carrying the mutations were ligated. In the same way pQE-9-6HE1α-MS2/E1β and pQE-9-6H-E1α-MS3/E1β were combined to obtain pQE-9-6H-E1α-MS2,3/E1β (with mutations at sites 2 and 3), and pQE-9-6H-E1α-MS1,2/E1β and pQE-9-6H-E1α-MS3/E1β were used for construction of pQE-9-6H-E1α-MS1,2,3/E1β. The vectors for expression of the E1 mutants were transformed into E. coli M15 cells containing the pDMI.1 plasmid, producing the lac repressor. The correct orientation and the sequences of each human E1α cDNA in the constructed vectors were confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion analyses and sequencing(16Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52349) Google Scholar).Overexpression and Purification of Recombinant Wild-type and Mutant E1sOverexpression and purification of recombinant wild-type and mutant E1s using affinity chromatography on Ni-nitrilotriacetic-agarose (Ni-NTA-agarose) column were performed as described recently(5Korotchkina L.G. Tucker M.M. Thekkumkara T.J. Madhusudhan K.T. Pons G. Kim H. Patel M.S. Protein Express. Purif. 1995; 6: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Ten mg of recombinant E1s were obtained from 4 liters of bacterial culture.Measurements of Activity and Kinetic ParametersProtein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford using bovine serum albumin as a standard(17Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213288) Google Scholar). Activity of E1 was determined in three assay systems: (i) by reduction of NAD−1 after reconstitution with purified bovine E2-X-kinase subcomplex and human recombinant E3 according to the method of Roche and Reed (18Roche T.E. Reed L.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1972; 48: 840-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar); (ii) by the rate of reduction of the artificial electron acceptor 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP) at 600 nm(19Khailova L.S. Bernhardt R. Huebner G. Biokhimiya. 1977; 42: 113-117PubMed Google Scholar); and (iii) by the production of 14CO2 from [1-14C]pyruvate(20Kerr D.S. Ho L. Berlin C.M. Lanone K.F. Towfighi J. Hoppel C.L. Lusk M.M. Gondek C.M. Patel M.S. Pediatr. Res. 1987; 22: 312-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The last assay was performed in the presence and absence of K3Fe(CN)6 to study oxidative and nonoxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate, respectively. One milliunit of enzyme activity is defined as 1 nmol of substrate used or product formed per min at 37°C. Km values for TPP and pyruvic acid were determined by the reconstitution assay and assay with DCPIP by varying the concentration of TPP from 0.05 to 200 μM and the pyruvic acid concentration from 1 to 300 μM. Linear parts of the time curves were used for determination of kinetic parameters using double recipropcal plots.Phosphorylation and Dephosphorylation of Recombinant ProteinsPhosphorylation of wild-type and mutant E1s was performed as described previously(21Rahmatullah M. Jilka J.M. Radke G.A. Roche T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6515-6523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To measure activity changes, nonradioactive ATP was used during incubation and aliquots were withdrawn at specified times from the reaction mixture to a 1-ml cuvette to measure activity using the reconstitution assay. To determine incorporation of 32P from [γ-32P]ATP into protein, E2-X-kinase subcomplex was first incubated with nonradioactive ATP (5-150 μM) for 5 min (to exclude phosphorylation of a trace amount of E1 bound to E2), followed by the addition of [γ-32P]ATP (5-150 μM, 1.25-13.0 μCi) and recombinant E1 or E1 mutants. In the experiments with purified recombinant E1-kinase, preincubation was excluded and reaction was started by the addition of [γ-32P]ATP (20-200 μM) (12.5 μCi). The aliquots taken at different time intervals were applied to dry paper discs presoaked in trichloroacetic acid and the samples were processed as described previously(21Rahmatullah M. Jilka J.M. Radke G.A. Roche T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6515-6523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 32P incorporation was determined by scintillation counting (21Rahmatullah M. Jilka J.M. Radke G.A. Roche T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6515-6523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and expressed as mole of 32P incorporated per mole of tetrameric E1. The rates of incorporation (mol 32P/mol E1·min) were determined from the initial slopes of the time courses of 32P incorporation. kapp of inactivation (min−1) were calculated from the semilog plots of inactivation during phosphorylation. To demonstrate the incorporation of radioactivity in the α subunit, E1 proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and dry gels were autoradiographed.To study dephosphorylation, recombinant E1 proteins were phosphorylated by the E2-X-kinase from bovine kidney in the presence of 50-200 μM [γ-32P]ATP for 45-100 min, and the phosphorylation was stopped by the addition of 8 mM glucose and 0.5 units of hexokinase to scavenge ATP. To study 32Pi release E1s were extensively washed on Microcon filters to remove labeled glucose 6-phosphate. This step was excluded during reactivation experiments as it gave the same results. Dephosphorylation was performed in the presence of 10 mM MgCl2, 100 μM CaCl2, and 1 μg of phospho-E1-phosphatase per 10 μg of phosphorylated E1 at 30°C for up to 60 min. Aliquots taken at different time intervals were analyzed for both activity and 32P release in soluble fraction after protein precipitation with trichloroacetic acid. kapp of dephosphorylation and reactivation were calculated from semilog plots of the time courses of 32P release and increase of the specific activity.RESULTSActivity Determination of E1 MutantsTo examine the role of the three phosphorylation sites, seven different mutants were made by site-directed mutagenesis. Ser-264, Ser-271, Ser-203, corresponding to phosphorylation sites 1, 2, and 3 in the E1α sequence, were changed to alanine, either individually or in combination as: MS1 (E1 with mutated site 1), MS2, MS3, MS2,3, MS1,3, MS1,2, and MS1,2,3. Wild-type E1 and E1 mutants were individually overexpressed in E. coli and purified using Ni-nitrilotriacetic-agarose chromatography as described previously(5Korotchkina L.G. Tucker M.M. Thekkumkara T.J. Madhusudhan K.T. Pons G. Kim H. Patel M.S. Protein Express. Purif. 1995; 6: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Approximately 10 mg of each enzyme were obtained from 4 liters of bacterial culture with a purity of about 94% based on densitometry of the SDS-PAGE gel.The activities of these enzymes were measured using three different assays: (i) a reconstitution assay, (ii) a DCPIP assay, and (iii) a 14CO2 assay in the presence and absence of K3FeCN6 as an electron acceptor. The results of the reconstitution assays are shown in Fig. 2. Similar results were observed using the other two assays (results not shown). Each mutant exhibited activity in all three assays. There was little decrease in the specific activity of the E1 phosphorylation sites 2 and/or 3 mutants, but the E1 specific activity was reduced by 50-70% (relative to wild-type E1) for all mutants having an alteration at site 1.Figure 2:Activity of the E1 mutants determined by the reconstitution assay.

In each site 1 mutant (MS1, MS1,3, MS1,2, and MS1,2,3) a substantial increase in Km values for both pyruvate and TPP was observed which is not seen in site 2 or 3 mutants (E1, MS2, MS3, and MS2,3).Table IKm values for pyruvate and TPP for E1 and phosphorylation site mutantsTable IKm values for pyruvate and TPP for E1 and phosphorylation site mutantsPhosphorylation of E1 Mutants by the E1 Kinase in the Presence of E2Fig. 3 shows the time dependent inactivation of the wild-type and mutant E1s during incubation with ATP and the E2-X-kinase subcomplex (see “Experimental Procedures”). Based on the results, the E1s can be divided into 4 groups: Group 1, having site 1 intact (wild-type E1, MS2, MS3, and MS2, 3); Group 2, with mutation of site 1, but intact site 2 (MS1 and MS1, 3); Group 3, with mutation of sites 1 and 2, but site 3 intact (MS1, 2); Group 4, with mutations of all three phosphorylation sites (MS1, 2, 3). Native E1, MS2, MS3, and MS2,3 (Group 1) behaved similarly to one another during inactivation at ATP concentrations of 1-10 μM (Fig. 3A). Complete inactivation was achieved after 10 min with 10 μM ATP. However, the inactivation of the MS1 and MS1,3 (Group 2) was complete only after 30 min incubation with 40 μM ATP (Fig. 3B), and the MS1,2 (Group 3) needed higher ATP concentrations, up to 400 μM, and more than 60 min for complete inactivation (Fig. 3C). Thus, all E1s were inactivated by E2-X-kinase-dependent phosphorylation. However, the range of ATP concentration necessary for complete inactivation depended upon the mutant used, reflecting site-specificity. Mutants of Groups 2 and 3 achieved inactivation by phosphorylation at higher ATP concentration than mutants of Group 1.Figure 3:Time course of E1 inactivation during phosphorylation by the E2-X-kinase subcomplex. A, inactivation of Group 1 enzymes; B, inactivation of Group 2 enzymes; and C, inactivation of Group 3 enzyme. Ten μg of each E1 were incubated at 30°C with 8 μg of the E2-X-kinase and various ATP concentrations: 0 μM (∗); 1.0 μM (□); 1.6 μM (■); 2.5 μM (○); 4.0 μM (⨁); 10 μM (⬗); 25 μM (●); 40 μM (∆); 100 μM (◪); and 400 μM (▲). Aliquots (1 μg of E1) were taken to measure activity by the reconstitution assay.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To compare the regulatory behavior of different mutants the inactivation and the corresponding incorporation of 32P were determined at a fixed ATP concentration (40 μM) (Fig. 4). The level of incorporation (Fig. 4B) depended upon the number of sites available and duration of incubation. E1 with all the three potential phosphorylation sites available showed the maximum level of incorporation (2.7 mol of 32P/mol of E1); MS3, MS2, and MS1 with only 2 sites available showed less phosphorylation (1.1-1.7 mol of 32P/mol of E1) and minimum incorporation (0.4-0.6 mol of 32P/mol of E1) corresponded to phosphorylation of individual sites 1 (MS2,3), 2 (MS1,3), and 3 (MS1,2). The maximal level of incorporation achieved at 270 μM ATP was: 3.0 for E1; 1.5-1.8 for mutants with two sites; and 0.5-1.0 for mutants with only one phosphorylation site available (results not shown). There was no incorporation of 32P into the MS1,2,3 mutant and as expected there was no inactivation of this enzyme (Fig. 4). For this reason MS1,2,3 was used as a control in all the experiments concerning phosphorylation. Data presented in Fig. 4(B and C) showed that all three phosphorylation sites can incorporate 32P during incubation with the E2-X-kinase subcomplex and [γ-32P]ATP.Figure 4:A, inactivation of E1s during phosphorylation by the E2-X-kinase subcomplex in the presence of 40 μM ATP. Activity was measured in the reconstitution assay. 100% activity of each curve corresponded to the activity of each E1 at zero time. B, 32P incorporation from [γ-32P]ATP (40 μM) into E1s by the E2-X-kinase subcomplex. Ten μg of the E1 and 8 μg of the E2-X-kinase were used in each reaction. Incorporation was measured by counting paper discs in a scintillation counter. Phosphorylation in control tubes containing only the E2-X-kinase (without E1) was subtracted. C, autoradiography of the E1 after incorporation of γ-32P followed by separation of proteins in SDS-PAGE.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The difference in the rate of inactivation of E1 during incubation at a fixed ATP concentration (40 μM) is depicted in Fig. 4A by comparing inactivation of the enzymes in Groups 1, 2, and 3. Group 1 (wild-type E1, MS2, MS3, and MS2,3) represents phosphorylation mostly of site 1 in the presence or absence of sites 2 and 3; Group 2 (MS1 and MS1,3) represents phosphorylation of site 2 in the absence or presence of site 3, and Group 3 (MS1,2) shows phosphorylation of site 3 only. The inactivation of the enzymes of Group 1 was complete after 10 min incubation, Group 2 was inactivated in 30 min, while Group 3 having only site 3 required more than 100 min for complete inactivation. Results presented in Fig. 4 showed that phosphorylation with concomitant inactivation of the enzymes was found for each of the three sites, but the rates of these processes were different for each site.The initial rates of phosphorylation and inactivation of wild-type E1 and the mutant E1s are compared in Table II. The rates were similar for all species having site 1 (Group 1). Group 2 (without site 1 but with site 2 available) showed slower rates of phosphorylation and inactivation than Group 1. The lowest rates of phosphorylation and inactivation were found for Group 3 with only site 3 available.Table IIRates of phosphorylation and inactivation of E1 and its mutants by the E2-X-kinase subcomplex or by the E1-kinase alone and of dephosphorylation and reactivation by the phospho-E1-phosphataseTable IIRates of phosphorylation and inactivation of E1 and its mutants by the E2-X-kinase subcomplex or by the E1-kinase alone and of dephosphorylation and reactivation by the phospho-E1-phosphatasePhosphorylation of E1 Mutants by the E1 Kinase in the Absence of E2Fig. 5 shows the incorporation of 32P and inactivation of wild-type E1 and E1 mutants during incubation with E1-kinase and ATP. To achieve phosphorylation of E1 by the E1-kinase in the absence of E2 it was necessary to increase the concentrations of both the E1-kinase and ATP. Complete inactivation of wild-type E1 occurred after 15 min incubation in the presence of 200 μM ATP. Mutants MS3, MS2, MS2,3 were phosphorylated with concomitant inactivation similar to wild-type E1 indicating that site 1 can be phosphorylated in the absence of E2. However, mutants having only site 2 (MS1,3), site 3 (MS1,2), or sites 2 and 3 (MS1) exhibited low levels of phosphorylation (10-15% of that for wild-type E1 and mutants with site 1), and low levels of inactivation (approximately 10% of that for wild-type E1 and mutants with site 1). Autoradiography (Fig. 5C) showed a low level of phosphate incorporation into sites 2 and 3, when only the E1-kinase was present, and this was much less than phosphorylation of the E1s by the E2-X-kinase subcomplex (Fig. 4C).Figure 5:A, inactivation of E1s by phosphorylation by the E1-kinase in the presence of 200 μM ATP. Activity was measured in the reconstitution assay. 100% activity for each curve corresponded to the activity of each E1 at zero time. B, 32P incorporation from [γ-32P]ATP (200 μM) into E1s by the E1-kinase. Seven μg of the E1 and 2 μg of the E1-kinase were used in each reaction. Incorporation of 32P was measured by scintillation counting of paper discs. Phosphorylation in control tubes containing only the E1-kinase (without E1) was subtracted. C, autoradiography of E1 after incorporation of γ-32P followed by separation of proteins in SDS-PAGE. Upper band represents autophosphorylation of the E1-kinase, and the lower band represents 32P incorporation into E1α subunit.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table II shows the initial rates of incorporation of 32P and inactivation during phosphorylation of E1s by the E1-kinase. The difference between the rates of inactivation and phosphorylation for sites 2 and 3 compared to that of site 1 was much larger during phosphorylation by the E1-kinase alone than during phosphorylation by the E1-kinase in the presence of E2. The corresponding kapp of inactivation (and rates of phosphorylation) were: in the absence of E2 for site 1, 0.347 min−1 (0.125 mol of 32P/mol of E1); for site 2, 0.002 min−1 (0.005 mol of 32P/mol of E1); for site 3, 0.003 min−1 (0.007 mol of 32P/mol of E1); and in the presence of E2 for site 1, 0.732 min−1 (0.241 mol of 32P/mol of E1); for site 2, 0.096 min−1 (0.053 mol of 32P/mol of E1); and for site 3, 0.022 min−1 (0.015 mol of 32P/mol of E1).Dephosphorylation of E1 Mutants by the Phospho-E1-phosphataseFig. 6 shows the reactivation of the phosphorylated wild-type and mutant E1s during dephosphorylation by the phospho-E1-phosphatase. All E1s with sites 1, 2, and 3 present either individually or in combination with the other sites were dephosphorylated by the phospho-E1-phosphatase (Fig. 6B) with similar rates of Pi release as reflected in. The calculated rates of dephosphorylation for sites 1, 2, and 3 were: 0.111 min−1, 0.104 min−1, and 0.102 min−1, respectively. Dephosphorylation resulted in complete reactivation of all the mutant enzymes (Fig. 6A). The rates of reactivation were similar for the E1 proteins with only site 1 (MS2,3), site 2 (MS1,3), or site 3 (MS1,2) (Fig. 6A, inset; also see). The reactivation was slower for the mutants with two phosphorylation sites (MS1, MS2, MS3) than the mutants with only one site (MS2,3, MS1,3, MS1,2), and the reactivation was slowest for E1 with three potential phosphorylation sites than for the mutants with two sites (). The reactivation curves for the mutants with two sites and especially for wild-type E1 were sigmoidal, and longer incubation times were necessary to achieve complete reactivation. The different behavior of the mutants with different number of phosphorylation sites can be explained by the fact that activity depends upon dephosphorylation of all of the available sites.Figure 6:A, reactivation of E1s during dephosphorylation by the phospho-E1-phosphatase. Activity was measured in the reconstitution assay. Inset shows the semilog plots of reactivation of MS2,3, MS1,3, and MS1,2 by the phospho-E1-phosphatase. Ao, inactivation (%) at zero time; At, inactivation (%) at time intervals indicated. This is a representative experiment of the results presented as the means ± S.E. (n = 4) shown in Table II. B, 32P release from phosphorylated E1s by the phospho-E1- phosphatase. E1 proteins were phosphorylated by the E2-X-kinase in the presence of 50 μM [γ-32P]ATP for 45 min. Ten μg of the phosho-E1 and 1 μg of the phospho-E1-phosphatase were used in each dephosphorylation reaction. 32P release was determined by taking aliquots at different time intervals, protein precipitation with trichloroacetic acid, and measuring the radioactivity by counting the soluble fraction in a scintillation counter. The level of radioactivity released with acid treatment at zero time (before the phospho-E1-phosphatase addition) was subtracted from each point.

B., Levin, G., Dascal, N., and Lotan, I.(1994) Biochemistry 33, 8786-8792). In this study, we show, by two-electrode voltage clamp analysis, that whereas treatments for a short time with various cAMP analogs do not affect the channel function, prolonged treatment with 8-bromoadenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphorothioate ((Sp)-8-Br-cAMPS), a membrane-permeant cAMP analog, enhances the current amplitude. It also enhances the current amplitude through a mutant channel that cannot be phosphorylated by protein kinase A activation. The enhancement is inhibited in the presence of (Rp)-8-Br-cAMPS, a membrane-permeant protein kinase A inhibitor. Concomitant SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis reveals that this treatment not only brings about phosphorylation of the wild-type channel, but also increases the amounts of both wild-type and mutant channel proteins; the latter effect can be inhibited by cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor. In the presence of cycloheximide, the (Sp)-8-Br-cAMPS treatment enhances only the wild-type current amplitudes and induces accumulation of wild-type channels in the plasma membrane of the oocyte. In summary, prolonged treatment with (Sp)-8-Br-cAMPS regulates RCK1 function via two pathways, a pathway leading to enhanced channel synthesis and a pathway involving channel phosphorylation that directs channels to the plasma membrane.

The L6 protein, however, did not inhibit the LPS-mediated activation of a limulus serine protease zymogen factor C. L6 had an affinity to the matrix of Sepharose CL-6B itself, and it could be eluted with high concentrations of monosaccharides (0.5-1.0 M), such as glucose, mannose, and galactose, suggesting a lectin-like nature. The entire amino acid sequence of L6 was determined by sequencing peptides derived from CNBr and enzymatic cleavages. L6 contained 7 half-cystines, and 1 cysteine residue at position 201 had a free SH-group. In addition, positions of the remaining three intrachain disulfide bonds were assigned by amino acid and sequence analyses of three cystinyl peptides produced by lysyl endopeptidase digestion. These results indicated that the entire sequence of L6 consisted of 221 residues with no N-linked sugar and was composed of six tandem repeats, each consisting of 33-38 amino acid residues. Inductively coupled plasma spectrometry of L6 indicated the presence of 0.75 mol zinc/mol of protein. No significant sequence homology was observed between L6 and other proteins, including various animal lectins and LPS-binding proteins. However, L6 showed agglutinating activity on LPS-coated sheep erythrocytes and Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, it inhibited the growth of Gram-negative bacteria, and thus it presumably recognizes carbohydrate components in the cell wall of bacteria.

To investigate further the mechanism of isoform specificity of human TRs (TRα1 and TRβ1), we have examined their functional effects on positive thyroid hormone response elements (TREs) both in the presence and absence of ligand. TRα1 was greater than 2-fold more potent than TRβ1 on both TREs studied, in terms of both ligand-independent repression and ligand-dependent stimulation. By creating a number of chimeric and mutant receptors, we have established that the increased functional potency of TRα1 is due to its unique amino terminus. Deletion or substitution of the TRα1 amino terminus leads to a loss of both its ligand-independent and -dependent functions on positive TREs. Furthermore, the TRα1 amino terminus antagonizes homodimer formation on the positive TREs studied. TR constructs, which contain the TRα1 amino terminus, are unable to form homodimers and form exclusively heterodimers with RXRα on direct repeat and palindromic TREs. Deletion of the amino terminus from either TR isoform leads to preferential homodimer formation, which suggests that the TR amino terminus is important for relative heterodimerization capability. From these data, we conclude that TRα1 isoform specificity on positive TREs resides predominantly in its amino terminus through its ability to favor heterodimerization with the retinoid X receptor or other nuclear proteins.

In vitro, purified Gβγ subunits specifically bound to a GST fusion protein encoding amino acids 1-330 of Raf-1 (Raf/330). Binding assays with truncation mutants of GST-Raf indicate that the region located between amino acids 136 and 239 is a primary determinant for interaction with Gβγ.

Characterization of this mutant expressed in Sf9 insect cells demonstrate that the mutant protein is not able to form a stable, soluble complex with PDI, indicating that the carboxyl-terminal 30 amino acids of the MTP 97-kDa subunit are required for the formation of a normal MTP complex. In addition to the implications regarding PDI-97-kDa subunit interactions, these findings also have important implications for future studies of structure-activity relationships in the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein.MATERIALS AND METHODSIsolation and Characterization of Genomic ClonesGenomic DNA was isolated from the blood of a 52-year-old male abetalipoproteinemic patient.

The sequence for exon 4 was obtained following a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of genomic DNA corresponding to exon 4 and subcloning of the PCR product into pUC18.Analytical Digest Analysis of Mutant DNAGenomic DNA was prepared from blood from a control subject and from the abetalipoproteinemic subject. A 343-bp genomic fragment surrounding bp 2593 of the cDNA (corresponding to bp 111 5′ of the intron-exon junction for exon 18 through bp 2745 of the cDNA) was amplified by PCR from the genomic DNA of the abetalipoproteinemic and normal control subject. Forward (5′-CTCAGATTGCTTTGGAAC-3′) and reverse (5′-TCATGCCACATTGTGTCC-3′) primers were designed based on sequence obtained from human genomic clones(13Sharp D. Ricci B. Kienzle B. Lin M.C.M. Wetterau J.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9057-9061Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Equal aliquots of the PCR reaction products were removed from both samples, and half of each aliquot was digested with NlaIII. Digested and undigested DNA from each subject was loaded into separate wells, electrophoresed through a 1.4% agarose gel, and visualized by ethidium bromide staining.Construction of the Baculovirus Transfer Vectors, pVL-MTP894, pVL-MTP864, and pVL-PDIThe baculovirus transfer vector pVL-MTP894, encoding the 97-kDa large subunit, was generated by PCR amplification of overlapping fragments of a human 97-kDa subunit cDNA described previously(3Sharp D. Blinderman L. Combs K.A. Kienzle B. Ricci B. Wager-Smith K. Gil C.M. Turck C.W. Bouma M.-E. Rader D.J. Aggerbeck L.P. Gregg R.E. Gordon D.A. Wetterau J.R. Nature. 1993; 365: 65-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The 5′ most primer contained a BamHI site followed by sequence −3 to +18 of the cDNA, and the 3′-most primer contained sequence +2667 to +2686 of the cDNA followed by an XhoI site. The overlapping PCR fragments were ligated, and the ligated product was subcloned into the BamHI-XhoI sites of the pBluescript vector. The cDNA sequence was verified by sequencing of this pBluescript subclone. The pBluescript subclone insert was cut at the 3′ end with XhoI. A fill-in reaction with T4 DNA polymerase (14Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Vol. 1. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1989: 3.5.11Google Scholar) was performed in the presence of 0.02 M nucleotides to create a blunt end at the XhoI site for ligation into the SmaI site of the baculovirus transfer vector. The subclone was then digested with BamHI to remove the full-length cDNA from pBluescript. The cDNA was subcloned into the BamHI-SmaI sites of the baculovirus transfer vector pVL1393 (Invitrogen Corp.) to produce a final cDNA containing 3 bp of the 5′-untranslated sequence, the entire coding region, and 7 bp of the 3′-untranslated sequence.The mutant 97-kDa subunit cDNA construct, pVL-MTP864, containing a G to T nucleotide change at bp 2593 of the cDNA, was prepared by PCR-directed mutagenesis (15Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2087) Google Scholar) of the normal cDNA and subcloned into pVL1393 as described above for pVL-MTP894.The baculovirus transfer vector, pVL-PDI, was constructed from a cDNA for PDI obtained by a reverse trancriptase reaction with mRNA from HepG2 cells, followed by PCR amplification of the reaction product utilizing primers designed from cDNA sequence published previously (11). SmaI restriction sites were incorporated into the primers used to amplify the 5′ and 3′ ends. Overlapping PCR products were ligated to produce the full-length cDNA. The product, containing 17 bp of the 5′-untranslated sequence, the whole coding region, and 29 bp of the 3′-untranslated sequence was subcloned into pUC18 by blunt end ligation into the SmaI site of the vector. The cDNA sequence was verified by direct sequencing of the PCR product and then excised from pUC18 with BamHI and EcoRI. The fragment was then ligated into the BamHI-EcoRI sites of pVL1393.Transfection and Isolation of Recombinant VirusesRecombinant baculovirus transfer vectors were co-transfected into Sf9 cells with wild-type Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus DNA by cationic liposome-mediated transfection. Methods for transfection; screening for recombinant viruses VL-MTP894, VL-MTP864, and VL-PDI; isolation of plaque purified viruses; and the production of large scale, high-titer stocks are described in the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen Corp.) supplied with the MaxBac kit, product K822-03.Expression of Recombinant Proteins in Sf9 CellsSf9 cells were cultured at 27°C in ExCell 401 serum-free media (JRH Biosciences) in suspension in Erlenmeyer or spinner flasks. Alternatively, they were cultured as monolayers in 60-mm dishes in 1 × TNM-FH media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). To produce recombinant proteins, Sf9 cells were seeded at a density of 2.0 × 106 cells/ml in suspension culture or 2.5 × 106 cells/60-mm dish. For expression studies, the cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 5 with recombinant viruses VL-MTP894 and VL-MTP864, or 50 for VL-PDI. The same multiplicity of infections were used for co-infections. Preliminary experiments were performed in suspension culture to optimize the expression with respect to time course, multiplicity of infection, and the ratio of viruses expressing PDI and MTP 97-kDa subunit.Analysis of Recombinant Proteins in Sf9 CellsThe cells were harvested 48 h after infection in 60-mm dishes, and aliquots of the soluble media and the total cell protein were taken for analysis of MTP protein as described below. The remaining cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and homogenized with a Polytron in 0.05 M Tris, pH 7.4, 0.05 M KCl, 0.005 M EDTA, 0.002 M phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mM leupeptin. One-half volume of 0.54% deoxycholate, pH 7.5, was added to the homogenate to release MTP from the microsomes. The suspension was incubated on ice for 30 min and centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g.Following centrifugation, the supernatant containing the soluble MTP was dialyzed against 0.015 M Tris, pH 7.4, 0.04 M NaCl, 0.001 M EDTA, 0.02% NaN3 and assayed for MTP activity by measuring the rate of radiolabeled triglyceride (TG) transfer from donor to acceptor egg phosphatidylcholine small unilamellar vesicles as a function of cell protein as described previously(4Wetterau J.R. Aggerbeck L.P. Bouma M.-E. Eisenberg C. Munck A. Hermier M. Schmitz J. Gay G. Rader D.J. Gregg R.E. Science. 1992; 258: 999-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Aliquots of total cell protein, the pellets from the 100,000 × g centrifugation, and the supernatant from the 100,000 × g centrifugation were solubilized in 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate, heated at 95°C for 5 min and fractionated by SDS, 8% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Samples were immunoblotted with rabbit anti-bovine 97 kDa or anti-bovine PDI antibodies as described previously(4Wetterau J.R. Aggerbeck L.P. Bouma M.-E. Eisenberg C. Munck A. Hermier M. Schmitz J. Gay G. Rader D.J. Gregg R.E. Science. 1992; 258: 999-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and a colorimetric reaction were used to detect immunoreactive proteins.RESULTSDNA from an abetalipoproteinemic subject was isolated and used to construct a genomic library. We had previously demonstrated that intestinal biopsies from this subject had no detectable MTP activity or protein. Genomic clones containing inserts encoding exons 1-3 and 5-18 of the gene for the 97-kDa subunit of MTP were isolated and characterized. Exon 4 cDNA was obtained by PCR amplification of the isolated DNA. The entire coding region, the intron-exon boundaries, and 250 bp upstream of the transcription start site were sequenced. Studies characterizing the MTP gene promoter have indicated that the first 250 bp upstream of the transcription start site direct the correct cell type specific expression of reporter genes(16Hagan D.L. Kienzle B. Jamil H. Hariharan N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28737-28744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The entire sequence agreed with that of the normal gene(13Sharp D. Ricci B. Kienzle B. Lin M.C.M. Wetterau J.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9057-9061Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), with the exception of a G to T mutation at a base corresponding to base 2593 downstream from the translational start site of the cDNA. This mutation changes the Gly865 codon in exon 18 of the gene to a stop codon. The predicted translation product is truncated by 30 amino acids. This mutation was found on three independent DNA inserts.The mutation at bp 2593 creates a new NlaIII restriction site in the DNA sequence. To further characterize the defect in this subject, a NlaIII digest was performed on a 343-bp PCR-amplified fragment of genomic DNA surrounding the mutation. As illustrated in Fig. 1, control DNA produced a single band indicating the absence of a NlaIII site in exon 18, while the DNA from the abetalipoproteinemic subject was digested completely into two fragments of 192 and 151 bp. This suggests that both copies of the MTP 97-kDa subunit gene of the abetalipoproteinemic subject contain the G to T mutation. However, the possibility of a deletion in exon 18 of one of the copies of the gene has not been formally excluded.To determine whether this nonsense mutation, which predicts a protein truncated by 30 amino acids, could explain the absence of MTP activity and protein in intestinal biopsies, PDI was co-expressed with either the normal or mutant 97-kDa subunit using a baculovirus expression system. Preliminary experiments in suspension culture were used to optimize the expression conditions. In control experiments, MTP activity was not measurable in those cells infected with viruses expressing the normal 97-kDa subunit or PDI alone (data not shown), demonstrating the requirement of both subunits for MTP activity. Recombinant viruses were then used to co-infect Sf9 cells in monolayer culture with either the normal 97-kDa subunit and PDI constructs or the mutant 97-kDa subunit and PDI constructs.Following a 48-h co-infection in 60-mm dishes, the cells were harvested, and aliquots of the media and total cells removed. The remaining cells were pelleted, washed, homogenized, treated with deoxycholate to ensure release of soluble MTP protein from the microsomal fraction, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Following dialysis, MTP activity in the 100,000 × g supernatant was assayed by measuring the rate of protein-stimulated transport of radiolabeled triglyceride from donor to acceptor small unilamellar vesicles. As shown in Fig. 2, MTP-catalyzed TG transfer was readily detected in the supernatant from cells co-infected with viruses expressing the normal 97-kDa subunit (VL-MTP894) and PDI (VL-PDI). No activity was measurable in supernatant from cells co-infected with viruses expressing the mutant 97-kDa subunit (VL-MTP864) and PDI, even at protein concentrations that yielded almost 30% transfer in the co-infection with the normal 97-kDa subunit.Figure 2:Baculovirus expression of the normal 97-kDa subunit-PDI complex and the mutant 97-kDa subunit-PDI complex. Sf9 cells were co-infected with either VL-MTP894 and VL-PDI or VL-MTP864 and VL-PDI as described under “Materials and Methods.” Protein from the 100,000 × g supernatant fraction following deoxycholate treatment of the cells was assayed for TG transfer activity. Activity is expressed as the percent of 14C-radiolabeled triglyceride transferred from donor vesicles to acceptor vesicles in a 1-h assay as a function of protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To investigate why MTP activity was not detected in Sf9 cells co-infected with viruses expressing the mutant 97-kDa subunit and PDI, aliquots representing 2.5% of either the soluble media protein, total cell protein, 100,000 × g supernatant, or 100,000 × g cell pellet protein were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted with anti-97 kDa or anti-PDI antibodies (Fig. 3 and 4). Analysis of total cell protein revealed similar levels of expression of the large subunit from cells co-infected with viruses expressing either the normal or mutant 97-kDa subunits and PDI (Fig. 3A, lanes2 and 4, respectively). Higher levels of expression of the 97-kDa subunit were observed in cells infected with viruses expressing the normal subunit alone (Fig. 3A, lane1). This was likely a result of increased efficiency by the cells for production of a single heterologous protein. As expected, the mutant 97-kDa subunit ran slightly below that of the normal, indicating expression of a truncated protein.Figure 3:Immunoblot analysis of MTP expressed in Sf9 cells. Aliquots of the total cell protein, the 100,000 × g pellet, and 100,000 × g supernatant (which contains soluble MTP released from the microsomal fraction after treatment of homogenized Sf9 cells with deoxycholate) were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted with rabbit antibodies to the 97-kDa subunit of MTP. In all panels, lane1 contains protein from Sf9 cells infected with the VL-MTP894 construct alone, lane2 contains protein from Sf9 cells co-infected with VL-MTP894+VL-PDI, lane3 contains protein from Sf9 cells infected with the VL-PDI construct alone, and lane4 contains protein from Sf9 cells co-infected with the mutant MTP construct, VL-MTP864+VL-PDI.

The relative positions of molecular mass standards (in kDa) are shown to the right of the figure.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In the 100,000 × g supernatant, normal soluble 97-kDa subunit protein was present at high levels from cells co-infected with this construct and PDI (Fig. 3B, lane2). In contrast, the mutant subunit was not detected in the soluble fraction from cells co-infected with viruses expressing the mutant construct and PDI (Fig. 3B, lane4), nor was the normal subunit detected in cells infected with viruses expressing the normal construct alone (Fig. 3B, lane1). In the 100,000 × g cell pellet, representing protein from the nonsoluble cellular fraction, the 97-kDa subunit was present in both the cells infected with viruses expressing the normal 97-kDa subunit only and in the cells co-infected with viruses expressing the mutant 97-kDa subunit and PDI (Fig. 3C, lanes1 and 4, respectively). However, the 97-kDa subunit was negligible in the pellet from cells co-infected with viruses expressing the normal 97-kDa subunit and PDI (Fig. 3C, lane2). The nonsoluble 97-kDa subunit found in the 100,000 × g pellet from cells infected with normal 97 kDa or co-infected with PDI and mutant 97 kDa (Fig. 3C, lanes1 and 4, respectively) appears to represent all of the 97 kDa produced by the cells (see Fig. 3A, lanes1 and 4). Immunoblots with anti-PDI antibody demonstrated similar levels of expression of PDI in both the total cell protein (data not shown) and the 100,000 × g supernatant from both normal and mutant co-infections (Fig. 4, lanes2 and 4, respectively).Figure 4:Immunoblot analysis of PDI expressed in Sf9 cells. Aliquots of 100,000 × g supernatant protein were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted with rabbit antibodies to PDI. Lanes1-4 contain protein from Sf9 cells infected as described for Fig. 3. The relative positions of molecular mass standards (in kDa) are shown to the right of the figure.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The complete absence of the mutant 97-kDa subunit in the supernatant from cells co-infected with viruses for this construct and PDI and its presence in the 100,000 × g pellet suggests that despite the availability of both subunits for complex formation, the expressed mutant MTP large subunit does not form a complex with PDI. As a result, it aggregates within the endoplasmic reticulum and cannot be released in a soluble form utilizing the deoxycholate method effective for the normal protein. This result is identical to those observed in cells expressing the normal large subunit only, where PDI is unavailable for complex formation.As a control, immunoblot analysis of soluble protein present in the media was performed to exclude the possibility that a portion of the mutant 97-kDa subunit, which had not formed a complex with PDI, was secreted from the cells. The 97-kDa subunit was not present at detectable levels in the media from cells infected with viruses expressing either MTP subunit alone or from cells co-infected with viruses expressing the mutant large subunit and PDI. A minor amount of soluble 97-kDa protein was present in the media from cells co-infected with viruses expressing the normal 97-kDa subunit and PDI (data not shown), suggesting that normal retention mechanisms of the endoplasmic reticulum were not able to retain the high levels of expressed protein.DISCUSSIONAnalysis of naturally occurring mutations has been a productive approach for identifying important structure-function relationships in proteins. MTP mutations associated with abetalipoproteinemia reported to date (3Sharp D. Blinderman L. Combs K.A. Kienzle B. Ricci B. Wager-Smith K. Gil C.M. Turck C.W. Bouma M.-E. Rader D.J. Aggerbeck L.P.

Narcisi T.M.E. Leiper J.M. Chester S.A. Bayliss J.D. Reid J. Scott J. Circulation. 1994; 90: I-186PubMed Google Scholar) all predict severe abnormalities in the 97-kDa subunit of MTP and thus do little to elucidate the structure-function relationships in MTP. Here we report the identification of a nonsense mutation in the 97-kDa subunit of an abetalipoproteinemic subject which predicts an MTP large subunit truncated by only 30 amino acids. Previously, it has been demonstrated that this subject lacks MTP activity and that the 97-kDa subunit is undetectable in either a soluble or total cell protein fraction from an intestinal biopsy obtained from this subject(4Wetterau J.R. Aggerbeck L.P. Bouma M.-E. Eisenberg C. Munck A. Hermier M. Schmitz J. Gay G. Rader D.J. Gregg R.E. Science. 1992; 258: 999-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Whether this apparently subtle change in MTP could explain the absence of MTP protein in this subject is not obvious.To investigate if the nonsense mutation could result in a complete absence of MTP in intestinal biopsies from the abetalipoproteinemic subject, PDI was co-expressed with either the normal MTP 97-kDa subunit or the mutant subunit in Sf9 insect cells using a baculovirus expression system. Sf9 cells have endogenous PDI activity(17Vuori K. Pihlajaniemi T. Myllylä R. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4213-4217Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), however the protein that expresses this activity did not form an active transfer protein complex when the cells were infected with the 97-kDa subunit only. Although the anti-bovine PDI antibody used to detect PDI by immunoblot analysis in this study cross-reacts with mouse and human PDI, there was no detectable signal from Sf9 cells not infected with heterologous PDI (Fig. 4, lane1). This suggests that there is not a high degree of homology between mammalian and the insect cell proteins that express PDI activity. Thus MTP expression in Sf9 cells is dependent on co-expression of the MTP large subunit and PDI.High levels of PDI and the MTP 97-kDa subunit (mutant or normal) were expressed following co-infections. When the activity and MTP protein in a soluble protein extract from the Sf9 cells were compared, MTP activity and 97-kDa subunit were detected in the soluble fraction obtained from cells expressing the normal protein, but neither was detected in the soluble fraction from the cells expressing the mutant, although clearly both MTP subunits were available to form a complex. These results suggest that the mutant protein was unable to form a normal complex with PDI.The absence of detectable MTP 97-kDa subunit in intestinal biopsies from the abetalipoproteinemic subject most likely is a result of degradation of the mutant MTP 97-kDa subunit, which is unable to form a complex with PDI. Proteins that are folded incorrectly, or subunits of an oligomeric protein that are not properly assembled into a protein complex, are diverted to a degradation pathway(18Klausner R.D. Sitia R. Cell. 1990; 62: 611-614Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Malfolded or unassembled proteins often form transient soluble complexes with a chaperone protein prior to degradation(19Gething M.-J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3575) Google Scholar). Using the baculovirus expression system, the high levels of expression may have exceeded the capacity of the Sf9 cells to either degrade the MTP 97-kDa subunit or to form a soluble complex between it and a chaperone protein. Previous biochemical analysis of MTP has indicated that the 97-kDa subunit of MTP forms an insoluble aggregate unless it is associated with PDI(20Wetterau J.R. Combs K.A. McLean L.R. Spinner S.N. Aggerbeck L.P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9728-9735Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Thus, finding the mutant subunit in an insoluble form in the total cell extract, but not in a soluble protein extract, is expected when the mutant protein is unable to form a complex with PDI.The possibility that the mutant subunit forms a complex with PDI which is subsequently rapidly degraded and thus not detected, cannot be fully excluded. However, the similar levels of normal and mutant large subunits following co-expression with PDI, the absence of detectable mutant 97-kDa subunit degradation products by immunoblot analysis, the apparent recovery of all of the mutant large subunit protein in the 100,000 × g cell pellet, and the known insoluble nature of the MTP 97-kDa subunit (20Wetterau J.R. Combs K.A. McLean L.R. Spinner S.N. Aggerbeck L.P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9728-9735Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) provides strong support that the defect is in the formation of the MTP complex. These findings indicate that the carboxyl terminus of the 97-kDa subunit plays an important role in its interaction with PDI and that a fully translated 97-kDa subunit may be required for normal complex formation.These findings predict that mutations in the PDI subunit of MTP which affect its ability to form a complex with the 97-kDa subunit, would also cause abetalipoproteinemia. Although 11 different defective 97-kDa alleles have been reported for abetalipoproteinemic subjects(3Sharp D. Blinderman L. Combs K.A. Kienzle B. Ricci B. Wager-Smith K. Gil C.M. Turck C.W.

Circulation. 1994; 90: I-186PubMed Google Scholar), a mutation in PDI that causes abetalipoproteinemia has not been described to date. This indicates that the region of PDI that interacts with the 97-kDa subunit of MTP may have a critical function independent of its role in MTP.The results of this study have important implications regarding future structure-function analysis of MTP. Carboxyl-terminal deletion analysis is a common approach to investigate the functional role of various regions of a protein. However, this study demonstrates that deletions as short as 30 amino acids at the carboxyl terminus of the large subunit interrupt its interaction with PDI and that a fully translated 97-kDa subunit may be required for complex formation. Alternative strategies, which utilize assembled protein, will be required to elucidate the functional roles of the carboxyl-terminal portions of the MTP large subunit.

Studies of MTP in subjects with abetalipoproteinemia, a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized as a defect in the assembly of plasma lipoproteins that contain apolipoprotein B (apoB), indicated that an absence of MTP function is a cause of abetalipoproteinemia(3Sharp D.

These findings demonstrated that MTP is required for the assembly of very low density lipoproteins in the liver and chylomicrons in the intestine. Co-expression of MTP and truncated forms of apoB in cell lines which normally do not secrete apoB-containing lipoprotein particles (HeLa and COS cells), further demonstrated that MTP expression is sufficient to allow nonhepatic, nonintestinal cell lines to efficiently synthesize and secrete apoB particles with densities similar to those secreted from hepatic-derived cell lines(7Gordon D.A.

However, the structural features of the two components of MTP which are important for the formation of the protein complex, MTP-membrane interaction, and the lipid molecule binding properties of MTP, are not known.Here, the identification of a nonsense mutation in the 97-kDa subunit of MTP from a subject with abetalipoproteinemia is reported. It has previously been shown that intestinal biopsies from this subject lack MTP activity and protein(4Wetterau J.R. Aggerbeck L.P. Bouma M.-E. Eisenberg C. Munck A. Hermier M. Schmitz J. Gay G.

Characterization of this mutant expressed in Sf9 insect cells demonstrate that the mutant protein is not able to form a stable, soluble complex with PDI, indicating that the carboxyl-terminal 30 amino acids of the MTP 97-kDa subunit are required for the formation of a normal MTP complex. In addition to the implications regarding PDI-97-kDa subunit interactions, these findings also have important implications for future studies of structure-activity relationships in the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein."

After GTP hydrolysis EF-Tu is released in its GDP-bound state. In vivo, EF-Tu is post-translationally modified by phosphorylation. Here we report that the phosphorylation of EF-Tu by a ribosome associated kinase activity is drastically enhanced by EF-Ts. The antibiotic kirromycin, known to block EF-Tu function, inhibits the modification. This effect is specific, since kirromycin-resistant mutants do become phosphorylated in the presence of the antibiotic. On the other hand, phosphorylated wild-type EF-Tu does not bind kirromycin. Most interestingly, the phosphorylation of EF-Tu abolishes its ability to bind aa-tRNA. In the GTP conformation the site of modification is located at the interface between domains 1 and 3 and is involved in a strong interdomain hydrogen bond. Introduction of a charged phosphate group at this position will change the interaction between the domains, leading to an opening of the molecule reminiscent of the GDP conformation.

S.(1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 17864-17871). These isoforms, which appear to be generated by alternative splicing of pre-mRNA, differ from the MHC-B isoform present in a large number of nonmuscle cells in that they contain inserted cassettes of amino acids near the ATP binding region and/or near the actin binding region. The insert near the ATP binding region begins after amino acid 211 and consists of either 10 or 16 amino acids. The insert near the actin binding region begins after amino acid 621 and consists of 21 amino acids. Using a variety of techniques, we have studied the distribution and expression of the inserted MHC-B isoforms. In the developing chicken brain, mRNA encoding the 10-amino acid insert gradually increases after embryonic day 4, peaks in the 10-14-day embryo, and then declines. In contrast, the mRNA encoding the 21-amino acid insert appears just before birth and is abundantly expressed in the adult chicken cerebellum.There is a marked species difference between the distribution of the inserted isoforms in adult tissues. The mRNA encoding MHC-B containing the 10-amino acid insert near the ATP binding region is expressed at low levels in the adult chicken brain, but makes up most of the MHC-B mRNA expressed in the human cerebrum and approximately 90% of MHC-B in the human retina. It is also expressed in neuronal cell lines. The mRNA encoding MHC-B containing the 21-amino acid insert is abundantly expressed in the chicken cerebellum and human cerebrum, but is absent from the retina and cell lines. Employing human retinoblastoma (Y-79) and neuroblastoma (SK-N-SH) cell lines, an increase in expression of mRNA encoding the 10-amino acid inserted isoform was seen following treatment by a number of agonists or by serum deprivation. In each case, expression of the inserted MHC-B isoform correlated with cell differentiation (neuronal phenotype) and inhibition of cell division. Using a rat pheochromocytoma cell line (PC12), we found that prior to treatment with nerve growth factor (NGF), there was no evidence for either inserted isoform, although noninserted MHC-B was present. NGF treatment resulted in the appearance of mRNA encoding MHC-B containing the 10-amino acid insert, concomitant with neurite outgrowth. Both the inserted isoform and neurites disappeared following withdrawal of NGF, showing that the appearance and disappearance of the neurites is coupled to the inclusion and exclusion of this MHC-B insert.

https://openalex.org/W2010201306,"Heterotrimeric G-proteins mediate between receptors and effectors, acting as molecular clocks. G-protein interactions with activated receptors catalyze the replacement of GDP bound to the α-subunit with GTP. α-Subunits then modulate the activity of downstream effectors until the bound GTP is hydrolyzed. In several signal transduction pathways, including the cGMP cascade of photoreceptor cells, the relatively slow GTPase activity of heterotrimeric G-proteins can be significantly accelerated when they are complexed with corresponding effectors. In the phototransduction cascade the GTPase activity of photoreceptor G-protein, transducin, is substantially accelerated in a complex with its effector, cGMP phosphodiesterase. Here we characterize the stimulation of transducin GTPase by a set of 23 mutant phosphodiesterase γ-subunits (PDEγ) containing single alanine substitutions within a stretch of the 25 C-terminal amino acid residues known to be primarily responsible for the GTPase regulation. The substitution of tryptophan at position 70 completely abolished the acceleration of GTP hydrolysis by transducin in a complex with this mutant. This mutation also resulted in a reduction of PDEγ affinity for transducin, but did not affect PDEγ interactions with the phosphodiesterase catalytic subunits. Single substitutions of 7 other hydrophobic amino acids resulted in a 50-70% reduction in the ability of PDEγ to stimulate transducin GTPase, while substitutions of charged and polar amino acids had little or no effect. These observations suggest that the role of PDEγ in activation of the transducin GTPase rate may be based on multiple hydrophobic interactions between these molecules.

Our previous study with synthetic peptides corresponding to different segments of PDEγ has shown that the epitope responsible for transducin GTPase activation is located within a stretch of 25 C-terminal amino acid residues of PDEγ (Arshavsky et al., 1994Arshavsky V.Y.

Here we report the identification of amino acid residues in this region that are directly involved in the GTPase regulation. We have found that the alanine substitution of Trp70 results in a complete abolishment of the GTPase activation and seven other substitutions of hydrophobic residues result in the reduction of the GTPase stimulation by 50-70%. These data indicate that the transducin GTPase activation by an effector may be a result of hydrophobic interaction between relatively long stretches of these proteins.

Briefly, ROS were bleached on ice to achieve tight binding of transducin with rhodopsin and homogenized in a glass-to-glass homogenizer. The membranes were washed once by an isotonic buffer containing 100 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and three times by a hypotonic buffer containing 5 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5 mM EDTA, and 1 mM dithiothreitol. Analysis of these membranes by SDS-gel electrophoresis shows that they retain >80% of their transducin and are depleted of >98% of their endogenous PDE. Before being used, test membranes were incubated for 5 h at room temperature to achieve practically irreversible binding of GTP upon transducin activation (see Arshavsky et al., 1994Arshavsky V.Y.

Soluble trPDEαβ dimer lacking the isoprenylated and carboxymethylated C termini was prepared by tryptic proteolysis (Catty and Deterre, 1991Catty P. Deterre P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). PDE extract containing ~1 mg/ml PDE was incubated with 40 μg/ml trypsin for 90 min at 20°C which resulted in a complete enzyme activation. The proteolysis was terminated by an addition of soybean trypsin inhibitor at a final concentration of 400 μg/ml. trPDEαβ was then purified to >95% purity by gel filtration of a Superose-6 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford, 1976Bradford M.M. Anal.

To obtain PDEγ and its mutants the coding sequence of the PDEγ from the synthetic gene for the fusion protein (Brown and Stryer, 1989Brown R.L. Stryer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The alanine substitutions were introduced by a “cassette mutagenesis” strategy. For each mutation two complementary oligonucleotides containing desired mutations and protruding ends matching appropriate restriction sites were annealed and ligated with the vector replacing the wild type sequence. The vectors were transfected into Escherichia coli BL21-DE3 strain. Protein expression was induced by isopropyl β-D-thiogalactoside. PDEγ or its mutants were then purified by a combination of cation-exchange and reverse-phase chromatography (Brown and Stryer, 1989Brown R.L. Stryer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The purity of PDEγ was estimated to be >95%; the PDEγ concentration was determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 7,100. The concentration of the W70A mutant whose absorbance at 280 nm is small was determined either based on the results of a complete amino acid analysis of this protein or by the Bradford, 1976Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216377) Google Scholar method using the wild type PDEγ as the standard. Both methods yielded identical results.

Transducin GTPase activity was determined by a single-turnover technique described in detail by Arshavsky et al., 1991Arshavsky V.Y. Gray-Keller M.P. Bownds M.D. J. Biol.

All the measurements were conducted at room temperature (22-25°C) in a buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 100 mM NaCl, and 8 mM MgCl2. The reaction was started by mixing 20 μl of the test membranes (20 μM final rhodopsin concentration) with 20 μl of [γ-32P]GTP (~4 × 104 dpm/pmol, 0.2 μM final concentration) supplemented by various concentrations of PDEγ or its mutants. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 μl of 6% perchloric acid. 32Pi formation was measured according to a modified method of Godchaux and Zimmerman, 1979Godchaux III, W. Zimmerman W.F J.

Fluorescent measurements were performed as described earlier (Artemyev et al., 1992Artemyev N.O. Rarick H.M. Mills J.S. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25067-25072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) on a Perkin Elmer LS5B spectrofluorometer in a buffer containing 10 mM HEPES, 100 mM NaCl, and 1 mM MgCl2. The excitation wavelength was 430 nm, and the emission was measured at 520 nm. Fluorescence of 25 nM PDEγLY in the presence of 50 nM GtαGTPγS was measured before and after additions of increasing concentrations of PDEγ or its mutants. PDEγ or mutants cause a decrease in the fluorescence due to their competition with PDEγLY for binding to GtαGTPγS. The KD values in all cases were calculated from the competition curves considering 36 nM as the KD value for the PDEγLY·GtαGTPγS complex (Artemyev et al., 1992Artemyev N.O. Rarick H.M. Mills J.S. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25067-25072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PDEγ was covalently attached to the surface of the BIAcore sensor chip (Pharmacia Biosensor) via primary amines following the activation of the carboxymethyl groups of dextran on the chip. Briefly, the CM5 chip was activated at the flow rate of 5 μl/min with 30 μl of 0.2 MN-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N-ethylcarbodiimide and 0.4 M of N-hydroxysuccinimide, and then 15-45 μl of 0.5 μM PDEγ in 100 mM NaCl with 10 mM sodium formate (pH 4.3) were flown through the activated surface. Unbound groups were blocked by 30 μl of 1 M ethanolamine (pH 8.5). The noncovalently bound PDEγ was then removed by a 5-μl pulse of 6 M guanidine, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). For kinetics studies 35 μl of varying concentrations of GtαGTPγS or trPDEαβ were injected at a flow rate of 5 μl/min in a buffer containing 120 mM NaCl, 8 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.05 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 10 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5). Each injection was followed by a buffer flow for ~7 min to monitor the dissociation of the complex. For regeneration the cycle was concluded by a 5-μl pulse of 6 M guanidine, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The data were analyzed after subtraction of background signal (blank injections) with the BIAevaluation software (Pharmacia Biosensor). The kinetic parameters of the PDEγ·GtαGTPγS interaction were determined by fitting the data to the general rate equation: dRdt=kass⋅T⋅(P−R)−kdiss⋅R or dRdt=kass⋅T⋅P−R⋅(kass⋅T+kdiss) where R is the PDEγ·GtαGTPγS complex concentration (it is proportional to the amplitude of the SPR signal), t is time, T is GtαGTPγS concentration (which remains constant during each injection due to the constant flow of fresh solution through the reaction cell), P is the total amount of immobilized PDEγ, kass and kdiss are the association and dissociation rate constants. As seen from the rearranged equation, the change in the response (dR/dt) is linearly related to the response amplitude (R) with the slope proportional to transducin concentration. The values of the slopes for the lines dR/dt versus R obtained at different transducin concentrations were then replotted as a function of transducin concentration. The kass for PDEγ and each of the mutants could now be determined as slopes of these lines, while kdiss is the ordinate intercept. Alternatively the values of kdiss were determined from the exponential analysis of the SPR signal decay after replacement of the GtαGTPγS solution by the buffer. The kdiss values determined by these two methods did not differ more than 3-fold. The second method, however, provided more reliable data, so it was used for the calculations of the KD values presented in this study. The same analysis was performed in the case of trPDEαβ. Alanine scanning mutagenesis (Gibbs and Zoller, 1991Gibbs C.S. Zoller M.J. Methods: A Companion to Methods Enzymol. 1991; 3: 165-173Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar) was used to determine the residues on PDEγ which are responsible for the stimulation of GTPase activity of the rod G-protein, transducin. A previous study (Arshavsky et al., 1994Arshavsky V.Y. Dumke C.L. Zhu Y. Artemyev N.O. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Bownds M.D. J. Biol.

Since two alanine residues are present in this segment, the total number of mutants was 23. Their ability to stimulate transducin GTPase was compared with that of the wild type PDEγ in the test system containing photoreceptor membranes with most of their transducin, but depleted of endogenous PDE. A single turnover approach described in detail in our previous publications (Arshavsky et al., 1989Arshavsky V.Y. Antoch M.P. Lukjanov K.A. Philippov P.P. FEBS Lett. 1989; 250: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, Arshavsky et al., 1991Arshavsky V.Y. Gray-Keller M.P. Bownds M.D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 19882-19887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used to monitor the rate of transducin GTPase. Briefly, the GTPase reaction was initiated by the addition of [γ-32P]GTP in the amount less than transducin. GTP was quickly bound to transducin due to a relatively high concentration of transducin in this assay, so the subsequent formation of the 32Pi reflected a single synchronized turnover of transducin GTPase. This approach is illustrated in Fig. 1 showing a family of the GTP hydrolysis curves obtained with increasing concentrations of PDEγ. Based on their ability to stimulate transducin GTPase the mutants can be separated into three groups (Fig. 2A). The first group of 15 mutants has GTPase activating ability similar to that of wild type PDEγ. The seven members of the second group, V66A, F73A, L76A, L78A, L81A, I86A, and I87A, retain only 35-50% of their GAP activity. The third group includes only one mutant, W70A, in which the ability to activate transducin GTPase is abolished. Interestingly, all the mutations leading to a change of phenotype have substitutions of hydrophobic rather than charged or polar amino acid residues. In principle, the reduction of the PDEγ mutants' ability to stimulate transducin GTPase might be caused by two mechanisms. It might be the result of lower efficiency of formation of the complex between transducin and PDEγ or inability of the mutant PDEγ to accelerate GTP hydrolysis after forming a complex with transducin. To decide which of these is correct, we studied transducin association with PDEγ mutants by two complementary techniques. The first is based on the ability of transducin's α-subunit complex with GTPγS (GtαGTPγS) to enhance the fluorescence of PDEγ labeled with lucifer yellow vinyl sulfone (Artemyev et al., 1992Artemyev N.O. Rarick H.M. Mills J.S. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25067-25072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The KD for PDEγLY binding with GtαGTPγS was determined from the measurements of fluorescence changes, and then the KD values for the wild type PDEγ and all the mutants were calculated from the analysis of their competition with PDEγLY for binding to GtαGTPγS. Fig. 2B shows that the only mutation causing a substantial (4-5-fold) reduction of the PDEγ affinity for transducin was W70A. Direct measurements of GtαGTPγS binding to the W70A mutant labeled with lucifer yellow vinyl sulfone revealed a similar, ~10-fold loss in affinity (data not shown). This is in general agreement with an earlier observation that a W70F substitution results in ~100-fold reduction of PDEγ affinity for transducin (Otto-Bruc et al., 1993Otto-Bruc A. Antonny B. Vuong T.M. Chardin P. Chabre M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8636-8645Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The second approach to analysis of transducin-PDEγ interaction was direct monitoring of complex formation by surface plasmon resonance on Pharmacia Biosensor's BIAcore instrument (Jönsson et al., 1991Jönsson U. Fägerstam L. Ivarsson B. Johnsson B. Karlsson R. Lundh K. Löfs S. Persson B. Roos H. Rönnberg I. Sjölander S. Stenberg E. Sthlberg R. Urbaniczky C. stlin H. Malmqvist M.

Nature. 1993; 365: 343-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). PDEγ (wild type and one representative of each group of mutants, P69A, F78A, and W70A) was covalently attached on the dextran layer of the sensor chip, and different concentrations of GtαGTPγS were applied. The binding of GtαGTPγS with immobilized PDEγ or PDEγ mutants was monitored as an increase of the SPR signal (Fig. 3, upper panels). After 7 min the flow of transducin solution was exchanged for a flow of buffer, initiating GtαGTPγS dissociation from the chip. The kinetic parameters of the PDEγ·GtαGTPγS interaction were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The data obtained with the SPR measurements are in a good agreement with the determinations of PDEγLY fluorescence changes. The only mutant showing a substantial, ~25-fold, reduction of the affinity to transducin was W70A. This reduction is due to the decrease of the association rate; the dissociation rate for this mutant is not affected. The KD values for PDEγ and its mutants obtained with BIAcore were higher than those with the lucifer yellow method most likely reflecting differences in the properties of immobilized PDEγ and free PDEγ in solution. An important conclusion from the analysis of PDEγ binding to transducin is that it was completely saturated at the mutant concentrations (30 μM for W70A and 2 μm for all other mutants) used in the GTPase assays. Therefore, a reduction of GTPase stimulation by all the mutants from the second and the third groups shown in Fig. 2A does not simply reflect lower efficiency of the transducin-PDEγ complex formation but results from an altered ability of these mutants to activate GTP hydrolysis in a complex with transducin. The W70A mutation, although decreasing PDEγ interaction with transducin, does not alter PDEγ interaction with PDE catalytic subunits. The ability of this mutant to inhibit the activity of trPDEαβ was identical to that of the wild type PDEγ (not shown). The kinetics of the W70A mutant interactions with the PDE catalytic subunits was measured with the BIAcore instrument (Fig. 4). In contrast to transducin, the rate of the W70A mutant association with trPDEαβ was identical to that for the PDEγ wild type. The dissociation of trPDEαβ from the sensor chip appears to be the same for both mutant and wild type PDEγ. It is slower than the resolution limit of the instrument, 0.0005 s−1, so the value of the KD could be only estimated to be less than 3 nM. PDEγ regulates the activity of two central components of the phototransduction cascade. First, it inhibits the catalytic activity of the nonactivated PDE. This inhibition is released upon PDE activation by the GTP-bound form of transducin's α-subunit. The second function of PDEγ is to stimulate the rate of transducin-bound GTP hydrolysis, thus regulating the lifetime of PDE activation. This function is most likely to be a result of coordinated action of PDEγ and another membrane-associated factor whose nature remains unidentified (see below). Two domains on PDEγ are shown to be involved in both of these interactions. The first domain is located within the C-terminal third of the molecule. The site of PDEαβ inhibition resides mainly within the C-terminal sequence Gly85-Ile86-Ile87 (Lipkin et al., 1988Lipkin V.M. Dumler I.L. Muradov K.G. Artemyev N.O. Etingof R.N.

Chem. 1995; 270: 13210-13215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), while the residues between Asp63 and Leu86 (Skiba et al., 1995Skiba N.P. Artemyev N.O. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13210-13215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) participate in binding to transducin. Our previous study (Arshavsky et al., 1994Arshavsky V.Y. Dumke C.L. Zhu Y. Artemyev N.O. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Bownds M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19882-19887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that a peptide corresponding to the sequence between Asp63 and Ile87 is capable of stimulating transducin GTPase to the same extent as PDEγ. Another part of PDEγ which participates in the binding with both PDEαβ and transducin is the lysine-rich area between residues Arg24 and Gly46 (Morrison et al., 1987Morrison D.F. Rider M.A. Takemoto D.J. FEBS Lett. 1987; 222: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, Morrison et al., 1989Morrison D.F. Cunnick J.M. Oppert B. Takemoto D.J. J. Biol.

J. 1992; 281: 637-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The most likely role of this segment is to increase the affinity of PDEγ to both PDEαβ and transducin by providing an additional binding site for these interactions. Here we report the identification of amino acid residues within the Asp63-Ile87 segment of PDEγ that are directly involved in the regulation of transducin GTPase. Eight hydrophobic residues are important for this function. The alanine substitutions of seven of them, Val66, Phe73, Leu76, Leu78, Leu81, Ile86, and Ile87, result in a 2-3-fold reduction of their ability to stimulate transducin GTPase. The binding affinity of these mutants to transducin is the same as that of the wild type PDEγ. The alanine substitution of Trp70 results in a reduction of the mutant's affinity for transducin (in agreement with the report of Otto-Bruc et al., 1993Otto-Bruc A. Antonny B. Vuong T.M. Chardin P. Chabre M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8636-8645Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and also leads to a complete abolishment of the mutant's ability to stimulate GTP hydrolysis after forming a complex with transducin. Interestingly, this mutation is crucial only for PDEγ interaction with transducin. No differences in the interaction between the W70A mutant and PDEαβ were revealed in this study. Until recently the regulation of transducin GTPase activity in ROS remained as one of the most controversial aspects of the phototransduction biochemistry (see Arshavsky et al., 1994Arshavsky V.Y.

However, recent data from three laboratories (Angleson and Wensel, 1994Angleson J.K. Wensel T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16290-16296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Arshavsky et al., 1994Arshavsky V.Y. Dumke C.L. Zhu Y. Artemyev N.O. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Bownds M.D. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15215-15222Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) led the authors to a consensus conclusion that the acceleration of transducin GTPase is a result of coordinate action of PDE (or PDEγ) and another factor, most likely protein, tightly associated with the photoreceptor membranes. The only minor discrepancy which remains to be resolved is whether the factor itself is capable of causing some acceleration of transducin GTPase in the absence of PDEγ. This discrepancy may be apparent and simply reflect different amounts of residual PDE in the membrane preparations used in these studies. In any case, it does not appear to be possible to determine the exact role of PDEγ and the membrane factor on the GTP hydrolysis before the factor is characterized. It may be noted, however, that the mechanism of the PDEγ action is most likely to be distinct from the intrinsic G-protein GTPase or from the action of GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) that regulate the small GTP-binding proteins. Specifically, while a conserved arginine and glutamine are required for the intrinsic hydrolysis of GTP by the α-subunits of heterotrimeric G-proteins (Markby et al., 1993Markby D.W. Onrust R. Bourne H.R. Science. 1993; 262: 1895-1901Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar; Sondek et al., 1994Sondek J. Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B.

Skinner R.H. Webb M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10914-10919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), transducin GTPase acceleration by PDEγ requires the action of eight hydrophobic amino acid residues. Along with recent observations that G-protein α-subunits interact with their effectors by multiple sites not directly involved in GTP-binding (summarized by Artemyev and Hamm, 1994Artemyev N.O. Hamm H.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 752-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), our data indicate that PDEγ action may be a result of hydrophobic interactions between long sequences of PDEγ and transducin. The consequences of such interactions may include an optimal positioning of the residues directly involved in GTP hydrolysis or better exclusion of bulk water leading to a decrease of the dielectric content of the catalytic center. Alternatively, PDEγ binding with transducin may be necessary for a further interaction of the complex with the membrane factor. These questions will be addressed in future research. We thank Dr. M. I. Simon for many helpful discussions and Dr. R. Swanson for help with the BIAcore instrument."

In the present study, in vitro mutagenesis was used to identify the region within the 7B2 sequence responsible for the inhibition of PC2. Mutant proteins were produced in a prokaryotic expression system and their effects on PC1/PC3 and PC2 activities were studied by two different in vitro enzyme assays. None of the 7B2 mutant proteins inhibited PC1/PC3 activity. Truncation studies revealed that a short segment within the COOH-terminal portion of 7B2 is critical for its inhibitory effect on PC2. This segment contains a pair of basic amino acid residues which may represent a recognition motif for PC2. Single amino acid substitutions within this Lys171-Lys172 site strongly diminished and a double mutation abolished the inhibitory potency of 7B2.

Many peptide hormones, neuropeptides, and other biologically active peptides and proteins are produced through intracellular proteolytic cleavage of larger precursor proteins at pairs of basic amino acid residues (Douglass et al., 1984Douglass J. Civelli O. Herbert E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 665-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Recently, a mammalian family of processing enzymes related to bacterial subtilisins has been identified. This family specifically participates in the endoproteolytic cleavage of proproteins in the secretory pathway (Barr, 1991Barr P.J.

The family includes the prohormone convertases PC1 (also known as PC3) and PC2, which are localized to the regulated secretory pathway of neuroendocrine cells, and the more broadly distributed transmembrane proteinase furin, involved in the proteolysis of proproteins in the constitutive pathway of secretion. The neuroendocrine polypeptide 7B2 is exclusively present in prohormone-producing cells possessing a regulated secretory pathway. In vivo, proteolytic processing of the ~27-kDa precursor form of 7B2 occurs at a site marked by basic amino acids in the COOH-terminal domain by an unidentified proteinase, resulting in the production of a ~21-kDa 7B2 form (Ayoubi et al., 1990Ayoubi T.A.Y.

The COOH-terminal half of the 7B2 protein sequence, on the other hand, shares a low degree of homology with members of the potato inhibitor I family, which includes subtilisin inhibitors (Martens et al., 1994Martens G.J.M.

Intact recombinant 27-kDa 7B2, but not processed 21-kDa 7B2, is in vitro a potent inhibitor of PC2 activity and prevents pro-PC2 cleavage. The activity of PC1/PC3, however, was not affected by either form of 7B2, indicating that 7B2 specifically inhibits PC2 (Martens et al., 1994Martens G.J.M. Braks J.A.M. Eib D.W. Zhou Y. Lindberg I.

Furthermore, newly synthesized 7B2 transiently and selectively associates with pro-PC2 in vivo, consistent with its putative role as a chaperone (Braks and Martens, 1994Braks J.A.M. Martens G.J.M.

In the present study, 7B2 mutant proteins were produced and studied as possible inhibitors of PC2 and PC1/PC3 in order to define the region within 7B2 responsible for the potent and selective inhibition of PC2.

The plasmid pNG86 was constructed by digesting the 27 kDa 7B2 construct with KpnI and HindIII followed by low melting point-agarose purification and blunt-end ligation. The plasmid pNK171 was constructed by digesting the PCR product also used for the construct pSTTP with BamHI and SalI followed by cloning into pQE30 (SalI site indicated in bold in primer STTP-5′). Amplification of 7B2 cDNA representing amino acids Tyr1-Pro131 of the human 7B2 protein (numbering according to that in Martens, 1988Martens G.J.M. FEBS Lett. 1988; 234: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) was accomplished by PCR using the 5′ primer 7B2-5′ and 3′ primer Subt-3′ (5′-CG GAT CCC GGG ATA GTC ATG TTC CGG ATC-3′). The plasmid p7B2BS was constructed by cloning the resulting PCR product into the BamHI and SmaI sites of pQE30. Mutations in the potential PC2 recognition site Lys138-Lys139 of human 7B2 were introduced by PCR using the following primers: the 5′ primers Fur-5′ (5′-AG GAT CCC GGG TTG GGC AAG AGG AAC AAG AGA CTC CTT TAC-3′ for pFur), and Chymo-5′ (5′-AG GAT CCC GGG TTG GGC AAG TGG AAC ATG GAA CTC CTT TAC GAG-3′ for pChymo) and the 3′ primer 7B2-3′. The resulting PCR products corresponding to amino acids Pro131-Glu185 of the human 7B2 protein were cloned into the SmaI and HindIII sites of p7B2BS. Mutations in the potential furin recognition site Arg159-Arg151-Lys152-Arg153-Arg154 and in the potential PC2 recognition site Lys171-Lys172 of 7B2 were introduced by a PCR strategy involving the production of a double-stranded DNA megaprimer (Barik, 1993Barik S. Methods Mol. Biol. 1993; 15: 277-286PubMed Google Scholar). The appropriate megaprimer was generated using the 5′ primers RLKLR-5′ (5′-GGA GAG AGA CTA AAG CTG AGG AGT GTC-3′ for pRLKLR), KS-5′ (5′-GTT GTT GCA AAG TCG TCT GTC CCC CAT-3′ for pKS), KDEG-5′ (5′-GTT GTT GCA AAG (C/G) (A/T/C)G TCT GTC CCC CAT-3′ for pKV), KR-5′ (5′GTT GTT GCA AAG AGG TCT GTC CCC CAT-3′ for pKR), SS-5′ (5′-AAT GTT GTT GCA TCG TCG TCT GTC CCC CAT-3′ for pSS), RSK-5′ (5′-AAT GTT GTT GCA AG(A/T) AAG TCT GTC CCC-3′ for pRK and pSK), STTP-5′ (5′-GTT GTT GCA AAG TCG ACT ACC CCC CAT TTT TCA-3′ for pSTTP), and RAKR-5′ (5′-CTG GAT AAT GTT CGT GCA AAG AGG TCT GTC CCC CAT-3′ for pRAKR) and the 3′ primer 7B2-3′ in the first round of PCR amplification. The PCR product for the pRAKR mutant was generated by using pRLKLR cDNA as template. After low melting point-agarose purification and phenol-chloroform extraction, the resulting megaprimers served in the second round of PCR amplification as the 3′ primer introducing the appropriate mutation in 7B2 cDNA in combination with primer 7B2-5′. Purification of the PCR products was performed with low melting point-agarose, and reamplification was carried out with primers 7B2-5′ and 7B2-3′. The PCR products were cloned into the BamHI and HindIII sites of pQE30. The sequences of all 7B2 constructs were confirmed by double-stranded DNA sequence analysis using T7 DNA polymerase. Recombinant human 7B2 proteins were produced in Escherichia coli as fusion proteins with an NH2-terminal hexahistidine tag by induction of the cells with 1 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside. Recombinant proteins were purified by nickel nitriloacetate-agarose affinity chromatography according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). PC1/PC3 and PC2 activities were studied by two different in vitro assays. For the first assay, PC1/PC3 and PC2 proteinases were purified from the culture medium of overproducing CHO cells and the conditioned medium of βTC3 cells, respectively, essentially as described previously (Zhou and Lindberg, 1993Zhou Y. Lindberg I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5615-5623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Shen et al., 1993Shen F.-S. Seidah N.G. Lindberg I. J. Biol.

PC1/PC3 and PC2 activities were measured in the presence or absence of recombinant 7B2 by cleavage of a fluorogenic substrate as described previously (Martens et al., 1994Martens G.J.M. Braks J.A.M. Eib D.W. Zhou Y. Lindberg I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5784-5787Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Recombinant 7B2 proteins were reconstituted to about 1 mg/ml. Duplicate reactions were performed in 0.1 M sodium acetate, pH 5.5; 5 mM calcium chloride; 0.2 mM fluorogenic substrate (Z-Arg-Ser-Lys-Arg-AMC, where AMC is aminomethylcoumarin); 0.1% Brij; 2 μg of bovine serum albumin; 1-10 μl of diluted recombinant 7B2 or 0.1% Brij; 1 μM pepstatin A, 1 μM E-64, 140 μM TLCK, 280 μM TPCK; and 10 μl of purified PC1/PC3 or immunopurified PC2 in a final volume of 50 μl. At least five different concentrations of each mutant were used. Enzyme was preincubated with mutant 7B2 protein for 30 min at room temperature prior to the addition of substrate. Incubations were carried out at 37°C in polypropylene microtiter plates, and the amount of the fluorescent product AMC was estimated in a microtiter plate fluorometer every hour for 5-7 h. Production of AMC was linear after the first hour. The rate of AMC production in control reactions (no 7B2 protein) was about 100 pmol/h. Data are calculated from 6-7 h time points; nonlinear regression was used to derive the point of 50% inhibition for each protein. For the second assay, the proinsulin endoproteinases PC1/PC3 and PC2 were solubilized by detergent extraction of insulin secretory granules prepared from rat insulinoma cells (Bailyes and Hutton, 1992Bailyes E.M. Hutton J.C. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). PC1/PC3 and PC2 proteinase activities were measured in the presence or absence of recombinant 7B2 through analysis of human 125I-proinsulin cleavage essentially as described previously for PC1/PC3 (Bailyes and Hutton, 1992Bailyes E.M. Hutton J.C. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The assay mixture contained 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.5; 1 mM calcium chloride; 0.1% Triton X-100; 10 μM E-64; 10 μM pepstatin A; 100 μM TPCK and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. In control incubations, calcium chloride was replaced by 2 mM EDTA. Enzyme and recombinant 7B2 proteins were preincubated for 30 min before the enzyme assay was started by the addition of substrate. Incubations (total volume: 55 μl) were conducted at 30°C for 2 h and terminated by the addition of Tris, pH 8.0, to a final concentration of 0.1 M. Proinsulin and its cleavage products were separated through immunoprecipitation using the cellulose-coupled monoclonal antibodies A6 (directed against the B-chain/C-peptide junction of proinsulin) or ANT-1 (directed against the C-peptide/A-chain junction of proinsulin; Crowther et al., 1994Crowther N.J. Xiao B. Jorgensen P.N. Dodson G.G. Hales C.N. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) in order to determine PC1/PC3 or PC2 enzyme activity, respectively. Radioactivity remaining in the supernatant after immunoprecipitation was determined and the activity was expressed as the percentage conversion of the initial radioactivity. Cleavage of recombinant 7B2 proteins by purified recombinant PC1/PC3 and immunopurified PC2 was analyzed by incubating 1 μg of 7B2 for 16 h at 37°C in 0.1 M sodium acetate, pH 5.5; 5 mM calcium chloride; 0.1% Brij; 2 μg of bovine serum albumin; 10 μl of diluted recombinant 7B2 or its diluent, 0.1% Brij; 1 μM pepstatin A, 1 μM E-64; 140 μM TLCK; and 280 μM TPCK. Control reactions contained 5 mM EDTA instead of 5 mM calcium chloride. One-quarter of each reaction was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting performed as described previously (Martens et al., 1994Martens G.J.M. Braks J.A.M. Eib D.W. Zhou Y. Lindberg I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5784-5787Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) using a combination of two anti-7B2 monoclonal antibodies (MON-102 and MON-144; Van Duijnhoven et al., 1991Van Duijnhoven J.L.P. Verschuren M.C.M. Timmer E.D.J. Vissers P.M.A.M. Groeneveld A. Ayoubi T.A.Y. Van den Ouweland A.M.W. Van de Ven W.J.M. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 142: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The effect of recombinant 7B2 on PC2 activity was studied by two different in vitro assays. One assay was based on PC2-mediated cleavage of a fluorogenic substrate (Z-Arg-Ser-Lys-Arg-AMC) (Martens et al., 1994Martens G.J.M. Braks J.A.M. Eib D.W. Zhou Y. Lindberg I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5784-5787Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) using PC2 obtained by immunopurification (Shen et al., 1993Shen F.-S. Seidah N.G. Lindberg I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24910-24915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Lindberg et al., 1995Lindberg I. van den Hurk W.H. Bui C. Batie C.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34 (in press)Google Scholar) from the conditioned medium of the mouse pancreatic cell line βTC3. The second assay used 125I-proinsulin as a substrate and was based on the separation of cleavage products by immunoprecipitation (with a monoclonal antibody directed against the PC2 cleavage site in the C-peptide/A-chain junction of proinsulin), followed by determination of the radioactivity that remained in the supernatant. As a source for the enzyme in this assay, solubilized secretory granules of rat insulinoma cells were used (Bailyes and Hutton, 1992Bailyes E.M. Hutton J.C. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In both assays, recombinant 27-kDa 7B2 produced half-maximal inhibition of PC2 at nanomolar concentrations (Fig. 1A and Table I). In contrast, at submicromolar concentrations, the COOH-terminally truncated recombinant 21-kDa form of 7B2 did not affect PC2 activity (Fig. 1A and Table I). Granular PC1/PC3 was not inhibited by either form of 7B2 (Fig. 1B).Table IInhibitory potency of truncated 7B2 proteinsTable IInhibitory potency of truncated 7B2 proteins As an initial step toward the identification of the region within the 7B2 sequence responsible for the inhibition of PC2, we have produced the NH2- and COOH-terminal halves of 7B2 in E. coli and purified the recombinant proteins to near homogeneity by affinity chromatography. The NH2-terminal domain of 7B2 did not inhibit PC2 activity (mutant pNG86, representing amino acid residues Tyr1 to Gly86; Table I and Fig. 2). This portion of the protein is chaperonin-related and may function in vivo as a molecular chaperone to act in the proper folding or prevent aggregation of proPC2 (Braks and Martens, 1994Braks J.A.M. Martens G.J.M. Cell. 1994; 78: 263-273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The COOH-terminal half of 7B2 (mutants pCP93 and pCD125 corresponding to Pro93-Glu185 and Asp125-Glu185, respectively) which carries regions structurally related to members of the potato inhibitor I family (Martens et al., 1994Martens G.J.M. Braks J.A.M. Eib D.W. Zhou Y. Lindberg I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5784-5787Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), inhibited PC2 activity with comparable potency to intact 7B2 (Table I and Fig. 2). Note that with these 7B2 fragments, similar effects on PC2 activity were observed in the two different assays (Table I and Fig. 2). This was in fact found to hold for all truncated and mutated 7B2 proteins examined in the present study (see below). Next, COOH-terminally truncated forms of 7B2 were produced to further localize the inhibitory domain within the COOH-terminal half of 7B2. The inhibitory potencies of the truncated proteins encompassing Tyr1 to Gly162, Tyr1 to Asn167, and Tyr1 to Lys171 (mutants pNG162, pNN167, and pNK171, respectively) were dramatically diminished, as compared with the potency of intact 7B2 (Table I and Fig. 2). In contrast, the truncated 7B2 protein representing amino acid residues Tyr1 to Phe177 (mutant pNF177) was a relatively potent inhibitor of PC2 (Table I and Fig. 2). These results indicate that a region of six amino acid residues within 7B2 (Lys172 to Phe177) is crucial for PC2 inhibition. Interestingly, the COOH-terminal portion of 7B2 encompassing amino acid residues Val168 to His176 is identical among all mammalian, fish, and amphibian 7B2 sequences identified thus far, whereas the region surrounding this portion is much less conserved (Waldbieser et al., 1991Waldbieser G.C. Aimi J. Dixon J.E. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 3228-3236Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar; Brayton et al., 1988Brayton K.A. Aimi J. Qiu H. Yazdanparast R. Ghatei M.A. Polak J.M. Bloom S.R.

In prohormones, pairs of basic amino acid residues are thought to be potential recognition sites for prohormone convertases (Barr, 1991Barr P.J. Cell. 1991; 66: 1-3Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar; Steiner et al., 1992Steiner D.F. Smeekens S.P. Ohagi S. Chan S.J. J. Biol.

Metab. 1992; 3: 133-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The potential PC2 binding site Lys171-Lys172 is present within the portion of 7B2 which is highly conserved and now suspected to be responsible for the in vitro inhibition of PC2 activity. These observations prompted us to mutate this site. Substitution of Lys171-Lys172 by Ser171-Ser172 (mutant pSS) indeed abolished the inhibitory potency of 7B2 (Table II and Fig. 2). The potency of 7B2 was also impaired through the substitution of Lys172 with Val (pKV), but to a lesser extent than with the Lys172 to Ser mutant (Table II and Fig. 2). This indicates that the effects of the Lys172 mutations apparently depend on the nature of the substituting amino acid residue. Remarkably, substitution of Lys172 by Arg (mutant pKR) attenuated the inhibitory effect of 7B2, whereas the Lys171 to Arg mutant protein (mutant pRK) was as potent as nonmutated 7B2 (Table II and Fig. 2). Having demonstrated the critical role of Lys171-Lys172, we then decided to investigate whether other amino acid residues directly surrounding this dibasic pair are important for PC2 inhibition. Indeed, additional substitution of Val169 or Ser173-Val174 (mutants pRAKR and pSTTP, respectively) further diminished the inhibitory potency of 7B2 (Table II and Fig. 2). The Lys171-Lys172 site is probably a site of proteolytic cleavage in vivo, since the COOH-terminal 7B2 peptide corresponding to Ser173 to Glu185 has been recently identified in bovine adrenal medulla chromaffin vesicles (Sigafoos et al., 1993Sigafoos J. Chestnut W.G. Merrill B.M. Taylor L.C.E. Diliberto Jr., E.J. Viveros O.H. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 1993; 13: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The enzyme responsible for this cleavage remains to be identified. In contrast to the substitutions within Lys171-Lys172, mutations within the two other potential PC2 recognition sites in 7B2, namely Lys138-Lys139 (mutants pChymo and pFur) and Arg150-Arg-Lys-Arg-Arg154 (mutant pRLKLR), did not impair the inhibitory capacity of 7B2 (Table II and Fig. 2). This indicates that paired basic amino acids other than Lys171-Lys172 do not contribute to the ability of 7B2 to inhibit PC2. Again, in the two different enzyme assays for both PC2 and PC1/PC3, similar results were obtained with these 7B2 mutants. None of the 7B2 mutant proteins described here was able to inhibit PC1/PC3 (data not shown).Table IIInhibitory potency of mutated 7B2 proteins We recently reported that intact recombinant 7B2 was cleaved in vitro by PC1/PC3 but not by PC2 (Martens et al., 1994Martens G.J.M. Braks J.A.M. Eib D.W. Zhou Y. Lindberg I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5784-5787Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In order to examine whether our 7B2 mutants were cleaved, we incubated the recombinant proteins in the presence of PC2 or PC1/PC3 and analyzed the cleavage products by Western blotting. No PC2-mediated cleavage of recombinant 27 kDa 7B2 nor of the pFur, pChymo, and pRLKLR mutant proteins was observed under the present conditions (data not shown). These results are in line with the finding that these recombinant proteins potently inhibit PC2 activity. In vitro, PC1/PC3 has been shown to cleave intact recombinant 7B2 at Arg153-Arg154 but not at Lys138-Lys139 (Martens et al., 1994Martens G.J.M. Braks J.A.M. Eib D.W. Zhou Y. Lindberg I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5784-5787Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis revealed that the pFur and pRLKLR mutant proteins were effectively cleaved by PC1/PC3 (Fig. 3). The size of the fragment (18 kDa) generated from the pFur mutant protein indicated that the introduction of a potential furin recognition site through replacement of Trp136-Asn-Lys-Lys139 by Arg136-Asn-Lys-Arg139 resulted in cleavage at this site by PC1/PC3. Interestingly, alteration of the natural furin site in 7B2, Arg150-Arg-Lys-Arg-Arg154 to Arg150-Leu-Lys-Leu-Arg154 (mutant pRLKLR), still resulted in the production of a fragment of 21 kDa by PC1/PC3 (Fig. 3), consistent with other studies which indicate that PC1/PC3 is able to cleave at single basic amino acid residues (Nakayama et al., 1992Nakayama K. Watanabe T. Nakagawa T. Kim W.-S. Nagahama M. Hosaka M. Hatsuzawa K. Kondoh-Hashiba K. Murakami K. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 337: 60-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The findings of these cleavage studies are in accordance with the observation that none of the 7B2 mutant proteins examined in the present study affected PC1/PC3 activity (data not shown). Taken together, our data indicate that a short segment located near the COOH terminus of 7B2 is responsible for the potent and selective inhibition of PC2 activity. The potential PC2 binding site Lys171-Lys172 present within this segment appears to be essential, but not fully responsible, for the inhibitory potency of 7B2 and probably acts in concert with other amino acid residues in the direct vicinity of this site.

It is important in inflammatory recruitment of leukocytes, lymphopoiesis, and a number of development events. Here we have mapped a panel of functional monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) recognizing the integrin α4 chain, using murine/human chimeric constructs expressed in COS7 cells. We find that: 1) mAbs that induce homotypic aggregation (epitope A mAbs) map to the most N-terminal 100 amino acids of the human α4 chain; 2) mAbs that block adhesion of α4β1 to VCAM-1 and fibronectin (epitope B mAbs) map to a 52-amino-acid region between residues 152 and 203 of human α4; 3) epitope B mAbs that do or do not induce aggregation (epitope B2 and B1 mAbs, respectively) map to the same regions and are therefore indistinguishable by this analysis; 4) mAbs that neither induce homotypic aggregation nor block adhesion (epitope C mAbs) map to a distinct region of the molecule comprising amino acids 422-606. The N-terminal region of the α4 chain identified by functional A and B epitope mAbs does not correspond to ligand binding sites identified in other α subunits, such as cation binding sites or the “I-domain,” which α4 lacks, and thus represents a novel site for epitope functionality among the integrins.

Cellular adhesion and de-adhesion is a dynamic process with multiple physiologic and pathologic consequences. The integrins, a large group of cell-surface heterodimers each composed of an α subunit noncovalently associated with a β subunit, are central to many of these adhesion-dependent events.

All α chains have 2-4 putative divalent cation binding sites, and in some instances these cation binding sites have been implicated in ligand binding (14D'Souza S.E. Ginsberg M.H. Burke T.A. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3440-3446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Smith J.W. Cheresh D.A. J. Biol.

The α chains can be subdivided into two groups, which either contain or lack an inserted or “I domain” just proximal to the putative cation binding sites. Recent studies show that the I domains from αM, αL, α1, and α2 play a role in ligand binding, implicating these domains directly in α chain function (see “Discussion”). However, many integrin α chains, including α4, lack an I domain, and the regions involved in ligand interactions remain largely undefined. mAb epitope mapping studies provide one approach to this problem. Many mAbs to human α4 have been described, and we have shown that they can be classified into three topographically and four functionally distinct groups, designated A, B1, B2, and C (18). Group A mAbs partially block ligand binding functions and stimulate homotypic adhesion (aggregation) of leukocytic cells by an unknown mechanism. Group B mAbs strongly block binding of α4β1-bearing cells to their ligands (FN and VCAM); a subgroup of B mAbs designated B2 stimulates aggregation, while B1 mAbs do not. Group C mAbs neither block binding to ligand nor cause aggregation but block aggregation induced by any A mAbs, as do B1 mAbs. Conversely, group A mAbs block aggregation induced by any B2 mAb. In some cell types α4 is cleaved into an 80-kDa N-terminal heavy chain and a 70-kDa light chain, which remain noncovalently associated (1Hemler M.E. Huang C. Takada Y. Schwarz L. Strominger J.L. Clabby M.L. J. Bioi. Chem. 1987; 262: 11478-11485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation studies have shown that all three epitopes (A, B, and C) are found within the N-terminal heavy chain (19Pulido R. Campanero M.R. Garcia-Pardo A. Sanchez-Madrid F. FEBS Lett. 1991; 294: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To better understand α4 integrin structure and function, we have mapped these functionally distinct epitopes, using murinelhuman α4 constructs chimeric within this 80-kDa region. We find that mAbs capable of inhibiting the α4 integrin adhesive function (groups B1 and B2) define epitopes dependent upon amino acids located between 152 and 203 in the N-terminal portion of the α chain, thus implicating a novel structural region in α4 integrin function. The human α4 cDNA was cloned as described (20Takada Y. Elices M.J. Crouse C. Hemler M.E. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1361-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Briefly, two overlapping cDNA clones were obtained from a λgt10 cDNA library of HPB-MLT cell RNA. The SalI-XmnI 5′ and XmnI-BamHI 3′ digested cDNA clones were assembled into the pBluescript vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CAl. The cDNA was later excised with XhoI and NotI and cloned into the expression vector CDM8 (21Seed B. Nature. 1987; 329: 840-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). The mouse α4 cDNA was cloned from TKI cell RNA as described (22Neuhaus H. Hu M.C. Hemler M.E. Takada Y. Holzmann B. Weissman I.L. J.

COS7 cells were cultured as described previously (25Osborn L. Hession C. Tizard R. Vassallo C. Luhowskyj S. Chi-Rosso G. Lobb R. Cell. 1989; 59: 1203-1211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1431) Google Scholar). Unique cloning sites were engineered into the 4800-nucleotide human α4 cDNA in vector CDM8, described above, by gapped heteroduplex mutagenesis using 26-mer oligomers. BsiWI, NarI; PstI, and AflII sites were added at nucleotide positions 87, 961, 1402, and 1960, respectively; these mutations were chosen because they do not change the amino acid sequence. Three human α4 fragments were then exchanged with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-generated fragments (encoding about 300 amino acids each) of the homologous mouse α4 sequence. The resulting chimeras were called HMα4 sections 1, 2, and 3. Clones were screened by hybridization of colony lifts with radiolabeled oligomers. Finer mapping of antibody binding sites within section 1 was facilitated by the construction of five additional chimeras, substituting mouse sequences encoding approximately 50 amino acids for homologous human sequences. Section 1a was constructed as described for section 1, utilizing the BsiWI site and a BclI site at nucleotide position 297. Sections 1b-e were constructed using spliced overlap extension PCR (26Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2648) Google Scholar, 27Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). Either 2-or 3-fragment spliced overlap extension PCRs were performed with 31-39-mer primers and Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The outer primers were engineered with BclI and NarI sites; PCR fragments were cloned into a NarI and partial BclI-digested vector containing the rest of the human α4 cDNA. All chimeras were screened by hybridization to oligomers consisting of internal mouse sequence and by restriction mapping. DNA sequences of the sections generated by spliced overlap extension PCR as well as their cloning junctions were confirmed by the dideoxynucleotide method. Sequence analysis was done using the GCG Package, Genetic Computing Group, Madison, WI. Plasmid DNA prepared with CsCl gradients or with Qiagen columns (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CAl for each of the chimeric constructs, along with the parental (positive) and vector only (negative) controls, were electroporated into COS7 cells, stained with antibodies, and analyzed by a FACStar™ (BectonDickinson, San Jose, CAl 48-72 h later, as described previously (28Osborn L.

Antibody staining of the chimeras is presented as a percentage of positive control and is normalized for differences of expression. VCAM-Ig (29Wang J.-H. Pepinsky B. Karpusas M. Liu J.-H. Osborn L.

Cell Adh. & Comm. 1995; 3 (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) was used to assay functionality of chimeric α4 heterodimers. COS7 transfectants were incubated with VCAM-Ig in the presence of 1 mM MnCl2 for 30 min at 22°C, washed, and stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-Iabeled anti-human IgG secondary antibody as described, followed by FACStar™ analysis. Results were normalized and expressed as described above for antibody staining. Immunoprecipitation studies have shown that all three epitopes (A, B, and C) are found within the 80-kDa N-terminal portion of the α4 chain (19Pulido R. Campanero M.R. Garcia-Pardo A. Sanchez-Madrid F. FEBS Lett. 1991; 294: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), which also contains three putative cation binding sites. Based on these structural data, we initially divided the coding sequence for the N-terminal 80-kDa fragment into three sections, N-terminal to, containing, and C-terminal to the cation binding sites and termed sections 1, 2, and 3 (see Fig. 1). Restriction sites were engineered at the junctions between these sections, and each section was replaced by an analogous murine fragment generated by PCR. The resulting constructs were transiently transfected into COS7 cells and analyzed for expression, adhesion function, and binding to a panel of mAbs by FACS analysis. All α4 mAbs bound to cells that had been transfected with wild-type human α4 eDNA. None bound to wild-type murine α4-transfected cells (data not shown), although these cells bound well to human VCAM-Ig fusion protein, indicating the production of fully functional α4 integrin (Fig. 2). All the human/murine chimeras also bound to human VCAM-Ig (Fig. 2).Fig. 2.Binding of VCAM-Ig to chimeric α4 COS7 cell transfectants. Background binding of VCAM-Ig to CDM8-transfected COS7 was subtracted from all points. Results were normalized for expression as determined by staining with mAb B5G10 (except for section 3, normalized to HP1/2) and depicted as a percentage of human α4 binding. Binding of VCAM-Ig to mouse α4-transfected COS7 cells was determined once, while all other points were determined twice.

Staining with B5G10 or 8F2, C epitope antibodies confirmed that the section 1 chimera was expressed at levels comparable with the wild type. All A and B epitope antibodies recognized chimeras containing substituted mouse section 2 or 3. The section 3 chimera, however, did not support B5G10 or 8F2 (C epitope) binding. In summary (Table I and Fig. 1), these initial chimeras localized determinants of C epitope mAbs to amino acids 422-606 (section 3), and those of A and B epitope mAbs to amino acids 1-274 (section 1), the most N-terminal region of the a chain.Table IMonoclonal antibody (mAb) binding to α4 chimeric constructs expressed on COS7 cells To further define the antibody binding sites of the A and B epitope mAbs, section 1 was subdivided into five regions of roughly 50 amino acids each, termed section 1a-1e chimeras. Expression and FACS analysis of these constructs showed that sections 1a and 1b are necessary for binding of A epitope mAbs. Whereas HP1/1 and HP1/3 mapped mostly to section 1a and HP2/6 mapped to 1b, the HP1/7 and P4G9 antibodies required both 1a and 1b. Although B epitope mAbs can be separated into two groups by their ability to cause aggregation (18Pulido R. Elices M.J. Campanero M.R. Osborn L. Schiffer S. Garcia-Pardo A. Lobb R. Hemler M.E. Sanchez-Madrid F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10241-10245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), they all can cross-block one another, suggesting close physical proximity of their binding sites on the natively configured α4/β1 complex. Confirming this interpretation, section 1d was required for recognition of all B epitope antibodies. Thus amino acid residues 152-203 likely contain residues that are exposed on the surface (required for antigenicity) and that are spatially close to or directly involved in surfaces contacting ligand. The binding of B epitope mAbs HP2/4 and HP1/2 for sections 1c and 1e chimeras, respectively, is lowered to about 50%, indicating some epitopic overlap of section 1d with the adjacent sections c and e (Table I). There is no overlap between the A and B epitopes. We have analyzed the relationship between structure and function of the α4 integrin chain by positionally mapping three distinct epitopes defined by a number of murine mAbs to the human α4 subunit, using human/mouse α4 chimeras. Murine and human α4 are 84% identical in amino acid sequence. They also are functionally well conserved, as murine α4-bearing cells bind human VCAM and vice versa (31Hession C. Moy P. Tizard R. Chisholm P. Williams C. Wysk M. Burkly L. Miyake K. Kincade P. Lobb R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 183: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 32Moy P. Lobb R. Tizard R. Olson D. Hession C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8835-8841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When either the human or murine α4 chain is transfected into COS7 cells, it is well expressed (presumably in conjunction with endogenous primate β1) and readily binds human or murine VCAM-1. We therefore expected that chimeric molecules of human/mouse α4 sequence would retain proper structure and function. This was indeed the case, and because mAbs to human α4 that we had previously mapped for functionality (18Pulido R. Elices M.J. Campanero M.R. Osborn L. Schiffer S. Garcia-Pardo A. Lobb R. Hemler M.E. Sanchez-Madrid F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10241-10245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are of murine origin and lack cross-reactivity to murine α4 sequences, we could use these chimeras to probe α4 chain structure and function. Our data show that: 1) mAbs that induce homotypic aggregation but only partially block ligand binding (epitope A mAbs) map to the most N-terminal 100 amino acids of the human α4 chain; 2) mAbs that strongly block adhesion of α4β1 to VCAM-1 and FN (epitope B mAbs) map to a 52-amino acid region between residues 152 and 203 of human α4; 3) epitope B mAbs that do or do not induce aggregation (epitope B2 and B1 mAbs, respectively) map to the same regions and are therefore indistinguishable by this analysis; 4) mAbs that neither induce homotypic aggregation nor block adhesion (epitope C mAbs) map to a distinct region of the molecule comprising amino acids 422-606. Thus the N-terminal region of the α4 chain represents a novel site for epitope functionality among the integrins. The integrins have been intensively studied, but due to the difficulty of obtaining large amounts of functional heterodimeric protein, their overall structure has not been determined by x-ray crystallography methods. A number of studies utilizing chemical cross-linking, mutagenesis, and peptide synthesis have localized amino acid residues physically close to or functionally required for ligand binding sites. Most extensively studied has been the platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (integrin), which binds to fibrinogen (FG), FN, and von Willebrand factor. An RGD-containing region present in each of these ligands is important for binding, as is another peptide found in the γ chain of FG, which competes with RGD for binding to the integrin (Ref. 33Santoro S. A Lawing W.J. Cell. 1987; 48: 867-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, and references therein). Sequences in the β3 and αIIb integrin chains have been implicated in binding to the RGD and the γ chain peptides, suggesting that these integrin sequences may be close in the folded protein. Remarkably, an 11-amino-acid peptide derived from one of the putative cation binding sites of αIIb has been reported to bind to FG and to block binding of FG or an FG γ chain dodecapeptide to activated platelets or purified αIIbβ3 in a calcium-dependent manner (16D'Souza S.E. Ginsberg M.H. Matsueda G.R. Plow E.F. Nature. 1991; 350: 66-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). This implies that only a small portion of the integrin molecule is sufficient to bind its ligand. Recently, it has also been reported that analogous small sequences from the αL chain of LFA-1, the integrin receptor for ICAM-1, -2 and -3, cannot only directly bind to ICAM-1 but can inhibit T-cell binding to purified ICAM-1 (17Stanley P. Bates P.A. Harvey J. Bennett R.I. Hogg N. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1790-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). These sequences are also located in the putative cation binding regions. However, one of them is so weakly conserved compared with known functional cation binding motifs that it is not thought to bind cations, and the activity of neither peptide is reduced by chelating cations, unlike the analogous peptide of αIIb described above. A variety of epitope mapping studies, complemented by mutagenesis experiments, have indicated that the I domains from integrin αM (34Diamond M.S. Garcia-Aguilar J. Bickford J.K. Corbi A.L.

Consistent with this, isolated recombinant I domains from αM (39Randi A.M. Hogg N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12395-12398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Zhou L. Lee D.H. Plescia J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 26006-26010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) appear to mimic αMβ2 and α2β1 ligand binding activities. The integrin α4 lacks an I domain but contains typical consensus divalent cation repeats found in other α4 subunits. Consistent with results from other integrins, these divalent cation sites are important for 04-dependent cell adhesion, as determined from mutagenesis experiments (42Masumoto A. Hemler M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, our data suggest that an important additional site is contained within α4 region 1d, All mAbs that are potent inhibitors of ligand binding map to this 52-amino-acid section. Additionally, a region of lesser functional importance has been located within the most N-terminal 102 amino acids (represented by A epitope mAbs). The C epitope antibodies (represented by B5G10 and 8F2) are functionally important insofar as they can block homotypic aggregation. These have been mapped to an area distal to the cation binding sites. Consistent with these results, it was previously shown that neither the A, B, nor C epitopes were perturbed by mutations within the α4 divalent cation sites (42Masumoto A. Hemler M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation studies with α4 mAbs using Pronase proteolytic digestion of Ramos cells showed that epitopes A and B are much more rapidly lost from the cell surface than epitope C (19Pulido R. Campanero M.R. Garcia-Pardo A. Sanchez-Madrid F. FEBS Lett. 1991; 294: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). These data are entirely consistent with the epitope mapping studies described above and suggest that the most N-terminal region of the α4 chain is mobile and accessible and therefore both highly immunogenic and proteolytically susceptible, while other regions of the α4 chain, including those responsible for epitope C, are much less so. While integrin three-dimensional structure has not been well characterized, a scanning electron micrograph study revealed the shape of α5β1 to be that of two large globular domains a top two thinner stalks, which contain the transmembrane domains that tether the molecules to the cell surface (43Nermut M.V. Green N.M. Eason P. Yamada S.S. Yamada K.M. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 4093-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Taken jointly, the data suggest the structural features shown schematically in Fig. 1. Our study will help focus attention on the N-terminal region of the α4 chain, whose structure/function relationship can be further elucidated by mutagenesis, synthetic peptide analysis, and related approaches.

https://openalex.org/W2166025606,"The view that the life span of an organism is intrinsically limited and is largely species-specific necessarily involves certain notions of genetic elements of regulation. The term gerontogenes refers to any such genetic elements that are involved in the regulation of aging and life span. The existence of genes for programmed aging is generally discounted on the basis of evolutionary arguments against the notion of the adaptive nature of aging. It is suggested here that the concept of gerontogenes be linked with the idea of genes involved in homeostasis and longevity assurance, which is not contradictory to the nonadaptive nature of aging. Because these genes were not originally selected as real genes for aging, their involvement in aging is an emergent property making them virtual gerontogenes. Some experimental evidence is available that suggests that sets of genes involved in the maintenance and repair of various cellular functions are the primary candidates qualifying as virtual gerontogenes."
https://openalex.org/W2014571860,"Cell adhesion mediated by leukocyte integrin CR3 (CD11b/CD18, αmβ2) may be rapidly modulated without changes in receptor number, and transient changes in adhesivity are thought to be driven by reversible alteration of the affinity of CR3 for ligand. Here we measure the binding affinity of CR3 using purified active and inactive receptor and the ligand, C3bi, coupled to alkaline phosphatase. Immobilized, active CR3 bound saturably and with high affinity (12.5 ± 4.7 nM). In contrast, inactive CR3 exhibited no measurable binding. High affinity binding could be restored by the addition of the activating anti-CR3 monoclonal antibody KIM-127 to inactive CR3. Since the affinity of KIM-127 for active and inactive receptor was identical, it cannot contribute the energy to convert a low affinity receptor into a high affinity receptor. Rather, KIM-127 appears to facilitate binding of C3bi by lowering the activation energy for the shift from an inactive to an active state. These results suggest that CR3-mediated binding and detachment of cells is not driven by a reversible change in affinity but by two mechanistically distinct processes, an energetically neutral activation step for binding and an energy-dependent step that reverses binding of ligand.

The ability of CR3 to bind its ligands is low in resting cells, but it is transiently enabled by stimulation (Wright and Meyer, 1986Wright S.D. Meyer B.C. J.

For example, stimulation of PMN with phorbol ester causes a dramatic rise in adhesivity after 20 min and a return to base line by 40 min (Wright and Meyer, 1986Wright S.D. Meyer B.C. J. Immunol. 1986; 136: 1759-1764PubMed Google Scholar). Similar activation-dependent binding has also been found in several other integrins (Dustin and Springer, 1989Dustin M.L. Springer T.A.

Since changes in adhesivity may occur without a change in receptor number, the “affinity modulation model” has received a significant amount of study. In this model, the avidity of individual receptors is thought to shift reversibly from low to high. Shifting of the affinity to the high level allows adhesion, and shifting back to low affinity allows detachment. Reliable estimates of CR3 affinity, however, have not been made, and studies with other integrins have suggested that the affinity may be too low to measure readily (Horwitz et al., 1985Horwitz A. Duggan K. Greggs R. Decker C. Buck C. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 2134-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar; Lollo et al., 1993Lollo B.A. Chan K.W.H. Hanson E.M. Moy V.T. Brian A.A. J. Biol.

In the present study, we describe a novel, soluble, monomeric ligand for CR3 and an enzymatic microassay to study the affinity of individual receptors. Our data make the surprising finding that the affinity of CR3 for C3bi is very high. Moreover, inactive receptor exhibited a kinetic block in binding, not a change in binding energetics. The implications of these findings for the affinity modulation model are discussed.

Robinson (Celltech Ltd., United Kingdom). Anti-C3bi was from Quidel (San Diego, CA). Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG was from Bio-Rad. C3bi was conjugated to calf intestinal AP through a disulfide bridge. A sulfhydryl was first introduced into AP with the bifunctional cross-linker, SPDP. 2-Pyridyldisulfide-AP was prepared by incubating 5 mg of AP in 1 ml of PBS with 25 μl of 20 mM SPDP diluted in Me2SO. After a 30-min incubation at 37°C, excess cross-linker was removed with a NAP-25 (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology, Uppsala, Sweden) desalting column equilibrated with PBS, 1 mM EDTA. The extent of derivitization was measured using an molar extinction coefficient of 8.08 × 103M−1 cm−1 at 343 nm for released 2-pyridyldisulfide (Carlsson et al., 1978Carlsson J. Drevin H. Axen R. Biochem. J. 1978; 173: 723-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar) and was found to be 1.24 mol of 2-pyridyldisulfide/mol of AP. C3bi with a single free sulfhydryl was purified from normal human plasma by modifying the method reported by Ross et al., 1987Ross G.D. Cain J.A. Myones B.L. Newman S.L. Lachmann P.J. Complement. 1987; 4: 61-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar. Briefly, 50 ml of normal human plasma was treated with a final concentration of 20 mM iodoacetamide for 1 h at 37°C to block all free sulfhydryl groups. After extensive dialysis, the plasma was incubated with 2 g of activated thiol-Sepharose for 2 h at 37°C. The Sepharose activates the complement cascade, and because proteolytic activation of C3 leads to the liberation of a free sulfhydryl (Pangurn, 1986Pangurn M.K. Ross G.D. Immunobiology of the Complement System. Academic Press, New York1986: 45Crossref Google Scholar), the C3 is captured in disulfide linkage with the Sepharose. After thorough washing, C3bi was eluted with 10 mML-cysteine in 20 mM Tris, pH 7.4. C3bi was further purified with a Mono Q column eluted with a gradient (0-1 M) of NaCl in 20 mM Tris, 5 mM EDTA, 0.02% NaN3, pH 7.4. Purified C3bi was then mixed with equimolar 2-pyridyldisulfide-AP and rotated at room temperature for 24 h. Approximately 80% of C3bi became bound to AP. Conjugated and free proteins were separated with a Mono Q column eluted with a gradient (0-1 M) of NaCl in 20 mM Tris, 0.02% NaN3, pH 7.4, and results of conjugation were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 8-25% native gels (see Fig. 1). The presence of a single band of conjugate suggests stoichiometric coupling of C3bi and AP, and this inferrence is confirmed by the observation that the mobility of the conjugate is slower than either of the two reactants, and its RF is consistent with a 1:1 complex. The purity of the conjugate was also verified by immunoprecipitation. Incubation of conjugate with immobilized mAb against C3bi removed over 95% of AP activity, while with irrelevant mAb, AP in the supernatant remained unchanged (data not shown). CR3 was purified from PMN lysates by one of the following two methods. Pellets of PMN, prepared as described previously (Van Strijp et al., 1993Van Strijp J.A.G. Russel D.G. Tuomanen E. Brown E.J. Wright S.D. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 3324-3336PubMed Google Scholar), were lysed at 2 × 108 cells/ml with lysis buffer (100 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 0.02% NaN3, protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml each of antipain, benzamidine, chymostatin, leupeptin, and pepstatin, 0.24 units/ml aprotinin, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 mM pefablock)) for 1 h at 4°C with stirring. The lysate was then centrifuged at 35,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was passed over an IB4 (anti-CD18) immunoaffinity column that was prepared by coupling IB4 to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose. The column was prewashed with equilibration buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100). The column was loaded at 1 ml/min and sequentially washed with equilibration buffer and buffer composed of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 1% n-octyl β-D-glucopyranoside. CR3 was eluted with buffer containing 50 mM triethylamine, pH 11.0, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 1% n-octyl β-D-glucopyranoside into tubes with neutralizing buffer (15% by volume 1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). Aliquots were made and stored at −80°C. The purity of CR3 was analyzed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (4-15%) stained with silver. Strong bands corresponding to the α and β chain of CR3 were observed at 165 and 95 kDa, and the identity of α chain (165 kDa band) was confirmed with Western blot using polyclonal anti-CR3 (data not shown). Although PMN contain low amounts of CD11a/CD18 and CD11c/CD18, our preparation showed no CD11c and only a weak CD11a band (<5% of the density of the CD11b band). This preparation will bind C3bi and is referred to as “active” CR3. CR3 was purified on immobilized C3bi as described previously (Van Strijp et al., 1993Van Strijp J.A.G. Russel D.G. Tuomanen E. Brown E.J. Wright S.D. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 3324-3336PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, C3bi-coated Sepharose beads were prepared by incubating normal human plasma with Sepharose CL-4B-200 for 1 h at 37°C. The beads were incubated with PMN lysate for 20 min, and, after thorough washing, CR3 bound to C3bi-coated beads was eluted using 10 mM EDTA. Receptor isolated in this way fails to bind C3bi and is referred to as “inactive” CR3. To measure the binding of C3bi-AP to purified CR3, 72-well terasaki plates (Robbins Scientific, Mountain View, CA) were coated with 10 μl/well (~10 μg/ml) of purified CR3 diluted in PBS, 0.02% NaN3 for 2 h at 4°C. Wells were aspirated and then blocked with 10% dry milk diluted in PBS for 1 h at 4°C. After four washes with PBS, a total of 10 μl of C3bi-AP diluted in PBS with 0.1% of milk was added to each well. Plates were incubated at 37°C for 20 min, unless indicated otherwise. Following four washes with saline, 5 μl/well of a fluorogenic substrate for AP, Attophos, was added. The fluorescence signal generated at 21°C was detected at time intervals with a Cytofluor™ 2300 fluorescence plate reader (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The amount of C3bi-AP bound to CR3-coated plates was expressed as the change in arbitrary fluorescence units/time interval. The actual value of fmol of C3bi-AP bound per well was calculated from a standard curve relating enzyme activity to μg of conjugate. Each sample was assayed in triplicate. The method for quantitating the amount of CR3 bound to coated terasaki plates was as described previously (Van Strijp et al., 1993Van Strijp J.A.G. Russel D.G. Tuomanen E. Brown E.J. Wright S.D. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 3324-3336PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, CR3-coated plates were incubated with 125I-labeled mAb anti-CR3 (125I-44a, iodinated with Na125I by the Iodogen method (Fraker and Speck, 1978Fraker P.J. Speck J.C. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 80: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (3626) Google Scholar)) at 37°C for 60 min. After thorough washing, plates were dried. The amount of 125I-44a bound was determined by counting individual wells in a γ-counter. Results were expressed in cpm, and the actual value of fmol of 125I-44a bound per well was calculated from the specific activity of the 125I-44a. Protein concentration was determined by Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Richmond, CA). Bovine serum albumin was used as a standard. Data are presented as the mean of three wells ± S.D. of a representative experiment (n = 4). C3 binds covalently to surfaces through an ester link (Law and Levine, 1977Law S.K. Levine R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 2701-2705Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar; Law et al., 1979Law S.K. Lichtenberg N.A. Levine R.P. J. Immunol. 1979; 123: 1388-1394PubMed Google Scholar). In this process, an intrachain thiol ester in C3 undergoes a transesterification reaction yielding an ester link to a hydroxyl (or to water) and a free thiol (Abbas et al., 1991Abbas A.K. Lichtman A.H. Pober J.S. Cellular and Molecular Immunology. W. B. Saunders Company Press, Philadelphia, PA1991: 265Google Scholar). We have used this free thiol to conjugate alkaline phosphatase to C3bi. Since the free thiol residue of C3bi is only four amino acids away from the normal site of attachment to surfaces (Khan and Erickson, 1982Khan S.A. Erickson B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11864-11867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it represents a sterically favorable site to attach a bulky group. Analysis of the conjugate indicates that it is a soluble monomeric molecule with a 1:1 ratio between C3bi and AP (Fig. 1). We measured binding of C3bi-AP to purified CR3 by incubating C3bi-AP in plates coated with purified CR3. The CR3 used for this study was purified using mAb affinity chromatography, and this purification produces a population of receptors that avidly bind C3bi (see below). C3bi-AP bound to surfaces coated with CR3 but not to uncoated surfaces (Fig. 2A, first and lastcolumns). The CR3-dependent binding of C3bi-AP was completely inhibited by mAb IB4 (anti-CD18) and 44a or OKM1 (both anti-CD11b), while mAb W6/32 (anti-HLA class-1 antigen) and TS1/22 (anti-CD11a) were ineffective. The binding of C3bi-AP conjugates to CR3 was also dose-dependently blocked by unlabeled C3bi (Fig. 2B). C3bi-AP binds at least as avidly as unlabeled C3bi, and attachment of AP thus appears not to decrease the affinity of C3bi for CR3. Additional studies showed that unconjugated AP failed to bind to CR3, and the amount of C3bi-AP binding varied with the dose of CR3 used to coat the surfaces (data not shown). These studies established that C3bi-AP bound specifically to CR3. To determine the cation dependence of binding of C3bi-AP to CR3, binding studies were conducted in the presence of 1 mM each of Ca2+, Mg2+, and Mn2+ at 37°C for 20 min (Fig. 2C). Omission of divalent cations completely inhibited the binding of C3bi-AP to purified CR3. In the presence of 1 mM Ca2+ or Mg2+, binding was partially restored, but the most efficient binding was observed in the presence of Mn2+ or the combination of all three divalents. These results are consistent with our previous studies showing that binding of C3bi-coated particles to CR3 on cells (Wright and Silverstein, 1982Wright S.D. Silverstein S.C. J. Exp. Med. 1982; 156: 1149-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) and plastic (Van Strijp et al., 1993Van Strijp J.A.G. Russel D.G. Tuomanen E. Brown E.J. Wright S.D. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 3324-3336PubMed Google Scholar) is divalent cation-dependent and are also consistant with the known divalent cation binding properties of CR3 (Michishita et al., 1993Michishita M. Videm V. Arnaout M.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 857-867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that binding of C3bi-coated erythrocytes to CR3-bearing cells (Wright and Jong, 1986Wright S.D. Jong M.T.C. J. Exp. Med. 1986; 164: 1876-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) or CR3-bearing plastic surfaces (Van Strijp et al., 1993Van Strijp J.A.G. Russel D.G. Tuomanen E. Brown E.J. Wright S.D. J.

To determine if this temperature dependence was a property of CR3 or the C3bi-coated erythrocytes, binding of C3bi-AP to CR3 coated plates was studied at various temperatures with 1 mM each of Ca2+ and Mg2+. The rate of binding of C3bi-AP to CR3 was greatest at 37°C, but was nearly absent when the temperature was lowered to 17°C (Fig. 3A) and could not be observed at 0°C (data not shown). The strong temperature dependence thus suggests a high activation energy for the reaction between C3bi and CR3. Arrhenius analysis of the data in Fig. 3A yielded an activation energy (Ea) of 15 ± 2 kcal/mol (Fig. 3B). The specificity, divalent cation, and temperature dependence for C3bi-AP binding to CR3-coated plates indicated that the soluble monomeric probe, C3bi-AP, had binding properties identical to those of immobilized C3bi (Wright and Silverstein, 1982Wright S.D. Silverstein S.C. J. Exp. Med. 1982; 156: 1149-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar; Van Strijp et al., 1993Van Strijp J.A.G. Russel D.G. Tuomanen E. Brown E.J. Wright S.D. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 3324-3336PubMed Google Scholar). We may thus use soluble C3bi-AP to estimate the binding constant of CR3 for C3bi. To ensure the accuracy of our estimation, the kinetics of C3bi binding to CR3 were first studied by incubating 12 nM C3bi-AP with CR3-coated plates for increasing times. Binding was time-dependent with an association rate (kon) of ~6 × 105M−1min−1 (Fig. 4). Binding reached steady state at 60 min. To measure the affinity of CR3 for C3bi, increasing concentrations of C3bi-AP were incubated with plates coated with or without CR3 for 60 min at 37°C. Binding of C3bi-AP to CR3 was dose-dependent and saturable (Fig. 5A). For affinity estimation, values from plates without CR3 coating were treated as nonspecific binding and were subtracted to yield specific binding. Nearly identical nonspecific values were obtained when excess unlabeled C3bi or mAb anti-CR3 was used for competing the specific binding of C3bi-AP to CR3-coated plates (data not shown). Scatchard analysis (Fig. 5 B) revealed a Kd of 12.5 ± 4.7 nM. The binding of C3bi-AP to CR3 appears to occur in a 1:1 ratio. When 50 nM C3bi-AP (a saturating concentration) was incubated with CR3-coated plates for 60 min, the amount of C3bi-AP bound to CR3 was estimated to be 7 fmol/well, while the number of CR3 molecules coated on the plate was 10 fmol/well as determined by 125I-labeled anti-CR3 (125I-44a) (data not shown). Cells may express CR3 that is active or inactive in mediating cell adhesion (Wright and Meyer, 1986Wright S.D. Meyer B.C. J. Immunol. 1986; 136: 1759-1764PubMed Google Scholar; Diamond and Springer, 1993Diamond M.S. Springer T.A. J.

The CR3 used in the above studies was isolated by method using mAb affinity chromatography that yielded constitutively active receptors, and this activity was demonstrated here by the avid binding of C3bi-AP (Fig. 5A). We have previously described a method for purification of inactive CR3 using affinity chromatography on C3bi-Sepharose (Van Strijp et al., 1993Van Strijp J.A.G. Russel D.G. Tuomanen E. Brown E.J. Wright S.D. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 3324-3336PubMed Google Scholar). This procedure yields receptor that neither binds C3bi-coated particles (Hermanowski-Vosatka et al., 1992Hermanowski-Vosatka A.

Wright, unpublished observations. a monoclonal antibody that detects an activation epitope of CR3 (Diamond and Springer, 1993Diamond M.S. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 545-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Studies using this inactive receptor preparation showed that 12 nM C3bi-AP failed to bind above background (Fig. 6, firstcolumn). Similar results were obtained in experiments using higher concentrations of C3bi-AP (100 nM) or incubations as long as 18 h (data not shown). These findings indicate that inactive CR3 either fails to bind C3bi or binds with a very low affinity. To verify that our inactive CR3 is functional and capable of being activated, we employed the monoclonal antibody KIM-127. This antibody against CD18 strongly increases CR3-mediated PMN adhesion to protein-coated surfaces without influencing the expression of β2 integrin (Robinson et al., 1992Robinson M.K. Andrew D. Rosen H. Brown D. Ortlepp S. Stephens P. Butcher E.C. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 1080-1085PubMed Google Scholar), a result we have confirmed (data not shown). To determine if the effects of KIM-127 are caused by direct action of the antibody on the receptor, plates coated with inactive CR3 were incubated with C3bi-AP in the presence or absence of KIM-127. The addition of KIM-127 led to strong binding of C3bi-AP. The binding enabled by KIM-127 was totally blocked by mAb IB4 (anti-CD18) (Fig. 6). This finding indicates that our inactive CR3 retained the capacity to bind C3bi, and that KIM-127 acted directly on CR3 to change its binding properties. The ability of KIM-127 to enhance binding of C3bi-AP to inactive CR3 was dose-dependent, with a maximal effect at ~1 nM (data not shown). The curve for enhanced binding of C3bi-AP to CR3 closely matched the curve for binding of KIM-127 to CR3 (see Fig. 7 below). Results from the above experiments indicate that the capacity of inactive CR3 to bind monomeric ligand may be dramatically altered by changes, presumably conformational in nature, induced by binding of KIM-127. Equilibrium measurement of the binding in the presence of 10 μg/ml of KIM-127 yielded Kd = 15.9 ± 3.4 nM. This value is not significantly different from the Kd of active CR3 in the absence of KIM-127 (12.5 ± 4.7 nM). This result suggests that KIM-127 does not influence the energetics of the interaction of CR3 and C3bi. To further ask if KIM-127 alters the affinity of active receptors, increasing concentrations of C3bi-AP were incubated with plates coated with an active CR3 preparation in the presence or absence of KIM-127, and binding was measured (Fig. 7). The addition of KIM-127 to CR3-coated plates increased the number of binding sites for C3bi-AP to CR3, but the shape of the binding curve indicated a single population of CR3 with similar affinity in all cases. Further studies showed identical temperature dependence of binding in the presence and absence of KIM-127 (data not shown). These observations suggest first that the active CR3 preparation contains two populations, a population of active receptors that bind C3bi, and an inactive population that only binds after treatment with KIM-127. In four experiments, the increase in C3bi binding sites caused by KIM-127 varied from 30 to 100%, suggesting that 15-50% of the receptors in this preparation were inactive but susceptible to activation by KIM-127. More importantly, the results suggest that KIM-127 does not modulate the binding affinity of CR3 for C3bi. It is either high (12 × 16 nM) or unmeasurable, with no middle value. Inactive CR3 has unmeasurable affinity for C3bi, while the active receptor has an affinity of 12 nM, a change consonant with a ΔG0 of approximately −11 kcal/mol. To test the hypothesis that KIM-127 contributes this energy, we measured the binding affinity of KIM-127 for active and inactive CR3. The affinities, roughly estimated from concentrations for half-maximal binding, were practically identical (~1 nM) for active and inactive CR3 (Fig. 8). If KIM-127 contributed the 11 kcal/mol needed for binding, its affinity would change from ~1 nM for the active receptor to ~80 mM for the inactive receptor. This large change would have been easily observed in our studies. Additional studies showed that ligation of CR3 with C3bi also had no effect on the binding of KIM-127 (not shown). These results suggests that KIM-127 affects binding of C3bi to CR3 without contributing to the energetics of binding. To determine the binding properties of leukocyte integrin CR3, we developed a novel, soluble, monomeric probe, C3bi-AP, and a binding assay using purified immobilized CR3. Our procedures obviate problems such as pinocytic uptake and degradation of ligand that are inherent in cell-based assays, especially with interactions that require warm temperatures. They further obviate problems inherent in measurements of multimeric ligands and yield the first equilibrium measurements on CR3 suitable for rigorous quantitative analysis. Using these reagents, we determined that the stoichiometry of the binding of C3bi to CR3 is 1:1, that binding shows an absolute requirement for divalent cations, and that binding is of high affinity. Previous work has shown that CR3 can be isolated in a form that is capable (Diamond et al., 1990Diamond M.S. Staunton D.E. de Fougerolles A.R. Stacker S.A. Garcia-Aguilar J. Hibbs M.L. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 3129-3139Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar) or incapable (Van Strijp et al., 1993Van Strijp J.A.G. Russel D.G. Tuomanen E. Brown E.J. Wright S.D. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 3324-3336PubMed Google Scholar) of binding multimeric ligand, and we confirmed these findings here using our monomeric probe. We further showed that addition of mAb KIM-127 to purified CR3 caused a shift from an inactive to an active state. This result indicates that KIM-127 acts directly on CR3 to enable its ligand binding properties. Importantly, KIM-127-induced binding exhibited an affinity for C3bi that is identical with the affinity for active receptor preparation, suggesting that the site exposed by this mAb is similar to that exposed during activation of receptors by physiological stimuli. KIM-127 could enable binding either by contributing sufficient energy to change receptor affinity or by lowering the activation energy required for binding. Studies reported here suggest that KIM-127 does not modulate affinity. If KIM-127 drove a conformational change that raised the affinity of the C3bi binding site, then the binding energy for C3bi conferred by binding of mAb would be balanced by a decrease in the binding energy for KIM-127. Such reciprocal changes in binding energy are observed in allosteric proteins (e.g. hemoglobin) for ligands (e.g. 2,3-diphosphoglycerate and O2 (Kilmartin, 1976Kilmartin J.V. Br. Med. Bull. 1976; 32: 209-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar)). To determine if KIM-127 makes such an energetic contribution, we measured its affinity for both active and inactive receptors. No difference in affinity was observed (Fig. 8). It is thus clear that KIM-127 mediates alterations in binding activity without significant energy input, and we may draw active CR3 and inactive CR3 at equivalent positions on an energy diagram (Fig. 9). An important consequence of the above finding is that cells may alter the binding properties of CR3 without a need for transmitting a large amount of energy from the cytoplasmic side of the membrane to the exoplasmic surface. Indeed, it is difficult to imagine a propagated conformational change carried by the two membrane-spanning peptides of CR3 delivering an energetically large signal to the exoplasmic domain. While the shift from inactive to active receptor is energetically neutral, the transition appears to have a very high activation energy since it does not occur to a significant degree during a prolonged incubation (18 h, 37°C) in the presence of ligand. Under these conditions, binding of ligand would be expected to “trap” any receptor that may become active during the incubation. We have thus drawn a high activation energy profile for the transition from inactive to active CR3 and have depicted KIM127 as lowering this barrier (Fig. 9). The action of KIM-127 thus resembles that of a catalyst and could be mediated by exposure of a physically hidden binding site for C3bi. The most surprising finding of the study is that the binding affinity of CR3 for C3bi is very high (Kd ~ 10−8 M). We further showed that the activation energy for binding is also high (Ea ~ 15 kcal/mol), and we may thus draw the energy diagram in Fig. 9. Several conclusions derive from this rendering of binding energetics. The first is that, while switching from inactive to active receptors is energetically neutral, removal of ligand bound to receptor is energetically expensive. A consequence of this is that spontaneous disassociation of ligand from receptor will be slow. From the on rate (Fig. 4) and the affinity (Fig. 5), we calculate that more than 20 min is required for spontaneous disassociation of one-half of the ligand, and preliminary studies of the disassociation of C3bi-AP in the presence of excess unlabeled C3bi are consistent with this estimate (not shown). The slow spontaneous disassociation of ligand from CR3 stands in contrast with the observation that during chemotaxis of PMN, CR3 may bind substrate-bound ligand and release the ligand in less than 1 min (Nahas et al., 1971Nahas G.G. Tannieres M.L. Lennon J.F. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1971; 138: 350-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We have also observed that C5a-stimulated PMN may bind to endothelial cells via CR3 and may fully detach within 7 min (Lo et al., 1989bLo S.K. Detmers P.A. Levin S.M. Wright S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 169: 1779-1793Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), that C5a-stimulated PMN may bind C3bi-coated erythrocytes and release the erythrocytes within 5 min,3 3S. D. Wright, unpublished observations. and that PMN bind C3bi-coated epithelial monolayers via CR3 but promptly detach upon stimulation (Cramer et al., 1986Cramer E.B. Milks L.C. Brontoli M.J. Ojakian G.K. Wright S.D. Showell H.J. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1868-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that detachment of PMN from a ligand-coated surface is not likely to be caused by spontaneous release of ligand from CR3 and is likely to require an energy-dependent step. The above studies necessitate a revision of current thinking regarding control of integrin-mediated cell adhesion. The widely held affinity modulation model calls for increases in integrin affinity to enable cell adhesion and for a reversal of this process to cause detachment. Data in this paper suggest that neither of the two propositions of this model are tenable. Studies with our model system show that the activation of receptors does not result from changes in affinity of CR3 but from a change in the activation energy for shifting receptor from inactive to active state. A second revision concerns the mechanism by which adhesion is reversed. Since our data indicate that release of bound ligand requires significant energy input, cell detachment must involve a process mechanistically distinct from receptor activation and cannot result from a reversal of receptor activation. One potential mechanism for reversing adhesion may involve removal of divalents, since divalent cations are required for binding of C3bi-AP to CR3 (Fig. 2C) and removal of divalent cations reverses binding.4 4T. Q. Cai and S. D. Wright, unpublished observations. An alternative mechanism to reverse binding could involve proteolytic degradation of the receptor or ligand. The nature of the process by which ligand is removed from receptor is currently under study. The final observation derived from Fig. 9 is that receptors might be incapable of binding ligand and mediating adhesion for two distinct reasons. They may be in the inactive state or in a ligand-occupied state. Experiments are currently ongoing to determine the state of receptors on living PMN. We thank D. S.

HRV-14 viral RNA is 7,208 nucleotides in length and is composed of a 5′-noncoding region (5′-NCR) of 624 nucleotides, a continuous open reading frame of 6,537 nucleotides, and a 3′-NCR of 47 nucleotides(6Stanway G. Hughes P.J. Mountford R.C. Minor P.D. Almond J.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7859-7875Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The 5′-terminal ≈100 nucleotides of the long picornavirus 5′-NCR are essential for viral RNA replication, and much of the remainder of the 5′-NCR promotes cap-independent initiation of translation(7Andino R. Rieckhof G.E. Baltimore D. Cell. 1990; 63: 369-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 8Andino R. Rieckhof G.E. Trono D. Baltimore D. J.

Rieckhof G.E. Trono D. Baltimore D. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 607-612Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A second function of 3Cpro was revealed when poliovirus 3Cpro, either as mature 3Cpro or in the form of the precursor polypeptide 3CD, was able to interact specifically with the 5′-terminal 90 nucleotides of the poliovirus plus strand 5′-NCR(7Andino R. Rieckhof G.E. Baltimore D. Cell. 1990; 63: 369-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Poliovirus 3Cpro, or more likely 3CD, together with a ≈36-kDa host protein formed a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex with the 5′-terminal 90 nucleotides of poliovirus RNA folded into a cloverleaf-like structure(7Andino R.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3587-3598Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). As the RNP complex was shown to be essential for virus RNA replication, a model was proposed in which the complex catalyzes and initiates new viral plus strands in trans on a minus strand RNA template (9Andino R. Rieckhof G.E. Achacoso P.L. Baltimore D. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3587-3598Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). A separate study showed that mutations in the 82-87 region of PV 3Cpro destroyed virus viability without affecting maturation cleavages, further indicating that 3Cpro has a nonproteolytic function(13Hämmerle T. Molla A. Wimmer E. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6028-6034Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In a different approach, purified recombinant HRV-14 3Cpro bound efficiently and specifically to the 5′-terminal 126 nucleotides of HRV-14 plus strand viral RNA in vitro, demonstrating conclusively that 3Cpro alone bound to RNA (14Leong L.E.C. Walker P.A. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25735-25739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and suggesting that in the case of poliovirus the binding of 3CD to the 5′-NCR was mediated by 3Cpro(7Andino R. Rieckhof G.E. Baltimore D. Cell. 1990; 63: 369-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar).Here we show that, together with complementary studies with poliovirus 3Cpro, there are at least two regions in 3Cpro distinct from the catalytic triad which are essential for its binding to the picornavirus 5′-NCR. These regions together define a putative RNA binding site in the recently solved three-dimensional structure of HRV-14 3Cpro(15Matthews D.A. Smith W.W. Ferre R.A. Condon B. Budahazi G. Sisson W.

One of these regions is well conserved among diverse picornaviruses, and we suggest it contains a potential RNA binding motif. We also show that a short base-paired stem-loop structure near the 5′ terminus of HRV-14 viral RNA is necessary and sufficient for binding to 3Cpro.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsThe Escherichia coli strain JM109 was used for all cloning and expression work.

Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25735-25739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was the template for cloning by PCR of all the truncated 5′-NCR fragments of HRV-14 virus RNA. Five new truncated 5′-NCRs coding for the phage T7 promoter and nucleotides 1-65, 1-72, 1-81, 1-90, or 1-98 at the 5′ terminus of HRV-14 virus RNA were amplified by PCR from plasmid pLJ5NCR1 (14Leong L.E.C. Walker P.A. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25735-25739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). These PCR products were first cloned into plasmid pGEM-T to verify their DNA sequences and, except for clone H (nucleotides 46-72; see below and Fig. 3), were digested with BamHI and SphI, then subcloned into BamHI/SphI-digested pUC18 vector. Following linearization of each plasmid with AflII upstream of the SphI site, run-off transcripts were synthesized using the T7 Riboprobe Gemini II transcription kit either using unlabeled ribonucleoside triphosphates as described by the manufacturer (Promega Corp.) or 50 μCi of [α-33P]UTP to radiolabel the RNA. The 1-47 RNA (clone G) was transcribed from pLJ5NCR1 after restriction with ScaI(14Leong L.E.C. Walker P.A. Porter A.G. J. Biol.

Mutants of stem-loop d (Fig. 5) were generated by PCR exactly as for the 72 RNA (see above) except that downstream primers of increasing length incorporated the appropriate nucleotide substitutions, and the downstream restriction site was EcoRI (not SphI).Figure 5:Mutagenesis of stem-loop d in the 72 RNA.

Additional sequences were added to each oligonucleotide primer to allow cloning of the PCR-amplified fragment downstream of the T7 promoter in HindIII- and EcoRI-digested plasmid pGEM 4Z. The resultant plasmid, PV90, was linearized with EcoRI to generate a template suitable for transcription of the PV 5′-NCR using T7 RNA polymerase.RNA Electrophoretic Mobility (Band Shift) AssayThe procedure used to detect the RNP complexes between 3Cpro (or 3Cpro mutants) and in vitro transcribed RNAs has been described previously(14Leong L.E.C.

Briefly, 1 μl of run-off RNA transcript (~0.25 ng of RNA) was incubated with 5 μg of parental or mutant 3Cpro at 25°C for 15 min in 15 μl of buffer containing 3 mM spermidine, 30 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The RNP complexes were separated from free RNA by nondenaturing PAGE (5% polyacrylamide gel) at 10 V/cm for 5 h. The gel was dried and autoradiographed. In competition experiments with unlabeled RNAs, the standard binding reaction was performed as above, then various amounts of unlabeled RNAs were introduced (see legend to Fig. 8 for details) and the incubation was continued at 25°C for 10 min before polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.Figure 8:Binding of HRV-14 3Cpro to 5′-terminal 90 nucleotides of poliovirus 5′-NCR.

Changes in the 82 to 86 region of HRV-14 3Cpro were chosen, since certain amino acid substitutions in the homologous region of PV 3Cpro reduced virus viability without affecting the proteolytic activity of 3Cpro(13Hämmerle T. Molla A. Wimmer E. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6028-6034Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We reasoned that RNA binding activity might be impaired in these PV mutants(13Hämmerle T. Molla A. Wimmer E. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6028-6034Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The “TGK” region (amino acids 153-155) of HRV-14 3Cpro was chosen (Table I) as mutations in the corresponding TGK region of PV 3Cpro were able to rescue a lethal insertion in the 5′-NCR (8Andino R. Rieckhof G.E. Trono D. Baltimore D. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 607-612Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), implying an involvement of TGK in RNA binding.Table IAmino acid substitutions in 3Cpro and their effects on proteolysis and RNA bindingTable IAmino acid substitutions in 3Cpro and their effects on proteolysis and RNA bindingThe mutant 3C proteases with single amino acid substitutions, K82Q, R84Q, R84K, I86A, T153S, G154A, and K155Q were all purified to near-homogeneity from glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins following thrombin cleavage (Fig. 1A). All the proteins were assayed for proteolytic activity with a synthetic peptide corresponding to the in vivo sequence between HRV-14 viral polypeptides 2C and 3A (14Leong L.E.C. Walker P.A. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25735-25739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Leong L.E.-C. Walker P.A. Porter A.G. J. Crystal Growth. 1992; 122: 246-252Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The results, summarized in Table I, demonstrate that the catalytic activity of none of these mutants was impaired in a 2-h assay, although a significant reduction in proteolytic activity of the I86A mutant was observed in the 30-min assay (Table I). In contrast, unlike parental 3Cpro, all seven mutants with the possible exception of the R84K mutant 3Cpro were unable to form a detectable RNP complex with the 126 RNA derived from the 5′-NCR (Fig. 1B and Table I). The highly conservative R84K substitution in 3Cpro gave a mutant which bound weakly with <10% of the efficiency of parental 3Cpro, but the R84Q mutant failed to bind detectably to 126 RNA (Fig. 1B). These results, which are very similar to those we previously reported for the D85E and D85N mutants of HRV-14 3Cpro(14Leong L.E.C. Walker P.A. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25735-25739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggest that amino acids 82-86 and 153-155 are very important for binding of 3Cpro to the 5′-NCR, but are not essential for its catalytic (proteolytic) activity.Figure 1:Purification and RNA binding activity of 3Cpro mutants.

To delineate the region(s) in the predicted HRV-14 5′-terminal cloverleaf (Fig. 2A) directly involved in the formation of the RNP complex with 3Cpro, a series of truncated 5′-NCRs was constructed. Deletions were made progessively from the 3′-end of the 5′-terminal 126 nucleotide segment of HRV-14 viral RNA (the 126 RNA), since it had previously been shown that nucleotides 1-126, but not nucleotides 1-47, bind to 3Cpro(14Leong L.E.C. Walker P.A. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25735-25739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The exact position of each 3′-nucleotide (Fig. 3) was carefully chosen to minimize disruption to the predicted cloverleaf fold of the RNA (Fig. 2A).Figure 2:Schematic representations of 5′-terminal regions of HRV-14 and PV RNAs.

Note that all transcripts comprising nucleotides 1 to 72 or larger retained stem-loops b, c, and d (Fig. 3). These RNAs were synthesized in vitro, and their binding to HRV-14 3Cpro was compared with the binding of the 126 and 47 RNAs. Fig. 4, A and B, shows that the 98 RNA, 90 RNA, 81 RNA, and 72 RNA bound to 3Cpro as efficiently as the 126 RNA, but the 65 RNA (like the 47 RNA) failed to bind to 3Cpro. Thus, the deletion of only 7 nucleotides from the 3′-end of the 72 RNA leads to a complete loss of 3Cpro binding (Fig. 3, compare E and F). To test the specificity of the RNP complexes formed between 3Cpro and the truncated RNAs, competition experiments were performed using excess unlabeled 72 RNA or 65 RNA. A ~300- to 500-fold molar excess of 72 RNA completely prevented complex formation between the 98 RNA, 90 RNA, 81 RNA, or the 72 RNA and 3Cpro, whereas a similar molar excess of the 65 RNA did not prevent complex formation (data not shown).Figure 4:Binding of 3Cpro to truncated 5′-terminal fragments of HRV-14 RNA.

The 65 RNA is predicted to have a new stem-loop which does not, however, bear any resemblance to stem-loop d in the sequence of either the stem or the loop (Fig. 3F). This is a clear indication that stem-loop d contains determinants of 3Cpro binding.Ribonucleoprotein Complex Formation with 3Cpro and Stem-Loop dA RNA transcript comprising nucleotides 46 to 72 (Fig. 2A) corresponding to the majority of the stem-loop d region of the 5′-NCR (Fig. 3H) was synthesized and shown to bind 3Cpro as efficiently as the 126 RNA (Fig. 4B, compare lanes 7 and 8). When the mobilities in polyacrylamide of all the RNP complexes were compared (Fig. 4), it is clear that the RNP complex containing only stem-loop d was retarded the most (Fig. 4B, lane 8), despite the fact that stem-loop d was the smallest RNA tested (lane 7). We do not have an explanation for this surprising result.In Vitro Mutagenesis of Stem-Loop din the 72 RNAA variety of double and multiple nucleotide substitutions were engineered into stem-loop d within the 72 RNA (Fig. 5) in order to assess their participation in RNP complex formation (Fig. 6). The choice of substitutions was limited by the need to minimize disruption to the predicted cloverleaf structure in the 72 RNA (Fig. 3E), so that as far as possible the contributions of individual unpaired or base-paired nucleotides could be evaluated. Each set of mutations was designed to test the contribution to binding of the two stem regions d1 and d2, the central bulge, and the top loop (Fig. 5). Replacement of the sequence UAU in the top loop with AUA (Fig. 5A) or GGG (data not shown) and mutagenizing or “closing” the central bulge (Fig. 5, A and B) did not affect complex formation (Fig. 6). Similarly, replacement of a T:A with a C:G base pair in stem d2 (Fig. 5A) was totally without effect on RNP complex formation (Fig. 6). In contrast, more drastic changes to stems d1 or d2, such as eradication of stem d2 or conversion of the two A:U base pairs to G:C base pairs in stem d1 (Fig. 5, C and D) abolished or significantly impaired 3Cpro binding (Fig. 6).Figure 6:Binding of 3Cpro to mutant 72 RNAs detected by RNA band shift analysis.

INTRODUCTIONCalcium is an element that is essential in the regulation of a great variety of biological processes. The metal is abundant in extracellular fluids. In blood plasma, calcium is present at concentrations of 2.2-2.6 mM (1.1-1.3 mM as free ions)(Paterson, 1983Paterson C.R. Essentials of Human Biochemistry. Churchill Livingstone, Edinburgh1983: 237-248Google Scholar), and it plays an obligatory role in hemostasis. Calcium ions bind to a number of coagulation proteins and modulate their functions. Almost all the steps in blood coagulation require Ca2+ ions, and chelating agents such as EDTA and citrate are very effective anticoagulants. Among the various proteins that participate in coagulation, vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors show strong dependence on Ca2+ ions for maintenance of their functional conformation (for reviews, see Refs. Furie and Furie, 1988Furie B. Furie B.C. Cell. 1988; 53: 505-518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar and Mann et al., 1990Mann K.G. Nesheim M.E. Church W.R. Haley P. Krishnaswamy S. Blood. 1990; 76: 1-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Each factor binds about 10 Ca2+ ions at the N-terminal Gla domain, and Gla-independent Ca2+-binding sites have also been identified in some of these factors. These various proteins, namely prothrombin and factors VII, IX and X, and also the anticoagulant protein C, are synthesized as zymogens and are converted to active proteases via limited proteolysis catalyzed by specific activators. Each activated protease in turn activates another factor, constituting the cascade of coagulation. The protein conformations with bound Ca2+ ions are essential for recognition by the respective activators. Moreover, the binding of these factors to procoagulant membranes rich in anionic phospholipids (e.g. the surface of activated platelets), which allows condensation of both activator and substrate at one site and thereby facilitates efficient activation, is also a Ca2+-dependent process.Another alkaline-earth metal, magnesium, is also abundant in blood plasma (0.4-0.6 mM as free ions)(Paterson, 1983Paterson C.R. Essentials of Human Biochemistry. Churchill Livingstone, Edinburgh1983: 237-248Google Scholar). While we know much about the role of Ca2+ ions, the involvement of Mg2+ ions in hemostasis has been poorly understood. Various polyvalent metal ions including Mg2+ ions have been shown to interact with the Ca2+-binding sites in Gla domains of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors (e.g. Refs. Bloom and Mann, 1978Bloom J.W. Mann K.G. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4430-4438Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, Sperling et al., 1978Sperling R. Furie B.C. Blumenstein M. Keyt B. Furie B. J.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3449-3456Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). According to previous studies, however, the affinity of Mg2+ ions for these proteins is relatively weak and, so far as is known to date, Mg2+ ions cannot be replaced Ca2+ ions for the expression of biological activity. In 1980, Byrne et al.(Byrne et al., 1980Byrne R. Amphlett G.W. Castellino F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 1430-1435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that activation of factor IX by factor XIa was accelerated to some extent by the addition of Mg2+ ions in the presence of a suboptimal concentration of Ca2+ ions (1.25 mM). However, since only limited information about the structure of factor IX was available, the underlying molecular mechanism of this phenomenon was hard to explain at that time. Furthermore, the concentration of factor IX employed in that report was far beyond the physiological range and, therefore, it was unclear whether the observed phenomenon was physiologically meaningful. In the mid-1980s, Furie and co-workers (9-12) proposed the hypothesis that vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors undergo two sequential conformational changes upon binding to metal ions on the basis of observations with conformation-specific antibodies as structural probes. Their scheme can be summarized as follows: P → P′ → P∗. In this model, metal ions other than Ca2+ ions (e.g. Mg2+ ions) can elicit only a partial transition, from the metal-free form of the protein (P) to an intermediate form (P′) that is insufficient for the expression of biological activity. Transition to a final functional form (P∗) is accomplished only by Ca2+ ions at physiological concentrations. The consequences of this model are simple: only Ca2+ ions are essential, and other cations are unnecessary for the regulation of the conformation and function of the coagulation factors. By contrast, we show in the present report that the Mg2+ ion is another regulator of both the structure and the function of factor IX, which is crucial for normal hemostasis.We previously isolated a novel type of anticoagulant protein that binds to the Gla domains of factors IX and X in a Ca2+-dependent fashion from snake venom(Atoda and Morita, 1989Atoda H. Morita T. J. Biochem. 1989; 106: 808-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, Atoda et al., 1994Atoda H. Yoshida N. Ishikawa M. Morita T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 703-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and we have recently found that this protein, designated IX/X-bp, recognizes the Ca2+-bound conformation of the Gla domains.1 1F. Sekiya, T. Yamashita, and T. Morita, submitted for publication. In this report, we now show that binding of IX/X-bp to factor IX, but not to factor X, is greatly augmented by physiological concentrations of Mg2+ ions when added together with Ca2+ ions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that not only Ca2+ ions but also Mg2+ ions are important for stabilization of the conformation as well as for expression of the biological activity of factor IX. Our discoveries highlight a novel physiological role of Mg2+ ions in hemostasis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProteinsThe following proteins were prepared by published methods; IX/X-bp(Atoda and Morita, 1989Atoda H. Morita T. J. Biochem. 1989; 106: 808-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), bovine factors IX and X(Hashimoto et al., 1985Hashimoto N. Morita T. Iwanaga S. J.

Biochem. 1980; 105: 340-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and human factor IXaβ(Morita and Kisiel, 1985Morita T. Kisiel W. Biochem Biophys, Res. Commun. 1985; 130: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). All of the preparations were homogeneous as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.Human factor XIa was prepared using immunoaffinity chromatography by a modification of the method of isolation of the zymogen(Komiyama et al., 1988Komiyama Y.

In brief, factor XI was activated by incubating 1 liter of plasma, anticoagulated with acid-citrate dextrose, with 25 g of Celite (Hyflo-super-cel; Wako Pure Chemicals, Osaka, Japan) at 37°C for 10 min. Factor XIa absorbed to the Celite was eluted by stirring the filter cake in 100 ml of 20 mM Tris-HCl, 1.5 M NaCl, pH 7.5, for 18 h at ambient temperature. The eluate was passed through a column of soybean trypsin inhibitor-Sepharose to remove factor XIIa, after dialysis against 20 mM Tris-HCl, 140 mM NaCl, pH 7.5 (TBS).2 2The abbreviations used are: TBSTris-buffered salineBSAbovine serum albuminELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The unbound fraction was then applied to a column of immobilized monoclonal antibody against human factor XI (KMXI-1; Ref. Komiyama et al., 1989Komiyama Y. Masuda M. Murakami T. Egawa H. Nishikado H. Murata K. Thrombos. Res. 1989; 55: 527-536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Factor XIa was eluted with 0.02% NH4OH, 0.15 M NaCl, pH 11. Trace amounts of high molecular weight contaminants were removed by gel filtration.Binding of 125I-IX/X-bpIX/X-bp was labeled with Na125I (Du Pont NEN) by use of IODOBEADS (Pierce) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. The specific activity of the labeled protein was in the range of 1.0-2.0 × 106 cpm/μg. Binding assays were conducted as follows. Wells of breakable microtiter plates (Labsystems, Finland) were coated with a solution of 10 μg/ml factor IX or X in 50 μl of TBS at 4°C overnight, and the remaining nonspecific binding sites were blocked by incubation with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA, essentially fatty acid-free; Sigma) in TBS for 1 h. Each well was incubated with approximately 50,000 cpm of 125I-IX/X-bp (approximately 0.5 μg/ml) in 50 μl of TBS containing 1 mg/ml BSA and appropriate concentrations of Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions for 30 min at 37°C. Wells were then washed twice with 200 μl of TBS plus metal ions at the same concentrations as those used for the incubation, cut into pieces, and counted for bound radioactivity in a γ counter. Magnesium ions were added as magnesium acetate, and acetate ions added as sodium acetate had no effect on the binding.Equilibrium DialysisThis was conducted at ambient temperature in a microvolume dialyzer with 250-μl cells (Hoffer Scientific Instrument, San Francisco, CA). Dialysis membranes were pretreated with a boiled solution of 0.1 M NaHCO3, 2% EDTA and washed extensively with metal-free water prior to use. A 200-μl aliquot of a TBS solution of CaCl2 containing 45CaCl2 as a tracer (1,000,000 dpm/cell; Du Pont NEN) was dialyzed against 200 μl of 40 μM IX/X-bp in TBS for 20 h with constant rotation. Protein-bound Ca2+ was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. In order to negate effects of possible contamination by metal ions, the buffer used was passed through a column of Chelex 100 (Bio-Rad) and the protein solution was dialyzed against a suspension of Chelex 100 (1 g/liter) in the buffer.Polyclonal AntibodiesAntisera against bovine factor IX were raised in rabbits by immunizing them with the pure protein. Conformation-specific antibodies were prepared essentially by the method of Liebman et al.(Liebman et al., 1987Liebman H.A. Furie B.C. Furie B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7605-7612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, a pool of polyclonal antibodies was loaded onto an affinity gel of immobilized bovine factor IX which had been equilibrated with a buffer containing Ca2+ ions. Anti-factor IX:Ca(II) antibodies,3 3Terminology of the conformation-specific antibodies follows the original description (Liebman et al., 1987Liebman H.A. Furie B.C. Furie B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7605-7612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). which recognized factor IX with an absolute requirement for Ca2+ ions, were eluted by changing the buffer to that containing Mg2+ ions and no Ca2+ ions. Anti-factor IX:Mg(II) antibodies, which recognized factor IX in the presence of various polyvalent metal ions including Mg2+, and metal-independent antibodies were obtained by elution with buffers containing EDTA and guanidine hydrochloride, respectively. Conformation-specific antibodies against other coagulation factors were also prepared by the same method. The nature of each antibody was confirmed by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as described below.Monoclonal AntibodiesA panel of monoclonal antibodies against human factor IX was prepared by the standard hybridoma technique. Clones producing antibodies reactive to the antigen were selected by ELISA. Characterization of the positive clones obtained was also performed by ELISA. The metal dependence of the binding was examined and preliminary epitope mapping utilizing various factor IX derivatives were performed. Among 119 positive clones, 46 clones exhibited Ca2+ dependence for the binding to the antigen. Two clones for which binding was absolutely dependent on Ca2+ ions, C1 (subclass IgG1, κ) and 2A2 (IgG1, κ), were selected for this study. The antibodies reacted with the isolated Gla domain fragment of factor IX (Morita and Kisiel, 1985Morita T. Kisiel W. Biochem Biophys, Res. Commun. 1985; 130: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) in the presence of Ca2+ ions at millimolar concentrations.4 4H. Atoda and T. Morita, unpublished observation. ELISAWells of microtiter plates were coated with 50 μl of protein solutions (1 μg/ml in TBS) for 2 h at ambient temperature with subsequent blocking by 1% BSA for 30 min. Coated wells were then incubated with 50 μl of a diluted solution of antibody in TBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 and various concentrations of Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions for 1 h, and the same buffers were used throughout the subsequent washing and incubation procedures. After two washes, the wells were reacted with 50 μl of peroxidase-conjugated goat antibodies against either rabbit IgG (for polyclonal antibodies) or mouse IgG (for monoclonal antibodies) (diluted 1:100; Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) for 1 h. After extensive washing (five times), reaction with the antigen was visualized by incubation with 1 mg/ml o-phenylenediamine and 0.06% H2O2 in 100 μl of 0.1 M citrate buffer, pH 5.5, and absorbance at 492 nm was recorded.Quantification of Factor IXaA two-stage clotting assay system was designed for the sensitive and selective quantification of factor IXa. A typical protocol was as follows. Human factor IX (10 μg/ml in 120 μl of TBS containing 1 mg/ml BSA and various concentrations of Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions) was incubated with 2.5 ng/ml factor XIa at 37°C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 15 μl of a solution of EDTA/Ca2+/Mg2+; Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions were included so that all the samples in a given set of experiments would include the same amounts of metal ions at this step, and the concentration of EDTA was adjusted to neutralize both the Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions in the sample. Factor IXa in the samples was then quantified; one part of the sample (50 μl) was mixed with one part of plasma deficient in factor IX and one part of a suspension of phospholipids (phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylserine (3:1, w/w; both from Sigma); 1 mg/ml in TBS) and equilibrated at 37°C for 2 min. Fifty μl of 20 mM CaCl2 were then added, and the time required for clotting was measured in an Amelung Coagulometer KC 4A. The amount of factor IXa was determined by use of a standard curve that had been prepared with pure human factor IXaβ that contained the same amounts of EDTA/Ca2+/Mg2+ as the tested samples; the logarithm of the clotting time was plotted against the logarithm of the concentration of standard factor IXa. The low concentrations of factor XIa and the rather long initial incubation period rendered the secondary activation of factor IX during the subsequent clotting assay negligible and allowed the accurate quantification of factor IXa. Note that sensitivity of the quantification is strongly dependent on the preparation of factor IX-deficient plasma, and the use of plasma with the lowest possible level of factor IX is necessary for the determination of extremely low levels of factor IXa. The preparations that we used were congenitally deficient human plasma (Sigma) or human plasma from which factor IX had been immunodepleted with monoclonal antibody (a gift from the Chemo-Sero Therapeutic Research Institute, Kumamoto, Japan). For the determination of kinetic parameters, concentrations of substrate ranging from 0.2 to 1.2 μM were utilized and the incubation period was set to ensure the linearity of the reaction. The data obtained were analyzed by construction of Eadie-Hofstee plots.RESULTSThe snake venom anticoagulant IX/X-bp recognizes Ca2+-bound conformations of Gla domains in factors IX and X.1 Approximately 1 mM Ca2+ ions is sufficient for binding to both factors(Atoda et al., 1994Atoda H. Yoshida N. Ishikawa M. Morita T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 703-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), consistent with the affinities of the Gla domains for Ca2+ ions. By contrast, Mg2+ ions alone were without effect (see Fig. 2). When Mg2+ ions were added together with Ca2+ ions, however, the extent of binding of IX/X-bp to factor IX was much increased (Fig. 1). In this experiment, the effect of the addition of Mg2+ ions on the binding of 125I-IX/X-bp to solid-phase factor IX or X was investigated in the presence of 1 mM Ca2+ ions. Upon the addition of Mg2+ ions, the binding to factor IX was greatly enhanced whereas the binding to factor X was unchanged. The effect of further addition of Ca2+ ions was modest for both proteins (data not shown). Since the same amount of Ca2+ ions had little effect and since the effect of Mg2+ ions was specific for factor IX, the observed phenomena appeared not to be due to a mere increase in the ionic strength of the incubation medium. Increase in the ionic strength of the medium tended, in fact, to inhibit the binding. In subsequent experiments, we focused our attention on the effects of Mg2+ ions on factor IX. As is shown in Fig. 2, the Ca2+ requirement curve for the binding to factor IX was shifted leftward, implying an enhancement of sensitivity to Ca2+ ions by Mg2+ ions. Furthermore, the augmentation was clearly seen even at saturating concentrations of Ca2+ ions. The affinity of IX/X-bp for factor IX was increased by the addition of Mg2+ ions, and the apparent Kd value for the binding of these proteins was decreased from 3.7 ± 1.6 × 10−8M (3 mM Ca2+ alone; mean ± S.E., n = 4) to 1.3 ± 0.1 × 10−8M (3 mM Ca2++ 3 mM Mg2+), whereas that for factor X was unchanged (3.5 ± 0.6 × 10−8M and 3.5 ± 1.3 × 10−8M in the absence and presence of Mg2+ ions, respectively). Half-maximal and maximal augmentation occurred at 0.3 and 3 mM Mg2+, respectively. It was revealed recently that IX/X-bp is capable of binding Ca2+ ions and other polyvalent metal ions, and occupation of the two Ca2+-binding sites in IX/X-bp is a prerequisite for the recognition of Gla domains.1 It is unlikely, however, that the effect of Mg2+ ions involves IX/X-bp directly, because the binding to factor X was unaffected by Mg2+ ions. It seems that IX/X-bp does not interact with Mg2+ ions; Ca2+ binding to IX/X-bp was not altered at all by high concentrations of Mg2+ ions (Fig. 3). These observations strongly suggest that factor IX is the molecule that interacts directly with Mg2+ ions. The result that relatively low concentrations of Mg2+ ions at saturating concentrations of Ca2+ ions were still effective suggests that Mg2+ ion(s) interact at specific site(s) that are separate from the putative Ca2+-binding sites in factor IX. The binding of Mg2+ ion(s) to this specific site(s) appears to promote a further conformational change of factor IX, yielding a form distinct from the form that is achieved by binding of Ca2+ ions alone.Figure 1:Effects of Mg2+ ions on the binding of 125I-IX/X-bp to factors IX and X. Wells of microtiter plates coated with bovine factor IX (left) or factor X (right) were incubated with 125I-IX/X-bp in the presence of 1 mM Ca2+ plus Mg2+ ions at the indicated concentrations, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Bound radioactivity is expressed as the percentage of the control value (1 mM Ca2+ alone). Total radioactivities and control values for factors IX and X were 44,000 (total) and 2,200 and 10,500 (controls) cpm, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3:Absence of an effect of Mg2+ ions on the binding of Ca2+ ions to IX/X-bp. Binding of Ca2+ ions to IX/X-bp was determined by equilibrium dialysis with 45Ca2+ as the tracer as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Moles of bound Ca2+/mol of IX/X-bp (r) were plotted as a function of the concentration of Ca2+ ions. Open circles indicate the results in the presence of 10 mM magnesium acetate. In the controls (closed circles), 30 mM sodium acetate was included to normalize the ionic strength.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To confirm our hypothesis we employed different probes, in an effort to exclude any possible effects of Mg2+ ions on IX/X-bp. A pool of polyclonal antibodies raised against bovine factor IX was fractionated by affinity chromatography on immobilized factor IX according to the dependence on metal ions of the recognition of the antigen by the method of Liebman et al.(Liebman et al., 1987Liebman H.A. Furie B.C. Furie B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7605-7612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-factor IX:Ca(II) antibodies obtained in this way showed absolute Ca2+ dependence for the binding, while Mg2+ ions were ineffective, a feature identical to that originally described. The Ca2+-dependent binding of the antibodies to bovine factor IX was also potentiated by the addition of Mg2+ ions (Fig. 4). Low concentrations of Mg2+ ions augmented the binding in the presence of very high concentrations of Ca2+ ions. Similar results were again obtained with Ca2+-dependent monoclonal antibodies against human factor IX (Fig. 5). The epitopes of these monoclonal antibodies were located within the Gla domain. Taking this result together with the results obtained with IX/X-bp, we can see that the tertiary structure of the Gla domain is greatly influenced by Mg2+ ions. The conformation adopted by the Gla domain in the presence of both cations is apparently different from that adopted with either cation by itself.Figure 4:Augmentation of the binding of anti-factor IX:Ca(II) antibodies to factor IX by Mg2+ ions. Binding of isolated anti-factor IX:Ca(II) antibodies to bovine factor IX was determined by ELISA in the presence of Ca2+ ions at the indicated concentrations, as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” Closed circles, Ca2+ alone; open squares, Ca2+ plus 0.3 mM Mg2+; open circles, Ca2+ plus 3 mM Mg2+.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 5:Augmentation of the binding of Gla-domain-directed monoclonal antibodies to factor IX by Mg2+ ions.

Closed circles, Ca2+ alone; open squares, Ca2+ plus 0.3 mM Mg2+; open circles, Ca2+ plus 3 mM Mg2+.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We also prepared conformation-specific polyclonal antibodies against human prothrombin, bovine factors VII and X, and bovine protein C by the same method as that employed for the preparation of anti-factor IX:Ca(II) antibodies, and we investigated the effects of Mg2+ ions on the binding of the respective antibodies to these proteins. The antibodies again had absolute Ca2+ dependence, and Mg2+ ions alone were again ineffective. However, the Ca2+-dependent binding of these antibodies was barely affected by the addition of Mg2+ ions, in contrast to the case with factor IX. Augmentation of the binding was not seen in the presence of excess Ca2+ ions (5-10 mM) in each case. In the presence of suboptimal concentrations of Ca2+ ions (of the order of 0.1 mM), slight leftward shifts in the Ca2+ titration curves by Mg2+ ions were seen in some cases, but these effects were negligible (data not shown). These results strongly suggest but do not prove that all of the Gla-containing coagulation proteases other than factor IX do not respond to Mg2+ ions. It seems thus that factor IX is unique among various vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors in such a way that its conformation is stabilized not only by Ca2+ ions but also by Mg2+ ions.We next examined the effects of Mg2+ ions on function of factor IX. The inactive zymogen factor IX is converted to the active protease factor IXa by physiological activators factor XIa or factor VIIa/tissue factor/phospholipid complex(Rapaport, 1977Rapaport S.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5260-5264Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar), or by the snake venom coagulant protease RVV-X(Lindquist et al., 1978Lindquist P.A. Fujikawa K. Davie E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1902-1909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Ca2+-bound conformation of factor IX is considered to be essential for efficient activation by each of these activators. However, factor VIIa per se also requires Ca2+ ions for the formation of the active complex with tissue factor and phospholipids. Such a requirement is also known for RVV-X, which is yet another metal-binding protein("

Formation of a higher order enzyme complex is supported by our previous study demonstrating specific α/α interactions among the rat Na,K-ATPase isoforms (α1, α2, α3), expressed in virally infected Sf-9 insect cells and among native α isoforms in rat brain(1Blanco G.

This detergent-resistant association was not observed in insect cells coexpressing the homologous gastric H,K-ATPase α-subunit, nor was it dependent on the coexpression of the β-subunit. To delineate domains necessary for α/α assembly, a series of H,K-ATPase·Na,K-ATPase chimeras were constructed by combining the N-terminal, cytoplasmic midregion and C-terminal segments derived from the Na,K-ATPase(N) and the H,K-ATPase (H) α-polypeptides (HNN, HNH, NHH, NHN, and HHN). The α-subunit chimeras were coexpressed with the Na,K-ATPase α1-subunit in Sf-9 cells using the baculovirus expression system. Specific and detergent-stable association is observed between the Na,K-ATPase α-subunit and the HNN and HNH chimeras, but not with the NHH, NHN, or HHN chimeras. Consistent with the Na,K-ATPase cytoplasmic domain as being necessary for α/α interactions, the full-length α-subunit stably associates with an α N-terminal deletion mutant (ΔGly2-Leu273), but not with an α cytoplasmic deletion mutant (ΔArg350-Pro785). In addition, the naturally occurring C-terminal truncated α1 isoform, α1T (ΔGly554 to C terminus), does not associate with the α1-subunit in Sf-9 cells coexpressing both polypeptides. Thus, a cytoplasmic region in the α-subunit (Gly554-Pro785) is necessary for specific α/α association. The same cytoplasmic region contains a strongly hydrophobic segment that, by analogy with oligomerization of water-soluble proteins, may form the interface of the extramembranous α/α contact site.

The Na,K-ATPase, or sodium pump, is a ubiquitous, multi-spanning membrane protein that actively maintains a high internal K+ concentration and a low internal Na+ concentration characteristic of most eucaryotic cells. In a chemomechanical process, the Na,K-ATPase couples the free energy from the hydrolysis of ATP to the countertransport of sodium and potassium ions against their respective electrochemical gradients. The transmembrane ion gradients generated are, in turn, critical for a number of fundamental cellular processes including regulation of cell volume, nutrient uptake, and membrane excitability. Structurally, the Na,K-ATPase is comprised of two, noncovalently linked subunits: a 110-kDa α-subunit and a smaller 40-60-kDa glycosylated β-subunit. All enzymatic functions of the enzyme have been assigned to the α-subunit. The α-subunit contains the binding sites for ATP and ouabain; it is phosphorylated by ATP and undergoes ligand-dependent conformational changes accompanying the binding, occlusion, and translocation of ions. The exact function of the β-subunit remains unknown; however, both the α- and β-subunits are required for functional expression of normal Na,K-ATPase activity(2Horowitz B. Eakle K.A.

Bioenerg. 1981; 11: 201-237Crossref Scopus (233) Google Scholar), there is less agreement as to the higher order structure of the membrane-bound Na,K-ATPase and the relevance of this structure to enzyme function. Since a complete understanding of the transport mechanism requires a detailed knowledge of the number of interacting substrate sites, a large body of work over the last two decades has attempted to establish the quaternary structure of the active enzyme unit. Despite this intense focus, the question of whether the membrane-embedded Na,K-ATPase functions as an αβ protomer, an (αβ)2 diprotomer of interacting α-subunits, or a higher order oligomer remains unresolved. Early work examining the two-dimensional crystalline structure of the Na,K-ATPase implicates the protomeric αβ-unit as the minimum asymmetric unit of the enzyme(8Skriver E. Maunsbach A.B.J.P.L.

However, in many cases the existence of these oligomeric complexes could be due to nonspecific collisions of the αβ protomers in the densely packed membrane preparations and may not reflect specific, functional subunit interactions. Using the baculovirus expression system, we have recently demonstrated the ability of the α-subunit isoforms to stably associate into oligomers in virally infected insect cells(1Blanco G. Koster J.C. Mercer R.W. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8542-8546Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The specificity the of α/α interaction is suggested by the inability of the Na,K-ATPase α-subunit to associate with either the highly homologous gastric H,K-ATPase α-subunit or the truncated α1T isoform in cells expressing the recombinant polypeptides. In the present work, to delineate the domain(s) necessary for α/α assembly, we have coexpressed a series of Na,K-H,K α-subunit chimeras and α-subunit deletion mutants with the full-length α-subunit in Sf-9 insect cells and assayed for detergent-resistant association. Here, we identify a cytoplasmic region of the Na,K-ATPase α-subunit that is necessary for stable and specific α/α association. The full-length cDNAs for the α-subunits from the rat Na,K-ATPase (α1) and the rabbit gastric H,K-ATPase were cloned into the plasmid pGEM4 and used to generate a series of α-subunit chimeras. Unique ClaI restriction sites were introduced into the α-subunit cDNAs by polymerase chain reaction. Restriction sites were positioned at the junctions of the N-terminal:cytoplasmic regions (5′ ClaI) and cytoplasmic:C-terminal regions (3′ ClaI) according to the eight-transmembrane model for α-subunit topology(23Shull G.E. Greeb J. Lingrel J.B Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 8125-8132Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 24Mercer R.W. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1993; 137: 139-168Google Scholar). The 5′ ClaI restriction site was engineered in the nucleic acid sequence encoding Lys350, and the 3′ ClaI site was positioned in the sequence encoding Pro785. Polymerase chain reaction products were first subcloned into the ddT-tailed EcoRV site of plasmid pBSSK (25Holton T.A. Graham M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 19: 1156Crossref Scopus (339) Google Scholar) and subsequently joined via the ClaI restriction sites to create 5′ ClaI and 3′ ClaI constructs with flanking α-subunit sequences. The ClaI cassettes were then subcloned back into context of the full-length α-subunit cDNAs in pGEM4. Using this approach, full-length 5′ ClaI, 3′ ClaI, and 5′/3′ ClaI constructs were created for both α-subunits. Distinct N-terminal, cytoplasmic, and C-terminal restriction fragments were generated and interchanged between the Na,K-ATPase and H,K-ATPase α-subunits to create the different chimeras. As shown in Fig. 3, the chimeras are designated based on the position of the topological regions: N for Na,K-ATPase derived, H for H,K-ATPase derived. Polymerase chain reaction cassettes were sequenced to verify that no other mutations were introduced during the polymerase reaction. The α1 cytoplasmic deletion mutant (ΔGly554-Pro785) was created by excising the cytoplasmic ClaI restriction fragment from the 5′/3′ ClaI construct described above and religating the plasmid. For the α1 N-terminal deletion mutant (ΔGly2-Leu273), site-directed mutagenesis (Amersham Corp.) was performed to introduce a NcoI restriction site at the position in the cDNA encoding Leu273. The mutant NcoI cassette was then subcloned back into the α1 pGEM4 construct in the NcoI recognition sequence that also encodes the start methionine. DNA sequencing confirmed that the methionine codon was unaltered and that no other mutations were introduced during the mutagenesis procedure. Amino acids in the rat α1-subunit are numbered beginning with the start methionine at position 1. Numbering of residues from cited works is in accordance with the rat α1-subunit. Recombinant baculoviruses coding for the rodent Na,K-ATPase α1- and α2-subunits, α1 deletion mutants, and Na,K-H,K α-subunit chimeras were prepared as described previously(3De Tomaso A.W. Xie Z.J.

Recombinant baculovirus expressing the rabbit H,K-ATPase α-subunit was provided by Dr. George Sachs (University of California, Los Angeles). Uninfected and infected Sf-9 cells were grown in six-well culture plates in TNM:FH medium(3De Tomaso A.W. Xie Z.J. Lui G. Mercer R.W. J. Biol.

Infections, using a viral multiplicity of infection ranging from 5-10, were performed for 1 h at 27°C. After 72 h, the cells were lysed in 2% CHAPS1 1The abbreviations used are: CHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonatePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisIAPintegrin-associated protein. in 150 mM NaCl, 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4 (HBS), or in 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100 in HBS. Proteins from solubilized cells were immunoprecipitated or immunoblotted as described below. 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis integrin-associated protein. Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) (28Laemmli U.K. Nature (Lond.). 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207159) Google Scholar) and transferred to nitrocellulose paper (Hybond C Plus, Amersham Corp.). Membrane proteins from rat kidney were prepared as described by Blanco and Beaugé(29Blanco G. Beaugé L. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1988; 268: 271-278Google Scholar). Crude gastric mucosa microsomes were prepared from the stomachs of New Zealand White rabbits as described previously (30Chow D.C. Browning C.M. Forte J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C39-C46Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but without additional microsomal enrichment by density gradient centrifugation. Nitrocellulose blots were blocked in Blotto (5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk, 0.1% sodium azide in 150 mM NaCl, 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4°C. Primary antibody in 1% Blotto was bound at 37°C for 1-2 h on a rocking table. After two 10-min washes in HBS and one 10-min wash in 1% Triton X-100 in HBS, 1-2 μCi of 125I-labeled goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody was added in 1% Blotto. The blots were incubated for 45-60 min at 37°C and washed as above. After washing, the blots were dried and exposed for autoradiography. For immunoprecipitations, 150-200 μg of total protein from Sf-9 cells were solubilized in microcentrifuge tubes in 500 μl of 2% CHAPS in HBS or 0.1% SDS and 1% Triton X-100 in HBS for 15 min on ice, and the insoluble material was pelleted in a microcentrifuge (10 min; 15,000 × g). When in the buffer containing CHAPS, the detergent was diluted to 1% by the addition of HBS. To precipitate the α polypeptides, 50 μl of the indicated α-specific monoclonal antibody hybridoma supernatant and 70 μl (1 mg/ml) of goat anti-mouse coated magnetic beads (BioMag, PerSeptive Diagnostics Inc., Cambridge, MA) were added. After overnight incubation on a rocking table at 4°C, the magnetic beads were isolated by holding the microcentrifuge tube to a magnet and aspirating the supernatant. The beads were washed 3 times with 1 ml of 1% CHAPS in HBS. When in buffer containing SDS, the beads were washed 3 times with 1 ml of 0.1% SDS and 1% Triton X-100 in HBS. The precipitated proteins were eluted by resuspending the washed beads in sample buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 33% glycerol, 100 mM dithiothreitol) and incubating for 10 min at 65°C. The eluted protein was separated by SDS-PAGE (7.5% gel) transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with the indicated antibody. As a control for the specificity of the immunoprecipitations, 100 μg of protein from individually infected cells were combined in a microcentrifuge tube, solubilized, and used for immunoprecipitations. Unless otherwise indicated, immunoprecipitation results are from proteins solubilized in 2% CHAPS.

The integrin-associated protein (IAP) was identified with a monoclonal antibody provided by Dr. Eric Brown (Washington University) (37Lindberg F.P. Gresham H.D. Schwarz E. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 485-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The β1 polypeptide was identified using a polyclonal anti-αβ antiserum described previously(3De Tomaso A.W. Xie Z.J. Lui G. Mercer R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1470-1478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant baculoviruses containing the cDNAs coding for the Na,K-ATPase α1-subunit and highly homologous gastric H,K-ATPase α-subunit (≈63% amino acid identity) were used to infect Sf-9 insect cells, a cell line derived from the ovary of the fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda. As shown in Fig. 1, Sf-9 cells express the corresponding α-subunit when infected. Insect cells infected with the Na,K-ATPase recombinant baculovirus express high levels of α1 polypeptide, which is recognized by the α1 monoclonal antibodies, C464 and 5α, but not by the H,K α-directed antibodies, H,K-9, and 12:18. In Sf-9 cells infected with the H,K-ATPase recombinant baculovirus, the expressed α-subunit is identified by the H,K α-specific antibodies, but shows no reactivity with the Na,K α1-specific antibodies. In addition, all of the α-specific antibodies identify the respective α polypeptide in rat kidney (α1) and rabbit mucosal (α1 and H,K α) membranes but show no cross-reactivity with endogenous protein from uninfected Sf-9 cells. This is consistent with the low levels of Na,K-ATPase activity and the absence of H,K-ATPase activity reported in these cells(3De Tomaso A.W. Xie Z.J. Lui G. Mercer R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1470-1478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Klassen C.H.W. Van Uem T.J.F. De Moel M.P. De Caluwe L.J. Swarts H.G.P. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 329: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated a stable, detergent-resistant interaction among the baculovirus-induced Na,K-ATPase isoforms (α1, α2, α3) in Sf-9 cells and among the native polypeptides in rat brain(1Blanco G. Koster J.C. Mercer R.W. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8542-8546Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The highly specific nature of the α/α interaction is suggested by the inability of the α1-subunit to stably associate with the homologous H,K-ATPase α-subunit in cells coexpressing both polypeptides. To verify these previous findings, Sf-9 cells were infected with the α1 virus in addition to the α2 or H,K α baculovirus. After 72 h, the cells were solubilized in buffer containing 2% CHAPS or 0.1% SDS and 1% Triton X-100, and the proteins were subjected to immunoprecipitation with an α1-specific monoclonal antibody. The immunoprecipitates were electrophoresed by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with either the H,K α-specific monoclonal antibody (12:18), or the α2-specific monoclonal antibody (McB2). If the H,K α- or α2-subunit stably associates with the α1-subunit in coexpressing cells, then it should be identified in the immunoprecipitated proteins. As shown in Fig. 2A, when the α1-specific monoclonal antibody is used to immunoprecipitate proteins from cells coexpressing the α1- and α2-subunits, the α2 polypeptide is coimmunoprecipitated. However, when cells singly infected with either the α1 or α2 baculovirus are combined prior to solubilization, the α2 polypeptide is not identified in the immunoprecipitate. In contrast to α2-infected cells, when proteins from cells coexpressing the H,K α- and α1-subunits are immunoprecipitated with the α1-specific antibody, the H,K α polypeptide fails to coimmunoprecipitate (Fig. 2B). The immunoreactive band at the bottom of the gel represents the reduced form of the immunoprecipitating antibody that reacts with the anti-mouse secondary antibody. This lack of association is not due to differential levels of α1 protein expression since equivalent amounts of the α1 polypeptide are expressed in both α1/α2- and α1/H,K α-coinfected cells (Fig. 2C). Thus, the Na,K-ATPase α2-subunit, but not the H,K α-subunit, stably and specifically associates with the α1-subunit when both polypeptides are expressed together. As a consequence of the high levels of baculovirus-directed protein expression, the possibility exists that the subunit interactions in the infected Sf-9 cells may result from the nonspecific, detergent-resistant aggregation or accidental collision of the overexpressed recombinant polypeptides. In this fashion, the association of the α1- and α2-subunits in coexpressing cells may represent an artifact of the expression system and not a specific assembly event. To address this possibility, a recombinant baculovirus directing the expression of an unrelated transmembrane protein, the murine IAP, was coinfected with the α1 baculovirus in Sf-9 insect cells. IAP is a 50-kDa multi-spanning membrane protein that copurifies with the integrin αvβ3 and has been implicated in the regulation of ligand binding by the integrin receptor(37Lindberg F.P. Gresham H.D. Schwarz E. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 485-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). After 72 h, cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine, solubilized, and cell proteins were immunoprecipitated with an α1-specific monoclonal antibody (C464). As shown in Fig. 2D, when the α1-subunit is specifically immunoprecipitated from cells expressing both the IAP and α1 polypeptides, only the α1-subunit is immunoprecipitated. The immunoprecipitated IAP from singly infected Sf-9 cells is shown as a standard (Fig. 2D, lane3). In addition, when IAP is coexpressed with the Na,K-ATPase β2 isoform and the labeled protein is immunoprecipitated with an anti-IAP monoclonal antibody, no significant increase in the amount of immunoprecipitated β2 protein is observed over background (Fig. 2D, compare lanes1 and 2). This is in contrast to our previous work demonstrating a highly selective, detergent-stable association of the β2-subunit with the α2 isoform in Sf-9 cells coexpressing both subunits(39Blanco G. Xie Z.J. Mercer R.W. Bamberg E. Schoner W. The Sodium Pump: Structure Mechanism, Hormonal Control and its Role in Disease. Springer, New York1994: 82-85Crossref Google Scholar). Thus, the association among the Na,K-ATPase subunits in infected Sf-9 cells is specific and not a consequence of the overexpression of the recombinant proteins. To delineate the domains necessary for Na,K α/α assembly, a series of five chimeras was constructed between the catalytic α-subunits of the Na,K-ATPase α1 isoform and the homologous gastric H,K-ATPase. Using the cDNAs, the segments corresponding to the N-terminal transmembrane region, the cytoplasmic midregion, and the C-terminal region were interchanged to create the fusion Na,K- and H,K-ATPase constructs shown in Fig. 3. Positioning of the fusion junctions is in accordance with the eight-transmembrane model for α-subunit topology(23Shull G.E. Greeb J. Lingrel J.B Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 8125-8132Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). The chimeras are designated based on the position of the structural region: N for Na,K-ATPase derived, H for H,K-ATPase derived. As we have previously demonstrated, all chimeric α-subunits are stably expressed at high levels in the membrane fraction of infected Sf-9 cells, and are structurally competent, as judged by their ability to specifically and stably associate with the coexpressed β-subunit(40Koster J.C. Reuben M.A. Sachs G. Mercer R.W. Bamberg E. Schoner W. The Sodium Pump: Structure Mechanism, Hormonal Control and its Role in Disease. Springer, New York1994: 90-93Crossref Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4A, when proteins from cells coexpressing the α1 and HNN polypeptides are immunoprecipitated with an N terminus-directed α1-specific antibody (C464), the HNN fusion protein is identified in the immunoprecipitate. Similarly, the α1-specific monoclonal antibody coimmunoprecipitates the HNH subunit from cells coexpressing the α1 and HNH subunits (Fig. 4A). In both experiments, immunoprecipitated proteins were identified with a H,K α-specific antiserum (H,K-9) that recognizes a sequence from the extreme N terminus. In the control lanes, proteins from cells individually expressing the corresponding subunits were combined prior to immunoprecipitation. In contrast to the HNN and HNH fusion proteins, chimeric α-subunits containing the cytoplasmic midregion derived from the gastric H,K-ATPase (NHH, NHN, HHN) do not selectively associate with the Na,K-ATPase α1 polypeptide in simultaneously infected insect cells. As shown in Fig. 5A, an α1 antibody (5α) that specifically recognizes the cytoplasmic midregion of the Na,K α1 isoform does not coimmunoprecipitate the NHH, NHN, or HHN polypeptides in α1/Na,K-H,K chimera coexpressing cells. This lack of association is not due to differential levels of the α1 protein expression since significant levels of the α1 polypeptide are expressed in NHH/α1, NHN/α1, and HHN/α1 coinfected cells (Fig. 5B). Moreover, the absence of an observed interaction cannot be attributed to the reduced reactivity of the immunoprecipitating antibody, since approximately equal amounts of α1 protein from α1 infected cells is immunoprecipitated using either the 5α antibody or the N-terminal-directed α1 antibody, C464 (Fig. 5C). Taken together, these results suggest that a segment important for subunit interaction resides in the cytoplasmic midregion portion of the α1 polypeptide (Arg350-Pro785). It has previously been shown that in the presence of the chemical cross-linker copper-phenanthroline, Na+-dependent phosphorylation of the Na,K-ATPase induces cross-linking of two α-subunits through disulfide bonds, and that this phenomenon is thought to be indicative of the physical interaction between α-subunits of the membrane-bound enzyme (41Periyasamy S.M.

Poliovirus, a member of the Picornaviridae family, possesses a single-stranded genome of positive polarity(1Wimmer E. Hellen C.U.T. Cao X. Annu. Rev.

Upon infection of permissive cells, the viral RNA gains access into the cytoplasm, where the replication of the genome takes place(2Semler B.L. Kuhn R.J. Wimmer E. Domingo E. Holland J.J. Ahlquist P.

The minus strand is used to synthesize more plus strand RNAs, which can be used as templates for new minus strand RNAs, as messenger RNAs, or as genomic virion RNAs(4Kuhn R.J. Wimmer E. Rowlands D.J. Mahy B.W.J. Mayo M. The Molecular Biology of Positive Strand RNA Viruses. Academic Press, Inc., New York1987: 17-51Google Scholar). All nascent viral RNA strands synthesized in the cell are covalently linked to the VPg protein (VPg = 3B)(5Flanegan J.B. Petterson R.F. Ambros V. Hewlett N.J. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

A. 1977; 74: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which this peptide is bound to the 5′-end of the viral genome constitutes one of the puzzling unanswered questions in the poliovirus replication field. The viral polymerase (3Dpol) is the only polypeptide isolated from infected cells with RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity(7Flanegan J.B. Baltimore D. J. Virol. 1979; 29: 352-360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Flanegan J.B. Van Dyke T.A. J. Virol. 1979; 32: 155-161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it has been considered the protein responsible for the elongation of the RNA strands. In addition, most if not all of the poliovirus nonstructural proteins have been implicated in the replication of the genome(9Bernstein H.D. Sarnow P. Baltimore D. J. Virol. 1986; 60: 1040-1049Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Burns C.C. Lawson M.A. Semler B.L. Ehrenfeld E. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 4866-4874Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Kirkegaard K. Curr. Opin.

Virology. 1993; 196: 739-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Special interest has been focused on the 3AB protein. 3AB is the most abundant precursor of the VPg protein(16Semler B.L. Anderson C.W. Hanecak R. Dorner L.F. Wimmer E. Cell. 1982; 28: 405-412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Protein 3AB localizes to the membranous replication complexes, where active replication takes place(17Takegami T. Semler B.L. Anderson C.W. Wimmer E. Virology. 1983; 128: 33-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 18Bienz K. Egger D. Rasser Y. Bossart W. Virology. 1983; 131: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). It has been postulated that an uridylylated form of VPg or, more likely, an uridylylated form of 3AB might serve as a primer to initiate polymerase activity by 3Dpol(19Takeda N. Kuhn R.J. Yang C.F. Takegami T. Wimmer E. J. Virol. 1986; 60: 43-53Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Takegami T. Kuhn R.J. Anderson C.W. Wimmer E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7447-7451Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, the nucleotidylyl transfer reaction has never been reproduced in vitro using purified components. The proposed function of 3AB in poliovirus RNA replication mainly arose from genetic studies. The first genetic evidence was reported by Berstein and Baltimore(21Berstein H.D. Baltimore D. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 2922-2928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These authors described a cold-sensitive poliovirus mutant encoding for a 3A protein with a single amino acid insertion. This mutant showed a small plaque phenotype and severe replication defects at the restrictive temperature. Since then, multiple poliovirus 3A mutants with defects in RNA replication have been isolated(22Giachetti C. Hwang S.-S. Semler B.L. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6045-6057Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Giachetti C. Semler B.L. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2647-2654Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Many of these mutations were mapped to the hydrophobic domain of 3A, which presumably promotes the binding of the protein to the cellular membranes. Amino acid changes in the hydrophobic domain commonly result in death or mutant viruses with drastic impairments in the replication of the RNA(23Giachetti C. Semler B.L. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2647-2654Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). If RNAs obtained by transcription from these mutant cDNAs are used to program HeLa cell extracts for in vitro translation, in some cases aberrant polyprotein-processing patterns are obtained. Thus, the hydrophobic region of 3A may serve to anchor the polypeptide, or part of it, to the membranous replication complex, a process that can modulate the proteolytic cleavage of the polypeptide. Recently, a key finding to understanding the function of 3AB in RNA replication has been reported(24Lama J. Paul A.V. Harris K.S. Wimmer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 66-70Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 3AB protein purified to almost homogeneity possesses an intrinsic stimulatory activity of the viral polymerase 3Dpol. Thus, in vitro poly(U) synthesis by 3Dpol is stimulated more than 50-fold in the presence of recombinant purified 3AB. The transactivation activity occurs in the absence of any detected uridylylation and was completely dependent on the presence of a nucleic acid primer. These results suggested that 3AB could function in vivo as a co-factor of 3Dpol in viral transcription. However, genetic evidence supporting this hypothesis is still lacking. We now report the characterization of mutant polioviruses with severe defects in viral RNA replication. These viruses encode for 3AB proteins unable to transactivate the viral polymerase. Virus propagation and virus plaque assays were performed on HeLa R19 cell monolayers grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum. HeLa cell lysates for in vitro translation were made from HeLa S3 cells grown in minimum essential medium modified for suspension cells supplemented with 5% calf serum. The viruses used in this work were obtained after transfection of HeLa cell monolayers with infectious RNAs derived from the genomic cDNA cloned in the pT7XLD vector(25van der Werf S. Bradley J. Wimmer E. Studier W. Dunn J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2330-2334Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Wild type and K9E-3AB viruses were plaque-purified and amplified in HeLa cells up to titers of 0.5-1 × 109 pfu/ml.1 1The abbreviations used are: pfuplaque-forming unit(s)PCRpolymerase chain reactionRT-PCRreverse transcription-polymerase chain reactionMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidCPEcytopathic effect. Stocks of the viruses K107-3AB and K9E/K107 3AB were obtained after 3 days of transfection with the corresponding RNAs. These stocks have titers of 0.5-1 × 106 pfu/ml and were directly used in the experiments described. Additional plaque purification and amplification of these viruses gave place to the generation of revertant viruses with wild type plaque phenotype. The complete 3AB gene of the viral RNA of all the stock viruses was sequenced. Virus RNA purification, cDNA synthesis, and PCR from the cDNA obtained were performed to ensure that the mutations introduced had been retained in the viral genome. To create mutant cDNAs with the desired mutations the 3AB gene was PCR-amplified from the corresponding pT7lac3AB plasmid. To do so, the following primers were used: 5′-3A (5′-CCC GGG CAT ATG GGA CCA CTC CAG TAT AAA GAC-3′) and 3′-3BC (5′-GCG TAA TCG AAC CCT GGT CCT TGT ACC TTT GCT GTC CGA AT-3′). To amplify mutant DNAs K107-3AB and K9E/K107 3AB, the PCR reaction was carried out with primers 5′-3A and 3′-3BC K107E (5′-GCG TAA TCG AAC CCT GGT CCT TGT ACC TCT GCT GTC CGA AT-3′). After PCR amplification, the fragments were digested with AvaII, and the 3AB gene was exchanged with the equivalent AvaII DNA fragment of the pT7XLD plasmid. The 3AB regions of the wild type and mutant cDNAs were completely sequenced by the dideoxy method (Sequenase, U.S. Biochemical Corp.). Transfection of HeLa cells was carried out with Lipofectin reagent. Ten μg of in vitro transcribed RNA, without further purification, were mixed with 15 μg of Lipofectin and incubated at 37°C for 2 h with HeLa cells that had been previously washed with prewarmed phosphate-buffered saline to remove calf serum. After this time, the cells were kept in 2% calf serum for 3 days at 37°C, and the viruses were recovered by three cycles of freeze-thawing. To quantify the cytopathic effect, the percentage of cells showing clear symptoms of morphological rounding was estimated de visu. plaque-forming unit(s) polymerase chain reaction reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid cytopathic effect. To determine the RNA binding capabilities of different 3AB proteins, we routinely used a method recently described(26Rodrguez P.L. Carrasco L. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 702-705PubMed Google Scholar). This procedure is based on the binding of biotinylated RNA probes (riboprobes) to renatured proteins bound to nitrocellulose sheets (Northwestern). Briefly, the proteins (purified or crude extracts) were separated in 20% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. After washing the nitrocellulose sheets in a renaturation buffer, the nitrocellulose was first incubated with a biotinylated riboprobe (40 ng/ml). Then unbound RNA was washed with phosphate-buffered saline-Tween 20, and the membranes were incubated with streptavidin-conjugated peroxidase. After washing off the peroxidase, the nitrocellulose was soaked in luminol-luciferin solution and exposed to x-ray films. The biotinylated riboprobes were obtained by in vitro transcription of the appropriate DNAs in the presence of 0.5 mM 21-UTP. The riboprobe “5-leader” consists of the genomic RNA sequence (plus strand) between nucleotides 1 and 745. The riboprobe 3′-end contains nucleotides 6516-7440 of the 3′-end of the genomic RNA, whereas the riboprobe “2.5 BamHI”, of negative polarity, encompasses the complementary region to nucleotides 2099-4600 of the genome. To confirm the data on RNA binding, a gel retardation assay was used in some instances to detect RNA-protein complexes. The purified proteins were incubated with 10 ng of a 51-nucleotide-long riboprobe of positive polarity, which contains a region of the 2B poliovirus gene (nucleotides 3925-3952) in addition to some plasmid-derived nucleotides. The analysis of the free and bound probe forms was carried out as described previously(26Rodrguez P.L. Carrasco L. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 702-705PubMed Google Scholar). To quantify the amount of 3AB protein present in crude extracts, we used an anti-3A antiserum that recognizes an epitope located between amino acids 30-44 of the 3A protein. Expression in E. coli of 3A and 3AB proteins was carried out from the plasmids pT7lac3A and pT7lac3AB, respectively, as described previously(27Lama J. Carrasco L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15932-15937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mutant 3AB proteins used in this work were obtained by PCR-based random mutagenesis. To purify wild type and K9E-3AB proteins, we followed a previously described procedure(24Lama J. Paul A.V. Harris K.S. Wimmer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 66-70Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but in this case, during the elution of proteins from the S-Sepharose resin, the 100 mM salt wash was omitted. The protein K107E-3AB behaved as the wild type through the DE-52 column; however, at the S-Sepharose binding step the pH of the column had to be changed from MOPS (pH 7.2) to MES (pH 6.5). The posterior elution was carried out in 200 mM NaCl, 25 mM MES (pH 6.5). As control, wild type 3AB protein was also purified in an identical way, that is at pH 6.5 during the binding and elution of the S-Sepharose column. K9E/K107E-3AB was purified as described above, but after the DE-52 column the protein was concentrated with ultrafiltration membranes (Amicon). Since this protein did not bind to the S-Sepharose column under any of the conditions tested, this fraction was no longer purified. Purification of 3A was stopped after concentration of DE-52 fractions. However, this protein was not recovered from the unbound proteins originally passed through the DE-52 resin, since under equilibration conditions the protein bound to the column and was later recovered with a 50 mM NaCl wash. Incorporation of [3H]UMP was measured using a poly(A)-dependent, oligo(dT)pol-primed poly(U) polymerase assay in the presence of purified 3Dpol. Recombinant 3Dpol, in a poly(U)-free form, completely dependent on the presence of a nucleic acid primer for its activity, was kindly provided by Dr. S. Plotch. Reaction conditions for the polymerase assay have been described before(24Lama J. Paul A.V. Harris K.S. Wimmer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 66-70Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Standard transactivation reactions were carried out in the presence of 20 ng/μl of 3A or 3AB proteins. Poliovirus polymerase was used at 0.2 ng/μl. To quantify the levels of viral specific RNA, HeLa cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1 pfu/ml. After 4 h of infection at 37°C the cells were lysed, and the total cytoplasmic RNA was isolated by the Nonidet P-40 lysis method (28Favaloro J. Treisman R. Kamen R. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 718-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar) and used to synthesize a cDNA strand with avian mieloblastosis virus retrotranscriptase (Promega). Retrotranscriptase reactions were carried out in a 40-μl mixture containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH8.3), 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.01% gelatin, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM dNTPs, 3 units of avian mieloblastosis virus retrotranscriptase, 15 units of RNAsin inhibitor, 0.25 μM of the first primer, and 250 ng of total cytoplasmic RNA. After incubation at 42°C for 30 min, the retrotransciptase was destroyed by boiling, and 0.25 μM of the second primer and 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase were added (Perkin-Elmer). PCR amplification took place during either 30 cycles (minus RNA) or 25 cycles (plus RNA) under the following conditions: 1 min at 93°C, 1 min at 37°C, and 5 min at 72°C (last cycle, 10 min at 72°C). The amount of amplified fragment was quantified in 1.0% agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide. To detect plus strand viral RNA, the retrotranscriptase reaction was carried out with the primer 3′-2B (GGC CCG GAT CCT TAT TAT TGC TTG ATG ACA TAA GGTA). The primer 5′-2A (GGC CGG CCC GGG ATT CGG ACA CCA AAAC) was later added in order to proceed with the PCR reaction. To detect minus strand polio RNA, the order of addition of the primers was reversed. As an internal standard for the reaction the β-actin mRNA was amplified by RT-PCR in the same test tubes. To this end, the primer 3′-β-actin (GGA AGC TTC TAG AAG CAT TTG CGG TGG ACG ATG GAG GGG CC) was included into the retrotranscriptase reaction, and the primer 5′-β-actin (GGG AAT TCA TGG ATG ATG ATA TCG CCG CG) was later added during the PCR reaction. β-actin primers were used at 1 μM. Amplification of polio and β-actin cDNAs results in fragments of 727 and 1170 nucleotides in length, respectively. Translations were carried out in HeLa S3 cell extracts treated with micrococcal nuclease and programmed with infectious RNAs synthesized by in vitro transcription of wild type or mutant cDNAs. The preparation of extracts was essentially as described by Molla et al.(29Molla A. Paul A.V. Wimmer E. Science. 1991; 254: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Reactions were incubated at 30°C for 15 h with 100 ng of transcript RNA in the presence of 0.7 μCi/μl of [35S]methionine. The synthesized proteins were analyzed by autoradiography of SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Previous experiments have shown a stimulating activity of poly(U) synthesis directed by the viral polymerase 3Dpol in the presence of purified 3AB protein (24). These results suggested that 3AB could be a co-factor of 3Dpol in viral transcription. This stimulating activity was completely dependent on the presence of the 3AB polypeptide but was not due to a nucleotidylylation reaction on the 3AB protein, since the polymerase activity of 3Dpol was dependent on the presence of a nucleic acid primer in the reaction mixture. An alternative hypothesis to explain the stimulatory effect of 3AB might rely on the ability of the protein to increase the affinity or the binding of 3Dpol to either the template or the primer RNA. Paul et al.(30Paul A. Cao X. Harris K. Lama J. Wimmer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29173-29181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that under conditions where 3Dpol and poly(A) template were reduced to a minimum, the degree of transactivation was maximal, promoting more than 100-fold stimulation. These results suggest that 3AB may enhance the interaction between the template RNA and the viral polymerase. A prediction of this model is the interaction of 3AB with RNA and 3AB with 3Dpol. As a first step in the elucidation of the mechanism of action of 3AB, the RNA binding activity of purified 3AB was assayed (Fig. 1). Wild type purified 3AB was used to analyze the binding activity to different biotinylated RNA probes. As shown in Fig. 1A, purified 3AB bound three different heteroligomeric RNA probes. The signal given by the binding reactions increased linearly with the amount of 3AB protein used. The 5′-end of the genome has been involved in the translation and replication of the genome, and different independent domains have been identified for each of these functions(31Larsen G.R. Anderson C.W. Dorner A.J. Semler B.L. Wimmer E. J. Virol. 1982; 41: 340-344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Pelletier J. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1988; 334: 320-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (1403) Google Scholar). A pseudo-knot structure has been identified in the 3′-end of the genome(33Jacobson S.J. Konings D.A.M. Sarnow P. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2961-2971Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test the binding of 3AB to these structures, riboprobes spanning both ends of the genome were synthesized. The 3AB protein bound both probes, suggesting that either 3AB binds specifically to both ends of the genome or 3AB binds nonspecifically to polyribonucleic acid molecules. 3AB also bound to a riboprobe of negative polarity encompassing the complementary region between nucleotides 2099 and 4600 of the viral genome (Fig. 1A). Indeed, this binding reaction took place to a greater degree than in the other cases, although these differences may be due to differences in the level of incorporation of biotinylated UTP in the larger, minus strand RNA probe. Thus, purified 3AB binds to different RNA molecules and does not seem to show any sequence specificity for binding to the poliovirus genome. Further corroborating these results, homopolymeric RNAs, either poly(A) or poly(U), efficiently compete with the binding of the 2.5-BamHI biotinylated riboprobe to 3AB (Fig. 1B). In fact, we have tested other riboprobes, finding similar RNA binding capabilities in all cases (data not shown). In order to confirm the RNA binding activity found with the Northwestern assay, we carried out a gel retardation assay to check the effect of 3AB on a 32P-labeled riboprobe. As shown in Fig. 1C, this procedure allow us to detect a retardation effect on the mobility of a 51-nucleotide-long riboprobe. This binding was also avoided in the presence of competitor cold poly(A) RNA. The Northwestern procedure makes use of proteins separated on polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose sheets. Given sufficient quantities of the recombinant protein, this assay permits the analysis of mutated proteins in total lysates without further purification. Fig. 2 shows the RNA binding activity of a set of 14 different 3AB variants, including the 3A protein, which lacks the VPg sequence. A new binding protein is observed when wild type 3AB protein is expressed in Escherichia coli cells (Fig. 2, lane3). This band does not appear in the control extract without the recombinant protein (Fig. 2, lane2). Amino acid substitutions at positions 9, 13, 54, 62, 63, 67, 75, 77, 79, 81, and 97 did not affect the binding of the biotinylated riboprobe. Neither the introduction of positively charged residues nor α-helix-breaking proline residues into the hydrophobic domain seems to affect the interaction of 3AB with RNA. However, amino acid substitutions in this region produce mutant viruses with defects in RNA replication(22Giachetti C. Hwang S.-S. Semler B.L. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6045-6057Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Amino acid substitution at position 107 (lysine 107 to glutamic acid) seems to abolish the RNA binding capability of 3AB. Even though similar amounts of K107E-3AB and, for instance, K97R-3AB, were contained in the E. coli extracts, no new band was found in the position expected for the recombinant K107E-3AB protein (Fig. 2, lane6), whereas a clear band was revealed in the position of the K97E-3AB protein. No RNA binding activity was detected in the K9E/K107E-3AB protein, which contains a double amino acid change in the 3A and VPg regions of the polypeptide. No binding was detected with the 3A protein. The level of expression of different 3AB proteins in E. coli was quite variable, making it difficult to compare the binding activities of different mutated proteins. Thus, we decided to purify the wild type 3AB and 3A proteins and the mutants K9E, K107E, and K9E/K107E-3AB proteins (Fig. 3). Wild type and K9E-3AB proteins were purified following a previously published protocol(24Lama J. Paul A.V. Harris K.S. Wimmer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 66-70Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although the mutated 3AB proteins changed their chromatographic behavior to different degrees and small modifications in the procedure were necessary. In the case of the proteins K107E and K9E/K107E-3AB, only 70 and 40% respectively, of the recombinant protein remains in the unbound fraction after the DEAE-cellulose purification step (data not shown). This result suggests that both residues at positions 9 and 107 are in the outer surface of the molecule, since both proteins seem to interact more strongly with the positively charged DEAE resin, as compared with either the wild type or the single mutant K9E. As expected, the 3A protein, which does not contain the highly basic VPg moiety, bound to the DEAE resin under conditions where no wild type 3AB protein remained bound to the column (data not shown). Proteins K107E and wild type 3AB were further purified through S-Sepharose resin. However, to allow efficient binding of the former, the pH of the column was reduced to 6.5. To assure that this change did not alter the RNA binding and transactivating activities of the protein, the wild type protein was purified at pH 6.5 also. Fig. 3A shows the degree of purity of the recombinant proteins. The proteins purified through DE-52 and S-Sepharose resins were more than 95% pure, whereas the proteins 3A and K9E-K107E-3AB were obtained at 90 and 70% of purity, respectively, as estimated by densitometric analysis of SDS-polyacrylamide gels. In Fig. 3B equal amounts of the purified proteins were used to estimate their binding to the biotinylated RNA probe. In the upperpanel the proteins purified through S-Sepharose resin were analyzed. Wild type protein and K9E-3AB mutant bound RNA to a similar degree. However, the amino acid substitution at position 107 (K107E) greatly reduced the binding activity, as compared with the wild type protein purified in an identical way (pH 6.5). In the lowerpanel, the effect of the double substitution (K9E/K107E) was assayed. To compare with accuracy the RNA binding activity of all the variants, the proteins recovered after the DE-52 elution step were assayed in Northwestern assays. As can be seen, the binding of the biotinylated probe produced an intense signal with wild type 3AB, whereas the K107E-3AB protein showed a drastic decrease in the RNA binding capability. No binding was detected either with the double mutant K9E/K107E-3AB, or with the wild type 3A protein. These results demonstrate that amino acid position 107 in 3AB is important for RNA binding activity. The results shown in Fig. 3B also suggest that, even though the amino acid substitution at position 9 (K9E) does not produce any effect by itself, this change seems to cause a synergistic effect on amino acid substitutions more than 100 residues apart in the 3AB molecule. Introduction of a positively charged residue at position 9 may alter the structure of the K107E-3AB protein, making it less active. This structural alteration may not take place with the natural residue (lysine) at position 107. Otherwise, a lysine at position 9 may form part of the RNA binding domain but play a minor role, only detectable if other important positions (e.g. amino acid 107) are altered. To assure that the differences observed with the biotinylated probes were reliable, the RNA binding activity of wild type and K107-3AB proteins were tested by a gel retardation assay with a 32P-labeled riboprobe (Fig. 3C). Incubation of the RNA probe with identical amounts of either wild type or K107E-3AB showed a different pattern for the RNA-protein complex. Thus, incubation with 1 μg of K107E-3AB gave place to an RNA-protein complex migrating slightly farther than the one observed with 1 μg of wild type protein. Higher concentrations of wild type protein produced a strong band corresponding to the retarded probe, whereas incubation with the mutant protein only elicited a weak retardation. These results corroborate the data presented in Fig. 3B demonstrating that the RNA binding activity is not completely abolished in the K107E-3AB mutant. No retardation was found either with 3A or with the K9E/K107E-3AB (data not shown). The following step was to ascertain how the RNA binding defects of 3AB affect the stimulatory activity on the viral polymerase.

https://openalex.org/W1991254111,"Pleckstrin is a 40-kDa protein present in platelets and leukocytes that contains two PH domains separated by a 150-residue intervening sequence. Pleckstrin is a major substrate for protein kinase C, but its function is unknown. The present studies examine the effects of pleckstrin on second messenger generation. When expressed in cos-1 or HEK-293 cells, pleckstrin inhibited 1) the Gα-mediated activation of phospholipase Cβ initiated by thrombin, M1-muscarinic acetylcholine, and angiotensin II receptors, 2) the stimulation of phospholipase Cβ by constitutively active Gqα, 3) the Gβγ-mediated activation of phospholipase Cβ caused by α2A-adrenergic receptors, and 4) the tyrosine phosphorylation-mediated activation of phospholipase Cγ caused by Trk A. However, pleckstrin had no effect on either the stimulation or inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. The inhibition of phosphoinositide hydrolysis caused by pleckstrin was similar in magnitude to that caused by activating protein kinase C with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). When combined, pleckstrin and PMA had an additive effect, inhibiting phosphoinositide hydrolysis by as much as 90%. Structure-function analysis highlighted the role of pleckstrin's N-terminal PH domain in these events. Although deleting the C-terminal PH domain had no effect, deleting the N-terminal PH domain abolished activity (but not expression) and mutating a highly conserved tryptophan residue within the N-terminal PH domain decreased activity by one-third. Notably, however, a pleckstrin variant in which the N-terminal PH domain was replaced with a second copy of the C-terminal PH domain was nearly as active as native pleckstrin. These results show that: 1) pleckstrin can inhibit pathways leading to both phospholipase Cβ- and phospholipase Cγ-mediated phosphoinositide hydrolysis, 2) this inhibition affects activation of phospholipase Cβ mediated by either Gα or Gβγ, but does not affect the regulation of adenylyl cyclase activity by Gα or Gβγ, 3) although pleckstrin is a substrate for protein kinase C, the effects of pleckstrin and PMA are at least partially independent, 4) the inhibition caused by pleckstrin appears to be mediated by the PH domain at the N terminus, rather than the C terminus of the molecule, and 5) location of the two PH domains within the molecule clearly contributes to their individual activity. These results do not appear to be readily attributable to an interaction between pleckstrin and Gβγ, but they are consistent with a recent report showing an association between PH domains and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate in vitro. Pleckstrin is a 40-kDa protein present in platelets and leukocytes that contains two PH domains separated by a 150-residue intervening sequence. Pleckstrin is a major substrate for protein kinase C, but its function is unknown. The present studies examine the effects of pleckstrin on second messenger generation. When expressed in cos-1 or HEK-293 cells, pleckstrin inhibited 1) the Gα-mediated activation of phospholipase Cβ initiated by thrombin, M1-muscarinic acetylcholine, and angiotensin II receptors, 2) the stimulation of phospholipase Cβ by constitutively active Gqα, 3) the Gβγ-mediated activation of phospholipase Cβ caused by α2A-adrenergic receptors, and 4) the tyrosine phosphorylation-mediated activation of phospholipase Cγ caused by Trk A. However, pleckstrin had no effect on either the stimulation or inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. The inhibition of phosphoinositide hydrolysis caused by pleckstrin was similar in magnitude to that caused by activating protein kinase C with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). When combined, pleckstrin and PMA had an additive effect, inhibiting phosphoinositide hydrolysis by as much as 90%. Structure-function analysis highlighted the role of pleckstrin's N-terminal PH domain in these events. Although deleting the C-terminal PH domain had no effect, deleting the N-terminal PH domain abolished activity (but not expression) and mutating a highly conserved tryptophan residue within the N-terminal PH domain decreased activity by one-third. Notably, however, a pleckstrin variant in which the N-terminal PH domain was replaced with a second copy of the C-terminal PH domain was nearly as active as native pleckstrin. These results show that: 1) pleckstrin can inhibit pathways leading to both phospholipase Cβ- and phospholipase Cγ-mediated phosphoinositide hydrolysis, 2) this inhibition affects activation of phospholipase Cβ mediated by either Gα or Gβγ, but does not affect the regulation of adenylyl cyclase activity by Gα or Gβγ, 3) although pleckstrin is a substrate for protein kinase C, the effects of pleckstrin and PMA are at least partially independent, 4) the inhibition caused by pleckstrin appears to be mediated by the PH domain at the N terminus, rather than the C terminus of the molecule, and 5) location of the two PH domains within the molecule clearly contributes to their individual activity. These results do not appear to be readily attributable to an interaction between pleckstrin and Gβγ, but they are consistent with a recent report showing an association between PH domains and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate in vitro. Proteins that are important in signal transduction often contain discrete domains that mediate intermolecular interactions. Well-characterized examples of this include SH2 domains, which interact with specific tyrosine-phosphorylated sequences, and SH3 domains, which interact with proline-rich amino acid sequences(1Koch C.A.

Recently, it has been proposed that the N and C termini of pleckstrin are the prototypes for a new family of molecular interaction domains referred to as pleckstrin homology or PH domains1 1The abbreviations used are: PH domainpleckstrin homology domainPMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetatehCGhuman chorionic gonadotropinLH receptorluteinizing hormone receptorPIPphosphatidylinositol 4-phosphatePIP2phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphateNGFnerve growth factor.

Pleckstrin is a 40-kDa protein present in platelets, lymphocytes, and neutrophils that is phosphorylated by protein kinase C during platelet activation(5Haslam R.J. Lynham J.A. Fox J.E.B. Biochem.

When first cloned in 1988, pleckstrin was shown to consist of 350 amino acid residues, with an internal homology between the first and last 100 residues(7Tyers M. Rachubinski R.A. Stewart M.I.

Recent sequence alignments have shown that regions similar to the two pleckstrin PH domains are present in more than 70 other proteins, many of which are involved in signal transduction, including Ras-GAP, Ras-GRF, SOS, and β-adrenergic receptor kinase(3Haslam R.J.

Although in general PH domain sequences vary considerably, a tryptophan that corresponds to Trp92 in the pleckstrin N-terminal PH domain appears to be absolutely conserved. The three-dimensional structures of the PH domains from β-spectrin, dynamin, and the N terminus of pleckstrin have been determined(11Yoon H.S. Hajduk P.J. Petros A.M. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P.

In each case, the PH domains are predicted to assume a barrel framework comprised of seven β-strands, with three projecting loops comprised of nonconserved residues. The conserved tryptophan residue is located in the α-helical cap at the base of the barrel. In the case of pleckstrin, two of these barrel-like PH domains are located at either end of the molecule, separated by an intervening 150-residue sequence whose structure has not been determined. pleckstrin homology domain phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate human chorionic gonadotropin luteinizing hormone receptor phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate nerve growth factor. The close conservation of three-dimensional structure among PH domains helps to establish that these domains are a valid structural motif, but does not reveal their function. Although the role of pleckstrin itself is unknown, it has been proposed that PH domains may mediate either protein-protein or protein-phospholipid interactions. An interaction with G-protein Gβγ heterodimers was initially suggested by the observation that the region in the β-adrenergic receptor kinase that binds Gβγ partially overlaps with the β-adrenergic receptor kinase's PH domain(8Musacchio A. Gibson T. Rice P. Thompson J. Saraste M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 343-348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). In support of this proposal, it was subsequently shown 1) that chimeric proteins containing PH domains fused to glutathione S-transferase can capture Gβγ from cell lysates (17Touhara K. Inglese J. Pitcher J.A. Shaw G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10217-10220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Tsukada S. Simon M.I. Witte O.N. Katz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Commun. 1994; 203: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and 2) that, when expressed in mammalian cells, PH domain-containing regions of β-adrenergic receptor kinase and Bruton's tyrosine kinase can inhibit the ability of Gβγ to regulate phospholipase Cβ and adenylyl cyclase(18Tsukada S. Simon M.I. Witte O.N. Katz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11256-11260Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 20Koch W.J. Hawes B.E. Inglese J. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6193-6197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, an alternative hypothesis was suggested by Fesik and co-workers (21Harlan J.E. Hajduk P.J. Yoon H.S. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1994; 371: 168-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar) who found that several PH domains, including those from pleckstrin, can associate with lipid micelles containing small amounts of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PIP) and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). Based upon these observations, they have proposed that PH domains target proteins to membrane phospholipids, particularly the phosphoinositides. Collectively, these studies suggest that in at least some proteins PH domains play a role in cell signaling, either by targeting Gβγ or membrane polyphosphoinositides. However, none of the studies specifically addresses the function of the prototypical PH domain protein, pleckstrin. Therefore, in the present studies, we have attempted, first, to define a role for pleckstrin and, second, to determine whether either of the two pleckstrin PH domains participate in that role. To do this, we have examined agonist-induced second messenger generation in cos-1 and HEK-293 cells co-expressing pleckstrin with a variety of G-protein-coupled or growth factor receptors or with constitutively active Gqα. The results show that pleckstrin can inhibit phosphoinositide hydrolysis mediated by both Gα and Gβγ, as well as phosphoinositide hydrolysis stimulated by the neuronal growth factor receptor, Trk A, but has no effect on G-protein-mediated stimulation or inhibition of cAMP formation. These results are distinct from those obtained with β-adrenergic receptor kinase and Bruton's tyrosine kinase and do not appear to be readily attributable to an interaction between pleckstrin and Gβγ. DNA encoding full-length human pleckstrin was generated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction from HL60 mRNA with the following primers: ggcggcaagcttccagctgctgagaggagt and ggcggcggatccttacttcccagttcggga. The primers incorporated a HindIII and BamHI site that facilitated cloning into pCMV5. The C-terminal PH deletion variant (pleckstrin Δ246-350) was generated using the primers: ggcggcaagcttccagctgctgagaggagt and ggcggcggatccctatctgaattcttctttcag. The N-terminal PH deletion variant (pleckstrin Δ6-99) was generated by the technique of splice overlap extension and the mutagenesis primers ccaaagcggattaaatgcattgaagga and gcatttaatccgctttggttccatgct(22Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6830) Google Scholar). The W92R variant was generated using the mutagenesis primer ggaggagagagatgccagggttcgggat and the technique of Landt et al.(23Landt O. Grunert H.-P. Hahn U. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 96: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). The cDNA sequences of all clones were fully confirmed and inserted into pCMV5. A cDNA fragment containing the human thrombin receptor was isolated from a HEL cell cDNA library and inserted into the expression vector, pRK7. Other cDNAs used in this study were generous gifts from the following sources: M1-muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, Dr. Ernest Peralta (Harvard University, Boston, MA); angiotensin II type AT1A receptor, Dr. Steven Fluharty (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA); α2A-adrenergic receptor, Dr. Robert Lefkowitz (Duke University, Durham, NC); constitutively activated Gqα variant with a hemagglutinin epitope tag (HA-GqαQ209L), Dr. J. Silvio Gutkind (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD); luteinizing hormone (LH/hCG) receptor, Dr. Dolan Pritchett (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA); high affinity NGF receptor (Trk A), Dr. Luis Parada (University of Texas, South Western Medical Center, Dallas, TX). Two 100-mm tissue culture plates of cos-1 cells were transfected using DEAE-dextran (24Morris J.F. Madden S.L. Tournay O.E. Cook D.M. Sukatme V.P. Rauscher F.J. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 2339-2348PubMed Google Scholar) with either a receptor or GqαQ209L plus pCMV5 containing either 1) no insert, 2) wild type pleckstrin, 3) Trp92-Arg variant pleckstrin, 4) pleckstrin Δ6-99, 5) pleckstrin Δ246-350 or 6) a pleckstrin variant containing two copies of the C-terminal PH domain. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were trypsinized, and the duplicate plates were pooled. The cells were divided equally into eight 60-mm tissue culture plates. [3H]Inositol (4 μCi/ml, ICN) was added to six of the plates, then all of the cells were incubated at 37° C for 18 h. The unlabeled cells were used to assess protein expression. Forty eight hours after transfection, the six [3H]inositol-labeled plates were divided into three sets of duplicates which were extracted with perchloric acid either under resting conditions, after stimulation by thrombin (2 units/ml) for 45 min, or after preincubation with 50-100 nM PMA for 5 min followed by stimulation with thrombin, all in the presence of 20 mM LiCl. In other experiments, carbachol (100 μM), angiotensin II (1 μM), UK14304 (10 μM), or NGF (100 ng/ml) was used as the agonist. The neutralized extracts were applied to Dowex 1 columns, which were washed sequentially with 5 mM inositol and 5 mM sodium tetraborate, 60 mM ammonium formate. Total [3H]inositol phosphate was eluted with 0.1 M formic acid plus 1.5 M ammonium formate and quantitated by scintillation counting. Cyclic AMP production was determined as described by Shimizu et al.(25Shimizu H. Daly J.W. Creveling C.R. J. Neurochem. 1969; 16: 1609-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Briefly, cos-1 or HEK-293 cells were transfected with α2A-adrenergic receptors and LH/hCG receptors as described above, and 24 h later were trypsinized and divided equally into 24-well plates. After being incubated for an additional 18 h, duplicate wells were labeled for 2 h with 2 μCi of [3H]adenine (DuPont NEN). The cells were stimulated with LH and/or UK14304 for 30 min, either with or without 5 min of prior exposure to 100 nM PMA in the presence of 1 mM isobutylmethylxanthine. The reactions were stopped with 1 ml of ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid, and the [3H]cAMP and [3H]ATP in the supernatant were separated by Dowex and alumina chromatography. cAMP production was quantitated by scintillation counting and expressed as % conversion: ([3H]cAMP × 100)/([3H]cAMP + [3H]ATP). Pleckstrin expression was confirmed by Western blotting of cell lysates after polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in SDS using a rabbit polyclonal antiserum (number 354) raised against a recombinant protein corresponding to pleckstrin residues Glu104-Asp233. Trk A and HA-GqαQ209L expression were measured by Western blotting with antibodies SC11 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 12CA5 (Boehringer Mannheim), respectively. Thrombin receptor expression was confirmed by flow cytometry using antibody ATAP2, a peptide-directed monoclonal antibody that binds to the N terminus of the human thrombin receptor and recognizes both the cleaved and intact forms of the receptor(26Brass L.F. Vassallo Jr., R.R. Belmonte E. Ahuja M. Cichowski K. Hoxie J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13795-13798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Highly purified human thrombin was a gift from Dr. John Fenton (New York Public Health Service, Albany, NY). Other agonists and materials were obtained from the following: hCG and NGF (Boehringer Mannheim) and UK14304 (Research Biochemical Inc., Natick, MA). All other reagents were from Sigma. When platelets are activated by most agonists, including thrombin, pleckstrin becomes phosphorylated by protein kinase C(5Haslam R.J. Lynham J.A. Fox J.E.B. Biochem. J. 1979; 178: 397-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 27Jenkins A.L. Bootman M.D. Berridge M.J. Stone S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17104-17110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since thrombin-induced phosphoinositide hydrolysis is mediated by a G-protein-coupled receptor (28Vu T.-K.H. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 1057-1068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2673) Google Scholar) and involves two of the molecules that have been proposed as binding partners for PH domains, Gβγ and PIP2, we started by asking whether the presence of pleckstrin would affect signaling initiated by thrombin. Because pleckstrin is a substrate for protein kinase C, the effects of pleckstrin were compared in the presence and absence of the phorbol ester, PMA, which has been shown to acutely inhibit agonist-induced phosphoinositide hydrolysis in a variety of cells, including platelets(29Watson S.P. Lapetina E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 2623-2626Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 30Zavoico G.B. Halenda S.P. Shaafi R.I. Feinstein M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This effect has been variously attributed to the phosphorylation of receptors, Gα and phospholipase C(32Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. Cotecchia S. Lomasney J.W. DeBernardis J.F. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G.

Cos-1 cells, which normally do not express pleckstrin, were transfected with either plasmids encoding the human thrombin receptor alone or the thrombin receptor plus full-length human pleckstrin. Initial studies showed that thrombin caused a small increase in [3H]inositol phosphate formation in nontransfected cos-1 cells and a much larger increase in cells transfected with the thrombin receptor. This response was minimally affected by a 16-h incubation with 100 ng/ml pertussis toxin, suggesting that it is due to phospholipase Cβ activation mediated by a member of the Gq family rather than Gi (data not shown). In the studies shown in Fig. 1, total [3H]inositol phosphate formation was assayed in cells that were incubated with thrombin either with or without prior exposure to PMA. Thrombin receptor expression was determined by flow cytometry using the receptor-directed monoclonal antibody, ATAP2(26Brass L.F. Vassallo Jr., R.R. Belmonte E. Ahuja M. Cichowski K. Hoxie J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13795-13798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pleckstrin expression was measured using a polyclonal antibody directed at the entire intervening sequence between the two PH domains. In the absence of PMA or pleckstrin, thrombin increased [3H]inositol phosphate levels by 3- to 4-fold (Fig. 1A). Co-expression of pleckstrin decreased thrombin-induced [3H]inositol phosphate formation by 33 ± 3% compared with cells transfected with the receptor alone (Fig. 1B). Preincubating the cells with PMA inhibited [3H]inositol phosphate formation by 38 ± 1% in the absence of pleckstrin and by 81 ± 2% in the presence of pleckstrin. Similar results were obtained with HEK-293 cells (not shown). These effects of pleckstrin were not due to a decrease in the level of thrombin receptor expression, which was the same in the presence or absence of pleckstrin, nor were they due simply to the presence of a second expressed protein (see below). Therefore, these results suggest that pleckstrin, like PMA, inhibits thrombin-induced phosphoinositide hydrolysis. Furthermore, since the inhibitory effects of pleckstrin and PMA were additive, they are presumably at least partly independent of each other. In order to determine whether the inhibitory effects of pleckstrin are limited to thrombin responses, similar studies were performed with cos-1 cells expressing M1-muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, angiotensin II type AT1A receptors, or α2A-adrenergic receptors. For the first two receptors, phosphoinositide hydrolysis was unaffected by pertussis toxin, suggesting that it is mediated by a member of the Gq family. Phosphoinositide hydrolysis in response to the α2A-adrenergic receptor agonist, UK14304, on the other hand, was inhibited approximately 90% by pertussis toxin, suggesting that it is due to phospholipase Cβ activation mediated by Gβγ derived from Gi (not shown). In the studies shown in Fig. 2, each of the receptors was tested in the presence and absence of pleckstrin. In all cases, pleckstrin inhibited [3H]inositol phosphate formation, as did PMA, and the combination was additive. The extent of inhibition varied. Angiotensin II and UK14304, like thrombin, were inhibited by as much as 90% by the pleckstrin-PMA combination, but the response to carbachol was inhibited by only 42%. Thus, taken together, the data in Figure 1:, Figure 2: show that pleckstrin inhibits phosphoinositide hydrolysis initiated by at least four different G-protein-coupled receptors and affects both Gα- and Gβγ-mediated activation of phospholipase C. To further explore the mechanism by which pleckstrin inhibits phosphoinositide hydrolysis, additional experiments were performed in which phospholipase C was stimulated with a constitutively active form of Gqα, bypassing the involvement of a receptor. In these studies, cos-1 cells were transfected with a Gqα variant in which the substitution of leucine for Glu209 inhibits GTPase activity(36Kalinec G. Nazarali A.J. Hermouet S. Xu N. Gutkind J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4687-4693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2687) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, GqαQ209L stimulated phospholipase C activity, raising total [3H]inositol phosphate levels 15-20-fold above those present in mock-transfected cells. This increase was only minimally affected by PMA, either because the effects of PMA are receptor-dependent or because protein kinase C is already maximally stimulated by the diacylglycerol produced from constitutive breakdown of the phosphoinositides. On the other hand, pleckstrin inhibited GqαQ209L-induced [3H]inositol phosphate formation by 40% in the absence of PMA and by 55% in the presence of PMA. These differences were not attributable to differences in the level of GqαQ209L expression, which was the same in the presence or absence of pleckstrin (Fig. 3C). This result suggests that the inhibition of phosphoinositide hydrolysis by pleckstrin occurs at or below the level of G-proteins in the signal transduction cascade. To investigate whether pleckstrin also affects other signaling events mediated by G-protein-coupled receptors, cAMP formation was measured in cos-1 and HEK-293 cells expressing LH receptors and α2A-adrenergic receptors. LH receptors are coupled to Gs and stimulate adenylyl cyclase(38McFarland K.C. Sprengel R. Phillips H.S. Köhler M. Rosemblit N. Nikolics K. Segaloff D.L. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1989; 245: 494-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar), while α2A-adrenergic receptors inhibit cAMP formation via one or more members of the Gi family(20Koch W.J. Hawes B.E. Inglese J. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6193-6197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Chabre O. Conklin B.R. Brandon S. Bourne H.R. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5730-5734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In cells expressing the LH receptor, hCG caused a marked increase in cAMP formation (Fig. 4A). This increase was unaffected by either pleckstrin or PMA. Pleckstrin and PMA also had no effect on the suppression of cAMP formation seen in cells co-expressing LH and α2A-adrenergic receptors (Fig. 4B). Taken together, these results show that pleckstrin affects G-protein-mediated regulation of phosphoinositide hydrolysis, but not G-protein-mediated regulation of cAMP formation. The data described thus far focus on pathways that activate phospholipase Cβ. To determine whether pleckstrin also affects phosphoinositide hydrolysis by phospholipase Cγ, cos-1 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding the high affinity NGF receptor, Trk A, either alone or with pleckstrin. As is shown in Fig. 5A, NGF had no effect on [3H]inositol phosphate formation in mock-transfected cells, but caused a 1.7-fold increase in cos-1 cells expressing Trk A, a response similar to that previously reported in PC12 cells(40Contreras M.L. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 1035-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Pleckstrin inhibited this increase by 55%, while having no effect on Trk A expression (Fig. 5, B and C). This suggests that pleckstrin can inhibit phospholipase Cγ, as well as phospholipase Cβ. However, earlier studies have shown that some growth factor receptors can stimulate phosphoinositide hydrolysis through a pertussis toxin-sensitive mechanism, implying that in addition to activating phospholipase Cγ by direct phosphorylation some growth factors activate phosphoinositide hydrolysis via Gβγ (41Liang M.

Under conditions in which pertussis toxin inhibited UK14304-induced phosphoinositide hydrolysis by 90% (data not shown), the response to NGF was inhibited by 51%. The combination of pleckstrin and pertussis toxin had an even greater effect (91% inhibition), showing that pleckstrin can inhibit the portion of the NGF stimulation of phospholipase C that is not mediated by a pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein. To begin the process of understanding the structural basis for the inhibition of phosphoinositide hydrolysis by pleckstrin, two variants of pleckstrin were prepared in which either the complete N-terminal PH domain (Δ6-99) or the complete C-terminal PH domain (Δ246-350) was deleted.

Mutation of residues 210-212 from lysines to either glutamates or threonines abolished DNA binding. The Lys210-Thr211-Lys212 and Thr210-Th4211-Lys212 variants displayed reduced affinity for DNA, especially at higher ionic strength. Limited acetylation of rACT with acetic anhydride led to loss of DNA binding and, conversely, DNA protected rACT from acetylation. A combination of CNBr digestion, peptide separation, and peptide sequencing identified Lys396, two residues from the C terminus, as the most reactive lysine in rACT. Acetylation of Lys396 is strongly decreased in the presence of DNA. The double mutant K391T/K396T-rACT had very little affinity for DNA. The ε-amines of lysines 210-212 are 8-15 Å across a cleft from the ε-amines in Lys391 and Lys396, and together these two elements may form an unusual DNA binding domain. Attempts to isolate a DNA sequence to which ACT binds specifically have been unsuccessful to date, raising the possibility that nonspecific binding of ACT to DNA suffices to account for the ACT found in certain cell nuclei.

In this study, another cDNA (∼4.0 kilobase (kb)) encoding a cGI-PDE of 74 kDa (658 amino acids) was isolated from a human placental cDNA library. The nucleotide sequence of its open reading frame was virtually identical to a corresponding region in the 3′ portion of the cardiac cGIP2 cDNA (∼7.6 kb) which encoded a ∼125-kDa cGI-PDE (1141 amino acid). Northern blots and RNase protection assays revealed a prominent 4.4-kb transcript and a 7.6-kb transcript in human placenta. The transcription start site of the 4.4-kb transcript was assigned to cardiac cDNA nucleotide 1292, the putative beginning of exon 3 of the human cGIP2 gene, with a potential translation initiation site 183 bases downstream, as determined by RNase protection assay. The 5′-flanking region of the 4.4-kb transcript exhibited promoter activity in HeLa cells which expressed the 4.4-kb transcript, and contained a TATAA sequence 35 base pairs upstream from the tentative transcription start site. Recombinant cGI-PDEs, expressed in Sf9 cells from the 7.6- and 4.0-kb cDNA, exhibited differences in their subcellular localization and Km for cGMP. Thus, in human tissues, alternative transcription may contribute to generating at least two cGIP2 isoforms, cytosolic and membrane-associated cGI-PDEs with different Kmvalues for cGMP."

Each isoenzyme has eight β-glucosyl-binding subsites. The catalytic amino acids are located between the third and fourth subsite from the nonreducing terminus of the substrate. Negative binding energies in subsites adjacent to the hydrolyzed glycosidic linkage suggest that some substrate distortion may occur in this region during binding and that the resultant strain induced in the substrate might facilitate hydrolytic cleavage.

DNA gyrase is a type II DNA topoisomerase that catalyzes the negative supercoiling of DNA in prokaryotes, and its function is essential for cell growth. The enzyme is implicated in the process of DNA replication, transcription, and recombination and in a number of other cellular processes(1Gellert M. Annu. Rev.

DNA gyrase from Escherichia coli consists of two subunits, A and B, with molecular masses of 97,000 and 90,000 Da, respectively. The active enzyme is an A2B2 tetramer complex. The mechanism of DNA supercoiling by gyrase involves the wrapping of a segment of DNA around a protein core, cleavage of this DNA, and passage of another piece of DNA through the double-stranded break, which is then rejoined(4Reece R.J. Maxwell A. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 26: 335-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). The reaction cycle normally requires the hydrolysis of ATP. However, replacement of ATP by a nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue, ADPNP,1 1The abbreviations used are: ADPNP5′-adenylyl-β-γ-imidodiphosphateATPγSadenosine-5′-O-(thiotriphosphate)HPLChigh performance liquid chromatography. results in limited supercoiling by gyrase, suggesting that ATP binding can promote a single round of supercoiling, but that the hydrolysis step is required to regenerate the enzyme in its active form(5Sugino A.

The A subunit contains the site of the DNA breakage and rejoining of the DNA supercoiling, while the B subunit contains the site of ATP hydrolysis. Both subunits are thought to consist of two distinct functional domains. A subunit contains an N-terminal domain (58-64 kDa), thought to be involved in the DNA breakage-rejoining reactions, and a C-terminal domain involved in the DNA-subunit interactions(6Reece R.J.

Cyclothialidine contains a unique 12-membered lactone ring that is partly integrated into a pentapeptide chain(21Kamiyama T. Shimma N. Ohtsuka T. Nakayama N. Itezono Y. Nakada N. Watanabe J. Yokose K. J. Antibiotics. 1994; 47: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Cyclothialidine exhibited the highest inhibitory activity against DNA gyrases from several bacterial species, including Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, with high selectivity in its biological activity(22Nakada N. Shimada H. Hirata T. Aoki Y. Kamiyama T. Watanabe J. Arisawa M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1993; 37: 2656-2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Our previous studies (23Nakada N. Gmünder H. Hirata T. Arisawa M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 1966-1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) indicated that cyclothialidine inhibits, under steady-state conditions, the ATPase activity of E. coli DNA gyrase competitively with a Ki of 6 nM. Therefore, cyclothialidine, being a B subunit inhibitor of DNA gyrase, shows the same mode of action as the coumarin antibiotics novobiocin and coumermycin A1. However, cyclothialidine was also active against a DNA gyrase resistant to novobiocin, suggesting that the residues required for novobiocin binding are not involved in cyclothialidine binding. In addition, there is no obvious structural resemblance among cyclothialidine, novobiocin, and ATP (Fig. 1). Here, we report on a further characterization of the DNA gyrase-mediated ATPase activity by cyclothialidine. We performed [14C]benzoylcyclothialidine binding experiments to correlate the inhibition of the ATPase activity of DNA gyrase by cyclothialidine with binding of the compound to the B subunit. We also compared the binding of cyclothialidine with that of coumarin antibiotics and ATP analogues. For these studies we used a reconstituted E. coli DNA gyrase system that contained the A subunit, the B subunit, and relaxed ColE1 plasmid DNA.

The fraction containing the gyrase A subunit, after it had been subjected to valine-Sepharose chromatography, still contained minor amounts of the gyrase B subunit. Therefore, the fraction was applied to a novobiocin-Sepharose column, as described by Staudenbauer and Orr(25Staudenbauer W.L. Orr E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 3589-3603Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), and the flow-through fraction was collected. The gyrase B subunit was eluted from a hydroxylapatite column. Each sample was stored in 25 mM Hepes-KOH (pH 8.0) containing 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.2 mM EDTA, and 50% (w/v) ethylene glycol at −70°C. Purified A subunit was judged to be >90% pure by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; similarly, the purified B subunit was >95% pure. Gyrase activity was measured using a standard supercoiling assay(26Otter R. Cozzarelli N.R. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 100: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). One unit was defined as the minimum amount of reconstituted gyrase that will maximally supercoil 0.5 μg of relaxed ColE1 DNA at 30°C in 30 min. The specific activities of the A subunit and B subunit were 6.4 × 105 units/mg and 1.2 × 105 units/mg, respectively. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay using bovine serum albumin as the standard. The 43-kDa protein was purified from E. coli cells containing plasmid pAJ1 essentially as described by Jackson et al.(27Jackson A.P. Maxwell A. Wigley D.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 15-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown at 37°C in LB broth containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin to an OD595 of 0.5 and induced for 4 h by the addition of isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside to 50 μM. Cells were harvested and resuspended at a concentration of 1 g/ml in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 10% sucrose. The cell suspension was adjusted to 1 μg/ml RNase, 1 μg/ml DNase, and 20 μg/ml lysozyme and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were disrupted at 60 megapascals using a French press and centrifuged at 100,000 × gav for 60 min at 4°C. Cell extracts were dialyzed against 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and applied to a DEAE-Sepharose CL 6B column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). After washing with 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), the column was eluted with a 100-ml linear gradient of 0.0-0.7 M NaCl in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Fractions containing the 43-kDa protein were identified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, pooled, dialyzed against 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and loaded onto an FPLC Mono Q HR 10/10 column (Pharmacia). After washing the column with 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), we eluted the 43-kDa protein with a 160-ml linear gradient of 0.0-0.4 M NaCl in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Fractions containing the protein fragment were identified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, pooled, and dialyzed against 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mM KCl, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EDTA, 10% (w/v) glycerol, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C(28Bates A.D. Maxwell A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1861-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). [14C]Benzoylcyclothialidine-The [14C]benzoylcyclothialidine was prepared by the reaction of cyclothialidine with [14C]benzoic acid (21.8 mCi/mmol) in the presence of N,N′-disuccinimidyl carbonate in acetonitrile/pyridine (1:1) having >98% purity. The labeled compound has a specific activity of 21.8 mCi/mmol. Its mobilities on TLC and HPLC are identical to those of authentic benzoyl-cyclothialidine. Benzoyl-cyclothialidine has almost the same inhibitory activity against E. coli DNA gyrase as cyclothialidine in the DNA supercoiling assay (results not shown). [14C]Benzoylcyclothialidine Binding Experiment-The binding of [14C]benzoylcyclothialidine was determined by a centrifugal filtration method(13Shen L.L. Pernet A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 307-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Centrifree micropartition devices (Amicon number 4103) were used to separate [14C]benzoylcyclothialidine bound to DNA gyrase from the free ligand. Reactions (400 μl) were carried out similar to that of the supercoiling assay but without the addition of ATP; the reaction mixture contained an appropriate amount of DNA gyrase and radioactive ligand in standard buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 20 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM dithiothreitol). After incubation for 30 min at 30°C, the mixtures were transferred to the centrifree devices and centrifuged at 1,600 × g in a Kubota KR-180B (swinging bucket rotor) for 30 min at 4°C. The membrane disks and o-rings of the centrifree devices were placed in vials with 1 ml of standard buffer. The vials were shaken on a rotary shaker for 2 h for solubilization of the [14C]benzoylcyclothialidine. Then 15 ml of liquid scintillation fluid (toluene-ethanol (1:1), 0.7% [2-(4-tert-butylphenyl)5-(4′-biphenylyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole]) was added per vial for the measurement of radioactivity. For the determination of nonspecific ligand binding, the assay was run with excess cyclothialidine. The amount of bound ligand was calculated after subtracting the nonspecific bound radioactivity. ATPase assays were carried out at 25°C in the following: 300 μl in 40 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 25 mM KCl, 2.5 mM spermidine, 4 mM MgCl2 with phosphoenolpyruvate and NADH at 400 and 250 μM, respectively, and 3 μl of pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase mix (in ammonium sulfate solution, 3.2 M)(8Ali J.A. Jackson A.P. Howells A.J. Maxwell A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2717-2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The ATP was added at concentrations from 0.5 to 3.5 mM; the 43-kDa N-terminal fragment of the DNA gyrase B subunit at a concentration of 5 μM; and cyclothialidine at concentrations from 0.025 to 10 μM. Reactions were initiated by the addition of the protein, and the decrease in A340 was continuously measured as a function of time (up to 10 min). The change in absorbance was related to ADP production using ε339 nm = 5100, with the production of NADH stoichiometrically related to the amount of ADP released. [14C]Benzoylcyclothialidine Binds to the 43-kDa N-terminal Fragment of the B Subunit-Our previous studies have shown (23Nakada N. Gmünder H. Hirata T. Arisawa M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 1966-1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) that, under steady-state conditions, cyclothialidine competitively inhibits the ATPase activity of the E. coli DNA gyrase B subunit with a Kivalue of 6 nM and that [14C]benzoyl-cyclothialidine binds to the DNA gyrase holoenzyme (A2B2 tetramer) in the absence of DNA. This binding is inhibited by cyclothialidine, novobiocin, and the ATP analogue ATPγS, but it is not inhibited by ofloxacin, strongly suggesting that cyclothialidine inhibits the binding of ATP to the gyrase by acting on the B subunit. However, it is not yet known whether the binding of [14C]benzoylcyclothialidine requires both subunits of the DNA gyrase or only the B subunit and what effect DNA has on the binding. To investigate these aspects more precisely, we studied [14C]benzoylcyclothialidine binding by using a system of reconstituted E. coli gyrase subunits plus relaxed ColE1 DNA and also the 43-kDa N-terminal fragment of the B subunit. The binding experiments were carried out by a centrifugal filtration technique. The results of the binding studies of [14C]benzoylcyclothialidine to the gyrase subunits and to the plasmid DNA are shown in Fig. 2. There was significant binding of the compound to the B subunit but not to the A subunit nor to the relaxed ColE1 plasmid DNA. Furthermore, the compound bound to the 43-kDa N-terminal fragment of the B subunit, showing that the binding site of cyclothialidine as well as that for the coumarin antibiotics is located within the 43-kDa N-terminal fragment. Next, to study whether the binding of [14C]benzoylcyclothialidine depends only on the presence of the B subunit alone, we performed our binding experiments in the presence of 1) the B subunit, 2) the B subunit plus A subunit, and 3) the B subunit plus the A subunit plus plasmid DNA. The amount of [14C]benzoylcyclothialidine bound to the B subunit was somewhat higher in the presence of the A subunit and even higher in the presence of the A subunit plus plasmid DNA (data not shown). When a 250-fold excess of unlabeled cyclothialidine was added, the amount of [14C]benzoylcyclothialidine bound to the B subunit decreased to the level where it could hardly be detected under all conditions (data not shown). We confirmed that [14C]benzoylcyclothialidine reversibly binds to the B subunit even in the presence of the A subunit and plasmid DNA. To study the binding of [14C]benzoyl-cyclothialidine to the B subunit further, including the effect of the A subunit and plasmid DNA on the binding, we performed Scatchard analysis for the four conditions. The results in Fig. 3 show that the [14C]benzoylcyclothialidine bound to the B subunit in the presence of the 43-kDa fragment with a Kd value of 2.5 ± 0.40 × 10−8 M; in the presence of the B subunit with a value of 2.4 ± 0.10 × 10−8 M; in the presence of the B subunit plus the A subunit with a value of 1.5 ± 0.31 × 10−8 M; and in the presence of the B subunit plus the A subunit plus plasmid DNA with a value of 8.3 ± 0.12 × 10−9 M. This result suggests that the binding affinity of the compound to the B subunit is dependent on the stage of the assembly of the gyrase·DNA complex. The lowest binding affinity to the B subunit could be observed in the presence of the B subunit alone, and the highest binding affinity could be observed in the presence of the A2B2·DNA complex (increase in affinity: B → A2B2 → A2B2·DNA), although the binding capacity (Bmax) remained invariant, with approximately 1 pmol of [14C]benzoylcyclothialidine bound per pmol of the B subunit. Although the structures are different (Fig. 1), cyclothialidine proved to be similar to novobiocin and coumermycin A1 in their inhibition of the DNA-dependent ATPase activity of DNA gyrase. Furthermore, there are no structural similarities between ATP and cyclothialidine. Therefore, to investigate whether the binding site for cyclothialidine on the B subunit is different from that for ATP and for the coumarin antibiotics, we examined the effects of nonlabeled cyclothialidine, ADPNP, ATPγS, noboviocin, and coumermycin A1 on the binding of [14C]benzoylcyclothialidine to the 43-kDa N-terminal fragment of the B subunit, to the B subunit alone, and to the B subunit in the presence of the A subunit or in the presence of the A subunit and DNA. The results are shown in Fig. 4 and Table I. The displacement curves of [14C]benzoyl-cyclothialidine binding obtained after the addition of cyclothialidine had almost the same profiles, with IC50 values of 8.4 × 10−8 M for the 43-kDa protein, 9.3 × 10−8 M for the B subunit, 1.0 × 10−7 M for the B subunit plus A subunit, and 8.1 × 10−8M for the B subunit plus the A subunit plus plasmid DNA, respectively. However, the displacement curves induced by ADPNP were surprisingly quite different from those induced by cyclothialidine and critically depended on the form of the B subunit present. The relative inhibitory activity of ADPNP is as follows: B subunit plus A subunit plus DNA > B subunit plus A subunit > B subunit > 43-kDa N-terminal fragment, with IC50 values of 8.0 × 10−4 M, 4.5 × 10−3 M, 1.5 × 10−2 M, and >1.5 × 10−2 M, respectively. The IC50 value of ADPNP for the A2B2·DNA complex is 19-fold lower than that for the B subunit alone, and similar results were obtained with ATPγS and coumarin antibiotics (). The coumarin antibiotic coumermycin A1, for example, inhibited [14C]benzoyl-cyclothialidine binding in the order B subunit plus A subunit plus DNA > B subunit plus A subunit > B subunit > 43-kDa N-terminal fragment, with IC50 values of 9.5 × 10−8 M, 1.8 × 10−7, 2.4 × 10−7, and 6.3 × 10−7 M, respectively. The IC50 value for the A2B2·DNA complex is 6.6-fold lower than that for only the 43-kDa N-terminal protein.Table ICompetition of substrate analogues and gyrase inhibitors for [14C]benzoylcyclothialidine bindingTable ICompetition of substrate analogues and gyrase inhibitors for [14C]benzoylcyclothialidine binding Furthermore, Scatchard analysis of the competitive binding of ADPNP and novobiocin to the B subunit plus the A subunit were also carried out (Fig. 5). Although the slope of the Scatchard plot decreased in the presence of ADPNP and was dependent on its concentration, the binding capacity (Bmax) remained invariant. The same result was obtained with novobiocin. These observations suggest that ATP and coumarin antibiotics competitively inhibit the binding of [14C]benzoyl-cyclothialidine to the B subunit. The 43-kDa N-terminal fragment of the DNA gyrase B subunit hydrolyzes ATP and binds novobiocin and coumermycin A1(8Ali J.A. Jackson A.P. Howells A.J. Maxwell A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2717-2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). We showed that cyclothialidine binds to the B subunit and inhibits the ATPase activity of DNA gyrase(23Nakada N. Gmünder H. Hirata T. Arisawa M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 1966-1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To test whether cyclothialidine also inhibits the ATPase activity of the 43-kDa N-terminal fragment of the DNA gyrase B subunit, we determined its inhibitory activity in steady-state kinetic experiments. Cyclothialidine was included in the ATPase assay, and the results indicate that cyclothialidine is indeed an inhibitor of the ATPase activity of this N-terminal fragment of the B subunit (Fig. 6). The Vmax(app) values decrease with increasing drug concentrations, indicating that cyclothialidine is not a simple competitive inhibitor. The calculated Km(app) (mM ATP) and Vmax(app) (nM ADP/μM 43 kDa × s) from these data are as follows: 2.1 mM and 30.0 nM/μM × s for no cyclothialidine, 2.1 mM and 26.7 nM/μM × s for 1 μM cyclothialidine, and 2.4 mM and 17.4 nM/μM × s for 5 μM cyclothialidine. The values determined for the ATPase activity of the 43-kDa protein in the presence of novobiocin are Km(app) = 0.68 mM and Vmax(app) 18.5 nM/μM × s for no novobiocin and Km(app) = 0.51 mM and Vmax(app) = 10.5 nM/μM × s for 6 μM novobiocin(8Ali J.A. Jackson A.P. Howells A.J. Maxwell A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2717-2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). These results are consistent with the results of the displacement of the [14C]benzoyl-cyclothialidine binding by the compounds, shown in Fig. 4, B and C, in that the binding of the labeled compound to the 43-kDa N-terminal fragment of the B subunit is hardly inhibited by the ATP analogues ADPNP and ATPγS. The characterization of the mode of inhibition of DNA gyrase by cyclothialidine promises to yield important information on the mechanism of DNA supercoiling and especially on the role of the ATPase activity of DNA gyrase during this process, since we have shown that cyclothialidine inhibits the ATPase activity of the B subunit. One possible means of characterizing the mode of inhibition would be to study the binding of [14C]benzoylcyclothialidine to the reconstituted E. coli DNA gyrase with the centrifugal filtration method. Our data presented here (Fig. 2) show that [14C]benzoyl-cyclothialidine binds to the B subunit alone and also to the 43-kDa N-terminal fragment of this subunit. Scatchard analysis, carried out with the reconstituted gyrase subunits plus DNA (Fig. 3 and) showed that the affinity (Kd value) for the binding of [14C]benzoylcyclothialidine to the B subunit depended on the association state of the gyrase·DNA complex (increasing affinity: B → A2B2 → A2B2· DNA). This suggests that the B subunit undergoes conformational changes as it becomes part of the complete gyrase·DNA complex. The affinity of cyclothialidine (Kd = 8.3 ± 0.12 × 10−9 M) with the binding site on the gyrase·DNA complex (A2B2·DNA) was also in good agreement with the inhibition of the DNA-dependent ATPase activity of gyrase (Ki = 6 × 10−9 M). Therefore, there is a close correlation of the inhibition of the ATPase activity of gyrase by cyclothialidine with the amount of [14C]benzoylcyclothialidine bound to the B subunit in the gyrase·DNA complex. Furthermore, our observations agreed well with the “model of ATP hydrolysis by DNA gyrase” as described by Maxell and Gellert (29Maxwell A. Gellert M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14472-14480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in which they say that ATP hydrolysis requires the binding of DNA to two sites on the enzyme and that when both DNA binding sites on the enzyme are occupied by DNA the enzyme is proposed to undergo a conformational change whereby it becomes an active ATPase. It is possible that the conformation of the ATP binding site is changed more dramatically than those for cyclothialidine and for the coumarin antibiotics (Fig. 4). The mechanism of inhibition of DNA gyrase by cyclothialidine may be almost the same as those by coumarin antibiotics(23Nakada N. Gmünder H. Hirata T. Arisawa M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 1966-1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, two important differences were observed between cyclothialidine and coumarin antibiotics. 1) Cyclothialidine is much more selective toward DNA gyrase than are coumarin antibiotics(22Nakada N. Shimada H. Hirata T. Aoki Y. Kamiyama T. Watanabe J. Arisawa M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1993; 37: 2656-2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). 2) Cyclothialidine is active against a DNA gyrase isolated from a novobiocin-resistant E. coli gyrB mutant strain(23Nakada N. Gmünder H. Hirata T. Arisawa M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 1966-1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Furthermore, our data presented in Fig. 4 and showed that the profile of displacement curves of [14C]benzoylcyclothialidine binding induced by ADPNP or coumermycin A1 were significantly different from that induced by nonlabeled cyclothialidine. However, from the Scatchard analysis for the competition studies shown in Fig. 5, ADPNP and novobiocin competitively inhibited the binding of [14C]benzoylcyclothialidine to the B subunit in the A2B2 form. These results suggest that cyclothialidine, coumarin antibiotics, and ATP share a common (or overlapping) site of action on the B subunit of DNA gyrase; however, the microenvironment of the binding sites may differ. Maxwell et al. described (8Ali J.A. Jackson A.P. Howells A.J. Maxwell A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2717-2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) that the ADPNP inhibition against the ATPase activity of the 43-kDa fragment is different from those of ADP and novobiocin because in the presence of ADPNP the protein behaves as a dimer whereas in the presence of ADP or novobiocin the enzyme is a monomer. The result shown in Fig. 6 also might reflect the artifactual nature of the protein fragment, because in the subunit structure of A2B2·DNA cyclothialidine competitively inhibits the ATPase activity of DNA gyrase. It is possible that the differential competition seen with the 43-kDa fragment of the B subunit is due to the effects of cyclothialidine and coumarin antibiotics on the dimerization of the protein fragments. As shown in Fig. 4, the inhibition by nonlabeled cyclothialidine of [14C]benzoylcyclothialidine binding to each B subunit form (B, A2B2, and A2B2·DNA) is essentially the same in each case. These findings are reasonable because the affinities of [14C]benzoylcyclothialidine (ligand) and nonlabeled cyclothialidine (inhibitor) change in parallel. Wigley et al. reported on the crystallization of the 43-kDa N-terminal fragment of the E. coli DNA gyrase B subunit, which comprises positions 2-393 of the intact protein in the presence of ADPNP(10Wigley D.B. Davies G.J. Dodson E.J. Maxwell A. Dodson G. Nature. 1991; 35: 624-629Crossref Scopus (487) Google Scholar). They have described the 43-kDa N-terminal fragment containing two distinct subdomains: an N-terminal subdomain (residues 2-220) containing the bound ADPNP and a C-terminal subdomain (residues 221-393), forming the sides of a proposed DNA-binding site. Ali et al.(8Ali J.A. Jackson A.P. Howells A.J. Maxwell A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2717-2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) have reported on steady-state ATPase experiments by using the 43-kDa N-terminal fragment of the B subunit; their results are consistent with the hypothesis of a noncompetitive mechanism for the inhibition of the ATPase activity of the B subunit by the coumarin antibiotics novobiocin and coumermycin A1. This indicates that coumarin antibiotics bind close to the ATP binding site of the protein with low affinity for ATP. We also suggest that, similar to coumarin antibiotics, cyclothialidine binds close to the ATP-binding site of the gyrase B subunit and stabilizes a conformation of the protein that is unable to bind ATP. However, our results further suggest that cyclothialidine recognizes a site that is also different from that recognized by the coumarin antibiotics. To sum up, two models with the currently available data are proposed as follows: 1) ATP, cyclothialidine, and coumarins bind to the same site, but the precise interactions that are important for ATP binding are different from those that are involved in cyclothialidine or coumarin binding. 2) The binding sites for ATP, cyclothialidine, and coumarins are completely separate but interactive and, to some extent, exclusive. Thus occupancy of the cyclothialidine site would prevent binding of ATP (or coumarins) and vice versa. The connectivity between the sites is dependent on the tertiary structure of the protein, and one could easily imagine that it would be influenced by the oligomeric state of the protein. The three-dimensional structure of the 43-kDa N-terminal fragment of the B subunit together with cyclothialidine should provide precise clues about the binding site of cyclothialidine and should determine whether cyclothialidine recognizes the same amino acids as do ATP or the coumarin antibiotics. Gilbert et al. have reported that the production and properties of a 24-kDa N-terminal fragment of the B subunit (residues 2-220) is shown to contain the coumarin antibiotics-binding site(30Gilbert E.J. Maxwell A. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 365-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Lewis et al.(31Lewis R.J. Singh O.M.P. Smith C.V. Maxwell A. Skarzynski T. Wonacott A.J. Wigley D.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 241: 128-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) have recently reported on their succeeding in the co-crystallization of the 24-kDa N-terminal fragment and novobiocin and of the 24-kDa fragment and GR122222X, an inhibitor that is structurally related to cyclothialidine. Our results are consistent with those findings, meaning that the binding sites of cyclothialidine and novobiocin probably lie within this 24-kDa N-terminal fragment of the B subunit. However, our results did not allow us to determine whether conformational changes of the binding site of cyclothialidine on the B subunit or in its vicinity occur before cyclothialidine binding or after. By using the electric dichroism method, as previously reported by Rau et al.(32Rau D.C. Gellert M. Thoma F. Maxwell A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), we may obtain the necessary information for determining the time point of the structural changes.

Hermann for carrying out the purification of the 43-kDa N-terminal fragment."

As well as these solvent-like lipids, a few “special” lipid molecules may bind at distinct sites on the ATPase. SR membranes contain, as well as phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns), and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns-4P), but no phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate(2Milting H. Heilmeyer L.M.G. Thieleczek R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The absence of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate means that, unlike the transverse tubule membrane, SR lacks the capacity for Ins(1,4,5)P3 generation(2Milting H. Heilmeyer L.M.G. Thieleczek R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). PtdIns 4-kinase has been detected in SR, as has a Ca2+-dependent phosphomonoesterase capable of catalyzing the breakdown of PtdIns-4P(9Varsanyi M. Messer M. Brandt N.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 179: 473-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 10Schafer M. Behle G. Varsanyi M. Heilmeyer L.M.G. Biochem. J. 1987; 247: 579-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). A possible physiological role for PtdIns-4P is suggested by the experiments of Varsanyi et al.(11Varsanyi M. Tolle H.G. Heilmeyer L.M.G. Dawson R.M.C. Irvine R.F. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 1543-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) who showed that incubation of the purified ATPase with ATP in the absence of Ca2+ led to phosphorylation of up to one PtdIns molecule per ATPase molecule to form PtdIns-4P and that this resulted in stimulation of ATPase activity. Here, we show that the effect of PtdIns-4P on ATPase activity follows from a specific effect on the rate of dephosphorylation of the phosphorylated ATPase. Dioleoylphosphatidylcholine was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Birmingham, AL), and PtdIns and PtdIns-4P were from Sigma. Sarcoplasmic reticulum and purified Ca2+-ATPase were prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle(3East J.M. Lee A.G. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4144-4151Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Concentrations of ATPase were estimated by using the extinction coefficient (1.2 liters g−1 cm−1 for a solution in 1% SDS) given by Hardwicke and Green(12Hardwicke P.M. Green N.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 42: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Mixtures of di(C18:1)PC and PtdIns or PtdIns-4P (10 μmol, total phospholipid) in buffer (400 μl, 10 mM Hepes/Tris, pH 8.0, containing 15% sucrose, 5 mM MgSO4, 5 mM ATP, and 12 mg/ml potassium cholate) were sonicated to clarity in a bath sonicator. ATPase (1.25 mg) in a volume of 20-30 μl was then added, and the mixture was left for 15 min at room temperature and 45 min at 5°C to equilibrate. After equilibration, the samples were added to precooled Oakridge tubes containing ice-cold buffer (10 mM Hepes/Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mM dithiothreitol) and centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C. Samples were rehomogenized and suspended in buffer (10 mM Hepes/Tris, 15% sucrose) to a concentration of 3-8 mg/ml and then stored at −20°C until use. The purified Ca2+-ATPase or SR vesicles were activated by incubation with ATP largely as described by Varsanyi et al.(11Varsanyi M. Tolle H.G. Heilmeyer L.M.G. Dawson R.M.C. Irvine R.F. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 1543-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The ATPase or SR vesicles (2 mg of protein/ml) were incubated with 1 mM ATP in 40 mM Hepes/KOH, pH 7.2, containing 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgSO4, and 1 mM EGTA for 1 h at 25°C. The sample was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h, and the pellet was kept on ice until use. As a control, ATPase was incubated under the same conditions but in the absence of ATP. ATPase activities were determined at 25°C by using a coupled enzyme assay in a medium containing 40 mM Hepes/KOH, pH 7.2, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgSO4, 2.1 mM ATP, 1.1 mM EGTA, 0.41 mM phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.15 mM NADH, pyruvate kinase (7.5 IU), and lactate dehydrogenase (18 IU) in a total volume of 2.5 ml. The reaction was initiated by addition of an aliquot of a 25 mM CaCl2 solution to a cuvette containing the ATPase and the other reagents to give the required concentration of Ca2+. Free concentrations of Ca2+ were calculated using the binding constants for Ca2+, Mg2+, and H+ to EGTA given by Godt(13Godt R.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1974; 63: 722-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The time dependence of phosphorylation-induced Ca2+ release from the ATPase was determined using a Biologic Rapid filtration system, and the time dependences of phosphorylation of the ATPase by [γ-32P]ATP and of dephosphorylation of the ATPase phosphorylated with [32P]Pi in the absence of Ca2+, or with [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of Ca2+, were determined using a Biologic QFM-5 system as described by Starling et al.(14Starling A.P. Hughes G. East J.M. Lee A.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3023-3031Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The ATPase (0.2 mg of protein/ml) was incubated with [32P]Pi in 150 mM Mes/Tris, pH 6.2, containing 5 mM EGTA and the required concentrations of Mg2+ at 25°C. After 15 s, the reaction was quenched by addition of 10 volumes of quenching solution (25% trichloroacetic acid, 0.13 M phosphoric acid). The sample was put on ice for 15 min, and then the precipitate was collected by filtration through Whatman GF/B glass fiber filters and finally counted in Optiphase Hisafe III. SR vesicles (25 mg of protein) were incubated with ATP as described above, followed by precipitation with trichloroacetic acid. The precipitate was pelleted, washed with water, dried in vacuo, and extracted with chloroform/methanol (3 ml; 2:1 v/v). The precipitate was again pelleted and then extracted with chloroform/methanol/HCl (3 ml, 40:20:1 (v/v/v)). The organic layer was filtered through a Whatman GF/C filter and washed with 0.6 ml of a 1% NaCl solution, and the lower chloroform-rich phase evaporated in vacuo. Lipids were separated by thin layer chromatography on Silica gel 60 plates using chloroform/methanol/water/ammonia (48:40:7:5 (v/v/v/v)) as solvent (15Bird I.M. Graham J. Higgins J. Methods in Molecular Biology. Vol. 27. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1994: 227-248Google Scholar). Lipids were visualized by staining with iodine and 32P-labeled lipid detected using a plate scanner (Dünnschicht). If the ATPase is incubated with MgATP in the absence of Ca2+ for 1 h and then the rate of ATP hydrolysis measured at 100 μM Ca2+, an activity of 5.9 IU/mg protein is obtained, compared with a value of 3.0 IU/mg protein for the ATPase prior to incubation with ATP (Fig. 1). The ATPase was reconstituted into bilayers of di(C18:1)PC and PtdIns-4P by mixing the ATPase with lipid in cholate solution at a molar ratio of lipid:ATPase of 1000:1, followed by dilution into buffer to reform membrane fragments(1Lee A.G. East J.M. Watts A. Protein-Lipid Interactions. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1993: 259-299Google Scholar). Following reconstitution with a lipid mixture containing 20% PtdIns-4P, the ATPase activity was the same as that for the ATPase activated with ATP (Fig. 1). The effect of PtdIns-4P on ATPase activity increased with increasing PtdIns-4P content up to 10%, beyond which activity was constant up to 50% PtdIns-4P, the highest content tested (data not shown). Reconstitution with mixtures of di(C18:1)PC and PtdIns led to smaller increases in ATPase activity (Fig. 1), with stimulation of ATPase activity reaching a maximum at 10% PtdIns. The dependence of ATPase activity on Ca2+ concentration is complex (Fig. 1) with low concentrations of Ca2+ activating the ATPase, attributable to binding of Ca2+ to the Ca2+ binding sites on the unphosphorylated ATPase (E1), and high concentrations of Ca2+ inhibiting the ATPase, attributable both to binding of Ca2+ to the phosphorylated ATPase (E2P) with a subsequent decrease in the rate of dephosphorylation and to the formation of CaATP, which is hydrolyzed more slowly by the ATPase than MgATP(16Shigekawa M.

Activation with ATP or reconstitution with PtdIns-4P had no significant effect on the Ca2+ dependence of activity, in either the low or high concentration regions (Fig. 1). The affinity of the ATPase for Ca2+ can also be measured from changes in the tryptophan fluorescence intensity of the ATPase on binding Ca2+(19Henderson I.M.J. Khan Y.M. East J.M. Lee A.G. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 615-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Such measurements detect a very small decrease in the Ca2+ affinity (a shift in the pCa value for 50% binding of −0.2) on reconstitution with PtdIns-4P (data not shown). Mixing the ATPase incubated in the presence of 100 μM Ca2+ with 50 μM [γ-32P]ATP at pH 7.2 leads to rapid formation of phosphoenzyme, which fits to a single exponential process with rates of 78.7 ± 10.0 s−1 and 77.6 ± 9.2 s−1, respectively, for the ATPase before and after activation by incubation with ATP (data not shown). The maximum level of phosphorylation, 2.8 nmol of [EP]/mg protein, was unaffected by incubation with ATP, corresponding to a fraction of active protein of about 0.3, typical for this and other preparations of the ATPase. The rate of phosphorylation of the ATPase by ATP in the presence of Ca2+ is much faster than the rate of dissociation of 45Ca2+ from the unphosphorylated ATPase(20Orlowski S. Champeil P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11331-11342Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, Orlowski and Champeil (20Orlowski S. Champeil P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11331-11342Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) have shown that the rate of Ca2+ dissociation from the phosphorylated ATPase (the E1PCa2 → E2P step) can be measured by pre-equilibrating the ATPase with 45Ca2+ and then perfusing it on Millipore filters with 40Ca2+ and ATP. When the ATPase was incubated with 100 μM 45Ca2+ in buffer at pH 7.2 and then perfused with the same medium containing 100 μM unlabeled Ca2+ and 2 mM MgATP, dissociation of 45Ca2+ from the ATPase was observed, fitting to a single exponential process with a rate constant of 19.3 ± 4.6 −1 (Fig. 2). If the ATPase was first activated by incubation with ATP in the absence of Ca2+ for 1 h, then the rate of Ca2+ dissociation was not changed significantly, fitting to a rate constant of 15.5 ± 3.3 s−1 (Fig. 2). Incubation of the ATPase with Pi at pH 6.2 in the presence of Mg2+ and absence of Ca2+ leads to phosphorylation of the ATPase. The level of phosphorylation observed is reduced if the ATPase is first activated by incubation with ATP (Fig. 3). Phosphoenzyme formation fits to Scheme I(21de Meis L. The Sarcoplasmic Reticulum. Wiley, New York1981Google Scholar, 22Froud R.J. Lee A.G. Biochem. J. 1986; 237: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).Scheme I.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As described(22Froud R.J. Lee A.G. Biochem. J. 1986; 237: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), good fits to the experimental data for the unstimulated ATPase can be obtained with binding constants of Mg2+ and Pi of 100 M−1, with an equilibrium constant E2PMg/E2PiMg of 18 and an equilibrium constant E1/E2 calculated as described by Henderson et al.(19Henderson I.M.J. Khan Y.M. East J.M. Lee A.G. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 615-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). For the activated ATPase, the data fit to the same binding constants for Mg2+ and Pi but with a reduced value for the equilibrium constant E2PMg/E2PiMg of 1.8 (Fig. 3). The rate of dephosphorylation of the phosphorylated ATPase can be determined either by phosphorylating the ATPase with [32P]Pi at pH 6.0 in the absence of Ca2+ and presence of dimethyl sulfoxide followed by mixing with an excess of a pH 7.5 buffer containing KCl and ATP to induce dephosphorylation, or by first phosphorylating the ATPase with [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of Ca2+ and then mixing with an excess of unlabeled ATP(14Starling A.P. Hughes G. East J.M. Lee A.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3023-3031Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Although the level of phosphorylation of the activated ATPase by Pi is normally low (Fig. 3), in the presence of 14% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide, levels of phosphorylation are comparable for the activated and the non-activated ATPase. Dephosphorylation of the ATPase phosphorylated with Pi in the presence of dimethyl sulfoxide fits to a single exponential process with a rate of 15.2 ± 1.6 s−1 before activation of the ATPase with ATP and 36.9 ± 3.0 s−1 after activation with ATP (Fig. 4A). A similar increase in the rate of dephosphorylation was observed following reconstitution with PtdIns-4P. Rates of dephosphorylation have been observed to vary between preparations of the ATPase, and for that used to obtain the data in Fig. 4B, a rate of dephosphorylation of 7.6 ± 0.6 s−1 was observed when reconstituted in di(C18:1)PC, increasing to 15.1 ± 2.0 s−1 on reconstitution with a mixture of di(C18:1)PC and PtdIns-4P at a molar ratio of 8:2 (Fig. 4B). For the ATPase phosphorylated with ATP, rates of dephosphorylation of 11.6 ± 2.5 s−1 and 26.8 ± 5.9 s−1 were observed before and after activation with ATP, respectively (Fig. 4C). As described by Varsanyi et al.(11Varsanyi M. Tolle H.G. Heilmeyer L.M.G. Dawson R.M.C. Irvine R.F. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 1543-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), incubation of SR vesicles with [γ-32P]ATP in the absence of Ca2+ led to the formation of radiolabeled PtdIns-4P, with no detectable radiolabel incorporation into phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, or phosphatidylserine. The activity of the Ca2+-ATPase in cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum is modified by interaction with phospholamban. Binding of phospholamban to the Ca2+-ATPase reduces the maximal rate of ATP hydrolysis and reduces the affinity of the ATPase for Ca2+(23Morris G.L. Cheng H. Colyer J. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11270-11275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Sasaki T. Inui M. Kimura Y. Kuzuya T. Tada M. J. Biol.

Lee A.G. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 511-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). No such control mechanism has yet been established for the Ca2+-ATPase in skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum. Skeletal muscle SR shows the kinase activity necessary to phosphorylate PtdIns to PtdIns-4P(2Milting H. Heilmeyer L.M.G. Thieleczek R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 10Schafer M. Behle G. Varsanyi M. Heilmeyer L.M.G. Biochem.

EMBO J. 1983; 2: 1543-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It also contains a Ca2+-dependent phosphomonoesterase able to hydrolyze PtdIns-4P(10Schafer M. Behle G. Varsanyi M. Heilmeyer L.M.G. Biochem. J. 1987; 247: 579-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Varsanyi et al.(11Varsanyi M. Tolle H.G. Heilmeyer L.M.G. Dawson R.M.C. Irvine R.F. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 1543-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) have shown that conversion of a small number of the PtdIns molecules in the SR membrane to PtdIns-4P (probably one per ATPase molecule) leads to stimulation of the Ca2+-ATPase(11Varsanyi M. Tolle H.G. Heilmeyer L.M.G. Dawson R.M.C. Irvine R.F. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 1543-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The PtdIns-4P involved in stimulation of the ATPase is probably tightly bound to it, since it is insensitive to a variety of phospholipases(11Varsanyi M. Tolle H.G. Heilmeyer L.M.G. Dawson R.M.C. Irvine R.F. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 1543-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We have confirmed these results. Incubation of the Ca2+-ATPase with ATP in the absence of Ca2+ leads to phosphorylation of PtdIns to PtdIns-4P, this resulting in stimulation of the ATPase (Fig. 1). The affinity of the ATPase for Ca2+ is little changed (Fig. 1), confirmed by measurements of changes in tryptophan fluorescence intensity as a function of Ca2+ concentration (data not shown). Stimulation of the ATPase can also be achieved by reconstitution of the ATPase with mixtures of di(C18:1)PC and PtdIns-4P (Fig. 1). The high molar ratio of PtdIns-4P to ATPase required for maximal stimulation in the reconstituted system (100:1) suggests significant partitioning of PtdIns-4P between the site(s) on the ATPase and the bulk lipid phase. In previous studies of the effects of phospholipids on the activity of the ATPase, we have detected changes in the rates of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the ATPase(5Starling A.P. East J.M. Lee A.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3084-3091Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 8Michelangeli F. Grimes E.A. East J.M. Lee A.G. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 342-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and stimulation of the ATPase by jasmone has been shown to follow from increases in the rates of the Ca2+ transport step and of dephosphorylation(14Starling A.P. Hughes G. East J.M. Lee A.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3023-3031Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Effects of jasmone and activation of the ATPase by ATP are additive; addition of 200 μM jasmone increases the activity of the activated ATPase from 5.9 to 7.9 IU/mg protein, measured under the conditions shown in Fig. 1(data not shown). Activation of the ATPase with ATP has no effect on the rate of phosphorylation of the ATPase (data not shown) or on the rate of the Ca2+ transport step (Fig. 2). However, it does have a marked effect on the rate of dephosphorylation of the phosphorylated ATPase, this increasing by a factor of about 2 (Fig. 4). The rate of dephosphorylation of the ATPase in a mixture of di(C18:1)PC and PtdIns-4P is also found to be double that for the ATPase in di(C18:1)PC (Fig. 4). Equilibrium measurements of phosphorylation of the ATPase by Pi (Fig. 3) are consistent with a 10-fold decrease in the equilibrium constant for phosphorylation (E2PMg/E2PiMg, Scheme I) on activation with ATP. With a doubling of the rate of dephosphorylation, this implies a 5-fold decrease in the rate of phosphorylation by Pi on activation of the ATPase. Since the binding site for PtdIns-4P is presumably in the trans-membrane region of the ATPase, the specific effect of PtdIns-4P on the E2PMg⇄E2PiMg step implies a long range interaction on the ATPase, since the phosphorylation domain of the ATPase is located a considerable distance above the membrane surface(26Baker K.J. East J.M. Lee A.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1192: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). PtdIns-4P and other negatively charged phospholipids have been shown to increase the affinity of the plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase for Ca2+ but with no effect on vmax(27Carafoli E. Stauffer T. J. Neurobiol. 1994; 25: 312-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The binding site for PtdIns-4P on the plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase has been suggested to involve both a large positively charged loop just before the third transmembrane α-helix and the C-terminal calmodulin binding domain (27Carafoli E. Stauffer T. J. Neurobiol. 1994; 25: 312-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Although the N-terminal region of the first of these proposed sites is absent from the SR Ca2+-ATPase, the C-terminal region, corresponding to the sequence 245DKTPLQQKLDEFGE in the SR Ca2+-ATPase, containing two conserved Lys residues is present as part of the proposed third stalk region(28Brandl C.J. Green N.M. Korczak B. MacLennan D.H. Cell. 1986; 44: 597-607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). This region could therefore be involved in binding PtdIns-4P to the SR Ca2+-ATPase. Alternatively, the binding site for PtdIns-4P on the SR ATPase could be in the distinct central space between trans-membrane lobes A, B, and C seen in electron micrographs(29Toyoshima C. Sasabe H. Stokes D.L. Nature. 1993; 362: 469-471Crossref Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 30Stokes D.L. Taylor W.R. Green N.M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 346: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar)."
https://openalex.org/W2022714931,"Previous results using translation inhibitors in the ocular circadian system of Aplysia suggest that protein synthesis may be involved in the light and serotonin (5-HT) entrainment pathways or perhaps in the circadian oscillator. Proteins have been previously identified whose synthesis was altered by treatments of light capable of perturbing the phase of the circadian rhythm in the eye of Aplysia. We extended these studies by investigating the effects of other treatments that perturb the ocular circadian rhythm on protein synthesis. 5-HT altered the synthesis of nine proteins. Interestingly, five of the proteins affected by treatments with 5-HT were previously shown to be affected by treatments with light. Four of the proteins affected by treatments with 5-HT were also affected by treatments with analogs of cAMP, a treatment which mimics the effects of 5-HT on the ocular circadian rhythm. To identify the cellular function of some of these proteins, we obtained their partial amino acid sequences. Based on these sequences and additional characterizations, a 78-kDa, pI 5.6 Aplysia protein appears to be glucose-regulated protein 78/binding protein, and a 36-kDa, pI 5.7 Aplysia protein appears to be porin/voltage-dependent anion channel. Heat shock experiments on Aplysia eyes revealed that yet another one of the Aplysia proteins (70 kDa) affected by 5-HT appears to be a heat-inducible member (heat shock protein 70) of the family of heat shock proteins. These findings suggest that these three identified proteins, together or individually, may be involved in some way in the regulation of the timing of the circadian oscillator in the eye of Aplysia."
