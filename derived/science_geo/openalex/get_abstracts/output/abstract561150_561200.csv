The human gut microbe Bacteroides fragilis produces immunomodulatory molecules that it releases via outer membrane vesicles (OMVs). These molecules can protect mice from experimentally induced colitis. Chu et al. now find that OMV-mediated protection from colitis requires Atg16l1 and Nod2 genes whose human orthologs are associated with an increased risk for developing IBD. OMVs trigger an ATG16L1 and NOD2–dependent noncanonical autophagy pathway in dendritic cells (DCs). OMV-primed DCs, in turn, induce regulatory T cells in the intestine that protect against colitis.

On a twist of the dead/alive behavior, Wang et al. now show that the cat can be in two separate locations at the same time. Constructing their cat from coherent microwave photons, they show that the state of the “electromagnetic cat” can be shared by two separated cavities. Going beyond common-sense absurdities of the classical world, the ability to share quantum states in different locations could be a powerful resource for quantum information processing.

A potassium-permeable channel is known to be required for symbiotic Ca(2+) oscillations, but the calcium channels themselves have been unknown until now. We show that three cyclic nucleotide-gated channels in Medicago truncatula are required for nuclear Ca(2+) oscillations and subsequent symbiotic responses. These cyclic nucleotide-gated channels are located at the nuclear envelope and are permeable to Ca(2+) We demonstrate that the cyclic nucleotide-gated channels form a complex with the postassium-permeable channel, which modulates nuclear Ca(2+) release. These channels, like their counterparts in animal cells, might regulate multiple nuclear Ca(2+) responses to developmental and environmental conditions."

Bacteria and plants scavenge iron, for instance, by synthesizing and releasing iron-chelating compounds called siderophores. Ghssein et al. describe three enzymes in Staphylococcus aureus that are responsible for the biosynthesis of another type of metallophore (see the Perspective by Nolan). Metabolomics and a range of biochemical assays show that this compound, named staphylopine, is involved in the uptake of a range of metals, depending on the growth environment. The genes required for staphylopine biosynthesis are conserved across a number of pathogenic bacteria and are similar to those for a broad-spectrum metallophore produced by plants.

https://openalex.org/W2397616787,"Objective To compare performance of risk prediction models for forecasting postoperative sepsis and acute kidney injury. Design Retrospective single center cohort study of adult surgical patients admitted between 2000 and 2010. Patients 50,318 adult patients undergoing major surgery. Measurements We evaluated the performance of logistic regression, generalized additive models, naïve Bayes and support vector machines for forecasting postoperative sepsis and acute kidney injury. We assessed the impact of feature reduction techniques on predictive performance. Model performance was determined using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, accuracy, and positive predicted value. The results were reported based on a 70/30 cross validation procedure where the data were randomly split into 70% used for training the model and the 30% for validation. Main Results The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve for different models ranged between 0.797 and 0.858 for acute kidney injury and between 0.757 and 0.909 for severe sepsis. Logistic regression, generalized additive model, and support vector machines had better performance compared to Naïve Bayes model. Generalized additive models additionally accounted for non-linearity of continuous clinical variables as depicted in their risk patterns plots. Reducing the input feature space with LASSO had minimal effect on prediction performance, while feature extraction using principal component analysis improved performance of the models. Conclusions Generalized additive models and support vector machines had good performance as risk prediction model for postoperative sepsis and AKI. Feature extraction using principal component analysis improved the predictive performance of all models."

It does so while maintaining a centralized position; however, the mechanism for spindle placement is unclear. Garzon-Coral et al. used magnetic tweezers to show that the dynamical properties of the astral microtubules act as a force-generating machinery to keep the spindle at the cell center. The stiffness of the spring-like force increases during anaphase and also with decreasing cell size. This machinery is strong enough to quench thermal fluctuations to ensure precise localization of the spindle, but soft enough to allow molecular force generators to fine-tune the position of the mitotic spindle.

In a series of behavioral, optogenetic, and electrophysiological experiments, Miyamoto et al. show that coordinated neuronal information flow during sleep is required for perceptual memory formation. Activity spreading from the secondary motor area (brain area M2) to the primary sensory region S1 is necessary for this particular kind of memory consolidation. Disturbing this coordinated input during slow-wave sleep immediately after memory acquisition prevented mice from learning a simple texture discrimination task. Science , this issue p. 1315"

https://openalex.org/W2404561743,"Fusarium head blight (FHB) caused by Fusarium graminearum not only causes severe losses in yield, but also reduces quality of wheat grain by accumulating mycotoxins. Breeding for host plant resistance is considered as the best strategy to manage FHB. Resistance in wheat to FHB is quantitative in nature, involving cumulative effects of many genes governing resistance. The poor understanding of genetics and lack of precise phenotyping has hindered the development of FHB resistant cultivars. Though more than 100 QTLs imparting FHB resistance have been reported, none discovered the specific genes localized within the QTL region, nor the underlying mechanisms of resistance.In our study recombinant inbred lines (RILs) carrying resistant (R-RIL) and susceptible (S-RIL) alleles of QTL-Fhb2 were subjected to metabolome and transcriptome profiling to discover the candidate genes. Metabolome profiling detected a higher abundance of metabolites belonging to phenylpropanoid, lignin, glycerophospholipid, flavonoid, fatty acid, and terpenoid biosynthetic pathways in R-RIL than in S-RIL. Transcriptome analysis revealed up-regulation of several receptor kinases, transcription factors, signaling, mycotoxin detoxification and resistance related genes. The dissection of QTL-Fhb2 using flanking marker sequences, integrating metabolomic and transcriptomic datasets, identified 4-Coumarate: CoA ligase (4CL), callose synthase (CS), basic Helix Loop Helix (bHLH041) transcription factor, glutathione S-transferase (GST), ABC transporter-4 (ABC4) and cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD) as putative resistance genes localized within the QTL-Fhb2 region.Some of the identified genes within the QTL region are associated with structural resistance through cell wall reinforcement, reducing the spread of pathogen through rachis within a spike and few other genes that detoxify DON, the virulence factor, thus eventually reducing disease severity. In conclusion, we report that the wheat resistance QTL-Fhb2 is associated with high rachis resistance through additive resistance effects of genes, based on cell wall enforcement and detoxification of DON. Following further functional characterization and validation, these resistance genes can be used to replace the genes in susceptible commercial cultivars, if nonfunctional, based on genome editing to improve FHB resistance."

Smith et al. used radar measurements from NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter to probe the planet's polar ice caps. Clear layers within the ice allowed them to calculate how much ice was deposited at different times. The results provide evidence for a recent ice age on Mars.

https://openalex.org/W2500524542,"YAP signaling pathway plays critical roles in tissue homeostasis, and aberrant activation of YAP signaling has been implicated in cancers. To identify tractable targets of YAP pathway, we have performed a pathway-based pooled CRISPR screen and identified tankyrase and its associated E3 ligase RNF146 as positive regulators of YAP signaling. Genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of tankyrase prominently suppresses YAP activity and YAP target gene expression. Using a proteomic approach, we have identified angiomotin family proteins, which are known negative regulators of YAP signaling, as novel tankyrase substrates. Inhibition of tankyrase or depletion of RNF146 stabilizes angiomotins. Angiomotins physically interact with tankyrase through a highly conserved motif at their N terminus, and mutation of this motif leads to their stabilization. Tankyrase inhibitor-induced stabilization of angiomotins reduces YAP nuclear translocation and decreases downstream YAP signaling. We have further shown that knock-out of YAP sensitizes non-small cell lung cancer to EGFR inhibitor Erlotinib. Tankyrase inhibitor, but not porcupine inhibitor, which blocks Wnt secretion, enhances growth inhibitory activity of Erlotinib. This activity is mediated by YAP inhibition and not Wnt/β-catenin inhibition.

The evolutionarily conserved Hippo-YAP (yes-associated protein) 3The abbreviations used are: YAP, yes-associated protein; TNKS, tankyrase; AMOT, angiomotin; RSA, redundant siRNA activity; PARsylation, poly(ADP-ribosylation). pathway is gaining increasing attention as critical regulators in organ size homeostasis, tissue regeneration, and tumorigenesis (1.Pan D. The hippo signaling pathway in development and cancer.Dev. Cell. 2010; 19: 491-505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1693) Google Scholar, 2.Yu F.X. Zhao B. Guan K.L. Hippo pathway in organ size control, tissue homeostasis, and cancer.Cell. 2015; 163: 811-828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar). Hippo-YAP pathway functions through regulating the activity of transcription cofactor YAP and its paralog TAZ. Central to Hippo pathway is the highly conserved MST1/2-LATS1/2 kinase cascade. MST1/2, in complex with its coregulatory protein Salvador (SAV1), phosphorylate and activate LATS1/2. Hippo kinase cascade is controlled by multiple upstream regulators, most notably tumor suppressor NF2. When Hippo kinase cascade is activated, YAP is phosphorylated by LATS1/2 and sequestered in the cytoplasm. When Hippo kinase cascade is inactivated, YAP enters the nucleus and binds to TEAD family transcription factors to activate the downstream transcriptional program. The Hippo-YAP pathway has emerged as a hub that integrates extra- and intracellular cues, including cell-cell interaction, mechanical and cytoskeletal changes, mitogens, and G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling, to control the transcription activity of YAP. Among these regulations, the actin cytoskeleton plays a central role orchestrating extracellular and intracellular stimuli to regulate YAP signaling (2.Yu F.X. Zhao B. Guan K.L. Hippo pathway in organ size control, tissue homeostasis, and cancer.Cell. 2015; 163: 811-828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar). Angiomotin family of proteins (AMOTs), including AMOT, AMOTL1, and AMOTL2, are key negative YAP regulators that link cytoskeletal changes and YAP signaling through phosphorylation-dependent and -independent mechanisms (3.Paramasivam M. Sarkeshik A. Yates 3rd, J.R. Fernandes M.J. McCollum D. Angiomotin family proteins are novel activators of the LATS2 kinase tumor suppressor.Mol. Biol.

Huang J. Chen J. Angiomotin-like proteins associate with and negatively regulate YAP1.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 4364-4370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). YAP signaling plays critical roles in cell proliferation and tissue homeostasis, and must be tightly regulated. Hyper-activation of YAP signaling can lead to uncontrolled cell proliferation and is associated with many human cancers (7.Harvey K.F. Zhang X. Thomas D.M. The Hippo pathway and human cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2013; 13: 246-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (1267) Google Scholar, 8.Plouffe S.W. Hong A.W. Guan K.L. Disease implications of the Hippo/YAP pathway.Trends Mol. Med. 2015; 21: 212-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Elevated expression of nuclear YAP protein is observed in many types of cancers, such as lung, liver, prostate, breast, colon, and ovary, and it often correlates with bad patient prognosis. Many mechanisms can lead to increased YAP signaling in cancer, including YAP gene amplification mutation or silencing of negative regulators, mutation of upstream GPCRs, or crosstalk with other signaling pathways (9.Irvine K.D. Integration of intercellular signaling through the Hippo pathway.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2012; 23: 812-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Elevated YAP signaling has been linked to drug resistance. Breast cancer cells with high YAP/TAZ activity show resistance to drugs such as taxol, doxorubicin, and tamoxifen (10.Lai D. Ho K.C. Hao Y. Yang X.

Invest. 2015; 125: 2123-2135Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Furthermore, cancer cells with high YAP activity are resistant to RAF- and MEK-targeted therapies and YAP depletion sensitizes cells harboring BRAF-V600E mutations to RAF and MEK inhibitors (13.Lin L. Sabnis A.J. Chan E. Olivas V. Cade L. Pazarentzos E. Asthana S. Neel D. Yan J.J. Lu X. Pham L. Wang M.M. Karachaliou N. Cao M.G. Manzano J.L. Ramirez J.L. Torres J.M. Buttitta F. Rudin C.M.

The Hippo effector YAP promotes resistance to RAF- and MEK-targeted cancer therapies.Nat. Genet. 2015; 47: 250-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Therefore, small molecules inhibiting YAP signaling are needed to overcome drug resistance in cancers. Tankyrase 1 (TNKS1) and tankyrase 2 (TNKS2) are enzymes catalyzing poly(ADP-ribosylation) (PARsylation) of protein substrates (14.Riffell J.L. Lord C.J. Ashworth A.

Tankyrases as drug targets.FEBS J. 2013; 280: 3576-3593Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Through its ankyrin repeats, tankyrase recognizes substrate proteins and transfers poly-(ADP-ribose) chains to these proteins. Our lab has previously discovered that tankyrase and its associated E3 ligase RNF146 control Wnt/β-catenin signaling through promoting PARsylation-dependent degradation of Axin (16.Huang S.M.

Proteasome regulation by ADP-ribosylation.Cell. 2013; 153: 614-627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In this study, we have performed pooled CRISPR screen and identified tankyrase and its associated E3 ligase RNF146 as positive regulators of YAP activity. Using a proteomics approach, we discovered angiomotins as substrates for tankyrases. Inhibition of tankyrase and RNF146 or blocking the interaction between angiomotins and tankyrase leads to accumulation of angiomotins and inhibition of YAP signaling. More importantly, tankyrase inhibition enhances the growth inhibitory activity of EGFR inhibitor in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) through stabilization of angiomotins and inhibition of YAP signaling. Our study represents one of the first examples of pathway-based CRISPR screen for pathway dissection and target identification. Our work uncovers tankyrase/RNF146 as novel regulators of YAP signaling and expands the application of tankyrase inhibitor in combatting YAP-mediated drug resistance. YAP signaling is activated in a variety of cancers, and tractable targets are needed to block YAP signaling in cancer. We used a pooled CRISPR screen strategy (22.Shalem O. Sanjana N.E. Hartenian E.

NF2, also known as Merlin, is a tumor suppressor and a negative regulator of YAP signaling (24.Zhang N. Bai H. David K.K. Dong J. Zheng Y. Cai J. Giovannini M. Liu P. Anders R.A. Pan D.

We chose to perform the screen in a NF2-deficient background since NF2 deficiency activates YAP signaling and bypasses cell density mediated YAP regulation. HEK293T NF2 KO cells were generated by CRISPR (supplemental Fig. S1). GTIIC-GFP, a GFP reporter for YAP/TEAD transcription factor complex (25.Shimizu N. Smith G. Izumo S.

A Cas9 expression cassette was also introduced into these cells to facilitate CRISPR-mediated gene inactivation. We constructed a lentivirus library encoding 90,000 individual guide RNAs (gRNA) targeting 18,000 human genes. HEK293T NF2 KO GTIIC-GFP cells were infected with the lentiviral gRNA library and subjected to FACS analysis. Cells expressing low GFP signal and high GFP signal were collected for next-generation sequencing (NGS) and subjected to informatics analysis (Fig. 1A). Genes/gRNAs underrepresented in the GFP-high population compared with the GFP-low population are expected to be positive regulators for YAP signaling. As seen in Fig. 1B, YAP and its paralog TAZ (also called WWTR1) scored strongly in the screen, demonstrating the robustness of the screen. Much to our surprise, RNF146, a tankyrase-associated E3 ligase originally cloned in our laboratory, is also among the top hits (Fig. 1B). We previously discovered that tankyrase negatively regulates Wnt/β-catenin signaling through promoting degradation of Axin (16.Huang S.M. Mishina Y.M. Liu S. Cheung A. Stegmeier F. Michaud G.A.

Because of the close connection between RNF146 and tankyrase, we took a careful look at the screening data and found that TNKS2 also scored as a positive regulator of YAP signaling (Fig. 1B). However, TNKS2 scored as a weaker hit as compared with RNF146, possibly due to the redundant function of TNKS1 (16.Huang S.M. Mishina Y.M. Liu S. Cheung A. Stegmeier F. Michaud G.A. Charlat O. Wiellette E. Zhang Y. Wiessner S. Hild M. Shi X. Wilson C.J. Mickanin C. Myer V. Fazal A. Tomlinson R. Serluca F. Shao W. Cheng H. Shultz M. Rau C. Schirle M. Schlegl J. Ghidelli S. Fawell S. Lu C.

Tankyrase inhibition stabilizes axin and antagonizes Wnt signalling.Nature. 2009; 461: 614-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (1531) Google Scholar). These results suggest that tankyrase and RNF146 might function as positive regulators of YAP signaling. To test a potential role of tankyrase in YAP signaling, we determined the effect of two structurally unrelated tankyrase inhibitors TNKS656 (29.Shultz M.D. Cheung A.K. Kirby C.A. Firestone B. Fan J.

Biol. 2009; 5: 100-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar) on YAP signaling. At 1 μm, both inhibitors suppressed GTIIC-GFP reporter activity in HEK293A cells (Fig. 1C) and HEK293T NF2 KO cells (Fig. 1E). Consistently, both tankyrase inhibitors suppressed the expression of YAP target genes, CTGF, CYR61, and ANKRD1 (Fig. 1, D and F). Together, these data suggest that tankyrase positively regulates YAP signaling and the catalytic activity of tankyrase is required for this function. We then used siRNA to validate the function of tankyrase in YAP signaling. Since TNKS1 and TNKS2 play redundant function, we used two previously validated pairs of siRNAs (16.Huang S.M. Mishina Y.M. Liu S. Cheung A. Stegmeier F. Michaud G.A. Charlat O. Wiellette E. Zhang Y. Wiessner S. Hild M. Shi X. Wilson C.J. Mickanin C. Myer V. Fazal A. Tomlinson R. Serluca F. Shao W. Cheng H. Shultz M.

Tankyrase inhibition stabilizes axin and antagonizes Wnt signalling.Nature. 2009; 461: 614-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (1531) Google Scholar) to simultaneously deplete TNKS1 and TNKS2 in HEK293A GTIIC-GFP cells (supplemental Fig. S2A). FACS analysis revealed a significant reduction of GFP signal intensity in TNKS1/2-knockdown cells compared with cells transfected with PGL2 control siRNA (Fig. 1G), suggesting that depletion of TNKS1 and TNKS2 suppresses YAP activity. We further showed that co-depletion of TNKS1 and TNKS2 reduced YAP target gene expression (Fig. 1H). These data further consolidate our finding that TNKS1 and TNKS2 are positive regulators of YAP signaling. We next asked whether tankyrase inhibition influences the upstream kinase cascade that phosphorylates YAP. Interestingly, phosphorylation status of YAP at serine 127 was not significantly affected by tankyrase inhibitors in HEK293A cells (Fig. 1I). Phosphorylation of YAP at serine 127 in HEK293T NF2 KO cells was too low to be detected. These results suggest that tankyrase inhibitors do not have a strong effect on YAP phosphorylation. Since nuclear translocation of YAP is required for activation of downstream target genes, we examined the effect of TNKS inhibitors on YAP expression in the nucleus. As shown in Fig. 1J, TNKS inhibitors decreased the level of YAP proteins in the nuclear extracts in HEK293A cells. In addition, we performed immunofluorescent staining to assess YAP nuclear localization in response to treatment of tankyrase inhibitors. In HEK293A cells, YAP proteins accumulated in the nucleus at low cell density (Fig. 1K, DMSO panel). However, nuclear staining of YAP was much reduced in tankyrase inhibitor-treated cells (Fig. 1K, TNKS656 and IWR1 panels). Similar results were also obtained in HEK293T NF2 KO cells (Fig. 1L). These results suggest that tankyrase inhibitor reduces YAP signaling through reducing its nuclear localization. Next, we sought to identify proteins through which tankyrase regulates YAP activity. To this end, we employed an affinity purification approach to isolate PARsylated proteins specifically modified by tankyrase. RNF146 directly interacts with PARsylated proteins through its WWE domain (17.Zhang Y. Liu S. Mickanin C. Feng Y. Charlat O. Michaud G.A. Schirle M. Shi X. Hild M. Bauer A. Myer V.E. Finan P.M. Porter J.A. Huang S.M. Cong F. RNF146 is a poly(ADP-ribose)-directed E3 ligase that regulates axin degradation and Wnt signalling.Nat. Cell Biol. 2011; 13: 623-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). RNF146ΔRING, an RNF146 mutant retaining the WWE domain but lacking the E3 ligase activity, was used as a bait to purify PARsylated proteins. HEK293T cells expressing SBP-tagged RNF146ΔRING were treated with either PARP1/2 inhibitor ABT888 to reduce background PARsylation, or co-treated with ABT888 and tankyrase inhibitor XAV939 (16.Huang S.M. Mishina Y.M. Liu S. Cheung A. Stegmeier F. Michaud G.A. Charlat O. Wiellette E. Zhang Y. Wiessner S. Hild M. Shi X. Wilson C.J. Mickanin C. Myer V. Fazal A. Tomlinson R. Serluca F. Shao W. Cheng H.

Tankyrase inhibition stabilizes axin and antagonizes Wnt signalling.Nature. 2009; 461: 614-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (1531) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). Cell lysates were incubated with streptavidin beads and bound proteins were eluted for quantitative mass spectrometry analysis. Proteins reduced in the XAV939-treated sample were candidates of tankyrase substrates. As expected, TNKS1 (also known as TNKS) and TNKS2, which auto-PARsylate themselves, were top hits of this experiment (Fig. 2B). In addition, we found angiomotin (AMOT) in the top hit list (Fig. 2B and supplemental Table S1). Angiomotin family of proteins (AMOT, AMOTL1, AMOTL2) are known negative regulators of YAP signaling (3.Paramasivam M. Sarkeshik A. Yates 3rd, J.R. Fernandes M.J. McCollum D.

Chem. 2011; 286: 4364-4370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). AMOT exists in two isoforms, a longer p130 isoform and a shorter p80 isoform. We found that tankyrase inhibitors strongly increased the protein level of p130 isoform, but not that of p80 isoform, in HEK293A cells (Fig. 2C). As controls, tankyrase inhibitors did not affect protein levels of other negative regulators of YAP pathway, including LATS1/2, MST1/2, and SAV1 (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, tankyrase inhibitors increased the protein level of AMOTL1, a close paralog of AMOT (Fig. 2C). Similar findings were made in HEK293T NF2 KO cells (Fig. 2C). We also found that siRNA-mediated depletion of tankyrase or RNF146 in HEK293A cells led to accumulation of AMOT p130 protein without affecting AMOT p80 protein (Fig. 2D, supplemental Fig. S2B), suggesting that tankyrase and RNF146 specifically degrade the longer isoform of AMOT proteins. Furthermore, AMOT and AMOTL1 proteins accumulated upon MG132 treatment (Fig. 2E), indicating that angiomotins are degraded by the proteasome. Consistently, after protein translation was blocked by cycloheximide, the half-life of HA-AMOTL1 was increased when cells were pre-treated with tankyrase inhibitor (Fig. 2F). In addition, the GST- WWE domain of RNF146, which specifically binds the poly(ADP-ribose) moiety (17.Zhang Y. Liu S. Mickanin C. Feng Y. Charlat O. Michaud G.A. Schirle M. Shi X. Hild M. Bauer A. Myer V.E. Finan P.M. Porter J.A. Huang S.M. Cong F. RNF146 is a poly(ADP-ribose)-directed E3 ligase that regulates axin degradation and Wnt signalling.Nat. Cell Biol. 2011; 13: 623-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), pulled down endogenous AMOT p130 from MG132-treated cells but not from TNKS656-treated cells (Fig. 2G), indicating that AMOT proteins are PARylated by tankyrase in vivo. As a control, WWE R163A mutant, which cannot bind to poly(ADP-ribose) moiety (17.Zhang Y. Liu S. Mickanin C. Feng Y. Charlat O. Michaud G.A. Schirle M. Shi X. Hild M. Bauer A. Myer V.E. Finan P.M.

Cell Biol. 2011; 13: 623-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), did not pull down AMOT proteins (Fig. 2G), demonstrating the specificity of pulldown assay. These data are consistent with the idea that tankyrase and RNF146 promote PARsylation-dependent degradation of angiomotins. To further characterize the interaction between tankyrase and angiomotins, we searched for tankyrase binding motifs in all three paralogs of AMOT family of proteins. Ankyrin repeats of tankyrase recognize a consensus of motif of RXXG/PXGX(E/D) (31.Hsiao S.J. Smith S.

SB155-2, which was isolated from deep-sea hydrothermal vents at a water depth of 1,000 m. Among the characterized alginate lyases in the polysaccharide lyase family 7 (PL-7), the amino acid sequence of NitAly showed the highest identity (39%) with that of red alga Pyropia yezoensis alginate lyase PyAly. Recombinant NitAly (rNitAly) was successfully expressed in Escherichia coli. Purified rNitAly degraded alginate in an endolytic manner. Among alginate block types, polyM was preferable to polyG and polyMG as a substrate, and its end degradation products were mainly tri-, tetra-, and penta-saccharides. The optimum temperature and pH values were 70 °C and around 6, respectively. A high concentration of NaCl (0.8–1.4 m) was required for maximum activity. In addition, a 50% loss of activity was observed after incubation at 67 °C for 30 min. Heat stability was decreased in the presence of 5 mm DTT, and Cys-80 and Cys-232 were identified as the residues responsible for heat stability but not lyase activity. Introducing two cysteines into PyAly based on homology modeling using Pseudomonas aeruginosa alginate lyase PA1167 as the template enhanced its heat stability. Thus, NitAly is a functional alginate lyase, with its unique optimum conditions adapted to its environment. These insights into the heat stability of NitAly could be applied to improve that of other PL-7 alginate lyases."

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1 α (PGC-1α) coactivators are not only among the genes differentially induced by distinct training methods, but they also participate in the ensuing signaling cascades that allow skeletal muscle to adapt to each type of exercise. Although endurance training preferentially induces PGC-1α1 expression, resistance exercise activates the expression of PGC-1α2, -α3, and -α4. These three alternative PGC-1α isoforms lack the arginine/serine-rich (RS) and RNA recognition motifs characteristic of PGC-1α1. Discrete functions for PGC-1α1 and -α4 have been described, but the biological role of PGC-1α2 and -α3 remains elusive. Here we show that different PGC-1α variants can affect target gene splicing through diverse mechanisms, including alternative promoter usage. By analyzing the exon structure of the target transcripts for each PGC-1α isoform, we were able to identify a large number of previously unknown PGC-1α2 and -α3 target genes and pathways in skeletal muscle. In particular, PGC-1α2 seems to mediate a decrease in the levels of cholesterol synthesis genes. Our results suggest that the conservation of the N-terminal activation and repression domains (and not the RS/RNA recognition motif) is what determines the gene programs and splicing options modulated by each PGC-1α isoform. By using skeletal muscle-specific transgenic mice for PGC-1α1 and -α4, we could validate, in vivo, splicing events observed in in vitro studies. These results show that alternative PGC-1α variants can affect target gene expression both quantitatively and qualitatively and identify novel biological pathways under the control of this system of coactivators.

https://openalex.org/W2395993618,"Background Antiretroviral therapy scale-up in Sub-Saharan Africa has created a growing, aging HIV-positive population at risk for non-communicable diseases such as hypertension. However, the prevalence and risk factors for hypertension in this population remain incompletely understood. Methods We measured blood pressure and collected demographic data on over 65,000 adults attending multi-disease community health campaigns in 20 rural Ugandan communities (SEARCH Study: NCT01864603). Our objectives were to determine (i) whether HIV is an independent risk factor for hypertension, and (ii) awareness and control of hypertension in HIV-positive adults and the overall population. Results Hypertension prevalence was 14% overall, and 11% among HIV-positive individuals. 79% of patients were previously undiagnosed, 85% were not taking medication, and 50% of patients on medication had uncontrolled blood pressure. Multivariate predictors of hypertension included older age, male gender, higher BMI, lack of education, alcohol use, and residence in Eastern Uganda. HIV-negative status was independently associated with higher odds of hypertension (OR 1.2, 95% CI: 1.1–1.4). Viral suppression of HIV did not significantly predict hypertension among HIV-positives. Significance The burden of hypertension is substantial and inadequately controlled, both in HIV-positive persons and overall. Universal HIV screening programs could provide counseling, testing, and treatment for hypertension in Sub-Saharan Africa."

https://openalex.org/W2396878059,"Purpose This mixed-methods exploratory study identified and then developed and validated a quantitative measure of a new construct of mental suffering in the occupied Palestinian territory: feeling broken or destroyed. Methods Group interviews were conducted in 2011 with 68 Palestinians, most aged 30–40, in the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip to discern local definitions of functioning. Interview participants articulated of a type of suffering not captured in existing mental health instruments used in regions of political conflict. In contrast to the specific difficulties measured by depression and PTSD (sleep, appetite, energy, flashbacks, avoidance, etc.), participants elaborated a more existential form of mental suffering: feeling that one’s spirit, morale and/or future was broken or destroyed, and emotional and psychological exhaustion. Participants articulated these feelings when describing the rigors of the political and economic contexts in which they live. We wrote survey items to capture these sentiments and administered these items—along with standard survey measures of mental health—to a representative sample of 1,778 32–43 year olds in the occupied Palestinian territory. The same survey questions also were administered to a representative subsample (n = 508) six months earlier, providing repeated measures of the construct. Results Across samples and time, the feeling broken or destroyed scale: 1) comprised a separate factor in exploratory factor analyses, 2) had high inter-item consistency, 3) was reported by both genders and in all regions, 4) showed discriminate validity via moderate correlations with measures of feelings of depression and trauma-related stress, and 5) was more commonly experienced than either feelings of depression or trauma-related stress. Conclusions Feeling broken or destroyed can be reliably measured and distinguished from conventional measures of mental health. Such locally grounded and contextualized measures should be identified and included in assessments of the full impact of protracted political conflict on functioning."

Shortly after infection, Cn is detectable as both extra- and intracellular yeast particles, with Cn being capable of establishing long-lasting latent infections within host macrophages. Although recent studies have shown that shed capsular polysaccharides and intact extracellular Cn can compromise macrophage function through modulation of NF-κB signaling, it is currently unclear whether intracellular Cn also affects NF-κB signaling. Utilizing live cell imaging and computational modeling, we find that extra- and intracellular Cn support distinct modes of NF-κB signaling in cultured murine macrophages. Specifically, in RAW 264.7 murine macrophages treated with extracellular glucuronoxylomannan (GXM), the major Cn capsular polysaccharide, LPS-induced nuclear translocation of p65 is inhibited, whereas in cells with intracellular Cn, LPS-induced nuclear translocation of p65 is both amplified and sustained. Mathematical simulations and quantification of nascent protein expression indicate that this is a possible consequence of Cn-induced “translational interference,” impeding IκBα resynthesis. We also show that long term Cn infection induces stable nuclear localization of p65 and IκBα proteins in the absence of additional pro-inflammatory stimuli. In this case, nuclear localization of p65 is not accompanied by TNFα or inducible NOS (iNOS) expression. These results demonstrate that capsular polysaccharides and intact intracellular yeast manipulate NF-κB via multiple distinct mechanisms and provide new insights into how Cn might modulate cellular signaling at different stages of an infection.

Although the pathogenesis of this disease remains elusive, over-reactive dendritic cells (DCs) play a critical role in the disease development. It has been shown that human alpha-1 antitrypsin (hAAT) has protective effects in type 1 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis mouse models. In the present study, we tested the effect of AAT on DC differentiation and functions, as well as its protective effect in a lupus-prone mouse model. We showed that hAAT treatment significantly inhibited LPS (TLR4 agonist) and CpG (TLR9 agonist) -induced bone-marrow (BM)-derived conventional and plasmacytoid DC (cDC and pDC) activation and reduced the production of inflammatory cytokines including IFN-I, TNF-α and IL-1β. In MRL/lpr mice, hAAT treatment significantly reduced BM-derived DC differentiation, serum autoantibody levels, and importantly attenuated renal pathology. Our results for the first time demonstrate that hAAT inhibits DC activation and function, and it also attenuates autoimmunity and renal damage in the MRL/lpr lupus model. These results imply that hAAT has a therapeutic potential for the treatment of SLE in humans."

In this work, we used projection stereolithography to 3D-print a planar NPR sheet composed of photosensitive poly(ethylene) glycol diacrylate biomaterial. We used a step-lithography exposure and a stitch process to scale up the projection printing process, and used the cut-missing rib unit design to develop a centimeter-scale NPR sheet, which was rolled up to form a tubular construct. The constructs had Poisson's ratios of -0.6 ≤ νxy ≤ -0.1. The NPR construct also supports higher cellular adhesion than does the construct that has positive νxy. Our NPR design offers a significant advance in the development of highly-compliant vascular grafts."

We found that topotecan treatment significantly alters the expression of many more genes, including long neuronal genes, immediate early genes, and paternal Ube3a, when compared to Top1 deletion. Our data show that topotecan has a stronger effect on neuronal transcription than Top1 deletion, and identifies TOP1cc-dependent and -independent contributions to gene expression."

Structures of Amb a 8 in complex with poly(l-proline)10 or poly(l-proline)14 are the first structures of the plant profilin in complex with proline-rich peptides. Amb a 8 binds the poly(l-proline) in a mode similar to that observed in human, mouse, and P. falciparum profilin·peptide complexes. However, only some of the residues that form the peptide binding site are conserved."
https://openalex.org/W2404412656,"Although the scientific community increasingly recognizes that its communication with the public may shape civic engagement with science, few studies have characterized how this communication occurs online. Social media plays a growing role in this engagement, yet it is not known if or how different platforms support different types of engagement. This study sets out to explore how users engage with science communication items on different platforms of social media, and what are the characteristics of the items that tend to attract large numbers of user interactions. Here, user interactions with almost identical items on five of CERN's social media platforms were quantitatively compared over an eight-week period, including likes, comments, shares, click-throughs, and time spent on CERN's site. The most popular items were qualitatively analyzed for content features. Findings indicate that as audience size of a social media platform grows, the total rate of engagement with content tends to grow as well. However, per user, engagement tends to decline with audience size. Across all platforms, similar topics tend to consistently receive high engagement. In particular, awe-inspiring imagery tends to frequently attract high engagement across platforms, independent of newsworthiness. To our knowledge, this study provides the first cross-platform characterization of public engagement with science on social media. Findings, although focused on particle physics, have a multidisciplinary nature; they may serve to benchmark social media analytics for assessing science communication activities in various domains. Evidence-based suggestions for practitioners are also offered."
https://openalex.org/W2402523224,"The bacterial messenger cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP) binds to a diverse range of effectors to exert its biological effect. Despite the fact that free-standing PilZ proteins are by far the most prevalent c-di-GMP effectors known to date, their physiological function and mechanism of action remain largely unknown. Here we report that the free-standing PilZ protein PA2799 from the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa interacts directly with the hybrid histidine kinase SagS. We show that PA2799 (named as HapZ: histidine kinase associated PilZ) binds directly to the phosphoreceiver (REC) domain of SagS, and that the SagS-HapZ interaction is further enhanced at elevated c-di-GMP concentration. We demonstrate that binding of HapZ to SagS inhibits the phosphotransfer between SagS and the downstream protein HptB in a c-di-GMP-dependent manner. In accordance with the role of SagS as a motile-sessile switch and biofilm growth factor, we show that HapZ impacts surface attachment and biofilm formation most likely by regulating the expression of a large number of genes.

Cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP) 4The abbreviations used are: c-di-GMPcyclic di-GMPDGCdiguanylate cyclasePDEc-di-GMP phosphodiesteraseHapZhistidine kinase-associated PilZRECphosphoreceiver. has emerged as a central regulator in many environmental and pathogenic bacteria. High c-di-GMP concentration generally correlates with the sessile lifestyle and formation of surface-associated biofilm. The cellular concentration of c-di-GMP oscillates with environmental changes through the opposing activities of diguanylate cyclase (DGC) and c-di-GMP phosphodiesterase (PDE) proteins. C-di-GMP exerts its biological effect by binding to riboswitches and a wide variety of protein effectors. PilZ domain proteins are the first discovered c-di-GMP-binding proteins and arguably the most prevalent ones (1Amikam D. Galperin M.Y. et al.PilZ domain is part of the bacterial c-di-GMP binding protein.Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: 3-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Apart from a small number of atypical PilZ proteins that lack c-di-GMP binding capability, PilZ proteins bind c-di-GMP with a remarkably wide range of binding affinities to regulate different pathways over a wide c-di-GMP concentration range (2Pultz I.S.

More than half of the PilZ proteins encoded by bacterial genomes are free-standing PilZ proteins that consist of a single PilZ domain of 90∼130 residues. The remaining PilZ proteins are didomain or multidomain proteins that contain a PilZ domain and other functional domains. Recent studies have yielded insight into the function and mechanism of several didomain or multidomain PilZ proteins, including the “backstop brake” YcgR protein from E. coli, the cellulose synthase subunit BcsA from Rhodobacter sphaeroides, the transcriptional regulator MrkH from Klebsiella pneumoniae, the alginate-biosynthesizing protein Alg44 from P. aeruginosa and the chemotaxis receptor Tlp1 from Azospirillum brasiencse (4Boehm A.

A common theme emerged from these studies is that the binding of c-di-GMP to the PilZ domain triggers an intra-protein conformational change to modulate the enzymatic activity or binding property of output domains. In contrast, the molecular mechanisms for the free-standing PilZ proteins remain less known despite that several of them have been implicated in bacterial pathogenesis. It was found that the free-standing PilZ proteins from Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. Oryzae mediate motility, virulence, and extracellular enzyme production (13McCarthy Y. Ryan R.P. O'Donovan K. He Y.Q. Jiang B.L. Feng J.X. Tang J.L.

Although it is widely hypothesized that free-standing PilZ proteins function as c-di-GMP adaptors by binding to their protein partners in a c-di-GMP-dependent fashion, experimental evidence supporting this hypothesis is still lacking.

The opportunistic pathogen P. aeruginosa is notorious for its ability to form multidrug-resistant biofilm on abiotic and biotic surfaces. P. aeruginosa harbors an extensive c-di-GMP signaling network that controls the switch between the motile and sessile life styles and regulates the formation and dispersal of biofilm. The c-di-GMP network of P. aeruginosa PAO1 consists of a large number of DGC and PDE proteins and at least 12 c-di-GMP binding effector proteins. The 12 effectors include FleQ, PelD, FimX, BrlR, PA4395, and seven PilZ-domain-containing proteins. The transcriptional regulator FleQ controls flagellar biosynthesis and the production of extracellular polysaccharides Pel and Psl; whereas the second transcription regulator BrlR is a multidrug transport activator associated with high-level antibiotic resistance (18Hickman J.W.

Besides the six proteins with known function, there are six c-di-GMP-binding PilZ proteins whose functions still remain unknown. Among the six PilZ proteins, PA0012, PA2799, PA4324, and PA4608 are free-standing PilZ proteins and PA3353 and PA2989 are didomain proteins, with PA3353 as the homologue of YcgR from Escherichia coli (5Paul K. Nieto V. Carlquist W.C. Blair D.F. Harshey R.M. et al.The c-di-GMP binding protein YcgR controls flagellar motor direction and speed to affect chemotaxis by a “Backstop Brake” mechanism.Mol. Cell. 2010; 38: 128-139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Elucidating the physiological role of the six PilZ proteins will substantially advance our understanding of c-di-GMP signaling in P. aeruginosa. As a step toward this goal, here we report the finding that PA2799 interacts with a sensor histidine kinase in a c-di-GMP-dependent manner. We show that PA2799 plays a role in early and late stages of biofilm formation by regulating the expression of a large number of genes. The results suggest a novel mechanism used by c-di-GMP to regulate two-component signaling through a PilZ adaptor and establish PA2799 as a new regulatory factor in biofilm formation. We postulated that free-standing PilZ proteins function as c-di-GMP adaptor proteins by binding to their protein targets. To identify the protein partner of PA2799, a customized bacterial two-hybrid screening system was created with a high-coverage P. aeruginosa genomic DNA library. The P. aeruginosa PAO1 genomic DNA library used for the bacterial two-hybrid screening was constructed by using the pTRG vector and two engineered pTRG vectors (see “Materials and Methods”) to maximize the number of open reading frames (ORFs) covered by the library. The high-coverage genomic library was designed to contain DNA fragments of 1–3 kb in length (supplemental Table S1 and Fig. S1). The bait plasmid was constructed by fusing the PA2799 gene to the bacteriophage λ repressor protein gene. The screening was performed by using PA2799 as the bait to probe for the prey protein encoded by the P. aeruginosa genomic DNA library. After several rounds of optimization to reduce the number of false-positive colonies, the screening yielded consistent results with more than two third of the prey plasmids containing a DNA fragment from the gene PA2824 (Fig. 1, A and B). While most of the other prey plasmids were found to be false positives that contain shifted ORFs, several clones contain a DNA fragment that encodes a portion of the diguanylate cyclase WspR that encompasses the entire GGDEF domain. However, no interaction was detected between PA2799 and the full-length WspR in the subsequent specific two-hybrid binding assay. The gene PA2824 codes for the protein SagS, a membrane-anchored hybrid histidine kinase that contains a sensor domain, a dimerization and histidine phosphotransfer (DHp) domain, a catalytic and ATP-binding (CA) domain and a phosphoreceiver (REC) domain (Fig. 1A). To validate the protein-protein interaction and to test whether the C-terminal REC domain of SagS is sufficient for maintaining the interaction with PA2799, we performed specific bacterial two-hybrid binding assays using a construct that contains the free-standing RECSagS domain. As evidenced by the robust growth of the colonies on selective medium (Fig. 1B), the interaction between PA2799 and the RECSagS domain was readily detected to suggest that PA2799 is likely to interact with SagS through the REC domain. As the first PilZ protein found to interact with a histidine kinase, we renamed PA2799 as HapZ (Histidine kinase-associated PilZ protein). The histidine-containing phosphotransfer protein-B (HptB) is known as one of the downstream and phosphoryl-receiving partners of SagS (29Hsu J.L. Chen H.C. Peng H.L. Chang H.Y. et al.Characterization of the histidine-containing phosphotransfer protein B-mediated multistep phosphorelay system in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1.J. Biol.

In addition to SagS, three additional sensor histidine kinases (PA1976, PA1611, and PA4856 or RetS) can also interact with HptB for phospho-transfer (29Hsu J.L. Chen H.C. Peng H.L.

Chem. 2012; 287: 1903-1914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). On the other hand, P. aeruginosa PAO1 contains several PilZ proteins in addition to HapZ. To test the specificity of the interaction between SagS and HapZ, prey plasmids that encode the REC domains of PA1976, PA1611, and PA4856 and bait plasmids that encode the PilZ proteins were constructed for a “cross-binding” assay. Bacterial two-hybrid assays showed that only the interaction between HapZ and RECSagS could be detected (Fig. 1C), suggesting that HapZ is likely the only PilZ protein that interacts with SagS and that the interaction between HapZ and SagS is highly specific. Such specific protein recognition between the PilZ adaptors and its protein partners could be crucial for preventing crosstalk among different signaling pathways. It is known that HapZ binds c-di-GMP with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 2.0 μm (2Pultz I.S. Christen M. Kulasekara H.D. Kennard A. Kulasekara B. Miller S.I. et al.The response threshold of Salmonella PilZ domain proteins is determined by their binding affinities for c-di-GMP.Mol. Microbiol. 2012; 86: 1424-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To further validate the interaction between HapZ and RECSagS and examine the effect of c-di-GMP on SagS-HapZ interaction, co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays were performed in P. aeruginosa PAO1 cell lysate. Plasmids were constructed to express hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged HapZ and 6×His-tagged RECSagS. We found that HA-HapZ could be co-immunoprecipitated with 6×His-RECSagS to confirm the interaction between SagS and HapZ (Fig. 2, A and B). The Co-IP assays also showed that the SagS-HapZ interaction is enhanced by c-di-GMP in a dose-dependent manner within the 0–20 μm range (Fig. 2B). Little enhancement was observed above 20 μm c-di-GMP, which is consistent with the binding affinity (Kd = 2.0 μm) of HapZ for c-di-GMP. The structurally related nucleotides GMP, cGMP, and c-di-AMP had little effect on SagS-HapZ interaction, indicating that the enhancing effect of c-di-GMP is rather specific. The enhancing effect of c-di-GMP on SagS-HapZ interaction is reminiscent of YcgR, a didomain PilZ protein that interacts with the switching complex of flagellar motor in E. coli (4Boehm A. Kaiser M.

PilZ proteins bind c-di-GMP by using several conserved residues from the β-barrel and the flexible N-terminal loop (7Morgan J.L.W. McNamara J.T.

Chem. 2011; 286: 14304-14314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment and structural modeling suggests that PA2799 is likely to bind c-di-GMP using the same set of residues from both the β-barrel and the 22-residue N-terminal loop (Fig. 2, C and D). As indicated by the barely visible colony, the protein-protein interaction seemed to be significantly weaker between RECSagS and the HapZ_R12A mutant that lacks the conserved c-di-GMP-binding residue Arg12 (Fig. 2E). Likewise, the interaction also seemed to be weaker between RECSagS and the HapZ_Δ21aa construct that lacks the entire N-terminal loop. The Co-IP and two-hybrid assay results strongly suggest that HapZ and SagS directly interact with each other, and that the binding of c-di-GMP to HapZ enhances the protein-protein interaction. Unfortunately, our further attempts to characterize the SagS-HapZ interaction and quantify the binding affinity using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was not successful because of the tendency of HapZ and its variants to form insoluble aggregate at high concentration (>100 μm), which is required for the in vitro binding assays. It has been known that SagS initiates a phosphorelay cascade in P. aeruginosa with HptB and the bifunctional PA3346 protein as the immediate downstream protein partners (Fig. 3A) (31Bordi C. Lamy M.C. Ventre I. Termine E. Hachani A. Fillet S. Roche B. Bleves S. Méjean V. Lazdunski A.

Chem. 2012; 287: 1903-1914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). PA3346 possesses either kinase or phosphatase activity, depending on the phosphorylation state of the protein. The observed SagS-HapZ interaction hints that HapZ can potentially regulate the SagS two-component signaling pathway by directly binding to SagS. We performed in vitro phosphorylation assay to investigate how HapZ and c-di-GMP affect the phosphotransfer between SagS and HptB. When the 6×His-tagged recombinant proteins SagS246–786 and HptB (1:1 ratio) were incubated in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP, phosphorylation of HptB was observed readily (Fig. 3B). When we included freshly prepared HapZ in the reaction mixture at a SagS/HptB/HapZ ratio of 1:1:1, the phosphorylation of HptB was suppressed, with the final amount of phosphorylated HptB reduced by ∼40%. This observation supports the view that HapZ can interact with SagS even in the absence of c-di-GMP. Nonetheless, addition of c-di-GMP further decreased the phosphorylation level of HptB in a dose-dependent manner till the [c-di-GMP] reached about 50 μm (Fig. 3B). The effect of c-di-GMP is specific because the enhancing effect was not observed for GMP and other nucleotides (Fig. 2C). C-di-GMP did not seem to have a significant effect on HptB phosphorylation when HapZ was replaced by the HapZ_R12A/R16A double mutant that is likely to have a much weaker affinity for c-di-GMP (Fig. 3D), suggesting that c-di-GMP exerts its effect through HapZ. The different effect of HapZ and the double mutant is unlikely due to different protein stability as the recombinant mutant protein seemed to exhibit similar fold efficiency (in E. coli) and in vitro stability (estimated by the decrease of the A280 nm of protein solutions at ambient temperature). Note that although a small sub-family of histidine kinases has been reported to be able to bind c-di-GMP directly (34Lori C. Ozaki S. Steiner S. Böhm R. Abel S. Dubey B.N. Schirmer T. Hiller S. Jenal U. et al.Cyclic di-GMP acts as a cell cycle oscillator to drive chromosome replication.Nature. 2015; 523: 236-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), SagS is unlikely to bind c-di-GMP due to the absence of c-di-GMP binding residues (supplemental Fig. S2). Taken together, the phosphorylation assays indicate that HapZ can bind to SagS to inhibit phosphorelay, and that the inhibition is likely to be further enhanced at high c-di-GMP concentration. P. aeruginosa is notorious for its ability to form antibiotic-resistant biofilm on abiotic and biotic surfaces. SagS, which stands for surface attachment and growth sensor hybrid, is known to control surface attachment and development of P. aeruginosa biofilm (29Hsu J.L. Chen H.C. Peng H.L. Chang H.Y. et al.Characterization of the histidine-containing phosphotransfer protein B-mediated multistep phosphorelay system in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 9933-9944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). If HapZ interacts with SagS in the cell, HapZ is likely to affect surface attachment and biofilm development as well. By using biofilm-growing flow cells and a confocal microscope, we examined how the deletion and overexpression of hapZ affects the formation of P. aeruginosa PAO1 biofilm. As shown in Fig. 4A, PAO1 formed the characteristic mushroom-shaped biofilm after 5 days of growth; whereas the ΔhapZ mutant strain exhibited significant delay in early surface attachment to result in a thin biofilm at the end. On the contrary, the overexpression strain (hapZ+) exhibited enhanced surface attachment at the early stage. However, despite the enhanced surface attachment, the hapZ+ strain forms a flat and fragile biofilm that completely lacks the mushroom structure at the end of five-day growth. The control experiment with PAO1 transformed the empty overexpression plasmid showed that the formation of mushroom-structured biofilm was not affected (data not shown). These observations indicate that HapZ impacts both surface attachment and biofilm development. To further confirm the role of HapZ in initial surface attachment during early biofilm formation, we conducted a competitive biofilm assay with mixed P. aeruginosa populations. When the cyan fluorescence protein (CFP)-tagged PAO1 strain was co-cultured with the YFP-tagged ΔhapZ strain in flow cells, the final biofilm was dominated by PAO1 (Fig. 4B), confirming that the ΔhapZ strain was impaired in surface attachment. In contrast, the matured biofilm was dominated by the hapZ+ strain when PAO1 was co-cultured with YFP-tagged hapZ+ strain, suggesting that the hapZ+ strain is more competent than PAO1 in surface attachment. These observations suggest that HapZ is involved in the processes of surface attachment and biofilm development, which further strengthens the functional relationship between SagS and HapZ.

The sites had experienced varying levels of tsunami and fire disturbance following the major earthquake of 2011. Eight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were identified and analyzed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. Total sediment PAH concentration (CT), the sum of the average concentrations of the eight PAHs, was 21–1447 μg kg-1-dry. Relative to the average level of one type of PAH in sediments collected around Japan in 2002 (benzo[a]pyrene = 21 μg kg-1-dry), five of the seven sites showed concentrations significantly lower than this average in 2013. The CTs for the three bivalves (134–450 μg kg-1-dry) were within the range of the previous reports (2.2–5335 μg kg-1-dry). The data suggest that the natural disaster did not increase PAH concentrations or affect the distribution within sediment or bivalves in Tohoku district. Although PAH concentrations at the sites pose no risk to human health, the findings highlight that the observed PAH levels derive from pre- rather than post-quake processes."
https://openalex.org/W2399329636,"The study of the mechanisms leading to cardiac hypertrophy is essential to better understand cardiac development and regeneration. Pathological conditions such as ischemia or pressure overload can induce a release of extracellular nucleotides within the heart. We recently investigated the potential role of nucleotide P2Y receptors in cardiac development. We showed that adult P2Y4-null mice displayed microcardia resulting from defective cardiac angiogenesis. Here we show that loss of another P2Y subtype called P2Y6, a UDP receptor, was associated with a macrocardia phenotype and amplified pathological cardiac hypertrophy. Cardiomyocyte proliferation and size were increased in vivo in hearts of P2Y6-null neonates, resulting in enhanced postnatal heart growth. We then observed that loss of P2Y6 receptor enhanced pathological cardiac hypertrophy induced after isoproterenol injection. We identified an inhibitory effect of UDP on in vitro isoproterenol-induced cardiomyocyte hyperplasia and hypertrophy. The present study identifies mouse P2Y6 receptor as a regulator of cardiac development and cardiomyocyte function. P2Y6 receptor could constitute a therapeutic target to regulate cardiac hypertrophy."
https://openalex.org/W2407317828,"α-Catenin is the primary link between the cadherin·catenin complex and the actin cytoskeleton. Mammalian αE-catenin is allosterically regulated: the monomer binds the β-catenin·cadherin complex, whereas the homodimer does not bind β-catenin but interacts with F-actin. As part of the cadherin·catenin complex, αE-catenin requires force to bind F-actin strongly. It is not known whether these properties are conserved across the mammalian α-catenin family. Here we show that αT (testes)-catenin, a protein unique to amniotes that is expressed predominantly in the heart, is a constitutive actin-binding α-catenin. We demonstrate that αT-catenin is primarily a monomer in solution and that αT-catenin monomer binds F-actin in cosedimentation assays as strongly as αE-catenin homodimer. The β-catenin·αT-catenin heterocomplex also binds F-actin with high affinity unlike the β-catenin·αE-catenin complex, indicating that αT-catenin can directly link the cadherin·catenin complex to the actin cytoskeleton. Finally, we show that a mutation in αT-catenin linked to arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, V94D, promotes homodimerization, blocks β-catenin binding, and in cardiomyocytes disrupts localization at cell-cell contacts. Together, our data demonstrate that αT-catenin is a constitutively active actin-binding protein that can physically couple the cadherin·catenin complex to F-actin in the absence of tension. We speculate that these properties are optimized to meet the demands of cardiomyocyte adhesion."

PqqA is a precursor peptide of PQQ with two conserved residues: glutamate and tyrosine.

The linked glutamate and tyrosine residues are then used to synthesize PQQ. Here, we demonstrated that the pqqF gene is essential for PQQ biosynthesis as deletion of it eliminated the inhibition of prodigiosin production by glucose. We further determined the crystal structure of PqqF, which has a closed clamshell-like shape. The PqqF consists of two halves composed of an N- and a C-terminal lobe. The PqqF-N and PqqF-C lobes form a chamber with the volume of the cavity of ∼9400 Å3. The PqqF structure conforms to the general structure of inverzincins.

https://openalex.org/W2406000137,"Introduction In Nigeria, there is a dearth of pediatric data on the risk factors associated with tuberculosis (TB), before and after antiretroviral therapy (ART). Methodology A retrospective observational cohort study, between October 2010 and December 2013, at the Federal Medical Centre, Makurdi, Nigeria. TB was noted among children less than 15 years of age at ART enrolment (prevalent TB-PrevTB), within 6 months (early incident tuberculosis-EITB) and after 6 months (late incident tuberculosis-LITB) of a 12-month follow-up on ART. Potential risk factors for PrevTB and incident TB were assessed using the multivariate logistic and Cox regression models respectively. Results Among 368 HIV-1 infected children, PrevTB was diagnosed in 73 children (19.8%). Twenty-eight EITB cases were diagnosed among 278 children over 132 person-years (py) with an EITB rate of 21.2/100 py. Twelve LITB cases were seen among 224 children over 221.9 py with a LITB rate of 5.4/100 py. A significant reduction in the incidence rates of TB was found over time (75%, p˂ 0.001). Young age of children (12–35 months, aOR; 24, 95% CI; 4.1–146.6, p ˂ 0.001; 36–59 months, aOR;21, 95%CI;4.0–114.3, p ˂ 0.001); history of TB in children (aOR; 29, 95% CI; 7.3–119.4, P˂ 0.001); severe immunosuppression (aOR;38, 95% CI;12–123.2,p ˂ 0.001); oropharyngeal candidiasis (aOR;3.3, 95% CI; 1.4–8.0, p = 0.009) and sepsis (aOR; 3.2, 95% CI;1.0–9.6, p = 0.043) increased the risk of PrevTB. Urban residency was protective against EITB (aHR; 0.1, 95% CI; 0.0–0.4, p = 0.001). Virological failure (aHR; 4.7, 95% CI; 1.3–16.5, p ˂ 0.001) and sepsis (aHR; 26, 95% CI; 5.3–131.9, p ˂ 0.001) increased the risk of LITB. Conclusions In our cohort of HIV-infected children, a significant reduction in cases of incident TB was seen following a 12-month use of ART. After ART initiation, TB screening should be optimized among children of rural residency, children with sepsis, and those with poor virological response to ART."
https://openalex.org/W2408194299,"Oysters play an important role in estuarine and coastal marine habitats, where the majority of humans live. In these ecosystems, environmental degradation is substantial, and oysters must cope with highly dynamic and stressful environmental constraints during their lives in the intertidal zone. The availability of the genome sequence of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas represents a unique opportunity for a comprehensive assessment of the signal transduction pathways that the species has developed to deal with this unique habitat. We performed an in silico analysis to identify, annotate and classify protein kinases in C. gigas, according to their kinase domain taxonomy classification, and compared with kinome already described in other animal species. The C. gigas kinome consists of 371 protein kinases, making it closely related to the sea urchin kinome, which has 353 protein kinases. The absence of gene redundancy in some groups of the C. gigas kinome may simplify functional studies of protein kinases. Through data mining of transcriptomes in C. gigas, we identified part of the kinome which may be central during development and may play a role in response to various environmental factors. Overall, this work contributes to a better understanding of key sensing pathways that may be central for adaptation to a highly dynamic marine environment."
https://openalex.org/W2407403948,"Purpose This study assessed the long-term stability and instability of subjective well-being during post-school transition (i.e., transition from adolescence to young adulthood) and evaluated the determinants of transition stability. Methods Using two cohorts from a national representative longitudinal study, the Longitudinal Study of Australian Youth (N = 20991), latent profile analysis and latent transition analysis were conducted to examine transition patterns among subjective well-being profiles for youth from age 17 to 25. Multinomial logistic regressions were conducted to evaluate whether key socio-demographic variables were associated with transition stability. Results We identified: (1) three subjective well-being profiles: Low (30%), Moderate (50%), and High (20%); and (2) three major transition patterns among these subjective well-being profiles: stable, partially-stable, and unstable. The majority of youth had stable transition patterns during the transition from adolescence to adulthood. A large percentage of youth (52%) started low in subjective well-being profile and remained in the low subjective-wellbeing profile. Our examination also revealed gender was the most pronounced indicator for transition stability during this time period, with males more likely to have unstable transition patterns than females. Conclusions Results suggest that different subjective well-being status and transition patterns can be identified in the post-high school transition to adulthood, including unstable transitions. By targeting those groups more vulnerable to transition, mental health promotion and interventions may be delivered more effectively."

https://openalex.org/W2407568788,"Obesity and insulin resistance are associated with oxidative stress, which may be implicated in the progression of obesity-related diseases. The kinase JNK1 has emerged as a promising drug target for the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes. JNK1 is also a key mediator of the oxidative stress response, which can promote cell death or survival, depending on the magnitude and context of its activation. In this article, we describe a study in which the long-term effects of JNK1 inactivation on glucose homeostasis and oxidative stress in obese mice were investigated for the first time. Mice lacking JNK1 (JNK1(-/-)) were fed an obesogenic high-fat diet (HFD) for a long period. JNK1(-/-) mice fed an HFD for the long term had reduced expression of antioxidant genes in their skin, more skin oxidative damage, and increased epidermal thickness and inflammation compared with the effects in control wild-type mice. However, we also observed that the protection from obesity, adipose tissue inflammation, steatosis, and insulin resistance, conferred by JNK1 ablation, was sustained over a long period and was paralleled by decreased oxidative damage in fat and liver. We conclude that compounds targeting JNK1 activity in brain and adipose tissue, which do not accumulate in the skin, may be safer and most effective.-Becattini, B., Zani, F., Breasson, L., Sardi, C., D'Agostino, V.

https://openalex.org/W2394932368,"Background Signal transduction networks are increasingly studied with mathematical modelling approaches while each of them is suited for a particular problem. For the contextualisation and analysis of signalling networks with steady-state protein data, we identified probabilistic Boolean network (PBN) as a promising framework which could capture quantitative changes of molecular changes at steady-state with a minimal parameterisation. Results and Conclusion In our case study, we successfully applied the PBN approach to model and analyse the deregulated Platelet-Derived Growth Factor (PDGF) signalling pathway in Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumour (GIST). We experimentally determined a rich and accurate dataset of steady-state profiles of selected downstream kinases of PDGF-receptor-alpha mutants in combination with inhibitor treatments. Applying the tool optPBN, we fitted a literature-derived candidate network model to the training dataset consisting of single perturbation conditions. Model analysis suggested several important crosstalk interactions. The validity of these predictions was further investigated experimentally pointing to relevant ongoing crosstalk from PI3K to MAPK signalling in tumour cells. The refined model was evaluated with a validation dataset comprising multiple perturbation conditions. The model thereby showed excellent performance allowing to quantitatively predict the combinatorial responses from the individual treatment results in this cancer setting. The established optPBN pipeline is also widely applicable to gain a better understanding of other signalling networks at steady-state in a context-specific fashion."
https://openalex.org/W2402115035,"Influenza A and B viruses possess a neuraminidase protein that shows sialidase activity. Influenza virus-specific neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) are commonly used for clinical treatment of influenza. However, some influenza A and B viruses that are resistant to NAIs have emerged in nature. NAI-resistant viruses have been monitored in public hygiene surveys and the mechanism underlying the resistance has been studied. Here, we describe a new assay for selective detection and isolation of an NAI-resistant virus in a speedy and easy manner by live fluorescence imaging of viral sialidase activity, which we previously developed, in order to achieve high-efficiency capture of an NAI-resistant virus. An NAI-resistant virus maintains sialidase activity even at a concentration of NAI that leads to complete deactivation of the virus. Infected cells and focuses (infected cell populations) of an oseltamivir-resistant virus were selectively visualized by live fluorescence sialidase imaging in the presence of oseltamivir, resulting in high-efficiency isolation of the resistant viruses. The use of a combination of other NAIs (zanamivir, peramivir, and laninamivir) in the imaging showed that the oseltamivir-resistant virus isolated in 2008 was sensitive to zanamivir and laninamivir but resistant to peramivir. Fluorescence imaging in the presence of zanamivir also succeeded in selective live-cell visualization of cells that expressed zanamivir-resistant NA. Fluorescence imaging of NAI-resistant sialidase activity will be a powerful method for study of the NAI resistance mechanism, for public monitoring of NAI-resistant viruses, and for development of a new NAI that shows an effect on various NAI-resistant mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2399768640,"Our study tested the hypothesis that immunoglobulins differ in their ability to activate the nuclear factor-κB pathway mediated cellular responses. These responses are modulated by several properties of the immune complex, including the ratio of antibody isotypes binding to antigen. Immunoassays allow the measurement of antigen specific antibodies belonging to distinct immunoglobulin classes and subclasses but not the net biological effect of the combination of these antibodies. We set out to develop a biosensor that is suitable for the detection and characterization of antigen specific serum antibodies. We genetically modified the monocytoid U937 cell line carrying Fc receptors with a plasmid encoding NF-κB promoter-driven GFP. This clone, U937-NF-κB, was characterized with respect to FcR expression and response to solid-phase immunoglobulins. Human IgG3, IgG4 and IgG1 induced GFP production in a time- and dose-dependent manner, in this order of efficacy, while IgG2 triggered no activation at the concentrations tested. IgA elicited no response alone but showed significant synergism with IgG3 and IgG4. We confirmed the importance of activation via FcγRI by direct stimulation with monoclonal antibody and by competition assays. We used citrullinated peptides and serum from rheumatoid arthritis patients to generate immune complexes and to study the activation of U937-NF-κB, observing again a synergistic effect between IgG and IgA. Our results show that immunoglobulins have distinct pro-inflammatory potential, and that U937-NF-κB is suitable for the estimation of biological effects of immune-complexes, offering insight into monocyte activation and pathogenesis of antibody mediated diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2396992679,"A variety of wildlife species maintained in captivity are susceptible to iron storage disease (ISD), or hemochromatosis, a disease resulting from the deposition of excess iron into insoluble iron clusters in soft tissue. Sumatran rhinoceros (Dicerorhinus sumatrensis) is one of the rhinoceros species that has evolutionarily adapted to a low-iron diet and is susceptible to iron overload. Hemosiderosis is reported at necropsy in many African black and Sumatran rhinoceroses but only a small number of animals reportedly die from hemochromatosis. The underlying cause and reasons for differences in susceptibility to hemochromatosis within the taxon remains unclear. Although serum ferritin concentrations have been useful in monitoring the progression of ISD in many species, there is some question regarding their value in diagnosing hemochromatosis in the Sumatran rhino. To investigate the metabolic changes during the development of hemochromatosis and possibly increase our understanding of its progression and individual susceptibility differences, the serum metabolome from a Sumatran rhinoceros was investigated by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics. The study involved samples from female rhinoceros at the Cincinnati Zoo (n = 3), including two animals that died from liver failure caused by ISD, and the Sungai Dusun Rhinoceros Conservation Centre in Peninsular Malaysia (n = 4). Principal component analysis was performed to visually and statistically compare the metabolic profiles of the healthy animals. The results indicated that significant differences were present between the animals at the zoo and the animals in the conservation center. A comparison of the 43 serum metabolomes of three zoo rhinoceros showed two distinct groupings, healthy (n = 30) and unhealthy (n = 13). A total of eighteen altered metabolites were identified in healthy versus unhealthy samples. Results strongly suggest that NMR-based metabolomics is a valuable tool for animal health monitoring and may provide insight into the progression of this and other insidious diseases."

Methods Computed tomography (CT) datasets of 10 NPC patients undergoing chemoradiotherapy were used to generate LF-VMAT and FJ-VMAT plans in the Eclipse version 10.0 treatment planning system. These two kinds of plans were then compared with respect to planning-target-volume (PTV) coverage, conformity index (CI), homogeneity index (HI), organ-at-risk sparing, monitor units (MUs) and treatment time (TT). Results The FJ-VMAT plans provided lower D2% of PGTVnd (PTV of lymph nodes), PTV1 (high-risk PTV) and PTV2 (low-risk PTV) than did the LF-VMAT plans, whereas no significant differences were observed in PGTVnx (PTV of primary nasopharyngeal tumor). The FJ-VMAT plans provided lower doses delivered to the planning organ at risk (OAR) volumes (PRVs) of both brainstem and spinal cord, both parotid glands and normal tissue than did the LF-VMAT plans, whereas no significant differences were observed with respect to the oral cavity and larynx. The MUs of the FJ-VMAT plans (683 ± 87) were increased by 22% ± 12% compared with the LF-VMAT plans (559 ± 62). In terms of the TT, no significant difference was found between the two kinds of plans. Conclusions FJ-VMAT was similar or slightly superior to LF-VMAT in terms of PTV coverage and was significantly superior in terms of OAR sparing, at the expense of increased MUs."

The secreted active form of IL-16 has been detected at sites of TH1-mediated inflammation, such as those seen in autoimmune diseases, ischemic reperfusion injury (IRI), and tissue transplant rejection. Neutralization of IL-16 recruitment to its receptor, using an anti-IL16 antibody, has been shown to significantly attenuate inflammation and disease pathology in IRI, as well as in some autoimmune diseases. The 14.1 antibody is a monoclonal anti-IL-16 antibody, which when incubated with CD4+ cells is reported to cause a reduction in the TH1-type inflammatory response. Secreted IL-16 contains a characteristic PDZ domain. PDZ domains are typically characterized by a defined globular structure, along with a peptide-binding site located in a groove between the αB and βB structural elements and a highly conserved carboxylate-binding loop. In contrast to other reported PDZ domains, the solution structure previously reported for IL-16 reveals a tryptophan residue obscuring the recognition groove. We have solved the structure of the 14.1Fab fragment in complex with IL-16, revealing that binding of the antibody requires a conformational change in the IL-16 PDZ domain. This involves the rotation of the αB-helix, accompanied movement of the peptide groove obscuring tryptophan residue, and consequent opening up of the binding site for interaction.

An array of immune and non-immune cells are now known to express IL-16 as one aspect of an inflammatory response, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, eosinophils, monocytes, mast cells, and dendritic cells (2.Cruikshank W. Little F. et al.Interleukin-16: the ins and outs of regulating T-cell activation.Crit. Rev. Immunol. 2008; 28: 467-483Crossref PubMed Google Scholar3.Lim K.G. Wan H.C. Bozza P.T. Resnick M.B.

Immunol. 1995; 155: 2902-2910PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, IL-16 has been reported to promote the entry of resting CD4+ T cells into the cell cycle, and the up-regulation of IL-2 receptor and major histocompatibility (MHC) class II proteins on cell surfaces (6.Liu Y. Cruikshank W.W. O'Loughlin T. O'Reilly P. Center D.M. Kornfeld H. et al.Identification of a CD4 domain required for interleukin-16 binding and lymphocyte activation.J. Biol.

Human IL-16 (hIL-16) 4The abbreviations used are: IL-16interleukin-16CD4cluster of differentiation 4CDRcomplementarity determining regionBistris propane1,3-bis[tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino]propane. is expressed as a 631-amino acid precursor protein and contains three PDZ domains, along with an N-terminal CcN motif, encompassing both CK2 and cdc2 kinase phosphorylation sites, a nuclear localization signal, and an Src homology 3 binding motif (Fig. 1A) (8.Richmond J.

Following cytosolic proteolysis of hIL-16 by caspase-3, a 121-amino acid fragment encompassing the C-terminal PDZ domain (residues 527–619) is secreted as the mature form of IL-16 (10.Zhang Y.

Chem. 1998; 273: 1144-1149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Secreted IL-16 has been reported to bind to CD4 with relatively high affinity (6.Liu Y. Cruikshank W.W. O'Loughlin T. O'Reilly P. Center D.M. Kornfeld H. et al.Identification of a CD4 domain required for interleukin-16 binding and lymphocyte activation.J. Biol.

Cruikshank W.W. et al.Interleukin 16 and its function as a CD4 ligand.Immunol. Today. 1996; 17: 476-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), which is consistent with IL-16 functioning as a pro-inflammatory cytokine. The protein is reported to have two major effects on CD4+ cells: chemoattraction, preferentially of TH1 cells, and inhibition of CD3/T-cell mediated activation, preferentially of TH2 cells (13.Little F.F. Cruikshank W.W. et al.Interleukin-16 and peptide derivatives as immunomodulatory therapy in allergic lung disease.Expert Opin. Biol. Ther. 2004; 4: 837-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Co-incubation of CD4+ cells with an anti-CD4 antibody (OKT4) is reported to lead to a reduction in the magnitude of IL-16-induced cell migration by monocytes (11.Cruikshank W.W. Berman J.S. Theodore A.C. Bernardo J. Center D.M. et al.Lymphokine activation of T4+ T lymphocytes and monocytes.J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 3817-3823PubMed Google Scholar). The protein CD4 contains four immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains (D1–D4), and CD4-derived peptide inhibition studies of IL-16-mediated chemotaxis suggested that IL-16 binds to CD4 D4 (6.Liu Y. Cruikshank W.W. O'Loughlin T. O'Reilly P. Center D.M. Kornfeld H. et al.Identification of a CD4 domain required for interleukin-16 binding and lymphocyte activation.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23387-23395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). There is also evidence to suggest that chemokine receptor 5, which is expressed on the surface of TH1 cells, enhances the binding of IL-16 to the co-receptor (14.Lynch E.A. Heijens C.A. Horst N.F. Center D.M. Cruikshank W.W. et al.Cutting edge: IL-16/CD4 preferentially induces Th1 cell migration: requirement of CCR5.J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 4965-4968Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). interleukin-16 cluster of differentiation 4 complementarity determining region 1,3-bis[tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino]propane. Interestingly, the chemotactic activity of hIL-16 is not associated with a characteristic chemokine structural motif (15.Glass W.G. Sarisky R.T. Vecchio A.M. et al.Not-so-sweet sixteen: the role of IL-16 in infectious and immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2006; 26: 511-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 16.Bacon K. Baggiolini M. Broxmeyer H. Horuk R. Lindley I. Mantovani A. Maysushima K. Murphy P. Nomiyama H. Oppenheim J. et al.Chemokine/chemokine receptor nomenclature.J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2002; 22: 1067-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The solution structure of mature hIL-16 has been reported and showed the chemokine to contain a classical PDZ domain, consisting of a central up and down β-sandwich, adjacent to an α-helix (17.Mühlhahn P. Zweckstetter M. Georgescu J. Ciosto C. Renner C. Lanzendörfer M. Lang K. Ambrosius D. Baier M. Kurth R. Holak T.A. et al.Structure of interleukin 16 resembles a PDZ domain with an occluded peptide binding site.Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 682-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). PDZ domains typically assist in the assembly of multiprotein signaling complexes, by binding peptides in a groove between the α1-helix and β2-strand, in a process known as β-strand addition (18.Harrison S.C. et al.Peptide-surface association: the case of PDZ and PTB domains.Cell. 1996; 86: 341-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). This peptide recognition is mediated by a conserved GLGF motif termed the “carboxylate-binding loop,” which coordinates a number of hydrogen bonds to the C-terminal carboxylate of the binding peptide. Surprisingly, the typical PDZ-peptide binding groove is blocked by an aromatic side chain in the reported hIL-16 structure, despite conservation of the GLGF motif. There is high sequence homology for IL-16 across mammalian species, with over 85% sequence similarity between human and murine IL-16. The extent of the conservation is even higher at the C-terminal peptide-binding interface associated with typical PDZ activity (Fig. 1B), strongly suggesting a conserved functional importance. However, the reported tight interaction between IL-16 and CD4 (Kd = 230 pm) has been proposed to involve a cluster of residues close to the C terminus of IL-16 (616RRKS619) (14.Lynch E.A. Heijens C.A. Horst N.F. Center D.M. Cruikshank W.W. et al.Cutting edge: IL-16/CD4 preferentially induces Th1 cell migration: requirement of CCR5.J.

Kornfeld H. et al.Identification of domains in IL-16 critical for biological activity.J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 1827-1832PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). IL-16 is associated with disease pathogenesis in a number of autoimmune conditions, with expression levels raised in serum from patients with rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and systemic lupus erythematosus (15.Glass W.G. Sarisky R.T. Vecchio A.M. et al.Not-so-sweet sixteen: the role of IL-16 in infectious and immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.J.

Theoharides T.C. et al.Interleukin-16 network in inflammation and allergy.Allergy Asthma Proc. 2002; 23: 103-108PubMed Google Scholar). The incubation of dendritic cells with a mouse anti-IL-16 monoclonal antibody (mAb 14.1) was reported to result in a significant reduction in cell migration in cultures of epidermal cells (22.Stoitzner P. Ratzinger G. Koch F. Janke K. Schöller T. Kaser A. Tilg H. Cruikshank W.W. Fritsch P. Romani N. et al.Interleukin-16 supports the migration of Langerhans cells, partly in a CD4-independent way.J. Invest. Dermatol. 2001; 116: 641-649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Furthermore, neutralization of hIL-16 by mAb 14.1 produced a reduction in the TH1-type inflammatory response (2.Cruikshank W. Little F. et al.Interleukin-16: the ins and outs of regulating T-cell activation.Crit. Rev. Immunol. 2008; 28: 467-483Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the mAb 14.1 antibody has shown in vivo efficacy in a rodent model of acute kidney injury (23.Wang S. Diao H. Guan Q. Cruikshank W.W. Delovitch T.L. Jevnikar A.M. Du C. et al.Decreased renal ischemia-reperfusion injury by IL-16 inactivation.Kidney Int. 2008; 73: 318-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The potential of hIL-16 as a therapeutic target in a range of autoimmune conditions has led to the development of a panel of inhibitory monoclonal antibodies. In this communication we report the structure of a promising Fab candidate (c14.1) based on mAb 14.1 bound to hIL-16, which reveals an unexpected binding site for the inhibitory antibody on the opposite face of the protein to the proposed CD4 binding site. In addition, the structure of the c14.1Fab·IL-16 complex reveals a significant conformational change in hIL-16, allowing residues from the CDR loops to make extensive contacts in the generic PDZ domain peptide-binding groove. This raises the possibility of the IL-16 PDZ domain modifying its activity via a cryptic peptide binding site. The structural changes induced in hIL-16 by the inhibitory antibody binding also reveal new opportunities for the design of small molecule inhibitors to target hIL-16 activity. A recombinant protein corresponding to mature secreted human IL-16 (residues 502–631) with an N-terminal His6 tag was expressed as a soluble product using a pLEICS-01 vector (Protex, University of Leicester) transformed into the Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) (Novagen). Uniformly 13C/15N/2D- and 15N-labeled hIL-16 were prepared by growing at 37 °C in modified Spizizen minimal medium (24.Spizizen J. et al.Transformation of biochemically deficient strains of Bacillus subtilis by deoxyribonucleate.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1958; 44: 1072-1078Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Anagnostopoulos C. Spizizen J. et al.Requirements for transformation in Bacillus subtilis.J. Bacteriol. 1961; 81: 741-746Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing 15NH4SO4 (4 g liter−1) and/or [13C6]glucose (2 g liter−1) as required, with deuterated samples grown in media dissolved in 100% D2O. The protein was purified to homogeneity by chromatography on affinity (nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column, Qiagen) and gel filtration (Superdex 75 16/60, GE Healthcare) columns, into a final buffer of 25 mm phosphate, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 100 μm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm imidazole. The His tag was removed prior to gel filtration using tobacco etch virus protease overnight at 4 °C. The DNA construct for the truncated form of human IL-16 (IL-16tr, residues 523–622) with an N-terminal His tag was cloned into pLEICS-01 and transformed in E. coli BL21 cells. The soluble protein was expressed in 2× YT media at 18 °C and purified to homogeneity by chromatography on affinity (nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column, Qiagen) and gel filtration (Superdex 75 16/60, GE Healthcare) columns, into a final buffer of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT. The His tag was removed prior to gel filtration using tobacco etch virus protease overnight at 4 °C. The variable domains from the heavy and light chains of the parent murine anti-IL-16 antibody (14.1) were identified by sequence analysis and subcloned into in-house pCMV-based vectors, containing a C-terminal reading frame for either the first constant domain of human IgG1 (CH1) or the human κ constant domain (CL), respectively. For expression of the c14.1Fab, the two plasmids encoding the heavy and light chain fragments were transiently co-transfected into Expi293FTM cells (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell cultures were maintained for 7–10 days in Expi293TM medium at 37 °C (130 rpm and ≤8% CO2 in humidified air) before supernatants were harvested by centrifugation, filter-sterilized (Stericup®; Merck Millipore), and stored at 4 °C until required. The secreted c14.1Fab was purified by affinity chromatography, with the harvested supernatant loaded onto a 1-ml KappaSelect column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, (PBS) and the bound antibody was eluted by 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.5–3.0. The final sample was desalted and buffer exchanged into PBS using a PD10 column (GE Healthcare). DNA inserts comprising hCD4 domains D1–D4 (residues 1–388) and hCD4 D3D4 (residues 202–388) were synthesized and cloned into pcDNA3 (Life Technologies). The hCD4 D3D4 insert also incorporated an additional N-terminal Igκ leader sequence to facilitate protein secretion. Both expression vectors also included a C-terminal His6 tag to enable affinity-based protein purification. For recombinant hCD4 expression, Expi293FTM cells (Life Technologies) were transiently transfected with plasmid DNA according to the manufacturer's instructions and cell cultures (0.2 liter) were maintained for 7–8 days in Expi293TM medium at 37 °C (130 rpm and ≤8% CO2 in humidified air). Supernatants were harvested by centrifugation, filter-sterilized (Stericup®; Merck Millipore), and subsequently stored at 4 °C. The two hCD4 extracellular region proteins (D1–D4 and D3D4) were purified to homogeneity using a HisTrap-excel column (GE Healthcare) and by size exclusion chromatography using either a Superdex 75 (16/60; GE Healthcare) or Superdex 200 (26/60; GE Healthcare), as appropriate, into a final buffer of PBS. The c14.1Fab·IL-16 and c14.1Fab·IL-16tr complexes were prepared by mixing the c14.1Fab with either hIL-16 or hIL-16tr at a Fab:IL-16 molar ratio of 1.2:1. The mixtures were incubated for 60 min at 4 °C, concentrated with a Vivaspin-20 to a final volume of 2.0 ml, and purified on a Superdex 75 16/60 column (GE Healthcare). The running buffer used was either 25 mm phosphate, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 100 μm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm imidazole or 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 50 mm NaCl, for the c14.1Fab·IL-16 and c14.1Fab·IL-16tr complexes, respectively. Fractions corresponding to the protein complex peak in each case were pooled and concentrated for NMR and crystallographic studies with a Vivaspin-20. As expected, the complex formation in both cases resulted in a significant shift in retention time on a Superdex 75 column compared with that for the free c14.1Fab and hIL-16. All NMR data were acquired on Bruker Avance III 600 and 800 MHz spectrometers equipped with 5-mm HCN cryoprobes. Both the hIL-16 and c14.1Fab·hIL-16 NMR samples were prepared at 150 μm in 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 100 mm NaCl, 100 μm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm imidazole in 90% H2O, 10% D2O. The two-dimensional 15N-1H TROSY spectra of hIL-16 were obtained at 25 and 35 °C, in the absence or presence of c14.1Fab, respectively. Typical acquisition times for the triple resonance experiments were 80 ms in F3 (1H), 22 ms in F2 (15N), and 6 or 25 ms in F1 (13C) as appropriate, with the spectra collected over ∼13–60 h. All datasets were non-uniform sampled to 25% and reconstructed using hmsIST software (26.Hyberts S.G. Milbradt A.G. Wagner A.B. Arthanari H. Wagner G. et al.Application of iterative soft thresholding for fast reconstruction of NMR data non-uniformly sampled with multidimensional Poisson Gap scheduling.J. Biomol. NMR. 2012; 52: 315-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Backbone amide chemical shifts for free hIL-16 were consistent with those reported previously. However, all backbone assignments were confirmed using three-dimensional HNCO, CBCACONH, and CBCANH experiments, allowing for the full assignment of peaks from the 15N-1H TROSY spectra. All NMR data were processed and analyzed using NMRPipe (27.Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. et al.NMRPipe: a multidimensional spectral processing system based on UNIX pipes.J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11549) Google Scholar) and SPARKY (University of California, San Francisco, CA) software. The minimal shift approach (28.Williamson R.A.

Freedman R.B. et al.Mapping the binding site for matrix metalloproteinase on the N-terminal domain of the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 by NMR chemical shift perturbation.Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13882-13889Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) was used to identify hIL-16 residues involved in c14.1Fab binding. Backbone amide minimal shift values were obtained from the combined chemical shift change in 15N and 1H for each assigned peak in the 15N/1H TROSY spectrum of the free 15N-labeled hIL-16, when compared with all peaks observed in the 15N/1H TROSY spectrum of the 15N-labeled hIL-16 bound to unlabeled c14.1Fab. A histogram of combined minimal shift versus protein sequence revealed residues from hIL-16 with backbone amide signals significantly perturbed by antibody binding. Initial crystallization trials for the c14.1Fab·IL-16tr complex were performed at 20 mg/ml using sitting drop vapor diffusion and 96-well block screens (Molecular Dimensions) at 20 °C. Optimal crystals of c14.1Fab·hIL-16tr grew in 16% PEG3350, 0.1 m Bistris propane, pH 6.5, and 0.2 m sodium sulfate. A cryoprotectant consisting of 22% (v/v) ethylene glycol in mother liquor was used. X-ray diffraction data were collected at the Diamond Light Source (Oxford, UK) using beamline I03. Diffraction data were indexed and integrated in Xds (29.Kabsch W. et al.Xds.Acta Crystallogr.

Residues from hIL-16 significantly perturbed by the interaction with the c14.1Fab were identified by comparison of 15N/1H TROSY spectra acquired for the free and antibody bound protein (Fig. 2). Comprehensive backbone and side chain assignments have been previously reported for hIL-16 (17.Mühlhahn P. Zweckstetter M. Georgescu J. Ciosto C. Renner C. Lanzendörfer M. Lang K. Ambrosius D.

Biol. 1998; 5: 682-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and it proved relatively straightforward to obtain nearly complete backbone resonance assignments for free hIL-16 under our experimental conditions. The observed minimal shifts in backbone amide signals of hIL-16 on complex formation are summarized in the histogram shown in Fig. 2A and mapped onto the structure of free hIL-16 to clearly identify a contiguous antibody interaction surface. c14.1Fab binding to hIL-16 results in very significant shifts (N-H Δδ ≥ 0.15 ppm) for 15 residues (Gly542, Gly544, Ser546, Gly549, Gly550, Ser553, Asp557, Thr561, Arg564, Met591, Arg596, Trp600, Asn601, Ile603, and Ala605), which form the interaction surface highlighted in Fig. 2B. These residues are predominantly localized to the β2 and β3 strands, the β2/β3 loop, and the n"

In this study, we further investigated the protective immunity of CVCVA5-adjuvanted oil-emulsion inactivated AI vaccine in chickens, ducks and geese. Compared to the commercial H5 inactivated vaccine, the H5-CVCVA5 vaccine induced significantly higher titers of hemaglutinin inhibitory antibodies in three lines of broiler chickens and ducks, elongated the antibody persistence periods in geese, elevated the levels of cross serum neutralization antibody against different clade and subclade H5 AI viruses in chicken embryos. High levels of mucosal antibody were detected in chickens injected with the H5 or H9-CVCA5 vaccine. Furthermore, cellular immune response was markedly improved in terms of increasing the serum levels of cytokine interferon-γ and interleukine 4, promoting proliferation of splenocytes and upregulating cytotoxicity activity in both H5- and H9-CVCVA5 vaccinated chickens. Together, these results provide evidence that AI vaccines supplemented with CVCVA5 adjuvant is a promising approach for overcoming the limitation of vaccine strain specificity of protection."

We aim to identify comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) based clinical factors associated with increased nutritional risk and develop a clinical scoring system to identify nutritional risk in elderly cancer patients.CGA data was collected from 249 Asian patients aged 70 years or older. Nutritional risk was assessed based on the Nutrition Screening Initiative (NSI) checklist. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were applied to assess the association between patient clinical factors together with domains within the CGA and moderate to high nutritional risk. Goodness of fit was assessed using Hosmer-Lemeshow test. Discrimination ability was assessed based on the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC). Internal validation was performed using simulated datasets via bootstrapping.Among the 249 patients, 184 (74%) had moderate to high nutritional risk. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified stage 3-4 disease (Odds Ratio [OR] 2.54; 95% CI, 1.14-5.69), ECOG performance status of 2-4 (OR 3.04; 95% CI, 1.57-5.88), presence of depression (OR 5.99; 95% CI, 1.99-18.02) and haemoglobin levels <12 g/dL (OR 3.00; 95% CI 1.54-5.84) as significant independent factors associated with moderate to high nutritional risk. The model achieved good calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow test's p = 0.17) and discrimination (AUC = 0.80). It retained good calibration and discrimination (bias-corrected AUC = 0.79) under internal validation.Having advanced stage of cancer, poor performance status, depression and anaemia were found to be predictors of moderate to high nutritional risk. Early identification of patients with these risk factors will allow for nutritional interventions that may improve treatment tolerance, quality of life and survival outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2405990534,"Despite recombinant protein technology development, proteins isolated from natural sources remain important for structure and activity determination. Ficolins represent a class of proteins that are difficult to isolate. To date, three methods for purifying ficolin-3 from plasma/serum have been proposed, defined by most critical step: (i) hydroxyapatite absorption chromatography (ii) N-acetylated human serum albumin affinity chromatography and (iii) anti-ficolin-3 monoclonal antibody-based affinity chromatography. We present a new protocol for purifying ficolin-3 complexes from human plasma that is based on an exclusive ligand: the O-specific polysaccharide of Hafnia alvei PCM 1200 LPS (O-PS 1200). The protocol includes (i) poly(ethylene glycol) precipitation; (ii) yeast and l-fucose incubation, for depletion of mannose-binding lectin; (iii) affinity chromatography using O-PS 1200-Sepharose; (iv) size-exclusion chromatography. Application of this protocol yielded average 2.2 mg of ficolin-3 preparation free of mannose-binding lectin (MBL), ficolin-1 and -2 from 500 ml of plasma. The protein was complexed with MBL-associated serine proteases (MASPs) and was able to activate the complement in vitro. In-process monitoring of MBL, ficolins, and total protein content revealed the presence of difficult-to-remove immunoglobulin G, M and A, in some extent in agreement with recent findings suggesting crosstalk between IgG and ficolin-3. We demonstrated that recombinant ficolin-3 interacts with IgG and IgM in a concentration-dependent manner. Although this association does not appear to influence ficolin-3-ligand interactions in vitro, it may have numerous consequences in vivo. Thus our purification procedure provides Ig-ficolin-3/MASP complexes that might be useful for gaining further insight into the crosstalk and biological activity of ficolin-3."
https://openalex.org/W2399904667,"Human GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) can produce a remarkable improvement in glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, its clinical benefits are limited by its short half-life, which is less than 2 min because of its small size and rapid enzymatic inactivation by dipeptidyl peptidase IV. We engineered GLP-1-IgG2σ-Fc, a 68-kDa fusion protein linking a variant human GLP-1 (A8G/G26E/R36G) to a human IgG2σ constant heavy-chain. A stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary cell line was obtained using electroporation. Western blotting showed that the expressed protein was immunoreactive to both GLP-1 and IgG antibodies. GLP-1-IgG2σ-Fc stimulated insulin secretion from INS-1 cells in a dose- and glucose-dependent manner and increased insulin mRNA expression. The half-life of GLP-1-IgG2σ-Fc in cynomolgus monkeys was approximately 57.1 ± 4.5 h. In the KKAy mouse model of diabetes, one intraperitoneal injection of GLP-1-IgG2σ-Fc (1 mg/kg) reduced blood glucose levels for 5 days. A 4-week repeat-administration study identified sustained effects on blood glucose levels. Oral glucose tolerance tests conducted at the beginning and end of this 4-week period showed that GLP-1-IgG2σ-Fc produced a stable glucose lowering effect. In addition, KKAy mice treated with GLP-1-IgG2σ-Fc showed statistically significant weight loss from day 23. In conclusion, these properties of GLP-1-IgG2σ-Fc demonstrated that it represented a potential long-acting GLP-1 receptor agonist for the treatment of type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2402377287,"Recent public health concerns regarding commercial food products have increased the need to develop an automated method to detect food product-related health events. We developed and verified a method for the early detection of potentially harmful events caused by commercial food products. We collected data from daily internet-based questionnaires examining the presence or absence of symptoms and information about food purchased by the respondents. Using these data, we developed a method to detect possible health concerns regarding commercialized food products. To achieve this, we combined the signal detection method used in the reporting system of adverse effects of pharmaceutical products and the Early Aberration Reporting System (EARS) used by the United States Centers for Disease Control. Whiteleg shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei), which had odds ratio and Odds(-) of 8.99 and 4.13, respectively, was identified as a possible causative food product for diarrhea and vomiting. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that food distributors can implement post-marketing monitoring of the safety of food products purchased via the internet."
https://openalex.org/W2403033556,"After 14 years in pharmaceutical discovery research, the first day of my new career in project management was disorienting. I was still at the company where I had been working as a researcher, but now my office was on the opposite side of the building. It had taken me a long time, and a lot of fits and starts, to get here. Between graduate school and two postdocs, I had spent nearly 12 years preparing for a career in pharmaceutical research, and I was reluctant to leave it. But after giving research three chances, I decided that it was time to explore a different path. Now, two-and-a-half years later, I don't regret my decision to leave the lab, and I am enjoying this second act of my career.

> “After giving research three chances, I decided … to explore a different path.” 

Early in my career, I thought my first position at a large pharmaceutical company, where I was surrounded by colleagues who had been there for 20 or 30 years, might be my one and only stop. It was a good entry-level job that allowed me to learn the basics of discovery research in big pharma, but after about 7 years, the company closed my site. Strike one.

I reasoned that these things happen, and it didn't take me too long to find a new job at a nearby biotech company. I was quickly promoted to a position that gave me a seat at the leadership table. I helped shape key decisions, and I was happy—until 18 months after starting, when I was laid off following a U.S. Food and Drug Administration decision that severely compromised the company's value and ability to raise capital. Strike two.

I felt defeated and taken aback by the capriciousness of corporate science. I saw that a corporate bench research position was no recipe for security. I reasoned that a career transcending specialization in one therapeutic area would be more stable and potentially allow me to cast a wider net. So, for my next job search, I considered nonbench careers for the first time.

I had colleagues who had left research careers for related fields, such as clinical trials management or patent law, that required either extensive further education or a drastic pay cut to land an entry-level position. I didn't want to take that route. Instead, I began looking for jobs that leveraged my research experience and leadership abilities and required skills I could learn on the job. My first nonbench job offer, for a medical writing position, felt a little too far from the bench, and I declined it. I interviewed for a sales and support position with a startup company but quickly realized that it was not for me. I even applied for an intriguing position with an investment firm hiring Ph.D.s to research financial opportunities—a job that I never imagined was possible for a Ph.D. scientist.

But I ended up declining an interview for that job (though I now wish I had learned more) because I had just accepted a principal scientist position at another big pharmaceutical company. I couldn't resist the familiarity and comfort. I had spent so much time and effort preparing for this career that I decided to give research one last chance.

I enjoyed this job tremendously. Unfortunately, there were still more reasons to lose a job than those I'd already experienced. This time, the company decided to cease work in my therapeutic area. Strike three.

So, finally, I chose to actively seek a change, and I ultimately moved into project management. The desire for a more stable, or at least more fungible, career was the practical appeal. The professional appeal was the opportunity to interact with and learn from professionals working across the full spectrum of pharmaceutical development, from discovery to brand launch and life cycle management. I enjoy the broad perspective and jack-of-all trades nature of the job, and I hope it will be my last career change.

Some former colleagues ask, “So, you're not doing science anymore?” Nothing could be further from the truth. My job cannot be done well without understanding both the science and strategy behind the programs I manage. I use my training every day, and I will always be a scientist at heart.
