https://openalex.org/W2810725306,"Most investigations to date aiming to identify the genetic basis of the stress response of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) have focused on the response to single stress agents such as high temperature or drought, even though in the natural situation, these stresses tend often to occur together. Here, a panel of 108 spring type bread wheat cultivars was phenotyped for 15 yield and yield related traits for two years (2014/15 and 2015/16) under non-stressed conditions, under high temperature stress, under drought and under a combined high temperature and drought regime. The mean loss in grain yield caused by all stress regimes was 51.33%. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) of yield trait showed significant differences among genotypes environments and their interactions (G×E). All the studied traits had higher heritability values which ranged from 0.35-0.94 under [C], 0.58-0.95 under [D], 0.62-0.93 under [H] and 0.60-0.95 under [HD]. GWAS was performed by using 9,646 informative SNP markers and based on these polymorphic SNPs population structure analysis divided whole germplasm into five major sub-populations. Mixed model association analysis detected 503 marker-trait associations (MTAs) at P ≤0.001 while 329 MTAs crossed FDR ≤ 0.05 for all traits with phenotypic variances (R2) ranged from 24.83% to 12.51%. Seven new pleiotropic SNPs on chromosome 7D and IAAV8258 (86.91cM) and wsnp_Ex_c7168_12311649 (57.93cM) on chromosome 5A were most stable association in present study. Furthermore, candidate genes Psy and Sr25 (TG0040) were also significant in present study, these genes were previously mapped on 7A and 7D. The region on 7D was assiociated with 7DL.7Ag translocation from Lophopyrum carring rust resistance Yr16 and many other genes. Similarly region on chromosome 7A which was associated with Psy gene was linked with grain yellow pigment content QTLs. Favourable alleles controlling grain yield were of vital importance and incorporation of these alleles after validation through marker assisted selection and fine mapping could be helpful in wheat yield improvement stress and non-stress conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2809798725,"Evaluation and prediction of the performance of hybrids is important in eggplant (Solanum melongena) breeding. A set of 10 morphologically highly diverse eggplant parents, including nine inbred S. melongena and one weedy S. insanum accessions, were intercrossed according to a half-diallel mating design without reciprocals to obtain 45 hybrids. Parents and hybrids were evaluated for 14 morphological and agronomic conventional descriptors and 14 fruit morphometric traits using Tomato Analyzer. Genetic distances among parents were estimated with 7,335 polymorphic SNP markers. Wide ranges of variation and significant differences were observed in the set of 55 genotypes for all traits, although the hybrids group had significantly higher vigour and yield than parents. General and specific combining abilities (GCA and SCA) were significant for most (GCA) or all (SCA) traits, although a wide variation was obtained for GCA/SCA ratios. Many relevant traits associated to vigour and yield had low GCA/SCA ratios and narrow-sense heritability (h2) values, while the reverse occurred for most fruit shape descriptors. Broad-sense heritability (H2) values were generally high, irrespective of GCA/SCA ratios. Significant correlations were found between traits related to size of leaf, flower and fruit, as well as among many fruit morphometric traits. Genetic distances (GD) among parents were coherent with their phylogenetic relationships, but few significant and generally low correlations were found between GD and hybrid means, heterosis or SCA. The results provide relevant information for developing appropriate strategies for parent selection and hybrid development in eggplant and suggest that GD among parents have limited value to predict hybrid performance in this crop."
https://openalex.org/W2811475117,"Systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses generally provide the best evidence for medical research. Authors are recommended to use flow diagrams to present the review process, allowing for better understanding among readers. However, no studies as of yet have assessed the quality of flow diagrams in systematic review/meta-analyses. Our study aims to evaluate the quality of systematic review/meta-analyses over a period of ten years, by assessing the quality of the flow diagrams, and the correlation to the methodological quality. Two hundred articles of ""systematic review"" and/or ""meta-analysis"" from January 2004 to August 2015 were randomly retrieved in Pubmed to be assessed for the flow diagram and methodological qualities. The flow diagrams were evaluated using a 16-grade scale corresponding to the four stages of PRISMA flow diagram. It composes four parts: Identification, Screening, Eligibility and Inclusion. Of the 200 articles screened, 154 articles were included and were assessed with AMSTAR checklist. Among them, 78 articles (50.6%) had the flow diagram. Over ten years, the proportion of papers with flow diagram available had been increasing significantly with regression coefficient beta = 5.649 (p = 0.002). However, the improvement in quality of the flow diagram increased slightly but not significantly (regression coefficient beta = 0.177, p = 0.133). Our analysis showed high variation in the proportion of articles that reported flow diagram components. The lowest proportions were 1% for reporting methods of duplicates removal in screening phase, followed by 6% for manual search in identification phase, 22% for number of studies for each specific/subgroup analysis, 27% for number of articles retrieved from each database, and 31% for number of studies included in qualitative analysis. The flow diagram quality was correlated with the methodological quality with the Pearson's coefficient r = 0.32 (p = 0.0039). Therefore, this review suggests that the reporting quality of flow diagram is less satisfactory, hence not maximizing the potential benefit of the flow diagrams. A guideline with standardized flow diagram is recommended to improve the quality of systematic reviews, and to enable better reader comprehension of the review process."
https://openalex.org/W2810202520,"Agricultural production must increase to feed a growing and wealthier population, as well as to satisfy increasing demands for biomaterials and biomass-based energy. At the same time, deforestation and land-use change need to be minimized in order to preserve biodiversity and maintain carbon stores in vegetation and soils. Consequently, agricultural land use needs to be intensified in order to increase food production per unit area of land. Here we use simulations of AgMIP’s Global Gridded Crop Model Intercomparison (GGCMI) phase 1 to assess implications of input-driven intensification (water, nutrients) on crop yield and yield stability, which is an important aspect in food security. We find region- and crop-specific responses for the simulated period 1980–2009 with broadly increasing yield variability under additional nitrogen inputs and stabilizing yields under additional water inputs (irrigation), reflecting current patterns of water and nutrient limitation. The different models of the GGCMI ensemble show similar response patterns, but model differences warrant further research on management assumptions, such as variety selection and soil management, and inputs as well as on model implementation of different soil and plant processes, such as on heat stress, and parameters. Higher variability in crop productivity under higher fertilizer input will require adequate buffer mechanisms in trade and distribution/storage networks to avoid food price volatility."
https://openalex.org/W2811014679,"The aim of this study was to establish an effective and safe protocol for in vivo oral candidiasis treatment with atmospheric plasma jets. A novel amplitude-modulated cold atmospheric pressure plasma jet (AM-CAPPJ) device, operating with Helium, was tested. In vitro assays with Candida albicans biofilms and Vero cells were performed in order to determine the effective parameters with low cytotoxicity. After the determination of such parameters, the protocol was evaluated in experimentally induced oral candidiasis in mice. AM-CAPPJ could significantly reduce the viability of C. albicans biofilms after 5 minutes of plasma exposure when compared to the non-exposed group (p = 0.0033). After this period of exposure, high viability of Vero cells was maintained (86.33 ± 10.45%). Also, no late effects on these cells were observed after 24 and 48 hours (83.24±15.23% and 88.96±18.65%, respectively). Histological analyses revealed significantly lower occurrence of inflammatory alterations in the AM-CAPPJ group when compared to non-treated and nystatin-treated groups (p < 0.0001). Although no significant differences among the values of CFU/tongue were observed among the non-treated group and the groups treated with AM-CAPPJ or nystatin (p = 0.3201), histological analyses revealed marked reduction in candidal tissue invasion. In conclusion, these results point out to a clinical applicability of this protocol, due to the simultaneous anti-inflammatory and inhibitory effects of AM-CAPPJ with low cytotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2810942942,"Identifying maize inbred lines that are more efficient in nitrogen (N) use is an important strategy and a necessity in the context of environmental and economic impacts attributed to the excessive N fertilization. N-uptake efficiency (NUpE) and N-utilization efficiency (NUtE) are components of N-use efficiency (NUE). Despite the most maize breeding data have a multi-trait structure, they are often analyzed under a single-trait framework. We aimed to estimate the genetic parameters for NUpE and NUtE in contrasting N levels, in order to identify superior maize inbred lines, and to propose a Bayesian multi-trait multi-environment (MTME) model. Sixty-four tropical maize inbred lines were evaluated in two experiments: at high (HN) and low N (LN) levels. The MTME model was compared to single-trait multi-environment (STME) models. Based on deviance information criteria (DIC), both multi- and single-trait models revealed genotypes x environments (G x E) interaction. In the MTME model, NUpE was found to be weakly heritable with posterior modes of heritability of 0.016 and 0.023 under HN and LN, respectively. NUtE at HN was found to be highly heritable (0.490), whereas under LN condition it was moderately heritable (0.215). We adopted the MTME model, since combined analysis often presents more accurate breeding values than single models. Superior inbred lines for NUpE and NUtE were identified and this information can be used to plan crosses to obtain maize hybrids that have superior nitrogen use efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2810429781,"Background Functional social support has a stronger association with medical treatment adherence than structural social support in several populations and disease conditions. Using a contemporary U.S. population of adults treated with medications for coronary heart disease (CHD) risk factors, the association between social support and medication adherence was examined. Methods We included 17,113 black and white men and women with CHD or CHD risk factors aged ≥45 years recruited 2003–2007 from the REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study. Participants reported their perceived social support (structural social support: being partnered, number of close friends, number of close relatives, and number of other adults in household; functional social support: having a caregiver in case of sickness or disability; combination of structural and functional social support: number of close friends or relatives seen at least monthly). Medication adherence was assessed using a 4-item scale. Multi-variable adjusted Poisson regression models were used to calculate prevalence ratios (PR) for the association between social support and medication adherence. Results Prevalence of medication adherence was 68.9%. Participants who saw >10 close friends or relatives at least monthly had higher prevalence of medication adherence (PR = 1.06; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.11) than those who saw ≤3 per month. Having a caregiver in case of sickness or disability, being partnered, number of close friends, number of close relatives, and number of other adults in household were not associated with medication adherence after adjusting for covariates. Conclusions Seeing multiple friends and relatives was associated with better medication adherence among individuals with CHD risk factors. Increasing social support with combined structural and functional components may help support medication adherence."
https://openalex.org/W2810306025,"The current study examined micro RNA (miRNAs) clusters from the maternal plasma to determine their association with preterm birth (PTB) and infant birth outcomes. A subsample of 42 participants who spontaneously delivered either preterm (≤37 weeks) or term was selected from a parent sample of 515 pregnant Mexican American women. Plasma samples and prenatal data were collected at a single mid-gestation time point (22–24 weeks’ gestation) and birth outcomes were obtained from medical records after delivery. Circulating miRNAs were analyzed by qPCR. When miRNAs were grouped according to chromosomal cluster rather than expression level, individual miRNAs correlated strongly with other individual miRNAs within their respective genomic locus. miRNAs from the c19mc cluster negatively correlated with c14mc miRNAs, and this relationship was more pronounced in PTB. Clusters c14mc was negatively associated with length of gestation; while the c19mc was positively associated with length of gestation and infant head circumference. Together, these findings suggest that groups of miRNAs from common chromosomal clusters, rather than individual miRNAs, operate as co-regulated groups of signaling molecules to coordinate length of gestation and infant outcomes. From this evidence, differences in cluster-wide expression of miRNAs are involved in spontaneous PTB."
https://openalex.org/W2810815086,"Protein-protein interactions integrated with disease-gene associations represent important information for revealing protein functions under disease conditions to improve the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of complex diseases. Although several studies have attempted to identify disease-gene associations, the number of possible disease-gene associations is very small. High-throughput technologies have been established experimentally to identify the association between genes and diseases. However, these techniques are still quite expensive, time consuming, and even difficult to perform. Thus, based on currently available data and knowledge, computational methods have served as alternatives to provide more possible associations to increase our understanding of disease mechanisms. Here, a new network-based algorithm, namely, Disease-Gene Association (DGA), was developed to calculate the association score of a query gene to a new possible set of diseases. First, a large-scale protein interaction network was constructed, and the relationship between two interacting proteins was calculated with regard to the disease relationship. Novel plausible disease-gene pairs were identified and statistically scored by our algorithm using neighboring protein information. The results yielded high performance for disease-gene prediction, with an F-measure of 0.78 and an AUC of 0.86. To identify promising candidates of disease-gene associations, the association coverage of genes and diseases were calculated and used with the association score to perform gene and disease selection. Based on gene selection, we identified promising pairs that exhibited evidence related to several important diseases, e.g., inflammation, lipid metabolism, inborn errors, xanthomatosis, cerebellar ataxia, cognitive deterioration, malignant neoplasms of the skin and malignant tumors of the cervix. Focusing on disease selection, we identified target genes that were important to blistering skin diseases and muscular dystrophy. In summary, our developed algorithm is simple, efficiently identifies disease–gene associations in the protein-protein interaction network and provides additional knowledge regarding disease-gene associations. This method can be generalized to other association studies to further advance biomedical science."
https://openalex.org/W2811368821,"In this paper we have theoretically predicted a novel pathway for the mutagenic tautomerization of the classical A∙T DNA base pairs in the free state, the Watson-Crick A·Т(WC), reverse Watson-Crick A·Т(rWC), Hoogsteen A·Т(H) and reverse Hoogsteen A·Т(rH) pairs, via sequential proton transfer accompanied by a significant change in the mutual orientation of the bases. Quantum-mechanical (QM) calculations were performed at the MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ//B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) level in vacuum phase, along with Bader's quantum theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM). These processes involve transition states (TSs) with quasi-orthogonal structures (symmetry C1), which are highly polar, tight ion pairs (A-, N6H2-deprotonated)∙(T+, O4/O2-protonated). Gibbs free energies of activation for the A∙T(WC) / A∙T(rWC) ↔ A*∙Т(rwWC) / A*∙Т(wWC) tautomeric transitions (~43.5 kcal∙mol-1) are lower than for the A∙T(H) / A∙T(rH) ↔ A*N7∙Т(rwH) / A*N7∙Т(wH) tautomerisations (~53.0 kcal∙mol-1) (rare tautomers are marked by an asterisk; w-wobble configured tautomerisation products). The (T)N3+H⋯N1-(A), (T)O4+H⋯N1-(A) / (T)N3+H⋯N1-(A) and (T)O2+H⋯N1-(A) H-bonds are found in the transition states TSA-·T+A·T(WC)↔A*·T(rwWC) / TSA-·T+A·T(rWC)↔A*·T(wWC). However, in the transition state TSA-·T+A·Т(H)↔A*N7·T(rwH) / TSA-·T+A·Т(rH)↔A*N7·T(wH), the (T)N3+H⋯N7-(A), (T)O4+H⋯N7-(A) / (T)N3+H⋯N7-(A) and (T)O2+H⋯N7-(A) H-bonds are supplemented by the attractive (T)O4+/O2+⋯N6-(A) van der Waals contacts. It was demonstrated that the products of the tautomerization of the classical A∙T DNA base pairs-A*∙Т(rwWC), A*N7∙Т(rwH) and A*N7∙Т(wH) (symmetry Cs)-further transform via double proton transfer into the energetically favorable wobble A∙T*(rwWC), A∙T*(rwH) and A∙T*O2(wH) base mispairs (symmetry Cs)."
https://openalex.org/W2811482795,"On 20 June 2015, a cholera outbreak affecting more than 30 people was reported in a fishing village, Katwe, in Kasese District, south-western Uganda. We investigated this outbreak to identify the mode of transmission and to recommend control measures. We defined a suspected case as onset of acute watery diarrhoea between 1 June and 15 July 2015 in a resident of Katwe village; a confirmed case was a suspected case with Vibrio cholerae cultured from stool. For case finding, we reviewed medical records and actively searched for cases in the community. In a case-control investigation we compared exposure histories of 32 suspected case-persons and 128 age-matched controls. We also conducted an environmental assessment on how the exposures had occurred. We found 61 suspected cases (attack rate = 4.9/1000) during this outbreak, of which eight were confirmed. The primary case-person had onset on 16 June; afterwards cases sharply increased, peaked on 19 June, and rapidly declined afterwards. After 22 June, eight scattered cases occurred. The case-control investigation showed that 97% (31/32) of cases and 62% (79/128) of controls usually collected water from inside a water-collection site “X” (ORM-H = 16; 95% CI = 2.4–107). The primary case-person who developed symptoms while fishing, reportedly came ashore in the early morning hours on 17 June, and defecated “near” water-collection site X. We concluded that this cholera outbreak was caused by drinking lake water collected from inside the lakeshore water-collection site X. At our recommendations, the village administration provided water chlorination tablets to the villagers, issued water boiling advisory to the villagers, rigorously disinfected all patients’ faeces and, three weeks later, fixed the tap-water system."
https://openalex.org/W2810072554,"Universal access to quality early childhood development and care is a fundamental part of Sustainable Development Goal 4.2.1. Research from diverse settings, including that in low and middle income countries, now demonstrates the positive impact that interventions to promote play, stimulation, early communication and responsiveness can have, not just on child development, but on long term gains in education and economic growth. International agencies have recently produced the Nurturing Care Framework for Early Child Development in order to promote this and to encourage countries to move the focus from child survival to child thrival. Research on the best methods of integration of these programmes into present care practices, particularly in African settings is still very limited.We used qualitative methods to gain an understanding of care practices (play, developmental stimulation, early communication and responsive feeding) for children 0-2 years. We conducted 18 focus groups (FGDs), six PFGDs (Participatory Research focus groups), 18 in depth interviews (IDIs) and 20 observations with caregivers in rural and urban settings of Malawi. We used a topic guide, audio-recorded the FGDs and IDIS and transcribed them in Chichewa or Yao and then into English. We coded data using an inductive approach to thematic analysis. We placed the data within a framework with the emerging major and minor themes. We conducted quality assurance for translations and coding frameworks through cross comparison of data and used respondent validation to check our results.Malawian caregivers see children's play as a consequence of good health and wellbeing, less an interaction that a parent undertakes to promote wellbeing and learning. Non-verbal communication and responsiveness with infants is clearly present and caregivers have many one-on-one interactions with young infants. Furthermore, many caregivers have good knowledge of feeding recommendations but cannot always follow these due to constraints on money. When children become mobile (toddlers), play is an activity done more often between children or with other caregivers such as siblings or grandparents. Community members consider that caring for children from 0-2 years is a woman's domain. Despite this, both men and women acknowledge the importance of maternal wellbeing in enabling good care of children. The present socioeconomic situation of most families in our study means that income generation and food security come first. Many mothers spend most of their time managing the responsibilities of daily living and have limited time to dedicate to children's play, responsiveness and communication with their children.Programmes promoted as part of the Nurturing Care Framework which provide advice on developmental stimulation, play, early communication and responsive feeding should ensure that topics within these programmes are culturally appropriate for the setting. Furthermore, programmes must not be an added burden to parents but be supportive to parents managing many responsibilities of daily living. Multi-sectorial approaches where both men and women are provided with knowledge but are also supported through programmes which address family finances, safe spaces for children whilst families are working, and family mental health and relationships may enable programmes to work more effectively."
https://openalex.org/W2810369258,"Aim The aim of this study was to determine and to verify the correlation between the amount of prolactin (PRL) levels in the blood and in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by various causes of death as an indicator for acute hypoxia in autopsy cases. It is to confirm the cause of the change in prolactin level in CSF by in vitro system. Materials and methods In autopsy materials, the PRL levels in blood from the right heart ventricle and in the CSF were measured by chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay, and changes in the percentage of PRL-positive cells in the pituitary gland were examined using an immunohistochemical method. Furthermore, an inverted culture method was used as an in vitro model of the blood-CSF barrier using epithelial cells of the human choroid plexus (HIBCPP cell line) and SDR-P-1D5 or MSH-P3 (PRL-secreting cell line derived from miniature swine hypophysis) under normoxic or hypoxic (5% oxygen) conditions, and as an index of cell activity, we used Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF). Results and discussion Serum PRL levels were not significantly different between hypoxia/ischemia cases and other causes of death. However, PRL levels in CSF were three times higher in cases of hypoxia/ischemia than in those of the other causes of death. In the cultured cell under the hypoxia condition, PRL and VEGF showed a high concentration at 10 min. We established a brain-CSF barrier model to clarify the mechanism of PRL transport to CSF from blood, the PRL concentrations from blood to CSF increased under hypoxic conditions from 5 min. These results suggested that PRL moves in CSF through choroidal epithelium from blood within a short time. PRL is hypothesized to protect the hypoxic/ischemic brain, and this may be because of the increased transportation of the choroid plexus epithelial cells."

Information on the epidemiology of chronic kidney disease and associated risk factors is limited in the United Arab Emirates. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the incidence and causes of chronic kidney disease stages 3–5 in adult United Arab Emirates nationals with or at high risk of cardiovascular disease. This retrospective study included 491 adults with or at high risk of cardiovascular disease (diabetes mellitus or associated clinical disease) who attended outpatient clinics at a tertiary care hospital in Al-Ain, United Arab Emirates. Estimated glomerular filtration rate was assessed every 3 months from baseline to June 30, 2017. Chronic kidney disease stages 3–5 were defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for ≥ 3 months. Multivariable Cox's proportional hazards analysis was used to determine the independent risk factors associated with developing chronic kidney disease stages 3–5. The cumulative incidence of chronic kidney disease stages 3–5 over a 9-year period was 11.4% (95% confidence interval 8.6, 14.0). The incidence rate of these disease stages was 164.8 (95% confidence interval 121.6, 207.9) per 10,000 person-years. The independent risk factors for developing chronic kidney disease stages 3–5 were older age, history of coronary heart disease, history of diabetes mellitus, and history of smoking. These data may be useful to develop effective strategies to prevent chronic kidney disease development in high-risk United Arab Emirates nationals."
https://openalex.org/W2810179646,"Organisms may energetically finance reproductive effort using energy stored prior to the reproductive period (termed capital breeders) or using energy acquired during the reproductive period (termed income breeders). The specific strategy used has implications for population dynamics as well as for the response to environmental variation. Crabs and other crustaceans have generally been assumed to be capital breeders. Here I demonstrate an experimental procedure used to determine whether crabs are capable of using an income breeding strategy. I then examine data from several published studies from a range of crab species across a broad phylogenetic spectrum that conducted similar experiments to look for evidence of income breeding strategy. I show that income breeding does occur in crabs, but that it appears to be taxon-specific. In particular, I show that income breeding occurs in two species from the family Portunidae, but fail to find evidence for income breeding in other taxa examined. This finding has a range of implications for this ecologically and economically important group of consumers, including implications for their response to human-induced environmental change, their response to fishing pressure, and best practices for aquaculture. The implications of breeding strategy in crabs likely depends on phylogeny (morphology) and ecology, both of which influence the space available for energy storage inside the carapace."
https://openalex.org/W2810483586,"This paper presents the results of research into pathways leading to the production of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) in sediments of two eutrophic reservoirs (Maziarnia and Nielisz), located in south-eastern Poland. In seeking to identify the pathways in question, use was made of analysis of stable carbon isotopes in CH4 and CO2 dissolved in pore water. This determined that CH4 is mainly produced through acetate fermentation, though the hydrogenotrophic methanogenic process may also be of importance, especially in deeper layers of sediments. Both the presence of autochthonous organic matter and increased pH values are shown to favour acetate fermentation. In turn, methanogenesis in sediments is assessed as capable of accounting for the generation of a considerable amount of CO2. Indeed, the role of methanogenesis in CO2 production is increasingly important further down in the layers of sediment, where allochthonous organic matter is predominant."
https://openalex.org/W2811214216,"The use of the tellurium-centered Anderson−Evans polyoxotungstate [TeW6O24]6− (TEW) as a crystallization additive has been described. Here, we present the use of TEW as an additive in the crystallization screening of the nucleotide binding domain (NBD) of HSP70. Crystallization screening of the HSP70 NBD in the absence of TEW using a standard commercial screen resulted in a single crystal form. An identical crystallization screen of the HSP70 NBD in the presence of TEW resulted in both the “TEW free” crystal form and an additional crystal form with a different crystal packing. TEW binding was observed in both crystal forms, either as a well-defined molecule or in overlapping alternate positions suggesting translational disorder. The structures were solved by both molecular replacement and single wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) using the anomalous signal of a single bound molecule of TEW. This study adds one more example of TEW binding to a protein and influencing its crystallization behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2810928158,"Background Penile carcinoma (PC) is a rare, highly mutilating disease, common in developing countries. The evolution of penile cancer includes at least two independent carcinogenic pathways, related or unrelated to HPV infection. Objectives To estimate the prevalence, identify HPV genotypes, and correlate with clinicopathological data on penile cancer. Methods A retrospective cohort study involving 183 patients with PC undergoing treatment in a referral hospital in Goiânia, Goiás, in Midwestern Brazil, from 2003 to 2015. Samples containing paraffin embedded tumor fragments were subjected to detection and genotyping by INNO-LiPA HPV. The clinicopathological variables were subjected to analysis with respect to HPV positivity and used prevalence ratio (PR), adjusted prevalence ratio (PRa) and 95% confidence interval (CI) as statistical measures. Results The prevalence of HPV DNA in PC was 30.6% (95% CI: 24.4 to 37.6), high-risk HPV 24.9% (95% CI: 18.9 to 31.3), and 62.5% were HPV 16. There was a statistical association between the endpoints HPV infection and HPV high risk, and the variable tumor grade II-III (p = 0.025) (p = 0.040), respectively. There was no statistical difference in disease specific survival at 10 years between the HPV positive and negative patients (p = 0.143), and high and low risk HPV (p = 0.325). Conclusions The prevalence of HPV infection was 30.6%, and 80.3% of the genotypes were identified as preventable by anti-HPV quadrivalent or nonavalent vaccine. HPV infections and high-risk HPV were not associated with penile carcinoma prognosis in this study."
https://openalex.org/W2811036879,"When we drop an object from our hands, we use internal models of both our body height and object-motion to predict when it will hit the floor. What happens if the sensory feedback finally received from the impact conflicts with this prediction? The present study shows that such conflict results in changes in the internal estimates of our body height: When the object people dropped takes longer than expected to hit the floor, they report feeling taller and behave as if their legs were longer. This provides the first evidence of cross-modal recalibration of body-height representations as a function of changes in the distant environment. Crucially, the recalibration results from a mismatch between the predicted and actual outcome of an action, the ball's release and impact, which are causally-related but separated in space and time. These results suggest that implicit models of object-motion can interact with implicit and explicit models of one's body height."
https://openalex.org/W2809964986,"With the extirpation of tigers from the Indonesian island of Java in the 1980s, the endemic and Critically Endangered Javan leopard is the island's last remaining large carnivore. Yet despite this, it has received little conservation attention and its population status and distribution remains poorly known. Using Maxent modeling, we predicted the locations of suitable leopard landscapes throughout the island of Java based on 228 verified Javan leopard samples and as a function of seven environmental variables. The identified landscapes covered over 1 million hectares, representing less than 9% of the island. Direct evidence of Javan leopard was confirmed from 22 of the 29 identified landscapes and included all national parks, which our analysis revealed as the single most important land type. Our study also emphasized the importance of maintaining connectivity between protected areas and human-modified landscapes because adjacent production forests and secondary forests were found to provide vital extensions for several Javan leopard subpopulations. Our predictive map greatly improves those previously produced by the Government of Indonesia's Javan Leopard Action Plan and the IUCN global leopard distribution assessment. It shares only a 32% overlap with the IUCN range predictions, adds six new priority landscapes, all with confirmed presence of Javan leopard, and reveals an island-wide leopard population that occurs in several highly fragmented landscapes, which are far more isolated than previously thought. Our study provides reliable information on where conservation efforts must be prioritized both inside and outside of the protected area network to safeguard Java's last remaining large carnivore."

Results Networks consisted of median nine professionals (range 5–22) covering medical, care and welfare disciplines. Their follow-up was 1–2 years. Average yearly increase was 2.03 (95%-CI:1.20–2.96) on network maturity and 8.45 (95%-CI:2.80–14.69) on quality indicator score. High primary care practice involvement and strong leadership proved essential in the transition towards more mature networks with better quality of care. Discussion Progress towards more mature networks favored quality of care improvements. DementiaNet appeared to be effective to realize transition towards network-based care, enhance multidisciplinary collaboration, and improve quality of dementia care."
https://openalex.org/W2810439912,"Objective The prevalence of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is rising rapidly. However, there are no reliable serum biomarkers for PTC. This study aimed to investigate the validity of preoperative serum matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) as a biomarker for predicting prognosis of PTC after total or partial thyroidectomy. Methods Male patients with PTC or a benign thyroid nodule (BTN) and healthy controls (HCs) were retrospectively included. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to evaluate the performance of preoperative serum MMP-2 in diagnosing PTC, predicting lymph node metastasis (LNM), and predicting structurally persistent/recurrent disease (SPRD). Multivariate logistic regression and Cox regression were applied to identify independent risk factors for SPRD. Results The preoperative serum MMP-2 concentration in the PTC group was higher than those in BTN and HC groups. The concentration of postoperative serum MMP-2 decreased in comparison with pre-operation. ROC curves showed that serum MMP-2 could differentially diagnose PTC from BTN at the cutoff value of 86.30 ng/ml with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.905 and could predict central LNM (CLNM) at the cutoff value of 101.55 ng/ml with an AUC of 0.711. Serum MMP-2 ≥101.55 ng/ml, age ≥45 years, and advanced TNM stage were independent risk factors for CLNM. Patients with SPRD had a higher median MMP-2 level (149.22 ng/ml) than patients without SPRD (104.55 ng/ml). Serum MMP-2 at the cutoff value of 144.04 ng/ml could predict SPRD in PTC patients with an AUC of 0.803. Advanced TNM stage and serum MMP-2 ≥144.04 ng/ml were independent risk factors for SPRD. Patients with serum MMP-2 ≥144.04 ng/ml had a worse clinical outcome than those with MMP-2 <144.04 ng/ml. Conclusion Preoperative serum MMP-2 may serve as a biomarker for diagnosing PTC and a predictive indicator for LNM and SPRD in male patients with PTC."
https://openalex.org/W2810908472,"Despite the abundance of plants that benefit from fire in Mediterranean ecosystems, little is known about the possible presence of fire-favoured insects (other than bark beetles). For two years we sampled invertebrates after two large wildfires in eastern Spain and demonstrate that two flower beetle species, Protaetia morio and P. oblonga (Cetoniidae), show a pyrophilous behaviour. These beetles were much more numerous after the fires than in unburnt plots around the fire perimeter; in addition, these species tended to increase in number with the distance from the fire perimeter and with fire recurrence, especially P. morio. These results were maintained for the two postfire years sampled. The results for the beetles do not support the hypothesis of postfire colonization, but that local populations survived the fire as eggs or larvae protected in the soil (endogenous persistence). We propose that the increase in population size (compared with unburnt zones) could be driven by the reduction of their predator populations, as vertebrates that feed on these beetles were disfavoured by fire. That is, the results suggest that these flower beetle species benefit from fire because fire disrupts antagonistic interactions with their predators (predation release hypothesis). Given the omnipresence of small mammals, soil insects, and fires, the processes described here are likely to be general but unexplored."
https://openalex.org/W2811315318,"Objective Recent studies in the US and abroad suggest that boys are undergoing puberty at a younger age. It is unknown if this secular trend extends to boys with central precocious puberty (CPP), who sit at the extreme end of the pubertal spectrum, and if neuroimaging should remain a standard diagnostic tool. Study design Retrospective chart review of all boys with CPP seen by Endocrinology at a US pediatric hospital from 2001–2010. Results Fifty boys had pubertal onset at an average age of 7.31 years (95CI 6.83–7.89), though many did not present until nearly one year thereafter, by which time 30% were mid-to-late pubertal. Boys were predominantly non-Hispanic White and 64% were overweight/obese. The majority (64%) of boys had neurogenic CPP (CNS-CPP) with neurofibromatosis type I being the most common diagnosis. Diagnosis of CPP led to discovery of a neurogenic lesion in only 3 of 32 (9%) CNS-CPP cases. The remaining boys, with idiopathic CPP (36%), were indistinguishable from those with CNS-CPP aside from four boys who endorsed a family history of PP (22% vs. 0% among CNS-CPP cases). Importantly, there was no change in the incidence of male CPP after accounting for the increase in clinic volume during this time period. Conclusion In this contemporary Boston-based cohort of 50 boys with CPP, most cases were neurogenic, consistent with older literature. Several idiopathic cases had a family history of PP but were otherwise indistinguishable from CNS-CPP cases. Thus, neuroimaging remains a critical diagnostic tool. We find no evidence for an increase in the prevalence of male CPP."
https://openalex.org/W2811151754,"Variation in partner species and frequency of interaction between species pairs are potential drivers of the net outcome of generalized mutualisms. In ant-plant mutualisms, the quality of defence provided by ants is related to ant aggressiveness. Hence, we hypothesize that the performance of plants bearing extrafloral nectaries will be higher when they interact more frequently with more aggressive ant species. We estimated ant aggressiveness in the field by observing their behaviour towards soil baits. Afterwards, we observed the frequency with which individuals from these ant species visited plants through an entire reproductive cycle. We measured the production and persistence of plants reproductive structures through this period and the total seed production. Increasing in the interaction frequency with highly aggressive ants reduced the number of floral buds and seeds produced. Increased visitation frequency by less aggressive ants increased the number of floral buds and seeds per branch. The inverse relationship between ant aggressiveness and seed production may be influenced by the costs imposed by different mutualistic partners. Thus, frequent interaction with highly aggressive ants may lead to a higher accumulation of costs through time, resulting in a negative net outcome for the plants. Our results bring new evidence highlighting the importance to incorporate temporal aspects in the study of mutualistic interactions. We suggests that the quality of mutualistic partners must be understood as a function of its per-interaction benefit and their cumulative costs to their partner over time, what puts in check our current classification regarding partner quality in mutualistic systems."
https://openalex.org/W2810910038,"The genetic variability and population structure of three Bhutanese traditional horse breeds were assessed through genotyping of 74 horses (Boeta 25, Sharta 14 and Yuta 35) for 29 microsatellite DNA loci. Altogether, 282 alleles were detected across 29 polymorphic loci. The allelic diversity (NE) (Boeta 4.94; Sharta 4.65; Yuta 5.30) and gene diversities (HE) (Boeta 0.78; Sharta 0.77; Yuta 0.79) were high. None of the breeds deviated significantly from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. There was no sign of significant population bottleneck for all the breeds. The inbreeding estimates (FIS) of the breeds were low (Boeta 0.023; Sharta 0.001; Yuta 0.021). Analysis of molecular variance showed 0.6% of the total genetic variation among breeds, 1.9% among individuals and 97.5% within individuals. The global FIT, FST, and FIS estimates for the population were 0.025, 0.006 and 0.019 respectively. The analysis of population structure failed to distinguish subpopulations in traditional horses and this was supported by a high genetic exchange among the breeds. Overall, the results of this study suggest a rich genetic diversity in the traditional horse despite a very low genetic differentiation among the breeds in Bhutan."
https://openalex.org/W2810925504,"The mirid bug, Apolygus lucorum Meyer-Dür, has been an important pest of cotton crop in China, and is primarily controlled with insecticides, such as pyrethroids. To elucidate the potential resistant mechanisms of A. lucorum to lambda-cyhalothrin, a series of biological, biochemical, and molecular assays were conducted in the reference (AL-S) and lambda-cyhalothrin-resistant (AL-R) populations. Comparison of the molecular target of pyrethroid insecticides, voltage-gated sodium channel, revealed that there were no mutation sites in the resistant population, indicating target insensitivity is not responsible for increased resistance of AL-R to lambda-cyhalothrin. Furthermore, the synergism assays and the activities of detoxification enzymes were performed to determine detoxification mechanism conferring the lambda-cyhalothrin resistance. In the tested synergists, the piperonyl butoxide had the highest synergism ratio against lambda-cyhalothrin, which was up to five-fold in both populations. In addition, the result also showed that only cytochrome P450 had significantly higher O-deethylase activity with 7-ethoxycoumarin (1.78-fold) in AL-R population compared with AL-S population. Seven cytochrome P450 genes were found to be significantly overexpressed in the resistant AL-R population compared with AL-S population. Taken together, these results demonstrate that multiple over-transcribed cytochrome P450 genes would be involved in the development of lambda-cyhalothrin resistance in AL-R population."
https://openalex.org/W2811438129,"Leptin is an adipo-myokine that regulates appetite and energy expenditure by a neuroendocrine feedback loop. Leptin levels are positively correlated with BMI in the spinal cord injury population and leptin levels are greater in individuals with spinal cord injury compared to uninjured controls. Leptin is produced in multiple tissues, including fat, bone, and skeletal muscle and is a putative biomarker of sedentary behavior in older adults. We assessed body composition leptin, adiponectin, and IL-6 levels in 205 men with chronic spinal cord injury. We found no association between age, injury duration, injury level, injury completeness, or walking status and leptin. There was a significant positive association between lean mass and leptin in men with SCI that was independent of fat. Adjusting for body composition, leptin levels were positively associated with IL-6 and negatively associated with adiponectin levels. When considering men with SCI and sarcopenic obesity, only fat mass remained positively associated with leptin. We found no association between IL-6, adiponectin, or lean mass and leptin in the sarcopenic obesity group. Our findings suggest that lean mass is an under recognized, but substantial, source of circulating leptin. Furthermore, SCI-related sarcopenic obesity may result in dysregulated adipo-myokine metabolism with local and systemic physiologic effects."
https://openalex.org/W2810011308,"Background Difficulties in emotion regulation have been related to psychological and physiological stress responses such as lower mood and lower parasympathetic activation (HF-HRV) under resting condition, but evidence on the potential link to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis functioning and to physiological stress responses during a stress task is still scarce. The aim of the study was to investigate stress responses in young women when confronted to a daily stressor such as exposure to thin ideals and to understand the role of correlates of self-reported trait-like emotion regulation difficulties (ERD). Methods Heart rate variability (HRV) and salivary cortisol data were collected in a sample of 273 young women aged 18–35 with and without mental disorders during a vivid imagination of thin ideals (experimental condition) or landscapes (control condition). Changes in mood states were measured on a visual analogue scale (0–100). Correlates of trait-like ERD were self-reported using the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS). Results Participants with higher ERD showed a stronger decline in self-reported mood after vivid imagination of thin ideals compared to participants with lower ERD in the experimental condition but also a stronger increase of positive mood with increasing ERD in the control condition. ERD were not related to baseline HF-HRV or baseline salivary cortisol levels nor to any physiological response during and after the imagination of thin ideals. Discussion and conclusion The results corroborate the role of ERD regarding the immediate psychological impact of daily stressors. Exposition to daily stressors in the laboratory results in discrepant psychological and physiological reactivity. Future studies should investigate under what conditions the complex interrelations between immediate and long-term ERD and biological activation are amenable to assessment in a laboratory setting. The additive effects of multiple exposition to stressors, such as thin ideals in daily life, also need to be addressed."
https://openalex.org/W2810247523,"Surveys of foliar endophytes from the Acadian forest region over the past three decades have identified numerous phylogenetically diverse fungi producing natural products toxic to forest pests and diseases. The life histories of some conifer endophytes can be restricted to plant foliage or may include saprotrophic phases on other plants tissues or even alternate hosts. Considering the potentially broad host preferences of conifer endophytes we explored fungi isolated from understory species and their metabolites as part of an ongoing investigation of fungal biodiversity from the Acadian forest. We report a hitherto unidentified Xylariomycetidae species isolated from symptomatic Labrador tea (Rhododendron groenlandicum) leaves and mountain laurel (Kalmia latifolia) collected in coastal southern New Brunswick, Canada. Morphological and phylogenetic evidence demonstrated the unknown species was a novel Synnemapestaloides (Sporocadaceae) species, described here as Syn. ericacearum. A preliminary screening assay indicated that the culture filtrate extract of the new species was potently antifungal towards the biotrophic pathogen Microbotryum violaceum, warranting an investigation of its natural products. Two natural products possessing a rare 1,3-benzodioxin-4-one scaffold, synnemadoxins A-B (1–2), and their postulated precursor, synnemadiacid A (3), were characterized as new structures and assessed for antimicrobial activity. All isolated compounds elicited in vitro inhibitory antifungal activity towards M. violaceum at 2.3 μg mL-1 and moderate antibiotic activity. Further, the characterization of synnemadoxins A-B provided a perspective on the biosynthesis of some related 1,3-benzodioxin-4-ones produced by other fungi within the Xylariales."
https://openalex.org/W2810327026,"The Lower Silurian Longmaxi Shale in Southeast Chongqing of Sichuan Basin in China is considered to be a potential shale gas reservoir by many scholars in recent years. The special shale gas well, namely, Pengye-1 well, was selected as a case study to evaluate the characteristics of the shale gas reservoir. A series of experiments were performed to analyze the geochemical, mineralogical, and petrophysical features and gas content using samples of the Longmaxi Shale from Pengye-1 well. The results show that the organic and inorganic porosities of these samples are range of 0.08–2.73% and 0.06–2.65%, with the average of 1.10% and 1.76%, respectively. The inorganic pores primarily contribute to the porosity until the TOC content is more than 3%. Organic matter plays an important role in adsorbed gas content. The adsorbed gas is dominant in the Longmaxi Shale of Pengye-1 well, which ranges from 0.46 to 2.24 cm3/g, with an average of 1.38 cm3/g. The free gas content ranges from 0.45 to 0.84 cm3/g with an average of 0.68 cm3/g, and is 24.4–49.7 percent of total gas with an average of 37.5%. The bottom part of the Longmaxi Shale is the most favorable for shale gas exploring, which is higher of brittleness mineral content, porosity and gas content. Compare with the other five shales in America, the Lower Silurian Longmaxi Shale is derived from older sedimentary periods with significantly higher thermal maturity and has experienced several periods of intense tectonic, which are unfavorable for the shale gas enrichment."
https://openalex.org/W2810292832,"Estimating population sizes and genetic diversity are key factors to understand and predict population dynamics. Marine species have been a difficult challenge in that respect, due to the difficulty in assessing population sizes and the open nature of such populations. Small, isolated islands with endemic species offer an opportunity to groundtruth population size estimates with empirical data and investigate the genetic consequences of such small populations. Here we focus on two endemic species of reef fish, the Clipperton damselfish, Stegastes baldwini, and the Clipperton angelfish, Holacanthus limbaughi, on Clipperton Atoll, tropical eastern Pacific. Visual surveys, performed over almost two decades and four expeditions, and genetic surveys based on genomic RAD sequences, allowed us to estimate kinship and genetic diversity, as well as to compare population size estimates based on visual surveys with effective population sizes based on genetics. We found that genetic and visual estimates of population numbers were remarkably similar. S. baldwini and H. limbaughi had population sizes of approximately 800,000 and 60,000, respectively. Relatively small population sizes resulted in low genetic diversity and the presence of apparent kinship. This study emphasizes the importance of small isolated islands as models to study population dynamics of marine organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2809833197,"Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer among women, with the basal-like triple negative (TNBC) being the most agressive one, displaying the poorest prognosis within the ductal carcinoma subtype. Due to the lack of adequate molecular targets, the diagnosis and treatment of patients with the TNBC phenotype has been a great challenge. In a previous work, we identified CD90/Thy-1 as being highly expressed in the aggressive high malignancy grade Hs578T basal-like breast tumor cell line, pointing to this molecule as a promising breast tumor marker, which should be further investigated. Here, CD90 expression was analyzed in human breast cancer samples and its functional role was investigated to better assess the oncogenic nature of CD90 in mammary cells. Quantification of CD90 expression in human breast cancer samples, by tissue microarray, showed that high CD90 positivity correlates with metastasis and poor patient survival in the basal-like subtype. The functional genetic approach, by overexpression in the CD90 cDNA in a basal-like normal mammary cell line (MCF10A) and knockdown in a highly malignant cell line (Hs578T), allowed us to demonstrate that CD90 is involved with several cellular processes that lead to malignant transformation, such as: morphological change, increased cell proliferation, invasiveness, metastasis and activation of the EGFR pathway. Therefore, our results reveal that CD90 is involved with malignant transformation in breast cancer cell lines and is correlated with metastasis and poor patient survival in the basal-like subtype, being considered as a promising new breast cancer target."
https://openalex.org/W2810446153,"In many low-resource settings around the world utilization of long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) is low, in part due to access barriers. We sought to explore LARC utilization patterns as well as factors associated with LARC initiation by women seeking contraception in rural Guatemala from a program working to reduce contraception access barriers.We analyzed data from a program that provides family planning in six remote, primarily indigenous, villages in Guatemala with limited access to alternative health services. Methods are free and delivered directly within villages by culturally competent providers. We conducted a retrospective chart review of all 288 women who initiated a contraceptive method over a 16-month period and conducted a logistic regression to obtain adjusted odds ratios (OR) for predictors of LARC uptake.Overall 79.2% of women elected a LARC method. More than half of women (49.8%) switched to LARC from short-acting hormonal methods. In the univariate analysis prior use of short-acting method (p = 0.014), number of prior methods (p = 0.049), and current contraceptive use (p<0.01) were significantly associated with choosing a LARC. In the logistic regression model current use of contraception remained significant (OR 3.29, 95% CI 1.67-8.04). Report of abnormal bleeding or other side effects from prior short-acting method use did not predict LARC uptake (p = 0.82 and p = 0.079).Most women in this marginalized population opted for a LARC method.Low utilization of LARCs may be related to service delivery factors. Further research is needed to validate these conclusions prospectively and in less selected populations."

We assessed the feasibility of using smartphones by village health workers for pregnancy registration and the effectiveness of health text messages (SMS) sent to pregnant women through village health workers in reducing homebirths in rural Uganda. Methods A non-randomised intervention study was undertaken in 26 villages. In the intervention arm, village health workers registered pregnant women (n = 262) in 13 villages using a smartphone app (doForm) and paper forms and gestation age-timed SMS were sent through village health workers to the pregnant women. In 13 control villages, (n = 263) pregnant women were registered on paper forms only and no SMS was sent. The main outcome was place of birth measured through a self-report. Logistic regression with generalised estimating equations was used to explore the effect of the intervention. Results Comparing 795 corresponding data fields on phone and paper revealed that numeric variable fields were 86%-95% similar while text fields were 38%-48% similar. Of the 525 pregnant women followed, 83 (15.8%) delivered at home. In the adjusted analysis, the intervention was associated with lower odds of homebirths [AOR = 0.38, 95%CI (0.15–0.97)]. Muslim religion [AOR = 4.0, 95%CI (1.72–9.34)], primary or no maternal education [AOR = 2.51, 95%CI (1.00–6.35)] and health facility distance ≥ 2 km [AOR = 2.26, 95%CI (0.95–5.40)] were independently associated with homebirths. Conclusion Village health workers can register pregnant women at home using phones and relay gestation age specific SMS to them to effectively reduce homebirths."
https://openalex.org/W2811503685,"The royal python (Python regius) is commonly bred in captivity. To have a successful breeding season, accurate monitoring of the reproductive activity is necessary. The use of non-invasive monitoring methods in exotics is important in order to minimize stress. For this purpose ultrasound has been anecdotally used to monitor royal python reproductive activity. However, there is limited information regarding the reproductive cycle of this species. The aim of the present study is to monitor the female reproductive cycle of the royal python using ultrasonography and gonadal steroid metabolite measurements in the faeces. The reproductive activity of one hundred twenty-nine adult female P. regius was examined during two consecutive years. We performed brief scans on non-anaesthetized snakes using a portable ultrasound system and a 10–12 MHz linear array transducer (MyLab™ 30 Gold, Esaote). Ultrasound features, dimension and echogenicity of the reproductive structures were determined. During the second reproductive cycle, the hormonal profiles of 30 animals were also evaluated, with a monthly collection of faecal samples. These samples were classified according to reproductive stage, as identified by ultrasonographic examination, and the mean faecal progesterone and 17β-estradiol levels were calculated using the results from an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Progesterone levels increased during the reproductive cycle. Estradiol levels showed greater variability, although they appeared to increase before coupling when compared to the levels between coupling and egg laying. The present study suggests that it is possible to identify different phases in the female royal python reproductive cycle: anovulatory phase, transition, folliculogenesis and embryogenesis. Ultrasound is also useful for identifying follicular regression or slugs. Gonadal steroid metabolite measurements from the faeces could help integrate reproductive information. The use of ultrasonography in addition to the steroid metabolite measurement in the faeces gives an accurate picture of ovarian activity in captive adult female royal pythons."

https://openalex.org/W2810043446,"Comprehending natural language quantifiers (like many, all, or some) involves linguistic and numerical abilities. However, the extent to which both factors play a role is controversial. In order to determine the specific contributions of linguistic and number skills in quantifier comprehension, we examined two groups of participants that differ in their language abilities while their number skills appear to be similar: Participants with Down syndrome (DS) and participants with Williams syndrome (WS). Compared to rather poor linguistic skills of individuals with DS, individuals with WS display relatively advanced language abilities. Participants with WS also outperformed participants with DS in a quantifier comprehension task while number knowledge did not differ between the two groups. When compared to typically developing (TD) children of the same mental age, participants with WS displayed similar levels regarding quantifier abilities, but participants with DS performed worse than the control group. Language abilities but not number skills also significantly predicted quantifier knowledge in a linear regression analysis, stressing the importance of linguistic abilities for quantifier comprehension. In addition to determining the skills that are relevant for comprehending quantifiers, our findings provide the first demonstration of how quantifiers are acquired by individuals with DS and WS, an issue not investigated so far."

We seek to quantify the frequency of images used in online news coverage of vaccines that may convey varying sentiments about vaccination. To capture a breadth of vaccine-related news coverage, including international sources, we searched the following terms in Google News Archives: ""autism and vaccine"", ""flu and vaccine"", and ""measles and Disneyland"". We developed a coding tool that classified images as negative (eg, screaming child), positive (eg, happy child), neutral (eg, vaccine vial), or irrelevant (eg, picture of journalist). All images were coded independently by two researchers and discussed for consensus. We analyzed 734 images. Of the images which featured vaccines and/or a medical encounter (322), 28% had negative features and 30% had positive features. The remaining 137 images (43%) were neutral. There was no statistically significant difference between proportions of negative and positive imagery for each pair of search terms, which may be a reflection of random image selection. Ultimately, nearly one in eight images included in vaccine-related news coverage contains negative features which may be selected without careful consideration of the potential negative impact on public health initiatives regarding vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W2809901711,"Theobroma cacao is cultivated in the shade, in a so-called 'Cabruca' system, in intercropped with Erithryna or other tree species of economic value, and in full sun as a monoculture in irrigated or chemically-irrigated systems. Since it is a species quite intolerant to wind, it is practically impossible to implant cacao crops under full exposure to the sun, or in areas of frequent winds, without the protection of windbreaks, using arboreal species around the area of culture in the form of box. Wind can cause mechanical stimuli in plants, affecting their growth and development. The objective of this work was to evaluate the photosynthetic changes in mature leaves and the molecular, biochemical and ultrastructural changes in young and mature leaves of the CCN 51 cloned genotype of T. cacao subjected to intermittent (IW) and constant (CW) wind, with velocities of 2.5, 3.5 and 4.5 m s-1, during 3, 6 and 12 h of exposure. It was verified that CW and IW, considering different exposure times, interfered directly in stomatal conductance (gs), transpiration (E) and water use efficiency (WUE), causing a reduction of the photosynthetic rate (A) in mature leaves. In addition, the pulvinus and blade of young and mature leaves, exposed to IW and CW with different exposure times (3 and 12 h), showed marked macroscopic and microscopic mechanical injuries resulting from the constant leaf movement. At both speeds, there was rupture of the cell nuclear membrane in pulvinus and the mesophyll tissues, mainly in the young leaves. On the other hand, in young and mature leaves exposed to CW and IW at different speeds and exposure times, there was lipid peroxidation, increased activity of guaiacol (GPX) and ascorbate (APX) peroxidases in most treatments; and altered expression of transcripts of psba and psbo genes related to the phothosynthetic apparatus and Cu-Zn-sod and per genes related to antioxidative enzymes at the rate of 4.5 m s-1. Younger leaves were more intolerant to mechanical stress caused by the wind, since presented greater macro and microscopic damages and, consequently, greater molecular, biochemical and ultrastructural changes. High wind speeds can seriously compromise the development of young leaves of T. cacao plants and affect their productivity."
https://openalex.org/W2810581926,"Background Healthcare systems in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are fraught with numerous governance and infrastructural issues including lack of access to quality care and health worker shortage. Policy makers are becoming increasingly interested in adopting novel technologies such as web-based interventions within the scope of e-Health to bridge the gaps in care delivery in a cost-effective and sustainable manner. Successful implementation of these policies is reliant on evidences regarding people’s access to these technologies, which are scarce for countries in SSA. Objectives To 1) investigate the variation in the prevalence of accessing computer and internet across regional and socioeconomic groups, and 2) assess association between ever accessing computer and internet and knowledge of routes and risk factors of HIV transmission in selected SSA countries. Methods We analyzed cross-sectional datasets from UNICEF Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys. Participants were16,194 men and 39,121 women from Ghana, Guinea Bissau, Malawi and Zimbabwe. Main outcome variable was ever-accessing computer and Internet for any purpose. Associations were assessed by multivariable regression methods. Results Lifetime computer usage in Ghana, Guinea Bissau, Malawi and Zimbabwe was respectively 21.5%, 13.4%, 12.3%, 28.4% among men, and 12.5%, 8.3%, 4.8%, 20.5% among women, and that of internet was 14.9%, 11.7%, 10.8%, 34% among men, and 6.4%, 6.9%, 4.2%, 21.6% among women in the aforementioned order. Participants who reported ever using computer and Internet were more likely to have higher knowledge regarding the transmission of HIV compared to those who did not. Conclusions Prevalence of lifetime access to computer and Internet was considerably low in all four countries. Several socioeconomic factors appeared to be associated with the access to computer and Internet, addressing which might prove beneficial for the successful expansion e-Health in these countries."
https://openalex.org/W2809706826,"Brucellosis is a zoonotic disease of public health importance; its prevalence varies globally. In low-income countries, brucellosis is an endemic and neglected disease affecting both animals and humans. This study was intended to establish brucellosis sero-prevalence among patients attending Wau hospital, South Sudan. Across sectional study, was done among randomly selected patients attending Wau hospital. Data was collected using questionnaires and laboratory investigations. Rose Bengal plate Test (RBPT), Serum agglutination test (SAT) and Competitive Enzyme Linked Immuno Sorbent Assay (c-ELISA) was used in the analysis of blood samples serially starting with RBPT which is more sensitive and least specific then SAT. c-ELISA test which is most specific and less sensitive compared to RBPT and SAT was then used to confirm presence of Brucella antibodies in the samples. A total of 416 participants out of 1664 were enrolled to this study. The majority of participants were between 7-to-76 years of age with mean age of 30.72 (SD+/- 12.83). The sero-positivity of patient’s blood samples for brucellosis using c-ELISA was 23.3% (97/416) among patients presenting to Wau hospital. Socio-demographic characteristics, occupation, clinical signs of disease and types of animals reared by animal owners showed no significant correlation with occurrence of sero-positivity among patient’s blood samples for brucellosis. While ethnicity (Nilotic), knowledge of zoonotic disease, and consumption of animal urine were statistically significant (p<0.05). The study found a high prevalence of brucellosis among febrile patients attending Wau hospital general outpatient clinic. There is need for co-ordination and collaboration between veterinary and health sectors of government to help prevent and control brucellosis in the region."
https://openalex.org/W2809981230,"Allogeneic lung transplant is limited both by the shortage of available donor lungs and by the lack of suitable long-term lung assist devices to bridge patients to lung transplantation. Avian lungs have different structure and mechanics resulting in more efficient gas exchange than mammalian lungs. Decellularized avian lungs, recellularized with human lung cells, could therefore provide a powerful novel gas exchange unit for potential use in pulmonary therapeutics. To initially assess this in both small and large avian lung models, chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) and emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae) lungs were decellularized using modifications of a detergent-based protocol, previously utilized with mammalian lungs. Light and electron microscopy, vascular and airway resistance, quantitation and gel analyses of residual DNA, and immunohistochemical and mass spectrometric analyses of remaining extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins demonstrated maintenance of lung structure, minimal residual DNA, and retention of major ECM proteins in the decellularized scaffolds. Seeding with human bronchial epithelial cells, human pulmonary vascular endothelial cells, human mesenchymal stromal cells, and human lung fibroblasts demonstrated initial cell attachment on decellularized avian lungs and growth over a 7-day period. These initial studies demonstrate that decellularized avian lungs may be a feasible approach for generating functional lung tissue for clinical therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2810383866,"Many broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) bind to conserved areas of the hemagglutinin (HA) stalk region and can inhibit the low pH induced HA conformational changes necessary for viral membrane fusion activity. We developed and evaluated a high-throughput virus-free and cell-free ELISA based low pH induced HA Conformational Change Inhibition Antibody Detection Assay (HCCIA) and a complementary proteinase susceptibility assay. Human serum samples (n = 150) were tested by HCCIA using H3 recombinant HA. Optical density (OD) ratios of mAb HC31 at pH 4.8 to pH 7.0 ranged from 0.87 to 0.09. Our results demonstrated that low pH induced HA conformational change inhibition antibodies (CCI) neutralized multiple H3 strains after removal of head-binding antibodies. The results suggest that HCCIA can be utilized to detect and characterize CCI in sera, that are potentially broadly neutralizing, and serves as a useful tool for evaluating universal vaccine candidates targeting the HA stalk."

Trauma scores such as the international classification of diseases injury severity score (ICISS) have been used with great success in trauma research and in quality programmes to improve trauma care. To this date no valid trauma score has been developed for the Indian population.This retrospective cohort study used a dataset of 16047 trauma-patients from four public university hospitals in urban India, which was divided into derivation and validation subsets. All injuries in the dataset were assigned an international classification of disease (ICD) code. Survival Risk Ratios (SRRs), for mortality within 24 hours and 30 days were then calculated for each ICD-code and used to calculate the corresponding ICISS. Score performance was measured using discrimination by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROCC) and calibration by calculating the calibration slope and intercept to plot a calibration curve.Predictions of 30-day mortality showed an AUROCC of 0.618, calibration slope of 0.269 and calibration intercept of 0.071. Estimates of 24-hour mortality consistently showed low AUROCCs and negative calibration slopes.We attempted to derive and validate a version of the ICISS using SRRs calculated from an Indian population. However, the developed ICISS-scores overestimate mortality and implementing these scores in clinical or policy contexts is not recommended. This study, as well as previous reports, suggest that other scoring systems might be better suited for India and other Low- and middle-income countries until more data are available."
https://openalex.org/W2810102637,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to be key modulators of post-transcriptional gene silencing in many cellular processes. In previous studies designed to understand the role of miRNAs in thymic development, we globally deleted miRNA exclusively in thymic epithelial cells (TECs), which are critical in thymic selection. This resulted in the loss of stromal cells that instruct T cell lineage commitment and affect thymocyte positive selection, required for mature T cell development. Since murine miR-181 is expressed in the thymus and miR-181 deficiency disrupts thymocyte development, we first quantified and thereby demonstrated that miR181a1 and miR181b1 are expressed in purified TECs. By generating mice with TEC targeted loss of miR-181a1 and miR-181b1 expression, we observed that neither TEC cellularity nor thymocyte number nor differentiation was adversely affected. Thus, disrupted thymopoiesis in miR-181 deficient mice was not due to miR-181 loss of expression in TECs. Importantly, in mice with restricted TEC deficiency of miR-181a1 and miR-181b1, there were similar numbers of mature T cells in the periphery in regards to frequencies, differentiation, and function as compared to controls. Moreover miR-181a1 and miR-181b1 were not required for maintenance of thymus integrity over time, as thymic involution was not accelerated in gene-targeted mice. Taken together our data indicate that miR-181a1 and miR-181b1 are dispensable for TEC differentiation, their control of thymocyte development and mature T cell export to and homeostasis within the periphery."
https://openalex.org/W2810796886,"Most of real-world image distortions are multiply distortion rather than single distortion. To address this issue, in this paper we propose a quaternion wavelet transform (QWT) based full reference image quality assessment (FR IQA) metric for multiply distorted images, which jointly considers the local similarity of phase and magnitude of each subband via QWT. Firstly, the reference images and distorted images are decomposed by QWT, and then the similarity of amplitude and phase are calculated on each subband, thirdly the IQA metric is constructed by the weighting method considering human visual system (HVS) characteristics, and lastly the scores of each subband are averaged to get the quality score of test image. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the state of art in multiply distorted IQA."
https://openalex.org/W2811003076,"Health care providers usually focus on index HIV-infected patients and seldom obtain information from their partners. We aimed to determine HIV-preventative measures among couples, the prevalence of HIV infection, and treatment outcomes of partners.This cross-sectional study was conducted in two hospital settings, a university hospital in Bangkok and a general hospital in northeastern Thailand, from January 2011-October 2015. Factors associated with serodiscordant relationships were determined by logistic regression.A total of 393 couples were enrolled for analysis; 156 (39.7%) were serodiscordant. The median relationship duration of serodiscordant couples was shorter than that of seroconcordant couples (6.4 years vs 11.6 years, p < 0.001). Of 237 HIV-infected partners, 17.7% had AIDS-defining illness, the median nadir CD4 count (interquartile range) was 240 (96-427) cells/mm3, 83.5% received antiretroviral therapy (ART), 98.3% had adherence > 95%, 90.3% had undetectable HIV RNA, and 22.9% had a prior history of treatment failure. There was no significant difference in condom usage in the prior 30 days between serodiscordant and seroconcordant couples. Factors of index HIV-infected patients associated with serodiscordant relationships were younger age (odds ratio [OR] 1.04 per 5 years; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-1.06), receiving care at the general hospital (OR 1.73; 95% CI 1.08-2.78), a shorter duration of relationship (OR 1.04 per year; 95% CI 1.01-1.07), a higher nadir CD4 count (OR 1.06 per 50 cells/mm3; 95% CI 1.1-1.13), and not receiving a protease inhibitor-based regimen (OR 2.04; 95% CI 1.06-3.96).A high number of serodiscordant couples was determined. Partners' information should be retrieved as a holistic approach. Interventions for minimizing HIV transmission within serodiscordant couples should be evaluated and implemented."
https://openalex.org/W2811136424,"Persistent pulmonary hypertension (PPHN) remains a severe complication of the transition to extra-uterine life with significant morbidity and mortality in the newborns. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) represents a new pharmacological agent with vascular effects, including improvement of PPHN in several animal models. We hypothesized that DHEA could decrease pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) in the pulmonary circulation of fetal sheep. We studied the effect of intravenous infusion of DHEA in fetal lambs using chronically instrumented sheep at 128 days of gestation. PVR was computed before and after intravenous infusion of increasing doses of DHEA. We assessed pre-treatment by L-nitroarginine, an inhibitor of NO production. Blood gases and doses of DHEA were measured in both sheep and fetus before/after DHEA infusion. Intravenous infusion of DHEA had a vasodilator effect with a significant decrease in PVR (respectively -11%, -14% and -36% after infusion of 6, 12 and 24 mg DHEA, p<0.01) without damaging effects on systemic circulation or on blood gases. The inhibitory effect of pre-treatment with L-nitroarginine resulted in a significant increase in PVR. We demonstrated a potent vasodilator effect of DHEA on fetal pulmonary circulation without deleterious effects. DHEA might represent a new treatment for PPHN."
