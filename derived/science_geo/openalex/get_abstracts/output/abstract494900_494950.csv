https://openalex.org/W1998734250,"In anatomic pathology, immunohistochemistry (IHC) serves as a diagnostic and prognostic method for identification of disease markers in tissue samples that directly influences classification and grading the disease, influencing patient management. However, till today over most of the world, pathological analysis of tissue samples remained a time-consuming and subjective procedure, wherein the intensity of antibody staining is manually judged and thus scoring decision is directly influenced by visual bias. This instigated us to design a simple method of automated digital IHC image analysis algorithm for an unbiased, quantitative assessment of antibody staining intensity in tissue sections. As a first step, we adopted the spectral deconvolution method of DAB/hematoxylin color spectra by using optimized optical density vectors of the color deconvolution plugin for proper separation of the DAB color spectra. Then the DAB stained image is displayed in a new window wherein it undergoes pixel-by-pixel analysis, and displays the full profile along with its scoring decision. Based on the mathematical formula conceptualized, the algorithm is thoroughly tested by analyzing scores assigned to thousands (n = 1703) of DAB stained IHC images including sample images taken from human protein atlas web resource. The IHC Profiler plugin developed is compatible with the open resource digital image analysis software, ImageJ, which creates a pixel-by-pixel analysis profile of a digital IHC image and further assigns a score in a four tier system. A comparison study between manual pathological analysis and IHC Profiler resolved in a match of 88.6% (P<0.0001, CI = 95%). This new tool developed for clinical histopathological sample analysis can be adopted globally for scoring most protein targets where the marker protein expression is of cytoplasmic and/or nuclear type. We foresee that this method will minimize the problem of inter-observer variations across labs and further help in worldwide patient stratification potentially benefitting various multinational clinical trial initiatives."

Previous approaches for evaluating fall risk are based on self-report or testing at a given time point and may, therefore, be insufficient to optimally capture fall risk. We tested, for the first time, whether metrics derived from 3 day continuous recordings are associated with fall risk in PD.107 patients (Hoehn & Yahr Stage: 2.6±0.7) wore a small, body-fixed sensor (3D accelerometer) on lower back for 3 days. Walking quantity (e.g., steps per 3-days) and quality (e.g., frequency-derived measures of gait variability) were determined. Subjects were classified as fallers or non-fallers based on fall history. Subjects were also followed for one year to evaluate predictors of the transition from non-faller to faller.The 3 day acceleration derived measures were significantly different in fallers and non-fallers and were significantly correlated with previously validated measures of fall risk. Walking quantity was similar in the two groups. In contrast, the fallers walked with higher step-to-step variability, e.g., anterior-posterior width of the dominant frequency was larger (p = 0.012) in the fallers (0.78 ± 0.17 Hz) compared to the non-fallers (0.71 ± 0.07 Hz). Among subjects who reported no falls in the year prior to testing, sensor-derived measures predicted the time to first fall (p = 0.0034), whereas many traditional measures did not. Cox regression analysis showed that anterior-posterior width was significantly (p = 0.0039) associated with time to fall during the follow-up period, even after adjusting for traditional measures.These findings indicate that a body-fixed sensor worn continuously can evaluate fall risk in PD. This sensor-based approach was able to identify transition from non-faller to faller, whereas many traditional metrics were not successful. This approach may facilitate earlier detection of fall risk and may in the future, help reduce high costs associated with falls."
https://openalex.org/W2081398226,"Gold nanoparticles (GNPs) are claimed as outstanding biomedical tools for cancer diagnostics and photo-thermal therapy, but without enough evidence on their potentially adverse immunological effects. Using a model of human dendritic cells (DCs), we showed that 10 nm- and 50 nm-sized GNPs (GNP10 and GNP50, respectively) were internalized predominantly via dynamin-dependent mechanisms, and they both impaired LPS-induced maturation and allostimulatory capacity of DCs, although the effect of GNP10 was more prominent. However, GNP10 inhibited LPS-induced production of IL-12p70 by DCs, and potentiated their Th2 polarization capacity, while GNP50 promoted Th17 polarization. Such effects of GNP10 correlated with a stronger inhibition of LPS-induced changes in Ca2+ oscillations, their higher number per DC, and more frequent extra-endosomal localization, as judged by live-cell imaging, proton, and electron microscopy, respectively. Even when released from heat-killed necrotic HEp-2 cells, GNP10 inhibited the necrotic tumor cell-induced maturation and functions of DCs, potentiated their Th2/Th17 polarization capacity, and thus, impaired the DCs' capacity to induce T cell-mediated anti-tumor cytotoxicity in vitro. Therefore, GNP10 could potentially induce more adverse DC-mediated immunological effects, compared to GNP50."
https://openalex.org/W2128667243,"While associations between number and space, in the form of a spatially oriented numerical representation, have been extensively reported in human adults, the origins of this phenomenon are still poorly understood. The commonly accepted view is that this number-space association is a product of human invention, with accounts proposing that culture, symbolic knowledge, and mathematics education are at the roots of this phenomenon. Here we show that preverbal infants aged 7 months, who lack symbolic knowledge and mathematics education, show a preference for increasing magnitude displayed in a left-to-right spatial orientation. Infants habituated to left-to-right oriented increasing or decreasing numerical sequences showed an overall higher looking time to new left-to-right oriented increasing numerical sequences at test (Experiment 1). This pattern did not hold when infants were presented with the same ordinal numerical information displayed from right to left (Experiment 2). The different pattern of results was congruent with the presence of a malleable, context-dependent baseline preference for increasing, left-to-right oriented, numerosities (Experiment 3). These findings are suggestive of an early predisposition in humans to link numerical order with a left-to-right spatial orientation, which precedes the acquisition of symbolic abilities, mathematics education, and the acquisition of reading and writing skills."
https://openalex.org/W2035411558,"Background We conducted quantitative and qualitative studies to explore barriers and motivating factors to VMMC for HIV prevention, and to assess utilization of existing VMMC communication channels. Methods and Findings A population-based survey was conducted with 2350 respondents aged 15–49. Analysis consisted of descriptive statistics and bivariate analysis between circumcision and selected demographics. Logistic regression was used to determine predictors of male circumcision uptake compared to intention to circumcise. Focus group discussions (FGDs) were held with men purposively selected to represent a range of ethnicities. 68% and 53% of female/male respondents, respectively, had heard about VMMC for HIV prevention, mostly through the radio (71%). Among male respondents, 11.3% reported being circumcised and 49% reported willingness to undergo VMMC. Factors which men reported motivated them to undergo VMMC included HIV/STI prevention (44%), improved hygiene (26%), enhanced sexual performance (6%) and cervical cancer prevention for partner (6%). Factors that deterred men from undergoing VMMC included fear of pain (40%), not believing that they were at risk of HIV (18%), lack of partner support (6%). Additionally, there were differences in motivators and barriers by age. FGDs suggested additional barriers including fear of HIV testing, partner refusal, reluctance to abstain from sex and myths and misconceptions. Conclusions VMMC demand-creation messages need to be specifically tailored for different ages and should emphasize non-HIV prevention benefits, such as improved hygiene and sexual appeal, and need to address men's fear of pain. Promoting VMMC among women is crucial as they appear to have considerable influence over men's decision to get circumcised."
https://openalex.org/W1967938147,"Chronic inflammatory events appear to play a fundamental role in Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related neuropathological changes, and to result in neuronal dysfunction and death. The inflammatory responses observed in the AD brain include activation and proliferation of glial cells, together with up-regulation of inflammatory mediators and of free radicals. Along with glial cells, neurons themselves can also react and contribute to neuroinflammatory changes in the AD brain, by serving as sources of inflammatory mediators. Because excess cholesterol cannot be degraded in the brain, it must be excreted from that organ as cholesterol oxidation products (oxysterols), in order to prevent its accumulation. Among risk factors for this neurodegenerative disease, a mechanistic link between altered cholesterol metabolism and AD has been suggested; oxysterols appear to be the missing linkers between the two, because of their neurotoxic effects. This study shows that 24-hydroxycholesterol, 27-hydroxycholesterol, and 7β-hydroxycholesterol, the three oxysterols potentially implicated in AD pathogenesis, induce some pro-inflammatory mediator expression in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells, via Toll-like receptor-4/cyclooxygenase-2/membrane bound prostaglandin E synthase (TLR4/COX-2/mPGES-1); this clearly indicates that oxysterols may promote neuroinflammatory changes in AD. To confirm this evidence, cells were incubated with the anti-inflammatory flavonoid quercetin; remarkably, its anti-inflammatory effects in SH-SY5Y cells were enhanced when it was loaded into β-cyclodextrin-dodecylcarbonate nanoparticles, versus cells pretreated with free quercetin. The goal of loading quercetin into nanoparticles was to improve its permeation across the blood-brain barrier into the brain, and its bioavailability to reach target cells. The findings show that this drug delivery system might be a new therapeutic strategy for preventing or reducing AD progression."
https://openalex.org/W2051479586,"Differentiation of lung fibroblasts into contractile protein-expressing myofibroblasts by transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) is a critical event in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis. Transcription of the contractile protein α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) is mediated by the transcription factor serum-response factor (SRF) along with its co-activator, myocardin-related transcription factor-A (MRTF-A). The endogenous lipid mediator prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) exerts anti-fibrotic effects, including the inhibition of myofibroblast differentiation. However, the mechanism by which PGE2 inhibits α-SMA expression is incompletely understood. Here, we show in normal lung fibroblasts that PGE2 reduced the nuclear accumulation of MRTF-A·SRF complexes and consequently inhibited α-SMA promoter activation. It did so both by independently inhibiting SRF gene expression and nuclear import of MRTF-A. We identified that p38 MAPK is critical for TGF-β1-induced SRF gene expression and that PGE2 inhibition of SRF expression is associated with its ability to inhibit p38 activation. Its inhibition of MRTF-A import occurs via activation of cofilin 1 and inactivation of vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein. Similar effects of PGE2 on SRF gene expression were observed in fibroblasts from the lungs of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Thus, PGE2 is the first substance described to prevent myofibroblast differentiation by disrupting, via distinct mechanisms, the actions of both SRF and MRTF-A."
https://openalex.org/W2005776052,"The objective of our study was to investigate tumor conspicuity and the discrimination potential for tumor aggressiveness on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) with high b value at 3-T.The institutional review board approved this study and waived the requirement for informed consent. A total of 50 patients with prostate cancer (69 cancer foci; 48 in the PZ, 20 in the TZ, and one in whole prostate) who underwent multiparametric prostate MRI including DW-MRI (b values: 0, 1000 s/mm2 and 0, 2000 s/mm2) on a 3-T system were included. Lesion conspicuity score (LCS) using visual assessment (1 = invisible for surrounding normal site; 2 = slightly high intensity; 3 = moderately high; and 4 = very high) and tumor-normal signal intensity ratio (TNR) were assessed, and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC, ×10-3 mm2/s) of the tumor regions and normal regions were measured.Mean LCS and TNR at 0, 2000 s/mm2 was significantly higher than those at 0, 1000 s/mm2 (p<0.001 for both). In addition, ADC at both 0, 1000 and 0, 2000 s/mm2 was found to distinguish intermediate or high risk cancer with Gleason score ≥7 from low risk cancer with Gleason score ≤6 (p<0.001 for both). Furthermore, ADC of tumor regions correlated with Gleason score at both 0, 1000 s/mm2 (ρ = -0.602; p<0.001) and 0, 2000 s/mm2 (ρ = -0.645; p<0.001).For tumor conspicuity and characterization of prostate cancer on DW-MRI of 3-T MRI, b = 0, 2000 s/mm2 is more useful than b = 0, 1000 s/mm2."
https://openalex.org/W1980031158,"Tropomyosin-related receptor kinase B (TrkB) signaling, stimulated by brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) ligand, promotes tumor progression, and is related to the poor prognosis of various malignancies. We sought to examine the clinical relevance of BDNF/TrkB expression in colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues, its prognostic value for CRC patients, and its therapeutic potential in vitro and in vivo. Two hundred and twenty-three CRC patient specimens were used to determine both BDNF and TrkB mRNA levels. The expression of these proteins in their primary and metastatic tumors was investigated by immunohistochemistry. CRC cell lines and recombinant BDNF and K252a (a selective pharmacological pan-Trk inhibitor) were used for in vitro cell viability, migration, invasion, anoikis resistance and in vivo peritoneal metastasis assays. Tissue BDNF mRNA was associated with liver and peritoneal metastasis. Tissue TrkB mRNA was also associated with lymph node metastasis. The co-expression of BDNF and TrkB was associated with liver and peritoneal metastasis. Patients with higher BDNF, TrkB, and co-expression of BDNF and TrkB had a significantly poor prognosis. BDNF increased tumor cell viability, migration, invasion and inhibited anoikis in the TrkB-expressing CRC cell lines. These effects were suppressed by K252a. In mice injected with DLD1 co-expressing BDNF and TrkB, and subsequently treated with K252a, peritoneal metastatic nodules was found to be reduced, as compared with control mice. BDNF/TrkB signaling may thus be a potential target for treating peritoneal carcinomatosis arising from colorectal cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2010920218,"The adhesive phenotype of Candida albicans contributes to its ability to colonize the host and cause disease. Als proteins are one of the most widely studied C. albicans virulence attributes; deletion of ALS3 produces the greatest reduction in adhesive function. Although adhesive activity is thought to reside within the N-terminal domain of Als proteins (NT-Als), the molecular mechanism of adhesion remains unclear. We designed mutations in NT-Als3 that test the contribution of the peptide-binding cavity (PBC) to C. albicans adhesion and assessed the adhesive properties of other NT-Als3 features in the absence of a functional PBC. Structural analysis of purified loss-of-PBC-function mutant proteins showed that the mutations did not alter the overall structure or surface properties of NT-Als3. The mutations were incorporated into full-length ALS3 and integrated into the ALS3 locus of a deletion mutant, under control of the native ALS3 promoter. The PBC mutant phenotype was evaluated in assays using monolayers of human pharyngeal epithelial and umbilical vein endothelial cells, and freshly collected human buccal epithelial cells in suspension. Loss of PBC function resulted in an adhesion phenotype that was indistinguishable from the Δals3/Δals3 strain. The adhesive contribution of the Als3 amyloid-forming-region (AFR) was also tested using these methods. C. albicans strains producing cell surface Als3 in which the amyloidogenic potential was destroyed showed little contribution of the AFR to adhesion, instead suggesting an aggregative function for the AFR.

X-ray crystallographic analysis of NT-Als9-2 (encoded by an ALS9 allele) showed that it is characterized by two immunoglobulin-like domains and possesses a peptide-binding cavity (PBC) that can bury up to 6 residues from flexible C termini of polypeptides (14Salgado P.S.

An invariant Lys (Lys-59) at the end of the PBC recognizes the carboxyl group at the C terminus of a peptide ligand, allowing the remaining peptide backbone to associate in parallel orientation with β-strand G2. In the structure of different NT-Als·ligand complexes, several water molecules anchor polypeptides with different C-terminal sequences in the PBC.

We used biophysical techniques to solve the NT-Als3 structure and assessed the structural impact of the site-directed mutations. Finally, we produced the mutant Als3 proteins on the C. albicans surface, under control of the native ALS3 promoter, and tested the strains for their adhesive phenotype in assays using cultured or freshly collected human cells. The complementary information provided from the study of purified proteins using biophysical techniques and phenotypic analysis of mutant proteins displayed in native conditions on the C. albicans surface demonstrates the essential contribution of the PBC to Als3 adhesive function. DNA encoding the N-terminal domain of Als3 (NT-Als3, amino acids 1–315 of the mature protein, KTIT—IVIVA, GenBank Accession No. AY223552), was subcloned in plasmid pET32-Xa-LIC by ligation-independent cloning (Novagen). From this construct, a shorter version of NT-Als3 that excludes the C-terminal AFR (sNT-Als3), was generated by replacing the codon corresponding to Asn-303 with a stop codon. Other mutations that probe the function of the PBC and the AFR in these constructs are summarized in Fig. 1. Mutagenesis was performed with the QuikChange II Kit (Agilent Technologies). Oligonucleotides were designed according to the manufacturer's instructions.

A, the NMR spectrum of purified NT-Als3 showed considerably reduced solubility. Two potential mechanisms explain this effect: oligomerization caused by insertion of the free C terminus (CT) of the protein as a ligand into the binding pocket of an adjacent NT-Als3 molecule (“self-complementation,” left) (14Salgado P.S.

Note that self-complementation is suppressed in full-length Als proteins on the C. albicans surface, where the C terminus is linked to the cell wall via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor remnant (10Hoyer L.L.

Mycol. 2008; 46: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). B, deletion of the AFR resulted in sNT-Als3, a construct free of oligomerization and aggregation effects. C, mutations in the PBC (K59M, A116V, and Y301F to generate NT-Als3-pbc) improved protein solubility compared with A, presumably due to elimination of self-complementation and decreased aggregation because the AFR was associated with the rest of the NT-Als3 folded structure (Fig. 3). D, solubility of the protein in C was further improved by removing residual AFR activity via mutations I311S/I313S (NT-Als3-pbc-afr). These results demonstrate at the molecular level the role of the PBC and the AFR in aggregation among purified NT-Als proteins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 1Als3 constructs and mutants for structural analysis.

Cyst nematodes are obligate sedentary endoparasites that reproduce by amphimixis. Here, we report the first transcriptome analysis of two stages of H. avenae. After sequencing extracted RNA from pre parasitic infective juvenile and adult stages of the life cycle, 131 million Illumina high quality paired end reads were obtained which generated 27,765 contigs with N50 of 1,028 base pairs, of which 10,452 were annotated. Comparative analyses were undertaken to evaluate H. avenae sequences with those of other plant, animal and free living nematodes to identify differences in expressed genes. There were 4,431 transcripts common to H. avenae and the free living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, and 9,462 in common with more closely related potato cyst nematode, Globodera pallida. Annotation of H. avenae carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZy) revealed fewer glycoside hydrolases (GHs) but more glycosyl transferases (GTs) and carbohydrate esterases (CEs) when compared to M. incognita. 1,280 transcripts were found to have secretory signature, presence of signal peptide and absence of transmembrane. In a comparison of genes expressed in the pre-parasitic juvenile and feeding female stages, expression levels of 30 genes with high RPKM (reads per base per kilo million) value, were analysed by qRT-PCR which confirmed the observed differences in their levels of expression levels. In addition, we have also developed a user-friendly resource, Heterodera transcriptome database (HATdb) for public access of the data generated in this study. The new data provided on the transcriptome of H. avenae adds to the genetic resources available to study plant parasitic nematodes and provides an opportunity to seek new effectors that are specifically involved in the H. avenae-cereal host interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2013810799,"Hypoxia and inflammation are strictly interconnected both concurring to prostate cancer progression. Numerous reports highlight the role of tumor cells in the synthesis of pro-inflammatory molecules and show that hypoxia can modulate a number of these genes contributing substantially to the increase of cancer aggressiveness. However, little is known about the importance of the tumor phenotype in this process. The present study explores how different features, including differentiation and aggressiveness, of prostate tumor cell lines impact on the hypoxic remodeling of pro-inflammatory gene expression and malignancy. We performed our studies on three cell lines with increasing metastatic potential: the well differentiated androgen-dependent LNCaP and the less differentiated and androgen-independent DU145 and PC3. We analyzed the effect that hypoxic treatment has on modulating pro-inflammatory gene expression and evaluated the role HIF isoforms and NF-kB play in sustaining this process. DU145 and PC3 cells evidenced a higher normoxic expression and a more complete hypoxic induction of pro-inflammatory molecules compared to the well differentiated LNCaP cell line. The role of HIF1α and NF-kB, the master regulators of hypoxia and inflammation respectively, in sustaining the hypoxic pro-inflammatory phenotype was different according to cell type. NF-kB was observed to play a main role in DU145 and PC3 cells in which treatment with the NF-kB inhibitor parthenolide was able to counteract both the hypoxic pro-inflammatory shift and HIF1α activation but not in LNCaP cells. Our data highlight that tumor prostate cell phenotype contributes at a different degree and with different mechanisms to the hypoxic pro-inflammatory gene expression related to tumor progression."
https://openalex.org/W1980680281,"Global ischemia caused by heart attack, pulmonary failure, near-drowning or traumatic brain injury often damages the higher brain but not the brainstem, leading to a ‘persistent vegetative state’ where the patient is awake but not aware. Approximately 30,000 U.S. patients are held captive in this condition but not a single research study has addressed how the lower brain is preferentially protected in these people. In the higher brain, ischemia elicits a profound anoxic depolarization (AD) causing neuronal dysfunction and vasoconstriction within minutes. Might brainstem nuclei generate less damaging AD and so be more resilient? Here we compared resistance to acute injury induced from simulated ischemia by ‘higher’ hippocampal and striatal neurons versus brainstem neurons in live slices from rat and mouse. Light transmittance (LT) imaging in response to 10 minutes of oxygen/glucose deprivation (OGD) revealed immediate and acutely damaging AD propagating through gray matter of neocortex, hippocampus, striatum, thalamus and cerebellar cortex. In adjacent brainstem nuclei, OGD-evoked AD caused little tissue injury. Whole-cell patch recordings from hippocampal and striatal neurons under OGD revealed sudden membrane potential loss that did not recover. In contrast brainstem neurons from locus ceruleus and mesencephalic nucleus as well as from sensory and motor nuclei only slowly depolarized and then repolarized post-OGD. Two-photon microscopy confirmed non-recoverable swelling and dendritic beading of hippocampal neurons during OGD, while mesencephalic neurons in midbrain appeared uninjured. All of the above responses were mimicked by bath exposure to 100 µM ouabain which inhibits the Na+/K+ pump or to 1–10 nM palytoxin which converts the pump into an open cationic channel. Therefore during ischemia the Na+/K+ pump of higher neurons fails quickly and extensively compared to naturally resilient hypothalamic and brainstem neurons. The selective survival of lower brain regions that maintain vital functions will support the persistent vegetative state."
https://openalex.org/W2068032079,"Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) has a worldwide distribution and the widest host range of any known plant virus. From 2000 to 2012, epidemics of CMV severely affected the production of snap bean (Phaseulos vulgaris L.) in the Midwest and Northeastern United States. Virus diversity leading to emergence of new strains is often considered a significant factor in virus epidemics. In addition to epidemics, new disease phenotypes arising from genetic exchanges or mutation can compromise effectiveness of plant disease management strategies. Here, we captured a snapshot of genetic variation of 32 CMV isolates collected from different regions of the U.S including new field as well as historic isolates. Nucleotide diversity (π) was low for U.S. CMV isolates. Sequence and phylogenetic analyses revealed that CMV subgroup I is predominant in the US and further showed that the CMV population is a mixture of subgroups IA and IB. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis suggests likely reassortment between subgroups IA and IB within five CMV isolates. Based on phylogenetic and computational analysis, recombination between subgroups I and II as well as IA and IB in RNA 3 was detected. This is the first report of recombination between CMV subgroups I and II. Neutrality tests illustrated that negative selection was the major force operating upon the CMV genome, although some positively selected sites were detected for all encoded proteins. Together, these data suggest that different regions of the CMV genome are under different evolutionary constraints. These results also delineate composition of the CMV population in the US, and further suggest that recombination and reassortment among strain subgroups does occur but at a low frequency, and point towards CMV genomic regions that differ in types of selection pressure."
https://openalex.org/W2070649761,"A better process understanding of how water erosion influences the redistribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) is sorely needed to unravel the role of soil erosion for the carbon (C) budget from local to global scales. The main objective of this study was to determine SOC redistribution and the complete C budget of a loess soil affected by water erosion. We measured fluxes of SOC, dissolved organic C (DOC) and CO2 in a pseudo-replicated rainfall-simulation experiment. We characterized different C fractions in soils and redistributed sediments using density fractionation and determined C enrichment ratios (CER) in the transported sediments. Erosion, transport and subsequent deposition resulted in significantly higher CER of the sediments exported ranging between 1.3 and 4.0. In the exported sediments, C contents (mg per g soil) of particulate organic C (POC, C not bound to soil minerals) and mineral-associated organic C (MOC) were both significantly higher than those of non-eroded soils indicating that water erosion resulted in losses of C-enriched material both in forms of POC and MOC. The averaged SOC fluxes as particles (4.7 g C m−2 yr−1) were 18 times larger than DOC fluxes. Cumulative emission of soil CO2 slightly decreased at the erosion zone while increased by 56% and 27% at the transport and depositional zone, respectively, in comparison to non-eroded soil. Overall, CO2 emission is the predominant form of C loss contributing to about 90.5% of total erosion-induced C losses in our 4-month experiment, which were equal to 18 g C m−2. Nevertheless, only 1.5% of the total redistributed C was mineralized to CO2 indicating a large stabilization after deposition. Our study also underlines the importance of C losses by particles and as DOC for understanding the effects of water erosion on the C balance at the interface of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W1963728829,"RNA polymerase II (Pol II) is the central enzyme that carries out eukaryotic mRNA transcription and consists of a 10-subunit catalytic core and a subcomplex of subunits Rpb4 and Rpb7 (Rpb4/7). Rpb4/7 has been proposed to dissociate from Pol II, enter the cytoplasm, and function there in mRNA translation and degradation. Here we provide evidence that Rpb4 mainly functions in nuclear mRNA synthesis by Pol II, as well as evidence arguing against an important cytoplasmic role in mRNA degradation. We used metabolic RNA labeling and comparative Dynamic Transcriptome Analysis to show that Rpb4 deletion in Saccharomyces cerevisiae causes a drastic defect in mRNA synthesis that is compensated by down-regulation of mRNA degradation, resulting in mRNA level buffering. Deletion of Rpb4 can be rescued by covalent fusion of Rpb4 to the Pol II core subunit Rpb2, which largely restores mRNA synthesis and degradation defects caused by Rpb4 deletion. Thus, Rpb4 is a bona fide Pol II core subunit that functions mainly in mRNA synthesis.

All eukaryotic mRNAs are synthesized by the 12-subunit Pol II enzyme that consists of a 10-subunit catalytic core and a 2-subunit subcomplex made of subunit Rpb4 and Rpb7 (Rpb4/7). Only two Pol II subunits are dispensable for viability in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Rpb4 and Rpb9. Although Rpb9 has been shown to be involved in transcription fidelity (8Ruan W. Lehmann E.

Furthermore, Rpb4 has been reported to function in the degradation of specific mRNAs (21Lotan R. Bar-On V.G. Harel-Sharvit L. Duek L. Melamed D. Choder M. The RNA polymerase II subunit Rpb4p mediates decay of a specific class of mRNAs.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 3004-3016Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), whereas an effect of Rpb7 on mRNA degradation was reported to be general (22Lotan R.

These studies led to the conclusion that Rpb4/7 influence transcription in the nucleus and mRNA degradation in the cytoplasm and were crucial for deriving the model of “mRNA imprinting” (20Haimovich G. Choder M. Singer R.H. Trcek T. The fate of the messenger is pre-determined: a new model for regulation of gene expression.Biochim. Biophys.

Determining whether a protein is directly involved in both processes is not trivial because perturbation of one process leads to compensatory effects of the other. Indeed, such mutual compensation between SRs and DRs is a general phenomenon in cells that has been observed for multiple mutants (1Sun M. Schwalb B. Schulz D. Pirkl N. Etzold S. Larivière L. Maier K.C. Seizl M. Tresch A. Cramer P.

To test for a direct function of Rpb4 in mRNA degradation, a mutant has to be used in which the putative functions in transcription and degradation are uncoupled. We created such a mutant by covalently linking Rpb4 to the Pol II core subunit Rpb2. We show that this Rpb2-Rpb4 fusion mutant rescues all growth and transcription defects of the Rpb4 deletion strain Δrpb4 at 30 and at 37 °C. Furthermore, we could not detect strong differences in mRNA degradation between the Rpb2-Rpb4 mutant and wild-type yeast. These results demonstrate that Rpb4 is a bona fide Pol II subunit with functions in transcription and do argue against the proposed direct function of Rpb4 in mRNA degradation. Δrpb4a strain was obtained from the knock-out library from Euroscarf and was compared against an isogenic wild type (BY4741). The freshly prepared Δrpb4 was created in a different background for comparability with the Rpb2-Rpb4 fusion strain. To this end a strain carrying a genomic deletion of Rpb2 was created in our laboratory. Plasmids pRS316-RPB2, pRS315-RPB2, and pRS315-RPB2-RPB4 were generated by cloning the respective ORF plus sequences 500 bp upstream and 250 bp downstream into pRS315 (ATCC) and pRS316 (ATCC) using XhoI/SacI restriction sites. For pRS315-RPB2-RPB4 overlap, PCRs were used to introduce RPB4 in-frame between RPB2 and the RPB2 3′-UTR (25Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. A general method of in vitro preparation and specific mutagenesis of DNA fragments: study of protein and DNA interactions.Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2098) Google Scholar). We added three glycines as a linker and removed the start methionine in the Rpb4 sequence. The heterozygous RPB2/rpb2Δ S. cerevisiae yeast strain (BY4743, rpb2::KanMX6/RPB2) was generated and transformed with pRS316-RPB2. Diploids were sporulated and tetrads were dissected on YPD plates. The shuffle strain carrying pRS316-RPB2 was transformed with either pRS315-RPB2 or pRS315-RPB2-RPB4 and streaked on 5-fluoroorotic acid plates and then on synthetic complete-Leu plates. The resulting strain carrying pRS315-RPB2 was used as corresponding wild type for the fusion strain carrying pRS315-RPB2-RPB4. Genotypes of the strains are MATa; his3Δ1; leu2Δ0; met15Δ0; LYS2; ura3Δ0 rpb2::KanMX6 pRS315-Rpb2 (wild type); MATa; his3Δ1; leu2Δ0; met15Δ0; LYS2; ura3Δ0 rpb2::KanMX6 rpb4::clonNAT pRS315-Rpb2-Rpb4 (Rpb2-Rpb4 fusion); and MATa; his3Δ1; leu2Δ0; met15Δ0; LYS2; ura3Δ0 rpb2::KanMX6 rpb4::clonNAT pRS315-Rpb2 (Δrpb4 knock-out). Genomic deletion of Rpb4 in the fusion strain as well as in the corresponding wild type was carried out via homologous recombination using a clonNAT cassette amplified from a pYM-natNT2-3HA vector (26Longtine M.S. McKenzie 3rd, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Additional modules for versatile and economical PCR-based gene deletion and modification in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4161) Google Scholar). Directly after generation and strain validation via PCR, yeast strains were stored in 30% glycerol stocks at −80 °C. Experiments were performed from fresh plates from −80 °C stocks, and yeast strains were generally either grown in rich medium (YPD) at optimal growth temperature (30 °C) or under heat shock (37 °C). Overnight cultures of yeast cells were diluted to an A600 of 0.1 and grown until ∼A600 of 0.8. A total of 5 optical densities were sedimented and resuspended in 100 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm MOPS, pH 6.8, 10% SDS, 48% urea, 10 mm EDTA), and 100 μl of glass beads were added. Samples were vortexed for 3 min, and 100 μl of 2× loading buffer (75 mm MOPS, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 48% urea, 3% DTT, 0.2% bromphenol blue) were added and heated to 55 °C for 10 min. Samples were separated on precast gels (NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris, Invitrogen) and analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies against Rpb4 (sc-101604, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), Rpb1 (8WG16, Abcam), Rpb3 (1Y26, NeoClone), and tubulin (sc-69971, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies). Overnight cultures of yeast cells were diluted to A600 ∼0.1 and grown until A600 of 0.5–1. Cells were sedimented and resuspended in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and cross-linked for 10 min. Cross-linking was quenched with 125 mm glycine for 10 min, and cells were sedimented and resuspended in KIP/sorbitol buffer (0.1 m KH2PO4, 1 m sorbitol). Cell walls of cross-linked cells were digested with Zymolyase for 30–45 min at 37 °C. Spheroplasts were washed with PBS twice and resuspended in PBS. Different amounts of cells were spotted on poly-l-lysine (Sigma, P8920)-coated cover glasses. Cells were permeabilized with ice-cold methanol for 6 min, washed with PBS three times, washed one time with PBS + 0.1% Triton X-100, and incubated for 20 min with blocking solution (PBS, 0.1% Tween, 2% bovine serum albumin). 100 μl of a 1:1000 dilution of Rpb4 antibody (sc-101604, Santa-Cruz Biotechnologies) in PBS were used to stain cells for 1 h. Cells were washed six times with PBS before staining with Alexa Fluor® 488 goat anti-mouse antibody (Invitrogen, A31619) for 1 h. Cells were washed five times with PBS and stained with 1 μg/ml DAPI for 5 min. Cells were washed five times with PBS before imaging. Images were taken on a Leica DM2500 microscope with Leica LAS AF software. cDTA was carried out as described (1Sun M. Schwalb B. Schulz D. Pirkl N. Etzold S. Larivière L. Maier K.C. Seizl M. Tresch A. Cramer P. Comparative dynamic transcriptome analysis (cDTA) reveals mutual feedback between mRNA synthesis and degradation.Genome Res. 2012; 22: 1350-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Briefly, S. cerevisiae cells were grown to an A600 of 0.8 and labeled with 4-thiouracil for 6 min. Schizosaccharomyces pombe cultures for normalization were grown to A600 of 0.8 in YES (5 g/liter yeast extract; 30 g/liter glucose; supplements: 225 mg/liter adenine, histidine, leucine, uracil, and lysine hydrochloride) medium and labeled with 4-thiouridine. Heat-shock samples were grown at 30 °C overnight, and an amount equivalent to an A600 of 0.1 was transferred to 37 °C and grown until it reached an A600 of 0.8. Equal numbers of S. pombe cells from one batch were added to equal cell numbers of S. cerevisiae samples for global intensity normalization (1Sun M. Schwalb B. Schulz D. Pirkl N. Etzold S. Larivière L. Maier K.C. Seizl M. Tresch A. Cramer P. Comparative dynamic transcriptome analysis (cDTA) reveals mutual feedback between mRNA synthesis and degradation.Genome Res. 2012; 22: 1350-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Cell lysis was performed on the S. pombe/S. cerevisiae cell mixture for 8 × 40 s with 1 min on ice in between on a MP-Biosciences FastPrep-24 machine. Total RNA was extracted with the RiboPure yeast kit (Ambion/Applied Biotechnologies), following the manufacturer's protocol. Labeled RNA was extracted from 100 μg of total RNA via biotinylation, and total and labeled RNA were analyzed with Affymetrix gene expression arrays as described (1Sun M. Schwalb B. Schulz D.

Analysis of data from cDTA was carried out as described (1Sun M. Schwalb B. Schulz D. Pirkl N. Etzold S. Larivière L. Maier K.C. Seizl M. Tresch A. Cramer P. Comparative dynamic transcriptome analysis (cDTA) reveals mutual feedback between mRNA synthesis and degradation.Genome Res. 2012; 22: 1350-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) using R/Bioconductor and the DTA package (27Schwalb B.

Measurement of genome-wide RNA synthesis and decay rates with Dynamic Transcriptome Analysis (DTA).Bioinformatics. 2012; 28: 884-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Because we used a mixture of S. cerevisiae and S. pombe cells, we used a custom probe annotation environment (cdf) to exclude cross-hybridization probes from our analyses. Labeling bias correction was done as described in Miller et al. (28Miller C. Schwalb B. Maier K. Schulz D. Dümcke S. Zacher B. Mayer A. Sydow J. Marcinowski L. Dölken L. Martin D.E. Tresch A. Cramer P. Dynamic transcriptome analysis measures rates of mRNA synthesis and decay in yeast.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2011; 7: 458Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), and proportional rescaling of microarray intensities to the internal S. pombe standard was done as described in Sun et al. (1Sun M. Schwalb B. Schulz D. Pirkl N. Etzold S. Larivière L. Maier K.C. Seizl M. Tresch A. Cramer P. Comparative dynamic transcriptome analysis (cDTA) reveals mutual feedback between mRNA synthesis and degradation.Genome Res. 2012; 22: 1350-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). mRNA synthesis rates and decay rates were obtained as described in Miller et al. (28Miller C. Schwalb B. Maier K. Schulz D. Dümcke S. Zacher B. Mayer A. Sydow J. Marcinowski L. Dölken L. Martin D.E. Tresch A. Cramer P. Dynamic transcriptome analysis measures rates of mRNA synthesis and decay in yeast.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2011; 7: 458Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Microarray data were deposited in ArrayExpress under accession number E-MTAB-2539. To investigate the general function of Rpb4 in mRNA metabolism under optimum growth conditions at 30 °C, we used a knock-out strain from Euroscarf (Δrpb4a) and performed microarray gene expression analysis. The obtained data revealed that the strain was aneuploid and carried two copies of chromosome 3 (Fig. 1A). Therefore we prepared a fresh knock-out strain of Rpb4 (Δrpb4). We found that the fresh Δrpb4 strain was not aneuploid and was even more growth-defective than the aneuploid Δrpb4a library strain. At optimum growth temperatures, the Δrpb4 strain had a doubling time of 5.3 h (1.6 h for wild type) and the Δrpb4a strain had a doubling time of 3 h (1.5 h for wild type). Our freshly prepared Δrpb4 strain also showed strong variations in colony growth on YPD agar plates, indicating selection of secondary mutations, which was not observed for the Euroscarf Δrpb4a strain (Fig. 1B). These results supported the importance of Rpb4 for cellular mRNA metabolism. To investigate to which extent Rpb4 is required for RNA synthesis, we used cDTA (1Sun M. Schwalb B. Schulz D. Pirkl N. Etzold S. Larivière L. Maier K.C. Seizl M. Tresch A. Cramer P. Comparative dynamic transcriptome analysis (cDTA) reveals mutual feedback between mRNA synthesis and degradation.Genome Res. 2012; 22: 1350-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). cDTA is based on non-perturbing metabolic labeling of newly synthesized RNAs and makes use of fission yeast cells (S. pombe) as an internal standard. cDTA can measure SRs, determine DRs, and detect global -fold changes in rates and mRNA levels (1Sun M. Schwalb B. Schulz D. Pirkl N. Etzold S. Larivière L. Maier K.C. Seizl M. Tresch A. Cramer P.

Cell. 2013; 52: 52-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). This is particularly important when working with factors that can potentially affect the expression of all genes (29Lovén J. Orlando D.A. Sigova A.A. Lin C.Y. Rahl P.B. Burge C.B. Levens D.L. Lee T.I. Young R.A. Revisiting global gene expression analysis.Cell. 2012; 151: 476-482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Application of cDTA to our freshly prepared Δrpb4 strain revealed a strong global defect in both SRs and DRs under optimal growth conditions at 30 °C (Fig. 1C). Although we observed a median 8-fold decrease in SRs as compared with the wild type, the level of total RNA in the Δrpb4 strain was essentially unchanged, due to an 11-fold decrease in DRs (Fig. 1E). mRNA synthesis rates were decreased at least 2-fold for 99.6% of genes, consistent with a global function of Rpb4 in Pol II transcription. When we repeated cDTA with the commercially available knock-out strain of Rpb4 (Δrpb4a), a similarly strong global defect in SRs was observed (7-fold). However, the defect in mRNA degradation was less severe, with a median 3.6-fold decrease in DRs (Fig. 1D), which resulted in 54% lower total RNA levels in the Δrpb4a strain (Fig. 1E). SRs of 99.4% of genes were decreased more than 2-fold in the Δrpb4a strain. The differences in total mRNA levels were comparable with a previous study, where a global decrease of 46% of mRNAs had been observed at 24 °C upon deletion of Rpb4 (12Miyao T. Barnett J.D. Woychik N.A. Deletion of the RNA polymerase subunit RPB4 acts as a global, not stress-specific, shut-off switch for RNA polymerase II transcription at high temperatures.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46408-46413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). SRs in the Δrpb4 and the Δrpb4a mutants were at 12–14% of wild-type values, indicating that the increase in growth rates of the Δrpb4a strain was due to secondary mutations. The simplest explanation for our results is that Rpb4 is a bona fide Pol II subunit. The previously defined general cellular mechanism for buffering of mRNA levels (1Sun M. Schwalb B. Schulz D. Pirkl N. Etzold S. Larivière L. Maier K.C. Seizl M. Tresch A. Cramer P.

This explanation is in line with our previous data and with published work (1Sun M. Schwalb B. Schulz D. Pirkl N. Etzold S. Larivière L. Maier K.C. Seizl M. Tresch A. Cramer P.

https://openalex.org/W1974217364,"Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy (MNGIE) is a rare autosomal recessive mitochondrial disease associated with mutations in the nuclear TYMP gene. As a result, the thymidine phosphorylase (TP) enzyme activity is markedly reduced leading to toxic accumulation of thymidine and therefore altered mitochondrial DNA. MNGIE is characterized by severe gastrointestinal dysmotility, neurological impairment, reduced life expectancy and poor quality of life. There are limited therapeutic options for MNGIE. In the attempt to restore TP activity, allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has been used as cellular source of TP. The results of this approach on ∼ 20 MNGIE patients showed gastrointestinal and neurological improvement, although the 5-year mortality rate is about 70%. In this study we tested whether the liver may serve as an alternative source of TP. We investigated 11 patients (7M; 35-55 years) who underwent hepatic resection for focal disorders. Margins of normal liver tissue were processed to identify, quantify and localize the TP protein by Western Blot, ELISA, and immunohistochemistry, and to evaluate TYMP mRNA expression by qPCR. Western Blot identified TP in liver with a TP/GAPDH ratio of 0.9 ± 0.5. ELISA estimated TP content as 0.5 ± 0.07 ng/μg of total protein. TP was identified in both nuclei and cytoplasm of hepatocytes and sinusoidal lining cells. Finally, TYMP mRNA was expressed in the liver. Overall, our study demonstrates that the liver is an important source of TP. Orthotopic liver transplantation may be considered as a therapeutic alternative for MNGIE patients."
https://openalex.org/W2086407308,"Scots pines (Pinus sylvestris L.) in the inner-Alpine dry valleys of Switzerland have suffered from increased mortality during the past decades, which has been caused by longer and more frequent dry periods. In addition, a proceeding replacement of Scots pines by pubescent oaks (Quercus pubescens Willd.) has been observed. In 2003, an irrigation experiment was performed to track changes by reducing drought pressure on the natural pine forest. After nine years of irrigation, we observed major adaptations in the vegetation and shifts in Scots pine fine root abundance and structure. Irrigation permitted new plant species to assemble and promote canopy closure with a subsequent loss of herb and moss coverage. Fine root dry weight increased under irrigation and fine roots had a tendency to elongate. Structural composition of fine roots remained unaffected by irrigation, expressing preserved proportions of cellulose, lignin and phenolic substances. A shift to a more negative δ13C signal in the fine root C indicates an increased photosynthetic activity in irrigated pine trees. Using radiocarbon (14C) measurement, a reduced mean age of the fine roots in irrigated plots was revealed. The reason for this is either an increase in newly produced fine roots, supported by the increase in fine root biomass, or a reduced lifespan of fine roots which corresponds to an enhanced turnover rate. Overall, the responses belowground to irrigation are less conspicuous than the more rapid adaptations aboveground. Lagged and conservative adaptations of tree roots with decadal lifespans are challenging to detect, hence demanding for long-term surveys. Investigations concerning fine root turnover rate and degradation processes under a changing climate are crucial for a complete understanding of C cycling."
https://openalex.org/W1982875845,"Heat shock cognate protein 70 (Hsc70) acts as a molecular chaperone for the maintenance of intracellular proteins, which allows cancer cells to survive under proteotoxic stress. We attempted to use Hsc70 to identify key molecules in cancer cell survival. Here, we performed mass-spectrometry-based proteomics analysis utilizing affinity purification with anti-Hsc70 antibodies; as a result, 83 differentially expressed proteins were identified under stress conditions. This result implies that there was a change in the proteins with which Hsc70 interacted in response to stress. Among the proteins identified under both serum-depleted and 5-fluorouracil-treated conditions, Rab1A was identified as an essential molecule for cancer cell survival. Hsc70 interacted with Rab1A in a chaperone-dependent manner. In addition, Hsc70 knockdown decreased the level of Rab1A and increased the level of its ubiquitination under stress conditions, suggesting that Hsc70 prevented the degradation of Rab1A denatured by stress exposure. We also found that Rab1A knockdown induced cell death by inhibition of autophagosome formation. Rab1A may therefore contribute to overcoming proteotoxic insults, which allows cancer cells to survive under stress conditions. Analysis of Hsc70 interactors provided insight into changes of intracellular status. We expect further study of the Hsc70 interactome to provide a more comprehensive understanding of cancer cell physiology."
https://openalex.org/W2087145904,"In many communities, older men (i.e., over 25 years of age) have not come forward for Voluntary Medical Male Circumcision (VMMC) services. Reasons for low demand among this group of men are not well understood, and may vary across geographic and cultural contexts. This paper examines the facilitators and barriers to VMMC demand in Turkana County, Kenya, with a focus on older men. This is one of the regions targeted by the VMMC program in Kenya because the Turkana ethnic group does not traditionally circumcise, and the rates of HIV and STD transmission are high.Twenty focus group discussions and 69 in-depth interviews were conducted with circumcised and uncircumcised men and their partners to elicit their attitudes and perceptions toward male circumcision. The interviews were conducted in urban, peri-urban, and rural communities across Turkana. Our results show that barriers to circumcision include stigma associated with VMMC, the perception of low risk for HIV for older men and their ""protection by marriage,"" cultural norms, and a lack of health infrastructure. Facilitators include stigma against not being circumcised (since circumcision is associated with modernity), protection against disease including HIV, and cleanliness. It was also noted that older men should adopt the practice to serve as role models to younger men.Both men and women were generally supportive of VMMC, but overcoming barriers with appropriate communication messages and high quality services will be challenging. The justification of circumcision being a biomedical procedure for protection against HIV will be the most important message for any communication strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2140660822,"The Os1BGlu4 β-glucosidase is the only glycoside hydrolase family 1 member in rice that is predicted to be localized in the cytoplasm. To characterize the biochemical function of rice Os1BGlu4, the Os1bglu4 cDNA was cloned and used to express a thioredoxin fusion protein in Escherichia coli. After removal of the tag, the purified recombinant Os1BGlu4 (rOs1BGlu4) exhibited an optimum pH of 6.5, which is consistent with Os1BGlu4's cytoplasmic localization. Fluorescence microscopy of maize protoplasts and tobacco leaf cells expressing green fluorescent protein-tagged Os1BGlu4 confirmed the cytoplasmic localization. Purified rOs1BGlu4 can hydrolyze p-nitrophenyl (pNP)-β-D-glucoside (pNPGlc) efficiently (kcat/Km = 17.9 mM(-1) · s(-1)), and hydrolyzes pNP-β-D-fucopyranoside with about 50% the efficiency of the pNPGlc. Among natural substrates tested, rOs1BGlu4 efficiently hydrolyzed β-(1,3)-linked oligosaccharides of degree of polymerization (DP) 2-3, and β-(1,4)-linked oligosaccharide of DP 3-4, and hydrolysis of salicin, esculin and p-coumaryl alcohol was also detected. Analysis of the hydrolysis of pNP-β-cellobioside showed that the initial hydrolysis was between the two glucose molecules, and suggested rOs1BGlu4 transglucosylates this substrate. At 10 mM pNPGlc concentration, rOs1BGlu4 can transfer the glucosyl group of pNPGlc to ethanol and pNPGlc. This transglycosylation activity suggests the potential use of Os1BGlu4 for pNP-oligosaccharide and alkyl glycosides synthesis."

Despite the critical role played by kstR regulon, the mechanisms involved in this regulation are still poorly understood, and the inducer molecules of KstR are still unidentified (20Uhía I. Galán B.

The repression of most described TetR-like regulators is released in the presence of an inducer molecule, causing a conformational change in the protein promoting gene transcription (21Ramos J.L.

In this respect, we used EMSA analyses to demonstrate the ability of KstR to bind the MSMEG_5228 promoter region. However, the analyses to evaluate the KstR interactions with its putative inducers, i.e. cholesterol or cholestenone, did not render positive results, and therefore, we could not conclude that these substances directly induce kstR regulon (20Uhía I.

The crystal structure of KstR from M. tuberculosis has recently been revealed (Protein Data Bank code 3MNL) but was solved in the absence of inducers. The literature provides examples of regulators induced by steroids. CmeR from Campilobacter jejuni and BreR from Vibrio cholerae belong to the TetR family of regulators, and both repress the expression of genes that encode multidrug efflux system components in the absence of bile acids (27Cerda-Maira F.A.

Researchers have described the crystal structure of CmeR in a complex with the bile acids cholate and taurocholate (29Lei H.-T. Shen Z. Surana P. Routh M.D. Su C.-C. Zhang Q.

Furthermore, the specific interaction between the negative regulator RepA and testosterone has been also demonstrated in Comamonas testosteroni (30Xiong G. Martin H.-J. Maser E.

Interact. 2003; 143–144: 425-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). To provide further insights into the KstR-mediated repression mechanism in mycobacteria, we used circular dichroism to measure the physical interactions of KstR with several intermediates of the pathway that could act as putative inducers. The compounds that modified the secondary structure of KstR were further tested as inducers in transcription assays in vitro. Our results showed that the concerted action of the two primary independent oxidative steps in cholesterol catabolism at C3 and C26 are necessary to produce the metabolite inducing kstR regulon expression. Cholesterol, cholest-4-en-3-one, 4-androstene-3,17-dione (AD), 1,4-androstadiene-3,17-dione (ADD), palmitic acid, palmitoyl alcohol, oleic acid, oleyl alcohol, 1-octanol, octanoic acid, decane, tyloxapol, Tween 80, Triton X-100, and streptomycin sulfate were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Choles-5-ene-3β,26-diol (26-hydroxycholesterol (26OHCh)), 3OHChA, and 3OChA were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids. Bacterial strains and plasmids are listed in Table 1.

M. smegmatis mc2155 was grown in 7H9 medium (Difco) containing 10% albumin-dextrose-catalase supplement (Becton Dickinson), 0.2% glycerol, and 0.05% Tween 80 or on 7H10 solid agar medium with the same supplements without Tween 80. For growth in glycerol, cholesterol and palmitic acid as sole carbon sources, 7H9 minimal medium without supplements was used, and the carbon sources were added at 18, 1.8, and 3 mm, respectively. Stocks of 5 mm cholesterol and 8 mm palmitic acid were dissolved in 10% of tyloxapol with magnetic agitation at 80 °C and then autoclaved. Gentamicin and kanamycin were used, if required, at concentrations of 5 and 20 μg ml−1, respectively. M. smegmatis was always grown at 37 °C in an orbital shaker at 250 rpm.TABLE 1Bacterial strains, plasmids, and primers used in this studyStrain, plasmids, and primersGenotype, description, or sequenceSource or referenceMycobacterium smegmatis mc2155ept-1, mc26 mutant efficient for electroporationRef. 54Snapper S.B.

https://openalex.org/W2014035071,"Canine hip dysplasia (CHD) is the most common hereditary skeletal disorder in dogs. To identify common alleles associated with CHD, we genotyped 96 German Shepherd Dogs affected by mild, moderate and severe CHD and 96 breed, sex, age and birth year matched controls using the Affymetrix canine high density SNP chip. A mixed linear model analysis identified five SNPs associated with CHD scores on dog chromosomes (CFA) 19, 24, 26 and 34. These five SNPs were validated in a by sex, age, birth year and coancestry stratified sample of 843 German Shepherd Dogs including 277 unaffected dogs and 566 CHD-affected dogs. Mean coancestry coefficients among and within cases and controls were <0.1%. Genotype effects of these SNPs explained 20-32% of the phenotypic variance of CHD in German Shepherd Dogs employed for validation. Genome-wide significance in the validation data set could be shown for each one CHD-associated SNP on CFA24, 26 and 34. These SNPs are located within or in close proximity of genes involved in bone formation and related through a joint network. The present study validated positional candidate genes within two previously known quantitative trait loci (QTL) and a novel QTL for CHD in German Shepherd Dogs."
https://openalex.org/W2130583119,"As voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) programs scale up, there is a pressing need for information about the important cost drivers, and potential efficiency gains. We examine those cost drivers here, and estimate the potential efficiency gains through an econometric model.We examined the main cost drivers (i.e., personnel and consumables) associated with providing VMMC in sub-Saharan Africa along a number of dimensions, including facility type and service provider. Primary source facility level data from Kenya, Namibia, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia were utilized throughout. We estimated the efficiency gains by econometrically estimating a cost function in order to calculate the impact of scale and other relevant factors. Personnel and consumables were estimated at 36% and 28%, respectively, of total costs across countries. Economies of scale (EOS) is estimated to be eight at the median volume of VMMCs performed, and EOS falls from 23 at the 25th percentile volume of VMMCs performed to 5.1 at the 75th percentile.The analysis suggests that there is significant room for efficiency improvement as indicated by declining EOS as VMMC volume increases. The scale of the fall in EOS as VMMC volume increases suggests that we are still at the ascension phase of the scale-up of VMMC, where continuing to add new sites results in additional start-up costs as well. A key aspect of improving efficiency is task sharing VMMC procedures, due to the large percentage of overall costs associated with personnel costs. In addition, efficiency improvements in consumables are likely to occur over time as prices and distribution costs decrease."
https://openalex.org/W1996943335,"Plant ontogeny is a common source of variation in defense and herbivory. Yet, few studies have investigated how the induction of physical defense traits changes across plant ontogeny. Physical defense traits are costly to produce, and thus, it was predicted that induction as a cost-saving strategy would be particularly favorable for seedlings, leading to ontogenetic declines in the inducibility of these traits. We tested for induction of three different physical defense traits (prickles, latex and leaf toughness) in response to mechanical defoliation and jasmonic acid application using prickly poppies (Argemone glauca and A. mexicana, Papaveraceae) as a model system. Genetic variation in the induction of physical defenses was tested using maternal sib-ships sampled from multiple populations. Both species induced higher densities of laminar prickles, although the magnitude of induction was much higher in the endemic Hawaiian prickly poppy, A. glauca, than in the cosmopolitan A. mexicana. The magnitude of prickle induction was also higher in young compared to older juvenile plant stages in A. glauca, demonstrating a strong role of ontogeny. Neither latex exudation nor leaf toughness was induced in either species. Although significant genetic variation was detected within and among populations for constitutive expression of physical defense traits in Argemone, there was no evidence for genetic variation in the induction of these traits. This study provides the first evidence for the induction of physical defenses in prickly poppies, emphasizing how an ontogenetically explicit framework can reveal new insights into plant defense. Moreover, this study illustrates how sister species comparisons between island vs. continental plants can provide new insights into plant functional and evolutionary ecology, highlighting a fruitful area for future research on more species pairs."
https://openalex.org/W2116580120,"Scaling up voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) to 80% of men aged 15-49 within five years could avert 3.4 million new HIV infections in Eastern and Southern Africa by 2025. Since 2009, Tanzania and Zimbabwe have rapidly expanded VMMC services through different delivery (fixed, outreach or mobile) and intensity (routine services, campaign) models. This review describes the modality and intensity of VMMC services and its influence on the number and age of clients.Program reviews were conducted using data from implementing partners in Tanzania (MCHIP) and Zimbabwe (PSI). Key informant interviews (N = 13 Tanzania; N = 8 Zimbabwe) were conducted; transcripts were analyzed using Nvivo. Routine VMMC service data for May 2009-December 2012 were analyzed and presented in frequency tables. A descriptive analysis and association was performed using the z-ratio for the significance of the difference. Key informants in both Tanzania and Zimbabwe believe VMMC scale-up can be achieved by using a mix of service delivery modality and intensity approaches. In Tanzania, the majority of clients served during campaigns (59%) were aged 10-14 years while the majority during routine service delivery (64%) were above 15 (p<0.0001). In Zimbabwe, significantly more VMMCs were done during campaigns (64%) than during routine service delivery (36%) (p<0.00001); the difference in the age of clients accessing services in campaign versus non-campaign settings was significant for age groups 10-24 (p<0.05), but not for older groups.In Tanzania and Zimbabwe, service delivery modalities and intensities affect client profiles in conjunction with other contextual factors such as implementing campaigns during school holidays in Zimbabwe and cultural preference for circumcision at a young age in Tanzania. Formative research needs to be an integral part of VMMC programs to guide the design of service delivery modalities in the face of, or lack of, strong social norms."
https://openalex.org/W2029435896,"Given the proven effectiveness of voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) in preventing the spread of HIV, Tanzania is scaling up VMMC as an HIV prevention strategy. This study will inform policymakers about the potential costs and benefits of scaling up VMMC services in Tanzania.The analysis first assessed the unit costs of delivering VMMC at the facility level in three regions-Iringa, Kagera, and Mbeya-via three currently used VMMC service delivery models (routine, campaign, and mobile/island outreach). Subsequently, using these unit cost data estimates, the study used the Decision Makers' Program Planning Tool (DMPPT) to estimate the costs and impact of a scaled-up VMMC program.Increasing VMMC could substantially reduce HIV infection. Scaling up adult VMMC to reach 87.9% coverage by 2015 would avert nearly 23,000 new adult HIV infections through 2015 and an additional 167,500 from 2016 through 2025-at an additional cost of US$253.7 million through 2015 and US$302.3 million from 2016 through 2025. Average cost per HIV infection averted would be US$11,300 during 2010-2015 and US$3,200 during 2010-2025. Scaling up VMMC in Tanzania will yield significant net benefits (benefits of treatment costs averted minus the cost of performing circumcisions) in the long run-around US$4,200 in net benefits for each infection averted.VMMC could have an immediate impact on HIV transmission, but the full impact on prevalence and deaths will only be apparent in the longer term because VMMC averts infections some years into the future among people who have been circumcised. Given the health and economic benefits of investing in VMMC, the scale-up of services should continue to be a central component of the national HIV prevention strategy in Tanzania."
https://openalex.org/W1991534309,"To determine whether metabolic syndrome traits influence the postprandial lipemia response of coronary patients, and whether this influence depends on the number of MetS criteria.1002 coronary artery disease patients from the CORDIOPREV study were submitted to an oral fat load test meal with 0.7 g fat/kg body weight (12% saturated fatty acids, 10% polyunsaturated fatty acids, 43% monounsaturated fatty acids), 10% protein and 25% carbohydrates. Serial blood test analyzing lipid fractions were drawn at 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 hours during the postprandial state. Total and incremental area under the curves of the different postprandial parameters were calculated following the trapezoid rule to assess the magnitude of change during the postprandial state.Postprandial lipemia response was directly related to the presence of metabolic syndrome. We found a positive association between the number of metabolic syndrome criteria and the response of postprandial plasma triglycerides (p<0.001), area under the curve of triglycerides (p<0.001) and incremental area under the curve of triglycerides (p<0.001). However, the influence of them on postprandial triglycerides remained statistically significant only in those patients without basal hypertriglyceridemia. Interestingly, in stepwise multiple linear regression analysis with the AUC of triglycerides as the dependent variable, only fasting triglycerides, fasting glucose and waist circumference appeared as significant independent (P<0.05) contributors. The multiple lineal regression (R) was 0.77, and fasting triglycerides showed the greatest effect on AUC of triglycerides with a standardized coefficient of 0.75.Fasting triglycerides are the major contributors to the postprandial triglycerides levels. MetS influences the postprandial response of lipids in patients with coronary heart disease, particularly in non-hypertriglyceridemic patients."
https://openalex.org/W2090706149,"Habitat fragmentation and flow regulation are significant factors related to the decline and extinction of freshwater biota. Pelagic-broadcast spawning cyprinids require moving water and some length of unfragmented stream to complete their life cycle. However, it is unknown how discharge and habitat features interact at multiple spatial scales to alter the transport of semi-buoyant fish eggs. Our objective was to assess the relationship between downstream drift of semi-buoyant egg surrogates (gellan beads) and discharge and habitat complexity. We quantified transport time of a known quantity of beads using 2-3 sampling devices at each of seven locations on the North Canadian and Canadian rivers. Transport time was assessed based on median capture time (time at which 50% of beads were captured) and sampling period (time period when 2.5% and 97.5% of beads were captured). Habitat complexity was assessed by calculating width∶depth ratios at each site, and several habitat metrics determined using analyses of aerial photographs. Median time of egg capture was negatively correlated to site discharge. The temporal extent of the sampling period at each site was negatively correlated to both site discharge and habitat-patch dispersion. Our results highlight the role of discharge in driving transport times, but also indicate that higher dispersion of habitat patches relates to increased retention of beads within the river. These results could be used to target restoration activities or prioritize water use to create and maintain habitat complexity within large, fragmented river systems."
https://openalex.org/W2090838597,"Path integration is a process in which observers derive their location by integrating self-motion signals along their locomotion trajectory. Although the medial temporal lobe (MTL) is thought to take part in path integration, the scope of its role for path integration remains unclear. To address this issue, we administered a variety of tasks involving path integration and other related processes to a group of neurosurgical patients whose MTL was unilaterally resected as therapy for epilepsy. These patients were unimpaired relative to neurologically intact controls in many tasks that required integration of various kinds of sensory self-motion information. However, the same patients (especially those who had lesions in the right hemisphere) walked farther than the controls when attempting to walk without vision to a previewed target. Importantly, this task was unique in our test battery in that it allowed participants to form a mental representation of the target location and anticipate their upcoming walking trajectory before they began moving. Thus, these results put forth a new idea that the role of MTL structures for human path integration may stem from their participation in predicting the consequences of one's locomotor actions. The strengths of this new theoretical viewpoint are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2069385355,"We previously reported an interorgan system in which stress-related hormones (corticosterone and noradrenaline), interleukin-6, and glutathione (GSH) coordinately regulate metastatic growth of highly aggressive B16-F10 melanoma cells. Corticosterone, at levels measured in tumor-bearing mice, also induces apoptotic cell death in metastatic cells with low GSH content. In the present study we explored the potential role of glucocorticoids in the regulation of metastatic cell death/survival during the early stages of organ invasion. Glucocorticoid receptor (GCR) knockdown decreased the expression and activity of γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (γ-GCS), the rate-limiting step in GSH synthesis, in metastatic cells in vivo independent of the tumor location (liver, lung, or subcutaneous). The decrease in γ-GCS activity was associated with lower intracellular GSH levels. Nrf2- and p53-dependent down-regulation of γ-GCS was associated with a decrease in the activities of superoxide dismutase 1 and 2, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione reductase, but not of the O2--generating NADPH oxidase. The GCR knockdown-induced decrease in antioxidant protection caused a drastic decrease in the survival of metastatic cells during their interaction with endothelial cells, both in vitro and in vivo; only 10% of cancer cells attached to the endothelium survived compared to 90% survival observed in the controls. This very low rate of metastatic cell survival was partially increased (up to 52%) in vivo by inoculating B16-F10 cells preloaded with GSH ester, which enters the cell and delivers free GSH. Taken together, our results indicate that glucocorticoid signaling influences the survival of metastatic cells during their interaction with the vascular endothelium."
https://openalex.org/W1978289952,"Cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTL) have been reported to show a range of motility patterns from rapid long-range tracking to complete arrest, but how and whether these kinematics affect their ability to kill target cells is not known. Many in vitro killing assays utilize cell lines and tumour-derived cells as targets, which may be of limited relevance to the kinetics of CTL-mediated killing of somatic cells. Here, live-cell microscopy is used to examine the interactions of CTL and primary murine skin cells presenting antigens. We developed a qualitative and quantitative killing assay using extended-duration fluorescence time-lapse microscopy coupled with large-volume objective software-based data analysis to obtain population data of cell-to-cell interactions, motility and apoptosis. In vivo and ex vivo activated antigen-specific cytotoxic lymphocytes were added to primary keratinocyte targets in culture with fluorometric detection of caspase-3 activation in targets as an objective determinant of apoptosis. We found that activated CTL achieved contact-dependent apoptosis of non-tumour targets after a period of prolonged attachment – on average 21 hours – which was determined by target cell type, amount of antigen, and activation status of CTL. Activation of CTL even without engagement of the T cell receptor was sufficient to mobilise cells significantly above baseline, while the addition of cognate antigen further enhanced their motility. Highly activated CTL showed markedly increased vector displacement, and velocity, and lead to increased antigen-specific target cell death. These data show that the inherent kinematics of CTL correlate directly with their ability to kill non-tumour cells presenting cognate antigen."

The following high-affinity cytokine/α-receptor pairs exist: CLC/CNTFR, CNTF/CNTFR, IL-6/IL-6R, IL-11/IL-11R, and p28/Epstein-Barr virs-induced gene 3 (1Garbers C. Hermanns H.M. Schaper F.

Plasticity and cross-talk of interleukin 6-type cytokines.Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2012; 23: 85-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Moreover, the IL-6R was described as alternative low affinity α-receptor for CNTF and p28 (2Garbers C. Spudy B. Aparicio-Siegmund S. Waetzig G.H. Sommer J. Hölscher C. Rose-John S. Grötzinger J.

IL-6 type cytokines have a typical four-helix bundle fold that links the four α-helices (A-D) by two long loops (A-B and C-D) and one short loop (B-C) placing the four helices in an up-up-down-down orientation. Here, site I of the cytokine binds to the α-receptor, whereas site II and site III are needed for the interaction with the β-receptors. Site I is constituted by the C-terminal A-B loop (site Ia) and the C-terminal D helix (site Ib), site II by parts of the A and C helix and site III by the C-terminal A helix and the N-terminal A-B loop (site IIIa), the B-C loop with adjacent parts of the B and C helix (site IIIb), and the C-terminal C-D loop with the adjoining NH2-terminal D helix (site IIIc). Binding of IL-6 type cytokines to their receptors is mainly mediated by ionic and hydrophobic interactions (4Grötzinger J. Kurapkat G. Wollmer A. Kalai M. Rose-John S. The family of the IL-6-type cytokines: specificity and promiscuity of the receptor complexes.Proteins. 1997; 27: 96-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Close inspection of the electrostatic surface potential of site I, II, and III of IL-6 type cytokines, however, reveals almost no similarity. Cross-reactivity is likely entropy driven by water exclusion from the interacting surfaces (5Wang X. Lupardus P. Laporte S.L. Garcia K.C. Structural biology of shared cytokine receptors.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 27: 29-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Interestingly, species-specific differences of cytokine/receptor interactions within the IL-6 type cytokine family were described. This is exemplified by differences for human and murine IL-6 and OSM. Human IL-6 binds to human and murine IL-6R·gp130 receptor complexes, but murine IL-6 exclusively binds to murine IL-6R·gp130 receptor complexes (2Garbers C. Spudy B. Aparicio-Siegmund S. Waetzig G.H. Sommer J. Hölscher C. Rose-John S. Grötzinger J. Lorenzen I. Scheller J.

Furthermore, human OSM bind to both human LIFR and OSM receptor, but murine OSM exclusively interacts with murine OSM receptor (6Ichihara M. Hara T. Kim H. Murate T. Miyajima A.

Rat CNTF is able to engage signaling via a heterodimer of gp130/LIFR in the absence of CNTFR (8Gearing D.P. Ziegler S.F. Comeau M.R. Friend D. Thoma B. Cosman D. Park L. Mosley B. Proliferative responses and binding properties of hematopoietic cells transfected with low-affinity receptors for leukemia inhibitory factor, oncostatin M, and ciliary neurotrophic factor.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 1119-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), which has not been observed for murine or human CNTF. Furthermore, transfer of the binding site III between IL-6 type cytokines led to chimeric cytokines with novel and unique receptor specificities (9Kallen K.J. Grötzinger J. Lelièvre E. Vollmer P. Aasland D. Renné C. Müllberg J. Myer zum Büschenfelde K.H. Gascan H. Rose-John S.

Following binding to the IL-6R via site I, IC-7 recruits gp130 to site II and the LIFR by site III. On cells expressing the IL-6R, gp130, and the LIFR, IC-7 displays biological activities comparable with that of LIF or IL-6, but it is inactive on cells that do not express the IL-6R (9Kallen K.J.

Viral IL-6 signals via a gp130 receptor homodimer but in contrast to IL-6 without the need of the IL-6Rα (10Müllberg J. Geib T. Jostock T. Hoischen S.H. Vollmer P. Voltz N. Heinz D. Galle P.R.

IV-9 is a chimera of IL-6 and viral IL-6, in which an extended site III of IL-6 is exchanged by site III of viral IL-6. Consequently, IV-9 signaling via a gp130 homodimer was independent of the IL-6R (11Adam N. Rabe B. Suthaus J. Grötzinger J. Rose-John S. Scheller J.

Virol. 2009; 83: 5117-5126Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The transfer of site I or II has, however, not been described as of yet. Moreover, abrogation of promiscuous cytokine/receptor usage by introduction of single point mutations within the cytokine or cytokine receptor has also not been achieved. Generation of CNTF or p28 variants specific for a single receptor would pave the way to analyze the function of CNTF/CNTFR- versus CNTF/IL-6R-induced or p28/EBI3 versus p28/IL-6R-induced signal transduction in vivo. A CNTFR-selective CNTF might be achieved by transfer of site I from the CNTFR-selective cytokine CLC to CNTF or by introduction of specific amino acid exchanges in CNTF. Importantly, because even though the binding to the low affinity α-receptor will be abrogated, this must not result in a major reduction of binding affinity of CNTF to the high-affinity CNTFR. Here, we describe the development the human CNTF variant (CV)-1, which binds with high affinity to the CNTFR and induces signal transduction via LIFR and gp130. Due to the single point mutation R28E, interaction of CV-1 with the IL-6R was abrogated. CV-1 might be used to discriminate between IL-6R and CNTFR-mediated effects of CNTF in vivo. Ba/F3-gp130 cells transduced with human gp130 were obtained from Immunex (Seattle, WA) (12Gearing A.J. Beckett P. Christodoulou M. Churchill M. Clements J. Davidson A.H. Drummond A.H. Galloway W.A.

All cells were grown in DMEM high-glucose culture medium (PAA Laboratories, Cölbe, Germany) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (60 mg/liter), and streptomycin (100 mg/liter) at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in a water-saturated atmosphere. All Ba/F3 cells were cultured using 10 ng/ml recombinant Hyper IL-6, which is a fusion protein of IL-6 and soluble IL-6R (sIL-6R) acts as a growth factor for Ba/F3-gp130 cells (14Fischer M.

Human LIF was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Phospho-STAT3 mAb (Tyr-705) and STAT3 mAb (124H6) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Frankfurt, Germany). The peroxidase conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Pierce (Thermo Scientific). All restriction enzymes were obtained from Fermentas (Thermo Scientific). The bacterial expression plasmid pet23a(+)-CNTF (d14d15-C17A-Q63R-CNTF) coding for a N- and C-terminal shortened version of CNTF, including the amino acid exchanges C17A and Q63R was generated using standard PCR and mutagenesis procedures. pet23a(+)-CNTF and pet23a(+)-CLC were used to generate the expression plasmids pet23a(+)-CV-1 to pet23a(+)-CV-5 using site-directed mutagenesis (pet23a(+)-CV-1) and splicing by overlapping extension PCR (pet23a(+)-CV-2 to pet23a(+)-CV-5). Initially, PCR products were cloned into pPCR-Script Amp SK(+) and subcloned into pet23a(+) via NdeI and NotI restriction sites. The sequences of all primers used are available on request. To generate a fusion protein of human soluble CNTFR (sCNTFR) with an Fc portion, the coding sequence of CNTFR (corresponding to amino acids 1–346) was amplified by PCR. In 5′ and 3′ of sCNTFR SalI BglII restriction sites were inserted (5′ primer: AAAGCGTCGACGCGTGCTTGGTGTGTGGCC and 3′ primer AAAGTCACAAGATCTGGGCTCTACGGGTCC). CNTFR was subcloned via SalI and BglII into pDC409-sIL-6R-Fc (10Müllberg J. Geib T. Jostock T. Hoischen S.H. Vollmer P. Voltz N. Heinz D. Galle P.R. Klouche M. Rose-John S.

Expression of CV-1 to CV-5, CLC, IC-7, IL-6, and CNTF was performed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) (Merck KGaA). In detail, protein expression was induced at an A600 of 0.8 with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were harvested after 4 h at 37 °C. The pelleted bacterial cells were lysed by sonification (Sonopuls HD2200, Bandelin, Berlin, Germany). CV-1 to CV-5, CLC, IC-7, and CNTF inclusion bodies were purified by repeated washing and sonification steps (three times) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.2% Tween 20, pH 8.0, followed by washing with (three times) 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Purified inclusion bodies were solved in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Denatured CV-1 to CV-5, IC-7, IL-6, and CNTF were refolded at a protein concentration of 0.1 mg/ml by two-step 24-h dialysis against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 m GuHCl, 3 mm oxidized glutathione, 0.6 mm reduced glutathione and against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 3 mm reduced glutathione, and 0.9 mm oxidized glutathione. CLC was refolded by dialysis against 50 mm CAPS, pH 11. Dialyzed CV-1 to CV-5, CLC, IC-7, IL-6, and CNTF were centrifuged for 30 min at 40,000 × g at 4 °C. CV-1 to CV-5, CLC, IC-7, IL-6, and CNTF were sterile filtered and concentrated with an Amicon stirred ultrafiltration cell equipped with an YM10 filter membrane, nominal molecular weight limit of 10,000 (Merck Millipore, Merck KGaA, Germany). CV-1 to CV-5, CLC, IC-7, IL-6, and CNTF were purified by size exclusion chromatography with an ÄKTAexplorer chromatography system and a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 prep grade column (both from GE Healthcare). The fractions containing monomeric CV-1 to CV-5, CLC, IC-7, IL-6, and CNTF were concentrated by a Vivaspin 20 column, molecular weight cut-off of 10,000 (GE Healthcare). Pure CV-1 to CV-5, CLC, IC-7, IL-6, and CNTF proteins were analyzed by Coomassie Blue staining and Western blotting using a standard SDS-PAGE under reduced conditions using biotinylated mouse c-Myc (9E10) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Folding of pure monomeric CV-1 to CV-5, CLC, IC-7, IL-6, and CNTF was verified by circular dichroism in a quartz cuvette (Helma, Mühlheim, Germany) with a Jasco J-720 CD-spectropolarimeter (Jasco Corp., Tokyo, Japan). The instrument was calibrated with an aqueous solution of 10-camphosulfonic acid at 25 °C. The spectral bandwidth was 1.5 nm. The different transduced Ba/F3 cell lines were washed three times with sterile PBS and suspended in DMEM containing 10% FBS at a final concentration of 5 × 103 cells per well in a 96-well microtiter plate. Cells were incubated for 72 h as indicated with the cytokines and cytokine receptors in a final volume of 100 μl. After 72 h, cell growth was measured using the CellTiter Blue cell viability assay reagent (Promega, Karlsruhe, Germany) following the manufacturer's instructions. The extinction was measured using a Lambda FLUORO 320 microplate fluorescence reader (excitation, filter 530/25; emission, filter 590/35; Software KC4, Bio-Tek Instruments). Normalization of relative light units was achieved by subtraction of negative control values. One representative example of two to three experiments was chosen for the figures. For clarity, no standard deviations were included in the diagrams; the S.D. were, as common for Ba/F3 cells, only minimally and usually below 5%. For co-precipitation, supernatants of p409DC-IL-6R-Fc and pDC-CNTFR-Fc transiently transfected COS-7 were collected. For co-precipitation supernatants (transfected or co-transfected as indicated) were mixed with recombinant proteins (1 μg) incubated 2 h at 4 °C under gentle agitation. As control, a further tube containing the corresponding cytokine was incubated without receptor containing supernatant. 150 μl of protein A-agarose (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) was added, and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 2 h under gentle agitation. The samples were washed six times with PBS, and proteins were eluted by adding 50 μl of Laemmli buffer and incubated for 10 min at 95 °C. The resulting supernatants were subjected to Western blot analysis. For Western blotting, ∼2 × 107 cells per experiment were washed three times with sterile PBS. The cells were distributed to 2-ml tubes and starved in FBS-free medium for 4–6 h (Ba/F3 cell lines) or overnight (HepG2 cells) at 37 °C and CO2 saturation. Cells were stimulated with the indicated cytokines for 10 min followed by centrifugation at 4 °C and 2,000 rpm for 10 min. 150 μl of 5× Laemmli buffer (312 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 50% glycerol, 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.13% bromphenol blue) were added to each tube, and cells were lysed by sonification (Sonopuls HD2200, Bandelin, Berlin, Germany) for 10 s and boiling at 95 °C for 10 min. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane using a Trans-Blot SD semi-dry transfer cell (Bio-Rad). The membrane was blocked in 5% low fat milk in TBS-T (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Tween 20) and probed with the primary antibody in 1% low fat milk in TBS-T (STAT3-mAb) or 5% BSA (pSTAT3-mAb) at 4 °C overnight. The membranes were washed and incubated with the secondary peroxidase-conjugated antibody for 1 h before applying the ECL-plus peroxidase substrate (GE Healthcare). The Fluor ChemQ system (Cell Biosciences, Santa Clara, CA) was used for signal detection according to the manufacturer's instructions. The membranes were stripped with stripping buffer (20 ml of 10% SDS, 12.5 ml of 0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 67.5 ml of ultra-pure water, 0.8 ml of β-mercaptoethanol), blocked again, and probed with another primary antibody. The STAT3 phosphorylation assays were reproduced three times with one representative experiment shown. Binding of CNTF to its α-receptors CNTFR or IL-6R is mediated via site I of CNTF and the cytokine binding module of the α-receptors. CNTF has a higher affinity to the CNTFR than to the IL-6R (3Schuster B. Kovaleva M. Sun Y. Regenhard P. Matthews V. Grötzinger J. Rose-John S. Kallen K.J.

Chem. 2003; 278: 9528-9535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Also, CLC needs the CNTFR for signaling via gp130 and LIFR, but cannot bind to the IL-6R. CLC has, however, a lower efficiency to signal via CNTFR·gp130·LIFR complexes as compared with CNTF (16Tormo A.J. Letellier M.C. Lissilaa R. Batraville L.A. Sharma M. Elson G. Crabé S. Gauchat J.F.

Fig. 1A illustrates the binding site I of CLC and CNTF, respectively. In this study, we aimed to generate a CNTFR-selective CNTF variant without influencing the affinity of CNTF to the CNTFR·gp130·LIFR complex. In the past, successful transfer of the binding site III of CNTF to IL-6 led to the chimeric IL-6 variant IC-7, which signals via the artificial IL-6R·gp130·LIFR complex (9Kallen K.J. Grötzinger J. Lelièvre E. Vollmer P. Aasland D. Renné C. Müllberg J. Myer zum Büschenfelde K.H. Gascan H. Rose-John S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 11859-11867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Here, this strategy was also applied to site I of CNTF. We generated potential CNTFR-selective CNTF variants by transfer of amino acid residues of site I from CLC to CNTF (Fig. 1A). Alternatively, using molecular modeling of CLC·CNTFR and CNTF·CNTFR complexes, we predicted that the amino acid Glu-26 in CLC might be involved in CNTFR selectivity because it is in close contact to the CNTFR (Fig. 1B). The respective amino acid in CNTF was identified to be Arg28. As a starting point, we generated a shortened CNTF variant to improve recombinant CNTF protein expression in E. coli and to support the refolding efficiency from CNTF inclusion bodies. Therefore, the cDNA coding for CNTF was modified to code for a N-terminal deletion of the amino acids 1–14 and a C-terminal deletion of the amino acids 186–200 (17Krüttgen A. Grötzinger J. Kurapkat G. Weis J. Simon R. Thier M. Schröder M. Heinrich P. Wollmer A. Comeau M. Human ciliary neurotrophic factor: a structure-function analysis.Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Moreover, two point mutations coding for the amino acid exchanges C17A and Q63R were introduced (Fig. 1C). With the exception of the C-terminal deletion, all other modifications were described previously for the CNTF variant Axokine. Axokine was shown to have an improved biological activity as compared with CNTF (18Preti A. Axokine (Regeneron).IDrugs. 2003; 6: 696-701PubMed Google Scholar). A sequence coding for a C-terminal c-Myc and His tag was introduced in all cytokine-encoding cDNAs, including CNTF, CLC, IL-6, LIF, and IC-7. The cDNA coding for CNTF served as a platform for the transfer of amino acids from CLC to CNTF in CV-1 to CV5. CV-1 contained the single amino acid substitution R28E, located in close proximity to site I, CV-2 contained the extended site Ia (CNTF-His41–Leu67 to CLC-Gly41–Leu72) and CV-3 the minimal site Ia (CNTF-Ala59–Leu67 to CLC-Ala62–Leu72), CV-4 contained the site Ib (CNTF-Thr169–Gly185 to CLC-Leu170–Pro186) and CV-5 contained all exchanges, the extended site Ia and site Ib and the amino acid substitution R28E (CNTF-His41–Leu67 to CLC-Gly41–Leu72/CNTF-Thr169–Gly185 to CLC-Leu170–Pro186/R28E) (Fig. 1C). CLC, CNTF, CV-1, CV-2, CV-3, CV-4, CV-5, IL-6, and IC-7 were expressed in E. coli as inclusion bodies, refolded, and purified. Purification was completed by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography and size-exclusion chromatography. All cytokines were produced as monomers (Fig. 2A and supplemental Fig. 1) and correctly folded as verified by circular dichroism revealing the typical spectra of α helical proteins (Fig. 2B and supplemental Fig. 1). Purity and identity of correctly folded and monomeric CLC, CNTF, CV-1 to CV-5, IL-6, and IC-7 was shown by Coomassie staining of SDS-PAGE gels and Western blotting against the C-terminal cytokine Myc tag, respectively (Fig. 2, C and D, and supplemental Fig. 1, A–H). First, we tested whether CNTF, CLC, IL-6, and the CNTF variants CV-1 to CV-5 were able to bind to CNTFR or IL-6R by co-precipitation. To this end, cDNAs coding for sCNTFR and sIL-6R C-terminally fused to an Fc part of an IgG1 antibody were subcloned and transiently transfected into COS-7 cells. sIL-6R-Fc or sCNTFR-Fc conditioned cell culture supernatants were used for Protein A-mediated co-precipitation of recombinant CNTF, CLC, IL-6, and CV-1 to CV-5. Precipitated cytokines were detected by Western blotting using a mAb against the C-terminal c-Myc tag. Non-precipitated input served as positive control, precipitation without sCNTFR-Fc or sIL-6R-Fc as negative control. As expected, co-precipitation of CLC and CNTF but not of IL-6 was mediated by sCNTFR-Fc (Fig. 3A). In the CNTF analog Axokine and in CNTF, Gln-63 of human CNTF was exchanged to Arg63 of rat CNTF, which increased the specific activity of human CNTF (18Preti A. Axokine (Regeneron).IDrugs. 2003; 6: 696-701PubMed Google Scholar). Because rat CNTF does not need to bind to the human IL-6R (8Gearing D.P. Ziegler S.F. Comeau M.R. Friend D. Thoma B. Cosman D. Park L. Mosley B. Proliferative responses and binding properties of hematopoietic cells transfected with low-affinity receptors for leukemia inhibitory factor, oncostatin M, and ciliary neurotrophic factor.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 1119-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), it remained open, whether this mutation also abolished the binding of human CNTF to signal via CNTFR or IL-6R. Molecular modeling, however, indicated that Arg63 is not involved in the interaction area between human CNTF and the human IL-6R or CNTFR. Here, our co-precipitation experiments showed that the Q63R did not abolish binding of CNTF to the IL-6R and the CNTFR (Fig. 3, A and B). Importantly, all CNTF variants CV-1, CV-2, CV-3, CV-4, and CV-5 were also precipitated by sCNTFR-Fc, indicating that CV-1, CV-2, CV-3, CV-4, and CV-5 were able to form heterodimeric complexes with the CNTFR (Fig. 3A). As expected, co-precipitation of IL-6 and CNTF but not of CLC was also mediated by sIL-6R-Fc (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, only the CNTF-variant CV-3 and CV-4 were co-precipitated by sIL-6R-Fc, indicating that the amino acid exchange(s) in CV-1, CV-2 and CV-5 were sufficient to abrogate interaction with the IL-6R (Fig. 3B). We concluded that CV-1, CV-2 and CV-5 have CNTFR-selective binding properties. To test CV-1 to CV-5 in a biological system, we gen"
https://openalex.org/W2028358543,"Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a leading cause of blindness in children worldwide due to increasing survival rates of premature infants. Initial suppression, followed by increased production of the retinal vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF) expression are key events that trigger the pathological neovascularization in ROP. Fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4) is an intracellular lipid chaperone that is induced by VEGF in a subset of endothelial cells. FABP4 exhibits a pro-angiogenic function in cultured endothelial cells and in airway microvasculature, but whether it plays a role in modulation of retinal angiogenesis is not known. We hypothesized that FABP4 deficiency could ameliorate pathological retinal vascularization and investigated this hypothesis using a well-characterized mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR). We found that FABP4 was not expressed in retinal vessels, but was present in resident macrophages/microglial cells and endothelial cells of the hyaloid vasculature in the immature retina. While FABP4 expression was not required for normal development of retinal vessels, FABP4 expression was upregulated and localized to neovascular tufts in OIR. FABP4-/- mice demonstrated a significant decrease in neovessel formation as well as a significant improvement in physiological revascularization of the avascular retinal tissues. These alterations in retinal vasculature were accompanied by reduced endothelial cell proliferation, but no effect on apoptosis or macrophage/microglia recruitment. FABP4-/- OIR samples demonstrated decreased expression of genes involved in angiogenesis, such as Placental Growth Factor, and angiopoietin 2. Collectively, our findings suggest FABP4 as a potential target of pathologic retinal angiogenesis in proliferative retinopathies."
https://openalex.org/W2084880363,"Polyreactive antibodies play an important role for neutralization of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In addition to intrinsic polyreactive antibodies, the immune system of healthy individuals contains antibodies with cryptic polyreactivity. These antibodies acquire promiscuous antigen binding potential post-translationally, after exposure to various redox-active substances such as reactive oxygen species, iron ions, and heme. Here, we characterized the interaction of a prototypic human antibody that acquires binding potential to glycoprotein (gp) 120 after exposure to heme. The kinetic and thermodynamic analyses of interaction of the polyreactive antibody with distinct clades of gp120 demonstrated that the antigen-binding promiscuity of the antibody compensates for the molecular heterogeneity of the target antigen. Thus, the polyreactive antibody recognized divergent gp120 clades with similar values of the binding kinetics and quantitatively identical changes in the activation thermodynamic parameters. Moreover, this antibody utilized the same type of noncovalent forces for formation of complexes with gp120. In contrast, HIV-1-neutralizing antibodies isolated from HIV-1-infected individuals, F425 B4a1 and b12, demonstrated different binding behavior upon interaction with distinct variants of gp120. This study contributes to a better understanding of the physiological role and binding mechanism of antibodies with cryptic polyreactivity. Moreover, this study might be of relevance for understanding the basic aspects of HIV-1 interaction with human antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W1975953433,"Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), because of their unique specificity, are irreplaceable tools for scientific research. Precise mapping of the antigenic determinants allows the development of epitope tagging approaches to be used with recombinant proteins for several purposes. Here we describe a new family of tags derived from the epitope recognized by a single highly specific mAb (anti-roTag mAb), which was obtained from a pool of mAbs reacting with the rotavirus nonstructural protein 5 (NSP5). The variable regions of the anti-roTag mAb were identified and their binding capacity verified upon expression as a single-chain/miniAb. The minimal epitope, termed roTag, was identified as a 10 amino acid sequence (SISSSIFKNE). The affinity of the anti-roTag/roTag interaction was found to be comparable to that of the anti-SV5/SV5 tag interaction. roTag was successfully used for detection of several recombinant cytosolic, secretory and membrane proteins. Two additional variants of roTag of 10 and 13 amino acids containing O-glycosylation susceptible sites (termed OG-tag and roTagO) were constructed and characterised. These tags were useful to detect proteins passing through the Golgi apparatus, the site of O-glycosylation."
https://openalex.org/W1999922022,"Background Peribronchiolar fibrosis is an important feature of small airway remodeling (SAR) in cigarette smoke-induced COPD. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of gelatinases (MMP9, MMP2) and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in SAR related to wood smoke (WS) exposure in a rat model. Methods Forty-eight female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into the WS group, the cigarette smoke (CS) group and the clean air control group. After 4 to 7 months of smoke exposure, lung tissues were examined with morphometric measurements, immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. Serum MMP9 and TIMP1 concentrations were detected by ELISA. In vitro, primary rat tracheal epithelial cells were stimulated with wood smoke condensate for 7 days. Results The COPD-like pathological alterations in rats exposed chronically to WS were similar to those exposed to CS; the area of collagen deposition was significantly increased in the small airway walls of those exposed to WS or CS for 7 months. The expression of gelatinases in rats induced by WS or CS exposure was markedly increased in whole lung tissue, and immunohistochemistry showed that MMP9, MMP2 and TIMP1 were primarily expressed in the airway epithelium. The serum levels of MMP9 and TIMP1 were significantly higher in rats secondary to WS or CS exposure. Few cells that double immunostained for E-cadherin and vimentin were observed in the airway subepithelium of rats exposed to WS for 7 months (only 3 of these 8 rats). In vitro, the expression of MMP9 and MMP2 proteins was upregulated in primary rat tracheal epithelial cells following exposure to wood smoke condensate for 7 days by Western blotting; positive immunofluorescent staining for vimentin and type I collagen was also observed. Conclusions These findings suggest that the upregulation of gelatinases and EMT might play a role in SAR in COPD associated with chronic exposure to wood smoke."
https://openalex.org/W2046254877,"The immune response to viral infection is regulated by an intricate network of many genes and their products. The reverse engineering of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) using mathematical models from time course gene expression data collected after influenza infection is key to our understanding of the mechanisms involved in controlling influenza infection within a host. A five-step pipeline: detection of temporally differentially expressed genes, clustering genes into co-expressed modules, identification of network structure, parameter estimate refinement, and functional enrichment analysis, is developed for reconstructing high-dimensional dynamic GRNs from genome-wide time course gene expression data. Applying the pipeline to the time course gene expression data from influenza-infected mouse lungs, we have identified 20 distinct temporal expression patterns in the differentially expressed genes and constructed a module-based dynamic network using a linear ODE model. Both intra-module and inter-module annotations and regulatory relationships of our inferred network show some interesting findings and are highly consistent with existing knowledge about the immune response in mice after influenza infection. The proposed method is a computationally efficient, data-driven pipeline bridging experimental data, mathematical modeling, and statistical analysis. The application to the influenza infection data elucidates the potentials of our pipeline in providing valuable insights into systematic modeling of complicated biological processes."
https://openalex.org/W2078559065,"Objective Individual differences in the temperamental dimension of effortful control are constitutionally based and have been associated with an adverse prenatal developmental environment, with structural brain alterations presenting a potential mechanism. We investigated this hypothesis for anatomically defined brain regions implicated in cognitive and inhibitory motor control. Methods Twenty-seven 15–16 year old participants with low, medium, or high fetal growth were selected from a longitudinal birth cohort to maximize variation and represent the full normal spectrum of fetal growth. Outcome measures were parent ratings of attention and inhibitory control, thickness and surface area of the orbitofrontal cortex (lateral (LOFC) and medial (MOFC)) and right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG), and volumetric measures of the striatum and amygdala. Results Lower birth weight was associated with lower inhibitory control, smaller surface area of LOFC, MOFC and rIFG, lower caudate volume, and thicker MOFC. A mediation model found a significant indirect effect of birth weight on inhibitory control via caudate volume. Conclusions Our findings support a neuroanatomical mechanism underlying potential long-term consequences of an adverse fetal developmental environment for behavioral inhibitory control in adolescence and have implications for understanding putative prenatal developmental origins of externalizing behavioral problems and self-control."
https://openalex.org/W1997535729,"Stem cells with enhanced resistance to oxidative stress after in vitro expansion have been shown to have improved engraftment and regenerative capacities. Such cells can be generated by preconditioning them with exposure to an antioxidant. In this study we evaluated the effects of Tualang honey (TH), an antioxidant-containing honey, on human corneal epithelial progenitor (HCEP) cells in culture. Cytotoxicity, gene expression, migration, and cellular resistance to oxidative stress were evaluated. Immunofluorescence staining revealed that HCEP cells were holoclonal and expressed epithelial stem cell marker p63 without corneal cytokeratin 3. Cell viability remained unchanged after cells were cultured with 0.004, 0.04, and 0.4% TH in the medium, but it was significantly reduced when the concentration was increased to 3.33%. Cell migration, tested using scratch migration assay, was significantly enhanced when cells were cultured with TH at 0.04% and 0.4%. We also found that TH has hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) scavenging ability, although a trace level of H2O2 was detected in the honey in its native form. Preconditioning HCEP cells with 0.4% TH for 48 h showed better survival following H2O2-induced oxidative stress at 50 µM than untreated group, with a significantly lower number of dead cells (15.3±0.4%) were observed compared to the untreated population (20.5±0.9%, p<0.01). Both TH and ascorbic acid improved HCEP viability following induction of 100 µM H2O2, but the benefit was greater with TH treatment than with ascorbic acid. However, no significant advantage was demonstrated using 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furancarboxaldehyde, a compound that was found abundant in TH using GC/MS analysis. This suggests that the cellular anti-oxidative capacity in HCEP cells was augmented by native TH and was attributed to its antioxidant properties. In conclusion, TH possesses antioxidant properties and can improve cell migration and cellular resistance to oxidative stress in HCEP cells in vitro."

To develop pan-HPV vaccines, here, we show that the fusion protein E3R4 consisting of three repeats of HPV16 L2 aa 17–36 epitope (E3) and a modified human IgG1 Fc scaffold (R4) induces cross-neutralizing antibodies and protective immunity against divergent HPV types. E3R4 was expressed as a secreted protein in baculovirus expression system and could be simply purified by one step Protein A affinity chromatography with the purity above 90%. Vaccination of E3R4 formulated with Freunds adjuvant not only induced cross-neutralizing antibodies against HPV pseudovirus types 16, 18, 45, 52, 58, 6, 11 and 5 in mice, but also protected mice against vaginal challenges with HPV pseudovirus types 16, 45, 52, 58, 11 and 5 for at least eleven months after the first immunization. Moreover, vaccination of E3R4 formulated with FDA approved adjuvant alum plus monophosphoryl lipid A also induced cross-neutralizing antibodies against HPV types 16, 18 and 6 in rabbits. Thus, our results demonstrate that delivery of L2 antigen as a modified Fc-fusion protein may facilitate pan-HPV vaccine development."
https://openalex.org/W1986383761,"This analysis explores the association between elements of surgical efficiency in voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC), quality of surgical technique, and the amount of time required to conduct VMMC procedures in actual field settings. Efficiency outcomes are defined in terms of the primary provider's time with the client (PPTC) and total elapsed operating time (TEOT).Two serial cross-sectional surveys of VMMC sites were conducted in Kenya, Republic of South Africa, Tanzania and Zimbabwe in 2011 and 2012. Trained clinicians observed quality of surgical technique and timed 9 steps in the VMMC procedure. Four elements of efficiency (task-shifting, task-sharing [of suturing], rotation among multiple surgical beds, and use of electrocautery) and quality of surgical technique were assessed as explanatory variables. Mann Whitney and Kruskal Wallis tests were used in the bivariate analysis and linear regression models for the multivariate analyses to test the relationship between these five explanatory variables and two outcomes: PPTC and TEOT. The VMMC procedure TEOT and PPTC averaged 23-25 minutes and 6-15 minutes, respectively, across the four countries and two years. The data showed time savings from task-sharing in suturing and use of electrocautery in South Africa and Zimbabwe (where task-shifting is not authorized). After adjusting for confounders, results demonstrated that having a secondary provider complete suturing and use of electrocautery reduced PPTC. Factors related to TEOT varied by country and year, but task-sharing of suturing and/or electrocautery were significant in two countries. Quality of surgical technique was not significantly related to PPTC or TEOT, except for South Africa in 2012 where higher quality was associated with lower TEOT.SYMMACS data confirm the efficiency benefits of task-sharing of suturing and use of electrocautery for decreasing TEOT. Reduced TEOT and PPTC in high volume setting did not result in decreased quality of surgical care."
https://openalex.org/W2033954284,"Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) can be transmitted through congenital infection, leading to persistent infection of numerous organ systems including the central nervous system (CNS). Adult mice persistently infected with LCMV (LCMV-cgPi mice) exhibit learning deficits, such as poor performance in spatial discrimination tests. Given that deficits in spatial learning have been linked to defects in adult neurogenesis, we investigated the impact of congenital LCMV infection on generation of neuroblasts from neural progenitor cells within neurogenic zones of adult mice. In LCMV-cgPi mice, QPCR and immunohistochemistry detected presence of LCMV glycoprotein-coding RNA and nucleoprotein in the hippocampal dentate gyrus and subventricular zone (SVZ), sites of neurogenesis that harbor populations of neuroblasts. Numbers of neuroblasts were reduced in LCMV-cgPi mice, as determined by IHC quantification, and analysis of BrdU incorporation by flow cytometry revealed lower numbers of BrdU-labeled neuroblasts. Additionally, TUNEL assays performed in situ showed increased numbers of apoptotic cells in the two neurogenic regions. Next, neurosphere cultures were infected in vitro with LCMV and differentiated to create a population of cells that consisted of both transit amplifying cells and neuroblasts. Immunocytochemical and TUNEL assays revealed increased numbers of TUNEL-positive cells that express nestin, suggesting that the drop in numbers of neuroblasts was due to a combination of impaired proliferation and apoptosis of progenitor cells. LCMV-cgPi mice exhibited transcriptional up-regulation several cytokines and chemokines, including gamma-interferon inducible chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10. Chronic up-regulation of these chemokines can facilitate a pro-inflammatory niche that may contribute to defects in neurogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1986255072,"Studies of men who have sex with men (MSM) in diverse geographic and cultural contexts have identified health challenges affecting this population. MSM might be particularly vulnerable to sexual victimization and forced sex. The aim of this research study was to examine prevalence of sexual victimization and correlates of forced sex among Japanese MSM. We recruited a sample of 5,731 Japanese MSM who completed an internet-administered survey. Participants reported on history of different types of sexual victimization, unprotected anal sex, other health risk behaviors, exposure to gay-related teasing and bullying, depression, and suicidality. Over one-fifth of the sample (21.4%) reported experiencing at least one form of sexual victimization, and 8.7% reported a history of forced sex. MSM who had ever experienced forced sex were significantly more likely to report experiencing psychological risks (depression OR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.28–1.89; attempted suicide OR = 2.25, 95% CI = 1.81–2.81; other forms of bullying OR = 1.38, 95% CI = 1.13–1.68) and other behavioral risks (unprotected anal sex OR = 1.56, 95% CI = 1.29–1.90; sex venue attendance OR = 1.27, 95% CI = 1.04–1.54; methamphetamine use OR = 1.57, 95% CI = 1.05–1.36), compared to MSM who had not experienced forced sex. Efforts to develop holistic and integrated health services for Japanese MSM are warranted, particularly related to psychosocial determinants of HIV prevention. However, due to cultural factors that emphasize familial and social relations and that stigmatize same-sex behavior, Japanese MSM might experience challenges to seeking social support and health services. Interventions must be provided in safe and non-judgmental settings where Japanese MSM feel comfortable disclosing their health and social support needs."
https://openalex.org/W1993353128,"Human resource capacity is vital to the scale-up of voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) services. VMMC providers are at risk of ""burnout"" from performing a single task repeatedly in a high volume work environment that produces long work hours and intense work effort.The Systematic Monitoring of the Voluntary Medical Male Circumcision Scale-up (SYMMACS) surveyed VMMC providers in Kenya, South Africa, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe in 2011 (n = 357) and 2012 (n = 591). Providers self-reported on their training, work experience, levels of job-fulfillment and work fatigue/burnout. Data analysis included a descriptive analysis of VMMC provider characteristics, and both bivariate and multivariate analyses of factors associated with provider work fatigue/burnout. In 2012, Kenyan providers had worked in VMMC for a median of 31 months compared to South Africa (10 months), Tanzania (15 months), and Zimbabwe (11 months). More than three-quarters (78 - 99%) of providers in all countries in 2012 reported that VMMC is a personally fulfilling job. However, 67% of Kenyan providers reported starting to experience work fatigue/burnout compared to South Africa (33%), Zimbabwe (17%), and Tanzania (15%). Despite the high level of work fatigue/burnout in Kenya, none of the measured factors (i.e., gender, age, full-time versus part-time status, length of service, number of operations performed, or cadre) were significantly associated with work fatigue/burnout in 2011. In 2012, logistic regression found increases in age (p<.05) and number of months working in VMMC (p<.01) were associated with an increased likelihood of experiencing work fatigue/burnout, while higher career total VMMCs decreased the likelihood of experiencing burnout.Given cross-country differences, further elucidation of cultural and other contextual factors that may influence provider burnout is required. Continuing to emphasize the contribution that providers make in the fight against HIV/AIDS is important."
https://openalex.org/W2003831135,"H1 linker histone proteins are essential for the structural and functional integrity of chromatin and for the fidelity of additional epigenetic modifications. Deletion of H1c, H1d and H1e in mice leads to embryonic lethality by mid-gestation with a broad spectrum of developmental alterations. To elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying H1 linker histone developmental functions, we analyzed embryonic stem cells (ESCs) depleted of H1c, H1d and H1e subtypes (H1-KO ESCs) by utilizing established ESC differentiation paradigms. Our study revealed that although H1-KO ESCs continued to express core pluripotency genes and the embryonic stem cell markers, alkaline phosphatase and SSEA1, they exhibited enhanced cell death during embryoid body formation and during specification of mesendoderm and neuroectoderm. In addition, we demonstrated deregulation in the developmental programs of cardiomyocyte, hepatic and pancreatic lineage elaboration. Moreover, ectopic neurogenesis and cardiomyogenesis occurred during endoderm-derived pancreatic but not hepatic differentiation. Furthermore, neural differentiation paradigms revealed selective impairments in the specification and maturation of glutamatergic and dopaminergic neurons with accelerated maturation of glial lineages. These impairments were associated with deregulation in the expression profiles of pro-neural genes in dorsal and ventral forebrain-derived neural stem cell species. Taken together, these experimental observations suggest that H1 linker histone proteins are critical for the specification, maturation and fidelity of organ-specific cellular lineages derived from the three cardinal germ layers."
https://openalex.org/W1989164144,"Monitoring protein phosphorylation at the cellular level is important to understand the intracellular signaling. Among the phosphoproteomics methods, phosphokinase antibody arrays have emerged as preferred tools to measure well-characterized phosphorylation in the intracellular signaling. Here, we present a dendron-coated phosphokinase antibody array (DPA) in which the antibodies are immobilized on a dendron-coated glass slide. Self-assembly of conically shaped dendrons well-controlled in size and structure resulted in precisely controlled lateral spacing between the immobilized phosphosite-specific antibodies, leading to minimized steric hindrance and improved antigen-antibody binding kinetics. These features increased sensitivity, selectivity, and reproducibility in measured amounts of protein phosphorylation. To demonstrate the utility of the DPA, we generated the phosphorylation profiles of brain tissue samples obtained from Alzheimer's disease (AD) model mice. The analysis of the profiles revealed signaling pathways deregulated during the course of AD progression."

Materials and Methods Eighteen pigs underwent 4 weeks ligation of 1 or 2 diagonal coronary arteries to induce chronic infarction. The hearts were then removed and perfused in a Langendorff apparatus. The hearts firstly experienced phosphorus 31 MR spectroscopy. The hearts in group I (n = 9) and II (n = 9) then received the bolus injection of Gadolinium diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (0.05 mmol/kg) and gadolinium-based macromolecular agent (P792, 15 µmol/kg), respectively. First pass T2* MRI was acquired using a gradient echo sequence. Delayed enhanced T1 MRI was acquired with an inversion recovery sequence. Masson's trichrome and anti- von Willebrand Factor (vWF) staining were performed for infarct characterization. Results Wash-in of both kinds of CA caused the sharp and dramatic T2* signal decrease of scarred myocardium similar to that of normal myocardium. Myocardial blood flow and microvessel density were significantly recovered in 4-week-old scar tissue. Steady state distribution volume (ΔR1 relaxation rate) of Gd-DTPA was markedly higher in scarred myocardium than in normal myocardium, whereas ΔR1 relaxation rate of P792 did not differ significantly between scarred and normal myocardium. The ratio of extracellular volume to the total water volume was significantly greater in scarred myocardium than in normal myocardium. Scarred myocardium contained massive residual capillaries and dilated vessels. Histological stains indicated the extensively discrete matrix deposition and lack of cellular structure in scarred myocardium. Conclusions Collateral circulation formation and residual vessel effectively delivered CA into scarred myocardium. However, residual vessel without abnormal hyperpermeability allowed Gd-DTPA rather than P792 to penetrate into extravascular compartment. Discrete collagen fiber meshwork and loss of cellularity enlarged extracellular space accessible to Gd-DTPA, resulting in the delayed hyper-enhanced scar."

We hypothesized that the level of immune activation (IA) and recovery of lymphocyte populations could influence virologic outcomes after regimen simplification.Thirty-four participants with virologic suppression ≥ 48 weeks on antiretroviral therapy (2 NRTI plus protease inhibitor) were switched to ATV/r alone in the context of the ACTG 5201 clinical trial. Flow cytometric analyses were performed on PBMC isolated from 25 patients with available samples, of which 24 had lymphocyte recovery sufficient for this study. Assessments included enumeration of T-cells (CD4/CD8), natural killer (NK) (CD3+CD56+CD16+) cells and cell-associated markers (HLA-DR, CD's 38/69/94/95/158/279).Eight of the 24 patients had at least one plasma HIV-1 RNA level (VL) >50 copies/mL during the study. NK cell levels below the group median of 7.1% at study entry were associated with development of VL >50 copies/mL following simplification by regression and survival analyses (p = 0.043 and 0.023), with an odds ratio of 10.3 (95% CI: 1.92-55.3). Simplification was associated with transient increases in naïve and CD25+ CD4+ T-cells, and had no impact on IA levels.Lower NK cell levels prior to regimen simplification were predictive of virologic rebound after discontinuation of nucleoside analogs. Regimen simplification did not have a sustained impact on markers of IA or T lymphocyte populations in 48 weeks of clinical monitoring.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00084019."

Screening tools predicting pregnancy risk could maximize trial safety and efficiency.We assessed incidence and correlates of pregnancy among women at high HIV risk.We enrolled sexually-active, HIV-negative women into an observational cohort (2008-2011). At enrollment demographic, contraceptive, reproductive, pregnancy intention and behavioural data were collected. Women reported if one or both partners wanted or intended for the couple to become pregnant. We measured gender role beliefs using a locally validated eight-point index. We tested HIV and pregnancy, and inquired about sexually transmitted infection symptoms (STIs) at enrollment and monthly. HIV testing included behavioural counselling and condom provision, but did not specifically counsel women to avoid pregnancy. Cox proportional hazard modelling evaluated the associations with pregnancy. The multivariate model included the following variables ""Recent pregnancy attempts"", ""Gender Roles Beliefs"", ""Self-reported STIs"" and ""Age"".We screened 1068 women and excluded (24.6%, 263/1068) who did not report risk behaviour. Non-pregnant, non-sterilized women aged 18-35 (median = 21 years) enrolled (n = 438). Most women reported one partner (74.7%) and a prior live birth (84.6%). Median follow-up time was 6 months (range 0.7-15.5). Pregnancy incidence was 25.1 per 100 women-years (n = 57 pregnancies). Conservative beliefs on gender roles (Adjusted Hazard Ratio (aHR) 1.8; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1-2.9), recent pregnancy attempts (aHR 1.9; 95% CI 1.1-3.4) and baseline self-reported STI (aHR 2.5; 95% CI 1.4-4.4) were associated with increased incident pregnancy.
