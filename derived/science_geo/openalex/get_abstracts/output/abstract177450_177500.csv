https://openalex.org/W2079793032,"The endo-lysosomal escape of drug carriers is crucial to enhancing the efficacy of their macromolecular payload, especially the payloads that are susceptible to lysosomal degradation. Current vectors that enable the endo-lysosomal escape of macromolecules such as DNA are limited by their toxicity and by their ability to carry only limited classes of therapeutic agents. In this paper, we report the rapid (<10 min) endo-lysosomal escape of biodegradable nanoparticles (NPs) formulated from the copolymers of poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA). The mechanism of rapid escape is by selective reversal of the surface charge of NPs (from anionic to cationic) in the acidic endo-lysosomal compartment, which causes the NPs to interact with the endo-lysosomal membrane and escape into the cytosol. PLGA NPs are able to deliver a variety of therapeutic agents, including macromolecules such as DNA and low molecular weight drugs such as dexamethasone, intracellularly at a slow rate, which results in a sustained therapeutic effect. PLGA has a number of advantages over other polymers used in drug and gene delivery including biodegradability, biocompatibility, and approval for human use granted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Hence PLGA is well suited for sustained intracellular delivery of macromolecules."

https://openalex.org/W2036479240,"The fundamental unit of eukaryotic chromatin, the nucleosome, consists of genomic DNA wrapped around the conserved histone proteins H3, H2B, H2A and H4, all of which are variously modified at their amino- and carboxy-terminal tails to influence the dynamics of chromatin structure and function -- for example, conjugation of histone H2B with ubiquitin controls the outcome of methylation at a specific lysine residue (Lys 4) on histone H3, which regulates gene silencing in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here we show that ubiquitination of H2B is also necessary for the methylation of Lys 79 in H3, the only modification known to occur away from the histone tails, but that not all methylated lysines in H3 are regulated by this 'trans-histone' pathway because the methylation of Lys 36 in H3 is unaffected. Given that gene silencing is regulated by the methylation of Lys 4 and Lys 79 in histone H3, we suggest that H2B ubiquitination acts as a master switch that controls the site-selective histone methylation patterns responsible for this silencing."
https://openalex.org/W2050175631,"Directed cell migration is critical for tissue morphogenesis and wound healing, but the mechanism of directional control is poorly understood. Here we show that the direction in which cells extend their leading edge can be controlled by constraining cell shape using micrometer-sized extracellular matrix (ECM) islands. When cultured on square ECM islands in the presence of motility factors, cells preferentially extended lamellipodia, filopodia, and microspikes from their corners. Square cells reoriented their stress fibers and focal adhesions so that tractional forces were concentrated in these corner regions. When cell tension was dissipated, lamellipodia extension ceased. Mechanical interactions between cells and ECM that modulate cytoskeletal tension may therefore play a key role in the control of directional cell motility."

https://openalex.org/W2147908439,"Scaling laws that describe complex interactions between organisms and their environment as a function of body size offer exciting potential for synthesis in biology. Home range size, or the area used by individual organisms, is a critical ecological variable that integrates behaviour, physiology and population density and strongly depends on organism size. Here we present a new model of home range-body size scaling based on fractal resource distributions, in which resource encounter rates are a function of body size. The model predicts no universally constant scaling exponent for home range, but defines a possible range of values set by geometric limits to resource density and distribution. The model unifies apparently conflicting earlier results and explains differences in scaling exponents among herbivorous and carnivorous mammals and birds. We apply the model to predict that home range increases with habitat fragmentation, and that the home ranges of larger species should be much more sensitive to habitat fragmentation than those of smaller species."

Here we describe a method useful in detecting subclasses of protein kinase substrates. Although the method is broadly applicable to any protein kinase for which a substrate consensus motif has been identified, we illustrate here the use of antibodies broadly reactive against phosphorylated Ser/Thr-motifs typical of AGC kinase substrates. Phosphopeptide libraries with fixed residues corresponding to consensus motifs RXRXXT*/S* (Akt motif) and S*XR (protein kinase C motif) were used as antigens to generate antibodies that recognize many different phosphoproteins containing the fixed motif. Because most AGC kinase members are phosphorylated and activated by phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1), we used PDK1−/− ES cells to profile potential AGC kinase substrates downstream of PDK1. To identify phosphoproteins detected using the Akt substrate antibody, we characterized the antibody binding specificity to generate a specificity matrix useful in predicting antibody reactivity. Using this approach we predicted and then identified a 30-kDa phosphoprotein detected by both Akt and protein kinase C substrate antibodies as S6 ribosomal protein. Phosphospecific motif antibodies offer a new approach to protein kinase substrate identification that combines immunoreactivity data with protein data base searches based upon antibody specificity.

Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). The development of broadly reactive phosphotyrosine antibodies allowed identification and characterization of many tyrosine kinase substrates involved in growth factor and cytokine signaling (2Frackelton Jr., A.R.

Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 65-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, despite considerable effort, the development of comparable phosphoserine and phosphothreonine specific antibodies has proven much more difficult. Because greater than 90% of protein phosphorylation occurs at serine and threonine residues (6Galski H., De Groot N. Ilan J. Hochberg A.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 761: 284-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), methods to identify and characterize these sites are needed. Site-specific phosphoserine/threonine antibodies have proven useful in monitoring specific signaling events; however, because these reagents can be prepared only after the precise site of phosphorylation have been mapped (7Czernik A.J. Girault J.A. Nairn A.C. Chen J. Snyder G. Kebabian J. Greengard P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 264-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), they are not useful in discovery of new sites.

Early estimates suggest that the human genome encodes ∼400 Ser/Thr protein kinases and that the majority of human proteins may be phosphorylated at multiple sites (>100,000 sites). Currently, fewer than 2,000 sites have been identified, emphasizing the need for high throughput and sensitive methods to identify, characterize, and monitor new sites of protein phosphorylation. Growth and survival signals activate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, which in turn activates protein kinases that contain phospholipid binding domains such as PDK11(12Toker A. Newton A.C.

In response to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and phospholipids, PDK1 phosphorylates and activates AGC protein kinases on sites within their activation loops (13Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 484: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and serves as a useful cell line to identify protein phosphorylation mediated by PDK1-dependent AGC protein kinases. In general, protein phosphorylation occurs at short linear sequence motifs that regulate protein activity, location, and interaction (27Hunter T. Cell. 1997; 88: 333-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar, 28Hunter T. Harvey Lect. 1998; 94: 81-119PubMed Google Scholar, 29Yaffe M.B. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1999; 402: 30-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Consensus motifs phosphorylated by protein kinases can be determined in vitro using oriented peptide libraries (30Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 87: 87-98PubMed Google Scholar,31Songyang Z. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 332: 171-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) or by comparing known in vivo sites of phosphorylation (32Kemp B.E. Pearson R.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 342-346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). Here we use peptide libraries representing phosphorylated Ser/Thr protein kinase consensus motifs to two different AGC kinase subfamilies, Akt and PKC, as immunogens to produce phosphospecific antibodies that react selectively with phosphorylated motifs present in a broad array of AGC protein kinase substrates. To demonstrate that the phospho-motif antibodies could identify downstream substrates, we compared immunoreactivity of PDK1−/− ES cell extracts with wild type ES extracts. Combining one- and two-dimensional immunoblotting analysis using Akt and PKC substrate antibodies together with protein data base searching using epitope specificity matrices, we predicted and subsequently identified a 30-kDa protein detected in wild type but not PDK1−/− ES cells as S6 ribosomal protein. Understanding antibody specificity for phosphorylated motifs offers the possibility of using antibody-to-protein recognition features to scan protein databases to predict sites of antibody interaction. Here we show that antibodies recognizing phosphorylated motifs can serve as valuable proteomic tools, interfacing between immunoreactivity data and genome/proteome databases to identify new targets of protein phosphorylation. All the primary and secondary antibodies used in this study were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). The specificity and characterization of primary antibody are described in the Cell Signaling Technology web site (www.cellsignal.com). Materials used in immunoblotting analysis are from Cell Signaling Technology. Protease-inhibitor mixture tablets are from Calbiochem, and tissue culture reagents are from Invitrogen. All other chemicals were from Sigma and Calbiochem. Polyclonal antibodies to specific phosphorylation sites are produced by immunizing rabbits with a synthetic phosphorylated peptide (KLH (keyhole limpet hemocyanin) coupled) corresponding to residues surrounding phosphorylation sites. Antibodies are then purified by protein A column chromatography on anAmersham Biosciences ÄKTA fast protein liquid chromatograph to isolate the IgG antibody fraction. Affinity chromatography is then performed using peptides coupled to SulfoLink resin from Pierce according to manufacturer. Both phospho-peptide-containing resin and the corresponding non-phospho-peptide resin were prepared. Two rounds of subtractive purification were performed using the non-phospho-peptide resin; protein A eluate was incubated with non-phospho-peptide resin by rotation in a sealed column at room temperature for 1 h to remove antibodies reactive with the non-phospho version of the protein antigen. The column was drained, and the flow-through (containing the desired antibody) was incubated with fresh non-phospho-peptide resin. The flow-through from this second subtractive step was next purified by incubation with phospho-peptide resin. After the phospho-peptide column was washed twice with PBS, phospho-specific antibody (bound to the resin) was eluted with 0.1m glycine, pH 2.7, and pooled fractions were neutralized with 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 9.5 (∼1–2% of the fraction volume). The eluted phospho-specific antibody was then dialyzed overnight in PBS at 4 °C. The antibody against the consensus Akt substrate was raised against the following synthetic peptide antigen CXXXRXRXXT*XXXX, whereX represents a position in the peptide synthesis where a mixture of all 20 amino acids (excluding cysteine) were used, and T* represents phosphothreonine. The synthetic phospho-peptide was conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and injected into rabbits. Once rabbits showed high phospho-specific titers, serum was then purified by protein A chromatography. Phospho-Akt substrate antibody was found to be highly phospho-specific as crude serum, so that a subtraction step on a column containing the non-phospho-peptide was not necessary, and the elution from the protein A column was used directly for affinity chromatography on a phospho-peptide-containing column. To develop antibodies against the consensus conventional PKC substrate motif, the following synthetic degenerate peptide library was constructed CXXX(K/R)(K/R)S*(F/L/V)(K/R)(K/R)XXX, where K/R means lysine or arginine are present at that position in equal moles, F/L/V means phenylalanine, leucine, or valine are present at equal mole amounts, X represents any amino acid except Trp and Cys, and S* is phosphoserine. The synthetic phospho-peptide library was conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and injected into rabbits. Phosphospecific antibodies were purified as described as above. The sequence specificity for polyclonal antibodies made against the consensus Akt substrate motif was determined using the orientated-peptide library approach (29Yaffe M.B. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1999; 402: 30-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 30Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 87: 87-98PubMed Google Scholar, 31Songyang Z. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 332: 171-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The first peptide library was synthesized as AXXXXXXXT*XXXXXXXAKKK, whereX stands for a mixture of 19 amino acids (Cys was omitted). Sequence analysis of this peptide library indicates that it contains all 19 amino acids with less than a 3-fold variation for each amino acid at each degenerate position (data not shown). Phospho-substrate antibodies were bound to protein A beads by incubating 1 mg of affinity-purified antibody with 200 μl of 50% slurry of pre-swelled protein A beads at 4 °C overnight with gentle agitation. The beads were then washed 3 times with 1 ml of PBS with 0.5% of Nonidet P-40 followed by 2 washes with 1 ml of PBS. The beads were transferred to a microspin column (Bio-Rad) and washed 3 times with 1 ml of PBS. 1 mg of peptide library (30 mg/ml) was loaded to the antibody column and incubated at room temperature for 10 min followed by 1.5 h at 4 °C. The antibody column was rapidly washed twice with 1 ml of ice-cold PBS + 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and twice with 1 ml of ice-cold PBS. The bound peptides were eluted with 30% acetic acid at room temperature for 10 min. Peptides were separated from antibody by passing the eluent through a Centricon (10-kDa cut off) twice with 0.4 ml of 30% acetic acid. The solution was lyophilized or evaporated to dryness on a SpeedVac apparatus. The pellet was resuspended in 80 μl of water, 0.5 μl of aliquots were checked by MALDI-TOF to ensure the presence of eluted peptides, and 40-μl aliquots were used for sequencing. We always performed a control experiment simultaneously by performing library screening on protein A beads alone and protein A beads immobilized with another irrelevant antibody, phosphotyrosine antibody, which does not bind the peptide in library. Peptides eluted from the antibody columns were analyzed by automated amino acid sequencing (Applied Biosystems). The abundance of each amino acid at a given cycle in the sequence of the bound peptide mixture was divided by the abundance of the same amino acid in the same cycle of the starting peptide library. These raw preference values were then summed and normalized to the total number of amino acids in the degenerate position. A second peptide library was synthesized as sequence MAXXXRXXT*XGGGAKK, whereX is all 18 amino acids except Cys and Trp, after the first library screening resulted in a strong selection for arginine at −3 position. The same procedure was repeated with the secondary library. ELISA was performed after the standard ELISA protocol (48Perlmann H. Perlmann P. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1994Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 μl of 1 μmsynthetic phospho- and non-phospho-peptides were used to coat each well in 96-well plates. Coating was carried out overnight at 4 °C. Phospho-Akt substrate and phospho-PKC substrate antibodies were used at 1:1000 dilution. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h after the addition of primary antibody. An alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) was used as secondary antibody, andp-nitrophenyl phosphate tablets (Sigma) were used for color development. Absorbance at 405 nm was read on an ELISA plate reader (PerkinElmer Model 1420-018). Generation of PDK1−/− cells was described previously (15Williams M.R. Arthur J.S. Balendran A. van der Kaay J. Poli V. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 439-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). PDK1+/+ and PDK1−/− ES cells were cultured to confluence on 15-cm diameter dishes in KnockOutTMDulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% KnockOutTM SR (Invitrogen), 0.1 mmnonessential amino acids, antibiotics (100 units of penicillin G, 100 mg/ml streptomycin), 2 mml-glutamine, 0.1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1000 units/ml ESGROTM. The cells were then serum-starved for 3 h by incubating in medium minus KnockOutTM SR and ESGROTM. The cells were then pretreated for 1 h with or without 100 μm LY294002 (LY) or 5 μmRo318220. The cells were then left unstimulated or stimulated with either IGF1 (100 ng/ml) or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA, 0.2 μg/ml) for 15 min. The cells were then lysed in 1.0 ml of ice-cold Buffer A and centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 13,000 × g. The supernatants were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until use. Buffer A was 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1% (by mass) Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.27 msucrose, 1 μm microcystinLR, 0.1% (by volume) β-mercaptoethanol, and Complete proteinase inhibitor mixture (1 tablet/50 ml, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). A constitutively active form of Akt was generated using the PCR containing the Akt-coding sequence modified by the addition of the Src myristoylation signal and the hemagglutinin epitope. This form of Akt was subsequently subcloned into a pBABE-Puro retroviral vector, and viral particles were generated by co-transfection of ecotropic packaging into HEK293 cells. The MyrAkt virus was then used to infect exponentially growing NIH 3T3 cells, which then selected with puromycin (1.5 μg/ml). Pools of mock-infected and MyrAkt-infected NIH3T3 cells were starved in serum-free containing medium for 24 h before cell extracts were harvested for immunoblotting. 10 μg of protein lysate in SDS sample buffer (2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 80 mm Tris, pH 6.8,0.15m β-mercaptoethanol, 0.02% bromphenol blue) were subjected to 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were used for two-dimensional immunoblotting. Blots were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5,150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature, incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C, incubated with goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase for 1 h at room temperature, and visualized using the chemiluminescent Western detection kit. Membrane stripping was carried out by incubating membranes in stripping buffer (37.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol at 56 °C for 20 min. Stripped membranes were washed 3× with PBS with Tween followed by immunoblotting. 100 μg of wild type or PDK1−/− cell lysate were incubated with Phospho-(Ser/Thr) Akt substrate antibody overnight at 4 °C and protein A-agarose beads for 2 h. Beads were washed twice with cell lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmEGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer for Western blot analysis. 70 μg of wild type or PDK1−/− ES cells lysate (2 mg/ml) was precipitated by methanol and resuspended in 125 μl of urea lysis buffer (9m urea, 0.25% Triton X-100, 5 mm CHAPS, 2% ampholytes 4–7 or 6–11, 2% β-mercaptoethanol, protease inhibitor mixture, and 0.1 μm calyculin A). The lysate was then used to rehydrate 7-cm IPG strips after the manufacturer's recommendations (Amersham Biosciences). The rehydration process was carried out overnight at room temperature. For the first dimension (isoelectric focus), strips were run at 200 V for 0.01 h followed by 3500 V for 1.30 h and 3500 V for 3.30 h. Strips were then incubated with SDS buffer and subjected to the second dimension on 10% SDS gel at 130 V for 1.5 h. The gel was then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and analyzed by Western bloting as described above. To identify components of the Akt- and PKC-signaling pathways, we prepared antibodies reactive with short linear motifs phosphorylated by the Akt and PKC subfamilies of AGC protein kinases. Fig.1 shows evolutionary relationships between the Akt subfamily, including Akt, p70 S6 kinase, ribosomal S6 kinase, and serum and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase (SGK). These enzymes phosphorylate consensus motifs of the form RXRXX(T*/S*), where X represents any amino acid, R represents Arg (sometimes Lys), and S*/T* represents phosphorylated serine/threonine (24Park J.

The primary sequence around the site of phosphorylation is an important determinant of downstream kinase specificity in vivo (38Songyang Z. Blechner S. Hoagland N. Hoekstra M.F. Piwnica-Worms H.

Phosphopeptide libraries with fixed residues corresponding to consensus Akt motifXXXRXRXXT*XXXand the conventional PKC motifXXXRXS*XRXXXX were used as antigens to generate polyclonal antisera in rabbits. Phosphospecific antibodies were purified from rabbit sera as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and their specificity was characterized as described below. Purified phosphospecific polyclonal antisera prepared against the Akt consensus substrate motif was immobilized on protein A beads and used to select peptides from a synthetic oriented-peptide library, AXXXXXXXT*XXXXXXXAKKK, where X stands for a mixture of 19 amino acids (cystine omitted). Eluted peptides were sequenced, and the relative enrichment of each amino acid at different positions over the applied peptide library is shown in Fig. 2 A. The Akt substrate antibody was strongly selective for arginine at position −3 (see Fig. 2 A). To further determine antibody specificity, a second peptide library was synthesized where arginine at position −3 was fixed MAXXXRXXT*XGGGAKK, and peptides bound to the antibody were eluted and sequenced. The relative preference of each amino acid at different positions relative to the fixed phosphothreonine over the applied peptide library is shown in Fig. 2 B. These data indicate some selection for arginine at positions −6, −5, and −4. The same peptide library with fixed phosphoserine at position 0 was also synthesized, and the relative preference of each amino acid position over the applied peptide library (data not shown) is similar to the phosphothreonine library results shown in Fig. 2. In contrast, when phosphotyrosine antibody was used to select peptides from the same peptide libraries, no peptides were present in eluent from antibody as determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (data not shown). Epitope mapping of the Akt consensus substrate motif antibody was further determined by ELISA analysis together with arrays of synthetic phospho- and non-phospho-peptides. ELISA reactivities relative to phospho-GSK3 peptide are shown in TableI. Non-phospho-control peptides normally score in the range of 3–5% of phospho-GSK3. Akt consensus substrate motif antibody bound only to phospho-peptides. For phosphothreonine-containing peptides, arginine at position −3 is required, although lysine can substitute for arginine with weaker binding. For phosphoserine-containing peptides, arginine appears to be required at position −3 and at position −5 or −2. Good antibody binding was associated with hydrophobic amino acids at position +1, small non-charged residues at position −1, and either small residues or arginine/lysine at position −2.Table ISpecificity of Akt substrate antibody as analyzed using various phospho- and nonphospho-peptides containing different versions of the consensus Akt substrate motif as determined by ELISA Open table in a new tab ELISA analysis of synthetic peptides was also used to determine the binding specificity of the PKC substrate motif antibody. ELISA readings for each peptide are presented in TableII as a percentage relative to phospho-AFX peptide. The data indicate that this antibody binds only phosphoserine-containing peptides, where phosphoserine is followed by arginine or lysine at position +2. In addition, the antibody appears selective for hydrophobic amino acids at position +1.Table IISpecificity of PKC substrate antibody to consensus PKC substrate motif containing peptides determined by ELISA Open table in a new tab Because the phospho-Akt and -PKC substrate antibodies appeared to be generally reactive with Akt and PKC substrates, we next tested their reactivity with cell extracts. NIH3T3 cell extracts prepared 15 min after platelet-derived growth factor treatment showed an increase in immunoreactive proteins when analyzed by Western blotting using the Akt substrate antibody (Fig.3 A). Antibody reactivity to a subset of proteins was diminished or lost upon treatment with the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor, LY 294002 (Fig.3 A). Analysis with phospho-specific antibodies to Akt Ser-473 and Thr-308 indicated elevated Akt phosphorylation in the same extracts (data not shown). Similar Western analysis was carried out using the PKC substrate antibody and WEHI231 and Jurkat cells treated with TPA, an activator of PKC. TPA treatment stimulated antibody reactivity to a number of different proteins (Fig. 3 B).

RT-PCR analysis and immunological methods demonstrate that human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) express the NGF receptors trkA(NGFR) and p75NTR. NGF treatment caused a rapid phosphorylation of trkA(NGFR) in HUVECs, determining a parallel increase of phosphorylated ERK1/2. Accordingly, NGF induced a significant increase in HUVEC proliferation that was abolished by the trkA(NGFR) inhibitor K252a. Also, HUVECs express significant levels of NGF under standard culture conditions that were up-regulated during serum starvation. Endogenous NGF was responsible for the basal levels of trkA(NGFR) and ERK1/2 phosphorylation observed in untreated HUVEC cultures. Finally, NGF exerted a potent, direct, angiogenic activity in vivo when delivered onto the chorioallantoic membrane of the chicken embryo. The data indicate that NGF may play an important role in blood vessel formation in the nervous system and in several pathological processes, including tumors and inflammatory diseases. Unraveling mechanisms of NGF-dependent angiogenesis could provide valuable tools for novel therapeutic approaches in antiangiogenic therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2153801209,"The reasons why tumor cells metastasize to bone remain obscure. There is some evidence to support the theory that integrins (acting as cell surface adhesion receptors) play a role in mediating metastasis in certain organs. Here, we report that overexpression of a functionally active integrin alpha(v)b3 in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) tumor cells drastically increased the incidence, number, and area of bone metastases in nude mice compared with those observed in mock-transfected CHO cells (CHO dhfr+) or in CHO cells expressing a functionally inactive integrin alpha(v)b3 (CHO beta3Delta744). Moreover, a breast cancer cell line (B02) established from bone metastases caused by MDA-MB-231 cells constitutively overexpressed integrin alpha(v)b3, whereas the cell surface expression level of other integrins remained unchanged. In vivo, the extent of bone metastases in B02-bearing mice was significantly increased compared with that of MDA-MB-231-bearing mice. In vitro, B02 cells and CHO cells expressing a functionally active integrin alpha(v)b3 exhibited substantially increased invasion of and adhesion to mineralized bone, bone sialoprotein, and collagen compared with those found with MDA-MB-231, CHO dhfr+, and CHO beta3Delta744 cells, respectively. Overall, our findings suggest that integrin alpha(v)b3 expression in tumor cells accelerates the development of osteolytic lesions, presumably through increased invasion of and adhesion to bone."

Histopathological examination showed centrilobular hepatic necrosis with leukocyte infiltration and a large number of apoptotic hepatocytes 10 and 24 h after APAP challenge. mRNA expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, interleukin (IL) 1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP) 1alpha, MIP-2, KC, IP-10, Mig, Fas, and inducible nitric oxide synthase was enhanced in the liver of wild-type mice injected with APAP. To clarify the role of IFN-gamma in this process, IFN-gamma-deficient mice were treated in the same manner. All IFN-gamma-deficient mice survived with reduced serum transaminase elevation and attenuated hepatic necrosis, leukocyte infiltration, and hepatocyte apoptosis. The gene expression of all molecules was significantly attenuated in IFN-gamma-deficient mice. Administration of an anti-IFN-gamma neutralizing antibody even 2 or 8 h after APAP challenge to wild-type mice alleviated APAP-induced liver injury, and all mice survived. Thus, IFN-gamma is responsible for APAP-induced liver injury by mediating leukocyte infiltration, hepatocyte apoptosis, and NO production as well as cytokine and chemokine production. Moreover, immunoneutralization of IFN-gamma may be therapeutically effective for developing APAP-induced liver injury."

https://openalex.org/W2063612133,"The hypocholesterolemic effect of plant stanols is explained by a decreased intestinal cholesterol absorption due to a competition between plant stanols and cholesterol for incorporation into mixed micelles. Earlier we had suggested that plant stanols have a so far unknown action inside the enterocytes. The recent discovery of the involvement of ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters in cholesterol absorption was a lead to further explore the hypocholesterolemic mechanism of plant stanols. We found that mixed micelles enriched with sitostanol or with cholesterol plus sitostanol were potent inducers of ABCA1 expression in caco-2 cells, an accepted model to study human intestinal lipoprotein metabolism. Based on these findings, we now hypothesize that plant stanols--and possibly plant sterols--increase ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux back into the intestinal lumen. We further hypothesize that intracellular levels of plant stanols are monitored by the same sensors (SREBP-2 and LXR) as those that monitor cholesterol. Consequently, increased plant stanol levels within the enterocyte activate cholesterol efflux through ABCA1- but not SREBP-2-mediated endogenous cholesterol synthesis even if intracellular cholesterol concentrations are lowered through consumption of plant stanols. If our hypothesis is correct, then the LXR pathway may be a target for dietary regulation of intestinal lipid metabolism."

In human cells, telomerase activity is tightly regulated by the expression of its catalytic subunit, human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT). In most normal human somatic cells, hTERT is not expressed, and its suppression acts as an important gatekeeper against tumorigenesis. Here we describe the systematic analyses of hTERT promoter to understand the transcriptional repression mechanism of the hTERT gene in normal human somatic cells. Through the serial deletion analysis of hTERT promoter in normal human fibroblasts, we identified a critical repressive element on the hTERT promoter. The repressive element formed DNA-protein complexes with Sp1 and Sp3 in nuclear extracts. Using formaldehyde cross-linked chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, we found that Sp1 and Sp3 were associated with the endogenously repressed hTERT promoter in human fibroblasts. Furthermore, Sp1 and Sp3 interacted with histone deacetylase (HDAC) in these cells. Overexpression of dominant-negative mutants of Sp1 and Sp3, which contained mainly the HDAC2-binding domain, relieved the HDAC-mediated repression of the hTERT promoter. Taken together, these results suggest that Sp1 and Sp3 associate with the hTERT promoter, recruiting HDAC for the localized deacetylation of nucleosomal histones and transcriptional silencing of the hTERT gene in normal human somatic cells.

By catalyzing the addition of telomeric TTAGGG repeats onto the chromosome ends, telomerase stabilizes the telomere, and thus maintains the stability and integrity of linear chromosomes. In contrast, most normal human somatic cells lack the mechanisms to maintain telomeric DNA, and the progressive loss of telomeres during DNA replication limits the life span of these cells both in vivo and in vitro(4Chiu C.P.

Furthermore, abrogation of the telomerase activity in tumor cells has been reported to induce cell growth arrest and apoptosis (7Zhang X. Mar V. Zhou W. Harrington L. Robinson M.O. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2388-2399Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Human telomerase is a complex composed of an RNA component that provides the template for the addition of new telomeric repeats, a catalytic subunit known as human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT),1 and some additional associated proteins (8Feng J. Funk W.D. Wang S.S. Weinrich S.L. Avilion A.A. Chiu C.P. Adams R.R. Chang E. Allsopp R.C., Yu, J., Le, S. West M.D. Harley C.B. Andrews W.H. Greider C.W. Villeponteau B.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3109-3115Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). The RNA component of human telomerase is expressed constitutively in most human tissues, whereas hTERT is not expressed in most normal human somatic tissues. Thus, in normal human somatic cells, telomerase activity is tightly regulated by the repression of the hTERT gene. In tumor cells, telomerase activity is closely correlated with the expression and derepression of hTERT. These findings indicate that derepression of the hTERT promoter might be an important mechanism leading to activation of the hTERT gene and telomerase enzyme in the cells during tumorigenesis. Although hTERT gene expression has been well established as essential for the progression and maintenance of the human tumors, its activation/derepression mechanism in the course of tumorigenesis is not well understood. In the course of tumorigenesis many mutations occur, and some of these mutations are thought to contribute to the activation and derepression of hTERT. Several studies including ours have shown that one of the oncogenes deregulated in various human tumors,c-myc, can contribute to the transcriptional activation of the hTERT gene in tumor cells (11Horikawa I. Cable P.L. Afshari C. Barrett J.C. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 826-830PubMed Google Scholar, 12Oh S. Song Y.H. Kim U.J. Yim J. Kim T.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Genet. 1999; 21: 220-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). In addition, amplification of the hTERT locus observed in some human tumors probably contributes to the misregulation of hTERT gene expression (14Zhang A. Zheng C. Lindvall C. Hou M. Ekedahl J. Lewensohn R. Yan Z. Yang X. Henriksson M. Blennow E. Nordenskjold M. Zetterberg A. Bjorkholm M. Gruber A. Xu D. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6230-6235PubMed Google Scholar). Genetic complementation approaches have suggested that the hTERT repression mechanism is dominant over the activation/derepression mechanism (15Ishii Y. Tsuyama N. Maeda S. Tahara H. Ide T. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1999; 110: 175-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 16Sedivy J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9078-9081Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 17Shay J.W. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1999; 91: 4-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Furthermore, hTERT expression in normal human somatic cells is tightly repressed even below the limit of detection by PCR. Thus, it is critical to understand the transcriptional repression mechanism of the hTERT gene in normal human somatic cells. Some of the transcriptional repressors of the hTERT gene have been identified, including WT1 and Mad from our studies (18Fujimoto K. Kyo S. Takakura M. Kanaya T. Kitagawa Y. Itoh H. Takahashi M. Inoue M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2557-2562Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 19Oh S. Song Y.H. Yim J. Kim T.K.

The understanding of the general mechanism of transcriptional repression of the hTERT gene in normal cells is still limited. Experiments in a wide variety of normal human somatic cells with trichostatin A (TSA), an inhibitor of histone deacetylase (HDAC), suggest that histone deacetylation is essential to the transcriptional repression mechanism of the hTERT gene (22Cong Y-S. Bacchetti S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35665-35668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 23Takakura M. Kyo S. Sowa Y. Wang Z. Yatabe N. Maida Y. Tanaka M. Inoue M.

A. 2001; 98: 3826-3831Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In addition, TSA treatment has been shown to significantly up-regulate hTERT promoter activity and the corresponding telomerase activity to a level comparable with that in human tumor cells. Thus, HDAC-mediated repression could be the major, universal transcriptional repression mechanism of the hTERT gene in normal human somatic cells. In this study, we carried out systematic analyses of hTERT promoter to identify such repressive DNA elements and interacting regulatory factors. Through a serial deletion analysis of the hTERT promoter in cultured human fibroblasts, we identified a TSA-responsive repressive element. This element formed complexes with Sp1 and Sp3 proteins in nuclear extracts derived from normal human somatic cells. Moreover, the endogenous hTERT promoter in the cells was found to be tightly associated with Sp1 and Sp3. Sp1 and Sp3 were found to have the intrinsic ability to interact with HDAC, and through this interaction HDAC is recruited onto the hTERT promoter. Thus, we show that Sp1 and Sp3 are involved in the HDAC-mediated transcriptional repression of the hTERT gene in normal human somatic cells. IMR90 (normal human lung fibroblast), WI38 (normal human lung fibroblast), and HFF (normal human foreskin fibroblast) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 120 μg/ml penicillin, and 200 μg/ml streptomycin. Transfection was carried out with LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen). Luciferase assays were performed 30–48 h after transfection using the reagents from Promega according to the manufacturer's instructions. TSA (Sigma) was dissolved in Me2SO and added to the culture medium at a final concentration of 50–200 nm. A corresponding volume of Me2SO was added to control cells not treated with TSA. Total RNA was isolated with the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. The cDNA synthesis, reverse transcription, and quantitative PCR were performed essentially as previously described (25Ulaner G.A., Hu, J.F., Vu, T.H. Giudice L.C. Hoffman A.R. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4168-4172PubMed Google Scholar). The amplified DNA was separated on 1% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. Nuclear extracts were prepared essentially as previously described (26Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3924) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, cultured cells were collected, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and pelleted by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 3 min. The pellet was resuspended in 5 packed pellet volumes of ice-cold buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and Boehringer Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The cells were allowed to swell on ice for 15 min, after which 13 packed pellet volume of a 10% Nonidet P-40 was added. The tube was vigorously vortexed for 10 s, and the homogenate was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 s. After removal of the supernatant, the nuclear pellet was resuspended in 2 packed pellet volumes of ice-cold buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.4 m NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 25% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and Boehringer Complete protease inhibitor mixture. The tube was vigorously rocked at 4 °C for 30 min on a shaking platform. The nuclear extract was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and the supernatant was frozen in aliquots at −70 °C. Portions of nuclear extract (5 μg) were incubated with 0.5 μg of poly(dI·dC) in the absence or presence of specific antibodies at room temperature for 20 min in a 15-μl reaction volume containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 4 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.54 mm EDTA, 0.6 mmdithiothreitol, and 8% glycerol. Antibodies used for the supershift assay were anti-Sp1 (sc-59, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-Sp3 (07-107, Upstate Biotechnology). Following incubation, the32P-end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe (upper strand sequence: 5′-CCTTCCAGCTCCGCCTCCTCCGCGCGGA-3′) was added and incubated at room temperature for an additional 20 min. These reaction mixtures were subjected to electrophoresis in a 6% polyacrylamide gel in 0.25× TBE buffer, dried, and subjected to autoradiography. X-ChIP assays were performed using the ChIP assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were fixed in normal culture medium with formaldehyde at a final concentration of 1% for 10 min at 37 °C. Sonication was performed to achieve an average DNA length of 500 bp. The following antibodies were used for the immunoprecipitation of the cross-linked chromatin: anti-Mad (65396E, Pharmingen), anti-Sp1 (sc-59, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Sp3 (07-107, Upstate Biotechnology), and anti-HA (71-5500, Zymed Laboratories Inc.). A ∼160-bp fragment in the hTERT proximal promoter was amplified using the primers 5′-TGCCCCTTCACCTTCCAG-3′ and 5′-CAGCGCTGCCTGAAACTC-3′. PCR was carried out as follows: 1 cycle at 94 °C for 3 min; 34 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 53 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 20 s; and 1 cycle at 72 °C for 1 min. The amplified DNA was separated on 2% agarose gel and visualized with ethidium bromide. Co-immunoprecipitation was performed as described (27Doetzlhofer A. Rotheneder H. Lagger G. Koranda M.

Whole cell extracts were prepared by resuspending IMR90 or HFF cells in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 mm sodium fluoride, and Boehringer Complete protease inhibitor mixture, and incubated on ice for 30 min. After centrifugation of the lysates at 16,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, 1 mg of the supernatants (cell extracts) were precleared using 80 μl of protein A-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and incubated with the respective antibody with rotation for 2 h at 4 °C. After addition of 60 μl of protein A-agarose bead suspension (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), the mixture was further incubated with rotation for 4 h at 4 °C. After three washes with extraction buffer, the beads were resuspended in 50 μl of extraction buffer. For immunoprecipitation of the endogenous proteins, anti-Mad (65396E, Pharmingen), anti-Sp1 (sc-59, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-Sp3 (07-107, Upstate Biotechnology) antibodies were used. Anti-HA antibody (71-5500, Zymed Laboratories Inc.) was used as a negative control for the immunoprecipitation of the endogenous proteins. For immunoprecipitation of the HA-tagged proteins, anti-HA antibody (sc-7392, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used. Proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore). The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk and probed with anti-HDAC2 antibody (51-5100, Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Membranes were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (sc-2054, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and visualized using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences).

A series of deletions of the 3396-bp hTERT promoter region was generated from p-3396 by unidirectional 5′-deletion using Erase-a-Base (Promega). pGL3-Promoter-RE was constructed by the insertion of the sequences between −195 to −168 of the hTERT promoter into the upstream of the SV40 promoter in pGL3-Promoter (Promega) using the BamHI/BglII sites in polylinker region. To obtain p-188-Sp-m1, p-188-Sp-m2, p-188-Sp-m3, p-188-Sp-m4, and p-188-Sp-m5, site-directed mutagenesis was performed with p-188 essentially as described (20Oh S. Song Y. Yim J. Kim T.K. J. Biol.

Seiser (27Doetzlhofer A. Rotheneder H. Lagger G. Koranda M. Kurtev V. Brosch G. Wintersberger E. Seiser C. Mol. Cell.

Mizuno T. Nomura H. Sakai T. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4266-4270PubMed Google Scholar). pM-Sp1 contains Sp1 with its N-terminal 82 amino acids deleted (29Sowa Y. Orita T. Minamikawa-Hiranabe S. Mizuno T. Nomura H. Sakai T. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4266-4270PubMed Google Scholar). To prepare pM-Sp1-(83–611), pM-Sp1 was digested withBamHI/BglII, and then three stop codons were inserted. For the construction of HA-Sp1, HA-Sp3, HA-Sp3-(1–398), and HA-Sp3-(399–654), the DNA inserts were obtained by PCR using CMV-Sp1 or CMV-Sp3 as the template, and the resultant products were cloned into the HA tagging plasmid pCIneo-HA. To identify the DNA element within the hTERT promoter critical for its transcriptional repression, we generated a series of 5′-deletion mutant constructs from the 3396-bp hTERT promoter cloned into the firefly luciferase reporter plasmid (Fig.1 A). These constructs were transiently transfected into normal human lung fibroblasts (IMR90), where the expression of the hTERT gene was undetectable and tightly repressed. Subsequently, luciferase assays were performed. Serial deletions from −3396 up to −275 did not affect the hTERT promoter activity (Fig. 1 A). However, further deletion from −274 to −189 caused a slight increase in promoter activity, consistent with our previous report that the E-box within this region acts as the repressive element through interaction with the Mad-Max complex in normal human somatic cells (19Oh S. Song Y.H. Yim J. Kim T.K. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1485-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Interestingly, further deletion from −188 to −180 increased the promoter activity even more significantly. These findings suggest that a repressive regulatory element is within or extends into the region between −188 and −180 of the hTERT promoter. We next investigated whether the abrupt increase in the hTERT promoter activity after deletion of the region from −188 to −180 can be observed in other normal human cells. The deletion constructs p-188 and p-179, which differ only by the “9 base pairs (bp)” between −188 and −180 of the hTERT promoter, were transfected into three different kinds of normal human fibroblasts, and then the promoter activities of the two hTERT promoter constructs were compared (Fig. 1 B). Promoter activity of p-179 was significantly higher than that of p-188 in all of these cells. Thus, it is quite possible that the region of sequence between −188 and −180 may act as a repressive element in many types of normal human cells. Because histone deacetylation has been proposed as one transcriptional repression mechanism for the hTERT gene (22Cong Y-S. Bacchetti S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35665-35668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), we examined whether the identified repressive element might involve this mechanism. To this end, we exploited the effects of TSA, which specifically inhibits histone deacetylases (30Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 423-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). As a preliminary experiment, we treated IMR90 cells with increasing amounts of TSA and examined the changes in the hTERT mRNA levels by quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR with total RNA isolated from these cells 24 h after TSA treatment. TSA at 200 nm resulted in maximal induction of hTERT mRNA without any significant effect on the β-actin mRNA level (Fig.2 A,bottom panels). TSA at concentrations higher than 200 nm did not further increase the hTERT mRNA levels. 2J. Won, J. Yim, and T. K. Kim, unpublished observation. In parallel with this analysis, we transfected the 3396-bp hTERT promoter-firefly luciferase reporter plasmid into IMR90 cells, and these transfected cells were treated with increasing amounts of TSA. Similar to the results for endogenous hTERT mRNA, 200 nm TSA caused the maximal induction of activity from the transfected hTERT promoter (Fig. 2 A, top panel). Next, we assayed the hTERT promoter activities of p-188 and p-179 after transfection into IMR90, WI38, and HFF cells and treatment with TSA (Fig. 2 B). The promoter activities of p-188 in these normal human somatic cells were normalized to compare them with those of p-179 with or without TSA treatment. Interestingly, the promoter activity of p-188 was sharply up-regulated in comparison with that of p-179 after treatment with TSA. In contrast, p-188 had less activity than p-179 in the absence of TSA treatment (compare + and − TSA in Fig.2 B; also see Fig. 1 B). These results suggest that the region between −188 and −180 of the hTERT promoter may be engaged in the HDAC-mediated tight transcriptional repression of the hTERT gene in normal human somatic cells. Given the repressive function of the region between −188 and −180, we investigated whether this region of the hTERT promoter was sufficient to function as a TSA-responsive repressive element within other promoters. To address this, the sequences around the region between −188 and −180 of the hTERT promoter (RE in Fig.2 C) were cloned upstream of the SV40 promoter. Then the activity of the SV40 promoter was measured by firefly luciferase reporter expression in IMR90, WI38, and HFF cells (Fig. 2 C). The promoter activities of pGL3-Promoter in these normal human somatic cells were normalized to compare them with those of pGL3-Promoter-RE in the absence or presence of TSA treatment. In IMR90 cells, this introduced element decreased SV40 promoter activity in the absence of TSA treatment. In WI38 and HFF cells, this element did not significantly down-regulate the SV40 promoter activity. In addition, this isolated element supported the TSA-mediated induction of the SV40 promoter in IMR90 slightly, but not in WI38 and HFF cells. Taken together, these results imply that the repressive function of this element in normal human somatic cells requires the promoter context of the hTERT gene. To identify the nuclear protein(s) binding to the identified repressive element of the hTERT promoter, we performed an EMSA with nuclear extracts from IMR90 and HFF cells probed with the repressive element (Fig. 3). As a preliminary experiment, we performed the competition assays with unlabeled oligonucleotides containing either consensus or mutant-binding sites for Sp1, AP2, Egr, and E2F. Because the DNA sequence within the identified repressive element is GC-rich (see Fig.4 A), it was possible that the putative transcription factors (Sp1, AP2, Egr, and E2F) could interact with the DNA element. We found that the upper three DNA-protein complexes (I,II, and III in Fig. 3) were specifically competed by the oligonucleotides containing consensus binding sequences for Sp1, but not by the oligonucleotides containing the binding sequences for AP2, Egr, or E2F.2 Consistent with these results, when these DNA-protein complexes (I, II, and III) were challenged with anti-Sp1 and anti-Sp3 antibodies, we detected the presence of Sp1 in DNA-protein complexes I and II, and Sp3 in DNA-protein complexes I and III (Fig. 3). Under these conditions, we also found that antibodies against AP2, Egr, E2F1, and other Sp family members (e.g. Sp2 and Sp4) did not affect these specific band-shift patterns.2Figure 4Sp sites within the hTERT promoter function as TSA-responsive repressive elements. A, the sequence of the hTERT proximal promoter showing the locations of the Sp sites. The translation start codon ATG is shown in bold, and the A of the start codon is designated as +1. The positions of −188 and −179 are also denoted. The sequences that were mutated are indicated by asterisks, with the substituted sequences presentedabove. B, mutations in Sp sites1,2, and 5 increased the promoter activity, while decreasing TSA responsiveness. IMR90, WI38, and HFF cells were transfected with the plasmids indicated, and treated with or without 200 nm TSA at 6 h after transfection. After incubation for 24 h, luciferase assays were performed. For each of the 6 groups (3 cell types ± TSA), luciferase activity of p-188 was set at 100, and the relative luciferase activity of each of the mutant constructs is presented. TSA up-regulated the reporter activity of p-188 about 79-, 96-, and 87-fold in IMR90, WI38, and HFF cells, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next investigated any changes in these DNA-protein complexes after treatment with TSA. Nuclear extracts from IMR90 and HFF cells were treated with or without TSA. We then compared band-shift patterns with the radiolabeled probe encompassing the repressive element. No additional band(s) appeared after treatment with TSA (Fig. 3). Furthermore, we failed to detect any significant alteration in the band-shift patterns. Notably, the DNA binding activities of neither Sp1 nor Sp3 changed after TSA treatment. These results imply that the induced DNA binding activities of Sp1 and Sp3 may not be involved in the up-regulation of the hTERT promoter activity after treatment with TSA. Because the TSA-responsive repressive element (−188 to −180) can form complexes with Sp1 and Sp3 in nuclear extracts (Fig. 3), the Sp site within that region was assumed to be responsible for the HDAC-mediated repression of the hTERT promoter. To assess this, we mutated the core sequences of the Sp site within this TSA-responsive repressive element (Sp site 1 in Fig. 4 A; p-188-Sp-m1 in Fig. 4 B). Then we examined whether the mutation produced the same effects (increased promoter activity and decreased TSA-responsiveness) as the deletion of the repressive element. The construct p-188-Sp-m1 showed enhanced promoter activity in comparison with its wild-type counterpart p-188 in all three cell types (Fig. 4 B). This enhancement was similar to that observed by deletion of the repressive element (from −188 to −180) from p-188 in Fig. 1 B. In addition, we investigated the TSA responsiveness of this Sp site by comparing the promoter activities of p-188 and p-188-Sp-m1 in these cells after treatment with TSA. The p-188-Sp-m1 showed less promoter activity in comparison with p-188 after treatment with TSA (Fig. 4 B). Consistently, we found that a mutation in this Sp site produced similar results to those with the p-179 construct, relative to p-188 (compare Fig. 2 Bwith Fig. 4 B). Thus, the Sp site 1 is essential for the TSA-responsive repressive function of the hTERT promoter element between −188 and −180. Based on the importance of the Sp site in the repressive function of our identified element, we examined the possible involvement of other Sp sites within the proximal hTERT promoter. Kyo et al. (31Kyo S. Takakura M. Takahiro T. Kanaya T. Itoh H. Yutsudo M. Ariga H. Inoue M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 669-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar) described the existence of four other Sp sites within the region from −188 to the translation start site of the hTERT promoter (see Fig.4 A). We mutated these remaining four Sp sites within the promoter region of the construct p-188 (Fig. 4 A), and transfected these mutant constructs (p-188-Sp-m2, p-188-Sp-m3, p-188-Sp-m4, and p-188-Sp-m5) into IMR90, WI38, and HFF cells. Mutation of Sp sites 2 and 5, but not Sp sites 3 and 4, increased the promoter activity in these cells, to a similar extent as mutation of the Sp"

These channels provide diffusional intercellular exchange of ions and small molecules, allowing individual cell events to synchronize into functional responses of an entire organ. It is the current view that gap junctions are not passive pores but dynamic filters that regulate traffic of molecular messages in time and space through a variety of intermolecular interactions (see, e.g. Refs. 1Giepmans B.N.

The study of pH-dependent regulation of gap junctions becomes more relevant given that intracellular acidification is a major consequence of tissue ischemia. Acidification-induced uncoupling (also referred to as “pH gating”) has an impact on the preservation of tissue surrounding the ischemic area, both in heart and brain (9Peters N.S. Coromilas J. Severs N.J. Wit A.L. Circulation. 1997; 95: 988-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 10Lin J.H. Weigel H. Cotrina M.L. Liu S. Bueno E. Hansen A.J. Hansen T.W. Goldman S. Nedergaard M. Nat.

Wit A.L. Circulation. 1997; 95: 988-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar).Previous studies showed that pH gating of Cx43 results from the interaction of the carboxyl-terminal domain, acting as a gating particle, with a separate region of the protein affiliated with the pore, acting as the “receptor” (11Morley G.E. Taffet S.M. Delmar M. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1294-1302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). These data led to the suggestion that pH regulation of Cx43 follows a “ball-and-chain” model of gating (11Morley G.E. Taffet S.M. Delmar M. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1294-1302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 12Zagotta W.N. Hoshi T. Aldrich R.W. Science. 1990; 250: 568-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Additional studies showed that the model also applies to Cx43 regulation by insulin, insulin-like growth factor-1, and v-src (13Homma N. Alvarado J.L. Coombs W. Stergiopoulos K. Taffet S.M. Lau A.F. Delmar M. Circ. Res. 1998; 13: 27-32Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 14Zhou L. Kasperek E.M. Nicholson B.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1033-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Yet no conclusive evidence has been presented for a direct intramolecular association between regions of Cx43. Moreover, the location and structure of the receptor for the gating particle remains to be identified.Here we used mirror resonance (MR),1 enzyme-linked sorbent assays (ELSA), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to characterize molecular events associated with chemical regulation of Cx43. We demonstrate pH-dependent binding between two intracellular regions of the molecule: the carboxyl-terminal domain (Cx43CT) and the second half of the cytoplasmic loop (Cx43L2). Furthermore, we show that acidification induces α-helical structure in the Cx43L2 peptide, concurrent with protonation of histidines in the L2 sequence. In contrast, we detected only minor modifications in the structure of Cx43CT as a function of pH. This is the first evidence of organized secondary structure in an intracellular connexin domain consequent to a chemical stimulus and the first demonstration of direct intramolecular binding in a connexin molecule. We hypothesize that this interaction represents part of the structural foundation for the ball-and-chain model of chemical gating. Our data may offer a starting point for the design of molecules that could interfere with the chemical regulation of Cx43 channels.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProduction of Purified Recombinant Cx43CTCloning of the Cx43CT FragmentThe carboxyl-terminal domain of rat Cx43 (rCx43) was cloned, using the polymerase chain reaction, into the bacterial expression vector pGEX-6P-2 (Amersham Biosciences). This vector contains the coding region of glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fused to the cleavage site for human rhinovirus 3C protease (see below). The template was produced as previously described (15Yahuaca P., Ek- Vitorin J.F. Rush P. Delmar M. Taffet S.M. Braz. J. Med. Biol. Res. 2000; 33: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). To clone the Cx43CT domain, the following primers were used: forward, GAA GGA TCC ATG AGC GAT CCT TAC CAC GCC; and reverse, GCT TGA ATT CCA AGC CGG TTT AAA TCT CC.Expression of Recombinant GST-Cx43CTpGEX-6P-2 plasmids containing the GST-Cx43CT insert were transformed into BL-21-competent bacterial cells. Bacteria in LB broth were induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3–4 h; bacteria were then washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at pH 7.4 and pelleted by centrifugation (3000 rpm, 20 min). Bacterial pellets were bathed (20 ml/liter of culture) in PBS containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg of DNase, and 800 μl of a 25× stock of a protease inhibitor mixture (“Complete,” Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and sonicated on ice three times for 20 s. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation (20 min, 12,000 rpm; 4 °C), and the presence of the fusion protein was confirmed by SDS-PAGE.Purification of Cx43CTTo purify Cx43CT, bacterial lysate (20 ml) was incubated with 2 ml of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C for 2 h while gently rocking. The beads were then washed with PBS, incubated with PBS containing 2 mm ATP and 10 mm MgCl2 for 20 min at 37 °C (to remove a bacterial contaminant), and then washed again (4×) with PBS. To cleave the Cx43CT from the GST, the beads were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 160 units of PreScission Protease (a commercially available (Amersham Biosciences) fusion protein consisting of GST and the human rhinovirus 3C protease). The recombinant product after cleavage from GST contained the sequence 255–382 of rCx43 preceded by four additional amino acids (GPLG). The eluate was cleared by centrifugation (3000 rpm, 1 h, 4 °C) through an Amicon Centriplus 50 (Millipore). The filtrate was collected and then passed through an Amicon Centriplus 10 filter (3000 rpm, 2 h at 4 °C). The retentate, containing the purified Cx43CT, was resuspended in a solution of 10 mm Tris, 40 mm KCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol at pH 7.5.Protein concentrations were measured using a commercial kit (Bio-Rad DC Protein Assay). Protein purity was assessed by the characteristics of a Coomassie Blue-stained band in a protein gel, and in two separate cases, by mass spectrometry (matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization). In all evaluations, Cx43CT protein was found to be ∼90% pure.Production of 15N-Labeled Cx43CTBacteria were grown as indicated above, but in a minimal medium containing 100 mm KH2PO4, 70 mm KOH, 18 mm FeSO4·7H2O, 300 mm glucose, 1 mm MgSO4, 1.48 μm thiamine, 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and 0.75 mg/ml15NH4Cl.Peptide SynthesisA series of synthetic peptides corresponding to specific sequences of intracellular domains of Cx43 were tested for their association with Cx43CT and, in one case (peptide Cx43L2; see below) to determine secondary structure. Sequences were chosen in part based on predictions of α-helical secondary structure using the structure prediction neural net program, Pred2Ary (16Chandonia J.-M. Karplus M. Proteins: Struct. Funct. Genet. 1999; 35: 293-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The names, primary sequences, and amino acid locations in the Cx43 sequence are listed below in Table I. All peptides were synthesized to >95% purity at the Laboratory for Macromolecular Analysis at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. The syntheses were carried out using Fmoc chemistry on an Applied Biosystems 430A automated peptide synthesizer. Biotinylation of Cx43L2 was accomplished by N-terminal linkage of activated Biotin (Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) using Fmoc-ε-aminocaproic acid (Bachem, Torrance, CA). The samples were purified by high-performance liquid chromatography, and purity was assessed by electron ionization mass spectrometry. Peptides were diluted in PBS buffer containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST), and the pH was adjusted using small volumes of concentrated HCl or NaOH as appropriate. Purified calmodulin was purchased from a commercial vendor (Sigma) and also tested by MR for its ability to bind to Cx43CT.Table ICx43 peptides used and their sequencePeptideCx43 positionCx43 domainAmino acid sequenceCx43NT1–23Amino terminusMGDWSALGKLLDKVQAYSTAGGKCx43L195–114First half of cytoplasmic loopHVFYVMRKEEKLNKKEEELKCx43L2119–144Second half of cytoplasmic loopDGVNVEMHLKQIEIKKFKYGIEEHGKCx43–271271–287Fragment of carboxyl terminusCSSPTAPLSPMSPPGYKCx43–336336–350Fragment of carboxyl terminusDFPDDNQNAKKVAAGCx43–346346–360Fragment of carboxyl terminusKVAAGHELQPLAIVD Open table in a new tab Mirror ResonanceMirror resonance (MR) experiments were performed using an IAsys apparatus as described previously (17George A.J.

Cx43CT was covalently bound to carboxymethyl dextran-coated cuvettes using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide-HCl (EDC) andN-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Affinity Sensors, Cambridge, England); total cuvette area was 16 mm2 and density of matrix-bound Cx43CT was about 5 ng/mm2 (calculated from the response obtained during binding, assuming an equivalence of 163 arc-seconds per nanogram per mm2 (17George A.J. French R.R. Glennie M.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 183: 51-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar)). Ligates (peptides) were added to the cuvettes in PBST and were removed by a 3-min exposure to 10 mm HCl. Control experiments were conducted to determine the binding of the peptide to the matrix itself. For this purpose, a carboxymethyl-dextran cuvette was activated with EDC/NHS in the same manner used to covalently bind Cx43CT (31Johnson, B. A., and Blevins, R. A. (1994) 4,603–614.Google Scholar), except in this case no Cx43CT was included in the mixture. We refer to this as a “blank” cuvette. An average “blank trace” was calculated from three separate experiments in which the change in resonance elicited by a given concentration of a ligate to the blank cuvette was recorded. Blank traces were subtracted from those obtained using a Cx43CT-coated cuvette to determine the binding that was specific to the ligand-ligate interaction.MR data were acquired and analyzed using the IAsys software package (17George A.J.

Changes in resonance were recorded for the first 15 min after peptide addition and fit by exponential functions; steady-state responses (arc-seconds) were measured or projected from initial rates. All data measurements ignored the first two points acquired after addition (or washout) of the peptide, because those were considered to be subject to artifactual effects due to changes in the refractive index of the solution (17George A.J.

We refer to this method as “ELSA” (enzyme-linked sorbent assay). Briefly, Purified Cx43CT (either 50 or 100 ng/μl in PBS at pH 7.4) was added to individual wells of an Immulon-1B plate (100 μl per well). Bovine serum albumin (1%, pH 7.4) was used as control. The plates were incubated at 2–8 °C overnight to allow for adsorption of the ligand (Cx43CT or BSA). Plates were then blocked with 200 μl of 1% BSA diluted in PBS (pH 7.4) and incubated at 2–8 °C overnight. After block, plates were washed with 200 μl of PBS and 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) at either pH 6.5 or 7.4 and a PBST solution containing various concentrations of a biotinylated-Cx43L2 synthetic peptide was added to each well (100 μl per well, pH 6.5 or 7.4). The peptide-containing solution was allowed to interact with the ligand for 2 h. At the end of the incubation time the wells were washed (PBST, pH was held constant) and then 100 ng of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Pierce Endogen, Rockford, IL) diluted in PBST at pH 6.5 or 7.4 were added for 1 h. After another wash step, 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) substrate (100 μl, Rockland Immunochemicals, Gilbertsville, PA) was applied and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Optical density (OD) was measured at A 405 on a VMAX plate reader (Molecular Devices). The OD value was interpreted as directly indicative of the Cx43L2 concentration non-covalently bound to the ligand.NMR SpectroscopyNMR experiments (two-dimensional proton DQF-COSY (20Rance M.

Phys. 1980; 41: 95-117Crossref Scopus (1580) Google Scholar)) were performed on a Bruker DRX-600 spectrometer at 7 °C. Cx43L2 concentrations were ∼2 mm for each experiment. NMR data were acquired with 4096 complext 2 points and 256 t 1points. Mixing times of 125 and 300 ms were used for the two-dimensional NOESY spectra, and a mixing time of 100 ms was used for TOCSY spectra. Water suppression was achieved by using WATERGATE (23Piotto M.

Gronenborn A.M. Ikura M. Kay L.E. J. Magn. Reson. 1990; 87: 620-627Google Scholar). HSQC data were acquired with 2048 complex t 2points and 160 complex t 1 points. Spectral widths of proton and carbon resonances were 8,389 and 12,070 Hz, respectively. The number of scans per t 1increment was 256.Hydrogen bonds were identified based on temperature dependence studies (25Baxter N.J. Williamson M.P. J. Biomol. NMR. 1997; 9: 359-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). The amide proton chemical shifts were followed from 7 °C to 37 °C. Any amide proton that shifted less than 5.0 ppb/K was considered likely to be hydrogen bonded.Gradient-enhanced two-dimensional 1H15N HSQC experiments (26Kay L.E. Keifer P. Saarinen T. J. Am. Chem.

Data were acquired with 1024 complex points in the direct dimension and 64 complex points in the indirect dimension. Sweep widths were 8389 Hz in the proton dimension and 2432 Hz in the nitrogen dimension. Amide proton-amide proton NOEs were observed in two-dimensional 15N NOESY-HSQC spectra (26Kay L.E. Keifer P.

Chen A. Johnson Jr., C.S. J. Magn. Reson. A. 1995; 115: 260-264Crossref Scopus (1291) Google Scholar). The pK a values of the histidine side chains were determined from one-dimensional proton spectra collected on a Bruker DRX-300 spectrometer at 27 °C. A total of 128 scans was collected into a 16K data block using a sweep width of 6173 Hz for the titration spectra. Lyophilized Cx43L2 peptide was dissolved in 0.6 ml of D2O PBS buffer for a final concentration of 1 mm. The pH of the solution was adjusted by the addition of either 10 mm NaOD or DCl. The pH values quoted indicate pH measurements of the D2O solutions uncorrected for the deuterium isotope effect on the glass (28Glasoe P.K. Long F.A. J. Phys.

NOE cross-peaks classified as strong, medium, and weak were converted into distance restraints of 1.8–2.5, 1.8–3.5, and 1.8–5.5 Å, respectively. Torsion angle restraints were obtained from chemical shift analysis using the TALOS program (33Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2729) Google Scholar). Hydrogen bonds were imposed as two distance restraints (H-O distance 1.9–2.3 Å and N-O distance of 2.4–3.0 Å). The 10 best minimized structures were evaluated using AQUA and PROCHECK-NMR (34Lastowsky R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486PubMed Google Scholar).RESULTSMirror Resonance: Selective Binding of the Cx43L2 Peptide to the Recombinant Cx43CT ProteinWe used mirror resonance to test whether Cx43CT binds in a pH-dependent manner to other intracellular regions of Cx43. Recombinant Cx43CT was covalently bound to a carboxymethyl dextran matrix on the surface of a sensor chip, and exposed to various synthetic peptides that correspond to different intracellular regions of Cx43. Of all peptides tested (see list in TableI), binding was observed only to a peptide corresponding to the second half of the cytoplasmic loop (Cx43L2). A representative trace from experiments applying the highest peptide concentration tested (0.1 mm) is presented in Fig.1 A (trace labeled “L2 + CT”). The plot depicts the amplitude of the resonance signal (in arc-seconds) as a function of time. The pH of the solvent for that experiment was 6.5. At such high peptide concentration, but not detectable for concentrations < 50 μm, binding was also detected when peptide Cx43L2 was added to a blank cuvette at the same concentration and pH used in the Cx43CT cuvette, indicating nonspecific binding of Cx43L2 to the matrix. Yet, the amplitude of the binding was much smaller and the rate significantly slower than when the cuvette was coated with Cx43CT. The average blank trace (three separate experiments) for this particular Cx43L2 concentration at pH 6.5 is shown in Fig. 1 A(trace labeled “L2 + blank”; see “Experimental Procedures” for further details). The nonspecific component of the binding was subtracted from the binding recorded when Cx43L2 was added to the Cx43CT-coated cuvette. As shown by thetrace labeled “(L2 + CT) − (L2 + blank)” in Fig. 1 A, the subtraction eliminated a slow component that was not specific to the interaction of Cx43L2 with Cx43CT.To examine the pH dependence of the association, the Cx43L2-Cx43CT binding experiment was repeated at pH 7.4. Representative subtracted traces are shown in Fig. 1 B. Clearly, increasing solvent pH to 7.4 caused a significant reduction in the amplitude of the response. The peptide concentration was 100 μm for both experiments. These data suggest that low pH increases the binding affinity of the Cx43L2 peptide for Cx43CT. It is worth noting that all other peptides tested and the recombinant Ca2+ binding protein calmodulin also failed to bind to Cx43CT when the reaction was conducted at a pH of 7.4 (data not shown).A plot correlating the concentration of Cx43L2 to the amplitude of the binding is shown in Fig. 2. The data points were calculated from the exponential best-fits of subtracted traces recorded at a pH of 6.5 (red line andsymbols) or 7.4 (blue line andsymbols). The K D value of the Cx43CT-Cx43L2 interaction at a pH 6.5, estimated from the concentration-dependence curve of the subtracted traces, was 24 μm. The amplitude of the binding curve at pH 7.4 was too small to be properly fit; therefore, K D values for the binding at pH 7.4 could not be calculated under these conditions. Altogether, the results demonstrate selective, pH-dependent, and concentration-dependent binding between the carboxyl-terminal domain and the second half of the cytoplasmic loop of Cx43.Figure 2Concentration dependence of Cx43L2-Cx43CT binding at pH 7.4 (blue line) and 6.5 (red line) determined by mirror resonance. The amplitude of the binding at each concentration was determined from the exponential best-fit of the subtracted traces. The data describing the concentration dependence at pH 6.5 was best-fit (least squares) by a monoexponential function. The dissociation constantK D was estimated from the peptide concentration that corresponded to 50% of maximum binding. The calculatedK D value was 24 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Cx43L2-Cx43CT Binding Determined by the ELSA MethodBinding of Cx43CT to Cx43L2 was also demonstrated using an ELISA-like binding assay (see “Experimental Procedures”). Concentration-dependence curves are shown in Fig.3. Panels A and Bcorrespond to data obtained from plates coated with Cx43CT at a concentration of 50 and 100 ng/μl, respectively. In both plots, the abscissas indicate the concentration of Cx43L2 added to the plate, and the ordinates correspond to the extent of binding. The data points depict the averages of three separate experiments, each in duplicate.Bars indicate the standard error of the mean. Closed circles represent data obtained when the binding assay was performed at pH 6.5, and open circles correspond to values obtained at pH 7.4. Consistent with our results using mirror resonance, the amplitude of the binding increased when the pH of the solvent was reduced. To facilitate comparisons, all experimental values were normalized to the magnitude of the asymptote describing the binding of Cx43L2 to Cx43CT at pH 6.5. Data points were best-fit by single-exponential functions. The monoexponential increase in the amplitude of the binding as a function of ligate concentration suggested that this interaction could be described by first-rate order kinetics (36Creighton T.E. Proteins: Structures and Molecular Properties. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York, NY1993: 338-340Google Scholar). Accordingly, we determined the dissociation constant (K D) from the concentration of the ligate that corresponded to 50% of maximum binding. Values are presented in TableII. No sizable difference was detected as a function of the concentration of Cx43CT used to coat the plates, further confirming the applicability of first-rate order kinetics. TheK D value was decreased 3- to 4-fold when the experiment was performed at low pH. No significant binding was detected when BSA (75 ng/μl) was used as ligate, neither was binding observed when Cx43L2 was added to plates not coated, or coated with BSA (data not shown). These results confirm the pH dependence of Cx43CT-Cx43L2 binding obtained by MR and indicate that acidification of the solvent increases the binding affinity of Cx43L2 for the CT domain.Figure 3Concentration dependence of Cx43L2-Cx43CT binding at pH 7.4 (red lines) and 6.5 (blue lines) determined by an enzyme-linked sorbent assay ( ELSA ). The concentration of Cx43CT in the solution used to coat the wells was either 50 ng/μl (A) or 100 ng/μl (B). All data points were best-fit (least squares) by monoexponential functions.

https://openalex.org/W2164867491,"Cerebral pericytes constitute an essential component of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and are involved in blood vessel assembly. Recently, we reported on the induction of a BBB-specific enzyme expressed by cerebral pericytes (pericytic aminopeptidase N/pAPN) in coculture with cerebral endothelial cells. We completed this in vitro BBB system by adding astrocytes to these mixed cultures of endothelial cells and pericytes. Under these triculture conditions, endothelial cells and pericytes reorganize into capillary-like structures (CLSs). Capillary formation can also be achieved by the application of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-b1) in the culture medium of endothelial-pericyte cultures lacking astrocytes. In contrast to the effect achieved by astrocytes, pericytes did not assemble with endothelial cells. In both cases (application of astrocytes or TGF-b1), endothelial cells underwent apoptosis. However, endothelial cells that form CLSs in the presence of pericytes appeared to be resistant to induction of apoptosis. On the basis of these observations, we concluded that astrocytes have a profound influence on the morphogenetic events underlying the organization of the vessel wall; that the effect of TGF-b1 is different from the astrocytic effect because it lacks induction of endothelial-pericyte association; and that pericytes stabilize CLSs formed by endothelial cells in coculture with astrocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2130102974,"The structure of the adult skeleton is determined, in large part, by its genome. Whether genetic variations may influence the effectiveness of interventions to combat skeletal diseases remains unknown. The differential response of trabecular bone to an anabolic (low-level mechanical vibration) and a catabolic (disuse) mechanical stimulus were evaluated in three strains of adult mice. In low bone-mineral-density C57BL/6J mice, the low-level mechanical signal caused significantly larger bone formation rates (BFR) in the proximal tibia, but the removal of functional weight bearing did not significantly alter BFR. In mid-density BALB/cByJ mice, mechanical stimulation also increased BFR, whereas disuse significantly decreased BFR. In contrast, neither anabolic nor catabolic mechanical signals influenced any index of bone formation in high-density C3H/HeJ mice. Together, data from this study indicate that the sensitivity of trabecular tissue to both anabolic and catabolic stimuli is influenced by the genome. Extrapolated to humans, these results may explain in part why prophylaxes for low bone mass are not universally effective, yet also indicate that there may be a genotypic indication of people who are at reduced risk of suffering from bone loss."

In a recent study, we demonstrated the association of ahnak with the regulatory beta2 subunit of the cardiac L-type Ca2+ channel. Here we identify the most carboxyl-terminal ahnak region (aa 5262-5643) to interact with recombinant beta2a as well as with beta2 and beta1a isoforms of native muscle Ca2+ channels using a panel of GST fusion proteins. Equilibrium sedimentation analysis revealed Kd values of 55 +/- 11 nM and 328 +/- 24 nM for carboxyl-terminal (aa 195-606) and amino-terminal (aa 1-200) truncates of the beta2a subunit, respectively. The same carboxyl-terminal ahnak region (aa 5262-5643) bound to G-actin and cosedimented with F-actin. Confocal microscopy of human left ventricular tissue localized the carboxyl-terminal ahnak portion to the sarcolemma including the T-tubular system and the intercalated disks of cardiomyocytes. These results suggest that ahnak provides a structural basis for the subsarcolemmal cytoarchitecture and confers the regulatory role of the actin-based cytoskeleton to the L-type Ca2+ channel."
https://openalex.org/W2142114760,"Carotenoids are widely used as important micronutrients in food. Furthermore, carotenoid supplementation has been used in the treatment of diseases associated with oxidative stress. However, in some clinical studies harmful effects have been observed, for example, a higher incidence of lung cancer in individuals exposed to extraordinary oxidative stress. The causal mechanisms are still unclear. Carotenoid cleavage products (CCPs), including highly reactive aldehydes and epoxides, are formed during oxidative attacks in the course of antioxidative action. Here, we tested the hypothesis that CCPs may increase oxidative stress by impairing mitochondrial function. We found that CCPs strongly inhibit state 3 respiration of isolated rat liver mitochondria even at concentrations between 0.5 and 20 microM. This was true for retinal, beta-ionone, and mixtures of cleavage products, which were generated in the presence of hypochlorite to mimic their formation in inflammatory regions. The inhibition of mitochondrial respiration was accompanied by a reduction in protein sulfhydryl content, decreasing glutathione levels and redox state, and elevated accumulation of malondialdehyde. Changes in mitochondrial membrane potential favor functional deterioration of the adenine nucleotide translocator. The findings may reflect a basic mechanism of increasing the risk of cancer induced by CCPs."

https://openalex.org/W2164416677,"Accumulating evidence suggests that activation of the immune system in the central nervous system (CNS) after trauma protects the CNS from damage propagation and facilitates regeneration. Studies by our group have shown that passive transfer of autoimmune T cells specific to myelin basic protein (T(MBP)) can protect injured neurons in the rat CNS from secondary degeneration. In this study, we investigated the effects of T(MBP) treatment on the local immune response (by B cells and macrophages) and on the expression of neurotrophic factors after crush injury of the rat optic nerve. Systemic injection of activated T(MBP) caused an increase in the accumulation of macrophages/microglia and B cells in the injured nerve, which was greater than that seen in the injured optic nerves of untreated animals. This accumulation was accompanied by a transient, but massive, increase in the expression of neurotrophic factors. Immunocytochemical analysis demonstrated differential expression of neurotrophins by resident astrocytes and by infiltrating B cells, T cells, and macrophages. Because postinjury neuronal survival and maintenance are known to be affected by neurotrophins, our findings point to a possible contribution of a neurotrophin-related mechanism to the protective effect conferred by T cell-mediated autoimmunity on injured neurons."

https://openalex.org/W2052491431,"Cell membrane compartmentalization, which is believed to involve association of cholesterol- and glycosphingolipid-enriched membrane rafts, represents an important means of transmitting information across the plasma membrane. We have previously shown that raft association is mediated by the Ca2+-dependent binding of annexin 2 to the plasma membrane. In the present study, we demonstrate that the association of annexins 1 and 2 with the smooth muscle cell membrane can be terminated by their proteolytic cleavage. This proteolysis is thought to be triggered by calpain and occurs at non-raft regions of the plasma membrane. It is critically dependent on the intracellular concentration of free Ca2+ and requires an intact contractile apparatus. Annexins 1 and 2 interact with different membrane microcompartments--the former with non-raft, glycerolipid regions, the latter preferentially with membrane rafts. We demonstrate that PKC and RhoA, major signaling molecules that regulate smooth muscle contraction, are spatially segregated and interact with distinct membrane microcompartments. Proteolysis abolishes annexin binding to the plasma membrane and might result in rearrangement of membrane constituents followed by the interruption of segregation-dependent signaling events."
https://openalex.org/W1978218402,"Cytoskeletal remodeling events are tightly regulated by signal transduction systems that impinge on adhesion components and modulators of cellular architecture. We have previously shown that the Ste20-like kinase (SLK) can induce apoptosis through the induction of actin disassembly and cellular retraction (Sabourin, L. A., Tamai, K., Seale, P., Wagner, J., and Rudnicki, M. A. (2000) Mol. Cell. Biol. 20, 684–696). Using immunofluorescence studies, we report that SLK is redistributed with adhesion components at large podosome-like adhesion sites in fibronectin-stimulated fibroblasts. However, in vitrokinase assays demonstrate that its activity is not modulated following fibronectin stimulation. Double immunofluorescence studies in exponentially growing or spreading fibroblasts show that SLK is associated with the microtubule network and can be coprecipitated with α-tubulin. Furthermore, the stimulation of adhesion site formation by microtubule-disrupting agents induces the relocalization of SLK with unpolymerized α-tubulin to large vinculin-containing adhesion complexes. Using microinjection studies, we show that ectopic expression of activated SLK induces the disassembly of actin stress fibers, a process that can be inhibited by dominant negative Rac1. Significantly, endogenous SLK can be colocalized with Rac1 in spreading cells on FN. Finally, the overexpression of SLK by adenoviral infection inhibits cell spreading on fibronectin. These results suggest that SLK is part of a microtubule-associated complex that is targeted to adhesion sites and implicated in the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics.

The extracellular matrix exerts profound control over the cells. The effects of the matrix are primarily mediated by integrins, a family of cell surface receptors that attach cells to the matrix and mediate mechanical and chemical signals from it. These signals regulate the activities of cytoplasmic kinases, growth factor receptors, and ion channels and control the organization of the intracellular actin cytoskeleton (1Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3757) Google Scholar). Integrin receptor binding to extracellular matrix proteins generates intracellular signals through tyrosine phosphorylation events that are important for cell growth, survival, and migration (2Schlaepfer D.D. Hauck C.R. Sieg D.J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 435-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar). In various cell types, integrin clustering triggers tyrosine phosphorylation of signaling proteins through the activation of a large number of non-receptor protein tyrosine kinases such as focal adhesion kinase (FAK)1 and the Src-family of kinases. Increased tyrosine phosphorylation of intracellular proteins is one of the earliest responses stimulated by integrin receptor activation when cells contact matrix protein such as fibronectin (FN). Upon replating of cells on fibronectin, FAK becomes activated either through conformational changes or as a result of aggregation mediated by integrin clustering. FAK autophosphorylation at Tyr-397 under these conditions promotes the transient association of Src-family protein tyrosine kinases with FAK and the formation of a signaling complex. In addition, FAK associates with several different signaling proteins such as p130Cas, Shc, Grb2, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and paxillin. This association enables FAK to function within a network of integrin-stimulated signaling pathways, leading to the activation of targets such as the ERK and JNK/mitogen activated protein kinase pathways (1Giancotti F.G.

Previous data have suggested the existence of a factor associated with the microtubules that can be released and affect assembly of the actin meshwork (16Gundersen G.G. Cook T.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Interestingly, microtubule breakdown stimulates stress fiber formation in fibroblasts (17Danowski B.A. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 93: 255-266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), requires active Rho, and involves elevated myosin light chain phosphorylation (14Liu B.P. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Burridge K. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1998; 5: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 18Cook T.A. Nagasaki T. Gundersen G.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 175-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 19Enomoto T. Cell Struct. Funct. 1996; 21: 317-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), suggesting a coordinate regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and the microtubule network. This is accompanied by an assembly of adhesion plaques and tyrosine phosphorylation of the adhesion components FAK and paxillin (10Bershadsky A. Chausovsky A. Becker E. Lyubimova A. Geiger B. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1279-1289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Tension exerted by microtubules on the actin cytoskeleton has been hypothesized to counteract stress fiber formation (10Bershadsky A. Chausovsky A. Becker E. Lyubimova A. Geiger B. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1279-1289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that there is direct physical interaction between the microtubules and adhesion sites, suggesting that relaxation signals are delivered via the microtubules to focal contacts to modulate the development of adhesions in a region-specific manner (11Kaverina I. Krylyshkina O. Small J.V. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1033-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 15Kaverina I. Rottner K. Small J.V. J.

Biophys. 1997; 340: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 23Pytowski B. Hicklin D.J. Kornhaber G. Dellaratta D.V. Witte L. Arch. Biochem.

Seale P. Wagner J. Rudnicki M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 684-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) have previously identified a novel Ste20-related kinase termed SLK that is involved in cytoskeletal reorganization and apoptosis (24Sabourin L.A. Rudnicki M.A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7566-7575Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 25Sabourin L.A. Tamai K. Seale P. Wagner J. Rudnicki M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 684-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Overexpression of SLK in various cell lines was shown to induce the rapid disassembly of actin stress fibers and cell death (25Sabourin L.A. Tamai K. Seale P. Wagner J. Rudnicki M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 684-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Relatively high levels of SLK protein and activity have been observed in all cell types analyzed, suggesting a functional role for SLK in physiological processes other than apoptosis. Because of its ability to induce cytoskeletal remodeling when overexpressed in a variety of cultured cell lines, we have analyzed the levels, distribution, and activity of SLK protein during cell spreading on FN, a process that requires extensive cellular remodeling (2Schlaepfer D.D. Hauck C.R. Sieg D.J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 435-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar,26Small J.V. Rottner K. Kaverina I. Anderson K.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Using indirect immunofluorescence microscopy and biochemical techniques, we have determined that SLK is redistributed to large adhesion complexes during cell spreading on FN and that it is associated with the microtubule network. Using microinjection studies, we show that ectopic expression of activated SLK induces the disassembly of actin stress fibers, a process that can be inhibited by dominant negative Rac1. Finally, the overexpression of SLK by adenoviral infection inhibits cell spreading on FN. These results suggest that SLK may be delivered to adhesion sites via the microtubule network where it regulates actin dynamics. The mouse fibroblast cell lines MEF-3T3 (MEF Tet-Off, C3018, Clontech) and Swiss 3T3 mouse embryonic fibroblast (ATCC catalog no. 4925) were used in all experiments. MEF-3T3 and Swiss 3T3 cell lines were maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DME medium, Bio-Whitaker) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mml-glutamine, 50 μg/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. For FN replating assays, subconfluent MEF-3T3 cultures were serum-starved in 0.25% FBS-DME medium for 24 h and harvested by trypsin-EDTA treatment as described previously (27Sieg D.J. Hauck C.R. Schlaepfer D.D. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2677-2691Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The trypsin was inactivated using soybean trypsin inhibitor (0.5 mg/ml), and the cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 0.1% bovine serum albumin-DME medium. After 1 h at 37 °C in suspension, the cells were plated onto fibronectin-coated plates or coverslips. The culture dishes (or coverslips) were precoated with fibronectin (10 μg/ml, Sigma) or poly-l-lysine (100 μg/ml, Sigma) in PBS overnight at 4 °C, rinsed with PBS, and warmed to 37 °C for 1 h prior to replating. For cytoskeletal disruption experiments, MEF-3T3 cells were plated on FN-coated (10 μg/ml) plates and then serum-starved overnight on 0.25% FBS-DME medium. The plates were then treated with colchicine (10 μg/ml) or nocodazole (10 μm) for 30 min prior to lysis. An analysis of SLK protein expression and activity was performed by Western blot and in vitro kinase assay as described below. To disrupt the microtubule network prior to FN stimulation, colchicine was added to the cells in suspension in the final 30 min of incubation. For immunofluorescence studies, the coverslips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, washed in PBS, and blocked with 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 200 μg/ml ChromaPure Goat IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories). SLK was detected using an anti-SLK rabbit polyclonal antibody (24Sabourin L.A. Rudnicki M.A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7566-7575Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) in conjunction with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled or tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC)-labeled secondary antibodies. Vinculin protein was detected with a mouse anti-vinculin monoclonal (clone VIN11–5, Sigma) in conjunction with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary antibodies. Tubulin protein was detected using an anti-α-tubulin monoclonal antibody (clone DM1, Sigma) and TRITC-labeled secondary antibodies. The anti-Rac1 monoclonal antibody was obtained from Transduction Laboratories. Actin was detected by incubation with TRITC-conjugated phalloidin. Samples were visualized with a Zeiss Axioskop100 epifluorescence microscope equipped with appropriate filters and photographed with a digital camera (Sony Corporation HBO50) using the Northern Eclipse software package. At various times after replating, the attached cells were rinsed in PBS and protein extracts were made in modified RIPA buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors (Sigma inhibitor mixture). For SLK expression analysis, 20 μg of total cell lysate was subjected to Western blot with anti-SLK rabbit polyclonal antibodies. Reactive proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence using a goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody and visualized using a chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For in vitro kinase assays, 200 μg of total cell lysate was immunoprecipitated using 2 μg of anti-SLK antibodies and 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with NETN (50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40) and once with kinase buffer (20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 15 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 1 mm orthovanadate). Reactions (20 μl in kinase buffer) were initiated by the addition of 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. After a 30-min incubation at 30 °C, reactions were terminated by the addition of 4× SDS sample buffer and 20-μl aliquots were fractionated by 8% SDS-PAGE. Gels were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, exposed to x-ray film, and probed for SLK to evaluate the efficiency of the immunoprecipitation. For the detection of FAK, 50 μg of cell lysate was subjected to Western blot with anti-FAK rabbit polyclonal IgG antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) or with anti-FAK (pY397) phosphospecific rabbit polyclonal antibody (BIOSOURCE International). To evaluate the level of paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation, 500 μg of total cell lysate in modified RIPA was immunoprecipitated using 2 μl of anti-paxillin monoclonal antibody (clone 349, Transduction Laboratories), washed in NETN, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The membranes were probed with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (RC20:HRPO, Transduction Laboratories) and subjected to chemiluminescence detection (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). In coimmunoprecipitation experiments, equal amounts of total cell lysate (200 μg in modified RIPA or Triton X-100 buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, and 1% Triton X-100) were immunoprecipitated with anti-SLK, washed in NETN, resolved on 8% SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and probed for the indicated proteins. For microinjection studies, plasmid DNA in water (100 ng/μl) was injected into the nuclei of cells plated on FN-coated coverslips using a semi-automated Eppendorf system equipped with a 5171 Micromanipulator on a Zeiss Axiovert S100 microscope. The SLK expression plasmids consisted of HA-tagged SLK C-terminal truncation, which results in SLK activation (HA-SLK1-373). Plasmid HA-SLK1-373K63R is the kinase inactive version of HA-SLK1-373 (25Sabourin L.A. Tamai K. Seale P. Wagner J. Rudnicki M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 684-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). For coinjections, FLAG-tagged RacN17 and HA-SLK1-373 were mixed (each at 100 ng/ml) and injected in MEF-3T3 cells. The injected cells were incubated for 3 h (or 8 h in coinjections) at 37 °C, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and processed for indirect immunofluorescence staining. Coverslips were double-stained for HA using anti-HA rabbit polyclonal antibody (sc-805, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and anti-vinculin or actin as described above. To quantitatively measure the phenotypic changes induced by SLK ectopic expression, cells that stained positive for the HA epitope and displayed an absence of cytoplasmic stress fibers were scored. At least 50 injected cells were counted in three separate experiments, and the average is shown. In spreading assays, MEF-3T3 cells were infected with adenoviruses expressing either of the two HA-tagged truncations of SLK. The cells were serum-starved in 0.25% FBS-DME medium overnight and infected for 90 min at a MOI of 100 in serum-free medium and allowed to express the tagged proteins for 5 h. The cells were then collected by centrifugation, held in suspension for 1 h, and plated onto fibronectin-coated coverslips and allowed to spread for 10–20 min prior to fixation and immunofluorescence staining. To quantitatively assess the effect of SLK overexpression during cell spreading, HA-positive cells that displayed a rounded “non-spread” morphology (HA-SLK1-373) or increased density of stress fibers (HA-SLK1-373K63R) were enumerated. At least 100 HA-positive cells were counted in three separate experiments. We have previously demonstrated that the overexpression of the SLK induces actin stress fiber disassembly and cell death (24Sabourin L.A. Rudnicki M.A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7566-7575Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 25Sabourin L.A. Tamai K. Seale P. Wagner J. Rudnicki M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 684-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Because of its ability to induce cytoskeletal remodeling when overexpressed in a variety of cultured cell lines, we analyzed the levels, distribution, and activity of SLK protein during cell spreading on FN, a process that requires extensive cellular remodeling (2Schlaepfer D.D. Hauck C.R. Sieg D.J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 435-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar, 26Small J.V. Rottner K. Kaverina I. Anderson K.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). To gain insight into the role of SLK during normal cell growth, we first investigated the cellular distribution of endogenous SLK in exponentially growing MEF-3T3 cells. Supporting the observation that SLK can induce stress fiber disassembly, endogenous SLK distribution was found to correlate with an absence of actin stress fibers (see Fig.1), suggesting a role for SLK in the regulation of actin dynamics. Interestingly, the levels of SLK protein were also found to be variable, suggesting that its expression may be regulated throughout the cell cycle. The replating of suspended cells on FN-coated substrates has been shown to trigger the recruitment of adhesion complexes and subsequent actin polymerization from adhesion sites (2Schlaepfer D.D. Hauck C.R. Sieg D.J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 435-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar, 28Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 705-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). To investigate the function of SLK in cytoskeletal remodeling events, MEF-3T3 cells were immunostained for SLK during adhesion and spreading shortly after FN stimulation. When MEF cells held in suspension were replated onto FN-coated substrates, SLK was found to be redistributed to the cell periphery and to colocalize with the adhesion protein vinculin (Fig. 1,E and F) and FAK (data not shown). Surprisingly, SLK was observed to colocalize with vinculin at large structures resembling lamellipodia that formed abundantly 20 min post-replating (Fig. 1, E and F). A poor association was observed at discrete adhesion complexes that formed in the initial 10 min of spreading (Fig. 1, C and D), suggesting that SLK may be associated with adhesion complex disassembly or turnover. To investigate potential changes in SLK kinase activity during cell spreading on FN, extracts from replated cells were prepared and subjected to Western blot analysis and in vitro kinase assays. Following replating and Western blot analysis, total SLK levels remained unchanged during cell spreading (Fig.2 A). Interestingly, followingin vitro kinase assay and normalization to total immunoprecipitated SLK (data not shown), SLK activity remained unchanged following replating onto FN-coated plates (Fig.2 A). Similarly, no changes were observed during cell adhesion (20 min) to poly-l-lysine-coated substrates. Over the same time period, the phosphorylation of FAK at tyrosine 397 (28Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 705-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar) and increased paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation (2Schlaepfer D.D. Hauck C.R. Sieg D.J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 435-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar, 28Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 705-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar) did occur, indicating that the adhesion components were activated (Fig.2 B). These results suggest that SLK distribution is modulated by adhesion without any detectable changes in its kinase activity. One possibility is that specific redistribution of SLK leads to localized changes in substrate phosphorylation and downstream signaling events. The observation that SLK colocalizes with adhesion components during late spreading events raises the possibility that it is implicated in adhesion complex disassembly or turnover. Recently, adhesion site contact by the microtubule network has been shown to promote their dissociation (11Kaverina I. Krylyshkina O. Small J.V. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1033-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 15Kaverina I. Rottner K. Small J.V. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 181-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). In addition, the disruption of microtubules has been shown to induce the assembly of focal adhesions and to stimulate the formation of actin stress fibers (10Bershadsky A. Chausovsky A. Becker E. Lyubimova A. Geiger B. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1279-1289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the distribution of SLK and α-tubulin in double immunostaining experiments. As shown in Fig.3, a very strong colocalization was observed between the microtubule network and endogenous SLK protein in exponentially growing MEF cells (>95% of exponentially growing cells). In some areas at the cell periphery, SLK staining presented as a “filament-like” pattern (see Fig. 3, C andD) that colocalized with the microtubule network, suggesting that SLK is a microtubule-associated kinase. Interestingly, this association of SLK with the microtubules appeared to be preferentially non-centrosomal. Similarly, non-centrosomal microtubule nucleation has been observed at focal contacts in 3T3 cells during recovery from nocodazole or taxol treatment (15Kaverina I. Rottner K. Small J.V. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 181-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). To test whether SLK forms part of a complex with the microtubule, whole cell extracts obtained under different lysis conditions were subjected to immunoprecipitations using anti-SLK followed by Western blot analysis. Our results show that under all of the conditions tested, α-tubulin could be coprecipitated with SLK (Fig. 3 E). However, in glutathioneS-transferase pull-down assays using glutathioneS-transferase-tubulin, SLK did not interact directly with α-tubulin (data not shown), suggesting that SLK is indirectly associated with the microtubule and that they are part of a higher order protein complex. The treatment of serum-starved fibroblasts with microtubule disrupting agents has been previously shown to stimulate the formation of large adhesion complexes containing tyrosine-phosphorylated FAK and paxillin at the cell periphery (10Bershadsky A. Chausovsky A. Becker E. Lyubimova A. Geiger B. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1279-1289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 14Liu B.P. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Burridge K. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1998; 5: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). To test whether SLK can redistribute to newly formed adhesion sites following microtubule depolymerization, serum-starved MEF cells grown on FN were treated with nocodazole for 30 min and subjected to double immunostaining for SLK and vinculin or α-tubulin. Induction of focal adhesion assembly by nocodazole resulted in the redistribution of SLK to the cell periphery with vinculin and α-tubulin, suggesting that SLK can be targeted to newly formed adhesion sites (Fig. 4,D and E). Interestingly, this can be achieved in the absence of an intact microtubule network (Fig. 4, F andG). Microtubule-disrupting agents have been shown to impair cell spreading and focal adhesion turnover (11Kaverina I. Krylyshkina O. Small J.V. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1033-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next examined whether SLK was also associated with the microtubule network during cell adhesion and spreading on FN. The replating of suspended cells on FN-coated substrates resulted in SLK localization to the cell periphery with polymerized microtubules (Fig. 5,A and B). Interestingly, in the presence of colchicine, SLK was also colocalized with α-tubulin at the cell periphery, even though the vast majority of the cells failed to spread (Fig. 5, C and D). Similarly, SLK was colocalized with large vinculin-containing structures in colchicine-treated cells (Fig. 5, E and F). Similar large adhesions were also observed to form following taxol “freezing” of microtubules (11Kaverina I. Krylyshkina O. Small J.V. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1033-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Overall, these results suggest that SLK is associated with the microtubule network but can also be targeted to adhesion sites independently of polymerized microtubules. To gain insight into the role of SLK during cell adhesion and spreading, MEF cells grown on FN-coated substrates were microinjected with epitope-tagged SLK expression vectors encoding the activated truncation SLK1-373 (or the kinase inactive mutant SLK1-373K63R) and analyzed for the presence of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions. Cells overexpressing activated SLK1-373 displayed a retracted morphology (rounded appearance and loosely adherent), a marked reduction in actin stress fibers and extensive actin reorganization at the periphery (Fig.6, A and B). Quantitative analysis showed that >85% (86.6 ± 7%) of cells expressing SLK1-373 displayed that phenotype. In contrast, no change in stress fiber density was observed in cells injected with the kinase-inactive SLK1-373K63R (97 ± 2% retained stress fibers, see Fig. 6, C and D). When SLK1-373-overexpressing cells were surveyed for focal adhesions using anti-vinculin antibodies, peripheral adhesion sites were smaller and fibrillar adhesions were greatly reduced or absent, consistent with the disassembly of actin stress fibers (Fig. 6, E andH). Overexpression of SLK1-373K63Rhad no effect on the density, size, and distribution of vinculin-containing adhesion sites in all injected cells (Fig. 6,G and H). No obvious differences were observed in the organization of the microtubule network of microinjected cells (data not shown). These results suggest a functional role for SLK in the process of actin stress fiber disassembly rather than a direct destabilization of adhesion structures. The small GTPase Rac1 has been previously shown to induce stress fiber disassembly as well as lamellipodia formation (29Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2082) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Rac1 also binds directly to the microtubule in its GTP-bound form (30Best A. Ahmed S. Kozma R. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3756-3762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and becomes activated by microtubule growth in fibroblasts (21Waterman-Storer C.M. Worthylake R.A. Liu B.P. Burridge K. Salmon E.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested the possible involvement of Rac1 in SLK-mediated stress fiber disassembly. As shown in Fig. 6, I–K, the coinjection of both HA-SLK1-373 and a dominant negative form of Rac1, RacN17, resulted in a marked inhibition of stress fiber disassembly (86% compared with 32% in the presence of RacN17) and subsequent cellular retraction for up to 8 h post-injection. Over the same period, cells expressing HA-SLK1-373 alone had completely retracted and displayed extensive blebbing, a hallmark of apoptotic cells. Furthermore, as for vinculin, in 60% (60 ± 5%) of the cells, SLK was found to colocalize with Rac1 following replating of MEF-3T3 cells onto FN (Fig.7). Together, these results suggest a functional interaction between these two proteins and that Rac1 may be a mediator of SLK-induced actin remodeling. Whether SLK directly regulates Rac1 or an upstream guanine exchange pathway remains to be elucidated. To test the effect of SLK overexpression on cell spreading, MEF cells were infected with adenoviral constructs encoding SLK1-373 or SLK1-373K63R and then replated on FN-coated substrates for 10–20 min. Because overexpression of SLK1-373 induces a rapid apoptotic response (24Sabourin L.A. Rudnicki M.A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7566-7575Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 25Sabourin L.A. Tamai K. Seale P. Wagner J. Rudnicki M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 684-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), the cells were only allowed to express the HA-tagged constructs for 6 h prior to plating. As shown in Fig.8, cells expressing the kinase-inactive protein SLK1-373K63R assembled vinculin-containing adhesion sites but displayed an increased stress fiber density and appeared larger than uninjected cells with numerous lamellipodia (Fig. 8,A, B, E, and F). This phenotype was observed in 95 ± 5% of HA-positive cells. In contrast, cells expressing activated SLK1-373 at relatively low levels (∼8% HA-positive cells) displayed very small adhesion sites throughout the cell (Fig. 8, C and D). Cells (92 ± 6% HA-positive cells) expressing relatively higher levels of SLK1-373 failed to spread and assemble actin stress fibers on FN-coated substrates (Fig. 8, G and H). The failure to polymerize actin in SLK1-373-overexpressing cells may lead to adhesion site instability and an inhibition of contractile mechanisms, leading to impaired cell spreading. These results are consistent with a role for SLK during late spreading events such as adhesion turnover, actin remodeling, and membrane protrusion. The processes regulating cellular adhesion and migration involve complex-signaling mechanisms, ultimately resulting in cytoskeletal remodeling and changes in cell shape and cell movement (2Schlaepfer D.D.

We have recently identified a novel Ste20-like kinase activated during apoptosis and mediating actin reorganization (24Sabourin L.A.

Biol. 2000; 20: 684-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of SLK in cytoskeletal remodeling during normal cell growth, we analyzed the expression, activity, and cellular distribution of endogenous SLK protein following FN stimulation and cell spreading. Our results show that SLK colocalizes with the adhesion protein vinculin at “podosome-like” structures, which formed predominantly during the phase of cell spreading (20 min) on FN in MEF-3T3 cells. These large vinculin-containing structures are suggestive of loosely assembled adhesion sites resembling lamellipodia, which suggests that SLK may be involved in regulating cell spreading through destabilization of adhesion contacts. Supporting this possibility, no colocalization with vinculin was observed early (10 min) during spreading when focal adhesions are assembling and adhesion components become tyrosine-phosphorylated. In addition, the overexpression of activated SLK in exponentially growing cells or cells that were replated onto FN-coated substrates induced their retraction from the substrate and inhibited cell spreading, respectively. This appeared to be mediated by a loss of actin stress fibers as well as fibrillar adhesions, presumably located along the fibers. Furthermore SLK-induced actin fiber disassembly could be inhibited by dominant negative Rac1, RacN17, suggesting a role for Rac1 downstream of SLK-mediated cytoskeletal remodeling events. These results support a role for SLK in actin dynamics during cell spreading, which may contribute to adhesion site destabilization and turnover (2Schlaepfer D.D. Hauck C.R. Sieg D.J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 435-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar, 4Horwitz A.R. Parsons J.T. Science. 1999; 286: 1102-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 6Small J.V. Kaverina I.

Recently, the microtubule network has been clearly implicated in adhesion site destabilization and turnover, a process that requires kinesin motors (10Bershadsky A. Chausovsky A. Becker E.

Cell. 2000; 11: 2999-3012Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that microtubules are required for cell migration, tail retraction, and modulation of cell adhesion. Similarly, it has been proposed that regional contractility is modulated by the interplay of microtubule-linked events with focal adhesions (12Kaverina I. Krylyshkina O. Gimona M. Beningo K. Wang Y.L. Small J.V. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 739-742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Interestingly, our results show that SLK is associated with a microtubule-containing protein complex in MEF-3T3 cells. In addition, we find that SLK colocalizes with vinculin-containing structures and the microtubule network during cell spreading. Combined with previous observations, our results suggest that one of the adhesion-destabilizing signals delivered by the microtubule may be SLK. One possibility is that the rapid disassembly of actin stress fibers mediated by SLK may represent a regulatory mechanism for the control of microtubule-mediated suppression of contractility during remodeling events. Alternatively, the depolymerization of actin fibers by SLK may allow more efficient targeting of adhesion sites by the microtubule for further delivery of destabilizing signals (15Kaverina I. Rottner K. Small J.V. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 181-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Direct interaction between SLK and α-tubulin was not observed byin vitro binding assays, suggesting an indirect interaction. One possibility is that post-translational modification of one or both proteins is required for their interaction, a signal that could be transduced downstream of adhesion complex formation. Alternatively, an adapter protein is required to recruit SLK to the microtubule. Whether these interactions are tightly regulated through post-translational modifications downstream of adhesion complex formation remains to be investigated. The Rho family of small GTPases has been implicated as a mediator of cytoskeletal remodeling events such as the formation of stress fibers, lamellipodia, and ruffling (29Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2082) Google Scholar, 33Oliferenko S. Kaverina I. Small J.V. Huber L.A. J.

The small GTPase Rac1 has been shown to be activated following microtubule growth and to promote lamellipodial protrusion (21Waterman-Storer C.M. Worthylake R.A. Liu B.P. Burridge K. Salmon E.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Specifically, GTP-Rac1 can directly bind β-tubulin (30Best A. Ahmed S. Kozma R. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3756-3762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), suggesting that it plays a role in cytoskeletal remodeling events regulated by microtubule growth such as adhesion disassembly. In addition, RhoA and mDia have been demonstrated to stabilize the microtubule network by capping (14Liu B.P. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Burridge K. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1998; 5: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 18Cook T.A. Nagasaki T. Gundersen G.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 175-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 19Enomoto T. Cell Struct. Funct. 1996; 21: 317-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), presumably to stabilize adhesion sites and the actin network (36Hollenbeck P. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R820-R823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Our results show that SLK and Rac1 localization overlap extensively during cell spreading on FN at membrane protrusions resembling lamellipodia (cellular structures that can be induced by activated Rac1), suggesting that Rac1 may be a downstream effector of SLK. Furthermore, dominant negative Rac1 inhibits the cytoskeletal remodeling events induced by activated SLK, suggesting a functional interaction between these proteins. Recently, the overexpression of β-tubulin 1 in MDCK cells has been demonstrated to inhibit cell spreading and adhesion (8Lezama R. Castillo A. Luduena R.F. Meza I. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2001; 50: 147-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In addition, delayed formation of adhesion sites was reported in these cells shortly after replating (8Lezama R. Castillo A. Luduena R.F. Meza I. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2001; 50: 147-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Interestingly, microtubule-disrupting agents induce the formation of adhesion sites and actin stress fibers, supporting the notion that the growing microtubule carries actin- and adhesion-destabilizing signals. Therefore, we propose a model whereby specific adhesion components through direct interaction with tubulin can target the microtubule network to adhesion sites (see Fig.9). Targeting of SLK to adhesion sites by the microtubules can lead to actin network destabilization, a process required for further cytoskeletal remodeling and cell movement. Overall, we have established a novel molecular link between the adhesion-destabilizing activity of the microtubule network and actin-based cytoskeletal remodeling events. Further studies will be necessary to identify upstream and downstream signals required for SLK-dependent remodeling events implicating Rac1 and the microtubule network.

https://openalex.org/W2109066329,"Most of the 400 million grass pollen-allergic patients worldwide are co-sensitized to several unrelated grass pollen allergens. Based on frequent co-sensitization patterns determined in 200 grass pollen-allergic patients, three recombinant hybrid molecules were developed by polymerase chain reaction-based mending of cDNAs coding for the major timothy grass pollen allergens (Phl p 1, Phl p 2, Phl p 5, Phl p 6) for vaccination against grass pollen allergy. The hybrids rP2-P6, rP6-P2, and rP5-P1 contained most of the epitopes of natural grass pollen extract and induced stronger lymphoproliferative responses in cultured mononuclear cells of grass pollen-allergic patients than did equimolar mixtures of the individual allergens. Immunization of mice with the hybrids yielded higher antibody titers than did immunization with the individual allergen components or grass pollen extract, which suggests that the individual components of the hybrids can serve as molecular scaffolds for each other to enhance their immunogenicity. Antibodies induced with the hybrids in mice inhibited the binding of grass pollen-allergic patients' immunoglobulin E to each of the individual allergens and grass pollen extract and may thus represent protective antibodies. The principle of increasing the immunogenicity of antigens by engineering hybrids thereof may be applied not only for the treatment of polysensitized allergic patients but also for general vaccine development."

These activities involve interaction of HBx with the DDB1 subunit of UV-damaged DNA-binding factor UV-DDB. UV-DDB consists of DDB1 and a DDB2 subunit that mediates nuclear import and has recognized functions in DNA repair and E2F1-mediated transcription. Here we show that HBx retains DDB1-binding-dependent cytotoxic activities when engineered to accumulate in the nucleus but not when excluded from the nucleus. Nuclear localization of HBx does not require binding to DDB1 and remains unaffected by ectopically expressed UV-DDB subunits, indicating that HBx reaches the nuclear compartment independently of UV-DDB. Unexpectedly, HBx appears to largely exist in association with DDB1 and is in direct competition with DDB2 for binding to DDB1. Hence, HBx-mediated cell death can be relieved by increased levels of DDB2, an effect that is not observed with a naturally occurring mutant of DDB2 that lacks DDB1-binding activity. These findings indicate that HBx acts through a pathway that involves a DDB2-independent nuclear function of DDB1 and that this activity will depend on the relative concentration of DDB1 and DDB2 in cells.

Chronic infection with HBV is associated with a high risk of developing liver cancer. HBV encodes a small regulatory protein called HBx that is well conserved among all mammalian hepatitis viruses. HBx is essential for establishing natural viral infection (1Chen H.S. Kaneko S. Girones R. Anderson R.W. Hornbuckle W.E. Tennant B.C. Cote P.J. Gerin J.L. Purcell R.H. Miller R.H. J.

However, the basis for HBx function in either process is not yet understood. In cell culture, HBx localizes in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, and it behaves as a multifunctional protein affecting transcription, cell cycle control, cell growth, and apoptotic cell death (for reviews, see Refs. 3Arbuthnot P.

Schneider R.J. Science. 2001; 294: 2376-2378Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). However, HBx also has reported nuclear functions. For example, a nuclear location has been shown to be essential for the protein to stimulate transcription of the HBV enhancer I (14Doria M. Klein N. Lucito R. Schneider R.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4747-4757Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). HBx is thought to mediate these various activities through interactions with cellular factors. Indeed, a number of potential cytoplasmic and nuclear targets have been reported to bind HBx, including the DDB1 subunit of the UV-damaged DNA-binding factor (UV-DDB) (15Lee T.H. Elledge S.J. Butel J.S. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1107-1114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Sitterlin D. Lee T.H. Prigent S. Tiollais P. Butel J.S. Transy C. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6194-6199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The functional significance of most of these interactions remains, however, largely elusive. The binding of HBx to DDB1 is essential for HBx to activate transcription (17Sitterlin D. Bergametti F. Transy C. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4417-4426Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and to induce cell death in culture (17Sitterlin D. Bergametti F. Transy C.

Binding to DDB1 is a conserved feature among the mammalian X proteins (16Sitterlin D. Lee T.H. Prigent S. Tiollais P. Butel J.S. Transy C. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6194-6199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and evidence has been presented that this interaction is critical for efficient hepatitis B virus infection in woodchuck (19Sitterlin D.

DDB1 is a 127-kDa protein that associates with DDB2, a cell cycle-regulated, UV-inducible 48-kDa protein that transports DDB1 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (20Hwang B.J. Ford J.M. Hanawalt P.C.

Ong P. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24317-24320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). No mutations in DDB1 have been reported. Interestingly, a role for UV-DDB other than in DNA repair has also been suggested. UV-DDB functionally interacts with the cell cycle transcription factor E2F1 to stimulate transcription of E2F1-regulated genes, suggesting that it plays a role in the cell cycle (23Shiyanov P. Hayes S.A. Donepudi M. Nichols A.F. Linn S. Slagle B.L. Raychaudhuri P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4935-4943Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Although these two known activities depend upon both UV-DDB subunits, the high evolutionary conservation of DDB1, but not of DDB2, suggests that DDB1 might also carry out important functions independently of DDB2 (34Takao M. Abramic M. Moos Jr., M. Otrin V.R. Wootton J.C. McLenigan M. Levine A.S. Protic M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4111-4118Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 35Zolezzi F. Linn S. Gene. 2000; 245: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The mechanism whereby HBx interferes with cell viability upon binding to DDB1 is not understood, nor has the contribution of the cytoplasmic and nuclear fraction of HBx been clearly defined. Several observations argue against HBx exerting its effect simply by sequestering DDB1, and thereby preventing its normal function. Thus, overexpression of DDB1 does not relieve, and under certain experimental settings even enhances, HBx toxicity (17Sitterlin D. Bergametti F. Transy C. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4417-4426Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 18Lin-Marq N. Bontron S. Leupin O. Strubin M. Virology. 2001; 287: 266-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Moreover, Sitterlinet al. (17Sitterlin D. Bergametti F. Transy C. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4417-4426Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) describe a mutant of woodchuck hepatitis virus X protein that exhibits increased DDB1-binding activity yet lacks cytotoxic properties. In a converse experiment we found that a DDB1 binding-defective HBx mutant that cannot interact with endogenous DDB1 regains cytotoxic activities when ectopically fused to DDB1 (18Lin-Marq N. Bontron S. Leupin O. Strubin M. Virology. 2001; 287: 266-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). HBx therefore may act by forcing DDB1 into its physiological function or by conferring new activities to the DDB1 protein. In the present study we demonstrate that HBx induces cell death by acting in association with DDB1 in the nuclear compartment. We also show that HBx and UV-DDB translocate into the nucleus independently, and that HBx and DDB2 compete for interaction with DDB1. Thus, HBx-mediated toxicity can be relieved by increasing the cellular concentration of the DDB2 protein. These findings indicate that HBx acts through a pathway that involves a DDB2-independent nuclear function of DDB1 and that it will do so depending on the relative concentration of DDB1 and DDB2 in the cell. All recombinant DNA work was done according to standard procedures. Details of the plasmid constructions are available upon request. The mammalian expression vectors used in this study were pBJ3, EBS-PL, KEBOB-PL, and pSRαS. Plasmid pBJ3 in which the simian virus 40 (SV40) early enhancer/promoter drives expression was kindly provided by Bruno Amati, DNAX Research Institute, Palo Alto, CA. The episomal Epstein-Barr virus-based expression vector EBS-PL has been described previously (36Bontron S. Ucla C. Mach B. Steimle V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4249-4258Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). It carries a hygromycin resistance-conferring gene and permits expression from the strong SRα promoter (37Takebe Y. Seiki M. Fujisawa J. Hoy P. Yokota K. Arai K. Yoshida M. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 466-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The episomal vector KEBOB-PL is a modified version of EBO-76PL (18Lin-Marq N. Bontron S. Leupin O. Strubin M. Virology. 2001; 287: 266-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). It contains the same SV40 early promoter but carries a kanamycin resistance gene isolated from pUC4K (a generous gift from Dominique Belin, University of Geneva Medical School, Geneva, Switzerland), which replaces the original β-lactamase gene, and a blasticidin resistance gene isolated from pcDNA6/V5-His (Invitrogen) as a selectable marker for mammalian cells in place of the hygromycin resistance gene. Plasmid pSRαS was constructed from pCI-neo (Promega) by replacing the original cytomegalovirus promoter and β-globin/IgG chimeric intron by the SRα promoter and the SV40 late gene (16S) splice junction isolated from pcDL-SRα296 (37Takebe Y. Seiki M. Fujisawa J. Hoy P. Yokota K. Arai K. Yoshida M. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 466-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GFP, produced either from pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH) or from the GFP open reading frame of pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH) cloned into pSRαS, was used as a control to assess for transfection efficiencies. Wild-type HBx and the point mutants HBx(R96E) and HBx(L98F) expressed as native proteins or as N-terminal GFP fusions were described previously (18Lin-Marq N. Bontron S. Leupin O. Strubin M.

This was done by the cloning of a double-stranded oligonucleotide encoding the amino acid sequence MPKKKRKA (the NLS sequence is underlined), thus generating NLS-HBx and NLS-GFP-HBx. Likewise, NES-HBx and NES-GFP-HBx were constructed by fusing the NES motif derived from the human PKIα protein (38Fukuda M. Asano S. Nakamura T. Adachi M. Yoshida M. Yanagida M. Nishida E. Nature. 1997; 390: 308-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar) to HBx and GFP-HBx using oligonucleotides encoding the amino acid sequence MNELALKLAGLDINKA (the NES sequence is underlined). DNA segments encoding full-length DDB1 (34Takao M. Abramic M. Moos Jr., M. Otrin V.R. Wootton J.C. McLenigan M. Levine A.S. Protic M.

Genomics. 1995; 29: 62-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and XIP (40Melegari M. Scaglioni P.P. Wands J.R. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1737-1743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were obtained by reverse transcription-PCR using total RNA derived from the human B lymphoid cell line Raji and primers that introduced convenient restriction endonuclease sites to allow direct subcloning. All PCR fragments were verified by sequence analysis. GFP-DDB1 was constructed by fusing in-frame the GFP coding region excised out of pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH) to the N terminus of the DDB1coding region. The myc-DDB2 variant carries a triple myc epitope at the N terminus and was constructed by inserting three copies of a double-stranded oligonucleotide encoding peptideMEQKLISEEDLHMH (the myc epitope tag is underlined) in front of the DDB2 open reading frame. HA-DDB1 carries a triple HA epitope derived from pBSK-3xHA (a kind gift from Bernard Conrad, University of Geneva Medical School, Geneva, Switzerland) and consists of three reiterations of the peptide sequence GYPYDVPDYA (the HA epitope is underlined) preceded by residues MDV and connected to the N terminus of DDB1 by a GPRSGLET peptide linker. All constructs were verified by sequencing. HeLa and HepG2 were grown at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mml-glutamine, and 10% v/v fetal calf serum (Chemie Brunschwig). For the immunoprecipitation experiments presented in Fig. 3, about 2 × 106 HeLa cells were seeded in an 85-mm plate and transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation method with 2.7 μg of pSRαS-HA-DDB1, 18.7 μg of pSRαS-myc-DDB2, and 18.7 μg of pSRαS-GFP-HBx, or combinations thereof. The total amount of DNA was kept constant in all transfections by supplementing with vector DNA. In all other experiments, HeLa and HepG2 cells were transfected using the FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. When not made as a fusion protein, an expression plasmid for GFP was cotransfected (10% of total DNA). At 24-h post-transfection, cells were trypsinized and a fraction (usually 1/3) was scanned by FACS for GFP fluorescence to assess for transfection efficiencies; transfection efficiencies were generally 50–80% with variations of less than 10% within any single experiment. HeLa and HepG2 cells singly transfected with various KEBOB-PL expression plasmids, or cotransfected with KEBOB-PL constructs together with EBS-PL expression plasmids, were replated at lower density and cultured in appropriate single or double selection media 1 day after transfection. HeLa cells singly transfected with KEBOB-PL expression constructs were selected in medium containing 6 μg/ml blasticidin S (Invitrogen); doubly transfected HeLa cells were selected with 6 μg/ml blasticidin S and 150 μg/ml hygromycin B (Calbiochem). Singly transfected HepG2 cells were selected with 3 μg/ml blasticidin S; doubly transfected HepG2 cells were selected with 2 μg/ml blasticidin S and 200 μg/ml hygromycin B. Drug-resistant cells were stained with crystal violet (Sigma) on the days indicated in the figure legends. Cells were grown on coverslips and transfected. 1–2 days after transfection, cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and stained with 5 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 (Sigma), and coverslips were mounted onto glass slides using Mowiol 4-88 (Calbiochem). Cells were viewed in a Zeiss Axiophot fluorescence microscope equipped with a Plan-Neofluar 40×/1.30 oil objective. Pictures were acquired with an AxioCam color charge-coupled device camera (Zeiss). Cell extracts for Western blot analysis were prepared as described previously (18Lin-Marq N. Bontron S. Leupin O. Strubin M. Virology. 2001; 287: 266-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The coimmunoprecipitation experiments presented in Fig. 3 were performed using whole-cell extracts prepared 24 h after transfection. A total of 2 × 106 HeLa cells was lysed on the plate in 1.5 ml of Nonidet P-40 (Nonidet P-40) lysis buffer (0.1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.6 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride supplemented with a complete protease inhibitor mixture from Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 20 min on ice with gentle agitation. Plates were then scraped, and the crude lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were collected, glycerol was added to a final concentration of 20%, and the samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen prior to storage at −70 °C. HA-DDB1 was immunoprecipitated from 250 μg of whole-cell extracts by incubation with 70 μl of anti-HA affinity matrix (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in a final volume adjusted to 700 μl with lysis buffer. Myc-DDB2 was immunoprecipitated from 50 μg of whole-cell extract in a final volume of 500 μl of lysis buffer using one-fourth of a mixture containing 5 μg of anti-myc (9E10) mouse monoclonal IgG1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) coupled to 20 μl of protein G-agarose. GFP-HBx was immunoprecipitated from 50 μg of whole-cell extract using one-fourth of a mixture containing 20 μg of rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP antibody (Abcam ab290) coupled to 40 μl of protein A-agarose CL-4B. After incubation for 3 h at 4 °C with constant rotation on a rocker, the beads were washed twice in lysis buffer. The beads were then resuspended and boiled in Laemmli buffer. One-half of the supernatant was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (9% polyacrylamide). After separation, the proteins on the gels were transferred to Immobilon P (Millipore) and subjected to immunoblotting as described previously (18Lin-Marq N. Bontron S. Leupin O. Strubin M. Virology. 2001; 287: 266-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Membranes were probed with anti-myc monoclonal antibody (mAb) 9E10, anti-HA mAb 16B12 (BAbCO), anti-GFP mAb (mixture of clones 7.1 and 13.1 from Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and polyclonal rabbit anti-CIITA serum (36Bontron S. Ucla C. Mach B. Steimle V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4249-4258Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Binding of primary antibody was detected with anti-rabbit or anti-mouse immunoglobulin, horseradish peroxidase-linked whole antibody (AmershamBiosciences). Blotted proteins were visualized with Lumi-Light or Lumi-LightPLUS blotting reagents (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Consistent with previous studies, we found that an HBx construct bearing an N-terminal enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) localizes in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus of HeLa cells, with a substantial fraction residing in the nucleus (Fig.1 A). A similar subcellular distribution of GFP-HBx was observed in the human hepatoblastoma cell line HepG2 (data not shown). To determine in which cellular compartment HBx manifests cytotoxic activities, we engineered HBx and GFP-HBx derivatives containing either a nuclear localization signal (NLS) or a nuclear export signal (NES) at the N terminus. As shown in Fig. 1 A, the presence of an NLS causes efficient nuclear accumulation of GFP-HBx, whereas an NES virtually excludes it from the nucleus. We then examined the proteins for their ability to suppress cell colony formation, a property documented to reflect HBx potential to induce cell death by apoptosis (41Chirillo P. Pagano S. Natoli G. Puri P.L. Burgio V.L. Balsano C. Levrero M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8162-8167Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 42Kim H. Lee H. Yun Y. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4848-4859Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Remarkably, Fig.1 B reveals that HBx targeted to the nucleus is able to inhibit colony formation to the same extent as the native protein, whereas it displays no obvious activity when excluded from the nucleus. This points to the nuclear fraction of wild-type HBx as being responsible for mediating cell death. We also assessed whether nuclear targeting by fusion to an NLS would restore activity to the DDB1 binding-defective HBx(R96E) point mutant. This is not the case (Fig.1 B), nor does nuclear targeting confer cytotoxic properties to DDB1 in the absence of HBx (data not shown). These results indicate that the need for an interaction between HBx and DDB1 for HBx cytotoxicity is not solely to allow one protein to promote nuclear import of the other. We thus conclude that HBx must form a complex with DDB1 in the nucleus to exert its deleterious activities. The finding that HBx acts in association with DDB1 in the nucleus prompted us to investigate whether overexpression of DDB1, which has been implicated in the nuclear localization of HBx (17Sitterlin D. Bergametti F. Transy C. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4417-4426Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), or DDB2, which promotes nuclear import of DDB1 (23Shiyanov P. Hayes S.A. Donepudi M. Nichols A.F. Linn S. Slagle B.L. Raychaudhuri P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4935-4943Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), would induce a change in the cellular distribution of HBx. We therefore transfected GFP-HBx alone or with either DDB1 or DDB2 into HeLa cells under conditions where the UV-DDB subunits are produced from an expression vector carrying a strong promoter. As can be seen in the upper panel of Fig.2 A, the nucleocytoplasmic distribution of GFP-HBx is not noticeably affected by cotransfection with either DDB1 or DDB2. Yet under the same experimental conditions DDB2 efficiently increases accumulation of an N-terminal GFP variant of DDB1 in the nucleus (Fig. 2 A, lower panel). These results suggest that nuclear compartmentalization of HBx does not depend on DDB. If so, one would predict that HBx derivatives compromised for interaction with DDB1 should remain fully capable of nuclear entry. To determine if this is indeed the case, we examined the subcellular distribution of two HBx point mutants, HBx(R96E) and HBx(L98F), that are selectively defective for DDB1 binding (18Lin-Marq N. Bontron S. Leupin O. Strubin M. Virology. 2001; 287: 266-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Fig.2 B shows that the mutants expressed as fusions to GFP exhibit the same preferential nuclear localization as the wild-type protein, with GFP-HBx(L98F) actually being mostly nuclear, perhaps as a result of the mutation also impairing the reported NES function of HBx (44Forgues M.

Thus, nuclear accumulation of HBx does not correlate with its binding to DDB1. Taken together, these results support the notion that HBx and DDB1 must from a complex in the nucleus to mediate cytotoxic activities, yet translocate into the nuclear compartment independently. The two known activities in which DDB1 has been implicated, damaged DNA binding and stimulation of E2F1-activated transcription, both require its association with DDB2 in the nucleus (23Shiyanov P.

Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1159-1168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This may indicate that HBx functions in a complex with the DDB1·DDB2 dimer. However, we failed to obtain any evidence that HBx and DDB2 can form a ternary complex with DDB1 (data not shown). This led us to examine whether HBx and DDB2 might instead bind to DDB1 in a mutually exclusive fashion. To test this possibility, we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments to assess whether HBx and DDB2 would interfere with each other for binding to limiting amounts of DDB1. For this purpose, we constructed N-terminally epitope-tagged HA-DDB1 and myc-DDB2 proteins, which behave like wild-type (data not shown). Plasmids expressing HA-DDB1, myc-DDB2, and GFP-HBx were transiently transfected into HeLa cells, either in pairwise combinations or all three together. In these experiments we transfected 5-fold less HA-DDB1 to ensure that myc-DDB2 and GFP-HBx are produced in excess over HA-DDB1. Whole-cell extracts were prepared, HA-DDB1 was immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA antibody, and proteins present in the extract before or after immunoprecipitation were detected by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig.3 A, the proteins were expressed at comparable levels in all the transfected cells (inputs panel in Fig. 3 A, compare lanes 1 to 4), and equal amounts of HA-DDB1 are precipitated from the relevant lysates (IP panel in Fig. 3 A). Coimmunoprecipitated myc-DDB2 and GFP-HBx are detected with extracts from HA-DDB1-expressing cells but not from control cells (CO-IP panel in Fig. 3 A). Importantly, however, the amount of myc-DDB2 and GFP-HBx that coimmunoprecipitates with HA-DDB1 is modestly but consistently reduced when both proteins are expressed along with HA-DDB1 (CO-IP panel in Fig. 3 A, comparelane 3 with lanes 1 and 2). These results are consistent with HBx and DDB2 competing for binding to DDB1. We also performed the reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation experiments to evaluate the amount of HA-DDB1 protein that coimmunoprecipitates with myc-DDB2 and GFP-HBx from these extracts. One would expect that the binding of one protein to DDB1 would limit the amount of DDB1 available to interact with the other. Fig. 3 (B and C) show that this is indeed the case. The HA-DDB1 protein is detected in all the relevant myc-DDB2 and GFP-HBx immunoprecipitates, but the amount recovered from extracts containing both proteins is reduced compared with the amount observed with extracts containing either pro"
https://openalex.org/W2168859732,"The concept that adipocytes belong to an essential endocrine system with some characteristics of immune cells has recently emerged. The aim of this paper is to present evidence of the expression of CD4, CXCR4, and CCR5 receptors by human adipocytes and to test whether adipose cells support HIV entry. Primary human preadipocytes were cultured and differentiated in vitro. Expression of the three receptors on preadipocytes and adipocytes was demonstrated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, immunocytochemical, and immunohistochemical analysis. Infection of adipose cells to HIV-1 was then investigated. The measurement of the viral p24 antigen in preadipocyte culture medium showed an increase of p24 levels between 24 and 72 h postexposure and then a progressive decrease to reach a low level at 10-15 days. Ten days after the infection test, supernatant of preadipocytes contained infectious particles able to infect the susceptible T-CD4 CEM cell line. The expression of viral proteins by adipocytes was confirmed using a fusion test. The presence of viral DNA was exhibited by gag-specific polymerase chain reaction, supporting the hypothesis of HIV-1 X4- and R5-virus entry in preadipocytes. Adipose cells represent the first cell type that does not belong to the immune system expressing all specific HIV receptors and may represent new HIV-1 target cells."

This enhancement of genotoxicity did not occur when the inactive C145A mutant of human AGT (hAGT) was used. Also, hAGT did not enhance the genotoxicity of S-(2-haloethyl)glutathiones that mimic the reactive product of the reaction of DBE with glutathione, which is catalyzed by glutathione S-transferase. These experiments support a mechanism by which hAGT activates DBE. Studies in vitro showed a direct reaction between purified recombinant hAGT and DBE resulting in a loss of AGT repair activity and a formation of an hAGT-DBE conjugate at Cys145. A 2-hydroxyethyl adduct was found by mass spectrometry to be present in the Gly136-Arg147 peptide from tryptic digests of AGT reacted with DBE. Incubation of AGT with DBE and oligodeoxyribonucleotides led to the formation of covalent AGT-oligonucleotide complexes. These results indicate that DBE reacts at the active site of AGT to generate an S-(2-bromoethyl) intermediate, which forms a highly reactive half-mustard at Cys145. In the presence of DNA, the DNA-binding function of AGT facilitates formation of DNA adducts. In the absence of DNA, the intermediate undergoes hydrolytic decomposition to form AGT-Cys145-SCH2CH2OH.

The major product of this reaction isS-[2-(N 7-guanyl)ethyl]glutathione, but N 2- and O 6-guanyl adducts are also formed, and all three adducts are potentially mutagenic (29Kim M.-S. Guengerich F.P.

AGT is not an enzyme but acts in a stoichiometric manner to bind to DNA and transfers the alkyl group from the O 6 position of guanine to a cysteine residue on the protein (1Lindahl T. Sedgwick B.

It is possible that AGT recognizes a DNA adduct generated from DBE by the action of P450s or GSTs but fails to repair it correctly and actually increases its mutagenic and toxic effects. There are some precedents for this with other types of DNA damage. First, AGT can become cross-linked to DNA that has been treated with 1,3-bis(chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea in vitro (32Gonzaga P.E. Potter P.M. Niu T., Yu, D. Ludlum D.B. Rafferty J.A. Margison G.P. Brent T.P. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 6052-6058PubMed Google Scholar, 33Gonzaga P.E. Harris L. Margison G.P. Brent T.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3961-3966Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This occurs because of the reaction of AGT with the cyclic adduct 1,O 6-ethanoguanine. Attack by the AGT protein on the carbon of the ethane linkage attached to theO 6 position leads to the AGT protein becoming covalently bound to the DNA via a 1-(guan-1-yl)-2-(cysteine-S-yl)ethane linkage. Second, it is known that even non-covalent binding of AGT to DNA lesions can enhance their genotoxicity. Thus, hAGT binds toO 4-methylthymine in DNA but repairs this lesion very slowly and actually increases mutations caused byO 4-methylthymine by preventing their repair by other pathways (34Samson L. Han S. Marquis J.C. Rasmussen L.J. Carcinogenesis. 1997; 18: 919-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). A similar phenomenon was found to occur when the C145A mutant of hAGT was expressed in E. coli. This mutant cannot repair O 6-methylguanine, because the Cys145 acceptor site is lost but its binding to methylated DNA in cells exposed toN-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine increases both mutations and decreases cell survival due to shielding of the O 6-methylguanine from other repair pathways (35Edara S. Kanugula S. Pegg A.E. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, this second pathway is rendered unlikely, because the AGT-mediated increased toxicity of DBE was abolished when cells were treated with O 6-benzylguanine that inactivates AGT by forming S-benzylcysteine at the active site (9Abril N. Luque-Romero L. Christians F.C. Encell L.P. Loeb L. Pueyo C. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 2089-2094Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 10Liu H., Xu- Welliver M. Pegg A.E. Mutat. Res. 2000; 452: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that the alkyl transfer function of the AGT protein is needed. Another possible mechanism for AGT to mediate toxicity of DBE would be for the protein to act in the same way as GST and convert DBE to a low molecular weight reactive intermediate that is then released and can diffuse away and react with cellular components. However, this possibility is argued against by the findings that hAGT mutants having mutations in the DNA binding domain were not able to activate DBE (10Liu H., Xu- Welliver M. Pegg A.E. Mutat. Res. 2000; 452: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The studies to date, which have all been carried out in vivo, suggested that a functional AGT being able to bind to DNA is essential to observe the increased toxicity of DBE. In the experiments described in this report, we have studied the reaction of hAGT and relevant mutants with DBE and 2-bromoethanol (BE) in vitro. We have obtained evidence that supports a model in which DBE reacts at the active site of AGT to generate a reactive intermediate at Cys145, and this then forms a covalent AGT adduct in DNA. This is a novel mechanism for the formation of genotoxic damage in which the DNA-binding function of the AGT protein facilitates formation of DNA adducts from a reactive intermediate. DBE and BE were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). Isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, ampicillin, kanamycin, and reagents used in bacterial culture were obtained from Sigma. [14C]DBE (111 mCi/mmol), adenosine 5′-[γ-35S]thiotriphosphate, triethyl ammonium salt ([γ-35S]ATPγS), and [14C]methylated protein molecular weight markers were purchased from AmershamBiosciences (Piscataway, NJ). T4 polynucleotide kinase (PNK) was from New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA). All oligodeoxyribonucleotides were synthesized by Invitrogen (Gaithersburg, MD). The 18-mer 5′-d(TGCTG*CAAGGGTACCGAG)-3′ containing anS-[2-(O 6-ethylguanyl)]glutathione at the G* site were synthesized and purified as described previously (36Kim M.-S. Guengerich F.P. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 1133-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). S-(2-Fluroethyl)glutathione andS-(2-chloroethyl)glutathione were synthesized and purified as described as indicated previously (37Humphreys W.G. Kim D.-H. Cmarik J.L. Shimada T. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10342-10350Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). [3H]Methylated calf thymus DNA (ctDNA) was prepared by reaction ofN-[3H]methyl-N-nitrosourea (18.8 mCi/mmol from Amersham Biosciences) with ctDNA as described previously (38Dolan M.E. Moschel R.C. Pegg A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5368-5372Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 39Dolan M.E. Pegg A.E. Dumenco L.L. Moschel R.C. Gerson S.L. Carcinogenesis. 1991; 12: 2305-2310Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The TRG8 cells were derived from GWR109 cells by selection for cells with an altered cell membrane to allow greater permeability for exogenous chemicals (40Xu-Welliver M. Kanugula S. Pegg A.E. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1936-1945PubMed Google Scholar). Wild type hAGT, C145A mutant in pIN vector, and the empty pIN vectors were transformed into TRG8 cells by standard electroporation procedures as described previously (10Liu H., Xu- Welliver M. Pegg A.E. Mutat. Res. 2000; 452: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). TRG8 cells were grown under ampicillin and kanamycin selection. Recombinant C-terminal histidine-tagged wild type hAGT, AGT C145S mutant and N-terminal histidine-tagged spermine synthase were cloned in a pQE30 vector and expressed in XL1-blue cells and purified as described previously (41Liu L., Xu- Welliver M. Kanugula S. Pegg A.E. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 3037-3043PubMed Google Scholar). TRG8 cells were grown in 5 ml of Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin and kanamycin and 0.2 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside until the optical density of the bacterial culture reached 0.5 at 600 nm. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in 1× M9 minimal salts. Aliquots (0.5 ml) of the cell suspension were treated with 0–0.1 mm of DBE, BE, or Me2SO vehicle with shaking at 37 °C for 0–90 min. The cells were pelleted, washed with 1 ml, and resuspended in 0.5 ml of 1× M9 salt solution after the treatment. The cell suspensions (100 μl, in 1:106 dilution) were plated on M9 minimal plates supplemented with 0.4% glucose (w/v), 40 μg/ml histidine, 50 μg/ml ampicillin, and 50 μg/ml kanamycin for survival measurement. Undiluted cell suspensions (100 μl) were plated on M9 minimal plates not supplemented with histidine for the measurement of hisrevertants. The number of colonies on the plates was counted after incubating at 37 °C for 36–40 h. The survival rate of DBE- or BE-treated cells was expressed as a percentage of survival compared with vehicle-treated cells. The mutation frequency was calculated by the number of his revertants over 108 survivors grown on M9 minimal plates provided with histidine. For the TRG8 pIN and pINAGT cells exposed toS-(2-fluoroethyl)glutathione, they were treated with three concentrations of 0–10 mm agent made freshly in 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Aliquots of the compound were added at 0, 10, and 20 min, and the entire treatment lasted for 30 min. For S-(2-chloroethyl)glutathione treatment, TRG8 was exposed to a single concentration of 0–5 mm chemical for 30 min. Lethality and mutagenicity of these two compounds were measured as described above for treatment with DBE. Wild type hAGT (20 ng) was incubated with 0–5 mm DBE, BE, or vehicle Me2SO for varying lengths of times at 37 °C in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 0.1 mmEDTA, and 20 μg/ml hemocyanin in the presence or absence of 40 μg/ml ctDNA. Residual alkyltransferase activity of hAGT protein was examined by a 30-min reaction measuring the removal of3H-labeled methyl adducts fromO 6-guanine in ctDNA (38Dolan M.E. Moschel R.C. Pegg A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5368-5372Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 39Dolan M.E. Pegg A.E. Dumenco L.L. Moschel R.C. Gerson S.L. Carcinogenesis. 1991; 12: 2305-2310Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). AGT activity was expressed as the percentage of the alkyltransferase activity remaining over that of Me2SO-treated protein. Wild type hAGT or C145S mutant (1–40 μg) in AGT buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.6) and 0.1 mm EDTA was incubated with 0–25 mm DBE in a final volume of 50 μl at 37 °C for 0–30 min. A stock solution of DBE consisting of [14C]DBE (111 mCi/mmol) and unlabeled DBE (1:11,w/w) was diluted in 5 volumes of Me2SO (and further with H2O). Five milliliters of 20 mm Tris (pH 8.4), 200 mm NaCl, and 8m urea was added to the incubation at the end of the reaction. The mixtures were then filtered through 0.45-μm nitrocellulose filters (Millipore). Free DBE was removed by washing with 2 × 5 ml of 10% ethanol and 2 × 5 ml 80% ethanol. AGT protein was retained on the filters, and 14C radioactivity on the protein was determined using a Beckman scintillation counter (Beckman, Fullerton, CA). Under the conditions used, the recovery of hAGT on the filters was >95%. There was a negligible nonspecific binding of [14C]DBE, which amounted to less than 10 pmol in the absence of hAGT. The molar ratio of DBE bound to hAGT was calculated from the incorporated radioactivity and plotted as a function of hAGT present. Assays were also carried out to measure the rate of this reaction by varying the time of incubation and the amount of DBE added. Oligonucleotide 16-mers were labeled at the 5′-end with [γ-35S]ATPγS using PNK. T4 PNK (2 units) and 10 μg of oligonucleotides were incubated with 1× PNK buffer (70 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 10 mmMgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol) and 8 μl of [γ-35S]ATPγS at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by heating at 68 °C for 20 min. The labeled 16-mers were separated from [γ-35S]ATPγS using MicroSpin G-25 columns (Amersham Biosciences). Radioactivity in the 16-mers was analyzed by autoradiography and scintillation counting. The hAGT, C145S, or spermine synthase protein (2 μg) was incubated in a 10-μl assay volume with 20 mm DBE or BE, 6.5 pmol of35S-labeled oligonucleotide, and 20 pmol of unlabeled oligonucleotides in AGT buffer at 37 °C for 60 min. SDS solution (1 μl of 10%) and 2 μl of 5× SDS-PAGE sample buffer (250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 100 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 10% SDS, 0.5% bromphenol blue, and 50% glycerol) were then added to the mixtures and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. The mixtures were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue and destained before they were dried. Intensities of oligonucleotide bands were examined using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager SI and ImageQuaNT application software, and the amounts of the oligonucleotide converted to lower mobility forms were determined from these measurements. An 18-mer 5′-d(TGCTG*CAAGGGTACCGAG)-3′ and the derivative containingS-[2-(O 6-ethylguanyl)]glutathione at the G* site were synthesized, purified, and 5′-end-labeled as described previously (36Kim M.-S. Guengerich F.P. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 1133-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The 32P-oligonucleotide (30 fmol) was incubated with or without 30 pmol of AGT in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm EDTA for 30 min at 37 °C in a 23-μl reaction volume. Ten μl of 1% SDS and 20 μl of 90% formamide were added to stop the reaction. The mixture was resolved on a 20% acrylamide gel (38 cm × 53 cm × 0.35 mm) with 8m urea at 2200 V for 5 h. The gel was then dried and analyzed with a PhosphorImager (29Kim M.-S. Guengerich F.P. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1998; 11: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The migration of the unmodified 18-mer was about 12 cm, and that of the modified oligonucleotide was about 13.5 cm. Wild type and C145S hAGT protein (80 μg) were incubated with 20 mm DBE or BE in AGT buffer at 37 °C for 1 h. Trypsin (50 μg) was added to unreacted AGT protein or the reaction mixtures and the trypsin digestion was carried out in 100 mm (NH4)2CO3(pH 8.0) overnight with shaking at 37 °C. MALDI-TOF spectra were recorded over a range of m/z250–6800 on a PerSeptive Voyager Elite instrument in the positive reflector mode (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA). The accelerating voltage, grid voltage, and guide wire voltages were 20,000 V, 74.5%, and 0.05%, respectively. A 10 mg/ml solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in CH3CN:2% aqueous CF3CO2H (60:40, v/v) was used as the matrix. Samples used for MALDI analysis were diluted in 0.1% CF3CO2H (v/v) and then desalted with ZipTipC18 pipette tips (Millipore, Milford MA). Bradykinin and insulin were used as external references. Electrospray ionization-MS studies were performed on a Finnigan TSQ-7000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (San Jose, CA) equipped with a standard API-1 electrospray ionization source with a deactivated fused silica capillary, heated to 200 °C. The tube lens voltage was set to 80 V. N2 was used as the sheath gas (70 p.s.i.) and as the auxiliary gas (10 p.s.i.). Spectra were acquired in the positive ion mode with a needle voltage of 4 kV. For MS/MS experiments, daughter ions were generated using −35-eV collision-induced dissociation. The autosampler and high performance liquid chromatography system consisted of an Alliance 2690 Separations Module from Waters (Millford, MA). A Zorbax Rx octylsilane (C8) column (2.1 × 150 mm) (MacMod, Chadds Ford, PA) was used for the LC/MS experiments. 20-μl aliquots of samples were injected, and a 0.2 ml/min flow rate was maintained. Solvent A was 0.1% formic acid in water, and solvent B was acetonitrile. The gradient was the following: 95% A and 5% B at time zero, 95% A and 5% B at 5 min, 50% A and 50% B at 50 min 10% A and 90% B at 55 min, 10% A and 90% B at 60 min, 95% A and 5% B at 62 min, and 95% A and 5% B at 70 min. Previous studies have shown that the expression of hAGT inE. coli TRG8 cells lacking endogenous alkyltransferase greatly increased the genotoxicity of exposure to 1 mm DBE (10Liu H., Xu- Welliver M. Pegg A.E. Mutat. Res. 2000; 452: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). A more detailed investigation of the time course and concentration dependence of this effect confirmed and extended these findings (Fig. 1). Genotoxicity and mutagenicity of DBE increased significantly as the treatment was extended from 15 to 90 min (Fig. 1, A and B) and as the DBE dose was increased to 0.1 mm (Fig. 1,C and D). After 90-min exposure to 0.1 mm DBE, killing of >98% of the cells was observed with ∼1800 mutants in 108 survivors. The DNA repair-inactive hAGT C145A mutant and transfection with the empty pIN vector were completely ineffective in bringing about these increases with <5% cell killing and <10 mutants in 108 survivors (Fig. 1,A–D). The C145A mutant is known to be able to bind toO 6-methylguanine and protect it from repair by other pathways (35Edara S. Kanugula S. Pegg A.E. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and this result therefore provides further support to the hypothesis that the enhanced toxicity of DBE is not due to shielding of DBE-induced lesions by AGT binding. In contrast to the results with DBE, 2-bromoethanol (BE), a P450-derived metabolite of DBE (16van Bladeren P.J. Breimer D.D. van Huijgevoort J.A.T.C.M. Vermeulen N.P.E. van der Gen A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1981; 30: 2499-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), was not cytotoxic at levels up to 0.5 mm irrespective of AGT content and produced only a minuscule increase in mutations in hAGT-expressing cells with less than 20 mutants in 108 survivors at 0.1 mm BE (Fig.1, E and F). The presence of hAGT did not enhance (and in fact slightly protected against) the genotoxicity of compounds analogous to those produced by the activation of DBE by GST (Fig.2). The results of treatment withS-(2-fluoroethyl)glutathione, a surrogate of the DBE reaction intermediate with glutathione catalyzed by GST (26Wheeler J.B. Stourman N.V. Armstrong R.N. Guengerich F.P. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2001; 14: 1107-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), are shown in Fig. 2 (A and B). Exposure to 10 mm S-(2-fluoroethyl)glutathione reduced cell survival to less than 6%. The presence of hAGT produced a modest level of protection from killing, but the differences in hAGT-positive and -negative cells were not statistically different (p > 0.05) as examined by a pairwise t test. Treatment withS-(2-fluoroethyl)glutathione was only weakly mutagenic in the TRG8 strain leading to no more than 40 his revertants per 108 surviving cells. Expression of hAGT slightly decreased the numbers of mutants at doses of 0.5–3 mm S-(2-fluoroethyl)glutathione (Fig. 2 B). Essentially similar results were obtained withS-(2-chloroethyl)glutathione. The toxicity of this agent was reduced by the presence of hAGT with >90% survival in the presence of hAGT compared with 20% in its absence after exposure to 5 mm S-(2-chloroethyl)glutathione (Fig.2 C). Similarly, a 30-min exposure to 5 mm S-(2-chloroethyl)glutathione caused ∼125 mutants per 108 surviving cells in control cells compared with only 50 mutants per 108 survivors in TRG8 cells expressing hAGT (Fig. 2 D). These results show clearly that the striking enhancement of DBE toxicity mediated via hAGT expression seen in Fig. 1 is not mediated by interactions with DNA lesions caused by GST-derived metabolites. The slight protection against mutagenesis seen in Fig. 2 may be due to the ability of hAGT to repair the bulkyO 6-alkylguanine lesion produced by the glutathione half-mustard. As shown in Fig.3,S-[2-(O 6-ethylguanyl)]glutathione is a substrate for hAGT. Incubation of an 18-mer oligonucleotide containing this adduct with excess hAGT resulted in the partial removal of the lesion. The possibility that hAGT reacts directly with DBE to generate a reactive intermediate that is responsible for the increased genotoxicity was examined in vitro using purified recombinant hAGT and its C145S mutant. The proteins were purified to homogeneity using a C-terminal histidine tag (41Liu L., Xu- Welliver M. Kanugula S. Pegg A.E. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 3037-3043PubMed Google Scholar). Studies were carried out to determine whether or not hAGT reacts directly with DBE and BE, the effect of this reaction on hAGT alkyltransferase activity and the nature of the product formed in the reaction. The results showed a direct reaction between hAGT and DBE. The DNA repair activity of hAGT was inactivated by DBE in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Fig.4). This reaction was retarded by addition of ctDNA to the reaction (Fig. 4 A). The ED50 values for DBE were 1.1 and 3.2 mm, respectively, in the absence and presence of ctDNA, suggesting that hAGT in a DNA-bound form may become less reactive with DBE. Exposure to BE also produced a dose-dependent inhibition of alkyltransferase activity of hAGT with an ED50 of 2.2 mm (Fig. 4 A). The hAGT inactivation by 5 mm DBE or BE appeared to be a first order time-dependent reaction under these conditions where DBE is in a vast excess (Fig. 4 B). To investigate whether the hAGT inhibition by DBE involved a DBE-AGT conjugation and the role of alkyl acceptor Cys145 residue in the reaction, hAGT or the C145S mutant was incubated with"
https://openalex.org/W2056711252,"Gene therapy in eukaryotes has met many obstacles. Research into the design of suitable nonviral vectors has been slow. To our knowledge, no nonviral vector has been proposed that allows for the possibility of highly efficient, site-selective integration into the genome of mammalian cells. On the basis of prior studies investigating the components necessary for transposon, retrovirus-like retrotransposon, and retroviral integration, we propose a nonviral system that would potentially allow for site-selective, efficient integration into the mammalian genome. Transposons have been developed that can transform a variety of cell lines. For example, the Sleeping Beauty transposon (SB) can transform a wide range of vertebrate cells from fish to human, and it mediates stable integration and long-term transgene expression in mice. However, the efficiency of transposition varies significantly among cell lines, suggesting the possible involvement of host factors in SB transposition. Here, we propose the use of a chimeric transposase (i.e., transposase-host DNA binding domain) to bypass the potential requirement of a host DNA-directing factor (or factors) for efficient, site-selective integration. We also discuss another potential method of docking the transposon-based vector adjacent to the host DNA, utilizing repetitive sequences for homologous recombination to promote efficient site-selective integration, as well as other site-selective nonviral approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2147208871,"We have previously shown that the engagement of ICAM-1 on brain endothelial cells (EC) results in the propagation of EC signaling pathways that are necessary for efficient lymphocyte migration across the tight vascular barriers of the brain. Signaling via this receptor alone, however, is unlikely to explain the differential recruitment of leukocytes at different vascular beds. In this study, we investigated the role of EC heterotrimeric G-protein-mediated signaling in supporting transendothelial migration of T lymphocytes. Treatment of brain EC monolayers with pertussis toxin (PTX) resulted in ADP-ribosylation of G-protein alpha subunits and inhibition (>80%) of lymphocyte migration without affecting lymphocyte adhesion. Aortic and high endothelial venule EC treated identically resulted in only partial inhibition of lymphocyte migration (<40%). Expression of ribosylation-resistant (PTX-insensitive) G-protein alpha subunits in brain EC restored their ability to support lymphocyte migration after pretreatment with PTX. Treatment of brain EC with PTX did not inhibit ICAM-1-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase, suggesting the effects of PTX in inhibiting EC facilitation of lymphocyte migration are distinct from activation of EC through ICAM-1. We conclude that a heterotrimeric G-protein-mediated signaling pathway in brain EC is essential for efficient transendothelial migration of T lymphocytes into the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2087123494,"Light-absorption spectra and afferent chemoreceptor discharge were simultaneously recorded on superfused rat carotid bodies (CBs) under the influence of cytochrome a3-CuB ligands (O2, CN-, CO) in order to identify the primary mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) oxygen sensor. Spectra could be described on the basis of weighted light-absorption spectra of cytochrome b558 of the NAD(P)H oxidase and mitochondrial cytochromes b and c, CCO, cytochrome a3, and an unusual cytochrome a peaking at 592 nm. Discharge signals were deconvoluted into phasic and tonic activity for comparing different CB responses. The spectral weight of cytochrome a592 decreased significantly starting at high PO2 (100 mm Hg) and low sodium cyanide (CN-, 10 mM) accompanied by increasing phasic peak discharge. Combined CO-hypoxia or CO-CN- application inhibited photolysis of CO-stimulated chemoreceptor discharge, revealing photometrically cytochrome a592 as central in oxygen sensing. Control spectra in tissue from sympathetic and nodose ganglia did not show any cytochrome a592 contribution. According to these results, cytochrome a592 is assumed as a unique component of CB CCO, revealing in contrast to other cytochromes an apparent low PO2 and high CN- affinity, probably due to a shortcut of electron flow within CCO between CuA and cytochrome a3-CuB."
https://openalex.org/W2046275810,"In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, DNA topoisomerases I and II can functionally substitute for each other in removing positive and negative DNA supercoils. Yeast Δtop1 top2(ts) mutants grow slowly and present structural instability in the genome; over half of the rDNA repeats are excised in the form of extrachromosomal rings, and small circular minichromosomes strongly multimerize. Because these traits can be reverted by the extrachromosomal expression of either eukaryotic topoisomerase I or II, their origin is attributed to the persistence of unconstrained DNA supercoiling. Here, we examine whether the expression of the Escherichia coli topA gene, which encodes the bacterial topoisomerase I that removes only negative supercoils, compensates the phenotype of Δtop1 top2(ts) yeast cells. We found that Δtop1 top2(ts) mutants expressing E. colitopoisomerase I grow faster and do not manifest rDNA excision and minichromosome multimerization. Furthermore, the recombination frequency in repeated DNA sequences, which is increased by nearly two orders of magnitude in Δtop1 top2(ts) mutants relative to the parental TOP+ cells, is restored to normal levels when the bacterial topoisomerase is expressed. These results indicate that the suppression of mitotic hyper-recombination caused by eukaryotic topoisomerases I and II is effected mainly by the relaxation of negative rather than positive supercoils; they also highlight the potential of unconstrained negative supercoiling to promote homologous recombination.

Topoisomerase II is essential for cell viability because it is required to unlink intertwined pairs of replicated DNA domains at the time of mitosis (3DiNardo S. Voelkel K. Sternglanz R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2616-2620Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Another important role of topoisomerases is to prevent excessive supercoiling of DNA (4Saavedra R.A. Huberman J.A. Cell. 1986; 45: 65-70Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 5Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6659-6662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast topoisomerase I efficiently relaxes the positive and negative DNA supercoils generated, respectively, in front of and behind the molecular ensembles that track along the double helix (6Liu L.F. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7024-7027Crossref PubMed Scopus (1508) Google Scholar, 7Giaever G.N. Wang J.C. Cell. 1988; 55: 849-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 8Kim R.A. Wang J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 208: 257-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Because yeast null top1mutants are viable (9Thrash C. Bankier A.T. Barrell B.G. Sternglanz R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4374-4378Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 10Goto T. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7178-7182Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), the cellular roles of topoisomerase I must be fulfilled by yeast topoisomerase II, which is also efficient in the relaxation of positive and negative supercoils (Fig.1). Conversely, the less abundant topoisomerase III does not have significant effects on the overall supercoiling of intracellular DNA (11Kim R.A. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17178-17185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Genetic and biochemical studies have revealed that the DNA relaxation activity of yeast topoisomerases I and II has deep implications in genome stabilization (5Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6659-6662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Wang J.C. Caron P.R. Kim R.A. Cell. 1990; 62: 403-406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Null top1 mutants have a high frequency of mitotic recombination in the rDNA cluster relative toTOP+ cells (13Christman M.F. Dietrich F.S. Fink G.R. Cell. 1988; 55: 413-425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Single top2(ts) mutants, in which the weak topoisomerase II activity is abolished at 35 °C, also show increased recombination in the rDNA (13Christman M.F. Dietrich F.S. Fink G.R. Cell. 1988; 55: 413-425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) when grown at a permissive temperature (26 °C). More striking features of genome instability are observed in Δtopl top2(ts) double mutants (Fig.2). In these cells, over half of the rDNA genes are excised in the form of extrachromosomal rings, which contain one or more copies of the 9-kb rDNA unit (14Kim R.A. Wang J.C. Cell. 1989; 57: 975-985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), and small circular minichromosomes form broad distributions of multimers, which consist of tandemly repeated copies of their monomeric sequences (15Trigueros S. Roca J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2243-2258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). These traits, probably mediated by homologous recombination, have been attributed to excessive supercoiling of DNA (12Wang J.C. Caron P.R. Kim R.A. Cell. 1990; 62: 403-406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 14Kim R.A. Wang J.C. Cell. 1989; 57: 975-985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 15Trigueros S. Roca J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2243-2258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Whereas inΔtopl or top2(ts) single mutants the presence of either topoisomerase II or I suffices to relax DNA, supercoils persist longer in the double mutant because of the limited activity of topoisomerase II available at 26 °C. The formation of extrachromosomal rDNA rings and the multimerization of circular minichromosomes can be reverted by the extrachromosomal expression of yeast topoisomerase I or II (14Kim R.A. Wang J.C. Cell. 1989; 57: 975-985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 15Trigueros S. Roca J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2243-2258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Because these enzymes are structurally different, only their common ability to relax DNA supercoils can account for the suppression of the instability traits. Here we investigate whether the positive or the negative supercoiling of DNA differentially determine the genetic instability found in topoisomerase-deficient cells. We examined the phenotype of Δtopl top2(ts) mutants supplemented by the extrachromosomal expression of the S. cerevisiaetopoisomerase I, the S. cerevisiae topoisomerase II, and theEscherichia coli topoisomerase I. Unlike the yeast topoisomerases I and II, which relax positive and negative supercoils,E. coli topoisomerase I is a type IA enzyme that normally removes only negative supercoils (16Wang J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 55: 523-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Previous studies have demonstrated that it can be expressed and that it is active in yeast cells (7Giaever G.N. Wang J.C. Cell. 1988; 55: 849-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 8Kim R.A. Wang J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 208: 257-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). We report that the compensations achieved by expressing the E. coli DNA topoisomerase I are comparable with those attained with the yeast topoisomerases I and II. These observations reveal that genetic instability in topoisomerase-deficient cells is mainly a result of the failure to relax the negative rather than the positive supercoiling of intracellular DNA. Yeast strains were originally obtained from the laboratory of James C. Wang (Harvard University). All strains are derivatives of FY251 (MATahis3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1 trp1-Δ63 ura3–52). JCW26 (top2–4), harboring a thermosensitive mutation in the TOP2 gene, was derived by one-step gene replacement (17Rothstein R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (2026) Google Scholar). JCW27 (Δtop1) and JCW28 (Δtop1 top2–4) were derived from FY251 and JCW26, respectively, by the hit-and-run system of gene replacement to create a null mutation in the TOP1 gene (18Roca J. Gartenberg M.R. Oshima Y. Wang J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4671-4672Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Yeast cells were grown in synthetic selective or rich medium (19Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2543) Google Scholar), and cell transformations were done by the lithium acetate method (20Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids YEptopA-PGAL1, pRK-G1T1, and YEpTOP2GAL1 were provided by James C. Wang (Harvard University). YEptopA-PGAL1 (7Giaever G.N. Wang J.C. Cell. 1988; 55: 849-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) contains the topA gene (coding for E. coli topoisomerase I) downstream of the yeast PGAL1 promoter, the 2μ plasmid origin of replication, and theURA3 marker. pRK-G1T1 (14Kim R.A. Wang J.C. Cell. 1989; 57: 975-985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) derives from the single-copy yeast vector YCp50 and expresses the yeast TOP1 gene from the galactose-inducible yeast promoter pGAL1. YEpTOP2GAL1 (21Worland S.T. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4412-4416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) derives from the multicopy yeast vector YEp24 (NEB) and expresses the yeastTOP2 gene from the yeast promoter pGAL1. Construction of the yeast minicircle Yp 3.4 (3.4 kb containing the yeast TRP1-ARS1 sequence) has been reported previously (15Trigueros S. Roca J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2243-2258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Plasmid pRS314-L was provided by Andrés Aguilera (Universidad de Sevilla). It contains two 598-bp ClaI-EcoRVLEU2 fragments repeated in direct orientation and separated by 31 bp of linker (22Prado F. Aguilera A. Genetics. 1995; 139: 109-123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pLeeuu2 was constructed in two steps. First, two overlapping fragments from the LEU2 gene (2225 bp) of YEp13 (23Broach J.R. Strathern J.N. Hicks J.B. Gene. 1979; 8: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar) were inserted sequentially into a regular cloning vector. OneXhoI-EcoRI fragment comprised the first 1295 bp of LEU2, and the other ClaI-SalI fragment comprised the last 1416 bp of LEU2. TheEcoRI-AccI 628-bp fragment of pBR322 was then inserted between these overlapping LEU2 sequences. From this construct, a 3339-bp XhoI-SalI fragment spanning the overlapping LEU2 sequences plus the linker region was obtained and inserted into the SalI site of Yp 3.4, which provided the yeast ARS1 sequence and the TRP1 marker. Recombination frequencies were calculated as the median of three fluctuation tests, each performed with six independent colonies for each transformant studied (22Prado F. Aguilera A. Genetics. 1995; 139: 109-123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast strains carrying plasmids with the URA3 marker were grown in SC (−ura) medium. After transformation with pRS314-L or pLeeuu2, which carried the TRP1 marker, independent colonies selected on SC (−trp) plates were serially diluted and plated on SC (−leu) to determine the median frequency of Leu+ recombinants. The viable cell number was simultaneously determined on SC (−trp) plates. DNA from transformed yeast cells was prepared from yeast spheroplast (24Sherman F Fink G.R. Lawrence C. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1983Google Scholar). DNA blot-hybridization (25Southern E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 503-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (21471) Google Scholar) was done using 32P labeled DNA probes obtained by random priming of gel-purified DNA fragments. The yeast strain JCW28 (Δtop1 top2–4) was transformed with pRK-G1T1, YEpTOP2GAL1, or YEptopA-PGAL1. These plasmids carried under the yeast GAL1 promoter the genes encoding forS. cerevisiae topoisomerase I, S. cerevisiae topoisomerase II, and E. coli topoisomerase I, respectively. JCW28 cells were also transformed with YEp24, a control plasmid. Single transformants, selected from SD (−ura) plates, were grown at 26 °C in liquid selective media containing a range of glucose or galactose concentrations, to express the topoisomerases by gradual activation of the GAL1 promoter. Cell duplication times were then measured during exponential growth (Fig. 3). The JCW28 strain harboring the control plasmid duplicated every 8 h in media containing 2% glucose, and every 9 h in media containing 2% galactose. Cells harboring pRK-G1T1, however, improved their growth rate in media containing 2% glucose (duplication every 6 h) and reached optimal growth in media containing 1% glucose + 1% galactose (duplication time about 4 h). In media with 2% galactose, their growth was impaired because overexpression of eukaryotic topoisomerase I became toxic. Similarly, cells harboring YEpTOP2GAL1 grew faster with 2% glucose (duplication every 6 h) and reached optimal growth with 1.4% glucose + 0.6% galactose (duplication time about 4 h). Overexpression of topoisomerase II by increasing the galactose concentrations also became toxic. When the cells harbored YEptopA-PGAL1, the expression of E. colitopoisomerase I also improved the growth rate of the double mutant, although a higher induction of the GAL1 promoter was required. These cells duplicated in less than 6 h in media containing 0.2% glucose + 1.8% galactose; their growth rate did not improve when the galactose concentration was raised to 2%. The JCW28 (Δtop1 top2–4) cells, transformed with either pRK-G1T1, YEpTOP2GAL1, or YEptopA-PGAL1, were grown at 26 °C in selective media SC (−ura) containing amounts of glucose and galactose that yield optimal growth rate, as inferred above. For each case, JCW28 cells harboring YEp24 (the control plasmid) were grown in parallel conditions. After a minimum of 50 generations, DNA of the cells was extracted and analyzed by electrophoresis to examine the migration of rDNA sequences. Extrachromosomal rDNA rings (R in Fig. 4) were present in the cells carrying YEp24 (Fig. 4,lanes 1, 3, and 5). As expected, either the expression of yeast topoisomerase I (Fig. 4, lane 2) or yeast topoisomerase II (Fig. 4, lane 4) reduced the formation of extrachromosomal rDNA rings. The expression ofE. coli topoisomerase I (Fig. 4, lane 6) also decreased ring excision, because the rDNA sequences were found to be integrated mostly in the chromosomal DNA (C in Fig.4). The same set of cells described above for the analysis of the rDNA sequences was further transformed with the Yp 3.4 minicircle, which multimerizes in the Δtop1 top2–4mutant (15Trigueros S. Roca J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2243-2258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Single colonies of the double transformants were grown at 26 °C in selective media SC (−ura−trp) containing optimal amounts of glucose and galactose. After a minimum of 50 generations, DNA was extracted and analyzed by electrophoresis to examine the migration of Yp 3.4. In the cells harboring the control plasmid (Fig.5, lanes 1, 3, and5), over half of the Yp 3.4 minicircles (Fig. 5,M1) were present as multimeric forms (M2, M3, M4, M5). As expected, in the cells expressing yeast topoisomerase I (Fig. 5, lane 2) or yeast topoisomerase II (Fig. 5,lane 4) the Yp 3.4 circles were found stabilized in the monomeric form (M1). Notably, in the cells that expressed the E. coli topoisomerase I (Fig. 5, lane 6), multimerization of Yp 3.4 was also prevented. To explore whether E. coli topoisomerase I had a more general effect on genome stabilization in yeast cells defective in topoisomerase activities, we determined its effect on homologous recombination frequency. As substrates for DNA recombination, we used either a yeast multicopy plasmid, pLeeuu2, or a yeast centromeric plasmid, pRS314-L (Fig. 6 A). In both constructs, homologous recombination between two directly repeated sequences would reconstitute the yeast LEU2 gene (Fig. 6 B). We determined the recombination frequency of pLeeuu2 and of pRS314-L within the set of isogenic strains FY251 (TOP+), JCW26 (top2–4), JCW27 (dtop1), and JCW28 (dtop1 top2–4). Each strain carried YEp24, pRK-G1T1, YEpTOP2GAL1, or YEptopA-PGAL1 at the time of transformation with pLeeuu2 or pRS314-L. Recombination frequencies were calculated as explained in the experimental section. The graphs in Fig. 7 summarize the averaged values obtained in each of the above described 24 double transformants after three independent tests. The recombination frequencies for pLeeuu2 and for pRS314-L were similar and their variations parallel. When the strains harbored the control plasmid YEp24, recombination frequency in TOP+ cells was about 3 × 10−4. This value did not increase significantly in the cells with single mutations in the TOP1 orTOP2 genes. Conversely, in the Δtop1 top2–4cells, recombination frequency was nearly two orders of magnitude higher than the parental TOP+ cells. Extrachromosomal expression of yeast topoisomerase I or yeast topoisomerase II did not alter the recombination values inTOP+ cells or in cells with single mutations in theTOP1 or TOP2 genes. However, in the double mutant (Δtop1 top2–4), expression of either yeast topoisomerase I or II prevented hyper-recombination. Comparable effects were found in cells expressing the E. coli topoisomerase I. Whereas recombination frequencies were not altered in TOP+ or in the cells with single mutations in the TOP1 or TOP2genes, the bacterial topoisomerase reduced the hyper-recombination of the Δtop1 top2–4 double mutants. The effect of E. coli topoisomerase I on the slow growth of Δtop1 top2–4 yeast cells indicates that the bacterial enzyme fulfills a task commonly shared by yeast topoisomerase I and II. The yeast double mutant duplicates every 8 h, which is about four times slower than single Δtop1 ortop2–4 mutants and parental TOP+ cells. Slight expression of either yeast topoisomerase I or II, from plasmid-borne genes located under the yeast GAL1 promoter, is enough to improve the growth rate of the double-mutant. Higher expression of these enzymes was toxic, especially in yeast topoisomerase I, in which TOP1 gene cannot be placed in multicopy plasmids. The growth compensation by E. coli topoisomerase was achieved by placing the topA gene under the GAL1 promoter, in a multicopy plasmid, under high induction conditions (1.8% galactose, 0.2% glucose). Because higher induction (2% galactose) did not improved the growth compensation, we consider these conditions close to providing optimal expression of E. coli topoisomerase I for the compensation of the Δtop1 top2–4 phenotype. The excision of rDNA genes and the multimerization of small plasmids in Δtop1 top2–4 cells are dynamic bidirectional processes, probably mediated by homologous recombination, the origin of which is attributed to the persistence of unconstrained positive and/or negative supercoils (14Kim R.A. Wang J.C. Cell. 1989; 57: 975-985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 15Trigueros S. Roca J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2243-2258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We have corroborated this origin by showing how both instabilities are reverted by the extrachromosomal expression of either yeast topoisomerases I or II. The analogous effect of expressing the E. coli topoisomerase I indicates that relaxation of negative supercoils is sufficient as a substitute for the normal roles of the yeast topoisomerases in suppressing these forms of instability. Still, we considered the possibility that the stabilizing effect of the E. coli topoisomerase I could affect DNA recombination pathways in a different manner. Like other type IA enzymes, namely bacterial topoisomerase III (26Harmon F.G. DiGate R.J. Kowalczykowski S.C. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 611-620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) and yeast topoisomerase III (27Gangloff S. de Massy B. Arthur L. Rothstein R. Fabre F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1701-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), E. coli topoisomerase I could influence recombination by acting on linkages of single strands of DNA rather than by relaxing supercoiled duplexes. Nevertheless, the stabilizing effect of E. coli topoisomerase I by its removal of negative supercoils was corroborated by examining the frequency of homologous recombination in several yeast strains expressing thetopA gene. In agreement with previous reports (13Christman M.F. Dietrich F.S. Fink G.R. Cell. 1988; 55: 413-425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), for Δtop1 or top2–4 single mutants the recombination frequency in repeated sequences (other than the rDNA) was similar to TOP+ cells. Because the expression of E. coli topoisomerase I did not alter these values, it is unlikely that the activity of the bacterial enzyme inhibits or interferes with mitotic recombination in yeast. In the Δtop1 top2–4double mutant, however, the frequency of homologous recombination increased by nearly two orders of magnitude. Extrachromosomal expression of either yeast topoisomerase I or II fully prevented this increment; and, in this case, expression of E. colitopoisomerase I also reduced markedly the hyper-recombination. Because the only common feature shared by the bacterial topoisomerase I and the yeast topoisomerases I and II is the ability to relax negative DNA supercoils, these are likely the main determinant for the DNA instabilities occurring in the Δtop1 top2–4 mutants. The complementation achieved by the DNA relaxation activity of E. coli topoisomerase I in yeast cells is not surprising. First, yeast topoisomerase I and II can replace each other for DNA relaxation, despite their different mechanism and mode of interaction with DNA (4Saavedra R.A. Huberman J.A. Cell. 1986; 45: 65-70Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 5Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6659-6662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Liu L.F. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7024-7027Crossref PubMed Scopus (1508) Google Scholar, 7Giaever G.N. Wang J.C.

This indicates that most supercoil removal in yeast DNA does not rely on specific molecular interactions. Second, the main role ofE. coli topoisomerase I in the bacteria is to relax negative supercoils. Early observations showed that E. coli cells defective in topoisomerase I can survive if they have compensatory mutations affecting DNA gyrase (28DiNardo S. Voelkel K.A. Sternglanz R. Reynolds A.E. Wright A. Cell. 1982; 31: 43-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), a type II topoisomerase that introduces negative supercoils. Alternatively, E. colitopoisomerase I mutants can be compensated either by the expression of eukaryotic topoisomerase I (29Bjornsti M.A. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8971-8975Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) or by the overexpression of bacterial topoisomerase IV (30Zechiedrich E.L. Khodursky A.B. Bachellier S. Schneider R. Chen D. Lilley D.M. Cozzarelli N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8103-8113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Both enzymes are efficient supercoil removers. More recent evidence confirms the essential function of E. coli topoisomerase I in relaxing unconstrained negative supercoils to avoid R-loop formation (31Masse E. Drolet M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16654-16658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Our results strengthen the notion that DNA supercoiling can be a strong promoter of genome instability in eukaryotic cells. How unconstrained supercoils stimulate mitotic recombination remains to be explored. Supercoiling in general could disrupt chromatin structure, promote DNA structural transitions, or increase DNA sensitivity to nucleases. Negative supercoiling, in particular, could facilitate recombination by favoring DNA strand invasion or branch migration. Further studies with yeast cells harboring different topoisomerase activities are required. So far, we conclude that the genetic instability generated by the combined deficiency of eukaryotic topoisomerases I and II can be attributed mainly to failure to remove negative supercoils rather than positive ones.

WHO, Geneva1984Google Scholar). Leishmaniasis manifests as cutaneous lesions from minor to severe, or as a visceral form that, if untreated, has a high fatality rate. Existing chemotherapies are unsatisfactory, relying upon pentavalent antimonial compounds despite considerable host toxicity and some evidence for the emergence of parasite resistance (2Grogl M. Thomason T.N. Franke E.D. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1992; 47: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Presently no effective vaccine against leishmaniasis is available. Leishmania have a digenetic life cycle, first residing in the gut of phlebotomine sand flies where they replicate as a procyclic promastigote. As parasites enter stationary phase they differentiate into the infectious metacyclic promastigote, which is ultimately transmitted by the bite of a sand fly. Once parasites are introduced into the mammalian host, they are taken up by macrophages where they differentiate into amastigotes. Amastigotes reside and propagate within the phagolysosome, where they induce pathology and disease. Leishmania and other trypanosomatid protozoan parasites are incapable of de novo synthesis of pteridines (folate and pterins) and must obtain them by salvage from their insect or mammalian hosts (3Beck J.T. Ullman B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1990; 43: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 4Petrillo-Peixoto M. Beverley S.M. Antimicrob.

To accomplish this, Leishmania express a versatile pteridine salvage network, consisting of transporters with specificity for folate and biopterin (FT1 and BT1, respectively; Refs.7Cunningham M.L.

Following uptake, two pteridine reductases, one specific for folate (a bifunctional dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase; DHFR-TS)2 and a second with broader specificity (pteridine reductase 1 or PTR1), reduce folate and biopterin, respectively, into the active forms, tetrahydrofolate (H4folate) and tetrahydrobiopterin (H4B; Refs.11Nare B.

The importance of folate in essential metabolic processes such as synthesis of thymidylate has been established firmly inLeishmania by pharmacological and genetic studies bothin vitro and in vivo (14Ivanetich K.M. Santi D.V. Exp. Parasitol. 1990; 70: 367-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 15Cruz A. Beverley S.M. Nature. 1990; 348: 171-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 16Titus R.G.

Current data suggest that H4B is essential for growth inLeishmania (12Bello A.R. Nare B. Freedman D. Hardy L. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Beverley S.M. Science. 2001; 292: 285-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). H4B has also been found to be a growth factor in Crithidia fasciculata and to effect proliferation and differentiation in various mammalian cell lines (20Iwai K. Bunno M. Kobashi M. Suzuki T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 444: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 21Kerler F. Ziegler I. Schmid C. Bacher A. Exp.

Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1299-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). While essential, the role(s) of H4B inLeishmania metabolism is not well understood at present.Leishmania is auxotrophic for tyrosine and trypanosomatids have been reported to lack phenylalanine hydroxylase activity (23Kaufman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1963; 50: 1085-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), however, the Leishmania genome encodes a protein with strong homology to amino acid hydroxylases. 3L.-F. Lye, M. L. Cunningham, and S. M. Beverley, unpublished data. NOS activity has been reported in Leishmania and trypanosomes (24Basu N.K. Kole L. Ghosh A. Das P.K. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1997; 156: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 25Paveto C. Pereira C. Espinosa J. Montagna A.E. Farber M. Esteva M. Flawia M.M. Torres H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16576-16579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), but the Leishmania ether lipid cleavage activity utilizes NADPH rather than H4B as a cofactor (26Ma D. Beverley S.M. Turco S.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 227: 885-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In other organisms, H4B is metabolized to pterin-4α-carbinolamine through the action of aromatic amino acid hydroxylases or NOS, or by spontaneous oxidation (27Nagatsu T. Ichinose H. Mol. Neurobiol. 1999; 19: 79-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Two enzymes are involved in its subsequent dehydration and reduction to H4B: pterin-4α-carbinolamine dehydratase (PCD) (28Hauer C.R. Rebrin I. Thony B. Neuheiser F. Curtius H.C. Hunziker P. Blau N. Ghisla S. Heizmann C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4828-4831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) andquinonoid-dihydropteridine reductase (qDPR; Ref. (29Kaufman S. Tetrahydrobiopterin: Basic Biochemistry and Role in Human Disease. Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore1997Google Scholar), respectively (Fig. 1). Regeneration of H4B allows organisms to efficiently use biopterin cofactor in metabolism, and in humans qDPR deficiency is the second most common cause of hyperphenylalanemia (30Dianzani I. de Sanctis L. Smooker P.M. Gough T.J. Alliaudi C. Brusco A. Spada M. Blau N. Dobos M. Zhang H.P. Yang N. Ponzone A. Armarego W.L. Cotton R.G. Hum.

J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 1996; 19: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar).qDPR has been extensively characterized in mammalian cells, with its three-dimensional structure placing it within the family of short-chain dehydrogenases (33Varughese K.I. Skinner M.M. Whiteley J.M. Matthews D.A. Xuong N.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6080-6084Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 34Su Y. Varughese K.I. Xuong N.H. Bray T.L. Roche D.J. Whiteley J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26836-26841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The qDPRs from most species show a strong dependence for NADH as a cofactor and forquinonoid-dihydrobiopterin (qH2B) as the pteridine substrate (35Chang C.F. Bray T. Varughese K.I. Whiteley J.M. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1999; 463: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Outside of metazoans there are few studies of qDPRs. Some prokaryotes exhibit qDPR activity (36Vasudevan S.G. Shaw D.C. Armarego W.L. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 581-588PubMed Google Scholar) and aPseudomonas qDPR has been characterized (37Williams C.D. Dickens G. Letendre C.H. Guroff G. Haines C. Shiota T. J. Bacteriol. 1976; 127: 1197-1207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In trypanosomatids qDPR activity has been found in crude lysates of Leishmania major and its relative Crithidia fasciculata (12Bello A.R. Nare B. Freedman D. Hardy L. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11442-11446Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 38Hirayama K. Nakanisi N. Sueoka T. Katoh S. Yamada S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 612: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Because of the importance of H4B to Leishmania metabolism and virulence, we decided to characterize the qDPR gene and enzyme from L. major (LmQDPR). Biopterin and H2B were purchased from Schircks Laboratories (Jona, Switzerland). 6,7-Dimethyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropterin (DMPH4), NADPH, NADH, and horseradish peroxidase were purchased from Sigma. Folate-deficient medium was custom manufactured by Invitrogen and is identical to M199 except that it lacks folate and thymidine (18Nare B. Hardy L.W. Beverley S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13883-13891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). All other reagents were of analytical grade. Several pteridine analogs were tested for inhibition of LmQDPR activity whose structures, provenance, and usage were described previously (39Hardy L.W. Matthews W. Nare B. Beverley S.M. Exp. Parasitol. 1997; 87: 158-170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The following strains were used: L. major Friedlin V1 (MHOM/JL/80/Friedlin) and CC-1 (MHOM/IR/83/IR; Ref. 40Kapler G.M. Coburn C.M. Beverley S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1084-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), a null mutant CC-1 Leishmanialacking PTR1 (ptr1−) described previously (12Bello A.R. Nare B. Freedman D. Hardy L. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11442-11446Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar),Leishmania donovani Sudanese strain 1S2D (MHOM/S.D./00/1S-2D), and Leishmania mexicana(MNYC/BZ/62/M379). Wild-type promastigotes were maintained by serial passage in M199 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 26 °C; ptr1− parasite media additionally contained 2 μg/ml H2B (7Cunningham M.L. Beverley S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 113: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). For L. major, metacyclic promastigotes were isolated from stationary phase 48-h cultures by negative selection with peanut agglutinin as described (41da Silva R. Sacks D.L. Infect. Immun. 1987; 55: 2802-2806Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and amastigotes were harvested from BALB/c mouse footpad lesions 3 weeks postinfection. Axenic culture and differentiation ofL. mexicana amastigote were previously described (7Cunningham M.L. Beverley S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 113: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The procyclic Trypanosoma brucei cell line YTAT 1.1 (a gift from E. Ullu, Yale University) was propagated in Cunningham's SM medium supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal calf serum. Methods for DNA transfection of Leishmania by transfection were previously described (40Kapler G.M. Coburn C.M. Beverley S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1084-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) and clonal populations were obtained by plating on 20 μg/ml G418. The sequences of five random shotgun clones of L. major strain Friedlin V1 (42Akopyants N.S. Clifton S.W. Martin J. Pape D. Wylie T., Li, L. Kissinger J.C. Roos D.S. Beverley S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 113: 337-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) spanning theQDPR repeating unit were completed (lm18b06, strain B4501; lm61b05, strain B4181; lm25d04, strain B4180; and lm78e09, strain B4254; and lm62d04, strain B4502; GenBankTM number AF523363and AY141854). This missing ∼200 nt of the 3.6-kb LmQDPRrepeating unit was amplified by PCR using primers SMB1465 (5′-AACATTGAGCGGCAGAGGATGT) and SMB1466 (5′-TGATGGTGCGGCACTCGCGGTA), with DNA from cosmid 1c15-2 (strain B4259). The PCR product was A-tailed and cloned into pGEMTM-T Easy (Promega, Madison, WI) and sequenced (strain B4506, GenBankTM accession numberAF523363). Dideoxynucleotide sequencing reactions were performed using the ABI PRISMTM BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Leishmaniagenomic DNA was isolated from late logarithmic phase promastigotes by the LiCl method (43Medina-Acosta E. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 59: 327-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). T. brucei and Trypanosoma cruzi genomic DNAs were prepared by phenol extraction as described (44Beverley S.M. Coderre J.A. Santi D.V. Schimke R.T. Cell. 1984; 38: 431-439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from early and late logarithmic phase promastigotes, metacyclic cells, and lesion amastigotes by using the phenol/guanidine isothyocyanate reagent TRIzolTM(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Southern and Northern blots were performed following standard procedures (45Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 1. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.39-7.52Google Scholar), and a PCR-derived QDPR hybridization probe (described below) was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by the random-priming method (46Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16653) Google Scholar). Quantitation was performed with a laser densitometer (Molecular Dynamics with ImageQuantTM version 3.0; Molecular Dynamics). A L. major Friedlin V1 cosmid library prepared in the shuttle vector cLHYG (47Ryan K.A. Dasgupta S. Beverley S.M. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 131: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) was gridded onto nylon membranes, and hybridized with the L. major QDPRfull-length coding region probe. Four different cosmids containingQDPR were obtained (c1e16-1, strain B4257; c1c15-2, strain B4259; c7c21-2, strain B4260; and c12d12-3, strain B4264). Chromosomes were prepared and separated by pulsed field electrophoresis with a Bio-Rad Chef Mapper as described (48Beverley S.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 925-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 49Chu G. Vollrath D. Davis R.W. Science. 1986; 234: 1582-1585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). The 5′ terminus of the mature L. major QDPR transcript was determined by reverse transcriptase-PCR (50Wang Y. Dimitrov K. Garrity L.K. Sazer S. Beverley S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 96: 139-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), with primers specific for the L. major spliced leader sequence (SMB936: 5′-ACCGCTATATAAGTATCAGTTCTGTACTTTA) and the QDPR coding region (SMB 1036: 5′-TTCACCCTGCGTACTGAACACAT; the 1st base is located 332 nt downstream of the LmQDPR ATG). Complementary DNA was made from 5 μg of stationary promastigote RNA primed with oligo(dT) by Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) prior to PCR amplification, and the PCR product was purified and sequenced directly. A partial QDPRproduct was obtained by PCR amplification using primers based upon EST sequences (GenBankTM accession number AL390114; SMB 1609, 5′-ATGGCCCAAAAGAGCGGATTGG; SMB1610, 5′-CTGCCGGCTTGCACCCTGGCCA); it was inserted into pGEMTM-T Easy and sequenced (strain B4586; GenBankTM accession number AF523371). From comparisons with the LmQDPR repeat and flanking regions, we assembled a preliminary contig for the syntenic T. brucei region (see legend to Fig. 4); as this assembly exhibited several gaps, we designed PCR primers to obtain the sequence of these (GenBankTMaccession numbers AF523369 and AF523370). The contig sequences are available from the authors on request. Sequence data for L. major was obtained from The Sanger Institute website at www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/L_major and was accomplished as part of theLeishmania Genome Network with support by The Wellcome Trust. The 690-ntLmQDPR open reading frame was amplified by PCR withPfu polymerase (Stratagene) using primers SMB1084 (5′-gcggatcc accATGAAAAATGTACTCCTCATCG; the underlined sequence corresponds to a BamHI site and the bold nucleotides correspond to a “Kozak” sequence), SMB1085 (5′-cgggatcCTACACAATAAAACGCGTCTT), and 50 ng of template DNA (clone lm61b05). This PCR product was also used as a probe for Southern and Northern blot hybridization. The amplified DNA fragment was digested and cloned into the BamHI site of theLeishmania expression vector pXG1a (51Ha D.S. Schwarz J.K. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 77: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) in both orientations; the QDPR sequences were confirmed by sequencing. The resulting constructs (sense and antisense constructs pXG-QDPR and pXG-RPDQ, respectively; strains B4102 and B4103), were transfected into Leishmania. pET-15b DNA (Novagen, Madison, WI) was digested with NdeI, blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase, and ligated to the BamHI fragment from pXG-QDPR (also blunt-ended), yielding pET-QDPR (strain B4184; confirmed by sequencing). This provided a LmQDPRfusion construct bearing an N-terminal His tag. For protein expression, pET-QDPR was transformed into Escherichia coli strain BLR(DE3) pLys-S (strain B4244; Ref. 52Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6003) Google Scholar). A 500-ml culture was grown in L-broth medium plus ampicillin (100 μg/ml) toA 600 of 0.6, at 37 °C; isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside was added to a 1 mm final concentration and the culture was further incubated at 37 °C for another 4 h. Cells were harvested and resuspended in 25 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (150 mmNaCl, 16 mm Na2HPO4, 4 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.3), lysed by sonication, and the debris was precipitated by centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 10 min. Five ml of the supernatant was loaded onto 1 ml of the Ni2+-nitriloacetic acid resin affinity column (Qiagen), which was previously equilibrated with 10 ml of wash buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole). The recombinant protein was eluted with 2 ml of elution buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mmNaCl, 250 mm imidazole). Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using a 15% acrylamide gel by standard protocols (53Coligan J.E. Dunn B.M. Speicher D.W. Wingfield P.T. Chanda V.B.C. 3rd Ed. Current Protocols in Protein Science, Electrophoresis. 1. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997: 10.1.1-10.1.11Google Scholar) and visualized by stained Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Leishmania promastigotes and T. brucei procyclics were collected by centrifugation at 1,250 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended at 2 × 109cells/ml in 10 ml of Tris-Cl, pH 7.0, with 1 mm EDTA and a mixture of protease inhibitors as described (18Nare B. Hardy L.W. Beverley S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13883-13891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Frozen pellets ofT. cruzi epimastigotes (Silvio strain) were generously provided by M. Pereira (Tufts University School of Medicine). Cells were lysed by three rounds of freeze thawing and sonication, and the extracts clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (54Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216202) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. qDPR activity was measured at 25 °C as described (55Firgaira F.A. Cotton R.G. Danks D.M. Biochem. J. 1981; 197: 31-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) using the quinonoid form of 6,7-dimethyl-H2-pterin (qDMPH2). Because quinonoid pteridines are very unstable, they are continuously provided by the horseradish peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation of DMPH4 in this assay. The standard reaction mixture contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 20 μg of horseradish peroxidase, 0.9 mmH2O2, 5–320 μmDMPH4, 100 μm NADH, and 30 ng of purifiedqDPR, unless otherwise indicated. Experimentally, all components except DMPH4 were incubated for 1 min prior to initiation of reaction by addition of DMPH4. NADH consumption was measured by absorbance at 340 nm in a Beckman DU-640 spectrophotometer. The initial rates were obtained from the rate of decrease of absorbence at 340 nm (ε340 for NADH or NADPH is 6200 m−1 cm−1). The pH dependence was determined using two overlapping buffers: 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 4.8–8.8, and 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.0–11.1. Inhibitor studies were performed with 10 μm inhibitor and 100 μm DMPH4 and 100 μm NADH. All inhibitors except compound 66 were preincubated at 25 °C for 1 min in the presence of the complete reaction mixture containing 30 ng of purified LmQDPR, after which DMPH4 was added to start the reaction. With compound 66, addition of purified protein prior to DMPH4 resulted in a decrease in absorbance; thus, purified LmQDPR was first added together with substrate, after which compound 66 was added. Water-insoluble compounds were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO); in the final assay, the Me2SO concentration did not exceed 0.05%, a value that had no effect onqDPR activity (data not shown). Intracellular levels of biopterin and H4B were determined as described previously (7Cunningham M.L. Beverley S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 113: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Briefly, log phase promastigotes were isolated from the growth medium by centrifugation through a dibutylphthalate cushion. Cell pellets were subjected to either acid or alkaline oxidation and separated by high performance liquid chromatography. Under acidic conditions biopterin, H2B, and H4B form biopterin, while under alkaline conditions biopterin and H2B form biopterin, whereas H4B forms pterin. Ferric reductase activity was measured as described (56Lee P.L. Halloran C. Cross A.R. Beutler E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 788-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), with some modifications. Recombinant LmQDPR protein or sheep liver dihydropteridine reductase (Sigma) were added to a 250-μl reaction mixture containing 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mmNaH2PO4, 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.2 mm ferrozine, 50 μm ferric nitrilotriacetic acid (prepared as 1 mm ferric chloride, 4 mmnitrilotriacetic acid, 100 mm HCl, then the pH was adjusted to pH 6.8), with or without 100 μm NADH, in a microtiter plate. The rate of formation of NADH-dependent ferrozine complex was followed spectrophotometrically at 575 nm in a Molecular Devices Thermomax microtiter plate reader at 26 °C (ε = 27,900 m−1 cm−1). End point absorbance was measured after 60 min. In a shotgun survey of the L. major genome, we found several recombinants whose end sequences showed homology toqDPRs of other species (42Akopyants N.S. Clifton S.W. Martin J. Pape D. Wylie T., Li, L. Kissinger J.C. Roos D.S. Beverley S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 113: 337-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The sequences were completed, yielding a predicted LmQDPR protein encompassing 230 amino acids, with a predicted molecular mass of 25.6 kDa. Mapping of the 5′ end of theLmQDPR transcript confirmed the assignment of the start codon (described below). The predicted LmQDPR amino acid sequence was highly related to those of human, rat, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Drosophila melanogaster, showing 36–39% identity and 53–58% similarity (57Lockyer J.

Significantly, key residues implicated by structural or mutational studies in substrate and cofactor binding in other qDPRs were conserved in the predicted LmQDPR. These included the Tyr-(Xaa)3-Lys NADH binding motif (positions 138–42, marked by solid circles in Fig. 2), Asp-32, the residue implicated in preferential binding of NADH (marked by a triangle in Fig. 2), and two residues implicated in binding of quinonoid dihydropteridine (open circles in Fig. 1; Refs. 61Varughese K.I.

With an LmQDPR ORF probe and digestion with enzymes such as SmaI, NotI, or SacI that do not cut within this probe, Southern blot analysis revealed strong hybridization to a band of 3.6 kb in each digest, as well as weaker hybridization to another band (Fig.3 A).

They trigger epithelial to mesenchymal transitions (EMTs), thereby allowing epithelial cells to emigrate from their place of origin and form tissues such as the mesoderm and the neural crest. Snail genes are also involved in the EMTs responsible for the acquisition of invasiveness during tumor progression. This aspect of their activity is associated with their ability to directly repress E-cadherin transcription. Here we describe the existence of an active human Snailretrogene, inserted within an intron of a novel evolutionarily conserved gene and expressed in different human tissues and cell lines. Functional analyses in cell culture show that this retrogene maintains the potential to induce EMTs, conferring migratory and invasive properties to epithelial cells. In light of this data, we have renamed it SNAIL-like, a new player that must be considered in both physiological and pathological studies of SNAIL function in humans.

After the identification ofSnail in Drosophila (1Grau Y. Carteret C. Simpson P. Genetics. 1984; 108: 347-360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), multiple family members have been isolated, leading to their classification in two main families, Snail and Scratch (2Manzanares M. Locascio A. Nieto M.A. Trends Genet. 2001; 17: 178-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). A common feature of the superfamily is a role in neural development, whereas a conserved function in mesoderm formation is associated with the Snail family (2Manzanares M. Locascio A. Nieto M.A. Trends Genet. 2001; 17: 178-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 3Nieto M.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 155-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar). Additional roles in cell division, cell survival, left-right asymmetry, and wing and limb development have also been described in different species (3Nieto M.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 155-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar,4Hemavathy K. Ashraf S.I. Ip Y.T. Gene. 2000; 257: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Within the Snail family, a duplication event led to the formation ofSnail and Slug in vertebrates, which evolved by dividing their ancestral functions and acquiring new ones. An example of new function can be seen during the development of the neural crest, a population of cells involved in the formation of the vertebrate head (5Gans C. Northcutt R.G. Science. 1983; 220: 268-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar, 6Nieto M.A. Mech. Dev. 2001; 105: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). These genes are required for the acquisition of migratory properties by both the neural crest and the mesoderm, principally by triggering the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)1 that confers upon epithelial cells the capacity to migrate through the extracellular matrix (7Hay E.D. Acta Anat. 1995; 154: 8-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (1256) Google Scholar, 8Duband J.L. Monier F. Delannet M. Newgreen D. Acta Anat. 1995; 154: 63-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Indeed, the lethality of Snailmutant mice at gastrulation is due to a defect in EMT during mesoderm formation (9Carver E.A. Jiang R. Lan Y. Oram K.F. Gridley T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8184-8188Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). In this respect, Snail has been shown to act as a direct repressor ofE-cadherin transcription both during embryonic development and tumor progression. A direct correlation has been observed between Snail activation and the acquisition of invasive and metastatic properties in human tumor cell lines of different epithelial origin (10Cano A. Perez-Moreno M.A. Rodrigo I. Locascio A. Blanco M.J. del Barrio M.G. Portillo F. Nieto M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 76-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (2944) Google Scholar, 11Batlle E. Sancho E. Franci C.

In addition, Snail is expressed at the invasive front of mouse skin tumors and human breast carcinomas (10Cano A. Perez-Moreno M.A. Rodrigo I. Locascio A. Blanco M.J. del Barrio M.G. Portillo F. Nieto M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 76-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (2944) Google Scholar, 13Cheng C.W., Wu, P.E., Yu, J.C. Huang C.S. Yue C.T., Wu, C.W. Shen C.Y.

In addition to SNAIL(HUGO Genome Nomenclature Committee approved symbol: SNAI1), an extremely related sequence was found in the human genome and classified as a nonfunctional retro-transcribed pseudogene (SNAI1P; Refs. 15Paznekas W.A. Okajima K. Schertzer M. Wood S. Jabs E.W. Genomics. 1999; 62: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar and 16Twigg S.R. Wilkie A.O. Hum Genet. 1999; 105: 320-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Retrogenes result from the reverse transcription of an mRNA and subsequent insertion into the genome mediated by different transposable sequences such as retrovirus, LINE, or Alu elements (17Brosius J. Gene. 1999; 238: 115-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). In general, pseudogenes are not expressed due to the absence of promoter elements in the region of insertion. Even when they have the ability of being expressed after integration, the lack of regulated expression or the absence of selective pressure leads to their rapid inactivation, often as a result of accumulated changes that render the protein nonfunctional (18Boer P.H. Adram C.N. Lau Y.F. McBurney M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3107-3112Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 19Adra C.N. Ellis N.A. McBurney M.W. Somatic Cell Mol.

Craigen W.J. Genomics. 1999; 59: 282-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, an expressed retrotransposed gene can acquire adaptive mutations that lead to its functional differentiation and the acquisition of new properties (25Brosius J. Science. 1991; 251: 753Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Here we show that the SNAIL retrogene inserted in the human genome constitutes a transcription unit that we propose to callSNAIL-like (SNAI1L). It has been subjected to positive selection leading to the maintenance of the complete open reading frame and the conservation of its zinc finger DNA binding (3Nieto M.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 155-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar) and SNAG transactivation domains (26Grimes H.L. Chan T.O. Zweidler-McKay P.A. Tong B. Tsichlis P.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6263-6272Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). It is integrated into a new gene (2q34-X) and possesses a regulated pattern of expression different from that of both SNAIL and2q34-X. We also show that in a similar manner to SNAIL, it is able to induce EMT in epithelial cell lines and maintains the capacity of repressing E-cadherin expression. The biological potential of SNAIL-like makes it an important subject for functional studies in tumor progression. In addition, its similarity toSNAILmight have been the cause of incorrect evaluation ofSNAIL expression in some studies carried out in human cells lines and tumors. Sequence comparisons were performed using BLAST (Ref. 27Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71436) Google Scholar; www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST). Gene predictions were obtained with GENSCAN (Ref. 28Burge C. Karlin S. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 78-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (3098) Google Scholar; genes.mit.edu/GENSCAN.html) and those of the pufferfish and ascidian exons using sequences from the Fugu (fugu.hgmp.mrc.ac.uk) and the Ciona intestinalis(jgi.doe.gov/programs/ciona.htm) genome projects. Transcripts, genes, and ESTs present in the region analyzed (2q34) were confirmed via the Ensembl Human Genome Server (www.ensembl.org, chromosome 2, nucleotides 219550835–220050835 view). Sequence alignments were carried out using Clustal (29Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55997) Google Scholar) and corrected by visual inspection. Poly(A)+ RNA from cell lines was purified by oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography (30Vennstrom B. Bishop J.M. Cell. 1982; 28: 135-143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). For Northern blot assays the entire SNAIL-like orSNAIL coding fragments were labeled using the Rediprime II kit (Amersham Biosciences), and GAPD(glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) was used as a control of mRNA quantity. Adult human cDNAs were obtained from BD Biosciences, whereas poly(A)+ was isolated from the different tumor cell lines or stable transfectant clones (Microfast Track isolation kit, Invitrogen) and treated with DNase I before cDNA synthesis. PCR for E-cadherin, Box A, Box B, SNAIL-like, and 5′-SNAIL-like were performed over 35 cycles at an annealing temperature of 65–70 °C. For all SNAIL amplifications from adult tissues, nested PCR reactions were carried out under the same conditions. GAPD was amplified after 30 cycles at an annealing temperature of 60 °C. Primer sequences are available upon request. Semi-quantitative analysis was carried out by densitometry of the products over different number of cycles in the linear phase of amplification. SNAIL and SNAIL-like coding sequences were amplified by RT-PCR from poly(A)+ RNA from the A375P cell line. Primer sequences are available upon request. The amplified fragments were cloned in the pZEOSV2+ vector (Invitrogen) and transfected with LipofectAMINE Plus (31Faraldo M.L. Rodrigo I. Behrens J. Birchmeier W. Cano A. Mol. Carcinog. 1997; 20: 33-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Stable transfectants were generated in MDCK cells after selection with Zeocine. Six independent clones were analyzed from each pZeo-SNAI1 and pZeo-SNAI1L and from mock pZeo transfections. The expression of E-cadherin, SNAIL, and SNAIL-like was analyzed in stable transfected MDCK cells by RT-PCR. For immunofluorescence analysis, cells were grown on coverslips in 6-cm cell culture dishes and fixed 24–48 h after transfection (32Lozano E. Cano A. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1998; 6: 51-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 33Gómez M. Navarro P. Cano A. Invasion Metastasis. 1994; 14: 17-26PubMed Google Scholar). The same amplified fragments were fused to a mutated version of the ligand binding domain of the human estrogen receptor that recognizes the synthetic ligand 4-OH-tamoxifen. The fragment corresponding to the binding site was obtained from the vector pCre-ERT2 (34Feil R. Wagner J. Metzger D. Chambon P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 752-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar), kindly provided by P. Chambon. The final fragments either containing SNAIL or SNAIL-likeand another one containing the internal ribosomal entry site and EGFP sequences were subcloned in pcDNA3. The constructs were transfected with LipofectAMINE Plus (31Faraldo M.L. Rodrigo I. Behrens J. Birchmeier W. Cano A. Mol. Carcinog. 1997; 20: 33-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). 4-OH-tamoxifen (200 nm) was added 24 h after transfection, and cells were fixed for immunofluorescence analysis after 72 h of treatment. For migration assays, the cells were seeded in T6-well culture dishes at a density of 3 × 105 cells/well. A wound was incised 24 h later, and cells were observed at different time intervals. Invasion assays on collagen type-IV gels were carried out using the two-compartment Boyden chamber in duplicate samples (35Llorens A. Rodrigo I. Lopez-Barcons L. Gonzalez-Garrigues M. Lozano E. Vinyals A. Quintanilla M. Cano A. Fabra A. Lab. Invest. 1998; 78: 1131-1142PubMed Google Scholar). For the analysis of theE-cadherin promoter, MCA3D cells were co-transfected with 50 ng of Renilla vector and 0.4 μg of pGL2 vector (Promega) containing the E-cadherin promoter fused to the Luc reporter gene together with either 50 ng of pZeo-SNAI1, pZeo-SNAI1L, or control pZeo plasmids. Luciferase andRenilla activities were assayed using the dual-luciferase reporter system kit (Promega), and the activity normalized to that of the promoter cotransfected with the control pZeo vector. The mouseSnail expression construct was as described (10Cano A. Perez-Moreno M.A. Rodrigo I. Locascio A. Blanco M.J. del Barrio M.G. Portillo F. Nieto M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 76-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (2944) Google Scholar). An exhaustive analysis of different ESTs and genomic databases using specific and diagnostic sequences to the Snail genes revealed multiple new members from Drosophila,Caenorhabditis elegans, zebrafish, and humans (2Manzanares M. Locascio A. Nieto M.A. Trends Genet. 2001; 17: 178-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Among these, we found a genomic sequence from human chromosome 2 (GenBankTM accession number AC006385) containing a 1863-bp segment highly related to an intronless transcript of theSNAIL gene (SNAI1). The nucleotide similarity was 81.9% in the coding region, 75% over a 254-bp stretch of the 5′-UTR, and 74.6% over 848 bp of the 3′-UTR. The region similar toSNAIL was followed by an Alu-like sequence in the 5′ end and flanked by 15-bp inverted repeats at both 5′ and 3′ ends. Outside of this region, similarity drops to non-significant levels. This is strong evidence that this gene resulted from a retrotranscription of aSNAIL mRNA followed by its insertion in the genome. Indeed, other groups recently described it as a processed non-transcribed pseudogene and named it SNAI1P (15Paznekas W.A. Okajima K. Schertzer M. Wood S. Jabs E.W. Genomics. 1999; 62: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 16Twigg S.R. Wilkie A.O. Hum Genet. 1999; 105: 320-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Inspection of the coding region of SNAI1P showed that the changes from the parental SNAILsequence involved 11.8% of the residues not including two insertions of 3 and 9 bp and one deletion of 30 bp. None of these changes disrupted the open reading frame. Evidences shown below indicate that this sequence is transcribed, and we call it hereafter SNAIL- like(SNAI1L). The change of name and symbol for this gene has been approved by the HGNC (www.gene.ucl.ac.uk/nomenclature/genefamily/snail.html). Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of SNAIL and SNAIL-like (Fig. 1 A) shows that the changes are not distributed equally along the whole length of the predicted protein. No changes were observed in the first 9 amino acids (aa)/27 bp, the highly conserved SNAG domain, present in all vertebrate Snail family members (2Manzanares M. Locascio A. Nieto M.A. Trends Genet. 2001; 17: 178-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and implicated in the repressor activity of these transcription factors (36Nakayama H. Scott I.C. Cross J.C. Dev. Biol. 1998; 199: 150-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 37Kataoka H. Murayama T. Yokode M. Mori S. Sano H. Ozaki H. Yokota Y. Nishikawa S. Kita T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 626-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 38Hemavathy K. Guru S.C. Harris J. Chen J.D. Ip Y.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5087-5095Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). We divided the remainder of the SNAIL-like protein into the C-terminal zinc finger DNA binding domain and an intermediate putative protein interaction domain. The zinc finger domain showed a 9.9% change in amino acids, whereas the intermediate region had undergone a 22.4% variation (Fig. 1 A). This bias toward changes in the intermediate region was also reflected in the nucleotide sequence. The analysis of the substitutions in SNAIL-like versus SNAIL-coding region is shown in Fig.1 B. The nature of nucleotide substitutions in terms of the ratios of transitions (t)/transvections (T) and of synonymous (S, non-aa-changing)/non-synonymous (NS, aa-changing) variations can be used as an indicator of the degree of positive selection within the amino acid sequence (39Hughes A.L. Green J.A. Garbayo J.M. Roberts R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3319-3323Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). We found no difference between the intermediate and C-terminal regions with respect to t/T, but the percentage of NS changes was higher in the intermediate region. These data are indicative of a selective pressure that has led to the conservation of the coding potential of SNAIL-like, making it prone to produce an active protein. The first indication that this sequence is actively transcribed was the identification of two human ESTs derived from the 3′-UTR ofSNAIL-like. To directly assess the expression of this transcript, we carried out RT-PCR studies in panels of human adult tissues and tumor cell lines using specific pairs of primers.SNAIL-like was expressed in a subset of the tissues that normally express SNAIL (Fig.2 A) and in all the cell lines analyzed (Fig. 2 B). Semi-quantitative analysis by RT-PCR indicates that in the tissues and cell lines where the two genes are expressed, their transcripts are represented at similar levels. The differential expression ofSNAIL-like indicates that it contains a functional promoter and that its expression is controlled by cis-regulatory elements either present at the site of genomic insertion or included in the retrotransposed sequence. If the latter were true, such elements might derive from the original SNAIL gene or from transposable and/or repeated elements (17Brosius J. Gene. 1999; 238: 115-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). To address these questions, we studied the genomic organization of the region where SNAIL-like is inserted. When searching for known genes in the vicinity ofSNAIL-like, we found that the MAP2(microtubule-associated protein 2) gene mapped 78 kb 5′ and theRPE (ribulose 5-phosphatase 3-epimerase) gene mapped 193 kb 3′ of SNAIL-like (Fig.3 A). However, the expression patterns of these genes could not account for the differential expression of SNAIL-like (neural-specific forMAP2 (40Lewis S.A. Villasante A. Sherline P. Cowan N.J. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 2098-2105Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and ubiquitous for RPE (41Spencer N. Hopkinson D.A. Ann. Hum. Genet. 1980; 43: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar)). GENSCAN analysis (28Burge C. Karlin S. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 78-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (3098) Google Scholar) on the 271-kb genomic segment located between these two genes identified a predicted gene that spanned more than 200 kb and coded for a product of 2915 aa, which we have called 2q34-X. The prediction contained part of the coding region ofSNAIL-like, lacked the initiation and the stop codons, and is a composite of three independent predicted transcripts, ENST00000236970, ENST00000272845, and ENST00000272846 (www.ensembl.org/), spanning three contiguous bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) (accession numbers AC006385, AC006464, and AC007038). In the search for potential homologues, we found that the C-terminal third of this product corresponds to the KIAA1843 protein, identified in a large scale sequencing and expression study of large cDNAs expressed in the human brain (42Nagase T. Nakayama M. Nakajima D. Kikuno R. Ohara O. DNA Res. 2001; 8: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). We also found a predicted protein of 3147 aa from C. elegans (F25C8.3) that showed significant similarity to 2q34-X distributed in blocks along the whole length of both products (Fig. 3 B). In Drosophila melanogaster, the predicted gene product CG18437 (252 aa long) matches the N-terminal end of the F25C8.3 and 2q34-X proteins. Analysis of the Drosophila genomic segment containing this gene (accession number AE003762) unveiled a putative product of 3044 aa, similar to both human 2q34-X and C. elegans F25C8.3 along its whole length (Fig. 3 B). Therefore, we have identified an evolutionary conserved gene family that encodes proteins of ∼3000 aa, spanning 10 kb in C. elegans, 40 kb inDrosophila, and 200 kb in human. The predicted proteins do not contain any known domain or similarity to other known proteins that might provide us with a clue as to their function. These data provide evidence that 2q34-X represents a true transcription unit encoding a functional protein. Indeed, when the human predicted protein was used in searches with TBLASTN, we detected multiple matching ESTs distributed over its whole length. Among these, we found evidence for fusion transcripts including 5′ regions of 2q34-X and the majority of the coding region ofSNAIL-like, similar although not identical to the gene prediction described above. Other ESTs contained exons surrounding the point of insertion of SNAIL-like, but not retrotransposed sequences, pointing to a complex transcriptional profile including both independent and fusion transcripts. The possible presence of both independent and fusion transcripts from the2q34-X and SNAIL-like genes led us to analyze their relative expression patterns. Because of the similarity betweenSNAIL and SNAIL-like sequences, they cross-hybridize when used as probes in Northern blot analyses. Thus, we selected several cell lines, including MCF7 because it expressesSNAIL-like but not SNAIL. A transcript of the expected size of complete SNAIL-like or SNAILtranscripts (around 2 kb) was detected in MCF7, MDA, and A375P RNA preparations, indicating that at least in the MCF-7 cell line, independent SNAIL-like transcripts are present. In addition, signals for transcripts of more than 6.5 kb were observed in A375P, which may correspond to a fusion transcript with 2q34-Xexons (not shown). To compare the expression of 2q34-X andSNAIL-like by RT-PCR, we designed primers to amplify two regions of the putative 2q34-X protein coding sequence, boxes A and B, that surround the point of insertion of the retrotransposed fragment in human, C. elegans andDrosophila (Fig. 3). These boxes were chosen since similar sequences were found in mouse ESTs and in genomic sequences from the teleost fish Takifugu rubripes and the urochordateCiona intestinalis, extending the phylogenetic range where this new gene is present (Fig.4 A). We detected Box B transcripts in adult brain and pancreas (Fig. 4 B) and in the melanoma A375P and colon carcinoma LoVo cells (Fig. 4 C), a subset of those cell lines expressing SNAIL-like. The same results were obtained for the amplification of Box A in all cases (not shown). To discard the possibility that some SNAIL-likeamplifications originated from fusion transcripts, we performed a RT-PCR analysis with primers specific to its 5′-UTR, absent from both the gene prediction and the EST fusion transcripts. The expression profile obtained was identical to that described (Figs. 2, Aand B, and 4 C), corroborating the existence of independent SNAIL-like transcripts. To identify the possible function ofSNAIL-like, we overexpressed the coding region of the retrotransposed gene in a cell line (MDCK) and compared its effects with those observed after overexpression of the originalSNAIL gene. We have previously shown that stable transfectants of mouse Snail in these cells causes a dramatic change in phenotype (epithelial to fibroblastic), mirroring the EMT observed in developing embryos (10Cano A. Perez-Moreno M.A. Rodrigo I. Locascio A. Blanco M.J. del Barrio M.G. Portillo F. Nieto M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 76-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (2944) Google Scholar). Parental MDCK cells and mock transfectant cells grow as a polarized monolayer with E-cadherin localized at cell junctions (Fig.5 A). In contrast, both SNAIL and SNAIL-like transfected cells adopted a spindle-like shape, down-regulate E-cadherin expression, and no longer established tight cell junctions (Fig. 5 A). The loss of E-cadherin was confirmed by RT-PCR analysis (data not shown). Thus,SNAIL-like maintains the capacity to induce EMTs associated with the loss of E-cadherinexpression in MDCK cells. This is not a property of particular constitutively expressing clones, since it is also observed in an inducible system. We have used a tamoxifen-inducible system to express SNAIL and SNAIL-like in MCDK cells and found that the transfected cells, which also express EGFP, have lost E-cadherin expression at the cell junctions (Fig.5 B). To further characterize the effect of SNAIL andSNAIL-like overexpression on MDCK cells, we analyzed their migratory properties in a wound healing assay with the stable transformants (Fig. 6). Twelve hours after the incision was made, cultures of mock transfectants showed no signs of wound healing (Fig. 6, A and B), whereasSNAIL and SNAIL-like transfectants invaded the area of the wound after only 6 h (Fig. 6, C–F). The invasiveness of the cells was determined by assaying their capacity to migrate through a collagen matrix. Only cells expressingSNAIL or SNAIL-like were able to go through the collagen gel (Fig. 6, G–I). Thus, SNAIL-like has the capacity to induce a fibroblastic transformation and to render MDCK epithelial cells migratory and invasive. To check the ability of SNAIL-like to repress the activity of the E-cadherin promoter, we co-transfected SNAI1- and SNAI1L-pZeovectors with a reporter luciferase construct containing the mouse proximal E-cadherin promoter (10Cano A. Perez-Moreno M.A. Rodrigo I. Locascio A. Blanco M.J. del Barrio M.G. Portillo F. Nieto M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 76-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (2944) Google Scholar) in the mouse MCA3D keratinocyte cell line, which expresses high levels of E-cadherin. This promoter fragment contains the specific binding site for Snail-mediated repression (10Cano A. Perez-Moreno M.A. Rodrigo I. Locascio A. Blanco M.J. del Barrio M.G. Portillo F. Nieto M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 76-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (2944) Google Scholar). The average values obtained in nine independent experiments are shown in Fig. 7. The strongest repression (60% of the control value) was observed when cotransfecting the mouse E-cadherin promoter with a mouseSnail construct. SNAIL and SNAIL-likeare weaker repressors, surely due to being human proteins working in a mouse context (both promoter and cell line). Nevertheless,SNAIL-like cotransfected cells showed 45% of the repressor activity evidenced by SNAIL. Gene duplication is one of the driving forces that model genomes during evolution (43Lynch M. Conery J.S. Science. 2000; 290: 1151-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (3389) Google Scholar). Retrotransposition has been considered as one of the possible mechanisms responsible for these events (25Brosius J. Science. 1991; 251: 753Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). However, although examples of reverse transcription and insertion of an mRNA are well documented (17Brosius J. Gene. 1999; 238: 115-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), cases of functional duplicates with proven biological significance are very rare. In this work we show that a retrotransposed copy of human SNAILpreviously described as a non-active pseudogene, SNAI1P (15Paznekas W.A. Okajima K. Schertzer M. Wood S. Jabs E.W. Genomics. 1999; 62: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar,16Twigg S.R. Wilkie A.O. Hum Genet. 1999; 105: 320-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), encodes a fully functional factor that retains some of the key roles in directing cellular phenotype. This is one of the few examples, if not the only one, of a duplicated transcription factor originated by retrotransposition that re"

Although progress has been made in the identification of cell-signaling proteins that participate in the VEGF-induced response, questions remain concerning the molecular interactions that allow coupling of receptor activation with an increased cellular response. Evidence is provided in this manuscript that indicates a role for the fibroblast growth factor receptor substrate 2 (FRS2) in VEGF-induced signal transduction. VEGF treatment of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and KDR-transfected porcine aortic endothelial cells leads to the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of FRS2. FRS2 is associated constitutively with KDR, and VEGF treatment has no effect on this interaction. VEGF treatment of KDR-expressing cells leads to the recruitment of Nck, p21-activated kinase, Crk, Grb2, and protein kinase C l to FRS2. The ability of FRS2 to recruit cell-signaling proteins to the cell is significant because it provides a mechanism for enhancing the repertoire of VEGF-induced signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2003731113,"ACE inhibition protects the heart against ischemic injury by reducing angiotensin II and promoting bradykinin (BK) accumulation. Since neutral endopeptidase (NEP) metabolizes BK, we determined its activity after induction of myocardial infarction (MI) and examined whether it is influenced by treatment with an ACE inhibitor or AT1 receptor blocker. Rats were studied 6 days and 3 wk after coronary occlusion. Starting 48 h after MI induction, additional animals were treated with the ACE inhibitor quinapril (2 mg x kg(-1) x day-1) or the AT1 blocker irbesartan (50 mg x kg(-1) x day-1). Animals were hemodynamically characterized. Finally, NEP-specific activity and BK concentrations were detected in homogenates of heart compartments. Quinapril and irbesartan treatment improved left ventricular function 6 days and 3 wk after MI induction, and NEP activity was elevated only in the infarcted area of untreated compared with sham-operated rats. After 6 days, irbesartan reversed this increase by 80% and quinapril by 35%. Quinapril had no effect after 3 wk, whereas irbesartan almost completely blocked the increased NEP activity in the infarcted area and concomitantly induced a further rise in the BK concentrations. These results indicate mechanisms of NEP regulation influenced by the AT1 receptor. Our data suggest that NEP is more decisive than ACE in mediating BK degradation and may indicate BK involvement in the cardioprotective effects of AT1 antagonists."

https://openalex.org/W2072761282,"In in vitro experiments, prenylcysteine lyase (Pcly) cleaves the thioether bond of prenylcysteines to yield free cysteine and the aldehyde of the isoprenoid lipid. However, the importance of this enzyme has not yet been fully defined at the biochemical or physiologic level. In this study, we show that Pcly is expressed at high levels in mouse liver, kidney, heart, and brain. To test whether Pclydeficiency would cause prenylcysteines to accumulate in tissues and result in pathologic consequences, we producedPcly-deficient cell lines and Pcly-deficient mice (Pcly–/–). Pcly activity levels were markedly reduced in Pcly–/– cells and tissues.Pcly–/– fibroblasts were more sensitive than wild-type fibroblasts to growth inhibition when prenylcysteines were added to the cell culture medium. To determine if the reduced Pcly enzyme activity levels led to an accumulation of prenylcysteines within cells, mass spectrometry was used to measure farnesylcysteine and geranylgeranylcysteine levels in the tissues of Pcly–/– mice and wild-type controls. These studies revealed a striking accumulation of both farnesylcysteine and geranylgeranylcysteine in the brain and liver of Pcly–/– mice. This accumulation did not appear to be accompanied by significant pathologic consequences.Pcly–/– mice were healthy and fertile, and surveys of more than 30 tissues did not uncover any abnormalities.

Protein prenylation involves the covalent attachment a 15-carbon farnesyl or a 20-carbon geranylgeranyl lipid to cysteine residue(s) at or near the carboxyl terminus of a protein via a thioether bond. There are two categories of prenylated proteins in mammalian cells, the Rab proteins and the CAAX 1CAAX is a sequence motif found at the carboxyl terminus of many prenylated proteins, representing a cysteine (C), a pair of aliphatic amino acids (A), and then a final amino acid residue (X). 1CAAX is a sequence motif found at the carboxyl terminus of many prenylated proteins, representing a cysteine (C), a pair of aliphatic amino acids (A), and then a final amino acid residue (X).proteins. The Rab proteins are geranylgeranylated at a pair of carboxyl-terminal cysteines (4Seabra M.C. Goldstein J.L. Südhof T.C. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14497-14503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Farnsworth C.C. Seabra M.C. Ericsson L.H. Gelb M.H. Glomset J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11963-11967Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). CAAX proteins are either farnesylated or geranylgeranylated at the carboxyl-terminal cysteine (the C of the CAAX motif) (1Casey P.J. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1731-1740Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Casey P.J. Seabra M.C. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1719) Google Scholar). After prenylation, CAAX proteins generally undergo two additional modifications. First, the last three residues of the protein (i.e. the AAX of the CAAX motif) are endoproteolytically released. Second, the newly exposed isoprenylcysteine residue is methylated, converting the carboxylate anion of the isoprenylcysteine residue to an α-carboxyl methyl ester (6Young S.G. Ambroziak P. Kim E. Clarke S. Tamanoi F. Sigman D.S. The Enzymes. 21. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2000: 155-213Google Scholar). S-Prenylation of cysteines within proteins is a highly stable posttranslational modification. The stability of the modification and the abundance of isoprenylated proteins in cells suggested the existence of an enzymatic mechanism for degrading and disposing of prenylcysteine residues. Such an enzyme, termed prenylcysteine lyase (Pcly),2was recently identified (7Zhang L. Tschantz W.R. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23354-23359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 8Tschantz W.R. Zhang L. Casey P.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 2321-2324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Pcly is a 505-amino acid flavin adenine dinucleotide-dependent thioether oxidase and is located within lysosomes (8Tschantz W.R. Zhang L. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35802-35808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 9Tschantz W.R. Digits J.A. Pyun H.-J. Coates R.M. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2321-2324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Pcly recognizes both farnesylcysteine and geranylgeranylcysteine and their methyl esters with high affinity and cleaves the thioether bond to yield free cysteine (or cysteine methyl ester) and the aldehyde of the isoprenoid lipid (7Zhang L. Tschantz W.R. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23354-23359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Pcly is only active against free prenylcysteines and not prenylcysteine residues within prenylated proteins or peptides (7Zhang L. Tschantz W.R. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23354-23359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In humans,PCLY is expressed ubiquitously, with particularly high levels in brain, liver, kidney, and heart (7Zhang L. Tschantz W.R. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23354-23359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Although the ability of recombinant PCLY to cleave prenylcysteinesin vitro has been amply established (7Zhang L. Tschantz W.R. Casey P.J. J. Biol.

We do not know, for example, whether the absence of this enzyme would cause prenylcysteines to accumulate in mammalian cells since an alternate “disposal method,” transport out of cells by cell-surface P-glycoprotein, has been suggested by the finding that prenylcysteines are substrates for that transporter (10Zhang L. Sachs C.W., Fu, H.-W. Fine R.L. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22859-22865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). If prenylcysteines were to accumulate, would they cause cell toxicity or tissue pathology? Also located within lysosomes is a thioesterase, palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1 (PPT1), that cleaves fatty acids from acylated cysteines within proteins. Mutations in PPT1 cause a lysosomal storage disease in humans, infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (Batten disease) (11Vesa J. Hellsten E. Verkruyse L.A. Camp L.A. Rapola J. Santavuori P. Hofmann S.L. Peltonen L. Nature. 1995; 376: 584-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). By analogy, Tschantz et al. (8Tschantz W.R. Zhang L. Casey P.J. J. Biol.

To address each of these issues and to better define the in vivo importance of this enzyme, we produced and analyzed Pcly-deficient mice and Pcly-deficient cell lines. Site-directed mutagenesis (12Jones D.H. Howard B.H. BioTechniques. 1991; 10: 62-66PubMed Google Scholar) was used to introduce a variety of missense mutations into PCLYcDNA. The mutant PCLY cDNAs were used to produce recombinant baculoviruses, which were then used to infect Sf9 cells (8Tschantz W.R. Zhang L. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35802-35808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). A total of 2.5 × 106 infected Sf9 cells were harvested and resuspended in 10 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.7) containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors (8Tschantz W.R. Zhang L. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35802-35808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The cells were incubated on ice for 15 min and then disrupted by drawing the solution up and down ten times through a 27-gauge needle. Samples were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 90 min at 4 °C. The supernatant fluid (detergent extract) was collected, and the protein concentration was determined by a Lowry assay (13Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All mutant proteins were expressed at similar levels as judged by immunoblot analysis with a PCLY-specific antibody (8Tschantz W.R. Zhang L. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35802-35808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). PCLY activities in cell or tissue extracts were assessed by thin-layer chromatography (8Tschantz W.R. Zhang L. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35802-35808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μg of protein was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.7) containing 10 μm[35S]farnesylcysteine (∼40,000 dpm/reaction) in a final volume of 20 μl. The reaction was stopped by adding 10 μl of the thin-layer chromatography solvent (n-propanol:NH4OH:H2O (6:3:1, v/v)). Samples were processed by silica-gel thin-layer chromatography with a method that separates the reaction product, [35S]cysteine, from the substrate, [35S]farnesylcysteine (8Tschantz W.R. Zhang L. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35802-35808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To assess the amount of [35S]cysteine in each reaction, the plates were exposed to x-ray film. A human PCLYcDNA (GenBankTM accession number AF181490) was used to identify a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone that spanned the mouse Pcly gene. A 9.8-kb XbaI fragment containing Pcly exons 4–6 was subcloned into pCR-XL-TOPO (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The XbaI fragment was used to construct a gene-targeting vector designed to eliminate exon 6 of Pcly and replace it with a neomycin-resistance marker. The vector was generated in pKSloxPNT, which contains polylinker restriction sites, a thymidine kinase gene (tk), and a neomycin-resistance marker flanked by loxP sites. The 5′ arm of the vector contained 2.5 kb of sequences extending from intron 4 to the end of intron 5; the 5′ arm was amplified with oligonucleotides 5′-TGGCGGATCCGAGAGGGCATGGGAAAACATGCAGTTCTTAGTGCTT-3′ and 5′-CCTCGGATCCGAGGGTCATCTGACAGCGTCTGGAGGCATTTGGGGC-3′ and cloned into the BamHI site of pKSloxPNT. The 3′ arm of the vector began with the 3′-untranslated sequences and extended 5.2 kb downstream of the Pcly gene. The 3′ arm was amplified with oligonucleotides 5′-TGAGGCGCGCCCCTCCCCCGAGCGTCCTGCTCTCCAAGGACCGAGT-3′ and 5′-CGAGGCGCGCCCGAGCTGCAGCAGAGGGCGGTGGGGGAGGGGGTGC-3′ and then was cloned into the AscI site of pKSloxPNT. The orientation of both arms was verified by DNA sequencing and restriction endonuclease mapping. The sequence-replacement gene-targeting vector was linearized with NotI and introduced by electroporation into mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells (strain 129/SvJae). Mouse ES cells were cultured on mitomycin C-treated STO feeder cells in medium containing G418 (250 μg/ml) and 1-(2′-deoxy-2′fluoro-β-d-arabinofuranosyl)-5-iodouracil (0.2 μm) (14Bergo M.O.

Drug-resistant ES cell colonies were picked on the 10th day after electroporation. Targeted colonies (Pcly+/–) were identified by Southern blot analysis ofXbaI-digested genomic DNA with a 3′ flanking probe amplified from BAC DNA with primers 5′-AATACATCGTCCTTAACAATTTGA-3′ and 5′-TACCATCTGAGCCACACCACCAGC-3′. Four targeted clones, each with a single integration event, were injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts (15McMahon A.P. Bradley A. Cell. 1990; 62: 1073-1085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar) to produce chimeric mice, which were bred to establish lines ofPcly knockout mice. All mice described here had a mixed genetic background (∼50% C57BL/6 and ∼50% 129/SvJae). The mice were weaned at 21 days of age, housed in a barrier facility with a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle, and fed a chow diet containing 4.5% fat (Ralston Purina, St. Louis, MO). Total RNA was isolated from 50–150 mg of mouse tissue or from cells growing on 100-mm Petri dishes with Tri Reagent (Sigma). Total RNA (25 μg) was separated by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose/formaldehyde gel and then transferred onto a Nytran SuPerCharge membrane (Schleicher & Schuell, Keene, NH). In one experiment, a mouse multiple-tissue poly(A)+ RNA blot (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) was used to examine the tissue pattern of Pclyexpression in adult mice. Signals on Northern blots were visualized by autoradiography (Hyperfilm ECL, Amersham Biosciences) and quantified by densitometry (Molecular Imager FX, BioRad, Hercules, CA).Pcly cDNA probes were prepared by PCR. The following exons were prepared: an exon 4–6 probe was prepared with oligonucleotides 5′-GCACAGACATCAACGCCTTTGTAGG-3′ and 5′-GTAATAGAGCCGGTCGTGGAGGATG-3′; an exon 4–5 probe with oligonucleotides 5′-GAAAAGTTGATGCACGCCATCG-3′ and 5′-ACCGTTACCAGTCCCATGAC-3′; an exon 6 probe with oligonucleotides 5′-CCTTTGAACCGGAAGATGTCCAAC-3′ and 5′-GTAATAGAGCCGGTCGTGGAGGATG-3′. A glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probe (Ambion, Austin, TX) was used as a control for RNA integrity and equal loading. [α-32P]dCTP-labeled cDNA probes were prepared with a Rediprime II kit (AmershamBiosciences). Standard prehybridization, hybridization, and washing procedures were used (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Homozygous Pclyknockout ES cells (Pcly–/–) were generated from twoPcly+/– ES cell clones by selection in high concentrations of G418 (3–4 mg/ml) (17Mortensen R.M. Conner D.A. Chao S. Geisterfer-Lowrance A.A.T. Seidman J.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2391-2395Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Surviving colonies were picked and genotyped by Southern blot analysis. Timed matings were established between Pcly+/– mice, and pregnant females were sacrificed 13.5–17.5 days post coitus. Embryos were digested overnight in 5 ml of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) at 4 °C. The next morning, embryos were mechanically disrupted in 5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine, nonessential amino acids, penicillin, streptomycin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma). After removal of the debris, cells were then plated in T175 flasks. Fibroblast cell lines were immortalized by serial passaging (18Todaro G.J. Green H. J. Cell Biol. 1963; 17: 299-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (1984) Google Scholar). Pcly+/+,Pcly+/–, and Pcly–/– cells were plated on 96-well plates (5,000 cells/well, 12 wells/cell line, two independent cell lines/genotype) and incubated for 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 h. At each time point, cell density was determined with the CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution cell proliferation assay (Promega, Madison, WI). In some experiments, cells were incubated with different concentrations of farnesylcysteine methyl ester (FCME) or geranylgeranylcysteine methyl ester (GGCME) for 96 h. Prenylcysteine compounds (FC, FCME, GGC, GGCME) were synthesized and purified as described (10Zhang L. Sachs C.W., Fu, H.-W. Fine R.L. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22859-22865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Nine-month-old Pcly+/+ andPcly–/– mice were anesthetized with avertin, and samples of blood, liver, and brain were obtained. Tissues or blood samples were pooled from 8–10 mice of each genotype. Levels of farnesylcysteine (FC) and geranylgeranylcysteine (GGC) in tissues of Pcly+/+ and Pcly–/– mice were determined by mass spectrometry. Briefly, tissue samples were homogenized in 3 volumes (w/v) of 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.7), and the resultant extracts were processed by the bioanalytical laboratory of PPD Discovery (Madison, WI); blood samples were provided directly to the laboratory without prior homogenization. Tissue extracts and blood samples were subjected to the following extraction technique: to each of three independent 25-μl samples (tissue homogenate or blood) was added 75 μl of acetonitrile containing 5 pmol of geranylcysteine (GC, used as an internal standard to monitor efficiency of extraction and recovery during liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis). Samples were mixed for 5 min at room temperature and centrifuged for 5 min at 5000 × g in a tabletop centrifuge, and the supernatant fluids were transferred to a 0.2-ml polypropylene injection vial and capped. Samples were then injected into a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Sciex API3000 Triple Quadrupole liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry mass spectrometer fitted with a C18 separation column. The column was developed with a gradient of water to acetonitrile; both solvents contained 0.1% formic acid for ion-suppression during the chromatography. In preliminary trial and calibration separations, the elution positions for GC, FC, and GGC were identified; unambiguous identification of all three prenylcysteines was afforded by direct mass spectrometric analysis of the eluted compounds. Standard curves for concentrations from 10–5000 nm of each metabolite (FC, GGC) were generated by analysis of pure standards dissolved in acetonitrile. The levels of FC and GGC in each of the samples analyzed were determined from comparison of the peak areas for each compound with the standard curves, and the values were converted to units of nmol/gram of starting material (i.e. tissue or blood). Full necropsies were performed on four different 4- and 10-month-oldPcly–/– mice and littermate Pcly+/+ controls, and more than 30 tissues were examined by routine histology. To determine whether the brains of 10-month-old Pcly–/– mice contained increased amounts of lipofuscin, we examined brain tissue for autofluorescence as described recently for mice lacking palmitoyl protein thioesterase I (19Gupta P. Soyombo A.A. Atashband A. Wisniewski K.E. Shelton J.M. Richardson J.A. Hammer R.E. Hofmann S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13566-13571Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). For these studies, 10-month-oldPcly+/+, Pcly+/–, and Pcly–/– mice were anesthetized with avertin and perfusion-fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were removed and immersed in formalin for 24 h. Samples were processed for paraffin embedding, and sagittal sections (5–10 μm) were mounted on polylysine-coated slides. Deparaffinized sections from each sample were examined with a UV-equipped Eclipse E600 microscope (Nikon) at 470 nm (excitation)/525 nm (emission). Finally, to determine if Pcly–/– ES cells had any lysosomal abnormalities, and in particular a lysosomal storage disease phenotype, we examined Pcly–/– andPcly+/+ ES cells by transmission electron microscopy.Pcly–/– and Pcly+/+ ES cells were also examined 10 days after they had been mitotically inactivated with mitomycin C. Pcly expression in wild-type mouse tissues was determined by multiple-tissue Northern blot analysis. A major Pcly transcript, ∼4 kb in length, was detected in all tissues. The highest levels of Pclyexpression were in the liver, kidney, heart, and brain (Fig.1 A). In addition to the 4-kb transcript, a 5-kb transcript was detected in liver, kidney, and brain; a smaller 1.5–2-kb band was present in liver and kidney. We identified a strain 129/Sv BAC spanning the entire Pcly gene and also identified within GenBankTM an expressed sequence tag containing the complete mouse Pcly coding sequences (accession no. AK004799). The protein-coding sequences in the BAC and the expressed sequence tag were identical (Fig. 1 B). To inactivate Pcly, we adopted a strategy to eliminate the carboxyl-terminal portion of the protein (sequences encoded by exon 6, see Fig. 1 B). We were confident that removal of this large segment of the protein would cause a null mutation because site-directed mutagenesis experiments revealed that several different missense mutations in that segment of the gene abolished Pcly enzymatic activity (Fig. 1 C). After electroporation of the gene-targeting vector (Fig. 1 D) into ES cells, we identified seven targeted clones (from a total of 294). Four ES clones were used to produce Pcly+/– and Pcly–/– mice. NoPcly transcripts were detectable in Pcly–/– tissues when the Northern blot was hybridized with exon 6 sequences. Small amounts of a truncated transcript were observed when the Northern blot was hybridized with a cDNA probe containing sequences from exons 4–5 (Fig. 1 E). Pcly–/– ES cells were generated by high-G418 selection (17Mortensen R.M. Conner D.A. Chao S. Geisterfer-Lowrance A.A.T. Seidman J.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2391-2395Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). As expected, the full-length Pcly mRNA was absent in Pcly–/– ES cells (Fig.2 A). Pcly activity levels in the Pcly–/– ES cells were reduced by more than 90%, as judged by an assay that measures the production of [35S]cysteine from [35S]farnesylcysteine (Fig. 2 B). Similar results were obtained withPcly–/– fibroblasts. The 4-kb Pcly transcript was undetectable in Pcly–/– fibroblasts (Fig.2 C), and Pcly activity levels were reduced significantly (Fig. 2 D). Pcly-deficient cells—both ES cells and fibroblasts—appeared normal morphologically. The growth rates of Pcly–/– and Pcly+/+fibroblasts were indistinguishable under standard culture conditions (Fig. 3 A), as were those ofPcly–/– and Pcly+/+ ES cells (not shown). Because of the known pharmacological effects and toxicity associated with treatment of cells with prenylcysteines (20Philips M.R. Pillinger M.H. Staud R. Volker C. Rosenfeld M.G. Weissmann G. Stock J.B. Science. 1993; 259: 977-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 21Parish C.A. Brazil D.P. Rando R.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2686-2693Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the deficiency in Pcly activity might renderPcly–/– fibroblasts more susceptible to toxicity or growth inhibition by exogenous prenylcysteine compounds. To test this possibility, Pcly–/– and Pcly+/+fibroblasts were grown for 4 days in the presence of increasing concentrations (up to 50 μm) of either FCME (Fig.3 B) or GGCME (Fig. 3 C). While treatment with both these prenylcysteines retarded cell growth in fibroblasts regardless of the genotype, the Pcly–/– cells were significantly more sensitive to the growth inhibition than Pcly+/+ cells (Fig.3, B and C). We considered the possibility that the observed differences could have been due to the release of methanol from FCME and GGCME within the cell culture medium. However, we doubt that this is the case. Adding methanol (at concentrations up to 250 μm) to the cell culture medium did not retard the growth of either Pcly+/+ or Pcly–/–fibroblasts (data not shown). Direct measurements of Pcly activity in extracts of tissues from wild-type mice showed that the highest activity levels were in the liver, followed by kidney, brain, and heart (Fig. 4 A). Consistent with the data obtained from the Pcly–/– cells (see Fig. 2), enzyme activities were markedly reduced in tissues derived from Pcly–/– mice (reductions of 90%, 97%, 92%, and 74% in liver, kidney, brain, and heart, respectively) (Fig.4 A). To determine if the reduction in Pcly activity levels inPcly–/– mice would lead to an accumulation of the substrates of the enzyme (i.e. endogenous prenylcysteines derived from prenyl-protein turnover) instead of being simply transported out of the tissue, we used mass spectrometry to measure levels of prenylcysteines in blood, brain, and liver of 9-month-oldPcly–/– and Pcly+/+ mice. Indeed, while blood levels of prenylcysteines were virtually unaffected in the setting ofPcly-deficiency, this analysis revealed an impressive accumulation of FC in liver and brain of Pcly–/– mice (50- and 40-fold increase, respectively) (Fig. 4 B). Geranylgeranylcysteine also accumulated in liver (10-fold) and brain (30-fold) of Pcly–/– mice (Fig. 4 C). We did not observe an accumulation of prenylcysteines in the blood ofPcly–/– mice, perhaps because few prenylcysteines are released into the blood or because those substances are cleared rapidly from that compartment. We also attempted to quantify levels of prenylcysteine methyl esters in tissues by mass spectrometry, but were unable to detect these compounds due to the lability of these methyl esters in tissue extracts. When FCME and GGCME were added exogenously to tissue extracts, they were rapidly and completely converted to the corresponding demethylated compounds (i.e. FC, GGC) (not shown). Hence, we believe that the analysis of FC and GGC in the tissue extracts accurately reflected the total level of farnesylated and geranylgeranylated cysteines in these tissues. /–Mice—The accumulation of prenylcysteine residues did not appear to result in significant consequences. Blood chemistries including calcium, phosphate, glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and creatinine were normal in Pcly–/– mice; serum lipids inPcly–/– and Pcly+/+ mice did not differ on a high-fat diet (not shown). In addition, we analyzed more than 30 different tissues from 4- and 10-month-old Pcly–/– mice with routine histologic stains, and observed no abnormalities. In the case of palmitoyl protein thioesterase I-deficient mice, the presence of lipofuscin was particularly apparent by fluorescence microscopy (19Gupta P. Soyombo A.A. Atashband A. Wisniewski K.E. Shelton J.M. Richardson J.A. Hammer R.E. Hofmann S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13566-13571Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). To determine if increased levels of prenylcysteines might lead to increased autofluorescence within tissues, we examined brain sections from 10-month-old Pcly+/+ andPcly–/– mice with a UV-equipped microscope. Regardless of the genotype, autofluorescence levels were highest in the cerebellum, but lower levels of autofluorescence could also be detected in pons, hippocampus, and frontal cortex. However, we did not observe any differences in the levels of autofluorescence in brains of Pcly+/+ and Pcly–/– mice (not shown). To look for abnormalities in intracellular organelles, we examinedPcly+/+ and Pcly–/– ES cells by transmission electron microscopy, after staining the cells with imidazole-osmium tetroxide (which stains unsaturated lipids). No differences were observed in Pcly–/– and Pcly+/+ ES cells. The lysosomes appeared normal, and there was no increase lipid-staining material anywhere within the cell (not shown). Protein prenylation, unlike many other posttranslational modifications, is a stable modification of proteins. Prenylated proteins have a half-life of ∼20 h and comprise ∼2% of total cellular proteins (7Zhang L. Tschantz W.R. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23354-23359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 8Tschantz W.R. Zhang L. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35802-35808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The relatively short half-life of prenyl-proteins, along with the stability of the modification, suggested that cells must possess a mechanism for disposal of prenylcysteines. Previous studies identified an enzyme, Pcly, capable of degrading prenylcysteines in vitro (7Zhang L. Tschantz W.R. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23354-23359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 8Tschantz W.R. Zhang L. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35802-35808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 9Tschantz W.R. Digits J.A. Pyun H.-J. Coates R.M. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2321-2324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), but none of these studies addressed whether the enzyme was truly relevant or important for prenylcysteine metabolism in vivo. In the current study, we addressed the biochemical and physiologic importance of Pcly with a gene knockout experiment and were able to show, unequivocally, that Pcly is indeed relevant to prenylcysteine metabolism in mammalian tissues. Our studies establish that Pcly is the main enzymatic activity for degrading prenylcysteines in mammalian cells. Prenylcysteine lyase activity was markedly reduced in Pcly–/– ES cells, inPcly–/– fibroblasts, and in the tissues ofPcly–/– mice. In the majority of our experiments, enzymatic activities in Pcly–/– cells and tissues were at or just slightly above the background levels for our assay. Therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that very low levels of a redundant bioactivity exist in mammalian cells. We have looked for aPcly family member within the expressed sequence tag and genomic databases, for it is conceivable that another yet-to-be-identified gene encodes a protein that can metabolize prenylcysteines in the setting of Pcly deficiency. In the course of this data mining, we found a hypothetical human protein (GI:13278789) that exhibits 35% homology with a 330-amino acid segment of human PCLY. It would be of interest to determine whether that clone encodes an enzyme with some activity against prenylcysteines (i.e. a PCLY2). This possibility may not be farfetched. PPT1 is a lysosomal enzyme that removes palmitoyl groups from cysteines in proteins, and its absence causes infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (11Vesa J. Hellsten E. Verkruyse L.A. Camp L.A. Rapola J. Santavuori P. Hofmann S.L. Peltonen L. Nature. 1995; 376: 584-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Recently, cloning of a PPT2 gene has been reported (22Soyombo A.A. Hofmann S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27456-27463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that PPT1 and PPT2 share only 18% identity at the amino acid level, PPT1 and PPT2 have comparable palmitoyl-CoA thioesterase activities. Interestingly, PPT2 appears to display a distinct substrate specificity in cells, and its expression does not correct the metabolic defect in PPT1-deficient cells (22Soyombo A.A. Hofmann S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27456-27463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). There are two other reasons to think that Pcly is the principal route for disposing of prenylcysteines in cells, even if minute amounts of another prenylcysteine-degrading enzyme exist. First, mass spectrometric analysis showed a significant accumulation of both farnesylcysteine and geranylgeranylcysteine in the brain and liver ofPcly–/– mice compared with tissues from aged-matched control mice. Second, Pcly–/– fibroblasts, when challenged with increasing doses of exogenous prenylcysteines, displayed increased sensitivity to the toxicity of these compounds. We did not note an accumulation of prenylcysteines in the blood ofPcly–/– mice. We do not know the reason for the absence of prenylcysteine accumulation in blood, although we hypothesize that the production of prenylcysteines is probably minimal in erythrocytes. Alternatively, it is possible that prenylcysteines readily diffuse away from blood cells into the plasma and are rapidly cleared by the kidney. One could speculate that the accumulation of farnesylcysteine and geranylgeranylcysteine in brain and liver might inhibit the methylation of prenylated proteins by isoprenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase (6Young S.G. Ambroziak P. Kim E. Clarke S. Tamanoi F. Sigman D.S. The Enzymes. 21. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2000: 155-213Google Scholar). However, we do not consider this to be likely, because the concentrations of the prenylcysteines in the Pcly–/– cells were in the picomolar range, significantly below the micromolar concentrations required to inhibit isoprenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase (6Young S.G. Ambroziak P. Kim E. Clarke S. Tamanoi F. Sigman D.S. The Enzymes. 21. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2000: 155-213Google Scholar, 20Philips M.R. Pillinger M.H. Staud R. Volker C. Rosenfeld M.G.

In keeping with this prediction, we found that extracts from Pcly–/– cells andPcly+/+ cells were equally effective in methylating recombinant farnesyl-K-Ras. 3S. Withycombe and A. Beigneux, unpublished data. We had speculated that the absence of prenylcysteine lyase in mammalian lysosomes might cause, either directly or indirectly, a lysosomal storage disease (8Tschantz W.R. Zhang L. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35802-35808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 9Tschantz W.R. Digits J.A. Pyun H.-J. Coates R.M. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2321-2324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) akin to that occurring in the setting of PPT1 mutations (11Vesa J. Hellsten E. Verkruyse L.A. Camp L.A. Rapola J. Santavuori P. Hofmann S.L. Peltonen L. Nature. 1995; 376: 584-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar, 19Gupta P. Soyombo A.A. Atashband A. Wisniewski K.E. Shelton J.M.

U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10046-10050Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). A deficiency in PPT1 leads to the accumulation of a finely granular autofluorescent sudanophilic storage material (lipofuscin) in the brain (19Gupta P. Soyombo A.A. Atashband A. Wisniewski K.E. Shelton J.M. Richardson J.A. Hammer R.E. Hofmann S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13566-13571Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 25Lu J.Y. Verkruyse L.A. Hofmann S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10046-10050Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). However, no such pathologic findings were noted in Pcly–/– mice. We were unable to detect histologic abnormalities in a survey of more than 30 tissues from Pcly–/– mice, and there was no increase in autofluorescence within the brains of Pcly–/– mice. A key difference between PPT1 and Pcly is that PPT1 cleaves palmitate residues from proteins, whereas Pcly acts only on free prenylcysteines after the protein has been degraded. The accumulation of free prenylcysteines in the setting of Pcly deficiency (as opposed to palmitoylated proteins in the setting of PPT1deficiency) apparently has little proclivity to form lipofuscin either directly by inducing aggregation of proteins or indirectly by interfering with the action of other lysosomal enzymes. The absence of overt pathology in Pcly-deficient mice raises the possibility that the cell might have more than one strategy for dealing with prenylcysteines. In yeast, at least one isoprenylated peptide, a-factor, is transported out of cells by an ABC transporter, Ste6p (26Berkower C. Michaelis S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3777-3785Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). A related protein, P-glycoprotein, has been shown to be capable of transporting prenylcysteines out of human cells (10Zhang L. Sachs C.W., Fu, H.-W. Fine R.L. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22859-22865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In the setting of Pcly deficiency, it is conceivable that P-glycoprotein-mediated transport of prenylcysteines out of cells partially prevents the intracellular accumulation of prenylcysteines and thereby prevents the pathologic consequences of the enzyme deficiency. However, it is far from clear that P-glycoprotein functions in a meaningful way to dispose of prenylcysteine residues in normal cells. For example, prenylation of proteins is ubiquitous, but most mammalian tissues do not express appreciable levels of P-glycoprotein (27Ambudkar S.V. Dey S. Hrycyna C.A. Ramachandra M. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 361-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1897) Google Scholar). In conclusion, our data support the hypothesis that catabolism of prenylcysteines in mammals requires Pcly. In the absence of that enzyme, the cell's ability to cleave prenylcysteines is severely compromised, and prenylcysteine residues accumulate. Despite this accumulation, Pcly-deficient mice are born at the expected mendelian frequency, are fertile, and are free of obvious pathology. We thank J. Wong and R. Hamilton for transmission electron microscopy, D. Sanan for help with the fluorescence microscopy, and S. Ordway, and G. Howard for criticisms of the manuscript."

A pol β from the trypanosomatid parasite Crithidia fasciculata, however, is the first example of a mitochondrial enzyme of this type. The mammalian nuclear enzyme functions not only as a nucleotidyl transferase but also has a dRP lyase activity that cleaves 5′-deoxyribose phosphate (dRP) groups from DNA, thus contributing to two consecutive steps of the base excision repair pathway. We find that the mitochondrial pol β also has dRP lyase activity. Interestingly, the K m of this enzyme for a dRP-containing substrate is similar to that for the rat enzyme, but itsk cat is very low. This difference is due to a deficiency of the mitochondrial enzyme in the release of dRP from the enzyme following its cleavage from the DNA.

This order also includes Trypanosoma brucei, Trypanosoma cruzi, and Leishmaniasp., all of which are important human pathogens. C. fasciculata is an ideal model organism for these pathogens, especially for biochemical studies. The kinetoplastids are characterized by an unusual mitochondrial DNA, called kinetoplast DNA or kDNA.1 This structure contains thousands of topologically interlocked DNA minicircles condensed in vivo into a disk-shaped structure situated within the matrix of the cell's single mitochondrion near the base of the flagellum. For a review of kDNA see Ref. 1Shapiro T.A. Englund P.T. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1995; 49: 117-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar. The mechanism by which the kDNA network is replicated has been explored for many years (see Refs. 2Klingbeil M.M. Drew M.E. Liu Y. Morris J.C. Motyka S.A. Saxowsky T.T. Wang Z. Englund P.T. Protist. 2001; 152: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar and 3Morris J.C. Drew M.E. Klingbeil M.M. Motyka S.A. Saxowsky T.T. Wang Z. Englund P.T. Int. J. Parasitol. 2001; 31: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar for reviews). Several laboratories, including ours, have purified a number of C. fasciculataproteins involved in this process. The characterization of these proteins, both in terms of their enzymatic activities and their intramitochondrial locations, has provided considerable insight into how replication of this network occurs. Briefly, minicircles are released from the network into the kinetoflagellar zone, the space between the kDNA disk and the mitochondrial membrane near the basal body of the flagellum (4Drew M.E. Englund P.T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 735-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Here they encounter DNA primase (5Li C. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20787-20792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), universal minicircle sequence binding protein (an origin binding protein) (6Abu-Elneel K. Robinson D.R. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. Shlomai J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 725-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and two pol I-like DNA polymerases (7Klingbeil M.M. Motyka S.A. Englund P.T. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 175-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Because replication is unidirectional, the newly replicated minicircles include one sister with a single gap (the product of leading strand synthesis) and another with multiple gaps (the result of lagging strand synthesis). It is unclear whether replication is completed in the kinetoflagellar zone, but eventually newly replicated minicircles migrate to discrete sites flanking the kDNA disk, called the antipodal sites. At the antipodal sites, minicircles encounter SSE1 (8Engel M.L. Ray D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8455-8460Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), an enzyme with RNase H activity that is believed to remove the RNA primers (9Hines J.C. Engel M.L. Zhao H. Ray D.S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 115: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and DNA polymerase β (pol β) (10Ferguson M. Torri A.F. Ward D.C. Englund P.T. Cell. 1992; 70: 621-629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), an enzyme thought to fill in many of the gaps. Once this processing is complete, the newly replicated minicircles are reattached to the periphery of the network by a topoisomerase II (11Wang Z. Englund P.T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4674-4683Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) also located at the antipodal sites (12Melendy T. Sheline C. Ray D.S. Cell. 1988; 55: 1083-1088Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Ultimately, the remaining gaps are repaired and the double-sized network splits in two for segregation into daughter cells. The C. fasciculata pol β, the first mitochondrial enzyme of its type (13Torri A.F. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4786-4792Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is small, non-processive, error-prone, and not likely to be the replicative polymerase (14Torri A.F. Kunkel T.A. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8165-8171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This protein has a short N-terminal mitochondrial targeting signal sequence resembling other targeting signals in C. fasciculata and related parasites (15Hausler T. Stierhof Y.D. Blattner J. Clayton C. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 73: 240-251PubMed Google Scholar), and this signal is cleaved upon import of the protein into the mitochondrion (16Torri A.F. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3495-3497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the protein is only detectable in the antipodal sites while the kDNA is undergoing replication. During the remainder of the cell cycle, pol β is undetectable by immunofluorescence, although Western blot analysis on synchronized cultures indicates that protein level does not change (17Johnson C.E. Englund P.T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 911-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This finding raises the possibility that the pol β may have some role other than gap filling during replication. In higher eukaryotes, pol β is found in the nucleus and involved primarily in base excision repair. Enzymes in this pathway recognize and correct damage such as misincorporated uracil and oxidized or alkylated bases. The damaged base is removed by a specific DNA glycosylase, leaving the sugar phosphate backbone intact and creating an abasic site (AP site). An AP endonuclease cleaves 5′ of the AP site leaving a 3′-OH competent for nucleotide addition and a 5′-deoxyribose phosphate (dRP) moiety. The dRP group is removed by a dRP lyase, creating a single nucleotide gap that is filled in by a DNA polymerase. Finally, a DNA ligase seals the repaired strand. The mammalian nuclear pol β, in addition to its nucleotidyl transferase activity, catalyzes the dRP lyase reaction of the pathway (18Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Science. 1995; 269: 699-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). Thus, we were compelled to examine whether the C. fasciculata pol β also possesses this lyase activity, which might suggest a role for this protein in mitochondrial DNA repair. For expression of the full-length rat nuclear pol β in Escherichia coli, we used the vector pRSETBpol (18Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Science. 1995; 269: 699-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). Expression and purification were performed as previously described (19Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 98-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) with the exception of the order of columns being DEAE-cellulose, phosphocellulose, SP-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), and then ssDNA-cellulose (Amersham Biosciences). The final fractions from ssDNA-cellulose were dialyzed against buffer A (50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.6), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and concentrated in a Vivaspin 6 concentration device (Sartorius, 10000 MWCO). This purification yielded 8.7 mg of protein. Glycerol was added to 50%, and the protein was stored at −20 °C. Fig. 1 (lane 1) shows the preparation analyzed by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. We assayed for polymerase activity in a 25-μl reaction containing 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 9.0), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 μm [α-32P]dTTP (400 mCi/mmol), and a poly(dA):oligo(dT)18 substrate (where the (dT)18 primer was 5′-phosphorylated, dA nucleotide was in 2-fold molar excess over dT, and the concentration of the primer 3′-ends was 1 μm) for 10 min at 37 °C. Reaction mixtures were spotted onto DE81 filters (Whatman) that were then washed exhaustively in 0.5 m sodium phosphate (pH 7.1), washed in 80% ethanol, dried, and counted in a scintillation counter. The specific activity of the enzyme under these conditions was 1020 units/mg of protein where a unit is defined as the incorporation of 1 nmol of dTMP in 1 min. Although the buffer conditions are different, this value is similar to that previously published (20Menge K.L. Hostomsky Z. Nodes B.R. Hudson G.O. Rahmati S. Moomaw E.W. Almassy R.J. Hostomska Z. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15934-15942Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The rat coding sequence was excised from the vector usingNdeI and SalI and replaced with the coding sequence for the C. fasciculata pol β lacking the 9-amino acid mitochondrial targeting signal sequence (underlined in Fig. 2). After electroporation into E. coli BL21(DE3), expression of the untagged protein in a 1.5-liter culture was induced overnight at room temperature with 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The cells were centrifuged, resuspended in 15 ml of buffer B (50 mm Hepes (pH 7.6), 5 mm EDTA, 25 mm KCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) supplemented with 200 μg/ml lysozyme (Sigma), incubated on ice for 30 min, and lysed using a Dounce homogenizer with a tight-fitting pestle. The lysate was centrifuged (30,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C), and the supernatant was loaded onto a 40-ml DEAE-cellulose column in buffer B. The column was washed with 100 ml of buffer B, and the combined wash and flowthrough fractions were applied to a 10-ml SP-Sepharose column equilibrated with buffer B. The column was washed with 50 ml of buffer B and eluted with a 100-ml gradient to 0.6 m KCl in buffer B. Fractions containing pol β (0.13–0.27 m KCl) were pooled and dialyzed against buffer B. The dialyzed sample was applied to a 5-ml phosphocellulose column, washed with 25 ml of buffer B and eluted with an 80-ml gradient to 0.6 m KCl in buffer B. Fractions containing pol β (0.18–0.22 m KCl) were pooled, dialyzed into buffer B, and concentrated in a Vivaspin 6 concentration device (Sartorius, 10000 MWCO). This purification yielded 0.7 mg of protein. Glycerol was added to 50%, and protein was stored at −20 °C. Fig. 1 (lane 2) shows the preparation analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The specific activity of this enzyme in the polymerase assay was 36 units/mg of protein. Although this value is significantly lower than that for the rat enzyme, it is comparable to that of the native protein purified from C. fasciculata(Fraction 10, see Ref. 13Torri A.F. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4786-4792Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) on the same substrate (data not shown). To generate the K72A mutant of the C. fasciculata mitochondrial pol β, we performed PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis (21Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2080) Google Scholar) using primers K72A(F) (5′-CTGAAGGCCGCGGAGGAGATTATG) and K72A(R) (5′-TCCTCCGCGGCCTTCAGCAGCTTCG) to introduce the mutation. These primers introduced a new HaeIII restriction site, and clones were initially screened by HaeIII digestion. Positive clones were later verified by sequencing. The coding sequence was cloned into pRSET, the vector was electroporated into BL21(DE3) cells, and expression and purification were done as described for the wild-type protein above, except for one chromatography step. Between the SP-Sepharose column and the phosphocellulose column, the sample was applied to a 5-ml Affi-Gel Blue (Bio-Rad) column in buffer B. The column was eluted with a step gradient, and the mutant protein eluted between 0.4 and 0.6 m KCl in buffer B. This purification yielded 1.4 mg of protein, and circular dichroism spectroscopy verified that the mutation did not affect protein folding (data not shown). Fig.1 (lane 3) shows the preparation analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The specific activity of this protein in the polymerase assay was 2.5 units/mg of protein. The K72A mutation affects K m and not k cat (data not shown). For dRP lyase assays and Schiff base traps, a substrate consisting of B1 (5′-AGCTACCATGCCTGCACGAAC), B2U (5′-UAAGCAATTCGTAATCATGGTCATAGC), and the complementary B3 (5′-AGCTATGACCATGATTACGAATTGCTTAGTTCGTGCAGGCATGGTAGCT) was used. For base excision repair assays, a substrate consisting of U1 (5′-CCTGCCCTGUGCAGCTGT) and the complementary U2 (5′-CCCACAGCTGCACAGGGCAGG) was used. To prepare substrate for dRP lyase assays, 5 nmol of B2U oligonucleotide (a 28-mer with a 5′ U residue) was 5′-labeled by 25 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England BioLabs) in a reaction containing 0.7 μm[γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) under standard conditions. After 2 h at 37 °C, non-radioactive ATP (final concentration 0.625 mm) and another 25 units of enzyme were added, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for an additional 2 h. The enzyme was heat-inactivated, and the oligonucleotide was phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1, v/v) extracted, and then purified over two successive G-25 spin columns (Amersham Biosciences). The 32P-labeled product was then ethanol-precipitated overnight at −20 °C, and resuspended in 40 μl of H2O. A small fraction of the final product and of the reaction mixture prior to phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol extraction was run on a 20% polyacrylamide/7 m urea gel, and the final concentration of the product was determined by densitometry of the labeled bands using phosphorimaging (Fuji). Oligonucleotides B1 and B3 were then added to labeled B2U to the same final concentration in 10 mm KCl. The mixture was heated to 95 °C for 3 min and then cooled slowly to room temperature to anneal. The resulting substrate was analyzed on a non-denaturing 20% polyacrylamide gel to verify that it was double-stranded. The substrate consisting of oligonucleotides B1, 32P-labeled B2U, and B3 was pre-treated with E. coli uracil N-glycosylase (New England BioLabs) at 37 °C in a reaction containing 50 mm Hepes (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT. Lyase assays (10 μl) contained 50 mmHepes (pH 7.6) and 5 mm MgCl2 with oligonucleotide and enzyme concentrations as indicated in the figure legends. Where necessary, enzymes were diluted into 50 mmHepes (pH 7.6) immediately before addition to the reaction. Reaction components were mixed on ice and then incubated at 25 °C for 10 min, except reactions for kinetic determinations, which were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Reactions were quenched with 1 μl of 2% SDS, and then the products were reduced by addition of NaBH4 to a final concentration of 45 μm. After 20 min at 25 °C, 1 μl of the reaction was spotted onto a 10-cm PEI-cellulose thin layer chromatography plate that was then developed with 1.0 m formic acid. The plates were dried and exposed to x-ray film. Based on the autoradiograph, spots corresponding to the free dRP derivative and the origin were cut out and counted in a scintillation counter. Schiff base traps were similar to dRP lyase assays, except that following addition of NaBH4 the products were resolved by SDS-PAGE (10% gel). Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue to verify equal protein loading, dried onto Whatman 3MM paper, and autoradiographed. These assays were carried out essentially as described previously (22Longley M.J. Prasad R. Srivastava D.K. Wilson S.H. Copeland W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12244-12248Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) in a 10-μl reaction containing 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.6), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 4 mmATP, 85 nm [α-32P]dTTP (3000 Ci/mmol), and 1.5 μm uracil-containing oligonucleotide (U1/U2).E. coli uracil N-glycosylase (0.025 unit) was added, and reactions were preincubated at 37 °C for 10 min. E. coli AP endonuclease IV (0.025 unit, Trevigen), pol β (150 nm), and T4 DNA ligase (0.025 unit, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were added, and reactions were incubated on ice for 10 min. Finally, MgCl2, which is required for both AP endonuclease and DNA polymerase activity, was added to 5 mm, and the reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. Reactions were diluted 1:100 into formamide gel loading buffer, boiled for 3 min, and placed on ice for 5 min. A small amount (4 μl) of each mixture was loaded onto a 20-cm 20% polyacrylamide/7m urea gel and run for 2 h at 600 V at room temperature. Gels were wrapped and frozen at −80 °C, and the products were analyzed by autoradiography. The rat nuclear pol β can carry out the dRP lyase reaction, and the N-terminal 8 kDa of the protein is both necessary and sufficient for this step (18Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Science. 1995; 269: 699-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis experiments have identified amino acid residues critical for this activity. Lysines at positions 35, 60, and 68 (Fig. 2,asterisks) are important in the binding of ssDNA, and in addition, Lys-35 is essential for recognizing the 5′-phosphate group (23Prasad R. Beard W.A. Chyan J.Y. Maciejewski M.W. Mullen G.P. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11121-11126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Lysine 72 (Fig. 2, arrowhead) is the catalytic residue that forms the Schiff base with the substrate and facilitates β-elimination of the downstream DNA (23Prasad R. Beard W.A. Chyan J.Y.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6456-6464Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Finally, tyrosine 39 (Fig. 2, filled circle) is important for the dRP lyase activity (25Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Katz D.S. Feng J.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6456-6464Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and it has been suggested to promote proton transfer to the aldehyde upon attack of the catalytic lysine residue (26Maciejewski M.W. Liu D. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Mullen G.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 229-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Alignment of the 8-kDa domain of the rat nuclear enzyme with the corresponding portion of the C. fasciculata mitochondrial pol β sequence (Fig. 2) shows that all of the essential amino acid residues mentioned above are conserved. This observation supports the hypothesis that the mitochondrial pol β may possess dRP lyase activity. The dRP lyase reaction proceeds through multiple steps (Fig.3). Briefly, the 5′-dRP group exists in equilibrium with the ring-open aldehyde form of the sugar. This aldehyde undergoes nucleophilic attack by the catalytic lysine residue (Lys-72) of the protein (Step 1), resulting in formation of a Schiff base and yielding a covalent enzyme·DNA complex (E·DNA). A proton at the 2′ position is abstracted (Step 2), possibly by a carboxyl group on the protein, and a subsequent β-elimination reaction leads to release of the 3′-DNA and generates an enzyme·dRP (E·dRP) complex. Finally, a hydrolysis step (Step 3), again possibly facilitated by a carboxyl group on the protein, releases an unsaturated dRP derivative and regenerates the protein for another round of catalysis. To assess whether the C. fasciculata mitochondrial pol β has dRP lyase activity, we first examined whether Schiff base intermediates could be trapped by addition of NaBH4. We incubated pol β with a 32P-labeled dRP-containing substrate, and after reduction, we observed a single radiolabeled band corresponding in size to the mitochondrial protein and representing the enzyme·dRP (E·dRP) intermediate (Fig.4, lane 2). At longer exposures, the enzyme·DNA (E·DNA) complex can also be detected (see below, see Fig. 6 B), but at steady state the bulk of the protein exists as the E·dRP intermediate. This band was absent when pol β was omitted (lane 1), if the uracil was not removed (lane 4), or if the substrate was reduced with NaBH4 prior to addition of the pol β (lane 5). Heat inactivation of the mitochondrial pol β (50 °C, 5 min) prior to addition (lane 6) also abolished trapping, indicating that an appropriately folded protein is required. The rat nuclear protein was included (lane 7) as a positive control.Figure 6C. fasciculata mitochondrial pol β is deficient in release of unsaturated dRP. 32P-Labeled dRP lyase substrate (2.5 pmol) was incubated with 5 pmol of either rat nuclear pol β (A) or C. fasciculata mitochondrial pol β (B) for various times at 25 °C prior to addition of NaBH4 to reduce the intermediates. Of the 10-μl reaction mixture, 1 μl was spotted onto PEI-cellulose, and 4 μl was resolved by SDS-PAGE (10% gel). Resolution of the E·DNA and E·dRP complexes by 10% SDS-PAGE is shown in the top panels. Minor species migrating faster than E·DNA could correspond toE·DNA complexes missing oligonucleotide components of the DNA substrate. Separation of free unsaturated dRP on PEI-cellulose thin layer chromatography is shown in the bottom panels. The origin contains unreacted substrate as well as the E·DNA and E·dRP intermediates. The B2U oligonucleotide preparation contained a small amount of contaminating oligonucleotide that did not contain a uracil at the 5′-end, accounting for the radioactivity that remains in the origin even after 10 min. A control reaction lacking pol β was incubated for 10 min at 25 °C prior to NaBH4 addition and resolved on PEI-cellulose (C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We also examined Schiff base formation in a mutant C. fasciculata mitochondrial pol β (K72A) in which the catalytic lysine at position 72 was replaced with an alanine. This mutant protein is deficient in forming the Schiff base intermediate (Fig. 4,lane 9), as has been found in similar studies with the mammalian protein (23Prasad R. Beard W.A. Chyan J.Y. Maciejewski M.W. Mullen G.P. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11121-11126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 25Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Katz D.S. Feng J.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6456-6464Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The labeling of the K72A mutant is decreased 92% relative to that of the wild-type protein (lane 8) as determined by phosphorimaging. This decrease may be an underestimate given that there appears to be more Coomassie Blue-stained protein in the K72A lane. As mentioned earlier, the dRP lyase active site contains several lysine residues, and the residual labeling of mutant protein may be due to fortuitous nucleophilic attack from one of these other residues. To ensure that decreased labeling was not due to the protein's decreased ability to bind the substrate, we conducted a trapping experiment with the mutant protein in a reaction with 3-fold higher substrate concentration. There was no significant increase in the trapping of the mutant protein, and furthermore, PEI-cellulose of reaction products indicated that free unsaturated dRP was not generated above background levels for the K72A mutant (data not shown). We next examined whether the dRP lyase activity of the mitochondrial pol β was sufficient to allow the completion of a round of base excision repair. As a substrate we used a double-stranded 18-bp oligonucleotide (U1/U2) containing a U:A mismatch at position 10. We incubated this substrate with E. coli uracil N-glycosylase, followed by addition of E. coli AP endonuclease IV, mitochondrial pol β, and T4 DNA ligase in a reaction containing [α-32P]dTTP. When all components were included in the mixture, pol β incorporated the [32P]dTMP into a 10-nucleotide intermediate, which was then ligated into a full-length 18-nucleotide product, indicating that the dRP had been removed (Fig.5, lane 1). There was no incorporation if uracil N-glycosylase (lane 2), AP endonuclease (lane 3), or pol β (lane 4) were omitted, and when ligase was omitted (lane 5), the 10-nucleotide intermediate accumulated and was not converted to the full-length product. To show that spontaneous cleavage of the dRP or a contaminant in any of the other proteins added could not account for the incorporation of [α-32P]dTMP into the full-length ligated product, we conducted the same experiment using the K72A mutant. This mutant is active in nucleotide addition but unable to cleave dRP groups efficiently. As expected, the reaction containing the K72A mutant accumulated the 10-nucleotide intermediate (Fig 5, lane 6) and generated very little full-length product. This result contrasts with that involving the wild-type protein (lane 1), which efficiently converted most of the 10-nucleotide intermediate to a full-length product. Using PEI-cellulose thin layer chromatography to follow the generation of free 32P-labeled unsaturated dRP, we measured the kinetic parameters of the mitochondrial pol β, comparing it to the rat nuclear enzyme (TableI). The K m values determined were similar for both enzymes, on the order of ∼1 μm, and are in reasonable agreement with theK m of 0.5 μm reported for the rat enzyme on a similar substrate (27Prasad R. Beard W.A. Strauss P.R. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15263-15270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, thek cat values differed markedly between the two enzymes. Although the rat nuclear enzyme was able to liberate 4.12 unsaturated dRP residues per minute, a value consistent with that previously observed (27Prasad R. Beard W.A. Strauss P.R. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15263-15270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), the C. fasciculata mitochondrial protein was ∼40-fold less active. The catalytic efficiency,k cat/K m, is about 20-fold higher for the rat nuclear enzyme.Table IKinetics of dRP lyase activity for the pol βs from the C. fasciculata mitochondrion and the rat nucleusEnzymeK mk catk cat/K m−1μmmin −1μm−1min −1C. fasciculatamitochondrial pol β0.450.110.24Rat nuclear pol β0.924.124.485 pmol of the C. fasciculata enzyme and 0.25 pmol of the rat enzyme were used. Substrate concentrations ranged from ≈0.1 to 2 μm. Open table in a new tab 5 pmol of the C. fasciculata enzyme and 0.25 pmol of the rat enzyme were used. Substrate concentrations ranged from ≈0.1 to 2 μm. As described above, the dRP lyase reaction has multiple steps (Fig. 3). We took advantage of the fact that both Schiff base-containing intermediates and the unsaturated dRP product can be stabilized by reduction with NaBH4.E·DNA and E·dRP intermediates can be separated by SDS-PAGE, and free unsaturated dRP can be resolved by PEI-cellulose thin layer chromatography. To identify the step in this pathway in which the mitochondrial pol β was deficient, we incubated the dRP lyase substrate with enzyme for various times prior to the addition of NaBH4. We used excess protein so that only a single turnover could occur. With the rat nuclear pol β, we found that the initial attack was very fast, because even at time zero when protein and NaBH4 were added simultaneously, a significant amount of E·DNA complex had already formed (Fig. 6 A,upper panel). By 0.5 min, most of the radioactivity had proceeded quickly through the E·dRP intermediate and appeared as the free unsaturated dRP derivative (Fig. 6 A,lower panel). The pattern for the C. fasciculatamitochondrial pol β differed significantly. First, the initial attack was slower, as indicated by the lower levels of E·DNA at early time points. The most striking difference, however, was the accumulation of the E·dRP complex, suggesting that the hydrolysis step to release dRP from the enzyme was impaired (Fig.6 B, upper panel). This conclusion was supported by the observation that the level of free unsaturated dRP rose much more slowly for the mitochondrial enzyme than for the rat nuclear enzyme (Fig. 6 B, lower panel). The native mitochondrial enzyme exhibited a similar pattern (data not shown). Fig.6 C shows a control demonstrating that the dRP lyase reaction can occur at basal levels in the absence of a specific enzyme activity. Basic pH or the inclusion of polyamines or basic proteins such as histones facilitate this spontaneous non-enzymatic cleavage (28Bailly V. Verly W.G. Biochem. J. 1988; 253: 553-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The pol β from C. fasciculata is the first example of an enzyme of this type found in the mitochondrion. Its localization to the antipodal sites during kDNA replication suggests a role in this process. This class of polymerases is known to fill small gaps efficiently (29Singhal R.K. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15906-15911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), making them suitable to fill gaps between the numerous Okazaki fragments that are generated during minicircle replication. However, the well-characterized role of nuclear pol βs in DNA repair led us to speculate that the mitochondrial enzyme may also play a similar role. There has been growing evidence that mitochondrial DNA in mammalian cells is repaired via base excision repair, and this pathway is thought to utilize DNA polymerase γ (pol γ) for both dRP lyase and polymerase activity (22Longley M.J. Prasad R. Srivastava D.K. Wilson S.H. Copeland W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12244-12248Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). For recent reviews on mitochondrial DNA repair see Refs. 30Bogenhagen D.F. Pinz K.G. Perez-Jannotti R.M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 68: 257-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Dianov G.L. Souza-Pinto N. Nyaga S.G. Thybo T. Stevnsner T. Bohr V.A. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol.

It is not unreasonable that a pathway for base excision repair exists in the mitochondrion of C. fasciculata given the large amount of DNA, the importance of its integrity to parasite survival, and its proximity to the free-radical-generating electron transport chain. To investigate this possibility, we assayed the mitochondrial pol β for dRP lyase activity. As expected from the sequence alignments showing that residues important for dRP lyase activity are conserved, mitochondrial pol β does indeed have dRP lyase activity. However, the mitochondrial protein is much less active in this capacity than its rat nuclear homolog, and most of this deficiency is in the conversion of the E·dRP intermediate to free enzyme and the unsaturated dRP product. Previous studies based on structural data have suggested both glutamate 26 and glutamate 71 (Fig. 2, boxes) are potential candidates for supplying a carboxyl group to facilitate this hydrolysis reaction (33Feng J.A. Crasto C.J. Matsumoto Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9605-9611Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Notably, neither of these residues is conserved in the C. fasciculata enzyme. It is interesting that a similar pattern ofE·dRP accumulation is observed for pol γ fromXenopus laevis (34Pinz K.G. Bogenhagen D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12509-12514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), although a homologous dRP lyase domain has not been reported for that enzyme. What do these data reveal about the involvement of the C. fasciculata pol β in mitochondrial DNA repair? It has been reported for the mammalian enzyme that nucleotide addition occurs prior to dRP removal, thus making the dRP lyase reaction the rate-limiting step of the entire base excision repair pathway (35Srivastava D.K. Berg B.J. Prasad R. Molina J.T. Beard W.A. Tomkinson A.E. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21203-21209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). This means that once cleavage of the dRP occurs (Step 2 of Fig. 3), the DNA can continue through the repair process, regardless of the state of the polymerase. Based on the purification data (13Torri A.F. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4786-4792Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we believe this protein to be abundant, and perhaps the sheer number of pol β molecules compensates for its poor catalytic abilities, both as a dRP lyase and as a polymerase. An overabundance of protein molecules in the cell would then be sufficient to meet the repair needs of kDNA. In addition, if protein is rapidly turned over, the problem of the accumulation of pol β as an E·dRP complex is avoided. There are other possibilities as well. Perhaps the mitochondrial pol β has an accessory factor that facilitates the regeneration of the protein following dRP cleavage. Or maybe the cell can alleviate the need for pol β to have an efficient dRP lyase activity. This could include having other mitochondrial proteins with dRP lyase activity or funneling the base excision repair pathway through the alternative branch that involves AP lyase enzymes. These enzymes, through a similar β-elimination reaction, cleave 3′ to the AP site leaving an unsaturated dRP derivative on the 3′-end of the DNA that can be removed by an AP endonuclease (36Piersen C.E. McCullough A.K. Lloyd R.S. Mutat. Res. 2000; 459: 43-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Alternatively, perhaps the mitochondrial pol β has evolved to specifically recognize a substrate we have yet to identify. Studies to further elucidate the role of this enzyme in the mitochondrion of C. fasciculata and other kinetoplastid organisms are ongoing. We thank Viiu Klein and Terry Westhead for countless hours of technical support, and Drs. Michele Klingbeil, James Morris, Theresa Shapiro, and Andrew Gudzelak, Jr. for critical reading of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2089743710,"We have shown previously that centrosomes and other microtubule-organizing centers (MTOCs) attach to the apical intermediate filament (IF) network in CACO-2 cells. In this cell line, intermediate filaments do not disorganize during mitosis. Therefore, we speculated that the trigger of the G2-M boundary may also detach MTOCs from their IF anchor. If that was the case, at least one of the proteins involved in the attachment must be phosphorylated by p34cdc2 (cdk1). Using confocal microscopy and standard biochemical analysis, we found that p34cdc2-mediated phosphorylation indeed released MTOCs from IFs in permeabilized cells. In isolated, immunoprecipitated multiprotein complexes containing both γ-tubulin and cytokeratin 19, p34cdc2phosphorylated only one protein, and phosphorylation released cytokeratin 19 from the complexes. We conclude that this as yet unidentified protein is a part of the molecular mechanism that attaches MTOCs to IFs in interphase."
