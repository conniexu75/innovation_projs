https://openalex.org/W2158662692,"Necroptosis is a cellular mechanism of necrotic cell death induced by apoptotic stimuli in the form of death domain receptor engagement by their respective ligands under conditions where apoptotic execution is prevented. Although it occurs under regulated conditions, necroptotic cell death is characterized by the same morphological features as unregulated necrotic death. Here we report that necrostatin-1, a previously identified small-molecule inhibitor of necroptosis, is a selective allosteric inhibitor of the death domain receptor–associated adaptor kinase RIP1 in vitro. We show that RIP1 is the primary cellular target responsible for the antinecroptosis activity of necrostatin-1. In addition, we show that two other necrostatins, necrostatin-3 and necrostatin-5, also target the RIP1 kinase step in the necroptosis pathway, but through mechanisms distinct from that of necrostatin-1. Overall, our data establish necrostatins as the first-in-class inhibitors of RIP1 kinase, the key upstream kinase involved in the activation of necroptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2063391304,"Genetic alterations in the kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients are associated with sensitivity to treatment with small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Although first-generation reversible, ATP-competitive inhibitors showed encouraging clinical responses in lung adenocarcinoma tumors harboring such EGFR mutations, almost all patients developed resistance to these inhibitors over time. Such resistance to first-generation EGFR inhibitors was frequently linked to an acquired T790M point mutation in the kinase domain of EGFR, or upregulation of signaling pathways downstream of HER3. Overcoming these mechanisms of resistance, as well as primary resistance to reversible EGFR inhibitors driven by a subset of EGFR mutations, will be necessary for development of an effective targeted therapy regimen. Here, we show that BIBW2992, an anilino-quinazoline designed to irreversibly bind EGFR and HER2, potently suppresses the kinase activity of wild-type and activated EGFR and HER2 mutants, including erlotinib-resistant isoforms. Consistent with this activity, BIBW2992 suppresses transformation in isogenic cell-based assays, inhibits survival of cancer cell lines and induces tumor regression in xenograft and transgenic lung cancer models, with superior activity over erlotinib. These findings encourage further testing of BIBW2992 in lung cancer patients harboring EGFR or HER2 oncogenes."

https://openalex.org/W2100200896,"In acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL), the promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) protein is fused to the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RAR). This disease can be treated effectively with arsenic, which induces PML modification by small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMO) and proteasomal degradation. Here we demonstrate that the RING-domain-containing ubiquitin E3 ligase, RNF4 (also known as SNURF), targets poly-SUMO-modified proteins for degradation mediated by ubiquitin. RNF4 depletion or proteasome inhibition led to accumulation of mixed, polyubiquitinated, poly-SUMO chains. PML protein accumulated in RNF4-depleted cells and was ubiquitinated by RNF4 in a SUMO-dependent fashion in vitro. In the absence of RNF4, arsenic failed to induce degradation of PML and SUMO-modified PML accumulated in the nucleus. These results demonstrate that poly-SUMO chains can act as discrete signals from mono-SUMOylation, in this case targeting a poly-SUMOylated substrate for ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis."
https://openalex.org/W2016597274,"Comparative genomics of nucleosome positions provides a powerful means for understanding how the organization of chromatin and the transcription machinery co-evolve. Here we produce a high-resolution reference map of H2A.Z and bulk nucleosome locations across the genome of the fly Drosophila melanogaster and compare it to that from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Like Saccharomyces, Drosophila nucleosomes are organized around active transcription start sites in a canonical -1, nucleosome-free region, +1 arrangement. However, Drosophila does not incorporate H2A.Z into the -1 nucleosome and does not bury its transcriptional start site in the +1 nucleosome. At thousands of genes, RNA polymerase II engages the +1 nucleosome and pauses. How the transcription initiation machinery contends with the +1 nucleosome seems to be fundamentally different across major eukaryotic lines."
https://openalex.org/W2061795728,"Lipid droplets are found in nearly all eukaryotic cells and contain neutral lipids such as triacylglycerols and sterol esters. There is rapidly growing interest in the cell biology of lipid storage, largely due to the central role that these processes play in obesity and related metabolic diseases. Guo et al. have performed a genome-wide RNA interference screen in Drosophila cells and identify genes involved in lipid droplet formation and utilization. About 1.5% of all genes are involved in these processes. Eukaryotic cells store neutral lipids in cytoplasmic lipid droplets. Processes regulating the formation of these organelles are at present unknown. A genome-wide RNAi screen in Drosophila cells identifies genes involved in lipid droplet formation and utilization, finding that 1% of all genes are involved in these processes. This study will lead to an understanding of human diseases involving excessive lipid storage. Eukaryotic cells store neutral lipids in cytoplasmic lipid droplets1,2 enclosed in a monolayer of phospholipids and associated proteins3,4. These dynamic organelles5 serve as the principal reservoirs for storing cellular energy and for the building blocks for membrane lipids. Excessive lipid accumulation in cells is a central feature of obesity, diabetes and atherosclerosis, yet remarkably little is known about lipid-droplet cell biology. Here we show, by means of a genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) screen in Drosophila S2 cells that about 1.5% of all genes function in lipid-droplet formation and regulation. The phenotypes of the gene knockdowns sorted into five distinct phenotypic classes. Genes encoding enzymes of phospholipid biosynthesis proved to be determinants of lipid-droplet size and number, suggesting that the phospholipid composition of the monolayer profoundly affects droplet morphology and lipid utilization. A subset of the Arf1–COPI vesicular transport proteins also regulated droplet morphology and lipid utilization, thereby identifying a previously unrecognized function for this machinery. These phenotypes are conserved in mammalian cells, suggesting that insights from these studies are likely to be central to our understanding of human diseases involving excessive lipid storage."

https://openalex.org/W2048448975,"Iron deficiency is usually attributed to chronic blood loss or inadequate dietary intake. Here, we show that iron deficiency anemia refractory to oral iron therapy can be caused by germline mutations in TMPRSS6, which encodes a type II transmembrane serine protease produced by the liver that regulates the expression of the systemic iron regulatory hormone hepcidin. These findings demonstrate that TMPRSS6 is essential for normal systemic iron homeostasis in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2028308990,"In plants, copper is an essential micronutrient required for photosynthesis. Two of the most abundant copper proteins, plastocyanin and copper/zinc superoxide dismutase, are found in chloroplasts. Whereas plastocyanin is essential for photo-autotrophic growth, copper/zinc superoxide dismutase is dispensable and in plastids can be replaced by an iron superoxide dismutase when copper is limiting. The down-regulation of copper/zinc superoxide dismutase expression in response to low copper involves a microRNA, miR398. Interestingly, in Arabidopsis and other plants, three additional microRNA families, miR397, miR408, and miR857, are predicted to target the transcripts for the copper protein plantacyanin and members of the laccase copper protein family. We confirmed the predicted targets of miR397, miR408, and miR857 experimentally by cleavage site analysis. To study the spatial expression pattern of these microRNAs and the effect of copper on their expression, we analyzed Arabidopsis grown hydroponically on different copper regimes. On low amounts of copper the plants accumulated miR397, miR408, and miR857. The microRNA expression pattern was negatively correlated with the accumulation of transcripts for plantacyanin and laccases. Furthermore, the expression of other laccases that are not predicted targets for known microRNAs was similarly regulated in response to copper. For some of these laccases, the regulation was disrupted in a microRNA maturation mutant (hen1-1), suggesting the presence of other copper-regulated microRNAs. Thus, in Arabidopsis, microRNA-mediated down-regulation is a general mechanism to regulate nonessential copper proteins. We propose that this mechanism allows plants to save copper for the most essential functions during limited copper supply. In plants, copper is an essential micronutrient required for photosynthesis.

In plants copper plays critical roles in photosynthetic and respiratory electron transport, oxidative stress protection, cell wall metabolism, and ethylene perception (1Marschner, H. (1995) Mineral Nutrition of Higher Plants, pp. 333-347, Academic Press, Inc., LondonGoogle Scholar). Copper deficiency results in changes in root, stem and leaf architecture and visible chlorosis (1Marschner, H. (1995) Mineral Nutrition of Higher Plants, pp. 333-347, Academic Press, Inc., LondonGoogle Scholar). At the cellular level copper deficiency results in reduced photosynthetic electron transport (2Henriques F.S. Plant Physiol. 1989; 135: 453-458Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 3Shikanai T.

On the other hand, when copper is present in excess, plants develop toxicity symptoms such as an inhibition of root elongation (6Murphy A. Taiz L. Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 29-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Toxicity symptoms in the shoot include decreased photosystem II function and an inhibition of chlorophyll synthesis that is accompanied by a reduction of the thylakoid membrane surface and generation of excess reactive oxygen species in the chloroplast (7Pätsikkä E.

Arabidopsis mutants with insertions in both PC genes are seedling-lethal (10Weigel M. Varotto C. Pesaresi P. Finazzi G. Rappaport F. Salamini F. Leister D. J. Biol.

A class of abundant intracellular copper proteins is formed by the Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzymes, which function to catalyze the dismutation of superoxide radicals ( O2.¯) into H2O2 (11Asada K. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 50: 601-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (3162) Google Scholar). Three genes encode for Cu,Zn-SOD in the Arabidopsis genome (12Kliebenstein D.J. Monde R.A. Last R.L. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 637-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar); CSD1 is active in the cytosol, CSD2 is active in the chloroplast stroma, and CSD3 is active in the peroxisome. CSD1 and CSD2 are the major isoforms in green tissue.Much of the machinery involved in cellular copper uptake and intracellular distribution in plant cells has now been described. Particularly, the delivery of copper to the ethylene receptors and the photosynthetic machinery is well characterized (for reviews, see Refs. 13Pilon M. Abdel-Ghany S.E. Cohu C.M. Gogolin K.A. Ye H. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2006; 9: 256-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar and 14Puig S. Andres-Colas N. Garcia-Molina A. Penarrubia L. Plant Cell Environ. 2007; 30: 271-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). copper enters plant cells via the COPT transporters and is subsequently delivered to plastocyanin in the thylakoid lumen and to CSD2 in the stroma by a machinery that includes two chloroplast-localized copper-transporting P-type ATPases and a metallo-chaperone for Cu,Zn-SOD (for review, see Ref. 13Pilon M. Abdel-Ghany S.E. Cohu C.M. Gogolin K.A. Ye H. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2006; 9: 256-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In chloroplasts, another SOD called FSD1 utilizes iron as the cofactor. copper availability was found to regulate the expression of CCS, CSD1, CSD2, and FSD1 in Arabidopsis and other dicot plant species (15Abdel-Ghany S.E. Burkhead J.L. Gogolin K.A. Andres-Colas N. Bodecker J.R. Puig S. Penarrubia L. Pilon M. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 2307-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 16Abdel-Ghany S.E. Muller-Moule P.

Plant. 2007; 129: 747-755Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). When copper levels are sufficient, the Cu,Zn-SOD proteins are expressed, and FSD1 expression is shut-off. Conversely, when copper is limiting, CSD1 and CSD2 expression is down-regulated, and FSD1 becomes abundant. The down-regulation of CSD1 and CSD2 under copper limitation involves a microRNA, miR398, which is itself up-regulated under copper limitation (18Yamasaki H. Abdel-Ghany S.E. Cohu C.M. Kobayashi Y.

Chem. 2007; 282: 16369-16378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar).MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are ∼21-nucleotide noncoding RNAs that function primarily as negative regulators at the post-transcriptional level in plants and animals. In flowering plants, miRNAs are major regulators of developmental processes such as flower, leaf, and root development (for review, see Ref. 19Jones-Rhoades M.W. Bartel D.P. Bartel B. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2006; 57: 19-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (2047) Google Scholar). miRNAs have also been predicted or confirmed to regulate other processes such as responses to stress, pathogen invasion, and mineral nutrient homeostasis (19Jones-Rhoades M.W. Bartel D.P. Bartel B. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2006; 57: 19-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (2047) Google Scholar).Among the secreted proteins that utilize copper are the laccases and plantacyanin. Laccases are four copper atom-containing glycoproteins which catalyze the oxidation of a suitable substrate molecule with the production of water and oligomers. The laccases comprise a multi-gene family in plants (20LaFayette P.R. Eriksson K.E. Dean J.F. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 40: 23-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 21Sato Y. Bao W.L. Sederoff R. Whetten R. J. Plant Res. 2001; 114: 147-155Crossref Google Scholar). In Arabidopsis, there are 17 annotated laccase genes that can be divided into four sub-groups (22McCaig B.C. Meagher R.B. Dean J.F.D. Planta. 2005; 221: 619-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In each subgroup some of the genes are expressed in a constitutive fashion, and others are expressed in specific tissues at a particular stage of development (22McCaig B.C. Meagher R.B. Dean J.F.D. Planta. 2005; 221: 619-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Proposed functions of laccases in plants include roles in lignin synthesis (23Bao W. O'Malley D. Whetten R. Sederoff R.

Biochem. 2004; 42: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), response to stress (28Liang M. Davis E. Gardner D. Cai X. Wu Y. Planta. 2006; 224: 1185-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and the maintenance of cell wall structure and integrity (25Ranocha P. Chabannes M. Chamayou S. Danoun S. Jauneau A. Boudet A.-M. Goffner D. Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 145-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Plantacyanin is a plant-specific protein that contains a single copper ion and belongs to the phytocyanin family of secreted blue copper proteins (29Ryden L.G. Hunt L.T. J. Mol. Evol. 1993; 36: 41-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In Arabidopsis, plantacyanin is encoded by a single gene that is reported to be expressed in roots and in the inflorescence, particularly in the flowers where it may have a role in directing pollen tube growth in the style (30Dong J. Kim S.T. Lord E.M. Plant Physiol. 2005; 138: 778-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Three additional miRNAs are predicted to target laccase and plantacyanin transcripts. The microRNAs miR408, miR397, and miR857 were identified by computational analysis and predicted to target members of the laccase gene family and plantacyanin mRNAs in Arabidopsis, rice, and poplar (31Bonnet E.

PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e219Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar).With respect to copper nutrition, we have proposed that the miR398-mediated down-regulation of Cu,Zn-SODs may allow plants to save copper for essential functions such as plastocyanin, which is active in green photosynthetic tissue. However, in relation to copper the expression of miR398 and its targets was only studied at the seedling level (18Yamasaki H. Abdel-Ghany S.E. Cohu C.M. Kobayashi Y. Shikanai T. Pilon M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 16369-16378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). It had not been shown yet that miR398-mediated down-regulation of Cu,Zn-SODs on low copper occurs before PC function becomes limiting to photosynthesis. Now three additional miRNAs, miR408, miR397, and miR857, are predicted to target the transcripts for other copper enzymes. In analogy to the regulation of Cu,Zn-SOD proteins by copper via miR398, the existence of additional microRNAs that target copper proteins suggests that a connection may exist between the abundance of these miRNAs and copper availability, which in turn may regulate the expression of the target genes. Although the presence of at least four copper-related miRNA families suggests a general mechanism for the regulation of dispensable copper proteins, a direct link has not been established between the new miRNAs and their targets; neither has a link between these miRNAs and copper nutrition been shown. Furthermore, unlike CSD1 and CSD2, plantacyanin and many of the laccases, which are predicted to be targeted by the above-mentioned miRNAs, have expression patterns that do not overlap with the major copper protein plastocyanin and, thus, would not compete for copper in the same cell. Nevertheless, reduced copper use outside of photosynthetically active tissue could help save copper for use in photosynthetic electron transport elsewhere in the plant.To investigate the possible roles of the various copper-related miRNAs in copper homeostasis in both seedlings and mature plants, we grew Arabidopsis hydroponically on three copper regimes that we termed copper-deficient, copper-limited, and copper-replete. Copper-deficient plants have insufficient copper to supply plastocyanin and as a consequence are affected in their photosynthetic electron transport capacity; these plants do not express Cu,Zn-SODs. Although copper-limited plants have reduced plastocyanin and very little Cu,Zn-SOD expression, copper supply is sufficient to allow near maximal electron transport. copper-replete plants have full plastocyanin and Cu,Zn-SOD function. Our data suggest a strong link between copper status and miR397, miR398, miR408, and miR857 throughout the plant as evidenced by an analysis of the expression patterns of these miRNAs and their target transcripts as well as target mRNA cleavage site analysis. Additional regulation through as yet undiscovered miRNAs may exist in response to copper. Plastocyanin transcript levels were not down-regulated by copper deficiency or limitation. We propose that copper-related miRNAs have systemic roles in plants to regulate the abundance of a number of copper enzymes in response to fluctuations in copper availability.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlant Materials and Growth Conditions—Arabidopsis seeds (Col ecotype) were surface-sterilized and germinated on agar plates containing one-quarter strength MS medium (37Murashige T. Skoog F. Physiol. Plant. 1962; 15: 473-497Crossref Scopus (53151) Google Scholar) supplemented with 1% sucrose. This medium contains 0.025 μm CuSO4, a concentration that does not limit germination. Seedlings were grown in 12-h/12-h light/dark cycles at a light intensity of 120 μmol of photons m-2 s-1 and 23 °C. After 10 days, seedlings were moved to a hydroponic setup on 1/10× strength Hoagland's solution (38Hoagland, D. R., and Arnon, D. I. (1938) The Water Culture Method for Growing Plants without Soil, pp. 347-553, College of Agriculture Experimental Station Circular, University of CaliforniaGoogle Scholar) and allowed to grow for 5 weeks as described (17Cohu C.M. Pilon M. Physiol. Plant. 2007; 129: 747-755Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). For growth under copper deficiency, copper was omitted from the medium (-Cu), whereas 5 nm (copper limitation) and 50 nm (copper replete) CuSO4 were added as copper treatments. All equipment used for the hydroponic setup were washed with 25 mm EDTA and rinsed repeatedly with double-distilled H2O to minimize copper contamination. Chemicals used for Hoagland's solution were of A.C.S. grade and were purchased from Fisher. The growth medium was replaced every 7 days and maintained daily with double-distilled H2Otocompensate for evaporation. After 2 weeks on hydroponics, shoots were harvested for expression analyses in the seedling stage. After 3 more weeks, tissues (root, leaf, stem, and flower) were collected separately for RNA and immunoblot analyses.For analysis of the miRNA processing mutant, hen1-1, the wild type and mutant seeds were sown on synthetic MS agar plates containing 1% sucrose. For growth under copper deficiency, no copper was added to the medium (-Cu), whereas 5 μm CuSO4 was added as copper treatment (copper replete). Plants were grown for 3 weeks in 12 h/12 h light/dark cycles at a light intensity of 120 μmol of photons m-2 s-1 and 23 °C. All the plant materials were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C until use.Chlorophyll Fluorescence and Metal Ion Measurements— Fluorescence analysis was done on plants that were grown on hydroponics for 5 weeks. Chlorophyll fluorescence was measured using a Hansatech Fluorometer FMS2 (Hansatech Instrument, Norfolk, UK) on overnight dark-adapted rosette leaves as described (17Cohu C.M. Pilon M. Physiol. Plant. 2007; 129: 747-755Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The parameters Fv/Fm, ΦPSII, electron transport rate, and non-photochemical quenching were calculated as described (39Maxwell K. Johnson G.N. J. Exp. Bot. 2000; 51: 659-668Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For elemental composition analysis, the leaves, stems, roots, and flowers of Arabidopsis plants grown for 5 weeks in hydroponic culture were harvested separately, washed twice with 1 mm EDTA and once with double-distilled H2O, and dried at 65 °C for 48 h. 100 mg of dried sample was digested in 1 ml of nitric acid and heated for 2 h at 60 °C and then for 6 h at 130 °C. Digests were diluted to 10 ml with double-distilled H2O and analyzed using inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry as described (17Cohu C.M. Pilon M. Physiol. Plant. 2007; 129: 747-755Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar).Protein Extraction and Immunoblotting—Total protein was extracted as described (16Abdel-Ghany S.E. Muller-Moule P. Niyogi K.K. Pilon M. Shikanai T. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 1233-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), and the protein concentration was determined according to Bradford (40Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213510) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. 20 μg of total protein was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane by electroblotting. Antibodies for immunoblot detection of PC (16Abdel-Ghany S.E. Muller-Moule P. Niyogi K.K. Pilon M. Shikanai T.

One microgram of DNase-treated total RNA was then reverse-transcribed into cDNA using Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions and used in the amplification reaction directly after dilution. The amplification reactions were carried out with the LightCycler 480 SYBR Green 1 master mix on a LightCycler 480 (Roche Applied Science). PCR vessels (10 μl) contained the vendor's master mix, 0.5 μm concentrations of each primer, and cDNA corresponding to 20 ng input RNA in the reverse transcriptase reaction. The PCR conditions were 95 °C for 7.5 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s, annealing temp (calculated Tm, -5 °C) for 10 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. The fluorescence was measured at each cycle at 72 °C. Melting curves were performed after the PCR reaction to assess the presence of a unique final product, and the products were also analyzed by gel electrophoresis. The cycle number at which fluorescence signals crossed the threshold (CT) value was determined. To compare data from different PCR runs or cDNA samples, CT values for all tested genes were normalized to the CT value of the ACT2 gene, a constitutively expressed “housekeeping” gene. The average CT value for ACT2 was 17.55 (±1.39) for all cDNA samples used in the experiments. Gene expression was normalized to ACT2 expression by subtracting the CT value of ACT2 from the CT value of the tested gene (ΔCT). Expression levels are given as 40-ΔCT, where 40 is arbitrary and was chosen because PCR runs were stopped at cycle 40. This presentation of expression levels corresponds to a logarithmic scale. -Fold differences in expression were obtained from the expression (1 + E)ΔΔCT, where E is the PCR efficiency, and ΔΔCT represents the ΔCT-I (condition one; for instance, no copper) minus ΔCT-II (condition two; for instance, copper-replete). The efficiency (E) of real-time PCR was determined for each primer set using a dilution series of the same cDNA and ranged between 1 and 0.97. The results presented are the averages of technical triplicates for two independent experiments. Primers used for amplification of miR397, miR857, and ACT2 are shown in Table 1. For laccases with predicted target sites for miRNAs, forward and reverse gene-specific primers were designed to flank the predicted cleavage sites (Table 1).

https://openalex.org/W2042504292,"Cancer progression is an abnormal form of tissue repair characterized by chronic inflammation. IκB kinase-β (IKKβ) required for nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation plays a critical role in this process. Using EOC cells isolated from malignant ovarian cancer ascites and solid tumors, we identified IKKβ as a major factor promoting a functional TLR–MyD88–NF-κB pathway that confers to EOC cell the capacity to constitutively secrete proinflammatory/protumor cytokines and therefore promoting tumor progression and chemoresistance. Furthermore, we describe for the first time the identification of the microRNA hsa-miR-199a as a regulator of IKKβ expression. Our study describes the property of ovarian cancer cells to enhance the inflammatory microenvironment as a result of the expression of an active IKKβ pathway. Identification of these markers in patients' tumor samples may facilitate the adequate selection of treatment and open new venues for the development of effective therapy for chemoresistant ovarian cancers."

Expression of human CLEC9A is highly restricted in peripheral blood, being detected only on BDCA3(+) dendritic cells and on a small subset of CD14(+)CD16(-) monocytes. CLEC9A is expressed at the cell surface as a glycosylated dimer and can mediate endocytosis, but not phagocytosis. CLEC9A possesses a cytoplasmic immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation-like motif that can recruit Syk kinase, and we demonstrate, using receptor chimeras, that this receptor can induce proinflammatory cytokine production. These data indicate that CLEC9A functions as an activation receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2078615559,"There is increasing evidence showing that the stromal cells surrounding cancer epithelial cells, rather than being passive bystanders, might have a role in modifying tumor outgrowth. The molecular basis of this aspect of carcinoma etiology is controversial. Some studies have reported a high frequency of genetic aberrations in carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), whereas other studies have reported very low or zero mutation rates. Resolution of this contentious area is of critical importance in terms of understanding both the basic biology of cancer as well as the potential clinical implications of CAF somatic alterations. We undertook genome-wide copy number and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis of CAFs derived from breast and ovarian carcinomas using a 500K SNP array platform. Our data show conclusively that LOH and copy number alterations are extremely rare in CAFs and cannot be the basis of the carcinoma-promoting phenotypes of breast and ovarian CAFs."
https://openalex.org/W2142565339,"B cells, αβ T cells and γδ T cells are conserved lymphocyte subtypes encoding their antigen receptors from somatically rearranged genes. αβ T cells undergo positive selection in the thymus by engagement of their T cell receptors (TCRs) with self-peptides presented by major histocompatibility complex molecules1.

By mapping and genetic complementation using a strain showing loss of Vγ5+Vδ1+ cells due to a failure of thymic selection, we show that this defect is caused by mutation in Skint1, a newly identified gene expressed in thymus and skin that encodes a protein with immunoglobulin-like and transmembrane domains. Skint1 is the prototypic member of a rapidly evolving family of at least 11 genes in mouse, with greatest similarity to the butyrophilin genes. These findings define a new family of proteins mediating key epithelial-immune interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2029327556,"The retinoblastoma pathway is often inactivated in human tumors resulting in deregulated E2F activity that can induce both proliferation and cell death. Although the role of E2F in apoptosis is well characterized, little is known regarding its putative participation in other cell death pathways. We show here that activation of E2F1 upregulates the expression of four autophagy genes-microtubule-associated protein-1 light chain-3 (LC3), autophagy-related gene-1 (ATG1), ATG5 and damage-regulated autophagy modulator (DRAM). E2F1-mediated induction of LC3, ATG1 and DRAM is direct and indeed, endogenous E2F1 can be found bound to regions encompassing the promoters of these genes. Regulation of ATG5 by E2F1 is indirect. Importantly, we demonstrate that E2F1 activation enhances autophagy and conversely, reducing endogenous E2F1 expression inhibits DNA damage-induced autophagy. These studies identify E2F1 as a transcriptional regulator of autophagy, and for the first time establish a role for E2F1 in DNA damage-induced autophagy."
https://openalex.org/W2144569256,"Cellular bio-energetic metabolism and mitochondria are recognized as potential targets for anticancer agents, due to the numerous relevant peculiarities cancer cells exhibit. Jasmonates are anticancer agents that interact directly with mitochondria. The aim of this study was to identify mitochondrial molecular targets of jasmonates. We report that jasmonates bind to hexokinase and detach it from the mitochondria and its mitochondrial anchor—the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), as judged by hexokinase immunochemical and activity determinations, surface plasmon resonance analysis and planar lipid bilayer VDAC-activity analysis. Furthermore, the susceptibility of cancer cells and mitochondria to jasmonates is dependent on the expression of hexokinase, evaluated using hexokinase-overexpressing transfectants and its mitochondrial association. Many types of cancer cells exhibit overexpression of the key glycolytic enzyme, hexokinase, and its excessive binding to mitochondria. These characteristics are considered to play a pivotal role in cancer cell growth rate and survival. Thus, our findings provide an explanation for the selective effects of jasmonates on cancer cells. Most importantly, this is the first demonstration of a cytotoxic mechanism based on direct interaction between an anticancer agent and hexokinase. The proposed mechanism can serve to guide development of a new selective approach for cancer therapy."

https://openalex.org/W2049202209,"Aberrant activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is a hallmark of colon cancer. We show that the Wnt antagonist DICKKOPF-4 (DKK-4) gene is repressed by 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) in human colon cancer cells. This effect correlated with the inhibition of the DKK-4 promoter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that 1,25(OH)2D3 induces early and transient binding of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) and the SMRT corepressor to the region adjacent to the transcription start site of DKK-4. Additionally, we demonstrate that the DKK-4 gene is a new downstream target of TCF/β-catenin. Remarkably, expression of DKK-4 messenger RNA (mRNA) was not detected in a series of 29 human normal (N) colon biopsies but expression was upregulated in all the matched tumour (T) tissues. An inverse correlation existed between the expression of DKK-4 and VDR RNA in the Ts. Ectopic DKK-4 expression increased the migration and invasion properties of colon cancer cells and conditioned media (CM) from DKK-4-expressing cells enhanced the capacity to migrate and form capillary-like tubules of human primary microvascular endothelial cells. In conclusion, DKK-4 is upregulated in colon cancer and is associated with the acquisition of malignant properties by neoplastic cells. DKK-4 downregulation is a novel effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 that may contribute to its anticancer action."
https://openalex.org/W2040833589,"Lethal 3 malignant brain tumor 1 (L3MBTL1), a homolog of the Drosophila polycomb tumor suppressor l(3)mbt, contains three tandem MBT repeats (3xMBT) that are critical for transcriptional repression. We recently reported that the 3xMBT repeats interact with mono- and dimethylated lysines in the amino termini of histones H4 and H1b to promote methylation-dependent chromatin compaction. Using a series of histone peptides, we now show that the recognition of mono- and dimethylated lysines in histones H3, H4 and H1.4 (but not their trimethylated or unmodified counterparts) by 3xMBT occurs in the context of a basic environment, requiring a conserved aspartic acid (D355) in the second MBT repeat. Despite the broad range of in vitro binding, the chromatin association of L3MBTL1 mirrors the progressive accumulation of H4K20 monomethylation during the cell cycle. Furthermore, transcriptional repression by L3MBTL1 is enhanced by the H4K20 monomethyltransferase PR-SET7 (to which it binds) but not SUV420H1 (an H4K20 trimethylase) or G9a (an H3K9 dimethylase) and knockdown of PR-SET7 decreases H4K20me1 levels and the chromatin association of L3MBTL1. Our studies identify the importance of H4K20 monomethylation and of PR-SET7 for L3MBTL1 function."
https://openalex.org/W2009869135,"The forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription factor FOXO1 functions as a tumor suppressor by regulating expression of genes involved in apoptosis, cell cycle arrest and oxidative detoxification. Here, we demonstrate that cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) specifically phosphorylates FOXO1 at serine 249 (S249) in vitro and in vivo. Coimmunoprecipitation assays demonstrate that both endogenous CDK1 and ectopically expressed CDK1 form a protein complex with FOXO1 in prostate cancer (PCa) cells. In vitro protein binding assays reveal that CDK1 interacts directly with FOXO1. Accordingly, overexpression of CDK1 inhibits the transcriptional activity of FOXO1 in PCa cells through S249 phosphorylation on FOXO1. Consistent with the roles of FOXO3a and FOXO4 (two other members of the FOXO family) in cell cycle regulation, forced expression of FOXO1 causes a delay in the transition from G2 to M phase. This effect is blocked completely by overexpression of CDK1 and cyclin B1. Ectopic expression of constitutively active CDK1 also inhibits FOXO1-induced apoptosis in PCa cells. Moreover, we demonstrate that the inhibitory effect of FOXO1 on Ras oncogene-induced colony formation in fibroblasts is diminished by overexpression of CDK1. Given that CDK1 and cyclin B1 are often overexpressed in human cancers including PCa, our findings suggest that aberrant activation of CDK1 may contribute to tumorigenesis by promoting cell proliferation and survival via phosphorylation and inhibition of FOXO1."

https://openalex.org/W2068034831,"Platyhelminth parasites are a major health problem in developing countries. In contrast to their mammalian hosts, platyhelminth thiol-disulfide redox homeostasis relies on linked thioredoxin-glutathione systems, which are fully dependent on thioredoxin-glutathione reductase (TGR), a promising drug target. TGR is a homodimeric enzyme comprising a glutaredoxin domain and thioredoxin reductase (TR) domains with a C-terminal redox center containing selenocysteine (Sec). In this study, we demonstrate the existence of functional linked thioredoxin-glutathione systems in the cytosolic and mitochondrial compartments of Echinococcus granulosus, the platyhelminth responsible for hydatid disease. The glutathione reductase (GR) activity of TGR exhibited hysteretic behavior regulated by the [GSSG]/[GSH] ratio. This behavior was associated with glutathionylation by GSSG and abolished by deglutathionylation. The K(m) and k(cat) values for mitochondrial and cytosolic thioredoxins (9.5 microm and 131 s(-1), 34 microm and 197 s(-1), respectively) were higher than those reported for mammalian TRs. Analysis of TGR mutants revealed that the glutaredoxin domain is required for the GR activity but did not affect the TR activity. In contrast, both GR and TR activities were dependent on the Sec-containing redox center. The activity loss caused by the Sec-to-Cys mutation could be partially compensated by a Cys-to-Sec mutation of the neighboring residue, indicating that Sec can support catalysis at this alternative position. Consistent with the essential role of TGR in redox control, 2.5 microm auranofin, a known TGR inhibitor, killed larval worms in vitro. These studies establish the selenium- and glutathione-dependent regulation of cytosolic and mitochondrial redox homeostasis through a single TGR enzyme in platyhelminths."
https://openalex.org/W1997393527,"The Forkhead box transcription factor FoxM1 is expressed in proliferating cells. When it was depleted in mice and cell lines, cell cycle defects and chromosomal instability resulted. Premature senescence was observed in embryonic fibroblasts derived from FoxM1 knock-out mice, but the underlying cause has remained unclear. To investigate whether FoxM1 can protect cells against stress-induced premature senescence, we established NIH3T3 lines with doxycycline-inducible overexpression of FoxM1c. Treatment of these lines with sublethal doses (20 and 100 microm) of H(2)O(2) induced senescence with senescence-associated beta-galactosidase expression and elevated levels of p53 and p21. Induction of FoxM1c expression markedly suppressed senescence and expression of p53 and p21. Consistent with down-regulation of the p19(Arf)-p53 pathway, p19(Arf) levels decreased while expression of the Polycomb group protein Bmi-1 was induced. That Bmi-1 is a downstream target of FoxM1c was further supported by the dose-dependent induction of Bmi-1 by FoxM1c at both the protein and mRNA levels, and FoxM1 and Bmi-1 reached maximal levels in cells at the G(2)/M phase. Depletion of FoxM1 by RNA interference decreased Bmi-1 expression. Using Bmi-1 promoter reporters with wild-type and mutated c-Myc binding sites and short hairpin RNAs targeting c-Myc, we further demonstrated that FoxM1c activated Bmi-1 expression via c-Myc, which was recently reported to be regulated by FoxM1c. Our results reveal a functional link between FoxM1c, c-Myc, and Bmi-1, which are major regulators of tumorigenesis. This link has important implications for the regulation of cell proliferation and senescence by FoxM1 and Bmi-1."
https://openalex.org/W2026226511,"AAK-2 is one of two alpha isoforms of the AMP-activated protein kinase in Caenorhabditis elegans and is involved in life span maintenance, stress responses, and germ cell cycle arrest upon dauer entry. We found that AAK-2 was phosphorylated at threonine 243 in response to paraquat treatment and that this phosphorylation depends on PAR-4, the C. elegans LKB1 homologue. Both aak-2 mutation and par-4 knockdown increased the sensitivity of C. elegans worms to paraquat, and the double deficiency did not further increase sensitivity, indicating that aak-2 and par-4 act in a linear pathway. Both mutations also slowed body bending during locomotion and failed to reduce head oscillation in response to anterior touch. Consistent with this abnormal motility and behavioral response, expression of the AAK-2::green fluorescent protein fusion protein was observed in the ventral cord, some neurons, body wall muscle, pharynx, vulva, somatic gonad, and excretory cell. Our study suggests that AMPK can influence the behavior of C. elegans worms in addition to its well known function in metabolic control."

Genet. 2002; 11: 3039-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). ApoCIII inhibits lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and receptor-mediated endocytosis of lipoprotein particles by competing for space at the surface of the lipoproteins and by interfering with their binding to endothelial proteoglycans and to specific lipoprotein receptors (2Narayanaswami V. Ryan R.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1483: 15-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 4Jong M.C. Hofker M.H. Havekes L.M. Arterioscl. Thromb. Vasc.

Biol. 1995; 15: 963-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Overexpression of apoCIII in transgenic mice leads to severely increased plasma triglyceride levels due to accumulation of very low density lipoprotein-like lipoprotein remnants with increased apo-CIII and decreased apoE content compared with controls (7Ito Y. Azrolan N. Oconnell A. Walsh A. Breslow J.L. Science. 1990; 249: 790-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Overexpression of apoCIII in apoE-/- mice leads to similar results, demonstrating that the effects are not only connected to displacement of apoE (8Ebara T. Ramakrishnan R. Steiner G. Shachter N.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2672-2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Knock-out of the apoCIII gene in mice leads to reduced levels of lipoproteins in blood (9Maeda N. Li H. Lee D. Oliver P. Quarfordt S.H. Osada J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23610-23616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In human subjects, increased levels of apoCIII are often correlated to increased levels of triglycerides in blood and in turn to insulin resistance, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes type 2 (4Jong M.C. Hofker M.H. Havekes L.M. Arterioscl. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 472-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Recent data suggest that apoCIII and apoAV are important opposing modulators of plasma triglyceride metabolism (5Talmud P.J. Hawe E. Martin S. Olivier M. Miller G.J. Rubin E.M. Pennacchio L.A. Humphries S.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 3039-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 10van Dijk K.W. Rensen P.C.N. Voshol P.J. Havekes L.M. Curr. Opin. Lipodol. 2004; 15: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). ApoCIII was found to directly affect insulin secretion by interfering with voltage-gated calcium channels in pancreatic β-cells (11Juntti-Berggren L. Refai E. Appelskog I. Andersson M. Imreh G. Dekki N. Uhles S. Yu L. Griffiths W.J. Zaitsev S. Leibiger I. Yang S.N. Olivecrona G. Jornvall H. Berggren P.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10090-10094Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Interestingly, mutations in the apoCIII promoter are connected with longevity (12Kaiser J. Science. 2004; 306: 1284Google Scholar). Lipid interaction is required for solubility as well as correct folding and function of most apolipoproteins (1Segrest J.P. Jones M.K. Deloof H.

In addition, cumulative evidence suggests that apolipoproteins are dynamic and span multiple conformations required for their functions (13Gursky O. Curr. Opin. Lipodol. 2005; 16: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Structural studies of apolipoproteins have therefore been as challenging as studies of membrane proteins, and high resolution structure information has remained relatively scarce. To date, apolipoprotein structures are available of the 22-kDa N-terminal domain of human/mouse apoE (14Wilson C. Wardell M.R. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Agard D.A.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11681-11691Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), all in the lipid-free state. In the lipid-bound state, only recently the first low resolution (10 Å) x-ray model has been reported of an intact apolipoprotein, apoE (22Peters-Libeu C.A. Newhouse Y. Hatters D.M. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1073-1079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Also reported is the three-dimensional structure and dynamics of apoCII bound to micelles derived from NMR relaxation data (23Zdunek J. Martinez G.V. Schleucher J. Lycksell P.O. Yin Y. Nilsson S. Shen Y. Olivecrona G. Wijmenga S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1872-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In addition, NMR has provided information on helix boundaries and local structure of lipid-bound intact apoCII (24MacRaild C.A. Howlett G.J. Gooley P.R. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 8084-8093Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), apoCI (25Rozek A. Sparrow J.T. Weisgraber K.H. Cushley R.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14475-14484Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and apoAI (26Okon M. Frank P.G. Marcel Y.L. Cushley R.J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 517: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). No high resolution structural and dynamics information has yet been derived on intact apoCIII. Human apoCIII consists of 79 amino acid residues. Structure predictions have indicated that two amphipathic helices are likely to be formed (1Segrest J.P. Jones M.K. Deloof H. Brouillette C.G.

Vandekerckhove J. Rosseneu M. Labeur C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9201-9212Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). There is no consensus about which regions are most important for attachment to lipids (27Liu H.Q. Talmud P.J. Lins L. Brasseur R. Olivecrona G. Peelman F. Vandekerckhove J. Rosseneu M. Labeur C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9201-9212Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 28Sparrow J.T. Pownall H.J. Hsu F.J. Blumenthal L.D. Culwell A.R. Gotto A.M.

Protein Eng. 2002; 15: 513-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The structurally related apoCII is known to interact with LPL and activate this enzyme via the C-terminal helix (30Shen Y. Lookene A. Nilsson S. Olivecrona G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4334-4342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), most likely in a dynamic fashion (23Zdunek J. Martinez G.V. Schleucher J. Lycksell P.O. Yin Y. Nilsson S. Shen Y. Olivecrona G. Wijmenga S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1872-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). ApoCIII inhibits LPL, but direct binding has not been shown (27Liu H.Q. Talmud P.J. Lins L. Brasseur R. Olivecrona G. Peelman F. Vandekerckhove J. Rosseneu M. Labeur C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9201-9212Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). ApoCIII also inhibits binding of apoE/B-containing lipoproteins to members of the LDL receptor family (2Narayanaswami V. Ryan R.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1483: 15-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 6Clavey V. Lestavel-Delattre S. Copin C. Bard J.M. Fruchart J.C. Arterioscl. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 963-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Finally, apoCIII binds, like apoE, apoD, and apoAI, to the HDL receptor SR-BI (31Zannis V.I. Chroni A. Krieger M. J. Mol. Med. 2006; 84: 276-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 32Xu S. Laccotripe M. Huang X. Rigotti A. Zannis V.I. Krieger M. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1289-1298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we present the three-dimensional structure and dynamics of intact human apoCIII in complex with SDS micelles, derived from a combination of NMR data: NOEs, 13C chemical shift-derived backbone dihedral angles, 3JHNHα couplings, NMR multiple-field 15N-spin backbone relaxation, and 15N/1H residual dipolar couplings (RDCs). Thanks to the RDC data, the first detailed view is obtained of the structure and dynamics of an intact apoliprotein in a lipid-bound state. This structure provides a template for exploration of the molecular mechanisms by which human apoCIII inhibits LPL and receptor binding. ApoCIII was expressed from a pET23b vector (a kind gift from Dr. Philippa Talmud (London, UK)), containing the full-length cDNA for human apoCIII, including the sequence for a His6 tag at the 3′-end (C-terminal His6 tag) preceded by two additional residues (Leu and Glu) (27Liu H.Q. Talmud P.J. Lins L. Brasseur R. Olivecrona G. Peelman F. Vandekerckhove J. Rosseneu M. Labeur C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9201-9212Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). A detailed protocol is presented in the supplemental material. The 13C/15N-labeled M13 coat protein was expressed and purified as described elsewhere (33Papavoine C.H.M. Christiaans B.E.C. Folmer R.H.A. Konings R.N.H. Hilbers C.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 401-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 34Papavoine C.H.M. Remerowski M.L. Horstink L.M. Konings R.N.H. Hilbers C.W. vandeVen F.J.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4015-4026Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The NMR sample of apoCIII in complex with SDS micelles was prepared from lyophilized 15N/13C-labeled apoCIII as described (23Zdunek J. Martinez G.V. Schleucher J. Lycksell P.O. Yin Y. Nilsson S. Shen Y. Olivecrona G. Wijmenga S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1872-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), leading to the final ApoCIII-NMR sample: ∼0.5 mm apoCIII, 180 mm SDS-d25, 8% D2O, and 10 mm deuterated sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0). In this final sample, the apo-CIII/micelle ratio is 1:6, assuming 60 SDS molecules/micelle (23Zdunek J. Martinez G.V. Schleucher J. Lycksell P.O. Yin Y. Nilsson S. Shen Y. Olivecrona G. Wijmenga S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1872-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). For RDC measurements, we prepared a similar second sample (apoCIII-RDC), except for a slightly higher buffer concentration (50 mm). While keeping the apoCIII/SDS micelle ratio as low as possible (here 1:6) to prevent protein-protein interactions (23Zdunek J. Martinez G.V. Schleucher J. Lycksell P.O. Yin Y. Nilsson S. Shen Y. Olivecrona G. Wijmenga S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1872-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), relatively low SDS and buffer concentrations were used. This considerably reduced the overall tumbling time of the apoCIII-micelle complex and improved three-dimensional NMR spectra, as will be described elsewhere in more detail. All NMR experiments were carried out at 42.7 °C, determined to be optimal via 15N/1H HSQC experiments. Prior to each experiment, the temperature was calibrated using tetramethylammonium. The NMR sample for the 13C/15N-labeled M13 coat protein (gVIIIp) in complex with SDS micelles (M13-NMR) was similar to that for apoCIII. For RDC measurements, a similar second sample (M13-RDC) was prepared. The NMR experiments for assignment and derivation of experimental restraints are summarized in Table S4. Briefly, for backbone resonance assignments, 600-MHz CBCA(CO)NH, HNCACB, and HNCO were recorded (35Sattler M. Schleucher J. Griesinger C. Prog. Nucl. Magn. Reson. Spectrosc. 1999; 34: 93-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1399) Google Scholar) and a 600-MHz three-dimensional HNHA for 3JHαHN couplings (36Vuister G.W. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 7772-7777Crossref Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). To confirm the backbone assignments and derive NOE distance restraints, 800-MHz 1H/15N NOESY-HSQC and 1H/15N HSQC-NOESY-HSQC were recorded (35Sattler M. Schleucher J. Griesinger C. Prog. Nucl. Magn. Reson. Spectrosc. 1999; 34: 93-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1399) Google Scholar). All NMR spectra were processed using NMRPipe (37Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11638) Google Scholar) and analyzed using XEASY (38Bartels C. Xia T.H. Billeter M. Guntert P. Wuthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (1607) Google Scholar) and NMRDraw (37Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11638) Google Scholar). Further details on restraint extraction are described under “Structure Calculations.” RDCs were measured in stretched polyacrylamide gels via a procedure modified from previously published ones (39Chou J.J. Gaemers S. Howder B. Louis J.M. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 21: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) (i.e. practical procedures were developed to control alignment magnitude and buffer conditions (pH and salt)). Briefly, 4% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide/bisacrylamide, 37.5:1) was polymerized in the presence of apoCIII-SDS micelles (apoCIII-RDC sample) in a cylindrical Teflon tube with a 6-mm internal diameter. To induce alignment, the 6-mm diameter gel was then squeezed into an open-ended NMR tube (internal diameter 4.2 mm) using a laboratory-made funnel device (which will be described elsewhere). The HN-N RDCs were measured from five sets of 1H/15N 800-MHz IPAP-HSQCs (40Ottiger M. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1998; 131: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). In addition, a decoupled 1H/15N HSQC was recorded, so that RDCs could be calculated as twice the difference of the peak positions of the (sharp) “down-component” in the IPAP and decoupled HSQC. The average r.m.s. deviation of the RDCs was 0.8 Hz. The RDC data on the M13 coat protein were measured in a similar fashion. 15N T1 and T1ρ and 15N(1H) NOE measurements (23Zdunek J. Martinez G.V. Schleucher J. Lycksell P.O. Yin Y. Nilsson S. Shen Y. Olivecrona G. Wijmenga S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1872-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 41Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (2018) Google Scholar) on the apoCIII-NMR sample were carried out at 600 and 800 MHz. Two and three sets of 15N T1 experiments were recorded with relaxation delays of 16, 256, 384, 512, 640, 768, 896, 1024, and 1280 ms at 600 and 800 MHz, respectively. Two sets of 15N T1ρ experiments (spin-lock field 3 kHz) were recorded using delays of 16, 32, 48, 64, 96, and 128 ms at 600 and 800 MHz each. The 15N (1H) NOE was acquired thrice at 600 MHz and twice at 800 MHz. The data points were recorded in an interleaved manner to minimize effects of spectrometer drift and temperature fluctuations. All of the data were processed with NMRPipe (37Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11638) Google Scholar). 15N T1 and T1ρ were calculated by nonlinear fittings of the delay-dependent peak intensities to an exponential decay function. 15NT1ρ values were corrected for off-resonance effects. 15N(1H) NOE values were calculated as the intensity ratio of cross-peaks from pairs of spectra acquired with and without 1H presaturation. The data obtained from the duplicate or triplicate measurements were averaged, and errors were derived. The T1, T1ρ, and NOE data were analyzed via PINATA (23Zdunek J. Martinez G.V. Schleucher J.

NMR. 2003; 27: 291-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To derive a structure model of apoCIII in complex with SDS micelles, we employed a protocol that is essentially as described previously for the apoCII-SDS micelle complex (23Zdunek J. Martinez G.V. Schleucher J. Lycksell P.O. Yin Y. Nilsson S. Shen Y. Olivecrona G. Wijmenga S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1872-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The main difference is that the restraints that define the relative helix orientations are now derived from RDCs, whereas previously they originated from the variation in the helix-specific correlation times as derived from 15N relaxation data. The protocol consists of two main parts. In this section (i), an overview is presented of the protocol, whereas in sections ii and iii, elements of the protocol are described in detail. Part I. Structure Calculations Performed Entirely within X-PLOR-NIH 2.1 with Its Standard Simulated Annealing Protocol in Torsion Angle Space and NMR Restraints Corresponding to NOE, CDIH, JCOUP, and SANI (RDC) Terms in the Available Potential—Starting from an α-helical conformation (section iia) a set of 100 apoCIII structures were calculated using X-PLOR-NIH 2.1 with its standard SA protocol in torsion angle space (section iie) (44Schwieters C.D. Kuszewski J.J. Tjandra N. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 2003; 160: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar). In these calculations, restraints obtained from the following NMR experiments/data were used: NOEs (section iib), 13C chemical shift-derived (via TALOS) backbone dihedral angles (CDIH) (section iic), 3J. Zdunek, M. Lindgren, M. Karlsson, P. O. Westlund, and S. Wijmenga, manuscript in preparation. JHNHα couplings (JCOUP) (section iic), and 15N/1H RDCs (SANI) (section iid). The resulting set of structures shows good structure characteristics (Table S2a). The structures show well defined secondary structures of the helices (data not shown). However, the relative orientations of the helices are not fully defined by these restraints. This is due in part to the local nature of the “classical” NMR restraints and the lack of long range NOEs (as evident from separate calculations without RDCs). That inclusion of the RDCs neither fully defines the relative helix orientations is due to the intrinsic symmetry relations in the geometric equations of the RDCs. Hence, to fully define the three-dimensional structure of the apoCIII-micelle complex, the micelle has to be taken into account. This is done in Part II. To proceed, the 10 lowest energy structures were submitted to part II. Part II. Structure Derivation of the Protein-Micelle Complex—To define the relative helix orientation and to position the protein on the surface of the micelle, additional “global” restraints were employed. They were (a) HN-N RDCs and (b) two further additional restraints, namely (b1) the hydrophobic moments of the amphipathic helices should point toward the center of the micelle, and (b2) the structure should fit to the geometrical size of the micelle. All calculations in Part II, except in Step 1 (see below), were carried out in X-PLOR and Protein Constructor, a program written by a few of us, 3J. Zdunek, M. Lindgren, M. Karlsson, P. O. Westlund, and S. Wijmenga, manuscript in preparation. which employs calls on XPLOR and aims to smooth structure calculations based on “global” constraints (for a more detailed description, see section iiia). In Step 1, a Monte Carlo simulation is performed to fit for each helix the calculated to the experimental RDCs using the dipolar wave formalism (45Mesleh M.F. Lee S. Veglia G. Thiriot D.S. Marassi F.M. Opella S.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 8928-8935Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 46Mascioni A. Veglia G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 12520-12526Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These Monte Carlo fittings were performed via Matlab scripts using the dipolar wave formulations by Mesleh et al. (45Mesleh M.F. Lee S. Veglia G. Thiriot D.S. Marassi F.M. Opella S.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 8928-8935Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and/or by Mascioni et al. (46Mascioni A. Veglia G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 12520-12526Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and via a procedure incorporated into Protein Constructor, which employs the dipolar wave formulation by Mascioni et al. (46Mascioni A. Veglia G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 12520-12526Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This resulted in a set of angles (three per helix rigid body: θ, φ, and ρ) that defines the helix orientations in three-dimensional space, albeit with some unavoidable degeneracy intrinsic to derivation of angles from RDCs. This degeneracy is resolved by the geometric requirements resulting from “global” restraints mentioned above. In Step 2, the 10 “best” helix structures of Part I were then supplied to Protein Constructor. Each of the structures was logically divided into fragments detected by the program as helices or joints. Based on the results from Part I, the apoCIII molecule was segmented into six helical regions in the following order: helix 1 (residues 8–18), helix 2 (residues 20–29), helix 3 (residues 33–43), helix 4 (residues 46–54), helix 5 (residues 55–65) and helix 6 (residues 74–79). The rest of the molecule was treated as joints and enumerated in appropriate consecutive order. The average length of each joint between helices was estimated based on the 100 structures calculated in Part I of the structure determination. Those values together with the three angles (φ, θ, and ρ) orienting helices axes in three-dimensional space were submitted to the Protein Constructor as parameters. Having this information and being equipped with the algorithms able to calculate helical axes and hydrophobic moments from the structure, the Protein Constructor appropriately positioned each helix one after another according to the supplied information on the surface of the micelle. The orientations of the short junctions between helices were determined in the first approximation as averages of the orientations of the adjacent helices. Putting the length of the hydrophobic moments equal to the size of the radius of the micelle and requiring the hydrophobic moments to point to the same place in space, we ensured that all helices stayed on the surface of the micelle. In Step 3, the unavoidable disruptions at helical junctions were then “healed” in Protein Constructor via a loop closure algorithm in 200 iterations (47Canutescu A. Dunbrack Jr. R.L. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 963-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). In Step 4, the resulting structures were then minimized as rigid bodies in Protein Constructor via a call to XPLOR-NIH using positional constraints on Cα atoms (i.e. the Cα atoms of residues 8, 24, 29, 38, 50, 60, and 76 were constrained in space, corresponding to about one Cα atom per helix rigid body). In Step 5, the five lowest energy structures were then refined by XPLOR-NIH via a gentle Cartesian space SA protocol (500 to 25 K, step 25 K) followed by 3000 steps of Powell energy minimization employing all NMR restraints. Each of the five structures generated 10 new final structures. During this refinement, the seven Cα backbone atoms of Step 4 (in the middle or near the middle of each helix) were kept in space to ensure the helices stayed on the micelle. Ad"
https://openalex.org/W2072062484,"Sulfatases are a major group of enzymes involved in many critical physiological processes as reflected by their broad distribution in all three domains of life. This class of hydrolases is unique in requiring an essential post-translational modification of a critical active-site cysteine or serine residue to C(alpha)-formylglycine. This modification is catalyzed by at least three nonhomologous enzymatic systems in bacteria. Each enzymatic system is currently considered to be dedicated to the modification of either cysteine or serine residues encoded in the sulfatase-active site and has been accordingly categorized as Cys-type and Ser-type sulfatase-maturating enzymes. We report here the first detailed characterization of two bacterial anaerobic sulfatase-maturating enzymes (anSMEs) that are physiologically responsible for either Cys-type or Ser-type sulfatase maturation. The activity of both enzymes was investigated in vivo and in vitro using synthetic substrates and the successful purification of both enzymes facilitated the first biochemical and spectroscopic characterization of this class of enzyme. We demonstrate that reconstituted anSMEs are radical S-adenosyl-l-methionine enzymes containing a redox active [4Fe-4S](2+,+) cluster that initiates the radical reaction by binding and reductively cleaving S-adenosyl-l-methionine to yield 5 '-deoxyadenosine and methionine. Surprisingly, our results show that anSMEs are dual substrate enzymes able to oxidize both cysteine and serine residues to C(alpha)-formylglycine. Taken together, the results support a radical modification mechanism that is initiated by hydrogen abstraction from a serine or cysteine residue located in an appropriate target sequence."
https://openalex.org/W2017377008,"The molecular causes for resistance of melanoma to apoptosis are currently only partly understood. In the present study, we examined gene transfer and expression of the proapoptotic BH3-only protein Noxa as an alternative approach to chemotherapy and investigated the molecular mechanisms regulating Noxa-induced apoptosis. Noxa gene transfer caused dysregulation of both mitochondria and, as shown for the first time, also the endoplasmic reticulum, resulting in the accumulation of reactive oxygen species. Interestingly, expression of Noxa not only triggered the classical mitochondrial caspase cascade, but also resulted in the activation of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase1 and its downstream effectors c-Jun N-terminal kinase and p38. The activation of these kinases was abolished by antioxidants. Moreover, inhibition of the kinases by RNA interference or pharmacological inhibitors significantly attenuated Noxa-induced apoptosis. Thus, our data provide evidence for the involvement of multiple pathways in Noxa-induced apoptosis that are triggered at mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum, and suggest Noxa gene transfer as a complementary approach to chemotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2033418448,"The c-Myb oncoprotein is a DNA-binding transcription factor with a key role in early stages of hematopoiesis. To expand our knowledge of partners cooperating with c-Myb, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screening with full-length c-Myb as bait. Here, we report FLICE-associated huge protein (FLASH)/CASP8AP2 as a novel Myb-interacting protein. We show that FLASH interacts with the DNA-binding domain of c-Myb and enhances c-Myb-dependent reporter activity and expression of endogenous c-Myb target genes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that FLASH and c-Myb both associate with the MYC promoter region as well as with the intronic enhancer of the c-Myb target gene ADA. Furthermore, siRNA knock-down of FLASH or c-Myb both result in a reduction of MYC and ADA expression. The co-activator effect is mediated through the C-terminal part of FLASH, which binds c-Myb. The FLASH-induced enhancement is comparable with the increase seen with the c-Myb co-activator p300. We find FLASH localized in discrete nuclear speckles in several cell lines, co-localized with c-Myb in active RNA polymerase II foci. These results imply a novel molecular mechanism of regulation of c-Myb activity. We propose that c-Myb cooperates with FLASH in foci associated with active RNA polymerase II, leading to enhancement of Myb-dependent gene activation."

In this study, we further investigated the mechanism by which cyclin G1 transcriptionally activates cyclin B1. Deletion or point mutations within the cyclin B1 promoter region revealed that the c-Myc binding site (E-box) is necessary for cyclin G1-mediated transcriptional activation of cyclin B1 to occur. In addition, the kinase activity of Cdk5 was increased by cyclin G1 overexpression, and Cdk5 directly phosphorylated c-Myc on Ser-62. Furthermore, cyclin G1 mediated increased radiosensitivity, and radiation-induced M phase arrest was attenuated when RNA interference of Cdk5 was treated. Taken together, the results of this study indicate that Cdk5 activation in cells that overexpress cyclin G1 leads to c-Myc phosphorylation on Ser-62, which is responsible for cyclin G1-mediated transcriptional activation of cyclin B1.

Cell cycle arrest in response to DNA damage occurs primarily at the G1/S and G2/M boundaries (1Hartwell L.H. Kastan M.B. Science. 1994; 266: 1821-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (2316) Google Scholar, 2Kastan M.B. Lim D.S. Kim S.T. Yang D. Acta Oncol. 2001; 40: 686-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), with G1/S arrest blocking entry of damaged DNA into the S phase and G2/M arrest prohibiting entry of damaged DNA into mitosis. Therefore, both the G1/S and G2/M checkpoints are important for maintaining genomic stability, as well as for maintaining the fidelity of transmission of intact genomes to cellular progeny (3Hartwell L. Cell. 1992; 71: 543-546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar, 4Paulovich A.G. Toczyski D.P. Hartwell L.H. Cell. 1997; 88: 315-321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). The eventual target of the G2/M entry checkpoint is the mitotic kinase Cdc2-cyclin B1, which governs most of the processes involved in mitotic initiation and progression (5Hunt N. Adams S. Coxhead N. Sayer H. Murray C. Silverstone T. Soc. Psychiatry Psychiatr. Epidemiol. 1993; 28: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Cyclin protein levels oscillate during the cell cycle, with B-type cyclins appearing during the S phase and accumulating in G2 and mitosis before disappearing during the transition from metaphase to anaphase. Synthesis of cyclin B1 during the cell cycle is regulated primarily at the transcriptional level (6Brandeis M. Hunt T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5280-5289Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) by a cell cycle-dependent element (CDE) 3The abbreviations used are: CDE, cell cycle-dependent element; CHR, cell cycle gene homology region; GSK, glycogen synthase kinase; Cdk5, cyclin-dependent kinase 5; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; siRNA, small interfering RNA; Si-, transfected with siRNA; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; Gy, gray (unit of radiation); GST, glutathione S-transferase. and cell cycle gene homology region (CHR) tandem element (7Lange-zu Dohna C. Brandeis M. Berr F. Mossner J. Engeland K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 484: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Transcription of Cdc25C, cyclin A, and the Cdc2 gene causes CDE/CHR elements to repress transcription during the early phases of the cell cycle; however, relief from this repression later in S and G2 leads to their expression (8Zwicker J. Lucibello F.C. Wolfraim L.A. Gross C. Truss M. Engeland K. Muller R. The EMBO journal. 1995; 14: 4514-4522Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Furthermore, although degradation by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis leads to a large drop in cyclin B1 protein levels (6Brandeis M. Hunt T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5280-5289Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 9Hunt T. Luca F.C. Ruderman J.V. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 707-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 10Townsley F.M. Ruderman J.V. Yeast. 1998; 14: 747-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), it has been reported that an E-box is involved in the transcriptional regulation of cyclin B1 (11Cogswell J.P. Godlevski M.M. Bonham M. Bisi J. Babiss L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2782-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 12Farina A. Gaetano C. Crescenzi M. Puccini F. Manni I. Sacchi A. Piaggio G. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1287-1296PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, a recent report has provided evidence that the cyclin B1 promoter is also subject to activation by c-Myc, as demonstrated by the binding of c-Myc to the activating E-box (CACGTG) of cyclin B1 (13Menssen A. Hermeking H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6274-6279Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 14Yin X.Y. Grove L. Datta N.S. Katula K. Long M.W. Prochownik E.V. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6487-6493PubMed Google Scholar). However, the exact upstream mechanisms that cause c-Myc to bind to the E-box of the cyclin B1 promoter region during cell cycle regulation have not yet been defined. An enhancer E-box can be defined as a transcriptional homograph, which is a short DNA element with the ability to dispense different transcriptional outputs depending upon the features of the sequence and cellular environment. For example, by recruiting the proto-oncogene c-Myc, an E-box can drive cells to become growth factor-independent, to speed through G1 of the cell cycle, to avoid differentiation, or to undergo apoptotic death (15Fuhrmann G. Rosenberger G. Grusch M. Klein N. Hofmann J. Krupitza G. Mutat. Res. 1999; 437: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 16Littlewood T.D. Evan G.I. Adv. Dent. Res. 1990; 4: 69-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The perplexing diversity of E-box-dependent processes has fueled an intense search for trans-acting factors regulating a given E-box. Predictably, such efforts have resulted in an ever expanding list of transcription factors that can recognize E-box binding factors, including c-Myc, Arnt, Max, and MyoD (17Antonsson C.

Journal of West China University of Medical Sciences. 1996; 27: 5-9Google Scholar). Temporal regulation of c-Myc protein accumulation is essential for normal cell proliferation to occur, and deregulation of the c-myc oncogene is often observed in human cancer (20Nesbit C.E. Tersak J.M. Prochownik E.V. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3004-3016Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). In addition, c-Myc protein overexpression can immortalize cells, reduce their growth factor requirements, promote cell cycle progression, and inhibit differentiation (21Claassen G.F. Hann S.R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2925-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 22Henriksson M. Luscher B. Adv. Cancer Res. 1996; 68: 109-182Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Obaya A.J. Mateyak M.K. Sedivy J.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2934-2941Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). c-Myc protein is stabilized after activation of several signal transduction pathways that inhibit glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), such as the Raf-MEK-ERK kinase cascade or the PI3K (phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase)-Akt pathway. The ERK and GSK-3β kinases phosphorylate two sites, Ser-62 and Thr-58, respectively, which are near the amino terminus of c-Myc and are highly conserved in all mammalian c-Myc isofoms (24Henriksson M. Bakardjiev A. Klein G. Luscher B. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3199-3209PubMed Google Scholar, 25Lutterbach B. Hann S.R. Mol. Cell.

These phosphorylation sites exert opposing control of c-Myc degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (27Sears R. Leone G. DeGregori J. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 169-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). In response to a growth-stimulatory signal, transcription of the c-myc gene is increased and newly synthesized c-Myc protein is phosphorylated on the Ser-62 residue, which results in its stabilization. Phosphorylation at Ser-62 is also required for the subsequent phosphorylation of c-Myc at Thr-58 by GSK-3β, which is associated with c-Myc degradation (24Henriksson M. Bakardjiev A. Klein G. Luscher B. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3199-3209PubMed Google Scholar, 26Pulverer B.J. Fisher C. Vousden K. Littlewood T. Evan G. Woodgett J.R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 59-70PubMed Google Scholar, 27Sears R.

Biochem. 1999; 72: 483-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Thr-58 phosphorylation contributes to degradation of c-Myc through the ubiquitin pathway, whereas mutation of Thr-58 to alanine results in a stable and more oncogenic c-Myc protein (24Henriksson M. Bakardjiev A. Klein G. Luscher B. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3199-3209PubMed Google Scholar, 26Pulverer B.J. Fisher C. Vousden K. Littlewood T. Evan G. Woodgett J.R.

Cyclin G1, one of the target genes of p53, has been studied to determine its role as it relates to p53 activities (29Okamoto K. Beach D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4816-4822Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 30Zauberman A. Lupo A. Oren M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2361-2366PubMed Google Scholar). However, recent observations suggest that cyclin G1 might be involved in various activities that are not associated with p53. Cyclin G1 is associated with cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) and non-Cdk-serine/threonine kinase, which is also known as cyclin G-associated kinase (GAK) (31Kanaoka Y. Kimura S.H. Okazaki I. Ikeda M. Nojima H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 32Kimura S.H. Tsuruga H. Yabuta N. Endo Y. Nojima H. Genomics. 1997; 44: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In addition, because of its overexpression in human tumor cells, it has been suggested that cyclin G1 acts as an oncogenic protein (33Baek W.K. Kim D. Jung N. Yi Y.W. Kim J.M. Cha S.D. Bae I. Cho C.H. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 2003; 188: 634-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 34Reimer C.L. Borras A.M. Kurdistani S.K. Garreau J.R. Chung M. Aaronson S.A. Lee S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11022-11029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Conversely, cyclin G1 is also involved in G2/M phase arrest in response to DNA damage (35Kimura S.H. Nojima H. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 869-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and in the facilitation of tumor necrosis factor-induced apoptosis (36Okamoto K. Prives C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4606-4615Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), indicating that it has a tumor-suppressing function. Despite these findings, there is limited understanding of the biochemical function of cyclin G1 when it is complexed with associated partners or of the molecular function of its associated partners. In a previous study, we found that cyclin G1 was overexpressed in lung cancer tissues but that it regulated cyclin B1 at the transcriptional level, independently of p53. In addition, in that study, cyclin G1 was found to overcome radiation-induced G2 arrest, resulting in increased radiation sensitivity (37Seo H.R. Lee D.H. Lee H.J. Baek M. Bae S. Soh J.W. Lee S.J. Kim J. Lee Y.S. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 1475-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In this study, we further describe the mechanisms of cyclin G1-mediated transcriptional activation of cylcin B1. Cyclin G1 interacted with Cdk5, which in turn induced kinase activation of Cdk5. Active Cdk5 then phosphorylated c-Myc on Ser-62, and the phosphorylated c-Myc then bound directly to the E-box promoter region of cyclin B1, resulting in increased cyclin B1 promoter activity. Reagents—Nocodazole was purchased from Sigma. Monoclonal antibody for cyclin G1, cyclin B1, c-Myc, p53, ERK, p-ERK, and Cdk5 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). phospho-c-Myc (Ser-62) and phospho-c-Myc (Thr-58) were purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). Phospho-GSK-3β and GSK-3β were purchased from Upstate (Charlottesville, VA). c-Myc and Cdk5 recombinant protein were purchased from Abnova (Taiwan). Plasmids and Constructs—For overexpression of cyclin G1, human cyclin G1 cDNA was cloned into murine leukemia retrovirus MFG vector (37Seo H.R. Lee D.H. Lee H.J. Baek M. Bae S. Soh J.W. Lee S.J.

The cyclin B1 promoter-firefly luciferase reporter constructs, hB1-Luci, hB1-CDE mut-Luci, and hB1-CHR-Luci-mut, were kindly provided by Kurt Engeland (Universitat Leipzig, Germany). hB1-NY-F2, hB1-NY-F3, and hB1-E-box-Luci mutants were created by PCR-based targeted mutagenesis on the basis of hB1-Luci. Full-length c-Myc was then cloned into the pcDNA4-V5 plasmid after which internal deletion mutants were constructed in c-Myc-containing pcDNA3-HA vector in the c-Myc coding sequence using deletion primers. This was followed by restriction and ligation steps. Cell Culture—NCI-H460 or NCI-H1299 human non-small cell carcinoma and HCT116 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with heat-inactivated 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and antibiotics at 37 °C in a humidified incubator under 5% CO2. Irradiation—Cells were plated in 60-mm dishes and then incubated at 37 °C under humidified conditions with 5% CO2 until 70–80% confluent. Cells were then exposed to γ-rays from a 137Cs γ-ray source (Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd.) at a dose rate of 3.81 Gy/min. Flow Cytometric Analysis—Cells were cultured, harvested at the indicated times, and then stained with propidium iodide according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cells were then analyzed using a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Cell Transfection—Predesigned siRNA for human cyclin G1, cyclin B1, cdk5, c-Myc, and negative control siRNA was purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX). Cells were then transfected with these siRNAs for 48 h using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). All cells were transiently transfected using Lipofectamine or Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen). Cell Cycle Analysis—For cell cycle analysis, cells were fixed in 80% ethanol at 4 °C for at least 18 h. Next, the fixed cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline-EDTA and then resuspended in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. After the addition of 10 μl each of propidium iodide (5 mg/ml) and RNase (10 mg/ml), the samples were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C and then analyzed using a FACScan flow cytometer. In Vitro Kinase Assay—Cell lysates were incubated with cyclin G1 and Cdk5 antibody, after which the immunocomplexes were collected on protein A-Sepharose beads and resuspended in kinase assay mixture containing [γ-32P]ATP and c-Myc as substrates. GST-cyclin G1 and GST-Cdk5 were also mixed in the kinase assay mixture. Proteins were then separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, after which the bands were detected by autoradiography. Reporter Assay—Cells were transfected with 200 ng of β-galactosidase expression vector pSV110 and 200 ng of reporter gene, along with mutant vectors of NY-F2, NY-F3, CDE, CHR, and E-box and wild-type cyclin B1 expression vector. The cells were harvested 48 h later, and luciferase activity was then assayed, with the results normalized to the β-galactosidase expression (Promega, Madison, WI). All results represent the mean of three independent experiments. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—The E-box oligonucleotide was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase, and 5 μg of nuclear extract was then incubated with the [γ-32P]E-box oligonucleotide at room temperature for 30 min. The c-Myc-E-box complex was then sequentially separated from the unbound E-box on a 4% Tris borate-EDTA gel. The gel was then dried, and an autoradiogram was taken. Protein Synthesis—For protein synthesis assays, MFG control and cyclin G1-overexpressing NCI-H460 cells were resuspended in Met/Cys-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 2% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and then preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C for recovery. The cells were then labeled with [35S]methionine (5 Ci, 3000 Ci/mmol) for the times indicated in Fig. 3, after which 500 μl of cell suspension were lysed in SDS sample buffer and then incubated with c-Myc antibody. Next, the immunocomplexes were collected on protein A-Sepharose beads and then separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, after which the bands were detected by autoradiography. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—NCI-H460 cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde in serum-free RPMI at room temperature for 5–10 min. The chromation was then sheared by sonication on ice, which yielded chromatin fragments of 100–600 bp. Chromatin complexes were then immunoprecipitated with no antibody, anti-c-Myc, anti-phospho-c-Myc Ser-62, or anti-phospho-c-Myc Thr-58 antibodies for 12–18 h. The binding of c-Myc and phospho-c-Myc to the cyclin B1 promoter was then detected by quantitative real-time PCR using a DNA Engine 2 Opticon thermal cycler (MJ Research) and the LightCycler-FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I mix (Roche Applied Science). The real-time PCR cycling conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 5 min followed by 32 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C followed by fluorescence measurement. The polymerization temperature was set to 68 °C to allow accurate fluorescence measurements. Following PCR, a thermal melt profile was performed to identify the amplicons. Ct was determined by manually setting the threshold level of fluorescence during the early phase of the PCR amplification. In Vitro Translation and GST Pulldown Assay—In vitro translation of the c-Myc protein was performed using the TnT transcription-translation system (Promega). GST pulldown assays were performed by incubating GST protein alone or by incubating GST-cyclin fusion proteins immobilized on GST beads with in vitro translated 35S-labeled protein. Next, bound proteins were isolated by incubating the mixture for 2 h at 4°Cand then washing the mixture with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. The proteins were then eluted in SDS buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. Finally, the gels were developed using autoradiography. E-box-dependent Transcriptional Activation of Cyclin B1 by Cyclin G1—Transfection of the retroviral vector containing cyclin G1 to NCI-H460 lung cancer cells increased cyclin B1 protein levels by more than 2-fold. However, siRNA treatment of cyclin G1 reversed this phenomenon (Fig. 1A, Si-Cyclin G1). Because a previous study had indicated that overexpression of cyclin G1 induces cyclin B1 at the transcriptional level (37Seo H.R. Lee D.H. Lee H.J. Baek M. Bae S. Soh J.W. Lee S.J. Kim J. Lee Y.S. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 1475-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), the pathway by which cyclin G1 regulates the transcription activity of cyclin B1 was evaluated. Deletion or point mutations within the cyclin B1 promoter region revealed that increased cyclin B1 promoter activity in cells that overexpressed cyclin G1 was diminished by transfection of additional genes containing mutation of the E-box site in the cyclin B1 promoter region, which is the c-Myc binding site (Fig. 1B, top). In addition, the level of promoter activity was found to be similar to that of Si-cyclin G1-transfected cells (Fig. 1B, bottom). However, the transfection of point mutants containing CDE or CHR sites, which are the cell cycle-dependent transcriptional elements in the cyclin B1 promoter, did not affect the transcriptional activity of cyclin B1 in cells that overexpressed cyclin G1. Furthermore, in cells that overexpressed cyclin G1, the transcription activity of cyclin B1 was unaffected by transfection of deletion mutants containing NF-Y (ΔNF-Y2 and ΔNF-Y3), which are the dominant activating elements in the cyclin B1 promoter (Fig. 1B, top). Taken together, these results indicate that cyclin G1 overexpression increases the binding activity of c-Myc on the E-box of the cyclin B1 promoter site. Involvement of c-Myc in Cyclin G1-mediated Transcriptional Activation of Cyclin B1—Cyclin G1 overexpression increased the expression of c-Myc, which is one of the target proteins that bind to the E-box site. Therefore, we evaluated c-Myc expression to determine whether it was related to the cyclin G1-mediated transcriptional activation of cyclin B1. Treatment of cells that overexpressed cyclin G1 with Si-c-Myc inhibited cyclin B1 protein levels as well as its promoter activity, suggesting that cyclin G1-mediated c-Myc expression was involved in the promoter activation of cyclin B1 by cyclin G1 (Fig. 2, A and B). Furthermore, the increased DNA binding activity that was observed when an E-box probe was added to cyclin G1-transfected cell lysates was reduced by treatment with Si-c-Myc, and when cells that had been treated with a mutant E-box probe were used, the DNA binding activity disappeared completely (Fig. 2C). Increased Protein Stability of c-Myc by Cyclin G1—The mRNA level of c-Myc in cells that overexpress cyclin G1 did not change (supplemental Fig. 1). Therefore, we examined whether de novo protein synthesis or the protein stability of c-Myc was affected by cyclin G1. The half-life of c-Myc following treatment with cycloheximide was increased by cyclin G1 overexpression when compared with that of control MFG cells (Fig. 3A). However, when we examined c-Myc protein synthesis using [35S]methionine, no differences were observed between the control vector and cyclin G1-transfected cells (Fig. 3B), which suggests that cyclin G1 affects c-Myc protein stability. Increased Phosphorylation of c-Myc on Ser-62 by Cyclin G1—Because c-Myc stability is regulated by the phosphorylation status of Thr-58 and Ser-62 (24Henriksson M. Bakardjiev A. Klein G. Luscher B. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3199-3209PubMed Google Scholar, 26Pulverer B.J. Fisher C. Vousden K. Littlewood T. Evan G. Woodgett J.R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 59-70PubMed Google Scholar, 27Sears R. Leone G.

Biochem. 1999; 72: 483-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), the phosphorylation of c-Myc were examined. Increased phosphorylation of c-Myc on both Ser-62 and Thr-58 was observed in cells that overexpressed cyclin G1 (Fig. 4A). When the phosphorylation levels of c-Myc in the same amount of immunoprecipitated c-Myc protein were examined, expression of phospho-c-Myc on Ser-62 was found to be increased by cyclin G1 overexpression; however, no difference was observed in the expression of phospho-c-Myc on Thr-58 when control and cyclin G1-overexpressing cells were evaluated (Fig. 4B). This finding suggests that cyclin G1 overexpression stabilizes the c-Myc protein via phosphorylation on Ser-62. The DNA binding activity observed when we used the E-box probe also suggests that increased DNA binding activity to the E-box probe in cells that overexpressed cyclin G1 was inhibited by the addition of antibody to phospho-c-Myc on Ser-62; however, this did not occur when antibody to phospho-c-Myc on Thr-58 was added (supplemental Fig. 2). This finding suggests that phospho-c-Myc on Ser-62 was responsible for the increased DNA binding activity to the E-box of the cyclin B1 promoter in cells that overexpressed cyclin G1. To directly test the in vivo binding activity of c-Myc to the cyclin B1 promoter, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. Quantitative PCR and PCR data carrying the E-box DNA fragment in ChIPs of cyclin G1-overexpressing cells yielded signals for c-Myc and phospho-c-Myc (Ser-62) antibodies. However, the antibody of phospho-c-Myc (Thr-58) did not bind to the cyclin B1 promoter, and when we performed a ChIP assay of the α-globin promoter, no signals were detected (Fig. 4C, top). Moreover, a ChIP assay conducted using the lysates of cells transfected with various point mutants revealed that transfection of plasmids encoding wild-type or phospho-c-Myc on Ser-62 resulted in direct binding to the cyclin B1 promoter region but that transfection of plasmid encoding phospho-c-Myc on Thr-58 did not (Fig. 4C, bottom). Further, transfection with the point mutant containing c-Myc on Ser-62 (c-MycS62A, a phosphorylation-defective mutant) did not induce cyclin B1 protein expression or cyclin B1 promoter activity, even in the cyclin G1-overexpressing cells. However, the phospho-mimetic form still induced cyclin B1 protein expression and promoter activity in the case of c-MycS62D. Moreover, a mutation of c-Myc on Thr-58 (c-MycT58A) did not affect cyclin G1-mediated cyclin B1 protein expression or promoter activity. Additionally, transfection of c-MycT58A to cyclin G1-overexpressing cells increased cyclin B1 protein expression and its promoter activity; however, this increase was not found in the transfection of MycT58AS62A. This finding suggests that c-Myc phosphorylation on Ser-62 is important for increased cyclin B1 promoter activity by cyclin G1 (Fig. 4D). Protein stability was increased following cycloheximide treatment of c-MycS62D- or c-MycT58A-transfected cells, even though these cells showed a shortened half-life (Fig. 4E), which indicates that phosphorylation of c-Myc on Ser-62 by cyclin G1 overexpression increased the protein stability of c-Myc, as well as the binding activity of the E-box region of the cyclin B1 promoter. However, the phospho-defective form of c-Myc increased the protein stability of Thr-58. Activation of Cdk5 by Cyclin G1 Phosphorylates c-Myc on Ser-62—The activity of Cdk5, a binding partner of cyclin G1, was increased in cyclin G1-overexpressing cells (supplemental Fig. 3). In addition, treatment of the cells with Si-Cdk5 or Sicyclin G1 inhibited this kinase activity when c-Myc protein was used as a substrate. Increased phosphorylation of c-Myc on Ser-62 and cyclin B1 protein expression in cyclin G1-overexpressing cells were also inhibited by treatment with Si-Cdk5 or Si-cyclin G1. This suggests that Cdk5 is involved in cyclin G1-mediated c-Myc phosphorylation and cyclin B1 expression, as well as in cyclin B1 transcriptional activity (Fig. 5, A and B). To determine whether cyclin G1 or Cdk5 directly regulated c-Myc phosphorylation, an in vitro kinase assay was performed. Treatment with GST-cyclin G1 protein alone did not induce 32P incorporation when c-Myc was used as a substrate. However, treatment with GST-Cdk5 protein induced c-Myc phosphorylation, and co-treatment with GST-cyclin G1 and GST-Cdk5 protein enhanced 32P incorporation, which suggests that Cdk5 is responsible for c-Myc phosphorylation and co-treatment of cyclin G1 and that Cdk5 potentiates this phenomenon (Fig. 5C). An in vitro translational assay using a TnT kit also indicated that Cdk5 directly bound to c-Myc and that cyclin G1 potentiated this binding (Fig. 5D). Furthermore, addition of GST-cyclin G1 protein to the cell lysates of NCI-H596 resulted in a lower expression of cyclin G1, which in turn increased the level of c-Myc phosphorylation on Ser-62 via activation of Cdk5 by cyclin G1. Additionally, cell lysates that were treated with GST-Cdk5 protein showed greater c-Myc phosphorylation than those treated with only GST-cyclin G1 protein, and co-treatment with GST-cyclin G1 and GST-Cdk5 proteins dramatically increased these phenomena (Fig. 5E). Taken together, these results indicate that cyclin G1-mediated c-Myc phosphorylation on Ser-62 and cyclin B1 expression resulted from Cdk5 activation by cyclin G1. Binding Site of c-Myc in the Interaction with Cdk5—The binding of c-Myc with Cdk5 was detected in the immunoprecipitates of NCI-H460 cells following transfection with c-Myc (Fig. 6A); therefore, we evaluated the binding activity of several deletion constructs of c-Myc. The F4 fragment was found to bind to Cdk5; however, no interactions were observed between Cdk5 and fragments F1, F2, and F3 (Fig. 6B). These findings indicate that amino acid sequence 1–100 of the amino terminus of c-Myc is the binding site that interacts with Cdk5. Involvement of Increased Activity of Cdk5 in Cyclin G1-overexpressing Cells in Radiation-induced M Phase Arrest and Cell Death—It has been reported that cyclin G1 overexpression results in increased radiation-induced M phase arrest and cell death. In this study, activation of Cdk5 by cyclin G1 phosphorylated c-Myc on Ser-62, which was in turn responsible for increased cyclin B1 promoter activity. Therefore, we evaluated Cdk5 to determine whether it was involved in M phase arrest and cell death. Phosphorylated histone H3, a mitosis marker, was induced by overnight nocodazole block and release for a greater length of time in cells that overexpressed cyclin G1 than in MFG control cells. However, when cells that overexpressed cyclin G1 were treated with Si-Cdk5, this phenomenon was blocked (Fig. 7A, top). Increased G2/M phase arrest by nocodazole treatment in cells that overexpressed cyclin G1 was also inhibited by Si-Cdk5 (Fig. 7A, bottom). Additionally radiation increased the expression of cyclin G1 and c-Myc phosphorylation on Ser-62 and cyclin B1, as well as Cdk5 kinase activity. However, siRNA of cyclin G1 or Cdk5 inhibited these phenomena (Fig. 7B). Furthermore, increased cell death in response to radiation in cells that overexpressed cyclin G1 was also inhibited by Si-Cdk5 (Fig. 7C). Taken together, these results suggest that an increase in cyclin G1-induced M phase arrest and cell death was mediated by Cdk5 activation. We have described here a new role for cyclin G1, which previously had been shown to induce activation of cyclin B1 transcription (37Seo H.R. Lee D.H. Lee H.J. Baek M. Bae S. Soh J.W. Lee S.J. Kim J. Lee Y.S. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 1475-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We have identified c-Myc phosphorylation on Ser-62 by Cdk5, which is a prominent partner of cyclin G1. Additionally, we have demonstrated that c-Myc phosphorylation is essential for transcriptional activation of cyclin B1 by cyclin G1 to occur. Cyclin G1 was originally identified as a novel member of the cyclin family and is one of the target genes of transcriptional factor p53 (29Okamoto K. Beach D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4816-4822Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 30Zauberman A. Lupo A. Oren M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2361-2366PubMed Google Scholar). However, in our system, the role that cyclin G1 plays in transcriptional activation of cyclin B1 exhibited a p53-independent pattern (supplemental Fig. 4). In addition, the cyclin G1-mediated increase of cyclin B1 expression was observed in both p53 wild-type and null cells. Moreover, there are reports that p53 can repress the transcription of cyclin B1 (14Yin X.Y. Grove L. Datta N.S. Katula K. Long M.W. Prochownik E.V. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6487-6493PubMed Google Scholar), which suggests that p53 function is not involved in cyclin B1 transcription. Cyclin G1 has been shown to play an important role in various biological phenomena (36Okamoto K. Prives C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4606-4615Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 39Bates S. Rowan S.

Lee S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11022-11029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and the molecules that it associates with have been identified (31Kanaoka Y. Kimura S.H. Okazaki I. Ikeda M. Nojima H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 41Okamoto K. Kamibayashi C. Serrano M. Prives C. Mumby M.C. Beach D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6593-6602Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). However, the functional consequences of cyclin G1 are still the subject of debate. For instance, transcription of cyclin G1 is induced within a few hours of growth factor stimulation of quiescent cells (42Smith M.L. Kontny H.U. Bortnick R. Fornace Jr., A.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 230: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In addition, retroviral vector-mediated gene transfection of antisense cyclin G1 inhibits proliferation of human osteogenic sarcoma cells (43Skotzko M. Wu L. Anderson W.F. Gordon E.M. Hall F.L. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5493-5498PubMed Google Scholar), which suggests that cyclin G1 plays a pivotal role in mammalian cell growth regulation. Conversely, some data suggest that cyclin G1 has growth-inhibitory activity (36Okamoto K. Prives C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4606-4615Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 39Bates S. Rowan S. Vousden K.H. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1103-1109PubMed Google Scholar, 44Jensen M.R. Factor V.M. Thorgeirsson S.S. Hepatology. 1998; 28: 537-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a recent study concluded that a low level of cyclin G1 results in a lack of growth-inhibitory activity and may even promote growth (37Seo H.R. Lee D.H. Lee H.J. Baek M. Bae S. Soh J.W. Lee S.J. Kim J. Lee Y.S. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 1475-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), whereas high levels of cyclin G1 suppress growth activity. Previously, we found that cyclin G1 increases radiation-induced M phase arrest and cell death as a result of increased cyclin B1 promoter activity. Synthesis of cyclin B1 during the cell cycle is regulated primarily at the transcriptional level (37Seo H.R. Lee D.H. Lee H.J. Baek M. Bae S. Soh J.W. Lee S.J. Kim J. Lee Y.S. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 1475-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and cell cycle-related transcription by this promoter is regulated by a CDE and CHR tandem element (7Lange-zu Dohna C. Brandeis M. Berr F. Mossner J. Engeland K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 484: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, the cyclin B1 promoter is also subject to activation by c-Myc. Here, we have demonstrated that cells that overexpress cyclin G1 increased the promoter activity of cyclin B1 through activation of the E-box, which suggests that activation of the cyclin B1 promoter by cyclin G1 is dependant on c-Myc (Fig. 1). Indeed, in our system, cyclin G1 overexpression increased the c-Myc protein level (Fig. 2). However, levels of c-Myc mRNA and c-Myc protein synthesis were not altered by cyclin G1, but the protein stability of c-Myc was increased (Fig. 3). Therefore, we evaluated the phosphorylation status of c-Myc to determine whether it was affected by cyclin G1. It has been reported that phosphorylation sites Thr-58 and Ser-62 are associated with c-Myc degradation (24Henriksson M. Bakardjiev A. Klein G. Luscher B. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3199-3209PubMed Google Scholar, 25Lutterbach B. Hann S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5510-5522Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 26Pulverer B.J. Fisher C. Vousden K. Littlewood T. Evan G. Woodgett J.R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 59-70PubMed Google Scholar, 27Sears R. Leone G. DeGregori J. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 169-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), and in this study we observed that cyclin G1 increased c-Myc phosphorylation on Ser-62. However, increased phosphorylation of c-Myc on Thr-58 in cells that overexpressed cyclin G1 was not the direct consequence of overexpression of cyclin G1 (Fig. 4). Phosphorylation of c-Myc on Ser-62 is regulated by ERK1/2 activation, and GSK-3β is involved in c-Myc phosphorylation on Thr-58. Nevertheless, because cyclin G1 overexpression did not affect the status of ERK1/2 and GSK-3β phosphorylation (supplemental Fig. 5), we excluded c-Myc phosphorylation by ERK1/2 or GSK-3. Although the mechanism by which phospho-c-Myc on Thr-58 increased by cyclin G1 is unclear, it is possible that increased phospho-c-Myc on Ser-62 affected the stability of phospho-c-Myc on Thr-58. Indeed, when we examined the half-life of the phospho-mimetic (c-MycT58D) or phospho-defective (c-MycT58A) forms of c-Myc on Thr-58, c-MycT58A was found to have greater stability than c-MycT58D (Fig. 4). In our system, the phospho form of c-Myc on Ser-62 was found to increase the binding activity of the cyclin B1 promoter region. It has been reported that c-Myc phosphorylation on Ser-62 and Thr-58 has no impact on the transcriptional activity of E-box-containing promoters (45Law W. Linial M.L. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1118-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 46Chang D.W. Claassen G.F. Hann S.R. Cole M.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4309-4319Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 47Conzen S.D. Gottlob K. Kandel E.S. Khanduri P. Wagner A.J. O'Leary M. Hay N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6008-6018Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, several studies have suggested that phosphorylation of c-Myc enhances the transcriptional activity of its target genes (27Sears R. Leone G. DeGregori J. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 169-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 48Benassi B. Fanciulli M. Fiorentino F. Porrello A. Chiorino G. Loda M. Zupi G. Biroccio A. Mol.

Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 219-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Our data also suggest that phosphorylation of c-Myc on Ser-62, but not on Thr-58, affects its ability to bind to the E-box of cyclin B1 (Fig. 4). It is not clear why only phospho-c-Myc on Ser-62 enhanced the promoter activity of cyclin B1; however, it has been shown that c-MycS62A fails to be recruited to the E-box site of γ-glutamyl cysteine synthetase promoter (48Benassi B. Fanciulli M. Fiorentino F. Porrello A. Chiorino G. Loda M. Zupi G. Biroccio A. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 509-519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), which is similar to the results of this study. Cyclin G1 does not have kinase activity; therefore, we evaluated binding partners of cyclin G1, such as Cdk5, to determine whether they were involved in c-Myc phosphorylation. Cdk5 kinase activity was found to be increased by cyclin G1 overexpression, and knockdown of Cdk5 by siRNA showed inhibition of c-Myc phosphorylation on Ser-62 as well as inhibition of cyclin B1 promoter activity. In addition, an in vitro kinase assay revealed that Cdk5 alone induced c-Myc phosphorylation and that additional treatment with cyclin G1 potentiated this phenomenon, whereas cyclin G1 alone did not (Fig. 5). Furthermore, the results of this study revealed an interaction between c-Myc and Cdk5 (Fig. 6), which suggests that this interaction was important for the phosphorylation of c-Myc by Cdk5 to occur. We previously reported that cyclin G1 was overexpressed in cancer tissues, including cancerous lung tissues (37Seo H.R. Lee D.H. Lee H.J. Baek M. Bae S. Soh J.W. Lee S.J. Kim J. Lee Y.S. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 1475-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In this study, the cyclin G1 levels in several lung cancer cell lines were found to be well correlated with c-Myc phosphorylation on Ser-62, as well as with cyclin B1 expression, both of which were mediated by Cdk5 (supplemental Fig. 6). Taken together, these results suggest that the cyclin B1 expression level in cyclin G1-overexpressing cancer cells was controlled by Cdk5. It has been shown that cyclin G1 overexpression results in increased radiation sensitivity as a result of the increased transition from the G2 to M phase, which occurs due to cyclin B1 promoter activation (37Seo H.R. Lee D.H. Lee H.J. Baek M. Bae S. Soh J.W. Lee S.J. Kim J. Lee Y.S. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 1475-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In this study, inhibition of Cdk5 by siRNA treatment was found to reduce radiation-induced G2/M phase arrest and cell death in cyclin G1-overexpressing cells. This suggests that Cdk5-mediated activation of c-Myc phosphorylation on Ser-62, which is responsible for the transcriptional activation of cyclin B1, is essential for increased radiation sensitivity by cyclin G1 (Fig. 7). In conclusion, the results of this study provide an explanation for the mechanism by which cyclin G1 regulates cyclin B1 promoter activity. We propose that Cdk5, the binding partner of cyclin G1, is responsible for c-Myc phosphorylation on Ser-62 and that this phosphorylated c-Myc has an increased protein half-life and binds to the E-box promoter region of cyclin B1. Further, we suggest that these effects result in increased cyclin B1 promoter activation in cyclin G1-overexpressing cells, which are frequently observed in cancer cells (Fig. 8).

https://openalex.org/W2037324200,"HPV-16E7 is a major transforming protein, which has been implicated in the development of cervical cancer. The stability of E7 is thus important to ensure its fully functional status. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we found that USP11 (ubiquitin-specific protease 11), a member of a protein family that cleaves polyubiquitin chains and/or ubiquitin precursors, interacts and forms a specific complex with HPV-16E7. Our results indicate that the USP11 can greatly increase the steady state level of HPV-16E7 by reducing ubiquitination and attenuating E7 degradation. In contrast, a catalytically inactive mutant of USP11 abolished the deubiquitinating ability and returned E7 to a normal rate of degradation. Moreover, USP11 not only protected E7 from ubiquitination but also influenced E7 function as a modulator of cell growth status. These results suggest that USP11 plays an important role in regulating the levels of E7 protein and subsequently affects the biological function of E7 as well as its contribution to cell transformation by HPV-16E7."
https://openalex.org/W2056570718,"The c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway mediates stress responses in cells. JNK activity is regulated by a protein kinase cascade consisting of a MAPK kinase (MKK) and a MAPK kinase kinase (MAPKKK). beta-Arrestin-2 acts as a scaffold by directly binding to the JNK3 isoform and also by recruiting MKK4 and the MAPKKK apoptosis-signaling kinase-1 (ASK1). In this study, we demonstrate by co-precipitation that the extended N-terminal region of JNK3 mediates binding to the C terminus of beta-arrestin-2 and that the N terminus of JNK3 is required for its activation via beta-arrestin-2. We have used site-specific mutagenesis to identify key residues within the N terminus of JNK3 that are essential for binding and demonstrate that this region represents an independent beta-arrestin-2 binding motif that can be fused to other MAPKs and permit their recruitment to the scaffold complex. In addition, we demonstrate that JNK3 recruits MKK4 to the beta-arrestin-2 scaffold complex by binding to the MAPK docking domain (D-domain) located within the N terminus of MKK4. These findings uncover molecular determinants of beta-arrestin-2 scaffold complex assembly and assign a previously unrecognized role for the unique extended N terminus of JNK3."

Influenza B virus, which is a distinct virus from influenza A virus and is classified in a separate genus from influenza A virus, has caused infections that have totaled up to 50% of all influenza disease in recent years, making it a “significant human health problem, particularly for those under 5 years old and for those over 50 years old” (see Centers for Disease Control site on the World Wide Web).

Grunert R.R. Haff R.F. McGahen J.W. Neumayer E.M. Paulshock M. Watts J.C. Wood T.R. Herman E.C. Hoffman C.E. Science. 1964; 144: 862-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). The reason for this is that the BM2 ion channel is not inhibited by the drug (9Mould J.A. Paterson R.G. Takeda M. Ohigashi Y. Venkataraman P. Lamb R.A. Pinto L.H. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), whereas the A/M2 ion channel is completely inhibited by the drug (2Pinto L.H. Holsinger L.J. Lamb R.A.

It has been suggested that the failure of amantadine to inhibit the BM2 channel is due to differences in the transmembrane (TM) 4The abbreviations used are: TM, transmembrane; CuP, Cu(II) (1,10-phenanthroline)3; MTSEA, (2-aminoethyl)-methane thiosulfonate; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; WT, wild type; PI, perturbation index. 4The abbreviations used are: TM, transmembrane; CuP, Cu(II) (1,10-phenanthroline)3; MTSEA, (2-aminoethyl)-methane thiosulfonate; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; WT, wild type; PI, perturbation index. domain pore-lining residues (9Mould J.A.

It has been demonstrated in many ways that the ion channel activity of the A/M2 protein is intrinsic (2Pinto L.H. Holsinger L.J. Lamb R.A. Cell. 1992; 69: 517-528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar, 11Wang C. Lamb R.A. Pinto L.H.

Physiol. 1996; 494: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Recent crystallographic (13Stouffer A.L. Acharya R. Salom D. Levine A.S. Di Costanzo L. Soto C.S. Tereshko V. Nanda V. Stayrook S. DeGrado W.F. Nature. 2008; 451: 596-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar) and NMR (14Schnell J.R. Chou J.J. Nature. 2008; 451: 591-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar) studies of the structure of the A/M2 protein have suggested similar mechanisms for proton conduction and activation but quite different mechanisms for inhibition by amantadine. An essential foundation for both of these studies was prior biochemical information about the A/M2 channel, particularly its pore-lining residues (15Gandhi C.S. Shuck K. Lear J.D. Dieckmann G.R.

Virology. 1999; 254: 196-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and its active oligomeric state (18Sakaguchi T. Tu Q. Pinto L.H. Lamb R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5000-5005Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Although the active oligomeric state of the BM2 channel is known to be a tetramer (19Balannik V. Lamb R.A. Pinto L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 4895-4904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), the pore-lining residues of the channel have not yet been identified. Identification of the pore-lining residues in the BM2 channel would provide a needed foundation for further studies. The mature BM2 protein consists of a 6-residue N-terminal extracellular domain, a single internal hydrophobic domain of 19 residues that acts as a TM domain and forms the pore of the channel, and an 83-residue cytoplasmic tail (20Paterson R.G. Takeda M. Ohigashi Y. Pinto L.H. Lamb R.A. Virology. 2003; 306: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Because protons must pass through the membrane via the pore of an ion channel, knowledge of the pore region of these ion channels is necessary 1) for understanding the conduction of protons and the binding of inhibitors 2), to understand why amantadine does not inhibit the BM2 ion channel, and 3) to identify potential BM2 inhibitors. The pore-lining residues of the A/M2 ion channel were identified by a series of approaches. The first employed cysteine scanning mutagenesis (21Pinto L.H. Dieckmann G.R. Gandhi C.S. Papworth C.G. Braman J. Shaughnessy M.A. Lear J.D. Lamb R.A. DeGrado W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11301-11306Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) and the use of water soluble sulfhydryl specific reagents that attach a large hydrophobic adduct to cysteine residues (16Shuck K. Lamb R.A. Pinto L.H. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 7755-7761Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). If the current of a mutant channel with a cysteine residue in a particular location is modified by the reagent, then it is concluded that the sulfhydryl moiety of the cysteine faces the aqueous pore at that location. The current of cysteine mutant proteins A/M2-A30C and -G34C were diminished when the reagent was applied to the medium bathing the N-terminal ectodomain. The current of the cysteine mutant protein A/M2-W41C was decreased when the reagent was injected into the cytoplasm but not when applied to the bathing medium. Moreover, the A/M2-G34C mutant protein was not affected by cytoplasmic injection of the reagent. These data are consistent with His37 of the A/M2 protein forming a barrier to large molecules. Cysteine-scanning mutagenesis was also used together with oxidative disulfide cross-linking (17Bauer C.M. Pinto L.H. Cross T.A. Lamb R.A. Virology. 1999; 254: 196-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) to show that residues 27, 30, 34, 37, and 41 formed dimers most rapidly. Finally, two naturally occurring amantadine-resistant mutations occurred for residues that were identified as pore-lining (A/M2-A30C and -G34E). The secondary structure of the TM domain of the A/M2 channel has been studied with solid state NMR spectroscopy of the TM peptide (22Kovacs F.A. Denny J.K. Song Z. Quine J.R. Cross T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 23Song Z. Kovacs F.A. Wang J. Denny J.K. Shekar S.C. Quine J.R. Cross T.A. Biophys.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13170-13177Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and the full-length A/M2 ion channel protein (26Tian C. Tobler K. Lamb R.A. Pinto L.H. Cross T.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11294-11300Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 27Tian C. Gao P.F. Pinto L.H. Lamb R.A. Cross T.A. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 2597-2605Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). From these studies, it was concluded that the orientation of the helical bundle forming the TM domain has a tilt angle of ∼25°. Further hydrogen/deuterium exchange measurements showed that the above residues in the TM helix exchange more rapidly than residues located in the cytoplasmic domain (27Tian C. Gao P.F. Pinto L.H. Lamb R.A. Cross T.A. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 2597-2605Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), consistent with the presence of an aqueous pore. Most recently, the crystal structure of the TM peptide (residues 22–46) revealed that the aqueous cavity at the N-terminal half of the TM domain was lined by residues Val27, Ala30, and Gly34. At the C-terminal half of the TM domain, His37 and Trp41 constrict the A/M2 channel (13Stouffer A.L. Acharya R. Salom D. Levine A.S. Di Costanzo L. Soto C.S. Tereshko V. Nanda V. Stayrook S. DeGrado W.F. Nature. 2008; 451: 596-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Thus, the aqueous pore of the A/M2 ion channel is formed by Val27, Ala30, Gly34, His37, and Trp41; these residues line the pore of the four-helix bundle. The present study employed three of the above approaches to identify the pore-lining residues of the BM2 ion channel protein. In contrast to the structure of A/M2 TM domain, very little is known about the TM domain of the BM2 ion channel protein (9Mould J.A. Paterson R.G. Takeda M. Ohigashi Y. Venkataraman P. Lamb R.A. Pinto L.H. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). When the conserved histidine and tryptophan residues of the TM domains of the A/M2 and BM2 proteins are aligned, the residues of the BM2 protein that fall opposite to the pore-lining Val27, Ala30, and Gly34 of the A/M2 protein are all serines (Ser9, Ser12, and Ser16; these are the “a” and “d” residues in Sequences 1 and 2). However, alignment of protein sequences is insufficient to demonstrate which residues line the pore, and furthermore, alignment alone does not provide accessibility information (Sequences 1 and 2). Here, we report findings using cysteine-scanning mutagenesis in combination with the substituted cysteine accessibility method and measurement of key ion channel properties. Our data suggest that the pore of BM2 proton channel is lined with polar residues, which is very different from the A/M2 protein of influenza A virus. A computational model of the BM2 TM domain was proposed that is in good agreement with the experimental data. The pore-lining residues and molecular model were further confirmed by quantification of disulfide-linked dimers. Knowledge of these pore-lining residues will serve as the foundation for detailed biophysical studies and will help to identify inhibitors of the channel. Cloning and Site-specific Mutagenesis—Plasmid constructs were based on the cDNA to segment 7 RNA of influenza B/Lee/40 virus. Cloning of BM2-FLAG into plasmid vector, pGEM3, was done as described previously (20Paterson R.G. Takeda M. Ohigashi Y. Pinto L.H. Lamb R.A. Virology. 2003; 306: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis using site overlap extension PCR was carried out so that each of the BM2 TM domain residues was mutated to cysteine. Serine to glycine and isoleucine mutations were prepared employing the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis method. It should be noted that all of the cysteine substitution mutations were made in the wild type (WT) BM2 sequence, and thus all of the mutants also contain a cysteine at residue 11, but as discussed below, this does not affect the interpretation of the data. Sequences of plasmids and details of all cloning steps are available upon request. mRNA Synthesis, Culture, and Microinjection of Oocytes— BM2-pGEM cDNA was linearized using the HindIII restriction site found downstream of the gene, and in vitro transcription reactions were performed on the linearized cDNA using a T7 mMESSAGE mMACHINE® transcription kit (Ambion, Houston, TX). Xenopus laevis ovarian lobules were surgically removed from females (Nasco, Fort Atkinson, WI), and individual oocytes were dissociated from the follicle cells by digestion with collagenase B (2 mg/ml; Roche Applied Science) as previously described (2Pinto L.H. Holsinger L.J. Lamb R.A. Cell. 1992; 69: 517-528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar). Oocytes of good size and color (as described in Ref. 23Song Z. Kovacs F.A. Wang J. Denny J.K. Shekar S.C. Quine J.R. Cross T.A. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 767-775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) were injected with 50 nl of mRNA (∼1.0 μg/μl), using a 20-μm diameter glass pipette 24 h postdefolliculation. Oocytes were maintained at 16 °C in ND96 solution (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm pyruvic acid, 5 mm HEPES-NaOH, 0.1 mg/ml gentamycin (pH 8.5)). Membrane Current Recording in Oocytes—Whole cell current was measured from oocytes 48–72 h after mRNA injection using a two-electrode voltage clamp technique and a Dagan TEV 200A amplifier (Dagan Corp., Minneapolis, MN) at room temperature using electrodes filled with 3 m KCl. Individual oocytes were held at a voltage of -20 mV and bathed in normal Barth's solution (88.0 mm NaCl, 1.0 mm KCl, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 0.3 mm NaNO3, 0.71 mm CaCl2, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 15 mm HEPES (for pH 8.5) or 15 mm MES (for pH 5.5)) or a modified solution during recording (28Shimbo K. Brassard D.L. Lamb R.A. Pinto L.H. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1336-1346Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Membrane voltage ramp measurements were made throughout the recordings, spanning a 100-mV range from -40 to 60 mV. Data were collected and analyzed using the pCLAMP 10.0 software package. Reversal Voltage Measurements—It has been shown that reversal voltage for proton channels, measured in the absence of a mobile buffer, can be altered rapidly because of local pH changes near the cytoplasmic leaflet of the surface membrane (29Mould J.A. Drury J.E. Frings S.M. Kaupp U.B. Pekosz A. Lamb R.A. Pinto L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31038-31050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In order to minimize this effect, membrane voltage ramp measurements were made at pH 5.5 at the time when the amplitude of the steady inward current was maximal. The voltage ramp spanned a 100-mV range from -40 to 60 mV. For each cell expressing a given protein, the reversal voltage was plotted against the steady inward current for that cell, and a straight line was fitted to the plot. The y intercept of this plot was taken as the reversal voltage (Vrev) of the protein. The reversal voltage data here represent the best fit y intercept ± S.E. Immunofluorescence of Living Oocytes—Individual oocytes, the membrane currents of which had been studied previously, were washed with ND96 solution and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in preparation for testing the relative surface expression levels of the mutant BM2 proteins. Oocytes were first incubated with nonfat milk (5% in ND96 solution) containing 0.1% saponin for 1 h, followed by a 1-h incubation with ANTI-FLAG® M2 monoclonal antibody (F 3165; Sigma; 10 μg/ml in ND96 solution containing 2% milk and 0.1% saponin), three washes with ND96 solution (10 min each), incubation with goat anti-mouse IgG1 (γ1), and labeling with Alexa Fluor® 546 (A21123; Molecular Probes, Inc., Medford, OR; 20 μg/ml in ND96 solution containing 2% milk, 0.1% saponin) for 1 h, followed by three more washes (10 min each) with ND96 solution. All steps were carried out at 4 °C, and the ND96 solution used lacked CaCl2, gentamycin, and pyruvate. Fluorescence was quantified using a PTI Image Master microfluorometer (Photon Technologies) with a 20 × 0.5 numerical aperture objective, as described previously (30Venkataraman P. Lamb R.A. Pinto L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21463-21472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). About one-half of the surface of each oocyte was imaged using the CCD camera. The excitation wavelength for the Alexa Fluor® was 540 nm. Intensity quantifications were made using Image Master version 5.0 software (Photon Technologies). Uninjected oocytes were subjected to the same conditions just described as a control for the autofluorescence from the yolk (31Beumer T.L. Veenstra G.J. Hage W.J. Destree O.H. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 9Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Measurement of the Effects of MTSEA and NEM on the BM2 Cysteine Substitution Mutant Ion Channels—The effect of Cys-specific reagents on BM2 ion channel activities was determined as follows. For MTSEA, oocyte inward currents were measured first in pH 5.5 Barth's solution, and then oocytes were incubated in pH 8.5 Barth's solution with 2.5 mm MTSEA for 5 min followed by a 2-min washout. The oocyte inward currents were measured again in pH 5.5 Barth's solution and compared with the original current before the MTSEA application. In the case of BM2-F13C protein, at the end of measurement, we further applied 5 mm dithiothreitol for 2 min at pH 8.5 to the oocyte, washed for another 2 min, and measured the maximal inward current again. For NEM, the overall procedure was similar to that for MTSEA, except that we applied 1 mm NEM to the outside of the oocytes and incubated for 10 min. Data Analysis—The periodicity of various parameters, Y (i.e. specific activity, Vrev, perturbation index, and oligomer formation percentage), associated with the amino acid side chains versus their positions in the TM sequence, n, was analyzed by fitting a sinusoidal function, Y = A + B·sin(6.28·(C + n)/D), to the data using Graphpad Prism (version 5.0), in which A is the midpoint of the curve, B is the amplitude, C is the phase, and D is the period of the sinusoid wave. The perturbation index was determined as previously described (21Pinto L.H. Dieckmann G.R. Gandhi C.S. Papworth C.G. Braman J. Shaughnessy M.A. Lear J.D. Lamb R.A. DeGrado W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11301-11306Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Briefly, the degree of perturbation to the specific activity or reversal voltage with a mutation at a given position n is defined as follows: perturbation index (PI) = 1 - X(n)/X(WT), in which X(n) is the specific activity or reversal voltage at position n, and X(WT) is specific activity or reversal voltage of wild type. The PI values increase as the severity of the perturbation increases. The final PI values at each position, n, were normalized. The average PI values were calculated separately for specific activity and reversal voltage. Cross-linking by Cu(II) (1,10-Phenanthroline)3—The BM2 proteins expressed in oocytes were cross-linked by Cu(II) (1,10-phenanthroline)3 (CuP) using a modification of the method described previously (17Bauer C.M. Pinto L.H. Cross T.A. Lamb R.A. Virology. 1999; 254: 196-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). After 48–60 h of injection, 15–20 oocytes expressing each BM2 protein were incubated in 10 μl/oocyte RSB buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 15 mm MgCl2) for 10 min on ice and homogenized by pipetting. Cell lysates were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min in the absence or presence of 300 μm CuP (from 30 mm stock CuP solution composed of 30 mm CuSO4 and 90 mm 1,10-phenanthroline, prepared fresh from 0.15 m CuSO4 in water and 0.45 m 1,10-phenanthroline in DMSO). The reaction was stopped by the addition of 10 mm NEM and 10 mm EDTA. Membranes were dissolved by the addition of radioimmune precipitation buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS) in the presence of proteinase inhibitors and 50 mm iodoacetamide. The cross-linking experiments were done three times with three batches of oocytes taken from different X. laevis. SDS-PAGE and Western Blot—Polypeptides were separated by nonreducing SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. PageRuler Plus Prestained Protein Ladder (Fermentas Life Sciences, Glen Burnie, MD) was used as a molecular weight marker. The BM2 proteins were probed with ANTI-FLAG® M2 monoclonal antibody (F 3165; Sigma), followed by horseradish peroxide-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA). Labeled proteins were detected by ECL Plus Western blotting detection reagent (GE Healthcare). The intensity of bands corresponding to monomers, dimers, trimers, and tetramers of the BM2 proteins was quantified using ImageJ. The uninjected oocyte sample lane was used for the background. The percentage of each form was expressed as a fraction of each form to the total protein (i.e. the sum of monomer, dimer, trimer, and tetramer). Constructing TM Bundle Scaffolds—Both idealized and coiled helical TM bundles were constructed for residues 7–25 of the BM2 protein sequence. TM bundles composed of idealized α-helices were generated using a rigid body search. The rigid body search started with an idealized α-helical backbone structure aligned on the global z axis. The helix was oriented about the global z axis so that the angle formed between the Cα atoms of Ser16 and His19 would be bisected by the global x axis. The centered helix was then translated along the global z axis (ztrans) followed by translation along the global x axis (xtrans). After translation, the helix was rotated about the global x axis (xrot). Finally, the helix was allowed to rotate about its central axis (Axialrot) to vary the phase. The parameters were systematically varied as follows: (a) ztrans was varied between -15 and 15 Å using a step size of 2.0 Å; (b) xtrans was varied between 2.5 and 7.5 Å using a step size of 1.0 Å; (c) Xrot was varied between -40 and 40° using a step size of 5.0°; and (d) Axialrot was varied between -50 and 50° using a step size of 2.0°. C4 symmetry was used to generate the symmetry mates. TM bundles were also constructed using coiled α-helices based on Crick's equations (32Crick F.H. Acta Crystallogr. 1953; 6: 685-689Crossref Google Scholar, 33North B. Summa C.M. Ghirlanda G. DeGrado W.F. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 1081-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) with the following parameters kept constant: (a) superhelical pitch set at 194 Å; (b) rise per residue of the minor helix set to 1.5 Å; (c) radius of the minor helix set at 2.25 Å; (d) periodicity of the minor helix set to 2π/3.5; and (e) periodicity of the major helix set to 2π/(pitch/rise per residue). The superhelical radius was varied between 8.5 and 10.5 Å using a step size of 0.2 Å. The phase of the minor helix was varied between -180° and 180° using a step size of 2.0°. C4 symmetry was used to generate the symmetry mates. Filtering TM Bundles—After construction of the TM bundles, each model was screened using two filters. The first filter screened for steric clashes between the different monomers. If the distance between two heavy atoms was less than 4.0 Å, the bundle was discarded. A large cut-off distance was used to accommodate the placement of bulky side chains. The second filter correlated the PI values for the residues (see above) with a normalized expression involving the phase angle. The details of the filter and its implementation will be described more fully elsewhere. Briefly, the phase angle is formed between two vectors after projecting C (α) coordinates from the bundle onto the xy plane. The first vector was constructed from the helix axis to a C(α) atom on the helix. The second vector was constructed from the helix axis to the global origin. Adding a value of 1 to the cosine of this angle and then normalizing the quantity by 2 gives an expression that can range in value from 0 to 1. At an angle of zero, the C (α) atom is facing directly inward toward the bundle axis. The expression will yield a maximal value of 1. At an angle of 180°, the C (α) atom is facing directly outward, and the expression will yield the minimum value of 0. Bundles with correlation coefficients of less than 0.60 between the PI values and the expression involving the phase angle were discarded. Application of the two filters yielded 2055 bundles composed of straight helices and 107 bundles composed of coiled helices. Side Chain Addition and Energy Minimization—After filtering the bundles, side chains were placed onto the helix backbones using the side chain addition program SCAP (34Xiang Z. Honig B. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 421-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Since the backbone geometry was kept rigid, side chain addition occasionally resulted in steric “bumps” that could be relieved using energy minimization with a molecular mechanics force field. Bundle geometry was optimized using the CHARMM22 molecular mechanics force field implemented in the XPLOR-NIH package (35Schwieters C.D. Kuszewski J.J. Tjandra N. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 2003; 160: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (1861) Google Scholar). Hydrogen atom addition was carried out using the “hbuild” procedure, followed by 1000 steps of Powell energy minimization using a distance-dependent dielectric set to a value of 4r. Clustering TM Bundles—The 200 top scoring bundles were clustered such that each member in the cluster had a C (α) root mean square distance of less than 1.5 Å to any other member in the cluster. This produced a total of eight clusters. The bundle with the smallest sum of C (α) root mean square distance values to all of the other bundles in the cluster was chosen as the centroid model. Parameters used to generate the centroid models are shown in supplemental Table 1. Relative Specific Activity of Cysteine Substitution Mutant Ion Channels—The goal of these experiments was to identify the amino acid residues that line the pore of the BM2 ion channel. TM domain residues were changed individually to cysteine, since it is thought that changing the residues that line the pore would cause modification of channel properties. The single channel conductance and open probability are the best measures of ion channel activity, but in previous studies, it was found that the single channel conductance of the A/M2 ion channel is too low to be measured (29Mould J.A. Drury J.E. Frings S.M. Kaupp U.B. Pek"
https://openalex.org/W2037467991,"We analysed the involvement of proteases during taxol-mediated cell death of human A549 non-small-cell lung carcinoma cells using a proteomics approach that specifically targets protein N termini and further detects newly formed N termini that are the result of protein processing. Our analysis revealed 27 protease-mediated cleavages, which we divided in sites C-terminal to aspartic acid (Asp) and sites C-terminal to non-Asp residues, as the result of caspase and non-caspase protease activities, respectively. Remarkably, some of the former were insensitive to potent pancaspase inhibitors, and we therefore suggest that previous inhibitor-based studies that report on the caspase-independent nature of taxol-induced cell death should be judged with care. Furthermore, many of the sites C-terminal to non-Asp residues were also uniquely observed in a model of cytotoxic granule-mediated cell death and/or found by in vitro cataloging human μ-calpain substrates using a similar proteomics technique. This thus raises the hypothesis that killing tumor cells by chemotherapy or by immune cells holds similar non-Asp-specific proteolytic components with strong indications to calpain activity."
https://openalex.org/W2050226450,"HIV-1 gp41 cytoplasmic tail (CT) is highly conserved among HIV-1 isolates, particularly the region designated lentivirus lytic peptide (LLP1–2), which includes two α-helical domains LLP1 and LLP2. Although the gp41 CT is recognized as a modulator of viral fusogenicity, little is known about the regulatory mechanism of this region in the viral fusion process. Here we report that anti-LLP1–2 and anti-LLP2 antibodies (IgG) inhibited HIV-1 Env-mediated cell fusion and bound to the interface between effector and target cells at a suboptimal temperature (31.5 °C), which slows down the fusion process and prolongs the fusion intermediate state. This suggests that LLP1–2, especially the LLP2 region located inside the viral membrane, is transiently exposed on the membrane surface during the fusion process. Synthetic LLP2 peptide could bind to the gp41 six-helix bundle core with high binding affinity. These results suggest that the gp41 CT may interact with the gp41 core, via the surface-exposed LLP2 domain, to regulate Env-mediated membrane fusion. HIV-1 gp41 cytoplasmic tail (CT) is highly conserved among HIV-1 isolates, particularly the region designated lentivirus lytic peptide (LLP1–2), which includes two α-helical domains LLP1 and LLP2. Although the gp41 CT is recognized as a modulator of viral fusogenicity, little is known about the regulatory mechanism of this region in the viral fusion process. Here we report that anti-LLP1–2 and anti-LLP2 antibodies (IgG) inhibited HIV-1 Env-mediated cell fusion and bound to the interface between effector and target cells at a suboptimal temperature (31.5 °C), which slows down the fusion process and prolongs the fusion intermediate state. This suggests that LLP1–2, especially the LLP2 region located inside the viral membrane, is transiently exposed on the membrane surface during the fusion process. Synthetic LLP2 peptide could bind to the gp41 six-helix bundle core with high binding affinity. These results suggest that the gp41 CT may interact with the gp41 core, via the surface-exposed LLP2 domain, to regulate Env-mediated membrane fusion. It is generally agreed that the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 4The abbreviations used are: HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; HIV-1, HIV type 1; CT, cytoplasmic tail; NHR, N-terminal heptad repeat; CHR, C-terminal heptad repeat; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; TBS, Tris buffered solution; GMEM, glutamine-deficient minimal essential medium; 6-HB, six-helix bundle; mAb, monoclonal antibody; aa, amino acid. 4The abbreviations used are: HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; HIV-1, HIV type 1; CT, cytoplasmic tail; NHR, N-terminal heptad repeat; CHR, C-terminal heptad repeat; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; TBS, Tris buffered solution; GMEM, glutamine-deficient minimal essential medium; 6-HB, six-helix bundle; mAb, monoclonal antibody; aa, amino acid. envelope glycoprotein (Env) transmembrane subunit gp41 plays an essential role during viral infection by mediating membrane fusion. Based on the crystal structure of the gp41 core, Chan et al. (1Chan D.C. Fass D. Berger J.M. Kim P.S.

Cell. 1998; 93: 681-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar) have proposed a membrane fusion model for HIV-1 entry. In this model, the Env surface subunit gp120 binds to both CD4 and the chemokine receptor (CCR5 or CXCR4) on the target cells to trigger a conformational change of gp41, i.e. association between its N- and C-terminal heptad repeats (NHR and CHR, respectively) to form a six-helix bundle (6-HB), which is thought to bring the membranes of both virus and target cells into close proximity for facilitating membrane fusion (1Chan D.C.

However, the events following 6-HB formation prior to completion of the fusion process are unclear, and the regulation of the fusion process remains to be elucidated. By using suboptimal temperature (31.5 °C) to slow down the fusion process, Golding et al. (7Golding H. Zaitseva M. de Rosny E. King L.R. Manischewitz J. Sidorov I. Gorny M.K. Zolla-Pazner S. Dimitrov D.S. Weiss C.D. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 6780-6790Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) have shown that the anti-bundle specific antibodies could bind to the 6-HB located between effector and target cells and block virus-cell and cell-cell fusion. These results suggest that 6-HBs are formed prior to membrane fusion, and after drawing the viral and target cell membranes together, they may perform additional functions in the late stage of membrane fusion. Meanwhile, apart from the important documented roles of the NHR, CHR, and the 6-HB in fusion reactivity, completion of the entire fusion process may also require the involvement of other regions in gp41, such as the membrane-spanning domain (aa 666–682 of the HXB2 strain of HIV-1) and the gp41 cytoplasmic tail (CT) (8Dimitrov A.S.

Virol. 2005; 79: 12231-12241Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). As members of the lentiviruses, HIV-1, HIV-2, and simian immunodeficiency virus have a relatively long cytoplasmic tail (CT) (∼150 amino acids), compared with other retroviruses with cytoplasmic domains consisting of only 20–30 amino acids (9Hunter E. Swanstrom R. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1990; 157: 187-253PubMed Google Scholar). The HIV-1 gp41 CT consists of the “Kennedy” polypeptide sequence (aa 731–752) and the lentivirus lytic peptide (LLP1–2, aa 773–862), which contains three highly conserved α-helix domains as follows: LLP1 (aa 833–862), LLP2 (aa 773–793), and LLP3 (aa785–807) (11Miller M.A. Garry R.F. Jaynes J.M. Montelaro R.C. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1991; 7: 511-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The HIV-1 gp41 CT has many functions, including interaction with the plasma membrane, decrease of bilayer stability, alteration of membrane ionic permeability, and mediation of cell killing (10Wyss S.

Recent studies have shown that the gp41 CTs of HIV and simian immunodeficiency virus correlate with their infectivity and Env-mediated cell-cell fusion (10Wyss S. Dimitrov A.S. Baribaud F.

Virol. 2003; 77: 3634-3646Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The mutations or truncations of gp41 CT can affect HIV-1 Env-mediated cell-cell fusion, presumably because of modulation of the fusogenicity of Env (17Edwards T.G. Wyss S. Reeves J.D. Zolla-Pazner S. Hoxie J.A. Doms R.W. Baribaud F. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 2683-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 18Zingler K. Littman D.R. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2824-2831Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Kalia et al. (15Kalia V. Sarkar S. Gupta P. Montelaro R.C. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 3634-3646Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) discovered that one Env having a mutation in the gp41 CT LLP2 region (MX2) exhibited a decrease of about 90% in fusogenicity compared with the wild-type Env and that the mutation did not correspond to apparent defects in the levels of cell surface Env expression. However, in some other studies, certain point mutations and particularly truncations of gp41 CT were shown to induce faster fusion kinetics (19Abrahamyan L.G. Mkrtchyan S.R. Binley J. Lu M.

Virol. 2005; 79: 12231-12241Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) have also demonstrated that the gp41 CT LLP2 domain restricted Env fusogenicity during Env processing, as did the murine leukemia viruses, where cleavage of a membrane-interactive R peptide at the C terminus is required for Env to become fusogenic. Although the combined data imply that gp41 CT could affect cell-cell fusion, this mechanism also remains vague and controversial. Therefore, further study of the characteristics of gp41 CT is warranted, especially that of its added effect on Env-mediated fusion reactivity. It is generally believed that the entire gp41 CT is located inside the cell. However, existing experimental and computational evidence suggest that the Kennedy sequence might lie outside the cell, because the antibodies against the Kennedy sequence can bind to virus-infected cells and neutralize HIV-1 infectivity (23Cleveland S.M. McLain L. Cheung L. Jones T.D. Hollier M. Dimmock N.J. J. Gen. Virol. 2003; 84: 591-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 24Kennedy R.C. Henkel R.D. Pauletti D. Allan J.S. Lee T.H. Essex M. Dreesman G.R. Science. 1986; 231: 1556-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Our study focuses on the gp41 CT LLP1–2 region, especially the LLP1 and LLP2 regions that have been directly proven to be associated with the membrane fusion process (10Wyss S. Dimitrov A.S. Baribaud F. Edwards T.G. Blumenthal R. Hoxie J.A. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 12231-12241Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 15Kalia V. Sarkar S. Gupta P. Montelaro R.C. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 3634-3646Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and aims to determine whether LLP1–2 directly or indirectly participates in the fusion reaction and, if so, to understand the underlying mechanism(s) of this event. Here we report, for the first time, that during the HIV-1 fusion process, the LLP1–2 region of gp41 CT, in particular the LLP2 domain, may be transiently exposed on the surface of the effector cell in the presence of the target cell. Synthetic peptide derived from the LLP2 sequence could interact with the gp41 6-HB core. These results suggest that gp41 CT may regulate the fusogenicity of viral Env through the interaction of the transiently exposed LLP2 region with the gp41 core on virions or HIV-1-infected cells. Cell Lines and Animals—3T3 cells stably expressing CD4 and CXCR4 (3T3-T4-CXCR4) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 IU/ml of penicillin and streptomycin. CHO cells stably transfected with HIV-1 (HXB2) Env expressing vector pEE 14 (designated CHO-WT) or control pEE 14 vector (designated CHO-EE) were cultured in glutamine-deficient minimal essential medium (GMEM-S) containing 400 μm methionine sulfoximine (Sigma). Expression and Purification of gp41 CT Fragments—The gp41 CT fragments LLP1–2, LLP1, and LLP2 (Fig. 1) were expressed in Escherichia coli using the plasmids pGEX-6p-1-LLP1–2, pGEX-6p-1-LLP1, and pGEX-6p-1-LLP2, respectively, as described previously (25Zhu Y. Lu L. Chao L. Chen Y.H. Chem. Biol. Drug Des. 2007; 70: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The polypeptide N36-L8-C34, its mutants, and 3NC were constructed and expressed as described previously (26Huang J.H. Liu Z.Q. Liu S. Jiang S. Chen Y.H. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 4807-4814Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 27Qiao Z.S. Kim M. Reinhold B. Montefiori D. Wang J.H. Reinherz E.L. J. Biol.

Science. 2001; 291: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), and further purified by anion-exchange Q column (GE Healthcare). Peptide LLP2 was synthesized by a standard solid phase Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) method and purified to homogeneity (>95% purity) by high pressure liquid chromatography. Production and Detection of Anti-gp41 CT Polyclonal Antibodies—New Zealand White rabbits (1.7–1.9 kg) were immunized subcutaneously with a dose of 100 μg of purified recombinant protein LLP1–2 or peptide LLP2 in complete Freund's adjuvant and boosted three times at 2-week intervals with an identical dose of LLP1–2 or LLP2 in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Rabbit antisera were collected, and the anti-LLP1–2 and anti-LLP2 IgG were purified with protein G affinity column (GE Healthcare), from which LLP1–2-, LLP1-, and LLP2-specific IgG were further isolated using N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated Sepharose 4 Fast Flow beads (GE Healthcare) conjugated with the corresponding proteins or peptides, respectively. The flow-through fractions were also collected as controls. Antibody concentrations were established by spectrophotometry. HIV-1 Env-mediated Cell-Cell Fusion Assay—Wells of a 96-well plate were coated with 1 × 106 3T3 cells stably expressing CD4 and CXCR4 (3T3-T4-CXCR4) and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Simultaneously, CHO-WT cells were pre-stimulated with 7 mm sodium butyrate for about 20 h and then 2×104 cells per well were added in the absence or presence of anti-gp41 CT-specific IgG or normal rabbit IgG. After coculturing for 6 h at 5% CO2, 31.5 °C, the plate was gently transferred to a 5% CO2, 37 °C environment. After a further 9–16 h, syncytia were counted under a microscope. The percentage of inhibition of syncytium formation was calculated using the following formula: % inhibition = (1 - (number of syncytia in a well containing an inhibitor)/number of syncytia in a well containing no inhibitor) × 100. Flow Cytometry Assay—CHO-WT cells or a mixture of CHO-WT cells and 3T3-T4-CXCR4 cells (1 × 105) were incubated with anti-gp41 CT-specific IgG or normal rabbit IgG in a 50-μl final volume at 31.5 °C for 2 h in GMEM containing 2% goat serum. Then the mixtures were transferred onto ice for 1 h. After thorough washing with TBS and 2% goat serum (pH 7.4), cells were incubated with FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Dako, 1:40 dilution in TBS with 2% goat serum) for 1 h on ice. Finally, the mixtures were washed three times using 200 μl of TBS with 2% goat serum and subsequently analyzed in a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) with CellQuest™ software (BD Biosciences). Immunofluorescence—To observe binding of LLP1–2- and LLP2-specific IgG to fusion intermediates, Env-expressing CHO-WT and 3T3-T4-CXCR4 cells, respectively, were blocked with blocking buffer (2% normal goat serum in TBS) for 30 min at 31.5 °C, followed by incubation with rabbit LLP1–2-specific IgG, LLP2-specific IgG, or normal rabbit IgG (50 μg/ml) for 2 h at 31.5 °C in GMEM containing 2% goat serum. Then the cells were immediately placed on ice for 1 h. After the cells were harvested, they were washed twice with ice-cold blocking buffer and incubated with FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Dako, 1:40 dilution in TBS with 2% goat serum). Finally, the cells were washed again, fixed, applied to poly-l-lysine-coated glass slides, mounted, and observed under the confocal microscope. Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)—To determine the specific antibody binding to the gp41 CT fragments, ELISA was carried out as described previously (29Jiang S. Lin K. Zhang L. Debnath A.K. J. Virol. Methods. 1999; 80: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Briefly, the respective recombinant proteins and peptides (50 μg/ml) dissolved in 0.1 m Tris (pH 8.8) were used to coat 96-well polystyrene plates, which were then blocked with Tris-buffered solution (pH 8.5) containing 0.25% gelatin and 0.1% Tween 20. After three washes with TBS (pH 7.4) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T), the respective IgGs were added to the wells at the indicated concentrations. Then swine-anti-rabbit IgG and the substrate o-phenylenediamine were added sequentially. The absorbance at 450 nm (A450) was recorded with an ELISA reader. Each sample was tested in triplicate. Binding of the mAb NC-1 and the recombinant LLP1–2 and LLP2, respectively, to the peptides N36, C34, or the 6-HB modeled by N36/C34, N36-L8-C34, 3NC, and N36-L8-C34 mutants, was determined as described previously (30Huang J.H. Yang H.W. Liu S. Li J. Jiang S. Chen Y.H. Biochem. J. 2007; 403: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Briefly, 96-well polystyrene plates were coated with 100 μl of LLP1–2 (20 μg/ml), LLP2 (20 μg/ml), NC-1 (2 μg/ml), or 0.25% gelatin (as a negative control), respectively, and blocked with TBS (pH 8.5) containing 0.25% gelatin and 0.1% Tween 20. After three washes, the N36/C34 mixture, the isolated N36 or C34 peptide (5 μg/ml for each peptide) (Fig. 5A, panel a), recombinant N36-L8-C34 and 3NC at indicated concentrations (Fig. 5A, panel b), and N36-L8-C34 mutants (5 μg/ml) (Fig. 7A) were added, respectively. After incubation at 37 °C for 45 min, rabbit anti-N36/C34 IgG, which can recognize both the individual peptides N36 and C34 and 6-HBs, peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and substrate o-phenylenediamine were added sequentially. Absorbance (A450) values were recorded. The relative binding activity (%) of the N36-L8-C34 (NC) mutants to LLP2 peptide was calculated on the basis that the binding activity of the wild-type N36-L8-C34 (NC WT) to LLP2 peptide equals 100% (Fig. 7A).FIGURE 7A, relative binding activity of 6-HBs formed by N36-L8-C34 (NC) and its mutants to the synthetic peptide LLP2. Each mutant of 6-HB bears a single Ala or Val substitution at the b, c, and f positions of the helix wheels of the N- and C-helices in 6-HB. The binding activity was detected by ELISA. The data represent triplicate determinations that were performed at least three times. All results are presented as mean ± S.D. B, schematic shows the potential binding sites of LLP2 in gp41 6-HB.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) Assay—The kinetics of the binding affinity of the gp41 CT LLP1–2 and LLP2 to gp41 core modeled by recombinant protein 3NC was determined by SPR using the Biacore system (GE Healthcare) according to the biomolecular interaction analysis (BIA) technology manual. In brief, the CM5 sensor chip was immobilized with 3NC (100 μg/ml) by amine coupling, and the unreacted sites were blocked with ethanolamine. The association reaction was initiated by injecting 40 μl of polypeptide LLP1–2 or LLP2 in HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) with 0.05% Triton X-100 at a flow rate of 20 μl/min. The dissociation reaction was done by washing with running buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) containing 0.15 m NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA and 0.005% v/v surfactant P20). At the end of the cycle, the sensor chip surface was regenerated with 10 mm HCl for 30 s. The association (Kon) and dissociation (Koff) rate constants were estimated from the response curve, and the dissociation equilibrium constant (Kd) was calculated using the following equation: Kd = Koff/Kon, as described previously (31Huang J.H. Lu L. Lu H. Chen X. Jiang S. Chen Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6143-6152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Isolation and Characterization of Antibodies Specific for the gp41 CT Fragments LLP1–2, LLP1, and LLP2—The gp41 CT fragment LLP1–2, expressed in E. coli using the plasmids pGEX-6p-1, and the synthetic peptide LLP2 were used for immunization of rabbits. Anti-LLP1–2 and anti-LLP2 IgG, respectively, were purified from the rabbit antisera with protein G affinity column (GE Healthcare). Then LLP1–2-, LLP1-, and LLP2-specific IgG were isolated from anti-LLP1–2 and anti-LLP2 IgG using the GST-LLP1–2-, GST-LLP1-, and GST-LLP2-bound N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated Sepharose (4 Fast Flow, GE Healthcare), respectively. The flow-through fractions from LLP1–2- and LLP2-bound Sepharose 4 were collected as LLP1–2-specific IgG-depleted anti-LLP1–2 IgG (designated anti-LLP1–2 IgG/LLP1–2) and LLP2-specific IgG-depleted anti-LLP1–2 IgG (designated anti-LLP1–2 IgG/LLP2), respectively. The binding specificity of the IgG obtained was determined by ELISA. As shown in Fig. 2A, LLP1–2-specific IgG bound with LLP1–2, GST-LLP1, and GST-LLP2. LLP1-specific IgG reacted with both LLP1–2 and GST-LLP1 but did not interact with GST-LLP2, whereas LLP2-specific IgG bound to both LLP1–2 and GST-LLP2 but did not recognize GST-LLP1. These results verify the specificity of the antibodies directed against the corresponding gp41 CT fragments. No LLP1–2- and LLP2-specific IgGs were detected in the flow-through fractions from the Sepharose 4B columns conjugated with LLP1–2 (anti-LLP1–2 IgG/LLP1–2) and LLP2 (anti-LLP1–2 IgG/LLP2), respectively, suggesting that the corresponding IgGs were depleted from the anti-LLP1–2 IgG fraction. Interestingly, LLP2-specific IgG predominated over the LLP1-specific IgG in the anti-LLP1–2 IgG (data not shown). In the next step, the LLP1–2- and LLP2-specific antibodies were used for detecting the potential interaction of the gp41 CT fragments with the peptides derived from the gp41 NHR or CHR or 6-HB. To exclude the possibility of the anti-gp41 CT antibodies binding nonspecifically to the extracellular domain of gp41, an ELISA was performed. As shown in Fig. 2B, anti-LLP1–2 and anti-LLP2 IgGs only recognize LLP1–2 and LLP2 but did not react with the rsgp41, nor with the peptides N36 and C34 as well as the 6-HB formed by N36/C34, confirming that anti-gp41 CT antibodies do not cross-react with the gp41 ectodomain. Binding of Anti-gp41 CT Antibodies to the Effector Cells in the Presence of Target Cells at Suboptimal Temperature—It was reported previously that the main part of the gp41 CT, i.e. the LLP1–2 region, is hidden within the HIV-1 virion (32Wyma D.J. Kotov A. Aiken C. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 9381-9387Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and cannot be recognized by the antibodies specific for the gp41 CT sequences (aa 799–817 and 844–863) (23Cleveland S.M. McLain L. Cheung L. Jones T.D. Hollier M. Dimmock N.J. J. Gen. Virol. 2003; 84: 591-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, we believe that part of the gp41 LLP1–2 region may be exposed on the cell surface during the membrane fusion process, interacting with the extracellular domain of gp41, thus regulating viral fusogenicity via the “insideout” signaling pathway. To determine the potential exposure of gp41 CT fragments, flow cytometry assay was performed to detect the binding of LLP1–2-, LLP1-, and LLP2-specific IgG to the effector (E) cells that express HIV-1 Env (CHO-WT cells) in the absence or presence of the target (T) cells, which express CD4 and the coreceptor CXCR4 (3T3-T4-CXCR4 cells), at a physiological temperature (37 °C) or a suboptimal temperature (31.5 °C). The results show that LLP1–2-specific IgG did not bind to effector cells in the absence of target cells at 37 °C (data not shown) nor at 31.5 °C (Fig. 3A, panel a). This antibody was also unable to bind to effector cells in the presence of target cells at 37 °C (Fig. 3A, panel b). However, both LLP1–2- and LLP2-specific IgG bound significantly with the effector cells in the presence of target cells at 31.5 °C (Fig. 3A, panel c). In contrast, the LLP1-specific IgG and the LLP2-specific IgG-depleted anti-LLP1–2 IgG (anti-LLP-12 IgG/LLP2) were incapable of binding to effector cells under the same conditions (Fig. 3A, panel c). These results suggest that the LLP2, and not the LLP1 domain in the gp41 CT LLP1–2 region, may be exposed on the surface of the effector cell when it interacts with the target cell for cell-to-cell fusion, resulting in binding of the anti-LLP2 antibody to the effector cell. However, this binding is only detectable when the effector cell interacts with the target cell at suboptimal temperature, which can prolong the fusion intermediate state. Otherwise, the antibody (IgG) may not have access to the narrow space of the interface between the effector and target cell during the conventional fusion process at physiological temperatures. This assumption is further supported by results from confocal microscopy analysis. At suboptimal temperature, normal rabbit IgG could not bind to effector cells in the presence of target cells (Fig. 3B, panel a). However, both LLP1–2-specific IgG (Fig. 3B, panel b) and LLP2-specific IgG (Fig. 3B, panel c) bound significantly to the interfaces of the effector/target cells. None of these antibodies bound to effector cells in the absence of target cells at either 37 or 31.5 °C, nor in the presence of target cells at 37 °C (data not shown). Inhibition of Env-mediated Cell Fusion by Anti-gp41 CT Antibodies at Suboptimal Temperature—We further hypothesized that during the membrane fusion process, the gp41 CT LLP2 domain may be transiently exposed on the surface of effector cells at a suboptimal temperature to interact with the extracellular domain for regulating viral fusogenicity. Binding of the anti-LLP2 antibodies to the exposed LLP2 domain may affect the membrane fusion process. Therefore, the inhibitory activity of antibodies against gp41 CT fragments on Env-mediated cell-to-cell fusion at physiological and suboptimal temperatures was determined by using a syncytium formation assay. As shown in Fig. 4A, both LLP1–2- and LLP2-specific IgG showed potent inhibitory activity against Env-mediated syncytium formation when effector and target cells were cocultured at a suboptimal temperature (31.5 °C), whereas normal rabbit IgG, LLP1-specific IgG, and the LLP2-specific IgG-depleted anti-LLP1–2 IgG (anti-LLP-1–2 IgG/LLP2) exhibited no significant inhibition of cell-cell fusion. However, none of the anti-gp41 CT antibodies could inhibit Env-mediated syncytium formation when effector and target cells were cocultured at 37 °C (Fig. 4B). This result suggests that the LLP1–2- and LLP2-specific IgG may bind to the LLP2 domain, which is transiently exposed on the effector cell surface during the interaction between effector and target cells, thereby interfering with gp41 CT-mediated cell-cell fusion. Similarly, the antibodies may not be able to access the E/T interface during interaction of effector cell with target cell at physiological temperatures, resulting in lack of cell-cell fusion inhibition. Interaction of LLP1–2 and LLP2 with gp41 6-HB Core—The next logical question is which molecule LLP1–2 or LLP2 will interact with after its surface exposure. We hypothesized that LLP1–2 or LLP2 may affect the HIV-1 Env-mediated membrane fusion by interacting with either the gp41 NHR or CHR region at an earlier stage or with the gp41 6-HB core at the later stage of cell-cell fusion. We thus tested whether LLP1–2 could bind to NHR-peptide N36, or CHR-peptide C34, or 6-HB core modeled by N36/C34. Surprisingly, recombinant protein LLP1–2 and synthetic peptide LLP2 strongly bound to the 6-HB core formed by the N36/C34 mixture, but exhibited no significant binding to the individual N36 and C34 peptides (Fig. 5A). To confirm binding between LLP2 (or LLP1–2) and the 6-HB core, we expressed and purified the polypeptides N36-L8-C34 (26Huang J.H. Liu Z.Q. Liu S. Jiang S. Chen Y.H. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 4807-4814Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and 3NC, which can automatically form 6-HBs in physiological solution (27Qiao Z.S. Kim M. Reinhold B. Montefiori D.

Science. 2001; 291: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5A, panel b, both the recombinant protein LLP1–2 and peptide LLP2 strongly bound to N36-L8-C34 and 3NC in a dose-dependent manner. In the real time SPR spectrum assay, similar results were obtained, i.e. both LLP1–2 (Fig. 5B, panel a) and LLP2 (Fig. 5B, panel b) bound to 3NC in a dose-dependent manner with high binding affinity. However, the data did not fit the 1:1 Langmuir binding and other existing models, which may be attributed to the fact that N36-L8-C34 and 3NC form typical 6-HBs in physiological solution (26Huang J.H.

https://openalex.org/W2051893623,"SATB1 (special AT-rich sequence-binding protein-1) provides a key link between DNA loop organization, chromatin modification/remodeling, and association of transcription factors at matrix attachment regions (MARs). To investigate the role of SATB1 in cellular events, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen that identified SUMO-1, Ubc9, and protein inhibitor of activated STAT (PIAS) family members as SATB1 interaction partners. These proteins, working in concert, enhanced SUMO conjugation to lysine-744 of SATB1. Overexpression of SUMO or PIAS in Jurkat cells, which express high levels of endogenous SATB1, exhibited enhanced caspase cleavage of this MAR-associating protein. Sumoylation-deficient SATB1 (SATB1(K744R)) failed to display the characteristic caspase cleavage pattern; however, fusion of SUMO in-frame to SATB1(K744R) restored cleavage. A SUMO-independent interaction of inactive caspase-6 and SATB1 was noted. A subset of total cellular SATB1 localized into promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies where enhanced SATB1 cleavage was detected subsequent to caspase activation. These results reveal a novel sumoylation-directed caspase cleavage of this key regulatory molecule. The role of regulated proteolysis of SATB1 may be to control transcription in immune cells during normal cell functions or to assist in efficient and rapid clearance of nonfunctional or potentially damaging immune cells.

The MAR-binding protein, SATB1 (1Gohring F. Schwab B.L. Nicotera P. Leist M. Fackelmayer F.O. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7361-7371Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), associates at these elements and regulates gene transcription indirectly by regulating chromatin loop organization and functioning as a “platform” for the aggregation of chromatin-remodeling proteins (2Shannon M.F. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 4-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). SATB1, for example, organizes the interleukin gene cluster (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13) in CD4+ T helper 2 cells of mouse, into several small chromatin loops connected at their bases by SATB1 (3Cai S. Lee C.C. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 1278-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). In addition, a number of transcription factors including the chromatin-remodeling enzyme Brg1, T helper 2-specific factors (GATA3, STAT6, and c-Maf), and RNA polymerase II, all bind across the 200-kb IL region (3Cai S. Lee C.C. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 1278-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar).SATB1-null mice suggest a role for this key regulatory protein in T-cell development. SATB1-null mice fail to thrive, have small spleens and thymi, and exhibit multiple defects in T-cell development (4Alvarez J.D. Yasui D.H. Niida H. Joh T. Loh D.Y. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 521-535PubMed Google Scholar). Dysregulated expression (mostly repression) is observed for up to 10% of the genes in T-cells (4Alvarez J.D. Yasui D.H. Niida H. Joh T. Loh D.Y. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 521-535PubMed Google Scholar, 5Pavan Kumar P. Purbey P.K. Sinha C.K. Notani D. Limaye A. Jayani R.S. Galande S. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 231-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). SATB1 regulates transcription of genes that directly impact cellular proliferation, T-cell function, and apoptosis (RIP, PD-1, TDAG51, the cytokine receptors IL-7Rα and IL-2Rα, and proto-oncogenes) (4Alvarez J.D. Yasui D.H. Niida H. Joh T. Loh D.Y. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 521-535PubMed Google Scholar, 6Pavan Kumar P.P. Bischof O. Purbey P.K. Notani D. Urlaub H. Dejean A. Galande S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). T-cell development is dictated by active signaling processes and by a more passive apoptotic death in which up to 99% of cells are eventually eliminated because of nonproductive receptor gene rearrangements and, additionally, via negative selection for potentially damaging autoimmune receptors. During specific phases of T-cell development, caspases play a role in cell survival and proliferation independent of their role in apoptosis (7Lamkanfi M. Festjens N. Declercq W. Vanden Berghe T. Vandenabeele P. Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 44-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 8Siegel R.M. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 6: 308-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Because of its known roles in T-cell development and global regulation of gene expression, SATB1 likely contributes to these apoptosis-dependent and -independent processes. SATB1 is specifically cleaved by caspase-6 after the consensus sequence VEMD (at amino acid 254) into ∼70- and 30-kDa fragments (9Galande S. Dickinson L.A. Mian I.S. Sikorska M. Kohwi-Shigematsu T.

Cancer Biol. Ther. 2002; 1: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Unlike ubiquitination, which can target proteins for degradation by the 26 S proteasome, SUMO modifications mostly regulate protein targeting and protein-protein complex formation. It has been shown that SUMO modification targets proteins to promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (17Duprez E. Saurin A.J. Desterro J.M. Lallemand-Breitenbach V. Howe K. Boddy M.N. Solomon E. de The H. Hay R.T. Freemont P.S. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 381-393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or the nuclear pore complex (18Matunis M.J. Coutavas E. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1457-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar, 19Mahajan R. Delphin C. Guan T. Gerace L. Melchior F.

Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). In a few cases, SUMO-1 conjugation occurs at the same lysine residues used for other post-translational modifications and thereby antagonizes the effects of these modifications (for example ubiquitination, which has a role in NF-κB activation (21Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 233-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar)). A series of sequential reactions catalyzed by three enzymes, AOS1/UBA2 (E1), Ubc9 (E2), and an E3 ligase, append SUMO to substrate molecules. One of the most widely studied E3s belongs to the protein inhibitor of activated STAT (PIAS) transcription factor family. Additionally, a family of genes encodes SUMO-specific isopeptidases, which facilitate the rapid removal of SUMO from modified proteins, thus revealing sumoylation as a dynamic process that has the potential for rapid on/off responses, very likely following cellular stimuli (12Johnson E.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 355-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar, 13Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 1-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar).Promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (PML NBs) are present in almost all mammalian cells. They are dynamic macromolecular structures that vary in size, number, and molecular content, dependent upon cellular stimuli. Sumoylation of the tumor suppressor protein PML is required for formation of these nuclear dots and for macromolecular aggregation of molecules within these structures. PML NBs contribute to a number of cellular processes including protein sequestration and release, post-translational modification, DNA repair, and apoptosis (22Hofmann T.G. Will H. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 1290-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 23Bernardi R. Pandolfi P.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 1006-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). Evidence of a role for PML NBs in apoptosis is provided by the observation that cells derived from Pml-null mice are defective in executing cell death by different stimuli (24Bernardi R. Pandolfi P.P. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 9048-9057Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 25Takahashi Y. Lallemand-Breitenbach V. Zhu J. de The H. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2819-2824Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). PML NBs also contribute to p53-dependent apoptotic pathways by sequestering MDM2, a negative regulator of p53, and by recruiting p53 to nuclear dots where its post-translational modification is promoted. Additional proteins with known roles in apoptosis also appear to function from within the PML NBs (22Hofmann T.G. Will H. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 1290-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 23Bernardi R. Pandolfi P.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 1006-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar).Much is still unknown regarding how key regulatory proteins are targeted for caspase cleavage during cell function. Subsequent to cleavage, it is not known what the consequences of loss of that protein will be on the progression of cells into either cell differentiation or committed apoptosis. In this report, we provide evidence that SATB1 is covalently modified by SUMO at a single SUMO consensus modification site, Lys-744. SUMO conjugation to SATB1 targets this protein into punctate nuclear dots. SATB1 undergoes caspase cleavage in these subnuclear structures. This study thus presents the first report of SUMO-mediated caspase cleavage of a key regulatory protein.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid Construction—SATB1 cDNA, encoding amino acids 58–763, was excised from pECH-SATB1 (26Dickinson L.A. Joh T. Kohwi Y. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Cell. 1992; 70: 631-645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar) and inserted inframe with the cDNA encoding the binding domain of the LexA protein in the vector pLexA (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.). Expression of the LexA-SATB1 fusion protein in yeast strain EGY48-[p8op-lacZ] was verified by Western blotting to SATB1 antibodies; this fusion protein did not autonomously activate the lacZ reporter gene in yeast (data not shown). Deletion constructs and specific site mutations of SATB1 were done using standard molecular biology techniques (27Cormack B. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman F.G. Struhl K. Smith J.A. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 4. John Wiley and Sons, Inc, New York1999: 1-4Google Scholar). SATB1 cDNA and deletions/mutations were subsequently inserted into pBluescript II KS (Stratagene), pEGFP-C1 (Clontech), or pcDNA3.1/His (Invitrogen) for additional studies. Full-length SATB1 was amplified by PCR and inserted into pEGFP-C1 as described (10Gotzmann J. Meissner M. Gerner C. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 425-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To express SUMO-1 or SUMO-3 at the C terminus of SATB1, the primer pair 5′-ACAGGAGCTCTGAGTATGGATCATTTGAAC-3′ and 5′-GTAGGATCCCAGTCTTTCAAATCAGTATTAATGTCTGTG-3′ was used to PCR amplify, from a Jurkat cDNA library, a full-length SATB1 lacking a C-terminal stop codon and incorporating a BamHI restriction enzyme site for subsequent in-frame insertion of the SUMO-1 or SUMO-3 cDNAs. SUMO was PCR-amplified from the Jurkat cDNA library as described (28Desterro J.M. Thomson J. Hay R.T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 29Tatham M.H. Jaffray E. Vaughan O.A. Desterro J.M. Botting C.H. Naismith J.H. Hay R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35368-35374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). SUMO-1 and SUMO-3 were also expressed from the pcDNA3.1/His vector.Yeast Two-hybrid Library Screen—Yeast two-hybrid library screening and verification of positive clones were done as described in the manufacturer's user's manual (Clontech Laboratories) and Yeast Protocols Handbook (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.). In brief, a Jurkat cDNA library (Clontech Laboratories), prepared in the vector pB42AD (4 × 106 individual cDNAs), was amplified 2-fold. Subsequently, the cDNAs were introduced into the yeast strain EGY48-[p8op-lacZ] that previously had been transfected with pLexA-SATB1-(58–763). Colonies that expressed Leu+, LacZ+ phenotypes were picked for further analysis. True positive clones were verified by independently screening expression of the two reporter genes, leu2 and lacZ (which have different promoters), to eliminate cDNAs that interacted only weakly or transiently. In a second assay, putative positives that indiscriminately interacted with a bait protein other than SATB1 (i.e. lamin C) or with the parental pLexA vector alone were eliminated. The remaining cDNAs were sequenced from their 5′-ends and identified using the Blast search engine (NCBI).In Vitro SUMO-1 Conjugation Assay—Recombinant SUMO E1 (Aos1/Uba2 heterodimer), GST-Ubc9, His-tagged PIAS1, GST-SUMO-1Δ4C, and His-tagged SUMO-3 were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by standard protocols. SATB1 (wild type, mutated, or deleted) were labeled with [35S]methionine in the TNT-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega) and used directly in the in vitro SUMO conjugation assay (30Song J. Durrin L.K. Wilkinson T.A. Krontiris T.G. Chen Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14373-14378Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Reactions were analyzed by denaturing SDS-PAGE. After fixing and staining, gels were dried and exposed to Kodak BioMax MR single emulsion x-ray film.Antibodies—SATB1 antibodies were prepared by injecting duplicate pairs of rabbits with recombinant SATB1-(58–763) (12–9) or with internal peptides of SATB1 (Ab 16-9, amino acid sequence KTATIATERNGKPEN, residues 475–489; Ab 13-9, amino acid sequence EDNGSPLGRGR LGST, residues 34–48) using standard protocols. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and anti-mouse IgG were from Zymed Laboratories Inc. Other antibodies used for this study are described in the appropriate sections below.Ni-NTA Pulldown Assays—Purification of His-rich proteins was performed essentially as described (31Rodriguez M.S. Desterro J.M. Lain S. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Hay R.T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6455-6461Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Washes were done with either 0 or 30 mm imidazole (low and high stringency, respectively). Bound proteins were released in high imidizole sample buffer, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to Immobilon-P transfer membrane (Millipore). After Western blotting to anti-SATB1, specific proteins were detected using enhanced chemiluminescent detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Membranes were exposed to Hyperfilm (Amersham Biosciences).Cell Culture and Apoptosis Induction—Jurkat cells (mature T-cells), Nalm-6 (pre-B-cells), NB4 (promyelocytic), K562 (hematopoietic), HeLa (cervical carcinoma), and MCF-7 (human breast cancer) (the latter three obtained from ATCC) were maintained under standard conditions in RPMI 1640 medium (Jurkat, Nalm-6, K562, NB4) or in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (HeLa, MCF-7) plus 10% FBS (Hyclone) and 100 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen). Cells were transfected with the plasmid constructs described above by standard methods: Electroporation for Jurkat, Nalm-6, K562, and NB4; lipid technologies (Effectene; Qiagen) for HeLa and MCF-7. After 24–48 h, cells were used to investigate the effects of caspase activation or for microscopic analyses (see below). Transfected suspension cells (Jurkat, Nalm-6, K562, NB4) were collected and washed once in RPMI media plus 1% FBS. Attached cells were washed on the plates with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 1% FBS. For cells that were inhibited with caspase-6, the inhibitor (20 μm; Calbiochem) was added 1 h prior to the addition of the inducer of apoptosis. Cellular apoptosis was induced (for times indicated in the legends for Figs. 1D, 3, 4, and 6) with either anti-Fas (100 ng/ml), camptothecin (CPT; 2 μm for all cells except K562, which required 20 μm), actinomycin D (10 μm), or etoposide (100 μm) in medium containing 1% FBS. After treatment, cells were collected and harvested directly into SDS gel loading buffer, boiled for 10 min, and loaded onto SDS-polyacrylamide gels. For MCF-7 and HeLa cells, both the floating and attached cells were combined. Proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes, and proteins of interest were detected by Western blot technologies using antibodies to SATB1, EGFP (Clontech), and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), caspases-3 or -6, or β-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).FIGURE 3Caspase cleavage of the MAR binding protein SATB1 is dependent upon the presence of an intact SUMO modification consensus site. A, Nalm-6 cells were suspended in RPMI 1640 medium plus 1% FBS, and caspase cleavage was induced with CPT for the times indicated above the panels. Cells were harvested into SDS-PAGE loading buffer, fractionated on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and prepared for immunoblotting (WB) to the antibodies indicated shown at the left of the panels. Relevant proteins and cleavage products are shown to the right of the panels. Protein sizes are indicated in kilodaltons. The asterisks denote nonspecific protein bands. B, either wild type (EGFP-SATB1Δ57) or mutated (EGFP-SATB1Δ57(K744R)) SATB1 was expressed transiently in Nalm-6 cells.

Cells were harvested into SDS-PAGE loading buffer, fractionated on 8 or 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gels, and prepared for Western blotting (WB) as indicated in the legend to Fig. 2.

Cells were harvested into SDS-PAGE buffer and prepared for immunoblotting as described in the legend to Fig. 2D. Proteins were immunoblotted to anti-SATB1 (12-9), top panel), anti-PARP (second panel), anti-caspase-6 (third panel), anti-caspase-3 (fourth panel), or anti-β-actin (bottom panel, loading control).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Microscopy—For confocal microscopic studies, cells were transiently transfected with EGFP-SATB1 constructs on chamber slides, fixed for 10 min with 5% paraformaldehyde, washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS. After further washing in PBS as above, cells were blocked in 5 drops of Image-iT (Invitrogen-Molecular Probes) for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were then stained for 1 h at room temperature with rabbit-derived primary anti-PML (300 μl of 1 μg/ml anti-PML diluted in 3% bovine serum albumin-PBS; sc-966, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Following three, 5-min washes in 3% bovine serum albumin-PBS, the secondary antibody, Alexa Fluor 594 rabbit anti-mouse IgG, was used as described by the supplier (Invitrogen-Molecular Probes). Fluorescence signals were analyzed on a Zeiss Microimaging GmBH LSM 510 Meta (upright confocal microscope) equipped with a Zeiss C-Apochromat 63×/1.2 W corr objective. Laser excitation was 488 nm from an argon laser, 4% power for green fluorescence, and 543 nm from HeNe laser, 100% power for red fluorescence.RESULTSIdentification of SATB1-interacting Partners—SATB1 is important for assembling various nuclear factors and for the organization and regulation of region-specific chromatin structure at MAR elements (32Cai S.

To better understand the role of SATB1 in cellular function, yeast two-hybrid screening of a Jurkat cDNA library identified a number of proteins with known roles in SUMO modification. SUMO-1 was encoded by almost one-third of the cDNA isolates. Additional cDNAs encoded conjugating (E2) and ligating (E3) enzymes for SUMO (ubc9, PIAS1, PIAS3, PIASy, Pc2, and Topors (28Desterro J.M.

Because of the importance of SUMO-1 modification in cellular processes, we have undertaken an investigation of the significance of this post-translational process for SATB1 function.SUMO-1 and PIAS1 Display Caspase Activity in Jurkat T-cells—To examine the effect of SUMO-1 on cell function, EGFP-SUMO-1 was transiently overexpressed in Jurkat cells (mature T-cell line that expresses high levels of endogenous SATB1) for 24, 48, or 72 h, and then cells were harvested directly into SDS-PAGE loading buffer and prepared for Western blot analysis. In control cells, SATB1 was detected as a 103-kDa band by immunoblotting to anti-SATB1 (Fig. 1A, top panel, 0 h). A faster migrating band, in Jurkat cells overexpressing EGFP-SUMO-1, was detected at 70 kDa. Previously it had been demonstrated that SATB1 is cleaved by caspases during apoptotic stimulation in mouse thymocytes, Jurkat cells, and promyelocytic HL-60 cells, yielding ∼70- and 30-kDa fragments (9Galande S.

https://openalex.org/W1975837044,"Histone deacetylases (HDACs) catalyze the removal of acetyl groups from histones and contribute to transcriptional repression. In addition, the HDAC inhibitors induce apoptosis in cancer cells through alterations in histone acetylation and activation of the tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) apoptotic pathway. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a growth factor that promotes survival of cancer cells through activation of G protein-coupled receptors. Here we show that HDAC inhibitors can induce apoptosis through activation of the TRAIL apoptotic pathway, and LPA prevented HDAC inhibitor-induced apoptosis and increased TRAIL receptor DR4 (death receptor 4) protein expression. This was associated with increased HDAC1 recruitment to the DR4 promoter following LPA treatment and a reduction in HDAC inhibitor-induced histone acetylation in the DR4 promoter. In addition, LPA induces HDAC enzyme activity in a dose- and time-dependent manner, and this is associated with HDAC1 activation and increased binding of HDAC1 to HDAC2. Reducing the expression of HDAC1 significantly lowered LPA-induced HDAC activity and increased histone acetylation. LPA induction of HDAC activity was blocked by the LPA receptor antagonist, Ki16425, or by inhibiting receptor activation with pertussis toxin. Reducing the expression of the LPA receptor LPA1 also blocked LPA-induced HDAC activation. In addition, LPA reduced histone acetyltransferase enzymatic activity. Finally, LPA attenuated the ability of the HDAC inhibitor to reduce HDAC activity. Thus, LPA enhances survival of cancer cells by increasing HDAC activity and reducing histone acetylation.

Transcription in eukaryotic cells is influenced by the chromatin structure within which DNA is tightly packaged (1Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6530) Google Scholar). The nucleosome is the basic unit of chromatin and consists of 146 bp of DNA wrapped around a histone octamer. The histone tail domains are subjected to post-transcriptional modifications, such as acetylation, phosphorylation, methylation, and ubiquitination (2Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6830) Google Scholar, 3Luger K. Richmond T.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 140-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Compared with methylation and phosphorylation, the acetylation of core histones is probably the best understood type of modification (4Gray S.G. The B.T. Curr. Mol. Med. 2001; 1: 401-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 5Gregory P.D. Wagner K. Horz W. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 265: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Acetylation of histone tails correlates with transcriptional activity in many genes, allowing DNA to unfold and providing access for transcription factors to bind to their targeted promoters. The turn-over of acetylated histones is regulated by the opposing activities of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) 2The abbreviations used are: HAT, histone acetyltransferase; CLL, chronic lymphocytic leukemia; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; HDAC, histone deacetylase; TRAIL, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; PTX, pertussis toxin; VPA, valproic acid; TSA, trichostatin; 7-AAD, 7-aminoactinomycin D; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HDI, HDAC inhibitor; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; DR, death receptor; siRNA, small interfering RNA; AU, arbitrary unit. 2The abbreviations used are: HAT, histone acetyltransferase; CLL, chronic lymphocytic leukemia; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; HDAC, histone deacetylase; TRAIL, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; PTX, pertussis toxin; VPA, valproic acid; TSA, trichostatin; 7-AAD, 7-aminoactinomycin D; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HDI, HDAC inhibitor; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; DR, death receptor; siRNA, small interfering RNA; AU, arbitrary unit. and histone deacetylases (HDACs), where HATs generally allow transcription and HDACs repress transcription (4Gray S.G. The B.T. Curr. Mol. Med. 2001; 1: 401-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 5Gregory P.D. Wagner K. Horz W. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 265: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). In cancer, deregulation of HAT or HDAC activity often occurs (6Mahlknecht U. Hoelzer D. Mol. Med. 2000; 6: 623-644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Timmermann S.H. Lehrmann A. Harel-Bellan A. Cell.

Based on sequence similarities, HDACs are divided into three functional classes as follows: class I (HDAC1, -2, -3, and -8), class II (HDAC4-7, -9, and -10), and class III (HDAC11) (9de Ruijter A.J. van Gennip A.H. Caron H.N. Kemp S. van Kuilenburg A.B. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 737-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (2432) Google Scholar). The class I enzyme, HDAC1, belongs to a family of highly conserved enzymes and was the first protein shown to have histone deacetylating activity in mammals (10Spiegelberg B.D. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41769-41776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). HDAC1 is a nuclear protein and can heterodimerize with the closely related deacetylase HDAC2 (11Hassig C.A. Tong J.K. Fleischer T.C. Owa T. Grable P.G. Ayer D.E. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 351-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 14Grozinger C.M. Schreiber S.L. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 3-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). HDAC1 can repress gene transcription either directly or as part of these multiprotein complexes when recruited by a variety of transcriptional regulators, including SP1/SP3, nuclear receptors, the pocket proteins pRB, p107, and p130, and the tumor suppressor p53 (15Cress W.D. Seto E. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 184: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 16Ng H.H. Bird A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 121-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). HDAC inhibitors (HDIs) preferentially induce apoptosis in cancer cells through activation of both the death receptor and the mitochondrial apoptotic signaling pathways (17Richon V.M. O'Brien O.P. Clin. Cancer Res. 2002; 8: 662-664PubMed Google Scholar). In acute myeloid leukemia cells, HDIs induce the expression of death receptor (DR) 4, DR5, and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL); these changes all contribute to HDI-induced apoptosis (18Nebbioso A. Clarke N. Voltz E. Germain E. Ambrosino C. Bontempo P. Alvarez R. Schiavone E.M. Ferrara F. Bresciani F. Weisz A. de Lera A.R. Gronemeyer H. Altucci L. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Furthermore, HDIs sensitize cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, as a synergistic apoptotic response is seen when the cells are treated with a combination of an HDAC inhibitor and TRAIL (19Inoue S. MacFarlane M. Harper N. Wheat L.M. Dyer M.J. Cohen G.M. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: S193-S206Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 20Fulda S. Debatin K.M. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2005; 4: 1113-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), HDIs sensitize the leukemia cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis through activation of DR4 (21MacFarlane M. Inoue S. Kohlhaas S.L. Majid A. Harper N. Fennedy D.B. Dyer M.J. Cohen G.M. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 773-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). However, it has been unclear as to which HDAC is responsible for this effect, as the inhibitors used affect the catalytic activity of most class I and class II deacetylases (17Richon V.M. O'Brien O.P. Clin. Cancer Res. 2002; 8: 662-664PubMed Google Scholar, 22Marks P. Rifkind R.A. Richon V.M. Breslow R. Miller T. Kelly W.K. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 194-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (1681) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been shown in CLL cells that inhibition of class I but not class II HDACs sensitizes the cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis (23Inoue S. Mai A. Dyer M.J. Cohen G.M. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 6785-6792Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the individual roles of mammalian deacetylases in transcriptional control or the relevant target genes for HDIs. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA; monoacylglycerol 3-phosphate) is a naturally occurring soluble glycerophospholipid that was initially identified as an intermediate in a de novo lipid biosynthesis pathway (24Fang X. Schummer M. Mao M. Yu S. Tabassam F.H. Swaby R. Hasegawa Y. Tanyi J.L. LaPushin R. Eder A. Jaffe R. Erickson J. Mills G.B. Biochim. Biophys.

Effects of LPA include stimulation of cellular proliferation, platelet aggregation, smooth muscle cell contraction, and tumor cell invasion (26Mills G.B. Moolenaar W.H. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 582-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). In B cells, LPA acts as a growth factor increasing cell proliferation, intracellular calcium, and immunoglobulin formation (27Goetzl E.J. Lee H. Dolezalova H. Kalli K. Conover C.A. Hu Y.-L. Azuma T. Stossel T.P. Karliner J.S. Jaffe R.B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 905: 177-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). LPA binds to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) as follows: LPA1 (Edg-2), LPA2 (Edg-4), LPA3 (Edg-7), LPA4 (GPR23), and LPA5 (GPR92) (27Goetzl E.J. Lee H. Dolezalova H. Kalli K. Conover C.A. Hu Y.-L.

Chem. 2004; 279: 20555-20558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The LPA1 receptor is widely expressed, whereas LPA2 and LPA3 have more restricted expression patterns. The LPA4 and LPA5 receptors belong to the G2Y family of GPCRs, structurally distinct from the LPA1-3 receptors of the Edg family (28Anliker B. Chun J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20555-20558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 29Contos J.J. Fukushima N. Weiner J.A. Kaushal D. Chun J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2004; 279: 20555-20558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). LPA1 expression is increased in CLL and colon cancer cells, whereas LPA2 and LPA3 are elevated in ovarian cancer cells suggesting that LPA receptors are involved in tumorigenesis (30Fang X. Gaudette D. Furui T. Mao M. Estrella V. Eder A. Pustilnik T. Sasagawa T. Lapushin R. Yu S. Jaffe R.B. Wiener J.R. Erickson J.R. Mills G.B. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

In addition, elevated levels of LPA have been found in the ascites of ovarian cancer patients and in the bone marrow of multiple myeloma patients. This elevated level has been suggested to contribute to tumor invasiveness, proliferation, and resistance to apoptosis (24Fang X. Schummer M. Mao M. Yu S. Tabassam F.H. Swaby R. Hasegawa Y.

Lipids. 1999; 34: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). LPA protects ovarian cancer cells against chemotherapeutic drug-induced apoptosis and prevents apoptosis in serum-deprived renal proximal tubular cells, fibroblasts, and macrophages (30Fang X. Gaudette D. Furui T. Mao M. Estrella V. Eder A. Pustilnik T. Sasagawa T. Lapushin R. Yu S. Jaffe R.B. Wiener J.R. Erickson J.R. Mills G.B. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

In addition, LPA effectively blocks chemotherapeutic drug-induced apoptosis in CLL cells (34Hu X. Haney N. Kropp D. Kabore A.F. Johnston J.B. Gibson S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9498-9508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The mechanism of this survival response to LPA is not well understood. Here we demonstrate that LPA prevents HDI-induced apoptosis through reduced DR4 expression. LPA also activates HDAC1 enzymatic activity and reduces HAT enzymatic activity. Preventing LPA from binding to its receptors with a selective antagonist or inhibiting LPA1 expression blocked LPA-induced HDAC enzymatic activity and inhibited the protective effects of LPA against HDI-induced apoptosis. Together, our results revealed for the first time a novel mechanism for regulation of histone acetylation by LPA that increases cell survival and antagonizes the effects of HDIs. Materials—LPA (18:1) was purchased from Sigma and dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin. Anti-HDAC1 and -HDAC2 antibodies were purchased from Affinity BioReagents; anti-acetyl-H3, anti-acetyl-H4, anti-histone H3, and anti-p300 for ChIP experiments were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology; anti-histone H3 and H4 were from Cell Signaling Technology; and soluble super-TRAIL was purchased from Alexis. Monoclonal antibodies against β-actin, DR4, and HDAC1 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-LPA1 antibody was purchased from Exalpha Biologicals Inc. Anti-DR5 antibody was purchased from MEDICORP (Toronto, Canada). Trichostatin (TSA) and valproic acid (VPA) were purchased from Sigma and were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. GW9662 was purchased from Cayman. Patients and Lymphocyte Isolation—Peripheral blood samples were obtained from CLL patients or normal age-matched individuals following informed consent, in agreement with the Research Ethics Board at the University of Manitoba. The cells were isolated as described by Hu et al. (34Hu X. Haney N. Kropp D. Kabore A.F. Johnston J.B. Gibson S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9498-9508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, mononuclear cells were isolated from the buffy coat of CLL patients or normal individuals using Ficoll-Paque density gradient centrifugation. The cell isolates were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and a second wash with ice-cold 10 mm Tris, 140 mm NH4Cl to lyse residual erythrocytes. When the peripheral blood lymphocyte counts were <30 × 109/liter, contaminating monocytes were removed from the isolates using CD33 antibodies coupled to magnetic beads, and T cells were removed by sheep red cell resetting. The remaining cells were purified B cells. Cell Culture and Treatment Conditions—Lymphocytes were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified, 5% CO2 incubator at an initial density of 5 × 106 cells/ml in serum-free RPMI 1640 culture medium. BJAB, I-83, and CaOv3 cells were also grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 100 units of penicillin, 100 μg of streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were always incubated in serum-free conditions overnight prior to treatment. Human embryonic kidney cell line 293 (HEK293) was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). HDAC Activity Assay—HDAC activity was determined using the fluorometric HDAC activity assay kit (BioVision Inc.). Nuclear extracts (10 μg) from the cells treated with LPA (10 μm) were assayed for HDAC activity. The HDAC reaction was initiated by adding t-butoxycarbonyl-Lys(AC)-amido-4-methylcoumarin substrate (Boc-Lys(AC)AMC), and incubation was performed at 37 °C for 30 min with the nuclear extracts. After 30 min, the lysine developer was added, and the mixture was incubated for another 30 min at 37 °C. Fluorescence was measured using a Spectra Max M5 fluorescent plate reader (Molecular Devices), with excitation at 360 nm and emission at 460 nm. No enzyme control or inhibitor controls were included, and all reactions were set up in duplicate. Results represent three independent experiments. HAT Activity Assay—HAT activity was determined using the colorimetric HAT activity assay kit (BioVision Inc.). Nuclear extracts (50 μg) from the cells treated with LPA (10 μm) were assayed for HAT activity. The reaction was initiated by adding peptide substrate to the nuclear lysate, containing active HATs, and incubated at 37 °C for 1-3 h. Enzyme activity was measured using a Spectra Max M5 plate reader (Molecular Devices). The cell lysate was boiled for 15 min and taken as negative control. Results represent three independent experiments. Immunoprecipitation—Cells were treated with LPA and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.25, 150 mm NaCl, 50 μm ZnCl3, 50 μm NaF, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). 1 mg/ml protein from each pre-cleared cell lysate was incubated with 4 μg of anti-HDAC1 or anti-HDAC2 antibody overnight at 4 °C, and then 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads was added and incubated for an additional 2 h. The immunoprecipitation complex was washed four times with lysis buffer and boiled in loading buffer for 10 min, and immunoblotting was performed as described below. Anti-HDAC1 or anti-HDAC2 was used as the primary antibody. For the HDAC activity assay after the immunoprecipitation of HDAC1 or HDAC2, the beads were washed two times and assayed directly for HDAC activity as described above. Immunoblots—The cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.25, 150 mm NaCl, 50 μm ZnCl2, 50 μm NaF, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad assay. After SDS-PAGE, the proteins were transferred to nitro-cellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% milk in Tris/Tween 20 solution for 1 h, followed by overnight incubation with primary antibody at 4 °C, and finally incubated for 1 h with secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad). Detection was by ECL-Western Lightning Chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Biosciences). The blots were stripped in 10% SDS buffer and re-probed with β-actin to normalize for protein loading in each lane. ChIP—The ChIP assay was performed as described by Shetty et al. (35Shetty S. Graham B.A. Brown J.G. Hu X. Vegh-Yarema N. Harding G. Paul J.T. Gibson S.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 5404-5416Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) with some modifications. I-83 or primary CLL cells were fixed to cross-link protein bound to DNA by adding form-aldehyde at a final concentration of 1% for 10 min at room temperature. The cell lysate was sonicated at 30% output on ice four times with 15-s intervals and pre-cleared with protein A-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). The lysate was precipitated with the primary antibodies to acetylated histone 3 (3 μg) or HDAC1 (4 μg) or p300 (4 μg) overnight at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were tested to ensure that the targeted proteins were completely immunoprecipitated (data not shown). The DNA was purified using the QIA-AMP DNA purification system (Qiagen). PCR products were detected, using primers specific for DR4 (forward primer, 5′-TCTCCCGTGGTTTAAGGACTTCA-3′ and reverse primer, 5′-TCAAGCGATTTTCCTGCCTCA-3′), for 30 cycles with cycling conditions as follows: 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. For each treatment point, 1% of the total DNA was assayed for equal loading (input). Input was conducted for each condition tested. Transfection of HEK293 Cells with siRNA and LPA1 Vector—HEK293 cells were plated in 6-well plates and grown to 70% confluence. siRNA (40 nm) against HDAC1 or LPA1 (Smart Pool, Dharmacon) was used. Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine2000 as described in the manufacturer's instructions. After 48 h, the cells were treated with 10 μm LPA for an additional 2 h. The nuclear extracts were then assayed for HDAC activity as described above. Scrambled siRNA was used as control. For the LPA1 overexpression experiment, the cells were grown to ∼60% confluence and transfected with 5 μg of cDNA for human LPA1 in pcDNA3 vector containing a FLAG tag. Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine as described in the manufacturer's instructions. After 48 h, the cells were treated with 10 μm LPA for an additional 2 h. Assessment of Cell Surface Receptor Expression—Cells were resuspended in blocking buffer (10% normal goat serum in PBS), incubated for 30 min on ice to block nonspecific binding, and then incubated with anti-TRAIL-R1/DR4 fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibody (Alexis) or an isotopematched control antibody (Pharmingen) for 1 h on ice. The samples were washed twice by centrifugation at 1200 rpm for 5 min with ice-cold PBS and resuspended in PBS and analyzed immediately by flow cytometry. Cell Death Detection and Membrane Permeability Assay—The cells were resuspended in 100 μl of medium and stained with a mixture of acridine orange (100 μg/ml) and ethidium bromide (100 μg/ml) in phosphate-buffered saline. A cell suspension was then applied onto a microscope slide and covered with a coverslip, and the cells were viewed using a fluorescence microscope with a fluorescein filter set to quantitate condensed DNA in apoptotic cells. Random fields were scored, and the percentage of apoptotic cells was determined from cells containing condensed DNA to cells with normal DNA. At least 200 cells were counted for each condition tested. Caspase-8 Activity Assay—Cells were collected and lysed as described above in immunoblots. 50 μg of cell lysate was taken and diluted in 2× reaction buffer (BioVision) and labeled with IETD-p-nitroanilide substrate (BioVision) at 200 μm final concentration. Sample was incubated at 37 °C for 1-2 h and read by plate reader (Molecular Devices), at 400 or 405 nm. Annexin V/7-AAD Staining—Cells (5 × 106) were collected in 5-ml tubes, centrifuged, resuspended in 1× binding buffer (10 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2), and supplemented with annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (Pharmingen) and 2.5 μg of 7-AAD (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). After 15 min of incubation at room temperature in the dark, an excess of 1× binding buffer was added to a final volume of 500 μl. The cells were then analyzed for fluorescence-activated cell sorter with a Caliber flow cytometer. Statistical Analysis—All experiments were repeated at least three times, and each experiment was performed at least in duplicate. The data were expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed by using Student's t test. The criterion for statistical significance was p < 0.05. LPA Blocks HDI-induced Apoptosis—LPA protects multiple types of cancer cells from spontaneous or drug-induced apoptosis (34Hu X. Haney N. Kropp D. Kabore A.F. Johnston J.B. Gibson S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9498-9508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We determined whether LPA could protect tumor cells from HDI-induced apoptosis. I-83 (CLL-like cell line), BJAB (Burkitt's lymphoma cell line), and CaOv-3 (ovarian cancer cell line) cells were treated with 75 nm TSA or 1 mm VPA, alone or in combination with 10 μm LPA, and apoptosis was measured after 48 h by membrane permeability assay (Fig. 1A). In untreated cells, the levels of apoptosis was ∼20%, and LPA reduced this to 9-12% (Fig. 1A). In cells treated with TSA or VPA alone, the number of apoptotic cells ranged from 36 to 43%, and the addition of LPA decreased apoptosis to 19-23%. At the same time, cells were also treated with Ki16425. Ki16425 selectively inhibits LPA receptor-mediated actions, especially through LPA1 and LPA3. This blocked LPA protection against HDI-induced apoptosis (Fig. 1A). In primary CLL cells, LPA reduced VPA-induced apoptosis from 45 to 27.5% (Fig. 1B). Previous studies have indicated that caspase-8 is activated by HDI (18Nebbioso A. Clarke N. Voltz E. Germain E. Ambrosino C. Bontempo P. Alvarez R. Schiavone E.M. Ferrara F. Bresciani F. Weisz A. de Lera A.R. Gronemeyer H. Altucci L. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). To confirm that HDI-induced apoptosis was blocked by LPA, we examined the effect of VPA alone or in combination with LPA on caspase-8 activation as described under “Experimental Procedures.” HDI have been shown previously to activate caspase-8 (18Nebbioso A. Clarke N. Voltz E. Germain E. Ambrosino C. Bontempo P. Alvarez R. Schiavone E.M. Ferrara F. Bresciani F. Weisz A. de Lera A.R. Gronemeyer H. Altucci L. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar), and we showed that in untreated or LPA-treated cells caspase-8 activity was detected at a basal level (Fig. 1C), whereas in VPA-treated cells the caspase-8 level was increased ∼5-fold in I-83 cells. When VPA was combined with LPA, activity of caspase-8 was dramatically reduced. This implies that HDI-induced apoptosis was blocked by LPA (Fig. 1C). LPA Blocked HDI- and TRAIL-induced Apoptosis—Several studies have suggested that HDIs up-regulate TRAIL DR expression in tumor cells (18Nebbioso A. Clarke N. Voltz E. Germain E. Ambrosino C. Bontempo P. Alvarez R. Schiavone E.M. Ferrara F. Bresciani F. Weisz A. de Lera A.R. Gronemeyer H. Altucci L. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 19Inoue S.

Fennedy D.B. Dyer M.J. Cohen G.M. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 773-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The up-regulation of the TRAIL death receptors can lead to activation of the TRAIL apoptotic pathway (18Nebbioso A. Clarke N. Voltz E. Germain E. Ambrosino C. Bontempo P. Alvarez R. Schiavone E.M.

Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8356-8369Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In addition, we have shown that VPA activates caspase-8 activity, which is a death receptor-activated caspase. To determine whether HDIs activate the TRAIL apoptotic pathway, we incubated BJAB, I-83, and CaOv-3 cells with 1 mm VPA for 48 h in the presence or absence of 1 ng/ml TRAIL. Combined treatment with VPA and TRAIL increased the apoptotic response over either agent alone, and apoptosis was decreased from 44-63 to 23-36% by the addition of LPA (Fig. 2A). In addition, the above cell lines and primary CLL cells were treated with 1 mm VPA alone or in combination with 100 ng/ml DR4:Fc protein (sequesters TRAIL away from its endogenous receptors) for 24 h. HDI-induced apoptosis was determined by membrane permeability assay, as descr"
https://openalex.org/W2025183699,"Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) is a major genetic event causing inactivation of tumor suppressor genes in human carcinogenesis. To elucidate chromosomal mechanisms causing LOH, 201 LOHs in 10 cases of human lung cancer, which were detected by a genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism array analysis, were investigated for responsible chromosome alterations by integrating information on breakpoints for DNA copy number changes obtained by array-comparative genome hybridization and on numerical and structural chromosomal alterations obtained by spectral karyotyping. The majority (80%) of LOHs were partial chromosome LOHs caused by structural chromosomal alterations, while the remaining (20%) were whole chromosome LOHs caused by whole chromosome deletions. Unbalanced translocation was defined as the most frequent alteration, and it accounted for 30% of all LOHs. Three other structural alterations-interstitial deletion (19%), mitotic recombination (9%) and gene conversion (6%)-also contributed to the occurrence of LOH, while terminal deletion contributed to only a small subset (1%). Since unbalanced translocation is a common chromosomal alteration in lung cancer cells, the results in the present study strongly indicate that a considerable fraction of LOHs detected in lung cancer cells are caused by unbalanced translocation."
https://openalex.org/W2091338882,"The aim of this study is to investigate additional genetic alterations in papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs) with known RET/PTC rearrangements. We applied array-based comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) to 33 PTC (20 PTC from adults, 13 post-Chernobyl PTC from children) with known RET/PTC status. Principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis identified cases with similar aberration patterns. Significant deviations between tumour-groups were obtained by statistical testing (Fisher's exact test in combination with Benjamini-Hochberg FDR-controlling procedure). FISH analysis on FFPE sections was applied to validate the array CGH data. Deletions were found more frequently in RET/PTC-positive and RET/PTC-negative tumours than amplifications. Specific aberration signatures were identified that discriminated between RET/PTC-positive and RET/PTC-negative cases (aberrations on chromosomes 1p, 3q, 4p, 7p, 9p/q, 10q, 12q, 13q and 21q). In addition, childhood and adult RET/PTC-positive cases differ significantly for a deletion on the distal part of chromosome 1p. There are additional alterations in RET/PTC-positive tumours, which may act as modifiers of RET activation. In contrast, alterations in RET/PTC-negative tumours indicate alternative routes of tumour development. The data presented serve as a starting point for further studies on gene expression and function of genes identified in this study."

https://openalex.org/W1984867277,"A hallmark of the afflicted nervous tissue in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is the presence of protein aggregates, which to a large extent contain the intermediate filament protein peripherin. Here we show that activation of protein kinase C (PKC) or overexpression of PKCϵ induces the aggregation of peripherin in cultured neuroblastoma cells with elevated amounts of peripherin. The formation of aggregates was coupled to an increased apoptosis, suggesting a functional link between these events. Both induction of aggregates and apoptosis were suppressed in cells that had been transfected with small interfering RNAs targeting PKCϵ. PKCϵ and peripherin associate as shown by co-immunoprecipitation, and the interaction is dependent on and mediated by the C1b domain of PKCϵ. The interaction was specific for PKCϵ since corresponding structures from other isoforms did not co-precipitate peripherin, with the exception for PKCη and -θ, which pulled down minute amounts. PKCϵ interacts with vimentin through the same structures but does not induce its aggregation. When the PKCϵ C1b domain is expressed in neuroblastoma cells together with peripherin, both phorbol ester-induced peripherin aggregation and apoptosis are abolished, supporting a model in which PKCϵ through its interaction with peripherin facilitates its aggregation and subsequent cell death.

This is frequently accompanied with, and may in several instances be caused by, the formation of large aggregates of different proteins in the afflicted neuronal tissue. The perhaps most notable examples are the amyloid plaques and neurofibrillar tangles seen in Alzheimer disease (1Hardy J. Selkoe D.J. Science. 2002; 297: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (10782) Google Scholar, 2Tanzi R.E. Bertram L. Cell. 2005; 120: 545-555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1471) Google Scholar).

This leads to skeletal muscle atrophy, paralysis, and finally death (3Julien J.P. Beaulieu J.M. J. Neurol.

As seen in many neurodegenerative diseases, different protein aggregates can be found in the afflicted neurons (5Strong M.J. Kesavapany S. Pant H.C. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2005; 64: 649-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 7He C.Z. Hays A.P. J. Neurol Sci. 2004; 217: 47-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These frequently contain the intermediate filament proteins neurofilament and peripherin (8Migheli A. Pezzulo T. Attanasio A. Schiffer D. Lab. Investig. 1993; 68: 185-191PubMed Google Scholar, 9Corbo M. Hays A.P. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1992; 51: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Peripherin is a class III intermediate filament that is specifically expressed in neuronal tissue and at particularly high levels in cells of the peripheral nervous system (10Portier M.M. de Néchaud B. Gros F. Dev. Neurosci. 1983; 6: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 11Parysek L.M. Goldman R.D. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 555-563Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Besides the findings in patients, there are a number of studies linking peripherin aggregates to ALS and/or motor neuron degeneration. Transgenic mice that overexpress peripherin exhibit motor neuron loss that is preceded by the appearance of peripherin inclusions in the cells (12Robertson J. Beaulieu J.M. Doroudchi M.M. Durham H.D.

Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 531-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) and by defective axonal transport (14Millecamps S. Robertson J. Larivière R. Mallet J. Julien J.P. J. Neurochem. 2006; 98: 926-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the aggregation of peripherin makes neurons more susceptible to cell death stimuli (12Robertson J. Beaulieu J.M. Doroudchi M.M. Durham H.D. Julien J.P. Mushynski W.E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), suggesting a causal link between the formation of aggregates and cellular degeneration. The putative pathogenic role of the aggregates raises the possibility that their dissolution or a block of their further expansion may suppress the advancement of the disease. However, there is not much known about the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of peripherin aggregates.In this study, we demonstrate that protein kinase C (PKC) promotes the aggregation of peripherin. PKC constitutes a serine/threonine kinase family that is subdivided in classical (PKCα, -βI, -βII, and -γ), novel (PKCδ, -ϵ, -η, and -θ), and atypical (PKCι and -ζ) PKC isoforms based on structural similarities (15Mellor H. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1348) Google Scholar). The PKC isoforms are central regulators of a wide range of cellular processes. We have seen that PKCϵ induces outgrowth of neurites in many cell types of neural origin (16Zeidman R. Pettersson L. Sailaja P.R. Truedsson E. Fagerström S. Påhlman S. Larsson C. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 81: 494-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 17Zeidman R. Löfgren B. Påhlman S. Larsson C. J.

Cell Res. 2004; 292: 135-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The effect is independent of the catalytic activity and mediated by the C1 domains in the regulatory domain of the molecule (17Zeidman R. Löfgren B. Påhlman S. Larsson C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 713-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In an approach to dissect the molecular mechanisms mediating this effect, we immunoprecipitated the neuritogenic PKCϵ structure and analyzed which proteins were co-precipitated. One of these was peripherin, and the interaction was confirmed for endogenous proteins. When analyzing a putative function of the interaction in the regulation of cellular morphology, we discovered that either activation of PKC or overexpression of PKCϵ markedly increase the number of cells with peripherin aggregates. Furthermore, the aggregate formation was accompanied by an increased apoptosis. Thus, the results in this study provide important clues to our understanding of the molecular basis for the formation of peripherin aggregates and its consequences for neuronal cell survival, a feature that is characteristic for ALS.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids—Expression vectors encoding full-length human PKC isoforms, isolated domains of PKC isoforms, or kinase-dead full-length PKCϵ (K438R mutation) fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) have been described previously (17Zeidman R. Löfgren B. Påhlman S. Larsson C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 713-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 18Ling M. Trollér U. Zeidman R. Lundberg C. Larsson C. Exp.

To generate an expression vector encoding FLAG-tagged peripherin, cDNA was amplified with PCR using primers containing EcoRI and SalI sites and a peripherin full-length clone (RZPD Deutsches Ressourcenzentrum für Genomforschung GmbH, clone ID: IRAT p970D0254D6) as template. The cDNA was inserted into the p3XFLAG-CMV™-7.1 vector (Sigma) and sequenced to verify that no mutations had been introduced in the PCR.pCMV-script vectors (Stratagene) encoding either wild-type vimentin or mutants with N-terminal serine residues (Ser-4, -6, -7, -8, -9) mutated to alanine (vimentin Ala) or aspartate (vimentin Asp) were kindly provided by Dr. J. Ivaska (20Ivaska J. Vuoriluoto K. Huovinen T. Izawa I. Inagaki M. Parker P.J. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3834-3845Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). To produce ECFP-tagged peripherin or peripherin and EGFP as separate proteins, the FLAG-tagged peripherin cDNA was digested with EcoRI/SalI, and the fragment was inserted in either the pECFP-C1 expression vector (Clontech) or the pCMS-EGFP expression vector (Clontech).Cell Culture and Transfections—Human neuroblastoma cells SK-N-BE(2)C were grown in minimum essential medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Euro-Clone), 100 IU/ml penicillin (Invitrogen), and 100 μg/μl streptomycin (Invitrogen). MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% sodium pyruvate, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/μl streptomycin. Cells were kept at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 and 95% air.For immunoprecipitation experiments, SK-N-BE(2)C or MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded at a density of 1.5–2 × 106 cells/100-mm cell culture dish. For immunofluorescence experiments, 200,000 SK-N-BE(2)C cells were seeded on glass coverslips in 35-mm cell culture dishes. For differentiation of SK-N-BE(2)C cells, 200,000 cells were seeded on glass coverslips in 35-mm cell culture dishes and incubated in 10 μm all-trans-retinoic acid (Sigma). Transfections were performed with 2 μg of DNA and 2 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) per ml Optimem I medium (Invitrogen) according to the supplier's protocol.For siRNA transfections 70,000 SK-N-BE(2)C cells were transfected on three consecutive days with 50 nm Stealth™ RNA interference oligonucleotides (Invitrogen) and 1.5 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 per ml Optimem I medium. Two off-target oligonucleotides with 44 and 48% GC-content, respectively, were used as controls. The PKCϵ oligonucleotides were 5′-CACAAGUUCGGUAUCCACAACUACA-3′ (siPKCϵ1), 5′-GCAAGGUCAUGUUGGCAGAACUCAA-3′ (siPKCϵ2), and 5′-CCACAAGUUCAUGGCCACCUAUCUU-3′ (siPKCϵ3). When indicated, cells were incubated with 16 nm 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA; Sigma), 2 μm GF109203X (bisindolylmaleimide I; Calbiochem), or 20 μm benzylocarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-(O-methyl)fluoromethylketone (z-VAD, Sigma).Immunoprecipitation—Cells were treated as indicated in the protocol supplied with the μMACS epitope-tagged protein isolation kit (Militenyi Biotec). Cells were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in lysis buffer, supplied with the kit, and a complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) for 30 min on ice. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and incubated either with anti-GFP-conjugated microbeads for 30 min or with 2 μg of anti-peripherin antibodies (Sigma) for 1 h prior to addition of protein G-coupled microbeads and an additional incubation for 30 min on rotation at 4 °C. Mouse IgG1 antibodies (ImmunoKontact) were used as controls. The immune complexes were recovered by applying the cell lysates on μ columns placed in the magnetic field of a μMACS separator and then washed and eluted with an elution buffer included in the kit.Identification of Co-precipitated Proteins—Immune complexes were obtained as described under the “Immunoprecipitation” section. Thereafter iodoacetamide was added to give a final concentration of 100 mm, and the precipitated proteins were incubated for 20 min in darkness. The samples were electrophoretically separated by SDS-PAGE using a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was silver-stained as described previously (21Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7763) Google Scholar), first washed in 50% methanol with 5% acetic acid for 20 min and placed in 50% methanol for 10 min and then sensitized with 0.02% sodium thiosulfate before staining with 0.1% silver nitrate for 20 min at 4 °C and developed in a solution of 0.04% formalin and 2% sodium carbonate for less then 10 min followed by 5% acetic acid stopping the reaction. Bands in the lane with precipitate from SK-N-BE(2)C cells transfected with PKCϵ PSC1V3 and absent in the lane with precipitate from EGFP-transfected cells were excised and treated for subsequent in-gel digestion as described (22Hellman U. Silberring J. Ekman R Mass Spectrometry and Hyphenated Techniques in Neuropeptide Research. John Wiley & Sons, Inc, New York2002: 259-275Google Scholar). Briefly, after destaining and rehydration using neat acetonitrile, the samples were proteolyzed overnight using porcine modified trypsin (Promega). The generated peptides were analyzed by peptide mass fingerprinting using a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Ultraflex tandem time-of-flight, Bruker Daltonics). The instrument settings were optimized for analytes from 600 to 4500 Da and α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid was used as matrix. The peptide mass lists were used to search sequence databases for protein identification using Pro-Found at the PROWL web site as search engine.Immunoblotting—Proteins were electrophoretically separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). The membranes were incubated with primary monoclonal antibodies toward GFP (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), peripherin (Sigma), or vimentin (DakoCytomation) or with polyclonal antibodies toward PKCα, -βII, -δ, or -ϵ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The membranes were thereafter incubated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences), which was detected using the SuperSignal system (Biological Industries) as substrate. The chemoluminescence was captured with a charge-coupled device camera (Fujifilm).Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—16 h after transfection, cells were washed once in PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 4 min, washed twice in PBS, and thereafter permeabilized and blocked with 5% goat serum and 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 min. Cells were incubated with primary antibodies toward peripherin (Sigma), vimentin (DAKO), or FLAG (Sigma) in PBS for 1 h. Following washes in PBS, cells were incubated with secondary Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Molecular Probes) diluted 1:800 in PBS for 1 h followed by extensive washes in PBS and mounted on object slides using 20 μl of PVA-DABCO (9.6% polyvinyl alcohol, 24% glycerol and 2.5% 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in 67 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). For phalloidin staining, cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated Phalloidin (Molecular Probes) diluted 1:200 in PBS for 20 min after the secondary antibody incubation. The coverslips were studied by immunofluorescence microscopy or by confocal microscopy using a Bio-Rad Radiance 2000 confocal system fitted on a Nikon microscope with a ×60/NA 1.40 oil lens. Excitation wavelengths were 457 nm (ECFP), 488 nm (EGFP), and 543 nm (Alexa Fluor 546), and the emission filters used were HQ485/30 (ECFP), HQ515/30 (EGFP), and 600LP (Alexa Fluor 546). In aggregation experiments, 200 transfected cells, identified by the fluorescence of EGFP, were scored for aggregate contents.Analysis of Apoptosis—SK-N-BE(2)C cells were washed in PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 4 min and thereafter washed twice in PBS followed by incubation for 20 min in a DNA staining solution containing 3.5 μm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mm NaCl, 5 μg/ml propidium iodide, 20 μg/ml RNase, and 0.1% v/v Nonidet P-40. The coverslips were examined by immunofluorescence microscopy where 200 transfected cells, identified by EGFP positivity, were counted and then scored for fragmented or condensed nuclei.RESULTSPeripherin Associates with PKCϵ in Neuroblastoma Cells—Our previous work has shown that PKCϵ, via its regulatory domain, induces neurites in a wide range of neural cell types. More specifically, the effect is mediated by a structure encompassing the two C1 domains and flanking residues in the pseudosubstrate and the V3 region (PKCϵ PSC1V3) (17Zeidman R. Löfgren B. Påhlman S. Larsson C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 713-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 23Ling M. Trollér U. Zeidman R. Stensman H. Schultz A. Larsson C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17910-17919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Our hypothesis is therefore that PKCϵ exerts some of its biological effects via this structure, conceivably by interacting with other proteins. The identification of such interacting proteins could therefore provide a significant advance in our understanding of the mechanisms that mediate some PKCϵ effects.To identify proteins that interact with the PKCϵ PSC1V3 region, SK-N-BE(2)C neuroblastoma cells were transfected with a vector encoding this PKCϵ structure fused to EGFP (Fig. 1A). Cell lysates were thereafter immunoprecipitated with an anti-GFP antibody coupled to magnetic beads. The precipitate was separated with SDS-PAGE, and the gel was subjected to silver staining (Fig. 1B). As control, precipitates of lysates from cells transfected with empty EGFP vector were used to visualize proteins unspecifically precipitated. Silver staining revealed several bands that were only present in the lane with the PKCϵ PSC1V3 precipitate. One of these, representing a protein of ∼50 kDa was, following trypsin digestion and mass spectrometry analysis, identified as peripherin, a class III intermediate filament, with an estimated molecular mass of 54 kDa.To confirm the interaction, the association of endogenous PKCϵ with peripherin was investigated. Lysates from SK-N-BE(2)C neuroblastoma cells were immunoprecipitated using anti-peripherin antibodies, and PKCϵ was detected in the precipitate (Fig. 1C). Of the other classical and novel isoforms expressed in neuroblastoma cells, neither PKCβII nor PKCδ co-precipitated with peripherin. However, there was a faint band corresponding to PKCα. Isotype-matched control antibodies did not precipitate the PKC isoforms.The interaction of PKC with its binding partners has in several cases been shown to depend on the conformation of the PKC molecule. To investigate whether this is the case for the interaction of PKCϵ with peripherin, SK-N-BE(2)C cells were treated for 30 min with TPA prior to immunoprecipitation with antibodies against peripherin. When compared with untreated cells, no effect of TPA on the amount of co-precipitated PKCϵ could be discerned (Fig. 1C). Thus, the interaction of peripherin with PKCϵ is largely isoform-specific and not influenced by activation of PKC with phorbol esters.The Interaction Is Mediated via the C1b Domain in PKCϵ—Peripherin was found as a PKCϵ-binding protein by using a fragment of the regulatory domain, PSC1V3, suggesting that this is the site responsible for the association. However, it cannot be excluded that other parts of the PKCϵ molecule also participate in the association with peripherin. To compare the interaction capacity of different PKCϵ domains, SK-N-BE(2)C cells were transfected with vectors encoding either the regulatory or the catalytic domain together with a vector encoding full-length PKCϵ fused to EGFP (Fig. 2A). Immunoprecipitation of the GFP-tagged proteins revealed that peripherin binds to the regulatory domain and not to the catalytic domain of PKCϵ. The interaction with the isolated regulatory domain seemed to be stronger than the interaction with the holo-enzyme, perhaps implying that relevant structures are conformationally masked in the full-length protein.FIGURE 2The interaction with peripherin is mediated by the C1b domain of PKCϵ. SK-N-BE(2)C cells were transfected with vectors encoding EGFP fusions of either full-length PKCϵ (PKCϵFL), the PKCϵ regulatory domain (PKCϵRD), or the PKCϵ catalytic domain (PKCϵCD) (A); the PKCϵ C2 domain (PKCϵC2), the PKCϵ PSC1V3 domain (PKCϵPSC1V3), or a PKCϵ PSC1V3 variant where the PKCϵ C1b domain was exchanged for the PKCα C1b domain (PKCϵPSC1a(αC1b)V3)(B); or the PKCϵ regulatory domain (PKCϵRD), the PKCϵ C1a domain (PKCϵC1a), the PKCϵ C1b domain (PKCϵC1b), the tandem PKCϵ C1a and C1b domains together (PKCϵC1ab), or the PKCα C1b domain (PKCαC1b) (C). An empty EGFP vector was used as control. Lysates were immunoprecipitated using anti-GFP-conjugated magnetic beads and thereafter subjected to Western blotting using a peripherin antibody. The positions of molecular mass markers are shown to the left of the blots. Please note that the two rightmost constructs in the total cell lysate blot of B are weak and located immediately above an unspecific band and therefore hard to detect. The presence of the constructs are clearly seen in the blot with the precipitates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further delineate the specific structures in the PKCϵ regulatory domain that mediate the interaction, the C2 domain and the PSC1V3 domain of PKCϵ fused to EGFP were expressed in SK-N-BE(2)C cells and immunoprecipitated (Fig. 2B). This demonstrated that the C2 domain does not contribute to the interaction with peripherin. In addition, a construct encoding PKCϵ PSC1V3 with the C1b domain exchanged for the PKCα C1b domain (PKCϵ PSC1a(αC1b)V3) (23Ling M. Trollér U. Zeidman R. Stensman H. Schultz A. Larsson C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17910-17919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) was evaluated for peripherin interaction. The amount of peripherin that was co-precipitated with this chimera (Fig. 2B, lane 4) was substantially lower when compared with the amount that was precipitated with the pure PKCϵ construct. Furthermore, the isolated PKCϵ C1b domain co-precipitated with peripherin, whereas this was not observed for either the isolated PKCϵ C1a or the isolated PKCα C1b domain (Fig. 2C). Thus, the peripherin interaction seems to be mediated primarily by the PKCϵ C1b domain. However, the tandem PKCϵ C1aC1b domain displayed a stronger interaction than the isolated C1b domain (Fig. 2C), indicating that the C1a domain or structures flanking the C1b domain contribute to or promote the interaction.Peripherin Preferentially Binds to PKCϵ—To further investigate the isoform specificity of the interaction, SK-N-BE(2)C cells were transfected with vectors encoding full-length versions of PKCα, -βI, -βII, -δ, -ϵ, -η, and -θ fused to EGFP. The constructs were immunoprecipitated using the GFP tag, and the eluted immunoprecipitates were analyzed with Western blotting (Fig. 3A). The strongest association was seen with PKCϵ but PKCη also precipitated some peripherin.FIGURE 3PKCϵ is the isoform with the strongest interaction with peripherin. SK-N-BE(2)C cells were transfected with vectors encoding EGFP only or EGFP fused to the full-length versions (A); the regulatory domains (B); or the C1b domains (C) of the different PKC isoforms α, β, δ, ϵ, η, or θ. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) using anti-GFP-conjugated magnetic beads and thereafter subjected to Western blotting using anti-peripherin antibody. The positions of the molecular mass markers for 66, 45, and 30 kDa are shown to the left of the blots. RD, regulatory domain.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We thereafter investigated whether the isolated regulatory domains from the previously mentioned isoforms can bind peripherin (Fig. 3B). Peripherin binds strongly to the regulatory domain of PKCϵ but not to the corresponding structure from PKCα, -β, or -δ. The low expression levels of the PKCη and -θ regulatory domains together with the faint peripherin bands in the precipitates indicate that these isoforms may also contain the structures necessary for association with peripherin.Next, the isolated C1b domains from PKCα and all novel PKC isoforms were compared in terms of association with peripherin (Fig. 3C). A substantial interaction with peripherin was observed for the PKCϵ C1b domain, although minor amounts of peripherin were detected in PKCη C1b and PKCθ C1b precipitates, reflecting the results with the corresponding regulatory domains (Fig. 3, A and B).Overexpressed Peripherin Aggregates in a PKC-dependent Manner—To analyze a putative functional importance of the interaction of PKCϵ with peripherin, we first overexpressed peripherin tagged to the FLAG epitope in SK-N-BE(2)C neuroblastoma cells and thereafter incubated the cells for 16 h with the PKC activator TPA and/or the PKC inhibitor GF109203X (Fig. 4, A and B). Transfected cells were then visualized by the green fluorescent protein, and exogenous peripherin was visualized with immunofluorescence toward the FLAG tag. Overexpression of peripherin resulted in the formation of large peripherin-positive aggregates in some cells. Exposure to TPA markedly increased the number of cells with aggregates (Fig. 4A, panel d) from 31 to 54% (Fig. 4B), and this effect was suppressed by GF109203X (Fig. 4A, panel f, and B). The peripherin aggregates are reminiscent of what is observed in nervous tissue of patients with ALS, and the PKC-mediated aggregation of peripherin may therefore shed mechanistic light on this disease (3Julien J.P.

https://openalex.org/W1985607958,"The transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha) is required during adipogenesis for development of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Modes for regulating this function of C/EBPalpha have yet to be determined. Phosphorylation of C/EBPalpha on Ser-21 has been implicated in the regulation of granulopoiesis and hepatic gene expression. To explore the role of Ser-21 phosphorylation on C/EBPalpha function during adipogenesis, we developed constructs in which Ser-21 was mutated to alanine (S21A) to model dephosphorylation. In two cell culture models deficient in endogenous C/EBPalpha, enforced expression of S21A-C/EBPalpha resulted in normal lipid accumulation and expression of many adipogenic markers. However, S21A-C/EBPalpha had impaired ability to activate the Glut4 promoter specifically, and S21A-C/EBPalpha expression resulted in diminished GLUT4 and adiponectin expression, as well as reduced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. No defects in insulin signaling or GLUT4 vesicle trafficking were identified with S21A-C/EBPalpha expression, and when exogenous GLUT4 expression was enforced to normalize expression in S21A-C/EBPalpha cells, insulin-responsive glucose transport was reconstituted, suggesting that the primary defect was a deficit in GLUT4 levels. Mice in which endogenous C/EBPalpha was replaced with S21A-C/EBPalpha displayed reduced GLUT4 and adiponectin protein expression in epididymal adipose tissue and increased blood glucose compared with wild-type littermates. These results suggest that phosphorylation of C/EBPalpha on Ser-21 may regulate adipocyte gene expression and whole body glucose homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2058635801,"Extensive mutational/functional analysis of the transcription-repression domain encoded in the N-terminal 80 amino acids of the adenovirus E1A 243R oncoprotein suggests a model for the molecular mechanism of E1A repression: E1A accesses transcriptional co-activators such as p300 on specific promoters and then interacts with TBP to disrupt the TBP–TATA complex. In support of this model, as reported here, a basal core promoter activated by tethering p300 is repressible by E1A at the promoter level as shown by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis. Sequestration of p300 by E1A does not play a significant role, as indicated by dose-response measurements. Furthermore, when the core promoter is transcriptionally activated by tethering activation domains of several transcription factors that can recruit p300 (p65, MyoD, cMyb and TFE3), transcription is repressible by E1A. However, when the core promoter is activated by factors not known to recruit p300 (USF1 and USF2), transcription is resistant to E1A repression. Finally, tethering p300 to the non-repressible adenovirus major late promoter (MLP) renders it repressible by E1A. ChIP analysis shows that E1A occupies the repressed MLP. These findings provide support for the hypothesis that p300 can serve as a scaffold for the E1A repression domain to access specific cellular gene promoters involved in growth regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2042694449,"Smooth muscle contraction is regulated by the phosphorylation of myosin. It is well known that tonic smooth muscles can maintain force with low energy consumption (latch state); however, the molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon is unresolved. Here we show that single-head phosphorylated smooth myosin (SHPMII) exhibits fast (∼24 s–1) and slow prolonged (∼1 s–1) actin interactions, whereas double-head phosphorylated myosin (DHPMII) predominantly exhibits the fast (∼29 s–1) interaction, suggesting that the phosphorylated head of SHPMII is mechanically as active as that of DHPMII. Both the fast and the slow actin interactions of SHPMII support the positive net mechanical displacement of actin. The actin translocating velocity of SHPMII was much slower than that of DHPMII, which is consistent with the slow actin interaction of SHPMII. We propose that the “latch state” can be explained by the motor characteristics of SHPMII that is present during the sustained phase of contraction.

We propose that the “latch state” can be explained by the motor characteristics of SHPMII that is present during the sustained phase of contraction. Smooth muscle is distributed in a variety of tissues such as airways, vasculature, digestive tract, bladder, and uterus. Some smooth muscle cells, such as found in digestive tract, ileum, bladder, and uterus, are mainly relaxed and show phasic contractions upon stimulations. These smooth muscles (often referred to as “phasic smooth muscles”) contract and relax rapidly, and their phasic responses are advantageous to the physiological functions such as peristalsis. On the other hand, other smooth muscle cells, such as the smooth muscle cells in airways and vasculature, show sustained contractions, and thus they are often referred to as “tonic smooth muscles.” Tonic smooth muscles contract slowly, and very importantly, they can maintain force with very low energy consumption (1Hai C.M. Murphy R.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1989; 51: 285-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 2Dillon P.F. Aksoy M.O. Driska S.P. Murphy R.A. Science. 1981; 211: 495-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). This state of tonic contraction is referred to as the “latch state,” and the tone of the contraction plays critical roles in the change in dimension of the hollow organs for regulating airflow, blood flow, organ perfusion, filtration rate of glomeruli, and so forth. Dysregulation of these smooth muscles causes a variety of pathophysiological states such as asthma and hypertension. Contractions of both phasic and tonic smooth muscles are regulated by the phosphorylation of the regulatory light chain (RLC) 3The abbreviations used are: RLC, regulatory light chain; SHP, single-head phosphorylated; SHPMII, SHP smooth myosin; DHP, double-head phosphorylated; DHPMII, DHP myosin; UPMII, unphosphorylated myosin; HMM, heavy meromyosin; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); MLCK, myosin light chain kinase; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine; MLCP, myosin light chain phosphatase. 3The abbreviations used are: RLC, regulatory light chain; SHP, single-head phosphorylated; SHPMII, SHP smooth myosin; DHP, double-head phosphorylated; DHPMII, DHP myosin; UPMII, unphosphorylated myosin; HMM, heavy meromyosin; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); MLCK, myosin light chain kinase; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine; MLCP, myosin light chain phosphatase. of smooth muscle myosin (3D.

Upon agonist stimulations, both phasic and tonic smooth muscles show a transient increase in force that is closely correlated with the transient increment of myoplasmic Ca2+ concentration and the concomitant RLC phosphorylation. In a phasic contraction, the force returns quickly to the basal level because of the reduction of the myoplasmic Ca2+ concentration (thus the phosphorylation level of RLC) to the basal level. In a tonic contraction, however, although the level of myosin phosphorylation declines after the transient increment of the myoplasmic Ca2+ concentration, it does not completely return to the basal level, and the force is maintained with low ATP consumption (1Hai C.M. Murphy R.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1989; 51: 285-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 2Dillon P.F. Aksoy M.O. Driska S.P. Murphy R.A. Science. 1981; 211: 495-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Because smooth muscle myosin has two heads that interact with actin, it is possible that three different phosphorylation forms of smooth muscle myosin are present in situ, i.e. unphosphorylated (UPMII), phosphorylated at both heads (DHPMII), and phosphorylated at one head (SHPMII). Because phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of RLC of smooth muscle myosin occur randomly (9Ogawa Y. Sato O. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1998; 453: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar, 10Trybus K.M. Lowey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15988-15995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and because the total phosphorylation level of smooth muscle myosin during the latch state is just 20–30% (11Berne, R. M. (2004) Physiology, 5th Ed., p. 255, Mosby, St. Louis, MOGoogle Scholar), the fraction of SHPMII is predicted to be significant and greater than that of the DHPMII during the latch state. Therefore, it is important to know the motor characteristics of SHPMII for understanding the molecular mechanism of the latch state. In this study, we characterized the mechanical properties of SHPMII for the first time and found that the latch state is well explained by the motor property of SHPMII.

The phosphorylation was confirmed by alkali-urea gel electrophoresis (not shown). Preparation of Single-head Phosphorylated (SHP) Myosin—The inherent RLC was removed from myosin or HMM as previously described (14Ikebe M. Kambara T. Stafford W.F. Sata M. Katayama E. Ikebe R. J.

Phosphorylated RLC-FLAG and dephosphorylated RLC-hexahistidine (1.5 mol of excess over heavy chain each) were mixed with the RLC-deficient heavy chain. The mixture was then applied to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen). Unphosphorylated, SHP, and DHP were eluted separately by imidazole HCl gradient as described (17Ellison P.A.

The movement speed of actin filaments was analyzed by collecting 100–150 data points obtained from 10–15 different actin filaments. The error bars indicate the standard deviations. Single Molecule Assay—Myosin rod cofilaments were prepared as described previously (19Tanaka H. Ishijima A. Honda M. Saito K. Yanagida T. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 1886-1894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and raised from the glass surface to a level higher than the bead radius. To achieve this, pedestals (∼5–10 μm in width and ∼5 μm in height) were made on the glass surface by chemically etching the glass slides. A solution containing myosin rod cofilaments was applied to a flow chamber with pedestals on a glass slide surface, which was coated with bovine serum albumin (0.5 mg/ml; Sigma) to prevent nonspecific binding of avidin-coated beads. Unbound cofilaments were washed out with assay buffer. Partially (∼10%) biotinylated actin filaments were mixed with avidincoated beads and introduced to the chamber in the assay buffer. Actin filaments labeled with phalloidin-TRITC (Sigma), myosin rod cofilaments including TRITC-labeled rod, and beads were visualized under an epifluorescence microscope. An actin filament, with both ends attached to separate beads captured by dual optical traps, was then brought into contact with a myosin rod cofilament on the surface of a pedestal at an angle of 5–10 degrees between the actin filament and the cofilament. The displacement of one of the beads was determined using a quadrant photodetector with nanometer accuracy. The displacements were measured in an assay buffer containing 25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, at 20–25 °C. To reduce photobleaching, an oxygen scavenger system was added as described (19Tanaka H. Ishijima A. Honda M. Saito K. Yanagida T. Biophys.

Computer Simulation—Fractions of UPMII, SHPMII, and DHPMII were estimated by computer simulation using STELLA v8.1.1 software (Isee Systems, Lebanon, NH). The rate constants of phosphorylation from UPMII to SHPMII and from SHPMII to DHPMII were assumed to be the same. Likewise, rate constants of dephosphorylation from DHPMII to SHPMII and from SHPMII to UPMII were assumed to be the same. The activities of MLCK and myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP) were shown arbitrarily in Fig. 4A to show their relative rates of phosphorylation (kMLCK) and dephosphorylation (kMLCP). The rate of [UPMII] formation was simply described as kMLCP [SHPMII] – kMLCK [UPMII]. Likewise, the rates of [SHPMII] formation and [DHPMII] formation were described as kMLCK [UPMII] + kMLCP [DHPMII] – (kMLCK + kMLCP) [SHPMII] and kMLCK [SHPMII] – kMLCP [DHPMII], respectively. The initial values of [UPMII], [SHPMII], and [DHPMII] at time 0 were 100, 0, and 0, respectively. The simultaneous differential equation was solved by Runge-Kutta fourth approximation with calculation time interval of 0.3 s. Halving and doubling the time interval did not affect the result. To examine the motor characteristics of smooth muscle myosin phosphorylated at one head, we prepared smooth muscle myosin species phosphorylated at both heads (DHPMII), phosphorylated at one head (SHPMII), or unphosphorylated (UPMII) (Fig. 1A). To obtain these smooth muscle myosin species, the inherent RLCs were specifically removed from smooth muscle myosin and replaced with the recombinant RLCs, which were either phosphorylated or unphosphorylated. These recombinant RLCs contained hexahistidine tag or FLAG epitope tag to facilitate the purification. Fig. 1B shows a typical example of the purification of SHPMII. A HMM version of the smooth muscle myosin species (DHPHMM, SHPHMM, and UHPHMM) was also prepared for the solution kinetics assays, because the filament formation of myosin makes an accurate analysis of the enzymatic activity difficult. The smooth muscle myosin species used in this study are summarized in Table 1.TABLE 1Smooth muscle myosin species used in this studyRLC exchanged?RLCDouble-head phosphorylatedppNop-RLC/p-RLC (native RLC)ppexYesp-RLC/p-RLC (recombinant RLC)pFpFYesp-FLAG-RLC/p-FLAG-RLC (recombinant RLC)pHpHYesp-His6-RLC/p-His6-RLC (recombinant RLC)Single-head phosphorylatedpFdHYesp-FLAG-RLC/His6-RLC (recombinant RLC)pdHYesp-RLC/His6-RLC (recombinant RLC)UnphosphorylatedddNoRLC/RLC (native RLC)dHdHYesHis6-RLC/His6-RLC (recombinant RLC)dFdFYesFLAG-RLC/FLAG-RLC (recombinant RLC) Open table in a new tab In Vitro Actin Translocating Activities—We first examined the actin translocating activities of the smooth muscle myosin species (Fig. 1C). The DHPMII species having the exchanged RLC with epitope tags (ppex, pFpF, and pHpH) showed comparable actin translocating velocities to that of the control DHPMII (pp), whereas all of the UPMII species (dd, dHdH, and dFdF) did not show actin translocating activity. These results strongly indicate that the RLC exchange procedure itself and the epitope tags of RLC do not impair the regulation and the motor activity of smooth muscle myosin. In contrast to DHPMII, the translocation of the actin filaments by the SHPMII species (pFdH and pdH) were not uniform. The actin filament movement was frequently intermitted, and thus the apparent overall movements were slower than the DHPMII species (Fig. 1C and supplemental Movies S1 and S2). To assure that this apparentlgy slow actin translocation is not due to the nonfunctional myosin molecules generated during the preparation, we tested whether this characteristic nonuniform actin translocating activity of SHPMII was rescued by treating the flow chamber used for the motility assay with Ca2+-calmodulin-activated MLCK. As shown in Fig. 1C and in supplemental Movie S3, the Ca2+-calmodulin-activated MLCK treatment completely rescued the slow and uneven actin translocating activity of SHPMII to the same level as that of DHPMII. It should be noted that the smooth actin translocation by DHPMII was hardly affected by mixing UPMII to DHPMII with 1:1 ratio (supplemental Movie S4). These results suggest that the slow intermittent movement of SHPMII is due to the presence of the dephosphorylated head within the same molecules and that SHPMII retains a unique actomyosin interaction that is not present in DHPMII. Dwell Time Distributions of Actin Interaction—To examine the mechanical property of SHPMII in detail, we performed a single molecule mechanical nanometry assay using optical trap (Fig. 2A). We used the “cofilament” method in which smooth muscle myosin molecules are incorporated into the headless myosin rod filaments to avoid damage to the molecules during the interaction with the glass (19Tanaka H. Ishijima A. Honda M. Saito K. Yanagida T. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 1886-1894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 20Tanaka H. Homma K. Iwane A.H. Katayama E. Ikebe R. Saito J. Yanagida T. Ikebe M. Nature. 2002; 415: 192-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). To produce cofilaments, we incubated the myosin rods at large molar excess compared with DHPMII, SHPMII, or UPMII to ensure that only one or two smooth muscle myosins are incorporated into each cofilament. Cofilaments were sparsely adsorbed onto the surface of a pedestal made on a glass surface. The number of myosins in a cofilament was determined by observing single fluorescent nucleotide analogues bound to myosin (19Tanaka H. Ishijima A. Honda M. Saito K. Yanagida T. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 1886-1894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 20Tanaka H. Homma K. Iwane A.H. Katayama E. Ikebe R. Saito J. Yanagida T. Ikebe M.

Cell. 1998; 92: 161-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). The number of the fluorescence spots in a cofilament caused by the bound nucleotides (Cy3-ATP/ADP) was mostly one and occasionally two, indicating that only one or two smooth muscle myosin molecules were incorporated into a cofilament. An actin filament with both ends attached to optically trapped beads was brought into contact with a single smooth muscle myosin in a cofilament, and the individual mechanical events were determined by measuring bead displacements with nanometer accuracy (21Ishijima A. Kojima H. Funatsu T. Tokunaga M. Higuchi H. Tanaka H. Yanagida T. Cell. 1998; 92: 161-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 22Finer J.T. Simmons R.M. Spudich J.A.

Nature. 1995; 378: 209-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Typical recordings of displacements of actin by DHPMII, SHPMII, and UPMII are shown in Fig. 2B. To precisely analyze the dwell time distributions, the integrated frequency was plotted against the dwell time and analyzed by both single exponential and double exponential functions (Fig. 2C). The dwell time distribution of DHPMII was fairly explained by a single exponential kinetics with an apparent rate of 29.0 ± 0.2 s–1, and the double exponential fitting did not significantly improve the fitting. SHPMII showed a significant frequency of prolonged dwell times compared with DHPMII. The frequency of dwell time longer than 1 s was ∼6% of the observed total events for SHPMII, whereas that of DHPMII was only ∼0.3%. The dwell time distribution of SHPMII was best explained by a double exponential kinetics with apparent rate constants of 24.2 ± 0.6 s–1 (92%) and 1.0 ± 0.3 s–1 (8%). The fast rate (24.2 ± 0.6 s–1) was similar to the rate observed for DHPMII (29.0 ± 0.2 s–1), suggesting that the two heads of SHPMII are distinct: one head is as active as the heads in DHPMII, whereas the other head is partially active with a slow actomyosin interaction. The dwell time distribution of UPMII was also satisfactorily explained by a double exponential kinetics with apparent rate constants of 12.3 ± 0.7 s–1 (41%) and 1.1 ± 0.1 s–1 (59%). The ADP release rate determines the dwell times of a myosin molecule on actin under the physiological concentration of ATP, and thus it is closely related to the actin translocating activities of myosins. Because the single molecule experiment was performed under a saturating ATP condition (2 mm), the apparent rates represent the ADP release rates from actomyosin. We measured the ADP release rates of the smooth myosin species by measuring the actomyosin dissociation rate in the presence of ADP induced by saturating ATP using HMM constructs: DHPHMM, SHPHMM, and UPHMM (supplemental text). As expected, the ADP release rate of DHPHMM (28.6 ± 1.6 s–1) was consistent with the rate obtained from the dwell time distribution of DHPMII (29.0 ± 0.2 s–1). Likewise, the ADP release rates of SHPHMM (27.4 ± 1.5 s–1) and UPMII (12.1 ± 0.8 s–1) were consistent with the faster rates of SHPMII (24.2 ± 0.6 s–1) and UPMII (12.3 ± 0.7 s–1) obtained from the dwell time distributions (Fig. 2C). The ADP release rates of the RLC exchanged HMMs of DHPHMM (pFpF) and UPHMM (dHdH) were almost identical to those of RLC unexchanged controls (pp and dd, respectively) (supplemental Table S2), suggesting that the RLC exchange procedure and the FLAG or the hexahistidine tag of RLC do not impair the motor activity of smooth muscle myosin. The ADP release rate of S1 was ∼25 s–1. A similar rate has been reported previously (24Cremo C.R. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1969-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The rate is comparable with the faster ADP release rates of DHP and SHP. The results are consistent with the notion that S1 is as active as the phosphorylated head of the double-headed form (DHP). A slow ADP release rate of SHPHMM and UPHMM that was expected from the slow dwell time distribution (Fig. 2C) was not evident. If both heads of single molecule SHPHMM or single molecule UPHMM simultaneously bind to actin in the presence of ADP, we should be able to observe the slow rate predominantly because the acto-HMM dissociation should be limited by the slow interaction. However, we could not observe the slow ADP release rate for SHPHMM and UPHMM clearly. It is possible that the phosphorylated head of SHPMII is fully active, whereas the unphosphorylated head is partially active, and that only the fully active head of SHPMII preferentially binds to actin in the presence of ADP, and thus we observed that the ADP release rate originated only from the phosphorylated head. In the case of UPHMM, it is reported that the two heads interact asymmetrically with each other (25Wendt T. Taylor D. Trybus K.M. Taylor K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4361-4366Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Thus it is possible that the motor property of the two heads is distinct because of the asymmetric interaction and that only one of the two heads with faster ADP release rate predominantly binds to actin in the presence of ADP. To verify this possibility, we examined whether two heads of DHPHMM, SHPHMM, and UPHMM bind to actin in the presence of ADP using pyrene-labeled actin. It has been known that the fluorescence intensity of pyrene-actin decreases upon binding of myosin. Pyrene-labeled actin was mixed with substoichiometric concentration of DHPHMM (pp), SHPMII (pdH and pFdH), or UPHMM (dd) in the presence of 0.2 mm ADP, and the decrease in pyrene fluorescence intensity was monitored. The degree of the fluorescence change was compared under the same condition (supplemental Fig. S3). S1 was used as control for the fluorescence change upon complete binding of the myosin head. The binding of DHPHMM (pp) to actin decreased the fluorescence intensity of pyrene-actin to a similar extent as S1, suggesting that both heads of DHPHMM bind to actin in the presence of ADP. The result is consistent with previous studies (26Berger C.E. Fagnant P.M. Heizmann S. Trybus K.M. Geeves M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23240-23245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 27Ellison P.A. DePew Z.S. Cremo C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4410-4415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The decrement of pyrene fluorescence intensity induced by the binding of SHPHMM (pdH and pFdH) was approximately half of that induced by DHPHMM (pp), suggesting that only one of the two heads of SHPHMM preferentially binds to actin in the presence of ADP. The actin binding affinity of the unphosphorylated head may be lower than that of the phosphorylated head, and therefore, the binding of the unphosphorylated head may be interfered easily by an intramolecular strain induced when both heads bind to actin. The decrement of pyrene fluorescence intensity induced by the binding of UPHMM (dd) was also approximately half of that induced by DHPHMM (pp), suggesting that only one of the two heads of UPHMM preferentially binds to actin in the presence of ADP in our experimental condition. Therefore, we think that the slow ADP release rates of SHPHMM and UPHMM, which we expected to observe in our kinetics experiment, were simply unmeasurable under our experimental condition. The lower frequency of the slow actin interaction of SHPMII (8%; Fig. 2C) may indicate the lower affinity of the unphosphorylated head of SHPMII to actin. Note that the property of the unphosphorylated head of UPHMM is probably different from that of SHPHMM, because the faster actomyosin interaction rate of UPMII (12 s–1) did not match the rates observed for SHPMII (Fig. 2C), although we do not know the molecular mechanism causing this difference at this point. Displacements of Actin Filament—To further examine the mechanical interplays of the smooth muscle myosin species and actin, we analyzed the step size distributions (Fig. 3). Both DHPMII and SHPMII showed positive net displacements, whereas UPMII showed almost zero net displacement, which is consistent with the fact that UPMII did not translocate actin in the in vitro motility assay (Fig. 1C). The large average step sizes of DHPMII and SHPMII are explained by multiples of the unitary step size of ∼5.3 nm as reported previously for skeletal muscle myosin (28Kitamura K. Tokunaga M. Iwane A.H. Yanagida T. Nature. 1999; 397: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Because two distinct dwell time distributions were evident in SHPMII and UPMII, the step size distributions were further analyzed separately for the shorter dwell times and for the longer (prolonged) dwell times (Fig. 3, B and C). We separated the dwell time distributions at 0.1 s for SHPMII and 0.2 s for UPMII, because over 90% of their shorter dwell time phases were estimated to complete in 0.1 s (SHPMII) and 0.2 s (UPMII) based on their apparent rates of 24.2 s–1 (SHPMII) and 12.3 s–1 (UPMII), respectively. An important finding is that both the shorter and the longer actin interactions of SHPMII had a positive net mechanical displacement, whereas those of UPMII did not, suggesting that the apparently slow actomyosin interaction of SHPMII is the active mechanical one that is qualitatively different from those of UPMII. Fraction of SHPMII during the Latch State—Although it is not readily feasible to experimentally distinguish SHPMII from UPMII or DHPMII in smooth muscle tissues during the latch state, it is possible to estimate the fractions of these smooth muscle myosin species based on currently available data. Because phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of smooth muscle myosin by MLCK and MLCP have been reported to occur randomly (9Ogawa Y. Sato O. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1998; 453: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar, 10Trybus K.M. Lowey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15988-15995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the reaction scheme of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of smooth muscle myosin in smooth muscles can be simply described as follows, UPMII⇄kMLCKSHPMII⇄kMLCKDHPMII REACTION 1 where kMLCK and kMLCP are the reaction rate constants of phosphorylation by MLCK and dephosphorylation by MLCP, respectively. Based on this reaction scheme, the fractions of UPMII, SHPMII, and DHPMII during the latch state where the total phosphorylation level is 20–30% (11Berne, R. M. (2004) Physiology, 5th Ed., p. 255, Mosby, St. Louis, MOGoogle Scholar) are estimated to be 56–68, 24–29, and 8–15%, respectively. Because UPMII does not have actin translocating activity, the motor activity of SHPMII is expected to predominantly determine the contractile state of smooth muscles during the latch state. It is known that in tonic smooth muscles agonist stimulation transiently increases the myoplasmic Ca2+ concentration to 300–500 nm at the peak contraction. After the initial spike, the myoplasmic Ca2+ concentration plummets, but it is maintained at a level higher than the resting state during the latch state (29Somlyo A.P. Himpens B. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 2266-2276Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 30Moore E.D. Becker P.L. Itoh T. Fay F.S. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1991; 304: 171-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). MLCP activity is regulated by the Rho/Rho kinase pathway (31Kitazawa T. Gaylinn B.D. Denney G.H. Somlyo A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1708-1715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Kitazawa T. Somlyo A.P. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1991; 304: 97-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and the activity is down-regulated to ½ to ⅓ after the agonist stimulation (33Kitazawa T. Masuo M. Somlyo A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9307-9310Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 34Nakamura K. Koga Y. Sakai H. Homma K. Ikebe M. Circ. Res. 2007; 101: 712-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). By taking this evidence into account, the relative activities of MLCK and MLCP during the smooth muscle contraction were defined as shown in Fig. 4A. Based on this, we performed computer simulation to follow the fractional changes of UPMII, SHPMII, and DHPMII during the tonic smooth muscle contraction (Fig. 4B). As expected, the fraction of DHPMII transiently increased accompanied by the down-regulation of MLCP activity and the transient activation of MLCK caused by the transient increase of the myoplasmic Ca2+ concentration (3D. J., Hartshorne. (1987) in Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract (Johnson, D. R., Ed) 2nd Ed., pp. 423–482, Raven, New YorkGoogle Scholar, 4Adelstein R.S. Sellers J.R. Am. J.

Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 2004; 359: 1921-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). During this phase, the fractions of UPMII and SHPMII were kept at a very low level. Shortening of smooth muscles with fast cross-bridge cycling is expected to take place during this phase. The DHPMII level then decreased accompanied by the inactivation of MLCK activity caused by the decrement of the myoplasmic Ca2+ concentration. It is important to note that the fraction of SHPMII increased after the peak [Ca2+]in accompanied by the decrement of the fraction of DHPMII. During the later phase (latch state), the fraction of SHPMII reached ∼26%, whereas that of DHPMII decreased to ∼11%. This gave an overall phosphorylation level of ∼24%, which is consistent with the apparent overall phosphorylation level of 20–30% during the latch state (11Berne, R. M. (2004) Physiology, 5th Ed., p. 255, Mosby, St. Louis, MOGoogle Scholar). Our result suggests that the population of SHPMII dominates over the population of DHPMII ∼2–3 times during the latch state. Motor Property of SHPMII—Our result implies that the motor activities of the two heads of SHPMII are distinct from each other; the phosphorylated head is as active as the phosphorylated heads of DHPMII, whereas the unphosphorylated head is partially active in terms of actin translocating activity and the ADP release rate. It should be emphasized that the motor property of the unphosphorylated head of SHPMII is completely different from the unphosphorylated head of UPMII, because both the fast and the slow actomyosin interactions of SHPMII showed positive net displacement in contrast to those of UPMII (Fig. 3, B and C). The unique mechanical property of SHPMII is also manifested in its nonuniform actin translocation activity (see supplemental movies). We think that the frequently intermitted actin filament movement is due to the slow sustained actin binding of the unphosphorylated head of SHPMII. This intermitted actin movement was not observed for the mixture of DHPMII and UPMII, suggesting the unique mechanical activity of the dephosphorylated head of SHPMII. Because it has been shown that the interaction between the two heads is critical to stabilize the inhibitory conformation of smooth muscle and nonmuscle type myosin (25Wendt T. Taylor D. Trybus K.M. Taylor K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4361-4366Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 35Wendt T. Taylor D. Messier T. Trybus K.M. Taylor K.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1385-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), it is possible that the activation of one head partially releases the inhibitory effect on the other head. The overall ATPase cycle rate of smooth muscle myosin represents the phosphate release rate, which limits the actin-activated ATP hydrolysis cycle. Phosphate release is thought to occur either concomitant with or immediately after the formation of the strongly actin-bound state, and thus this rate determines the rate of formation of the strong actin-bound state (actomyosin-ADP). On the other hand, the ADP release rate, together with the step size, determines the actin translocating velocity under saturating ATP condition. Therefore, if ADP release rate is much faster than the overall ATPase turnover rate, the ATP turnover rate and the actin translocating rate should be separately discussed. In the present study, we also measured the single ATPase turnover rates of DHPHMM, SHPHMM, and UPHMM. The result was very similar to that reported previously by Ellison et al. (17Ellison P.A. Sellers J.R. Cremo C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15142-15151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar); the ATPase turnover rate of SHPHMM was much less than 50% of that of DHPHMM (data not shown). The result suggests that the actin binding rates of both heads of SHPMII in the myosin-ADP-Pi state are significantly reduced compared with DHPMII. Thus it is anticipated that the slow phosphate release rates contribute to reduce the number of myosin molecule being involved in the actin translocation. This low ATPase turnover rate of SHPMII can explain the low ATP consumption of smooth muscles during the latch state. Physiological Relevance of the Motor Property of SHPMII to the Latch State—Smooth muscle myosin molecules form side polar filaments and interact with actin to generate large force as a whole. In such a circumstance, if some myosin molecules in the myosin filament interact with actin for prolonged period of time, such slow interactions would interfere with cross-bridge cycling of other myosin molecules (thus reduce the overall cycling rate) while maintaining the force. We propose that the unique mechanical activity of SHPMII explains well the sustained force with low energy consumption of tonic smooth muscle during the latch state. Consistency with Other Studies—Two independent studies mainly focusing on the ATP turnover rate of SHP have been reported (17Ellison P.A. Sellers J.R. Cremo C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15142-15151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 36Rovner A.S. Fagnant P.M. Trybus K.M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 5280-5289Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Ellison et al. (17Ellison P.A. Sellers J.R. Cremo C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15142-15151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) concluded that the ATP turnover rate of SHP is less than 20% of that of DHP, whereas Rovner et al. (36Rovner A.S. Fagnant P.M. Trybus K.M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 5280-5289Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) concluded that the ATP turnover rate of SHP is more than 50% of that of DHP. The ATP turnover rate of SHPHMM obtained in our single turnover experiment was ∼30% of that of DHPHMM (not shown), which is similar to the results of Ellison et al. The discrepancy may arise from the regulatory light chain used in these studies. Ellison et al. and the present study used the regulatory light chain with intact phosphorylation sites (Thr18 and Ser19), whereas Rovner et al. used a mutant regulatory light chain (T18A/S19A). It is possible that the T18A/S19A mutant does not properly mimic the unphosphorylated state of the regulatory light chain, although apparently it does not show the actin-activated ATPase activity and the motility activity when it is incorporated into the both heads. Another inconsistency among these studies is found in the actin translocating velocity. Although all of the groups found reduction of actin translocating velocity in SHP compared with DHP, the degrees of the reduction are very different from one another: 50–60%(17Ellison P.A. Sellers J.R. Cremo C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15142-15151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), 10–20%(36Rovner A.S. Fagnant P.M. Trybus K.M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 5280-5289Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and 70–80% (this study). It is possible that the variation in the degree of the reduction (20 ∼ 80%) arises from the nonuniform movement of actin filaments by SHP as observed in the present study (supplemental Movie S2).

https://openalex.org/W1967941831,"Human DNA topoisomerase I (topo I) is an essential mammalian enzyme that regulates DNA supercoiling during transcription and replication. In addition, topo I is specifically targeted by the anticancer compound camptothecin and its derivatives. Previous studies have indicated that topo I is a phosphoprotein and that phosphorylation stimulates its DNA relaxation activity. The locations of most topo I phosphorylation sites have not been identified, preventing a more detailed examination of this modification. To address this issue, mass spectrometry was used to identify four topo I residues that are phosphorylated in intact cells: Ser(10), Ser(21), Ser(112), and Ser(394). Immunoblotting using anti-phosphoepitope antibodies demonstrated that these sites are phosphorylated during mitosis. In vitro kinase assays demonstrated that Ser(10) can be phosphorylated by casein kinase II, Ser(21) can be phosphorylated by protein kinase Calpha, and Ser(112) and Ser(394) can be phosphorylated by Cdk1. When wild type topo I was pulled down from mitotic cells and dephosphorylated with alkaline phosphatase, topo I activity decreased 2-fold. Likewise, topo I polypeptide with all four phosphorylation sites mutated to alanine exhibited 2-fold lower DNA relaxation activity than wild type topo I after isolation from mitotic cells. Further mutational analysis demonstrated that Ser(21) phosphorylation was responsible for this change. Consistent with these results, wild type topo I (but not S21A topo I) exhibited increased sensitivity to camptothecin-induced trapping on DNA during mitosis. Collectively these results indicate that topo I is phosphorylated during mitosis at multiple sites, one of which enhances DNA relaxation activity in vitro and interaction with DNA in cells."
https://openalex.org/W2011581898,"Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is characterized by reciprocal balanced chromosomal translocations involving retinoic acid receptor-α (RARα). RARα heterodimerizes with the retinoid X receptor-α (RXRα) and transcriptionally regulates myeloid differentiation in response to ATRA (all-trans retinoic acid). Several lines of evidence suggest that APL fusion proteins interact with RXRα. To elucidate the role of RXRα in APL, we conditionally knocked out RXRα in the hCG-NuMA-RARα APL mouse model. Phenotype analysis of NuMA-RARα+ mice demonstrated that these mice developed a myeloproliferative disease-like myeloid leukemia within 4 months of birth. While hemizygous and homozygous RXRα conditional knockout mice were phenotypically normal as late as 12 months of age, we observed that the leukemic phenotype in NuMA-RARα+ mice was dependent on the presence of functional RXRα. Bone marrow promyelocyte counts were significantly reduced in NuMA-RARα+ mice with RXRα knocked down. Significant differences in the accumulations of Gr-1+ and Mac-1+ cells were also seen. We further observed that genes previously identified to be cooperating events in APL were also regulated in an RXRα-dependent manner. We therefore propose that the APL fusion protein NuMA-RARα cooperates with RXRα in the development of leukemia in hCG-NuMA-RARα transgenic mice and suggest a novel role for RXRα in the pathogenesis of APL."
