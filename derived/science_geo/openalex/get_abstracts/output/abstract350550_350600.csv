https://openalex.org/W2027816595,"The erythrocytes of certain individuals possess the capacity to undergo reversible changes in shape in response to changes in the partial pressure of oxygen. When the oxygen pressure is lowered, these cells change their forms from the normal biconcave disk to crescent, holly wreath, and other forms. This process is known as sickling. About 8 percent of American Negroes possess this characteristic; usually they exhibit no pathological consequences ascribable to it. These people are said to have sicklemia, or sickle cell trait. However, about 1 in 40 (4) of these individuals whose cells are capable of sickling suffer from a severe chronic anemia resulting from excessive destruction of their erythrocytes; the term sickle cell anemia is applied to their condition."
https://openalex.org/W2076425088,"Specificity of protein ubiquitylation is conferred by E3 ubiquitin (Ub) ligases. We have annotated ∼617 putative E3s and substrate-recognition subunits of E3 complexes encoded in the human genome. The limited knowledge of the function of members of the large E3 superfamily prompted us to generate genome-wide E3 cDNA and RNAi expression libraries designed for functional screening. An imaging-based screen using these libraries to identify E3s that regulate mitochondrial dynamics uncovered MULAN/FLJ12875, a RING finger protein whose ectopic expression and knockdown both interfered with mitochondrial trafficking and morphology. We found that MULAN is a mitochondrial protein – two transmembrane domains mediate its localization to the organelle's outer membrane. MULAN is oriented such that its E3-active, C-terminal RING finger is exposed to the cytosol, where it has access to other components of the Ub system. Both an intact RING finger and the correct subcellular localization were required for regulation of mitochondrial dynamics, suggesting that MULAN's downstream effectors are proteins that are either integral to, or associated with, mitochondria and that become modified with Ub. Interestingly, MULAN had previously been identified as an activator of NF-κB, thus providing a link between mitochondrial dynamics and mitochondria-to-nucleus signaling. These findings suggest the existence of a new, Ub-mediated mechanism responsible for integration of mitochondria into the cellular environment."

To assess the specificity of galectin-glycan interactions in more detail, we explored the binding of several important galectins (Gal-1, Gal-2, and Gal-3) using a dose-response approach toward a glycan microarray containing hundreds of structurally diverse glycans, and we compared these results to binding determinants on cells. All three galectins exhibited differences in glycan binding characteristics. On both the microarray and on cells, Gal-2 and Gal-3 exhibited higher binding than Gal-1 to fucose-containing A and B blood group antigens. Gal-2 exhibited significantly reduced binding to all sialylated glycans, whereas Gal-1 bound α2-3- but not α2-6-sialylated glycans, and Gal-3 bound to some glycans terminating in either α2-3- or α2-6-sialic acid. The effects of sialylation on Gal-1, Gal-2, and Gal-3 binding to cells also reflected differences in cellular sensitivity to Gal-1-, Gal-2-, and Gal-3-induced phosphatidylserine exposure. Each galectin exhibited higher binding for glycans with poly-N-acetyllactosamine (poly(LacNAc)) sequences (Galβ1-4GlcNAc)n when compared with N-acetyllactosamine (LacNAc) glycans (Galβ1-4GlcNAc). However, only Gal-3 bound internal LacNAc within poly(LacNAc). These results demonstrate that each of these galectins mechanistically differ in their binding to glycans on the microarrays and that these differences are reflected in the determinants required for cell binding and signaling. The specific glycan recognition by each galectin underscores the basis for differences in their biological activities.

FEBS Lett. 1992; 307: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). In addition, whereas Gal-1 inhibits acute inflammatory responses through various mechanisms, including suppression of phospholipase A2-induced edema (11Rabinovich G.A. Sotomayor C.E. Riera C.M.

Interestingly, patients with reduced Gal-2 expression were found to have reduced risk for myocardial infarction, suggesting that Gal-2 may also have pro-inflammatory roles (13Ozaki K. Inoue K.

Furthermore, Gal-1, Gal-2, and Gal-3 have all been reported to signal T cells through different receptors (14Hahn H.P. Pang M. He J. Hernandez J.D. Yang R.Y. Li L.Y. Wang X. Liu F.T. Baum L.G.

These types of studies suggest that Gal-1, Gal-2, and Gal-3 recognize distinct receptors on leukocytes. human galectin β-mercaptoethanol N-acetyllactosamine (Galβ1GlcNAc) poly-N-acetyllactosamine (Galβ1-4GlcNAc)n surface plasmon resonance carbohydrate recognition domain glycan-binding protein phosphate-buffered saline phosphatidylserine fluorescein isothiocyanate Chinese hamster ovary L. esculentum agglutinin R. communis agglutinin-I N-glycan. human galectin β-mercaptoethanol N-acetyllactosamine (Galβ1GlcNAc) poly-N-acetyllactosamine (Galβ1-4GlcNAc)n surface plasmon resonance carbohydrate recognition domain glycan-binding protein phosphate-buffered saline phosphatidylserine fluorescein isothiocyanate Chinese hamster ovary L. esculentum agglutinin R. communis agglutinin-I N-glycan. There is compelling evidence, however, that different galectins may also recognize related receptors. For example, Gal-3 attenuates Gal-1 inhibition of growth in neuroblastoma cells at the receptor level, and both Gal-1 and Gal-3 induce superoxide production in human neutrophils (17Almkvist J. Dahlgren C. Leffler H. Karlsson A. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 4034-4041Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 18Almkvist J. Faldt J. Dahlgren C. Leffler H. Karlsson A. Infect.

Gal-1 and Gal-2 both induce surface exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS) in activated human neutrophils in the absence of apoptosis through a Ca2+-dependent pathway (20Karmakar S. Cummings R.D. McEver R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28623-28631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Therefore, although Gal-1, Gal-2, and Gal-3 may recognize discrete glycoconjugates, they may also recognize some common receptors. In this way, galectins likely exhibit unique versatility in a wide range of biological functions (3Leffler H. Carlsson S. Hedlund M. Qian Y. Poirier F. Glycoconj. J. 2004; 19: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 4Ilarregui J.M. Bianco G.A. Toscano M.A. Rabinovich G.A. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 2005; 64 (iv): 96-103Google Scholar). Although some differences have been reported in glycan recognition by these galectins (21Hirabayashi J. Hashidate T. Arata Y. Nishi N. Nakamura T. Hirashima M. Urashima T. Oka T. Futai M. Muller W.E.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6342-6349Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), there are many questions remaining about their glycan recognition and subsequent effects on galectin binding. It has been suggested that differences in the biological effects of Gal-1 and Gal-3 result from differences in tertiary structure, rather than ligand binding properties (29Perillo N.L. Pace K.E. Seilhamer J.J. Baum L.G. Nature. 1995; 378: 736-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar, 30Ahmad N. Gabius H.J. Andre S. Kaltner H. Sabesan S. Roy R. Liu B. Macaluso F. Brewer C.F. J. Biol.

Barondes S.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 260-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Tertiary structure differences may contribute to differences in cellular responses to different galectins (30Ahmad N. Gabius H.J. Andre S. Kaltner H. Sabesan S. Roy R. Liu B. Macaluso F. Brewer C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10841-10847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 32Nieminen J. Kuno A. Hirabayashi J. Sato S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 1374-1383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar); however, Gal-3 can form homo-oligomeric structures (32Nieminen J. Kuno A. Hirabayashi J. Sato S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 1374-1383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), which supports the likelihood that the major differences in biological functions by these lectins are because of differences in glycan recognition. Previous studies on glycan recognition by galectins and most other glycan-binding proteins (GBPs) have been limited because of the availability and diversity of glycans tested (22Brewer C.F. Glycoconj. J. 2004; 19: 459-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This limitation arises from the difficulty of synthesizing a large diverse library of glycan structures (33Blixt O. Head S. Mondala T. Scanlan C. Huflejt M.E. Alvarez R. Bryan M.C. Fazio F. Calarese D. Stevens J. Razi N. Stevens D.J. Skehel J.J. van Die I. Burton D.R. Wilson I.A. Cummings R. Bovin N. Wong C.H. Paulson J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17033-17038Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). In addition, the methods of analysis may have also hindered the identification of differential specificity. For example, we recently found that the specificity of Gal-1 for glycans depends not only on the structure of glycans but also the mode of their presentation (34Leppanen A. Stowell S. Blixt O. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5549-5562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), either in solid phase or in solution. In equilibrium gel filtration assays, similar to other solution-based assays (21Hirabayashi J. Hashidate T. Arata Y. Nishi N. Nakamura T. Hirashima M. Urashima T. Oka T. Futai M. Muller W.E. Yagi F. Kasai K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1572: 232-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar, 22Brewer C.F. Glycoconj. J. 2004; 19: 459-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), Gal-1 binds glycans with a single N-acetyllactosamine (LacNAc) unit (Galβ1-4GlcNAc) equivalently to those with poly-N-acetyllactosamine (poly(LacNAc)) sequences (Galβ1-4GlcNAc)n; however, the dimeric form of Gal-1 showed a significant preference for the poly(LacNAc)-containing glycans in solid phase assays (34Leppanen A. Stowell S. Blixt O. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5549-5562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 35Stowell S.R. Dias-Baruffi M. Penttila L. Renkonen O. Nyame A.K. Cummings R.D. Glycobiology. 2004; 14: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Significantly, Gal-1 failed to recognize internal Lac-NAc units within poly(LacNAc) (34Leppanen A. Stowell S. Blixt O. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5549-5562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 35Stowell S.R. Dias-Baruffi M. Penttila L. Renkonen O. Nyame A.K. Cummings R.D. Glycobiology. 2004; 14: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), suggesting that this preference likely reflects favorable poly(LacNAc) conformational constraints of the terminal LacNAc unit that are enhanced by immobilization (34Leppanen A. Stowell S. Blixt O. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5549-5562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Gal-1 also recognized poly-(LacNAc)-containing glycans on leukocyte surfaces with a similar affinity as observed for immobilized poly(LacNAc) glycans (34Leppanen A. Stowell S. Blixt O. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5549-5562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), corroborating the reliability of the solid phase binding studies. Similarly, analyses of Gal-1, Gal-2, and Gal-3 utilizing frontal affinity chromatography or isothermal calorimetry, in which the glycans are free in solution, also do not reveal profound differences in carbohydrate recognition (21Hirabayashi J. Hashidate T. Arata Y. Nishi N. Nakamura T. Hirashima M. Urashima T. Oka T. Futai M. Muller W.E. Yagi F. Kasai K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1572: 232-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar, 22Brewer C.F. Glycoconj. J. 2004; 19: 459-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 36Ahmad N. Gabius H.J. Sabesan S. Oscarson S. Brewer C.F. Glycobiology. 2004; 14: 817-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), further suggesting that galectin-glycan interactions may be most usefully tested in the context of immobilized glycan presentation. However, whether Gal-2 and Gal-3 behave like Gal-1 in showing a different glycan preference when glycans are immobilized has not been studied, nor has the in vitro binding data been correlated to binding determinants on cell surfaces. These issues prompted us to evaluate Gal-1, Gal-2, and Gal-3 interactions using immobilized glycans in a glycan microarray format that includes several hundred structurally diverse glycans (33Blixt O. Head S. Mondala T. Scanlan C. Huflejt M.E. Alvarez R. Bryan M.C. Fazio F. Calarese D. Stevens J. Razi N. Stevens D.J. Skehel J.J. van Die I. Burton D.R. Wilson I.A. Cummings R. Bovin N. Wong C.H.

To more accurately determine the binding specificity of Gal-1, Gal-2, and Gal-3 using the glycan microarray format, we evaluated binding of each galectin over a broad concentration range. This allowed us to extrapolate a binding isotherm for each galectin toward each respective glycan. To determine whether the specificity obtained using this method reflected similar binding patterns toward cells, we tested the binding toward promyelocytic HL60 cells, which respond to signals by these galectins resulting in exposure of surface PS (38Stowell S.R.

Our results provide novel insights into differential glycan recognition by each of these galectins and provide support for using glycan microarrays in conjunction with cell binding studies to explore glycan recognition by glycan-binding proteins (33Blixt O.

Preparation of Human Gal-1, Gal-2, and Gal-3—Human galectins were prepared as outlined previously (35Stowell S.R. Dias-Baruffi M. Penttila L. Renkonen O. Nyame A.K. Cummings R.D.

Each recombinant galectin was purified by affinity chromatography on lactosyl-Sepharose, and bound lectin was eluted with 100 mm lactose in PBS, 14 mm βME. Prior to derivatization, βME was removed from galectin samples by utilizing a PD-10 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare), followed by the addition of lactose (100 mm final concentration) to help maintain the stability of each galectin and reduce the likelihood of adduct formation at or near the carbohydrate recognition domain. Alexa Fluor 488-labeled forms of galectins were prepared using either Alexa Fluor 488 C5-maleimide or Alexa Fluor 488 carboxylic acid, succinimidyl ester, dilithium salt-reactive dyes (Molecular Probes) as described (35Stowell S.R. Dias-Baruffi M. Penttila L. Renkonen O. Nyame A.K. Cummings R.D. Glycobiology. 2004; 14: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We found that derivatization of Gal-2 with Alexa dyes substantially decreased the stability of the protein; thus, all studies assessing Gal-2 glycan recognition utilized biotinylated Gal-2. Galectins were biotinylated by incubating 3-5 mg/ml of each galectin with 2 mm EZ-link™ Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (sulfosuccinimidyl-6-(biotinamido)hexanoate) (Pierce) for 2 h at 4 °C. Unconjugated EZ-link™ Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin and free lactose were separated from galectin using a PD-10 gel filtration column. Galectins were re-chromatographed over lactosyl-Sepharose to remove any inactive material following labeling. Bound galectin was eluted with 100 mm lactose, then applied to a PD-10 gel filtration column to remove lactose, and stored at 4 °C in 14 mm βME in PBS until further use. Control lectins, peanut agglutinin (Arachis hypogaea) (200 μg/ml), Ricinus communis agglutinin I (RCA-I) (2 μg/ml), Sambucus nigra agglutinin (200 μg/ml), and Lycopersicon esculentum agglutinin (LEA) (200 μg/ml) were purchased from Vector Laboratories and utilized under the same assay conditions as Gal-1, Gal-2, and Gal-3. Cholera toxin subunit B (Molecular Probes) was also assayed under the same conditions at 200 μg/ml. Binding of Galectin to Aminoalkyl Glycosides Immobilized on Activated (N-Hydroxysuccinimidyl) Glass Surface—Glycan microarrays were prepared as described previously (33Blixt O. Head S. Mondala T.

For galectin recognition of glycans on the printed glycan microarray, a solution of between 0.1 and 10 μm galectin in PBS containing 0.005% Tween 20 and 14 mm βME was incubated for 1 h at 25 °C. The slide was then immersed in PBS containing 0.005% Tween 20, drained, and then overlaid with FITC-streptavidin. After 1 h at room temperature in a dark humid chamber, the slide was washed by successive immersion in PBS, 0.01% Tween 20 (three times) and water, 0.1% Tween 20 (twice). The slide was briefly rinsed with distilled water and dried under microfiltered air. An image of bound fluorescence was obtained using a microarray scanner (Scan Array Express, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The integrated spot intensities were determined using Metamorph software (Universal Imaging, Downingtown, PA). Measurement of Galectin Binding Affinity Using Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)—All surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments were performed at 25 °C on a Biacore 3000 instrument (Biacore AB (part of GE Healthcare)) largely as outlined previously (33Blixt O.

Biotinylated glycosides were captured on research grade streptavidin-coated sensor chips (Sensor Chip SA, Biacore Inc.) that were pretreated according to the manufacturer's instructions. A solution of each biotinylated glycoside (10 fmol/ml) was injected at 2 ml/min in PBS, pH 7, containing 0.005% Tween 20 (running buffer) for varying lengths of time (3-7 min) until an optimal amount of glycan was captured on each independent surface. Three related glycosides were studied using one streptavidin sensor chip. A control (nonbinding) glycan, arabinose, was also captured on the same sensor chip, and the specific binding of nonderivatized recombinant Gal-1, Gal-2, or Gal-3 for the test glycans was measured using the in-line reference subtraction feature of the Biacore 3000 instrument. Increasing concentrations of Gal-1, Gal-2, or Gal-3 (0.1-100 μm) were injected at a flow rate of 60 ml/min over all four surfaces of the sensor chip. Bound Gal-1, Gal-2, or Gal-3 were eluted with the running buffer after the injection was complete. The equilibrium binding data of Gal-1, Gal-2, or Gal-3 were analyzed by nonlinear curve fitting using the BIAevaluation software (Biacore Inc.). Cell Culture—Promyelocytic leukemia HL60 cells were obtained from ATCC and maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in complete RPMI medium (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mm glutamine, 100 milliunits/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin). Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were maintained in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mm glutamine, 100 milliunits/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Enzymatic Deglycosylation—Prior to enzymatic deglycosylation, HL60 cells were fixed by washing three times in PBS at 4 °C, followed by resuspension in 2% paraformaldehyde buffered in PBS, pH 7.4, at 4 °C. Cells were allowed to fix overnight on a shaker at 4 °C. Following fixation, cells were washed three times in PBS and then two times in the appropriate buffer as recommended by the manufacturer. For enzymatic digestion of cell surface glycans, fixed cells were washed in the following buffers. Cells were washed in 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 6.0, and incubated with 250 milliunits of Salmonella typhimurium α2-3-neuraminidase (New England Biolabs) at 107 cells/ml for 12 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed in 50 mm sodium citrate with 100 mm sodium chloride, pH 6.0, and incubated with 250 milliunits of Clostridium perfringens α2-3-α2-6-neuraminidase (New England Biolabs) at 107 cells/ml for 12 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed in 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.8, and incubated with 200 milliunits of Escherichia freundii endo-β-galactosidase (Seikagaku Kogyo) at 107 cells/ml for 24 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed with 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 5.8, and incubated with 200 milliunits of Bacteroides fragilis endo-β-galactosidase (Calbiochem; QA Labs) at 107 cells/ml for 24 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 5.0, and incubated with 100 milliunits jack bean β-galactosidase (Glyko) at 107 cells/ml for 12 h. Buffer control treatments lacking enzymes were used for each individual condition. Galectin Binding to Cells—For lectin binding, cells were washed twice in PBS at 4 °C and incubated with biotinylated Gal-1, Gal-2, Gal-3, or the indicated plant lectins (LEA, RCA-I, and Maackia amurensis lectin II; Vector Laboratories) at a concentration of between 5 and 10 μg/ml at 4 °C for 1 h. As controls, cells were incubated with 50 mm lactose along with the galectins. Cells were washed three times and then incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 streptavidin or Alexa Fluor 633 streptavidin (Molecular Probes) at 4 °C for 1 h. Cells were then washed twice, followed by resuspension in 400 μl of PBS for analysis by flow cytometry using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). The bars in each graph represent the % change in binding when compared with the binding of control buffer treated cells from each enzymatic pair. Error bars in each graph represent standard deviation of duplicate analysis. Measuring Galectin-induced PS Exposure—For annexin-V staining, cells were treated for 1 h with 100 milliunits of Arthrobacter ureafaciens neuraminidase or buffer control (RPMI 1640 media or Hanks' balanced salt solution). Cells were washed following treatment in complete RPMI, followed by resuspension in complete RPMI at 106 cells/ml. Cells were treated with 20 μm Gal-1, Gal-2, or Gal-3 or at the concentrations indicated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 4 h followed by disengagement with 50 mm lactose and staining with annexin-V (CalTag) as outlined previously (38Stowell S.R.

https://openalex.org/W2024707130,"Place-specific firing in the hippocampus is determined by path integration-based spatial representations in the grid-cell network of the medial entorhinal cortex. Output from this network is conveyed directly to CA1 of the hippocampus by projections from principal neurons in layer III, but also indirectly by axons from layer II to the dentate gyrus and CA3. The direct pathway is sufficient for spatial firing in CA1, but it is not known whether similar firing can also be supported by the input from CA3. To test this possibility, we made selective lesions in layer III of medial entorhinal cortex by local infusion of the neurotoxin gamma-acetylenic GABA. Firing fields in CA1 became larger and more dispersed after cell loss in layer III, whereas CA3 cells, which receive layer II input, still had sharp firing fields. Thus, the direct projection is necessary for precise spatial firing in the CA1 place cell population."

Here we report that polymorphisms in the ABCB1 gene predict the response to antidepressant treatment in those depressed patients receiving drugs that have been identified as substrates of ABCB1 using abcb1ab double-knockout mice. Our results indicate that the combined consideration of both the medication's capacity to act as an ABCB1-transporter substrate and the patient's ABCB1 genotype are strong predictors for achieving a remission. This finding can be viewed as a further step into personalized antidepressant treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2033347933,"The expression of unconventional vesicular glutamate transporter VGLUT3 by neurons known to release a different classical transmitter has suggested novel roles for signaling by glutamate, but this distribution has raised questions about whether the protein actually contributes to glutamate release. We now report that mice lacking VGLUT3 are profoundly deaf due to the absence of glutamate release from hair cells at the first synapse in the auditory pathway. The early degeneration of some cochlear ganglion neurons in knockout mice also indicates an important developmental role for the glutamate released by hair cells before the onset of hearing. In addition, the mice exhibit primary, generalized epilepsy that is accompanied by remarkably little change in ongoing motor behavior. The glutamate release conferred by expression of VGLUT3 thus has an essential role in both function and development of the auditory pathway, as well as in the control of cortical excitability."

The ability of the GLP-1 receptor to regulate such diverse responses appears to result from its promiscuous G protein coupling and its actions to mediate intracellular receptor crosstalk. For example, GLP-1 is reported to enhance beta cell proliferation via transactivation of the EGF receptor (EGFR) and its downstream effector PI3K (13Buteau J. Roduit R. Susini S. Prentki M.

The canonical β-catenin-dependent Wnt signaling pathway is important in the modulation of cell proliferation, survival, migration and differentiation, and in organ development (14Gordon M.D. Nusse R.

In the absence of Wnt ligand, cytoplasmic β-catenin is phosphorylated by GSK3β (glycogen synthase kinase 3β), within a protein complex containing axin and adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein. The phosphorylation of β-catenin by GSK3β results in its ubiquination and degradation (inactivation) (15Moon R.T. Sci. STKE 2005. 2005; : CM1Google Scholar, 20Kikuchi A. Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Exp. Mol. Med. 2006; 38: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The binding of Wnt ligands to the frizzled receptors activates the intracellular protein, Dishevelled (Dvl), which inhibits APC-GSK3β-axin activity, leading to the accumulation of free cytosolic β-catenin. Subsequently, β-catenin translocates to the nucleus and forms a transcriptionally productive complex with members of the lymphocyte enhancer factor (LEF)/T cell factor (TCF) family of transcription factors, such as TCF7L2, to activate the expression of Wnt signaling target genes (19Willert K. Jones K.A. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 1394-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). The role of Wnt signaling in pancreas development and functions is unclear. The expression of several Wnt and frizzled receptor genes has been detected in the developing pancreatic mesenchyme and epithelium. Misexpression of Wnt1 and Wnt5a in the early foregut results in agenesis or hypoplasia of the pancreas, respectively (21Heller R.S. Klein T. Ling Z. Heimberg H. Katoh M. Madsen O.D. Serup P. Gene Expr. 2003; 11: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Deletion of β-catenin within the pancreatic epithelium results in either a loss (22Dessimoz J. Bonnard C. Huelsken J.

Ectopic stabilization of β-catenin deregulates the normal mechanisms that control embryonic pancreas formation and postnatal organ growth (24Heiser P.W. Lau J. Taketo M.M. Herrera P.L. Hebrok M. Development (Camb.). 2006; 133: 2023-2032Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Based on a preliminary study of pancreatic islet gene expression profiling on microarrays, we recognized that GLP-1 and Exd4 induced the expression of genes in both the Wnt signaling pathway per se and target genes of the Wnt signaling pathway (Table S1). These genes are activated by the transcriptional complex of β-catenin and TCF/LEF. These microarray findings prompted us to examine in greater detail the regulation of Wnt signaling in pancreatic beta cells by GLP-1 agonists and the role of Wnt signaling in the GLP-1 agonist stimulation of beta cell proliferation. In this study, we examined the Exd4 activation of Wnt signaling in isolated islets and the INS-1 beta cell line using a β-catenin/TCF-activated reporter gene assay and found that GLP-1 and Exd4 enhance Wnt signaling. By using specific protein kinase inhibitors, dominant-negative isoforms of the kinases and of TCF7L2, and siRNA knockdown of β-catenin, we find that the basal Wnt signaling is dependent on endogenous Wnt ligands and requires active Akt and the inactivation of GSK3β. In marked contrast, GLP-1 and Exd4 activate Wnt signaling through the GLP-1 receptor coupled to the activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), and the prosurvival kinase Akt/PKB, independent of GSK3β. Exd4-mediated activation of PKA phosphorylates β-catenin on Ser-675, a mechanism that appears to stabilize β-catenin and to enhance TCF7-L2 activation of gene expression in beta cells. We also provide evidence that active Wnt signaling stimulates the proliferation of beta cells as a dominant-negative TCF7L2 inhibits both basal and Exd4-stimulated INS-1 cell proliferation. Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—INS-1 cells (insulin-producing strain obtained from C. Wolheim, Geneva, Switzerland) were maintained in RPMI supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 μg/ml), and streptomycin (0.25 μg/ml) at 37 °C under 5% CO2 and at 95% humidity. Transfections were done with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's manual. For stable transfections, INS-1 cells were cotransfected with pcDNA3-myc-dnTCF7L2, encoding the dominant-negative mutant of TCF7L2 (dnTCF7L2), or a control empty vector and puromycin vector, containing a puromycin-selectable marker. Two days after their transfection, cells were selected for resistance to puromycin for 2 weeks. Puromycin-resistant clones were screened for dnTCF7L2 expression with a Myc monoclonal antibody against the Myc epitope after 2 weeks of selection, and positive clones were pooled. Plasmids—The TOPflash and FOPflash luciferase vectors were gifts from R. Moon, University of Washington. Dominant-negative form of the regulatory subunit of PKA was from G. S. McKnight, University of Washington. Dominant-negative form of the PI3K was from J. Du, Baylor College of Medicine. Dominant-negative forms of CREB were from Clontech. Isolated Mouse Pancreatic Islets—Mouse islets were isolated from the pancreata of TOPGAL mice transgenic for the LEF-lacZ Wnt signaling reporter (25Lacy P.E. Mt. Sinai J. Med. 1994; 61: 23-31PubMed Google Scholar). Freshly isolated islets were treated for 4 h with Exd4 with and without the addition of the PKA inhibitor H89 or the GLP-1R antagonist Exd-(9-39). β-Galactosidase activity was determined by incubation of the islets with X-gal for 6 h. For BrdUrd proliferation assay, islets were treated with 0.01% trypsin for 5 min while lightly disrupting them with a pipette. Islets were then resuspended in a mixture of media and/or retrovirus and then spun down at 2000 rpm for 60 min. Wnt Signaling Luciferase Reporter Assay (TOPflash)—INS-1 cells were plated into 24-well dishes 24 h before transfection with TOPflash (1 μg/well) or FOPflash (1 μg/well) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Various concentrations of GLP-1 or Exd4 were then added to the culture medium 24 h following transfection for the indicated times. In studies in which inhibitors were used, LY294002 (10 μm), AG1478 (10 μm), H89 (10 μm), U0126 (10 μm), PD98059 (10 μm), SB203580 (1 μm), or Akt inhibitor IV (10 nm) were added concomitantly with Exd4. In studies in which wild-type, dominant-negative (dn), or constitutively active (ca) forms of kinase were used, dnPI3K, dnPKA, caPKA, dnGSK3β, caGSK3β, wild-type CREB, dnCREB, dnAkt, or caAkt (0.5 μg/well) was co-transfected with TOPflash. Luciferase activity in transfected cells was determined with a luciferase assay kit (Promega). Cyclic AMP-response Element Luciferase Reporter Assay—INS-1 cells were plated into 24-well dishes 24 h before transfection with cAMP-response element (CRE) luciferase (1 μg/well) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Various concentrations of GLP-1 or Exd4 were then added to the culture medium 24 h following transfection for the indicated time. dnTCF7L2 Retroviral Plasmids and Retroviral Infection of INS-1 Cells and Isolated Islets—A dnTCF7L2 fragment was subcloned into the BamHI and XhoI sites of retroviral vector pBMN (Orbigen). Retrovirus was prepared by transfecting phoenix cells with control (pBMN) or dnTCF7L2 retroviral vector (pBMN-dnTCF7L2). Virus-containing medium was collected 36 h after transfection and passed through a 0.45-μm syringe filter. Polybrene (hexadimethrine bromide; Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 8 μg/ml. This medium was then applied to subconfluent (50%) INS-1 cells (10-cm plates) or isolated islets for 36 h, and the infected cells were used in the subsequent cell proliferation assay. Wnt3A Conditioned Media—Wnt3A conditioned media and blank conditioned media were obtained from the ATCC. Wnt3A conditioned medium was prepared from TH L-M(TK-) cells transfected with a Wnt3A expression vector and selected in medium containing G418. Selected stable clones encode a secreted biologically active Wnt3A protein. Blank conditioned medium was collected from a parental cell line. Mfz8CRD-IgG Conditioned Media—Mfz8CRD-IgG was produced in 293 cells that were transiently transfected by the mfz8CRD-IgG cDNA (a kind gift from Dr. J. Nathans, The Johns Hopkins University) using Lipofectamine 2000. One day after transfection, cells were transferred to serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and the conditioned medium was harvested after an additional 24 h. Control conditioned medium was obtained from untransfected 293 cells. Real Time RT-PCR—Real time RT-PCR was carried out by using the SYBR® Green QPCR kit (Stratagene). Briefly, INS-1 cells were treated with 10 nm Exd4 or PBS vehicle control for 4 h. Total RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using Super-Script II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). PCR was performed to amplify cyclin D1 by using the following primers, forward 5′-TGTTTGAGACCTTCAACACC-3′ and reverse 5′-CCAGACAGCACTGTGTTGGC-3′, and to amplify Myc by using the following primers, forward 5′-CTGCTCTCCGTCCTATGTTG-3′ and reverse 5′-CCTGGATGATGATGTTCTTGATG-3′. For measurements of β-galactosidase and mRNA levels, real time quantitative PCR was used. Isolated islets prepared from TOPGAL mice were treated with 10 nm Exd4 or PBS vehicle control for 4 h. Total RNA was prepared from isolated islets of TOPGAL mice and reverse-transcribed to cDNA. Real time RT-PCR was performed to amplify the β-galactosidase encoding lacZ transcript by using the following primers, forward 5′-GTACGGCAGTTATCTGGAAG-3′ and reverse 5′-CATAACCACCACGCTCATCG-3′. Western Immunoblots—Membrane immunoblots were prepared from extracts of INS-1 cells and were interrogated with antisera to β-catenin as follows: total protein, the destabilizing GSK-3 phosphorylation sites (UpState catalog number 46-626), and the stabilizing PKA-mediated phosphorylation site, Ser-675, that stabilizes β-catenin (AnaSpec catalog number 29619). siRNA-mediated Knockdown of β-Catenin Expression—siRNAs against rat β-catenin (GenBank™ accession number NM_053357) were from Dharmacon (siRNA1 catalog number J100628-05, siRNA2 catalog number J-100628-06). 50 nm siRNAs were transfected into INS-1 cells using the Dharma reagent. siRNA-transfected cells were grown for 48 or 72 h, and aliquots of cells were harvested for Western immunoblot analysis and used for the TOPflash/FOPflash Wnt signaling reporter assay. Cell Proliferation Assay—The proliferation of dispersed isolated islets and INS-1 cells, stably transfected or transiently infected, was determined by measuring the incorporation of BrdUrd into newly synthesized DNA of proliferating cells. Cells were plated at 10,000/well or 20 islets/well in 96-well plates and treated with Exd4 or PBS overnight. Cells were pulse-labeled with BrdUrd 4 h before measurement. BrdUrd staining was measured by the DELFIA cell proliferation kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assays—For ChIP assays, INS-1 cells were treated with formaldehyde (1% final concentration) for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were then pelleted for 4 min at 2000 rpm and resuspended in 200 μl of SDS lysis buffer. After sonication, cell supernatant was diluted 10-fold in ChIP dilution buffer. Anti-TCF7L2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or β-catenin (Sigma) antibodies were added and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Afterward 60 μl of salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose slurry was added to the supernatant. After 1 h of incubation at 4 °C, the antibody-histone complex was collected by centrifugation. After elution and reverse cross-linking, DNA was recovered by phenol/chloroform extraction. DNAs were resuspended in 100 μl of TE buffer and analyzed by PCR using the following primers directed to cyclin D1 promoter, forward 5′-TGGAACTGCTTCTGGTGAAC-3′ and reverse 5′-CAGGAGAGGAAGTTGTTGGG-3′. GLP-1 and Exd4 Activate Wnt Signaling in INS-1 Cells and in Islets ex Vivo via the GLP-1 Receptor—Several of the following observations suggested to us that GLP-1 agonists may be involved in the activation of Wnt signaling in pancreatic beta cells. 1) GLP-1 agonists are known to enhance the proliferation (9Buteau J.

Collectively, these observations prompted us to examine the expression of genes expressed in Wnt signaling in beta cells using a focused Wnt signaling gene microarray (SuperArray, Invitrogen) and the clonal beta cell line INS-1 cells. Of the 118 probes represented on the Wnt signaling gene array, 37 were expressed above background in cultured INS-1 cells. Furthermore, we found that a 4-h exposure of the cells to Exd4 enhanced the expression of 14 of the genes, strongly suggesting that GLP-1 agonists activate components and target genes of the Wnt signaling pathway in INS-1 cells (supplemental Table S1). To investigate in more detail whether GLP-1 and Exd4 induce Wnt signaling in INS-1 cells, we used a Wnt signaling reporter assay (TOPflash/FOPflash) to measure Wnt signaling in INS-1 cells stimulated by Exd4. The TOPflash and FOPflash constructs contain the luciferase reporter either under the control of consensus TCF7L2-binding sites or mutated TCF7L2-binding sites, respectively. The ratio of TOPflash activity to FOPflash activity indicates the intensity of Wnt signaling. INS-1 cells were transfected with TOPflash or FOPflash, and 24 h later GLP-1 or derivatives thereof were added to the cell culture at the indicated doses. Luciferase activity was measured after 4 h of incubation (Fig. 1A) or the indicated times (Fig. 1B). The intensity of active Wnt signaling was determined by the TOPflash/FOPflash ratio. GLP-1-(7-36) and Exd4 activated Wnt signaling dose-dependently with maximum responses achieved at 5 and 1 nm, respectively (Fig. 1A). Rapidly after its secretion, intact GLP-1-(7-36) is proteolytically cleaved by the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase IV, yielding the metabolite GLP-1-(9-36). Exendin-(9-39), a derivative of Exendin-4 (Exd4), is a specific and competitive antagonist of the GLP-1 receptor. These two inactive GLP-1R ligands did not activate Wnt signaling (TOPflash/FOPflash activity) at all concentrations tested (Fig. 1A). The activation of Wnt signaling by Exd4 occurred as early as 1 h and reached maximum levels after 4 h of exposure to the hormone (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, the Exd4 activation was antagonized by co-incubation with increasing amounts of the Exd4-(9-39) antagonist (Fig. 1A), indicating that the activation of Wnt signaling by GLP-1 or Exd4 occurs via the GLP-1 receptor. To further determine whether Exd4 induces Wnt signaling, mouse islets were isolated from a commonly used Wnt signaling reporter mouse model (TOPGAL mice) to measure the Wnt signaling stimulated by Exd4. TOPGAL mice are transgenic mice harboring a reporter gene TOPGAL, a β-galactosidase-encoding gene (lacZ) under the control of a regulatory sequence consisting of three consensus LEF/TCF-binding motifs upstream of a minimal c-fos promoter. This mouse provides an effective model for studying the Wnt signaling pathway (40DasGupta R. Fuchs E. Development (Camb.). 1999; 126: 4557-4568Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Islets from TOPGAL mice were incubated with Exd4 or vehicle for 4 h and then treated with β-galactosidase substrate (X-gal) for an additional 4 h. The reaction products were examined under a phase contrast microscope. Islets treated with Exd4 exhibited a distinct blue color, representative of active Wnt signaling (Fig. 1C, upper panels). β-Galactosidase expression was inhibited by co-incubation with the GLP-1R antagonist Exd-(9-39) (Fig. 1C, lower panels). To quantitate the activation of lacZ by Exd4, we used real time PCR to measure levels of lacZ mRNA in islets treated with Exd4 or vehicle. lacZ mRNA increased by 2.6-fold in Exd4-treated TOPGAL islets, providing ex vivo evidence of Exd4-induced Wnt signaling activation in pancreatic islets (Fig. 1D). GLP-1 Interactions with the GLP-1R in INS-1 Cells and in Isolated Mouse Islets Are Coupled to the cAMP/PKA/CREB Signaling Pathway—Additional evidence that GLP-1 and Exd4 are acting on the known GLP-1R in INS-1 cells, and activate the cAMP/PKA/CREB signal transduction axis, was obtained by showing that both GLP-1-(7-36) and Exd4 agonists, and not the GLP-1-(9-36) and Exd-(9-39) antagonists, activated transcription from a luciferase reporter driven by a cAMP-response element (CRE) (Fig. 2A). The CRE-mediated transcription in response to GLP-1-(7-36) was attenuated by the PKA inhibitor H89 indicating that cAMP and active PKA are generated by GLP-1 activation of the GLP-1R in INS-1 cells (Fig. 2B). In addition, H89 abrogated Exd4-stimulated activation of β-galactosidase enzymatic activity and mRNA expression in islets isolated ex vivo from the TOPGAL Wnt signaling reporter mouse (Fig. 2, C and D). Insulin Does Not Activate Wnt Signaling in INS-1 Cells—Because GLP-1 agonists are insulin secretagogues, the effects of insulin on Wnt signaling were examined in INS-1 cells. Insulin (100 nm) had no effects on TOPFlash activities in conditions in which insulin readily stimulated the phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (serine 1101), GSK3α (serine 21), and GSK3β (serine 9) (supplemental Fig. 2). We also found that there is no effect of insulin on GLP-1 stimulation of Wnt signaling in the INS-1 cells, as determined by the activation of the TopFlash reporter (supplemental Fig. 3). Wnt Ligands and Frizzled Receptors Mediate Basal Endogenous Wnt Signaling in INS-1 Cells—We observed that the TOPflash activity in INS-1 cells is 20-fold higher than FOPflash activity, indicating that these cells have substantial basal levels of Wnt signaling. To investigate whether the basal Wnt signaling in INS-1 cells is mediated by the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, we observed that the basal endogenous Wnt signaling is stimulated by the Wnt ligand Wnt3A in a d"
https://openalex.org/W2121161929,"Rapid optimization of behavior requires decisions about when to explore and when to exploit discovered resources. The mechanisms that lead to fast adaptations and their interaction with action valuation are a central issue. We show here that the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) encodes multiple feedbacks devoted to exploration and its immediate termination. In a task that alternates exploration and exploitation periods, the ACC monitored negative and positive outcomes relevant for different adaptations. In particular, it produced signals specific of the first reward, i.e., the end of exploration. Those signals disappeared in exploitation periods but immediately transferred to the initiation of trials—a transfer comparable to learning phenomena observed for dopaminergic neurons. Importantly, these were also observed for high gamma oscillations of local field potentials shown to correlate with brain imaging signal. Thus, mechanisms of action valuation and monitoring of events/actions are combined for rapid behavioral regulation."

We report that the transcription factor SOX5 controls the sequential generation of distinct corticofugal neuron subtypes by preventing premature emergence of normally later-born corticofugal neurons. SOX5 loss-of-function causes striking overlap of the identities of the three principal sequentially born corticofugal neuron subtypes: subplate neurons, corticothalamic neurons, and subcerebral projection neurons. In Sox5−/− cortex, subplate neurons aberrantly develop molecular hallmarks and connectivity of subcerebral projection neurons; corticothalamic neurons are imprecisely differentiated, while differentiation of subcerebral projection neurons is accelerated. Gain-of-function analysis reinforces the critical role of SOX5 in controlling the sequential generation of corticofugal neurons—SOX5 overexpression at late stages of corticogenesis causes re-emergence of neurons with corticofugal features.

These data indicate that SOX5 controls the timing of critical fate decisions during corticofugal neuron production and thus subtype-specific differentiation and neocortical neuron diversity. Projection neurons of the adult neocortex consist of two main classes: corticofugal (CFu) neurons, which send their axons away from the cortex, and intracortical projection neurons, which send their axons to the ipsi- or contralateral cortex. CFu neurons can be further divided into subplate (SP) neurons and corticothalamic (CTh) neurons (together, subcortical projection neurons), which project to the thalamus, and subcerebral projection neurons (corticospinal and related corticobrainstem), which project more caudally to the tectum, pons, and spinal cord. These distinct subtypes of cortical projection neurons are born in a tightly orchestrated sequence and reside at distinct laminar locations in the neocortex (Gupta et al., 2002Gupta A. Tsai L.H. Wynshaw-Boris A. Life is a journey: a genetic look at neocortical development.Natl. Rev. 2002; 3: 342-355Crossref Scopus (295) Google Scholar, Molyneaux et al., 2007Molyneaux B.J. Arlotta A.

Subcortical and subcerebral projection neurons are confined to deep cortical layers (layers V, VI, SP), while intracortical projection neurons are found mostly within superficial cortical layers (layers II/III), as well as in layer V. CFu neurons are exclusively generated during the first few days of murine cortical development. Neurons born around embryonic day (E) 11.5 in the mouse form the deepest cortical layer, the SP, and send pioneering subcortical projections toward the thalamus, forming the first corticofugal tract (Allendoerfer and Shatz, 1994Allendoerfer K.L.

The thalamus is also the target of layer VI CTh neurons, which are born around E12.5. Although SP neurons and CTh neurons share the same target, these two neuronal subtypes have distinct functions and fates. SP neurons die postnatally in most species but are thought to play a critical developmental role in instructing corticothalamic and thalamocortical connectivity (Allendoerfer and Shatz, 1994Allendoerfer K.L.

(Berl.). 2003; 207: 177-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). CTh neurons, on the other hand, persist throughout life in layer VI and establish permanent connections between the cortex and the sensory and motor thalamus. The next-born CFu neurons are the subcerebral projection neurons, whose peak time of generation is E13.5 (Angevine and Sidman, 1961Angevine J. Sidman R.L. Autoradiographic study of cell migration during histogenesis of cerebral cortex in the mouse.Nature. 1961; 192: 766-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar); these migrate to layer V. A subset of subcerebral projection neurons project to the spinal cord (corticospinal motor neurons [CSMN]) and are of particular clinical importance, since these are the brain neurons that specifically degenerate in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and whose damage in spinal cord injury contributes centrally to loss of motor function. Intracortical projection neurons are born together with and reside alongside subcerebral projection neurons. While CFu neuron production ceases after E14.5, intracortical projection neurons continue to be generated and populate more superficial cortical layers. The latter neurons are phylogenetically younger and are thought to originate from progenitors distinct from those giving rise to CFu neurons (Molyneaux et al., 2007Molyneaux B.J. Arlotta A.

Despite substantial advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms regulating general aspects of precursor specification during early telencephalic development (Guillemot et al., 2006Guillemot F. Molnar Z. Tarabykin V. Stoykova A. Molecular mechanisms of cortical differentiation.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2006; 23: 857-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), only a few genes have been shown to play a layer-specific role in the differentiation of neocortical neurons. Examples include Tbr1, whose loss affects SP formation and corticothalamic connectivity, and Otx1, which plays a role in the refinement of subcerebral projections (Hevner et al., 2001Hevner R.F.

Understanding of the mechanisms underlying specification of individual subtypes of projection neurons is even more limited. By isolating pure populations of projection neurons, our laboratory has recently identified what appear to be combinatorial programs of gene expression that specifically control the development of distinct subtypes of projection neurons: subcerebral projection neurons (including CSMN), callosal projection neurons (CPN), and striatal medium spiny neurons (Arlotta et al., 2005Arlotta P.

The first two genes belonging to the subcerebral neuron subtype-specific developmental program reported so far are central to proper CSMN development. Ctip2 is specifically expressed in subcerebral projection neurons in layer V and is critical for their axonal fasciculation and pathfinding, and Fezf2 (previously called Fezl or ZFP312) is both necessary and sufficient for the birth and specification of subcerebral projection neurons from cortical progenitors (Arlotta et al., 2005Arlotta P.

Here, we investigate the molecular mechanisms that control the generation of distinct cortical projection neuron subtypes by investigating the role of Sox5, a transcription factor belonging to the SRY-box (Sox)-containing gene family. Sox5 is expressed at high levels in developing CFu neurons and is excluded from CPN of layer V and superficial layers. We find that SOX5 controls the sequence and pace of generation of the different subtypes of corticofugal neurons during corticogenesis, leading to a model of progressive withdrawal of SOX5 repression over coordinately regulated subtype-specific genes. The function of Sox5 has been best characterized in chondrogenesis, where it is required for the proper differentiation of prechondrocytes into early chondroblasts by preventing premature differentiation (Smits et al., 2004Smits P. Dy P. Mitra S. Lefebvre V. Sox5 and Sox6 are needed to develop and maintain source, columnar, and hypertrophic chondrocytes in the cartilage growth plate.J.

LSox5 regulates RhoB expression in the neural tube and promotes generation of the neural crest.Development. 2004; 131: 4455-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). More recently, SOX5 was shown to regulate oligodendrocyte differentiation in the spinal cord by maintaining precursor immaturity (Stolt et al., 2006Stolt C.C. Schlierf A. Lommes P. Hillgartner S. Werner T. Kosian T. Sock E. Kessaris N. Richardson W.D. Lefebvre V. Wegner M. SoxD proteins influence multiple stages of oligodendrocyte development and modulate SoxE protein function.Dev.

The specific expression of Sox5 in developing CFu neurons, together with the convergent function of Sox genes in other systems, prompted us to investigate whether this transcription factor plays a role in the development of these neurons. We find that SOX5 controls the differentiation of postmitotic CFu neurons by repressing subcerebral projection neuron fate during early corticogenesis. In Sox5-null mutants, the normal sequential generation of subtypes of CFu neurons is accelerated, leading to the premature generation of subcerebrally projecting neurons. As a consequence, the delineation between the distinct CFu neuron subtypes is lost in Sox5−/− cortex, as earliest-born SP neurons inappropriately express genes, molecular characteristics, and projections of normally later-born subcerebral projection neurons. Similarly, subcerebral projection neurons prematurely differentiate before they reach their final positions in layer V and arrest their migration heterotopically in the white matter and within deep cortical layers. Thus, the cellular, anatomic, and functional diversity of the output of the neocortex are critically controlled by SOX5. In strong support for SOX5's central role in setting the proper sequence of generation of CFu neurons, gain-of-function experiments demonstrate that overexpression of SOX5 past the normal period of generation of CFu neurons is sufficient to disallow callosal projection neuron differentiation and cause the re-emergence of neurons with corticofugal projections. We conclude that SOX5 fine tunes the identity of the closely related, yet distinct, CFu neuron subtypes during development by controlling the pace of generation of the sequentially born neurons, preventing the premature and inappropriate emergence of later-born CFu neuron features in early-born neurons. We previously found that Sox5 mRNA is expressed at high levels in subcerebral projection neurons at embryonic and early postnatal stages, while expression remains low throughout development in intracortical projection neurons (Figure 1A and Arlotta et al., 2005Arlotta P. Molyneaux B.J. Chen J. Inoue J. Kominami R. Macklis J.D. Neuronal subtype-specific genes that control corticospinal motor neuron development in vivo.Neuron. 2005; 45: 207-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). We therefore sought to investigate whether this transcription factor might function in the development of subcerebral and other CFu neurons. We first examined the temporal course and cell-type-specific expression of SOX5 protein in the neocortex during embryonic corticogenesis. We find that SOX5 is first expressed at about E12.5 in the emerging cortical plate (CP). At E13.5, during CFu neuron generation, SOX5 is expressed at high levels in the CP and subplate (SP). SOX5 is expressed in postmitotic cells, but not in the dorsal ventricular zone or subventricular zone where neural progenitors are located (Figure 1B and data not shown). By P0, neocortical SOX5 expression is confined to neurons of deep cortical layers (SP, VI, and V), where CFu neurons reside (Figures 1C, 1D, and 1G), and decreases rapidly after P3 (data not shown). SOX5 is not expressed in astrocytes or interneurons (Figures 1E and 1F). Outside of the neocortex, SOX5 is expressed at low levels in the subpallial ventricular wall, as well as in the ventral olfactory nucleus, and in the dorsal thalamus (Figure 1D). In all of these locations, levels of expression decrease rapidly postnatally. In the SP and layer VI, SOX5 is present in TBR1-positive CTh neurons (Figures 1G, 1I, 1K–1K″, and 1L–M″). Within layer V, SOX5-positive neurons express CTIP2, a specific marker for subcerebral projection neurons in this layer (Arlotta et al., 2005Arlotta P. Molyneaux B.J. Chen J. Inoue J. Kominami R. Macklis J.D. Neuronal subtype-specific genes that control corticospinal motor neuron development in vivo.Neuron. 2005; 45: 207-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar) (Figures 1G, 1H, and 1J–J″). Each subtype of CFu neurons, therefore, has a characteristic combinatorial expression of the transcription factors SOX5, CTIP2, and TBR1: (1) SP neurons express an intermediate level of SOX5, a high level of TBR1, and a low level of CTIP2; (2) CTh neurons in layer VI strongly express SOX5 and TBR1 and little CTIP2; and (3) subcerebral projection neurons in layer V express a high level of CTIP2, an intermediate level of SOX5, and little TBR1 (Figures 1G–1I). In order to confirm the specific expression of SOX5 in CFu neurons, we retrogradely labeled neurons from their axonal projection sites. We find that CTh neurons and SP neurons express SOX5 (retrograde labeling by FluoroGold [FG] injection in the thalamus; Figures 1L–1M″). Strikingly, in layer V, SOX5 is expressed by subcerebral projection neurons (labeled by injection in the cerebral peduncle) (Figures 1N–O″), but not by callosal (intracortical) projection neurons (labeled by injection in the contralateral hemisphere) (Figures 1P–1Q″). The temporal and subtype-specific patterns of SOX5 expression therefore suggest that SOX5 might be involved in the postmitotic differentiation of the three principal corticofugal neuron subtypes. We find that SOX5 is expressed across the distinct CFu neuron subtypes and that each subtype expresses a characteristic complement of transcription factors. This suggests that these neuronal subtypes might share a common lineage, within which SOX5 could act in a combinatorial manner to coordinately regulate fate decisions. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed Sox5 null mutant mice in which a lacZ/neo cassette is knocked into the Sox5 locus, yielding β-galactosidase (β-gal) expression in a SOX5-specific pattern (Smits et al., 2001Smits P. Li P. Mandel J. Zhang Z. Deng J.M. Behringer R.R. de Crombrugghe B. Lefebvre V. The transcription factors L-Sox5 and Sox6 are essential for cartilage formation.Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 277-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). β-gal and SOX5 strictly colocalize in Sox5+/− mice, and β-gal and SOX5-expressing CFu neurons are confined to cortical layers V, VI, and SP at P0 (Figures 2A, 2C, and 2E–E′). Using β-gal immunoreactivity to trace the fate of CFu neurons in null mutants, which die at birth (Smits et al., 2001Smits P. Li P. Mandel J. Zhang Z. Deng J.M. Behringer R.R. de Crombrugghe B. Lefebvre V. The transcription factors L-Sox5 and Sox6 are essential for cartilage formation.Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 277-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar), we find that loss of SOX5 dramatically affects the laminar distribution of these neurons at P0 (Figures 2B and 2D). First, there is seemingly a failure of neurons of layers VI and V to segregate from each other, with subcerebral projection neurons nearly absent from layer V. Instead, β-gal-expressing neurons are found in dense clusters within layer VI and form heterotopias in the subcortical white matter (Figures 2D and 2F, open arrowheads). Second, despite the high density of β-gal-expressing neurons in layer VI, the SP is not discernable as an individual layer and is cell-sparse (Figure 2D and Figures S1A and S1B available online). Instead, in the superficial layers of Sox5−/− cortex, there is an aberrant population of heterotopic β-gal-expressing neurons (Figure 2D, solid arrowheads). These findings indicate that CFu neurons in developing Sox5−/− cortex are unable to assume proper laminar position, a critical and very early differentiation step of postmitotic neurons. We next examined how each of the three sequentially born subtypes of CFu neurons is specifically affected by loss of SOX5. Nissl staining shows absence of a morphological SP in Sox5−/− cortex (Figures S1A and S1B). Using the SP-specific marker Ctgf (Heuer et al., 2003Heuer H. Christ S. Friedrichsen S. Brauer D. Winckler M. Bauer K. Raivich G. Connective tissue growth factor: a novel marker of layer VII neurons in the rat cerebral cortex.Neuroscience. 2003; 119: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), we observed a lack of Ctgf-expressing neurons in the SP and abnormal Ctgf-expressing neurons in superficial layers (Figures 2G and 2H). Although there are fewer Ctgf-positive neurons in Sox5−/− cortex, the number of cells labeled by BrdU at E11.5 (the peak of SP neuron birth) is similar in WT and Sox5−/− cortex (data not shown). This strongly suggests that the reduced number of Ctgf-positive neurons reflects an abnormal differentiation of SP neurons rather than an absolute decrease in the size of this cell population. We observed a similar distribution of SP neurons using another SP/layer V marker, Crim1 (Figures S1K–S1N) and Nurr-1 (a deep layer VI/SP marker, data not shown; see Molyneaux et al., 2007Molyneaux B.J. Arlotta A. Menezes J.R. Macklis J.D. Neuronal subtype specification in the cerebral cortex.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8: 427-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). The lack of a morphological SP in Sox5−/− cortex, therefore, appears to result from the reallocation of SP neurons to more superficial locations, suggesting that at least some of the abnormal β-gal-expressing neurons within these layers are SP derived. We next examined the fate of CTh neurons in Sox5−/− cortex. While TBR1-expressing neurons remain mostly confined to layer VI, there is a subtle but distinct local dispersion of these neurons and blurred laminar borders (Figures 2I and 2J). Additional analysis using TLE4, a marker for layer VI and V neurons (Yao et al., 1998Yao J. Liu Y. Husain J. Lo R. Palaparti A. Henderson J. Stifani S. Combinatorial expression patterns of individual TLE proteins during cell determination and differentiation suggest non-redundant functions for mammalian homologs of Drosophila Groucho.Dev. Growth Differ. 1998; 40: 133-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), further confirms an intralaminar redistribution of layer VI neurons in Sox5−/− neocortex (Figures S1E–S1H). Finally, we used the layer V subcerebral projection neuron specific transcription factor Fezf2 (Molyneaux et al., 2005Molyneaux B.J. Arlotta P. Hirata T. Hibi M. Macklis J.D. Fezl is required for the birth and specification of corticospinal motor neurons.Neuron. 2005; 47: 817-831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) to examine the fate of these neurons in Sox5−/− cortex (Figures 2K and 2L). We find that Fezf2-positive neurons are almost completely absent from layer V in Sox5−/− cortex, but instead accumulate within layer VI and the white matter (Figure 2L). Analysis using another subcerebral projection neuron specific transcription factor, CTIP2, confirms this redistribution of neurons (Figures 2M–2Q). Additionally, CTIP2 labeling reveals a heterotopic neuronal population in superficial cortical layers, reminiscent of the abnormally located Ctgf-positive SP neurons (Figure 2P, solid arrowheads). These results are further confirmed using a series of recently identified markers of subcerebral projection neurons (Arlotta et al., 2005Arlotta P. Molyneaux B.J. Chen J. Inoue J. Kominami R. Macklis J.D. Neuronal subtype-specific genes that control corticospinal motor neuron development in vivo.Neuron. 2005; 45: 207-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar, Molyneaux et al., 2005Molyneaux B.J.

Fezl is required for the birth and specification of corticospinal motor neurons.Neuron. 2005; 47: 817-831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), including Cry-mu, Crim1, and Diap3 (Figures 5D and 5E and Figures S1K–S1N and data not shown), indicating that these neurons are lacking from layer V. Instead, neurons with molecular characteristics of subcerebral projection neurons are found in the white matter and in the deepest and most superficial layers of Sox5−/− cortex. Of note, lateral to motor cortex, the neocortex is almost completely devoid of CTIP2-positive neurons, resulting in a medialization of CTIP2-expressing neurons in Sox5−/− cortex (Figures 2N and 2Q), and suggests that SOX5 functions in an areal-specific manner in combination with other factors. The laminar and areal redistributions of projection neurons in the absence of SOX5 function are restricted to CFu neurons; non-CFu and superficial neuron populations are unaffected. In particular, expression of the layer IV marker RORβ (Figures 2R and 2S), the layer II/III marker Cux2 (Figures 2T and 2U), and the marginal zone (MZ, layer I) marker reelin (Figures 2V and 2W) are all unchanged in Sox5 null mutants. Similarly, β-gal and CTIP2 expression by non-neocortical neuron populations in striatum, thalamus, and piriform cortex appear unchanged in Sox5−/− brains (data not shown), reinforcing the specificity of SOX5 function in CFu neuron development. In summary, loss of SOX5 function highly selectively causes a loss of distinction between the centrally important and normally sequentially differentiating classes of CFu neurons, indicating a critical role for this transcription factor in the generation of diversity of cortical output neurons. We next examined whether the early abnormal differentiation of CFu neurons would have consequences on their later developmental processes leading to establishment of proper axonal connectivity. To investigate whether heterotopic CTIP2-positive neurons in Sox5−/− cortex send axons to subcerebral targets, we retrogradely labeled neurons from the cerebral peduncle using ultrasound-guided in utero injections of FG into this subcerebral target at E17.5 and examined brains at P0 (Figure 3A). We find that, in contrast to WT mice, in which subcerebral projection neurons are sharply confined to layer V (Figure 3B), subce"

Spatial activity in the hippocampus is relatively disorganized during the initial exploration of a novel environment, however, and it is unclear how neural activity during the initial stages of learning drives synaptic plasticity. Here we show that pairs of CA1 cells that represent overlapping novel locations are initially more coactive and more precisely coordinated than are cells representing overlapping familiar locations. This increased coordination occurs specifically during brief, high-frequency events (HFEs) in the local field potential that are similar to ripples and is not associated with better coordination of place-specific neural activity outside of HFEs. As novel locations become more familiar, correlations between cell pairs decrease. Thus, hippocampal neural activity during learning has a unique structure that is well suited to induce synaptic plasticity and to allow for rapid storage of new memories."

Here we demonstrate that the effects of PSD-95 on AMPAR-mediated synaptic responses and LTD can be dissociated. Our findings suggest that N-terminal-domain-mediated dimerization is important for PSD-95's effect on basal synaptic AMPAR function, whereas the C-terminal SH(3)-GK domains are also necessary for localizing PSD-95 to synapses. We identify PSD-95 point mutants (Q15A, E17R) that maintain PSD-95's influence on basal AMPAR synaptic responses yet block LTD. These point mutants increase the proteolysis of PSD-95 within its N-terminal domain, resulting in a C-terminal fragment that functions as a dominant negative likely by scavenging critical signaling proteins required for LTD. Thus, the C-terminal portion of PSD-95 serves a dual function. It is required to localize PSD-95 at synapses and as a scaffold for signaling proteins that are required for LTD."
https://openalex.org/W1969759955,"Several genome-wide transcriptomics efforts have shown that a large percentage of the mammalian genome is transcribed into RNAs, however, only a small percentage (1-2%) of these RNAs is translated into proteins. Currently there is an intense interest in characterizing the function of the different classes of noncoding RNAs and their relevance to human disease. Using genomic approaches we discovered FMR4, a primate-specific noncoding RNA transcript (2.4 kb) that resides upstream and likely shares a bidirectional promoter with FMR1. FMR4 is a product of RNA polymerase II and has a similar half-life to FMR1. The CGG expansion in the 5' UTR of FMR1 appears to affect transcription in both directions as we found FMR4, similar to FMR1, to be silenced in fragile X patients and up-regulated in premutation carriers. Knockdown of FMR4 by several siRNAs did not affect FMR1 expression, nor vice versa, suggesting that FMR4 is not a direct regulatory transcript for FMR1. However, FMR4 markedly affected human cell proliferation in vitro; siRNAs knockdown of FMR4 resulted in alterations in the cell cycle and increased apoptosis, while the overexpression of FMR4 caused an increase in cell proliferation. Collectively, our results demonstrate an antiapoptotic function of FMR4 and provide evidence that a well-studied genomic locus can show unexpected functional complexity. It cannot be excluded that altered FMR4 expression might contribute to aspects of the clinical presentation of fragile X syndrome and/or related disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2060084426,"Short-term synaptic plasticity shapes the postsynaptic response to bursts of impulses and is crucial for encoding information in neurons, but the molecular mechanisms are unknown. Here we show that activity-dependent modulation of presynaptic Ca(V)2.1 channels mediated by neuronal Ca(2+) sensor proteins (CaS) induces synaptic plasticity in cultured superior cervical ganglion (SCG) neurons. A mutation of the IQ-like motif in the C terminus that blocks Ca(2+)/CaS-dependent facilitation of the P/Q-type Ca(2+) current markedly reduces facilitation of synaptic transmission. Deletion of the nearby calmodulin-binding domain, which inhibits CaS-dependent inactivation, substantially reduces depression of synaptic transmission. These results demonstrate that residual Ca(2+) in presynaptic terminals can act through CaS-dependent regulation of Ca(V)2.1 channels to induce short-term synaptic facilitation and rapid synaptic depression. Activity-dependent regulation of presynaptic Ca(V)2.1 channels by CaS proteins may therefore be a primary determinant of short-term synaptic plasticity and information-processing in the nervous system."

The most prevalent mutation, NPC1I1061T, is predicted to lie within the cysteine-rich luminal domain and is associated with the classic juvenile-onset phenotype of Niemann-Pick type C disease. To gain insight into the molecular mechanism by which the NPC1I1061T mutation causes disease, we examined expression of the mutant protein in human fibroblasts homozygous for the NPC1I1061T mutation. Despite similar NPC1 mRNA levels between wild type and NPC1I1061T fibroblasts, NPC1 protein levels are decreased by 85% in NPC1I1061T cells. Metabolic labeling studies demonstrate that unlike wild type protein, which undergoes a glycosylation pattern shift from Endo H-sensitive to Endo H-resistant species, NPC1I1061T protein remains almost exclusively Endo H-sensitive and exhibits a reduced half-life (t½ 6.5 h) versus wild type Endo H-resistant species (t½ 42 h). Treatment with chemical chaperones, growth at permissive temperature, or inhibition of proteasomal degradation increases NPC1I1061T protein levels, indicating that the mutant protein is likely targeted for endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) due to protein misfolding.

Previous studies have shown that NPC1I1061T is expressed at lower levels and exhibits altered banding patterns on Western blotting as compared with wild type (WT) protein (19Watari H. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Dwyer N.K. Watari M. Burd C.G. Patel S. Pentchev P.G. Strauss 3rd, J.F. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 259: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism through which the NPC1I1061T missense mutation results in NPC disease is poorly understood. In the present study we examine the effect of the NPC1I1061T substitution on processing and stability of the NPC1 protein. We provide evidence that the NPC1I1061T protein is synthesized but fails to advance in the secretory pathway due to recognition as a misfolded protein by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) quality control machinery and consequent targeting for proteasomal degradation. Overexpression of NPC1I1061T led to late endosomal localization of the mutant protein and functional complementation of the NPC mutant phenotype, likely as a result of a small proportion of NPC1I1061T mutant protein that folded correctly and was thus able to escape ER quality control. Our findings provide support for use of chemical chaperones as approaches to treat NPC disease caused by the NPC1I1061T mutation.

Mouse embryonic fibroblasts were isolated from WT C57BL/6 mice. Cells were maintained in monolayer culture at 37 °C with 5% CO2.

Plasmids—The ΔU3mnpc1-I1061T-GFP construct was generated using the QuikChange XL Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene), using the ΔU3mnpc1-WT-GFP construct as a template (3Millard E. Gale S. Dudley N. Zhang J. Schaffer J. Ory D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28581-28590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). ΔU3mnpc1-I1061T was generated by deletion of the COOH-terminal GFP tag. The presence of the npc1I1061T mutation and the entire mnpc1 coding sequence in the expression construct was confirmed by ABI Prism automated sequencing. Quantification of Human NPC1 Gene Expression—Total RNA was isolated from cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and reverse transcribed to cDNA using SuperScriptII RNase H– reverse transcriptase and random hexamer primers (Invitrogen). cDNA was then amplified for 40 PCR cycles using SYBR Green PCR master mixture (Applied Biosystems) and template-specific primers (50 nm) in an ABI Prism 7500 sequence detector. Primer sequences were as follows: human NPC1 (forward, 5′-cagctggacaactatacccgaat-3′; reverse, 5′-tggcttcacccagtcgaaat-3′) and human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (forward, 5′-cgagatccctccaaaatcaa-3′; reverse, 5′-catgcgtccttccacgataccaa-3′). Relative quantification of gene expression was performed using the comparative threshold (CT) method as described by the manufacturer. Changes in mRNA expression level were calculated following normalization to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase expression. Protein Preparation and Western Blot Analysis—Detergent lysates were prepared by washing cell monolayers three times with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were then scraped in 500 μl of TNEN+ (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.15 m NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1× Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated on ice for 10 min. Cell lysates were collected into microcentrifuge tubes and nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 minutes at 4 °C. Supernatants were transferred to new tubes. Proteins in TNEN+ lysates were quantified using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Pierce). Isolation of microsomes from CHO cell lines was performed as described previously (22Gale S.E.

Non-boiled samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (0.45 mm; Millipore) using a semi-dry electroblotter (Owl Scientific). Western blot analysis of NPC1 expression was performed using an affinity purified rabbit anti-human NPC1 at a dilution of 1:2000 and a peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch) at 1:5000. Analysis of β-actin expression was performed using a rabbit anti-human β-actin at 1:500 and a peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG at 1:5000. Analysis of p63 expression was performed using a rabbit anti-human p63 at 1:5000 and a peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG at 1:5000. Detection was performed by chemiluminescence using Western Lightning reagents. Densitometry was performed using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). For each of the non-peptide competition lanes, both the blot background and the region on the gel between 160 and 220 kDa in the peptide competition lanes (i.e. background bands), including the band denoted by the filled arrow, were subtracted from total NPC1 immunoreactivity. Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation of NPC1 Protein—Pulse-chase labeling of NPC1 protein was achieved following a 1-h treatment in starvation media (Cys/Met-depleted) followed by a 1-h treatment in starvation media supplemented with [35S]Cys/Met (EasyTag Express Labeling Kit). After labeling, total cell lysate was collected in 500 μl of TNEN+ buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40). The lysate was spun at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was collected, pre-cleared with Protein A-agarose, and incubated with NPC1 affinity purified antibody overnight at 4 °C. Protein-antibody complex was pulled down using Protein A-agarose at 4 °C for 45 min. Protein-antibody complex was removed from the Protein A-agarose using 1× Laemmli buffer (Bio-Rad) for 10 min at 37 °C followed by vortexing. For endoglycosidase treatments, immunoprecipitations (IPs) were treated overnight at 37 °C with either Endoglycosidase H (Endo H) or peptide:N-glycosidase F in the commercially supplied buffers. Protein was separated by 6% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Following transfection, cells were plated on 22-mm glass coverslips in 35-mm wells. Cells were cultured 24–72 h, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min. Immunocytochemistry for NPC1 and unesterified cholesterol (filipin staining) was performed as described (5Frolov A. Srivastava K. Daphna-Iken D. Traub L.M. Schaffer J.E. Ory D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46414-46421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The coverslips were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, mounted (SlowFade, Molecular Probes), and examined by fluorescence microscopy on a Zeiss Axiovert epifluorescence microscope. The following filter sets (Chroma) were used: for filipin, excitation filter 360/40 nm, emission filter 460/50; for GFP, excitation filter 500/20, emission filter 535/30. LDL-stimulated Cholesterol Esterification Assay—Cholesterol esterification assays were performed as described previously (3Millard E. Gale S. Dudley N. Zhang J. Schaffer J. Ory D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28581-28590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Statistics—All results are expressed as mean ± S.E.

NPC1I1061T Mutant Protein Is Mislocalized and Expressed at Reduced Levels in Human Fibroblasts—In WT human fibroblasts NPC1 protein predominantly distributes to a multivesicular late endosomal compartment (5Frolov A.

Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9627-9635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). This contrasts with human fibroblasts homozygous for the NPC1I1061T missense mutation, in which NPC1 immunostaining is reduced and the mutant protein fails to localize to late endosomes. The resulting lysosomal free cholesterol accumulation in the NPC1I1061T fibroblasts is the hallmark of the NPC mutant phenotype (12Pentchev P.G. Comly M.E. Kruth H.S. Vanier M.T. Wenger D.A. Patel S. Brady R.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1985; 82: 8247-8251Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Whereas NPC1 mRNA transcript levels are elevated 1.4–2.4-fold in NPC1I1061T versus WT fibroblasts (Fig. 2A), NPC1 protein levels are reduced by 85% in the NPC1I1061T fibroblasts (Fig. 2, B and C). Thus, the NPC1I1061T substitution affects steady-state levels of endogenously expressed NPC1 protein, possibly by impairing translation of the NPC1 protein or by rendering the protein unstable.FIGURE 2Characterization of NPC1 expression in human fibroblasts homozygous for NPC1I1061T mutations.

WT and NPC1I1061T homozygous fibroblasts were labeled, and NPC1 protein immunoprecipitated and analyzed by autoradiography (Fig. 3, A and B). Two distinct rates for WT NPC1 protein degradation were observed. From 0–8 h post pulse labeling, WT NPC1 protein exhibited a t½ of 9 h, whereas from 8 to 72 h, the t½ was extended to 42 h (Fig. 3C). By contrast, NPC1I1061T was degraded with a t½ of 6.5 h, similar to that of the initial rate of degradation of WT protein (Fig. 3C). The maximal level of labeled NPC1 protein was comparable between WT and NPC1I1061T proteins, indicating similar rates in initiation of translation. An important difference, however, between WT and NPC1I1061T protein was the failure of NPC1I1061T to mature to higher molecular weight species (see open arrow, Fig. 3B). NPC1I1061T Protein Is Sensitive to Endoglycosidase H—The maturation of the NPC1 protein in the secretory pathway was examined in metabolic pulse-chase experiments in which the sensitivity of the labeled protein to digestion by Endo H was determined. Endo H removes immature high-mannose N-linked glycans from proteins. Sensitivity to Endo H digestion indicates that the protein has not advanced beyond the ER in the secretory pathway. Conversely, resistance to Endo H digestion indicates that the glycan residues have been trimmed and/or further modified in the Golgi. Peptide:N-glycosidase F removes all N-linked glycan residues regardless of the glycan modification. In WT fibroblasts, the steady reduction in the level of Endo H-sensitive NPC1 protein (120-kDa band) is accompanied by a concomitant accumulation of Endo H-resistant NPC1 protein (180-kDa band) (Fig. 4A). By contrast, the NPC1I1061T mutant protein is present almost exclusively in the Endo H-sensitive form (Fig. 4B). As shown by the peptide competition controls, immunoreactivity detected at 180 kDa in the NPC1I1061T mutant blot is due to nonspecific banding, rather than accumulation of Endo H-resistant NPC1 protein. The more rapid loss of the Endo H-sensitive WT NPC1 species likely reflects the dynamic between degradation of ER-associated NPC1 protein and procession of the immature NPC1 within the secretory pathway (i.e. trafficking from ER to Golgi) to generate mature glycoprotein. The apparent molecular weight shift in NPC1 protein in the glycosidase experiments (Fig. 4 versus Fig. 3) is an artifact of the glycosidase treatment and buffer system used in the studies. Taken together, the metabolic labeling experiments demonstrate that ∼50% of WT NPC1 protein, and nearly all of the NPC1I1061T mutant protein, is ER-retained and targeted for degradation. NPC1I1061T Protein Is Selected for ERAD—The ER quality control pathway selects for degradation misfolded and unassembled proteins in the ER (23Werner E.D. Brodsky J.L. McCracken A.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13797-13801Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). To examine whether the NPC1I1061T mutant protein is a substrate for ERAD, we subjected NPC1I1061T mutant fibroblasts to treatment with either glycerol or 4-phenylbutyric acid (PBA), chemical chaperones known to stabilize misfolded proteins (24Sato S.

Investig. 1997; 100: 2457-2465Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Glycerol and PBA treatments resulted in 1.4- and 1.5-fold increases, respectively, in the level of the mutant protein (Fig. 5, A and B). Similarly, growth of NPC1I1061T mutant fibroblasts at the permissive temperature of 26 °C, which partially rescues the ER processing block of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Δ508 mutant (24Sato S. Ward C.L. Krouse M.E. Wine J.J. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 635-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 27Denning G.M. Anderson M.P. Amara J.F. Marshall J. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Nature. 1992; 358: 761-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar), increased NPC1I1061T protein levels 1.7-fold. The stabilizing effects of the chemical chaperones and growth at permissive temperatures on NPC1I1061T provide compelling evidence that the mutant protein is selected for ERAD due to protein misfolding. To determine the metabolic fate of the mutant protein selected for ERAD, NPC1I1061T mutant fibroblasts were treated with MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, or chloroquine, a weak base that inhibits lysosomal proteolysis. In the presence of MG132, mutant protein levels were increased 3.5-fold, implicating the proteasomal pathway in degradation of the mutant protein (Fig. 5C). By contrast, NPC1I1061T protein levels were reduced 85% after treatment with chloroquine, clearly demonstrating that the mutant protein is not lysosomally degraded. Overexpression of the NPC1I1061T Protein Rescues the NPC Mutant Phenotype—Previous studies have shown that overexpression of mutant proteins that are misfolded may allow for transit of a small proportion of the mutant proteins through the Golgi (28Spear E.D. Ng D.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2756-2767Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Heterologous overexpression of CFTR Δ508 led to escape of mutant protein from ERAD and appropriate localization at the plasma membrane (29Dalemans W. Barbry P. Champigny G. Jallat S. Dott K. Dreyer D. Crystal R.G. Pavirani A. Lecocq J.P. Lazdunski M. Nature. 1991; 354: 526-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 30Sharma M. Benharouga M. Hu W. Lukacs G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8942-8950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether overexpression of NPC1I1061T could lead to escape of NPC1I1061T molecules from ERAD and proper targeting to the late endosomal compartment. In transient transfection experiments, we found that overexpression of GFP-tagged NPC1I1061T in npc1-deficient CHO cells led to appropriate late endosomal localization of the mutant protein, and to clearance of lysosomal free cholesterol (Fig. 6A, top panels). By contrast, overexpression of the non-functional GFP-tagged NPC1P692S in npc1-deficient CHO cells failed to mobilize lysosomal free cholesterol (Fig. 6A, bottom panels) (3Millard E. Gale S. Dudley N. Zhang J. Schaffer J. Ory D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28581-28590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This finding indicated that forced overexpression of an NPC1 mutant was not sufficient to complement the cholesterol accumulation phenotype. We likewise found that heterologous expression of NPC1I1061T could rescue the mutant phenotype in human NPC1I1061T mutant fibroblasts (Fig. 6B). To quantify the function of the NPC1I1061T mutant, we transiently expressed either WT NPC1 or NPC1I1061T GFP fusion proteins in the npc1-deficient CHO cells and monitored for clearance of unesterified lysosomal cholesterol by filipin staining (31Watari H. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Dwyer N.K. Watari M. Neufeld E.B. Patel S. Pentchev P.G. Strauss 3rd, J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21861-21866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We found that the mutant protein was nearly as effective as WT protein in mobilizing lysosomal cholesterol, although at each time point examined the complementation efficiency of the npc1I1061T mutant was slightly less than that of WT (Fig. 7, A–C). To exclude the possibility that the NPC1I1061T mutant protein might have been artificially stabilized by the COOH-terminal GFP fusion, we compared the ability of the NPC1I1061T mutant expression constructs, with and without the GFP tag, to complement npc1-deficient CHO cells. At 72 h post-transfection, we found that expression of the npc1I1061T construct achieved 90.5% complementation, whereas expression of the npc1I1061T-GFP construct achieved 87.2% complementation (Fig. 7D). Thus, the functionality and/or stability of the GFP-tagged NPC1I1061T protein cannot be attributed to the presence of the GFP tag.FIGURE 7Time course of complementation of npc1-null CHO cells by transient expression of WT npc1-GFP or npc1I1061T-GFP.

For these experiments, we isolated npc1-deficient CHO cells stably re-expressing WT NPC1, NPC1I1061T, or NPC1P692S. In comparison to primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts, NPC1 protein was overexpressed ∼2-fold in the WT NPC1, NPC1I1061T, and NPC1P692S cell lines (Fig. 8, A and B). (Because the rabbit polyclonal antibody does not efficiently recognize hamster NPC1 protein, mouse embryonic fibroblasts rather than CHO cells were used to assess relative NPC1 expression.) We found that overexpression of NPC1I1061T corrected the biochemical defect to 53% of WT CHO cells (Fig. 8C). Overexpression of the NPC1P692S mutant protein, which appropriately localizes to late endosomes but is non-functional (3Millard E. Gale S. Dudley N. Zhang J. Schaffer J. Ory D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28581-28590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), failed to stimulate cholesterol esterification. Taken together, the complementation and esterification assay data demonstrate that if the NPC1I1061T mutant protein can escape ER quality control, it is properly localized to late endosomes and is functional with respect to mobilization of endosomal cholesterol. Protein misfolding has been implicated in the pathogenesis of over 30 human diseases, including cystic fibrosis, α1-antitrypsin deficiency, and lysosomal storage diseases (32Aridor M. Hannan L.A. Traffic. 2000; 1: 836-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 33Aridor M. Hannan L.A. Traffic. 2002; 3: 781-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In these disorders, mutant proteins that fail to achieve proper conformation are targeted for ERAD, resulting in loss of function and disease. In the present study, we demonstrate that the NPC1I1061T missense mutation, the most prevalent NPC disease allele, disrupts NPC1 protein trafficking by promoting ER-mediated degradation of the mutant protein. Overexpression of the NPC1I1061T mutant unexpectedly led to appropriate late endosomal localization of the mutant protein and correction of the mutant phenotype. We conclude that the NPC1I1061T mutant protein is functional with respect to cholesterol trafficking, but is unstable because it is misfolded and targeted by the ER quality control machinery for proteasomal degradation. Our study provides the first description of an ER trafficking defect as a mechanism for human NPC disease, and suggests novel approaches for treatment of this progressive neurodegenerative disorder. The function of ER quality control machinery is to prevent delivery of proteins to sites of function until they are properly folded, thereby limiting cytotoxicity of accumulated misfolded proteins (25Shearer A.G. Hampton R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 188-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 34Sifers R.N. Science. 2003; 299: 1330-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Proteins recognized as misfolded by quality control are degraded through the actions of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. ER quality control not only targets mutant proteins, but also wild-type proteins that have been exposed to damaging conditions or that are slow to achieve conformation because they require extensive post-translational modifications (35Sitia R. Braakman I. Nature. 2003; 426: 891-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Whereas mature WT NPC1 protein that has progressed to post-ER compartments (i.e. Endo H-resistant) exhibits a half-life of 42 h, the half-life of ER-associated (i.e. Endo H-sensitive) WT NPC1 protein is only 9 h. Our data indicate that nearly half of the newly synthesized WT NPC1 protein is degraded within the ER. Similar ER-mediated degradation of immature species has been reported for other large, polytopic proteins, such as CFTR (36Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25710-25718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and is likely due to failure of these heavily glycosylated proteins to properly fold prior to arrival at the ER quality control checkpoints. The presence of the NPC1I1061T mutation further accelerates degradation of immature NPC1 protein by the ER quality control machinery. We find that the half-life of ER-associated NPC1I1061T protein is reduced to 6.5 h, and that almost none of the endogenously expressed protein escapes the ER. The NPC1I1061T substitution could affect NPC1 protein stability by introducing structural features into the NPC1 protein that cause its recognition as a misfolded protein. The significant increase in NPC1I1061T protein levels in cells grown at permissive temperatures or in cells administered chemical chaperones (e.g. glycerol and PBA) provide evidence that the mutant form of the protein is misfolded. Alternatively, newly synthesized NPC1I1061T protein may be slower to achieve conformation, thus prolonging association with ER chaperones and increasing the likelihood of selection for ERAD. A key finding in our study was the demonstration that overexpression of the NPC1I1061T protein rescues the mutant phenotype in npc1-deficient cells. We show that at least a portion of the overexpressed mutant protein was correctly targeted to late endosomes, and importantly, properly functioned in mobilization of free cholesterol from this compartment, as determined by clearance of lysosomal free cholesterol and re-esterification of LDL-derived cholesterol. Overexpression of misfolded proteins leading to ER escape has been shown previously for other proteins, such as the CFTR Δ508 mutant (29Dalemans W. Barbry P. Champigny G. Jallat S. Dott K. Dreyer D. Crystal R.G. Pavirani A. Lecocq J.P. Lazdunski M. Nature. 1991; 354: 526-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). A possible explanation for “leakiness” of the mutant NPC1 protein is that enforced overexpression of the protein saturated the ER quality control machinery (37Gelman M.S. Kopito R.R. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 1591-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Perhaps a more plausible explanation, based on a kinetic model, is that a small proportion of the nascent NPC1I1061T protein is able to fold correctly and therefore escape the quality control checkpoints (38Kopito R.R. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S167-S173Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Assuming a fixed rate for leakiness for the I1061T mutant (e.g. 2–5% of the I1061T molecules achieve proper conformation), a sufficient quantity of correctly folded I1061T molecules could escape the ER as a result of overexpression, leading to complementation of the mutant phenotype. In the present study we demonstrate that a 2-fold overexpression of NPC1I1061T protein is able to partially correct the biochemical phenotype in npc1-null cells. Assuming that the level of properly targeted NPC1 protein required for complete complementation of the cholesterol trafficking defect is ∼10%, akin to the level of hydrolases required for enzymatic correction of other lysosomal disorders (39Schueler U.H. Kolter T. Kaneski C.R. Zirzow G.C. Sandhoff K. Brady R.O. J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 2004; 27: 649-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), it is reasonable to conclude that in human fibroblasts as much as 2.5–5% of the endogenous NPC1I1061T protein could exit the ER in the proper conformation. Whereas steady-state NPC1 protein levels were increased when the mutant fibroblasts were cultured at permissive temperatures or exposed to chemical chaperones that stabilize protein, the overall effect on efficiency of NPC1I1061T protein folding does not appear to be sufficient to correct the cholesterol trafficking defect (not shown). On the other hand, identification of chemical chaperones that enhance the efficiency of NPC1I1061T protein folding through high throughput small molecule screens has the potential to develop new and effective approaches for the treatment of NPC1 disease. Such an approach might not only benefit subjects with the NPC1I1061T genotype, but subjects with other missense mutations, in particular the G992W and P1007A genotypes that likewise effect the cysteine-rich luminal domain. In future studies these and other NPC1 mutants could be screened to determine whether the mutant proteins are similarly misfolded and respond to treatment with chemical chaperones. If this is indeed the case, there is the potential that a significant percentage of NPC1 subjects could benefit from small molecule-based chaperone therapy.

https://openalex.org/W2083226552,"Human noroviruses are a highly diverse group of viruses classified into three of the five currently recognised Norovirus genogroups, and contain numerous genotypes or genetic clusters. Noroviruses are the major aetiological agent of endemic gastroenteritis in all age groups, as well as the cause of periodic epidemic gastroenteritis. The noroviruses most commonly associated with outbreaks of gastroenteritis are genogroup II genotype 4 (GII-4) strains. The relationship between genotypes of noroviruses with their phenotypes and antigenic profile remains poorly understood through an inability to culture these viruses and the lack of a suitable animal model.Here we describe a study of the diversity of amino acid sequences of the highly variable P2 region in the major capsid protein, VP1, of the GII-4 human noroviruses strains using sequence analysis and homology modelling techniques.Our data identifies two sites in this region, which show significant amino acid substitutions associated with the appearance of variant strains responsible for epidemics with major public health impact. Homology modelling studies revealed the exposed nature of these sites on the capsid surface, providing supportive structural data that these two sites are likely to be associated with putative variant-specific epitopes. Furthermore, the patterns in the evolution of these viruses at these sites suggests that noroviruses follow a neutral network pattern of evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2169586407,"We have investigated how Wnt and vitamin D receptor signals regulate epidermal differentiation. Many epidermal genes induced by beta-catenin, including the stem cell marker keratin 15, contain vitamin D response elements (VDREs) and several are induced independently of TCF/Lef. The VDR is required for beta-catenin induced hair follicle formation in adult epidermis, and the vitamin D analog EB1089 synergizes with beta-catenin to stimulate hair differentiation. Human trichofolliculomas (hair follicle tumours) are characterized by high nuclear beta-catenin and VDR, whereas infiltrative basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) have high beta-catenin and low VDR levels. In mice, EB1089 prevents beta-catenin induced trichofolliculomas, while in the absence of VDR beta-catenin induces tumours resembling BCCs. We conclude that VDR is a TCF/Lef-independent transcriptional effector of the Wnt pathway and that vitamin D analogues have therapeutic potential in tumors with inappropriate activation of Wnt signalling."

Glutathionylated A4-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase is the first physiological substrate identified for a CGFS-type GRX. GSH is the main low molecular weight thiol in cells and is generally considered to constitute a redox buffer. Besides its antioxidant functions, GSH is also important for the detoxification of xenobiotics and heavy metals (1Meyer A.J. Hell R. Photosynth. Res. 2005; 86: 435-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Moreover, glutathione has recently been found to be involved in a post-translational modification termed glutathionylation (2Ghezzi P. Bonetto V. Fratelli M. Antioxid.

This modification, which occurs under oxidative stress conditions, consists of the reversible formation of a mixed disulfide between glutathione and a cysteine residue on the target proteins. Glutathionylation can alter, either positively or negatively, the activity of several proteins in mammals. Compared with mammals, bacteria, and yeast, very little is known about glutathionylation in photosynthetic organisms. However, recent studies have allowed the identification of a growing number of plant proteins undergoing glutathionylation (4Dixon D.P. Davis B.G. Edwards R. J. Biol.

The precise mechanisms leading to the formation of protein glutathione mixed-disulfides in vivo are largely unknown. On the contrary, the reverse reaction, named deglutathionylation, is likely catalyzed by glutaredoxins (GRXs) 2The abbreviations used are: GRXglutaredoxinTRXthioredoxinGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseDHAdehydroascorbateBPGA1,3-bisphosphoglycerateFTRferredoxin-thioredoxin reductaseDTNB5,5′-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acidHED2-hydroxyethyldisulfideDHARdehydroascorbate reductase.

GRXs are small ubiquitous disulfide oxidoreductases that belong to the thioredoxin (TRX) superfamily and generally bear a Cys-X-X-Cys/Ser active site. Using reduced glutathione as a reductant, they can catalyze thiol-disulfide redox reactions using two distinct mechanisms. The reduction of protein disulfides occurs through a dithiol mechanism that requires both active site cysteines (13Bushweller J.H. Aslund F. Wuthrich K. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9288-9293Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the reduction of glutathione-mixed disulfides can occur either through a monothiol mechanism, which only requires the N-terminal active site cysteine residue, or through a dithiol mechanism involving an additional cysteine (13Bushweller J.H. Aslund F. Wuthrich K. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9288-9293Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 14Tamarit J. Belli G. Cabiscol E. Herrero E. Ros J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25745-25751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). GRXs also possess a dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR) activity (15Wells W.W. Xu D.P. Yang Y.F. Rocque P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15361-15364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Washburn M.P. Wells W.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 268-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Classic GRXs have a redox potential between –190 and –230 mV at pH 7 (17Åslund F. Berndt K.D. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30780-30786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Deglutathionylation was shown to be catalyzed more efficiently by GRX than by other disulfide oxidoreductases such as TRX or protein disulfide isomerase from human or Escherichia coli (18Jung C.H.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4235-4242Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). However, considering the multiplicity of TRX isoforms in photosynthetic organisms (20Meyer Y. Riondet C. Constans L. Abdelgawwad M.R. Reichheld J.P. Vignols F. Photosynth. Res. 2006; 89: 179-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), it would be interesting to test whether one of these TRX might be able to catalyze deglutathionylation. GRXs are encoded by a multigenic family comprising ∼30 members in higher plants (21Lemaire S.D. Photosynth. Res. 2004; 79: 305-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 22Rouhier N. Gelhaye E. Jacquot J.P. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 1266-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The number is more limited in lower photosynthetic eukaryotes such as the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, which contains six GRXs (21Lemaire S.D. Photosynth. Res. 2004; 79: 305-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Plant GRXs have been divided into different types called CPYC, CGFS, and CC. The CC type, which comprises ∼20 members, is specific to higher plants. The CPYC type corresponds to “classic” GRXs possessing disulfide oxidoreductase, DHAR, and deglutathionylation activities. Cytosolic poplar GRXs, the only plant GRXs characterized to date, are all CPYC-type, have DHAR and disulfide reductase activities, and are able to reduce type II peroxiredoxins (23Rouhier N.

Chlamydomonas contains two members of this family, GRX1 and GRX2. No GRX with a classic CPYC active site is predicted to be present in chloroplasts (21Lemaire S.D. Photosynth.

Chloroplasts contain GRXs belonging to the CGFS group, four members of this group being present in both Arabidopsis and Chlamydomonas. This type of GRX is ubiquitous and corresponds to E. coli GRX4 and yeast GRX3, -4, and -5. In yeast, GRX5 is a mitochondrial GRX required for the assembly/bio-genesis of iron-sulfur clusters (28Rodriguez-Manzaneque M.T. Tamarit J. Belli G. Ros J. Herrero E. Mol. Biol.

The redox potential of yeast GRX5 was measured to be –175 mV (14Tamarit J. Belli G. Cabiscol E. Herrero E. Ros J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25745-25751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Yeast GRX5 was found to be able to catalyze protein-glutathione mixed disulfide reduction, but the physiological reductant of yeast GRX5 remains to be identified, whereas E. coli CGFS GRX4 was recently shown to be reduced by NADPH-thioredoxin reductase (31Fernandes A.P.

Chlamydomonas contains CGFS-type GRXs homologous to yeast GRX5 and yeast GRX3/4, named GRX5 and GRX4, which are predicted to be located in the mitochondria and the cytosol, respectively. The two other CGFS-type GRXs, GRX3 and GRX6, are predicted to be targeted to chloroplasts. GRX3 is a small GRX, similar to yeast GRX5, whereas GRX6 contains a C-terminal GRX domain and an N-terminal domain of unknown function. The plastidial localization of GRX3 homologue in Arabidopsis, GRX-S14, was recently confirmed experimentally (32Cheng N.H. Liu J.Z. Brock A. Nelson R.S. Hirschi K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26280-26288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Here we report the biochemical characterization of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii GRX1 and GRX3. GRX1 is the major cytosolic GRX and belongs to the classic CPYC type, whereas GRX3 is a chloroplastic protein, homologous to higher plants GRXS14 and belonging to the CGFS type. GRX3 is the most highly expressed GRX in Chlamydomonas and likely represents the major chloroplastic GRX (21Lemaire S.D. Photosynth. Res. 2004; 79: 305-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). For both GRXs, the kinetic parameters of the DHAR and disulfide reductase activities were measured. Deglutathionylation assays were performed with the standard HED assay but also using glutathionylated A4-GAPDH as a substrate. The efficiency of both GRX in the A4-GAPDH deglutathionylation assay were determined and compared with those of different types of plant TRXs. The results show that GRX1 possesses biochemical properties similar to CPYC-type GRXs from other organisms but that GRX3 exhibits unique properties, notably, the ability to be very efficiently reduced in the light by ferredoxin-thioredoxin reductase. Materials—NAP-5 columns were purchased from GE Healthcare. HED and DTNB were from Aldrich and Pierce, respectively. All the other reagents were from Sigma. Plasmid Construction for Expression of GRX1 and GRX3 in E. coli—C. reinhardtii GRX1 and GRX3 correspond to expressed sequence tag sequences AV623478 and AV390622, respectively. The corresponding cDNA clones were obtained from the Kazusa DNA Research Institute (Chiba, Japan) and used to amplify the sequence encoding the mature form of GRX1 and GRX3 by PCR. Specific endonuclease sites (bold) were introduced at the 5′- and 3′-ends of the coding sequences using the following primers: 5′NdeI-GAACAAC-CATATGCTCGCTACTCGTTCTGCTGC and 3′BamHIGGTCGGATCCTTACAGAGCACCGGCCTCCT for CrGRX1; 5′NcoI-CGCGCCATGGCTTCTGGAATGGCCCCCGA and 3′BamHI-TTCTGGATCCCTAGGAGTTGAGGGCAATCT for CrGRX3. The sequences encoding CrGRX1 and the putative mature form of CrGRX3 were cloned in a modified pET-3c or pET-3d vector containing additional codons upstream of the NdeI/NcoI site so as to express the protein with a polyhistidine tag at the N terminus. The sequence was checked by sequencing. Protein Expression and Purification—The pET vectors allowing expression of recombinant GRX1 and GRX3 were transformed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells, which were grown in LB medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C. Protein expression was induced at an A600 of 0.5 with 0.2 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C or for 18 h at 30 °C for CrGRX1 and CrGRX3, respectively. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 15 min, resuspended in 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, broken by three passages through a French press (6.9 × 107 Pa), and cleared by centrifugation at 39,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatants were applied onto a Ni2+ HiTrap chelating resin (HIS-Select® Nickel Affinity Gel, Sigma) pre-equilibrated with 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9. The recombinant proteins were then purified according to the manufacturer's instructions. The molecular mass and purity of the proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE after dialysis against 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA. The protein concentrations of GRX1 and GRX3 were determined spectrophotometrically using molar extinction coefficients at 280 nm of 4,595 m–1cm–1 and 11,585 m–1cm–1, respectively. The resulting homogeneous proteins were stored at –20 °C. A. thaliana NTRC coding sequence was cloned in pET-16b, and the protein was expressed and purified as described above for GRX3. The other recombinant proteins were produced and purified as previously described for C. reinhardtii TRXh1 (33Stein M. Jacquot J.P. Jeannette E. Decottignies P. Hodges M. Lance-lin J.M. Mittard V.

Dehydroascorbate Reductase Activity—The DHAR activity of GRX was carried out using a modified version of the standard thioltransferase activity (HED assay). The reaction contained 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm GSH, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 6 μg/ml yeast glutathione reductase, 200 μm NADPH, and 1 mm dehydroascorbate (DHA). After 1 min of preincubation, varying concentrations of GRX were added to the sample cuvette, while buffer was added to the reference cuvette. The decrease in absorbance at 340 nm was followed spectrophotometrically. GRX activity was determined after subtracting the spontaneous reduction of DHA by GSH observed in the absence of glutaredoxin. Activity was expressed as micromoles of NADPH oxidized/min. The apparent Km value for dehydroascorbate was determined using a DHA concentration range from 0.125 to 1 mm in the presence of 2 mm GSH. Three independent experiments were performed at each substrate concentration, and the apparent Km and kcat values were calculated by non-linear regression using the program CoStat (CoHort Software). Turbidimetric Assay of Insulin Disulfide Reduction—The rate of insulin disulfide reduction by Chlamydomonas TRXh1, GRX1, and GRX3 was monitored spectrophotometrically following the turbidity at 650 nm. The reaction mixture contained 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 or 7.9, 0.13 mm bovine insulin (0.75 mg/ml), 2 mm EDTA, and 5 μm of each redoxin (TRXh1, GRX1, or GRX3). The reaction was started by adding 0.33 mm DTT or 1 mm GSH as reductants. The nonenzymatic reduction of insulin by DTT or GSH was used as a control. Determination of Glutaredoxin Activity (HED Assay)—A mixture of 1 mm GSH, 0.2 mm NADPH, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 6 μg/ml yeast glutathione reductase was prepared in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9. To 500 μl of this mixture, HED was added at a final concentration of 0.7 mm. After 3 min glutaredoxin was added to the sample cuvette, and an equal amount of buffer to the reference cuvette. The decrease in absorbance at 340 nm was followed using a HITACHI U-3000 spectrophotometer. GRX activity was determined after subtracting the spontaneous reduction rate observed in the absence of glutaredoxin. Activity was expressed as micromoles of NADPH oxidized/min. The Km value for glutathione was determined using varying concentrations of GSH (0.5–3.5 mm) and 10 nm GRX1 in the presence of 0.7 mm HED. Three independent experiments were performed at each substrate concentration, and the apparent Km and kcat values were calculated by non-linear regression using the program CoStat. Analysis of Protein Thiol Content in C. reinhardtii GRX3—GRX3 samples (50 μm) were reduced or oxidized with 20 mm reduced DTT or oxidized DTT for 1 h at 25 °C followed by desalting on NAP-5 columns (Sephadex G-25) equilibrated with 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9. Oxidized GRX3 was subsequently treated with 5 mm GSH for 1 h at 25 °C, followed by desalting on NAP-5 columns. After desalting, the number of free thiols in GRX3 protein was determined spectrophotometrically with DTNB (38Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21624) Google Scholar). Briefly, 20–30 μm of protein were added to a solution containing 200 μm DTNB in 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9. After 10 min at room temperature the absorbance at 412 nm was determined. A molar extinction coefficient of 14150 m–1cm–1 was used to calculate the number of titrated sulfhydryl groups. Determination of the Redox Potential of GRX3—Before each redox titration experiment, GRX3 was desalted in 100 mm Tricine-NaOH, pH 7.9, using NAP-5 columns. Redox titration experiments were performed with 60 μm GRX3 incubated for 3 h at 25 °C with 20 mm DTT at various dithiol-disulfide ratios, in a total volume of 500 μl. Following incubation, samples were desalted using NAP-5 columns equilibrated with 100 mm Tricine-NaOH, pH 7.9. To avoid any possible DTT contamination, only 700 μl of eluted samples (1 ml) was collected. Absorbance at 280 nm was recorded immediately after desalting, subsequently 0.2 mm DTNB was added and the absorbance at 412 nm was measured. Control experiments were performed under the same conditions but in the absence of GRX3. The number of free thiol groups under different redox conditions was calculated from the ratio between the absorbance at 412 nm (molar extinction coefficient: 14150 m–1cm–1) and the absorbance at 280 nm (molar extinction coefficient: 11585 m–1cm–1 for CrGrx3). The titration results were fitted by non-linear regression (CoStat) to the Nernst equation setting the value of n to 2 (the disulfide-dithiol is expected to be a two-electron transfer process), according to previous studies (39Hutchison R.S. Ort D.R. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 220-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 40Hirasawa M. Schürmann P. Jacquot J.P. Manieri W. Jacquot P. Keryer E. Hartman F.C. Knaff D.B.

Deglutathionylation Assays—A4-GAPDH was glutathionylated as described before (11Zaffagnini M. Michelet L. Marchand C. Sparla F. Decottignies P. Le Marechal P. Miginiac-Maslow M. Noctor G. Trost P. Lemaire S.D. FEBS J. 2007; 274: 212-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Briefly, the protein (2.5 μm) was incubated with 0.1 mm H2O2 in the presence of 0.5 mm GSH in 100 mm Tricine-NaOH, pH 7.9. After 15-min incubation, aliquots were withdrawn and 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (BPGA, produced by mixing 5 units/ml of 3-phosphoglycerate kinase, 2 mm ATP, and 3 mm 3-phosphoglycerate) was added to prevent enzyme activity from any further inactivation. Deglutathionylation assays were performed in the following conditions: I, 20 mm reduced DTT and 5 mm GSH as control; II, NADPH-thioredoxin system (0.3 mm NADPH, 0.2 μm A. thaliana NADPH-thioredoxin reductase B plus varying concentrations of TRXh1); III, GSH-glutaredoxin system (5 mm GSH plus 5 μm GRX3 or variable amounts of GRX1); and IV, variable concentrations of GRX3 in the presence of the complete reconstituted light activation system comprising thylakoids, ferredoxin, and ferredoxin-thioredoxin reductase as described (9Michelet L. Zaffagnini M. Marchand C. Collin V. Decottignies P. Tsan P. Lancelin J.M. Trost P. Miginiac-Maslow M. Noctor G. Lemaire S.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

GRX3 Contains an Intramolecular Disulfide—Yeast GRX5 and E. coli GRX4 are CGFS-type GRXs, which have been shown to contain a disulfide between the cysteine of the CGFS active site and a cysteine located in the C-terminal part of the protein (14Tamarit J.

This C-terminal cysteine is conserved in many CGFS-type GRX, including Chlamydomonas GRX3 (21Lemaire S.D. Photosynth. Res. 2004; 79: 305-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). To determine if GRX3 contains a disulfide, the purified enzyme was incubated with reduced or oxidized DTT, and the number of free thiols was quantified using DTNB. Although reduced GRX3, whose amino acid sequence includes two Cys, was experimentally found to contain two reactive thiols (1.98 ± 0.18), GRX3 treated with oxidized DTT contained 0.34 ± 0.05 free thiols. Moreover, oxidized and reduced GRX3 appear as monomers on SDS-PAGE performed in reducing and non-reducing conditions (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that GRX3 contains an intramolecular disulfide bond between the two cysteines of the protein and therefore may be able to catalyze disulfide bonds reduction through either a monothiol or a dithiol mechanism. DHAR Activity—Because GRXs have the ability to catalyze the reduction of DHA by glutathione (15Wells W.W. Xu D.P. Yang Y.F. Rocque P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15361-15364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Washburn M.P. Wells W.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 268-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), we tested whether Chlamydomonas GRX1 and GRX3 were able to accelerate the spontaneous reduction of dehydroascorbate by GSH. To minimize the rapid non-enzymatic reduction of DHA by GSH at high pH values, the assays were performed at pH 7.0. The reaction was followed by measuring the NADPH oxidation in a coupled system as described under “Experimental Procedures.” First, we analyzed the dependence of DHAR activity on glutaredoxin concentrations. The DHAR activity of GRX1 displayed a linear relationship with increasing protein concentrations in the 0–1 μm range (Fig. 1). The kinetic analysis of the DHAR activity revealed an apparent Km value of 0.39 ± 0.03 mm for DHA and a kcat of 1.67 ± 0.09 s–1 (Table 1). These values are comparable to those reported for other CPYC-type GRXs (15Wells W.W. Xu D.P. Yang Y.F. Rocque P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15361-15364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Washburn M.P. Wells W.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 268-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In contrast to GRX1, GRX3 was totally unable to reduce DHA into ascorbic acid (data not shown) as previously described for yeast GRX5 (14Tamarit J. Belli G. Cabiscol E. Herrero E. Ros J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25745-25751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar).TABLE 1Kinetic parameters of Chlamydomonas GRX1 in the DHA reductase assayKmkcatkcat/Kmmms-1m-1s-1GRX10.39 ± 0.031.67 ± 0.094.3 × 103 Open table in a new tab Insulin Reduction by TRXh1, GRX1, and GRX3—Insulin reduction is a classic assay to test disulfide reductase activity (41Holmgren A.

This activity has been used to determine whether the two GRXs were able to reduce disulfide-bridged insulin, using cytosolic TRXh1 from Chlamydomonas as a control. As expected, TRXh1 started to efficiently reduce insulin after a lag phase of ∼6–8 min (Fig. 2A). Although much less efficient than TRXh1, GRX1 was able to reduce insulin disulfides in the presence of DTT (Fig. 2B). In addition, GRX1 also reduced insulin disulfides using GSH as a reductant but much less efficiently than in the presence of DTT. By contrast, GRX3 did not display any activity in the"

Escherichia coli DnaA protein forms a homomultimeric complex with the replication origin (oriC). ATP-DnaA multimers unwind the duplex within the oriC unwinding element (DUE). In this study, structural analyses suggested that several residues exposed in the central pore of the putative structure of DnaA multimers could be important for unwinding. Using mutation analyses, we found that, of these candidate residues, DnaA Val-211 and Arg-245 are prerequisites for initiation in vivo and in vitro. Whereas DnaA V211A and R245A proteins retained normal affinities for ATP/ADP and DNA and activity for the ATP-specific conformational change of the initiation complex in vitro, oriC complexes of these mutant proteins were inactive in DUE unwinding and in binding to the single-stranded DUE.

Domain III has specific ATP recognition motifs that are characteristic of the AAA+ superfamily, of which DnaA is a member (20Iyer L.M. Leipe D.D. Koonin E.V. Aravind L. J. Struct.

Domain IV is a DNA-binding region that contains a helix-turn-helix motif for specific recognition of the DnaA box (22Erzberger J.P. Pirruccello M.M. Berger J.M.

Wilkinson A.J. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 575-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). Of the AAA+-specific ATP-interacting motifs, the DnaA sensor 1 Asp-269 residue supports exceptionally tight affinity for ATP/ADP (26Kawakami H. Ozaki S. Suzuki S. Nakamura K. Senriuchi T. Su'etsugu M. Fujimitsu K. Katayama T. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 62: 1310-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The DnaA sensor 2 Arg-334 is specifically required for RIDA-dependent ATP hydrolysis (27Nishida S. Fujimitsu K. Sekimizu K. Ohmura T. Ueda T. Katayama T. J. Biol.

The DnaA Box VII arginines Arg-281 and Arg-285 most likely interact in different manners with an adjacent DnaA protomer in DnaA multimers assembled on oriC. Arg-281 stabilizes the DnaA multimers (29Felczak M.M. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51156-51162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Notably Arg-285 plays a crucial role in the ATP-specific conformational change of the initiation complex, which is required for open complex formation (7Kawakami H. Keyamura K. Katayama T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27420-27430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This residue is specifically required for binding of ATP-DnaA protomers to the specific low affinity sites within oriC. On the basis of common features of AAA+ proteins, it has been suggested that Arg-285 interacts with ATP bound to an adjacent DnaA protomer in the complex, which leads to conformational activation of the complex. In well characterized AAA+ proteins, a typical functional conformation is ring- or spiral-shaped oligomers (consisting of 5–7 protomers) with a central cavity or pore (24Hanson P.I. Whiteheart S.W. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). Certain residues within the pore are crucial for specific functions of proteases, chaperones, SV40 T-Ag helicase, and DNA polymerase III clamp-loader subassembly (30Enemark E.J. Joshua-Tor L. Nature. 2006; 442: 270-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 31Kumar A. Meinke G. Reese D.K. Moine S. Phelan P.J. Fradet-Turcotte A. Archambault J. Bohm A. Bullock P.A. J.

Biol. 2005; 12: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). By analogy to these structures, we hypothesized that DnaA molecules oligomerize to form a central pore on oriC and that specific residues on the pore surface play a crucial role in duplex unwinding. However, DnaA does not carry residues in its primary sequence that directly correspond to the important residues within the pores of the AAA+ proteins previously characterized. DnaA is structurally classified into a subgroup different from the proteases, chaperones, helicases, and clamp-loaders in the AAA+ superfamily (20Iyer L.M. Leipe D.D. Koonin E.V. Aravind L. J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 146: 11-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Furthermore, unlike the well characterized AAA+ proteins, DNA-free DnaA molecules are monomers. In this study, we first constructed homology models of the DnaA oligomer that forms a pore using a crystal structure of the AAA+ domain of the hyperthermophilic eubacterium Thermotoga maritima DnaA ortholog (tmaDnaA). Next, we used this model to select candidates for the crucial residues on the pore surface of DnaA and analyzed the corresponding mutant proteins of tmaDnaA and E. coli DnaA. The candidate residues were highly conserved in DnaA orthologs. The results of our in vitro analyses are in good agreement with this structure. We found that E. coli DnaA V211A and R245A proteins are inactive in in vivo initiation. Moreover, we revealed using in vitro reconstituted systems that these mutant proteins are specifically inactive in origin unwinding, whereas these retain activities for binding to ATP and DnaA boxes and for the formation of the ATP-DnaA-specific multimer conformation on oriC. Furthermore, using a newly constructed system of an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), we revealed that the ATP form of these mutant DnaA multimers on oriC, unlike that of wild-type DnaA, are inactive in direct binding to ssDUE. Thus, we have revealed specific roles for the previously unexpected residues in open complex formation. These residues reside on the putative pore of the DnaA multimer on oriC and play crucial and specific roles in oriC unwinding. Thus we propose a novel mechanism for ATP-dependent regulation of open complex formation.

DnaA was incubated at 30 °C for 10 min in buffer (10 μl) containing 25 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.6), 5 mm calcium acetate, 2.8 mm magnesium acetate, 45 mm ammonium sulfate, 4 mm dithiothreitol, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 14 μg/ml poly(dA-dT)-(dA-dT), 14 μg/ml poly(dI-dC)-(dI-dC), 3 mm ATP/ADP, and a 419-bp 32P-end-labeled oriC fragment (5.5 ng), followed by incubation for 4 min at the same temperature in the presence of DNase I (0.63 milliunit). After the reaction was stopped by addition of 0.5% SDS, DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, and analyzed by 5% sequencing gel electrophoresis. ssDUE Binding Analysis by EMSA—DnaA was incubated at 0 °C for 15 min in the presence of 3 mm ATP or ADP as we previously described (26Kawakami H. Ozaki S. Suzuki S. Nakamura K. Senriuchi T. Su'etsugu M. Fujimitsu K. Katayama T. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 62: 1310-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). ATP-DnaA and ADP-DnaA were incubated at 30 °C for 10 min in 10 μl of buffer G containing 13 nm (130 fmol) oriCΔLMR DNA and 2 nm (20 fmol) 32P-end-labeled M28 ssDNA (5′-GATCTGTTCTATTGTGATCTCTTATTAG), its complementary M28-rev ssDNA, or its derivatives. Buffer G contains 20 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.6), 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 4 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm ATP or ADP. The mixtures were then separated by 4% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at room temperature. DNA was visualized using GelStar (Cambrex) staining, and ssDNA was detected using a BAS-2500 Bio-imaging analyzer. The oriCΔLMR fragment was prepared by PCR using M13KEW101 and primers ori-1 (5′-ATCGCACTGCCCTGTGG) and ori-2 (5′-CAAATAAGTATACAGATCGTGCG). ssDUE Binding Analysis Using Pull-down System—DnaA and 32P-end-labeled M28 ssDNA were incubated under the same conditions described for EMSA except that 5′-biotinylated oriCΔLMR (bio-oriCΔLMR) was used instead of unmodified oriCΔLMR. The reaction was further incubated for 10 min at room temperature with gentle rotation in the presence of streptavidin-beads (Promega) equilibrated in the buffer G (10 μl). The beads and bound materials were collected and washed in the same buffer (20 μl). M28 ssDNA complexed with bio-oriCΔLMR and DnaA was eluted in buffer (10 μl) containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5 at 1 m), 1 mm EDTA and 0.1% SDS, spotted on the 3MM paper (Whatman) and analyzed using a BAS-2500 Bio-imaging analyzer. The bio-oriCΔLMR fragment was prepared by PCR using primers ori-1 and 5′-biotinylated ori-2. Structural Models of the Initiation Complex—By analogy to some AAA+ protein multimers, we hypothesized that DnaA multimers on oriC have a central pore that plays a crucial role in DUE unwinding. To predict which residues comprise the putative pore, we first identified the crystal structure of tmaDnaA AAA+ domain (Fig. 1A, Table 1, and supplemental “Experimental Procedures”) and then constructed homology models of the multimeric structure using this crystal structure (Fig. 1, C and D). The crystal structure of tmaDnaA AAA+ domain bound to ADP was solved at 3.05 Å and was basically identical to that of Aquifex aeolicus DnaA AAA+ domain (Fig. 1B) (22Erzberger J.P. Pirruccello M.M.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4763-4773Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar).TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statistics of tmaDnaA crystalsSpace groupR32C2Unit cella = b = 221.82 Å, c = 55.60 Å, α, β = 90°, γ = 120°a = 133.34 Å, b = 221.79 Å, c = 55.60 Å, β = 106.13°Resolution (Å)50.0-3.0050.0-3.05Unique reflections10,29027,730Redundancy3.72.3Completeness (%) (last shell)96.3 (74.6)94.1 (68.3)I/σ(I) (last shell)13.4 (2.46)13.7 (2.31)Rsym (%) (last shell)aRsym = Σ|Iavg — Ii|/ΣIi.7.8 (35.1)7.0 (29.7)Rwork (%)23.423.2Rfree (%)29.126.4a Rsym = Σ|Iavg — Ii|/ΣIi. Open table in a new tab Using the model of a homohexamer ring (Fig. 1C), we searched for the residues that are exposed on the pore surface. We particularly focused on residues bearing hydrophobic or basic side chains that would interact favorably with DNA. tmaDnaA Val-176, Met-179, Lys-180, and Lys-209 residues were found to be strong candidates (Fig. 1E). Identical or chemically similar residues corresponding to these are highly conserved among eubacterial DnaA homologs (Fig. 1F). During the course of this study, a multimeric crystal structure was reported for the A. aeolicus DnaA AAA+ domain (37Erzberger J.P. Mott M.L. Berger J.M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 676-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Although this complex does not include the cognate oriC DNA, the multimers form a spiral helix in crystals. We therefore used this structure as a second model (Fig. 1D). The residues indicated above are also exposed on the pore of this spiral model (Fig. 1E). Analyses of tmaDnaA Mutant Proteins—Using tmaDnaA and the predicted oriC (tma-oriC) of T. maritima, we previously determined the minimal oriC region and ATP-tmaDnaA-specific DUE in vitro (34Ozaki S. Fujimitsu K. Kurumizaka H. Katayama T. Genes Cells. 2006; 11: 425-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). ATP-tmaDnaA-dependent unwinding within tma-oriC DUE can be assessed by P1 nuclease. To elucidate the functions of the selected residues, we analyzed a set of tmaDnaA mutant proteins with single-alanine substitutions at Val-176, Met-179, Lys-180, or Lys-209. All of the mutant tmaDnaA proteins were purified by the method reported previously for wild-type tmaDnaA. The ATP binding activities of the mutant proteins were similar to that of wild-type tmaDnaA (Table 2). In an EMSA, the tmaDnaA box binding activity of each mutant protein was similar to that of wild-type tmaDnaA (data not shown). In contrast to these activities, tma-oriC unwinding was severely inhibited in each tmaDnaA mutant protein (Fig. 1G).TABLE 2ATP binding activity of the mutant DnaAPositiontmaDnaAE. coli DnaAProteinKDStoichiometryProteinKDStoichiometrynmnmWT240.22WT490.45iV176A240.20V211A210.45iiM179A230.24iiiK180A220.23ivK223A220.30vK209A320.31K243A720.37viR245A410.27 Open table in a new tab E. coli DnaA Mutants Inactive in in Vivo Initiation—To assess the in vivo significance of these residues, we constructed plasmids encoding E. coli DnaA mutant proteins that have Ala substitutions at the positions corresponding to the tmaDnaA residues indicated above (Fig. 1, E and F). The E. coli DnaA residues Val-211 to Ile-219 reside in a region corresponding to that of tmaDnaA Val-176 to Lys-180 or in its flanking region (positions i–iii in Fig. 1F). E. coli DnaA Lys-243 and Arg-245 residues reside in a region corresponding to tmaDnaA Lys-209 and Gly-211 (positions v and vi, respectively, in Fig. 1F). tma-DnaA Gly-211 is exposed on the pore surface (Fig. 1E). Some DnaA orthologs conserve the basic moiety corresponding to E. coli DnaA Arg-245. In addition, we analyzed E. coli DnaA Lys-223 and Arg-224 (Lys-223 corresponds to position iv in Fig. 1F). These residues have basic side chains that are conserved in this region of DnaA orthologs. To determine the importance of these residues in vivo, we performed plasmid complementation tests (Table 3). First, we used as a host a dnaA46 mutant strain, KA413, that is defective in colony formation at 42 °C. The initiation activity of the DnaA46 protein is temperature-sensitive, and the protein is labile at 42 °C, with a shortened half-life in vivo (33Shimuta T. Nakano K. Yamaguchi Y. Ozaki S.

Chem. 1988; 263: 10625-10632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The first series of DnaA-producing plasmids bearing wild-type or mutant dnaA alleles was introduced into KA413 cells, and the transformant cells were incubated overnight at 30 °C or 42 °C (Table 3, experiment A). At 30 °C, colonies formed with a similar efficiency among the plasmids, whereas the plasmids bearing the dnaA V211A allele (pKW44-1) and dnaA K223A allele (pKW47-1) did not support colony formation at 42 °C. In these experiments, the inducer arabinose was not included in the medium, thereby allowing only leaky expression. Immunoblot analysis indicated that DnaA proteins were expressed from the plasmids at a similar level even at 42 °C (supplemental Fig. S1).TABLE 3Plasmid complementation testsExperimentHostPlasmidAlleleTransformation efficiencyaCFU, colony-forming units; WT, wild-type.30 °C42 °C42 °C/30 °CCFU/μg DNAAbFor experiment A, KA413 (dnaA46) cells were transformed with plasmid bearing the indicated dnaA allele and incubated on LB agar plates containing thymine (50 μg/ml) and ampicillin (50 μg/ml) at 30 °C for 21 h or at 42 °C for 12 h.

Here we report that cyclin L1 and L2 genes generate 14 mRNA variants encoding six cyclin L proteins, one of which has not been described previously. Using cyclin L gene-specific antibodies, we demonstrate expression of multiple endogenous cyclin L proteins in human cell lines and mouse tissues. Moreover, we characterize interactions between CDK11p110, mitosis-specific CDK11p58, and apoptosis-specific CDK11p46 with both cyclin Lα and -β proteins and the co-elution of these proteins following size exclusion chromatography. We further establish that CDK11p110 and associated cyclin Lα/β proteins localize to splicing factor compartments and nucleoplasm and interact with serine/arginine-rich proteins.

Finally, we demonstrate that expression of cyclins Lα and -β and CDK11p110 strongly and differentially affects alternative splicing in vivo.

Thus far, CDK7, CDK8, and CDK9 functions are ascribed to transcriptional initiation and elongation, and CDK12 (CrkRS) and CDK13 (CDC2L5) functions are related to pre-mRNA splicing (2Chen H.H.

We have shown that soluble nuclear extracts contain two macromolecular CDK11p110 protein complexes of 1–2 MDa and ∼800 kDa. These complexes contain transcription-related proteins such as the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II, FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription), CK2, and general transcription factor IIF.

Recently, CDK11p58, in association with cyclin D3, was reported to negatively affect androgen receptor transcriptional activity, whereas CDK11p110 positively affected transcription of numerous reporter genes (20Zong H.

Similarly, CDK11 was identified as a positive regulator of hedgehog signaling in both fly and vertebrate cells (21Nybakken K. Vokes S.A. Lin T-Y. McMahon A.P. Perrimon N. Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 1323-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). We have also identified two splicing factors, RNPS1 (22Loyer P. Trembley J.H. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1495-1506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and 9G8 (6Hu D. Mayeda A. Trembley J.H. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8623-8629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), as partners for CDK11p110. RNPS1 is an SR protein that functions as a general activator of splicing, promotes alternative splicing in a substrate-specific manner, and is a component of the exon-exon junction complex. RNPS1 co-immunoprecipitates with CDK11p110, and both RNPS1 and CDK11p110 are phosphorylated by CK2 (23Trembley J.H. Hu D. Slaughter C.A. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J. J. Biol.

The general splicing factor 9G8, which also promotes the nucleocytoplasmic export of mRNA, co-immunoprecipitates with CDK11p110 and is a CDK11p110 substrate. A role for CDK11p110 in pre-mRNA splicing was confirmed using conventional in vitro splicing assays that showed that immunodepletion of the CDK11p110 kinase from nuclear extracts greatly reduced splicing activity (6Hu D. Mayeda A. Trembley J.H. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8623-8629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The cyclin L1 (Ania-6a) gene is alternatively spliced to produce mRNAs encoding three putative proteins, cyclins L1α,-β, and -γ (13Berke J.D. Sgambato V. Zhu P.P. Lavoie B. Vincent M. Krause M. Hyman S.E. Neuron. 2001; 32: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Cyclin L1α, the largest isoform, is an atypical 526-amino acid cyclin consisting of an N-terminal cyclin box and a C-terminal RS domain similar to that of SR proteins. Cyclin L1β, a 232-amino acid protein, contains the entire cyclin box but lacks the RS domain. Similarly, the 172-amino acid cyclin L1γ protein is a C-terminal truncated version of cyclin L1β. The cyclin L2 (Ania-6b) gene encodes two putative proteins, cyclins L2α and -β, that are structurally similar to cyclins L1α and L1β (13Berke J.D. Sgambato V. Zhu P.P. Lavoie B. Vincent M. Krause M. Hyman S.E. Neuron. 2001; 32: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The observation that cyclins L1α and L2α contain an RS domain and the finding that they both co-immunoprecipitate with CDK11p110 are consistent with a role for CDK11p110-cyclin L1/2α complexes in pre-mRNA splicing. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that cyclin L1α is an immobile component of the splicing factor compartment (25Herrmann A. Fleischer K. Czajkowska H. Muller-Newen G. Becker W. FASEB J. 2007; 21: 3142-3152Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) that is also associated with hyperphosphorylated RNA polymerase II (13Berke J.D. Sgambato V. Zhu P.P. Lavoie B. Vincent M.

Other support for a functional role of CDK11p110-cyclin L complexes in splicing includes data from our group revealing that CDK11p110, cyclin L1α, and 9G8 form a ternary complex and that 9G8 is phosphorylated by CDK11p110 and data from others demonstrating that bacterially produced cyclins L1α and L2α stimulate splicing in an in vitro assay (7Dickinson L.A.

Cell Culture, Transfection, and Retroviral Infection—HuH7, HEK 293T, HeLa, NB9, NB13, and human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 2% l-glutamine. Histopaque-1077 (Sigma)-purified lymphocytes were cultured for 4 days from peripheral blood obtained from healthy donors in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, 2% l-glutamine, and 2% phytohemagglutinin (PHA, M-form; catalog number 10576-015 Invitrogen). Recombinant Protein Production—His6-tagged cDNAs encoding full-length cyclins L1α, L1β, L2α, and L2β and His6-tagged cyclin L1α peptide (amino acids 314–369) were cloned into the pQE expression vector (Qiagen), expressed in M15[pREP4] bacteria, and purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni2+-NTA) affinity under denaturing conditions according to the manufacturer's protocol (The QIAexpressionist™, Qiagen). Purified proteins were renatured by gradual elimination of denaturing agent, and beads were resuspended in in vitro splicing assay compatible buffer containing 20 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 8), 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 20% glycerol. 9G8 was produced as described previously (6Hu D.

Mayeda (University of Miami, FL). GST-cyclin L2α (amino acids 307–379) was expressed in BL21 bacteria and purified using GSH-Sepharose™ 4B (Amersham Biosciences) using the manufacturer's protocol. Antibodies—The CDK11 antibodies P2N100 and P1C have been described previously (12Trembley J.H. Loyer P. Hu D. Li T. Grenet J. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol.

The cyclin L antibodies were produced by immunization of rabbits with purified His6-tagged full-length cyclin L1β (pan-L antibody), His6-tagged cyclin L1α peptide (cyclin L1α-specific antibody, amino acids 314–369), or GST-cyclin L2α peptide (cyclin L2α-specific antibody, amino acids 307–379). The antibodies were affinity-purified by column chromatography using the recombinant proteins described above. Antibodies recognizing HA tag (Roche Applied Science), FLAG tag (M2, Sigma), CK2α (C-18), SF2/ASF (P-15), 9G8 (H-120) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), PCNA (PC10, Dako), and SR proteins (1H4, Zymed Laboratories Inc.) were used as described by the manufacturer. The anti-SR mAb 1H4 recognizes five proteins (SRp75, SRp55, SRp40, SRp30a/b, and SRp20) and several other bands that have not been fully characterized (27Neugebauer K.M. Roth M.B. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1148-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Chromatography/Size Fractionation—Size fractionation analysis was carried out using a Superose 6 column (Amersham Biosciences). Protein standards of 737, 460, 170, 67, and 25 kDa were used to calibrate the column. Mouse liver was sonicated in 50 mm phosphate (pH 7), 150 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 1× protease inhibitors (Complete EDTA-free, Roche Applied Science). Lysates were centrifuged twice at 14,000 rpm for 20 min. One mg of liver lysate or HeLaScribe® nuclear extract (Promega) was loaded onto the column, and 1-ml fractions were collected. Immunoblots, Immunoprecipitations, and Immunofluorescence—For immunoblot analysis, human cell lines and mouse tissues were washed in PBS and lysed by brief sonication as described previously (22Loyer P. Trembley J.H. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1495-1506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 20 min, and the protein concentration was determined. Immunoprecipitation (IP) of endogenous CDK11 protein kinases was performed using 293T and PBC cell lysates. IP of FLAG-tagged CDK11 and HA-tagged cyclin L proteins was performed using cell lysates of 293T cells harvested 48 h after transfection using JetPEI (Qbiogene). In all IP experiments, cell lysates were incubated overnight with antibodies (500 μg of lysate, 1 μg of antibody) and then incubated for 2 h with Gamma-Bind Plus-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) rotating at 4 °C. The beads were then washed four times with lysis buffer, and immunoblot analysis was performed as described previously (22Loyer P. Trembley J.H. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1495-1506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All immunofluorescence assays were performed using HFF cells grown on coverslips, fixed with cold methanol at -20 °C for 10 min, and rinsed with PBS. Expression of HA-tagged cyclin L proteins was accomplished using retroviruses encoding cyclin L proteins produced by transfection of the 293T Phoenix amphotropic cell line (ATCC) with pMSCV-HA-cyclin L-IRES-GFP vectors. The incubations with primary antibodies were performed for 1 h at 37 °C in PBS containing 0.1% casein. Anti-rabbit, anti-mouse, and anti-rat fluorescent secondary antibodies labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes) and Cy3 (Jackson ImmunoResearch) were used as described above. Pulldown Assays, Nuclear Extract Depletion, and in Vitro Splicing Assays—Pulldown assays for SR proteins and depletion experiments were performed by incubating 36 μg (3 μl) of HeLaScribe® nuclear extract adjusted to 15 μl with in vitro splicing assay compatible buffer with His6-cyclin L Ni2+-NTA beads (1 μg of protein/20 μl of beads) or control beads (20 μl) for 1 h on ice. The beads were extensively washed with the binding buffer prior to use for immunoblot analysis or splicing assays (22Loyer P. Trembley J.H. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1495-1506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the splicing assays, 32P-labeled β-globin pre-mRNA substrate was prepared by in vitro transcription using SP6 RNA polymerase and linearized pSP64-HβΔE6 plasmid as the template (28Mayeda A. Krainer A.R. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 118: 315-321PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro splicing reactions were carried out in a final volume of 25 μl containing HeLaScribe® nuclear extract (36 μg/15 μl) and splicing assay mix (10 μl) containing 0.5 mm ATP, 20 mm creatine phosphate, 8 mm MgCl2, 200 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.3), 6.5% polyvinyl alcohol, and 20 fmol of 32P-labeled β-globin pre-mRNA substrate. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 4 h. The spliced RNA products were analyzed by autoradiography following electrophoresis on a 5.5% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gel. In Vivo β-Galactosidase/Luciferase Splicing Assays—293T cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) as described by the manufacturer with the splicing reporter vector pTN24 (1 μg) (29Nasim M.T. Chowdhury H.M. Eperon I.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e109Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and constructs expressing cyclin L (3 μg) and CDK11 (3 μg). The cyclin L constructs were subcloned into the pFlex vector with an N-terminal FLAG tag, and the CDK11 p110, p110ΔRE (deletion of amino acids 127–220), and p58 constructs were subcloned into the pUHD 10-3 vector with a C-terminal FLAG tag. The CDK11 p46 construct, containing a nuclear localization signal at the N terminus and a FLAG tag at the C terminus, was subcloned into the pTet-1 vector. The pTet-1 vector has a pcDNA 3.1 backbone with the tetracycline-responsive promoter replacing the cytomegalovirus promoter. Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection for the enzymatic assays. β-Galactosidase and luciferase activities were measured using the Dual-Light® Assay System (Applied Biosystems) (24Trembley J.H. Tatsumi S. Sakashita E. Loyer P. Slaughter C.A. Suzuki H. Endo H. Kidd V.J. Mayeda A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 1446-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). 3–9 transfected samples were measured in quadruplicate per data point. Immunoblot analyses of equal volume cell lysates were performed. Statistical significance analyses for various pairwise comparisons were performed using a nonparametric rank-based test (see supplemental “Experimental Procedures” for an R-subroutine used in the analyses). E1A in Vivo Splicing Assays—HuH7 hepatoma cells in 60-mm dishes were co-transfected using transfectin (Bio-Rad) via the manufacturer's instructions with pCEP4-E1A (1.2 μg) (30Lai M.C. Kuo H.W. Chang W.C. Tarn W.Y. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1359-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) (gift from Dr. Tarn W-Y, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Taipei, Taiwan) and expression vectors (5 μg) for CDK11 p110 WT or DN (pMSCV-IRES-GFP) and HA-cyclin L isoforms (pcDNA 3.0). Total plasmid amount was equalized for each transfection using the appropriate empty vector. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). The RNAs were further treated using the RNase-free DNase I kit (Qiagen). RT was performed using 5 μg of total RNAs, the SuperScript™ II RNase H- reverse transcriptase kit, and the E1A-specific primer CGGTATTCCACATTTGGACACT (P2). For detection of E1A splice variants, 2 μl of the RT reaction was used as template, and PCR amplification (Takara ExTaq, 50 μl, 35 cycles) was performed using primers CAAGCTTGAGTGCCAGCGAGTAG (P1) and CTCAGGTTCAGACACAGG (P3). PCR products were visualized via 1% agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide using Bio-Vision fluorescence image acquisition system (Vilber-Lourmat, Fisher-Bioblock, France) and quantitated using Bio-1D software (Vilber-Lourmat, Fisher-Bioblock). The percentage of each transcript signal relative to the total amount of the five splice forms was calculated for each sample and expressed relative to the appropriate control splice form percentages, which were set equal to 1. Cyclin L1 and L2 Genomic Organization, mRNA Splice Variants, and Translation Products—We identified nine distinct mRNA splice variants from the human cyclin L1 gene by RT-PCR in human tissues (supplemental Data 1) and HFF cells (data not shown). This gene, located on chromosome 3q23.2–3 (7Dickinson L.A. Edgar A.J. Ehley J. Gottesfeld J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25465-25473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), contains 14 exons and spans ∼12.3 kb. From these nine mRNAs, three distinct open frames were found encoding the three cyclin L1 protein isoforms, L1α, L1β, and L1γ. All of the cyclin L1 isoforms share a similar N-terminal sequence, encoded by exons 1–3, which contains the cyclin box domain and diverge in their C termini (2Chen H.H. Wang Y.C. Fann M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 2736-2745Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The cyclin L1α protein exhibits an extended C terminus with an Arg/Ser (RS) di-peptide region characteristic of splicing factors, which is not present in the β or γ isoforms. Importantly, because of the location of the translational stop sequences, cyclin L1β and L1γ proteins contain 7 and 9 amino acid C-terminal peptides, respectively, which are specific for these two isoforms (Table 1). The human cyclin L2 gene spans ∼11.8 kb on chromosome 1 (1p36.33) (8Yang L. Li N. Wang C. Yu Y. Yuan L. Zhang M. Cao X. J. Biol.

This gene is comprised of 14 exons and encodes five distinct mRNA variants identified by RT-PCR in human tissues (supplemental Data 2) and HFF cells (data not shown). The products contain three distinct open reading frames. The largest isoform, cyclin L2α, is encoded by the shortest mRNA transcript, and the protein domain composition of L2α is identical to that of L1α. The cyclin L2βA and L2βB isoforms differ by only 2 and 12 amino acids, respectively, in their C-terminal ends (Table 1). The exon and intron lengths for the cyclin L1 and L2 genes are summarized in supplemental Table 1.TABLE 114 alternatively spliced mRNAs encode six cyclin L1 and L2 protein isoforms Alternative splicing of cyclin L1 and L2 genes generates 14 mRNAs that encode six proteins.

Similar data were obtained by Northern blot analyses of cyclin L1 and L2 gene expression in various human tissues and cell lines (supplemental Data 3). Furthermore, these analyses confirmed the expression of 2.3- and 4.5-kb cyclin L1 and L2 mRNA species in human cells as reported by others (7Dickinson L.A. Edgar A.J. Ehley J. Gottesfeld J.M. J.

Although the RT-PCR experiments are not quantitative, the relative abundance of the L1 and L2 splice variants detected differs slightly between tissues suggesting there are different levels of cyclin L isoform expression in the cell types tested. Cyclins L1α and L2α Are Nuclear Proteins That Co-localize with CDK11p110 Protein Kinase—To study expression of cyclin L proteins and investigate formation of complexes with CDK11 kinases in mammalian cells, we raised rabbit polyclonal anti-cyclin L antibodies recognizing various cyclin L isoforms. Independent immunizations were carried out using bacterial recombinant full-length cyclin L1β and two peptides corresponding to amino acids 314–369 for cyclin L1α and 307–379 for cyclin L2α. These two peptides, which are located in a short region connecting the cyclin box and RS domain, demonstrate very low homology between cyclins L1α and L2α and are absent in cyclins L1β/γ and L2β. To assess the specificity of these antibodies, immunoblot analyses were performed using cell extracts from 293T cells transfected with expression vectors encoding HA-tagged cyclin L proteins (Fig. 1A)"

https://openalex.org/W2145024578,"The fidelity with which spinal motor neurons innervate their limb target muscles helps to coordinate motor behavior, but the mechanisms that determine precise patterns of nerve-muscle connectivity remain obscure. We show that Nkx6 proteins, a set of Hox-regulated homeodomain transcription factors, are expressed by motor pools soon after motor neurons leave the cell cycle, before the formation of muscle nerve side branches in the limb. Using mouse genetics, we show that the status of Nkx6.1 expression in certain motor neuron pools regulates muscle nerve formation, and the pattern of innervation of individual muscles. Our findings provide genetic evidence that neurons within motor pools possess an early transcriptional identity that controls target muscle specificity."
https://openalex.org/W2054960994,"Group II introns are ribozymes, removing themselves from their primary transcripts, as well as mobile genetic elements, transposing via an RNA intermediate, and are thought to be the ancestors of spliceosomal introns. Although common in bacteria and most eukaryotic organelles, they have never been reported in any bilaterian animal genome, organellar or nuclear. Here we report the first group II intron found in the mitochondrial genome of a bilaterian worm. This location is especially surprising, since animal mitochondrial genomes are generally distinct from those of plants, fungi, and protists by being small and compact, and so are viewed as being highly streamlined, perhaps as a result of strong selective pressures for fast replication while establishing germ plasm during early development. This intron is found in the mtDNA of an annelid worm, (an undescribed species of Nephtys), where the complete sequence revealed a 1819 bp group II intron inside the cox1 gene. We infer that this intron is the result of a recent horizontal gene transfer event from a viral or bacterial vector into the mitochondrial genome of Nephtys sp. Our findings hold implications for understanding mechanisms, constraints, and selective pressures that account for patterns of animal mitochondrial genome evolution"
https://openalex.org/W2031748877,"The evolution of avian flight remains one of biology's major controversies, with a long history of functional interpretations of fossil forms given as evidence for either an arboreal or cursorial origin of flight. Despite repeated emphasis on the 'wing-stroke' as a necessary avenue of investigation for addressing the evolution of flight, no empirical data exist on wing-stroke dynamics in an experimental evolutionary context. Here we present the first comparison of wing-stroke kinematics of the primary locomotor modes (descending flight and incline flap-running) that lead to level-flapping flight in juvenile ground birds throughout development. We offer results that are contrary both to popular perception and inferences from other studies. Starting shortly after hatching and continuing through adulthood, ground birds use a wing-stroke confined to a narrow range of less than 20 degrees , when referenced to gravity, that directs aerodynamic forces about 40 degrees above horizontal, permitting a 180 degrees range in the direction of travel. Based on our results, we put forth an ontogenetic-transitional wing hypothesis that posits that the incremental adaptive stages leading to the evolution of avian flight correspond behaviourally and morphologically to transitional stages observed in ontogenetic forms."
https://openalex.org/W2059697575,Using single cell-imaging methods we have found that the volume of adherent cells grown in culture decreases as the cells rounds when it enters mitosis. A minimal volume is reached at metaphase. Rapid volume recovery initiates before abscission as cells make the transition from metaphase to cytokinesis. These volume changes are simultaneous with the rapid surface area decrease and recovery observed in mitotic cells [1].
https://openalex.org/W2141456617,"Caspase 8 is a critical upstream initiator of programmed cell death but, paradoxically, has also been shown to promote cell migration. Here, we show that tyrosine 380 in the linker loop of human caspase 8 is a critical switch determining caspase 8 function. Our studies show that, in addition to its cytosolic distribution, caspase 8 is recruited to lamella of migrating cells. Although the catalytic domain of caspase 8 is sufficient for recruitment and promotion of cell migration, catalytic activity per se is not required. Instead, we find that integrin-mediated adhesion promotes caspase 8 phosphorylation on tyrosine 380. Accordingly, mutation of this site compromises localization to the periphery and the potentiation of cell migration. Mechanistically, this linker region of caspase 8 acts as a Src homology 2 binding site. In particular, tyrosine 380 is critical for interaction with Src homology 2 domains. The results identify a novel mechanism by which caspase 8 is recruited to the lamella of a migrating cell, promoting cell migration independent of its protease activity."
https://openalex.org/W2126656955,"Congenital chloride-losing diarrhea (CLD) is a genetic disorder causing watery stool and dehydration. Mutations in SLC26A3 (solute carrier 26 family member 3), which functions as a coupled Cl-/HCO3- exchanger, cause CLD. SLC26A3 is a membrane protein predicted to contain 12 transmembrane-spanning α-helices and a C-terminal STAS (sulfate transporters and anti-sigma-factor) domain homologous to the bacterial anti-sigma-factor antagonists. The STAS domain is required for SLC26A3 Cl-/HCO3- exchange function and for the activation of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator by SLC26A3. Here we investigate the molecular mechanism(s) by which four CLD-causing mutations (ΔY526/7, I544N, I675/6ins, and G702Tins) in the STAS domain lead to disease. In a heterologous mammalian expression system biochemical, immunohistochemical, and ion transport experiments suggest that the four CLD mutations cause SLC26A3 transporter misfolding and/or mistrafficking. Expression studies with the isolated STAS domain suggest that the I675/6ins and G702Tins mutations disrupt the STAS domain directly, whereas limited proteolysis experiments suggest that the ΔY526/7 and I544N mutations affect a later step in the folding and/or trafficking pathway. The data suggest that these CLD-causing mutations cause disease by at least two distinct molecular mechanisms, both ultimately leading to loss of functional protein at the plasma membrane. Congenital chloride-losing diarrhea (CLD) is a genetic disorder causing watery stool and dehydration. Mutations in SLC26A3 (solute carrier 26 family member 3), which functions as a coupled Cl-/HCO3- exchanger, cause CLD.

In a heterologous mammalian expression system biochemical, immunohistochemical, and ion transport experiments suggest that the four CLD mutations cause SLC26A3 transporter misfolding and/or mistrafficking. Expression studies with the isolated STAS domain suggest that the I675/6ins and G702Tins mutations disrupt the STAS domain directly, whereas limited proteolysis experiments suggest that the ΔY526/7 and I544N mutations affect a later step in the folding and/or trafficking pathway. The data suggest that these CLD-causing mutations cause disease by at least two distinct molecular mechanisms, both ultimately leading to loss of functional protein at the plasma membrane. The SLC26A (solute carrier family 26) is a recently described protein family containing 10 human genes (1Lohi H. Kujala M. Kerkela E. Saarialho-Kere U. Kestila M. Kere J.

In addition, we monitored the effect of the CLD-causing mutations on the isolated STAS domain. These data suggest distinct mechanisms by which the CLD-causing mutations lead to disease. Plasmid Construction—Mammalian expression constructs for full-length human SLC26A3 protein (gi:4557534) were constructed using standard molecular biology techniques and cloned into the BglII and NotI restriction sites of the pCMV-Myc vector (Clontech) resulting in a protein construct with a N-terminal Myc tag. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using PfuTurbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene) to generate the in-frame deletion ΔY526/7, I544N, I675/6ins, and G702Tins mutant constructs. Constructs for mammalian cell expression of human SLC26A3 STAS domain constructs were generated with domain boundaries encompassing residues 509-741 and were cloned into the BglII and NotI sites of the pCMV-Myc vector, whereas nine different human STAS domain constructs for bacterial expression were cloned into the BamHI site of the Smt3-pET28 vector using the combination of three N-terminal domain boundaries (amino acids 503, 510, and 525) and three C-terminal domain boundaries (720, 741, and 764) (55Mossessova E. Lima C.D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 865-876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). All of these constructs were N-terminal fusions with the His6-Smt3 protein and were verified by DNA sequencing. Cl-/HCO3- Exchange Activity—HeLa cells grown on glass coverslips were transfected with the appropriate SLC26A3 plasmid along with a green fluorescent protein expression plasmid. 3 μl of FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) was used per transfection, and the cells were used for Cl-/HCO3- exchange measurements 48 h post-transfection. Green fluorescent protein-positive cells were selected on a fluorescence microscope (Nikon) and incubated with 10 μm 2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein, acetoxymethyl ester (BCECF-AM) (Molecular Probes), and 0.2% Pluronic F-127 (Molecular Probes) for 10 min in HEPES buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 140 mm sodium chloride, 5 mm potassium chloride, 1 mm magnesium chloride, 1 mm calcium chloride, 10 mm glucose, osmolarity 310 mosm). Cells were perfused with HEPES buffer until a steady base line was achieved, and then cells were perfused with HCO3- buffer for 3 min (2.5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 120 mm sodium chloride, 5 mm potassium chloride, 1 mm magnesium chloride, 1mm calcium chloride, 10 mm glucose, 260 mosm, then 25 mm of sodium bicarbonate was added). Subsequently the cells were perfused with Cl--free buffer for 3 min (2.5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 120 mm sodium gluconate, 5 mm potassium gluconate, 1 mm magnesium sulfate, 1 mm cyclamic acid, 10 mm glucose, 260 mosm, then 25 mm sodium bicarbonate was added), followed by a 3-min perfusion with HCO3- buffer. Finally, the cells were perfused with HEPES buffer for 3 min. 5% carbon dioxide gas was bubbled through buffers containing bicarbonate throughout the experiment. The change in the fluorescence excitation ratio of BCECF-AM was monitored at 490 nm/440 nm with the emission at 510 nm. pHi was calibrated using three standard buffers containing 10 mm HEPES, 140 mm potassium chloride, 1mm magnesium chloride, 1 mm calcium chloride, 10 mm glucose, and 5 μm nigericin at pH 6.65, 7.4, and 8.15. Immunofluorescence—HeLa and COS-7 cells were grown on glass coverslips (Fisher) in 35-mm dishes using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% calf serum (Gemini) and supplemented with penicillin and streptomycin at 37 or 30 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% carbon dioxide. HeLa cells were transfected with 1 μg of wild type or mutant SLC26A3 pDNA using FuGENE 6 following the manufacturer's protocol. 48 h post-transfection cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 20 min and subsequently washed twice for 5 min in PBS. Cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature followed by two washes with PBS. The permeabilized cells were incubated for 20 min in blocking solution (1.3% fish skin gelatin and 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS) followed by a 1-h incubation with a 1:100 dilution of rabbit anti-Grp78 (Bip) (StressGen), 1:500 anti-c-Myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and a 1:500 phalloidin conjugated to tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC) (Sigma) in blocking solution. The cells were subsequently washed twice with PBS for 5 min and then incubated with a 1:100 dilution of the anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to cyanine-5.18 (cy5) (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and a 1:500 dilution of anti-mouse antibody conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (Jackson ImmunoResearch) in blocking solution. Cells were washed and mounted using gel mount (Biomedia). Staining cells with the STAS domain antibody required a change of secondary antibody species, but the same protocol was used as described above. A 1:500 dilution of the STAS domain antibody was used along with a 1:100 dilution of mouse anti-Grp78 (BiP) (StressGen). The secondary antibodies were a 1:500 dilution of anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to (fluorescein isothiocyanate) (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and a 1:100 dilution of the anti-mouse antibody conjugated to (cy5) (Jackson ImmunoResearch). All stained cells were visualized and images collected using a Zeiss confocal microscope and Zeiss LSM 510 software version 2.8. Glycosylation Assay—COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% calf serum (Gemini) supplemented with penicillin and streptomycin at 37 or 30 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. 35-mm dishes of COS-7 cells were transfected with 1 μg of wild type or mutant SLC26A3 pDNA using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) following the manufacturer's guidelines. 48 h post-transfection, the cells were washed twice with 0.5 ml of TBS and then lysed in 0.5 ml of RIPA buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 140 mm sodium chloride, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 1% polyoxyethylene(2) isooctylphenyl ether, and protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science)) on ice for 30 min. The lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 5 min, and then 100 μl of lysate was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with 500 units of EndoH (New England Biolabs), 500 units of PNGaseF (New England Biolabs), or no enzyme. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membrane for Western blot analysis. STAS Solubility Assay—To aid in the soluble expression and purification of the human SLC26A3 STAS domain, the yeast small ubiquitin-related modifier homolog Smt3 was fused with the STAS domain N terminus (55Mossessova E. Lima C.D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 865-876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). The wild type or mutant His6-Smt3-SLC26A3 STAS domain plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 Codon Plus RIL cells (Stratagene) and grown at 37 °C in LB (Qbiogene) containing 50 μg/liter kanamycin and 34 μg/liter chloramphenicol to an A600 of 1.0. The cells were induced"

Heparan sulfate proteoglycans have been proposed to be the cell-surface receptors for PEI·DNA complexes (polyplexes). Here, we investigated if syndecan-1 (SDC1) and syndecan-2 (SDC2) are involved in PEI-mediated transfection. Following addition of polyplexes to HEK293 cells, green fluorescent protein-tagged SDCs rapidly formed clusters with PEI that were dependent of lipid raft integrity. However, although SDC1 overexpression slightly enhanced PEI-mediated gene expression, SDC2 dramatically inhibited it. Confocal microscopy analysis showed that SDC1·polyplex endocytosis occurred within minutes after addition of polyplexes, whereas SDC2·polyplex endocytosis took hours. Expression of SDC1 cytoplasmic deletion mutants revealed that the SDC1 cytoplasmic tail is required for gene expression, but not for clustering or endocytosis, whereas overexpression of SDC1/SDC2 chimeras showed that the SDC2 ectodomain is responsible for the inhibitory effect on gene transfer. This study provides evidence that SDCs may have opposing effects on PEI-mediated transfection. Polyethyleneimines (PEIs) are efficient non-viral vectors for gene transfer.

Once added to DNA, PEIs associate with and condense DNA, forming PEI·DNA nanoparticles or complexes (termed polyplexes), protecting the DNA from nuclease degradation. The capacity of polyplexes to mediate gene transfer in mammalian cells was demonstrated for the first time by Boussif et al. (1Boussif O. Lezoualc'h F. Zanta M.A. Mergny M.D. Scherman D. Demeneix B. Behr J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7297-7301Crossref PubMed Scopus (5621) Google Scholar). PEIs are currently attracting great interest in the field of gene therapy because they are relatively simple to synthesize, can be linked to a wide variety of molecules for cellular targeting, and may represent a promising and safe alternative to viral vectors (2Grzelinski M.

In addition, they offer an inexpensive and efficient vehicle for large-scale transfection applications, enabling the rapid production of recombinant proteins and viral vectors (5Pham P.L. Kamen A. Durocher Y. Mol. Biotechnol. 2006; 34: 225-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar).

A key characteristic of PEIs resides in their intrinsic buffering capacity, a feature also known as the proton sponge effect (1Boussif O. Lezoualc'h F. Zanta M.A. Mergny M.D. Scherman D. Demeneix B. Behr J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7297-7301Crossref PubMed Scopus (5621) Google Scholar). According to one hypothesis, the high buffering capacity of PEIs leads to osmotic swelling and rupture of endosomes, resulting in the release of polyplexes into the cytoplasm and passive nuclear entry during mitosis when the nuclear membrane temporarily breaks down (13Grosse S. Thevenot G. Monsigny M. Fajac I. J.

Although it is generally accepted that membrane-associated heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) play an important role in the uptake of polyplexes, their involvement as receptors for PEI·DNA polyplexes remains to be clearly demonstrated. The membrane-associated HSPGs encompass a wide variety of molecules, including betaglycan, also known as TGFR-3 (14Zhang L. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19295-19299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); CD44v3 (15Brown T.A. Bouchard T. St. John T. Wayner E. Carter W.G. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 207-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar); syndecans (SDCs) (16Couchman J.R. Nat. Rev. Mol.

The SDC family is composed of closely related proteins (SDC1–4) encoded by four different genes. These proteins constitute the most abundant forms of membrane HSPGs and play a central role in several aspects of cell physiology (19Bernfield M. Gotte M. Park P.W. Reizes O. Fitzgerald M.L.

Matrix Biol. 1998; 17: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), modulation of growth factor activity (24Tkachenko E. Rhodes J.M. Simons M. Circ. Res. 2005; 96: 488-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), and organization of the microfilament cytoskeleton (25Yoneda A. Couchman J.R. Matrix Biol. 2003; 22: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The extracellular domain of SDCs, which show little primary sequence homology, possesses three to five glycosaminoglycan attachment sites and has a putative protease cleavage site in its extracellular juxtamembrane domain. SDCs have a highly homologous transmembrane domain, which is essential for their homodimerization and oligomerization (26Gao Y. Li M. Chen W. Simons M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 184: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic domain possesses two highly homologous regions (C1 and C2) surrounding a variable region. The C2 region contains a PDZ-binding motif capable of interacting with numerous PDZ domain-containing proteins such as syntenin (27Grootjans J.J. Zimmermann P. Reekmans G. Smets A. Degeest G. Durr J. David G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13683-13688Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), CASK/Lin-2 (28Cohen A.R. Woods D.F. Marfatia S.M. Walther Z. Chishti A.H. Anderson J.M. J.

Physiol. 2000; 184: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Notwithstanding their predominance as cell-surface HSPGs that display a high degree of structural and functional heterogeneity, no study has been undertaken to examine the potential role of syndecans in PEI-mediated transfection. In this study, we address the question of whether SDC1 and SDC2 could act as carriers of PEI·DNA polyplexes. We determined the impact of their overexpression on gene transfer and gene expression efficiency and analyzed their fate following addition of polyplexes. We found that although SDC1 enhances polyplex-mediated transgene expression when overexpressed in HEK293 cells, SDC2 significantly reduces it. The endocytosis, kinetics, and intracellular fate of SDC·polyplex complexes differ significantly between the two SDCs, and this may be related to their transfection competency. Using cytoplasmic domain deletion mutants of SDC1 and SDC1/SDC2 chimeras, we evaluated the role of their various domains in polyplex-mediated endocytosis and transgene expression. Taken together, these results bring a new level of complexity to PEI-mediated transfection mechanisms and provide evidences that SDC1 may act as a receptor for polyplexes. Reagents and Antibodies—The following antibodies were used: anti-syndecan-1 (N-18), anti-syndecan-2 (L-18), and anti-syndecan-3 (D-19) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and anti-syndecan-4 (F94-8G3) (Dr. Guido David, University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium). The following reagents were used: 293fectin™ and Lipofectin® (Invitrogen); Hoechst 33258 and rhodamine B isothiocyanate (RITC) (Sigma); BPEI (Fluka); linear 25-kDa PEI and 16% ultrapure electron microscope grade formaldehyde (Polysciences, Inc.); and restrictions enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, and Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs). Vector Constructions—Full-length SDC1 and SDC2, SDC1 deletion mutants, and SDC1/SDC2 chimeras were amplified and subcloned in the mammalian expression plasmid pTT5 (30Shi C. Shin Y.O. Hanson J. Cass B. Loewen M.C. Durocher Y. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 15705-15714Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) in-frame with green fluorescent protein (GFP) or blue fluorescent protein (BFP) (Qbiogene, Inc.) as indicated in supplemental Table 1. PEI Labeling—BPEI was labeled with RITC by modification of a protocol described previously (31Gautam A. Densmore C.L. Golunski E. Xu B. Waldrep J.C. Mol. Ther. 2001; 3: 551-556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). BPEI (10 mg/ml) was mixed with 2 mg/ml RITC in 0.5 m bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.0) and incubated at room temperature under constant agitation for 2 h. The unbound RITC was removed by applying the reaction mixture to a Sephadex G-25 column (Bio-Rad). Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293-EBNA1 cells (clone 6E) were cultured in FreeStyle™ 293 expression medium supplemented with 0.1% Pluronic® F-68, 50 μg/ml Geneticin (G418), and 10 mm HEPES. For protein expression, 1 × 106 cells were transfected using 293fectin according to the manufacturer's instructions. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, 1 × 106 cells were transfected using PEI·DNA complexes (polyplexes) made as follow. Two micrograms of BPEI (for fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry analysis) or RITC-labeled BPEI (for confocal microscopy analysis) was added to 1 μg of plasmid DNA (pTT5 for fluorescence and confocal microscopy analysis or pTT5-DsRed for flow cytometry analysis); both had been previously diluted in 100 μl of hybridoma serum-free medium (Invitrogen). Solutions were mixed and incubated at room temperature for 15 min before their addition to the cell culture. Flow Cytometry Assay—The percentages of both GFP- and Discosoma sp. red fluorescent protein (DsRed)-expressing cells were determined by flow cytometry using an EPICS Profile II (Beckman Coulter) equipped with a 15-milliwatt argon ion laser. Viable transfected cells were quantified by using appropriate gating to exclude dead cells, debris, and aggregates in a forward-scatter-against-side-scatter plot. Colocalization Experiments and Microscopy—Colocalization of fluorescent proteins and BPEI-RITC was performed using a confocal microscope. Cells were plated for 1 h onto poly-d-lysine-coated glass-bottom 35-mm culture dishes (No. 0, Mat-Tek Corp.). After washing cells with fresh medium, plated cells were transfected with BPEI-RITC for the indicated periods of time. Cells were then fixed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 4% formaldehyde for 10 min. After washing the cells twice with phosphate-buffered saline, nuclei were stained with 2 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 for 10 min. Fluorescent images were analyzed either on a confocal microscope (Zeiss Axiovert 200M inverted microscope) using a Plan-Apochromat 63× (numerical aperture 1.4, differential interference contrast) objective or on a conventional inverted fluorescence microscope (Leica DMIL) using c-Plan 40× (numerical aperture 0.5) objective. The confocal microscope was equipped with three lasers. A laser diode (excitation, 405 nm) and a band-pass filter (420–480 nm) were used to capture the signal recorded as blue; an argon laser (excitation, 488 nm) and a band-pass filter (505–530 nm) were used to capture the signal recorded as green; and finally, a helium/neon laser (excitation, 543 nm) and a band-pass filter (550–625 nm) were used to capture the signal recorded as red. Zeiss LSM 510 META confocal system version 3.2 software and IrfanView version 3.85 were used for image acquisition by confocal microscopy and conventional microscopy, respectively. Polyplexes Induce Clustering of SDC1 and SDC2 and Require Lipid Raft Integrity—Previous reports suggest that HEK293 cells express low or undetectable levels of SDC1, SDC2, or SDC4 (32Endo K.

Accordingly, we were not able to detect SDCs by Western blotting using specific anti-SDC1–4 antibodies. However, we were able to show the presence of SDC2, SDC3, and SDC4 (but not SDC1) mRNAs by reverse transcription-PCR (data not shown). To investigate the impact of SDC1 and SDC2 overexpression on PEI-mediated gene expression and to be able to follow their fates following polyplex addition, we tagged the C-terminal end of both proteins with GFP. The GFP-tagged truncated form of CD4 (ΔCD4), which lacks the helix in the cytoplasmic domain, preventing its internalization by Nef (35Piguet V. Chen Y.L. Mangasarian A. Foti M. Carpentier J.L. Trono D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2472-2481Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), was used as a non-HSPG control transmembrane protein. Cells were transiently transfected with each construct using the lipid-based 293fectin reagent. Twenty-four hours post-transfection (hpt), the percentage of GFP-positive cells was determined by flow cytometry. For the whole study, the average transfection efficiency using this method was 77 ± 10% (n = 37). Confocal microscopy revealed that all GFP-tagged proteins were localized mainly to the cell membrane (supplemental Fig. S1), indicating that the GFP tag does not perturb folding or targeting of these proteins. It was reported previously that SDC4 clustering is induced in the presence of basic fibroblast growth factor-2 (36Tkachenko E. Simons M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19946-19951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been shown that polyarginine induces clustering of SDC1 (37Dull R.O. Dinavahi R. Schwartz L. Humphries D.E. Berry D. Sasisekharan R. Garcia J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: L986-L995PubMed Google Scholar) and that clustering of SDC2 is crucial for spine formation in neurons (38Ethell I.M. Irie F. Kalo M.S. Couchman J.R. Pasquale E.B. Yamaguchi Y. Neuron. 2001; 31: 1001-1013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), underlying the important role of syndecan clustering for some biological activities. To determine whether PEI can induce SDC1 and SDC2 clustering, polyplexes were added to GFP-tagged SDC1- or SDC2-expressing cells, and SDCs were followed by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1). Within 10 min of polyplex addition, formation of GFP clusters could be easily monitored for both SDCs, but not for ΔCD4-GFP. Clustering is indeed very rapid, as it was detectable within 1 min after polyplex addition to cells. 3S. Paris, A. Burlacu, and Y. Durocher, unpublished data. Interestingly, most of the cell surface-expressed SDCs were found concentrated in these clusters, indicating that recruitment of SDC1 and SDC2 proteins by polyplexes is very efficient. Clustering of SDC1 and SDC2 was also observed following addition of DNA-free BPEI3 and linear 25-kDa PEI as well as after addition of polyplexes made with cross-linked PEIs (supplemental Fig. S2) (39Thomas M. Ge Q. Lu J.J. Chen J. Klibanov A.M. Pharm. Res. (N. Y.). 2005; 22: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). In contrast, no clustering could be detected after addition of the cationic liposomes 293fectin and Lipofectin (supplemental Fig. S2). It was reported previously that clustering and subsequent endocytosis of SDC1 and SDC4 require the integrity of plasma membrane lipid rafts (40Fuki I.V. Meyer M.E. Williams K.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 607-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 41Tkachenko E. Lutgens E. Stan R.V. Simons M. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 3189-3199Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To determine whether lipid raft integrity is also required for polyplex-induced clustering of these receptors, SDC1- and SDC2-expressing cells were treated for 1 h with 10 μm methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD), a cyclic oligosaccharide known to deplete cholesterol from the plasma membrane and to disrupt lipid raft integrity. Polyplexes were added to cells, and SDC1 and SDC2 clustering was followed by fluorescence microscopy. After 10 min (Fig. 1) and even after longer periods (1 and 3 h),3 clustering of SDC1 and SDC2 was completely inhibited by MβCD. Gene Expression Is Enhanced by SDC1 but Inhibited by SDC2—To determine the impact of SDC1 and SDC2 overexpression on PEI-mediated transgene expression, cells expressing SDC1, SDC2, or ΔCD4 were transfected with polyplexes containing a DsRed-expressing vector. At 24 hpt, the percentages of double-fluorescent cells (green for SDC and ΔCD4 expression and red for DsRed expression) were determined by flow cytometry and expressed relative to ΔCD4 (control), taken as 100%. PEI-mediated transfection of SDC1-expressing cells resulted in an average increase of 12 ± 4% (n = 4) in double-labeled cells compared with control cells. Surprisingly, transfection efficiencies in SDC2-expressing cells were strongly decreased by 80 ± 3% (n = 4) compared with the ΔCD4 control. SDC1 but Not SDC2 Rapidly Internalizes Polyplexes—To address this striking difference between SDC1 and SDC2, we examined the fate of polyplexes by confocal microscopy using RITC-labeled PEI (Fig. 2). In good agreement with the above results, SDC1 and SDC2 clustering could be easily monitored at the cell surface 10 min after polyplex addition (Fig. 2, a and b). In addition, these clusters colocalized with polyplexes, in accordance with the expected capacity of SDC1 and SDC2 to take up PEI·DNA complexes. At 1 hpt, most SDC1 clusters were endocytosed along with polyplexes, both appearing concentrated in an area close to the nucleus (Fig. 2a and the supplemental video). In contrast, SDC2 clusters were still located at the cell surface in tight association with polyplexes (Fig. 2b). At 6 hpt, several large patches of endocytosed polyplexes were found free of SDC1 clusters (Fig. 2a). The endocytosed polyplexes appeared to be concentrated in large particles as a result of the putative fusion of smaller ones. In stark contrast, only a few polyplexes were found endocytosed at 6 hpt in SDC2-expressing cells (Fig. 2b), and these were still associated with this receptor. In both cases, polyplexes completely free of SDCs could be found in the cell cytoplasm at 24 hpt (Fig. 2, a and b). In agreement with a recent report showing that entry of polyplexes into the nucleus occurs during mitosis when the nuclear membrane is temporarily disrupted (13Grosse S. Thevenot G. Monsigny M. Fajac I. J. Gene Med. 2006; 8: 845-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), some polyplexes were also found close to the chromatin in early post-mitotic cells (supplemental Fig. S3a), whereas some cells displayed polyplexes in their nuclei after mitosis (supplemental Fig. S3b). The Cytoplasmic Tail of SDC1 Is Not Required for Polyplex Endocytosis but Is Necessary for Gene Expression—Because gene expression was not prevented but was slightly enhanced by overexpression of SDC1, we next wanted to evaluate the importance of its various domains with regard to PEI-mediated transfection. We therefore generated a series of C-terminally GFP-tagged truncated forms of SDC1 (Fig. 3) termed SDC1ΔC2 (without the C2 domain), SDC1ΔVC2 (without the variable and C2 domains), SDC1ΔCyto (without the cytoplasmic tail), and eSDC1 (the SDC1 ectodomain fused to the CD4 transmembrane domain), which were transfected in HEK293 cells. After 24 h, confocal microscopy analysis revealed that all constructs were localized at the cell membrane, indicating that these deletions did not affect plasma membrane targeting.3 Cells expressing each construct were then transfected with polyplexes containing the pTT-DsRed vector, and the percentage of cells expressing both fluorescent proteins was determined by flow cytometry 24 hpt. The results are shown in Fig. 3a and are expressed relative to full-length SDC1-transfected cells, taken as 100%. In SDC1ΔC2-expressing cells, the percentage of DsRed-expressing cells dramatically dropped to a level similar to that obtained with SDC2 (∼20%), indicating that the C2 domain is crucial for PEI-mediated transfection. A similar drop in DsRed-expressing cells was obtained for SDC1ΔVC2, SDC1ΔCyto, and eSDC1 (Fig. 3a). Confocal microscopy analysis showed that, as observed previously, 10 min after adding polyplexes to wild-type SDC1-expressing cells, PEI rapidly induced formation of clusters with all truncated forms of SDC1 except for eSDC1.3 Interestingly, at 6 hpt (Fig. 3b), all constructs but eSDC1 were endocytosed and colocalized with polyplexes. In contrast to SDC2, these observations indicate that the inhibitory effect of these constructs on cell transfection could not be due to delayed polyplex endocytosis, but suggest that the intracellular targeting of polyplexes was affected. These results also demonstrate that the C2 domain of SDC1 is critical for its gene delivery capacity. The SDC2 Ectodomain, but Not Its Cytoplasmic Domain, Inhibits Gene Transfer—We next wanted to determine the role of the SDC1 and SDC2 ectodomains during PEI-mediated gene delivery. To address this issue, we constructed two chimeras termed eSDC1tcSDC2 and eSDC2tcSDC1 by exchanging the ectodomains of SDC1 and SDC2. Cells expressing the chimeras were transfected with polyplexes containing the pTT-DsRed expression vector to evaluate their effect on transfection efficiencies as monitored by flow cytometry (Fig. 4a). The results show that replacement of the SDC2 ectodomain with the SDC1 ectodomain (eSDC1tcSDC2) restored transfection. In contrast, replacement of the SDC1 ectodomain with the SDC2 ectodomain (eSDC2tcSDC1) inhibited cell transfection to the same level as did wild-type SDC2, suggesting that the SDC2 ectodomain is responsible for the observed negative effect on cell transfection. Confocal microscopy analysis was performed with chimera-expressing cells following polyplex addition. As observed previously for SDC1 and SDC2, clusters of both chimeras colocalizing with RITC-labeled polyplexes could be observed 10 min following polyplex addition.3 Interestingly and in stark contrast to observations obtained wild-type SDC2, endocytosis of both chimera·polyplex complexes could be observed at 6 hpt (Fig. 4b). However, although endocytosed polyplexes were almost completely dissociated from eSDC1tcSDC2, as already observed for wild-type SDC1, they remained fully associated with eSDC2tcSDC1 (as for wild-type SDC2) (see Fig. 2b, 6 h panel). This suggests that the ectodomain of SDC2 is responsible for the negative effect on polyplex endocytosis and gene expression. SDC2 Exerts a Dominant-negative Effect on Transfection—As both SDC1 and SDC2 have the capacity to bind polyplexes and form clusters but dramatically differ in terms of polyplex-induced endocytosis and transfection efficiency, we next examined the impact of their coexpression on these parameters. Cells coexpressing SDC1 and SDC2 were transfected with polyplexes containing the pTT-DsRed plasmid. At 24 hpt, the percentage of double-labeled cells (green for SDC expression and red for DsRed expression) was determined by flow cytometry. The results are expressed relative to the SDC1 control, set as 100%, where 50% of the coding plasmid was replaced with empty pTT5 vector to maintain the DNA/PEI ratio of 1/2. Coexpression of SDC2 with SDC1 resulted in an ∼60% reduction in transfection efficiency compared with expression of SDC1 alone, indicating that SDC2 has a negative effect on SDC1-mediated PEI transfection (Fig. 5a). As PEI-mediated transfection in SDC2-expressing cells was probably prevented as a direct or indirect result of a slowed polyplex endocytosis, confocal microscopy analysis was performed after addition of RITC-labeled polyplexes (Fig. 5b). To be able to distinguish between SDC1 and SDC2, GFP fused at the C-terminal end of the full-length SDC2 protein was replaced with BFP. At 10 min post-transfection, GFP-tagged SDC1, BFP-tagged SDC2, and RITC-labeled polyplexes all colocalized in clusters at the plasma membrane.3 Interestingly, SDC1·SDC2·polyplex complexes were hardly detected within cells at 6 hpt, as they remained mainly at the cell surface, as observed previously when SDC2 was expressed alone. This result dramatically contrasts with the profile obtained when SDC1 was expressed alone (Fig. 2a), suggesting that SDC2 has a dominant-negative effect on SDC1-mediated polyplex endocytosis and gene transfer to the nucleus. To achieve high levels of recombinant protein expression, the ideal non-viral gene delivery vehicle should possess the following properties: proficient binding to and penetration of target cells, capacity to bypass or escape the endocytotic pathways, efficient routing to the nucleus, and capacity to dissociate from plasmid DNA once in the nucleus. Compared with viruses, which have evolved to enable efficient infection, PEIs display a relatively weak gene transfer capability.

https://openalex.org/W2103295587,"Changing gain in a neuronal system has important functional consequences, but the underlying mechanisms have been elusive. Models have suggested a variety of neuronal and systems properties to accomplish gain control. Here, we show that the gain of the neuronal network underlying local bending behavior in leeches depends on widespread inhibition. Using behavioral analysis, intracellular recordings, and voltage-sensitive dye imaging, we compared the effects of blocking just the known lateral inhibition with blocking all GABAergic inhibition. This revealed an additional source of inhibition, which was widespread and increased in proportion to increasing stimulus intensity. In a model of the input/output functions of the three-layered local bending network, we showed that inhibiting all interneurons in proportion to the stimulus strength produces the experimentally observed change in gain. This relatively simple mechanism for controlling behavioral gain could be prevalent in vertebrate as well as invertebrate nervous systems."

It has been reported that disruptions of the circadian clockwork are associated with and may predispose to metabolic syndrome. Methodology and Principal Findings 8028 individuals attended a nationwide health examination survey in Finland. Data were collected with a face-to-face interview at home and during an individual health status examination. The waist circumference, height, weight and blood pressure were measured and samples were taken for laboratory tests. Participants were assessed using the ATP-III criteria for metabolic syndrome and with the Seasonal Pattern Assessment Questionnaire for their seasonal changes in mood and behavior. Seasonal changes in weight in particular were a risk factor of metabolic syndrome, after controlling for a number of known risk and potential confounding factors. Conclusions and Significance Metabolic syndrome is associated with high global scores on the seasonal changes in mood and behavior, and with those in weight in particular. Assessment of these changes may serve as a useful indicator of metabolic syndrome, because of easy assessment. Abnormalities in the circadian clockwork which links seasonal fluctuations to metabolic cycles may predispose to seasonal changes in weight and to metabolic syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2155712907,"A deficiency of serotonergic signaling is thought to be involved in the etiology of depression. Thus, drugs blocking the reuptake of serotonin back into the neurons are widely used in treatment of this disease; however, their delayed effect in remission of patients suggests that the clinical response does not rely on simple serotonin uptake inhibition but may include further regulatory mechanisms. We have analyzed cellular serotonin transporter (SERT) expression on exposure to the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor citalopram in serotonergic neurons expressing the native SERT allele in its natural surroundings. Biotinylation of SERT-expressing HEK293 cells, as well as confocal microscopy analysis in these cells and in serotonergic neurons, revealed that exposure to citalopram time dependently reduces the amount of cell surface-expressed SERT. Furthermore, in serotonergic neurons, longer exposure to citalopram not only caused an internalization of SERT proteins from the cell surface but also induced a redistribution of SERT from neurite extensions into the soma. This process was reversible on drug removal. Microarray analysis performed on citalopram-treated serotonergic neurons revealed that antidepressant treatment does not alter SERT mRNA expression, suggesting that SERT trafficking from and to the cell membrane is regulated on the posttranscriptional level."
https://openalex.org/W1985221423,"The insulin-responsive glucose transporter, GLUT4, is regulated in various physiologic states at the transcriptional level. When expressed in transgenic mice, the human GLUT4 promoter is governed by two cis-acting sequences: an MEF2 binding domain and Domain I, that function both as positive and negative regulators depending on the physiologic state. MEF2 proteins and GLUT4 enhancer factor (GEF) are known ligands for these cis-acting elements, but their mechanism of action is unclear. To begin to understand this important process, we have characterized GEF structural domains and its interactions with the MEF2A isoform. We find that the C terminus of GEF comprises its DNA-binding domain, but does not contribute to GEF homo-oligomerization. We also have found that GEF dimerizes with increased affinity to a hypophosphorylated form of MEF2A. Furthermore, we demonstrated that MEF2A binding to its cognate binding site can increase the DNA binding activity of GEF to Domain I, suggesting a novel mechanism for MEF2A transcriptional activation. Finally, we have demonstrated that the transcriptional co-repressor HDAC5 can interact with GEF in the absence of MEF2 proteins and specifically inhibit GLUT4 promoter activity. These findings lead to the hypothesis that GEF and the MEF2 proteins form a complex on the GLUT4 promoter that allows for recruitment of transcriptional co-regulators (repressors and/or activators) to control GLUT4 promoter activity."
https://openalex.org/W1998238281,"Interleukin-6 (IL-6) via its signal transducer gp130 is an important mediator of liver regeneration involved in protecting from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced liver injury after partial hepatectomy (PH). Here we generated mice either defective (Δ) in hepatocyte-specific gp130-dependent Ras or STAT activation to define their role during liver regeneration. Deletion of gp130-dependent signaling had major impact on acute phase gene (APG) regulation after PH. APG expression was blocked in gp130-ΔSTAT animals, whereas gp130-ΔRas mice showed an enhanced APG response and stronger SOCS3 regulation correlating with delayed hepatocyte proliferation. To define the role of SOCS3 during hepatocyte proliferation, primary hepatocytes were co-stimulated with IL-6 and hepatocyte growth factor. Higher SOCS3 expression in gp130-ΔRas hepatocytes correlated with delayed hepatocyte proliferation. Next, we tested the impact of LPS, mimicking bacterial infection, on liver regeneration. LPS and PH induced SOCS3 and APG in all animal strains and delayed cell cycle progression. Additionally, IL-6/gp130-dependent STAT3 activation in hepatocytes was essential in mediating protection and thus required for maximal proliferation. Unexpectedly, oncostatin M was most strongly induced in gp130-ΔSTAT animals after PH/LPS-induced stress and was associated with hepatocyte proliferation in this strain.

The liver has the unique capacity to compensate tissue loss after injury through hyperplasia of remaining hepatocytes while keeping its organ-specific functions (1Fausto N. Laird A.D. Webber E.M.

Liver mass is controlled in an intriguingly exact way, which becomes essential in situations where transplanted livers that are too small for matching the body weight of the recipient have to grow until they reach their optimal size, whereas transplants that are too big in size shrink to their optimal volume (3Deshpande R.R.

In this model it has been a major challenge to evaluate the extra- and intracellular events that orchestrate this highly complex process. To undergo distinct stages including priming, cell cycle progression, and cessation of regeneration, fully differentiated hepatocytes are forced to leave their quiescent state (6Darnell Jr., J.E.

Growth factors and cytokines have been shown to play important roles in regulating this process. In the priming phase of hepatocytes, roles for cytokines like tumor necrosis factor α and IL-6 have been reported (8Cressman D.E. Greenbaum L.E. DeAngelis R.A. Ciliberto G. Furth E.E. Poli V. Taub R.

First, it was suggested that both are directly involved in mediating cell cycle progression. However, in recent years, especially for IL-6, it has been demonstrated that this cytokine does not directly control hepatocyte proliferation after PH but activates signaling pathways that are protective for the progression of regeneration (13Wuestefeld T. Klein C. Streetz K.L. Betz U. Lauber J. Buer J. Manns M.P. Muller W. Trautwein C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11281-11288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). For signal transduction IL-6 first binds to the IL-6 receptor gp80. As a result these proteins build a complex with two gp130 signal transducers, which in turn results in the intracellular dimerization of these glycoproteins (14Taga T. Kishimoto T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 797-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar). This event triggers activation of Janus kinases in the cell, which phosphorylated distinct intracellular tyrosines of the gp130 receptor. They serve as docking sites and activate the downstream pathways. In the gp130 molecule six tyrosine residues have been defined (15Hirano T. Int. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 249-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the four distal tyrosines is involved in mediating nuclear translocation of STAT3 and STAT1, whereas phosphorylation of the second most membrane-proximal tyrosine is linked to the Ras/Erk pathway as well as to negative regulation of gp130 signaling (16Fukada T. Hibi M. Yamanaka Y. Takahashi-Tezuka M. Fujitani Y. Yamaguchi T. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Immunity. 1996; 5: 449-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar, 17Gerhartz C.

In an earlier study we used conditional gp130 knock-out (LoxP/Cre system) mice to better characterize the role of IL-6-dependent signaling during liver regeneration. In these mice gp130 was deleted using a transgene for Cre, where its expression is controlled via the Mx promoter (MxCre gp130LoxP/LoxP) (13Wuestefeld T. Klein C. Streetz K.L. Betz U. Lauber J.

Therefore, this approach had the advantage of deleting gp130 on demand but was active in all cells that are sensitive to interferon. The MxCre gp130LoxP/LoxP mice had a severe phenotype after PH, when they were co-stimulated with LPS. A high percentage, in contrast to controls, of the animals died and showed impaired hepatocyte proliferation. These results stressed two important questions: whether this phenotype is related to deletion of gp130 in hepatocytes and which of the two pathways, Ras/Erk and/or STAT, is involved in mediating protection during liver regeneration. Therefore, in the present study we used hepatocyte-specific gp130 knock-out (AlfpCre gp130LoxP/LoxP) mice and combined these animals with gp130 knock-in mice, deficient for either hepatocyte-specific gp130-dependent Ras/Erk (AlfpCre gp130Y757F/LoxP) or STAT (AlfpCre gp130ΔSTAT/LoxP) activation. This strategy allowed us to specifically address the role of IL-6/gp130-Ras- or IL-6/gp130-STAT-dependent signaling in hepatocytes and to investigate their relevance during different pathophysiological conditions. We thus used these animal strains to further characterize the relevance of gp130-dependent signaling during liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy. Generation and Genotyping of gp130-mutated Animals—Hepatocyte-specific AlfpCre gp130LoxP/LoxP; mice were generated by breeding AlfpCre mice with mice expressing LoxP-flanked gp130 alleles.

Hepatocyte-specific AlfpCre gp130ΔSTAT/LoxP; gp130ΔSTAT/LoxP animals were generated by breeding AlfpCre gp130LoxP/LoxP with gp130ΔSTAT/ΔSTAT knock-in mice. Gp130 ΔSTAT/ΔSTAT mice express a truncated gp130 knock-in allele that lacks the essential regions encoding the carboxyl-terminal end of gp130 required for activation of STAT1 and -3 signaling (18Ernst M.

All of the animals received human care, and the experiments were performed following National Academy of Sciences (National Institutes of Health publication 86-23, revised 1985) criteria. The genotypes were analyzed by PCR analysis for AlfpCre, gp130LoxP, gp130Y757F, and the gp130ΔSTAT allele as described previously (19Klein C. Wustefeld T. Assmus U. Roskams T. Rose-John S. Muller M.

Two-thirds Hepatectomy and LPS Stimulation—Pathogen-free 8–10-week-old male mice were used for PH and additional LPS injury experiments providing the different hepatocyte-specific defects in IL-6-gp130 signaling. PH and sham surgeries were performed under ketamin/xylazine anesthesia as described earlier (13Wuestefeld T. Klein C. Streetz K.L. Betz U. Lauber J. Buer J. Manns M.P. Muller W. Trautwein C. J. Biol.

The mice were exposed to additional injury induced by intraperitoneal application of LPS (4 mg/kg) (Escherichia coli O55:B5; Sigma) injected 3 h after surgery. The mice subjected to LPS challenge in the absence of PH received 4 mg/kg of LPS. Control animals were treated with equal volumes of carrier solution (NaCl). Each time point provides at least five mice/genotype. The remaining livers were removed, rinsed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and individually frozen in liquid nitrogen and Tissue Tek (Sakura Europe, Zoeterwoude, The Netherlands). Isolation of Primary Hepatocytes—Primary mouse hepatocytes were isolated and cultured as described earlier (20Pietrangelo A. Dierssen U. Valli L. Garuti C. Rump A. Corradini E. Ernst M. Klein C.

Stimulation was performed with 50 ng/ml recombinant oncostatin M (OSM), 200 ng/ml recombinant IL-6, and 50 ng/ml recombinant HGF. For quantification of DNA synthesis [3H]thymidine was added 6 h before harvest at the indicated time points, and whole cell proteins and RNA were isolated. SDS-PAGE and Western—Frozen liver tissues were lysed in cold lysis buffer as described earlier (21Beraza N. Marques J.M. Martinez-Anso E. Iniguez M. Prieto J. Bustos M. Hepatology. 2005; 41: 460-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and heat-denaturated in double-strength sodium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer containing dithiothreitol. After resolution in 10% SDS-PAGE, equal protein loading was confirmed by Ponceau Red staining. For primary antibody incubation, the membranes were probed with anti-P-STAT3 (Tyr705; 9131s; Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), anti-cyclin A (clone C19; sc-596; Santa Cruz), anti-phospho-p44/42 (Erk1/2) mitogen-activated protein kinase (Thr202/Tyr204; #9106s; Cell Signaling), and anti-GAPDH (Biogenesis 4699-9555) antibodies. As a secondary antibody, horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (#7074; Cell Signaling) and horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (sc-2005) were used. The antigen-antibody complexes were visualized using the ECL Chemiluminescence Kit (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK). BrdUrd Labeling and Staining—For in vivo pulse labeling of cells in S phase, 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) was injected intraperitoneally (300 μg/20 g mouse) 2 h before the animals were sacrificed. Cryosections were stained according to the cell proliferation kit manual (RPN20; GE Healthcare). BrdUrd-negative cells were counterstained with hematoxilin. For evaluation of the average percentage of BrdUrd-positive hepatocytes per liver sample, four fields (magnification, ×200) were analyzed by counting the total number of nuclei. At least five mice were analyzed per time point. Quantitative Real Time PCR—Total RNA from frozen liver was isolated and treated with DNaseI (Invitrogen) before cDNA synthesis as described earlier (20Pietrangelo A. Dierssen U. Valli L. Garuti C. Rump A. Corradini E. Ernst M. Klein C. Trautwein C. Gastroenterology. 2007; 132: 294-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Real time PCR was performed by using a Real Time PCR System 7300 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and SYBRGreenER qPCR Super Mix (Invitrogen). The primers were as follows: SOCS3, forward, 5′-CCC GCG GGC ACC TTT CTT AT-3′, and reverse, 5′-CAC TGG ATG CGT AGG TTC TTG GTC-3′; SAA primers, forward, 5′-TCT CTG GGG CAA CAT AGT ATA CCT CTC AT-3′, and reverse, 5′-TTT ATT ACC CTC TCC TCC TCA AGC AGT TAC-3′; cyclin E1, forward, 5′-ACA GCA GGT CTT CGT GCA GAT C-3′, and reverse, 5′-CTG AAG CAG CCA CAT CCA G-3′; OSM, forward, 5′-CTG ACC TGA GAG CTG CCT G-3′, and reverse 5′-CAG GAA GTG AGG CTT GCT CAG-3′; and GAPDH, forward, 5′-CAA TGT GTC CGT CGT GGA TCT-3′, and reverse, 5′-GTC CTC AGT GTA GCC CAA GAT G-3′. The expression levels were normalized with the levels of GAPDH. The specificity of PCR products was confirmed by melting curves and electrophoresis. H1 Histone Kinase Assay—The activity of Cdk2 was measured by the histone H1 kinase assay. Liver protein extract (500 μg) was immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C with antibodies to Cdk2 (M2; sc-163; Santa Cruz). 40 μl of protein A-agarose beads (Roche Applied Science) were added to each immunoprecipitation and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Histone H1 (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), ATP (Sigma), and [32P]dATP (GE Healthcare) were added for 30 min of incubation at 37 °C. The reactions were stopped by adding 6 μl of 10× SDS loading buffer and heated for 5 min at 95 °C. For analysis of the supernatant proteins the protein A immunobeads were pelleted by centrifugation. Visualization by autoradiography was performed after resolving the reaction mixtures using 10% SDS-PAGE (22Luedde T. Wuestefeld T. Trautwein C. Hepatology. 2001; 34: 1254-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Alterations in Acute Phase Gene Regulation in Genetically Modified gp130 Mice after PH—IL-6 is an important mediator of liver regeneration (8Cressman D.E. Greenbaum L.E. DeAngelis R.A. Ciliberto G. Furth E.E. Poli V. Taub R. Science. 1996; 274: 1379-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar). IL-6 via gp130 triggers pathways that are important in mediating protection after PH but has a minor role in directly mediating hepatocyte proliferation (13Wuestefeld T. Klein C. Streetz K.L. Betz U. Lauber J. Buer J. Manns M.P. Muller W. Trautwein C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11281-11288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In our present study we further dissected the role of gp130-dependent pathways specifically in hepatocytes to understand their relevance during liver regeneration after PH. We used hepatocyte-specific gp130 genetically modified mice that have a complete deletion of gp130 in hepatocytes (AlfpCre gp130LoxP/LoxP) or can selectively only activate the gp130-STAT (AlfpCre gp130Y757F/LoxP) or gp130-Ras (AlfpCre gp130ΔSTAT/LoxP) pathway in hepatocytes (19Klein C. Wustefeld T. Assmus U. Roskams T. Rose-John S. Muller M. Manns M.P. Ernst M. Trautwein C. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 860-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Additionally, gp130 LoxP/LoxP mice were used. These animals express no Cre recombinase but only carry LoxP sites in the gp130 locus and thus were used as wild type (wt) control animals. First, we studied the regulation of gp130-dependent pathways in these four animal strains following PH. Analysis of the major liver-derived acute phase protein, serum amyloid A (SAA) showed a more than 150-fold induction on the RNA level in wt mice 24 h after PH. This regulation was completely blocked in AlfpCre gp130LoxP/LoxP and AlfpCre gp130ΔSTAT/LoxP strains. In contrast, compared with wt mice a significant 2.5-fold stronger induction (p = 0.043) of SAA levels was found in AlfpCre gp130Y757F/LoxP animals after PH (Fig. 1A). SOCS3 is as a negative regulator of STAT3-dependent signaling and has an important role during liver regeneration (23Croker B.A. Metcalf D. Robb L. Wei W. Mifsud S. DiRago L. Cluse L.A. Sutherland K.D. Hartley L. Williams E. Zhang J.G. Hilton D.J. Nicola N.A. Alexander W.S. Roberts A.W.

Commun. 2005; 338: 1943-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). 6 h after PH SOCS3 was induced 13-fold in wt animals and 50-fold in AlfpCre gp130Y757F/LoxP mice (p = 0.001 compared with wt), whereas this response was completely blunted in AlfpCre gp130LoxP/LoxP animals (Fig. 1B). SAA and SOCS3 are STAT3 target genes and its phosphorylation (P) was studied. P-STAT3 was found in wt mice 6 h after PH, and this signal was significantly enhanced in AlfpCre gp130Y757F/LoxP. Additionally, no P-STAT3 was found in AlfpCre gp130LoxP/LoxP and AlfpCre gp130ΔSTAT/LoxP mice (Fig. 1C). Impact of Hepatocyte-specific Modulation of gp130-dependent Pathways on Hepatocyte Proliferation—In further experiments the impact of these changes on cell cycle progression was quantified by BrdUrd pulse labeling experiments. A maximum in DNA synthesis was found in wt animals 40 h after PH and decreased at later time points. A similar kinetic was detected in AlfpCre gp130LoxP/LoxP and AlfpCre gp130ΔSTAT/LoxP strains. In contrast to all other strains, AlfpCre gp130Y757F/LoxP mice showed a different kinetic. Significantly less BrdUrd-positive hepatocytes were found 40 h after PH, and the maximum of DNA synthesis was evident 48 h after PH (Fig. 2, A and B). To better define S phase progression, we studied activation of Erk1/2 triggered by growth factors like HGF and epidermal growth factor. Maximal Erk1/2 activity was found between 24 and 40 h after PH in wt, AlfpCre gp130LoxP/LoxP, and AlfpCre gp130ΔSTAT/LoxP mice, whereas the maximum in Erk1/2 activation was evident 72 h after PH in AlfpCre gp130Y757F/LoxP animals (Fig. 2C). G1/S Phase Progression Is Delayed in AlfpCre gp130Y757F/LoxP Mice—DNA synthesis was delayed in AlfpCre gp130Y757F/LoxP animals (Fig. 2B). We thus studied hepatocyte proliferation in more detail. All of the gp130-modified mouse strains showed a peak in cyclin E1 expression 40 h after PH. Unexpectedly, cyclin E1 mRNA expression was significantly higher in AlfpCre gp130Y757F/LoxP mice compared with the other three mouse strains studied (Fig. 3A). Western blot analysis evidenced cyclin A expression in wt mice between 40 and 72 h after PH. In AlfpCre gp130LoxP/LoxP and AlfpCre gp130ΔSTAT/LoxP mice a maximum of cyclin A expression was detected after 40h. In contrast, AlfpCre gp130LoxP/LoxP animals showed a significantly lower cyclin A expression compared with AlfpCre gp130ΔSTAT/LoxP animals where low levels of cyclin A were detected up to 72 h. In contrast, AlfpCre gp130Y757F/LoxP animals showed delayed cyclin A expression with maximal levels at 48 h after PH (Fig. 3B). BrdUrd analysis and cyclin A expression levels suggested delayed G1/S phase progression in AlfpCre gp130Y757F/LoxP animals. We now tested Cdk2 activity (25Pines J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1995; 66: 181-212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Peak of Cdk2 activity after 40 h was found in all animal strains except in AlfpCre gp130Y757F/LoxP mice (Fig. 3C) where maximal Cdk2 activity was observed only 48 h after PH. AlfpCre gp130ΔSTAT/LoxP mice had the highest Cdk2 activity at the different time points investigated. Thus AlfpCre gp130Y757F/LoxP animals, compared with the other strains investigated, showed a stronger acute phase response and induction of SOCS3 associated with hyperactivation of STAT3 that correlated with a delay in G1/S phase progression after PH. Delayed Proliferation in Primary AlfpCre gp130Y757F/LoxP-derived Hepatocytes Correlates with Higher SOCS3 Expression Induced by Hyperactivation of STAT3—The PH experiments in AlfpCre gp130Y757F/LoxP mice suggested that the delay in hepatocyte proliferation correlated with higher SOCS3 expression. To further test this hypothesis, we performed in vitro studies with primary hepatocytes from wt or AlfpCre gp130Y757F/LoxP mice. After isolation, the cells were stimulated with either HGF alone or in combination with IL-6. Proliferation was monitored by [3H]thymidine incorporation. In wt mice 6 h of HGF treatment resulted in a significant 25% increase in DNA synthesis (p > 0.02), and co-stimulation with IL-6 was also associated with higher proliferation (Fig. 4A). In contrast, in AlfpCre gp130Y757F/LoxP mice HGF had no major impact on hepatocyte proliferation, whereas IL-6/HGF co-stimulation inhibited DNA synthesis 6 h after treatment (p > 0.01). However, 12 h after IL-6/HGF stimulation, hepatocyte proliferation in AlfpCre gp130Y757F/LoxP-derived hepatocytes was higher compared with all of the other conditions (Fig. 4A). HGF stimulation alone did not increase P-STAT3 expression in wt or AlfpCre gp130Y757F/LoxP hepatocytes. However, HGF/IL-6 treatment significantly stimulated STAT3 phosphorylation in AlfpCre gp130Y757F/LoxP but clearly less in wt cells (Fig. 4B). These differences in STAT3 activation directly correlated with a significantly higher SOCS3 expression in HGF/IL-6-stimulated AlfpCre gp130Y757F/LoxP hepatocytes (Fig. 4C). LPS Stimulation Delays Cell Cycle Progression after Partial Hepatectomy—Our earlier results using inducible gp130 knock-out animals demonstrated that PH/LPS stimulation resulted in inhibition of cell cycle progression (13Wuestefeld T. Klein C. Streetz K.L. Betz U. Lauber J. Buer J. Manns M.P. Muller W. Trautwein C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11281-11288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). We thus injected in all mouse strains LPS (4 mg/kg) 3 h after PH and quantified DNA synthesis via BrdUrd staining. In all PH/LPS-treated mouse strains the maximum in BrdUrd-positive cells could be detected 48 h after PH (Fig. 5A). In wt and AlfpCre gp130Y757F/LoxP animals, a maximum of 30% BrdUrd-positive hepatocytes was found. In contrast, in AlfpCre gp130LoxP/LoxP and AlfpCre gp130ΔSTAT/LoxP animals, quantification of BrdUrd-positive hepatocytes revealed 10 and 20%, respectively (Fig. 5B). These results demonstrated a reduction in DNA synthesis after LPS treatment (Fig. 2B versus Fig. 5B). No difference in mortality was found between the four groups during the first 72 h after PH (data not shown). Reduced Cyclin A Expression and Cdk2 Activity after PH and LPS Stimulation in Animals with a Hepatocyte-specific Deleted gp130-STAT Pathway—We analyzed the progression of cell cycle markers in the PH/LPS-treated strains. Differences in cyclin E1 expression were evident. A maximum in cyclin E1 expression was found after 48 h in wt, AlfpCre gp130ΔSTAT/LoxP, and AlfpCre gp130Y757F/LoxP animals, whereas Alfp-Cre gp130LoxP/LoxP animals showed only very low expression levels (Fig. 6A). In AlfpCre gp130Y757F/LoxP mice an overall significantly (p = 0.039, compared with wt) higher expression level was evident between 40 and 72 h after PH/LPS stimulation. AlfpCre gp130ΔSTAT/LoxP and wt mice exhibited almost similar cyclin E1 expression. In all four groups maximal cyclin A expression was found after 48 h (Fig. 6B). However, significantly higher cyclin A expression was found in wt and AlfpCre gp130Y757F/LoxP animals. In AlfpCre gp130LoxP/LoxP animals only very transient weak expression could be detected at the 48-h time point, whereas in AlfpCre gp130ΔSTAT/LoxP mice the same expression level was present between 40 and 72 h after PH/LPS treatment. Cdk2 assays revealed a strong activity 48 h after PH/LPS in wt mice, and in AlfpCre gp130Y757F/LoxP a similar activation was detected at the 48-h time point (Fig. 6C). However, in these animals an even stronger Cdk2 activity was still observed after 72 h. Dramatic differences were found in Alfp-Cre gp130ΔSTAT/LoxP and AlfpCre gp130LoxP/LoxP animals. Only weak activity was evident at 48 h after PH/LPS treatment in AlfpCre gp130LoxP/LoxP animals. In contrast to the other strains, AlfpCre gp130ΔSTAT/LoxP mice showed an earlier peak 40 h after PH. Therefore these results suggested that LPS treatment delays the start of DNA synthesis in all four mice strains. Additionally, lack of gp130-STAT-dependent signaling significantly reduced DNA synthesis. Acute Phase Response Regulation in the Four Mouse Strains after Combined PH and LPS Treatment—LPS stimulation may trigger alternative pathways e.g. via Toll-like receptors that are involved in regulating the acute phase response. Therefore we first determined SAA mRNA expression in the four mouse strains. A strong increase with a maximum after 24 h was found after PH/LPS treatment in wt animals (Fig. 7A). Maximum SAA expression was 2-fold higher and more prolonged compared with wt animals treated with PH only (see Fig. 1A). In AlfpCre gp130LoxP/LoxP animals no significant increase in SAA expression was observed during the first 72 h after PH despite additional LPS stimulation. However, in AlfpCre gp130ΔSTAT/LoxP mice after 24 h, a 250-fold induction of SAA was evident. This response was delayed as after 6 h, in contrast to wt animals, no significant up-regulation of SAA was found. SAA expression during the first 24 h showed a level comparable with that of wt mice. At a later time SAA expression continuously increased up to 72 h, when a more than 600-fold SAA elevation of RNA was evident compared with the pretreatment level. P-STAT3 induction in the wt group was found 6 and 12 h after PH/LPS treatment, and this effect was stronger comp"
https://openalex.org/W2167675162,"Protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) catalytic subunits dephosphorylate specific substrates in discrete subcellular compartments to modulate many cellular processes. Canonical PP1-binding motifs (R/K-V/I-X-F) in a family of proteins mediate subcellular targeting, and the amino acids that form the binding pocket for the canonical motif are identical in all PP1 isoforms. However, PP1gamma1 but not PP1beta is selectively localized to F-actin-rich dendritic spines in neurons. Although the F-actin-binding proteins neurabin I and spinophilin (neurabin II) also bind PP1, their role in PP1 isoform selective targeting in intact cells is poorly understood. We show here that spinophilin selectively targets PP1gamma1, but not PP1beta, to F-actin-rich cortical regions of intact cells. Mutation of a PP1gamma1 selectivity determinant (N(464)EDYDRR(470) in spinophilin: conserved as residues 473-479 in neurabin) to VKDYDTW severely attenuated PP1gamma1 interactions with neurabins in vitro and in cells and disrupted PP1gamma1 targeting to F-actin. This domain is not involved in the weaker interactions of neurabins with PP1beta. In contrast, mutation of the canonical PP1-binding motif attenuated interactions of neurabins with both isoforms. Thus, selective targeting of PP1gamma1 to F-actin by neurabins in intact cells requires both the canonical PP1-binding motif and an auxiliary PP1gamma1-selectivity determinant."
https://openalex.org/W1991083357,"THE method of paper partition chromatography provides a simple micro technique for the separation1 and estimation2 of mixtures of reducing sugars, such as result from the hydrolysis of complex poly-saccharides. It is possible to obtain an indication of the identity of the separated sugars from a comparison of their Rg values1,3 and their colour reactions when heated with a solution of naphthoresorcinol in 12 per cent hydrochloric acid4,1, but in some instances the results are inconclusive. For example, fructose (Rg 0·13), sorbose (0·11) and tagatose (0·13) possess very similar Rg values and all give a characteristic red colour with the naphthoresorcinol reagent, and they cannot, therefore, be identified by these properties alone. The difficulty has been overcome by use of a column of powdered cellulose5, on which it is possible to separate by partition chromatography sufficiently large quantities of the sugars to permit of their identification in the usual way by determination of physical constants and the formation of characteristic derivatives."

Although HTS and HTA catalyze similar chemical reactions, these proteins are typically unrelated in both sequence and three-dimensional structure. Here we present the 2.0 Å resolution x-ray crystal structure of the Bacillus cereus metA protein in complex with homoserine, which provides the first view of a ligand bound to either HTA or HTS. Surprisingly, functional analysis of the B. cereus metA protein shows that it does not use succinyl-CoA as a substrate. Instead, the protein catalyzes the transacetylation of homoserine using acetyl-CoA. Therefore, the B. cereus metA protein functions as an HTA despite greater than 50% sequence identity with bona fide HTS proteins.

Kinetic analysis of site-directed mutants reveals that the B. cereus metA protein and the E. coli HTS share a common catalytic mechanism.

Within this enzyme family, HTS and HTA activity likely arises from divergent evolution in a common structural scaffold with conserved catalytic machinery and homoserine binding sites. Bacteria, fungi, and plants synthesize methionine from aspartate, which is also a precursor of lysine, threonine, and isoleucine (1Umbarger H.E. Annu. Rev.

In addition to its role in protein synthesis, methionine is a key component for production of S-adenosylmethionine, a biologically important methyl group donor. S-adenosylmethionine, in turn, may be a metabolite in the biosynthesis of acylhomoserine lactones, which act as quorum sensing signals in pathogenesis and biofilm formation (3Hanzelka B.L.

Although HTS and HTA are encoded by genes (metA and met2, respectively) that share no sequence homology, these enzymes catalyze reactions using similar substrates.

Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 15768-15773Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) suggest that the B. cereus metA protein contains a catalytic triad consisting of Cys-142, His-235, and Glu-237, which is located at the bottom of a surface groove between two α-helices (21Zubieta C.

Here we describe the determination of the three-dimensional structure of the B. cereus metA protein in complex with homoserine. This structure provides the first view of a ligand bound to either HTA or HTS and clearly defines the active site in the B. cereus metA protein. Surprisingly, functional analysis of the B. cereus metA protein reveals that it does not use succinyl-CoA as a substrate; instead, it catalyzes the transacetylation of homoserine using acetyl-CoA. Therefore, the B. cereus metA protein functions as an HTA and not an HTS despite its similarity with this protein (21Zubieta C. Krishna S.S. McMullan D. Miller M.D. Abdubek P. Agarwalla S. Ambing E.

Nature. 2003; 423: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). Kinetic analysis of site-directed mutants reveals that the B. cereus metA protein and the E. coli HTS share a common catalytic mechanism and that a single amino acid in the active site determines acetyl- versus succinyl-CoA specificity in the metA-type acyltransferases involved in bacterial methionine biosynthesis. Mutagenesis, Expression, and Purification—Site-directed mutants of the B. cereus metA protein were generated using oligonucleotides (Integrated DNA Technologies) encoding the desired mutation and the QuikChange PCR method (Stratagene). Automated nucleotide sequencing confirmed the fidelity of the mutant gene sequences (Washington University Sequencing Facility, St. Louis, MO). Wild-type and mutant B. cereus metA were expressed in E. coli strain HK100 Gene-Hogs (Invitrogen) and E. coli BL21(DE3) (Novagen), respectively. Transformed E. coli were grown at 37 °C in Terrific broth containing 50 μgml-1 kanamycin until A600 nm ∼ 0.8. After induction with 0.15% (v/v) arabinose, cultures were grown at 25 °C for 4-8 h. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 1% (v/v) Tween 20. After sonication and centrifugation, the supernatant was passed over a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA)-agarose column. The column was washed with wash buffer (lysis buffer minus Tween 20). His-tagged protein was eluted with elution buffer (wash buffer with 250 mm imidazole), and the eluant was incubated with His-tagged tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease (1 mg of TEV protease per 10 mg of eluted protein) during overnight dialysis at 4 °C against wash buffer. Dialyzed protein was reloaded on an Ni2+-NTA column equilibrated with wash buffer to deplete the sample of uncleaved B. cereus metA protein and tobacco etch virus protease. The flow-through of this step was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 30% (v/v) glycerol, 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, then loaded onto a Superdex-200 size-exclusion fast protein liquid chromatography column equilibrated in the same buffer without glycerol. Fractions containing purified protein were concentrated to 15 mg ml-1 and stored at -80 °C. X-ray Crystallography—The B. cereus metA protein (15 mg ml-1) was crystallized using the hanging drop vapor diffusion technique. Protein (1 μl) was added to a 1-μl drop of crystallization solution containing 1.4 m (NH4)2SO4 and 0.1 m Tris (pH 8.0) at 4 °C. Crystals were harvested and soaked overnight in 1.8 m (NH4)2SO4, 0.1 m Tris (pH 8.0), 15% (v/v) glycerol, and 10 mm homoserine. For data collection, crystals were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Data collection was performed at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Facility on monochromatic beamline 9-1. Crystals were indexed as space group P4122. The data were integrated and reduced using XDS (23Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3200) Google Scholar) and scaled with XSCALE (23Kabsch W. J. Appl.

Because ice rings were observed during data collection, reflections between 3.93 and 3.87, 3.70 and 3.64, 3.47 and 3.41, and 2.70 and 2.64 Å were omitted from the final data set. In the final model 96.6% of residues were in the most favored region of the Ramachandran plot and 3.4% were in the additionally allowed region. The atomic coordinates (Protein Data Bank code 2VDJ) and structure factors (R2VDJSF) for the B. cereus metA-homoserine complex have been deposited.TABLE 1Crystallographic statisticsCrystal Space groupP 4122 Cell dimensionsa = b = 96.39 Å, c = 75.58 Å; α = β = γ = 90.0°Data collection Wavelength (Å)0.9790 Resolution range (Å)20.0-2.0 Reflections (total/unique)157,362/22,875 Completeness (highest shell)92.7% (98.5%)aThe highest resolution shell (2.11-2.00 Å) is in parentheses 〈I/σ〉 (highest shell)17.1 (2.50)aThe highest resolution shell (2.11-2.00 Å) is in parentheses RsymbRsym = Σ|Ih – 〈Ih〉|/ΣIh, where 〈Ih〉 is the average intensity over symmetry (highest shell)11.4 (51.5)aThe highest resolution shell (2.11-2.00 Å) is in parenthesesModel and Refinement Resolution range (Å)19.47-2.0 Reflections (total/test)21,729 (1,144) RcrystcRcryst = Σ|Fo – 〈Fc〉|/ΣFo, where summation is over the data used for refinement/RfreedRfree is defined the same as Rcryst but was calculated using 5% of data excluded from refinement19.9/24.6% No. of protein atoms2,226 No. of water molecules212 No. of ligand atoms8 homoserine, 5 sulfate Root mean square deviation, bond lengths0.007 Å Root mean square deviation, bond angles0.987° Average isotropic B-factor (Å2)26.9 Estimated overall coordinate error based on Rfree (Å)0.166a The highest resolution shell (2.11-2.00 Å) is in parenthesesb Rsym = Σ|Ih – 〈Ih〉|/ΣIh, where 〈Ih〉 is the average intensity over symmetryc Rcryst = Σ|Fo – 〈Fc〉|/ΣFo, where summation is over the data used for refinementd Rfree is defined the same as Rcryst but was calculated using 5% of data excluded from refinement Open table in a new tab Kinetic Analysis—Initial velocities were determined at 25 °C by monitoring the change in absorbance at 232 nm that results from hydrolysis of the thioester bond of acetyl-CoA (ϵ = 4500 m-1 cm-1). Standard assay conditions are 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), 2 mm l-homoserine, and 0.5 mm acyl-CoA in a final volume of 500 μl. Kinetic parameters were determined by varying the concentration of one substrate at different fixed concentrations of the second substrate. Initial velocity kinetic data were fit to the equation for a two-substrate reaction, v = (V[A][B])/(Ka[B] + Kb[A] + [A][B]), where V is the observed rate, and Ka and Kb are the Km values for each substrate, in Sigmaplot (Systat Software, Inc.). Overall Structure—Crystal structures of the unliganded forms of H. influenzae HTA and the B. cereus metA protein have been solved (20Mirza I.A. Nazi I. Korczynska M. Wright G.D. Berghuis A.M. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 15768-15773Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 21Zubieta C. Krishna S.S. McMullan D. Miller M.D. Abdubek P. Agarwalla S. Ambing E. Astakhova T. Axelrod H.L. Carlton D. Proteins. 2007; 68: 999-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), but no details are available on how substrates or inhibitors bind to these proteins. The three-dimensional structure of the B. cereus metA protein in complex with homoserine was determined by x-ray crystallography at 2.0 Å of resolution (Table 1 and Fig. 2A). The overall structure is a homodimer, and within the structure of each monomer, residues 1-16, 75-86, and 297-301 were disordered. The overall fold of the metA-homoserine complex is similar to that of the apoenzyme structure (21Zubieta C. Krishna S.S. McMullan D. Miller M.D. Abdubek P. Agarwalla S. Ambing E. Astakhova T. Axelrod H.L. Carlton D. Proteins. 2007; 68: 999-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) with a 0.25-Å2 root mean square deviation of Cα atoms between the two structures. When bound with homoserine, the largest structural change occurs in a loop region preceding helix H1. Residues 43-46 of this loop shift up to 2.3 Å toward the active site; however, none of the residues in this loop contact the bound homoserine molecule and are 15 Å away from the proposed catalytic residues. The position of bound homoserine clearly defines the location of the active site in the B. cereus metA protein. Unambiguous electron density in the initial 2Fo - Fc and Fo - Fc maps was visible for homoserine (Fig. 2B). Substrates access the putative catalytic residues (Cys-142, His-235, and Glu-237) through a short tunnel leading from the enzyme surface (Fig. 2C). The proposed catalytic cysteine is positioned at the bottom of this pocket. Consistent with the ping-pong kinetic mechanism of the HTA and HTS from various bacteria (12Born T.L. Blanchard J.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14416-14423Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 15Wyman A. Paulus H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 3897-3903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Born T.L. Franklin M. Blanchard J.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8556-8564Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), in which only one substrate binds at each step of the reaction, homoserine binding in the entrance prevents access of other molecules (i.e. acyl-CoA) to the active site. The Homoserine Binding Site—The three-dimensional structure of the B. cereus metA protein in complex with homoserine provides the first view of the molecular interactions involved in substrate binding at the active site of either HTA or HTS. Multiple side-chain, main-chain, and water-meditated contacts bind homoserine in the B. cereus metA active site (Figs. 3, A and B). Binding of homoserine positions the homoserine hydroxyl group near Cys-142 and within hydrogen bonding distance of His-235 (Figs. 3, A and B). Adjacent to Cys-142, the Nϵ of His-235 is within hydrogen-bonding distance of the cysteine sulfhydryl group. The Nδ of His-235 is positioned to interact with the carboxylate of Glu-237. These residues form the proposed catalytic triad of the enzyme. In addition, the homoserine hydroxyl group is within hydrogen bonding distance of an active site water molecule, which in turn interacts with another water molecule bound by the main-chain nitrogens of Ala-108 and Trp-143. The location of this water molecule between Ala-108 and Trp-143 likely approximates the position of an oxyanion hole that stabilizes the tetrahedral reaction intermediates of the chemical mechanism. Additional interactions between the substrate and the protein are formed. The carboxylate of homoserine forms a bidentate charge-charge interaction with Arg-249 and a charge-charge interaction with Lys-163. An active site water molecule and the backbone carbonyl and side-chain hydroxyl groups of Ser-192 provide hydrogen bonds with the amino moiety of the substrate. Amino acid sequence comparison between E. coli HTS and B. cereus metA shows that the three catalytic residues (Cys-142, His-235, and Glu-237) and the residues forming the homoserine binding site (Ala-108, Trp-143, Lys-163, Ser-192, Arg-249, and Glu-250) are invariant between the two proteins. Functional Analysis—The B. cereus metA gene was annotated as an HTS based on sequence similarity with bona fide HTS proteins and genes (22Ivanova N. Sorokin A. Anderson I. Galleron N. Candelon B. Kapatral V. Bhattacharyya A. Reznik G. Mikhailova N. Lapidus A. Chu L. Mazur M. Goltsman E. Larsen N. D'Souza M. Walunas T. Grechkin Y. Pusch G. Haselkorn R. Fonstein M. Ehrlich S.D. Overbeek R. Kyrpides N. Nature. 2003; 423: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). To verify the activity of the protein, B. cereus metA was assayed with different acyl-CoAs and homoserine. Surprisingly, no activity was observed when succinyl-CoA and homoserine were tested as potential substrates; however, the B. cereus metA protein was active with acetyl-CoA and homoserine (Table 2). The catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of the B. cereus metA protein for homoserine is comparable to that of the S. pombe HTA (8830 m-1 s-1), although the kcat/Km of the Bacillus protein for acetyl-CoA is 98-fold lower than the fungal enzyme (17Nazi I. Wright G.D. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 13560-13566Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Compared with the H. influenzae HTA (16Born T.L. Franklin M. Blanchard J.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8556-8564Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), the Km values of the B. cereus metA protein for either substrate are less than 2-fold different, but the turnover numbers are roughly 100-fold lower. Nonetheless, the metA protein from B. cereus is not an HTS, as annotated by genome comparisons and structural genomics (21Zubieta C. Krishna S.S. McMullan D. Miller M.D. Abdubek P. Agarwalla S.

In addition, mutations of Lys-47 were generated to test the role of this residue, which was previously suggested to have a catalytic role in the bacterial HTS (27Rosen R. Becher D. Buttner K. Biran D. Hecker M. Ron E. FEBS Lett. 2004; 577: 386-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Expression and purification of the mutants used the same methods as wild-type enzyme. All proteins were obtained in yields and homogeneity comparable with wild-type enzyme, and all were isolated as homodimers, based on size-exclusion chromatography. Substitution of either alanine or serine for Cys-142 yielded inactive enzyme, which is consistent with the proposed role of this residue as the catalytic nucleophile. Likewise, mutation of His-235 to alanine, glutamine, or asparagine resulted in inactivation of the enzyme. Mutants of Glu-237 retained catalytic activity albeit with 6-65-fold decreases in kcat (Table 2). Overall, these results are similar to those reported for changes in the catalytic triad of the HTA from yeast and the HTS from bacteria (17Nazi I. Wright G.D. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 13560-13566Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 18Ziegler K. Noble S.M. Mutumanje E. Bishop B. Huddler D.P. Born T.L. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 2674-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 19Coe D.M. Viola R.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2007; 461: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), suggesting a conserved reaction mechanism between these enzymes of different three-dimensional structures. Mutation of Lys-47 affects the reaction catalyzed by the enzyme (Table 2). The K47R mutant primarily affects the Km value for acetyl-CoA. Similar results were observed with the K47M mutant, which reduces the turnover number by 14-fold and the Km for acetyl-CoA by 17-fold. Given the location of this residue in the structure (i.e. 15 Å from the active site cysteine), this residue appears to function in acyl-CoA binding, most likely by interaction with CoA and not the acyl group as previously suggested (19Coe D.M. Viola R.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2007; 461: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 27Rosen R. Becher D. Buttner K. Biran D. Hecker M. Ron E. FEBS Lett. 2004; 577: 386-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and is not directly involved in catalysis or homoserine binding. Mutagenesis of Homoserine Binding Residues—The contribution to catalysis of residues with side chains that form interactions with homoserine was probed using site-directed mutagenesis. The K163M, S192A, R249M, and E250A mutants were expressed, purified, and assayed using acetyl-CoA and homoserine as substrates (Table 2). Each mutant retained activity and showed less than a 3-fold change in Km for acetyl-CoA. Replacement of Arg-249 with methionine resulted in the largest changes in kinetic parameters compared with the other mutations. The R249M mutant displayed a 10-fold reduction in kcat and a 64-fold higher Km for homoserine compared with wild-type enzyme. Substitution of Lys-163 or Glu-250 yielded proteins with 13-14-fold increases in the homoserine Km values. A 5-fold increase in the Km for homoserine was observed with the S192A mutant. These results indicate that each residue forming the binding site plays a role in homoserine binding but contribute little to acyl-CoA interaction. The Acyltransferase Substrate Specificity Switch—Modeling of the acetyl-enzyme intermediate in the homoserine complex structure (Fig. 4A) shows that the B. cereus metA active site readily accommodates this reaction intermediate. Examination of the model showed that Glu-111 is oriented toward the reactive cysteine residue and sterically occludes fitting of a succinyl-enzyme intermediate in the active site. Comparison with E. coli HTS showed that the corresponding residue is a glycine, suggesting that the identity of this amino acid may control acyl-CoA substrate specificity. Modeling of the glycine substitution in the active site (Fig. 4B) indicates that this mutation removes a negative charge-charge interaction and enlarges the space available to accommodate a succinyl group. To test this hypothesis the B. cereus metA protein E111G mutant was generated, expressed, and purified. The purified mutant protein showed no detectable activity with acetyl-CoA but catalyzed an acyltransferase reaction using succinyl-CoA and homoserine. The steady-state kinetic parameters of the E111G mutant (kcat = 48.2 ± 6.4 min-1; Kmsuccinyl-CoA = 273 ± 22.1 μm; Kmhomoserine = 200 ± 37 μm) were determined. The catalytic efficiency of the mutant with homoserine (4,020 m-1 s-1) is comparable with wild-type enzyme, and the kcat/Km for succinyl-CoA (2940 m-1 s-1) is less than 2-fold different from that of the metA protein for acetyl-CoA (Fig. 4). The three-dimensional structure of the B. cereus metA protein in complex with homoserine provides insight on the chemical reaction mechanism and how acyltransferase specificity is determined in the bacterial metA-type HTA and HTS. The location of a catalytic triad (Cys-143, His-235, and Glu-237) at the base of a short tunnel from the enzyme surface allows access of only one substrate (i.e. either acetyl-CoA or homoserine) at a time. Within the active site, the pattern of hydrogen bond interactions between the sulfhydryl group of Cys-142 and Nϵ of His-235 and between the carboxylate of Glu-237 and Nδ of His-235 is identical to that observed in the crystal structure of the fungal HTA, except that a cysteine replaces the serine found in this enzyme (20Mirza I.A. Nazi I. Korczynska M. Wright G.D. Berghuis A.M. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 15768-15773Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Although the structures of the metA-type of HTS/HTA (21Zubieta C. Krishna S.S. McMullan D. Miller M.D. Abdubek P. Agarwalla S. Ambing E. Astakhova T. Axelrod H.L. Carlton D. Proteins. 2007; 68: 999-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and the met2-type of HTA (20Mirza I.A. Nazi I. Korczynska M. Wright G.D. Berghuis A.M. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 15768-15773Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) are different, these scaffolds have convergently evolved nearly identical active site constellations for a shared chemical reaction. This arrangement of catalytic amino acids readily allows for activation of the nucleophilic cysteine residue in the B. cereus metA protein. During the first half or “ping” reaction catalyzed by B. cereus metA, binding of acetyl-CoA results in formation of an acetyl-enzyme intermediate (Fig. 5). Interaction between His-235 and Cys-142 yields an activated thiol that attacks the carbonyl group of the substrate. This results in a tetrahedral transition state stabilized by interactions with the backbone nitrogens of Ala-108 and Trp-143, which form an oxyanion binding site. Collapse of the transition state leaves a thioester-linked acetyl group on Cys-142 and releases free CoA. The second half or “pong” reaction begins with homoserine binding to the acetylated enzyme. The position of homoserine in the structure of the B. cereus metA protein leaves sufficient space to accommodate an acetyl group linked to Cys-142 (Fig. 4A). Modeling of the thioester-linked intermediate to interact with the main-chain nitrogens of Ala-108 and Trp-143 also positions the carbonyl for reaction with the hydroxyl group of homoserine. Acting as a general base, His-235 abstracts a proton from the substrate hydroxyl group, which then acts as a nucleophile to attack the thioester of the acyl-enzyme intermediate (Fig. 5). Subsequent collapse of the second transition state yields O-acetylhomoserine as the product. Kinetic analysis of B. cereus metA proteins with mutations in the catalytic triad is consistent with the proposed reaction mechanism (Table 2). Replacement of either Cys-142 or His-235 yields inactive protein, and substitutions of Glu-237 impair activity. Removal of the nucleophilic cysteine prevents catalysis. Similarly, substitution of His-235 likely affects the activation of the catalytic sulfhydryl group and removes the general base required for the second half reaction. Mutations of Glu-237 may alter positioning and/or reactivity of the imidazole side chain of His-235 but would still permit the cysteine-histidine pair to retain a degree of catalytic function. Moreover, the results of detailed kinetic studies of E. coli HTS (18Ziegler K. Noble S.M. Mutumanje E. Bishop B. Huddler D.P. Born T.L. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 2674-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 19Coe D.M. Viola R.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2007; 461: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) also strongly support the use of a common catalytic mechanism in the related metA-type of HTA and HTS. In addition to conservation of the catalytic machinery, the amino acids forming the homoserine binding site of the B. cereus metA protein and E. coli HTS are invariant. The structure presented here provides the first experimental representation of a substrate bound to either an HTA or HTS. Site-directed mutagenesis of Lys-163, Ser-192, Arg-249, and Glu-250 indicate that each residue significantly contributes to homoserine binding (Table 2). Based on the steady-state kinetic parameters of the R249M mutant compared with wild-type enzyme, the interaction between Arg-249 and the carboxylate of homoserine is a dominant interaction. Substitution of Glu-250 with an alanine may change the orientation of Arg-249 and its contact with the substrate. The K163M and S192A mutants remove side-chain interactions with homoserine, and the kinetic parameters of these proteins reflect these changes. The original annotation of the B. cereus metA gene as encoding an HTS was based on the greater than 50% sequence identity with bacterial metA genes encoding bona fide HTS (10Rowbury R.J. Woods D.D.

Cell. 1998; 30: 286-294Google Scholar); however, functional analysis of the B. cereus metA protein clearly demonstrates it as an HTA, not an HTS (30Ziegler K. Yusupov M. Bishop B. Born T.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 361: 510-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Similarly, a gene from Thermotoga maritima with 50% sequence identity to the E. coli HTS and no discernible homology with met2-type of HTA was recently shown to encode a functional HTA instead of an HTS (31Goudarzi M. Born T.L. Extremophiles. 2006; 10: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Structural and functional analysis of wild-type and mutant B. cereus metA demonstrates that changing Glu-111 to a glycine switches substrate preference from acetyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA (Fig. 4). Further examination of the metA-like proteins in the NCBI non-redundant sequence databases shows that these proteins can be separated into two families based on the identity of residue 111, i.e. glycine versus glutamate (see the supplemental table). Functionally characterized metA-like proteins that function as HTS have a glycine at this position in the active site. In contrast, this residue is a glutamate in the metA-like proteins that prefer acetyl-CoA as a substrate. Within enzyme superfamilies that share a common three-dimensional scaffold and related amino acid sequence, the divergence of substrate specificity with retention of core active site residues and chemistry provides an efficient means of evolving new enzyme activity by modifying substrate specificity (32Jensen T.A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1976; 30: 409-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar, 33Penning T.M. Jez J.M. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 3027-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Diversification of acyl-CoA specificity in HTA and HTS involved in methionine biosynthesis appears to have occurred in different bacterial species through a single amino acid difference in the active site. The details of the methionine biosynthetic pathway in the Bacillus genus are poorly understood (34Auger S. Yuen W.H. Danchin A. Martin-Verstraete I. Microbiol. 2002; 148: 507-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), but in the context of the pathway HTA and HTS are functionally equivalent (Fig. 1). Examination of the genome of B. cereus shows that the metA gene is in a cluster of metabolic genes that includes genes for O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase (cysD), a cysteine biosynthesis enzyme, and homoserine dehydrogenase (hom), another methionine biosynthetic enzyme (21Zubieta C. Krishna S.S. McMullan D. Miller M.D. Abdubek P. Agarwalla S. Ambing E. Astakhova T. Axelrod H.L. Carlton D. Proteins. 2007; 68: 999-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). As noted here, the B. cereus metA gene should be re-annotated as encoding an HTA instead of an HTS. The B. cereus genome contains a gene located near no other amino acid biosynthesis genes that is annotated as an HTA. This putative HTA gene shares less than 30% sequence identity with authentic bacterial HTA genes and encodes an uncharacterized protein of unknown function. Interestingly, both B. subtilis and B. polymyxa use O-acetylhomoserine, not O-succinylhomoserine, for methionine synthesis (15Wyman A. Paulus H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 3897-3903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Auger S. Yuen W.H. Danchin A. Martin-Verstraete I. Microbiol. 2002; 148: 507-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In addition, B. subtilis cystathionine-γ-synthase, the next enzyme in the methionine biosynthesis pathway, specifically accepts O-acetylhomoserine as a substrate and is inactive with the succinylated molecule (34Auger S. Yuen W.H. Danchin A. Martin-Verstraete I. Microbiol. 2002; 148: 507-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Although the B. cereus metA protein is catalytically less efficient than other bacterial HTA and HTS homologs, it may provide sufficient activity for methionine synthesis in B. cereus. Analysis of the B. cereus metA protein reinforces the need for functional confirmation of annotations of enzyme function based on either sequence or structural comparisons. Annotation of gene and protein function based solely on structural comparisons is insufficient in many cases because it neglects the biological framework. The B. cereus metA provides an example of the need for scrutiny when using structural and sequence results alone to annotate function. Often, biochemical confirmation of protein function is needed to overcome the limitations inherent to high throughput structural initiatives in determining protein function.

https://openalex.org/W1989370275,"Background Although strategies to contain influenza pandemics are well studied, the characterization and the implications of different geographical and temporal diffusion patterns of the pandemic have been given less attention. Methodology/Main Findings Using a well-documented metapopulation model incorporating air travel between 52 major world cities, we identified potential influenza pandemic diffusion profiles and examined how the impact of interventions might be affected by this heterogeneity. Clustering methods applied to a set of pandemic simulations, characterized by seven parameters related to the conditions of emergence that were varied following Latin hypercube sampling, were used to identify six pandemic profiles exhibiting different characteristics notably in terms of global burden (from 415 to >160 million of cases) and duration (from 26 to 360 days). A multivariate sensitivity analysis showed that the transmission rate and proportion of susceptibles have a strong impact on the pandemic diffusion. The correlation between interventions and pandemic outcomes were analyzed for two specific profiles: a fast, massive pandemic and a slow building, long-lasting one. In both cases, the date of introduction for five control measures (masks, isolation, prophylactic or therapeutic use of antivirals, vaccination) correlated strongly with pandemic outcomes. Conversely, the coverage and efficacy of these interventions only moderately correlated with pandemic outcomes in the case of a massive pandemic. Pre-pandemic vaccination influenced pandemic outcomes in both profiles, while travel restriction was the only measure without any measurable effect in either. Conclusions Our study highlights: (i) the great heterogeneity in possible profiles of a future influenza pandemic; (ii) the value of being well prepared in every country since a pandemic may have heavy consequences wherever and whenever it starts; (iii) the need to quickly implement control measures and even to anticipate pandemic emergence through pre-pandemic vaccination; and (iv) the value of combining all available control measures except perhaps travel restrictions."
https://openalex.org/W2082772612,"In the mammalian genome, a substantial number of gene pairs (approximately 10%) are arranged head-to-head on opposite strands within 1,000 base pairs, and separated by a bidirectional promoter(s) that generally drives the co-expression of both genes and results in functional coupling. The significance of unique genomic configuration remains elusive.Here we report on the identification of an intergenic region of non-homologous genes, CDT2, a regulator of DNA replication, and an integrator complex subunit 7 (INTS7), an interactor of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II. The CDT2-INTS7 intergenic region is 246 and 245 base pairs long in human and mouse respectively and is evolutionary well-conserved among several mammalian species. By measuring the luciferase activity in A549 cells, the intergenic human sequence was shown to be able to drive the reporter gene expression in either direction and notably, among transcription factors E2F, E2F1 approximately E2F4, but not E2F5 and E2F6, this sequence clearly up-regulated the reporter gene expression exclusively in the direction of the CDT2 gene. In contrast, B-Myb, c-Myb, and p53 down-regulated the reporter gene expression in the transcriptional direction of the INTS7 gene. Overexpression of E2F1 by adenoviral-mediated gene transfer resulted in an increased CDT2, but not INTS7, mRNA level. Real-time polymerase transcription (RT-PCR) analyses of the expression pattern for CDT2 and INTS7 mRNA in human adult and fetal tissues and cell lines revealed that transcription of these two genes are asymmetrically regulated. Moreover, the abundance of mRNA between mouse and rat tissues was similar, but these patterns were quite different from the results obtained from human tissues.These findings add a unique example and help to understand the mechanistic insights into the regulation of gene expression through an evolutionary conserved intergenic region of the mammalian genome."

Here, we introduce a novel noninvasive technique for molecular imaging and quantitative evaluation of endothelial injury in the choriocapillaris of live animals, which detects disease earlier than currently possible. Using an established model of ocular inflammation, endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU), we visualized the rolling and adhesive interaction of fluorescent microspheres conjugated to recombinant P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-Ig (rPSGL-Ig) in choriocapillaris using a scanning laser ophthalmoscope (SLO). The number of rolling microspheres in the choriocapillaris peaked 4-10 h after LPS injection. The number of the accumulated microspheres peaked 4 h after LPS injection in the temporal choriocapillaris and 4 and 36 h after LPS injection in the central areas around the optic disk. Furthermore, we semiquantified the levels of P-selectin mRNA expression in the choroidal vessels by reverse transcription-PCR and found its pattern to match the functional microsphere interactions, with a peak at 4 h after LPS injection. These results indicate that PSGL-1-conjugated fluorescent microspheres allow specific detection of endothelial P-selectin expression in vivo and noninvasive assessment of endothelial injury. This technique may help to diagnose subclinical signs of ocular inflammatory diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1987018874,"Notch signaling is an evolutionarily conserved developmental pathway. Zebrafish mind bomb (mib) mutants carry mutations on mib gene, which encodes a RING E3 ligase required for Notch activation via Delta/Jagged ubiquitylation and internalization.We examined the mib mutants for defects in pancreas development using in situ hybridization and GFP expression analysis of pancreas-specific GFP lines, carried out the global gene expression profile analysis of three different mib mutant alleles and validated the microarray data using real-time PCR and fluorescent double in situ hybridization. Our study showed that the mib mutants have diminished exocrine pancreas and this defect was most severe in mib(ta52b) followed by mib(m132) and then mib(tfi91), which is consistent with the compromised Notch activity found in corresponding mib mutant alleles. Global expression profile analysis of mib mutants showed that there is a significant difference in gene expression profile of wt and three mib mutant alleles. There are 91 differentially expressed genes that are common to all three mib alleles. Through detailed analysis of microarray data, we have identified several previously characterized genes and some putative Notch-responsive genes involved in pancreas development. Moreover, results from real-time PCR and fluorescent double in situ hybridization were largely consistent with microarray data.This study provides, for the first time, a global gene expression profile in mib mutants generating useful genomic resources and providing an opportunity to identify the function of novel genes involved in Notch signaling and Notch-regulated developmental processes."

Many of the proteins such as urease, porins, flagellins and toxins such as lipo-polysaccharides have been identified as potential virulence factors which induce proinflammatory reaction. We report immunogenic potentials of isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICD), an important house keeping protein of H. pylori.Amino acid sequences of H. pylori ICD were subjected to in silico analysis for regions with predictably high antigenic indexes. Also, computational modelling of the H. pylori ICD as juxtaposed to the E. coli ICD was carried out to determine levels of structure similarity and the availability of surface exposed motifs, if any. The icd gene was cloned, expressed and purified to a very high homogeneity. Humoral response directed against H. pylori ICD was detected through an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in 82 human subjects comprising of 58 patients with H. pylori associated gastritis or ulcer disease and 24 asymptomatic healthy controls. The H. pylori ICD elicited potentially high humoral immune response and revealed high antibody titers in sera corresponding to endoscopically-confirmed gastritis and ulcer disease subjects. However, urea-breath-test negative healthy control samples and asymptomatic control samples did not reveal any detectable immune responses. The ELISA for proinflammatory cytokine IL-8 did not exhibit any significant proinflammatory activity of ICD.ICD of H. pylori is an immunogen which interacts with the host immune system subsequent to a possible autolytic-release and thereby significantly elicits humoral responses in individuals with invasive H. pylori infection. However, ICD could not significantly stimulate IL8 induction in a cultured macrophage cell line (THP1) and therefore, may not be a notable proinflammatory agent."

https://openalex.org/W2065534825,"Somatic hypermutation (SHM) of immunoglobulin genes is currently viewed as a two step process initiated by the deamination of deoxycytidine (C) to deoxyuridine (U), catalysed by the activation induced deaminase (AID). Phase 1 mutations arise from DNA replication across the uracil residue or the abasic site, generated by the uracil-DNA glycosylase, yielding transitions or transversions at G:C pairs. Phase 2 mutations result from the recognition of the U∶G mismatch by the Msh2/Msh6 complex (MutS Homologue), followed by the excision of the mismatched nucleotide and the repair, by the low fidelity DNA polymerase η, of the gap generated by the exonuclease I. These mutations are mainly focused at A∶T pairs. Whereas in activated B cells both G:C and A∶T pairs are equally targeted, ectopic expression of AID was shown to trigger only G:C mutations on a stably integrated reporter gene. Here we show that when using non-replicative episomal vectors containing a GFP gene, inactivated by the introduction of stop codons at various positions, a high level of EGFP positive cells was obtained after transient expression in Jurkat cells constitutively expressing AID. We show that mutations at G:C and A∶T pairs are produced. EGFP positive cells are obtained in the absence of vector replication demonstrating that the mutations are dependent only on the mismatch repair (MMR) pathway. This implies that the generation of phase 1 mutations is not a prerequisite for the expression of phase 2 mutations."
