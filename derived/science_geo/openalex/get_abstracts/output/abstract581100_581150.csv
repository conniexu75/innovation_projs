https://openalex.org/W2593488635,"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are largely heterogeneous and functionally uncharacterized. Here, using FANTOM5 cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) data, we integrate multiple transcript collections to generate a comprehensive atlas of 27,919 human lncRNA genes with high-confidence 5′ ends and expression profiles across 1,829 samples from the major human primary cell types and tissues. Genomic and epigenomic classification of these lncRNAs reveals that most intergenic lncRNAs originate from enhancers rather than from promoters. Incorporating genetic and expression data, we show that lncRNAs overlapping trait-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms are specifically expressed in cell types relevant to the traits, implicating these lncRNAs in multiple diseases. We further demonstrate that lncRNAs overlapping expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL)-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms of messenger RNAs are co-expressed with the corresponding messenger RNAs, suggesting their potential roles in transcriptional regulation. Combining these findings with conservation data, we identify 19,175 potentially functional lncRNAs in the human genome. A catalogue of human long non-coding RNA genes and their expression profiles across samples from major human primary cell types, tissues and cell lines. Alistair Forrest, Piero Carninci and colleagues of the FANTOM Consortium provide a catalogue of human long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) genes and their expression profiles across samples from human primary cell types, tissues and cell lines. They used combined analyses of multiple data sets to identify 27,919 lncRNA genes with high-confidence 5′ ends, as well as a subset of 19,175 potentially functional lncRNA loci. The lncRNA catalogue and annotations are available through an open web resource."

https://openalex.org/W2592615787,"With age, haematopoietic stem cells lose their ability to regenerate the blood system, and promote disease development. Autophagy is associated with health and longevity, and is critical for protecting haematopoietic stem cells from metabolic stress. Here we show that loss of autophagy in haematopoietic stem cells causes accumulation of mitochondria and an activated metabolic state, which drives accelerated myeloid differentiation mainly through epigenetic deregulations, and impairs haematopoietic stem-cell self-renewal activity and regenerative potential. Strikingly, most haematopoietic stem cells in aged mice share these altered metabolic and functional features. However, approximately one-third of aged haematopoietic stem cells exhibit high autophagy levels and maintain a low metabolic state with robust long-term regeneration potential similar to healthy young haematopoietic stem cells. Our results demonstrate that autophagy actively suppresses haematopoietic stem-cell metabolism by clearing active, healthy mitochondria to maintain quiescence and stemness, and becomes increasingly necessary with age to preserve the regenerative capacity of old haematopoietic stem cells. Loss of autophagy increases the accumulation of mitochondria and the respiration status of haematopoietic stem cells, which perturbs their self-renewal and regeneration activities, and promotes cellular aging. Ageing haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are not able to regenerate blood cells as well as their younger counterparts, and show bias towards particular lineages. But autophagy has previously been shown to protect HSCs from the effects of metabolic stress. Here Emmanuelle Passegué and colleagues find that loss of autophagy in HSCs increases the accumulation of mitochondria and raises the metabolic state of HSCs, disturbing their abilities for self-renewal and regeneration. This behaviour is similar to that observed in old HSCs, although about one-third of old HSCs still have a high level of autophagy and a low metabolic state to help them maintain their regenerative capacity."
https://openalex.org/W2594244343,"The discovery of two genes encoded by prophage WO from Wolbachia that functionally recapitulate and enhance cytoplasmic incompatibility in arthropods is the first inroad in solving the genetic basis of reproductive parasitism. Bacteria from the genus Wolbachia infect many arthropods, including the mosquitoes that are vectors for many viruses that infect humans. Wolbachia infection causes 'cytoplasmic incompatibility', which means that crosses between infected males and uninfected females lead to embryonic death, increasing the proportion of infected females in the population. The molecular basis for this effect has been unknown. Here, Seth Bordenstein and colleagues use comparative and transgenic approaches to identify two genes encoded by the prophage WO from Wolbachia that recapitulate cytoplasmic incompatibility. The discovery of these cytoplasmic incompatibility factors could lead to the genetic manipulation of WO-induced reproductive alterations, and may feed into efforts to control the transmission of arthropod-borne viruses to humans. The genus Wolbachia is an archetype of maternally inherited intracellular bacteria that infect the germline of numerous invertebrate species worldwide. They can selfishly alter arthropod sex ratios and reproductive strategies to increase the proportion of the infected matriline in the population. The most common reproductive manipulation is cytoplasmic incompatibility, which results in embryonic lethality in crosses between infected males and uninfected females. Females infected with the same Wolbachia strain rescue this lethality. Despite more than 40 years of research1 and relevance to symbiont-induced speciation2,3, as well as control of arbovirus vectors4,5,6 and agricultural pests7, the bacterial genes underlying cytoplasmic incompatibility remain unknown. Here we use comparative and transgenic approaches to demonstrate that two differentially transcribed, co-diverging genes in the eukaryotic association module of prophage WO8 from Wolbachia strain wMel recapitulate and enhance cytoplasmic incompatibility. Dual expression in transgenic, uninfected males of Drosophila melanogaster crossed to uninfected females causes embryonic lethality. Each gene additively augments embryonic lethality in crosses between infected males and uninfected females. Lethality associates with embryonic defects that parallel those of wild-type cytoplasmic incompatibility and is notably rescued by wMel-infected embryos in all cases. The discovery of cytoplasmic incompatibility factor genes cifA and cifB pioneers genetic studies of prophage WO-induced reproductive manipulations and informs the continuing use of Wolbachia to control dengue and Zika virus transmission to humans."
https://openalex.org/W2594299422,"Loss of proteostasis underlies ageing and neurodegeneration characterized by the accumulation of protein aggregates and mitochondrial dysfunction. Although many neurodegenerative-disease-associated proteins can be found in mitochondria, it remains unclear how mitochondrial dysfunction and protein aggregation could be related. In dividing yeast cells, protein aggregates that form under stress or during ageing are preferentially retained by the mother cell, in part through tethering to mitochondria, while the disaggregase Hsp104 helps to dissociate aggregates and thereby enables refolding or degradation of misfolded proteins. Here we show that, in yeast, cytosolic proteins prone to aggregation are imported into mitochondria for degradation. Protein aggregates that form under heat shock contain both cytosolic and mitochondrial proteins and interact with the mitochondrial import complex. Many aggregation-prone proteins enter the mitochondrial intermembrane space and matrix after heat shock, and some do so even without stress. Timely dissolution of cytosolic aggregates requires the mitochondrial import machinery and proteases. Blocking mitochondrial import but not proteasome activity causes a marked delay in the degradation of aggregated proteins. Defects in cytosolic Hsp70s leads to enhanced entry of misfolded proteins into mitochondria and elevated mitochondrial stress. We term this mitochondria-mediated proteostasis mechanism MAGIC (mitochondria as guardian in cytosol) and provide evidence that it may exist in human cells."
https://openalex.org/W2593053801,"The nuclear lamina is a fundamental constituent of metazoan nuclei. It is composed mainly of lamins, which are intermediate filament proteins that assemble into a filamentous meshwork, bridging the nuclear envelope and chromatin. Besides providing structural stability to the nucleus, the lamina is involved in many nuclear activities, including chromatin organization, transcription and replication. However, the structural organization of the nuclear lamina is poorly understood. Here we use cryo-electron tomography to obtain a detailed view of the organization of the lamin meshwork within the lamina. Data analysis of individual lamin filaments resolves a globular-decorated fibre appearance and shows that A- and B-type lamins assemble into tetrameric filaments of 3.5 nm thickness. Thus, lamins exhibit a structure that is remarkably different from the other canonical cytoskeletal elements. Our findings define the architecture of the nuclear lamin meshworks at molecular resolution, providing insights into their role in scaffolding the nuclear lamina."

We report RODEO (Rapid ORF Description and Evaluation Online), which combines hidden-Markov-model-based analysis, heuristic scoring, and machine learning to identify biosynthetic gene clusters and predict RiPP precursor peptides. We initially focused on lasso peptides, which display intriguing physicochemical properties and bioactivities, but their hypervariability renders them challenging prospects for automated mining. Our approach yielded the most comprehensive mapping to date of lasso peptide space, revealing >1,300 compounds. We characterized the structures and bioactivities of six lasso peptides, prioritized based on predicted structural novelty, including one with an unprecedented handcuff-like topology and another with a citrulline modification exceptionally rare among bacteria. These combined insights significantly expand the knowledge of lasso peptides and, more broadly, provide a framework for future genome-mining efforts."

https://openalex.org/W2592787461,"ENL, identified in a genome-scale loss-of-function screen as a crucial requirement for proliferation of acute leukaemia, is required for leukaemic gene expression, and its YEATS chromatin-reader domain is essential for leukaemic growth. Recurrent chromosomal translocations involving the mixed lineage leukaemia (MLL) gene give rise to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Here, James Bradner and colleagues perform a genome-scale loss-of-function screen using CRISPR–Cas9 technology in MLL-AF4 AML cells. They find that the ENL gene is critical for cell proliferation and use a chemical genetic strategy of targeted protein degradation to show that loss of ENL suppresses transcriptional activation as well as leukaemic growth. ENL-dependent leukaemic growth depends on its YEATS chromatin reader domain, indicating that competitive antagonists of the YEATS domain could be potential therapeutics for AML. A related paper in this week's issue of Nature from Xiaobing Shi and colleagues provides insights into the function of the ENL YEATS domain in recognizing acetylated histones. Recurrent chromosomal translocations producing a chimaeric MLL oncogene give rise to a highly aggressive acute leukaemia associated with poor clinical outcome1. The preferential involvement of chromatin-associated factors as MLL fusion partners belies a dependency on transcription control2. Despite recent progress made in targeting chromatin regulators in cancer3, available therapies for this well-characterized disease remain inadequate, prompting the need to identify new targets for therapeutic intervention. Here, using unbiased CRISPR–Cas9 technology to perform a genome-scale loss-of-function screen in an MLL-AF4-positive acute leukaemia cell line, we identify ENL as an unrecognized gene that is specifically required for proliferation in vitro and in vivo. To explain the mechanistic role of ENL in leukaemia pathogenesis and dynamic transcription control, a chemical genetic strategy was developed to achieve targeted protein degradation. Acute loss of ENL suppressed the initiation and elongation of RNA polymerase II at active genes genome-wide, with pronounced effects at genes featuring a disproportionate ENL load. Notably, an intact YEATS chromatin-reader domain was essential for ENL-dependent leukaemic growth. Overall, these findings identify a dependency factor in acute leukaemia and suggest a mechanistic rationale for disrupting the YEATS domain in disease."

https://openalex.org/W2593359096,"Cancer cells are characterized by aberrant epigenetic landscapes and often exploit chromatin machinery to activate oncogenic gene expression programs. Recognition of modified histones by 'reader' proteins constitutes a key mechanism underlying these processes; therefore, targeting such pathways holds clinical promise, as exemplified by the development of bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) inhibitors. We recently identified the YEATS domain as an acetyl-lysine-binding module, but its functional importance in human cancer remains unknown. Here we show that the YEATS domain-containing protein ENL, but not its paralogue AF9, is required for disease maintenance in acute myeloid leukaemia. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated depletion of ENL led to anti-leukaemic effects, including increased terminal myeloid differentiation and suppression of leukaemia growth in vitro and in vivo. Biochemical and crystal structural studies and chromatin-immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing analyses revealed that ENL binds to acetylated histone H3, and co-localizes with H3K27ac and H3K9ac on the promoters of actively transcribed genes that are essential for leukaemia. Disrupting the interaction between the YEATS domain and histone acetylation via structure-based mutagenesis reduced the recruitment of RNA polymerase II to ENL-target genes, leading to the suppression of oncogenic gene expression programs. Notably, disrupting the functionality of ENL further sensitized leukaemia cells to BET inhibitors. Together, our data identify ENL as a histone acetylation reader that regulates oncogenic transcriptional programs in acute myeloid leukaemia, and suggest that displacement of ENL from chromatin may be a promising epigenetic therapy, alone or in combination with BET inhibitors, for aggressive leukaemia."

https://openalex.org/W2593574576,"Brain-targeted oligonucleotide-drugs are poised to treat multiple human central nervous system disorders with an emphasis on rare/orphan conditions. Oligonucleotide therapies are currently experiencing a resurgence driven by advances in backbone chemistry and discoveries of novel therapeutic pathways that can be uniquely and efficiently modulated by the oligonucleotide drugs. A quarter of a century has passed since oligonucleotides were first applied in living mammalian brain to modulate gene expression. Despite challenges in delivery to the brain, multiple oligonucleotide-based compounds are now being developed for treatment of human brain disorders by direct delivery inside the blood brain barrier (BBB). Notably, the first new central nervous system (CNS)-targeted oligonucleotide-based drug (nusinersen/Spinraza) was approved by US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in late 2016 and several other compounds are in advanced clinical trials. Human testing of brain-targeted oligonucleotides has highlighted unusual pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of these compounds, including complex active uptake mechanisms, low systemic exposure, extremely long half-lives, accumulation and gradual release from subcellular depots. Further work on oligonucleotide uptake, development of formulations for delivery across the BBB and relevant disease biology studies are required for further optimization of the oligonucleotide drug development process for brain applications."
https://openalex.org/W2591796424,"The conserved Mediator co-activator complex has an essential role in the regulation of RNA polymerase II transcription in all eukaryotes. Understanding the structure and interactions of Mediator is crucial for determining how the complex influences transcription initiation and conveys regulatory information to the basal transcription machinery. Here we present a 4.4 Å resolution cryo-electron microscopy map of Schizosaccharomyces pombe Mediator in which conserved Mediator subunits are individually resolved. The essential Med14 subunit works as a central backbone that connects the Mediator head, middle and tail modules. Comparison with a 7.8 Å resolution cryo-electron microscopy map of a Mediator-RNA polymerase II holoenzyme reveals that changes in the structure of Med14 facilitate a large-scale Mediator rearrangement that is essential for holoenzyme formation. Our study suggests that access to different conformations and crosstalk between structural elements are essential for the Mediator regulation mechanism, and could explain the capacity of the complex to integrate multiple regulatory signals."
https://openalex.org/W2593904730,"Plant development requires coordination among complex signaling networks to enhance the plant's adaptation to changing environments. DELLAs, transcription regulators originally identified as repressors of phytohormone gibberellin signaling, play a central role in integrating multiple signaling activities via direct protein interactions with key transcription factors. Here, we found that DELLA is mono-O-fucosylated by the novel O-fucosyltransferase SPINDLY (SPY) in Arabidopsis thaliana. O-fucosylation activates DELLA by promoting its interaction with key regulators in brassinosteroid- and light-signaling pathways, including BRASSINAZOLE-RESISTANT1 (BZR1), PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING-FACTOR3 (PIF3) and PIF4. Moreover, spy mutants displayed elevated responses to gibberellin and brassinosteroid, and increased expression of common target genes of DELLAs, BZR1 and PIFs. Our study revealed that SPY-dependent protein O-fucosylation plays a key role in regulating plant development. This finding may have broader importance because SPY orthologs are conserved in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, thus suggesting that intracellular O-fucosylation may regulate a wide range of biological processes in diverse organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2592937673,"Two screening approaches converge on capzimin, a first-in-class inhibitor of the Rpn11 protease component of the 19S proteasome. Capzimin stabilizes polyubiquitinated substrates, induces the unfolded protein response, and blocks proliferation of cancer cells. The proteasome is a vital cellular machine that maintains protein homeostasis, which is of particular importance in multiple myeloma and possibly other cancers. Targeting of proteasome 20S peptidase activity with bortezomib and carfilzomib has been widely used to treat myeloma. However, not all patients respond to these compounds, and those who do eventually suffer relapse. Therefore, there is an urgent and unmet need to develop new drugs that target proteostasis through different mechanisms. We identified quinoline-8-thiol (8TQ) as a first-in-class inhibitor of the proteasome 19S subunit Rpn11. A derivative of 8TQ, capzimin, shows >5-fold selectivity for Rpn11 over the related JAMM proteases and >2 logs selectivity over several other metalloenzymes. Capzimin stabilized proteasome substrates, induced an unfolded protein response, and blocked proliferation of cancer cells, including those resistant to bortezomib. Proteomic analysis revealed that capzimin stabilized a subset of polyubiquitinated substrates. Identification of capzimin offers an alternative path to develop proteasome inhibitors for cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2592225941,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and the risk of progression to steatohepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma have been identified as major public health concerns. We have demonstrated the feasibility and potential value of measuring liver fat content by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a large population in this study of 4,949 participants (aged 45–73 years) in the UK Biobank imaging enhancement. Despite requirements for only a single (≤3min) scan of each subject, liver fat was able to be measured as the MRI proton density fat fraction (PDFF) with an overall success rate of 96.4%. The overall hepatic fat distribution was centred between 1–2%, and was highly skewed towards higher fat content. The mean PDFF was 3.91%, and median 2.11%. Analysis of PDFF in conjunction with other data fields available from the UK Biobank Resource showed associations of increased liver fat with greater age, BMI, weight gain, high blood pressure and Type 2 diabetes. Subjects with BMI less than 25 kg/m2 had a low risk (5%) of high liver fat (PDFF > 5.5%), whereas in the higher BMI population (>30 kg/m2) the prevalence of high liver fat was approximately 1 in 3. These data suggest that population screening to identify people with high PDFF is possible and could be cost effective. MRI based PDFF is an effective method for this. Finally, although cross sectional, this study suggests the utility of the PDFF measurement within UK Biobank, particularly for applications to elucidating risk factors through associations with prospectively acquired data on clinical outcomes of liver diseases, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease."
https://openalex.org/W2593269879,"P53-binding protein 1 (53BP1) is a multi-functional double-strand break repair protein that is essential for class switch recombination in B lymphocytes and for sensitizing BRCA1-deficient tumours to poly-ADP-ribose polymerase-1 (PARP) inhibitors. Central to all 53BP1 activities is its recruitment to double-strand breaks via the interaction of the tandem Tudor domain with dimethylated lysine 20 of histone H4 (H4K20me2). Here we identify an uncharacterized protein, Tudor interacting repair regulator (TIRR), that directly binds the tandem Tudor domain and masks its H4K20me2 binding motif. Upon DNA damage, the protein kinase ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) phosphorylates 53BP1 and recruits RAP1-interacting factor 1 (RIF1) to dissociate the 53BP1-TIRR complex. However, overexpression of TIRR impedes 53BP1 function by blocking its localization to double-strand breaks. Depletion of TIRR destabilizes 53BP1 in the nuclear-soluble fraction and alters the double-strand break-induced protein complex centring 53BP1. These findings identify TIRR as a new factor that influences double-strand break repair using a unique mechanism of masking the histone methyl-lysine binding function of 53BP1."
https://openalex.org/W2592480134,"Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal cancer types. Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is an oncogenic protein overexpressed in pancreatic cancer, and EZH2 could be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. Although significant progress has been made toward understanding the function and deregulation of EZH2 in cancer cells, the posttranslational regulation of EZH2 in cancer cells is still unclear. F-box and WD repeat domain-containing 7 (FBW7) acts as a tumor suppressor by targeting multiple oncoprotein substrates for ubiquitination and degradation. Here we demonstrate that EZH2 is a bona fide substrate of FBW7 in pancreatic cancer cells. We provide evidence that the activated CDK5 kinase is involved in the EZH2 phosphorylation that is required for FBW7-mediated degradation. We further show that FBW7 suppresses EZH2 activity and inhibits tumor migration and invasion via degradation of EZH2 in pancreatic cancer cells. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry analysis revealed that expression of EZH2 protein negatively correlates with FBW7 protein levels in a cohort of human pancreatic cancer specimens. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that FBW7 is a novel E3 ligase of EZH2 that regulates the EZH2 protein level in pancreatic cancer and represents a viable strategy for effective treatment of pancreatic cancer.

https://openalex.org/W2593750454,"Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a difficult-to-treat recurrent condition in which health-associated lactobacilli are outnumbered by other anaerobic bacteria, such as Gardnerella vaginalis. Certain genotypes of G. vaginalis can produce sialidase, while others cannot. Sialidase is known to facilitate the destruction of the protective mucus layer on the vaginal epithelium by hydrolysis of sialic acid on the glycans of mucous membranes. This process possibly facilitates adhesion of bacterial cells on the epithelium since it has been linked with the development of biofilm in other pathogenic conditions. Although it has not been demonstrated yet, it is probable that G. vaginalis benefits from this mechanism by attaching to the vaginal epithelium to initiate biofilm development. In this study, using vaginal specimens of 120 women enrolled in the Ring Plus study, we assessed the association between the putative G. vaginalis sialidase A gene by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), the diagnosis of BV according to Nugent score, and the occurrence of a BV-associated biofilm dominated by G. vaginalis by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH). We detected the putative sialidase A gene in 75% of the G. vaginalis-positive vaginal specimens and found a strong association (p<0.001) between the presence of a G. vaginalis biofilm, the diagnosis of BV according to Nugent and the detection of high loads of the G. vaginalis sialidase A gene in the vaginal specimens. These results could redefine diagnosis of BV, and in addition might guide research for new treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2592307528,"Introduction Bipolar disorder (BD) is a chronic psychiatric disease which can take most different and unpredictable courses. It is accompanied by unspecific brainstructural changes and cognitive decline. The neurobiological underpinnings of these processes are still unclear. Emerging evidence suggests that tryptophan catabolites (TRYCATs), which involve all metabolites of tryptophan towards the kynurenine (KYN) branch, are involved in the etiology as well as in the course of BD. They are proposed to be mediators of immune-inflammation and neurodegeneration. In this study we measured the levels of KYN and its main catabolites consisting of the neurotoxic hydroxykynurenine (3-HK), the more neuroprotective kynurenic acid (KYNA) and anthranilic acid (AA) and evaluated the ratios between end-products and substrates as proxies for the specific enzymatic activity (3-HK/KYN, KYNA/KYN, AA/KYN) as well as 3-HK/KYNA as a proxy for neurotoxic vs. neuroprotective end-product relation in individuals with BD compared to healthy controls (HC). Methods We took peripheral TRYCAT blood levels of 143 euthymic to mild depressive BD patients and 101 HC. For statistical analyses MANCOVA’s controlled for age, sex, body mass index, cardiovascular disease and smoking were performed. Results The levels of KYNA (F = 5,579; p <.05) were reduced in BD compared to HC. The enzymatic activity of the kynurenine-3-monooxygenase (KMO) reflected by the 3-HK/KYN ratio was increased in BD individuals compared to HC (F = 5,394; p <.05). Additionally the ratio of 3-HK/KYNA was increased in individuals with BD compared to healthy controls (F = 11,357; p <.01). Discussion In conclusion our findings subserve the concept of KYN -pathway alterations in the pathophysiology of BD. We present evidence of increased breakdown towards the neurotoxic branch in KYN metabolism even in a euthymic to mild depressive state in BD. From literature we know that depression and mania are accompanied by inflammatory states which should be capable to produce an even greater imbalance due to activation of key enzymes in the neurotoxic direction of KYN -conversion. These processes could finally be involved in the development of unspecific brain structural changes and cognitive deficits which are prevalent in BD. Further research should focus on state dependent changes in TRYCATs and its relation to cognition, brain structure and staging parameters."
https://openalex.org/W2594634338,"A genuine understanding of human exocrine pancreas biology and pathobiology has been hampered by a lack of suitable preparations and reliance on rodent models employing dispersed acini preparations. We have developed an organotypic slice preparation of the normal portions of human pancreas obtained from cancer resections. The preparation was assessed for physiologic and pathologic responses to the cholinergic agonist carbachol (Cch) and cholecystokinin (CCK-8), including 1) amylase secretion, 2) exocytosis, 3) intracellular Ca2+ responses, 4) cytoplasmic autophagic vacuole formation, and 5) protease activation. Cch and CCK-8 both dose-dependently stimulated secretory responses from human pancreas slices similar to those previously observed in dispersed rodent acini. Confocal microscopy imaging showed that these responses were accounted for by efficient apical exocytosis at physiologic doses of both agonists and by apical blockade and redirection of exocytosis to the basolateral plasma membrane at supramaximal doses. The secretory responses and exocytotic events evoked by CCK-8 were mediated by CCK-A and not CCK-B receptors. Physiologic agonist doses evoked oscillatory Ca2+ increases across the acini. Supraphysiologic doses induced formation of cytoplasmic autophagic vacuoles and activation of proteases (trypsin, chymotrypsin). Maximal atropine pretreatment that completely blocked all the Cch-evoked responses did not affect any of the CCK-8-evoked responses, indicating that rather than acting on the nerves within the pancreas slice, CCK cellular actions directly affected human acinar cells.

New insights into the mechanisms of pancreatitis.Gastroenterology. 2009; 136: 2040-2044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Although both of these events of acinar cell injury could be evoked by supramaximal CCK-8 or carbachol stimulation of rodent pancreas, it has yet to be proven whether in human pancreas these events are also the cellular mechanisms of human pancreatitis. Recent reports showed that rodent pancreas can be prepared as thin pancreas slices (100–140 μm thick) cut by a microtome, where both exocrine and endocrine functions and cellular mechanisms remain intact (17Marciniak A.

Electrophysiological identification of mouse islet α-cells, from isolated single cells to in situ assessment within pancreas slices.Islets. 2011; 3: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). This more genuinely physiologic preparation of intact pancreatic tissue has advantages over the dispersed tissue models, acini, or isolated islets, which require damaging enzymatic and mechanical dissociation. These dispersed pancreatic tissue preparations could perturb exocrine and endocrine cell biology that may confound the results derived from experiments employing these preparations (17Marciniak A. Selck C. Friedrich B. Speier S. Mouse pancreas tissue culture facilitates long-term studies of exocrine and endocrine cell physiology in situ.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8: e78706Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 18Huang Y.-C.

Electrophysiological identification of mouse islet α-cells, from isolated single cells to in situ assessment within pancreas slices.Islets. 2011; 3: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Conceivably, these preparations could damage the small amount of CCK receptors present on the plasma membrane surface of the human pancreatic acinar cells. In this work we have employed the slice preparation on normal human pancreas obtained after surgical resections of pancreatic cancer. We show the human exocrine pancreas displayed a typical concentration-dependent amylase secretion, acinar exocytosis, and intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) rise and supramaximal agonist stimulation-evoked cytoplasmic vacuole formation and protease activation. Of note, all these events were evoked by carbachol and also CCK-8 stimulation, the latter via pancreatic acinar CCK-A receptors and not mediated by neuronal input. The latter supports a direct CCK-8 signaling pathway for secretion and pancreatitis in the human pancreatic acinar cell. We first examined cholinergic stimulation with carbachol, where physiologic concentrations (1–10 μmol/liter) stimulated amylase release and supraphysiologic concentrations caused concentration-dependent inhibition of secretion from maximal levels (Fig. 1A). This response from human pancreas slices is similar to what is evoked at the same concentrations from rodent dispersed acini (19Cosen-Binker L.I. Lam P.P. Binker M.G. Gaisano H.Y. Alcohol-induced protein kinase C-alpha phosphorylation of Munc18c in carbachol-stimulated acini causes basolateral exocytosis.Gastroenterology. 2007; 132: 1527-1545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We also observed a similar CCK-8-stimulated release at physiologic concentrations of 1–10 pmol/liter with further increase at maximal CCK-8 (100 pmol/liter), and further supramaximal increases in concentrations also led to concentration-dependent reduction of secretion (Fig. 1B). This dose response from human pancreas slices is also similar to rodent dispersed acini studies (11Gaisano H.Y. Lutz M.P. Leser J. Sheu L. Lynch G. Tang L. Tamori Y. Trimble W.S. Salapatek A.M. Supramaximal cholecystokinin displaces Munc18c from the pancreatic acinar basal surface, redirecting apical exocytosis to the basal membrane.J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1597-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, this CCK-8 stimulated response could have been derived from vagal neural innervations, which would be intact within the fresh pancreas slice. We first determined the optimal dose of the cholinergic receptor antagonist, atropine that blocked maximal Cch (10 μmol/liter)-stimulated release to near basal levels, which is 50 μmol/liter atropine (Fig. 1C). 50 μmol/liter atropine had no effect on maximal CCK-8 (100 pmol/liter)-stimulated amylase release (Fig. 1D), indicating that CCK-8 acted directly on the acinar cells. We previously showed that both carbachol and CCK-8 evoke apical exocytosis at physiologic concentrations and at supramaximal concentrations cause apical blockade and redirection of exocytosis to the basolateral plasma membrane (11Gaisano H.Y.

Maximal Cch (10 μmol/liter) likewise stimulated apical exocytosis in the human pancreas slices (Fig. 2A, representative of 6 experiments) shown as FM1–43 fluorescence occupying an increasing area in the apical pole of an acinus, with no fluorescence hotspots in the basolateral regions. In contrast, supramaximal Cch (2 mmol/liter) evoked exocytosis in several basolateral regions of the acinus (white arrows in Fig. 2B, representative of 5 experiments) with very little apical exocytosis, the latter indicating apical blockade. The fluorescence trace analyses of Fig. 2, A and B, are shown respectively in Fig. 2, C and D. On expanded views of a region with a large amount of basolateral exocytosis (series of bottom images in Fig. 2B), we observed an initial two exocytotic events progressing to four and then dispersion of fluorescence from the four (last image) into the interstitial space indicating emptying of zymogen granule contents. We next confirmed that the CCK-8-mediated apical exocytosis is a direct effect of CCK-8 on the human pancreatic acinar cells and not due to indirect effects of CCK-8 on releasing acetylcholine from vagal neurons or stellate cells (21Phillips P.A. Yang L. Shulkes A. Vonlaufen A. Poljak A. Bustamante S. Warren A. Xu Z. Guilhaus M. Pirola R. Apte M.V. Wilson J.S.

Apical exocytosis by maximal Cch stimulation (Fig. 3A, top images) was completely blocked by 50 μmol/liter atropine (Fig. 3A, bottom images). In contrast, maximal CCK-8 evoked exocytosis (Fig. 3B, top images) was unaffected by 50 μmol/liter atropine (Fig. 3B, middle images). CCK-8-stimulated apical exocytosis was also unaffected by further addition of 100 nmol/liter tetrodotoxin (TTX) (4Murphy J.A. Criddle D.N. Sherwood M. Chvanov M. Mukherjee R. McLaughlin E. Booth D.

We show very similar results with Cch (5 μmol/liter, Fig. 4A) and CCK-8 (20 pmol/liter, Fig. 4C) stimulation of the human pancreas slices. Whereas Cch-evoked [Ca2+]i oscillations of the acini were completely blocked by atropine (50 μmole/liter) pretreatment (Fig. 4B), CCK-8-evoked [Ca2+]i oscillations were unaffected either by atropine (50 μmol/liter) pretreatment (Fig. 4D) or atropine (50 μmol/liter) plus tetrodotoxin (100 nmol/liter) pretreatment (Fig. 4E). This is depicted in the [Ca2+]i fluorescence traces on the right of each set of images whereby the maximal [Ca2+]i fluorescence peaks are correspondingly indicated by the numbers. These results indicate that [Ca2+]i responses between adjacent acinar cells are relatively synchronized or coupled. Currently, we do not yet have the microscopy resolution capability to track with higher spatiotemporal resolution single acinar [Ca2+]i kinetics of single cells within the slice.

Phalloidin-labeled F-actin (left panels) marked the acinus ductal lumen and also the basolateral plasma membrane, whereas ZO-1 (right panels) is concentrated in the acinar junctional complexes that marked out the acini apical lumen. CCK-A receptors were notably present on the acinar basal plasma membrane with small amounts also on the lateral plasma membrane. CCK-A receptor antagonist devazepide (also called L364, 718) dose-dependently (10−8-10−5 mmol/liter) (25González-Puga C. García-Navarro A. Escames G. León J. López-Cantarero M. Ros E. Acuña-Castroviejo D. Selective CCK-A but not CCK-B receptor antagonists inhibit HT-29 cell proliferation: synergism with pharmacological levels of melatonin.J. Pineal. Res. 2005; 39: 243-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) blocked maximal CCK-8-stimulated amylase secretion (Fig. 5B, left). In contrast, increasing concentrations of CCK-B receptor antagonist L365,240 (10−9-10−6 mmol/liter) (26Tang C. Biemond I. Lamers C.B. Cholecystokinin receptors in human pancreas and gallbladder muscle: a comparative study.Gastroenterology. 1996; 111: 1621-1626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), had no effect on CCK-8-stimulated secretion (Fig. 5B, right). To confirm, maximal CCK-8-evoked apical exocytosis was also effectively blocked by maximal dose (10−5 mmol/liter) CCK-A receptor antagonist devazepide (Fig. 5C, upper images) but was not blocked by maximal dose (10−6 mmol/liter) CCK-B receptor antagonist L365,240 (Fig. 5C, bottom images). TTX was present in all these secretory and exocytotic studies to negate any contribution from neurons or stellate cells present in the intact pancreatic tissue slice. Accumulation of large cytoplasmic vacuoles in the acinar cells is an early feature of pancreatitis that can be induced by supramaximal Cch or CCK-8 in vivo or in vitro (13Niederau C. Grendell J.H.

It has been postulated that pancreatic enzymes (i.e. trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen) are prematurely activated within these vacuoles leading to pancreatitis (14Saluja A.K. Donovan E.A. Yamanaka K.

U.S.A. 2007; 104: 5674-5679Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The biogenesis of cytoplasmic vacuole formation and protease activation were recently elucidated to be at least in part due to impairment of autophagy (27Mareninova O.A. Hermann K. French S.W. O'Konski M.S. Pandol S.J. Webster P. Erickson A.H. Katunuma N. Gorelick F.S. Gukovsky I. Gukovskaya A.S. Impaired autophagic flux mediates acinar cell vacuole formation and trypsinogen activation in rodent models of acute pancreatitis.J. Clin. Invest. 2009; 119: 3340-3355PubMed Google Scholar). A marker of autophagic activity is LC3A to LC3B conversion and its accumulation within the large autophagic vacuoles (27Mareninova O.A. Hermann K. French S.W. O'Konski M.S. Pandol S.J. Webster P. Erickson A.H. Katunuma N. Gorelick F.S. Gukovsky I. Gukovskaya A.S. Impaired autophagic flux mediates acinar cell vacuole formation and trypsinogen activation in rodent models of acute pancreatitis.J. Clin. Invest. 2009; 119: 3340-3355PubMed Google Scholar). We next examined whether these events would take place in human pancreatic acinar cells within the pancreas slices. Indeed, supramaximal Cch (2 mmol/liter, Fig. 6A) and CCK-8 (10 nmol/liter, Fig. 6B) induced large vacuole formation in the acini of the human pancreas slices that were detected by the LC3B antibody. Atropine pretreatment blocked the formation of these LC3B-marked vacuoles induced by 2 mmol/liter Cch (Fig. 6A) but not 10 nmol/liter CCK-8. Neither maximal Cch (10 μmol/liter, Fig. 6A) nor CCK-8 (100 pmol/liter, Fig. 6B) induced cytoplasmic vacuole formation. For quantitative analysis, we measured the size (Fig. 6C) and density (Fig. 6D) of the vacuoles, which confirmed the above findings. To track in real time the formation of these autophagic vacuoles, we transduced human pancreas slices with adenovirus- LC3B-GFP (Fig. 7). With supramaximal CCK-8 (10 nmol/liter) stimulation, a time-dependent (over 20 min) increase in formation of discrete autophagic hotspots in the acinar cells (Fig. 7A) was observed. Here, the initial diffused LC3B-GFP fluorescence (box 1) progressively accumulated into discrete vacuolar structures (boxes 2 and 3). This increased formation of discrete autophagic hotspots was not observed in maximal CCK-8 (100 pmol/liter CCK-8)-stimulated human slices (Fig. 7B) or in unstimulated slices (data not shown). In fact, the initially weak and diffused fluorescence (box 1) became more dispersed (boxes 2 and 3) or the loss of fluoresce"
https://openalex.org/W2594714106,"The insect central complex (CX) is an enigmatic structure whose computational function has evaded inquiry, but has been implicated in a wide range of behaviours. Recent experimental evidence from the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) and the cockroach (Blaberus discoidalis) has demonstrated the existence of neural activity corresponding to the animal’s orientation within a virtual arena (a neural ‘compass’), and this provides an insight into one component of the CX structure. There are two key features of the compass activity: an offset between the angle represented by the compass and the true angular position of visual features in the arena, and the remapping of the 270° visual arena onto an entire circle of neurons in the compass. Here we present a computational model which can reproduce this experimental evidence in detail, and predicts the computational mechanisms that underlie the data. We predict that both the offset and remapping of the fly’s orientation onto the neural compass can be explained by plasticity in the synaptic weights between segments of the visual field and the neurons representing orientation. Furthermore, we predict that this learning is reliant on the existence of neural pathways that detect rotational motion across the whole visual field and uses this rotation signal to drive the rotation of activity in a neural ring attractor. Our model also reproduces the ‘transitioning’ between visual landmarks seen when rotationally symmetric landmarks are presented. This model can provide the basis for further investigation into the role of the central complex, which promises to be a key structure for understanding insect behaviour, as well as suggesting approaches towards creating fully autonomous robotic agents."

To determine how eIF4G recruits the mRNA, three eIF4G deletion mutants were constructed: (i) eIF4G601–1196, containing amino acids 601–1196, including the putative BTE-binding region, and binding domains for eIF4E, eIF4A, and eIF4B; (ii) eIF4G601–1488, which contains an additional C-terminal eIF4A-binding domain; and (iii) eIF4G742–1196, which lacks the eIF4E-binding site. eIF4G601–1196 binds BTE tightly and supports efficient translation. The helicase complex, consisting of eIF4A, eIF4B, and ATP, stimulated BTE binding with eIF4G601–1196 but not eIF4G601–1488, suggesting that the eIF4A binding domains may serve a regulatory role, with the C-terminal binding site having negative effects. eIF4E binding to eIF4G601–1196 induced a conformational change, significantly increasing the binding affinity to BTE. A comparison of the binding of eIF4G deletion mutants with BTEs containing mutations showed a general correlation between binding affinity and ability to facilitate translation. In summary, these results reveal a new role for the helicase complex in 3′ cap-independent translation element-mediated translation and show that the functional core domain of eIF4G plus an adjacent probable RNA-binding domain mediate translation initiation.

A comparison of the binding of eIF4G deletion mutants with BTEs containing mutations showed a general correlation between binding affinity and ability to facilitate translation. In summary, these results reveal a new role for the helicase complex in 3′ cap-independent translation element-mediated translation and show that the functional core domain of eIF4G plus an adjacent probable RNA-binding domain mediate translation initiation. Cap recognition is the rate-limiting step for canonical eukaryotic translation (1Jackson R.J. Hellen C.U. Pestova T.V.

Many viral RNAs lack both the 5′ cap structure and the poly(A) tail, utilizing different mechanisms to recruit ribosomes efficiently (13Walsh D. Mohr I. Viral subversion of the host protein synthesis machinery.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2011; 9: 860-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). To compensate for the absence of a 5′ cap, many plant viruses contain a cap-independent translation enhancer element, usually located in the 3′-UTR of the viral mRNA (14Kneller E.L.

Tinkering with translation: protein synthesis in virus-infected cells.Cold Spring Harb Perspect Biol. 2013; 5: a012351Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). One of the well characterized 3′ cap-independent translation elements is the barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV)-like cap-independent translation element (BTE) (16Guo L. Allen E. Miller W.A.

Rasochová L. Barley yellow dwarf viruses.Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 1997; 35: 167-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). A BTE is present in the 3′-UTRs of all members of the Luteovirus, Dianthovirus, Alphanecrovirus, and Betanecrovirus genera and in some members of genus Umbravirus (18Simon A.E. Miller W.A. 3′ cap-independent translation enhancers of plant viruses.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2013; 67: 21-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The 5677-nucleotide (nt), positive sense RNA genome of BYDV has no 5′ cap or poly(A) tail. Its 3′ BTE (nt 4809–4918) is required for efficient translation and thus for viral replication (16Guo L.

Structure and function of a cap-independent translation element that functions in either the 3′ or the 5′ untranslated region.RNA. 2000; 6: 1808-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The BYDV BTE forms a cruciform secondary structure with three major stem loops (SL-I, SL-II, and SL-III) and flanked by stem IV, which connects to the rest of the viral RNA (see Fig. 1A). Each structured stem loop is necessary for cap-independent translation (16Guo L. Allen E. Miller W.A.

The 3′ BTE specifically interacts with eIF4G or eIF4F in wheat germ extract (WGE), and BTE-mediated translation is primarily eIF4G-dependent (21Kraft J.J. Treder K. Peterson M.S. Miller W.A.

Wheat expresses two eIF4G isoforms: eIF4G and eIFiso4G, which are different in sequence and size (28Gallie D.R. Browning K.S. eIF4G functionally differs from eIFiso4G in promoting internal initiation, cap-independent translation, and translation of structured mRNAs.J. Biol.

Eukaryotic initiation factor 4B and the poly(A)-binding protein bind eIF4G competitively.Translation. 2013; 1: e24038Crossref Google Scholar). BYDV prefers to utilize eIF4G for the viral mRNA translation (26Treder K. Kneller E.L. Allen E.M. Wang Z. Browning K.S. Miller W.A. The 3′ cap-independent translation element of barley yellow dwarf virus binds eIF4F via the eIF4G subunit to initiate translation.RNA. 2008; 14: 134-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Wheat eIF4G is a 160-kDa protein with 1488 amino acid residues (28Gallie D.R. Browning K.S. eIF4G functionally differs from eIFiso4G in promoting internal initiation, cap-independent translation, and translation of structured mRNAs.J. Biol.

Eukaryotic initiation factor 4B and the poly(A)-binding protein bind eIF4G competitively.Translation. 2013; 1: e24038Crossref Google Scholar). eIF4G contains one binding site for eIF4E (residues 710–721) and two binding regions for eIF4A, eIF4B, and PAPB (see Fig. 1B). The first eIF4B or PAPB binding site is near the N terminus followed by the eIF4E binding site in the central region and two HEAT domains located in the C-terminal region, which overlap with two eIF4A binding sites (29Cheng S. Gallie D.R. Eukaryotic initiation factor 4B and the poly(A)-binding protein bind eIF4G competitively.Translation. 2013; 1: e24038Crossref Google Scholar). Compared with human eIF4G, wheat eIF4G does not have the third HEAT domain (30Marintchev A.

Human eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4G (eIF4G) recruits mnk1 to phosphorylate eIF4E.EMBO J. 1999; 18: 270-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). The region between amino acid residues 766 and 836 of eIF4G is required for binding to BTE and facilitating BTE-mediated translation (21Kraft J.J. Treder K. Peterson M.S. Miller W.A. Cation-dependent folding of 3′ cap-independent translation elements facilitates interaction of a 17-nucleotide conserved sequence with eIF4G.Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41: 3398-3413Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Other translation initiation factors also participate in the interaction between eIF4G, 40S ribosomal subunits, and BTE. Although eIF4E, the cap-binding protein, does not interact directly with the BTE, it stimulates eIF4G-dependent BTE-mediated translation (26Treder K. Kneller E.L. Allen E.M. Wang Z. Browning K.S.

The 3′ cap-independent translation element of barley yellow dwarf virus binds eIF4F via the eIF4G subunit to initiate translation.RNA. 2008; 14: 134-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Unlike human eIF4A, which is a subunit of eIF4F, plant eIF4A does not co-purify with the eIF4G-eIF4E complex and thus is not considered part of eIF4F (32Gingras A.C. Raught B.

Addition of the helicase complex (eIF4F-eIF4A-eIF4B-ATP) significantly increases the binding affinity between the BTE and the 40S ribosomal subunit (25Sharma S.D. Kraft J.J. Miller W.A. Goss D.J.

The functions of different eIF4G domains in the interaction with BTE are still unknown, as is the influence of other translation initiation factors on this binding. To answer these questions, here we investigate the translational activities and binding affinities of the following eIF4G deletion mutants, with numbering indicating positions of amino acids included in the protein: eIF4G601–1196, eIF4G742–1196, and eIF4G601–1488. Because of the instability of full-length eIF4G, previous studies have used the C-terminal two-thirds of eIF4G (eIF4G587–1488 and eIF4G601–1488), which facilitate BTE-mediated translation as efficiently as full-length eIF4G (21Kraft J.J. Treder K. Peterson M.S. Miller W.A.

Gallie D.R. Eukaryotic initiation factor 4B and the poly(A)-binding protein bind eIF4G competitively.Translation. 2013; 1: e24038Crossref Google Scholar). Here we find that eIF4G601–1196 (containing eIF4G amino acid residues 601–1196) acts as a core domain both in translation and in binding to BTE. eIF4A, eIF4B, and eIF4E, to different extents, stimulated the eIF4G-dependent BTE-mediated translation. The helicase complex eIF4A-eIF4B-ATP and eIF4E also contribute to the tight binding between eIF4G and BTE, mainly through protein-protein interactions, whereas PABP had little effect on binding. Previous studies showed that the C-terminal eIF4G fragment (eIF4G766–1488) functioned as well as full-length eIF4G in translation assays and could rescue BTE-mediated translation in eIF4F-depleted wheat germ extract (21Kraft J.J.

In this study, the translation stimulation efficiencies of three eIF4G deletion mutants were determined. eIF4G601–1196 is the eIF4G fragment containing amino acid residues 601–1196, including the eIF4E binding site (aa 710–721), one eIF4A binding site, one eIF4B binding site, and a region required for BTE binding (aa 766–863). eIF4G601–1488 is a longer fragment with one additional C-terminal eIF4A binding domain (aa 1300–1488); eIF4G742–1196 is a shorter deletion mutant lacking the eIF4E binding sequence, as well as the second eIF4A site (Fig. 1B). BlucB is a translation reporter construct in which the firefly luciferase reporter gene is flanked by the BYDV 5′- and 3′-UTRs (16Guo L. Allen E. Miller W.A.

The 3′-UTR contains the BTE. eIF4F-depleted wheat germ extract was used as the in vitro translation system (28Gallie D.R. Browning K.S. eIF4G functionally differs from eIFiso4G in promoting internal initiation, cap-independent translation, and translation of structured mRNAs.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36951-36960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Western blot assays showed that both eIF4G and eIFiso4G were reduced to undetectable levels in the eIF4F-depleted wheat germ extract; eIF4E and eIFiso4E were reduced to a slightly smaller extent than eIF4G and eIFiso4G (Fig. 2A). eIF4A and eIF4B levels were also partially reduced in eIF4F-depleted wheat germ extracts because they bind eIF4F (Fig. 2A). As expected, BlucB showed significantly reduced expression in eIF4F-depleted wheat germ extract as compared with the untreated wheat germ extract. The addition of recombinant eIF4F partially rescued translation of uncapped BlucB RNA in the eIF4F-depleted wheat germ extract (26Treder K. Kneller E.L. Allen E.M. Wang Z. Browning K.S. Miller W.A. The 3′ cap-independent translation element of barley yellow dwarf virus binds eIF4F via the eIF4G subunit to initiate translation.RNA. 2008; 14: 134-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The luciferase activity obtained after translation of 20 nm BlucB RNA for 90 min in the presence of 60 nm eIF4F added to the eIF4F-depleted wheat germ extract was defined as 100%. Additional recombinant eIF4F did not increase the translation rescue. After 90 min of translation, 60 nm recombinant eIF4F rescued BlucB translation to ∼27% of the level in non-depleted WGE. Because eIF4A and eIF4B are also partially depleted when eIF4F is reduced, varying amounts of additional eIF4A and eIF4B were added to the lysate. Optimum translation occurred with the addition of eIF4A (1.8 μm) and eIF4B (600 nm) with eIF4F, which restored BlucB translation to 79% of the non-depleted WGE levels. 60 nm eIF4G601–1196 restored BlucB translation to 66 ± 5% of the level obtained with eIF4F (Fig. 2B). eIF4G601–1488, which includes one additional eIF4A binding site in the C-terminal region, had similar translation stimulating ability, restoring BlucB translation to 72 ± 4% of the eIF4F level, whereas the shorter fragment, eIF4G742–1196, restored translation to 63 ± 10% (Fig. 2B). After a 40-min reaction, the BlucB translation rescued by eIF4G mutants was close to saturation (supplemental Fig. S1). eIF4G601–1196 consistently provided greater translation stimulation than the other two fragments in the first 40 min of translation (Fig. 2C). Previous results showed that eIF4G alone facilitated translation of BlucB to 75% of the eIF4F level (26Treder K. Kneller E.L. Allen E.M. Wang Z. Browning K.S. Miller W.A. The 3′ cap-independent translation element of barley yellow dwarf virus binds eIF4F via the eIF4G subunit to initiate translation.RNA. 2008; 14: 134-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The eIF4G fragment lacking the eIF4E binding site (eIF4G742–1196) restored BlucB translation to 63%±10% of level obtained with eIF4F (Fig. 2B), confirming that the eIF4E-interacting region of eIF4G is unnecessary. All three eIF4G deletion mutants were competent for restoring BTE-mediated translation, indicating that only the core region (aa 883–1196) and the upstream RNA binding motif (aa 766–863) are essential (Fig. 1B). Previously we correlated eIF4F binding affinity with translational efficiency (27Banerjee B. Goss D.J.

Chem. 2014; 289: 4286-4294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). To determine whether the mutants had affinity differences, fluorescein-labeled BTE was titrated with each of the eIF4G mutants (protein fluorescence quenching titrations revealed that fluorophore-labeled BTE and non-labeled BTE have the same binding affinities to eIF4Gs). The anisotropy changes of labeled BTE during titration were used to determine the equilibrium dissociation constant of the RNA-protein binding. The equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) for binding to BTE by eIF4G601–1196 (40 ± 4 nm) (Table 1 and Fig. 3) was less (tighter binding) than the KD of BTE binding by full-length eIF4G (177 ± 10 nm, determined by filter binding assay) (21Kraft J.J. Treder K. Peterson M.S. Miller W.A. Cation-dependent folding of 3′ cap-independent translation elements facilitates interaction of a 17-nucleotide conserved sequence with eIF4G.Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41: 3398-3413Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) or by eIF4G601–1488 (KD = 68 ± 5 nm). eIF4G742–1196, which lacks the eIF4E binding region, had a weaker binding affinity to the BTE (KD 91 ± 12 nm) compared with other two eIF4G deletion mutants (Table 1 and Fig. 3). These results demonstrate that the N- and C-terminal regions of eIF4G are not required for binding to BTE. Unlike the small differences in translation efficiency mediated by the three eIF4G mutants, the binding affinities of the three eIF4G mutants to the BTE are robust but quite different.TABLE 1Equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) for BTE with eIF4G mutantsBTE-eIF4G mutantsKD+ 4A 4B ATP+ 4A 4B ADPPNP+ 4A 4B ATP + PABP+ 4A 4B ADPPNP + PABPnmBTE·eIF4G601–119640 ± 413 ± 329 ± 111 ± 426 ± 3BTE·eIF4G601–1196·4E6.8 ± 1.54.6 ± 0.59.0 ± 1.64.4 ± 1.88.6 ± 2.4BTE·eIF742–119691 ± 1259 ± 576 ± 255 ± 370 ± 2BTE·eIF4G742–1196·4E101 ± 264 ± 381 ± 461 ± 279 ± 5BTE·eIF4G601–148868 ± 558 ± 1NA54 ± 2NABTE·eIF4G601–1488·4E28 ± 620 ± 1NA19 ± 3NA Open table in a new tab To investigate the effects of translation initiation factors eIF4A, eIF4B, and eIF4E on the interaction between eIF4G mutants and the BTE, the translation rescue abilities and the dissociation equilibrium constants were measured. Wheat eIF4A (45 kDa) exhibits ATPase hydrolysis activity and RNA helicase activity when combined with eIF4B and ATP. The helicase complex (eIF4A-eIF4B-ATP) in the presence of eIF4G can unwind double-stranded RNA (34Rogers Jr., G.W. Richter N.J. Merrick W.C.

When eIF4A and eIF4B were added along with eIF4F or eIF4G mutants into the eIF4F-depleted WGE, BlucB translation was at least double the level obtained in the absence of eIF4A and eIF4B after 40 min (Fig. 2D). Additional eIF4A and eIF4B had stronger effects on translation in the presence of eIF4G601–1196 and eIF4G742–1196 than in the presence of eIF4G601–1488. Supplementation of additional eIF4A and eIF4B increased both eIF4G601–1196- and eIF4G742–1196-mediated translation of BlucB ∼2.8 ± 0.05- and 3.1 ± 0.06-fold, respectively, at 40 min of in vitro translation, whereas for eIF4G601–1488 the increase was 2.6 ± 0.01-fold (Fig. 2D). At 60 min of translation, the difference of eIF4A and eIF4B effects was larger. With additional eIF4A and eIF4B, both eIF4G601-1196- and eIF4G742–1196-mediated BTE translation increased to ∼3.5 ± 0.1- and 3.6 ± 0.08-fold, respectively, whereas for eIF4G601–1488 the increase was 2.7 ± 0.05-fold (supplemental Fig. S1). The eIF4A-directed helicase complex (eIF4A-eIF4B-ATP) also had effects on the binding between eIF4G mutants and BTE. The helicase complex increased the binding affinity between BTE and eIF4G601–1196 by ∼3-fold (KD reduced from 40 ± 4 to 13 ± 3 nm). The helicase complex had a similar effect on eIF4G742–1196 binding to BTE, which has the central eIF4A binding domain but lacks the eIF4E binding region (Table 1). Like the translation data, eIF4A and eIF4B had less influence on the eIF4G mutant with two eIF4A binding domains than the mutants with one eIF4A binding domain. eIF4G601–1488, when incubated with helicase complex, did not show a similar increase in binding affinity, suggesting that the second eIF4A binding site on eIF4G counteracted the helicase complex effect on the interaction between the first eIF4A binding domain of eIF4G and BTE (Table 1), whereas the addition of PAPB in the presence of eIF4A, eIF4B, and ATP showed no significant effect on BTE binding (Table 1). Neither eIF4A nor eIF4B bound to the BTE in the absence of other proteins (Fig. 3). The helicase complex could affect RNA unwinding and/or protein-protein interactions. To establish whether the increase in binding was due to helicase activity or protein interaction, a non-hydrolyzable ATP analog was used i"

Here, 56 LRR-RLK genes were identified in the Antarctic moss Pohlia nutans transcriptome, which were further classified into 11 subgroups based on their extracellular domain. Of them, PnLRR-RLK27 belongs to the LRR II subgroup and its expression was significantly induced by abiotic stresses. Subcellular localization analysis showed that PnLRR-RLK27 was a plasma membrane protein. The overexpression of PnLRR-RLK27 in Physcomitrella significantly enhanced the salinity and ABA tolerance in their gametophyte growth. Similarly, PnLRR-RLK27 heterologous expression in Arabidopsis increased the salinity and ABA tolerance in their seed germination and early root growth as well as the tolerance to oxidative stress. PnLRR-RLK27 overproduction in these transgenic plants increased the expression of salt stress/ABA-related genes. Furthermore, PnLRR-RLK27 increased the activities of reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavengers and reduced the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and ROS. Taken together, these results suggested that PnLRR-RLK27 as a signaling regulator confer abiotic stress response associated with the regulation of the stress- and ABA-mediated signaling network."

This study aims to remove internal nitrogen in sediment-water microcosms by coupling sediment microbial fuel cells (SMFCs) with submerged aquatic plants. Twelve tanks including four treatments in triplicates were designed: open-circuit (SMFC-o), closed-circuit (SMFC-c), aquatic plants with open-circuit (P-SMFC-o) and aquatic plants with closed-circuit (P-SMFC-c). The changes in the bio-electrochemical characteristics of the nitrogen levels in overlying water, pore water, sediments, and aquatic plants were documented to explain the migration and transformation pathways of internal nitrogen. The results showed that both electrogenesis and aquatic plants could facilitate the mineralization of organic nitrogen in sediments. In SMFC, electrogenesis promoted the release of ammonium from the pore water, followed by the accumulation of ammonium and nitrate in the overlying water. The increased redox potential of sediments due to electrogenesis also contributed to higher levels of nitrate in overlying water when nitrification in pore water was facilitated and denitrification at the sediment-water interface was inhibited. When the aquatic plants were introduced into the closed-circuit SMFC, the internal ammonium assimilation by aquatic plants was advanced by electrogenesis; nitrification in pore water and denitrification in sediments were also promoted. These processes might result in the maximum decrease of internal nitrogen with low nitrogen levels in the overlying water despite the lower power production. The P-SMFC-c reduced 8.1%, 16.2%, 24.7%, and 25.3% of internal total nitrogen compared to SMFC-o on the 55th, 82th, 136th, and 190th days, respectively. The smaller number of Nitrospira and the larger number of Bacillus and Pseudomonas on the anodes via high throughput sequencing may account for strong mineralization and denitrification in the sediments under closed-circuit. The coupled P-SMFC system has shown good potential for the efficient removal of internal nitrogen."

Mutations in AIRE cause a monogenic autoimmune disease called autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy. AIRE has been shown to promote DNA breaks via its interaction with topoisomerase 2 (TOP2). In this study, we investigated topoisomerase-induced DNA breaks and chromatin structural alterations in conjunction with AIRE-dependent gene expression. Using RNA sequencing, we found that inhibition of TOP2 religation activity by etoposide in AIRE-expressing cells had a synergistic effect on genes with low expression levels. AIRE-mediated transcription was not only enhanced by TOP2 inhibition but also by the TOP1 inhibitor camptothecin. The transcriptional activation was associated with structural rearrangements in chromatin, notably the accumulation of γH2AX and the exchange of histone H1 with HMGB1 at AIRE target gene promoters. In addition, we found the transcriptional up-regulation to co-occur with the chromatin structural changes within the genomic cluster of carcinoembryonic antigen-like cellular adhesion molecule genes. Overall, our results suggest that the presence of AIRE can trigger molecular events leading to an altered chromatin landscape and the enhanced transcription of low-expressed genes.

https://openalex.org/W2592014549,"Chromosomal region 17q12-q21 is associated with asthma and harbors regulatory polymorphisms that influence expression levels of all five protein-coding genes in the region: IKAROS family zinc finger 3 (Aiolos) (IKZF3), zona pellucida binding protein 2 (ZPBP2), ORMDL sphingolipid biosynthesis regulator 3 (ORMDL3), and gasdermins A and B (GSDMA, GSDMB). Furthermore, DNA methylation in this region has been implicated as a potential modifier of the genetic risk of asthma development. To further characterize the effect of DNA methylation, we examined the impact of treatment with DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) that causes DNA demethylation, on expression and promoter methylation of the five 17q12-q21 genes in the human airway epithelium cell line NuLi-1, embryonic kidney epithelium cell line 293T and human adenocarcinoma cell line MCF-7. 5-aza-dC treatment led to upregulation of expression of GSDMA in all three cell lines. ZPBP2 was upregulated in NuLi-1, but remained repressed in 293T and MCF-7 cells, whereas ORMDL3 was upregulated in 293T and MCF-7 cells, but not NuLi-1. Upregulation of ZPBP2 and GSDMA was accompanied by a decrease in promoter methylation. Moreover, 5-aza-dC treatment modified allelic expression of ZPBP2 and ORMDL3 suggesting that different alleles may respond differently to treatment. We also identified a polymorphic CTCF-binding site in intron 1 of ORMDL3 carrying a CG SNP rs4065275 and determined its methylation level. The site's methylation was unaffected by 5-aza-dC treatment in NuLi-1 cells. We conclude that modest changes (8-13%) in promoter methylation levels of ZPBP2 and GSDMA may cause substantial changes in RNA levels and that allelic expression of ZPBP2 and ORMDL3 is mediated by DNA methylation."

Although the proinflammatory and pronociceptive roles of BLT1 have been studied more intensively, the relevance of the BLT2 receptor in inflammation and especially in nociception is not fully understood. For BLT2, both pro- and anti-inflammatory effects have been described. For example, BLT2 is expressed in colon cryptic cells appears to protect against dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis, possibly by enhancing barrier function in epithelial cells of the colon (21.Iizuka Y. Okuno T. Saeki K. Uozaki H. Okada S. Misaka T. Sato T. Toh H. Fukayama M. Takeda N. Kita Y. Shimizu T. Nakamura M. Yokomizo T. Protective role of the leukotriene B4 receptor BLT2 in murine inflammatory colitis.FASEB J. 2010; 24: 4678-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Similarly, in the mouse model of ovalbumin-induced allergic airway disease, BLT2 has a protective role (22.Matsunaga Y. Fukuyama S. Okuno T. Sasaki F. Matsunobu T. Asai Y. Matsumoto K. Saeki K.

Leukotriene B4 receptor BLT2 negatively regulates allergic airway eosinophilia.FASEB J. 2013; 27: 3306-3314Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In contrast, BLT2-deficient mice have a reduced incidence and severity of disease in autoantibody-induced inflammatory arthritis, including protection from bone and cartilage loss (23.Mathis S.P.

Here, we describe that BLT1 and BLT2 are coexpressed in peripheral sensory neurons and that low concentrations of LTB4 sensitize TRPV1-mediated intracellular calcium increases through BLT1-induced PKC activation, whereas higher LTB4 concentrations desensitize TRPV1-mediated calcium increases through BLT2-induced calcineurin activation. Fittingly, in vivo selective activation of BLT2 caused strong antinociceptive effects on thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia. G-protein-coupled receptors play an important role in the modulation of the peripheral nociceptive system. To investigate which receptors are present in dorsal root ganglia, we performed a semiquantitative mRNA screen for 546 known G-protein-coupled receptors with RNA of DRGs from adult mice.

Open table in a new tab Previously it has been demonstrated in electrophysiological experiments with isolated membrane patches of sensory neurons that LTB4 acts at concentrations >10 μm as a weak agonist for TRPV1 (20.Hwang S.W. Cho H. Kwak J. Lee S.Y. Kang C.J. Jung J. Cho S. Min K.H. Suh Y.G. Kim D. Oh U. Direct activation of capsaicin receptors by products of lipoxygenases: endogenous capsaicin-like substances.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 6155-6160Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated in this study the impact of BLT1 and BLT2 activation on sensitization the ion channel TRPV1 in peripheral sensory neurons. To examine sensitization of TRPV1-mediated responses, calcium imaging experiments were performed with cultured DRG neurons from adult mice. Here, dorsal root ganglia neurons were first stimulated with capsaicin (200 nm) alone, followed by an incubation with LTB4 prior to a second capsaicin stimulation. Sensitization of TRPV1-mediated calcium increases by LTB4 was calculated as the ratio between the second peak (cells treated with LTB4 and capsaicin) and the first peak (cells stimulated with capsaicin alone). The second capsaicin stimulations was induced 10 min after the first to avoid a decrease of the second capsaicin response caused by desensitization of TRPV1 (24.Holland S. Coste O. Zhang D.D. Pierre S.C. Geisslinger G. Scholich K. The ubiquitin ligase MYCBP2 regulates transient receptor potential vanilloid receptor 1 (TRPV1) internalization through inhibition of p38 MAPK signaling.J.

Cho S. Min K.H. Suh Y.G. Kim D. Oh U. Direct activation of capsaicin receptors by products of lipoxygenases: endogenous capsaicin-like substances.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 6155-6160Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar), no elevation of intracellular calcium concentrations was observed during the incubation of LTB4 (Fig. 1A). However, preincubation with LTB4 significantly enhanced the capsaicin-stimulated calcium increases reaching a maximum with 100 nm LTB4 (Fig. 1, A and B). Surprisingly, the sensitizing effect disappeared when LTB4 concentrations were further increased (Fig. 1B). To investigate the potential involvement of BLT1 in this sensitization process, we first tested the effect of LTB4 on dorsal root ganglia cultures from BLT1-deficient mice and observed that neither 0.1 nor 1 μm LTB4 was able to sensitize TRPV1-mediated calcium increases in the absence of BLT1 (data not shown). Also, incubation with the BLT1 antagonist U75302 abolished the sensitizing effect of 100 nm LTB4 in dorsal root ganglia cultures from wild-type mice (Fig. 1, C and D). Because BLT1 is known to activate PKC signaling, we hypothesized that LTB4 may sensitize TRPV1 through PKC activation. Fittingly, the PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide (BIM) (Fig. 1, C and D) eliminated the sensitizing effect of LTB4. To test whether or not the sensitizing effect of LTB4 is restricted to TRPV1-expressing neurons, we tested TRPM8-positive neurons, which are an individual TRPV1-negative subgroup of nociceptors (25.Story G.M. Peier A.M. Reeve A.J. Eid S.R. Mosbacher J. Hricik T.R. Earley T.J. Hergarden A.C. Andersson D.A. Hwang S.W. McIntyre P. Jegla T. Bevan S. Patapoutian A. ANKTM1, a TRP-like channel expressed in nociceptive neurons, is activated by cold temperatures.Cell. 2003; 112: 819-829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1936) Google Scholar). Therefore, dorsal root ganglia neurons were stimulated twice with menthol (100 μm) and with 100 nm LTB4 or its vehicle prior to the second menthol stimulus. These two menthol stimuli were followed by a capsaicin stimulus (250 nm, 20 s) to ensure that menthol responders are TRPV1-negative. Interestingly, LTB4 was not able to sensitize TRPM8-mediated calcium increases (data not shown), suggesting that the sensitizing effect is limited to TRPV1-expressing neurons. Next, we injected 20 ng of LTB4 in the hind paw of adult mice and determined the thermal withdrawal thresholds in these mice. This dose has previously been shown to be sufficient to evoke a maximal mechanical allodynia in mice (8.Levine J.D. Lau W. Kwiat G. Goetzl E.J. Leukotriene B4 produces hyperalgesia that is dependent on polymorphonuclear leukocytes.Science. 1984; 225: 743-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 26.Sisignano M. Angioni C. Ferreiros N.

Synthesis of lipid mediators during UVB-induced inflammatory hyperalgesia in rats and mice.PLoS One. 2013; 8: e81228Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we observed a long-lasting decrease of the paw withdrawal thresholds after LTB4 injection (Fig. 2A), which is known to depend on the recruitment of neutrophils (8.Levine J.D. Lau W. Kwiat G. Goetzl E.J. Leukotriene B4 produces hyperalgesia that is dependent on polymorphonuclear leukocytes.Science. 1984; 225: 743-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Indeed, we found increased neutrophil numbers in the paw 2 h after LTB4 injection (Fig. 2B), whereas the number of macrophages (F4–80+) was not altered. Importantly, 1 h after LTB4 injection, before neutrophil recruitment occurs (Fig. 2B), wild-type but not BLT1-deficient mice reacted to LTB4 injection with a decrease of thermal withdrawal thresholds (Fig. 2C). Likewise, genetic deletion of TRPV1 prevented LTB4-induced thermal hyperalgesia at this early time point (Fig. 2D). Taken together, our data show that LTB4 sensitizes TRPV1-mediated calcium increases in sensory neurons and subsequently thermal hyperalgesia through BLT1. Because LTB4 sensitizes TRPV1-mediated calcium increases only in a very narrow concentration range and BLT1 has a higher affinity to LTB4 as compared with BLT2, we investigated whether or not activation of BLT2 is responsible for the decreased sensitization observed at higher LTB4 concentrations. The selective BLT2 agonist CAY10583 (6.Iizuka Y. Yokomizo T. Terawaki K. Komine M. Tamaki K. Shimizu T. Characterization of a mouse second leukotriene B4 receptor, mBLT2: BLT2-dependent ERK activation and cell migration of primary mouse keratinocytes.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24816-24823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) alone had no effect on TRPV1-mediated calcium increases in DRG cultures but abolished the LTB4-induced sensitization of TRPV1-mediated calcium increases (Fig. 3A). Fittingly, blockage of BLT2 by the BLT2 antagonist LY255283 increased sensitization of the TRPV1-mediated calcium increases at high (1 μm) LTB4 concentrations (Fig. 3B). To investigate whether or not BLT2 activation inhibits sensitization produced by other mediators in addition to LTB4, we tested the effect of the BLT2 agonist on the sensitization induced by bradykinin and a prostaglandin E2 receptor 4 (EP4) agonist. Notably, bradykinin induces TRPV1 sensitization through the PLC/PKCϵ pathway, similar to the one used by BLT1 (16.Cesare P. McNaughton P. A novel heat-activated current in nociceptive neurons and its sensitization by bradykinin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 15435-15439Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the BLT2-agonist CAY10583 abolished bradykinin-induced TRPV1 sensitization (Fig. 3C). Next, we tested whether or not BLT2 activation also affects PKA-mediated TRPV1 sensitization. Therefore we used EP4 activation, which induces TRPV1 sensitization through the cAMP/PKA pathway (27.Southall M.D. Vasko M.R. Prostaglandin receptor subtypes, EP3C and EP4, mediate the prostaglandin E2-induced cAMP production and sensitization of sensory neurons.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16083-16091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Incubation with the selective EP4 receptor agonist ONO-AE-329 (28.Moriyama T. Higashi T. Togashi K. Iida T. Segi E. Sugimoto Y. Tominaga T. Narumiya S. Tominaga M. Sensitization of TRPV1 by EP1 and IP reveals peripheral nociceptive mechanism of prostaglandins.Mol. Pain. 2005; 1: 3Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar) induced a robust sensitization of TRPV1-mediated calcium increases, which was abolished in presence of the BLT2 agonist (Fig. 3D). To investigate whether or not BLT2 desensitizes TRPV1-mediated calcium increases through the PKC pathway, we sensitized TRPV1 using 8-bromo-cAMP and found that PKC inhibition did not affect BLT2-induced desensitization of the TRPV1-mediated calcium increases (Fig. 4A). Notably, PKA- and PKC-mediated TRPV1 sensitization is based on TRPV1 phosphorylation (29.Winter Z. Buhala A. Ötvös F. Jósvay K. Vizler C. Dombi G. Szakonyi G. Oláh Z. Functionally important amino acid residues in the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) ion channel: an overview of the current mutational data.Mol. Pain. 2013; 9: 30Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), which can be reversed by protein phosphatase 2B (calcineurin) (17.Mohapatra D.P. Nau C.

Chem. 2005; 280: 13424-13432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Because of the unselective effect of BLT2 activation on PKA- and PKC-mediated TRPV1 sensitization, we hypothesized that the effect of BLT2 activation might be mediated by calcineurin. Therefore, we sensitized TRPV1-mediated calcium influx with a low LTB4 concentration (100 nm) in the absence or presence of the protein-phosphatase 2B inhibitors cyclosporin A and FK506 (tacrolimus) (30.Lizanecz E. Bagi Z. Pásztor E.T. Papp Z. Edes I. Kedei N. Blumberg P.M. Tóth A. Phosphorylation-dependent desensitization by anandamide of vanilloid receptor-1 (TRPV1) function in rat skeletal muscle arterioles and in Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing TRPV1.Mol.

Signal. 2009; 7: 25Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Both inhibitors were used at concentrations that had no effect on LTB4-induced sensitization of TRPV1-mediated calcium increases by itself. Both inhibitors completely abolished the BLT2-mediated desensitization (Fig. 4B), which strongly suggests that calcineurin mediates the BLT2-induced desensitization of the TRPV1-mediated calcium increase. Next, we tested whether or not BLT1 and BLT2 are expressed in sensory neurons in dorsal root ganglia. We found that BLT1 and BLT2 were expressed in CGRP- and IB4-positive cells, which represent peptidergic and non-peptidergic sensory neurons, respectively (Fig. 5, A and B).Figure 5BLT1 and BLT2 are expressed in sensory neurons.

We found that intraplantar application of the BLT2 agonist CAY10583 significantly increased thermal (Fig. 6A) but not mechanical paw withdrawal latencies (Fig. 6B). In accordance with the proposed TRPV1-desensitizing mechanism, we observed no effect of the BLT2 agonist on thermal withdrawal latencies in TRPV1-deficient mice (data not shown). Next, the effect of the BLT2 agonist CAY10583 on nociceptive behavior during peripheral inflammation was tested. Zymosan injection decreases thermal and mechanical withdrawal thresholds within 2–4 h. Afterward paw withdrawal thresholds returned gradually over the following 48 h to baseline level (Fig. 7A). We administered CAY10583 intraperitoneally 4 and 24 h after the zymosan injection and found that 5 and 10 mg/kg of CAY10583 significantly reduced thermal (Fig. 7A) and mechanical paw withdrawal latencies (Fig. 7B). Notably, TRPV1-mediated mechanical pain during inflammation involves indirect mechanisms such as mechanical stimulation-induced release of mediators from epithelial cells that subsequently act on nociceptors also activating TRPV1 (14.Gold M.S. Gebhart G.F. Nociceptor sensitization in pain pathogenesis.Nat. Med. 2010; 16: 1248-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). Accordingly, TRPV1-deficient mice did not exhibit zymosan-induced thermal hyperalgesia and had a reduced mechanical allodynia (Fig. 7, C and D). In accordance with our data showing that the BLT2-agonist reduces sensitization of TRPV1-mediated calcium increases, injection of the BLT2-agonist had no significant effect on zymosan-induced mechanical allodynia in TRPV1 knock-out mice (data not shown). Finally, we determined the endogenous LTB4 concentrations in the paw at the different time points after zymosan injection via LC-MS/MS. We found significantly increased LTB4 level early (1 and 2 h) after zymosan injection, which went back to baseline level 24 h after zymosan injection (Fig. 7E). Thus, the slightly stronger antinociceptive effect of the BLT2 agonist may be based on the low level of endogenous LTB4 in the paw at this time point. Taken together, the data show that BLT2 activation is able to decrease with a high efficacy nociceptive behavior during inflammatory pain. LTB4 is a common proinflammatory mediator that is released mainly by neutrophils at the site of inflammation. It is not only a powerful chemoattractant for neutrophils but has also reported to be able to sensitize nociceptors, thereby increasing nociception. In this regard it has been shown that C-polymodal nociceptors and C-mechanoheat nociceptors are sensitized by LTB4 (32.Martin H.A. Basbaum A.I. Goetzl E.J. Levine J.D. Leukotriene B4 decreases the mechanical and thermal thresholds of C-fiber nociceptors in the hairy skin of the rat.J. Neurophysiol. 1988; 60: 438-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). As consequence LTB4 lowers the average heat threshold from 45 °C by ∼10 °C and decreases mechanical thresholds by almost 80% (32.Mar"

Overexpression and hyperactivity of this signaling pathway is observed in various pathologic states, such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer, which highlights the importance of inhibiting apelin receptor (APJ); therefore, we developed a cell-based screening assay that uses fluorescence microscopy to identify APJ antagonists. This approach led us to identify the U.S. Food and Drug Administration–approved compound protamine—already used clinically after cardiac surgery—as an agent to bind to heparin and thereby reverse its anticlotting activity. Protamine displays a 390-nM affinity for APJ and behaves as a full antagonist with regard to G protein and β-arrestin–dependent intracellular signaling. Ex vivo and in vivo, protamine abolishes well-known apelin effects, such as angiogenesis, glucose tolerance, and vasodilatation. Remarkably, protamine antagonist activity is fully reversed by heparin treatment both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, our results demonstrate a new pharmacologic property of protamine—blockade of APJ—that could explain some adverse effects observed in protamine-treated patients. Moreover, our data reveal that the established antiangiogenic activity of protamine would rely on APJ antagonism.—Le Gonidec, S., Chaves-Almagro, C., Bai, Y., Kang, H.

https://openalex.org/W2593250722,"Elasmosaurid plesiosaurians were globally prolific marine reptiles that dominated the Mesozoic seas for over 70 million years. Their iconic body-plan incorporated an exceedingly long neck and small skull equipped with prominent intermeshing ‘fangs’. How this bizarre dental apparatus was employed in feeding is uncertain, but fossilized gut contents indicate a diverse diet of small pelagic vertebrates, cephalopods and epifaunal benthos. Here we report the first plesiosaurian tooth formation rates as a mechanism for servicing the functional dentition. Multiple dentine thin sections were taken through isolated elasmosaurid teeth from the Upper Cretaceous of Sweden. These specimens revealed an average of 950 daily incremental lines of von Ebner, and infer a remarkably protracted tooth formation cycle of about 2–3 years–other polyphyodont amniotes normally take ~1–2 years to form their teeth. Such delayed odontogenesis might reflect differences in crown length and function within an originally uneven tooth array. Indeed, slower replacement periodicity has been found to distinguish larger caniniform teeth in macrophagous pliosaurid plesiosaurians. However, the archetypal sauropterygian dental replacement system likely also imposed constraints via segregation of the developing tooth germs within discrete bony crypts; these partly resorbed to allow maturation of the replacement teeth within the primary alveoli after displacement of the functional crowns. Prolonged dental formation has otherwise been linked to tooth robustness and adaption for vigorous food processing. Conversely, elasmosaurids possessed narrow crowns with an elongate profile that denotes structural fragility. Their apparent predilection for easily subdued prey could thus have minimized this potential for damage, and was perhaps coupled with selective feeding strategies that ecologically optimized elasmosaurids towards more delicate middle trophic level aquatic predation."

Adenomatosis polyposis coli down-regulated 1 (APCDD1) has recently been identified as an inhibitor of Wnt signaling, a key regulator of adipogenic differentiation. Here we report a novel role for APCDD1 in adipogenic differentiation via repression of Wnt signaling and an epigenetic linkage between miR-130 and APCDD1 in DIO. APCDD1 expression was significantly up-regulated in mature adipocytes compared with undifferentiated preadipocytes in both human and mouse subcutaneous adipose tissues. siRNA-based silencing of APCDD1 in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes markedly increased the expression of Wnt signaling proteins (Wnt3a, Wnt5a, Wnt10b, LRP5, and β-catenin) and inhibited the expression of adipocyte differentiation markers (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ)) and lipid droplet accumulation, whereas adenovirus-mediated overexpression of APCDD1 enhanced adipogenic differentiation. Notably, DIO mice exhibited reduced APCDD1 expression and increased Wnt expression in both subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissues and impaired adipogenic differentiation in vitro. Mechanistically, we found that miR-130, whose expression is up-regulated in adipose tissues of DIO mice, could directly target the 3′-untranslated region of the APCDD1 gene. Furthermore, transfection of an miR-130 inhibitor in preadipocytes enhanced, whereas an miR-130 mimic blunted, adipogenic differentiation, suggesting that miR-130 contributes to impaired adipogenic differentiation during DIO by repressing APCDD1 expression. Finally, human subcutaneous adipose tissues isolated from obese individuals exhibited reduced expression of APCDD1, C/EBPα, and PPARγ compared with those from non-obese subjects. Taken together, these novel findings suggest that APCDD1 positively regulates adipogenic differentiation and that its down-regulation by miR-130 during DIO may contribute to impaired adipogenic differentiation and obesity-related metabolic disease.

https://openalex.org/W2592538365,"Obesity increases risk for liver toxicity by the anti-leukemic agent asparaginase, but the mechanism is unknown. Asparaginase activates the integrated stress response (ISR) via sensing amino acid depletion by the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2) kinase GCN2. The goal of this work was to discern the impact of obesity, alone versus alongside genetic disruption of the ISR, on mechanisms of liver protection during chronic asparaginase exposure in mice. Following diet-induced obesity, biochemical analysis of livers revealed that asparaginase provoked hepatic steatosis that coincided with activation of another eIF2 kinase PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), a major ISR transducer to ER stress. Genetic loss of Gcn2 intensified hepatic PERK activation to asparaginase, yet surprisingly, mRNA levels of key ISR gene targets such as Atf5 and Trib3 failed to increase. Instead, mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signal transduction was unleashed, and this coincided with liver dysfunction reflected by a failure to maintain hydrogen sulfide production or apolipoprotein B100 (ApoB100) expression. In contrast, obese mice lacking hepatic activating transcription factor 4 (Atf4) showed an exaggerated ISR and greater loss of endogenous hydrogen sulfide but normal inhibition of mTORC1 and maintenance of ApoB100 during asparaginase exposure. In both genetic mouse models, expression and phosphorylation of Sestrin2, an ATF4 gene target, was increased by asparaginase, suggesting mTORC1 inhibition during asparaginase exposure is not driven via eIF2-ATF4-Sestrin2. In conclusion, obesity promotes a maladaptive ISR during asparaginase exposure. GCN2 functions to repress mTORC1 activity and maintain ApoB100 protein levels independently of Atf4 expression, whereas hydrogen sulfide production is promoted via GCN2-ATF4 pathway."

However, the in vivo physiologic function of KIF5B in adipose tissue remains to be determined. In this study, adipose-specific Kif5b knockout (F-K5bKO) mice were generated using the Cre-LoxP strategy. F-K5bKO mice had similar body weights to controls fed on a standard chow diet. However, F-K5bKO mice had hyperlipidemia and significant glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. Deletion of Kif5b aggravated the deleterious impact of a high-fat diet (HFD) on body weight gain, hepatosteatosis, glucose tolerance, and systematic insulin sensitivity. These changes were accompanied by impaired insulin signaling, decreased secretion of adiponectin, and increased serum levels of leptin and proinflammatory adipokines. F-K5bKO mice fed on an HFD exhibited lower energy expenditure and thermogenic dysfunction as a result of whitening of brown adipose due to decreased mitochondria biogenesis and downregulation of key thermogenic gene expression. In conclusion, selective deletion of Kif5b in adipose tissue exacerbates HFD-induced obesity and its associated metabolic disorders, partly through a decrease in energy expenditure, dysregulation of adipokine secretion, and insulin signaling.—Cui, J., Pang, J., Lin, Y.-J., Gong, H., Wang, Z.-H., Li, Y.-X., Li, J., Wang, Z., Jiang, P., Dai, D.-P., Li, J., Cai, J.-P., Huang, J.-D., Zhang, T.-M.

https://openalex.org/W2592021428,"To maintain homeostasis, animals must ingest appropriate quantities, determined by their internal nutritional state, of suitable nutrients. In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, an amino acid deficit induces a specific appetite for amino acids and thus results in their increased consumption. Although multiple processes of physiology, metabolism, and behavior are under circadian control in many organisms, it is unclear whether the circadian clock also modulates such motivated behavior driven by an internal need. Differences in levels of amino acid consumption by flies between the light and dark phases of the day:night cycle were examined using a capillary feeder assay following amino acid deprivation. Female flies exhibited increased consumption of amino acids during the dark phase compared with the light phase. Investigation of mutants lacking a functional period gene (per0), a well-characterized clock gene in Drosophila, found no difference between the light and dark phases in amino acid consumption by per0 flies. Furthermore, increased consumption of amino acids during the dark phase was observed in mated but not in virgin females, which strongly suggested that mating is involved in the rhythmic modulation of amino acid intake. Egg production, which is induced by mating, did not affect the rhythmic change in amino acid consumption, although egg-laying behavior showed a per0-dependent change in rhythm. Elevated consumption of amino acids during the dark phase was partly induced by the action of a seminal protein, sex peptide (SP), on the sex peptide receptor (SPR) in females. Moreover, we showed that the increased consumption of amino acids during the dark phase is induced in mated females independently of their internal level of amino acids. These results suggest that a post-mating SP/SPR signal elevates amino acid consumption during the dark phase via the circadian clock."

However, there are few studies on sensory-based self-care aimed at stress management, self-esteem and subjective well-being in this group of professionals. Objective To assess the impact of a self-care intervention mediated by the senses on the stress levels, self-esteem and well-being of health professionals in a hospital environment. Methods A total of 93 health professionals participated in an unblinded clinical trial, randomized into four groups: 1) control (no intervention); 2) Monosensory—daily body moisturizing (DBM) with odorless cream; 3) Bisensory—DBM with scented cream; 4) Multisensory—DBM with scented cream associated with audiovisual material. Participants answered specific questionnaires to assess stress, self-esteem and well-being and cortisol samples were collected at baseline, 15 and 30 days following intervention, and at the 30-day follow-up. Results Self-care was characterized as neglected, with most participants reporting inadequate hours of sleep (74%), irregular physical activity (68%), and inadequate nutrition (45%). Compared to the other groups, the Bisensory group had lower stress on all three assessments (p = 0.017; 0.012; 0.036), a life satisfaction 8% higher at follow-up than at baseline (95% CI: 2% to 15%, p = 0.016), a 10% increase in positive affect (95% CI: 2% to 19%, p = 0.011) and a 12% reduction in negative affect (95% CI: 3% to 21% less, p = 0.014) after 30 days. The Multisensory group showed improvement in self-esteem (p = 0.012) and reduced cortisol (p = 0.036) after 30 days of intervention. The control group showed no changes in the variables studied, except for cortisol: an increase at the 15-day evaluation (denoting higher risk for stress, p = 0.009) and a reduction at follow-up (p = 0.028), which was nevertheless within normal levels.

Although the pluripotent cell population of mouse and human embryos can be cultured as embryonic stem cells, little is known about the pathways involved in formation of a bovine pluripotent cell population, nor how to maintain these cells in vitro. The objective of this study was to determine the transcriptomic profile related to bovine pluripotency. Therefore, in vitro derived embryos were cultured in various culture media that recently have been reported capable of maintaining the naïve pluripotent state of human embryonic cells. Gene expression profiles of embryos cultured in these media were compared using microarray analysis and quantitative RT-PCR. Compared to standard culture conditions, embryo culture in ‘naïve’ media reduced mRNA expression levels of the key pluripotency markers NANOG and POU5F1. A relatively high percentage of genes with differential expression levels were located on the X-chromosome. In addition, reduced XIST expression was detected in embryos cultured in naïve media and female embryos contained fewer cells with H3K27me3 foci, indicating a delay in X-chromosome inactivation. Whole embryos cultured in one of the media, 5iLA, could be maintained until 23 days post fertilization. Together these data indicate that ‘naïve’ conditions do not lead to altered expression of known genes involved in pluripotency. Interestingly, X-chromosome inactivation and development of bovine embryos were dependent on the culture conditions."

Tibetan chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a breed endemic to China that is distributed mainly on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. However, its origin has not been well characterized. In the present study, we sequenced partial mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region of 239 and 283 samples from Tibetan and Sichuan indigenous chickens, respectively. Incorporating 1091 published sequences, we constructed the matrilineal genealogy of Tibetan chickens to further document their domestication history. We found that the genetic structure of the mtDNA haplotypes of Tibetan chickens are dominated by seven major haplogroups (A-G). In addition, phylogenetic and network analyses showed that Tibetan chickens are not distinguishable from the indigenous chickens in surrounding areas. Furthermore, some clades of Tibetan chickens may have originated from game fowls. In summary, our results collectively indicated that Tibetan chickens may have diverged from indigenous chickens in the adjacent regions and hybridized with various chickens."

VAMP8−/− acini are resistant to secretory inhibition by supramaximal CCK-8, and despite a 4.5-fold increase in total cellular trypsinogen levels, are fully protected from intracellular trypsin accumulation and acinar damage.

Acute pancreatitis is an inflammatory disease of the exocrine pancreas thought to be initiated by premature activation of proteolytic zymogens (most notably trypsinogen) as a result of their aberrant mixing with lysosomal hydrolases (most notably cathepsin B (CatB)) in an acidified cellular compartment (2Lerch M.M.

Previous studies reported that VAMP8−/− mice are resistant to experimental pancreatitis induced by either 6 hourly injections of high concentrations of the cholecystokinin (CCK) analog cerulein (CR), or 6-week alcohol feeding followed by 5 hourly injections of the muscarinic agonist carbachol (7Cosen-Binker L.I.

The ethanol feeding study also reported reduced pancreatic and lung inflammation with modestly reduced active trypsin in pancreatic homogenates. Based on the results that acini prepared from VAMP8−/− mice show no basolateral ZG exocytosis when incubated in alcohol as occurs in WT, it was proposed that VAMP8-mediated basolateral exocytosis is the underlying mechanism of alcohol-related acute pancreatitis; however, other parameters of acinar damage were not reported (7Cosen-Binker L.I.

A common feature of acute experimental pancreatitis is a pronounced inhibition of digestive enzyme secretion. This is believed to be a key pathophysiological mechanism leading to intracellular zymogen activation (9Frossard J.-L. Steer M.L. Pastor C.M.

We recently reported that zymogen activation in response to supramaximal CCK-8, bile salts, or cigarette smoke toxin occurs as a consequence of enhanced EE to LE/lysosome trafficking when acinar secretion is inhibited. Reducing EE to LE trafficking by pharmacological or molecular approaches fully prevented zymogen activation and enhanced acinar basal secretion via an anterograde endosomal pathway (11Messenger S.W.

Noting that 1) acini prepared from VAMP8−/− mice show significantly elevated basal secretion and a diminished secretory inhibition in response to supramaximal CCK-8, 2) VAMP8-mediated acinar secretion is acutely dependent on endosomal trafficking in WT acini, and 3) VAMP8 is a ubiquitously expressed endosomal SNARE, we investigated the impact of acinar pancreatitis on the VAMP8-secretory pathway and its potential role in intracellular activated zymogen accumulation. Low doses of CCK-8 (1–100 pm) and carbachol (1–100 nm) increase digestive enzyme secretion from pancreatic acinar cells, whereas supramaximal concentrations progressively inhibit secretion from a maximal response. Interestingly, the time-course of maximally stimulated secretion from a single group of acinar cells proceeds as an early rapid phase that peaks at 1 min and declines by 2 min and a second longer phase that peaks at 3–4 min and slowly declines to basal levels over the subsequent 20–30 min (1Messenger S.W.

To measure secretion over time from a single population of mouse acinar cells, aliquots of cells and media were sequentially collected at 2-min intervals after stimulation with maximal (10 pm) and supramaximal (10 nm) doses of CCK-8. Analysis of cumulative secretion over 30 min revealed 3 slopes or phases of secretion: a rapid first phase (0–4 min), a moderate second phase (4–10 min), and a slow third phase (10–30 min) (Fig. 1A). The rate of the first phase is equal over the first 2 min for both maximal and supramaximal CCK-8; however, supramaximal CCK-8 reduced the slope of both the second and third phases, ultimately resulting in an ˜50% decrease in total secretion at 30 min (Fig. 1A). Sequential subtraction of the preceding level of secretion from each time point was done to identify the rate of secretion during each 2-min interval. Results indicate that the secretion rate during the first 2 min was equivalent for maximal and supramaximal CCK-8, but a significant reduction in the secretory rate from 2 to 6 min occurred after supramaximal simulation (Fig. 1B). In accordance with our previous study demonstrating that VAMP2 mediates the first and VAMP8 the second phase of secretion, these data suggest that VAMP8-dependent exocytosis is mainly compromised during supramaximal CCK-8 stimulation (1Messenger S.W.

As we previously reported, 4-h adenoviral expression of tetanus toxin light chain in acinar cells cleaves >80% of VAMP2 but has no effect on VAMP8, which has no tetanus toxin cleavage site (Fig. 1C) (1Messenger S.W. Falkowski M.A. Thomas D.D. Jones E.K. Hong W. Gaisano H.Y. Giasano H.Y. Boulis N.M. Groblewski G.E.

Analysis of stimulated secretion, calculated by subtracting basal from total secretion, demonstrates that loss of VAMP2 reduces maximal CCK-stimulated secretion by 50% in WT acini, whereas loss of VAMP2 in VAMP8−/− acini results in an almost complete loss of secretion (Fig. 1D). The residual secretion remaining in tetanus toxin (TeTx)-expressing VAMP8−/− cells is likely due to incomplete VAMP2 cleavage. Supramaximal CCK-8 inhibited secretion (ratio of supramaximal to maximal secretion) by 55% in GFP-control acini and 82% after VAMP2 cleavage when VAMP8 is the primary ZG SNARE (Fig. 1E). In contrast, in VAMP8−/− acini, where VAMP2 is the primary ZG SNARE, supramaximal stimulation reduced secretion by only 22%, supporting that VAMP8-mediated secretion is mainly inhibited by acinar hyperstimulation. Elevated cAMP in response to the hormone secretin or the cell-permeant cAMP analog 8-(4-chlorophenylthio) adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (CPT-cAMP), each, produces a small increase in amylase secretion; however, when added in combination with CCK-8, they significantly potentiate secretion (13Chaudhuri A. Kolodecik T.R. Gorelick F.S. Effects of increased intracellular cAMP on carbachol-stimulated zymogen activation, secretion, and injury in the pancreatic acinar cell.Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2005; 288: G235-G243Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We previously reported that VAMP8−/− acini have increased basal secretion that is inhibited by elevated cAMP (1Messenger S.W. Falkowski M.A. Thomas D.D. Jones E.K. Hong W. Gaisano H.Y. Giasano H.Y. Boulis N.M. Groblewski G.E. Vesicle-associated membrane protein 8 (VAMP8)-mediated zymogen granule exocytosis is dependent on endosomal trafficking via the constitutive-like secretory pathway.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 28040-28053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar); this is best detected by analyzing stimulated secretion where basal is subtracted from total secretion (compare WT and VAMP8−/− in Fig. 2, A and B). In WT acini, secretin and CPT-cAMP enhanced maximal CCK-8 secretion by 173 and 200% of maximal CCK-8 alone, respectively (Fig. 2A). Supramaximal CCK-8-stimulated secretion was increased from 2.2 to 3.2 units/μg of DNA in the presence of secretin but was not statistically significant. However, supramaximal CCK-8-stimulated secretion was significantly enhanced by 232%, in response to CPT-cAMP fully blocking the supramaximal CCK-induced secretory inhibition. In contrast to WT acini, no significant potentiation was detected in VAMP8−/− acini in response to maximal or supramaximal CCK-8 (Fig. 2B). As treatment of WT acini with CPT-cAMP and supramaximal CCK-8 fully prevents secretory inhibition (Fig. 2A), we examined the time course of secretion for this response (Fig. 2C). CPT-cAMP alone had no effects during the first 10 min and slightly elevated secretion at times >15 min. When combined with maximal CCK-8, CPT-cAMP clearly elevated third-phase (>10 min) secretion (Fig. 2C). Analysis of the secretory rate over the first 10 min (Fig. 2D) and calculation of the area under the curve (Table 1) indicated both first and second-phase secretion were significantly increased compared with maximal CCK-8 alone. Unexpectedly, the reduction in the second phase caused by supramaximal CCK-8 remained impeded in the presence of CPT-cAMP; however, third-phase secretion was markedly elevated, restoring total secretion over 30 min to levels seen for maximal CCK-8 alone (Fig. 2E). The lack of effect of CPT-cAMP on the second phase was further identified by analyzing the secretory rate over the first 10 min of secretion (Fig. 2F and Table 1). Thus, although elevated cAMP acts on VAMP8-dependent secretion, it does not restore the loss of VAMP8-mediated second-phase secretion during supramaximal CCK-8 but rather acts on the late third phase (>10 min). Moreover, VAMP2-mediated first-phase secretion is not compromised by supramaximal CCK-8 and, strikingly, is potentiated by elevated cAMP in response to maximal but not supramaximal CCK-8.Table 1Area under the curve for cAMP effect on CCK-8 stimulation (0–10 min)TimeMax CCKMax CCK + cAMP0–10 min23.6 ± 1.036.4 ± 6.2ap < 0.02.0–4 min11.7 ± 0.518.7 ± 3.0ap < 0.02.6–10 min11.9 ± 0.517.7 ± 3.2ap < 0.02.TimeSupraMax CCKSupraMax CCK + cAMP0–10 min14.0 ± 1.316.4 ± 0.80–4 min8.6 ± 0.89.9 ± 0.56–10 min5.5 ± 0.56.5 ± 0.3a p < 0.02.

Isolated acini are free from the inflammatory component of the disease, thus allowing investigation of the earliest cellular events leading to acinar damage. VAMP8−/− acini contain ˜4-fold more total trypsin activity (activated by enterokinase addition to lysates) than WT when normalized to cellular DNA (Fig. 3A). WT acini show an ˜10-fold induction in intracellular trypsin accumulation after supramaximal stimulation (Fig. 3B). Strikingly, VAMP8−/− show no increase in intracellular trypsin activity in response to supramaximal CCK-8. This is evident when normalizing to total cellular DNA or total intracellular trypsin activity, indicating basal levels of trypsin activity are extremely low in VAMP8−/− acini (Fig. 3C). Finally, as support that intracellular trypsin mediates cellular damage during pancreatitis, VAMP8−/− acini show no increase in necrosis as measured by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, compared with WT acini, which have a 6-fold increase (Fig. 3D). These results suggest that VAMP8-regulated membrane trafficking is essential to accumulate activated zymogens during the onset of acute pancreatitis. Because VAMP8 is involved in endosome and lysosome fusion reactions, the possibility that chronically impaired lysosome formation prevented intracellular zymogen activation in VAMP8−/− acini was evaluated by analysis of CatB maturation (Fig. 4, A and B). In comparison to WT, VAMP8−/− acini had greatly reduced levels of the proenzyme and single chain forms of the enzyme, whereas the mature double-chain form was highly elevated. Consistent with immunoblotting, CatB activity, which in WT acini is increased by supramaximal CCK-8 stimulation, was significantly elevated under basal conditions but not further increased by CCK-8 (Fig. 4C). As CatB activation requires a low pH environment typical of lysosomes and intracellular trypsinogen activation likewise occurs in an acidic compartment, we utilized the acidic dye Lysotracker Red to identify acidic organelles in acinar cells (Fig. 4D). Quantification of punctate structures <1 μm diameter amounted to ˜97% of total in WT acini, but was significantly reduced in VAMP8−/− acini (Fig. 4E). Rather, Lysotracker-positive punctate structures greater than 3 and 4 μm in diameter were increased by ˜4- and 10-fold, respectively, in VAMP8−/− acini (Fig. 4F). The enlarged acidic organelles support a role for VAMP8 in lysosome formation but also indicate that lysosome function remains intact in VAMP8−/− acini. Thus, the absence of intracellular trypsin accumulation with supramaximal CCK-8 may likely be due to a lack of zymogen and lysosome mixing rather than a direct inhibition of trypsinogen activation. We recently reported that expression of the endosomal protein Rab5 and its binding proteins D52 and EEA1 are essential to maintain VAMP8-dependent secretory activity in acini (1Messenger S.W.

Adaptive unfolded protein response attenuates alcohol-induced pancreatic damage.Gastroenterology. 2011; 140: 987-997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), decreased an average of 75% but was not significant. In contrast to protein, mRNA levels of these proteins remained stable (Fig. 5C). More aggressive pancreatitis by 4 hourly injections of CR in rat caused a marked reduction in all 3 proteins, similar to what is seen in rat acinar cells (Fig. 5D). In mice, which are more resistant to CR-pancreatitis, 7 hourly injections of CR or 72-h choline-deficient ethionine-supplemented feeding similarly resulted in reductions in Rab5/D52/EEA1 protein levels (Fig. 5E). These data suggest that the loss of VAMP8-dependent secretion during experimental pancreatitis is concordant with a progressive loss of endosomal regulatory proteins necessary to maintain the VAMP8-dependent secretory pathway. Similar to in vivo studies in mice where 7 hourly CR injections are necessary to produce significant decreases in endosomal proteins, supramaximal CCK-8 for 60 min in mouse acini reduced D52 by ˜50% (Fig. 6, A and B), with Rab5 and EEA1 remaining relatively stable (not shown). D52 contains putative PEST sequences in both the amino and carboxyl termini, suggesting it may be susceptible to ubquitination and proteasomal degradation. Unexpectedly, treatment of mouse acini with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 alone markedly reduced D52 expression to the same extent as CCK-8 treatment (Fig. 6A). Moreover, when added together, these agents fully depleted cellular D52 levels. Proteasomal inhibition by MG-132 is known to induce a large compensatory increase in cellular autophagy, suggesting D52 degradation might result from this process (19Ding W.-X. Ni H.-M. Gao W. Yoshimori T. Stolz D.B. Ron D. Yin X.-M. Linking of autophagy to ubiquitin-proteasome system is important for the regulation of endoplasmic reticulum stress and cell viability.Am. J. Pathol. 2007; 171: 513-524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Noting that the LAMP endolysosomal proteins are degraded during acute pancreatitis by CatB, acini were pretreated (30 min) with the CatB and CatL inhibitor Ca-074Me, resulting in a complete inhibition of D52 degradation in response to supramaximal CCK-8 (Fig. 6B). Acinar cells undergo a high rate of autophagic flux that is further enhanced by both secretory and supramaximal stimulation (20Mareninova O.A. Hermann K. French S.W. O'Konski M.S. Pandol S.J. Webster P. Erickson A.H. Katunuma N. Gorelick F.S. Gukovsky I. Gukovskaya A.S. Impaired autophagic flux mediates acinar cell vacuole formation and trypsinogen activation in rodent models of acute pancreatitis.J. Clin. Invest. 2009; 119: 3340-3355PubMed Google Scholar). We, therefore, examined the colocalization of D52 with the lysosomal marker LAMP2 and autophagy protein LC3, which when recruited from the cytosol to the growing phagophore by lipidation appears as cytoplasmic puncta indicative of autophagosmes (Fig. 6C). As previously seen for LAMP1 (21Messenger S.W. Thomas D.D. Falkowski M.A. Byrne J.A. Gorelick F.S. Groblewski G.E. Tumor protein D52 controls trafficking of an apical endolysosomal secretory pathway in pancreatic acinar cells.Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2013; 305: G439-G452Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), D52 partially colocalizes with LAMP2 under basal conditions when sparse LC3 puncta are present. Exposure to maximal and supramaximal concentrations of CCK-8 caused a large increase in LC-3 puncta, indicating enhanced autophagic flux. Quantification of D52/LC3/LAMP2 puncta revealed a >2-fold increase with secretory stimulation and 3-fold after supramaximal CCK-8, supporting that a portion of cellular D52 is targeted to the autophagic pathway during stimulation (Fig. 6D). These results were confirmed by immunoelectron microscopy demonstrating D52 immunoreactivity within autophagic vacuoles in acinar cells (Fig. 6E). Based on the current evidence that VAMP8-dependent secretion is lost early during CCK-pancreatitis, we hypothesized that enhancing secretion from the VAMP8-secretory pathway by overexpression of D52 or Rab5 would reduce intracellular trypsin accumulation. Suspension culture of acinar cells for 16 h causes reduced secretory activity, a loss of Rab5 and D52 expression, and no supramaximal CCK-stimulated trypsinogen activation. Additionally, maintaining either D52 or Rab5 by adenoviral expression will maint"

Bacterial RNAPs were proposed to rely on the same mobile element of the active site, the trigger loop (TL), for both nucleotide addition and RNA cleavage. RNA cleavage can also be stimulated by universal Gre factors, which should replace the TL to get access to the RNAP active site. The contributions of the TL and Gre factors to RNA cleavage reportedly vary between RNAPs from different bacterial species and, probably, different types of transcription complexes. Here, by comparing RNAPs from Escherichia coli, Deinococcus radiodurans, and Thermus aquaticus, we show that the functions of the TL and Gre factors in RNA cleavage are conserved in various species, with important variations that may be related to extremophilic adaptation. Deletions of the TL strongly impair intrinsic RNA cleavage by all three RNAPs and eliminate the interspecies differences in the reaction rates. GreA factors activate RNA cleavage by wild-type RNAPs to similar levels. The rates of GreA-dependent cleavage are lower for ΔTL RNAP variants, suggesting that the TL contributes to the Gre function. Finally, neither the TL nor GreA can efficiently activate RNA cleavage in certain types of backtracked transcription complexes, suggesting that these complexes adopt a catalytically inactive conformation probably important for transcription regulation.

https://openalex.org/W2594697404,"ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) controls cholesterol and phospholipid efflux to lipid-poor apolipoprotein E (APOE) and is transcriptionally controlled by Liver X receptors (LXRs) and Retinoic X Receptors (RXRs). In APP transgenic mice, lack of Abca1 increased Aβ deposition and cognitive deficits. Abca1 haplo-deficiency in mice expressing human APOE isoforms, increased level of Aβ oligomers and worsened memory deficits, preferentially in APOE4 mice. In contrast upregulation of Abca1 by LXR/RXR agonists significantly ameliorated pathological phenotype of those mice. The goal of this study was to examine the effect of LXR agonist T0901317 (T0) on the phenotype and brain transcriptome of APP/E3 and APP/E4 Abca1 haplo-deficient (APP/E3/Abca1+/- and APP/E4/Abca1+/-) mice. Our data demonstrate that activated LXRs/RXR ameliorated APOE4-driven pathological phenotype and significantly affected brain transcriptome. We show that in mice expressing either APOE isoform, T0 treatment increased mRNA level of genes known to affect brain APOE lipidation such as Abca1 and Abcg1. In both APP/E3/Abca1+/- and APP/E4/Abca1+/- mice, the application of LXR agonist significantly increased ABCA1 protein level accompanied by an increased APOE lipidation, and was associated with restoration of APOE4 cognitive deficits, reduced levels of Aβ oligomers, but unchanged amyloid load. Finally, using Gene set enrichment analysis we show a significant APOE isoform specific response to LXR agonist treatment: Gene Ontology categories “Microtubule Based Process” and “Synapse Organization” were differentially affected in T0-treated APP/E4/Abca1+/- mice. Altogether, the results are suggesting that treatment of APP/E4/Abca1+/- mice with LXR agonist T0 ameliorates APOE4-induced AD-like pathology and therefore targeting the LXR-ABCA1-APOE regulatory axis could be effective as a potential therapeutic approach in AD patients, carriers of APOEε4."
https://openalex.org/W2594866043,"Purpose To determine if early post-treatment central choroidal thickness (CCT) changes can predict sunset glow fundus (SGF) development in patients with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease treated using systemic corticosteroids. Methods This retrospective case series included 39 eyes of 21 treatment-naïve patients with acute VKH disease who could be followed up for more than 12 months after systemic corticosteroid therapy. The eyes were divided into two groups according to whether SGF was present or absent at 12 months (9 eyes of 5 patients versus 30 eyes of 16 patients, respectively). Using enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography, CCT values were measured before treatment, then at 1 week and 1 and 3 months after treatment in both groups and compared between the two groups. Results Development of SGF was found 4–11 months after treatment. Mean post-treatment CCT decreased significantly at all examinations compared with baseline in both groups, along with resolution of serous retinal detachment. One week after treatment, mean CCT was significantly higher in eyes with SGF than in those without (P = 0.024). SGF was present at 12 months in 9 of 22 eyes with CCT values > 410 μm at 1 week after starting treatment, in contrast with none of 17 eyes with CCT ≤ 410 μm at this time (P = 0.003). Conclusions The current study suggested the potential validity of early post-treatment CCT as a feasible index to alert future progression to SGF in patients with VKH disease treated using systemic corticosteroids."
https://openalex.org/W2593699473,"Cyclin Y (CCNY), which is a cyclin protein known to play a role in cell division, is unexpectedly and thus interestingly expressed in non-proliferating neuronal cells. There have been only a few studies reporting the neuronal functions of CCNY in synapse remodeling and hippocampal long-term potentiation. Therefore, we here provide global and comprehensive information on the putative functions of CCNY in biological and functional pathways in neuronal systems. We adopted high-throughput RNA-sequencing technology for analyzing transcriptomes regulated by CCNY and utilized bioinformatics for identifying putative molecules, biological processes, and functional pathways that are possibly connected to CCNY functions in hippocampal neuronal cells of rats. We revealed that several enriched annotation terms and pathways associated with CCNY expression within neurons, including apoptosis, learning or memory, synaptic plasticity, actin cytoskeleton, focal adhesion, extracellular matrix-receptor interaction and chemokine signaling pathway are targeted by CCNY. In addition, the mRNA levels of some genes enriched for those annotation terms and pathways or genes reported to be altered in Alzheimer's disease mouse model were further validated by quantitative real-time PCR in hippocampal neuronal cells. The present study provides an excellent resource for future investigations of CCNY functions in neuronal systems."
https://openalex.org/W2594744042,"We investigated the mechanisms of mushroom toxin resistance in the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) fly lines, using genome-wide association studies (GWAS). While Drosophila melanogaster avoids mushrooms in nature, some lines are surprisingly resistant to α-amanitin-a toxin found solely in mushrooms. This resistance may represent a pre-adaptation, which might enable this species to invade the mushroom niche in the future. Although our previous microarray study had strongly suggested that pesticide-metabolizing detoxification genes confer α-amanitin resistance in a Taiwanese D. melanogaster line Ama-KTT, none of the traditional detoxification genes were among the top candidate genes resulting from the GWAS in the current study. Instead, we identified Megalin, Tequila, and widerborst as candidate genes underlying the α-amanitin resistance phenotype in the North American DGRP lines, all three of which are connected to the Target of Rapamycin (TOR) pathway. Both widerborst and Tequila are upstream regulators of TOR, and TOR is a key regulator of autophagy and Megalin-mediated endocytosis. We suggest that endocytosis and autophagy of α-amanitin, followed by lysosomal degradation of the toxin, is one of the mechanisms that confer α-amanitin resistance in the DGRP lines."
https://openalex.org/W2593262825,"Dexamphetamine (AMPH) is a psychostimulant drug that is used both recreationally and as medication for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that repeated exposure to AMPH can induce damage to nerve terminals of dopamine (DA) neurons. We here assessed the underlying neurobiological changes in the DA system following repeated AMPH exposure and pre-treated rats with AMPH or saline (4 times 5 mg/kg s.c., 2 hours apart), followed by a 1-week washout period. We then used pharmacological MRI (phMRI) with a methylphenidate (MPH) challenge, as a sensitive and non-invasive in-vivo measure of DAergic function. We subsequently validated the DA-ergic changes post-mortem, using a.o. high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and autoradiography. In the AMPH pre-treated group, we observed a significantly larger BOLD response to the MPH challenge, particularly in DA-ergic brain areas and their downstream projections. Subsequent autoradiography studies showed that AMPH pre-treatment significantly reduced DA transporter (DAT) density in the caudate-putamen (CPu) and nucleus accumbens, whereas HPLC analysis revealed increases in the DA metabolite homovanillic acid in the CPu. Our results suggest that AMPH pre-treatment alters DAergic responsivity, a change that can be detected with phMRI in rats. These phMRI changes likely reflect increased DA release together with reduced DAT binding. The ability to assess subtle synaptic changes using phMRI is promising for both preclinical studies of drug discovery, and for clinical studies where phMRI can be a useful tool to non-invasively investigate DA abnormalities, e.g. in neuropsychiatric disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2591626690,"In an attempt to track the chromosomal differentiation in the Dichroplus elongatus species group, we analyzed the karyotypes of four species with classical cytogenetic and mapping several multigene families through fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). We improved the taxon sampling of the D. elongatus species group adding new molecular data to infer the phylogeny of the genus and reconstruct the karyotype evolution. Our molecular analyses recovered a fully resolved tree with no evidence for the monophyly of Dichroplus. However, we recovered several stable clades within the genus, including the D. elongatus species group, under the different strategies of tree analyses (Maximum Parsimony and Maximum Likelihood). The chromosomal data revealed minor variation in the D. elongatus species group's karyotypes caused by chromosome rearrangements compared to the phylogenetically related D. maculipennis species group. The karyotypes of D. intermedius and D. exilis described herein showed the standard characteristics found in most Dichroplini, 2n = 23/24, X0♂ XX♀, Fundamental number (FN) = 23/24. However, we noticed two established pericentric inversions in D. intermedius karyotype, raising the FN to 27♂/28♀. A strong variation in the heterochromatic blocks distribution was evidenced at interespecific level. The multigene families' mapping revealed significant variation, mainly in rDNA clusters. These variations are probably caused by micro chromosomal changes, such as movement of transposable elements (TEs) and ectopic recombination. These observations suggest a high genomic dynamism for these repetitive DNA sequences in related species. The reconstruction of the chromosome character ""variation in the FN"" posits the FN = 23/24 as the ancestral state, and it is hypothesized that variations due to pericentric inversions has arisen independently three times in the evolutionary history of Dichroplus. One of these independent events occurred in the D. elongatus species group, where D. intermedius is the unique case with the highest FN described in the tribe Dichroplini."
https://openalex.org/W2594837935,"Twenty-nine cDNAs encoding Ras-like family small GTPases (RSGs) were cloned and sequenced from Nilaparvata lugens. Twenty-eight proteins are described here: 3 from Rho, 2 from Ras, 9 from Arf and 14 from Rabs. These RSGs from N.lugens have five conserved G-loop motifs and displayed a higher degree of sequence conservation with orthologues from insects. RT-qPCR analysis revealed NlRSGs expressed at all life stages and the highest expression was observed in hemolymph, gut or wing for most of NlRSGs. RNAi demonstrated that eighteen NlRSGs play a crucial role in nymphal development. Nymphs with silenced NlRSGs failed to molt, eclosion or development arrest. The qRT-PCR analysis verified the correlation between mortality and the down-regulation of the target genes. The expression level of nuclear receptors, Kr-h1, Hr3, FTZ-F1 and E93 involved in 20E and JH signal pathway was impacted in nymphs with silenced twelve NlRSGs individually. The expression of two halloween genes, Cyp314a1 and Cyp315a1 involved in ecdysone synthesis, decreased in nymphs with silenced NlSar1 or NlArf1. Cyp307a1 increased in nymphs with silenced NlArf6. In N.lugens with silenced NlSRβ, NlSar1 and NlRab2 at 9th day individually, 0.0% eclosion rate and almost 100.0% mortality was demonstrated. Further analysis showed NlSRβ could be served as a candidate target for dsRNA-based pesticides for N.lugens control."
https://openalex.org/W2593151346,"Heterogeneous information networks (e.g. bibliographic networks and social media networks) that consist of multiple interconnected objects are ubiquitous. Clustering analysis is an effective method to understand the semantic information and interpretable structure of the heterogeneous information networks, and it has attracted the attention of many researchers in recent years. However, most studies assume that heterogeneous information networks usually follow some simple schemas, such as bi-typed networks or star network schema, and they can only cluster one type of object in the network each time. In this paper, a novel clustering framework is proposed based on sparse tensor factorization for heterogeneous information networks, which can cluster multiple types of objects simultaneously in a single pass without any network schema information. The types of objects and the relations between them in the heterogeneous information networks are modeled as a sparse tensor. The clustering issue is modeled as an optimization problem, which is similar to the well-known Tucker decomposition. Then, an Alternating Least Squares (ALS) algorithm and a feasible initialization method are proposed to solve the optimization problem. Based on the tensor factorization, we simultaneously partition different types of objects into different clusters. The experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets have demonstrated that our proposed clustering framework, STFClus, can model heterogeneous information networks efficiently and can outperform state-of-the-art clustering algorithms as a generally applicable single-pass clustering method for heterogeneous network which is network schema agnostic."
https://openalex.org/W2591584337,"In heterogeneous networks (HetNets), the large-scale deployment of small base stations (BSs) together with traditional macro BSs is an economical and efficient solution that is employed to address the exponential growth in mobile data traffic. In dense HetNets, network switching, i.e., handovers, plays a critical role in connecting a mobile terminal (MT) to the best of all accessible networks. In the existing literature, a handover decision is made using various handover metrics such as the signal-to-noise ratio, data rate, and movement speed. However, there are few studies on handovers that focus on energy efficiency in HetNets. In this paper, we propose a handover strategy that helps to minimize energy consumption at BSs in HetNets without compromising the quality of service (QoS) of each MT. The proposed handover strategy aims to capture the effect of the stochastic behavior of handover parameters and the expected energy consumption due to handover execution when making a handover decision. To identify the validity of the proposed handover strategy, we formulate a handover problem as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP), by which the effects of the stochastic behaviors of handover parameters and consequential handover energy consumption can be accurately reflected when making a handover decision. In the CMDP, the aim is to minimize the energy consumption to service an MT over the lifetime of its connection, and the constraint is to guarantee the QoS requirements of the MT given in terms of the transmission delay and call-dropping probability. We find an optimal policy for the CMDP using a combination of the Lagrangian method and value iteration. Simulation results verify the validity of the proposed handover strategy."
