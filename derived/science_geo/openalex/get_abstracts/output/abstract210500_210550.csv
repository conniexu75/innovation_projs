https://openalex.org/W1640038695,"The oxidation of ethanol to acetate by cultures of Methunobacillus omelianskii was found by Barker to be dependent upon carbon dioxide (1) ; using C140Z, Stadtman and Barker demonstrated conclusively that carbon dioxide was the precursor of methane (2). Recently Johns and Barker have reported hydrogen formation from ethanol by resting cells of M. omelianskii in the absence of carbon dioxide (3). The mechanism of carbon dioxide reduction to methane by M. omelianslcii as well as the mechanism of methane formation by other organisms is unknown. Current knowledge of the nutrition and fermentative patterns of the methane bacteria has been reviewed by Barker (4). The present communication is concerned with the formation of methane by cell-free extracts of &!f. omeliunskii; a brief report of some of these findings has appeared (5)."

After 13 weeks of isolation, rats had heavier adrenals and thyroid and lighter spleen and thymus compared with rats kept in community cages. This indicates an endocrinopathy with hyperfunction of the adrenal cortex."

https://openalex.org/W2078923794,"Observations with RNA isolated from the RNA virus indicate that regulation of protein synthesis occurs during translation. At least three electrophoretically separable proteins, one of which lacks histidine, appear as a result of adding purified viral RNA to a cell-free extract of Escherichia coli. This establishes that the RNA contains at least three cistrons. Comparison of the kinetics of appearance of the proteins that do and do not contain histidine reveals a control mechanism which determines the temporal order and the frequency of translation of each cistron. Such translational controls at the stage of message use provide additional devices for regulating protein synthesis which can supplement those functioning at the transcription step where genetic messages are produced."

The averages for body burden of cesium-137 were much higher than the average for people in the rest of the United States. The people of the interior village of Anaktuvuk Pass had the highest average burden of cesium-137, which was 421 nanocuries; the maximum burden was 790 nanocuries."
https://openalex.org/W2009349705,"Tilapia mossambica when placed in salt water shows an increase in the frequency of spontaneous discharges in some neurosecretory fibers in the urophysis of the caudal neurosecretory system. Exposure to tap water usually depresses this activity. The nature of the ion-regulatory action of the caudal neurosecretory system of teleosts remains conjectural, but the data currently available indicate the possible production of two kinds of neurohormones, one which favors ion movement in the normal direction and another which has the opposite eJffect in response to abnormal osmotic circumstances."

https://openalex.org/W1977785858,"Subcutaneous tumors induced in newborn hamsters by type 12 adenovirus were suppressed when 0.5 mg of 5-iodo-2′-deoxyuridine (IUdR) was given at the same subcutaneous site as the virus. Although one injection of IUdR given immediately after the virus was effective, additional injections on subsequent days reduced further the number of hamsters developing tumors. These effects of IUdR are especially interesting since replication of infectious adenovirus 12 cannot be demonstrated in the hamsters at any time before or after tumor development."

The maximum of the spectrum at pH 7.0 was at 275 mmicro, in contrast to that at 281 m/ A in normal met-myoglobin. Such an abnormality was not found in the limb-girdle type of dystrophy and in progressive spinal muscular atrophy. The results indicate the presence of an abnormal myoglobin in the Duchenne type of progressive muscular dystrophy."
